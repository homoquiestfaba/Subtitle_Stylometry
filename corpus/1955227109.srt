1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,343
(Man laughing)

2
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:10,344
Want to be scared?

3
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:11,979
Forget Freddy and Jason.

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,148
This is a whole
new crop of crazies

5
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:15,516
You haven't seen before.

6
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,185
These are movies you have to
see.

7
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,720
This is the only list you need.

8
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,322
We are counting down

9
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,291
50 of the scariest movies

10
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:24,758
That you've never seen.

11
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,394
(Female screaming)

12
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:28,596
It was the scariest
thing I had ever seen

13
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,131
Probably up until that point.

14
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:31,832
The whole mannequin
itself will sort of move

15
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,234
And then its mouth will drop
open

16
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,902
And just sort of scream at you.

17
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:37,004
When the creature comes,

18
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,208
This mutant jelly,
sausage, bear thing.

19
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,009
Despite the fact
that this movie

20
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,211
Was pulled from theaters,

21
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:46,046
Somehow it managed to spawn
four sequels.

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,681
It's like a fairy tale.

23
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:48,782
That's the greatest character

24
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:50,251
I've ever seen
in a slasher film.

25
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,986
There are so
many red herrings in it.

26
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,987
Of course everybody's wondering,

27
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,623
What is inside that basket?

28
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,225
Watch your nipples
because this baby

29
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,659
Likes a little more than milk.

30
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:01,462
It's in your face and
misogynistic

31
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,464
And it's directed by a woman!

32
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,333
It has some of
the best death scenes.

33
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:07,835
The whole time your
just like "No! No she's not."

34
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,403
"No she's not. No she's not!"

35
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:15,376
She definitely holds
his "future" in her hands.

36
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,845
(Laughs)

37
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:22,015
Welcome to the 50 Best
Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

38
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,286
A countdown of
horror's hidden gems.

39
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,357
We are shining the
spotlight on 50 lesser known

40
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,261
Yet totally amazing horror
movies that will satisfy

41
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:36,864
Even the most hard core
horror junky.

42
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,399
The needles in the eyeballs.

43
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,967
Like "Oh man."

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,569
Like your -

45
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,571
Really stylized, really violent.

46
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,273
The movie scared the crap
out of me.

47
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,674
It's insane.

48
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:47,775
It's terrifying.

49
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:48,876
It's pretty brilliant.

50
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,545
It's a very psychological
horror.

51
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:54,315
These spine chilling movies
have garnered cult followings

52
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:57,185
And critical praise and
it's time you discovered them.

53
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:59,487
So turn off the lights, lock
your doors

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,590
And get ready for a
count down like no other.

55
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,392
(Man screaming)

56
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:06,260
Grab some popcorn,
grab some beer, this is it.

57
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:08,496
This really are the 50 best
horror movies.

58
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,663
You've never seen.

59
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:10,964
You will sleep with the lights
on.

60
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:13,367
50 scary movies.

61
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,768
You have to see.

62
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:18,639
See this movies, they'll
scare the pants off of you.

63
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:23,444
These are the 50 Best
Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

64
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,114
A countdown of horror's hidden
gems.

65
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,750
Narrated by me, P.J. Soles.

66
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:33,754
We begin at number 50 with
Basket Case.

67
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,124
You at home, you
have to see Basket Case.

68
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,959
Oh my god, it's amazing.

69
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,394
It's set in New York.

70
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:42,930
It's really gritty but
it's also really creepy.

71
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,965
In Basket Case,
Belial is the monster

72
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,001
That our hero keeps in his
basket.

73
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,703
Hence, the Basket Case.

74
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:50,704
(Creature screams)

75
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:52,172
Finished already?

76
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:57,110
It's about a brother,
Duane, who had a conjoined twin.

77
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,347
Who was just a head and claws,

78
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,582
Just made of disgusting half
brother

79
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,317
But Duane loved his brother

80
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:07,154
And was totally sad that
his Dad separated them.

81
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,956
The father throws him
in the trash

82
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,991
And then our hero rescues him

83
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,895
And keeps him
as his pet/brother.

84
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,798
Belial is a little bit
on the nasty side.

85
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,533
One of the most charming
things about the movie

86
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,902
Because it predates CGI is
that it's all stop motion.

87
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,204
I thought that was very
cool back in the day

88
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:29,209
To move Belial, the big
lumpy appendage brother.

89
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:33,213
Had to be all stop motion and
to me it was a very cool effect.

90
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,416
The scene where
Belial attacks the nurse

91
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,750
And then jumps out the window.

92
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:40,388
Belial is sort of a mound of
just flesh with a face,

93
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:41,689
And one arm.

94
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,592
So to fling himself out the
window and crawl down

95
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,626
The side of the building

96
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:50,097
Is so creepily, blissful

97
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,933
That you can't help but just
love every second of it.

98
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,902
(Man screaming)

99
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,841
It's a really original idea

100
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:03,110
And it's really well executed.

101
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,913
I mean, you can laugh at
the stop motion animation

102
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,015
And think maybe it's
a little dated

103
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:09,750
But this is genuinely creepy.

104
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,553
It freaked me out when I was 14,
too,

105
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:16,857
Especially all the stuff about
the brother sharing everything

106
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,995
Including their first sexual
experiences. Eww.

107
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,198
It was so horribly awesome that
they made two sequels out of it.

108
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:28,402
It's my top five of movies that
I would recommend people watch

109
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:30,237
If they've never seen
horror movies before.

110
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,641
(Belial screaming)

111
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:37,778
Now doesn't that look
like a basket of bloody fun?

112
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,080
Now for number 49,

113
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,050
When A Stranger Calls.

114
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,285
If you want piss your pants
scary,

115
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,421
You need to watch
the first 15 minutes

116
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,156
Of When A Stranger Calls.

117
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,959
That first 15 minutes easily,

118
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,495
I think affected every
babysitter in America.

119
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:57,264
When A Stranger Calls is
a really fantastic little movie

120
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,433
From 1979, starring Carol Kane,

121
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:02,135
Colleen Dewhurst
and Charles Durning.

122
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,337
The first 15 minutes of the film

123
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,339
Follow Carol Kane as a
babysitter

124
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:06,774
Who's watching these two kids.

125
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,777
The babysitter's typical
girl next door, just there,

126
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,480
Going to do her homework, talk
on the phone with her friends

127
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,648
And starts getting this creepy
phone calls.

128
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:18,419
I first saw this movie
when I was 12 years old or so

129
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:20,988
And it was the scariest
thing I had ever seen

130
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,523
Probably up until that point,

131
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:25,659
To hear him call on the phone
and say,

132
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,027
"Have you checked the children?"

133
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,563
(Phone ringing)

134
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:31,665
Hello.

135
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,203
Why haven't you
checked the children?

136
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,038
So he keeps harassing
Carol Kane,

137
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,840
Asking her to check the children

138
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:43,711
And when she finally does...

139
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,846
Let's just say you have
to see it for yourself.

140
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,148
You're going to ask yourself,
did they really go there?

141
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,083
You have to see it
to know the answer.

142
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,853
Carol Kane as that babysitter
in that house,

143
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,488
With those phone calls

144
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:58,492
And the final moment
of that scene

145
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:01,261
Where she realizes
where the killer is

146
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,564
And that he's coming for her,

147
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,834
Is take your breath away
frightening.

148
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,737
The reason that
opening is so terrifying

149
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,238
And it stood the test of time

150
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:14,174
Is because it could actually
happen.

151
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:14,975
I thought that was
one of the best

152
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,410
Horror movies of the decade.

153
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,378
(Phone ringing)

154
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,213
Leave me alone!

155
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,216
All you baby sitters, beware.

156
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,888
Next up at number 48?
Silent Night, Deadly Night.

157
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,158
I think really bad
taste is very entertaining

158
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,462
And one of the films that is
the worst taste of all time

159
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,063
Is Silent Night, Deadly Night

160
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:39,066
Where you have Santa Claus
as a psycho.

161
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,201
It was only a matter of time
before somebody took Christmas

162
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,136
And kind of made a
horror movie out of that.

163
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,174
It had one of those giant
ass VHS boxes back in the 80s.

164
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,109
It made me feel like as a kid,

165
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,480
I thought I was a bad person
for watching this movie.

166
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,282
Silent Night, Deadly Night
is about a little boy Billy

167
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,118
Who sees his parents slain
by some guy

168
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,319
That just robbed
the convenient store

169
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,288
That happens to be
dressed like Santa Claus.

170
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:03,156
Even more traumatizing,
is that they sent Billy

171
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,558
To live with a bunch of nuns

172
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,059
For the remainder of his youth.

173
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,228
This very sinister evil nuns,

174
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,963
Who punish them
whenever they're bad.

175
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,164
The main character, Billy,

176
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:13,333
Develops a phobia of Santa
in Christmas

177
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,236
And also this intense sort
of thing of punishment

178
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,971
For anybody who does
anything wrong.

179
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,240
So years later
when he's forced to don

180
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,409
A department store
Santa outfit

181
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,944
And see something naughty
happen,

182
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:27,447
He snaps and becomes
this killer Santa.

183
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,382
Silent Night, Deadly Night has
probably one of my favorite

184
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,251
Kills
of the slash movie ever.

185
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,920
There's this two kids
that look like

186
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,387
They're too old to be sledding.

187
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,990
One of them goes down
and he's all right,

188
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:41,529
The second one comes down, Santa
Claus steps out with an axe.

189
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,030
(Horror sound)

190
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,532
(Man screaming)

191
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,366
You have killer Santa
in this movie,

192
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,636
And yet the grandfather I think
is far more upsetting

193
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,237
Than anything else.

194
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,609
Christmas Eve is the
scariest damn night of the year.

195
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,878
I'd be scared too,
if I were you.

196
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,980
It's one of the
funniest things I've ever seen.

197
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,082
Consider tame
by today's standards,

198
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,416
This chilly horror movie

199
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,755
Caused quite a snowstorm
when it was released in 1984.

200
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,657
Parents and all
these religious groups,

201
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,358
They were picketing the film,

202
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,194
They were picketing the studio,
writing letters.

203
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,428
It didn't create a controversy

204
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:19,132
Because it was this
horrific wholesome film.

205
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,869
It created it because
Santa Claus was a bad guy

206
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,772
And they were airing commercials
for it at like 7:00 at night

207
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,007
During family hour, bad idea.

208
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,343
People just went nuts
about the idea of something

209
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,780
As pure and innocent as a
character like Santa Claus

210
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,582
Being exploited in this way.

211
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:35,683
The movie eventually got pulled

212
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,551
After just a couple of weeks
release

213
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:40,220
Because just so much pressure
from all these groups.

214
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,822
Despite the fact that
is was this movie

215
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,223
That was pulled from theaters

216
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,059
Somehow it managed
to spawn four sequels.

217
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,562
Mickey Rooney was
even involved at one point,

218
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,297
Writing a letter to the studio.

219
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,000
Telling them that they should
be disgusted with themselves

220
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,201
For releasing this film.

221
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,637
Then ironically
some 5, 6 years later

222
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,172
Wound up in Silent Night,
Deadly Night 5

223
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,274
As the killer Santa Claus.

224
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,611
It's very disturbing,
it's cool

225
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,178
But there's something grubby
about it

226
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,847
Which only enhances
your enjoyment.

227
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,183
If you're in for a really
mean spirited ugly, cheese fest,

228
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,019
This is your thing.

229
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,921
Have you been good?

230
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:16,590
You'll be frozen in fear
after screening

231
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,425
Of Silent Night, Deadly Night,

232
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,827
Don't miss it!

233
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,731
At number 47 is every
teenager's nightmare,

234
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:26,700
The Slumber Party Massacre.

235
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:32,505
Yeah, Slumber Party Massacre,
a great 80s slasher movie.

236
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,974
It came out of 1982

237
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:36,944
And the funny thing about
it is directed by a woman

238
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:40,247
And written by this woman, Rita
Mae Brown, who was a feminist.

239
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,415
So this is going to be like the
first feminist slasher movie.

240
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:44,351
Somehow Roger
Corman gets a hold of this.

241
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:48,488
All he heard was girls,
slumber party, drill.

242
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,024
He decides this is going to be a
really great exploitation film.

243
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,026
What you end up with
is definitely not

244
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,696
Like a feminist parity
of a slasher film.

245
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,265
What you get is like a drill,

246
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,533
Drilling women
at a slumber party.

247
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,235
You've got
the group of girls,

248
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,204
They're having a slumber party

249
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,173
And then a maniacal
serial killer

250
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,742
Is picking them of one by one.

251
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:13,346
Brinke Stevens is a
goddess in terms of horror film.

252
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,983
If you want to see what led
her on the road to becoming

253
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,017
A scream queen,

254
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,019
You have to watch
Slumber Party Massacre.

255
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,722
You can see her star power
in this film,

256
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:26,393
And you can understand why she's
had as insane a career she has.

257
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:28,862
Slumber Party Massacre kind of
launched my career

258
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:29,897
As a scream queen

259
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,765
So I have a real soft spot
for it.

260
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,501
It came sort of at the
end of the slasher craze.

261
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,771
It was in the same genre as
Texas Chainsaw

262
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,774
Where you get some crazy
maniac with power tools

263
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,043
Doing terrible things
to pretty young girls.

264
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:46,146
I was surprised that
Slumber Party Massacre

265
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,215
Wasn't more well known.

266
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,819
It didn't have a Jason or
a Freddy kind of thing,

267
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:55,255
It never really got the fame
of Nightmare on Elm Street.

268
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:59,359
This movie has some of those
great, perfect slasher moments.

269
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,494
Like when the little sister
wants to go get a beer

270
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:02,629
Out of the fridge

271
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,733
And she opens it and a body -

272
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,134
(Horror sound)

273
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,903
Slumber Party Massacre has
a lot of those kind of moments

274
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:13,273
And I think that that's why
people enjoy the film so much.

275
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,442
In addition to the fact that
it's kind of a sisterhood movie.

276
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:19,747
It's this group of girls who
instead of breaking apart,

277
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,283
All kind of come together
to save each other

278
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,819
In the middle of this
massacre that's happening.

279
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,455
If you're a fan of gratuitous
nudity in slasher films

280
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,490
Then Slumber Party
Massacre has you covered.

281
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,658
There's a shower scene
at the beginning where the girls

282
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,226
Were like,
were talking about

283
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,594
Like a soccer game or something.

284
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,731
They're just lathering up
and passing soap around,

285
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,099
And it's just ridiculous.

286
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:41,334
One point in the movie,
they kill a pizza boy.

287
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,137
One of the girls gets hungry and
decides to take the pizza

288
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,907
From out from under his head.

289
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,211
Then she put it on his back
and eats the pizza

290
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,981
Off this poor dead guy.

291
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,784
You're not gonna
eat that dead guy's pizza!

292
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,852
I feel better
already, really I do.

293
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,789
Great, great horrible
mean-spirited scene.

294
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:03,256
Silly, fun, fluff.

295
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,524
I can't believe to this day

296
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,493
It's still sort of
one of those movies

297
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,695
That you know the title but
you haven't seen the movie.

298
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,798
Because I think people
will really be surprised

299
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:13,433
At how good and how funny
it really is

300
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,635
Both intentionally
and unintentionally.

301
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,605
All that was written and
directed by women

302
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:19,973
Which is pretty cool

303
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:23,443
For something in the
early 80s slasher genre.

304
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:28,181
You need to run out and get
a copy of this on DVD right now,

305
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,218
You will thank me later,
trust me.

306
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,420
If you like
Michael, Jason and Freddy,

307
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,055
You'll like the driller killer.

308
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,790
(Female screaming)

309
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:40,093
Now come on, that
looks like fun doesn't it?

310
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,329
The next movie on our
list will prove to you

311
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,031
That well, love hurts.

312
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:47,467
Coming in at number 46,
Valentine.

313
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,237
I loved Valentine
because it has

314
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,205
Some of the best death scenes.

315
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,174
Valentine was kind of an
under the radar

316
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,375
Kind of slasher film

317
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:57,044
That came out right
after Urban Legend

318
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,446
And the last Scream film
and all these other things.

319
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,482
So people don't really remember
it but what you have at its core

320
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,085
Is basically a really great
slasher movie.

321
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,188
It's based on
a book by Tom Savage.

322
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,689
The novel is incredible

323
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,025
And the director Jamie Blanks

324
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,593
Really wanted to create
something

325
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,096
That was true to the book
but also was

326
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,866
Just sort of throwback
to 1980s horror.

327
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,602
So he's really trying
to bring back that classic

328
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,940
80s slasher movie formula of
crazy killer,

329
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,842
Trying to kill all these girls

330
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:32,279
And stalking them and murdering
them in very clever ways.

331
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,348
The greatest thing
about Valentine is the script.

332
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:37,517
It's very, very well written.

333
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,187
It's a who-done-it
and anyone of the characters

334
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,154
Could be the killer.

335
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,523
There are so
many red herrings in it.

336
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,125
And throughout the course
of the movie

337
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,460
There's always this, "Oh I
thought it was this person"

338
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,196
But now I think
it's this person."

339
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,398
The plot centers
around these girls

340
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,901
That have known each
other since childhood.

341
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:56,703
There is the fat one,
the popular one,

342
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,272
The sexy one, the fun one.

343
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,840
And there's this
mysterious person

344
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,710
Sending them creepy
Valentines and notes.

345
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,279
One by one they get knocked
off and who's the killer?

346
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,715
Is it the cute guy,
or the other cute guy,

347
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,050
Or the other cute guy?

348
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,418
You know, you just don't know.

349
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,520
There's this one scene
where two of the characters

350
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:17,757
Are just sitting at home and
they get a box of chocolates,

351
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,760
And a card sent to them
for Valentine's Day.

352
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,595
So she opens up these chocolates

353
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,465
And she discovers
that there's maggots

354
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:29,469
Inside these chocolates
that she's eating!

355
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,438
(Horror sound)

356
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:36,543
You got to give it up for a
killer

357
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,878
That will taunt his
victims using chocolate.

358
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,747
Who can't have fun with that?

359
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,850
You've got Denise Richards as
the lead,

360
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,585
Bitchy, beautiful character.

361
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,787
She's just in this
Jacuzzi with alcohol

362
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,825
Lounging all fancy and the next
thing we know she gets a rose

363
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,327
And then she gets trapped
in the Jacuzzi.

364
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,997
Then he's like drilling holes
into it.

365
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,966
(Drilling machine)

366
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,803
The killer's kind of cool
because he's got this black

367
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,606
Kind of jacket in his cherub
kind of mask.

368
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,845
This cherub like mask that
really looks like an obese baby

369
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,814
And it's really creepy.

370
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,985
If you're looking for something
a little bit more like Scream

371
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,087
Or something a little bit
more like Urban Legend,

372
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,455
You've got to see Valentine.

373
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,423
(Horror music)

374
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:30,430
You are watching 50 Best
Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

375
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:34,034
A countdown of horror's hidden
gems.

376
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,003
Next up at number 45?

377
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:40,940
A baby that you won't soon
forget. Meet Grace.

378
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,709
Grace actually
has a lot in common

379
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,512
With a lot of horror films
from Japan.

380
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:49,349
Not the ghost films but
the sort of very unnerving,

381
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:52,319
Weird women going crazy
character dramas.

382
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,787
For me a really effective
horror movie is something

383
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,523
That really transcends,

384
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,025
And really gets on your skin
emotionally

385
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,693
And you cannot stop thinking
about it.

386
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,063
The basic premise of
the movie is that a woman,

387
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,831
She's been trying to
conceive for several years.

388
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,833
This the first time she gets to,

389
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,003
She gets in a horrible accident
and she doesn't lose the baby

390
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:11,604
But the baby dies.

391
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,840
And she makes the decision to
carry the baby to term anyway,

392
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,675
The dead baby, and deliver
naturally.

393
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,211
When she does, she asks for
a minute alone with the child

394
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,712
And reluctantly the midwife
agrees

395
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:23,050
And when she comes back the
baby is alive and nursing.

396
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:27,487
It's a miracle but it's not
without...

397
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,122
Sinister consequences.

398
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,990
Watch your nipples
because this baby

399
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,392
Likes a little more than milk.

400
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:35,562
The core idea of Grace is
to sort of create a situation

401
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,830
Where a woman
is doing horrific things,

402
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,133
That you would do in her
situation.

403
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,302
It's very important to me,
to not be able

404
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,772
To dismiss this character
as a lunatic or a kook.

405
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:50,277
She is a mother, who loves
her child as any other mother

406
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,145
And is just trying to
keep her child alive.

407
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,982
And bit by bit she's
crossing various lines

408
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,317
In understandable ways.

409
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,921
If your child is hungry
and needs something to eat

410
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,291
You're going to provide
something to eat

411
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,825
Any way you can.

412
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,727
(Woman in pain)

413
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,029
Although it is a monster
baby movie

414
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:14,033
It's not this weird,
mutant creature with fangs

415
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,603
That's like pulling people under
the couch and attacking them.

416
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:17,804
It's more the fact
that this woman

417
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,107
Has this un-dead mutant baby

418
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,975
Who needs to drink blood
and she sort of has

419
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,811
This descent into madness.

420
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,147
Because when the baby
starts biting her

421
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,915
And wanting to drink her blood

422
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:31,751
And she keeps needing more and
more blood, and fresh blood.

423
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:32,952
Then people coming
wanting to know

424
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,587
What's happening with the baby

425
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:36,956
And they can't see this
weird creature thing.

426
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,726
It's important to me to not
spoon feed you the explanation

427
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,027
For what's going on
with the baby.

428
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,997
I mean it's vampiric
and it's not alive.

429
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,934
But the terms
don't exactly apply.

430
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:49,869
Grace premiered
at the prestigious

431
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,638
Sundance Film Festival

432
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:55,642
And on its first screening
reports of fainting men emerged.

433
00:17:55,675 --> 00:18:00,613
Two guys at Sundance fainted
watching this movie. Fainted!

434
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:03,150
How many people faint
anymore watching movies?

435
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,784
I love it that it was
exclusively men

436
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,319
For the little
while passing out.

437
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:07,820
I love gore,
I love horror movies.

438
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,256
I grew up on this stuff.

439
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,391
I'd like to think nothing
affects me.

440
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,461
Grace made my stomach
turn, I don't know why,

441
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,429
I can't exactly explain it.

442
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,232
Men are really uncomfortable
with sort of like

443
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:22,302
The female body
and their you know,

444
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:25,305
It's still
very awkward territory for men

445
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:30,443
So I just, I'm a little
bit of [unintelligible].

446
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,545
I don't like to punish an
audience that's irresponsible

447
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,482
But I do like to sort of
twist the knife a little bit.

448
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,617
Zombie baby
needs blood to survive.

449
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,286
I mean if that doesn't
make you want to see it,

450
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,620
I don't know what will.

451
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,189
It's Grace.

452
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,823
(Baby cries)

453
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:48,161
Ohh and you thought that all
babies were cute and innocent.

454
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,530
Don't miss Grace!

455
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,733
If you like vampire movies,
you must see the movie

456
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,002
At position number 44.

457
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:59,872
The cult classic, The Hunger.

458
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,374
The Hunger has got to be one of

459
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:04,177
The best horror features
ever made.

460
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:08,915
That movie visually is just - I
mean it's absolutely gorgeous.

461
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,318
The opening
ten minutes of the movie

462
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,386
With Bauhaus and the killing,
and then the monkey

463
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,422
And like it's got all
this great things,

464
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,424
All just jammed
in the first 10 minutes.

465
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:22,795
The Hunger is the quintessential
lesbian vampire movie.

466
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,898
Catherine Deneuve is so cruel,

467
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:28,468
Like she is one of
the cruelest vampires.

468
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,537
Who wouldn't want to be bitten
by her?

469
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,905
Who wouldn't want to
spend eternity with her?

470
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,742
She's hot! Holy shit!

471
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,544
A little David Bowie thrown in

472
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,312
And I included him
because let's face it

473
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,281
He's a little androgynous
anyway.

474
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:44,417
Then Susan Sarandon, I mean one
of the greatest actresses

475
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:45,752
Of our time.

476
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,456
Here she is, this vampire
lover and at the end she -

477
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,858
I can't tell you
but you got to see it!

478
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,261
Catherine Deneuve and
David Bowie are two vampires

479
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:56,763
And suddenly he starts having
this weird aging thing.

480
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,898
Where he gets old really fast,

481
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,967
Which I guess happens
every 100 years.

482
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,636
This starts to happen to David
Bowie and she picks a new lover

483
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,171
And it's Susan Sarandon.

484
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,908
Which leads to all sorts
of vampirism, violence,

485
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,877
And of course kinky eroticism.

486
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,180
Of course Sarandon
is absolutely wonderful,

487
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,849
Not to mention young and
beautiful in this.

488
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,751
It's definitely sort of a
forgotten Sarandon role.

489
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:24,591
She has this sort of remarkable
duality of vulnerable and tough.

490
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,259
There's a very famous love scene

491
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,428
Between Catherine Deneuve
and Susan Sarandon

492
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,829
In the middle of the film.

493
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,764
And it's we're seeing.

494
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:32,999
It's very bizarre,

495
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,166
It's just one of those films
that I think

496
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,702
Could only exist in the 80s.

497
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,136
It wouldn't happen now.

498
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,675
It's just bizarre and creepy
and like scene with lesbian sex,

499
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,244
Intercut with monkeys
killing each other.

500
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:51,951
That movie is like a
new wave, soft core, hot fest

501
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,321
Of lesbian vampire goodness.

502
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:57,357
There's a rumor that
David Bowie upon watching this

503
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,791
Has never aged.

504
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:02,895
Look at Bowie in Labyrinth and
then look at Bowie like now,

505
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,165
He's older but how the -
does he stay so young looking?

506
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,134
(Music)

507
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:11,838
David Bowie, Catherine
Deneuve, and Susan Sarandon?

508
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,640
Loads of bloody fun!

509
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:17,243
For the monster movie lover in
you, why not check out Prophecy

510
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,212
Coming in at number 43.

511
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:23,416
If you had to see one
mutant bear movie in your life

512
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,851
It should be the Prophecy.

513
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,653
Prophecy,
when it came out 1979

514
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,755
Was build
as the monster movie.

515
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,057
Stars Armand Assante
from Mambo Kings

516
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,925
And Talia Shire from Rocky.

517
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,627
Prophecy doesn't get
the credit it deserves.

518
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,463
It's an environmental
horror film

519
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,897
Long before they're making them

520
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,834
Is it's amazing schlocky,
late 70s killer bear movie.

521
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:45,237
In a lot of ways it's sort
of America's answer to Godzilla.

522
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:48,808
Godzilla is a by product
of nuclear testing

523
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:53,380
And Prophecy is the result
was because of mercury

524
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,647
And chemicals in the water

525
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:57,350
Which mutated this animal.

526
00:21:57,384 --> 00:22:01,388
When the creature comes
and it is this mutant,

527
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,890
Jelly, sausage bear thing

528
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,325
Roaring around, rawr-rawr-ra.

529
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,329
It's so fun and endearing
and just like

530
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:12,031
"Oh my, are you kidding me?"

531
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,232
That you just go with it.

532
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,301
The bears get like huge
and mutate

533
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,636
And they're like running around.

534
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,472
They're like 20 feet tall
with like rotting skin

535
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,941
And just like giant - you know.

536
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,810
You feel bad for
the bear because it's trying

537
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,244
To protect its kids.

538
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,214
None of them are meant to
be this mutated creatures.

539
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:32,452
(Creature roaring)

540
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:35,488
One of the best parts
of Prophecy for me personally,

541
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:39,225
Is Armand Assante as an Indian.

542
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:42,595
Running around with his
bow and arrow, awesome.

543
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:44,531
The sooner the
Indian Armand Assante,

544
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:47,867
The native American going up
against the bear with his bow

545
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,135
That's great stuff.

546
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:52,004
(Creature roaring)

547
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,107
I think this movie,
coming out in 1979

548
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,878
Was sort of, part of that
first wave of environmentalism

549
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,881
That really got going
after disasters

550
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:05,017
Like Three Mile Island
and Love Canal.

551
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:09,155
Everybody was really worried
about corporate toxic waste

552
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:12,425
Getting into our water,
and getting into our food,

553
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:16,796
And turning us all into
crazy mutated freaks.

554
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,731
Prophecy is great,
it's underrated.

555
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,299
Steven King loves Prophecy,

556
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,368
Anybody get a copy
of Steven King's book

557
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,804
Where he gives five pages to it
in Danse Macabre.

558
00:23:24,837 --> 00:23:26,138
When you look at Prophecy today,

559
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:28,775
Yeah it's kind of funny
and it's a little hokey.

560
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,142
Yeah the monster
doesn't look like

561
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,578
What it looks like on the poster

562
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:34,981
But once you can kind
of get passed that

563
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,282
It's a guy in a costume

564
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,618
And just watch the movie,
it works.

565
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,487
(Creature roaring)

566
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,989
(People screaming)

567
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:46,993
Who can't resist a giant
sausage salami monster?

568
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:50,329
This next movie is an
over the top genre gem

569
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,398
That will leave you speechless.

570
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,168
Coming in at number 42
is The Dentist.

571
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:58,671
I don't know about you
but Dentist give me the creeps.

572
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,507
We've all been to the dentist

573
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,576
And we all have natural anxiety
about going to the dentist.

574
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,012
Dentists are real people,
they're going to have bad days,

575
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:08,515
Well he has a really bad day.

576
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:10,783
Corbin Bernsen is in
it and he plays this dentist.

577
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:12,685
He kind of snaps
because his wife gets

578
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:14,787
A sweet tooth
for some other guy.

579
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:18,290
So all day long, in his office,
he's just torturing patients

580
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:21,427
That come in for their
cleanings and crowns.

581
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,729
(Woman screaming)

582
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,597
It's one of those
films where if you watch it

583
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,266
This-of course
it's a little far fetched

584
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,400
But this could happen.

585
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,637
Your dentist could decide to
snap one day

586
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,340
And just accidentally plunge the
drill half way down your throat

587
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,975
And cause this big bloody mess

588
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,811
Which your insurance probably
wouldn't cover anyway.

589
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:41,113
One critic said,
"If you've got teeth,

590
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,549
This film is guaranteed"

591
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,552
"To give you nightmares,"
and we couldn't agree more.

592
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:47,019
It's so over the top,

593
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:51,123
What this dentist does to
this people is just so crazy,

594
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,459
Ruthless, and bloody, and awful

595
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,528
That it's almost makes it
okay to watch.

596
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,530
You don't sit there
wanting to scrub yourself

597
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,331
Because you feel dirty
watching it.

598
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:00,667
You're almost like in disbelief

599
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,468
That you're watching
what you're watching.

600
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,402
You'll be covering your eyes,

601
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,971
You'll be doing a lot of this.

602
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:09,408
It really makes you kind
of think as you're going under

603
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,111
And you're in that chair
you think,

604
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,847
What kind of day
has my dentist had?

605
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:18,618
So it definitely, it gets
you dreading your next trip

606
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,386
To the dentist
even more than usual.

607
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,056
Watching his dentist
just flip out is so much fun.

608
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,758
I was hoping sequels
would come out,

609
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:30,096
Like the Construction Worker and
the Lawyer and the Librarian,

610
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,431
But it never happened.

611
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,768
There now, better?

612
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:37,469
With two sequels
to look forward to,

613
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,840
I suggest you start watching
immediately.

614
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:44,043
If giant rodents equate to
your idea of a good time

615
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:48,180
You will love The Food of The
Gods, coming in at number 41.

616
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,517
The Food of The
Gods was released in 1976

617
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,254
But you feel as though it could
have been released in 1956.

618
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,725
I mean it's definitely got
those kind of special effects.

619
00:25:58,758 --> 00:26:03,863
Special effects are not what
I would call the highest quality

620
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:09,268
But in some ways that is why I
recommend it because it's fun.

621
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:13,405
It's a giant rat movie and
it was made decades after anyone

622
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,107
Kept making drag rat movies.

623
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,876
Food of The Gods is a good film

624
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,412
Because the animals get back
at the humans

625
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:25,752
And they grow nice and big,
it puts man and beast

626
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:28,487
At the same fighting strength.

627
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,356
Food of The Gods
is one of those

628
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,424
Environmental horror movies.

629
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,594
Something that's getting into
the water,

630
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,664
And the plants are infected

631
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,633
And then the animals that
eat the plants are infected

632
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:43,803
And then the animals that eat
the other animals are infected,

633
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,705
And they grow giant and mutate.

634
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:48,240
It's one of the big,
kick ass, killer rat movies.

635
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:51,343
The rats are being shot,
the rats are chasing a jeep.

636
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:54,380
They used real
rats in this little models

637
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:57,216
Like this little toy cars
and little toy houses

638
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,185
And it's so obvious.

639
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:03,690
There's this one scene where a
rooster is attacking somebody,

640
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,958
I can't remember who it was
but it's hysterically funny

641
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:09,261
Because it's obviously this
big paper mache rooster head

642
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,331
And it's kind of like someone's
throwing it at the actor

643
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,734
And the actor's like "Ahh,"
it's so funny.

644
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,503
I kind of wonder like the
actors when they signed on

645
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,740
I mean Ida Lupino,
an icon is stabbing

646
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:23,542
A giant rat in her kitchen

647
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,111
As it climbs through the window.

648
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:30,149
(Rat squeaking)

649
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,885
You know what, that's
kind of why you want to see it.

650
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,922
Because it's so cheesy fun.

651
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,356
I mean it's cheesy and it's bad

652
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:39,058
But the fact that
it's entertaining

653
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,293
And fast paced at the same time.

654
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,896
You can't beat it, I mean it
makes you want to run out

655
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,366
And get some KFC.

656
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,603
(Rat squeaking)

657
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:56,308
You are watching 50 Best
Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

658
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:59,545
A countdown of horror's
hidden gems.

659
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:04,717
Next up at number 40,
Motel Hell.

660
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:08,154
Motel Hell is about
the place where you check in

661
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,488
But you do not check out.

662
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,292
It is a story of a couple
that runs the motel Hello.

663
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:16,562
But when the neon sign flashes
out, it's the Motel Hell.

664
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:19,598
Oh Motel Hell, how I love the -

665
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:23,635
Let's just say best
cannibalism movie ever.

666
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:27,673
It takes all critters to
make farmer Vincent's fritters!

667
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,609
This people have this weird,

668
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:34,613
I guess it's a motel but
mainly it's a sausage house.

669
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,083
Of course their hicks because
we all know hicks are crazy.

670
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,218
We've learned anything from
watching horror movies,

671
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,552
If you don't live in the city,

672
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:43,222
You're demented and eat people

673
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,358
And you probably have sex with
your sister and are deformed.

674
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,661
Rory Calhoun is the
proprietor of this place

675
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:53,299
And his also a sausage maker.

676
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:56,402
So you can put the two together,
figure out where this is going.

677
00:28:56,435 --> 00:29:00,372
Basically what all of
their guests are really for

678
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:05,111
Is not just the income for the
down payment on the hotel room

679
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:08,714
But to be buried in their
garden outback and fattened up

680
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,317
So that they can be cooked into
this sort of sausagy fritters

681
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,418
That they're famous for.

682
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,886
You also get to see people
planted

683
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,721
In the ground like cabbages

684
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,624
Because that, makes sense?

685
00:29:18,657 --> 00:29:21,360
I think what I love
about movies like this one

686
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:22,628
Is the sense of humor.

687
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,997
Farmer Vincent is so proud
of the fact

688
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:26,532
That they don't use
preservatives

689
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,400
And then on his death bed
at the end,

690
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,336
The big confession
is not that he's been

691
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,670
Slaughtering all this people

692
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:35,407
Who come to his motel to
put them into his fritters.

693
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,311
It's that they did use
preservatives.

694
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:47,987
I used preservatives.

695
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,288
Ohh!!

696
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,757
You might want to look on
the back of your sausage package

697
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,560
To make sure you know
exactly what's in it.

698
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:56,195
Or you can just watch Motel Hell

699
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,629
And that will explain
everything.

700
00:29:57,663 --> 00:29:59,065
Yeah, I think this horror movie

701
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:01,633
Is probably
a vegetarian's wet dream

702
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,102
Because you can watch it
and be like

703
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:07,639
"See, I told you!
Parts is parts!"

704
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:09,041
"You don't want
to eat that stuff."

705
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:09,876
"You don't know what's in it,"

706
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,343
"It could be your grandma!"

707
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:13,312
(Man screaming)

708
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:18,784
Yes folks, this movie
actually got made,

709
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,987
And yes, you must see it!

710
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,754
The next time you get lost
in your car,

711
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:26,392
You'll totally be thinking of
horror movie at number 39,

712
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,894
Wrong Turn.

713
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,495
You have to see Wrong Turn,

714
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,364
The whole idea
of taking a wrong turn

715
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,234
And ending up
in this hellish situation

716
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:37,369
Is something that I think
anybody can relate to.

717
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,471
We've all been lost
at some point

718
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:42,541
And this just happens to really
play up that idea really great.

719
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:46,445
It's a story about a bunch
of inbred cannibals really

720
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:51,083
That live in the woods and they
prey on people that get lost.

721
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,784
They're in the middle
of Virginia

722
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:55,787
And they just sort of attack
these people and eat them.

723
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,256
A good family movie.

724
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,158
These are hillbilly's from hell.

725
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,461
These are the kind of people
that you don't want to cross

726
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,130
If you're ever lost.

727
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,933
If you see anything
remotely looking like them,

728
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:09,068
You go the other way and run.

729
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,170
Wrong Turn features
a strong cast

730
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,905
Including Desmond Harrington,

731
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:16,342
Jeremy Sisto, and Eliza Dushku.

732
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,911
Eliza Dushku, I don't even
know if I said her name right

733
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,446
But she's hot,
it's good enough for me.

734
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,248
She's under a table or something

735
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:24,250
And she's watching her
friend just get cleaved.

736
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:26,218
You put yourself on those
situations and you're like,

737
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:27,886
How do I handle it
if I'm watching

738
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,289
My boyfriend, girlfriend, wife,

739
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,091
Lover, whatever
just getting hacked

740
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,659
And there's nothing
you could do about it.

741
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,794
There's this one scene where

742
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,797
The three surviving characters
escape

743
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,368
Up into this watchtower in
the middle of the woods.

744
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,271
Then you realize the
cannibals aren't so dumb

745
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:49,108
Because, since there's only one
way in, there's only one way out

746
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:52,378
And they're like 300 feet
in the air or something.

747
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,446
And the monsters,
instead of climbing up

748
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,682
To get them,
they set it on fire.

749
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,284
Oh my god.

750
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:02,921
(Horror music)

751
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:03,755
It's crazy.

752
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,024
So you got to see it.

753
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:07,893
Eliza Dushku in a good
bloody horror film, shit.

754
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,896
They should have made that
movie over and over again.

755
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,532
(Female crying)

756
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:15,267
(Female screams)

757
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:18,270
I guarantee you that you'll
never forget your GPS

758
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:19,738
After seeing this movie.

759
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,573
If telekinesis
gets you going,

760
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:26,512
Get your hands on a copy of The
Fury, coming in at number 38.

761
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,147
The Fury's directed
by Brian De Palma,

762
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,149
Who two years earlier
had made Carrie.

763
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:31,350
I think what's great
about The Fury

764
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,719
Is that it's got a spy
thriller element to it.

765
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,254
If you took a horror film

766
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,057
And combined it with a
summer action blockbuster

767
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,125
You would have The Fury.

768
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:40,492
The cast in this movie
is amazing.

769
00:32:40,526 --> 00:32:43,195
You got Kirk Douglas as an
on the run government agent

770
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:45,998
Looking for his kidnapped son,
who is played by Andrew Stevens.

771
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:49,801
And you also have Amy Irving
and John Cassavetes.

772
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,970
Kirk Douglas' son
is a psychic

773
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,972
And he's kidnapped by
this government agents.

774
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,875
They kidnapped Andrew Stevens
because he has this power,

775
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,878
This telekinetic power and kind
of prime him

776
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,014
To work for their organization.

777
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,416
Basically these government
agents want to harness

778
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,652
The psychic powers
from Andrew Stevens

779
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,555
So they can use it for all their
kind of secret experiments.

780
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:12,091
So they pamper him,
they give him everything

781
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:14,160
And Andrew Stevens
becomes their puppet

782
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:17,696
Until he finds out that he
has a rival in Amy Irving

783
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,965
Who's younger and has
the same kind of power.

784
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,600
So she teams up
with Kirk Douglas

785
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,335
And they have to rescue
the psychic son.

786
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,971
Basically you've got two
people with psychic powers,

787
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,473
Two not just one.

788
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:30,842
Basically the Fury is
like Carrie on overdrive.

789
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:33,079
There's some fantastic
set pieces in the film.

790
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:35,281
Whenever Amy Irving goes
into a psychic fit,

791
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:37,916
Everyone around her
starts bleeding.

792
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:41,353
As you might suspect causes a
whole lot of carnage mayhem.

793
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:42,821
You can see it on her face,

794
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,724
Her hands are just shaking as
the power, you could feel it.

795
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:46,825
You could feel it.

796
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,893
There's also a huge attack
sequence

797
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,695
At this indoor carnival.

798
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,763
For the day,
it's pretty impressive.

799
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,865
At this point in the
movie, Andrew Stevens' character

800
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,967
Is kind of turned into a
psychopath.

801
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,970
The secret government
agency pushes him too far.

802
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,872
They're giving him way
too many tests,

803
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:04,343
They've taken him
away from his Dad,

804
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,546
Their sort of psychologically
screwing him up,

805
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,516
And so he gets more furious.

806
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,551
He just stares at
this amusement park ride

807
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,086
And the veins are popping out
of his head

808
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,122
And all of a sudden
the ride breaks,

809
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:18,557
People go flying,
screws are flying.

810
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,760
It's just a complete disaster.

811
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,931
(People screaming)

812
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:27,533
The next time you're in
an amusement park ride,

813
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,469
You're going to be thinking of
this scene, it's terrifying.

814
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:33,839
The camera work in this thing
is phenomenal

815
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,374
And it's underrated

816
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,009
And people just say well Brian
De Palma, well that's Carrie,

817
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:40,212
The Untouchables,
Dressed To Kill,

818
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,647
They mention all
of his other stuff

819
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,216
But that little Fury
had a big budget

820
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,385
And it had like all these stars.

821
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,519
You're going to love this movie

822
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:49,821
Because you're immersed
in that atmosphere.

823
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,391
You definitely got to see
it, one of the best movies.

824
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,126
If you like Brian De Palma's
Carrie

825
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,362
And you're looking for some
more telekinetic mayhem,

826
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:59,131
Then pick up a copy of The Fury.

827
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:01,099
I can make you get up.

828
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:07,673
Classic Brian De Palma,
trust me, I know.

829
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:11,109
Claiming our number 37 spot
is the cult classic,

830
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,644
April Fool's Day.

831
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:14,380
And I'm not joking around.

832
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,882
April Fool's Day
is this awesome comedy horror

833
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:19,017
That tricks you into thinking
it's one thing

834
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,519
And it's another
and then it's another.

835
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,988
April Fool's Day kind of came
late in the slasher cycle,

836
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,390
Came on 1986.

837
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:27,159
There was all the Friday the
13th movies coming out,

838
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:28,494
Halloween movies coming out

839
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,963
And then you have this fun
little campy, slasher film

840
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:33,199
Just popping out of nowhere.

841
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:37,269
It stars the 80s scream
queen, Deborah Foreman.

842
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:39,871
From valley girl, My Chauffeur,

843
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:42,007
God love you wherever
you are Deborah Foreman.

844
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,309
She was so cute and ridiculous

845
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,645
And Amy Steele was like
the tough as nails chick.

846
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,914
Then Amy Steele was also
in Friday the 13th part two,

847
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,882
So she certainly had
a genre following.

848
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:55,086
April Fool's Day enrages every
guy who loves blood and guts

849
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,557
And every girl who, "I like
scared but not too scared."

850
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,025
They love April Fool's Day!

851
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:01,927
It's such a ridiculous plot.

852
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,296
It's so ridiculous, it's
hard to explain in fact.

853
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,164
It's fun because you've
got all of this like

854
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,766
80s archetypal characters.

855
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:11,403
You've got the rich kid,
who has the house, Muffy.

856
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:12,671
Muffy's the real name,

857
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,474
I mean I figured Muffy
must stand for something.

858
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,742
Muffin?

859
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:21,146
Muff child, moffo,
the muffster, muffin stuff.

860
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,849
Muff dive.

861
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:24,850
And she invites
all of her friends

862
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,518
Over to this island cottage

863
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:29,255
That is huge and there's
like rooms everywhere,

864
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:31,490
And you got the jock,
you got the smart kid,

865
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,959
You got the rich preppy kid.

866
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,694
One by one they're picked off

867
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,997
And Amy Steele our heroine
is trying to solve mystery

868
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,166
And then she realize
Muffy has a twin sister.

869
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,868
Buffy, or so she thinks.

870
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,470
The plot is so thin.

871
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,705
Amy Steele and her boyfriend
are in the basement I think

872
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,908
And her boyfriend sees like
the eyes behind this painting.

873
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,844
Oh my god.

874
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:57,583
Amy goes and pulls
the photo off.

875
00:36:57,616 --> 00:37:00,986
(Woman screaming)

876
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,187
That was fun.

877
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,956
Not to mention, what
I thought in my 10 year old mind

878
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,794
Was the craziest sex scene
in the history of the world.

879
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,629
Although it was just legs
in the air,

880
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,932
To me at 11, 10 whatever I
was and my mom's next to me,

881
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,435
It was the most uncomfortable
thing in the universe.

882
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:17,903
This movie definitely has one

883
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,638
Of the more memorable
twist endings

884
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:21,507
In all of slasher movie history.

885
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,709
I think as the audience
we were kind of like, "Huh?"

886
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,776
"Wait, what?"

887
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,044
At the end the big reveal is -

888
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,847
Of course we won't
reveal the ending here

889
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,451
But don't be foolish by
skipping this 80s classic.

890
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,352
Jesus!

891
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:34,553
It's so awesome,

892
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,722
You just get sucked right in and
before you know it,

893
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,089
You've sat their
for an hour and an half.

894
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:41,660
And like "Man I forgot how -
good this movie really is."

895
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,462
It's a lot of fun to watch.

896
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,298
Especially with a new girlfriend
or something like that.

897
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:48,567
Yeah, it's a little
on the softer side.

898
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,603
(Horror music)

899
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:56,174
All joking aside, April
Fool's Day is worth a look.

900
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:02,714
Number 36, is the salty monster
movie, Humanoids From The Deep.

901
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:04,616
Okay, listen to me, you're
going to hear about

902
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,485
A bunch of movies
on the special.

903
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,153
But if you're a 14 year old boy

904
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:09,788
And you're looking
for the real deal

905
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,957
It is freaking
Humanoids in The Deep!

906
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,759
It's sexist, it's outrageous,

907
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,628
It's offensive,
it's in your face

908
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:20,098
And misogynistic, and
it's directed by a woman!

909
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,400
Humanoids From The Deep.

910
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,268
Which is this kind of fun
ripoff

911
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,003
Of Creature
from the Black Lagoon.

912
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:30,742
Imagine if Alien, Piranha,
Creature from the Black Lagoon

913
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:33,579
Got together and then got horny,

914
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:35,647
Because that's
just what the movie is.

915
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,916
Takes place in
this East Coast upstate

916
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,951
Little small
sleepy fishing town

917
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,053
And they're starting to
have a shortage of salmon.

918
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:44,222
Of course this scientists
decide,

919
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,657
"What's a way we can figure out"

920
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:48,894
"To make the salmon more,
bigger, better?"

921
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,897
They start genetically
engineering these little fish.

922
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,098
Little did they know,
when they tried

923
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:55,066
To put this fish
in the ocean to grow

924
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,835
That they would
become a tasty treat

925
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:58,737
For other creatures in the deep.

926
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,205
Kind of
doesn't even make sense.

927
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:03,174
They also didn't know
that these little tasty treats

928
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,844
Must have tasted like some kind
of bacon,

929
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,146
Cheddar flavored pretzel

930
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,348
Because no female would
partake in this snack,

931
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:12,884
Only the male species
would eat this.

932
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,986
When you try to mess
with the fish population

933
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,889
Anybody whoever flunked sixth
grade science knows,

934
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,025
Fish like creatures from
the ocean

935
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,760
Sort of wash up on shore

936
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:23,328
And start raping women.

937
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,732
The violence is crazy,
the monsters are magnificent,

938
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:30,001
Giant beautifully designed
monsters by Rob Bottin,

939
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,337
Who did Total Recall and
designed Robocop.

940
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,073
They've got this Groucho Marx
walk and they got their -

941
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,975
Their really horrible sound
they make.

942
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,144
You know it's a rubber
suit - yeah it's pretty cool,

943
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,612
It's kind of creepy.

944
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:43,515
Much better than any CGI stuff
that you could see right now.

945
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:47,619
They look slimy and
real, and gross, and wet.

946
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:50,789
They're just like yeah,
you know that there's men

947
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,558
With costumes on them whatever

948
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:56,862
But for more than a few
minutes you believe it.

949
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,231
They're not human
but they want human women.

950
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:02,801
Not for killing, for mating!

951
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:06,204
(Creature roaring)

952
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,840
There's a scene where a
woman is attacked in a tent

953
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:10,642
And she's having sex
with a ventriloquist.

954
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:13,479
The guy who operates
Chuck Wood in Las Vegas.

955
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:16,615
They slash him to pieces
and before they can attack,

956
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,017
They molest her,
she runs out of the tent

957
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,452
And you'll notice
she's suddenly played by

958
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:22,120
A red head with breast size

959
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:24,690
About three sizes bigger
than the woman in the tent!

960
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:26,324
It's like the most fortuitous
nude scene

961
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,760
For no apparent reason
and it's great.

962
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:31,797
Humanoids From The Deep
is a Roger Corman movie.

963
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,332
Mr. Corman is legendary
in the movie business

964
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:37,002
For producing
super low budget movies

965
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,237
That showed tremendous returns.

966
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,674
Roger Corman, the king of low
budget films and making them

967
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:46,778
Huge was able to put together
this film with a low budget,

968
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:49,548
Making it look like it
was a big budget film.

969
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,350
The best horror films punch
you right in the comfort zone

970
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,119
And this one messes
with your head.

971
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,587
It's Creature from
the Black Lagoon

972
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,455
With modern day sex
and violence.

973
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,258
It's scary, it's creepy,
the monsters are brilliant.

974
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,227
First 20 minutes,
it wastes a kid,

975
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,696
Kills dogs,
raping women on the beach.

976
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:08,900
It's just an outrageously,
unbelievably,

977
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:11,002
Shocking, schlocky,

978
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:13,839
Great horror movie that I
absolutely love

979
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:16,007
And heartily recommend.

980
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,776
(Woman screaming)

981
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,277
(Horror music)

982
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:24,550
You are watching 50 Best
Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

983
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:27,986
A countdown
of horror's hidden gems.

984
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:31,923
Coming in at number 35, Hatchet.

985
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,391
This movie is great.

986
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,526
I love this movie.

987
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,261
I've told so many people
about it.

988
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,363
I'm a child of the
Friday the 13th generation.

989
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,898
I grew up on all those movies

990
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,634
And to me Hatchet
perfectly encapsulates

991
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:44,636
What I love about
Friday the 13ths.

992
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,238
If you want kills,
you got to see Hatchet.

993
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:48,574
In the past few years,

994
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:51,009
Horror have been taken over
by PG 13 movies,

995
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:54,946
Remakes, sequels, reboots,
re-imaginings, all that stuff.

996
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,716
Hatchet comes out and
Adam Green and his crew

997
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:00,619
Deliver this kick ass
slasher movie.

998
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:03,622
Hatchet is basically the
equivalent of a campfire story.

999
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:04,990
It kind of creates
this mythology

1000
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,626
Around a killer
named Victor Crowley.

1001
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:09,561
A group of characters
go into the woods

1002
00:42:09,595 --> 00:42:11,663
For this haunted swamp tour

1003
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,164
And their boat
gets kind of capsized

1004
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,733
And they're stuck there.

1005
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:19,571
They're trying to escape while
this elephant man like killer

1006
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:23,174
Is threatening to tear them
apart limb from limb literally.

1007
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,910
Kane Hodder is probably the
most famous guy

1008
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,311
That ever played Jason.

1009
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:30,281
He's the only one that came
back to play more than one film.

1010
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:32,317
This was a new icon
for him to play,

1011
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,519
I mean Victor Crowley
is every bit as strong

1012
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,487
And ridiculously inventive

1013
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:38,690
With farming implements
as Jason was.

1014
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:43,695
Adam Green wanted to
stick with the old school horror

1015
00:42:43,729 --> 00:42:45,631
And have blood spray

1016
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:48,133
And people getting
their heads ripped in half

1017
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,702
And crazy monster people,
and it's all practical.

1018
00:42:50,736 --> 00:42:54,472
Practical meaning, no
computer generated effects.

1019
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,542
Modern horror movies are filled
with computer touch ups

1020
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,077
But not Hatchet.

1021
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,446
If you are just into old school,
brutal,

1022
00:43:01,479 --> 00:43:03,749
Viscous, nasty, slasher kills

1023
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:06,517
Hatchet provides,
I think really probably

1024
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:08,620
One of my favorite
slasher movie kills

1025
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,521
In the history
of slasher movies.

1026
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:11,723
I don't even want to know -

1027
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13,324
I don't even want
to give it away really

1028
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,797
But let me just say it
involves twisting someones head

1029
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,701
In various ways, where their jaw
sort of comes off of their head.

1030
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:24,636
I mean it's pretty brilliant.

1031
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:25,937
You got a head getting
ripped off,

1032
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,506
You have arms being
completely ripped off.

1033
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,542
There's like tendons that
are just like stretched

1034
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:34,880
And you have tons of blood
spurting.

1035
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:37,749
Obviously hatchets involved.

1036
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:41,953
It is gory as -
in the greatest ways possible.

1037
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:44,122
Now this is an actual prop
from the movie Hatchet.

1038
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,557
I was a big supporter of
the movie when it came out

1039
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:49,527
And I got a couple
of thank you's

1040
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,162
From Adam Green the director.

1041
00:43:51,196 --> 00:43:52,831
This was one of them,
so it's been on my wall,

1042
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:57,068
I took it down for this
but so I have the hatchet.

1043
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,137
Secret is I think he
made about 20 of these

1044
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,872
Because I know a couple of
other like friends of mine

1045
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:02,874
That have the exact same one.

1046
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:05,176
It's not a remake,
it's not a sequel,

1047
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,812
It's not based on
a Japanese one.

1048
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,013
Definitely the type of thing

1049
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:09,414
That you should check
out with your friends

1050
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,282
And just have a good time
and not take too seriously

1051
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:14,052
Because it's a really fun
audience movie.

1052
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,354
(Man screaming)

1053
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:20,591
80s horror fans unite,
let there be Hatchet!

1054
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,961
If creepy and quirky
get you going,

1055
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:26,898
Check out our movie
at number 34, May.

1056
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:29,634
May is the perfect
film that encapsulates

1057
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,237
What it's like to be the
loner or the outsider.

1058
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:35,974
May is this amazing horror
movie, directed by Lucky McKee

1059
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,409
About a girl who essentially
goes from being

1060
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:40,078
Just kind of a weird girl

1061
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:45,751
Who has a fake eye, and
her only friend is a doll

1062
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:47,886
To becoming a complete
psychopath.

1063
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:50,756
The whole idea is that she
likes certain parts of people.

1064
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:53,124
What she's doing is taking
pieces from people in her life

1065
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:54,993
And putting them together
and it's kind of -

1066
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,295
In some twisted way a bit
of a Frankenstein story.

1067
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:59,865
She has a crush on this guy
and she really likes his hands

1068
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:02,167
Or she meets this guy and
she really loves his arms

1069
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,736
Because he has a cool tattoo.

1070
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:07,405
She has this doll that breaks

1071
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,307
And she kind of goes insane
after that

1072
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,209
And decides to take all this
favorite parts

1073
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:12,510
And sew them together,

1074
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,545
As any normal girl would.

1075
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:18,283
And makes her own
special best friend.

1076
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:21,719
Typically in horror films,
you see the damsel in distress,

1077
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:24,756
The scream queen who as a guy
we can almost safely sit back

1078
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,624
And watch a hot girl screaming,

1079
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,693
Yelling ultimately
get axed to death.

1080
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,628
It's a little bit less frequent

1081
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,697
When you say that the males
are the victims.

1082
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,732
Angela Bettis portrays May

1083
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:37,668
In a very awkward
yet sympathetic way.

1084
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:39,771
She's essentially this girl that
doesn't really have a connection

1085
00:45:39,805 --> 00:45:41,139
With other human beings

1086
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:46,011
And kind of has a crush on
the Jeremy Sisto character.

1087
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:48,413
Some people
think it's kind of gross.

1088
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,581
I love gross.

1089
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:52,417
Really?

1090
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,086
Disgust me, please.

1091
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,354
(Female giggles)

1092
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:57,989
I think one of the
most amazing things about May

1093
00:45:58,023 --> 00:46:02,227
Is that you identify with this
girl who's about to cut up

1094
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,929
Her ex-girlfriend
and her ex-boyfriend

1095
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:06,031
And all of these people
would make a fake person.

1096
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:07,933
And I think that's amazing

1097
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:10,268
That you start to identify with
her because you feel bad for her

1098
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:11,636
And you feel bad because
people are mean to her

1099
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:14,572
And they think she's weird
and you want her

1100
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,807
To be able to find a friend

1101
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:18,409
Even if it's a weird
Frankenstein friend.

1102
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,012
The ending of May will
definitely leave you

1103
00:46:21,046 --> 00:46:23,882
With a feeling that you need to
take a shower immediately.

1104
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:25,650
It's one of the most
bizarre, uncomfortable,

1105
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:28,119
Creepy films I've ever seen.

1106
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:30,488
It's just sort of a girl
search for her best friend,

1107
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,224
Just kind of sad.

1108
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:36,962
(Lyrics)
Do you love me now

1109
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:40,431
A movie about a nut job
making a Frankenstein friend?

1110
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:43,468
What else do you need for
a night of horrific fun?

1111
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:46,537
Now for a a little obscure
vampire movie

1112
00:46:46,571 --> 00:46:50,508
At number 33, Lemora.

1113
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:54,612
Lemora, a child's
tale of the supernatural.

1114
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,647
Basically a - fairy tale.

1115
00:46:56,681 --> 00:46:58,516
It's about this young girl,

1116
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:02,954
Really on the burgeoning
edge of womanhood.

1117
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:07,792
She is roped into the clutches

1118
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,462
Of this witchy vampire named
Lemora.

1119
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,932
Who uses the girl's
gangster father

1120
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:17,068
As bait to lure her
into the forest.

1121
00:47:17,102 --> 00:47:21,806
Where she would like to
have her as a companion.

1122
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,042
The mirror is broken.

1123
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:28,246
You can see how lovely
you are in my eyes.

1124
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:29,614
Look.

1125
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:32,117
(Horror music)

1126
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,552
You'll feel
the lesbian instincts

1127
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,921
More than they're showing

1128
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,656
Which makes it weird and hot
and dark and interesting.

1129
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,726
This movie would be
on my list of top 50 to see

1130
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:45,696
Because A, it's so
beautiful just to look at.

1131
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,833
B, it's got
the lesbian vampire angle

1132
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,970
And if you're like me, there's
nothing wrong with that.

1133
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,639
C, it's just creepy as hell

1134
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:57,775
And it's got some
of the best vampire kills

1135
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:01,312
Back when vampires were
actually evil and cool,

1136
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:02,981
And they did bite people,

1137
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:04,482
And they did want
to have sex with them

1138
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:05,984
And they didn't sparkle.

1139
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,852
You never really
hear Lemora mentioned.

1140
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,621
I think Elvira probably
gave its widest audience

1141
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,158
When she put on video and DVD.

1142
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:16,294
It's amazing, it's
beautiful, it's creepy,

1143
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:18,829
It's got the lesbian
vampire angle.

1144
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:20,598
I mean what's not to like?

1145
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,068
(Horror music)

1146
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:26,504
Creepy and sublime,
Lemora will bite into you

1147
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:27,939
And won't let go.

1148
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:30,408
Looking for more
blood sucking fun?

1149
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:32,410
Check out The Brides of Dracula.

1150
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:35,913
Our hidden gem at number 32.

1151
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:38,183
I love Hammer movies

1152
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:41,186
Because they're
always so gothic

1153
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:45,756
And they take place in the
Transylvanian countryside.

1154
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:49,460
They have the most beautiful
actresses in them, always.

1155
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:51,229
This one has no exception.

1156
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:54,832
Brides of Dracula is sort
of the red headed step child

1157
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,667
Of all the Hammer Dracula
movies.

1158
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:59,837
Probably because it's the
only Dracula movie they made

1159
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,672
Without camp Dracula.

1160
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:05,043
Peter Cushing is back thank
goodness, playing Van Helsing.

1161
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:08,479
But in this one you
have a creepy old estate

1162
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:11,882
And of course this
beautiful young French woman

1163
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:15,253
Who is traveling by
herself to the countryside

1164
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,989
To go be a teacher
to girls school

1165
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:20,958
Is intercepted and brought
to this castle.

1166
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:23,861
And there is a young master
of his estate

1167
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,596
Who's been chained up for years

1168
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,499
Because he's a vampire.

1169
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:34,772
She - silly little thing -
she let's the vampire go.

1170
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,973
You fool, you don't
know what you've done,

1171
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:37,342
You don't know what you've done!

1172
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:38,476
(Horror music)

1173
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:40,878
But in the nick of time
Van Helsing is there

1174
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,914
To save the day, huzzah!

1175
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:46,817
You might be noticing that not
only is Dracula

1176
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:48,119
Not in this movie

1177
00:49:48,153 --> 00:49:50,888
But neither are his brides,
we'll explain.

1178
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,523
Producers, I think over
the years

1179
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:54,125
Have learned and failed

1180
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,727
And learned again,
what sells a movie.

1181
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:59,230
If they put Dracula in the
title, audiences will go.

1182
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:00,865
What audiences
are really drawn to

1183
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:02,833
Are the characters
or the actors.

1184
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:07,038
It's more about this one
guy who sort of has a harem

1185
00:50:07,072 --> 00:50:10,241
Which is where the brides
of Dracula comes from.

1186
00:50:10,275 --> 00:50:13,878
His got this posse of hot chicks
that his turned into vampires.

1187
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:17,382
David Peel who
plays Baron Meinster,

1188
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:21,119
Somehow seems
to out camp Peter Cushing.

1189
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,754
I don't know how he does it
but when he finally emerges

1190
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:26,457
With his purple cape
and his bouffant hair

1191
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:30,195
His sort of the Gary Glitter
of Dracula.

1192
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:33,998
I think sometimes you just want
to have glamour Hammer.

1193
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:38,203
(Horror music)

1194
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:40,938
Bouffant hair,
countryside blood lust,

1195
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:44,375
And gothic mansions?
Horror heaven!

1196
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:50,215
Coming in at number 31 is
the hair raising Exorcist 3.

1197
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:53,184
Exorcist 3 was really
a welcome movie for me

1198
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:56,954
Because it made up for the
awful stench of Exorcist 2.

1199
00:50:56,987 --> 00:51:01,692
Exorcist 3 with George C. Scott
and Brad Dourif and Jason Miller

1200
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,761
It's certainly
a much worldlier sequel

1201
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,431
To the exorcist
than the Heretic was.

1202
00:51:06,464 --> 00:51:08,032
When this movie came out, I
don't think a lot of people

1203
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,567
Knew it to make of it because I
think they expected

1204
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,636
More of like the first Exorcist.

1205
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:14,139
A girl with the crucifix
doing stuff to herself

1206
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:15,706
And projectile vomiting.

1207
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,908
This movie's actually more
of a psychological thriller.

1208
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:20,145
Brad Dourif plays
the original killer

1209
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:24,182
Who has kind of been hiding out
in the body of Father Karras

1210
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:28,686
Who has gone unnamed for
the last 15, 17 years,

1211
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,356
However long it had been
since the original film.

1212
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:34,459
The priest from the first film,
he's locked away and he's crazy.

1213
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:36,194
He's actually possessed.

1214
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:39,029
(Doors & windows shutting)

1215
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:42,500
Did you think to save
your friend the priest?

1216
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:45,069
When you think about
sequels that get three's

1217
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:50,175
Like Jaws 3 or Friday the
13th 3, or whatever 3 - ehh.

1218
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:52,109
But this one's actually
pretty intelligent.

1219
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:54,379
One thing that people
overlook about the Exorcist 3

1220
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:57,081
Is that it's got a really
great sense of humor.

1221
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,417
Father Dyer says,
"Jesus loves you,"

1222
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,319
"Everyone else thinks
you're an asshole."

1223
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:03,921
The Exorcist 3
is highly overlooked

1224
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,756
And people do need
to check it out.

1225
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:10,461
It's a very moody,
slow burn kind of film

1226
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:15,500
And has some of the creepiest
nurses known to man.

1227
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:19,504
It has a very powerful
atmosphere that stays with you.

1228
00:52:19,537 --> 00:52:24,041
It also has one of the
all time greatest scares,

1229
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,310
In any movie ever.

1230
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:27,912
One of the best shock
scenes that I have ever seen

1231
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,247
In a movie in my life.

1232
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,583
Probably one of the
best scares in horror ever.

1233
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:36,421
That moment with the music,
everything just freaks you out.

1234
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:38,055
Man did that audience
scream their heads off

1235
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:40,090
And I was just as loud as
anybody else.

1236
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:41,659
It's one of those scenes where
you have to check

1237
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,694
The mirror afterwards to see if
your hair has gone white

1238
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:46,197
Because it is so frightening
when it happens.

1239
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:48,433
It is absolutely insane.

1240
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:49,867
You see that in the theater,
remember seeing in the theater

1241
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,402
At the summer of 1990.

1242
00:52:51,436 --> 00:52:53,070
The entire theater jumped and
it's very rare

1243
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:55,506
You see that
in a movie theater anymore.

1244
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,575
If you think we're going to
show you the scene,

1245
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:58,909
You're crazy!

1246
00:52:58,943 --> 00:53:02,780
Stop the DVR, rent the movie
now and thank us later.

1247
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,749
(People screaming)

1248
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:11,689
You are watching 50 Best Horror
Movies You've Never Seen.

1249
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:14,992
A countdown of
horror's hidden gems.

1250
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:21,666
Up next at number 30 is the
terrifying Burnt Offerings.

1251
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:25,703
Burnt Offerings is that
haunted house horror film

1252
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:29,340
That came in the 70s before
the Amityville Horror.

1253
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:30,841
Burnt Offerings,

1254
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:35,813
That movie has a plethora of
scenery chewers to enjoy.

1255
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:38,549
Oliver Reed, Burgess Meredith,

1256
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:41,352
And of course the great diva
throw down,

1257
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:44,689
Karen Black and Bette Davis.

1258
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,591
Come on, you have to see this!

1259
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:48,493
This family, they're sick of
being cooped up

1260
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:49,927
In their city apartment

1261
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,897
And they want to go out and
spend the summer in the country.

1262
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,400
They find this house that's
just too good to be true.

1263
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:58,869
It's this huge mansion,
just beautiful grounds.

1264
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,271
These people move
in to this house

1265
00:54:00,305 --> 00:54:02,307
And it's of course owned
by Burgess Meredith

1266
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:05,009
Who else would own the house
other than Burgess Meredith?

1267
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:08,513
Oh I like them, Roz,
I like them.

1268
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:10,648
Don't rent a house
from Burgess Meredith

1269
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:12,583
That just should be a
general rule in horror.

1270
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:14,018
Don't ever do that.

1271
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:17,655
He can train you as a boxer but
do not rent a house from him.

1272
00:54:17,688 --> 00:54:22,327
Brother and sister are
renting it to them for a steel

1273
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:27,131
With the only catch being that
there's an 85 year old woman

1274
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:29,700
Who will be living up stairs
in her room

1275
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:32,303
And only needs a tray
brought to her,

1276
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:34,204
Three times a day with food.

1277
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:36,474
Awesome, awesome!

1278
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:37,908
When they move in to
the home the plants are dead,

1279
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,844
The wallpaper is peeling,
the house

1280
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:41,746
Is kind of cracking
and falling apart.

1281
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:46,984
And things start to get a little
crazy as the summer goes on.

1282
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,119
Karen Black is getting
a little freaky

1283
00:54:49,153 --> 00:54:51,556
About keeping
the silver polished.

1284
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,391
Bette Davis, as Aunt Elizabeth,

1285
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:55,025
She's getting tired
all the time.

1286
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,161
All she wants to do is sleep.

1287
00:54:57,194 --> 00:55:00,064
All of the sudden the
house that's been dilapidated

1288
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:03,033
And it's pretty old, whatever,
starts repairing itself.

1289
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:05,870
It becomes more colorful,
the plants come back to life

1290
00:55:05,903 --> 00:55:07,538
And yet the characters within
the film

1291
00:55:07,572 --> 00:55:09,740
Are all slowly deteriorating.

1292
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:11,476
When someone dies
or gets sick

1293
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:13,210
The house regenerates itself.

1294
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:15,079
It regenerates itself
and gets more beautiful

1295
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:18,082
But it requires death
and sickness to do so.

1296
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:20,485
It seems like the house
is kind of trying to kill them.

1297
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:23,554
When I saw it at 7 years old,
it literally destroyed me,

1298
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:24,989
Gave me nightmares.

1299
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:28,559
A little boy is the only one to
kind of notice what's going on

1300
00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:31,662
And he's attacked by his
father in the swimming pool.

1301
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:35,800
The concept that your own
father would try to kill you,

1302
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,936
Especially to a young
child was traumatic for me.

1303
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:41,606
Although Burnt Offerings
received mixed reviews,

1304
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,909
The film won three
industry awards in 1977,

1305
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:48,846
Including best director,
best actor, and best actress.

1306
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:50,781
It's one of those movies that is
not afraid

1307
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:52,517
To be unrelentingly grim.

1308
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,152
There's this great running
bit

1309
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,855
Of this evil looking chauffeur

1310
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:00,491
That keeps smiling
with his sunglasses

1311
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:03,528
And Oliver Reed has a nightmare
about it from when he was a kid.

1312
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:06,431
This chauffeur keeps coming up
the entire time,

1313
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:08,332
It's really a creepy image.

1314
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,867
It remains one of those movies

1315
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,102
That kind of affects you
mentally

1316
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:14,271
In some way
that you can never shake.

1317
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,206
30 years after seeing it
originally,

1318
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,076
It still just makes me
nervous when I watch it.

1319
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:23,681
(Horror music)

1320
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:25,282
A murderous mansion!

1321
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,585
Have you ever heard
of such a thing?

1322
00:56:27,618 --> 00:56:32,890
At number 29
is the terrifying Funhouse.

1323
00:56:32,923 --> 00:56:37,127
The year 1981 had I think
more horror films

1324
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:39,430
Released on record
than any other year.

1325
00:56:39,464 --> 00:56:42,733
Every week there was an
American Werewolf in London,

1326
00:56:42,767 --> 00:56:45,302
A Happy Birthday To Me,
A Deadly Blessing,

1327
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:48,138
And the Funhouse was right in
the middle of all of that stuff.

1328
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:49,974
Funhouse was directed
by Tobe Hooper

1329
00:56:50,007 --> 00:56:51,842
Who did the
Texas Chainsaw Massacre,

1330
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:54,411
One of the greatest
horror films ever made.

1331
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:56,647
First of all Funhouse is a
great place to set a horror film

1332
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:59,517
But you add this people
that run the Funhouse

1333
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,552
And their demented, depraved,

1334
00:57:01,586 --> 00:57:04,622
Crazed son who's
like 8 feet tall

1335
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:06,156
And wears a Frankenstein mask.

1336
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,592
You haven't seen anything

1337
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:10,260
Until you've seen Tobe
Hooper's The Funhouse.

1338
00:57:10,294 --> 00:57:14,264
It takes these kids who go to
the sort of ramshackle carnival

1339
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:16,767
And go into the Funhouse
and find out

1340
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:19,470
That it's not as much
fun as they had hoped.

1341
00:57:19,504 --> 00:57:22,773
The killer is sort of almost
like Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,

1342
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:25,042
Where he's abused by his father.

1343
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:27,444
He's not sort of this
creature that hides

1344
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:29,179
In the shadows
that you don't see,

1345
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:31,215
You kind of feel
some sympathy for him.

1346
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:33,050
At one point
he takes the mask off

1347
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:36,887
And you get this weird
vampire mouse creature,

1348
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:38,856
With his vampire teeth
that's like -

1349
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:41,158
(Creature screaming)

1350
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,060
That is not at all what I
expected under the mask,

1351
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:49,867
A white haired vampire toothed,
mouse alien, albino creature?

1352
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,168
It's a great scene.

1353
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,237
This hulking creature is like
stalking

1354
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,105
This poor teenagers
in this Funhouse

1355
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:57,575
And at one point, she kind
of huddled against the fan

1356
00:57:57,608 --> 00:57:58,909
And it's rotating behind her.

1357
00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:01,011
He's kind of like "Oh
there's a hot chick,"

1358
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:03,781
And he wants to touch her
and he's kind of like,

1359
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:05,282
"Hey may I touch you?"

1360
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,284
A deformed guy who wants
to have sex!

1361
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,819
It's really unnerving!

1362
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:11,689
The actor who portrays
him does a fantastic job

1363
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:13,958
Of just having like
pathos in his eyes

1364
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:17,628
And you can really relate to him
and yet still be scared of him.

1365
00:58:17,662 --> 00:58:19,664
(Creature screaming)

1366
00:58:19,697 --> 00:58:23,367
The next time you go to
a carnival or a circus

1367
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,870
You will definitely be
thinking of the Funhouse.

1368
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:28,806
Especially if you're on one of
those little rides and the cart

1369
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,775
"Oh my god," scary!

1370
00:58:30,808 --> 00:58:35,179
(Horror music)

1371
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:36,313
How can you resist?

1372
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,649
Pick up a copy
of The Funhouse today.

1373
00:58:38,683 --> 00:58:40,184
Coming in at number 28

1374
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:44,254
Is a film that might surprise
you, Halloween 3.

1375
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:47,324
Halloween 3 is not like
the other Halloween movies.

1376
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,059
There's no Michael Myers
in Halloween 3.

1377
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:51,028
Where the - is Michael Myers?

1378
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:54,832
Once you get passed that
and you kind of realize

1379
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:58,268
That it's still a solid
little film and it is scary.

1380
00:58:58,302 --> 00:59:01,205
New film, horror film,
John Carpenter, Michael Myers

1381
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:04,274
And you pop the tape in and
your like "Yeah, here we go!"

1382
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:06,310
And then you got all these kids

1383
00:59:06,343 --> 00:59:07,845
With bugs coming
out of their mask.

1384
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,247
And you're like, "All right,
where's Michael Myers?"

1385
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,649
"Hello?"

1386
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:13,818
People dump on that because
it wasn't really

1387
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:15,620
A Michael Myers movie

1388
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:18,055
But to me I think it's
all the better for that,

1389
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:20,557
It stands out for doing
something different.

1390
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:21,959
John Carpenter decided

1391
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,393
It wasn't going to be like the
other Halloween scene.

1392
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:25,495
He wanted to branch off from
the whole Michael Myers story

1393
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:26,931
And then make each
Halloween movie

1394
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:28,565
A new plot as things went on

1395
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:30,100
With new bad guys
and new killers.

1396
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:32,436
Almost turned it into
a horror anthology series

1397
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:36,173
Wherever that releases new
creepy film titled Halloween.

1398
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:40,044
Halloween 3 happens
to be about a mask factory

1399
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,547
Which they're selling masks that
will kill people on Halloween

1400
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,949
Specifically children.

1401
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:47,752
You just have this really
cool, weird plot with this guy

1402
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,553
That's essentially a horror
movie version

1403
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,088
Of a James Bond villain.

1404
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:52,222
Trying to take
over the world

1405
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,258
But he's doing it
with killer masks

1406
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,926
And he wants to kill
all the children.

1407
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,562
A television commercial
played on Halloween night

1408
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,365
Is what gives the masks
their destructive power.

1409
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:03,668
At 9:00 you're
supposed to gather around

1410
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,670
And put on your
silver shamrock mask

1411
01:00:05,703 --> 01:00:07,171
And watch a special presentation

1412
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:08,673
Which is a doomsday device.

1413
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:10,841
Which is going to trigger
a piece on your neck

1414
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:13,143
That is going to make slugs
and snakes and spiders

1415
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,645
Crawl into your head
and kill you.

1416
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:16,814
You are going to be hearing
the silver shamrock jingle

1417
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:19,149
Over and over again during
the course of the movie.

1418
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:23,420
Da-da-da-da-da-da six more days
'til Halloween, Halloween.

1419
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,990
Five more days
'til Halloween, Halloween.

1420
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:28,592
Three more days
to Halloween, Halloween.

1421
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,328
Two more days to
Halloween, Halloween.

1422
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:35,499
One more day to
Halloween, Silver Shamrock.

1423
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:37,201
(Lyrics) It's four days to
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween.

1424
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:38,669
Turn that down!

1425
01:00:38,703 --> 01:00:40,537
You will not get this thing
out of your head

1426
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,372
For years to come,
trust me.

1427
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:43,974
There's a scene about
an hour in to the movie

1428
01:00:44,008 --> 01:00:47,244
Where a kid and his family
sort of test out the masks

1429
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,714
And you see exactly what these
masks can do

1430
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:50,981
Which is pretty impressive.

1431
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:54,018
Somehow the beam from the
TV will melt your head

1432
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:56,420
And snakes and other
insects will come out of it.

1433
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:58,856
It's just so mean spirited and
yet funny.

1434
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:01,692
It's the key moment I think
what makes this movie so odd,

1435
01:01:01,726 --> 01:01:03,260
And yet so great.

1436
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:06,096
My favorite element of
the film was Dan O'Herlihy

1437
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,533
As Conal Cochran,
sort of Mr. Halloween,

1438
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:11,101
Sort of a great Boogeyman.

1439
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:13,804
Dan O'Herlihy is probably
one of the best horror villains

1440
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:15,505
You could ever hope for.

1441
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:19,476
Halloween.

1442
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,746
The festival of Samhain,

1443
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:24,481
The last great one
to place 3,000 years ago

1444
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,616
When the hills ran red.

1445
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,152
If you want your Halloween fix

1446
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:31,088
But are totally tired
of Michael Myers,

1447
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:34,358
Check out Halloween 3,
Season of the Witch.

1448
01:01:34,391 --> 01:01:36,493
When you go back
and look at Halloween 3,

1449
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,262
It's a brilliant
little horror movie.

1450
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:40,130
I really think
that of all the sequels

1451
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:42,166
Halloween 3 has the most
Halloween spirit.

1452
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:45,002
Happy Halloween.

1453
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:48,839
Nothing says Halloween spirit
like an insane mask maker.

1454
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:54,644
Up next at number 27, a sweet
revenge story called Hard Candy.

1455
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,847
Hard Candy, that blew me away.

1456
01:01:56,881 --> 01:01:59,049
I thought that was
a really fine film.

1457
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:01,651
Hard Candy is essentially
about an internet predator

1458
01:02:01,685 --> 01:02:04,922
That finally meets his match in
a 14 year old,

1459
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:07,724
Sadistic, preteen girl.

1460
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:11,796
This young girl played by
Ellen Page meets this older guy,

1461
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:15,399
Played by Patrick Wilson for the
first time in this coffee shop

1462
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:18,502
And they end up back at
Patrick Wilson's house

1463
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:21,171
Which is very, very
inappropriate

1464
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:24,141
Because she's like a young
adolescent girl

1465
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:26,076
Going to this like full grown
man's house.

1466
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:29,146
Like he's just so
slimy and charming and you do

1467
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:34,184
Like you want to hurt him in
the manliest way possible.

1468
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:37,221
What man would want
to meet a 14 year old girl

1469
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,323
If he didn't have anything
but bad intentions.

1470
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:42,292
So I guess she's going
to teach him a lesson

1471
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:43,928
And that she does.

1472
01:02:43,961 --> 01:02:46,130
It's a role reversal movie.

1473
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:47,832
He's the fly
and she's the spider

1474
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:50,167
And she's just drawing him
into her web.

1475
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,535
She's there for vengeance,

1476
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:53,737
Like she is in no way
vulnerable.

1477
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,907
She is the bad ass
in this relationship.

1478
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:58,775
She is the one
that's in control.

1479
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:01,912
The great thing about this
movie is its unpredictability.

1480
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:03,647
Every time you think
Patrick Wilson's

1481
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,582
Going to get the upper hand,

1482
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:09,186
She turns the tables on
him every single time.

1483
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:11,588
I've talked to a
lot of guys who walked out

1484
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:15,225
Because a particular scene in
which Ellen Page

1485
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:17,761
Is snipping off the balls

1486
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,529
Of the male character.

1487
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:27,204
She definitely holds his future
in her hands. (Laughing)

1488
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:30,207
You're like watching the scene
and slinking back in your seat

1489
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,209
A little bit more, a little
bit more, a little bit more.

1490
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:34,478
The whole time you're
just like "No, no she's not,"

1491
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:35,880
"No she's not, no she's not!"

1492
01:03:35,913 --> 01:03:42,519
Please! Please!!!!!

1493
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:44,955
I love that scene so much.

1494
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:47,157
Damn right, that's
right, that's what you get,

1495
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:51,761
Now talk in a high voice
for the rest of your life.

1496
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:53,730
Ellen Page really,
I must say pulled

1497
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,732
A real rabbit out of her hat

1498
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:56,934
With that performance.

1499
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:58,102
For a girl,
it's supposed to be playing

1500
01:03:58,135 --> 01:04:00,270
A sadistic 14 year old.

1501
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:02,907
It's really creepy
and impressive.

1502
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:05,575
She's so one thing
at the beginning

1503
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:09,079
And is so different
later in the film

1504
01:04:09,113 --> 01:04:10,380
And it's almost hard
to believe

1505
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:12,883
The same actress
was playing that,

1506
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:14,018
That one role.

1507
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:16,353
Super scary,
Ellen Page is crazy

1508
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:18,755
And you totally identify
with this super crazy girl

1509
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:21,791
Who is tazing this guy
in the shower

1510
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:23,560
And snipping his balls off.

1511
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:25,529
It's one of the most fascinating

1512
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:28,065
And interesting character
horror movies you'll ever see.

1513
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:29,366
Like I think
it takes the horror genre

1514
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:30,734
And kind of flips
it in a lot of ways.

1515
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:34,238
You could almost see that
being a two character play.

1516
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:36,840
Yeah, a couple other
characters come into it briefly

1517
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:41,078
But it has that kind
of unity and intensity.

1518
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:44,214
You don't get off that easy,
Jeff.

1519
01:04:44,248 --> 01:04:47,517
Revenge never tasted
this good as Hard Candy.

1520
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:51,655
Next up, an Italian castle
with a very unwanted guest.

1521
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:55,392
At number 26, Castle Freak.

1522
01:04:55,425 --> 01:04:57,827
Castle Freak was,
not a lot of people know,

1523
01:04:57,861 --> 01:05:00,130
But it was actually based on an
H.P. Lovecraft story

1524
01:05:00,164 --> 01:05:01,331
Called The Outsider.

1525
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:03,800
This is a movie that
scared the shit out of me

1526
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:05,569
When I was like 18.

1527
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:08,005
Jeffrey Combs and
Barbara Crampton as this couple

1528
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:10,474
Who inherit
an old castle in Italy,

1529
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:13,577
Which turns out to have this
hideous monster in the basement.

1530
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,412
They get to the castle,
everything's great honey,

1531
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:18,015
We love it here
but there's a freak.

1532
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:20,985
The monster is actually
this fellow named Giorgio

1533
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:23,887
Who had been chained
up there since a child.

1534
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,092
And sort of has become this
ghoulish creature

1535
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,359
From lack of sunlight

1536
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:30,995
And being beaten with
a cat and nine tails

1537
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:32,997
By his psychotic mother,

1538
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,698
And fed horrible things.

1539
01:05:34,731 --> 01:05:36,566
He's only ever
like lived chained

1540
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,069
In a basement of this old
Italian castle.

1541
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:41,271
Then on day his chain breaks and
he terrorizes the people

1542
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,740
That had moved in the castle
and their blind daughter.

1543
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,875
I remember I was watching this
with a boyfriend at that time

1544
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:46,943
And I was like
"Oh my god, this movie's

1545
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:48,812
Actually really terrifying."

1546
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:53,283
(Woman screaming)

1547
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:55,485
Then after the movie was over
he started doing this thing

1548
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:57,254
Where every time he
looked at me he'd be like

1549
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:59,089
"Ha-yey ba-den."

1550
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:01,191
I was like, I'd be like
"Stop it, that's not funny!

1551
01:06:01,225 --> 01:06:02,226
It's not funny!"

1552
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:03,360
And I would like get really
upset.

1553
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:05,562
It is a fun
effective scary little film.

1554
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:07,097
There is an action figure
that exists

1555
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:09,233
And you can have your
own castle freak.

1556
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:11,868
Rip off nipples or do whatever
castle freak does,

1557
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:14,871
Eat cats and do all the things.

1558
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:18,075
Kids out there, get your
castle freak figure.

1559
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:19,309
What you see is what you get.

1560
01:06:19,343 --> 01:06:21,045
It's castle freak,
there's a castle,

1561
01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:22,912
There's a freak in the castle.

1562
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:24,381
It's scary.

1563
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:29,086
(Woman screaming)

1564
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:34,258
You are watching 50 Best
Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

1565
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:37,494
A countdown of horror's
hidden gems.

1566
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:43,200
Claiming the number 25 spot,
a fright fest called Feast.

1567
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:45,302
John Gulager's Feast
is one of the most

1568
01:06:45,335 --> 01:06:47,204
Splattery movies
you'll ever see.

1569
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:48,905
It's one of those
great creature features

1570
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:51,208
That has a really cool monster

1571
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:53,843
But at the same time it's got
a really great sense of humor.

1572
01:06:53,877 --> 01:06:55,812
Ben Affleck and Matt Damon
started this thing

1573
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,081
Called Project Greenlight

1574
01:06:57,114 --> 01:06:59,916
Where the TV show would detail
the production

1575
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:01,718
Of a low budget film

1576
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,820
And then at the end of the
season,

1577
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,155
The film would come out in
theaters.

1578
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:07,457
The first two time around,
the show was great,

1579
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:08,925
Movies kind of sucked.

1580
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,228
Feast comes out, the show
was great, the movie's great.

1581
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:14,030
Horror fans got to sit and
watch as they made a horror film

1582
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:15,031
From behind the scenes,
especially

1583
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:16,400
What's creative involved.

1584
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:19,369
For Dimension Films at that
time, it was really cool.

1585
01:07:19,403 --> 01:07:20,804
The fact that no one
really even saw the movie

1586
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:22,339
Has always been a big
disappointment for me.

1587
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:25,642
We designed Feast to kind of be
like old Peter Jackson movies

1588
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:29,012
Or old Sam Raimi movies where
they're really stylized,

1589
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,914
Really violent but really funny.

1590
01:07:30,947 --> 01:07:33,083
It's about a bunch of monsters
that attack

1591
01:07:33,117 --> 01:07:34,518
All this people in a bar.

1592
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,052
The bar in the middle
of nowhere.

1593
01:07:36,086 --> 01:07:38,388
And then the door kicks in and
there's this guy running in

1594
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:41,057
And his going like
"batten down the hatches"

1595
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:42,792
And his got something
in his hand.

1596
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:49,599
It's the head of one of these
guys, and it's been chopped off.

1597
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:52,369
And they're relentless,
and they swoop down on this bar

1598
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:55,539
And they break in and they start
attacking people left and right.

1599
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:58,007
They batten down
the hatches and stuff.

1600
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,277
Basically everybody knows,
don't stand by the window

1601
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,612
But you think, well maybe
this guy has it down.

1602
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:06,683
His got a shotgun and
he's going to save the day

1603
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:11,054
And his right in the middle
of saying something like

1604
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,822
"I'm going to save your ass."

1605
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:15,359
Then he gets ripped
out the window.

1606
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:19,263
I'm the guy that's
going to save your ass.

1607
01:08:19,296 --> 01:08:20,997
I don't even know how you
can describe

1608
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,666
The creatures in Feast.

1609
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:26,270
The creatures in Feast
are - they're horny.

1610
01:08:26,303 --> 01:08:28,071
The monsters have penises.

1611
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,207
The monsters in Feast
will - you and kill you

1612
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,808
And not always in that order.

1613
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,244
There's a big scene where the
monster's penis

1614
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:36,546
Gets stuck in the door and they
chop it off

1615
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,415
And
it bounces down the stairs

1616
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,984
And it's kind of almost,
seems like it's alive

1617
01:08:41,017 --> 01:08:44,221
And it gets squashed and it
squirts all over the camera.

1618
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:45,622
We wanted to go that extra step

1619
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:49,226
And have it be a little
unsavory.

1620
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:51,127
That approach worked
and the Feast

1621
01:08:51,161 --> 01:08:53,463
Franchise cranked up
two more sequels

1622
01:08:53,497 --> 01:08:56,700
That served up
the same unsavory fun.

1623
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:58,268
Jenny Wade in the Feast movies

1624
01:08:58,302 --> 01:09:00,237
Is sort of like
Ash from Evil Dead.

1625
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,838
Over the course
of the three films,

1626
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:03,973
She gets every
single bodily fluid

1627
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:07,177
Tossed, gunked, everything
you could possibly do

1628
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:08,978
To this poor woman
across three movies.

1629
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:10,947
Basically if it's a liquid
it gets splashed

1630
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,916
Across somebody's face.

1631
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:17,521
It's just wall to wall stuff
like that,

1632
01:09:17,554 --> 01:09:19,556
You'll never ever know exactly

1633
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:21,558
What will happen next in
a Feast movie.

1634
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:22,659
Any horror fan who's getting

1635
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:24,794
Into horror would love this
movie.

1636
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:27,063
To me it's like the
Evil Dead 2 of this generation.

1637
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,699
And they do the
same tricks all over again

1638
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:32,702
And surprise you all over
again in Feast 2 and 3.

1639
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:34,438
(Woman screaming)

1640
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:36,940
It's a Feast for the senses,
isn't it?

1641
01:09:36,973 --> 01:09:38,875
Rent this, now!

1642
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:41,578
And if you like a good dose
of humor with your horror,

1643
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:44,781
Try out Slither at number 24.

1644
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:48,618
And the award for best use of
an Air Supply song

1645
01:09:48,652 --> 01:09:53,189
In a horror movie
goes to: Slither!

1646
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:56,726
Slither is an awesome movie,
I will just say that right now.

1647
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,094
I love that movie.

1648
01:09:58,127 --> 01:09:59,996
The plot is, an alien
lands on earth,

1649
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,365
Wants to take over the world

1650
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:04,167
And kill everyone and eat
them, or impregnate them

1651
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,636
And the towns folk are just
trying to stop it

1652
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:08,605
From destroying
the entire world.

1653
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:10,507
Of course it happens
in a small town

1654
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,976
Because it always happens
in a small town.

1655
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:15,111
Grant who's played
by Michael Rooker

1656
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,047
Goes to investigate and
ends up being infected.

1657
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:20,049
He starts to mutate into a
creature.

1658
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,651
He goes on this meat lust

1659
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:23,052
Where he's like in the
supermarket

1660
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:27,591
Looking at stacks of ground
beef and just going "Meat."

1661
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:29,826
Meat, meat.

1662
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:31,761
It brings back
what a lot of horror films

1663
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:35,098
I think have been missing in
recent time and that is humor.

1664
01:10:35,131 --> 01:10:36,333
A lot of people
are caught off guard

1665
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:38,935
With the fact that Slither
was a horror comedy

1666
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,405
Which at the time
was sort of taboo.

1667
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:43,607
It's unfortunate that it kind
of got lost in the shuffle.

1668
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,875
A lot of people instantly
see the slugs

1669
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,344
And they're like "Oh I don't
like bugs."

1670
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:51,848
But it really is one that not
everybody see and it's so good.

1671
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:56,386
What makes this different
is the direction of James Gunn.

1672
01:10:56,420 --> 01:11:00,957
His execution of this story
was brilliant.

1673
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,792
James Gunn decided,

1674
01:11:02,826 --> 01:11:05,295
"Look we're not going to take
ourselves seriously"

1675
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:07,597
"Because this story is
ridiculous."

1676
01:11:07,631 --> 01:11:10,500
"So we're just going
to make a completely campy,"

1677
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:11,801
And tongue and cheek,

1678
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:14,270
And fun,
and yet scary and creepy.

1679
01:11:14,304 --> 01:11:15,772
Of all the
movies on your list,

1680
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:17,741
Slither should be
at the top of your -

1681
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,377
I haven't seen this yet
but I really should.

1682
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:24,013
James Gunn? Props, man.

1683
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:28,318
(Man screams)

1684
01:11:28,352 --> 01:11:32,589
Slither serves up
sensational slimy fun.

1685
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:37,961
Love a good gore fest? Check
out Inside at number 23.

1686
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:40,029
Inside is so disturbing,

1687
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:42,499
It made me not want to have
a child, personally.

1688
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:45,168
I hope I never get pregnant
after watching Inside.

1689
01:11:45,201 --> 01:11:46,603
Essentially it's a home
invasion movie

1690
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,539
With a really - up twist.

1691
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:51,007
The cool thing about Inside

1692
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,009
Is that the title actually has
two meanings.

1693
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,078
Obviously that's
the obvious one, inside,

1694
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:57,080
She's trying to get
inside the house

1695
01:11:57,113 --> 01:11:59,483
But there's something else
she's trying to get inside

1696
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:02,619
And I think I'll let the movie
speak for itself on that one.

1697
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,888
You go in thinking
that it's going to be

1698
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:06,790
A creepy killer kid movie

1699
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:10,326
And a baby that maybe is like
Rosemary's baby or the devil

1700
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,795
And it's really not that at all.

1701
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:14,798
It turns out to be a real
cat and mouse thriller.

1702
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,266
You take this most
seemingly simple concept

1703
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:20,169
Of a woman alone in her
house on a Christmas.

1704
01:12:20,203 --> 01:12:21,571
Then somebody shows up.

1705
01:12:21,605 --> 01:12:24,140
In the middle of the night, she
gets a knock on the door

1706
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,309
And its a woman who says,
"Oh I need to use your phone"

1707
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,644
And then tricks her way in.

1708
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:29,713
There's this one scene
where she's watching TV

1709
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:35,318
And the crazy lady comes out
of the shadows from behind her.

1710
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:38,087
Then it becomes this extreme,
brutal -

1711
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:41,858
It's maybe one of the
goriest movies ever made.

1712
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:43,693
The amount of
gore is just astounding.

1713
01:12:43,727 --> 01:12:45,595
I mean it's really Grand Guignol

1714
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:47,597
And it brings back
the French tradition

1715
01:12:47,631 --> 01:12:50,567
Of the theatricality
of the gore.

1716
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,002
Inside is about
two women battling.

1717
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,571
When you put two men against
each other

1718
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:56,806
It gets very testosterone
driven.

1719
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,307
It's like "Oh you man up -
I can get you -"

1720
01:12:58,341 --> 01:12:59,876
Your dead bro - I'll kill you."

1721
01:12:59,909 --> 01:13:01,377
But when it's women
against each other

1722
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:05,281
It gets like a mother
tiger protecting her young.

1723
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:09,419
It gets very much like
"Oh this it, you're done."

1724
01:13:09,453 --> 01:13:11,354
When it gets
to the blood bath stuff

1725
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,223
By the end you're almost
like numb to it

1726
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:16,526
Because there's so much blood.

1727
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,928
One of the key
scenes in this movie

1728
01:13:18,962 --> 01:13:23,667
Is where this woman has to
give herself a tracheotomy.

1729
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:28,472
I have to say tracheotomy scenes
get me right here every time.

1730
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:31,240
Inside has one
that tops them all

1731
01:13:31,274 --> 01:13:33,910
And it's really,
really cringe inducing.

1732
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:36,446
I don't think anybody
was prepared for how gruesome

1733
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,247
And how out there
eventually it got.

1734
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:41,217
Make sure when you watch Inside
that it's the unrated version

1735
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,820
Because the rated version
is 10 minutes shorter,

1736
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:46,155
That's how gory and
gruesome this movie is.

1737
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:50,527
It's a viscerally,
brutal, relentless movie.

1738
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,962
I mean it is not
for the faint of heart

1739
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:57,133
But if you want something
that is just raw hard,

1740
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,835
It delivers the goods.

1741
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:00,369
It will stick with you.

1742
01:14:00,403 --> 01:14:03,372
There's no ghosts,
there's no creatures,

1743
01:14:03,406 --> 01:14:05,609
It's two women
fighting each other

1744
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,544
With anything
they get their hands on.

1745
01:14:07,577 --> 01:14:12,782
Pencils, scissors, axes,
knives and it's gruesome.

1746
01:14:12,816 --> 01:14:16,620
Whenever anyone asks for me to
recommend a great gore movie,

1747
01:14:16,653 --> 01:14:21,224
My first instinct is to
recommend Inside.

1748
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:22,726
(Woman screams)

1749
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:26,129
A bloody good time all
right, only for the brave.

1750
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:28,765
If you're in the mood
for total creepiness,

1751
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,935
Check out Tourist Trap
at number 22.

1752
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:35,338
Tourist Trap revolves
around just that, a tourist trap

1753
01:14:35,371 --> 01:14:37,206
Which is sort of a roadside
attraction

1754
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,309
That you might encounter
while driving down Route 66.

1755
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:42,478
Like crashed UFO sighting,

1756
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:45,214
Look at our little aliens
in little jars.

1757
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:48,852
It's one of those sort of stop
here for a break and some gas

1758
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:51,387
And some food and
here's the tourist trap.

1759
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:53,422
It's where the tourists are
trapped into buying stuff

1760
01:14:53,456 --> 01:14:54,490
On the side of the road.

1761
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:57,193
Tourist Trap
from the late 1970s,

1762
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,462
It's got some creepy
mannequins in it.

1763
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,932
Our heroes sort of
converge at this tourist trap

1764
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:05,501
Which run by the incredible
Chuck Connors.

1765
01:15:05,535 --> 01:15:07,270
Chuck Connors
has a weird brother

1766
01:15:07,303 --> 01:15:09,539
And it's the brother
whose hobby

1767
01:15:09,573 --> 01:15:12,508
Are this mannequins
that he makes.

1768
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:16,846
He puts on masks
and different hair.

1769
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,449
Probably the scariest masks
I've seen in a horror movie.

1770
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:22,719
It's kind of those
half masks which cover

1771
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:25,354
Just about half your
face except your mouth.

1772
01:15:25,388 --> 01:15:27,724
He's killing people and
turning them into mannequins

1773
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:29,425
And then dancing
with them and doing -

1774
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,994
God, who knows
what he does with them.

1775
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:34,297
To him this is normal
and this is a way to keep

1776
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,065
The things that are - that
means something to him.

1777
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:38,501
Some kids that were on the
wrong place at the wrong time,

1778
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:42,105
Wind up falling victims
to a telekinetic mad man,

1779
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:43,773
With a split personality.

1780
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:44,908
It's really, really creepy

1781
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:46,743
And actually kind
of hard to describe.

1782
01:15:46,776 --> 01:15:48,544
It sort of needs to be
seen to be believed.

1783
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:52,048
What really sells that though
are those marvelously demented

1784
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:54,350
Mannequin things
throughout the movie

1785
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,552
That are animated by telekinesis

1786
01:15:56,586 --> 01:15:58,922
And their jaws drop open
and they scream.

1787
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:00,556
The whole mannequin
itself will sort of move

1788
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:01,991
And then it's mouth
will drop open

1789
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:03,793
And just sort of scream at you.

1790
01:16:03,827 --> 01:16:05,729
It's just so dementedly weird.

1791
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:08,531
Even the king of horror,
Stephen King,

1792
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:11,234
Praised the movie in his book,
Danse Macabre.

1793
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:14,237
Claiming it wields
an eerie, spooky power.

1794
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:15,538
Anytime someone in this movie

1795
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,874
Like fights back or
tries to get away,

1796
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:21,010
All the mannequins start
making these weird noises.

1797
01:16:21,044 --> 01:16:25,615
(Screaming)

1798
01:16:25,649 --> 01:16:27,851
It's kind of neat and it's
really beautiful in a way.

1799
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:29,352
Even though it's very creepy.

1800
01:16:29,385 --> 01:16:31,154
Creepy little film you know.

1801
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:33,156
To this day,
I can't stand next to

1802
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:34,824
A realistic looking mannequin

1803
01:16:34,858 --> 01:16:36,159
In a department store.

1804
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:38,728
I know that that sounds
silly for a guy who's 39

1805
01:16:38,762 --> 01:16:43,199
But that's how effective that
movie was in terrifying me.

1806
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:46,803
If you don't like mannequins
you will love Tourist Trap.

1807
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,738
(Horror music)

1808
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:51,374
(Woman screaming)

1809
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:53,643
Tourist Trap is a creepy
little classic

1810
01:16:53,677 --> 01:16:56,112
That you'll never forget.

1811
01:16:56,145 --> 01:16:58,782
Now get ready for another
genre classic,

1812
01:16:58,815 --> 01:17:02,952
Trilogy of Terror,
next at number 21.

1813
01:17:02,986 --> 01:17:06,122
The Trilogy of
Terror film is so great.

1814
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:08,224
It's an anthology film and
anthology films

1815
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:09,558
Are made up of shorts

1816
01:17:09,592 --> 01:17:11,695
That are strung together
into a feature movie.

1817
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:13,429
The Twilight Zone,
the Creepshow movies,

1818
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,064
All of those
are anthology films.

1819
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:17,266
Well, Trilogy of Terror
was one of the first

1820
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,602
And it's also one of the best.

1821
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,505
Karen Black stars in each
one of the three shorts

1822
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:24,640
That are in the feature film.

1823
01:17:24,674 --> 01:17:28,144
Nobody ever remembers the
first two shorts, nobody.

1824
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:29,645
You ask them, "Have you
seen Trilogy of Terror?"

1825
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,047
And ask them to talk about it,

1826
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,350
They will always talk about
that third and final story.

1827
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:37,787
You really have to
hold out for the third chapter

1828
01:17:37,821 --> 01:17:39,288
In the Trilogy of Terror.

1829
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:42,258
It's a story about
a doll coming to life,

1830
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:43,727
Not just coming to life
but being

1831
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:46,329
Extremely violent and murderous.

1832
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:50,499
The Zuni fetish doll,
little African doll

1833
01:17:50,533 --> 01:17:55,038
With the long hair and a
spear, and his about yay big.

1834
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:59,075
And he starts chasing
her around her apartment.

1835
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:01,811
Basically the idea is that
if the necklace

1836
01:18:01,845 --> 01:18:04,180
That its wearing falls off,

1837
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:05,681
It comes to life.

1838
01:18:05,715 --> 01:18:07,016
She sets this doll down

1839
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,885
And the little chain
falls off it

1840
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:10,353
Onto the coffee table.

1841
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:12,956
Next thing you know,
this little warrior doll,

1842
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:15,291
His got this teeth, these fangs

1843
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:16,826
And he's all dressed up
as a warrior,

1844
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,796
And he's got the spear
and he comes alive.

1845
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:21,931
What I love
about this film is that

1846
01:18:21,965 --> 01:18:25,234
There are absolutely no
computer generated effects.

1847
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:27,003
This movie didn't have any CGI.

1848
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:30,239
This was a little African doll
with a spear

1849
01:18:30,273 --> 01:18:32,708
That was actually
animated somehow

1850
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:35,011
To run around after Karen Black.

1851
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:38,681
You didn't need CGI because
there was Zuni fetish doll cam.

1852
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,284
So the camera
is at that level chasing

1853
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:42,786
Her kind of nipping
at her heels,

1854
01:18:42,819 --> 01:18:43,853
Nipping at her ankle.

1855
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:46,055
It just charges
after Karen Black.

1856
01:18:46,089 --> 01:18:48,491
I mean it's like
she's a piece of meat

1857
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:50,059
And he's just trying
to kill her.

1858
01:18:50,093 --> 01:18:51,761
Any which way
that he possibly can.

1859
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:53,763
He's really
viscous and very mean.

1860
01:18:53,797 --> 01:18:56,532
This little doll
is out of control.

1861
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,301
There's a scene where
she throws him

1862
01:18:58,334 --> 01:19:00,870
Inside this little suitcase and
you think,

1863
01:19:00,904 --> 01:19:03,039
Well thank God
it's locked in the suitcase.

1864
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:08,177
Until you see this little sword
come out and cut his way

1865
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:09,478
Out of the suitcase.

1866
01:19:09,512 --> 01:19:12,281
And he works so hard
at everything, "Hee-hee-hee."

1867
01:19:12,315 --> 01:19:14,483
He's just so determined
to kill her.

1868
01:19:14,517 --> 01:19:15,885
And you think it sounds silly

1869
01:19:15,919 --> 01:19:18,487
But I'm telling you it's
a huge impact on you,

1870
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:20,356
You'll never look at
little dolls the same.

1871
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:24,994
Long before Chucky from Child's
Play hit the silver screen

1872
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:27,530
There was the Zuni fetish doll.

1873
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:30,834
(Creature screaming)

1874
01:19:30,867 --> 01:19:34,871
(Woman screaming)

1875
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:39,508
You are watching 50 Best
Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

1876
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:43,179
A countdown of horror's
hidden gems.

1877
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:44,613
Up next at number 20

1878
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:49,352
Is a prickly little gem
called Splinter.

1879
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:52,822
Splinter is this movie that not
a lot of people have seen yet

1880
01:19:52,856 --> 01:19:55,624
But it's super, super creepy.

1881
01:19:55,658 --> 01:19:57,660
Some reason just thinking
about it, I get chills.

1882
01:19:57,693 --> 01:20:01,297
That thing with the spikes and
the thing -

1883
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:04,100
It's just weird,
and creepy, and gross.

1884
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,935
Splinter came to
me actually as a script.

1885
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:07,536
It was originally
called Tooth and Nail.

1886
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:09,405
It reminded me a lot of
all the great horror movies

1887
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:10,940
I loved as kid.

1888
01:20:10,974 --> 01:20:13,776
The very sort of contained
siege based movies like,

1889
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,379
Dawn of the Dead,
Alien, The Thing.

1890
01:20:16,412 --> 01:20:19,048
Movies where people are
trapped in a situation

1891
01:20:19,082 --> 01:20:20,483
And have to deal with
whatever's attacking them.

1892
01:20:20,516 --> 01:20:21,817
Takes place at a gas station

1893
01:20:21,851 --> 01:20:23,319
And these people
are stuck inside

1894
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:25,088
Of the gas station
convenient store

1895
01:20:25,121 --> 01:20:28,925
And there's this monster outside
that is pretty relentless

1896
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:30,693
And it's trying to get on in.

1897
01:20:30,726 --> 01:20:31,827
What is the actual creature
itself

1898
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:33,029
And really there
is no creature.

1899
01:20:33,062 --> 01:20:35,798
There is no entity, it's
basically a substance.

1900
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,235
If it touches you,
you sort of get infected by it.

1901
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:40,736
The core of the idea
for the creature

1902
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:43,672
In Splinter came from
is that it infects you

1903
01:20:43,706 --> 01:20:46,375
From the inside
and takes over your body

1904
01:20:46,409 --> 01:20:49,145
And takes control of
your skeletal structure

1905
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:52,081
With no regard for how
your body normally works.

1906
01:20:52,115 --> 01:20:53,950
It's not a vindictive creature,

1907
01:20:53,983 --> 01:20:56,052
It just wants to survive
in propagated species.

1908
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:58,687
As long as it has something to
eat off, it will stay alive.

1909
01:20:58,721 --> 01:21:01,157
Splinter features some of
the best special effects ever.

1910
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,691
It's absolutely incredible.

1911
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:06,595
There's a scene in the movie
where one of the characters

1912
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,231
Gets infected
at the top of his hand

1913
01:21:08,264 --> 01:21:09,532
And they need
to remove his hands.

1914
01:21:09,565 --> 01:21:11,734
So, I mean how do you do that?

1915
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:14,870
You cut it off but if you
don't have necessary tools,

1916
01:21:14,904 --> 01:21:16,705
You have to break it off.

1917
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:20,609
So Splinter has one of the most
disgusting arm removal scenes

1918
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:23,612
You will ever, ever, ever see.

1919
01:21:23,646 --> 01:21:26,950
The idea of this severed hand
running around and chasing them

1920
01:21:26,983 --> 01:21:30,319
Is kind of funny but It's
also just kind of terrifying.

1921
01:21:30,353 --> 01:21:32,088
I mean the thing is really
coming at them.

1922
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:35,391
Go! Go!

1923
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:36,625
I really like that scene.

1924
01:21:36,659 --> 01:21:39,762
It's kind of the fun break in
horror movie

1925
01:21:39,795 --> 01:21:42,198
That the audience really needs I
think at that point in the film.

1926
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:45,201
And It's a crowd pleaser,
it's a lot of fun to watch.

1927
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,170
Go see Splinter, okay?

1928
01:21:47,203 --> 01:21:48,537
Rent it, NetFlix it.

1929
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,506
Every time you think that
you have them figured out,

1930
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:52,841
It kinds of veers laughter,
veers right.

1931
01:21:52,875 --> 01:21:55,444
Really, really cool, really
dark, really strange.

1932
01:21:55,478 --> 01:22:00,649
Run.

1933
01:22:00,683 --> 01:22:04,553
I just love a movie that
gets under your skin, don't you?

1934
01:22:04,587 --> 01:22:06,689
If you're looking for bone
chilling scares

1935
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:11,127
Look no further than
Session 9 at number 19.

1936
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,329
Session 9 is about
a group of guys.

1937
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:14,730
They're an asbestos
removal team.

1938
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:15,999
They go and they
take this asbestos out

1939
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:18,301
Of this huge abandoned
mental hospital

1940
01:22:18,334 --> 01:22:20,269
And they go in and they
start working on this thing.

1941
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:21,904
And they're in separate wings
and it's a place

1942
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,406
That's absolutely horrifying.

1943
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:27,376
One of the guys finds
a box that says, evidence on it.

1944
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:30,079
Inside this box
are all these tapes,

1945
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:32,681
Prerecorded interviews of a
patient that used to live there.

1946
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:34,984
I think it was patient 444

1947
01:22:35,018 --> 01:22:38,721
And it's all of these tapes
marked session one, session two,

1948
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:40,923
Session three,
and there's nine of them.

1949
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,658
I was watching the
movie in my bedroom one night.

1950
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:44,027
My wife is asleep next to me.

1951
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,261
In the middle of the scene where
he's listening

1952
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,563
To those really slow tapes
and all that stuff.

1953
01:22:47,596 --> 01:22:49,432
My wife kind of woke up in
the middle of a nightmare

1954
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,334
And she said, "What the
hell are you watching?"

1955
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:52,735
"What is this movie?"

1956
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:56,972
What happens to this crew
after listening to these tapes,

1957
01:22:57,006 --> 01:22:59,975
It's like this energy is
summoned inside this asylum.

1958
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:01,910
It starts to sort of affect them

1959
01:23:01,944 --> 01:23:04,280
And they start to crack up a
little bit.

1960
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,582
Each guy is kind of
living in his own nightmare

1961
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:08,117
And the movie just absolutely
blew me away

1962
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:10,386
Because they did
so much with so little.

1963
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:12,088
It's got all the
atmosphere of the shining.

1964
01:23:12,121 --> 01:23:15,824
It's got all that, what's
around that next corner.

1965
01:23:15,858 --> 01:23:18,027
It's just harrowing
from beginning to end.

1966
01:23:18,061 --> 01:23:20,529
Everything that's scary
about Session 9 is in your head

1967
01:23:20,563 --> 01:23:22,065
And it's got
a great reveal ending.

1968
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:24,300
With a lot of reveal endings,
they're kind of groan worthy.

1969
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:27,170
The audience goes, "Oh my
god, are you kidding me?"

1970
01:23:27,203 --> 01:23:30,073
If you make it through the movie
and you get to that last line,

1971
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:32,308
I mean, I will
never forget that.

1972
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:35,111
That line is always
running through my head.

1973
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:37,180
So - twisted.

1974
01:23:37,213 --> 01:23:38,347
I don't know anyone
that has seen this film

1975
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:40,083
But every time
I bring up horror movies,

1976
01:23:40,116 --> 01:23:42,085
I tell people to see this movie.

1977
01:23:42,118 --> 01:23:45,888
You have to see it.

1978
01:23:45,921 --> 01:23:48,491
(Laughing)

1979
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:51,594
Happy nightmares everyone.

1980
01:23:51,627 --> 01:23:54,963
Up next at number 18
is Ginger Snaps.

1981
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:58,301
The movie, not the cookie!

1982
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:00,103
There's [not] a lot
of great werewolf movies.

1983
01:24:00,136 --> 01:24:02,938
American Werewolf in London,
The Howling, The Wolf Man.

1984
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:04,340
They kind of peak with those

1985
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,375
And then There's kind of
nothing that comes close.

1986
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:08,377
I would actually
put Ginger Snaps

1987
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:10,779
In that same league with
those great werewolf films.

1988
01:24:10,813 --> 01:24:13,749
Ginger Snaps
is about a teenage girl

1989
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:18,387
Who's a ginger who changes,
turns into a werewolf.

1990
01:24:18,421 --> 01:24:20,656
It's coming of age story

1991
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:23,492
Except it involves teen girls
and werewolves.

1992
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:27,196
It was really interesting seeing
that metaphor

1993
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,165
For the beast inside.

1994
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:31,967
You know, and like seeing this
woman confront her sexuality

1995
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,903
Through the act
of becoming a werewolf.

1996
01:24:34,937 --> 01:24:38,607
That is like the greatest
movie metaphor

1997
01:24:38,641 --> 01:24:40,243
For female puberty ever.

1998
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:42,245
It reminds me of when I was
a teenage girl

1999
01:24:42,278 --> 01:24:44,480
And I got my period and I turned

2000
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:47,082
Into a werewolf and
I started killing teenage boys.

2001
01:24:47,116 --> 01:24:49,418
So here was a really
unique interesting take

2002
01:24:49,452 --> 01:24:51,720
About two sisters named
Bridget and Ginger.

2003
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:54,223
They're kind of outcasts,
they're kind of rebels.

2004
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:57,193
They stick together,
they're the best of friends

2005
01:24:57,226 --> 01:24:59,562
And they sort of like hate
everybody else.

2006
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:01,364
They're kind of misanthropic
and living

2007
01:25:01,397 --> 01:25:02,565
In their own little world.

2008
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,867
And Ginger gets bit
by a werewolf

2009
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:08,437
And her little sister who
is more the main character

2010
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:10,573
Sort of tries to get her
to quit killing people.

2011
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,842
But also the main character's
name is Ginger and she snaps

2012
01:25:13,876 --> 01:25:16,645
But I love, I love a pun title.

2013
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:19,348
These two girls are
not normal to begin with

2014
01:25:19,382 --> 01:25:22,385
And on top of that,
now the older one's

2015
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:23,686
Turning into a werewolf.

2016
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:25,588
All of a sudden boys are
attracted to her

2017
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:26,822
And they want to take her out

2018
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:28,257
And she doesn't
really know how to do it

2019
01:25:28,291 --> 01:25:29,525
Because she's always
been a weird girl

2020
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:31,727
Who didn't like boys and
boys didn't like her.

2021
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,596
And then all of the sudden
she's ovulating

2022
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:34,997
And they find her
more attractive.

2023
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:37,600
Ovulating meaning
she's a werewolf.

2024
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:40,303
It's actually
a really sweet movie

2025
01:25:40,336 --> 01:25:43,306
Even though It's about a high
school girl tearing out throats

2026
01:25:43,339 --> 01:25:46,942
And like having six nipples
as a werewolf.

2027
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:48,444
Six or eight.

2028
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:52,047
I don't know, is it weird that
that still looks sexy to me?

2029
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:53,649
When you talk about
transforming,

2030
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:56,552
It's not like American Werewolf
in London

2031
01:25:56,585 --> 01:25:59,021
Where it's just like a two
minute sequence

2032
01:25:59,054 --> 01:26:00,155
Of her rolling on the floor

2033
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:03,058
And growing fangs
and fingers growing,

2034
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:05,328
And nails getting longer.

2035
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:08,897
It's a slow process that
she grows like a tail,

2036
01:26:08,931 --> 01:26:10,399
She starts getting
a little hair.

2037
01:26:10,433 --> 01:26:13,569
It is really a
vicious and dark movie.

2038
01:26:13,602 --> 01:26:16,239
It really explores
the relationship

2039
01:26:16,272 --> 01:26:17,840
That these two girls have

2040
01:26:17,873 --> 01:26:20,309
And how far is one willing
to go to help the other

2041
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:22,044
And how far can they
really trust each other

2042
01:26:22,077 --> 01:26:26,081
When these monstrous
elements come out in them.

2043
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:28,551
It's a really amazing
way to look at that.

2044
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:31,320
You're both a girl still but
you're also a beast in some ways

2045
01:26:31,354 --> 01:26:33,556
Once you hit puberty.

2046
01:26:33,589 --> 01:26:35,258
You're mauling men.

2047
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:36,759
That's what happened to
me when I hit puberty.

2048
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:39,795
I started mauling men in the
back of cars.

2049
01:26:39,828 --> 01:26:41,230
Normally It's the wolf MAN.

2050
01:26:41,264 --> 01:26:43,999
It's men playing werewolves,
but this is really great

2051
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,935
Because it was seen werewolves
from a female perspective.

2052
01:26:46,969 --> 01:26:49,137
Any teenager growing up that's
looking for

2053
01:26:49,171 --> 01:26:50,273
New horror films to check out,

2054
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:51,740
Ginger Snaps is definitely one
of them.

2055
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:53,242
It's part of growing up when
you're dealing with all

2056
01:26:53,276 --> 01:26:54,543
These different sides of
yourself

2057
01:26:54,577 --> 01:26:56,512
That you discover as you get
older.

2058
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:58,013
Hers just happens to be like
covered

2059
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:00,449
In hair like the major fangs.

2060
01:27:00,483 --> 01:27:03,686
(Werewolf roaring)

2061
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:07,356
Werewolf movies just don't
get any better than this.

2062
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:10,726
If creepy religious children
spook you

2063
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:14,363
Then check out Alice
Sweet Alice at number 17.

2064
01:27:14,397 --> 01:27:18,066
Alice Sweet Alice overall is one
of the scariest movies

2065
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:21,003
I've ever seen but nobody really
remembers it

2066
01:27:21,036 --> 01:27:22,705
At least in the current
generation.

2067
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:24,840
Alice Sweet Alice
takes place in the 60s.

2068
01:27:24,873 --> 01:27:27,343
It's about a mother that's
preparing her younger daughter

2069
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:28,711
For her first communion

2070
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:31,780
And the other sister
is jealous about this.

2071
01:27:31,814 --> 01:27:34,683
Besides that she's going to
start being mean to her sister.

2072
01:27:34,717 --> 01:27:36,419
Her own parents are
afraid of her

2073
01:27:36,452 --> 01:27:38,521
But there's an added
element to it

2074
01:27:38,554 --> 01:27:41,990
And that It's highly Catholic.

2075
01:27:42,024 --> 01:27:44,860
Nothing's creepier than the
creepy music

2076
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:46,862
And a girl whispering.

2077
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:48,831
Hail Mary full of grace the Lord
is with thee, blessed are...

2078
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:51,867
And just over and over again
as the titles are rolling.

2079
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,669
The murders
in Alice Sweet Alice

2080
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:55,371
Are among the most gruesome

2081
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:58,741
I have ever seen and even 30
years after the movie was made

2082
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:00,242
They remain shocking.

2083
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:03,312
That's a big part of the
power behind Alice Sweet Alice

2084
01:28:03,346 --> 01:28:05,314
Is the intensity of the kills.

2085
01:28:05,348 --> 01:28:07,015
The girl who plays the killer,

2086
01:28:07,049 --> 01:28:10,386
She puts on this sort
of clear mask.

2087
01:28:10,419 --> 01:28:13,021
That transparent
mask with a blue eye shadow

2088
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:17,760
And a rouge around the
cheeks and the red lipstick.

2089
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,528
And it's transparent
and you kind of see it

2090
01:28:19,562 --> 01:28:21,897
But you really can't see
who's behind the mask.

2091
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:23,866
She's creeping through
the church

2092
01:28:23,899 --> 01:28:26,402
And you know that It's her
from the very beginning.

2093
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:28,203
It's almost like Rhoda
in The Bad Seed

2094
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:31,006
Where you know that she's bad.

2095
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:32,875
This rage keeps
building up in the sister

2096
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:36,144
That she ends up killing her
9 year old sister

2097
01:28:36,178 --> 01:28:38,246
Who's played by Brooke Shields.

2098
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,916
Brooke Shield screams
and the mask is pulled out

2099
01:28:40,949 --> 01:28:42,951
And there's an even creepier
mask.

2100
01:28:42,985 --> 01:28:45,287
(Horror music)
(girl screams)

2101
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,123
You don't expect to see violence
done to a child like that.

2102
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:51,059
It's like, wow,
it broke some taboos.

2103
01:28:51,093 --> 01:28:52,495
That's when
the body count starts.

2104
01:28:52,528 --> 01:28:56,164
Everyone who's amongst that
little cast of characters

2105
01:28:56,198 --> 01:28:58,367
Is being killed off one by one.

2106
01:28:58,401 --> 01:29:01,404
The whole town is just so
surprised that this has happened

2107
01:29:01,437 --> 01:29:05,741
In this small community and It's
a search for who this killer is.

2108
01:29:05,774 --> 01:29:08,010
This whole movie,
every character,

2109
01:29:08,043 --> 01:29:09,745
Something's wrong with them.

2110
01:29:09,778 --> 01:29:12,415
Also worked well
as a police thriller

2111
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,216
And mystery at the same time.

2112
01:29:14,249 --> 01:29:16,619
This one is the one
that is not as famous

2113
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:19,988
As The Bad Seed
or Audrey Rose,

2114
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:22,525
Creepy Kids, movies like that
the people have heard of.

2115
01:29:22,558 --> 01:29:24,927
Not many have
seen Alice Sweet Alice

2116
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,162
But It's definitely
worth looking.

2117
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:30,566
(Creepy music)

2118
01:29:30,599 --> 01:29:32,968
Now that little girl
makes the skin crawl.

2119
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:35,704
Don't miss Alice Sweet Alice.

2120
01:29:35,738 --> 01:29:38,674
Next up at number 16 is a movie
you'll remember

2121
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:40,509
If you're ever hospitalized,

2122
01:29:40,543 --> 01:29:42,210
Visiting Hours.

2123
01:29:42,244 --> 01:29:44,580
There was this sub
genre in the early 80s

2124
01:29:44,613 --> 01:29:49,051
Of news women reporters in
danger.

2125
01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:50,853
There are movies like
Eyes of a Stranger

2126
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:52,888
And The Howling
and The Seduction,

2127
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:55,724
And the list kind of goes on
and then There's Visiting Hours.

2128
01:29:55,758 --> 01:29:58,427
I think people were going into
it expecting another

2129
01:29:58,461 --> 01:30:01,029
Jason or Michael or whatever
like that and it wasn't.

2130
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:04,032
It was actually
like intelligent adults

2131
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:06,168
In intelligent situations.

2132
01:30:06,201 --> 01:30:10,172
Visiting Hours is kind
of a rip off of Halloween 2

2133
01:30:10,205 --> 01:30:12,975
Where you have the serial killer
who just has to get

2134
01:30:13,008 --> 01:30:16,344
Into that hospital
and terrorize the nurses

2135
01:30:16,378 --> 01:30:18,714
And patients,
and the anchor woman

2136
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:22,184
Whose love interest is played by
William Shatner.

2137
01:30:22,217 --> 01:30:23,486
Always a plus!

2138
01:30:23,519 --> 01:30:25,387
In Visiting Hours, Lee
Grant plays an anchor woman

2139
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,456
Who's very opinionated
and very strong.

2140
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:29,958
For some reason we don't know
at first why

2141
01:30:29,992 --> 01:30:31,860
But really in theory It's
Michael Ironside

2142
01:30:31,894 --> 01:30:33,796
Who plays our killer.

2143
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:35,430
He's got some personal
vendetta against her.

2144
01:30:35,464 --> 01:30:39,267
So he stalks her, injures her
in her home

2145
01:30:39,301 --> 01:30:40,569
And then she's
sent to the hospital

2146
01:30:40,603 --> 01:30:43,639
Where he stalks her more
during the visiting hours.

2147
01:30:43,672 --> 01:30:45,508
Unlike the other
80s horror films,

2148
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:48,210
Like Michael Myers or Jason,

2149
01:30:48,243 --> 01:30:50,746
Michael Ironside is this
character that is out front

2150
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,881
You know who this guy is.

2151
01:30:52,915 --> 01:30:54,449
This wasn't a faceless killer.

2152
01:30:54,483 --> 01:30:56,251
This is someone you
meet right away.

2153
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:58,887
You see what he exactly
looks like right away.

2154
01:30:58,921 --> 01:31:01,724
You go to his apartment
and you see where he lives.

2155
01:31:01,757 --> 01:31:03,892
You follow him around
like he's an ordinary guy

2156
01:31:03,926 --> 01:31:05,393
Which actually makes it
terrifying

2157
01:31:05,427 --> 01:31:09,832
That this guy could be
any person on the street.

2158
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:12,467
Yeah, you don't want
to run in to this guy.

2159
01:31:12,501 --> 01:31:14,770
He just sort of
wanders in whenever he wants.

2160
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:16,705
He pretends to be a well wisher,

2161
01:31:16,739 --> 01:31:19,642
He even hurts, injures himself
so he has to go to the hospital.

2162
01:31:19,675 --> 01:31:22,044
(Glass breaking)

2163
01:31:22,077 --> 01:31:25,681
He mutilates his arm by
taking a bottle, smashing it,

2164
01:31:25,714 --> 01:31:27,149
Giving him some really bad cuts

2165
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:29,685
To get him admitted
into the hospital.

2166
01:31:29,718 --> 01:31:33,989
Sure enough they take him in
and he's couple of rooms down.

2167
01:31:34,022 --> 01:31:35,524
He's in there for a few minutes
and then decides

2168
01:31:35,558 --> 01:31:37,526
To go
look for good old Deborah.

2169
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,494
(Horror music)

2170
01:31:43,932 --> 01:31:45,534
(Woman screaming)

2171
01:31:45,568 --> 01:31:48,737
There's that amazing scene, he
goes after her children.

2172
01:31:48,771 --> 01:31:50,105
And It's just one
of those great moments

2173
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:51,439
Where the little kids
are woken up

2174
01:31:51,473 --> 01:31:53,308
And they're at the top
of the stairs

2175
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:54,442
And he's just looking at them,

2176
01:31:54,476 --> 01:31:55,678
Coming up with them
with a knife.

2177
01:31:55,711 --> 01:31:57,512
And you're thinking wow,
this movie is going

2178
01:31:57,546 --> 01:31:58,881
To take that turn.

2179
01:31:58,914 --> 01:32:02,017
(Horror music)

2180
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:04,186
It's one of those great movies
that you remember

2181
01:32:04,219 --> 01:32:06,088
The next day when you wake up.

2182
01:32:06,121 --> 01:32:08,957
And you're like yes, that
movie stays with you.

2183
01:32:08,991 --> 01:32:11,994
(Horror music)

2184
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:17,265
You are watching 50 Best
Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

2185
01:32:17,299 --> 01:32:20,335
A countdown of horror's
hidden gems.

2186
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:24,539
Next on our list at number 15 is
the black and white masterpiece,

2187
01:32:24,573 --> 01:32:27,309
Repulsion.

2188
01:32:27,342 --> 01:32:29,211
These producers came to
Polanski and they were like,

2189
01:32:29,244 --> 01:32:31,780
"Can you make us a campy,
shitty, horror movie?"

2190
01:32:31,814 --> 01:32:34,617
He was like "Oh yes, of
course, you know, of course."

2191
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:37,185
And then he proceeded to like
go completely over budget

2192
01:32:37,219 --> 01:32:41,256
And make this completely
insane like bizarro art movie.

2193
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:47,229
Roman Polanski's Repulsion
is about sexual repression.

2194
01:32:47,262 --> 01:32:50,733
It's about a woman who stays
cooped up in her apartment

2195
01:32:50,766 --> 01:32:52,635
For too long and goes nuts.

2196
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:55,838
Catherine Deneuve plays
this gorgeous young manicurist

2197
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:58,173
Who is integrated with
her sister to London.

2198
01:32:58,206 --> 01:33:01,176
And she's the object of desire
of every man

2199
01:33:01,209 --> 01:33:03,912
Who sees her naturally
but she has this

2200
01:33:03,946 --> 01:33:07,415
Like weird frigging repression
thing going on.

2201
01:33:07,449 --> 01:33:08,617
She's in every frame

2202
01:33:08,651 --> 01:33:11,086
And she is what you're watching
the entire time.

2203
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:12,688
And it's her descent
into madness

2204
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:16,024
Once the sister
goes away for the weekend.

2205
01:33:16,058 --> 01:33:18,794
And she's begging the sister
"Please, please don't go.

2206
01:33:18,827 --> 01:33:20,663
"Please don't go." And you're
thinking,

2207
01:33:20,696 --> 01:33:22,631
"Why not?
What's the matter with you?"

2208
01:33:22,665 --> 01:33:25,533
And yet once the sister goes
and then the guy

2209
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:28,070
That has been pursuing her
finally says,

2210
01:33:28,103 --> 01:33:29,672
"I'm going to
just go over to her apartment,"

2211
01:33:29,705 --> 01:33:32,440
And then everything goes
downhill from there.

2212
01:33:32,474 --> 01:33:34,009
I don't want to spoil it
for people

2213
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:35,477
Who are wanting to watch it

2214
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:38,546
But she does some really
terrible things

2215
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:42,017
That start to happen
once this guy comes over.

2216
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:45,688
In her mind I think she thinks
sex is probably

2217
01:33:45,721 --> 01:33:47,255
The last thing she wants to do

2218
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:50,625
And she would rather die
or kill somebody

2219
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:54,362
Than be subjected
to what she hears

2220
01:33:54,396 --> 01:33:57,232
Often times her sister
doing in the next bedroom.

2221
01:33:57,265 --> 01:34:00,135
It's a very
psychological horror.

2222
01:34:00,168 --> 01:34:02,304
Watching an environment's
transformation

2223
01:34:02,337 --> 01:34:05,941
Mirroring the protagonist
is fascinating for me.

2224
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:08,643
For instance Carol was left in
the apartment alone

2225
01:34:08,677 --> 01:34:10,645
With this rabbit and she puts it

2226
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:11,814
Back in the refrigerator

2227
01:34:11,847 --> 01:34:14,382
And then once her sister
leaves for the weekend,

2228
01:34:14,416 --> 01:34:16,384
For some reason she takes
it out and we think,

2229
01:34:16,418 --> 01:34:18,353
"Oh, she's finally going
to cook that rabbit."

2230
01:34:18,386 --> 01:34:21,089
"Can you eat it please or
throw it away?" but no.

2231
01:34:21,123 --> 01:34:23,291
She puts it on the floor
in the living room

2232
01:34:23,325 --> 01:34:25,660
As the scene progresses
and the days go by,

2233
01:34:25,694 --> 01:34:28,296
Bugs and
flies start buzzing around it

2234
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:31,900
And there's always this rabbit
laying there bloody on the plate

2235
01:34:31,934 --> 01:34:33,802
And it's disgusting
and horrifying

2236
01:34:33,836 --> 01:34:35,670
And makes you very squeamish.

2237
01:34:35,704 --> 01:34:37,706
Many directors cite Repulsion

2238
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:39,842
As being influential
on their work.

2239
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:43,111
Among them Darren Aronofsky,
director of Black Swan

2240
01:34:43,145 --> 01:34:45,280
And Lucky McKee director of May

2241
01:34:45,313 --> 01:34:49,451
Which also happens to be the
number 34 movie on our list.

2242
01:34:49,484 --> 01:34:51,653
It would have been a film
that would have interested me

2243
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:55,190
Because my father always told me
I looked like Catherine Deneuve.

2244
01:34:55,223 --> 01:34:56,759
So I think I wanted
to see the movie

2245
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:58,460
Because Catherine Deneuve
was in it.

2246
01:34:58,493 --> 01:35:02,130
The best most beautifully
shot portrait of someone

2247
01:35:02,164 --> 01:35:06,935
Descending into madness
that I or you have ever seen.

2248
01:35:06,969 --> 01:35:09,437
It's still crucial viewing for
anyone who considers

2249
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:11,406
Themselves horror film fan.

2250
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:15,577
(Hammering sound)

2251
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:17,312
What's that saying again?

2252
01:35:17,345 --> 01:35:19,681
Paranoia will destroy ya?

2253
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:23,318
If you think hidden cameras
can't be scary, think again.

2254
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:26,554
At number 14 is Alone With Her.

2255
01:35:26,588 --> 01:35:29,792
Alone with her is about
this guy played by Colin Hanks.

2256
01:35:29,825 --> 01:35:32,327
Colin was at the top
of my wish list from day one

2257
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,863
And when I heard that he liked
the script, I was thrilled.

2258
01:35:34,897 --> 01:35:36,698
So we met and what was great
about working

2259
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,333
With Colin among other things

2260
01:35:38,366 --> 01:35:40,903
Was that we saw the film
in the same way.

2261
01:35:40,936 --> 01:35:44,206
I mean he was as excited to
bend some rules as I was.

2262
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,574
It's a voyeuristic
stalker movie.

2263
01:35:46,608 --> 01:35:48,143
He's kind of trying to
infiltrate the life

2264
01:35:48,176 --> 01:35:49,677
Of this girl that he likes.

2265
01:35:49,711 --> 01:35:52,680
It's kind of put together from
surveillance camera footage,

2266
01:35:52,714 --> 01:35:54,149
Cameras that he wears
on himself.

2267
01:35:54,182 --> 01:35:57,652
So you the audience gets to
kind of partake in the voyeurism

2268
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:59,187
Of how he kind of
stalks this girl

2269
01:35:59,221 --> 01:36:01,223
And becomes a part of her life.

2270
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:04,860
This movie is very,
very inventive

2271
01:36:04,893 --> 01:36:07,029
In a way that it uses
the camera.

2272
01:36:07,062 --> 01:36:09,264
It's very much a
first person perspective

2273
01:36:09,297 --> 01:36:10,899
We're seeing her
through his eyes.

2274
01:36:10,933 --> 01:36:13,068
So for example when he meets
her in the coffee shop,

2275
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:14,136
It's the black and white shots

2276
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:15,804
Where he's wearing on his
person.

2277
01:36:15,838 --> 01:36:18,306
And here you can see her looking
right into his eyes

2278
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,441
And speaking to her.

2279
01:36:19,474 --> 01:36:20,642
It was nice talking to you.

2280
01:36:20,675 --> 01:36:22,310
Yeah, I guess
I'll see you around, huh?

2281
01:36:22,344 --> 01:36:23,611
Yes.

2282
01:36:23,645 --> 01:36:25,447
I can't wait to hear
about your taste in books.

2283
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:26,581
Yeah.

2284
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:29,852
He uses information as a weapon.

2285
01:36:29,885 --> 01:36:32,354
In other words he makes up
for whatever disadvantages

2286
01:36:32,387 --> 01:36:34,122
He has as a person.

2287
01:36:34,156 --> 01:36:36,358
Even he has no self confidence,
he doesn't know what to say

2288
01:36:36,391 --> 01:36:38,126
Or when to say it but he uses

2289
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:41,763
An informational advantage
to compensate for that.

2290
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:45,300
And he gets the information
through surveillance.

2291
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:48,636
And the way that he implants
himself into her life,

2292
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:50,906
There's scene where
she tells him,

2293
01:36:50,939 --> 01:36:53,408
"I'm going to go stay with
my parents for a few days."

2294
01:36:53,441 --> 01:36:55,911
And while she's gone, we see
him on his hidden cameras

2295
01:36:55,944 --> 01:36:58,313
Like sleeping in her room.

2296
01:36:58,346 --> 01:37:00,448
He sneaks into her house,
he goes so far

2297
01:37:00,482 --> 01:37:02,784
As to make her dog disappear.

2298
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:04,552
Kill her best friend.

2299
01:37:04,586 --> 01:37:07,289
Break in, put glass
all over the floor

2300
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:10,325
And so it's dark and she
comes home and she steps in it

2301
01:37:10,358 --> 01:37:11,559
And then she has to call him.

2302
01:37:11,593 --> 01:37:13,361
He does a really good job
being an abuser

2303
01:37:13,395 --> 01:37:16,464
And pretending like
he's the white knight,

2304
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,599
And coming to save her.

2305
01:37:17,632 --> 01:37:19,434
It's kind of a low
budget independent film

2306
01:37:19,467 --> 01:37:23,605
That a lot of people didn't see
that shows how much you can do

2307
01:37:23,638 --> 01:37:27,142
With kind of just being creative
with cameras.

2308
01:37:27,175 --> 01:37:29,044
The reason Alone
With Her is on this list

2309
01:37:29,077 --> 01:37:32,514
Is because being stalked
like that is very real

2310
01:37:32,547 --> 01:37:34,716
And I'm sure it happens a
lot where people break in

2311
01:37:34,749 --> 01:37:37,986
And install cameras
and then slowly watch.

2312
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:41,123
It's scary, it's like,
who can you trust?

2313
01:37:41,156 --> 01:37:43,959
The technology has
only gotten better

2314
01:37:43,992 --> 01:37:46,394
Since I shot the film in 2005.

2315
01:37:46,428 --> 01:37:49,231
These micro cameras are
everywhere

2316
01:37:49,264 --> 01:37:50,632
And it's really scary.

2317
01:37:50,665 --> 01:37:53,868
I mean I think anyone looking
to do this,

2318
01:37:53,902 --> 01:37:56,538
The equipment is out there
and anyone can get it.

2319
01:37:56,571 --> 01:37:58,606
After you watch Alone With Her,

2320
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:01,977
You're kind of looking up
and like

2321
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:04,947
"Hmm, where could someone
possibly put a camera?"

2322
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:06,114
We were trying to do

2323
01:38:06,148 --> 01:38:08,050
Something different
and innovative.

2324
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:09,317
It's very scary and It's

2325
01:38:09,351 --> 01:38:11,353
Really effective
and it draws you in

2326
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:14,022
And the ending is pretty
unforgettable.

2327
01:38:14,056 --> 01:38:19,194
(Static sound)

2328
01:38:19,227 --> 01:38:21,863
If you find yourself
searching for hidden cameras

2329
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:25,167
After watching Alone With
Her, I won't make fun of you.

2330
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:28,103
Next at number 13 is
a gritty vampire movie

2331
01:38:28,136 --> 01:38:32,274
With a cowboy flare, Near Dark.

2332
01:38:32,307 --> 01:38:36,511
Near Dark has to be one
of my favorite movies ever.

2333
01:38:36,544 --> 01:38:38,380
Near Dark was
directed by Kathryn Bigelow

2334
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:40,782
Who just recently won the
Oscar for The Hurt Locker.

2335
01:38:40,815 --> 01:38:43,918
You could see
the style in this film

2336
01:38:43,952 --> 01:38:46,754
Just coming a mile away
of what kind of director

2337
01:38:46,788 --> 01:38:48,590
She was going to
continue to become

2338
01:38:48,623 --> 01:38:50,492
And this movie is amazing.

2339
01:38:50,525 --> 01:38:52,327
It's a horror western.

2340
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:55,263
So It's got like people
riding horses with cowboy hats

2341
01:38:55,297 --> 01:38:56,764
But It's also got vampires.

2342
01:38:56,798 --> 01:39:00,468
You have this kind
of cow poke kid from a farm

2343
01:39:00,502 --> 01:39:04,772
And he's out one night downtown
having an ice cream cone

2344
01:39:04,806 --> 01:39:06,774
And he sees this beautiful girl.

2345
01:39:06,808 --> 01:39:09,377
He's just completely
infatuated with her.

2346
01:39:09,411 --> 01:39:11,646
Unfortunate for him because
she's traveling around

2347
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,315
With a band of fellow vampires

2348
01:39:13,348 --> 01:39:16,985
Including Lance Henriksen,
Jenette Goldstein,

2349
01:39:17,019 --> 01:39:19,621
The kid whose name I
can't remember but says,

2350
01:39:19,654 --> 01:39:23,558
"You're so ugly you make my
gums ache." My favorite line.

2351
01:39:23,591 --> 01:39:27,495
So this cow poke gets sucks
into this vampire clan

2352
01:39:27,529 --> 01:39:30,932
And he's turning into a vampire
but of course makes

2353
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:34,036
The stomach turn to think about
killing other people.

2354
01:39:34,069 --> 01:39:37,205
And the best scene
is that bar scene

2355
01:39:37,239 --> 01:39:39,041
Where they're really trying to
teach him

2356
01:39:39,074 --> 01:39:41,309
How to go and hunt and kill.

2357
01:39:41,343 --> 01:39:42,677
And they lock that bar

2358
01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:46,614
And they just take the rednecks
down one by one.

2359
01:39:46,648 --> 01:39:48,750
To the patrons
they don't look like vampires.

2360
01:39:48,783 --> 01:39:50,118
They don't have teeth,
they don't come up that way.

2361
01:39:50,152 --> 01:39:52,054
They just seem like
a crazy family

2362
01:39:52,087 --> 01:39:53,388
And everybody in that
bar knows that

2363
01:39:53,421 --> 01:39:54,722
They're not getting out alive.

2364
01:39:54,756 --> 01:39:57,525
Even Bill Paxton doing
this really awesome role.

2365
01:39:57,559 --> 01:40:01,129
He's this shift kicker vampire
and they devastate the bar

2366
01:40:01,163 --> 01:40:03,465
And it's sudden explosive
violence.

2367
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:05,400
There's a beautiful
waitress and he kills her

2368
01:40:05,433 --> 01:40:07,069
And he fills a pitcher
with her blood.

2369
01:40:07,102 --> 01:40:09,537
Basically Near Dark
to me I think

2370
01:40:09,571 --> 01:40:13,208
Is the ultimate boy meets girl

2371
01:40:13,241 --> 01:40:16,178
Then boy has to meet girl's
family for the first time.

2372
01:40:16,211 --> 01:40:19,414
And the terror that comes with
that, that moment when she goes,

2373
01:40:19,447 --> 01:40:21,049
"I'd like you to meet my dad."

2374
01:40:21,083 --> 01:40:22,917
He's like "Oh, okay."

2375
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:26,854
But dad isn't dad, it's Lance
Henriksen, he's a bad ass.

2376
01:40:26,888 --> 01:40:30,592
It's Bill Paxton who basically
represents the crazy brother.

2377
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:32,460
He's the crazy brother
who plays football

2378
01:40:32,494 --> 01:40:34,162
But he doesn't play
football in this movie.

2379
01:40:34,196 --> 01:40:36,531
He has spurs and he like tears
your throat out,

2380
01:40:36,564 --> 01:40:37,765
That't Near Dark to me.

2381
01:40:37,799 --> 01:40:39,134
So many vampire movies,

2382
01:40:39,167 --> 01:40:41,736
Oh, I'm going to rewrite
the whole book on vampires

2383
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:43,238
And what they mean by that is
I'm going to rip off

2384
01:40:43,271 --> 01:40:44,806
Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark.

2385
01:40:44,839 --> 01:40:47,675
If you really want to see where
Oscar winning director

2386
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:48,843
Kathryn Bigelow came from,

2387
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:50,412
You should really check out
Near Dark.

2388
01:40:50,445 --> 01:40:52,580
A lot of horror
fans maybe haven't seen it

2389
01:40:52,614 --> 01:40:54,682
Because they're like "Oh, that's
just some weird vampire film."

2390
01:40:54,716 --> 01:40:59,221
But It's actually like a really
well shot, beautiful looking,

2391
01:40:59,254 --> 01:41:01,556
Western, slash horror.

2392
01:41:01,589 --> 01:41:03,458
What you people want?

2393
01:41:03,491 --> 01:41:06,494
Just a couple moments of your
time about the same duration

2394
01:41:06,528 --> 01:41:09,097
As the rest of your life.

2395
01:41:09,131 --> 01:41:12,867
If your blood just ran
cold, that's a good sign!

2396
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,703
Next up at number 12,
ladies and gentleman,

2397
01:41:15,737 --> 01:41:19,241
Meet the trouble little boy
named Joshua.

2398
01:41:19,274 --> 01:41:21,176
There are lots
of creepy kid movies

2399
01:41:21,209 --> 01:41:23,611
Like The Good Sign,
The Bad Seed.

2400
01:41:23,645 --> 01:41:25,313
Joshua was right up
there with them.

2401
01:41:25,347 --> 01:41:27,149
Sam Rockwell's
performance in this movie.

2402
01:41:27,182 --> 01:41:29,217
People talk about Moon and
some of his other work.

2403
01:41:29,251 --> 01:41:30,918
I think he should have gotten
the Oscar for this one.

2404
01:41:30,952 --> 01:41:33,821
He is just hilarious in
this movie and terrific.

2405
01:41:33,855 --> 01:41:35,157
The fact that Sam Rockwell
is in it

2406
01:41:35,190 --> 01:41:36,424
Is the reason you should see it.

2407
01:41:36,458 --> 01:41:38,460
How do you play a dad
that realizes

2408
01:41:38,493 --> 01:41:40,828
His son may be a murderer?

2409
01:41:40,862 --> 01:41:42,130
Rockwell found a way.

2410
01:41:42,164 --> 01:41:44,866
The mother is going
through postpartum depression

2411
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:46,834
Played by Vera Farmiga
who interestingly

2412
01:41:46,868 --> 01:41:49,171
Did another
Bad Seed child movie

2413
01:41:49,204 --> 01:41:51,473
Called Orphan which is
actually really good, too.

2414
01:41:51,506 --> 01:41:53,208
There are so many elements
going on to this movie,

2415
01:41:53,241 --> 01:41:55,343
Themes going on to this movie
that are beyond

2416
01:41:55,377 --> 01:41:57,245
Just the fact
that the kid is kind of evil.

2417
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:00,615
There's also the idea of the
modern family in New York City

2418
01:42:00,648 --> 01:42:04,286
Trying to keep up with this sort
of New York City Joneses.

2419
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:07,722
And they're stressed and they're
dealing with this weird kid.

2420
01:42:07,755 --> 01:42:09,991
All the while you're kind
of wondering is this little kid,

2421
01:42:10,024 --> 01:42:11,293
Is he really dangerous?

2422
01:42:11,326 --> 01:42:12,694
You start doubting yourself.

2423
01:42:12,727 --> 01:42:15,297
Well, you know, I haven't
seen the kid do anything.

2424
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:17,532
Maybe he's not so bad,
maybe it's the father,

2425
01:42:17,565 --> 01:42:19,167
Maybe he is a bad father.

2426
01:42:19,201 --> 01:42:23,238
Maybe the mother is just
going a little nutty.

2427
01:42:23,271 --> 01:42:26,374
He's put in question,
you're not sure exactly.

2428
01:42:26,408 --> 01:42:28,343
Is he a sociopath?

2429
01:42:28,376 --> 01:42:29,911
He probably is.

2430
01:42:29,944 --> 01:42:32,380
He just have that perfect
balance

2431
01:42:32,414 --> 01:42:34,182
Of creepiness but sweetness.

2432
01:42:34,216 --> 01:42:35,650
He has a brain of an adult

2433
01:42:35,683 --> 01:42:37,252
And that's what's actually
really creepy about it.

2434
01:42:37,285 --> 01:42:40,588
Is the fact that the lead
character, a young boy

2435
01:42:40,622 --> 01:42:42,490
Is talking and acting like
an adult.

2436
01:42:42,524 --> 01:42:44,859
I guess it's the idea of when
you see children

2437
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:46,828
On the one hand,
they're supposed to be innocent.

2438
01:42:46,861 --> 01:42:50,064
They can operate in a
diabolical way with impunity

2439
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:55,102
Because nobody wants to
assume the worst about a kid.

2440
01:42:55,136 --> 01:42:58,706
It's a real talent
to be able to maintain

2441
01:42:58,740 --> 01:43:00,975
That sort of edge-of-your-seat
underlying tension

2442
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:02,710
In a film throughout,

2443
01:43:02,744 --> 01:43:03,978
Without anything happening.

2444
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,947
You know, nothing bad really
happens

2445
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:08,583
In the movie
but it's all so tense.

2446
01:43:08,616 --> 01:43:11,152
Entertainment weekly
and The Hollywood Reporter

2447
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:13,755
Praised the movie and it was
also a selection

2448
01:43:13,788 --> 01:43:17,425
At the Sundance
film festival in 2007.

2449
01:43:17,459 --> 01:43:18,593
Fox Searchlight like put it out,

2450
01:43:18,626 --> 01:43:20,094
They're not in too many
theaters.

2451
01:43:20,127 --> 01:43:22,196
So I don't think a lot of people
have gotten a chance to see it.

2452
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:24,165
The kid that played Joshua,
he went on to be

2453
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:26,100
The little Spock in Star Trek.

2454
01:43:26,133 --> 01:43:27,735
There's no greater honor I think

2455
01:43:27,769 --> 01:43:31,406
Than to say that you're
capable of living up to Nimoy

2456
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:33,475
And I think he did a
great job in that too.

2457
01:43:33,508 --> 01:43:36,411
It surprises me how
many people have not seen it.

2458
01:43:36,444 --> 01:43:39,881
How much it was ignored
because It's really well made.

2459
01:43:39,914 --> 01:43:43,551
And I've got to say the
last few seconds of that movie

2460
01:43:43,585 --> 01:43:45,086
Will make your skin crawl.

2461
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:50,258
You'll watch it again and again
because it draws you in slowly

2462
01:43:50,292 --> 01:43:53,695
And then the last few seconds
is just sort of catapults itself

2463
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:56,798
Into this other stratosphere
of horror.

2464
01:43:56,831 --> 01:44:00,302
That's when you realize just how
terrifying the movie is.

2465
01:44:00,335 --> 01:44:01,969
I think everybody in the room
will have

2466
01:44:02,003 --> 01:44:04,105
A different understanding of
what just happened

2467
01:44:04,138 --> 01:44:06,040
In that last couple
moments of the film.

2468
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:09,377
It's really chilling,
kind of beautiful

2469
01:44:09,411 --> 01:44:11,112
And that's the end of the movie.

2470
01:44:11,145 --> 01:44:13,348
It's on this list for a reason.

2471
01:44:13,381 --> 01:44:15,950
It's just one of the
best horror movies

2472
01:44:15,983 --> 01:44:17,452
You've probably never seen.

2473
01:44:17,485 --> 01:44:19,554
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2474
01:44:19,587 --> 01:44:21,756
What are you doing?

2475
01:44:21,789 --> 01:44:24,626
In Egypt when they
embalm people like Pharaohs,

2476
01:44:24,659 --> 01:44:28,162
They broke the nose and removed
the brain through the opening.

2477
01:44:28,195 --> 01:44:30,164
This movie is
the strongest argument

2478
01:44:30,197 --> 01:44:32,767
For birth control
you'll ever hear.

2479
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,037
Ever heard the expression,
Don't Be Afraid of the Dark?

2480
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:39,240
Coming in at number 11,
will explain why.

2481
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,675
Don't Be Afraid of the Dark

2482
01:44:40,708 --> 01:44:44,546
Was a TV movie originally
in 1973

2483
01:44:44,579 --> 01:44:46,280
Brought to you by Lorimar.

2484
01:44:46,314 --> 01:44:47,815
When you first turn it on, you
think you're just

2485
01:44:47,849 --> 01:44:50,352
Going to watch an episode of
Mary Tyler Moore

2486
01:44:50,385 --> 01:44:52,186
And then it goes kind of wrong.

2487
01:44:52,219 --> 01:44:55,256
Kim Darby plays this woman
who has moved

2488
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:58,225
Into her grandmother's
rambling old house.

2489
01:44:58,259 --> 01:45:01,228
Moved out of the city with her
high powered lawyer husband

2490
01:45:01,262 --> 01:45:03,531
And they're going to fix it
up and it's going to be great.

2491
01:45:03,565 --> 01:45:06,534
She's in this like middle
class boredom with her husband

2492
01:45:06,568 --> 01:45:08,302
And the husband's always
working,

2493
01:45:08,336 --> 01:45:09,704
Nobody's listening to her.

2494
01:45:09,737 --> 01:45:12,540
I mean even her friends are kind
of bored with their stories.

2495
01:45:12,574 --> 01:45:15,410
There is a locked room
in the house

2496
01:45:15,443 --> 01:45:18,913
That has a walled off fireplace.

2497
01:45:18,946 --> 01:45:20,782
Basically the openings
to the fire place

2498
01:45:20,815 --> 01:45:22,283
Have been all bricked up

2499
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:27,922
And steel bars and basically
the message is, do not open.

2500
01:45:27,955 --> 01:45:29,957
The handyman is like
"Don't do it."

2501
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:33,027
"Some things are better
left the way they are."

2502
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:35,663
Truly all it need
is to be smashed open.

2503
01:45:35,697 --> 01:45:37,965
Those bricks are
cemented four deep

2504
01:45:37,999 --> 01:45:39,967
And reinforced with iron bars.

2505
01:45:40,001 --> 01:45:42,904
Some things
are better left as they are

2506
01:45:42,937 --> 01:45:44,972
Especially that fire place.

2507
01:45:45,006 --> 01:45:48,142
But no, she's got to
open the freaking fireplace!

2508
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:51,212
They open the wall and
it lets out these three goblins

2509
01:45:51,245 --> 01:45:53,280
Who somehow have some
attachment to her.

2510
01:45:53,314 --> 01:45:56,350
Oh my God, they've got these
like pumpkin heads.

2511
01:45:56,384 --> 01:45:58,586
They have these little
slashing claws,

2512
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:00,388
Black eyes, raspy mouth

2513
01:46:00,422 --> 01:46:02,390
And gorilla, little chimpanzee
bodies.

2514
01:46:02,424 --> 01:46:05,259
And they come out in the
dark and they want her soul.

2515
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:09,030
Now she's got little evil troll
people running around

2516
01:46:09,063 --> 01:46:12,299
Saying, "Sally, we want you."

2517
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:15,002
And grabbing at her dress
and tripping in,

2518
01:46:15,036 --> 01:46:17,304
Killing her interior decorator.

2519
01:46:17,338 --> 01:46:24,779
(Horror music)

2520
01:46:24,812 --> 01:46:26,448
You thought you were having
a bad day.

2521
01:46:26,481 --> 01:46:30,452
The last ten minutes of
this movie are gut wrenching.

2522
01:46:30,485 --> 01:46:34,656
It's as scary as any real played
in theaters film on the list.

2523
01:46:34,689 --> 01:46:36,357
They grab her
and they're dragging her

2524
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:37,792
Down to the basement

2525
01:46:37,825 --> 01:46:40,261
And she's alone in the house
except for the goblins.

2526
01:46:40,294 --> 01:46:44,265
And she grabs this old 70s
Polaroid camera

2527
01:46:44,298 --> 01:46:46,167
And she was snapping flashes

2528
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:47,268
And the only thing that pulls

2529
01:46:47,301 --> 01:46:49,136
These monsters back are the
flashes.

2530
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:51,806
But there's only a
limited amount of flashes

2531
01:46:51,839 --> 01:46:53,941
And they're getting closer
and closer to the basement.

2532
01:46:53,975 --> 01:46:55,843
This movie is insidious.

2533
01:46:55,877 --> 01:46:58,680
People forget that Don't Be
Afraid of the Dark is a TV movie

2534
01:46:58,713 --> 01:47:00,782
Because it is utterly
horrifying.

2535
01:47:00,815 --> 01:47:02,750
(Horror music)

2536
01:47:08,122 --> 01:47:12,760
You are watching 50 Best
Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

2537
01:47:12,794 --> 01:47:16,230
A countdown of horror's
hidden gems.

2538
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:19,266
Claiming our number 10 spot
is Audition.

2539
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:23,004
A nasty little film
that sneaks up on you.

2540
01:47:23,037 --> 01:47:25,272
Audition is a horror
film by Takashi Miike

2541
01:47:25,306 --> 01:47:26,841
And the funny thing
about this movie

2542
01:47:26,874 --> 01:47:30,478
Is if you were to walk out
around the 45 minute point,

2543
01:47:30,512 --> 01:47:32,514
You would think you're
watching a romantic comedy.

2544
01:47:32,547 --> 01:47:36,951
The movie takes forever
to get to become a horror film

2545
01:47:36,984 --> 01:47:39,487
But that's exactly what makes
it so great.

2546
01:47:39,521 --> 01:47:40,888
It's about a widow.

2547
01:47:40,922 --> 01:47:43,224
His son's like "Dad, you
got to start dating people."

2548
01:47:43,257 --> 01:47:46,327
He's just not satisfied
with the women that he sees.

2549
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:50,565
And he holds fake film auditions
to audition actresses

2550
01:47:50,598 --> 01:47:53,901
For a movie that really he
doesn't intend to shoot

2551
01:47:53,935 --> 01:47:55,670
But what he's really doing
is auditioning

2552
01:47:55,703 --> 01:47:57,972
For a new girlfriend
or a new wife.

2553
01:47:58,005 --> 01:48:02,944
He auditions the wrong one
and she is a little bit psycho.

2554
01:48:02,977 --> 01:48:06,347
It's almost setup
like a quirky dating game

2555
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:07,882
And then suddenly it turns into

2556
01:48:07,915 --> 01:48:11,986
Like the sadistic,
endurance test.

2557
01:48:12,019 --> 01:48:14,055
Everything seems sweet
like It's going normal

2558
01:48:14,088 --> 01:48:15,456
But then she goes home
and you see

2559
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:18,392
That she has a man
that she keeps alive in a bag

2560
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:20,027
In the corner of her room.

2561
01:48:20,061 --> 01:48:23,397
I'm going to be honest
with you, this one is hardcore.

2562
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:26,968
I've seen a lot of horror
movies and I can sit and eat

2563
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:29,671
A piece of pepperoni
pizza during most of them.

2564
01:48:29,704 --> 01:48:35,309
This one got under my skin but
at the same time it's awesome

2565
01:48:35,342 --> 01:48:38,512
Because it has
a badass chick villain

2566
01:48:38,546 --> 01:48:40,815
That you just
don't even see coming

2567
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:44,451
And you don't even know how
far she's going to take it!

2568
01:48:44,485 --> 01:48:46,487
The first time I saw it,
I'd been warned.

2569
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:49,591
I'd been told, it turns on you

2570
01:48:49,624 --> 01:48:52,026
And then you're going to
be squirming in your seat

2571
01:48:52,059 --> 01:48:55,529
And even with that warning I
was still caught off guard.

2572
01:48:55,563 --> 01:48:58,265
It's pretty intense stuff.

2573
01:48:58,299 --> 01:48:59,867
She takes the needles,
they're like,

2574
01:48:59,901 --> 01:49:01,703
Are they acupuncture needles?

2575
01:49:01,736 --> 01:49:04,371
Literally, anywhere
you wouldn't want them.

2576
01:49:04,405 --> 01:49:06,140
When she does a "tiki-tiki-ti."

2577
01:49:06,173 --> 01:49:11,145
Tiki-tiki-tiki. Kiti-kit-kiti.

2578
01:49:11,178 --> 01:49:12,213
Tiki-tiki-tiki.

2579
01:49:12,246 --> 01:49:13,981
Kiti-kit-kiti. Kiti-kit-kiti.

2580
01:49:14,015 --> 01:49:15,549
The needles in the eyeballs.

2581
01:49:15,583 --> 01:49:17,084
It's like "Ohh, man."

2582
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:18,720
Like you're...

2583
01:49:18,753 --> 01:49:21,522
There's one scene however
that cemented Audition

2584
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:23,224
Into the hearts of horror fans,

2585
01:49:23,257 --> 01:49:26,127
The scene with the piano wire.

2586
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:31,065
There's a scene where he's
tied up, she has a piano wire.

2587
01:49:31,098 --> 01:49:32,600
A whole bunch of people
were getting up

2588
01:49:32,634 --> 01:49:35,302
And walking out of the theater.

2589
01:49:35,336 --> 01:49:37,905
My wife and I were among
of the few to stick it out

2590
01:49:37,939 --> 01:49:39,140
To the bitter end.

2591
01:49:39,173 --> 01:49:42,677
She tortures him,
chops off his foot, right?

2592
01:49:42,710 --> 01:49:44,511
With piano wire.

2593
01:49:44,545 --> 01:49:47,915
(Male gasping in pain)

2594
01:49:47,949 --> 01:49:52,353
It's a great film.
(laughing)

2595
01:49:52,386 --> 01:49:55,122
That scene is up there
in the horror lexicon

2596
01:49:55,156 --> 01:49:57,024
Of crazy scenes.

2597
01:49:57,058 --> 01:49:59,360
I feel so horrible
for the people

2598
01:49:59,393 --> 01:50:01,128
Who stumbled upon this movie

2599
01:50:01,162 --> 01:50:03,030
Having no idea
it was a horror film.

2600
01:50:03,064 --> 01:50:04,866
Because when it turns
into a horror film,

2601
01:50:04,899 --> 01:50:08,569
It is one of the most sadistic,
nasty,

2602
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:12,740
Vile, vicious, repugnant movies.

2603
01:50:12,774 --> 01:50:17,544
(Laughing)

2604
01:50:17,578 --> 01:50:21,582
Go to this audition
at your own risk.

2605
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:24,118
For the vampire aficionado,
you can't beat

2606
01:50:24,151 --> 01:50:28,022
Let the Right One In, coming
in at number 9 on our list.

2607
01:50:28,055 --> 01:50:31,826
Let the Right One In a
fantastic Swedish vampire film

2608
01:50:31,859 --> 01:50:33,360
That came out a couple
of years ago.

2609
01:50:33,394 --> 01:50:34,528
Let the Right One In is not only

2610
01:50:34,561 --> 01:50:36,597
One of the best
vampire movies ever made.

2611
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:40,534
It's just one of the best movies
that you could possibly see.

2612
01:50:40,567 --> 01:50:44,571
I thought that that
was the most original take

2613
01:50:44,605 --> 01:50:47,942
On the vampire genre
I have seen in years.

2614
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:50,678
It's also sort of
a remake of My Bodyguard

2615
01:50:50,712 --> 01:50:54,381
Which is a classic beloved
children's film from the 80s

2616
01:50:54,415 --> 01:50:56,851
Except with vampires
and not for children.

2617
01:50:56,884 --> 01:51:00,221
It tells the story
of an awkward 12 year old kid

2618
01:51:00,254 --> 01:51:02,256
Who's kind of being bullied
at school

2619
01:51:02,289 --> 01:51:04,692
Who befriends this awkward
12 year old girl

2620
01:51:04,726 --> 01:51:05,960
That just moves in next door.

2621
01:51:05,993 --> 01:51:08,329
It just so happens
that she's a vampire.

2622
01:51:08,362 --> 01:51:10,097
She kind of teaches him
a little bit

2623
01:51:10,131 --> 01:51:12,266
About how to stand up
for himself

2624
01:51:12,299 --> 01:51:14,001
And vice versa
he teaches her maybe

2625
01:51:14,035 --> 01:51:16,003
A little bit about
her humanity.

2626
01:51:16,037 --> 01:51:17,371
I think he reminds her
what it was like

2627
01:51:17,404 --> 01:51:19,540
To be a kid
and have fun again.

2628
01:51:19,573 --> 01:51:21,743
That kind of bond I mean,
if you think back

2629
01:51:21,776 --> 01:51:22,977
To when you were 12 years old

2630
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:24,578
And where your friendships
are like,

2631
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:26,380
This movie captures that
perfectly.

2632
01:51:26,413 --> 01:51:29,116
The title itself,
It's talking about love.

2633
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:32,253
When you let the right one
in, they won't hurt you.

2634
01:51:32,286 --> 01:51:36,290
They're both so awkward
and cute around each other

2635
01:51:36,323 --> 01:51:39,660
Like she smells really
bad because she's dead

2636
01:51:39,693 --> 01:51:42,930
And he gets over it
because he's her friend.

2637
01:51:42,964 --> 01:51:45,132
It's just really sweet

2638
01:51:45,166 --> 01:51:48,069
And then she ends up killing
people in between

2639
01:51:48,102 --> 01:51:50,371
And It's a really cool movie!

2640
01:51:50,404 --> 01:51:52,506
There are some bullies
who pick on Oscar at the school.

2641
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:53,975
You can imagine
what happens to them

2642
01:51:54,008 --> 01:51:56,043
When his new friend gets a hold
of that.

2643
01:51:56,077 --> 01:51:57,779
Bodies are drained
with their blood

2644
01:51:57,812 --> 01:52:01,282
And they're hidden under
the ice in the frozen lakes.

2645
01:52:01,315 --> 01:52:03,617
It's a case where
you have a young actor,

2646
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:05,019
In this case a girl.

2647
01:52:05,052 --> 01:52:06,453
While they appear very youthful,

2648
01:52:06,487 --> 01:52:11,826
There's something hauntingly
mature and old about them.

2649
01:52:11,859 --> 01:52:13,427
I think obviously in the case
someone's

2650
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:15,062
Supposed to be a vampire,
it really worked.

2651
01:52:15,096 --> 01:52:16,898
It just something really
frightening

2652
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:19,934
And yet alluring about this
girl.

2653
01:52:19,967 --> 01:52:22,837
One particular moment will
have you drowning in fear.

2654
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:26,540
The spectacular scene
at the swimming pool.

2655
01:52:26,573 --> 01:52:27,674
It all kind of builds up

2656
01:52:27,708 --> 01:52:30,044
To this final scene
at the pool hall.

2657
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:32,947
The bully's brother puts
Oscar's face

2658
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:34,248
Submerged in the pool.

2659
01:52:34,281 --> 01:52:36,083
It's all done in one take.

2660
01:52:36,117 --> 01:52:38,752
He's actually hiding
in the pool underwater.

2661
01:52:38,786 --> 01:52:42,356
Air bubbles are just coming up
slowly, slowly, slowly.

2662
01:52:42,389 --> 01:52:44,358
Then you hear screams but
they're muffled screams

2663
01:52:44,391 --> 01:52:46,227
Because you're underwater
with Oscar.

2664
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,395
And you sort of just
get glimpses of the massacre

2665
01:52:48,429 --> 01:52:49,864
That's sort of going on behind

2666
01:52:49,897 --> 01:52:52,033
And these people are being
murdered and dragged across

2667
01:52:52,066 --> 01:52:53,667
Like the surface of the pool.

2668
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:57,138
And you're wondering
what the heck's happening?

2669
01:52:57,171 --> 01:52:58,739
At the peak of
the Twilight mania,

2670
01:52:58,772 --> 01:53:00,808
Here we have this
beautiful love story

2671
01:53:00,842 --> 01:53:02,543
That's also a vampire movie

2672
01:53:02,576 --> 01:53:04,478
Which is what Twilight
tried to be

2673
01:53:04,511 --> 01:53:07,581
But as far as I'm
concerned, did not succeed.

2674
01:53:07,614 --> 01:53:09,283
No vampire sparkle here.

2675
01:53:09,316 --> 01:53:12,553
We're talking about
traditional scary vampires.

2676
01:53:12,586 --> 01:53:17,091
The best contemporary
vampire film ever made.

2677
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:19,126
It shows a sense
of bravery in film making

2678
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:21,762
That I think is really
hard to find

2679
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:23,764
At least in Hollywood
film making.

2680
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,732
(Horror music)

2681
01:53:29,470 --> 01:53:33,140
Let the Right One In is
bone chilling vampire brilliance

2682
01:53:33,174 --> 01:53:35,176
And you'll thank us
for the recommendation.

2683
01:53:35,209 --> 01:53:38,579
Another brilliant film claims
our number

2684
01:53:38,612 --> 01:53:42,950
8 spot, the mind blowing,
Re-animator.

2685
01:53:42,984 --> 01:53:45,152
Dude, Re-animator.

2686
01:53:45,186 --> 01:53:50,391
I saw it the first time when
I was 14 years old, - me up.

2687
01:53:50,424 --> 01:53:54,328
Re-animator is your
classic mad scientist tale.

2688
01:53:54,361 --> 01:53:57,598
With an absolutely
iconic performance

2689
01:53:57,631 --> 01:53:59,766
By the very versatile and
talented

2690
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:01,802
Jeffrey Combs, unforgettable.

2691
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:05,539
My first horror
crush was Jeffrey Combs.

2692
01:54:05,572 --> 01:54:10,011
It's primarily because he's
so freaking good in the movie.

2693
01:54:10,044 --> 01:54:12,846
It cemented his place as a
horror icon.

2694
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:15,816
It's basically about
this mad scientist, Herbert West

2695
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:16,918
Who's trying to create this

2696
01:54:16,951 --> 01:54:18,920
Formula to bring the dead to
life.

2697
01:54:18,953 --> 01:54:21,688
But the problem is when they
come back, the brains have died

2698
01:54:21,722 --> 01:54:24,058
And they're not quite the
same as they were before.

2699
01:54:24,091 --> 01:54:26,660
They go on psychotic murderous
rampages.

2700
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:28,695
They're mindless killing
machines,

2701
01:54:28,729 --> 01:54:31,565
Duh! Doesn't that always happen?

2702
01:54:31,598 --> 01:54:33,734
Re-animator was
directed by Stuart Gordon

2703
01:54:33,767 --> 01:54:36,003
And was based on an H.P.
Lovecraft story

2704
01:54:36,037 --> 01:54:37,104
By the same name.

2705
01:54:37,138 --> 01:54:38,439
Stuart Gordon now is considered

2706
01:54:38,472 --> 01:54:39,907
Kind of one of the masters of
horror.

2707
01:54:39,941 --> 01:54:41,408
Stuart Gordon has
never made a bad movie.

2708
01:54:41,442 --> 01:54:42,543
The movie just went further

2709
01:54:42,576 --> 01:54:43,744
Than anything that I've ever
seen.

2710
01:54:43,777 --> 01:54:45,179
They were like exploding
entrails

2711
01:54:45,212 --> 01:54:46,813
Like wrapping around people.

2712
01:54:46,847 --> 01:54:49,716
(Horror music)

2713
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:52,519
It's just crazy, words can't
you really have to see it.

2714
01:54:52,553 --> 01:54:54,821
After watching that movie, I
had to sleep with the lights on

2715
01:54:54,855 --> 01:54:56,690
And with my Winnie the Pooh.

2716
01:54:56,723 --> 01:55:00,061
I have never been more
terrified with stuffed cats

2717
01:55:00,094 --> 01:55:02,396
Than when the first time
that I saw that movie

2718
01:55:02,429 --> 01:55:04,966
Like the sound that
comes out of this thing.

2719
01:55:04,999 --> 01:55:08,469
(Cat growling)

2720
01:55:08,502 --> 01:55:09,736
And It's just kind of like
twitching

2721
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:11,372
There because the spine's broken

2722
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:13,674
Like it's just, it's awesome.

2723
01:55:13,707 --> 01:55:17,578
And also very unforgettable
and delightful Barbara Crampton

2724
01:55:17,611 --> 01:55:21,115
Who's most notorious
and unforgettable scene

2725
01:55:21,148 --> 01:55:25,786
Gives a whole new meaning
to the term, "giving head".

2726
01:55:25,819 --> 01:55:27,254
If you really want to get
"ahead"

2727
01:55:27,288 --> 01:55:29,890
In your knowledge of horror
movies,

2728
01:55:29,923 --> 01:55:31,458
That's the one to go for.

2729
01:55:31,492 --> 01:55:35,562
All props to Stuart Gordon
for going there.

2730
01:55:35,596 --> 01:55:38,099
We can't say much more
about that scene on TV

2731
01:55:38,132 --> 01:55:41,335
But here's a "heads up": Pick
up a copy of Re-Animator.

2732
01:55:41,368 --> 01:55:43,937
See for yourself what
all that talk is about.

2733
01:55:43,971 --> 01:55:45,706
We have a feeling you'll be
forever grateful

2734
01:55:45,739 --> 01:55:47,341
For our recommendation.

2735
01:55:47,374 --> 01:55:49,343
It's the kind of movie
that you get a couple of beers,

2736
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,777
Get your friends together and
watch it

2737
01:55:50,811 --> 01:55:51,979
At midnight on a Friday night.

2738
01:55:52,013 --> 01:55:54,181
And It's really, really sick.

2739
01:55:54,215 --> 01:55:58,819
So I don't know what that
says about me, but I love it.

2740
01:55:58,852 --> 01:56:03,357
I will be famous.

2741
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:07,728
Everyone's entitled to
one good mad scientist movie.

2742
01:56:07,761 --> 01:56:12,366
Up next at number 7 on
our list is Wishmaster.

2743
01:56:12,399 --> 01:56:14,668
Wishmaster is the age old story

2744
01:56:14,701 --> 01:56:15,969
Of "be careful what you wish
for"

2745
01:56:16,003 --> 01:56:18,072
Which is actually the tag
they use on the poster.

2746
01:56:18,105 --> 01:56:20,774
An executive asked me to come in

2747
01:56:20,807 --> 01:56:24,845
Because they wanted to do a
horror movie.

2748
01:56:24,878 --> 01:56:27,548
When I got there they said,
"We have a great idea,

2749
01:56:27,581 --> 01:56:29,350
It's an evil genie movie."

2750
01:56:29,383 --> 01:56:33,154
He's this really evil
but very charismatic genie

2751
01:56:33,187 --> 01:56:35,389
Played by Andrew Divoff
who turns in

2752
01:56:35,422 --> 01:56:37,558
A performance that is up there

2753
01:56:37,591 --> 01:56:39,660
With Freddy Krueger in A
Nightmare on Elm Street.

2754
01:56:39,693 --> 01:56:40,994
When you get the right guy

2755
01:56:41,028 --> 01:56:43,330
And the horror makeup, it really
sells it.

2756
01:56:43,364 --> 01:56:46,900
Divoff has got a voice like a
fork in a garbage disposal

2757
01:56:46,933 --> 01:56:48,402
And so are these.

2758
01:56:48,435 --> 01:56:49,870
It doesn't matter what we write.

2759
01:56:49,903 --> 01:56:52,005
It even doesn't matter
what the makeup guys do,

2760
01:56:52,039 --> 01:56:53,707
Even though they're
brilliant and tough,

2761
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:57,544
If you don't have a guy behind
the mask who will deliver,

2762
01:56:57,578 --> 01:56:59,980
Who will commit,
who will do it right

2763
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:02,183
Then it all goes to naught,

2764
01:57:02,216 --> 01:57:04,251
And I thought Andrew was just
terrific.

2765
01:57:04,285 --> 01:57:07,654
And he plays an
evil genie called a Djinn

2766
01:57:07,688 --> 01:57:11,258
And he's sort of trapped inside
this little red kind of crystal.

2767
01:57:11,292 --> 01:57:14,495
Of course he gets out and
he starts granting wishes

2768
01:57:14,528 --> 01:57:15,929
And when he starts granting
wishes,

2769
01:57:15,962 --> 01:57:19,466
He's got a way of twisting them
a little.

2770
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,034
Just in a way that an evil genie

2771
01:57:21,068 --> 01:57:23,937
Would to make you suffer
immeasurably

2772
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:26,440
For your want, your desire.

2773
01:57:26,473 --> 01:57:27,841
Oh my god.

2774
01:57:27,874 --> 01:57:33,780
Am I to understand this is
not something you wish to see?

2775
01:57:33,814 --> 01:57:35,216
Uh-huh.

2776
01:57:35,249 --> 01:57:37,684
Very well.

2777
01:57:37,718 --> 01:57:38,685
My eyes!

2778
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:40,621
One of the real
pleasures of Wishmaster,

2779
01:57:40,654 --> 01:57:43,490
Certainly for me and certainly
for Bob Kurtzman who direct it

2780
01:57:43,524 --> 01:57:47,194
Because it was like homecoming,
it was a school reunion time

2781
01:57:47,228 --> 01:57:50,697
Because we managed to get a lot
of great people in the cast.

2782
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:53,167
We had Kane Hodder in there,
we had Tony Todd in there.

2783
01:57:53,200 --> 01:57:57,804
We had Ted Raimi, Reggie's
in there, Buck Flowers.

2784
01:57:57,838 --> 01:57:59,640
Robert of course
is in there too.

2785
01:57:59,673 --> 01:58:04,245
All these existing monsters were
welcoming Andrew into the fold.

2786
01:58:04,278 --> 01:58:06,847
We got all these people that
we loved

2787
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,649
And we have the fans love too.

2788
01:58:08,682 --> 01:58:09,683
If you're looking for something

2789
01:58:09,716 --> 01:58:11,485
A little bit our tongue and
cheek,

2790
01:58:11,518 --> 01:58:14,855
A little more crafty and clever
and fun,

2791
01:58:14,888 --> 01:58:16,890
Then you have to see Wishmaster.

2792
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:19,126
Doesn't that intrigue you?

2793
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:21,662
Just a little?

2794
01:58:21,695 --> 01:58:25,532
Be careful what you wish
for. You have been warned!

2795
01:58:25,566 --> 01:58:27,000
Claustrophobia anyone?

2796
01:58:27,033 --> 01:58:30,304
Check out our number 6 movie,
The Descent.

2797
01:58:30,337 --> 01:58:33,207
I think Descent is
probably the best film I've seen

2798
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:34,575
That deals with claustrophobia.

2799
01:58:34,608 --> 01:58:36,510
Really making you feel like
you're trapped

2800
01:58:36,543 --> 01:58:37,911
Along with the characters.

2801
01:58:37,944 --> 01:58:41,148
You feel claustrophobic,
you feel it's damp.

2802
01:58:41,182 --> 01:58:45,519
You feel It's wet, you
feel like wet with blood.

2803
01:58:45,552 --> 01:58:47,788
You just feel that real
claustrophobic feeling.

2804
01:58:47,821 --> 01:58:49,956
That would have been
scary enough for the whole movie

2805
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:53,160
But then they add monsters
to the mix, holy shit!

2806
01:58:53,194 --> 01:58:55,028
We follow a group
of female spelunkers

2807
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:56,830
Who decide to explore a cave

2808
01:58:56,863 --> 01:58:59,233
That supposedly has never
been explored before.

2809
01:58:59,266 --> 01:59:02,002
I've never seen four
better looking spelunking women.

2810
01:59:02,035 --> 01:59:04,104
They end up trapped underground

2811
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:06,740
After there's this horrible
cave-in.

2812
01:59:06,773 --> 01:59:09,109
They're wounded, their
batteries are going down

2813
01:59:09,142 --> 01:59:10,911
And then you discover that
there's something else

2814
01:59:10,944 --> 01:59:12,313
Down there with them.

2815
01:59:12,346 --> 01:59:14,848
The cool thing about it is you
got this

2816
01:59:14,881 --> 01:59:16,350
Really claustrophobic setting.

2817
01:59:16,383 --> 01:59:19,353
I mean there are shots in the
film where you're just like

2818
01:59:19,386 --> 01:59:21,422
You want them to just spread
their arms out

2819
01:59:21,455 --> 01:59:22,789
Because it's like they can't.

2820
01:59:22,823 --> 01:59:25,359
They've got rock above them and
rock below them

2821
01:59:25,392 --> 01:59:26,627
In their left and the right.

2822
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:27,894
And then there's the monsters.

2823
01:59:27,928 --> 01:59:29,496
The monsters in The Descent are
some

2824
01:59:29,530 --> 01:59:32,733
Of the scariest
monsters I've ever seen.

2825
01:59:32,766 --> 01:59:34,335
They're there for the babe
buffet

2826
01:59:34,368 --> 01:59:38,138
Because little by little every
single one of those females,

2827
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:40,106
Dead and eaten alive.

2828
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:41,308
They're very nocturnal.

2829
01:59:41,342 --> 01:59:43,310
They're like bats or whatever
they are.

2830
01:59:43,344 --> 01:59:45,546
They can't see anything at all.

2831
01:59:45,579 --> 01:59:47,681
Their skin is as weird like
translucent

2832
01:59:47,714 --> 01:59:49,450
And they just adopt this where
all they really need

2833
01:59:49,483 --> 01:59:51,852
Is like to make this weird like
click noises

2834
01:59:51,885 --> 01:59:54,421
And screams and communicate
with each other.

2835
01:59:54,455 --> 01:59:56,156
You only get perspective
on them

2836
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:57,558
When you've got a flash of light

2837
01:59:57,591 --> 01:59:59,092
Because it's dark, the
whole movie is dark.

2838
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:00,093
It's one of those films where
you're like

2839
02:00:00,126 --> 02:00:01,562
"Just turn,
turn the light on!"

2840
02:00:01,595 --> 02:00:05,266
One of the girls finally clearly
sees one of the creatures

2841
02:00:05,299 --> 02:00:07,100
But it's from a distance.

2842
02:00:07,133 --> 02:00:09,436
(Creature growling)

2843
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:12,038
That shot has stayed
with me since I saw it.

2844
02:00:12,072 --> 02:00:13,674
The girls end up
turning on each other

2845
02:00:13,707 --> 02:00:15,476
And It's like so they're not
only fighting these monsters

2846
02:00:15,509 --> 02:00:16,810
But they're fighting each other.

2847
02:00:16,843 --> 02:00:19,112
When things start going bad,
you want to get out of the cave

2848
02:00:19,145 --> 02:00:21,515
But yet they're forced to keep
going deeper

2849
02:00:21,548 --> 02:00:22,816
And deeper into the cave.

2850
02:00:22,849 --> 02:00:24,451
There's an awesome sequence
where these two girls

2851
02:00:24,485 --> 02:00:25,952
Are stuck upside down.

2852
02:00:25,986 --> 02:00:28,355
And these girls are they're
like hanging from these hooks.

2853
02:00:28,389 --> 02:00:30,991
Crawling across the
ceiling, when they're attacked

2854
02:00:31,024 --> 02:00:33,994
By one of these things
that come running at them.

2855
02:00:34,027 --> 02:00:36,129
(Creature growling)

2856
02:00:36,162 --> 02:00:39,833
I saw this movie in a sold out
theater

2857
02:00:39,866 --> 02:00:42,235
And everyone
hit the roof.

2858
02:00:42,269 --> 02:00:44,538
Are you scared of
being caught in tight spaces?

2859
02:00:44,571 --> 02:00:46,072
Are you scared
of underground monsters?

2860
02:00:46,106 --> 02:00:48,108
If you're scared of either one
of those things,

2861
02:00:48,141 --> 02:00:49,376
It's covered in The Descent.

2862
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:54,047
(Creature growling)

2863
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:59,286
You are watching 50 Best
Horror Movies You've Never Seen.

2864
02:00:59,320 --> 02:01:02,323
A countdown of horror's
hidden gems.

2865
02:01:02,356 --> 02:01:07,260
And coming in at number
5? Alone in the Dark.

2866
02:01:07,294 --> 02:01:09,930
Alone in the Dark
is one of those

2867
02:01:09,963 --> 02:01:14,167
Classic 80s horror movie gems.

2868
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:17,504
It's kind of a
weird hybrid of slasher

2869
02:01:17,538 --> 02:01:20,907
Meets home invasion,
meets mystery.

2870
02:01:20,941 --> 02:01:22,843
Like a lot of horror movies,
Alone in the Dark

2871
02:01:22,876 --> 02:01:25,278
Kind of hinges
on you buying into one thing

2872
02:01:25,312 --> 02:01:27,013
That doesn't really makes sense.

2873
02:01:27,047 --> 02:01:29,049
The premise isn't the greatest
because

2874
02:01:29,082 --> 02:01:31,017
It's basically an insane asylum

2875
02:01:31,051 --> 02:01:32,853
Where security is all run by
electricity.

2876
02:01:32,886 --> 02:01:34,988
This place, as soon as the
electricity goes out,

2877
02:01:35,021 --> 02:01:37,358
Literally every inmate
breaks lose.

2878
02:01:37,391 --> 02:01:39,360
Nobody thought when
the electricity goes out,

2879
02:01:39,393 --> 02:01:41,662
All the crazy people
can get out?

2880
02:01:41,695 --> 02:01:43,063
Great plan!

2881
02:01:43,096 --> 02:01:44,765
They get most of
them back which is great

2882
02:01:44,798 --> 02:01:48,234
But of course a few manage to
wreak havoc

2883
02:01:48,268 --> 02:01:49,970
And kill a few innocent people,

2884
02:01:50,003 --> 02:01:52,406
All because these guys didn't
want to buy a generator.

2885
02:01:52,439 --> 02:01:54,441
Alone in the Dark
was New Line Cinema's

2886
02:01:54,475 --> 02:01:56,810
First major motion picture

2887
02:01:56,843 --> 02:01:59,480
And it featured
a star-studded cast.

2888
02:01:59,513 --> 02:02:00,581
Another great thing
in this movie

2889
02:02:00,614 --> 02:02:02,182
Is they had like an amazing cast
in it.

2890
02:02:02,215 --> 02:02:03,684
I mean Jack Palance was in it.

2891
02:02:03,717 --> 02:02:05,719
Jack Palance is
bigger in life than that.

2892
02:02:05,752 --> 02:02:10,724
Dr. Potter!!

2893
02:02:10,757 --> 02:02:14,761
HappyÉ trails.

2894
02:02:14,795 --> 02:02:15,996
Donald Pleasence was in it.

2895
02:02:16,029 --> 02:02:19,232
Donald Pleasence
plays his typically nutty self

2896
02:02:19,265 --> 02:02:22,035
But he runs this asylum where
he sort of lets the inmates

2897
02:02:22,068 --> 02:02:23,870
Kind of do whatever they want.

2898
02:02:23,904 --> 02:02:25,372
You ever watch a Halloween movie

2899
02:02:25,406 --> 02:02:27,908
And think what if
Dr. Loomis ran Smith's Grove?

2900
02:02:27,941 --> 02:02:29,610
That's what
Alone in the Dark is.

2901
02:02:29,643 --> 02:02:31,445
Forget Dr. Loomis from Halloween

2902
02:02:31,478 --> 02:02:33,647
Where he was practical
and carried a gun.

2903
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:36,617
In this one, he is as crazy
as the inmates

2904
02:02:36,650 --> 02:02:38,552
In the asylum he's running!

2905
02:02:38,585 --> 02:02:44,991
Move your hands, in front of
your face three times,

2906
02:02:45,025 --> 02:02:48,094
Like that.

2907
02:02:48,128 --> 02:02:51,231
Yes and then the
intestines will stay inside

2908
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:53,934
And you won't turn to porcelain.

2909
02:02:53,967 --> 02:02:58,038
And you have "The Preacher"
who's Martin Landau.

2910
02:02:58,071 --> 02:03:05,679
Vengeance is mine
saith the Lord.

2911
02:03:05,712 --> 02:03:07,848
Alone in the Dark and
Friday the 13th part three

2912
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:09,483
Were in production
at the same time

2913
02:03:09,516 --> 02:03:11,718
And both films actually have
a hockey mask.

2914
02:03:11,752 --> 02:03:14,821
Of course Jason's went on
to be quite more successful

2915
02:03:14,855 --> 02:03:17,558
But it's kind of interesting
now to look back and see

2916
02:03:17,591 --> 02:03:21,027
A film from the same era using
pretty much the same mask.

2917
02:03:21,061 --> 02:03:22,062
And there were
a couple of killers.

2918
02:03:22,095 --> 02:03:23,363
One of them was "The bleeder."

2919
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:26,733
The only way you know
him is when he gets a nosebleed.

2920
02:03:26,767 --> 02:03:29,736
(Horror music)

2921
02:03:29,770 --> 02:03:32,606
One of the escaped
mental patients in this movie,

2922
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:36,309
They call him "Fatty"
and he's like so big

2923
02:03:36,342 --> 02:03:39,546
That he will pick up people
by their necks

2924
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:42,415
And shake them around
like ragdolls.

2925
02:03:42,449 --> 02:03:45,118
(Horror music)

2926
02:03:45,151 --> 02:03:48,221
At one point they do go into
Friday the 13th's territory.

2927
02:03:48,254 --> 02:03:51,958
That, actually that is one
of the key slasher movie scenes.

2928
02:03:51,992 --> 02:03:53,860
Basically one of the inmates
is under a bed,

2929
02:03:53,894 --> 02:03:55,128
The couple is going at it.

2930
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:56,396
And this hand reaches out
from the bed,

2931
02:03:56,429 --> 02:03:57,898
And yanks him under it.

2932
02:03:57,931 --> 02:03:59,733
So she's screaming and scared
but she doesn't know what to do.

2933
02:03:59,766 --> 02:04:01,502
She doesn't want to jump off the
bed because they might get her

2934
02:04:01,535 --> 02:04:05,472
Also and this knife starts
shooting up through the bed.

2935
02:04:05,506 --> 02:04:09,743
(Woman screams)

2936
02:04:09,776 --> 02:04:11,912
But the studio wasn't
just going for gore,

2937
02:04:11,945 --> 02:04:14,180
They wanted to surprise
audiences

2938
02:04:14,214 --> 02:04:16,316
With a killer twist ending.

2939
02:04:16,349 --> 02:04:17,718
This was 1982.

2940
02:04:17,751 --> 02:04:19,319
It was really rare to
have like a good twist

2941
02:04:19,352 --> 02:04:20,854
And it usually just involved
some guy

2942
02:04:20,887 --> 02:04:22,789
Jumping out of something and
screaming

2943
02:04:22,823 --> 02:04:24,791
And the girl screaming and
people scream.

2944
02:04:24,825 --> 02:04:28,161
But this movie actually has a
brilliant twist,

2945
02:04:28,194 --> 02:04:30,463
You won't see it coming.

2946
02:04:30,497 --> 02:04:33,534
But it's an amazing
film, it's shot so well.

2947
02:04:33,567 --> 02:04:35,769
You have like A-list actors,
hamming it up

2948
02:04:35,802 --> 02:04:37,704
As like different kinds of
crazy.

2949
02:04:37,738 --> 02:04:39,372
The movie scared
the crap out of me.

2950
02:04:39,405 --> 02:04:41,341
(Man screaming)

2951
02:04:41,374 --> 02:04:44,811
Don't miss the
electrifying Alone in the Dark.

2952
02:04:44,845 --> 02:04:49,415
Coming in at number four is a
grim 1955 fairy tale,

2953
02:04:49,449 --> 02:04:51,384
The Night of the Hunter.

2954
02:04:51,417 --> 02:04:53,720
The Night of the
Hunter is a classic movie.

2955
02:04:53,754 --> 02:04:55,622
It's the only movie that
Charles Laughton ever directed

2956
02:04:55,656 --> 02:04:58,124
Which is a really cool
note about that movie.

2957
02:04:58,158 --> 02:04:59,760
I think it's a masterpiece.

2958
02:04:59,793 --> 02:05:02,095
Robert Mitchum is one of
these best performances.

2959
02:05:02,128 --> 02:05:04,030
Well I think The
Night of the Hunter is crucial

2960
02:05:04,064 --> 02:05:05,331
Not only for horror film fans

2961
02:05:05,365 --> 02:05:07,367
But for anyone who loves movies
period.

2962
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:10,370
It's one of the best movies ever
made.

2963
02:05:10,403 --> 02:05:12,372
Robert Mitchum
plays Harry Powell

2964
02:05:12,405 --> 02:05:14,808
And he's a traveling preacher.

2965
02:05:14,841 --> 02:05:17,544
The story of the film is
Harry Powell is arrested

2966
02:05:17,578 --> 02:05:18,812
For vagrancy or something like
that

2967
02:05:18,845 --> 02:05:21,582
And he overhears
a young Peter Graves

2968
02:05:21,615 --> 02:05:23,817
Tell the story right before
he's going to be hanged

2969
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:26,286
That he has buried a large sum
of treasure

2970
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:29,055
And only his children
know where it is.

2971
02:05:29,089 --> 02:05:32,793
Harry Powell gets out of
prison, finds the widow

2972
02:05:32,826 --> 02:05:36,496
And woos her and tries
to outsmart the widow

2973
02:05:36,529 --> 02:05:37,931
But the children know better.

2974
02:05:37,964 --> 02:05:40,967
It's a modern day fairy tale,
he is the big bad wolf.

2975
02:05:41,001 --> 02:05:43,269
These little children
are Hansel and Gretel.

2976
02:05:43,303 --> 02:05:47,407
What I like most about it
is that it's like a fairy tale.

2977
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:50,844
If you look at it for the
visuals alone,

2978
02:05:50,877 --> 02:05:52,579
You've got these two children
that are trying

2979
02:05:52,613 --> 02:05:56,182
To escape from this monster
and they're hiding out in barns

2980
02:05:56,216 --> 02:05:59,620
And they're going on a
little boat down the river,

2981
02:05:59,653 --> 02:06:01,087
And it's like the wicked witch.

2982
02:06:01,121 --> 02:06:06,593
It's very much an ethereal
fairy tale kind of a story.

2983
02:06:06,627 --> 02:06:09,696
It's very clearly
like a set and a stage

2984
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:12,599
But the world it creates
is so consistent and real

2985
02:06:12,633 --> 02:06:15,201
That it succeeds in that goal
of sort of creating a world

2986
02:06:15,235 --> 02:06:16,502
That you can escape from.

2987
02:06:16,536 --> 02:06:18,104
Even though it's
completely a fantasy world.

2988
02:06:18,138 --> 02:06:21,642
There's that wonderful,
beautiful sequence

2989
02:06:21,675 --> 02:06:23,309
When they are on the boat

2990
02:06:23,343 --> 02:06:27,748
And she sings that
kind of creepy song

2991
02:06:27,781 --> 02:06:29,750
But it's really touching.

2992
02:06:29,783 --> 02:06:32,452
The whole thing
about going after children

2993
02:06:32,485 --> 02:06:35,588
I think is really
macabre and creepy.

2994
02:06:35,622 --> 02:06:38,391
Child performances in horror
movies can be a real trick

2995
02:06:38,424 --> 02:06:41,995
And this is an example of a very
successful pair

2996
02:06:42,028 --> 02:06:43,296
Of child actors here.

2997
02:06:43,329 --> 02:06:45,398
You really care
about these two kids.

2998
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:48,201
I mean and they are in some
serious peril.

2999
02:06:48,234 --> 02:06:51,104
Just tell me,
where's the money hidden?

3000
02:06:51,137 --> 02:06:53,740
But that's why I
promised dad I wouldn't tell.

3001
02:06:53,774 --> 02:06:56,777
John doesn't matter!

3002
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:58,178
Can't I get that through
your head,

3003
02:06:58,211 --> 02:07:03,349
You poor silly
disgusting little wretch?

3004
02:07:03,383 --> 02:07:05,819
This movie influenced director
John Carpenter

3005
02:07:05,852 --> 02:07:07,120
When he made Halloween

3006
02:07:07,153 --> 02:07:09,990
And after you see it,
you'll know why.

3007
02:07:10,023 --> 02:07:12,492
Coming in at number 3,
is a nail-biting

3008
02:07:12,525 --> 02:07:17,430
80s monster classic,
The Beast Within.

3009
02:07:17,463 --> 02:07:19,866
The best horror
movie in this whole list

3010
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:21,768
Is of course The Beast Within.

3011
02:07:21,802 --> 02:07:23,069
The fact that I've directed it,

3012
02:07:23,103 --> 02:07:24,805
Has nothing to do with my
opinion.

3013
02:07:24,838 --> 02:07:26,472
It's sort of the
movie that would not die.

3014
02:07:26,506 --> 02:07:28,709
I have no idea
when I was making that film

3015
02:07:28,742 --> 02:07:31,444
That it would have the
life that it has had.

3016
02:07:31,477 --> 02:07:34,180
The Beast Within
is about this kid.

3017
02:07:34,214 --> 02:07:39,352
He has basically a beast
within that's going to come out

3018
02:07:39,385 --> 02:07:41,855
Like a cicada
and he's going to shed

3019
02:07:41,888 --> 02:07:45,158
His human skin
and become this beast.

3020
02:07:45,191 --> 02:07:47,093
There have been a number
of people over the years

3021
02:07:47,127 --> 02:07:51,431
Who have felt that the movie
does not make a lick of sense.

3022
02:07:51,464 --> 02:07:54,334
In the dialog throughout the
movie, a couple different places

3023
02:07:54,367 --> 02:07:58,038
There is actually
a coherent explanation

3024
02:07:58,071 --> 02:08:01,041
For why the whole cicada thing.

3025
02:08:01,074 --> 02:08:04,310
It shed a skin, like a cicada.

3026
02:08:04,344 --> 02:08:07,748
The life cycle of the cicada,
it's a 17 year life cycle.

3027
02:08:07,781 --> 02:08:09,415
That's why all the weirdness
starts happening

3028
02:08:09,449 --> 02:08:11,517
To my character when he is 17.

3029
02:08:11,551 --> 02:08:13,486
It's just awesome because you
can't wait for him

3030
02:08:13,519 --> 02:08:17,623
To turn into the beastÉ within.

3031
02:08:17,657 --> 02:08:20,927
The film offered a grungy
film style and broke new ground

3032
02:08:20,961 --> 02:08:24,064
With these innovative and
unprecedented special effects.

3033
02:08:24,097 --> 02:08:28,434
That kind of pure, gritty,
horror film

3034
02:08:28,468 --> 02:08:29,770
That they don't make anymore.

3035
02:08:29,803 --> 02:08:32,405
No CG at all, all practical
effects.

3036
02:08:32,438 --> 02:08:36,810
The video box that was daring
you to watch the last 30 minutes

3037
02:08:36,843 --> 02:08:38,578
Without running from your seat?

3038
02:08:38,611 --> 02:08:42,582
It's true because it is a
special effects extravaganza.

3039
02:08:42,615 --> 02:08:44,550
The idea was to make the
last half hour

3040
02:08:44,584 --> 02:08:46,119
As terrifying as possible.

3041
02:08:46,152 --> 02:08:49,756
The single weirdest scene
bar none

3042
02:08:49,790 --> 02:08:51,992
I have ever had
to do as an actor

3043
02:08:52,025 --> 02:08:55,095
Was in the infamous last half
hour of The Beast Within.

3044
02:08:55,128 --> 02:08:58,932
There was no way I was going to
have a stunt man play the beast.

3045
02:08:58,965 --> 02:09:00,733
No, no, no, I was the beast.

3046
02:09:00,767 --> 02:09:02,568
They didn't do that because
I wanted to be the -

3047
02:09:02,602 --> 02:09:05,471
I made that very clear that
I wanted to be the beast.

3048
02:09:05,505 --> 02:09:07,707
United Artists,
in their wisdom asked us

3049
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:09,475
To shoot in a mental asylum

3050
02:09:09,509 --> 02:09:11,912
But they'd promised me that
there'd be no inmates.

3051
02:09:11,945 --> 02:09:13,446
They said it was a disused
hospital.

3052
02:09:13,479 --> 02:09:15,949
We're up there shooting this
transformation scene

3053
02:09:15,982 --> 02:09:17,483
For three days
and I'm going through

3054
02:09:17,517 --> 02:09:20,686
All these
different stages of prosthetics.

3055
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:23,356
And when we
started shooting the stuff

3056
02:09:23,389 --> 02:09:25,125
And the tongue and the heads
exploding,

3057
02:09:25,158 --> 02:09:29,262
Then behind me I suddenly heard
"Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh."

3058
02:09:29,295 --> 02:09:32,765
When I turned around,
there were three inmates

3059
02:09:32,799 --> 02:09:35,235
From the mental asylum in
nutcase gowns.

3060
02:09:35,268 --> 02:09:38,704
And I suddenly realize they
thought this was their worst,

3061
02:09:38,738 --> 02:09:40,706
This is the operation
room, this is surgery

3062
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:43,009
Because we had lights like
this, lights like this.

3063
02:09:43,043 --> 02:09:45,411
I thought "Oh my God,
they think this is real."

3064
02:09:45,445 --> 02:09:48,849
These burly guys came in and
dragged them off screaming

3065
02:09:48,882 --> 02:09:50,550
And I've always
felt bad about this

3066
02:09:50,583 --> 02:09:53,786
Because I'm sure they
told all the other inmates

3067
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:56,389
"We've seen the room and that's
where they cut your head off"

3068
02:09:56,422 --> 02:09:58,358
"And they do experiments
on you."

3069
02:09:58,391 --> 02:10:00,994
Guess who is a
fan of The Beast Within?

3070
02:10:01,027 --> 02:10:03,463
Would you believe,
Queen Latifah!

3071
02:10:03,496 --> 02:10:06,499
I ran in to her one
time at a magazine stand

3072
02:10:06,532 --> 02:10:08,134
And she said,
"You look really familiar.

3073
02:10:08,168 --> 02:10:09,269
Do I know you?"

3074
02:10:09,302 --> 02:10:10,570
I said, "Well, I'm an actor,"

3075
02:10:10,603 --> 02:10:13,273
And she goes "Oh,
what have you done?"

3076
02:10:13,306 --> 02:10:15,641
"Well, when I got
to The Beast Within,"

3077
02:10:15,675 --> 02:10:19,779
Her eyes went like this
and she went, "Oh my god!"

3078
02:10:19,812 --> 02:10:21,081
"The Beast Within!

3079
02:10:21,114 --> 02:10:24,684
I love that - I've seen that
movie five times!"

3080
02:10:24,717 --> 02:10:27,520
"My brother and I used to
hide behind the couch!"

3081
02:10:27,553 --> 02:10:29,555
"You scared the crap out of us!"

3082
02:10:29,589 --> 02:10:33,493
(Horror music)

3083
02:10:33,526 --> 02:10:36,562
This magazine which I have a
lot of fun and respect for,

3084
02:10:36,596 --> 02:10:39,032
Rue Morgue magazine out of
Canada,

3085
02:10:39,065 --> 02:10:41,567
They recently referred to The
Beast Within

3086
02:10:41,601 --> 02:10:47,073
As "a criminally underrated
genre masterpiece"

3087
02:10:47,107 --> 02:10:50,476
Which I thought that's
pretty cool becauseÉ I agree.

3088
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:53,513
(Horror music)

3089
02:10:53,546 --> 02:10:55,115
Think of The Beast Within as a
twist

3090
02:10:55,148 --> 02:10:59,752
On a classic werewolf story,
with an entomological flair.

3091
02:10:59,785 --> 02:11:03,223
Earning the prestigious
number 2 spot on our list

3092
02:11:03,256 --> 02:11:07,427
Is the pulse pounding,
Pumpkinhead.

3093
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:11,231
If you like creature movies,
you will love Pumpkinhead.

3094
02:11:11,264 --> 02:11:15,468
There aren't a lot of
good backwoods horror films.

3095
02:11:15,501 --> 02:11:17,003
Pumpkinhead is one of the best.

3096
02:11:17,037 --> 02:11:19,272
Basically these
kind of jerky city kids

3097
02:11:19,305 --> 02:11:23,209
Go out into the backwoods and
they're riding their dirt bikes.

3098
02:11:23,243 --> 02:11:26,446
They start racing along
and they're zooping up and down

3099
02:11:26,479 --> 02:11:30,083
And Lance Henriksen's son
goes chasing after his dog,

3100
02:11:30,116 --> 02:11:31,584
Gets in between one of the
bikes,

3101
02:11:31,617 --> 02:11:33,753
Gets hit in the head and killed.

3102
02:11:33,786 --> 02:11:36,689
(Motorbike sound)

3103
02:11:36,722 --> 02:11:38,158
Lance Henriksen plays Ed Harley

3104
02:11:38,191 --> 02:11:40,060
Who's the father
of the boy who gets hit

3105
02:11:40,093 --> 02:11:41,962
And he goes into
this old witch, Haggis.

3106
02:11:41,995 --> 02:11:45,065
When I first saw that witch,
she scared the hell out of me.

3107
02:11:45,098 --> 02:11:48,301
He has her resurrect a
demon that they call Pumpkinhead

3108
02:11:48,334 --> 02:11:51,504
That's out in this pumpkin
patch buried in the ground

3109
02:11:51,537 --> 02:11:53,473
To extract revenge on the people

3110
02:11:53,506 --> 02:11:55,308
That accidentally
killed his son.

3111
02:11:55,341 --> 02:11:57,743
He plays such a broken character

3112
02:11:57,777 --> 02:11:59,845
And you could feel his
desperation.

3113
02:11:59,879 --> 02:12:02,748
He just has to do this.

3114
02:12:02,782 --> 02:12:05,185
The only catch is every
time the demon kills somebody,

3115
02:12:05,218 --> 02:12:06,652
Ed Harley feels it.

3116
02:12:06,686 --> 02:12:08,654
As the movie progresses he
starts realizing

3117
02:12:08,688 --> 02:12:09,922
What he's doing is wrong,

3118
02:12:09,956 --> 02:12:11,891
Vengeance in his
ultimate form is wrong,

3119
02:12:11,924 --> 02:12:13,293
And has to kind
of try to stop it

3120
02:12:13,326 --> 02:12:15,495
Before Pumpkinhead kills
all the rest of the kids.

3121
02:12:15,528 --> 02:12:18,431
He is a mean son of a bitch.

3122
02:12:18,464 --> 02:12:22,335
(Man screaming)

3123
02:12:22,368 --> 02:12:24,104
Part of Pumpkinhead's success

3124
02:12:24,137 --> 02:12:26,206
I think is that
it's directed by a man

3125
02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:29,342
Who made monsters for a living,
Stan Winston.

3126
02:12:29,375 --> 02:12:30,543
I love the monster.

3127
02:12:30,576 --> 02:12:31,944
I mean what can I say,
it's just one

3128
02:12:31,978 --> 02:12:35,281
Of the all-time greatest
movie monsters.

3129
02:12:35,315 --> 02:12:39,752
He creates a monster
that's so memorable, so evil.

3130
02:12:39,785 --> 02:12:41,721
Stan Winston got what was scary.

3131
02:12:41,754 --> 02:12:45,691
He goes back and taps into
something very primitive

3132
02:12:45,725 --> 02:12:48,928
And very child-like,
what is scary?

3133
02:12:48,961 --> 02:12:51,697
There's no CG in this movie,
it's all very practical.

3134
02:12:51,731 --> 02:12:54,734
No CG, that what you saw
was right there on the set.

3135
02:12:54,767 --> 02:12:57,370
You can't substitute, there's
no substitute for that.

3136
02:12:57,403 --> 02:13:00,173
The tangibility, you can
reach out and touch it

3137
02:13:00,206 --> 02:13:02,908
And it can reach out
and touch you.

3138
02:13:02,942 --> 02:13:04,044
There's a scene
where Pumpkinhead picks her up

3139
02:13:04,077 --> 02:13:05,611
And he basically cuts a cross

3140
02:13:05,645 --> 02:13:08,048
Into her forehead
with his nails.

3141
02:13:08,081 --> 02:13:10,016
It's very atmospheric,
It's very creepy all around

3142
02:13:10,050 --> 02:13:12,418
But for some reason that
scene was very primal.

3143
02:13:12,452 --> 02:13:15,988
It's just a great
spooky backwoods horror film.

3144
02:13:16,022 --> 02:13:19,892
And it's required viewing
for any casual horror film.

3145
02:13:19,925 --> 02:13:23,729
(Woman screaming)

3146
02:13:23,763 --> 02:13:29,402
If you think Alien was scary,
you haven't seen Pumpkinhead.

3147
02:13:29,435 --> 02:13:32,572
The time has come to
announce our number 1 movie

3148
02:13:32,605 --> 02:13:35,308
On our list of 50 Movies
You've Never Seen!

3149
02:13:35,341 --> 02:13:39,479
Ladies and gentleman,
behold! Black Christmas!

3150
02:13:39,512 --> 02:13:42,982
This movie started the
entire slasher genre

3151
02:13:43,015 --> 02:13:46,219
And continues to send icy chills
down the spines of horror fans

3152
02:13:46,252 --> 02:13:48,088
That discover it
year after year.

3153
02:13:48,121 --> 02:13:49,889
Black Christmas
is number 1 on the list

3154
02:13:49,922 --> 02:13:51,257
And there's a reason for that.

3155
02:13:51,291 --> 02:13:52,925
It was the first slasher film
and it's basically

3156
02:13:52,958 --> 02:13:56,196
About this sorority house where
they're being menaced

3157
02:13:56,229 --> 02:13:58,164
By some obscene phone caller.

3158
02:13:58,198 --> 02:14:00,566
The first time I saw Black
Christmas, I was in high school

3159
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:02,768
And it scared
the shit out of me.

3160
02:14:02,802 --> 02:14:05,538
Bob Clark was a very,
very underrated director.

3161
02:14:05,571 --> 02:14:08,241
He directed another classic
film called A Christmas Story

3162
02:14:08,274 --> 02:14:11,010
Which is the polar opposite
of what Black Christmas was.

3163
02:14:11,043 --> 02:14:13,113
It's all very Christmasy feeling

3164
02:14:13,146 --> 02:14:15,515
And yet there's this evil
that's lurking outside.

3165
02:14:15,548 --> 02:14:17,483
People, they might lump it in

3166
02:14:17,517 --> 02:14:19,319
With like Silent Night,
Deadly Night

3167
02:14:19,352 --> 02:14:21,287
And it's nothing like that.

3168
02:14:21,321 --> 02:14:23,256
It's a really dark ugly movie

3169
02:14:23,289 --> 02:14:24,990
Set on the happiest time
of the year.

3170
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:26,526
I love it for that reason.

3171
02:14:26,559 --> 02:14:28,994
I love the use of
this Christmas atmosphere

3172
02:14:29,028 --> 02:14:31,364
Which normally is supposed to be
something comforting

3173
02:14:31,397 --> 02:14:32,765
And jolly and so forth

3174
02:14:32,798 --> 02:14:34,700
And kind of just turning
it on its head.

3175
02:14:34,734 --> 02:14:37,370
The movie opens with a
point-of-view shot

3176
02:14:37,403 --> 02:14:39,739
Of these two hands crawling

3177
02:14:39,772 --> 02:14:42,408
Up the trellis
on the side of this house.

3178
02:14:42,442 --> 02:14:45,545
What this guy does is he makes
his way to top of the window

3179
02:14:45,578 --> 02:14:47,813
To the attic and
he lets himself inside

3180
02:14:47,847 --> 02:14:49,715
And he sort of camps out there.

3181
02:14:49,749 --> 02:14:51,684
What he ends up doing
is making phone calls

3182
02:14:51,717 --> 02:14:54,820
Down to the girls that live
in this sorority house.

3183
02:14:54,854 --> 02:14:58,258
I mean the telephone
calls are just so terrifying.

3184
02:14:58,291 --> 02:15:00,426
The phone calls will
make your hair on your body

3185
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:02,262
Completely stand on end.

3186
02:15:02,295 --> 02:15:05,365
This killer could have just
been this crazy man on the phone

3187
02:15:05,398 --> 02:15:08,634
But what Bob Clark does
is he layers the voices.

3188
02:15:08,668 --> 02:15:12,004
It's almost like there's three
voices talking at the same time.

3189
02:15:12,037 --> 02:15:15,341
What he does in doing
that is so chilling.

3190
02:15:15,375 --> 02:15:20,880
(Man laughing)

3191
02:15:20,913 --> 02:15:24,450
The filthiness, the
sleaziness of the phone calls

3192
02:15:24,484 --> 02:15:27,287
From this perverted phone
stalker.

3193
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:29,722
You're surprised that at the
time that the film was made

3194
02:15:29,755 --> 02:15:32,325
That it would have gotten away
with it

3195
02:15:32,358 --> 02:15:33,559
Because it's just so perverse.

3196
02:15:33,593 --> 02:15:34,960
It's more of a
detective movie in a way.

3197
02:15:34,994 --> 02:15:36,262
There's a lot of creepy scenes
in it

3198
02:15:36,296 --> 02:15:37,763
But it's really
about the characters.

3199
02:15:37,797 --> 02:15:40,032
Margot Kidder
like steals the show

3200
02:15:40,065 --> 02:15:42,635
As like kind of the lush house,
house sister.

3201
02:15:42,668 --> 02:15:45,405
She's like boozing it up all
the time and talks like a sailor

3202
02:15:45,438 --> 02:15:47,507
And she's hysterical.

3203
02:15:47,540 --> 02:15:48,808
Like she has this
really great line

3204
02:15:48,841 --> 02:15:50,075
Where she's sitting there
with a cigarette

3205
02:15:50,109 --> 02:15:52,978
And some guy
is calling on the phone.

3206
02:15:53,012 --> 02:15:55,248
She's like "Oh, put this,
put your",

3207
02:15:55,281 --> 02:15:57,350
And rub it in a light socket!"

3208
02:15:57,383 --> 02:15:59,151
Why don't you go find
a wall socket

3209
02:15:59,185 --> 02:16:00,253
And stick your tongue in it,

3210
02:16:00,286 --> 02:16:01,954
That will give you a charge!

3211
02:16:01,987 --> 02:16:03,623
You should just get all your
friends together

3212
02:16:03,656 --> 02:16:05,991
On Christmas Eve
and watch Black Christmas.

3213
02:16:06,025 --> 02:16:09,562
And you know, screw the Santa
Claus claymation shit.

3214
02:16:09,595 --> 02:16:11,297
Just watch Black Christmas
and get really drunk

3215
02:16:11,331 --> 02:16:13,199
And laugh at everything
Margot Kidder says

3216
02:16:13,233 --> 02:16:15,000
Because that's
the greatest character

3217
02:16:15,034 --> 02:16:16,569
I've ever seen in
a slasher film.

3218
02:16:16,602 --> 02:16:19,171
Although Margot Kidder
provides the comic relief,

3219
02:16:19,205 --> 02:16:20,640
It's only to protect you
from some

3220
02:16:20,673 --> 02:16:23,209
Of the scariest movie moments
of all time.

3221
02:16:23,243 --> 02:16:25,311
There's this great scene in the
film where one of the girls

3222
02:16:25,345 --> 02:16:26,812
In the beginning is supposed to
be heading home.

3223
02:16:26,846 --> 02:16:30,015
So she's up in her room and she
hears her cat meowing

3224
02:16:30,049 --> 02:16:31,384
Over in the closet and there's
this,

3225
02:16:31,417 --> 02:16:33,219
You know, point of view shot
behind the plastic

3226
02:16:33,253 --> 02:16:36,389
So you know that something
is probably there.

3227
02:16:36,422 --> 02:16:37,923
She gets closer and closer and
all of the sudden

3228
02:16:37,957 --> 02:16:39,859
The plastic like leaps out.

3229
02:16:39,892 --> 02:16:42,528
(Creature roaring)

3230
02:16:42,562 --> 02:16:46,932
The 1978 film Halloween
is clearly the benchmark film

3231
02:16:46,966 --> 02:16:48,368
That ushered in modern horror.

3232
02:16:48,401 --> 02:16:50,336
Without Halloween you
wouldn't have Freddy Krueger,

3233
02:16:50,370 --> 02:16:51,804
You wouldn't have
Jason Voorhees,

3234
02:16:51,837 --> 02:16:53,639
You wouldn't have Scream,
you wouldn't have Chucky.

3235
02:16:53,673 --> 02:16:57,142
It ushered in that
franchisable kind of horror.

3236
02:16:57,176 --> 02:16:58,444
Well, what people don't realize

3237
02:16:58,478 --> 02:17:00,212
Is that the director
of Halloween

3238
02:17:00,246 --> 02:17:03,583
Was friends of the director
of Black Christmas,

3239
02:17:03,616 --> 02:17:06,051
And Black Christmas did what
Halloween did

3240
02:17:06,085 --> 02:17:08,588
Four years before, in 1974.

3241
02:17:08,621 --> 02:17:11,891
And it really created
the template

3242
02:17:11,924 --> 02:17:13,225
That all those other movie,

3243
02:17:13,259 --> 02:17:14,827
Everybody thinks it's Halloween
that created

3244
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:16,496
The template
for that kind of thing.

3245
02:17:16,529 --> 02:17:18,163
In fact it created
two templates,

3246
02:17:18,197 --> 02:17:20,833
Not only the point of view
of the killer,

3247
02:17:20,866 --> 02:17:22,302
Seeing things through
the killer's eyes

3248
02:17:22,335 --> 02:17:25,070
And hearing the breathing and
doing that device,

3249
02:17:25,104 --> 02:17:28,974
But also
the killer is in the house.

3250
02:17:29,008 --> 02:17:30,776
The caller is in the house.

3251
02:17:30,810 --> 02:17:35,815
The calls are coming
from the house!

3252
02:17:35,848 --> 02:17:37,783
Jess, get out!

3253
02:17:37,817 --> 02:17:41,186
Well, several other movies
wound up doing riffs

3254
02:17:41,220 --> 02:17:42,388
On that one as well,

3255
02:17:42,422 --> 02:17:45,425
When A Stranger Calls?
Etcetera, etcetera.

3256
02:17:45,458 --> 02:17:47,493
Black Christmas did it first!

3257
02:17:47,527 --> 02:17:49,094
You know, and credit,
where credit is due!

3258
02:17:49,128 --> 02:17:50,763
If you're wondering
why the killer

3259
02:17:50,796 --> 02:17:53,699
Is stalking the sorority girls,
you're out of luck.

3260
02:17:53,733 --> 02:17:56,936
Director Bob Clark only
dangles sporadic clues

3261
02:17:56,969 --> 02:17:58,871
Which causes attention to
escalate.

3262
02:17:58,904 --> 02:18:02,074
You never find out who
the crazy guy is or what he did.

3263
02:18:02,107 --> 02:18:05,711
You never find out what
did Billy do with the baby.

3264
02:18:05,745 --> 02:18:07,813
Who is Agnes? I don't know.

3265
02:18:07,847 --> 02:18:08,981
You don't see the killer.

3266
02:18:09,014 --> 02:18:11,817
What you see are fleeting
glimpses of him.

3267
02:18:11,851 --> 02:18:15,054
You see a shadow,
you see a door closing.

3268
02:18:15,087 --> 02:18:19,158
You see an eyeball
in a crack of a door.

3269
02:18:19,191 --> 02:18:22,862
The killer is so menacing...
without you seeing him.

3270
02:18:22,895 --> 02:18:25,030
It's never revealed
exactly who the killer is.

3271
02:18:25,064 --> 02:18:26,432
You never really did
a good look at him

3272
02:18:26,466 --> 02:18:28,868
And I think that's actually
the fear of the unknown

3273
02:18:28,901 --> 02:18:30,770
Is what makes this film so
effective.

3274
02:18:30,803 --> 02:18:32,905
Let your imagination
fill in the blanks

3275
02:18:32,938 --> 02:18:35,775
And most of the time our
imaginations are much more

3276
02:18:35,808 --> 02:18:37,877
Terrifying than anything you can
put up on the screen.

3277
02:18:37,910 --> 02:18:40,846
Black Christmas is one
of my favorite horror movies.

3278
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:42,281
I'm going to say it's
a masterpiece.

3279
02:18:42,314 --> 02:18:43,883
I'm going to just say
it's a masterpiece

3280
02:18:43,916 --> 02:18:46,085
And even Elvis loved it.

3281
02:18:46,118 --> 02:18:47,319
He used to watch it
on Christmas.

3282
02:18:47,353 --> 02:18:48,554
It's one of the scariest movies

3283
02:18:48,588 --> 02:18:49,922
And if you haven't seen it,
shame on you.

3284
02:18:49,955 --> 02:18:50,923
Go out and rent it
right now.

3285
02:18:50,956 --> 02:18:52,124
Stop this DVD.

3286
02:18:52,157 --> 02:18:53,626
Go rent it,
you can watch this later.

3287
02:18:53,659 --> 02:18:58,063
Black Christmas to me
is the highest standard

3288
02:18:58,097 --> 02:18:59,399
Of slasher films.

3289
02:18:59,432 --> 02:19:02,702
There's just so many classic
horror movie moments

3290
02:19:02,735 --> 02:19:04,103
In Black Christmas

3291
02:19:04,136 --> 02:19:05,638
That have been imitated
time and again.

3292
02:19:05,671 --> 02:19:06,939
Black Christmas just doesn't
receive

3293
02:19:06,972 --> 02:19:08,273
The credit that it deserves.

3294
02:19:08,307 --> 02:19:10,776
I personally can see

3295
02:19:10,810 --> 02:19:13,379
Why that would be the
number 1 movie on your list.

3296
02:19:13,413 --> 02:19:15,415
Talk about influential, wow.

3297
02:19:15,448 --> 02:19:19,385
It just set a major
ball rolling, didn't it?

3298
02:19:19,419 --> 02:19:20,786
(Man screaming)

3299
02:19:20,820 --> 02:19:23,923
(Female screaming)

3300
02:19:23,956 --> 02:19:26,659
I'm P.J. Soles and it's
been an immense pleasure

3301
02:19:26,692 --> 02:19:28,961
Introducing you to 50
classic horror films

3302
02:19:28,994 --> 02:19:31,030
That I know you'll love.

3303
02:19:31,063 --> 02:19:33,899
These movies totally helped
shake the horror genre

3304
02:19:33,933 --> 02:19:36,035
And they continue to draw
critical praise

3305
02:19:36,068 --> 02:19:37,336
And cult followings,

3306
02:19:37,369 --> 02:19:38,938
So start exploring!

3307
02:19:38,971 --> 02:19:40,339
Many of the movies are available

3308
02:19:40,372 --> 02:19:44,209
As special editions
with deleted scenes.

3309
02:19:44,243 --> 02:19:46,412
Thank you for watching!

3310
02:19:46,446 --> 02:19:48,380
