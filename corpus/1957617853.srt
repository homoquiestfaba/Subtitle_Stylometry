1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:03,912
In nature,

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:08,124
a watering hole is like a local tavern
or pub.

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:13,380
Sooner or later, residents from all over
the neighborhood end up there.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,424
Most come to drink.

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,352
Others to hunt.

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:24,107
Some are just passing through.

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,820
And others come to linger.

8
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,732
This is the story of one particular
watering hole

9
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,367
in downtown Manhattan.

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,246

- He tells me he wants
to bring this girl over

26
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,391
to our parents house for dinner

27
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,643
I said, "Okay big deal"

28
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,154
He says but she's black, but not too black.

29
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,024
I say, "All right, how black?"

30
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,109
He goes, "She looks Spanish or Italian".

31
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,445
I say "Fuck it, bring her over".

32
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,739
So anyway, he shows up
with this girl, right?

33
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,366
She is black as night.

34
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,286
Nobody says nothing through
the whole dinner, you know?

35
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,914
You know me Sal, I'm not prejudiced.
I don't give a shit what people are.

36
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,550
Just pissed he fucking lied to me.

37
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,668
Russell!

38
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,379
Burnzy! Sally!

39
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,090
Uh oh, here we go.

40
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,762
I dream of Genie with the pomade hair.

41
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,265
Sally, can I buy these
boys a delicious cocktail?

42
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,726
Having an early lunch, Russell?

43
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,195
No, a late breakfast,
following through to lunch.

44
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,990
I'll have a Dewars and soda..

45
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,362
Yeah. All right. How much?

46
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,616
I've been a CPA, that's a Certified
Public Accountant, for over 20 years

47
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,043
now, and I just can't imagine
how the guy does it.

48
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,623
I deal with numbers all day long,
but once I'm done, that's it.

49
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,593
It all washes away, with a little help.

50
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:01,806
Well, it takes a special kind of guy
to be a bookie who don't use paper.

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,592
It's a gift.

52
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,269
Eugene is gifted.

53
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,021
-Shut the fuck up!

54
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,440
No, not you, asshole.

55
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,392
- Good afternoon.

56
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,726
May I have a very, very
dry Tanqueray martini,

57
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,436
May I have a very, very
dry Tanqueray martini,

58
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,813
straight up.

59
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,908
Two olives and just wave the Vermouth

60
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,119
And may I also have some water?

61
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,872
Pepe little man, what's wrong?

62
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,124
You're not paying attention.

63
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,578
Sit.

64
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,379
Now you're paying attention.

65
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,581
Sal.

66
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,166
How can you stand her?

67
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,251
That rat dog on the bar.

68
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,381
- So I let her bring her dog
in, what's the big deal?

69
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,172
She's out of her mind.

70
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,432
And you got a clean bill of mental health
Eugene?

71
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,101
You're a softie Sal. Patience of a saint.

72
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,887
What do you care, Gene?

73
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,181
She don't bother nobody.

74
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,857
Unlike yourself.

75
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,894
- You know, you should think
about changing your lifestyle a little.

76
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,437
Smokin, drinkin. Think
about a career change.

77
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,280
You could lose a few pounds.

78
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,773
- I do all right.

79
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,859
I'm gonna get my weight down
when I was in the service.

80
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:03,910
- You was in the service?

81
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,903
- Hell yeah.

82
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,820
- Coast Guard.

83
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,071
- The Coast Guard?

84
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,740
(men laughing)

85
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,574
- Fuck you.

86
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,409
What the fuck do you guys do huh?

87
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,411
What the fuck have you ever do huh?

88
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,455
Goddam coast kept you safe.

89
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,748
You didn't even know it man.

90
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,042
- I did four years in the Air Force

91
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,920
and two years in the
north motherfucking pole.

92
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,129
- No way.
- Hell yes.

93
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,964
57 to 59.

94
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,633
I counted every fucking day.

95
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,134
They sent all the bad niggers

96
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,969
and fuck ups to the north pole

97
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,272
The great white north
with little black dots.

98
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,058
Man you never seen cats more out of place

99
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,018
than them brothers up there.

100
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,103
The weather is for you snow monkeys.

101
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,064
Black man is made for the equator.

102
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,816
(men laughing)

103
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,618
(blues guitar music)

104
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,246
- Hey Burnzy, Sal.

105
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,499
I take a Finlandia martini straight up,

106
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,334
better yet just throw it
on me and light a match.

107
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,169
Burnzy get ready to call 911,

108
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,505
this is gonna be front page suicide.

109
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,798
How do you like that Sal?

110
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,800
Your bar all over the cover of the Post.

111
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,594
Cop Snaps - Torches Himself in Gin Mill.

112
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,721
(Burnzy laughing)
You know, forget the martini,

113
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,515
I'll just take a beer.
And put a collar on it,

114
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,600
I want a little foam on my nose.

115
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,602
So I get a call for cardiac arrest

116
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,646
over at the karate school on Lafayette.

117
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,065
I get there before the EMS guys.

118
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,733
There's a guy turned blue.

119
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,068
Now he's alive, he's awake,

120
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,486
but he's had a heart attack.

121
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,155
You know, he's talking, he's
a young guy, he's my age.

122
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,782
So the EMS guys show up.

123
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,243
Now there's this one asshole EMS guy.

124
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,786
I mean, he's a bodybuilder, you know,

125
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,788
with the short hair and a
ponytail, you know what I mean?

126
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,747
A real freak.

127
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,249
So he's talking to the blue guy,

128
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,543
the guy's got an irregular heartbeat.

129
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,378
So the EMS guy takes out the paddles

130
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,504
to start to give them a shock.

131
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,715
I said, "Wait a minute,
you can't shock him."

132
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,258
"This guy's awake."

133
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,092
"Aren't you to suppose to do that"

134
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,927
"only if you don't got a pulse?"

135
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,722
So the ponytail says, "He's
got an irregular heartbeat."

136
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,150
"This will help straighten it out
and it's procedure "so back off".

137
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,103
Everybody backs off.

138
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,646
They give him a shot with the paddles

139
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,440
and bang he's fucking dead.

140
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,567
- Jesus Christ.

141
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,035
- Bang, they hit them again.

142
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,154
Again,

143
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,447
again.

144
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,740
Now the bodybuilder's sweating,

145
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,243
'cause he's fucked up big time
and I'm standing right there.

146
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,037
So I had to radio his supervisor.

147
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,607
Think this guy is whacked on steroids.

148
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,374
- Jesus Christ, that stupid bastard.

149
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,917
- I think it's crazy anyone
who would wanna live here,

150
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,169
instead of the country.

151
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,881
- Well then again, serial
killers all live in the country.

152
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,507
You live next to a guy.

153
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,801
He looks normal driving his pickup.

154
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,304
His front lawn is all manicured.

155
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,890
Next thing you know, he's in the news.

156
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,142
There's 20 little kids
buried under his house.

157
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,101
You know what I mean?

158
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,145
Now that could never happen in New York.

159
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,563
- You're absolutely right Burnzy.

160
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,397
- Get out of here.

161
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,524
- No, I'm serious, you know why?

162
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,193
'Cause we have Supers.

163
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,320
The building Supers are so fucking nosy.

164
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,114
The first body you got
rid of they’d turn you in.

165
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,824
Sniffing around the garbage.

166
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:01,079
Hey there's body parts in that hefty bag.

167
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,747
Looks like it's from 3F.

168
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,083
Call the cops.
- Get the fuck out of here.

169
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,386
- Believe me the real freaks
live out in the country.

170
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,556
- Well I gotta clock out now.

171
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,196
( rhythm and blues guitar music )

172
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,859
How you doing?
- What's your name?

173
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,077
- Sal.

174
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,695
- Sal?

175
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:38,408
(everyone laughing)

176
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,952
My name is Gertrude.

177
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,370
- Gertrude.

178
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,705
- Could I get you something Gertrude?

179
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,257
- Yes please.

180
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,677
Cappuccino please.

181
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,349
- Sure.

182
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:56,968
Coming right up.

183
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,512
You want cinnamon or chocolate on that?

184
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,930
- Cinnamon.

185
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,191
Could I have a Coca-Cola too please?

186
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,521
(speaking in a foreign language)

187
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,851
(speaking in a foreign language)

188
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,950
Can I have a beer also please?

189
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,994
(rhythm and blues music)

190
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,240
(speaking in a foreign language)

191
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,033
- I knew it was too good to be true.

192
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,452
- I don't care.

193
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,420
I'm in love with her, warts and all.

194
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:29,300
(speaking in a foreign language)

195
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,305
(rhythm and blues music)

196
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,767
- Sal?

197
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,893
(laughing)

198
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,478
Sal.

199
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,776
I have to be leaving now.

200
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,701
(rhythm and blues music)

201
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,805
- So I says to her don't you eva,

202
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,642
eva put your friggin hands on him again.

203
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,686
- She is such a pig.

204
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,729
- Ladies.

205
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,649
- I'll have a vodka diet Coke.
- I don't know what I want,

206
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,776
make hers first, I got to think about it.

207
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,402
- God, you never know what you want.

208
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,071
- So I'm careful.

209
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,906
- Order a drink, put a condom on it.

210
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,040
We're paying separate.

211
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,703
- I'll have a Bay Breeze.

212
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,879
- Don't make them.

213
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,083
- You can't make me a Bay Breeze?

214
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,918
- I don't have any pineapple.

215
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,178
- All right, I'll have a Pina Colada.

216
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,514
- [Sal] Nope.

217
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,852
- You know how to make
a sex on the beach Sal?

218
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,286
-hmmmm

219
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,147
OK.

220
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,732
Give me a draft, light.

221
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,060
- All of that for a beer?

222
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,436
Are you going to do this at Club Med?

223
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,188
'Cause let me tell you,
if you try to pull this

224
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,108
at Club Med, this is how far
you're gonna get with me.

225
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,659
- This guy is sitting in this joint

226
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,487
and this babe walks in,
sits right across from him.

227
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,281
He buys her a drink, they talk.

228
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,117
He says, "My wife doesn't
like having sex with me.

229
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,702
"She thinks I'm too kinky".

230
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,580
So the babe says, "Wow what a coincidence",

231
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,623
"My husband thinks I'm too kinky too.

232
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,166
"We never have sex anymore.

233
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,168
"I'm just dying to have some".

234
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,714
He says, "Great, let's
go back to your place"

235
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,757
So they go back to her place,

236
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,384
he's laying on her bed.

237
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,269
She says, "I'll be back in a minute".

238
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,763
So she goes into the bathroom,

239
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,849
she puts on all this leather gear,

240
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,904
handcuffs, a bullwhip, high
heels, everything right?

241
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,690
She comes out of the bathroom
and the guy's dressed.

242
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,984
She says, "How come you're dressed?"

243
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,320
He goes, "Hey, I just fucked your poodle,

244
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,039
"shit in your pocket
book and I'm outta here".

245
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,076
- He met some slut at
a bar on the East side

246
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,578
and he goes home to her place

247
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,788
and they're laying around drinking wine

248
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,625
and he sees she's got a fireplace.

249
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,918
So to make it more romantic,

250
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,545
he goes out to buy some firewood

251
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,422
at the Koreans around the corner.

252
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,341
Something he would never
do for me, of course,

253
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,509
but for one night with some whore,

254
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,595
he goes out to get the firewood.

255
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,138
He's a little drunk.

256
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,391
He starts back to her apartment,
ready to set the mood.

257
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,561
And he can't remember
what apartment building.

258
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,063
- It serves him right.

259
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,316
- So wait, that's not all.
He came over to my apartment,

260
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,861
drunk and stunned with
an armful of firewood.

261
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,196
I don't have a fireplace.

262
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,989
He was in shock.

263
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,948
(friend laughing)

264
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,034
Wouldn't let go of the wood.

265
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:50,910
(men laughing)

266
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,828
- You got the hockey game on?

267
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,038
- There's no hockey on now.

268
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,916
- Channel 21 my friend, exhibition match.

269
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,377
Bruins versus the Ruskies.

270
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,588
- You're betting on exhibition hockey?

271
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,131
- Start me a tab will ya?

272
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,015
- No tabs.

273
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,426
- Sal, Sal, more ice over here,

274
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,761
I wanna cut a deal with you.

275
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:09,595
We come in right?

276
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,013
Bring in the boys.

277
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,724
Have a few drinks, have a good time.

278
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,018
Then, you know,

279
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,145
I put a C note on the bar.

280
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,397
Everything's taken care of.

281
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,898
You do what you want with it,

282
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,901
boss doesn't have to
know, everybody's happy.

283
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:24,944
- Can't do it Minsk.

284
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,986
- What's the matter?

285
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,030
Make it up as you go along.

286
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,116
- I do that anyway.

287
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,662
- This is why Minsky is the
big bucks guy that he is.

288
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,665
He hustles bartenders, old ladies.

289
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:38,999
Cripples.

290
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,210
- Think about it Sal.

291
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,678
Think about it.

292
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,922
(hockey game announcers)

293
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,183
-Shit.

294
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,468
- Man I got a yard on this with Eugene,

295
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,020
I'm fucked if this goes under.

296
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,859
No, no, no, no.

297
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,653
Unbelievable.

298
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,198
No.

299
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,577
Time is on my side.

300
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,996
This is Luke we're talking about.

301
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,999
Luke, does not go down easy.

302
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,543
- Hockey stinks on ice.

303
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,588
- Life is a lot like hockey.

304
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,840
It's like you watch them
fight and scramble around

305
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,301
for this puck that nobody
can see half the time.

306
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,303
It's fast like life.

307
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,680
It happens and you don't see it coming.

308
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,140
You fight like crazy,

309
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,935
hustling and bang, checked
against the boards.

310
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,979
Woof, stick in the ribs, goal.

311
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,949
It's very fast, very violent

312
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,026
and very exciting.

313
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,069
- And very stupid.

314
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,454
Baseball pally.

315
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,449
A gentleman's game with a history.

316
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,992
Baseball.

317
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,494
- Baseball's for pussies,

318
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,753
it's boring.

319
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,756
(hockey game announcers)

320
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,133
- Shit.

321
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,595
It's over.

322
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,891
Hey man, you are one of my bad luck charm.

323
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,680
Sal, if Eugene shows up,
you haven't seen me, okay?

324
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,898
- You were never here.

325
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,060
- And you didn't see me neither.

326
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,945
- What makes you think I care?

327
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,363
- I'll catch you next time, Sal, okay?

328
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,247
- Yeah right.

329
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,662
- Tight wad.

330
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,171
50 cents.

331
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,874
Now you'll be able to buy that newspaper

332
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,217
you always wanted Sal.

333
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,921
That guy is no good, no good.

334
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,472
It’s like water off a duck's back.

335
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,474
A chump is a chump.

337
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,608

338
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,818
or fuck me on the first date,

339
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,236

- I don't know Kevin.

341
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,239
It sounds like you're
getting reamed on this one.

342

Tommy, Joey, Billy?

beans on the side okay?

346

- [Sal] You got beans in
the inside of your head.

347
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,415
- Get a fucking personality pal.

348
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,299
- Kevin, come on.

349
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,209
What's your gut feeling

350
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,796
about the deal with this guy?

351
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,090
- My gut feeling is not a gut feeling.

352
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,593
It's a feeling in my ass
and I'm getting fucked.

353
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,554
-Why don't you fuck him in the ass first?

354
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,055
-I don't have the grease.

355

We were just talking about you.

Weren't we just talking?
I was just telling her about you.

00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,071
This is Danny, my friend Danny.
- Hi Danielle. - What the fuck happened?

360
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,275
- What happened?
That's a good question.

361
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,693
We're all losing our ass a little bit,

362
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,320
but listen, just hold on,

363
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,822
take it easy, take it easy.
You didn't lose your money.

364
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,199
First of all, let me give
you a little philosophy.

365
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,200
I'm trying to make you some money.

366
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,703
Stock is not something that
you're gonna lose your money.

367
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,538
It's there.
It's a piece of fucking paper.

368
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,040
It's a, what's a metaphor?

369
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,207
Give me a metaphor.

370
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,834
- It's a garden.
- It's a fucking garden.

371
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,002
You put the seed in, you leave it there.

372
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,171
You don't fucking check
the fucking seed every day,

373
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,006
to see how the fucking corn's

374
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,299
gonna grow two inches.
- You gotta let it grow.

375
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,383
- You let it grow and all of a sudden

376
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,302
in a fucking year you go,
you got an ear of corn.

377
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,596
You got a whole fucking garden.
Now let me tell you.

378
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,430
- What's you say?

379
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,264
You said three months.
- The Hong Kong thing.

380
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,474
I gave him the Hong Kong railroad.

381
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,559
You got how many fucking
Chinese are there?

382
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,686
Billions of fucking people
riding around on bicycles.

383
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,520
They're gonna build a railway.

384
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,773
I got you a blue fuckin chip stock man,

385
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,566
in 10 years that thing's
going to make you,

386
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,400
that's like CBS.

387
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,234
It's it's $10.

388
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,527
I got him $10 in the fucking share.

389
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,571
- It's not a cash machine.
- You don't put the card in.

390
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,114
- The fucking thing's gonna
be in a couple of years

391
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,825
a 300, it's a blue, do you
know what a blue chip stock is?

392
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:42,701
- I know what a blue chip stock is.

393
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,953
- A blue chip stock, that's what you got.

394
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,787
Where are my beans?

395
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,046
I said beans on the side.

396
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,384
- Two New Amsterdams please.

397
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,642
- Got ID fellas?

398
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,930
- I don't got mine with me.

399
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,764
- It's all right, forget it.

400
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,648
Five dollars

401
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:07,901
- Thanks man.

402
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,030
I love this place, man.

403
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,315
It's such a dive you know?

404
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,116
- Yeah.

405
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,833
- Quite a crowd tonight.

406
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,493
I'm waiting for someone.

407
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,869
If he doesn't get here soon,

408
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,121
I'm going to skitdaddle.

409
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,956
This is 200 Thompson Street, right?

410
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,374
- Right.

411
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,551
- I just wanna make sure
I'm in the right place.

412
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:34,628
My name's Jackie.

413
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,587
- Sal.

414
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,423
- I used to bartend.

415
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,849
Yeah, I know what it's like.

416
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,472
Those guys are pretty scary.

417
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,391
- It's the hair club for men.

418
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,810
(Jackie laughing)

419
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,104
- So what else do you do besides tend bar?

420
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,439
Are you an actor or musician?

421
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,116
- This is it.

422
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,820
- Well that's OK. I
ah.. I didn't mean to...

423
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,580
- You don't have to do anything else.

424
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,907
It's just, you know, when I was doing it,

425
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,576
I couldn't wait to get out,

426
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,037
the people, the hours,
the booze, you know?

427
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,923
The money's good, but you really earn it.

428
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,721
I'm waiting for a friend I
haven't seen in a long time,

429
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,638
I'm nervous.

430
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,440
- Two shots of Jagermeister please.

431
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,479
- [Minsky] Three months.
- Hold on, hold on. Shh shh.

432
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,563
- You got your money.

433
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,399
Do me a favor, don't sell this stock.

434
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,233
Leave it.

435
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,735
I am gonna make you so much fucking,

436
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,570
you wanna take a flyer?

437
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,946
- What have you got?

438
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:43,997
- All right.

439
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:45,741
I got a stock.

440
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,534
This is almost like you
read in the fucking paper.

441
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,368
Inside information.

442
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,337
I can lose my ass on this, but listen.

443
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,667
-You gotta keep this under.

444
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,835
- I got a stock.

445
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,420
It's a natural gas.

446
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,463
It's a Canadian stock.

447
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,590
They're building a pipeline
from fucking Toronto

448
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,550
all the way across Canada.

449
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,428
Now look, you read the
papers, California's in shit.

450
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,556
The whole fucking state,
riots, earthquakes.

451
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,390
- Fires.
- Fires, droughts,

452
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,225
The whole thing.

453
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,059
It's an energy crisis.

454
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,268
What they're gonna do
is they're gonna start

455
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,354
shipping natural gas from Canada.

456
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,106
They're gonna fucking
fund the whole energy

457
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,774
of California on this one gas line.

458
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,868
I got at $5.

459
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,069
It's a, what is it, $5?

460
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,404
- Five dollars?
- Five fifty..

461
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,406
I guarantee in a year it's gonna be $20.

462
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,409
I'm putting what, 30,000?
What did you put in?

463
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,244
- You sold your co-op.

464
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,537
- I sold my fucking co-op.

465
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,497
Look, I'll tell you something right now.

466
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,707
When the broker puts his own money in,

467
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,157
you know, it's a fucking sure deal.

468
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,971
- We go to school at NYU and
live at the dorms over there.

469
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,466
- College boys.

470
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,594
What are you studying to be bankers?

471
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,595
- No, no, film.

472
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,055
- Film?

473
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,905
- What kind of jobs can
you get from the film?

474
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,652
You will run a one hour a photo?

475
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,647
- No.
We make movies.

476
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,066
- So you going to be movie stars huh?

477
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,276
Like Victor Mature?

478
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,410
- No directors.

479
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,322
- I aint been to the movies in a while,

480
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,116
used to go all the time,

481
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,909
Westerns mostly.

482
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,286
Go see the Duke.

483
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,079
Hank Fonda.

484
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,748
In My Darling Clementine.

485
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,666
- John Ford.

486
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,500
- Huh?

487
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,626
- He directed it, John Ford.

488
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,211
- Oh yeah?

489
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,255
Well what do you know, I didn't know that.

490
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,265
I guess school pays off huh?

491
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,512
- This place has a story on every stool.

492
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,389
You take that stoll you're sitting on,

493
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,016
Now that's the stool where Sniffy Barnes

494
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,902
keeled over and died after one drink.

495
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,354
Last drink.

496
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,366
Now here's a guy who's a no
good souse all his life.

497
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,695
Every day he'd drink a
rot gut whiskey and beer,

498
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,405
day in and day out.

499
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,741
So finally he gets religion

500
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,827
and he starts to stop drinking.

501
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,412
For six months, he goes to church.

502
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,414
He's good to his wife and kids,

503
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,926
puts on clean clothes,
shows up at work on time.

504
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,963
One night, we come down here

505
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,007
and he decides he wants to go with us,

506
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,217
but he's not drinking.

507
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,726
Just tomato juice.

508
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:15,933
So we have a few and
he's starting to sweat.

509
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,353
We ain't paying much
attention, drinking our beers.

510
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,813
So he figures, I'll have a Bloody Mary.

511
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,816
What the hell, it aint the rot gut stuff

512
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,151
he's used to drinking.

513
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,195
And he won't even taste the vodka.

514
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,114
So the bartender sets him up,

515
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,868
knocks back the Bloody Mary and whammo.

516
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,213
He hits the floor like a
ton of bricks, stone dead,

517
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,590
massive coronary or something.

518
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,126
- Whoa.

519
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,670
Man.

520
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,881
- That's what they say,
but you know what I think

521
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,883
killed Sniffy Barnes?

522
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:50,767
- What?

523
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,602
- The quota.

524
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,013
- The quota?

525
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,224
- Everybody's got a quota
as to how many drinks

526
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,018
you can have in a lifetime.

527
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,737
Sniffy Barnes drank his quota.

528
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,732
If he'd stayed in the straight narrow,

529
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,451
he'd probably be alive today.

530
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,288
He just had one drink over the line.

531
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,165
- What about your quota?

532
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,043
- Well that's why I have short beers.

533
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,503
Chipping away.

534
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,290
Takes longer.

535
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,333
Guys like Sniffy are pigs,

536
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,544
drinking up as much as they can.

537
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,888
Not knowing how close they're getting.

538
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,310
I think I just have a little time yet.

539
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,937
But you never know.

540
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,433
- Think about it.

541
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,267
Think about it.

542
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,268
I wanna make you some money,

543
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,102
but think about it.

544
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:42,936
- How much?
- Think about it.

545
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,146
Think about it.
- How much?

546
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,439
Well, how much?

547
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,273
- I don't know.

548
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,324
I'd put in 20 at least.

549
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,485
- I'll put three.

550
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,320
- Three?

551
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,696
- Put in five, come on, write out a check.

552
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,282
I wanna make you some money, I feel bad.

553
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,116
- You got a pen?

554
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,951
You fucking children are gonna thank me.

555
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,828
Just write out for five thousand dollars

556
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,922
I'm gonna quadruple your fucking money.

557
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,000
- How does this thing work?

558
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,376
5,000 in three months,

559
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,587
I guarantee you're going to have $20,000

560
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,005
and then you're going to be coming here

561
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,423
and you're gonna be buying me drinks

562
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,682
from Mr fucking personality.

563
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,595
What's $5,000 to you?

564
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,971
- $5000 to me?
- You're going to make

565
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,056
a lot of money.

566
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:19,890
I'm kidding you man.

567
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,185
Don't ever lose your sense
of humor Minsky, okay?

568
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,312
Come on, I'm
gonna make you a lot of money.

569
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,396
I promise.

570
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,230
- Trust him.

571
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,398
- Trust me Minsky.

572
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,649
I'm gonna make you money.

573
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,443
All right, take it easy.
[Minsky] You make me sick.

574
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,402
I'm going to make your money

575
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,946
you bald headed, cock sucking Jew.

576
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,039
Oh.

577
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,785
- Who from?

578
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,163
- The hair club president.

579
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:47,417
- A note too, getting kind
of high school around here.

580
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:52,305
If your date don't show,
I could fill in for him?

581
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,688
Tell him thanks but no thanks.

582
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,444
- So what'd she say?

583
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,565
- She said, "Thanks but no thanks".

584
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,402
- Stuck up bitch, fuck her. Fuck her.

585
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,153
- You're a smooth Minsky.

586
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,697
Why don't you show her your money clip?

587
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,574
- Sal, give her this, give her this.

588
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,575
- Why don't you take the hint Minsk?

589
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,203
- Give her this, give her this.
- Why don't you give it to yourself?

590
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,621
- Cause it's Sal's job.

591
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,331
- Go to the fucking post office.

592
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,500
Does he look like a fucking post man?

593
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,709
He's a bartender.

594
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,544
- Oh really?

595
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,096
Then can we have another round bartender?

596
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,382
- Burnzy.

597
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,384
- What's the matter
Francis, what's the matter?

598
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,760
Just calm down and tell me.

599
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,470
- Them kids pushed me.

600
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,639
My bike's gone now with all my stuff.

601
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,725
- All right, don't worry Francis,
we'll get the bike back.

602
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,145
Sal would you do me a favor?

603
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,856
- Ahh, my Holy Bible, my eight ball juice!

604
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,982
- Eight ball juice?

605
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,817
- Yes eight ball juice.

606
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,735
It's inside the eight,

607
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,321
you know, future unclear, try again.

608
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,906
- Oh, I know what he's talking about.

609
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,700
I had one, an eight ball of course,

610
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,951
you ask it your future.

611
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,244
I had one in high school.

612
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,579
- Yeah no eight ball juice.

613
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,963
It's just a juice.

614
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,750
- Me and Larry will look for it.

615
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,043
- We will?

616
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,545
- What you're too busy drinking beer.

617
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,971
You can't help this guy out?

618
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:17,933
- All right.

619
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,511
What color is it?

620
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,054
- It's a beautiful blue bike.

621
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,306
- That's right.

622
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,057
You can't miss it.

623
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,144
It's a big blue tricycle

624
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:33,690
and it's got reflectors
and bumper stickers

625
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,275
and there's a big tool box in the back

626
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,152
where he keeps all his stuff.

627
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,612
- Wait a minute.

628
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,156
What if these guys still got it?

629
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,158
- We take it back,

630
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,034
what are you chickening out?

631
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,452
- I'm just not sure I
want to be this involved.

632
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,578
Shouldn't we let the cops handle it?

633
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,538
- So somebody robs a handicap guy

634
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,873
and you've got a question in your head

635
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,875
as to whether or not
you want to be involved?

636
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:52,709
Come on.

637
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,213
- Now, Francis, these boys
are gonna look for your bike.

638
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,047
Okay?

639
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,716
Now you and I will stay
here until your sister comes

640
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,010
and they're gonna find it all right?

641
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,053
- Thank you boys.

642
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:03,887
- We're on the job.

643
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,022
You gotta promise to give
us a ride, if we find it.

644
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,568
- High and low the
search begins, all right?

645
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,821
-Good luck fellas.

646
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:26,793
- Bartender.

647
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,042
I'll have a Lillet of the rocks please,

648
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,594
with a slice of orange.

649
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,422
- That's disgusting.

650
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,599
- Oh please.

651
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,009
I don't bite.

652
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,302
- Knock that off okay pal?

653
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,854
This ain't the kind of joint.

654
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,598
- Oh, what kind of joint is it?

655
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,475
- It's a man's joint.

656
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,977
- Well then I'm in the right place,

657
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,530
I'm enjoying my drinks in
a good companies of mens.

658
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,191
- Doesn't it break your mother's heart

659
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,150
to see you dressed like that?

660
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,028
- Honey, my mother showed
me how to dress like this.

661
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,906
So don't you be casting no
aspersions on my mother.

662
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,033
I grew up in South Philly
and I'm man enough to whip

663
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:10,253
any man's ass who talks
trash that includes my mama.

664
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,999
- Take it easy lady.

665
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,458
Take it easy.

666
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,919
It's a free country.

667
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,965
You wanna dress like a
girl, dress like a girl,

668
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,174
all right?

669
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,559
No skin off my ass.

670
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,804
- And a skinny ass at that.

(old school hip hop music )

672
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,140
- All right, all right.

673
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,851
- You got to serve somebody

674
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,853
And baby you just been serv-ed.

675
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,064
You guys, you gonna
let this lipstick wearing

676

You know what I'm gonna have to do

677
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,358
if you say that word, huh?

678
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,569
-What word? What word?

679
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,820
-Everything alright down here?

680
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,115
- I'm good. I'm good.

681
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,909
Couple drinks. This is
good. Just need some drinks.

682
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,952
Another round Sal OK?

683
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,912
And you drinkin?

684
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,914
Yeah whatever um...

00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,124
-Marla.

686
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,259
-Marla wants.

687
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,473
- I'll have a Lillet on the rocks
with a slice of orange please.

(old school hip hop music )

689
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:14,234
- How are you Sal, you old teetotaller?

690
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,613
Let me have a

You look tired man.

693
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,663
Why don't you let me buy you a drink?

694
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,823
No?

695
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,958
I'm buying.

Hey Burnzy is this your escort tonight?

699
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,803
You get around pretty good for a tin can

She's a lovely girl.

Maybe Burnzy here's your father figure.

703
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,525
Most likely though her grandfather figure.

00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,510
But your time is passing.

715
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,304
You are getting old old man

716
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:38,309
and who will take your
burden when you're gone?

717
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,655
Who will carry the torch

718
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,607
for Burnzy?

719
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,159
Perhaps Sal.

720
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,820
Would you believe,

721
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,742
that there was a time when I... me... I,

722
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,455
used to take his pissed-in pants off.

723
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,957
He was positively incontinent,

724
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,959
clean him up, put him in bed.

725
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,881
Tilt his head over to the side
so he wouldn't suffocate

726
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,966
on his own puke.

727
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,976
But I got one question for you, Sally.

728
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:18,266
How the hell can you work in a bar

729
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,727
when you don't drink anymore?

730
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,562
I mean, Jesus Christ.

731
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,897
We all gotta make a living,

732
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,115
but this is ridiculous.

733
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,368
What's the fucking deal Sally?

734
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,997
You know what I want Sal?

735
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,458
I want your drink.

736
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,044
The one you break your pledge with.

737
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,914
The one when you're all alone,

738
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,916
and nobody's gonna find out,

739
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,926
give me your drink Sally.

740
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,561
I'll give you my fucking drink.

741
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:00,900
Have a drink Andre.

742
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,537
Knock yourself out.

743
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:14,989
- What's the matter Andre?

744
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,126
Did you have something else in mind?

745
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,128
-Ira

746
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:33,049
You have just got to let me
do something with that rug.

747
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,310
It's a train wreck of hair piece.

748
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,345
- What do you mean hair piece?

749
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,805
This ain't a rug.

750
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,598
- Oh baby, honey, please.

751
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:44,018
If that ain't a rug, then
I'm General Colin Powell.

752
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,728
- Oh my God.

753
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,355
Secret's out.

754
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,565
Ira's wearing a wig.

755
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,899
Oh, baby, I can

756
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,652
I could whip that racoon in the shape
if you let me.

757
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,946
You know, if there's one thing
in this world I know is wigs.

758
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,489
Well Patty LaBelle use to call me

759
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:00,827
all hours a day and night
just to get my secret of suckscess.

760
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,746
Now come here
Ira, don't make me chase you.

761
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,958
Bartender, Bartender, another Lillet please

762
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,918
and a round for my mens friends here.

763
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:13,473
Don't worry, baby, I learned
all my beauty skills in jail.

764
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,559
- Well Sal, I've been stood up.
- Well Sal, I've been stood up.

765
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,636
I can't believe I waited this long.

766
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,430
I know it better. I know it better.
Well it was nice meeting you,

767
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,181
I'll have to draw by next
time I'm in town, yeah?

768
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,566
- Are you going to be okay?

769
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,437
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

770
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,367
I'm not very good at
picking the men in my life.

771
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,700
- Married?
-Hmm?

772
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,987
- Briefly, you?

773
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:36,779
- No.

774
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,780
- Really?

775
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,582
- Why are you surprised?

776
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,043
- You're a mighty handsome lady.

777
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,169
- Thank you.

778
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,547
How long were you married?

779
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,082
- A couple of years.

780
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,709
Don't remember it too well.

781
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,252
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

782
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,212
- It's okay, no problem.

783
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,131
It's just that I really don't remember it.

784
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,183
It's a bit of a fog.

785
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,511
Days of wine and roses,
if you know what I mean.

786
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,013
- Got ya.

787
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:02,805
- Could I buy you drink or something?

788
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,973
- Yeah.

789
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:04,807
Yeah, sure.

790
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,393
[ Hair Club laughing ]

791
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,437
- He should take like a chain

792
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,438
to the bed.

793
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,190
You think of chaining him to the bed.

794
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,399
No, chain his nose here

795
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,901
nobody steals your nose,
you know what I mean?

796
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,819
Stop.

797
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,389
- They pick him up on satellite radar.

798
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,116
- He's a bag boy for
a Slovaks supermarket.

799
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,284
- And where do you live?

800
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,203
- 419 Hudson Street, apartment 4F.

801
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,580
New York, New York,
one zero zero three five.

802
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,541
- Always remember that, so
you don't get lost or nothing.

803
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,260
-Yeah.

804
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,170
- Francis.

805
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,179
Hi Burnzy.

806
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,423
Thanks for looking after him.

807
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,132
I hope he hasn't been a problem.

808
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,218
- No problem at all.

809
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,304
- He gets harder to keep
track of as he gets older,

810
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,890
you're going to be awake all
night, drinking those sodas.

811
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,976
What were you doing out so late?

812
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,395
You're supposed to come home after work.

813
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,105
You missed your favorite program.

814
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:55,400
- Oh Police Blotter! Ah!

815
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,443
- He gets around on that bike.

816
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,696
I worry about him, he's such a target.

817
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,240
I get reports of him
being up past 14th street.

818
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,702
- I can't believe that
anybody would bother him.

819
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:09,247
It's not like that bike
was valuable to them.

820
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,916
- To tell the truth, I'm
kind of glad it's gone.

821
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,876
He's so hard to keep track of.

822
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,928
- Some kids went to look for it.

823
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,799
- What am I gonna do with you?

824
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,467
Let's go home.

825
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,636
Maybe those boys will find your bike.

826
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:24,554
- Yeah.

827
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,388
- Thanks again.

828
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,348
- It was nice meeting you Francis.

829
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,933
When I'm in town, I'll do
my shopping at Slovaks.

830
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,143
Maybe I'll see you?

831
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,561
- On Police Blotter.

832
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,488
- Let's hope not.

833
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,859
- Jesus Christ Burnzy, you're still here.

834
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,610
- I'm still here?

835
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,862
What the hell you doing here?

836
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,821
- I go down to the station house,

837
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,364
I'm just about to punch my card,

838
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,000
when a detective from
homicide start grilling me.

839
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,203
So he asked me if I happen
to know a bookie on my beat,

840
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,997
by the name of fat Eugene Fisher.

841
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,207
I said, "No, I don't know
any bookie named Eugene".

842
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,375
Then it hits me.

843
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,209
Wait a minute.

844
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,879
That stiff over at the karate
school I was talking about,

845
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,172
that's the guy.
- Eugene?

846
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,256
- What, you know him?

847
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,340
- Oh Jesus.

848
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,884
He was here this morning.

849
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:03,593
- Wait a minute.

850
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,802
There's a bookie hangs out here,

851
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,012
and you guys don't tell me nothing?

852
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,347
- [Burnzy] We can't rat the guy out.

853
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:12,226
- Yeah well, he was working
as a snitch for the detective.

854
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,521
Well don't matter now,
it all died with him.

855
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,399
That EMS knucklehead shot
the life right out him.

856
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,034
- Oh Jesus Christ.

857
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:22,779
Well, here's to fat Eugene.
Well, here's to fat Eugene.

858
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,074
You're a jerk, and a chisler and a snitch.

859
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,083
God help you anyway.

860
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:27,867
Here here.

861
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,743
(glasses clinking)

862
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,627
- Cheers.

863
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,464
- Fuck him.

864
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,016
- Hey Sal, did you hear?

865
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:52,900
- Luke.

866
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,521
- Jackie, how long have you been here?

867
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,438
- Since 7 o'clock.

868
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,440
Since the time you were
supposed to meet me.

869
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,943
- Oh Jackie, I can explain.

870
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,528
I'm so sorry.

871
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,780
- This is just the guy
you were waiting for?

872
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,614
- Not you again.

873
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,657
Don't you ever go home?

874
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,075
- Yeah I can't believe it either Burnzy.

875
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,952
See what I mean Sal?

876
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,078
What is wrong with me?

877
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,704
- Really, Jackie,

878
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:14,831
I can explain.

879
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,666
Don't be mad.

880
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,836
A lot has happened tonight,
that you just wouldn't understand.

881
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,754
Come on let's go somewhere
and get a bite to eat.

882
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,339
I can explain over dinner.

883
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,466
- It's a little late, I think
I understand you pretty well.

884
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,718
A lot can happen in one night.

885
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,595
I was just on my way home, thank you.

886
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,139
I have a plane to catch in the morning

887
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,181
and it's been a very long day.

888
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,600
- Stay for one drink, I'm flush.

889
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,562
I hit it big today, my big break.

890
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,689
Hey Sal, set everybody up.

891
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,357
- I'm going home.

892
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,525
Goodnight Burnzy.

893
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,359
Night Sal.

894
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,444
- Hey, wait a minute, Jackie.

895
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,821
You don't understand.

896
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,614
Would you listen to me please?

897
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,742
See, I was into this
guy for a lot of money.

898
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,538
I was in serious danger
of having broken kneecaps.

899
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:59,667
As it turns out, Eugene
didn't keep any books or marks.

900
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,836
He kept it all in his head.

901
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,588
So my debt died with Eugene.

902
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,216
That was like a gift from God,

903
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,185
taking Eugene out.

904
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,846
- Gift from God.

905
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,730
Thanks Sal.

906
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,775
Call me sometime.

907
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,573
- I think your luck is changing.

908
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,783
- Give me a Stoli rocks Sal.

909
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,870
- You know, kid life is a lot like hockey,

910
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,790
fast, unpredictable,
you never see it coming.

911
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,792
Very exciting.

912
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,794
- Go home old man.

913
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,596
- Why don't you quit while you're ahead?

914
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,476
- One thing I never do,

915
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,437
is let a babe spoil a hot streak.

916
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,605
Another one Sal.

917
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,440
- You know, you're dumber
than you look pally,

918
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,068
letting a lady like that wait around.

919
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,071
That's a lucky break,
you ain't getting again.

920
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,781
- What's with you, man?

921
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,699
Is this your job here or something,

922
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,910
handing out free advice?

923
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,370
I mean you think because you're old,

924
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,247
you got the right to run everybody down

925
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,749
with your tired old philosophy huh?

926
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,876
I mean, if you're so God damn smart,

927
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:27,338
why don't you kicking back in
some estate in Bermuda, huh?

928
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,173
Why aren't you the president?

929
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,175
You think just because you
managed to live this long

930
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,302
and not get croaked that
you deserve a medal?

931
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,262
Huh

932
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,097
It's no wonder, it can't be much risk

933
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,349
sitting in one place the whole time.

934
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,483
- You'd be surprised.

935
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:45,690
- It is all about risk, it's chance.

936
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,235
I'm not sitting around
waiting for death to come,

937
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,654
I'm going to be out there face first

938
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,781
and if I go down in flames,

939
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,491
that's the chance you take

940
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:59,420
and Luke does not go
down easy my friend, no.

941
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,541
I got a hot streak going

942
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,835
and I'm wasting it here talking to you.

943
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,255
- Well you better get
going on that hot streak.

944
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,799
Wouldn't wanna see you burst
into flames right here.

945
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,884
- Here you go Sal.

946
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,511
Hey, thanks.

947
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,521
I told you I'd get you next time.

948
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,850
Hey, don't go nowhere old man,

949
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,902
you still got some time left.

950
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,578
Yeah what about it?

951
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,171
It's my birthday.

952
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:28,968
-[Sal] Burnzy.

953
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,096
Last call.

954
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,467
Yeah I didn't think I'd
be closing up the joint.

955
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,511
Haven't done that in years,

956
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,896
not since,

957
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,942
Ah never mind.

958
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,403
- Did you say it's your birthday?

959
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,273
- Yeah it's my birthday.
- Happy birthday.

960
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,691
Why don't you say something?

961
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,986
- Come on Sal, I'm 75.

962
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,863
Why would I?

963
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:04,211
The last time I had a
really happy birthday was,

964
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,426
65 years ago.

965
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,599
I'll never forget it.

966
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:21,887
My brother took me to the Polo Grounds,

967
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,606
to see the Giants play.

968
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,309
That game was amazing.

969
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,111
Giants lost, but I didn't care.

970
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:34,400
My brother saved up milk bottle caps

971
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,277
for three months

972
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,289
and got two free tickets to
take me to see the Giants.

973
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,411
What a guy

974
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,455
and he was tough too.

975
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,458
After the game we were walking home

976
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,335
and we decided to go to the Tarzan place

977
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:54,378
where all the kids hang out.

978
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,130
It's just outside of the stadium

979
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,099
in a deep gully by the Harlem River.

980
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,888
It was a perfect summer night.

981
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,856
I can smell it.

982
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,895
And all the kids were
swinging around on the rope

983
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,315
doing the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan call,

984
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:19,403
the original, not the
phony stuff you got now.

985
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,280
And each kid was taking a turn

986
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,533
and I was like the youngest guy there.

987
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,701
(Burnzy laughing)

988
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:29,246
And there were a couple
of creeps with slingshots

989
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:32,875
dressed like sports hanging around there.

990
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,920
So, my turn comes

991
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,757
and I swing as hard as I can,

992
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,133
'cause I want to show those other kids,

993
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:44,053
I may be small, but I'm tough too

994
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,639
and just as I get to the peak,

995
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,559
whack, a rock from a
slingshot, right in my back.

996
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:54,688
I fall off the knot on the
rope and I hit the ground.

997
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,315
And my brother's right there.

998
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,859
He shouts up at these sports,

999
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,361
standing over us on the hill

1000
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,947
and he says, "Who did that?"

1001
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,824
I'm crying and crying.

1002
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,826
And the biggest guy in the group,

1003
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,870
he looked like

1004
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,539
Dutch Shultz or something.

1005
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,583
He's standing there with
a sling shot and he says,

1006
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,961
"Me, what about it?"

1007
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:21,090
And my brother starts up that hill.

1008
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,008
I can see it still

1009
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,677
his hands, his fingers

1010
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,679
puffed up into fists

1011
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,682
and he walks right up to that guy,

1012
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,892
bam, whack, bang.

1013
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,861
(Burnzy laughing)

1014
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,273
Everybody is stunned.

1015
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:40,943
He beats the crap out of that guy.

1016
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,112
And the wise guy's friends
won't even help him.

1017
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,113
They're in shock.

1018
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,490
He's getting such a whipping.

1019
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,077
(Burnzy laughing)

1020
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,288
Ah yeah.

1021
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:57,092
My brother didn't take crap from nobody.

1022
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,764
He was a hell of a guy.

1023
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,185
Ain't it amazing?

1024
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,188
You take a guy like Eugene.

1025
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,191
I mean, nobody gives
a shit that he's dead.

1026
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,988
He ain't dead 24 hours
and people are happy he's gone.

1027
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,820
You know I thought that when you go,

1028
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,498
I mean you know.

1029
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,423
Don't mind me, I'm just a little.

1030
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,419
Just give me my tab Sally.

1031
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,296
- No tab Burnzy, happy birthday.

1032
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,515
- Oh no.. its..

1033
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,811
Thanks.

1034
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,439
Well, better get to bed.

1035
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,311
Just another guy crying in his beer.

1036
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,904
(Burnzy chuckling)

1037
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,907
See you tomorrow.

1038
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,451
- You gonna be okay Burnzy?

1039
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,245
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

1040
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,708
Beat that quota one more day.

1041
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,919
Happy birthday.

1042
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:16,505
Thanks Sal.

1043
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,260
