1
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,230
Marcus!

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,070
No! Colin!

3
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,350
A warrior came to us without a clan.

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,890
He fought for us, he died for us.

5
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,790
He lived as a stranger, but in death he is a Highlander.

6
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,970
From today onward, he shall be known as our brother Colin MacLeod of Clan MacLeod.

7
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:54,420
After a century of terrorism and global warming, the earth has fallen into chaos and decay.

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,970
Nations have been replaced by city states, armed fortresses ruled by would-be kings and demagogues.

9
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,170
Life is cheap and death comes easy...

10
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:17,390
save for some

11
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,480
The immortals that live among us...

12
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,330
For them, death comes only when you take their heads.

13
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,860
This is the story of one immortal...

14
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,990
...Colin MacLeod.

15
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,200
And his everlasting search for vengeance.

16
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,430
Don't you ever quit?

17
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,800
Get lost!

18
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,690
You're the one who's lost!

19
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,410
Who the fuck are you?

20
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,070
I'm looking for someone.

21
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,070
Who's this?

22
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,940
Fresh meat.

23
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,530
You got balls!

24
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,090
But no brains.

25
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,900
I... am Malike.

26
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,340
Have you come to take my head and collect the reward?

27
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,120
You're not who I want.

28
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,240
Ain't that a shame?

29
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,510
'Cos I'm the one you got.

30
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,050
No one has to die today.

31
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,070
Don't...

32
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,210
Run!

33
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,300
Get it! Do it!

34
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,620
I've lived a thousand years boy.

35
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,400
I've killed a hundred like you.

36
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,780
And, there can be only one!

37
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,320
Time to die!

38
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,170
Kill him!

39
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,100
No, this can't be!

40
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,270
W-Who are you?

41
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,990
Colin MacLeod...

42
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,230
...of the Clan MacLeod!

43
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,900
Beautiful.

44
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,420
But not perfect.

45
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,430
Just like this city...

46
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,550
A quickening! An immortal has lost his head.

47
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,480
Feeling better?

48
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,340
Take it easy. His power must have really turned you on.

49
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,810
Shut up, Amergan!

50
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,870
You're lucky I'm already dead, or that could have killed me.

51
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,280
You're trespassing!

52
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,600
Your address citizen of the city with the travel pass or you're dead.

53
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,870
Which is it?

54
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,870
Careful, pal.

55
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,380
Check him!

56
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,090
What's in the bag?

57
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,470
Oh, what?! Damn!

58
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,100
I'll take my money.

59
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:36,470
Malike's killer has come to collect his reward.

60
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,570
What do you think?

61
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,200
About the sculpture or Malike's killer?

62
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,770
Here's you money. Now you have to come with me.

63
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,770
Why?

64
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,950
Our commander wants to thank you, personally.

65
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,600
Tell him to write me a letter.

66
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,100
I have my orders.

67
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,720
Discretion is the better part of the fellow.

68
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,070
Buzz off.

69
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,600
What happened here?

70
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,780
The virus killed most of them.

71
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,630
Floods, pollution and bad genetic engineering did the rest.

72
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,610
The virus kill rate is about 80%.

73
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,920
You wanna keep your ass safe, you'll get vaccinated.

74
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,680
Not my problem.

75
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,210
This is fine. I'll get out here.

76
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,520
Ah, yeah? But this isn't a cab friend.

77
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,540
I'm not your friend.

78
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,010
Yeah?

79
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,720
Maybe you'd rather be dead.

80
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,870
Fuck you!

81
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,260
Man, who're you?

82
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,970
I'm Joe and around here I'm the man.

83
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,050
Whatever you need, I got.

84
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,810
Food, clean water, a woman...

85
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,030
Whisky...

86
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,320
Hey, that's easy.

87
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,520
Rudy's bar, down by the peer.

88
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,000
Look for the cow's head.

89
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,910
Just tell him Joe sent you.

90
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,020
Wow, thanks a lot!

91
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,170
Hey, what's your name anyways?

92
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,800
Colin.

93
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,270
Who is he?

94
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,770
Did you see who is that guy?

95
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,770
Nothing from up here.

96
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,770
Did you see that?

97
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,770
He kicked their asses...

98
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,870
...and he gave me 100 bucks.

99
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,570
Huh, useless...

100
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,570
Just useless.

101
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,570
Dahlia?

102
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,970
All the money in the world won't save you from the virus.

103
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,070
Just leave the bottle, pal.

104
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,450
Yo, Dahlia. You're late.

105
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,310
Not today.

106
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,820
You got two choices:

107
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,550
You can give it up, or I can take it.

108
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,210
That's a good girl.

109
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,020
No!

110
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,760
You got two choices Freddy.

111
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,530
You can leave now, or you can carry your little friend home in a paper cup.

112
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:54,980
You!

113
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,610
Go home Freddy!

114
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,510
Whatever!

115
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,820
Thanks.

116
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,250
How's business?

117
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,270
It sucks! We are losing ground.

118
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,700
Yeah, I hear ya.

119
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,940
If someone doesn't give, and soon already, then we're all dead.

120
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,070
Hey, you don't need that.

121
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,810
All you need is me.

122
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,130
What did you say?

123
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,550
I say don't need that.

124
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,580
All you need is me.

125
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,290
And if you need more of an invitation than that...

126
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,240
...you're not the man I thought you were.

127
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,500
Hoi, to our fearless leader!

128
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,540
Who has less trouble conquering Romans...

129
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,170
...then he does with his wife!

130
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,180
That'll be enough of that.

131
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:23,970
To freedom!

132
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,970
TO FREEDOOOM!!!

133
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,370
To glory!

134
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,070
TO GLOOORYYY!!!

135
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,780
In the name of honour!

136
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,770
HONOOOUUUR!!!!

137
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,690
Now we have our own business to take care of.

138
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,170
Ah, do we now?

139
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,570
We do.

140
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,950
As the gods hear my witness...

141
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,170
...I will love no other till the day I die.

142
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,860
Which will be tomorrow.

143
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,320
What...

144
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,340
Marcus Octavius leads 2000 legionnaires.

145
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,560
You lead 400.

146
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,290
You have no chance.

147
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,570
Well, then how about giving me a proper farewell?

148
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,820
You think this is a joke?

149
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,520
When my father chose you to lead us,
it was not supposed to be to our deaths.

150
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,340
You think he'd want us to run?

151
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,070
He'd want us to live.

152
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,270
Live yes, but not as slaves.

153
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,670
He'd never want us to live as slaves.

154
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,670
Moya, our lives are a small price to pay for our honour.

155
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,930
Then let us drink to our victory.

156
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,830
To victory!

157
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,920
I love you.

158
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,320
You are my life.

159
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,170
Colin...

160
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Moya...

161
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,920
I...

162
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,400
M-Moya...!

163
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,990
Forgive me.

164
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,300
What's your business woman?

165
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,790
The name is Moya and my business is with Marcus Octavius...

166
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,670
...and not his watchdog.

167
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,170
I could rape and kill you and no one will care.

168
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,450
That's enough!

169
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,770
Yes sir!

170
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,320
Do you read, Moya?

171
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,970
No.

172
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,120
Pity.

173
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,780
There are things men have written of such beauty and wisdom.

174
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,970
So, beauty and wisdom, can they tell me why Rome must destroy my people?

175
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,570
Because it is the way of nature.

176
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,370
We are the superior civilization.

177
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:42,060
One day, the entire world, will know the peace of Rome.

178
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,350
You Romans, you talk of peace when all you do is kill.

179
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,280
I know you're not here just to insult me.

180
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,250
I am here to beg for the lives of my people.

181
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,830
Generally, such requests are accompanied by tribute.

182
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,690
Truly a gift from the gods.

183
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,130
And, my people?

184
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,380
They're already destroyed.

185
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,430
Our destiny must be served.

186
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,670
Then, serve this...

187
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,470
It can't be!

188
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,160
Such a waste.

189
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,660
I could've given you Rome.

190
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,770
But now, you will watch everything you love...

191
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,620
...die tonight.

192
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,170
No, no!!

193
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,580
Attack! Attack!!

194
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,710
God, give me strength.

195
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,170
To Colin!

196
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,920
No, Moyaaaaa!

197
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,720
Moya, it's me.

198
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,470
Do you hear me? Oh god, come back.

199
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,690
Colin...

200
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,570
Moya.

201
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,770
Hey, you're alive.

202
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,270
Oh, the gods be praised.

203
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,270
Oh Moya, I have to get you out of here.

204
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,270
Colin, swear...

205
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:54,520
Colin, you must swear to me you will not seek revenge.

206
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,470
It will only bring you death.

207
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,670
No.

208
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,970
Colin...

209
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,880
Swear to me.

210
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,720
I swear.

211
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,240
Oh Colin, I love you...

212
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:22,300
I swear! I swear they will pay for this.

213
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,970
I will avenge you all.

214
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,340
I told you don't need that.

215
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,560
What you need is me.

216
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,090
Huh?

217
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,320
Huh, what?

218
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,450
Nothing, just go away.

219
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,830
Look Mister, I saw what you did on the street, okay?

220
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,600
They'll be coming back, dozens of 'em.

221
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,820
You wanna live, come with me.

222
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,370
All right, trust me or don't trust me.

223
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,410
You're the one who'll be dead.

224
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,040
Hey Mister, sounds like you better trust someone.

225
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,290
This will only take a minute.

226
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,540
You think anyone is listening?

227
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,760
I take you don't believe in God.

228
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,360
Take a look around. If there is one, he's an uncaring sadistic bastard.

229
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,770
Don't blame God.

230
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,990
Global warming, war, pollution...

231
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,600
If it looks like hell to you, we did it to ourselves.

232
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,070
Hey, if we could get rid of the bastard that controls the city...

233
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,760
...we might have a chance.

234
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,470
Please do not stop until you reach your destination...

235
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,000
Terrorist incidents have dropped 15% in the last quarter.

236
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,070
Pacification is almost complete.

237
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,970
Next on the agenda, city expansion to 14th Street.

238
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,980
As you will note, we are on schedule.

239
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,670
Here are our latest qualifications pending your approval.

240
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,950
I'll look at these later.

241
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,470
Commander, was there something you wanted?

242
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,650
Where are we?

243
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,770
I trust we are still on track.

244
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,050
I understand sir.

245
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:14,520
However, in a chemical reaction of this complexity there are variables...

246
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,920
...that the less understood and controlled could lead to catastrophe.

247
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,220
You have until the end of the day.

248
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,800
But, sir...

249
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,820
I was a little slow today.

250
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,620
Sorry.

251
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,670
Ah, but the stroke was perfect.

252
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,970
And you... are perfect.

253
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,470
But I was nothing... till you found me.

254
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,420
Remember?

255
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,750
Of course.

256
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,770
Are you... God?

257
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,530
Close enough.

258
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,280
You are immortal.

259
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,370
You will serve me for eternity.

260
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,670
Besides, you really are much too beautiful to kill.

261
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,320
Show me your gratitude.

262
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,690
What is it?

263
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,010
Commander, Malike's killer has escaped.

264
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,050
Well, find him.

265
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:21,070
Kill him if you have to but I want his head attached to his shoulders.

266
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,260
Yes, sir.

267
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,200
Should I help them?

268
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,750
No, this is more important.

269
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,670
Come on, this way.

270
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,670
It's a secret entrance.

271
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,170
Soldiers can't track us down here.

272
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,170
Welcome to our world.

273
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,760
I'm still hungry.

274
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,910
Sorry, we're out of it. More's coming in tomorrow.

275
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,460
We still have soup.

276
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,210
I hate rat soup.

277
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:23,730
Next.

278
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,800
Your call.

279
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,770
You got my stud?

280
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,220
Yeah, you got it.

281
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,460
Why do you live down here?

282
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,390
Only the obedient assholes live in the tower.

283
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,950
And they own the whole damn city.

284
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,310
Those bastards also control the vaccine.

285
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,820
Fewer get sick underground. It betters our chances.

286
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,770
Dahlia!

287
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,350
You're back.

288
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,910
Doc, how's Cerul doing?

289
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,820
Not good.

290
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,870
Without vaccine...

291
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,320
...she doesn't have a chance.

292
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,870
The virus is killing her.

293
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,600
This is the guy all the commotion's about?

294
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,020
That's him.

295
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,830
Home.

296
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,340
Come on in.

297
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,760
Scotch, gin, bourbon...

298
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,040
Help yourself.

299
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,370
Why did you bring me here?

300
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,940
Can't you guess?

301
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,610
Most of my customers look like Freddy.

302
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,970
Let's just say...

303
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,370
...I'll give you the house discount.

304
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,370
Why don't you take it easy?

305
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,220
You don't seem like the shy type.

306
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,250
You like what you see?

307
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,040
Come on, it's free. Whatever you want...

308
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,100
Why don't you tell me the real reason why I'm here?

309
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,820
No big deal. I just need a little help.

310
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,970
Yeah, right.

311
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:21,770
Hey, wait. I need your help.

312
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,470
Will you just hold on a minute?

313
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,770
I want you to help me break into the tower and steal some vaccine.

314
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,360
We lost our source inside. They killed him.

315
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,120
People are dying. Don't you care?

316
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,300
No, I don't.

317
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,770
Wait!

318
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,220
Wow, that didn't work.

319
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,970
This is all it takes.

320
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,690
Now, let us build our perfect world together.

321
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,690
Yo!

322
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,500
Hey!

323
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,570
I will make your dreams come true.

324
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,380
Please, just stop.

325
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,020
All in a world of safety, beauty and prosperity.

326
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,470
I got money, I can pay you.

327
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,560
Your obedience is all it takes.

328
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,330
Marcus!

329
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,830
Come, let us build our perfect world together.

330
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,830
What?! Don't tell me you know him?

331
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,410
He's the asshole that owns us.

332
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,750
What is this?

333
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,220
Hey, on your feet, dog!

334
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,000
Who're you?

335
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,490
Get up!

336
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,150
Bring him to me.

337
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,470
Why have you come here?

338
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,590
Answer me!

339
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,730
You crucified Moya!

340
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,380
Moya...

341
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,560
What a pity to waste such beauty.

342
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,220
She was yours then?

343
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,350
I'll tell you what...

344
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,060
Kill me and you live.

345
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,960
Cut him loose.

346
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,960
I'll do it!

347
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,650
Leave him!

348
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,900
He's mine.

349
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,270
He lies on holy ground.

350
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,420
You are a lucky bastard!

351
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,100
Well...

352
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,400
...it took you long enough.

353
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,820
Are you a sorcerer?

354
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,410
No.

355
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,820
No, I'm just a spirit.

356
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,270
I was once a druid priest and I was called Amergan.

357
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,800
Where are you going?

358
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,270
To kill a Roman.

359
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:29,820
Aren't you at least mildly curious as to why you still live?

360
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,110
I'm healed!

361
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:42,090
You, my friend, are immortal.
You will live forever.

362
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,700
Unless someone cuts off your head.

363
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,420
Oh, and I'd lay down that sword if I were you.

364
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,410
Well, if I'm immortal then what have I got to worry about?

365
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,690
Pain.

366
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,590
Pain still hurts.

367
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,420
Are we ready to listen?

368
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,230
We have much to discuss.

369
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,620
You have been given a rare gift.

370
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,940
You will live to see civilizations rise and fall.

371
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,220
You will know a thousand joys...

372
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,470
...and a thousand heartaches.

373
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,870
My friend...

374
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,670
...the Romans have gone.

375
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,540
What?!

376
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,240
Gone where?

377
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,070
There are other immortals like yourself.

378
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,510
When they draw close you'll feel them just like you felt Marcus.

379
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,370
Where is he?!
Tell me, tell me!!

380
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,020
He will take your head and your quickening.

381
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,520
Where is Marcus?!

382
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,080
He was part of your mortal life.

383
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,370
That life is over.

384
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,570
It'll be over when he's dead.

385
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,670
Your life has just begun.

386
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,040
Why are you in such a hurry to die?

387
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,110
NOOOOO!!!!

388
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,920
Holy shit!

389
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,920
Where is he?

390
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,200
What?

391
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,110
What's with you?

392
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,500
Where is he?

393
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,870
He's up there.

394
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,340
Forget about it, okay?
Security is too tight.

395
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,470
And half the army is looking for you ass.

396
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,720
Unless you know how to get in...

397
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,300
...like I do.

398
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,710
Now remember our deal...

399
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,410
I get you in and you help me get the vaccine.

400
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,560
Once I have it, do what you want.

401
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,070
Joe!

402
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,300
Huh, what the hell are you doing here?

403
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,310
Sarah's dying. I'm going with you.

404
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,580
No, you're not kid.

405
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,580
You'll just be in the way.

406
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,140
Joe, no one's ever made it.

407
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,800
Doc was lucky ok? Only lost his leg.

408
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,480
My choice.

409
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,580
Keep quiet.

410
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,370
What, what the...?

411
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,660
Oh, shi-

412
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,440
It's off.

413
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,960
Run, right now!

414
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,960
I'm sorry about the watch!

415
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,940
Forget it, run!

416
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,270
This way!

417
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,150
Dahlia!

418
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,910
Oh, man...

419
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,980
Come on, this way.

420
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,200
You sure you know where we're going?

421
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,060
Yeah, the city's right above us.

422
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,560
It should be right...

423
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,360
...there.

424
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,290
Bad timing.

425
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,920
Just stay put and...

426
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,720
Wow, he's amazing.

427
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,560
Yeah... but not very subtle.
Let's keep moving.

428
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,420
Here goes nothing!

429
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,160
Nobody moves!

430
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,510
If you wanna live, put your hands behind your heads!

431
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,480
Do it!

432
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,170
What exactly do you think you're doing?

433
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,080
We're here for the vaccine.

434
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,180
Where is it?

435
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:51,100
No! No!!
I'll do what you want!

436
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,520
For God's sake stop firing!

437
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,810
Did we lose viral containment?

438
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,440
No, sir! We're safe!

439
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,860
All sensors are negative.

440
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,360
What was that about?

441
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,210
What?

442
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,370
This is gotta be it!
I found it! It's the vaccine!

443
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,750
Put it in here!

444
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,790
I got it.

445
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,130
Hey! What's in there?

446
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,200
You said it was "viral"...

447
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,310
Why is there virus in there?

448
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:28,390
Don't! You do that... and everyone within 50 miles dies...

449
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:30,100
Oh, it's perfection...

450
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,140
...a perfect virus with a contagion and kill rate of 100%.

451
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,930
What the hell is it doing down here?!

452
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,170
No... it can't be...

453
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,490
Son of a bitch! You've been making it all along, right here...

454
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,950
You've been making us sick! Killing us!

455
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,040
I was under orders...

456
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,170
Why?! How could you do that?

457
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,980
Because... this is how it is... in Rome.

458
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,190
This isn't fucking Rome! This is New York!

459
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,890
It seems... that the security is aware of your presence.

460
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:10,220
Now drop your weap...

461
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:11,960
We're outta here!

462
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,350
I'm ready, let's go!

463
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,410
What now?!

464
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,030
Dahlia!

465
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,590
Shit! Run!!

466
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,370
Why is he going?

467
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,430
I don't know!

468
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,040
Wait! Colin!

469
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,090
Colin!

470
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,150
Don't go...

471
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,070
Don't leave us!

472
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,690
You've never been that bright.

473
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:27,420
How many women are you going to run away from?

474
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,060
Friends? Lovers? They mean nothing!

475
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,580
You live only for your vengeance...

476
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,820
Marcus!

477
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,180
I see you've been busy!

478
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,460
It took you long enough...

479
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,060
...Persia, Gaul, Egypt...

480
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,420
I go wherever my empire needs me.

481
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,090
Your empire dies today.

482
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:08,540
No... No, it will never die... in here.

483
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,640
Rome is more... more than princes, and palaces.

484
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:19,390
...is a thought, an ideal, a vision of beauty, order and peace.

485
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:24,860
My destiny is to create it again, in all its perfection.

486
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,650
Not if you're dead!

487
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,400
It is you, my friend, who are dead.

488
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,790
Here. Just open your eyes.

489
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,360
Barbarian.

490
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,000
This is your destiny.

491
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,200
There can be only one.

492
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,840
All you knew was your hate for Marcus...

493
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,060
...all you had was your quest for revenge...

494
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,570
...wasting centuries of life on a useless journey...

495
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,670
...that can only end in your death.

496
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,060
Marcus!

497
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,410
No! Colin!

498
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,410
A warrior came to us without a clan...

499
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,730
...without a name...

500
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,030
...he fought for us, he died for us.

501
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,720
He lived as a stranger, but in death he is a Highlander.

502
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,170
From today onward, he shall be known...

503
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,230
...as our brother Colin MacLeod of Clan MacLeod.

504
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:25,770
Hoi!

505
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,300
When you did find a place to call your home...

506
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,070
...and a woman who loved you...

507
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,520
What did you do?

508
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,620
I see him! This way!

509
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,740
Get out of the way, Deborah!

510
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,460
The demon must be destroyed!

511
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,970
You'll have to kill me first!

512
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,620
Are you mad girl?

513
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,260
You're in the way, Deborah!

514
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:01,820
Leave me Deborah...

515
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:03,680
...this is my fight.

516
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:07,270
No, it's mine... I love you! No!

517
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,440
Kill him now!

518
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,020
Leave him be! Leave him! No!

519
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:14,530
Colin!

520
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:15,400
Enough!

521
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,210
You'll not do this man any harm.

522
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,460
But Gregor... he's a demon!

523
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,700
We saw him dead! Yet now he lives!

524
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:24,970
He's the devil!

525
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,040
I don't know what could have brought him back to life...

526
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,460
...but he fought at our side and
helped bring us a great victory.

527
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,710
Look at his eyes...

528
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,720
There is no evil there!

529
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,490
Only sadness!

530
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,640
Then you will not raise your hands against him.

531
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,720
He has bewitched you!

532
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,140
He must die! He must die!

533
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:51,810
Here I swear on my honour... that so will you!

534
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,860
Go.

535
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,710
But... never forget...

536
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,040
...that you are Colin MacLeod of Clan MacLeod.

537
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,540
Live with honour, Highlander.

538
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,590
Colin!

539
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:22,890
Did Deborah's love or Gregor's faith change you?

540
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:24,540
Did you live with honour?

541
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,610
No. Because honour was not what you wanted.

542
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,570
For over a thousand years, it was only...

543
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,360
...vengeance.

544
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,230
Marcus!

545
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,570
Fire! Fire!!

546
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,840
You died again and again...

547
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,540
...with no thought of what you could have been...

548
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,400
...or what you could have done.

549
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,160
Well, that'll at least get you an A for the effort!

550
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,110
Hmm... Holy ground...

551
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:43,040
Why don't you just give up before you luck runs out?

552
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,780
I loved Moya... and you killed her!

553
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:52,320
I loved Rome... things die...

554
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,110
It is the way of life.

555
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,480
All we can do is try to find a reason to go on.

556
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,010
Build it again.

557
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,830
I have found mine.

558
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,490
Why don't you find something?

559
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,280
Mine is to bury you!

560
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,150
I wonder... who is the bigger fool?

561
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,810
So here we go again.

562
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,520
You must really enjoy getting your ass kicked...

563
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,260
...you do it so often.

564
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:28,130
Shit!

565
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:49,010
Dahlia! Hurry!

566
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,830
It's closing!

567
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,200
I knew it was you.

568
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,510
He's my guest.

569
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:20,090
You're looking well, old friend.

570
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,510
You are the same pitiful savage you have always been.

571
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:41,090
That will hurt...

572
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:48,190
Oh, shit!

573
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,260
Holy shit!!

574
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,000
Colin! Keep going!

575
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:04,940
Come on, let's go! He's dead!

576
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:08,770
Get the vaccine to Doc, and tell him about the virus.

577
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,110
What are you waiting for?!

578
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,280
I'm outta here!

579
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,350
Colin!

580
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,070
What?!

581
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,010
Jesus!

582
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,070
You were dead, weren't you?!

583
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:53,900
Y-Yeah... I was..

584
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:56,910
...but it's not... the first time.

585
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,810
Huh, you expect me to believe that you ran out on us because ...

586
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:07,330
...you and Marcus are both immortal?

587
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,520
And you've been chasing him all this time...

588
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:15,220
...for revenge...

589
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:16,870
...all this time?

590
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,060
Yeah.

591
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:23,370
Because he killed your wife, two thousand years ago...

592
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,920
Two thousand years!

593
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,620
I think you're out of your fucking mind!

594
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,850
I'm getting tired of this crap!

595
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,490
Go... but...

596
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,650
Two thousand fucking years!

597
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,390
So much grief!

598
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,460
So much hate!

599
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,430
You've had so much pain...

600
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,550
You must have really loved her!

601
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:50,060
That was very impressive... NOT!

602
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,340
At least you're consistent.

603
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,260
Where am I?

604
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,110
Inside... inside your own head!

605
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,160
Pretty empty, huh?

606
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,430
Remember this place?

607
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:15,260
Or have you forgotten her like you forgot your promise?

608
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,990
So, what would Moya think of you now?

609
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:21,860
Moya is gone.

610
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,280
Uh, you think?

611
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,110
This is her grave.

612
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,290
I've met trees with more brains!

613
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,980
You think that she was only of the body?

614
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,790
That dust is all she has become...

615
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,390
...but her soul, her essence is eternal.

616
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:42,460
She was meant to meet you again.

617
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:44,970
And she had found you throughout time.

618
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,440
But you staggered around blind and stupid...

619
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,940
...unable to see, unable to love...

620
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,680
...so full of anger and rage.

621
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,790
You've lost your reason, your promise!

622
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,080
You're full of shit!

623
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,390
Am I?

624
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,810
Open your eyes! Don't you see?

625
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:06,400
Don't you get it?

626
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:13,300
Moya, Deborah, Dahlia... are the same woman.

627
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,310
Colin...

628
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,470
Moya!

629
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:19,620
It's me...

630
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:25,080
Dahlia saved your butt!

631
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,750
Welcome back!

632
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:31,370
About five minutes ago you had six broken ribs...

633
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,570
...three crushed vertebrae, and you were bleeding out from a ruptured spleen...

634
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:37,640
...now you're not!

635
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:51,800
There he is!

636
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,520
It's him!

637
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,990
He's really alive...

638
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:05,520
I'm used to people running from me, like I was the devil.

639
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,350
Hmm, what you are doesn't matter.

640
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,560
You not only helped bring the vaccine...

641
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:13,730
...you've brought them something much more important.

642
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:17,120
You've brought them hope.

643
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,590
They now believe that anything is possible.

644
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,070
And so do I.

645
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:26,480
Doc, tell me you're not thinking of going to war with the city...

646
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:29,340
I'm tired of hiding in sewers...

647
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,650
...waiting for the day they kill us all.

648
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:36,910
Are you out of your mind?! He has an army! You have no chance.

649
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,060
You have no chance.

650
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,000
We have no choice.

651
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:43,140
Doc!

652
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,420
Listen up, everyone.

653
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,800
Today we have learned the truth...

654
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,710
...this virus has one purpose.

655
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,170
To kill us all. I say we fight!

656
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:53,940
Who fights with me?

657
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,630
We got no choice, let's take back our city!

658
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,550
Tell all your friends: tomorrow, we take back our city!

659
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:02,960
Tomorrow, we take back our lives!

660
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:06,090
Colin!

661
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:08,180
You'll fight with us, right?

662
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:11,530
It's our war, it's not his problem.

663
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:12,430
But...

664
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,110
To glory!

665
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,870
TO GLORYYYY!!!

666
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:27,180
In the name of honour!

667
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,700
HONOOOUR!!!

668
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,600
It was all going so well.

669
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:59,620
Now you say it's useless...

670
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,720
What am I going to do with you?

671
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,920
Not... useless... just not perfect.

672
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:09,120
Until we can control it, to use it is madness... it could kill us all.

673
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,310
I just need a little time.

674
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,890
Which, sadly, you do not have.

675
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:14,870
You're done.

676
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,340
What do you mean... done?

677
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,880
Done... means done!

678
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:31,970
They won't like that we created the virus...

679
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,180
I think it's time for a little creative brutality.

680
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:36,460
Go!

681
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:37,570
Yes sir!

682
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,340
What about MacLeod?

683
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:47,020
Don't bother looking for him. He'll be back.

684
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,180
Come in.

685
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,710
I never thanked you for carrying me out of there.

686
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,910
Forget it.

687
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,030
If you die... you won't be coming back.

688
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,780
Sometime dying's easier than living.

689
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,810
Seems like my whole life I've been fighting.

690
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,260
If I die, and we win... that's good enough for me.

691
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:43,230
Every day, at church, I pray for it.

692
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,230
I know you don't believe...

693
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,790
...but I'm sure God's been listening.

694
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:50,800
He has to be.

695
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:53,300
Because He answered one of my prayers.

696
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:02,380
Colin... I was praying... for you.

697
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,040
Hey, where's Dahlia?

698
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:38,320
We're letting her sleep.

699
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,970
So much for the element of surprise...

700
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:10,430
Come on, tough shit on us! It's now or never!

701
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,970
Rudy's right... but there's only way you can really win...

702
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,320
Marcus has to die.

703
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:19,540
Can you hold out long enough?

704
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,140
What are your chances of killing him?

705
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:23,650
Best you not know...

706
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,380
Right... same here.

707
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:29,490
Colin! There's another way into the city...

708
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,590
...but you'd have to be crazy to try!

709
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:32,620
Show me.

710
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:56,060
Come on baby... come to papa...

711
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:00,070
Wait and you'll see what daddy's got for you...

712
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,230
A little more...

713
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,820
That's it!

714
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:03,570
What the...

715
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,580
Up there!

716
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,330
Keep firing!

717
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:18,500
Run!

718
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,240
Colin...

719
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,810
Motherfucker!!!

720
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,440
This is it...

721
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,160
Right through there...

722
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,380
Let's fall back!

723
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:22,240
I told you had to be crazy.

724
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,060
But this is the only way to get up there.

725
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:29,650
Thanks.

726
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:31,240
I'll take it from here.

727
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:34,340
Hey Colin! Kick his ass...

728
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,730
You can't hide from me, cutie!

729
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,120
Oh baby... that must hurt...

730
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,030
Dahlia!

731
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:26,480
Just do what you gotta do and get your ass back to me!

732
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,240
Dahlia! Be careful!

733
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,040
What a bang!

734
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:52,200
Who's the man?

735
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:53,580
You're the man!

736
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:54,870
Let's finish this.

737
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,100
You got it.

738
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,640
C'mon, it's time to kick some ass!

739
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:04,610
There's the signal!

740
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:05,860
Let's do it!

741
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,190
Fire!

742
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:37,170
The more things change...

743
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,020
...the more they stay the same.

744
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,690
Right? Just like now...

745
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:45,670
You were there.

746
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,060
Are you responsible for this?

747
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:55,850
No. But you are.

748
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:59,170
Their battle, my battle...

749
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:02,540
...it will only end with your death!

750
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:08,140
Barbarians will always be barbarians.

751
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,850
If I can't control them, or tame them...

752
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,300
...I might as well start all over again.

753
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,560
What are you doing?

754
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:27,230
Isn't it obvious?

755
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:29,390
I'm going to kill everything in New York.

756
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:32,480
You're insane!

757
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,520
In two minutes the virus flies...

758
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:40,740
Can you stop it?

759
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:01,830
No... time to waste it.

760
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:55,670
As I said...

761
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,340
...everything dies.

762
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,800
My new world begins!

763
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:30,180
Oh no...

764
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:31,740
Virus!

765
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,900
How does that feel?

766
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:44,030
Don't worry your pretty head about it...

767
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,580
...you won't be alone.

768
01:14:46,130 --> 01:14:48,660
Everyone dies today.

769
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:52,080
Except... for Marcus and me.

770
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,920
I think... I'll take...

771
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,840
...you with me!

772
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:07,980
Colin... I will see you again...

773
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:14,610
...one day...

774
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,880
Dahlia!

775
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:20,900
...in another time...

776
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:28,370
God...

777
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,340
...help me...

778
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:37,590
...for them, for her...

779
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,340
Back so soon?

780
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,150
This time I take your head.

781
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:10,130
There can be only one!

782
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:27,000
So? Big shot... you finally won.

783
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:29,350
Too late.

784
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,220
For everything.

785
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:34,400
No, it wasn't.

786
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:39,380
You saved the city. The quickening wiped out the virus.

787
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,740
I do pity that poor girl.

788
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:46,090
At least her prayers were heard.

789
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:18,610
Take heart my old friend...

790
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:23,400
What is lost shall one day be found.

791
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:26,330
Catch you later, Colin.

792
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:31,080
I hope you found peace.

793
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:39,700
