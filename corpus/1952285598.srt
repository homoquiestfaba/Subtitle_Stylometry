00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,641
     AND ALTHOUGH THE ISSUE
    REMAINS A SKELETON

00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,710
      <i>IN RETROSPECT, IT IS </i>

00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,345
    DID GOVERNMENT PLAY
         A ROLE IN THIS?

255
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,581
          VERY LITTLE.
         ONLY BY KEEPING
         THE ROAD CLEAR

256
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,217
         FOR HUMAN GREED
        AND SELF-INTEREST

257
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,586
     TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE
        OF THE CONSUMER.

00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,658
         <i>THE WORD FREEDOM</i>

265
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,106
      DR. MILTON FRIEDMAN--
          A SCIENTIST,

266
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,141
        A CAREFUL THINKER
      AND A GREAT TEACHER--

       <i>A HERO OF FREEDOM--</i>
         <i>MILTON FRIEDMAN.</i>

268
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,412
    I SOUGHT OUT DR. FRIEDMAN

269
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,414
AND HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE
          AND PRIVILEGE

270
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,917

278
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,239

279
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,677
    OKAY, SO WE SHOULD

294

00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,891

    TO THE GUILLOTINE.

392
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,695
     I THINK IT'S RIGHT NEAR
     WHERE THEY USED TO HAVE

393
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,397
      THE GUILLOTINE, TOO,

    MY HAIR IN LIKE...

398

00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,155
          YEAH, REALLY.

400
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,991
        I THINK I USED TO
         DO IT THIS WAY.

401
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,692
        ALL RIGHT.

 UNION CARBIDE THREE YEARS AGO,

406

          WE KNEW WHAT
      WE WERE GETTING INTO.

407
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,743
      TODAY WE ARE PREPARED
    TO DO THE OBVIOUS.

        LET'S SEE.

411
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,420

      - <i>BONJOUR, MONSIEUR.</i>

412
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,759
You're watching BBC World,
    our main headlines.

413
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,894
     <i>The world's worst</i>
       <i>industrial accident</i>

414
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,763
    is being remembered
         in India today.

415
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,698
          It's 20 years
     since deadly gas leaked

416
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,500
      <i>from the Union Carbide</i>
          <i>chemical plant</i>

417
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,335
           <i>in the city</i>
           <i>of Bhopal. </i>

418
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,371
      <i>At least 18,000 deaths</i>
   <i>are attributed to the leak,</i>

419
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,040
             <i>and many</i>
         <i>local people say</i>

420
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,642
     <i>that the contamination </i>
     <i>has never been properly</i>
           <i>cleared up.</i>

421
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,111
    YEAH, SHOULD I TYPICALLY
          JUST LOOK...

422
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,314
      - Woman: <i>YEAH.</i>
      - ...RIGHT INTO
        THE CAMERA?  OKAY.

423
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,182
        The factory
        still exists here

424
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,717
         and that's been
         a real problem

425
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,319
         for the people
      living here locally.

426
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,988
         <i>The site--</i>
         <i>I've been to it,</i>

427
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,856
          <i>and it's full</i>
         <i>of toxic waste.</i>

428
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,892
      <i>People who are living</i>
         <i>in these houses,</i>

429
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,827
         <i>they've all got</i>
         <i>a story to tell</i>

430
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,796
          <i>about that day</i>
          <i>20 years ago. </i>

431
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,965
    Many of them lost members
        of their family,

432
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,767
      and they say they are
      continuing to suffer

433
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,269
     because of the tragedy.
    And they're saying

434
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,904
          <i>somebody needs</i>
       <i>to answer for this.</i>

435
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,840
   <i>Legally, what they're saying</i>
      <i>is they want to pursue</i>

436
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,209
     <i>the company to try</i>
      <i>and clean up the site.</i>

437
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,846
     <i>But whether the company</i>
      <i>will accept liability</i>
         <i>seems doubtful.</i>

438
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,116
      Well, joining us live
        from Paris now is
        Jude Finisterra.

439
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,985
         <i>He's a spokesman</i>
     <i>for Dow Chemicals,</i>

440
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,587
         <i>which took over</i>
         <i>Union Carbide.</i>

441
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,055
       <i>Good morning to you.</i>

442
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,225
          A day of commemoration
          in Bhopal.

443
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,862
            Do you now accept
            responsibility

444
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,664
            for what happened?

445
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,101
        Steve, yes,
      today is a great day

446
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,036
      for all of us at Dow

447
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,372
          and, I think,
     for millions of people

448
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,140
        around the world
            as well.

449
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,209
          It's 20 years
    since the disaster

450
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,747
    and today I'm very
     very happy to announce

451
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,949
     that for the first time
        Dow is accepting

452
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:28,853
    full responsibility
for the Bhopal catastrophe.

453
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,889
             We have
    a $12 billion plan

454
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,924
        to finally,
          at long last,

455
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,360
        fully compensate
          the victims,

456
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,930
      including the 120,000
    who may need medical care

457
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,033
     for their entire lives,

458
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,302
    AND TO FULLY AND SWIFTLY

459
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,605
            REMEDIATE
     THE BHOPAL PLANT SITE.

460
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,409
      Now when we acquired
  Union Carbide three years ago

461
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,843
          we knew what
        we were getting,

462
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:56,113
         and it's worth
          $12 billion.

463
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,082
          $12 billion.

464
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,918
        We have resolved
  to liquidate Union Carbide--

465
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:04,689
  this nightmare for the world
  and this headache for Dow--

466
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,991
     and use the $12 billion

467
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:10,027
    TO ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE
          THE VICTIMS.

468
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,830
          Jude, that's good news
          that you have finally

469
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:15,166
    accepted responsibility--

470
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,801
             some people
             would say too late.

471
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,936
        It's three years,
        almost four years on.

472
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,938
        When we acquired
          Union Carbide

473
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,440
          we did settle
        their liabilities

474
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,642
      in the United States
          immediately.

475
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,012
        And we are now--
    three years later--

476
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,947
         prepared to do
    the same in India.

477
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:33,117
         We should have
    done it three years ago.
      We are doing it now.

478
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:36,220
          I WOULD ALSO
      LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS
    IS NO SMALL MATTER.

479
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,622
     THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
        IN HISTORY

480
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,491
  that a publicly-owned company

481
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,760
        of anything
      near the size of Dow

482
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,563
          has performed
            an action

483
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,698
     which is significantly
    against its bottom line,

484
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:50,434
         simply because
it's the right thing to do.

485
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,537
      Our shareholders may
take a bit of a hit, Steve,

486
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,439
        but I think that
  if they're anything like me,

487
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,341
      they will be ecstatic
        to be part

488
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,411
             of such
    a historic occasion

489
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,547
         of doing right
  by those that we've wronged.

490
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,951
        Just to reiterate
      what Jude Finisterra,

491
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,354
          the spokesman
    for Dow Chemicals,
         has just said:

492
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,891
      he says Dow Chemicals
        now fully accept

493
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,762
          <i>responsibility</i>
 <i>for the events in Bhopal.</i>

494
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,768
      - GREAT.  THAT'S IT?
      - WELL DONE.

495
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,202
             GREAT.
    NOW THEY WANTED...

496
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,037
         - NOW YOU DO--
         - ...RADIO.

497
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,572
         I CAN TELL YOU
        ONE THING:

498
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,207
        WE'RE NOT GOING
        OUT OF BUSINESS.

499
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,842
        WE WILL CONTINUE
        TO MAKE PROFIT;

500
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:35,246
      WE WILL SIMPLY MAKE
      SLIGHTLY LESS PROFIT
          THAN NORMAL.

501
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,548
        BUT WE ARE DOING
        THE RIGHT THING.

502
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,950
      WE'RE COMPARING HERE
    THE VALUE OF MONEY

503
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,852
          TO THE VALUE
         OF HUMAN LIFE,

504
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,054
          AND THERE IS
         NO COMPARISON.

505
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,158
        ( woman speaks )

506
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,227
    EXACTLY.  I MEAN,
    HOW OFTEN DOES DOW
    GET TO-- YOU KNOW.

507
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,530
          ( chuckles )
      I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE

        OTHERWISE.

509
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,367

         IT'S AN HONEST

00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,580
           OF WHAT DOW
         <i>SHOULD</i> BE DOING.

535
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,683
         Maria Ashanin:
  <i>This morning a false statement</i>

536
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,252
     <i>was carried by BBC World</i>

537
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,988
     <i>regarding responsibility</i>
     <i>for the Bhopal tragedy. </i>

538
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,056
     <i>The individual who made</i>
          <i>this statement</i>

539
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,727
     <i>identified himself</i>
      <i>as a Dow spokesperson </i>
      <i>named Jude Finisterra.</i>

540
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,729
           <i>Dow confirms</i>
          <i>that there was</i>

541
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,864
       <i>no basis whatsoever</i>
         <i>for this report.</i>

542
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,267
    Well, earlier today
     we carried an interview

543
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,502
    with someone purporting
    to be from Dow Chemical,

544
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,039
         a company which
    subsequently bought
  the plant from Union Carbide.

545
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,774
         This interview
         was inaccurate

546
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,676
             <i>and part</i>
 <i>of an elaborate deception.</i>

547
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,111
              Andy:
           <i>TAKE A LOOK</i>
          <i>AT THIS NOW--</i>

548
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,914
          LOOK AT THIS.
         THIS IS THE TOP
         OF GOOGLE NEWS.

549
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,217
    "DOW SAID ON FRIDAY
  THERE WAS NO BASIS WHATSOEVER

00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:56,387

THEY HAD ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY

551
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:57,888
        FOR INDIA'S
        BHOPAL DISASTER."

552
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,356
    THAT'S A FUNNY SENTENCE.

553
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,225
          The hoax was
        an elaborate one

554
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,427
            involving
         a fake website.

555
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:06,330
Down Chemical
was quick to issue
a series of statements

556
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:09,667
denying all knowledge
of Jude Finisterra.

557
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:12,570
      Also tonight, backtracking
      because of this man...

558
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,876
        WE'RE GOING BACK
    TO THE B.B.C. TELEVISION
        STUDIO RIGHT NOW

559
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,377
          THAT WE WERE
         AT THIS MORNING

560
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,448
        BECAUSE THEY WANT
         TO TALK TO US.

561
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,817
          OKAY, WHAT DO
    THEY WANT TO KNOW?

562
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,218
    WELL, LET'S GO SEE.

563
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,287
             <i>( woman speaks )</i>

564
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,023
            - YEAH.
            - HI.

565
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,359
        - HI.  SORRY.
        - ( all laugh )

566
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,263
( man speaks )

567
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,132
         IT DIDN'T OCCUR
          TO US AT ALL.

568
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:44,435
        WE GOT CONTACTED
          BY YOU GUYS.

569
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,236
 <i>( man speaks )</i>

570
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,807
    - YEAH, I DID HEAR THAT.
       HAS IT GONE BACK UP?
     - Man: <i>I'M SURE IT HAS.</i>

571
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:52,443
Well, the prank
which briefly
knocked 3% off

572
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,346
Dow shares comes
20 years to the day

573
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,614
after the chemical leak

574
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,616
from the Union Carbide
plant in Bhopal.

575
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,151
              Man:
         <i>Today's unlikely</i>
      <i>corporate humiliation </i>

576
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,820
      <i>of a US chemical giant</i>

577
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,655
          <i>was all about</i>
       <i>reminding the world </i>

578
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:07,458
       <i>that Bhopal remains</i>
     <i>an unhealed sore.</i>

579
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,662
      Well, earlier I spoke
        to Andy Bichlbaum

580
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,665
and I asked him what he did
      when he got an email

581
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,102
     from the BBC asking him
        for an interview.

582
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:22,573
    Essentially, Dow has been
    promulgating a hoax

583
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:25,776
        by which they've
        convinced people

584
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,879
    that they can't do
     anything about Bhopal,

585
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,614
     that they cannot accept
         responsibility.

586
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,218
And we wanted to prove that
     that was not accurate.

587
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,688
            Nevertheless,
            a pretty cruel
            trick to play

588
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,356
             <i>on the people</i>
             <i>of Bhopal.</i>

589
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:43,327
     - Well, we--
     - Did you think about
       the people of Bhopal

590
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,663
        when you decided
        to peddle this stunt?

591
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,965
    Yes.  Yes, we did.

592
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,967
     Well, that surely is
     the tragedy of today.

593
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,969
      You spring upon them
      the hoax that they--

594
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,872
            they actually
            suddenly believe

595
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,974
            that they have got
            a payout from Dow,

596
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,611
    then an hour or two later
    they find it's untrue.

597
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,146
         Let's put this
          in contrast:

598
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,283
    We may have given people
    two hours of false hope,

599
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,119
    Dow has given them
     20 years of suffering.

600
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,655
         I mean this is
     what we're faced with.

601
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,491
      Are you expecting
      the next knock at the door
      to be Dow's lawyer?

602
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,493
             No idea
        what Dow will do.

603
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,364
              Mike:
 <i>DOW'S LAWYERS DIDN'T CALL.</i>

604
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,933
      <i>AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE</i>
 <i>LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME</i>

605
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:26,637
     <i>THAT 20 YEARS ON,</i>
   <i>BHOPAL WAS NEVER CLEED UP.</i>

606
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,206

      <i>BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED.</i>

      <i>HAD WE ACTUALLY UPSET</i>

       <i>ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.</i>

612
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,324
          HERE WE ARE.
         WE'RE IN INDIA.

613
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,027

614
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,663

      <i>BHOPAL IS A BIG CITY.</i>

        THAT THE VICTIMS
         HERE IN BHOPAL

618
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,573
      WERE EXTREMELY UPSET

619
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,942
         BECAUSE WE HAD
    RAISED FALSE HOPES

620
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,778
    ABOUT THEM ACTUALLY
    GETTING SOME COMPENSATION

 WHAT'S THE LOCAL CUSTOM HERE?

627
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,220

                 THE GAS VICTIMS

          TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE...

648
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:52,049
- UH-HUH.
- ...AND DOW WAS TOO BAD
  FOR THE NEWS TO BE TRUE.

649
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,351
      - YEAH.
      - STILL, WE THOUGHT
        MAYBE IT IS TRUE,

650
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:57,287
        MAYBE THEY'RE JUST
        SEEING SENSE IN THIS.

651
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:02,025
    FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WE WERE
    UNDER THAT IMPRESSION.

652
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,494
YEAH.
DID PEOPLE CRY...

653
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,597
          - WITH JOY?
          - I CRIED.

654
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,932
    - OH NO.
    - LOTS OF PEOPLE CRIED.

655
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,068
WERE YOU KIND OF ANGRY
AT FIRST, THOUGH,

656
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:14,104
- WHEN YOU HEARD
  IT WAS A HOAX?
- NO, I WASN'T ANGRY.  NO.

          A BIT OF A--

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,407
          WE GOT LOST.

669
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,276

      <i>IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.</i>

675
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,326
    SO YOU HAD ALREADY
    PREDICTED HOW MANY TIMES

676
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,596
THAT THE DISASTER WOULD
HAPPEN BEFORE IT HAPPENED?

677
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,462

WERE YOU, LIKE--
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF IT... AT FIRST?

679
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,202
    I THOUGHT THAT WAS
    A WONDERFUL THING TO DO.

680
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:55,205
        WE WERE PUT
        INTO A SITUATION

          STEPPED BACK

780

AND LET THE FREE ENTERPRISE
    SYSTEM DO ITS WORK.

781
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:40,240
     THEN THE BETTER WE DID,

789

  TO HAVE GOVERNMENT INTERVENE
    OR REGULATE IN SOME WAY.

790
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:03,563
  IN FACT, MOST PROBLEMS WILL

more pleasant

810

00:50:14,628 --> 00:50:17,663
     <i>THE BIGGEST CATASTROPHE</i>
       <i>EVER TO HIT THE U.S.</i>

1033
00:50:17,698 --> 00:50:20,466
      <i>AND NOW THE GOVERNMENT</i>
         <i>WAS HANDING OUT</i>

1034
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,202
       <i>BILLIONS OF DOLLARS</i>
     <i>IN REBUILDING CONTRACTS.</i>

1035
00:50:23,236 --> 00:50:26,439
         <i>IN OTHER WORDS,</i>
       <i>LETTING GREED SOLVE</i>
           <i>THE PROBLEM.</i>

1036
00:50:26,473 --> 00:50:29,642
         THERE HAS BEEN
      THIS IDEA THAT IT IS
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY

1037
00:50:29,676 --> 00:50:32,378
TO REPLAN THE CONSTRUCTION
         OF NEW ORLEANS.

1038
00:50:32,412 --> 00:50:34,246
     <i>IT'S BETTER TO LEAVE IT</i>
          <i>TO THE MARKET.</i>

1039
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,084
              Mike:
 <i>WE WANTED TO TAKE A CLOSER</i>
      <i>LOOK AT HOW THE MARKET</i>

1040
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,786
         <i>WAS FIXING</i>
       <i>THE U.S. GULF COAST.</i>

1041
00:50:42,756 --> 00:50:46,158
        WE'RE ON OUR WAY
        TO THE GULF COAST
    RECONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE

1042
00:50:46,193 --> 00:50:48,694
    AT THE WASHINGTON
    CONVENTION CENTER.

1043
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:50,730
     WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO
    A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

1044
00:50:50,764 --> 00:50:52,798
          WHO ARE BUSY
RECONSTRUCTING NEW ORLEANS.

1045
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,234
    - <i>( honks )</i>
    - YEAH, WATCH OUT.

1046
00:50:57,537 --> 00:51:01,507
  THERE ARE MANY SILVER-LININGS
  TO THIS HORRENDOUS DISASTER,

1047
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:04,877
       <i>AND WITH IT HAS COME</i>
 <i>AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.</i>

1048
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:07,780
    I'M OPTIMISTIC WHEN I SEE
    A ROOMFUL OF FOLKS

1049
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,116
WHO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
      OF THE OPPORTUNITIES.

1050
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,151
     AND THAT'S A GOOD THING
      FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE.

1051
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:13,452
    IT'S A GREAT THING.

1052
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,455
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE THE ISRAELIS SAY:

1053
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,524
ONCE IN A WHILE
A GOOD CRISIS IS NOT BAD;

1054
00:51:18,558 --> 00:51:21,327
 <i>YOU COME UP</i>
 <i>WITH NEW THINGS.</i>

1055
00:51:21,361 --> 00:51:23,996
              Mike:
       <i>WE WERE SEEING A LOT</i>
          <i>OF NEW THINGS.</i>

1056
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:27,566
     <i>BUT WASN'T THIS SUPPOSED</i>
      <i>TO BE ABOUT GULF COAST</i>
         <i>RECONSTRUCTION?</i>

1057
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:30,669
WE'RE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED
IN GULF COAST RECONSTRUCTION.

1058
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:34,240
         AND, UH, IS THIS--
         DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING
         TO DO WITH THAT?

1059
00:51:34,274 --> 00:51:37,042
THIS IS FOR BOMB DETONATION

1060
00:51:37,077 --> 00:51:38,711
AND AMMUNITION STORAGE.

1061
00:51:38,745 --> 00:51:41,046
          PERIMETER
          AND PHYSICAL SECURITY,

1062

   <i>THIS PARTICULAR UNIT CAN BE</i>
  <i>USED IN MILITARY APPLICATIONS.</i>

1064
00:51:49,422 --> 00:51:53,025
            WOW.  SO IT'S A REAL
            CATASTROPHE TOILET,
            BASICALLY.

1065
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:56,896
              Mike:
  <i>ALL THIS STUFF WOULD BE GREAT</i>
  <i>FOR THE PEOPLE OF NEW ORLEANS</i>

1066
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:59,131
     <i>IF THEY WERE GONNA</i>
           <i>FIGHT A WAR.</i>

1067

             READY TO HELP

1071
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:14,446
        THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA,

AND HERE'S THE YURT.

1074
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:38,070
          - OH MY GOSH.
          - THIS IS IT.

1075
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:41,173
YOU CAN COVER IT UP.
YOU CAN BUILD A FIRE--
YOU CAN OPEN IT UP.

1076
00:52:41,208 --> 00:52:44,343
AND IF THERE'S A FLOOD,
YOU CAN JUST TAKE IT UP
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

1077
00:52:44,377 --> 00:52:47,346
- THEY'RE INTERESTED IN SENDING
  ONE FREE OF CHARGE...
- GREAT.

1078
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,216
  - ...TO LOUISIANA AS A TEST

  - THANK YOU.

1079
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,784
             - YEP.
              - NO!

1080
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:59,091
              Mike:
  <i>THE YURT WAS THE ONLY SOLUTION</i>
 <i>HERE ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE.</i>

1081
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:02,261
     <i>BUT THE GOVERNMENT REPS</i>

1084
00:53:07,968 --> 00:53:10,569
     <i>AND BEAT THE FREE MARKET</i>

1085
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:16,275

     <i>IT COULD PROTECT ANYONE</i>
 <i>FROM PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.</i>

1088
00:53:22,048 --> 00:53:24,149
 <i>BUT IT WOULD COST SO MUCH</i>

1089

      - YEAH.

1091
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:32,825

( laughs )
WITH THEIR NAME.

1115
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:46,198
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT--
WHAT'S IT CALLED,
BASICALLY, THE HOTEL?

1116
00:54:46,232 --> 00:54:48,567
- RITZ-CARLTON.
- <i>RITZ-CARLTON, THAT ONE.</i>

00:55:42,622 --> 00:55:46,725
      UM, A LOT OF YOU WORK
  WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY,
        OF COURSE.

1135
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,828
      INSURANCE HAS BECOME

1139
00:55:57,303 --> 00:55:59,972

         THAT IT BRINGS.

1140
00:56:00,006 --> 00:56:02,574
      BUT I CAN PERSONALLY
          GUARANTEE YOU

1141
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:05,711

      DIED IN GREAT AGONY.

1146
00:56:16,523 --> 00:56:20,459
    NO ONE, OF COURSE,
     WOULD WISH SUCH A THING
      ON ANY CIVILIZATION.

1147

        YET WITHOUT IT--
WITHOUT THE BLACK PLAGUE--

1148

  THIS WORLD-ENDING DISASTER--

     A TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE

1155
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:47,352
        AND PERHAPS
        BY NOAH HIMSELF.

1156
00:56:47,387 --> 00:56:50,222
    YET NOAH WAS READY
    TO SEIZE THE DAY.

1157
00:56:50,256 --> 00:56:54,126
AND AT THE END OF THAT DAY,
    NOT ONLY WAS THERE
    A WHOLE NEW WORLD,

1158
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,629
     BUT NOAH FOUND HIMSELF
 WITH A MONOPOLY OF THE ANIMALS.

1159
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:02,968
  FOR THOSE OF US IN POSITIONS
  OF RESPONSIBILITY, HOWEVER,

1160
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,671
     WHO MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE
    CHARGE IN A CRISIS,

1161
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:08,674
  <i>EVEN MORE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS</i>
          <i>ARE NECESSARY.</i>

1162
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:12,044
           <i>I'D LIKE NOW</i>
 <i>TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUE,</i>
       <i>DR. NORTHROP GOODY,</i>

         <i>AT HALLIBURTON. </i>

1165
00:57:16,149 --> 00:57:19,585
      <i>AND DR. GOODY WILL BE</i>
      <i>SHOWING SOME MOCK-UPS</i>

00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:24,156
- <i>OF SOME ITEMS THAT</i>
 <i> HIS UNIT HAS DEVELOPED.</i>
- <i>( applause )</i>

1167
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:28,393
WE WANT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING
TO BE ABLE TO SAVE A HUMAN BEING

1168
00:57:28,428 --> 00:57:31,196
  NO MATTER WHAT MOTHER NATURE
         THROWS AT HIM.

1169
00:57:31,231 --> 00:57:35,000
AND SO THIS IS THE ANSWER.

1170
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,636
     <i>THIS IS THE HALLIBURTON</i>
           <i>SURVIVABALL.</i>

1171
00:57:39,339 --> 00:57:41,807
      IT'S THREE EASY STEPS
FOR DEPLOYMENT: SUITING UP,

1172
00:57:41,841 --> 00:57:44,510
         <i>INFLATING</i>
 <i>AND OF COURSE LAUNCHING--</i>

1173
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:48,147
          LAUNCHING OUT
OF A BUILDING. AND WE HAVE
      AN ARTIST'S RENDITION

1174
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:51,984
 <i>OF WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE </i>
 <i>IN HOUSTON WHEN WE LAUNCH</i>
     <i>OUR SURVIVABALLS.</i>

1175
00:57:52,018 --> 00:57:55,220
          IN THE EVENT
     OF EXTREME CATASTROPHE,

1176
00:57:55,255 --> 00:57:57,756
         THERE MIGHT BE
    A SCARCITY OF RESOURCES.

1177
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:02,194
     <i>IN THIS CASE, WE'VE GOT</i>
      <i>A SURVIVABALL HERE...</i>

1178
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:05,264
  - ( moos )
  - ...THAT'S GOING UP
    AND EXTRACTING RESOURCES,

1179
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:07,166
          IN THIS CASE,
         FROM AN ANIMAL.

1180
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,134
       <i>YOU DON'T WANT TO BE</i>
     <i>EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS,</i>

1181
00:58:09,169 --> 00:58:11,537
  <i>BUT YOU STILL WANT TO BE ABLE</i>
       <i>TO EXTRACT RESOURCES</i>

1182
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,839
     <i>FROM, FOR EXAMPLE,</i>
              <i>A COW.</i>

1183
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:16,108
     <i>THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE</i>
     <i>TO GO UNDERWATER,</i>

1184
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:19,711
          <i>RATED AT 50'.</i>
         <i>THEY CAN BE USED</i>
     <i>IN ANY CONDITION.</i>

1185
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:23,115
 <i>IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER</i>
      <i>YOU'RE IN A LANDSLIDE</i>
          <i>IN CALIFORNIA</i>

1186
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:26,518
      <i>OR EVEN IN THE ARCTIC.</i>
 <i>OF COURSE ANY OTHER CONDITIONS,</i>

00:58:26,553 --> 00:58:29,888
      <i>WHETHER IT'S TSUNAMIS</i>
          <i>OR TORNADOES,</i>

1188
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:33,759
    THE SURVIVABALL IS
     DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND.

1189
00:58:35,228 --> 00:58:36,995
     <i>BUT THE BEST PART </i>
     <i>OF THE SURVIVABALL</i>

1190
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,164
          <i>IS THAT PEOPLE</i>
           <i>NEED PEOPLE.</i>

1191
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,868
  <i>AND SO OUR BIGGEST INSPIRATION</i>
   <i>FOR THE WAY THAT A COMMUNITY</i>
           <i>SHOULD WORK</i>

1192
00:58:42,902 --> 00:58:45,237
     <i>WITH SURVIVABALLS</i>
       <i>COMES FROM BIOLOGY.</i>

1193
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:48,907
    UM, AS SOME OF YOU
          PROBABLY KNOW

1194
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:53,111
     AMOEBAS GATHER TOGETHER
 AND ACTUALLY FORM ANOTHER BODY.

1195
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:55,914
         THEY AGGREGATE.
     AND SO THESE ONE-CELLED
            ORGANISMS

1196
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,016
          COME TOGETHER
        AS A SINGLE BODY.

1197
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,986
          FOR EXAMPLE,

 <i>MAYBE MAKING FUN OF STUPID</i>

1231
01:02:09,575 --> 01:02:13,211
       <i>WE HAD TO GET SMART,</i>

1232
01:02:13,246 --> 01:02:15,781

      <i>A CHANCE TO GET RICH,</i>

1235
01:02:26,392 --> 01:02:28,427
     <i>BUT AN OPPORTUNITY</i>

1244
01:02:50,716 --> 01:02:53,084
           <i>SO WHAT DID</i>
     <i>THE GOVERNMENT DO?</i>

1245
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,587
           <i>THEY DECIDED</i>
         <i>TO TEAR IT DOWN.</i>

1246
01:02:55,621 --> 01:02:59,357
THE DISASTER FOR US
STARTED AFTER THE STORM...

1247
01:02:59,392 --> 01:03:03,528
- UH-HUH.
- ...WHEN PEOPLE FOUND OUT THAT
  YOU WERE GONNA BE MAROONED

 <i>IN A STRANGE FOREIGN CITY,</i>

 <i>WANTING TO COME HOME,</i>

1250
01:03:09,168 --> 01:03:12,003
AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS GOING
TO TAKE YOUR HOME AWAY.

1251
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:15,640
 THIS WAS OURS BEFORE THE STORM.
     AND WHEN STORMS HAPPEN
        EVERYWHERE ELSE,

1252
01:03:15,675 --> 01:03:18,310
    PEOPLE GET A CHANCE TO GO
 BACK HOME-- THIS IS HOME TO US.

1253
01:03:18,344 --> 01:03:21,713
 WHY DO THEY TAKE AWAY OUR PRIDE
 AND JOY?  THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT
    PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH.

1254
01:03:21,747 --> 01:03:23,715
          Wade Rathke:
       <i>THERE'S A WHOLE CITY</i>

01:03:23,749 --> 01:03:25,817
     <i>NOW YOU'VE GOTTA REBUILD</i>
         <i>THE WHOLE THING.</i>

1256
01:03:25,852 --> 01:03:28,687
      PART OF WHAT THIS WAS
WAS IF YOU EVER HAD AN IDEA

1257
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:31,556
  THAT YOU COULDN'T GET THROUGH
        BEFORE THE STORM,

1258
01:03:31,591 --> 01:03:35,794
WELL, THE STORM MEANT THAT
  EVERYTHING WAS TOSSED SALAD.

1259
01:03:35,828 --> 01:03:38,997
    SO IF THIS IDEA HAD BEEN
  ROUNDLY REJECTED BY THE CITY

1260
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:40,832
          AND BY VOTERS
          AND WHATEVER,

1261
01:03:40,867 --> 01:03:43,268
      <i>BUT NOW'S YOUR CHANCE</i>

1262
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:47,372
              Mike:
       <i>WHEN RESIDENTS TRIED</i>

1263

         Pres Kabacoff:
      <i>THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</i>
      <i>CAME UP WITH A PROGRAM</i>

1266

         PUBLIC HOUSING

1267
01:03:58,784 --> 01:04:02,387
        AND PRIVATIZE IT.

1268
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:05,557
         <i>AND THAT'S</i>
     <i>WHAT WE'RE DOING.</i>

1276
01:04:27,713 --> 01:04:30,549

          <i>ON THE B.B.C.,</i>
         <i>WE TRIED TO SHOW</i>

1279
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:41,393
       <i>THAT COMPANIES COULD</i>
       <i>BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY. </i>

1280
01:04:41,427 --> 01:04:43,261
 <i>AND WE'D LEARNED THAT THEY</i>
             <i>COULDN'T</i>

1281
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,397
   <i>UNTIL GOVERNMENT MADE RULES</i>
         <i>TO CONTROL THEM.</i>

1282
01:04:46,566 --> 01:04:48,066
          <i>YET EVEN HERE</i>
         <i>IN NEW ORLEANS,</i>

1283
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,168
   <i>WHERE HELP WAS MOST NEEDED,</i>

1284
01:04:50,202 --> 01:04:53,405
   <i>GOVERNMENT WAS ALSO DRINKING</i>
 <i>THE FREE-MARKET KOOL-AID.</i>

1285
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:58,944
          I BELIEVE IN
    A MARKET-DRIVEN PROCESS.

1286
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,880
     ECONOMICS, CAPITALISM--

1287
01:05:01,914 --> 01:05:03,315
      IT'S GONNA TAKE OVER.

1288
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:06,484
    AND THE MARKETPLACE
      IS POISED TO RESPOND.

1289
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:11,489
              Mike:
     <i>SO THE GOVERNMENT DIDN'T</i>
      <i>BELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT.</i>

1290
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:14,359
 <i>WE KNEW WHAT WE HAD TO DO:</i>

1291
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:16,861
         WE <i>WOULD BECOME</i>
         <i>THE GOVERNMENT.</i>

1292
01:05:16,896 --> 01:05:18,730
      <i>AND WE WOULD FIND OUT</i>
     <i>WHAT WOULD HAPPEN</i>

1293
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:21,600
     <i>IF GOVERNMENT DID</i>
     <i>THE RIGHT THING. </i>

1294
01:05:23,302 --> 01:05:27,739
        WE ARE PREPARING
     TO GO TO THE GULF COAST
    RECONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE

1295
01:05:27,773 --> 01:05:31,176
 - AT THE PONTCHARTRAIN CENTER
   IN KENNER NEAR THE AIRPORT.
 - LET'S GO.

1296
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:34,145
 - YOU SHOULDN'T DRIVE.
   SOMEBODY ELSE SHOULD DRIVE.
 - OKAY.

1297
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:38,450
SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE SHOULD
BE SAYING WE ARE FACING
A STATE OF EMERGENCY.

1298
01:05:38,484 --> 01:05:43,054
I'M GOING TO SPEAK AS HUD,
     AS THE DEPUTY ASSISTANT

1299
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:45,156
    OF SECRETARY OF HUD
      WHO COULDN'T MAKE IT,

1300
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,092
    AND C.N.N. IS GOING
     TO BE COVERING IT VE.

1301
01:05:47,126 --> 01:05:49,561
              Mike:
         <i>THIS CONFERENCE </i>
         <i>WAS TAKING PLA</i>

1302
01:05:49,595 --> 01:05:52,364
     <i>ON THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY</i>
           <i>OF KATRINA.</i>

1303
01:05:52,398 --> 01:05:55,700
   <i>A THOUSAND CONTRACTORS WHO </i>
   <i>WERE REBUILDING NEW ORLEANS</i>
         <i>WOULD BE THERE.</i>

1304
01:05:55,735 --> 01:05:58,136
WHAT'S THAT?

1305
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,438
OH MY GOD.

1306
01:06:00,473 --> 01:06:03,008
     MAYOR RAY NAGIN COMING
          IS A BIT MORE

1307
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,909
        THAN WE EXPECTED
          WOULD HAPPEN.

1308
01:06:04,944 --> 01:06:07,579
              Mike:
 <i>WHEN WE HATCHED OUR SCHEME</i>

1309
01:06:07,613 --> 01:06:10,181
     <i>WE TOLD THIS GUY--</i>
 <i>THE CONFERENCE ORGANIZER--</i>

1310
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:13,885
       <i>THAT WE REPRESENTED</i>
       <i>ALPHONSO JACKSON,</i>
       <i>THE HEAD OF HUD. </i>

1311
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:18,857
   <i>WHEN THE MAYOR AND GOVERNOR</i>
      <i>FOUND OUT THAT JACKSON</i>
         <i>WOULD BE THERE,</i>

1312
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,859
 <i>THEY HAD TO BE THERE TOO.</i>

1313
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:25,130
           <i>ONCE AGAIN,</i>
       <i>THE KEYNOTE SPEAKER</i>
     <i>WOULDN'T SHOW UP,</i>

1314
01:06:25,164 --> 01:06:28,233
     <i>BUT HIS ASSISTANT WOULD.</i>

1315
01:06:28,267 --> 01:06:30,568
      <i>WOULD THE MAYOR NOTICE</i>
 <i>THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG?</i>

1316
01:06:30,603 --> 01:06:32,771
          <i>AND WHAT WOULD</i>
      <i>THE CONTRACTORS THINK</i>

1317
01:06:32,805 --> 01:06:35,540
         <i>OF HUD'S RADICAL</i>
 <i>NEW APPROACH TO PUBLIC HOUSING,</i>

1318
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,642
      <i>AN APPROACH THAT COULD</i>
         <i>COST THEM MONEY</i>

1319
01:06:37,677 --> 01:06:40,211
     <i>AND EVEN PUT SOME</i>
      <i>OF THEM OUT OF A JOB?</i>

1320
01:06:43,149 --> 01:06:45,717
           <i>( applause )</i>

1321
01:06:51,457 --> 01:06:54,726
...OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT
OF HOUSING AND URBAN
DEVELOPMENT.

1322
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:02,667
        SO IT'S AN HONOR
    TO SHARE THE STAGE

1323
01:07:02,702 --> 01:07:05,003
      WITH OUR TWO PARTNERS
          IN RECOVERY,

1324
01:07:05,037 --> 01:07:08,106
        WITH RENE OSWIN,
        REPRESENTING HUD,

1325
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,944
WHO'S DEFINITELY ONE
OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT PARTNERS
IN THIS REBUILDING EFFORT,

1326
01:07:12,978 --> 01:07:17,148
AND MAYOR NAGIN OF NEW ORLEANS,
WHOSE CHALLENGES ARE ENORMOUS.

1327
01:07:17,183 --> 01:07:19,851
     AND I ALSO WANT TO STOP
         AND THANK RENE,

1328
01:07:19,885 --> 01:07:21,720
      WHO'S HERE FROM HUD.

1329
01:07:21,754 --> 01:07:25,557
HUD HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE
INCREDIBLE PARTNER WITH US.

1330
01:07:25,591 --> 01:07:29,227
  WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF DOING
SOME REALLY UNIQUE THINGS,

1331
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:33,198
         SOMETHING THAT
WE COULD HAVE NEVER TACKLED
IN THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS,

1332
01:07:33,232 --> 01:07:37,001
      AND NOW WE ARE POISED
    AND POSITIONED TO ENHANCE

1333
01:07:37,036 --> 01:07:40,004
          <i>PUBLIC HOUSING</i>
   <i>IN THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS.</i>

1334
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:42,774
      <i>YOU KNOW, THERE'S LOTS</i>
 <i>OF INFORMATION OUT THERE,</i>

1335
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:45,944
           <i>THERE'S LOTS</i>
   <i>OF MISINFORMATION OUT THERE.</i>

1336
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,613
        BUT I HAVE
      A FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF

1337
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:53,084
    THAT TRUTH AND LIE CANNOT
     STAY IN THE SAME PLACE
        AT THE SAME TIME.

1338
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,320
      REMINDS ME OF A STORY
          I ONCE HEARD.

1339
01:07:55,354 --> 01:07:58,957
   <i>TRUTH AND LIE WENT SWIMMING</i>
  <i>ONE DAY IN LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN.</i>

1340
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:03,728
    THEY WENT SKINNY-DIPPING,
SO THEY LAID THEIR CLOTHES
          ON THE BANKS.

1341
01:08:03,763 --> 01:08:06,097
     AND THEY WERE OUT THERE
HAVING A REALLY GOOD TIME.

1342
01:08:06,132 --> 01:08:09,467
   <i>BUT THEN LIE ALL OF A SUDDEN</i>
       <i>JUMPED OUT THE WATER</i>

1343
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:13,571
     PUT TRUTH'S CLOTHES ON
    AND STARTED RUNNING DOWN
        ESPLANADE--

1344
01:08:13,606 --> 01:08:15,340
     ELYSIAN FIELDS AVENUE.

1345
01:08:15,374 --> 01:08:20,011
     TRUTH GOT OUT THE WATER
 AND STARTED RUNNING AFTER LIE.

1346
01:08:20,045 --> 01:08:22,580
    SO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
        WHAT YOU HAD WAS

1347
01:08:22,615 --> 01:08:26,251
    A WELL-DRESSED LIE BEING
     CHASED BY NAKED TRUTH.

1348
01:08:26,285 --> 01:08:28,219
           <i>( applause )</i>

1349
01:08:28,254 --> 01:08:30,088
          THAT'S QUITE
     A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW.

1350
01:08:30,122 --> 01:08:32,524
  NOTHING LIKE THAT TO MAKE YOU
      FEEL A BIT NAKED, EH?

1351
01:08:32,558 --> 01:08:37,061
    UH... DEAR FRIENDS,

1352
01:08:37,096 --> 01:08:41,199
  IT IS WITH THE GREATEST JOY
  THAT I ANNOUNCE TO YOU TODAY

1353
01:08:41,233 --> 01:08:44,602
    A BRAND-NEW DEPARTMENT OF
 HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT.

1354
01:08:44,637 --> 01:08:48,139
          EVERYTHING IS
         GOING TO CHANGE
      ABOUT THE WAY WE WORK

1355
01:08:48,174 --> 01:08:52,076
        AND THE CHANGE IS
    GOING TO START RIGHT HERE
      TODAY IN NEW ORLEANS.

1356
01:08:52,111 --> 01:08:55,146
            UNTIL LAST WEEK,
            OUR M.O. HERE AT HUD

1357
01:08:55,181 --> 01:08:58,049
      WAS TO TEAR DOWN PUBLIC
      HOUSING WHENEVER WE COULD.

1358
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:00,018
                 LIKE MANY FOLKS
                 IN WASHINGTON,

1359
01:09:00,052 --> 01:09:03,054
         WE THOUGHT
         THE PROJECTS CAUSED
         CRIME AND UNEMPLOYMENT.

1360
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:04,956
         WE WERE WRONG.

1361
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:09,327
        WHEN WE TORE DOWN
ST. THOMAS AND REPLACED IT
    WITH MIXED-INCOME FLATS,

1362
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:13,264
            ONLY ONE
     OF 27 FORMER RESIDENTS
    EVER MADE IT BACK.

1363
01:09:13,299 --> 01:09:15,600
     AND THE REST HAVE FACED
         MANY PROBLEMS,

1364
01:09:15,634 --> 01:09:19,103
          IN SOME CASES
    EVEN HOMELESSNESS.
      IT JUST DIDN'T WORK.

1365
01:09:19,138 --> 01:09:21,539
          WE WON'T MAKE
        THAT ERROR AGAIN.

1366
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:24,175
         THIS AFTERNOON
         WE WILL BEGIN TO REOPEN

1367
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:27,412
     ALL PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS
     IN NEW ORLEANS

1368
01:09:27,446 --> 01:09:30,582
      AND ALLOW
      THESE AMERICANS TO BE PART
      OF THEIR CITY ONCE AGAIN.

1369
01:09:30,616 --> 01:09:32,650
       <i>BUT OPENING DOORS--</i>

1370
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:35,386
        THANK YOU.

1371
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:41,159
        BUT OPENING DOORS
        WON'T BE ENOUGH.
          AS YOU KNOW,

1372
01:09:41,193 --> 01:09:44,062
  THE MAIN REASON NEW ORLEANS
  WAS SO VULNERABLE TO KATRINA

1373
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,264
    WAS THE DESTRUCTION
        OF THE WETLANDS.

1374
01:09:46,298 --> 01:09:49,300
         I AM VERY VERY
    VERY PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE

1375
01:09:49,335 --> 01:09:52,937
      THAT EXXON AND SHELL
     HAVE AGREED TO FINANCE
    WETLANDS REBUILDING

1376
01:09:52,972 --> 01:09:56,074
  FROM PART OF THE $60 BILLION
      IN PROFITS THIS YEAR.

       <i>AS J. STEPHEN SIMON,</i>
  <i>EXN VICE PRESIDENT, WRITES,</i>

1382
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:19,063
      LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
    WE WILL REBUILD NOT
        JUST NEW ORLEANS,

1383
01:10:19,098 --> 01:10:21,733
         WE WILL REBUILD
    THE AMERICAN DREAM.

    PLEASE COME JOIN US
 AT THE LAFITTE HOUSING COMPLEX

1385
01:10:25,571 --> 01:10:29,440

      CEREMONY IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE PLENARY SESSION.

1386
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,410
          THIS IS WHAT
    WE'RE ALL HERE FOR,
    SO LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN.

1387
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:34,512
        LET'S BRING
        NEW ORLEANS BACK.

         <i>I THOUGHT IT WAS</i>
         <i>VERY UPLIFTING. </i>

1389
01:10:38,384 --> 01:10:41,185
  THIS HAS BEEN A BIG PROBLEM.
      A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT
          TO COME HOME

1390
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:44,088
    AND THEY HAVE BEEN
        UNABLE TO DO SO,

1391
01:10:44,123 --> 01:10:46,925
    SO I THOUGHT IT WAS
    A VERY POSITIVE MESSAGE.

1392
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:49,560
      OH, VERY ENCOURAGING.
  AND WHAT'S REALLY ENCOURAGING

1393
01:10:49,595 --> 01:10:52,597
    IN PARTICULAR IS NOT ONLY
    GETTING PEOPLE BACK HOME

1394
01:10:52,631 --> 01:10:55,733
    AND HELPING THEM REBUILD,
    BUT THE RECOGNITION

1395
01:10:55,768 --> 01:10:57,835
      THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL
      WITH MOTHER NATURE.

1396
01:10:57,870 --> 01:11:02,073
    AND THAT EXXON IS GOING
    TO MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT
          CONTRIBUTION

1397
01:11:02,107 --> 01:11:05,677
    TO RESTORE WETLANDS IS--
     IT'S VERY ENCOURAGING.

1400
01:11:10,816 --> 01:11:13,117
 <i>WHEN THE CONTRACTORS HEARD</i>

01:11:24,063 --> 01:11:26,431
      - MIND IF I TALK
        TO YOU OVER HERE?
      - ABSOLUTELY.

1407
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:27,999
     - DO YOU HAVE A CARD?
     - NO, NOT TODAY.

1408
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,168
              Mike:
     <i>AND THIS TIME WE'D</i>
      <i>GOTTEN AWAY TH IT...</i>

1409
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:33,204
 - ALL RIGHT, THANKS.  BYE-BYE.
 - <i>...OR SO WE THOUGHT.</i>

1410
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:36,207
THE CITY AND THE STATE
BOTH SAY THEY'VE NOT HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS,

1411
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:38,977
THAT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
COMES AS A SURPRISE TO
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

1412
01:11:39,011 --> 01:11:41,245
AND THE MAYOR'S OFFICE.
WHY WOULD HUD DO THIS

1413
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,281
WITHOUT CONSULTING
THE CITY AND THE STATE?

1414
01:11:43,315 --> 01:11:47,118
WELL, IT'S SUCH A--
WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS
WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH THEM.

1415
01:11:47,152 --> 01:11:49,687
YOU HAVE NO CARDS.
YOU SAY YOU'RE NEW
TO THE AGENCY?

1416
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,323
         I HAVE A CARD, BUT IT'S
         BACK AT THE OFFICE.

1417
01:11:52,358 --> 01:11:54,492
- I'LL GET IT TO YOU.
- WHERE IS YOUR P.R. TEAM?

1418
01:11:54,526 --> 01:11:56,394
  - Mike: <i>I'M RIGHT HERE, HI.</i>
  - UM... THERE.

1419
01:11:56,428 --> 01:11:58,196
     - HI, YOU'RE WITH HUD?
     - YES, I AM.

1420
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,532
    - DO YOU HAVE A CARD?
    - THERE'S AN ENTIRE HUD
      HOUSING PROJECT THERE

1421
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,401
    - LEFT UNFINISHED.
    - YEAH.

1422
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:05,370
      THERE ARE SOME SAYING
      THAT THIS IS A FARCE,

1423
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:08,973
      THAT YOU'RE NOT TRULY
    WITH HUD AND THAT THIS IS
NOT AN ACTUAL ANNOUNCEMENT.

1424
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:12,276
        WELL, THEY CAN SAY
        WHATEVER THEY WANT.
        WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

1425
01:12:12,311 --> 01:12:15,113
    - WHERE IS YOUR OFFICE?
    - IN WASHINGTON.

1426
01:12:15,147 --> 01:12:16,948
      WHERE IN WASHINGTON.

1427
01:12:16,982 --> 01:12:20,084
HE DID JUST-- HE JUST
JOINED THE AGENCY
FROM FRANCE.

1428
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:21,619
         - HE'S A--
         - FROM FRANCE?

1429
01:12:21,653 --> 01:12:23,921
YEAH, HE'S BEEN
A SPECIAL ATTACHE

1430
01:12:23,956 --> 01:12:26,257
TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF THE INTERIOR IN FRANCE.

1431
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:28,559
                WHY ARE YOU
                SO SKEPTICAL?

1432
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,863
    WE JUST HEARD THE SPEECH
      AND I HAVE A NEWSCAST
          VERY SHORTLY.

1433
01:12:31,897 --> 01:12:33,398
        I NEED TO CONFIRM
            IF IT WAS

1434
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:35,500
          A REAL SPEECH
        FROM HUD OR NOT.

1435
01:12:35,534 --> 01:12:38,403
THE GOVERNOR AND THE MAYOR
    KNEW NOTHING OF IT.
    THEY WERE SHOCKED.

1436
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:41,806
     WE DESPERATELY NEED TO KNOW
     IF THIS IS REAL OR NOT.

1437
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,075
     HE'S STANDING RIGHT HERE,
     THE MAN WHO JUST APPARENTLY

1438
01:12:44,109 --> 01:12:46,110
             COMMITTED THIS HOAX
             ON YOUR DEPARTMENT.

1439
01:12:46,145 --> 01:12:48,880
     I'M ON THE PHONE
     WITH HUD RIGHT NOW
     AND THEY SAY YOU'RE A LIAR.

1440
01:12:48,914 --> 01:12:51,215
    OKAY, WELL, THEY CAN SAY
    WHATEVER THEY WANT.

1441
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,718
     - I'M SORRY.
     - THEY CAN SAY
       WHATEVER THEY LIKE.

1442
01:12:53,752 --> 01:12:56,587
          "THEY CAN SAY
          WHATEVER THEY LIKE."
          BUT YOU WORK FOR THEM

1443
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:59,490
    - DON'T YOU,
      AS A DEPUTY SECRETARY?
    - THAT'S RIGHT.

1444
01:12:59,525 --> 01:13:02,894
NOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN
DISCOVERED, DO YOU WANT TO
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU DID IT?

1445
01:13:02,928 --> 01:13:04,896
                IF YOU'RE TRYING
                TO MAKE A POINT,
                WHY DON'T YOU

1446
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,631
                COME OVER HERE
                AND TELL ME WHY
                YOU DID THIS?

1447
01:13:06,665 --> 01:13:09,033
            ALL RIGHT, MAN.
            I'LL CALL YOU
            IN A FEW MINUTES.

1448
01:13:09,068 --> 01:13:11,636
              BUT IT IS A HOAX--
              A MASSIVE HOAX
              PERPETRATED TODAY.

1449
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:14,038
     - YOU JUST PULLED OFF
       A HECK OF A HOAX.
     - THANK YOU.

1450
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:16,374
IT-- I MEAN, I WOULD
SAY THAT, YOU KNOW,

1451
01:13:16,408 --> 01:13:18,743
HUD IS PULLING OFF
A HOAX BY PRETENDING THAT

1452
01:13:18,777 --> 01:13:21,212
TEARING DOWN AFFORDABLE HOUSING
IS WHAT'S GONNA SOLVE IT.

1453
01:13:21,246 --> 01:13:23,281
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
THEY'VE BEEN DOING UNTIL NOW.

1454
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:26,918
THIS IS A TIME WHEN
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE
CLAMORING TO GET BACK IN.

1455
01:13:26,952 --> 01:13:30,455
THEY WANT TO GET BACK
INTO THEIR HOUSING AND
THEY DESERVE TO BE THERE.

1456
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,023
        IT'S CRAZY.

1457
01:13:32,057 --> 01:13:35,693
     - AND WORTH LYING
       TO ALL THESE PEOPLE?
     - OH, ABSOLUTELY.

1458
01:13:35,727 --> 01:13:37,662
ABSOLUTELY.
ACTUALLY TELLING THE TRUTH.

1459
01:13:37,696 --> 01:13:41,866
THIS IS ACTUALLY TRUTH-TELLING
WHERE NORMALLY THERE
WOULD ONLY BE LIES.

1460
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,402
      <i>( jazz band playing )</i>

1461
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:50,741
HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE
TO REMEDIATE WHAT YOU
SEE HERE TODAY

1462
01:13:50,776 --> 01:13:53,244
AND MAKE IT INHABITABLE,
SAY, NEXT WEEK?

1463
01:13:54,613 --> 01:13:56,948
    JUST TAKE OFF THE--
    TAKE OFF THE COVERS HERE.

1464
01:13:56,982 --> 01:13:58,916
OH YEAH, THAT'S
A GOOD START, YEAH?

1465
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:00,384
         - ABSOLUTELY.
         - THAT'S IT.

1466
01:14:00,419 --> 01:14:02,587
             FINALLY
      WE WILL BE REOPENING

1467
01:14:02,621 --> 01:14:04,856
         PUBLIC HOUSING
    FOR THE RESIDENTS--

1468
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:07,458
        FOR THE WORKFORCE
  THAT'S GOING TO MOVE BACK IN

1469
01:14:07,493 --> 01:14:10,027
        AND AGAIN REBUILD
          NEW ORLEANS.

1470
01:14:10,062 --> 01:14:12,163
     Sick, twisted, cruel--

1471
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:14,565
    those are all words used
      to describe the prank

1472
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,335
     on Louisiana officials
and about 1,000 contractors

1473
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:18,536
      in New Orleans today.

1474
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:21,439
        I'm deputy
      assistant secretary,

1475
01:14:21,473 --> 01:14:23,875
     to-- of the assistant,

1476
01:14:23,909 --> 01:14:26,644
    essentially, of Secretary
        Alphonso Jackson.

1477
01:14:26,678 --> 01:14:30,248
            Reporter:
  <i>Rene Oswin can't get his title</i>
 <i>right or his relationship</i>

1478
01:14:30,282 --> 01:14:32,283
     <i>to HUD secretary </i>
     <i>Alphonso Jackson.</i>

1479
01:14:32,317 --> 01:14:34,752
          ( cheering )

1480
01:14:34,786 --> 01:14:37,421
           <i>After taking</i>
      <i>the mayor for a ride,</i>

         <i>Housing Project.</i>

1483
01:14:42,327 --> 01:14:44,462
Mr. Oswin, you're not even
on the directory of HUD.

1484
01:14:44,496 --> 01:14:46,731
You're not even listed--
don't have a phone number.

1485
01:14:46,765 --> 01:14:49,267
              It's come to that,
              has it?

1486
01:14:49,301 --> 01:14:53,604
        It's come to that.
        Thanks for being the one
        to break the news.

1487
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:56,007
        HANO, the Housing
    Authority of New Orleans

1488
01:14:56,041 --> 01:14:58,009
    says this is simply
    a cruel cruel joke,

1489
01:14:58,043 --> 01:15:00,545
      trying to give people
     some kind of fake hope

1490
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,680
that they were going to be
    able to move back.

1491
01:15:02,714 --> 01:15:04,815
         <i>( man speaking )</i>

1492
01:15:20,732 --> 01:15:22,400
            ...THIS WHOLE
            PRESS CONFERENCE.

1493
01:15:22,434 --> 01:15:24,869
        I GUESS IT'S JUST
    TO CALL THEIR HAND.

1494
01:15:24,903 --> 01:15:28,206
      I RESPECT THIS HOAX,
    BECAUSE MAYBE IT'LL TAKE
        A HOAX LIKE THIS

1495
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,209
     TO BRING THEM OUT HERE
        TO SEE WHAT WE'RE
         GOING THROUGH.

1496
01:15:31,243 --> 01:15:33,377
SO IF THE HOAX WHAT IT BE,
     A HOAX IS WHAT WE GOT.

1497
01:15:33,412 --> 01:15:36,280
        AND I AIN'T MAD.
        I'M GRABBING ME
         SOME BARBECUE.

1498
01:15:38,483 --> 01:15:40,918
            Juakali:
           <i>I THINK WHAT</i>
         <i>YOU GUYS EXPOSED</i>

1499
01:15:40,953 --> 01:15:43,421
      IS THE FACT THAT HUD
COULD DO THESE GREAT THINGS

1500
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:45,189
    IF THEY WANTED TO.

1501
01:15:45,224 --> 01:15:48,059
        SECONDLY, YOU GOT
 THE ATTENTION OF THE RESIDENTS

1502
01:15:48,093 --> 01:15:50,228
      SO NOW THEY'RE GONNA
          BEGIN TO ASK,

1503
01:15:50,262 --> 01:15:52,496
      <i>"WELL, WHY AREN'T YOU</i>
      <i>DOING THESE THINGS?" </i>

1504
01:15:52,531 --> 01:15:55,333
     <i>AND NUMBER THREE,</i>
  <i>YOU'RE CREATING A CONTROVERSY</i>

1505
01:15:55,367 --> 01:15:59,370
    TO FEED OFF, TO ORGANIZE
    AND TO BUILD A STRUGGLE

1506
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:00,972
    TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

1507
01:16:01,006 --> 01:16:03,407
        SO IN MY OPINION,
      EVERYTHING Y'ALL DID

1508
01:16:03,442 --> 01:16:04,842
         WAS EXCELLENT.

1509
01:16:14,786 --> 01:16:16,454
              Mike:
   <i>IT HAD ALL BEEN WORTHWHILE.</i>

1510
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:19,790
             <i>WE WERE</i>
       <i>ON TOP OF THE WORLD.</i>

1511
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:23,661
      <i>BUT THEN REALITY BEGAN</i>
           <i>TO SINK IN.</i>

1512
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:30,801
       <i>WE'D MADE A SPLASH,</i>

1513
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:33,104
          <i>BUT WE HADN'T</i>
         <i>FIXED THE WORLD.</i>

1514
01:16:33,138 --> 01:16:36,941
 <i>THE FREE MARKET WAS STILL</i>
     <i>DESTROYING NEW ORLEANS.</i>

1515
01:16:40,312 --> 01:16:43,881
       <i>ALL OVER THE WORLD,</i>
 <i>PEOPLE WERE LOSING THEIR HOMES.</i>

1516
01:16:46,885 --> 01:16:48,953
       <i>CLIMATE CHANGE KEPT</i>
          <i>GETTING WORSE.</i>

1517
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:56,694
          <i>AND IN BHOPAL,</i>
   <i>PEOPLE CONTINUED TO SUFFER.</i>

1518
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:06,003
     <i>WE REALLY DID NEED</i>
     <i>TO FIX THE WORLD. </i>

1519
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,673
      <i>BUT IT WAS GONNA TAKE</i>
     <i>MORE THAN TWO GUYS</i>

1520
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:11,075
         <i>WITH CHEAP SUITS</i>
     <i>AND FAKE WEBSITES.</i>

1521
01:17:13,445 --> 01:17:15,713
          <i>IT WOULD TAKE</i>
         <i>MILLIONS OF US.</i>

1522
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:22,520
     ( shouting in French )

1523
01:17:29,695 --> 01:17:32,730
              Mike:
     <i>BUT EVEN AS OLD REGIMES</i>
         <i>WERE SWEPT AWAY,</i>

1524
01:17:32,764 --> 01:17:35,333
     <i>WE KNEW THAT REAL CHANGE</i>
       <i>WOULDN'T COME EASY.</i>

1525
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:40,137
         <i>AFTER ALL,</i>
       <i>THE FREE-MARKET CULT</i>
         <i>WAS STILL HERE.</i>

1526
01:17:40,172 --> 01:17:41,505
        - WEALTH.
        - MONEY.

1527
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:42,540
        - PRIVATIZATION.
        - WEALTH.

1528
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:43,607
         - MONEY.
         - FREE MARKETS.

1529
01:17:43,642 --> 01:17:45,109
        - PRIVATIZATION.
        - OWNERSHIP.

1530
01:17:45,143 --> 01:17:48,045
     A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.
     NOW WE CAN AFFORD THAT.

1531
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,615
              Mike:
       <i>REMEMBER THESE GUYS?</i>

01:18:01,293 --> 01:18:04,095
     <i>WE NEEDED A REALLY</i>
         <i>AMBITIOUS PLAN,</i>

1535
01:18:04,129 --> 01:18:06,731
     <i>BECAUSE ALL WE EVER READ</i>
     <i>IN THE NEWSPAPERS</i>

1536
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:09,667
     <i>WAS HOW WE NEEDED TO PUT</i>
 <i>EVERYTHING BACK ON TRACK,</i>

1537
01:18:09,701 --> 01:18:12,703
     <i>BACK TO HOW IT WAS</i>
      <i>BEFORE IT FELL APART.</i>

1538
01:18:14,139 --> 01:18:16,974
          <i>BUT HOW IT WAS</i>
         <i>WAS THE PROBLEM.</i>

1539
01:18:17,008 --> 01:18:20,511
      <i>WE NEEDED TO SHOW WHAT</i>
   <i>REAL CHANGE COULD LOOK LIKE.</i>

1540
01:18:23,348 --> 01:18:25,716
     <i>SO TOGETHER WITH A WHOLE</i>
         <i>LOT OF FRIENDS,</i>

1541
01:18:25,751 --> 01:18:28,686
 <i>WE WOULD BLANKET MANHATTAN</i>
       <i>WITH 100,000 COPIES</i>

1542
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,088
 <i>OF OUR VERY OWN NEWSPAPER.</i>

1543
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,924
           <i>WE'D CALL IT</i>
      <i>"THE NEW YORK TIMES."</i>

1544
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:38,896
   <i>EXCEPT OUR "NEW YORK TIMES"</i>
      <i>WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT</i>
         <i>DIFFERENT.</i>

1545
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:43,901
   <i>OURS WOULD BE SET SIX MONTHS</i>
          <i>IN THE FUTURE.</i>

1546
01:18:43,935 --> 01:18:46,137
     <i>IT WOULD SHOW WHAT</i>
           <i>COULD HAPPEN</i>

1547
01:18:46,171 --> 01:18:48,906
         <i>IF WE SET</i>
      <i>OUR IMAGINATION FREE.</i>

1548
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:57,948
        THINGS HAVE
        GOTTEN PRETTY BAD
        AND I THINK IT'S HARD

1549
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,351
        FOR PEOPLE TO IMAGINE
        THE WORLD WORKING
        ANOTHER WAY.

1550
01:19:00,385 --> 01:19:02,653
        SO WE'RE TRYING TO,
        AS REALISTICALLY
        AS POSSIBLE,

1551
01:19:02,687 --> 01:19:04,822
             PRESENT THIS WORLD
             AS IT COULD BE.

1552
01:19:04,856 --> 01:19:09,460
              Andy:
       <i>THEY JUST BROUGHT UP</i>
         <i>THE PROOF</i>

1553
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:13,664
 OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES" AND IT
  LOOKS UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE.

1554
01:19:13,698 --> 01:19:15,633
 <i>REALLY GOOD.</i>

1555
01:19:25,710 --> 01:19:28,579
      The obvious question:
how the heck did you do it?

1556
01:19:28,613 --> 01:19:31,081
     Andy, do you want to start?
     How long were you working
     on this thing

1557
01:19:31,116 --> 01:19:34,285
 - and how many of you?
 - There were a lot of us.
   It wasn't just the Yes Men.

1558
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:37,488
It was a large group of people.
We were just one of many groups.

1559
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:40,124
   <i>It was an idea that sparked</i>
 <i>a lot of people's imaginations.</i>

1560
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:41,992
           <i>They wanted</i>
       <i>to see this happen.</i>

1561
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,361
 And that's sort of the message
     of the paper as well--

1562
01:19:44,396 --> 01:19:47,364
        is "Great.
        We elected Obama
      and that's fantastic,

1563
01:19:47,399 --> 01:19:48,999
      <i>but now the real work</i>
             <i>begins."</i>

1564
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,268
              Mike:
     <i>The idea was to put out</i>
  <i>something that was optimistic,</i>

1565
01:19:51,303 --> 01:19:53,704
       <i>that says we can do</i>
     <i>all these things.</i>
             <i>Why not?</i>

1566
01:19:53,738 --> 01:19:56,874
  We created the system that we
have now, so why not create
    a good one instead?

1567
01:19:56,908 --> 01:19:59,643
      - WOW, VERY GOOD.
      - LET ME TIE YOU UP.

1568
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:02,346
     - THIS IS THE BIG DAY.
     - <i>"NEW YORK TIMES."</i>

1569
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,216
      7:00 A.M. RUSH HOUR,
        THIS IS THE TIME

1570
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,517
        TO GET THE PAPERS
        OUT THERE.

1571
01:20:06,551 --> 01:20:09,119
- MORNING. FREE "TIMES."
- Woman: <i>FREE "NEW YORK TIMES."</i>

1572
01:20:09,154 --> 01:20:11,388

    OF "THE NEW YORK TIMES."

1575
01:20:18,597 --> 01:20:19,930
              Man:
      <i>FREE "NEW YORK TIMES."</i>

1576
01:20:19,965 --> 01:20:21,832
          IS THIS REAL?

1577
01:20:21,867 --> 01:20:24,602
     - IT'S FAKE, RIGHT?
     - WHO PUBLISHES THIS?

1578
01:20:24,636 --> 01:20:27,037
        CAN I GRAB
      ANOTHER ONE OF THESE?

1579
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,906
             - WHAT?
             - WHAT?

1580
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,209
"NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE
ACT PASSES."

1581
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:34,879
       <i>SO THE PATRIOT--</i>
       <i>THE PATRIOT ACT REPEALED.</i>

1582
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:37,014
             Woman:
   <i>"MAXIMUM WAGE LAW SUCCEEDS."</i>

1583
01:20:37,048 --> 01:20:38,549
    GOOD LUCK WITH THAT ONE.

1584
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:42,920
  THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.
BUT... IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

1585
01:20:42,954 --> 01:20:44,722
IT'S A DREAM NEWSPAPER.

1586
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:46,524
     <i>RIGHT?</i>

1587
01:20:46,558 --> 01:20:49,793
 <i>IT'S LIKE YOU WAKE UP AND ALL</i>
 <i>THE THINGS THAT YOU WANTED</i>

1588
01:20:49,828 --> 01:20:51,795
    BECAME THE NEWS.

1589
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:54,365
         THE WAR'S OVER!

1590
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:56,467
              Mike:
     <i>OUR FAKE NEWS WAS A HIT.</i>

1591
01:20:56,501 --> 01:20:58,269
NEWSPAPER!
NEWS FROM THE FUTURE.

1592
01:20:58,303 --> 01:21:00,938
     <i>BUT WOULD THE REAL NEWS</i>
           <i>PICK IT UP?</i>

1593
01:21:00,972 --> 01:21:04,174
YOU DON'T WORK
FOR "THE NEW YORK TIMES."
WHO IS IT THAT YOU WORK FOR

1594
01:21:04,209 --> 01:21:06,544
- HANDING THIS OUT?
- A GUY NAMED JOHN-- JOHN SMITH.

1595
01:21:06,578 --> 01:21:08,345
      - YEAH, JOHN SMITH.
      - JOHN SMITH?

1596
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:11,515
    IT'S "THE NEW YORK TIMES,"
    SPECIAL EDITION.  IS THERE
    ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT?

1597
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:14,018
YEAH, IT'S NOT
"THE NEW YORK TIMES."

1598
01:21:14,052 --> 01:21:15,519
     <i>Read all about it.</i>

1599
01:21:15,554 --> 01:21:19,089
  <i>"The New York Times" declares</i>
     <i>the war in Iraq is over.</i>

1600
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:22,393
Some commuters got
their hands on what
looks like a special edition

1601
01:21:22,427 --> 01:21:24,828
of "The New York Times."
As you might have
guessed though,

1602
01:21:24,863 --> 01:21:27,932
     - <i>it's a fake.</i>
     - ( speaking German )

1603
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:32,202
      ( speaking Russian )

1604
01:21:34,739 --> 01:21:39,176
    We printed a paper
    with the headlines
     that we'd like to see.

1605
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:41,178
        So if these were
          the headlines

1606
01:21:41,212 --> 01:21:43,814
that people were so excited
      to read this morning,

1607
01:21:43,848 --> 01:21:45,416
     let's make them happen.

1608
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,952
           Lili Taylor:
         <i>WE'RE GONNA HAVE</i>
     <i>TO EXERCISE SOME MUSCLES</i>

1609
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:50,554

     OR THAT HAVE ATROPHIED.

1610
01:21:50,589 --> 01:21:52,489

         A CIVIC MUSCLE,

         <i>OUR GOVERNMENT.</i>

1613
01:21:58,263 --> 01:22:01,365
  MARCH INTO CITY HALL AND SAY,
"HERE, WE'VE GOT T SOLUTIONS."

1614
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:05,436
       Frances Fox Piven:
       <i>WE CAN THINK OF THE</i>
          <i>DIFFERENT WAYS</i>

1615
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:09,039
     THAT WE CAN CONTRIBUTE
     TO A MOVEMENT THAT SAYS

1616
01:22:09,074 --> 01:22:12,176
        BUSINESS AS USUAL
        IS UNACCEPTABLE,

01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:14,511
          <i>BECAUSE PEOPLE</i>
          <i>ARE BEING HURT</i>

  - LET'S GO!
  - WE'RE GOING, WE'RE GOING.

01:22:31,162 --> 01:22:35,699
MAKE CHANGE HAPPEN.
PUT YOUR EFFORT ON THE LINE
TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

1624
01:22:35,734 --> 01:22:37,868
AND THAT'S WHAT,
KINDA, WE DID HERE.

1625
01:22:37,902 --> 01:22:40,537

IT'S WHAT...

1626
01:22:40,572 --> 01:22:42,439
YEAH, IT'S KIND OF, YEAH.

      - OH BOY!
      - NO, I KNOW, YEAH!

1628
01:22:44,442 --> 01:22:48,345
            AND IF A FEW PEOPLE
            AT THE TOP CAN MAKE
            THE BAD NEWS HAPPEN,

1629
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,581
