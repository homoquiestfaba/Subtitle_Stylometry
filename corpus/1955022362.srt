1
00:00:17,372 --> 00:00:20,106
You are watching a master at work.

2
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:21,691
Bruce Lee:

3
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:28,661
Five feet, seven and a half inches tall,
135 pounds of martial art dynamite.

4
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:58,491
Hong Kong, in February of 1973,
is a bustling island...

5
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:01,571
...of modern industry
and commerce that plays against...

6
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:04,771
...a backdrop of culture
and tradition that has remained...

7
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:08,348
...largely unchanged for over 1,000 years.

8
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:11,731
The biggest news coming
from within the city these days...

9
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,771
...is the rapid growth
of its motion picture industry.

10
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:19,251
Formerly an enterprise of no consequence
to anyone but local theater owners...

11
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:22,491
...the Hong Kong movie industry is
now attracting the attention...

12
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:25,652
...of the most powerful film studios
in the world.

13
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:29,671
The reason for this sudden surge
in interest is the meteoric...

14
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:35,087
...rise to fame of a 32-year-old man
named Bruce Lee.

15
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:41,171
Lee's dynamic on-screen presence,
coupled with an audience empathy...

16
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:43,531
...that cuts across all cultural boundaries...

17
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:47,411
...have resulted in his films
shattering box office records.

18
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:51,051
Producers the world over have come
to see in Lee the key...

19
00:02:51,052 --> 00:02:54,411
...that will unlock the door
to the future of the industry.

20
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:59,371
They begin to flood the young artist
with offers that a year ago would've been...

21
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:01,571
...impossible for him to have imagined.

22
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:05,371
After years of battling against cultural
and professional bigotry...

23
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:09,931
...economic and emotional hardship,
and the exhausting effort required...

24
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:12,030
...to sustain the integrity of his art...

25
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:15,371
...Lee's perseverance has finally
been rewarded.

26
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:19,984
He has become the most sought after
motion picture actor in the world.

27
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:23,131
With such power now at his disposal...

28
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:28,111
...Lee could easily choose to rest
on his laurels and play it safe by making...

29
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:32,491
...the kind of formula pictures that
are now being offered him on a daily basis.

30
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:35,951
But the very notion of formulas
and methods...

31
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:38,983
...hold no appeal whatsoever
for this young man.

32
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:44,191
Instead, Lee is presently in the midst
of filming The Game of Death...

33
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:48,551
...what he terms a multi-level film,
in which his personal philosophy...

34
00:03:48,552 --> 00:03:52,271
...of martial art is being presented
for the first time.

35
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:55,511
He's returning to this film
after a brief hiatus...

36
00:03:55,512 --> 00:03:59,871
...having spent the fall of the previous year
filming three sequences...

37
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,970
...the finale, it turns out, of the film.

38
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:07,471
Lee performs the work and assumes
the responsibility of eight people...

39
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:09,711
...in the creation of this film.

40
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:15,132
He's the director, the producer,
the choreographer and screenwriter.

41
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:21,210
In addition to having a hand
in set design, cinematography and lighting.

42
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:24,571
And, of course, he's the leading actor.

43
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:29,011
Martial artists who are not accustomed
to the camera must be taught how to sell...

44
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:33,191
...a strike or a reaction
for optimal dramatic effect.

45
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:35,871
Again, this falls to Lee to look after.

46
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:40,111
Take after take of precision martial art
choreography is performed.

47
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,991
Lee will spend, in some instances,
up to four days filming...

48
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,126
...what will turn out to be
only a five-minute fight sequence.

49
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:51,081
Lee is most demanding of himself.

50
00:04:51,672 --> 00:04:55,248
In this shot,
involving his handling a nunchaku...

51
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:59,551
...an ancient Oriental weapon
that was originally used as a rice flail...

52
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:04,311
...Lee will shoot no less than 10 takes
to capture one small sequence...

53
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:08,571
...that will appear on screen
for a mere 3.5 seconds.

54
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:13,730
He wants his films to have the stamp
of realism and believability.

55
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:20,151
Filming of The Game of Death is suspended
in October of 1972 when word reaches...

56
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:24,631
...the set that Warner Brothers is now
interested in co-producing his next film.

57
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:29,311
It will mark the first time in the history
of East-West relations that a Chinese...

58
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:33,571
...and American film studio
work together on a motion picture.

59
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:38,511
Lee views the co-production as a step
toward raising global understanding...

60
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,111
...of Chinese culture...

61
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:43,911
...and of having Chinese films accepted
into the international market.

62
00:05:43,912 --> 00:05:46,871
Did you look at many Mandarin movies
before you started...

63
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:48,471
...playing in your first one?
- Yes, yes, yes.

64
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,405
What did you think of them
when you saw them?

65
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:57,447
Quality-wise, I have to admit
that it's not quite up to the standard.

66
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:03,991
However, it is growing and it is getting
higher and higher and going toward...

67
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:06,591
...that standard which I would term quality.

68
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:09,551
Lee and his business partner,
Raymond Chow...

69
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:13,071
...fly to Los Angeles in November of 1972...

70
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,531
...to complete negotiations
with Warner Brothers for what will prove...

71
00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:20,602
...to be Lee's last and biggest film,
Enter the Dragon.

72
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:28,765
January to April of 1973, Lee gives over
to the filming of Enter the Dragon.

73
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:35,808
Again, he will oversee every aspect
of its production and post-production.

74
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:40,511
By the time his schedule allows him
to resume working on additional ideas...

75
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:46,427
...for The Game of Death, it's mid-July
of 1973, the final week of his life.

76
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:53,970
July 20, his last day on Earth, he will
spend discussing script ideas for the film.

77
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:58,791
On this fateful day,
Lee will, in characteristic optimism...

78
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:02,323
...look ahead to September 20, 1973.

79
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:05,911
He will write in his daytime diary
for this date...

80
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:09,284
...of his intention to resume filming
The Game of Death.

81
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:13,608
These will prove to be the last words
he will ever write.

82
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:19,211
Lee's passing hits the residents
of Hong Kong like a tidal wave.

83
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:22,331
Disbelief, shock, anger.

84
00:07:22,332 --> 00:07:25,831
There was so much more the young man
had to accomplish.

85
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:29,568
So much he had to live for.
And now, nothing.

86
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:33,931
Upon Lee's passing, so too...

87
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:38,911
...passes the movement towards realism
in Eastern cinema that he had pioneered.

88
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:44,286
Almost immediately, action films will
revert to being unbelievable and hokey.

89
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:49,551
Ironically, during an audio dictation
that Lee makes only weeks prior...

90
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,911
...to his passing, he comments
on this distinction between his films...

91
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:58,071
...and those made by other,
less dedicated production companies.

92
00:07:58,072 --> 00:08:02,763
I can tell you that as more
Bruce Lee films are shown...

93
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:07,591
...the audience will soon realize...

94
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:15,526
...not only in acting ability but in physical
skill as well, they will see the difference.

95
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:20,991
Five years after his passing, excerpts from
the film Lee had worked so feverishly on...

96
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:25,071
...during the final months
and hours of his life, are edited into...

97
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:28,444
...a film featuring Lee's title,
The Game of Death.

98
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:33,450
But the film bears no comparison
to Lee's original multi-level vision.

99
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:38,566
Without Lee's choreography notes,
script-outline and motif...

100
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:42,671
...the producers are uncertain what to do
with the 100 minutes of footage...

101
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,591
...they have in their possession.

102
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:47,971
Moreover, they discover that Lee
was such a perfectionist that...

103
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:52,331
...of the 100 minutes of footage they have
in hand, two-thirds turn out to be...

104
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:56,431
...outtakes and retakes,
shots that Lee himself had discarded...

105
00:08:56,432 --> 00:09:00,711
...for sequences in the film that he felt
were beneath his standard of quality.

106
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:03,791
They deem only 11 minutes
and 7 seconds...

107
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:06,871
...of the footage to be worthy
of inclusion in their film.

108
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:10,642
The rest, approximately 21 minutes worth,
they discard.

109
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:15,591
Intercutting actual footage of Lee
into fight sequences involving lookalikes...

110
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:19,271
...and even using cardboard cutouts
of Lee's head, the end result is...

111
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:22,611
...viewed by many as an exploitive
and grotesque joke...

112
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:25,126
...played on the great artist's legacy.

113
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:28,911
By now, even Lee's most zealous fans...

114
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:32,351
...are beginning to believe
that the original footage is gone.

115
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:36,671
And that it will never be possible
to see the footage Lee shot in its entirety...

116
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:40,885
...nor to ever learn what
his original storyline for the film was.

117
00:09:41,392 --> 00:09:46,751
In the fall of 1994, during research
conducted for a multi-volume book series...

118
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,371
...based on Lee's surviving writings,
Lee's original script...

119
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:54,601
...and choreography writings
for The Game of Death are recovered.

120
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:57,951
The writings confirm
what had long been suspected...

121
00:09:57,952 --> 00:10:01,871
...that Lee had shot considerably
more footage for The Game of Death...

122
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:03,911
...than had been seen to date.

123
00:10:03,912 --> 00:10:08,511
Another unexpected surprise is discovered
among his choreography writings.

124
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:12,361
His hand-written storyline,
12 pages in length...

125
00:10:12,472 --> 00:10:16,751
...and containing all scene breakdowns
and select dialogue passages...

126
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:21,011
...the original storyline stands
in sharp contrast to the one presented in...

127
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:23,711
...the film released under the same name.

128
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:26,151
After the discovery of Lee's script notes...

129
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:28,951
...a search to find
the missing footage is launched.

130
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:33,848
It will last some six years,
but then the miraculous happens.

131
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:37,642
The original 35mm film footage is located.

132
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:41,871
After having been separated
for over a quarter of a century...

133
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:46,431
...Bruce Lee's original footage
and script notes are finally reunited.

134
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:50,051
Over the course of this film,
you'll see this footage as Bruce Lee...

135
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:53,491
...had intended for it to be shown,
and you'll also come to...

136
00:10:53,492 --> 00:10:56,211
...understand the struggle
he had to undergo in order...

137
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:58,611
...to bring it to the big screen.

138
00:10:58,612 --> 00:11:02,891
And perhaps along the way,
you'll come to know the real Bruce Lee...

139
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:06,662
...the man behind the legend,
a little better as well.

140
00:11:14,852 --> 00:11:17,791
Water is the softest substance
in the world...

141
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,171
...but yet it can penetrate
the hardest rock...

142
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:24,066
...or anything, granite, you name it.

143
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:28,031
Water, also, is insubstantial.

144
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:33,148
By that I mean you cannot grasp hold of it.
You cannot punch it and hurt it.

145
00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:36,051
So, every gung fu man is trying to do that...

146
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:40,764
...to be soft, like water, and flexible
and to adapt himself to the opponent.

147
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:45,151
It is February of 1965
in Los Angeles, California...

148
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:49,171
...where a 24-year-old Bruce Lee
is in the midst of auditioning for...

149
00:11:49,172 --> 00:11:51,771
...a TV series that will never be made.

150
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:56,071
In 19 months, he will be known
to American audiences as Kato...

151
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:57,451
...from The Green Hornet.

152
00:11:57,452 --> 00:12:01,331
In five years, he'll discover a truth
that will forever alter...

153
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:03,291
...the course of martial art history.

154
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:07,971
And in eight years, he'll be the most
famous motion picture actor in the world.

155
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:09,971
But that's all in the future.

156
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:11,891
Today, he's unknown.

157
00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:14,251
- You went to college in the US?
- Yes.

158
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:16,771
- And what did you study?
- Philosophy.

159
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:22,651
Bruce Lee's interest in philosophy, defined
by the Western ethos as love of wisdom...

160
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:26,971
...is a passion that will remain
with him for the remainder of his life.

161
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,831
Lee has been teaching Americans about...

162
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:33,651
...Chinese philosophy and culture for six
years, lecturing in the Pacific Northwest...

163
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,011
...on the subtleties of Chinese thought.

164
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:41,211
His great passion, however, is gung fu,
an ancient Chinese fighting art...

165
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:44,470
...unknown in the America of 1965.

166
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:49,131
Lee's scrapbook from this period of his life
reveals brief descriptions of many...

167
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:53,027
...of the arts and traditions
of the venerated masters of gung fu.

168
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:59,189
America's only knowledge of the martial
arts in 1965 are judo and jujitsu...

169
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:04,063
...two Japanese arts that were taught
to her servicemen during the Korean War.

170
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:08,451
Lee regards himself as an ambassador
for Chinese martial art...

171
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:12,171
...teaching all who'll listen about the ways
of the Chinese masters.

172
00:13:12,172 --> 00:13:18,911
You told me earlier today
that karate and jujitsu are not the most...

173
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:22,211
...powerful or the best forms
of Oriental fighting.

174
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:25,131
What is the most powerful
or the best form?

175
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:28,742
It's bad to say the best, but...

176
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:34,291
- ...in my opinion gung fu is pretty good.
- Would you tell us a little about gung fu?

177
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:37,026
Gung fu originates in China.

178
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:41,341
It is the ancestor of karate and jujitsu.

179
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:44,871
It is more of a complete system
and it's more fluid.

180
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:47,851
By that I mean, it's more flowing,
there is continuity in movement...

181
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:51,828
...instead of one movement,
two movements, and then stop.

182
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:56,225
I see. What's the difference between
a gung fu punch and a karate punch?

183
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:59,331
A karate punch is like an iron bar, "whack."

184
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:05,291
A gung fu punch is like an iron chain
with an iron ball attached to the end...

185
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:08,891
- ...and it goes "whang," and it hurts inside.
- Okay.

186
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:15,131
Lee has studied a system of gung fu
for the past nine years called wing chun...

187
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:19,651
...and is considered one of the art's
most talented and articulate exponents.

188
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:24,211
His teacher in this art has been
an elderly Hong Kong Chinese master...

189
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,309
...by the name of Yip Man.

190
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:29,971
Despite his proficiency
in this style of gung fu...

191
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:33,531
...his study of philosophy has
caused him to question.

192
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:36,971
And now, he begins to question
why most martial artists...

193
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:40,291
...Chinese and otherwise,
seem more concerned with...

194
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:44,371
...preserving tradition, than with looking
more deeply into the matter...

195
00:14:44,372 --> 00:14:48,301
...to penetrate through
to the ultimate truth of martial art.

196
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:53,291
Moreover, Lee has begun to develop
his own method of gung fu...

197
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:58,131
...which he describes as, "non-classical
in nature" and which takes as its core...

198
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:02,823
...the principles of economy of motion,
simplicity and directness.

199
00:15:04,092 --> 00:15:07,231
All right, for instance,
you will read it in bulk...

200
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:10,971
...in a magazine and everything,
that when somebody grabs you...

201
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:14,851
...you will first do this and then
this and then and then...

202
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:17,731
Thousands of steps before
you do a single thing.

203
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:21,051
Of course, these kinds
of magazines would teach you to...

204
00:15:21,052 --> 00:15:25,171
...be feared by your enemies
and admired by your friends.

205
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:29,091
But in gung fu,
it always involves a very fast motion.

206
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:31,611
Like, for instance,
a guy grabbing your hand...

207
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:36,491
...it's not the idea to do so many steps.
Step right on his instep, he'll let go.

208
00:15:36,492 --> 00:15:38,411
This is what we mean by simplicity.

209
00:15:38,412 --> 00:15:40,731
Same thing in striking and in everything.

210
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,491
It has to be based
on a very minimum motion...

211
00:15:44,492 --> 00:15:48,531
...so that everything would be directly
expressed. One motion...

212
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,771
...and he's gone. Doing it gracefully,
not yelling...

213
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:54,666
...and jumping all over him, but to go...

214
00:15:55,572 --> 00:15:57,351
Excuse me.

215
00:15:57,612 --> 00:16:02,508
Both the American and Chinese martial
art communities resent his iconoclasm.

216
00:16:02,732 --> 00:16:06,371
For such a young man to stand up
against thousands of years...

217
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:10,271
...of tradition and venerated authority,
is considered a direct threat...

218
00:16:10,272 --> 00:16:13,931
...to the status quo
and its entrenched power base.

219
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,511
Prior to Bruce's coming to this country...

220
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:22,571
...gung fu was alive in most,
all the Chinese communities...

221
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:25,891
...but there was nothing taught
to outsiders basically.

222
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:30,531
Bruce came along,
and with that basis of trying to...

223
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:34,171
...create equality amongst
all people regardless of race...

224
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:39,068
...he chose to let anybody into his school
regardless of what color or race they were.

225
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:43,171
As long as he knew that what was
in their heart was good and positive...

226
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:44,851
...he took them in.

227
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:48,531
When he was in San Francisco,
where the Chinese community...

228
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:52,042
...was much more like being in China...

229
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:56,711
...they took exception to it.
He had to fight his way out of it.

230
00:16:56,712 --> 00:16:58,491
In Oakland, he received a challenge...

231
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:02,443
...from the San Francisco Chinese
martial arts community.

232
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:05,029
And the challenge read that...

233
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:09,431
...Bruce, if he were to be defeated
in this challenge...

234
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:14,947
...would have to cease teaching
Caucasian or non-Chinese students.

235
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:19,311
And the Chinese martial artist
came over from San Francisco...

236
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:24,342
...to Bruce's studio in Oakland
and a very formal challenge took place.

237
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:26,031
I was present there.

238
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:28,451
In fact, I was eight months
pregnant with Brandon.

239
00:17:28,452 --> 00:17:30,491
James Lee was there.

240
00:17:30,492 --> 00:17:35,731
This fight with this Chinese martial
artist lasted about...

241
00:17:35,732 --> 00:17:37,251
...three minutes.

242
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:41,371
It consisted of a lot of running,
where the Chinese martial artist...

243
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:45,851
...took off and started running around
the room, and Bruce was pursuing him...

244
00:17:45,852 --> 00:17:48,371
...before Bruce finally got a hold of him...

245
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:52,745
...and took him down to the floor
and made him give up.

246
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:59,331
After the challenge ended
with the Chinese martial artist...

247
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:02,411
...being soundly defeated
and they all went away...

248
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:05,863
...Bruce won the right to teach
anyone he wanted to.

249
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:12,023
By February of 1967, Lee has three
schools operating in Seattle...

250
00:18:12,212 --> 00:18:17,142
...Oakland and Los Angeles that teach
his own interpretation of gung fu...

251
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:22,708
...based on his own investigations
into the ultimate truth of unarmed combat.

252
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:27,531
However, by now the young man is
openly critical of the traditions...

253
00:18:27,532 --> 00:18:30,571
...and limitations he sees as
inherent in the martial arts...

254
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:33,750
...as they're currently being
practiced in America.

255
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:37,384
He believes they lack a solid
grounding in reality...

256
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:41,631
...consisting of rehearsed self-defense
routines that are employed...

257
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:44,146
...and predictable in patternized rhythms.

258
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:48,131
He notes that real combat
is spontaneous, not rehearsed...

259
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:53,881
...and is made up of irregular or broken
rhythm a martial artist cannot anticipate...

260
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,950
...only respond to.

261
00:18:56,572 --> 00:19:01,388
Even the championship karate tournaments
of the era are non-contact affairs...

262
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:05,371
...settled not on knockouts but
on an accumulation of points...

263
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:08,531
...awarded for blows that never
touch an opponent.

264
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:11,571
A victory is determined by
a team of judges...

265
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:14,731
...who conclude which combatant
would probably have hurt...

266
00:19:14,732 --> 00:19:18,547
...the other combatant the most,
had contact been allowed.

267
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:22,091
Lee has no use for such styles
of pseudo-fighting...

268
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:27,024
...which he calls, "organized despair"
and "dry-land swimming."

269
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:32,142
Lee's criticism of the arts can be attributed
in part to his background in Hong Kong...

270
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:35,811
...which consisted not
of non-contact karate tournaments...

271
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:39,331
...but full-contact street fights
and challenge matches...

272
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:41,491
...fought on Hong Kong rooftops.

273
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:44,491
When not fighting against proponents
of different styles...

274
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:46,251
...of gung fu on rooftops...

275
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,491
...Lee had also fought frequently against...

276
00:19:48,492 --> 00:19:51,611
...opponents who had been armed
with knives and chains.

277
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:56,667
In such real-world encounters,
referees and judges were not necessary.

278
00:19:57,372 --> 00:20:00,851
Rather than participating in non-contact
karate tournaments...

279
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:04,651
...which he considers little more
than glorified games of tag...

280
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:07,251
...Lee instead devotes himself to devising...

281
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:10,385
...a more scientific approach
to unarmed combat.

282
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:14,661
His research leads him to the science
of Newtonian physics...

283
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:19,270
...and the techniques and principles
of European fencing and Western boxing...

284
00:20:19,772 --> 00:20:24,668
...where efficiency, not tradition,
are the touchstones of both disciplines.

285
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:29,291
Lee's research causes him to understand
that the only litmus test...

286
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:31,491
...of a combative technique's worth...

287
00:20:31,492 --> 00:20:35,387
...is whether or not it can be landed
effectively on an opponent.

288
00:20:35,892 --> 00:20:39,131
Anything that's ornamental
is discarded from his style.

289
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:41,291
He retains only those techniques...

290
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:46,382
...that he himself has determined to be
practical in real self-defense situations.

291
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:51,611
Lee is the first martial artist
in North America, if not the world...

292
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:54,011
...to have his students don boxing gloves...

293
00:20:54,012 --> 00:20:57,463
...headgear and body protectors
and spar all out.

294
00:20:57,892 --> 00:21:00,771
Nothing is rehearsed,
no punches are pulled...

295
00:21:00,772 --> 00:21:05,588
...and full-contact, reality-based
martial art is the order of the day.

296
00:21:07,652 --> 00:21:12,211
In 1967, Lee introduces the concept
of full-contact sparring...

297
00:21:12,212 --> 00:21:16,187
...at the International Karate Tournament
in Long Beach, California.

298
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:20,131
Defense is not emphasized
in his new reality-based method...

299
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:24,691
...as this would be allowing one's opponent
to set the tone and tempo in a real fight.

300
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:29,065
Instead, the focus of Lee's new approach
to combat is on attack...

301
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:32,931
...or more precisely,
on intercepting the opponent's attack...

302
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:35,826
...with an attack of one's own.

303
00:21:37,972 --> 00:21:39,931
By midsummer of 1967...

304
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:44,451
...Lee has determined the defining attribute
of his new approach to martial art:

305
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:47,141
The principle of interception.

306
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:51,011
As the Cantonese term for
unarmed combat is typically represented...

307
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:53,587
...by a character indicating a fist...

308
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,870
...Lee christens his new approach,
jeet kune do...

309
00:21:57,012 --> 00:21:59,667
...the way of the intercepting fist.

310
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:04,389
Now what is this thing you do?

311
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:08,745
In Cantonese, jeet kune do,
the way of the intercepting fist.

312
00:22:08,772 --> 00:22:11,870
- Intercepting fist?
- Or foot.

313
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:14,746
Come on, touch me, anywhere you can.

314
00:22:14,972 --> 00:22:17,451
To reach me, you must move to me.

315
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:21,062
Your attack offers me an opportunity
to intercept you.

316
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:24,651
In this case, I'm using my longest weapon,
my sidekick...

317
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:27,989
...against the nearest target, your kneecap.

318
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:30,931
This can be compared
to your left jab in boxing...

319
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,771
...except it's much more damaging.

320
00:22:32,772 --> 00:22:35,711
I see. Well, speaking of a left jab...

321
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:39,731
This time I intercept
your emotional tenseness.

322
00:22:39,732 --> 00:22:43,786
You see, from your thought to your fist,
how much time was lost.

323
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:46,931
Before long,
word is out concerning Lee's art...

324
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:50,891
...and he begins to attract the attention
of America's top martial artists...

325
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:55,731
...as well as many prestigious
Southern California actors and athletes...

326
00:22:55,732 --> 00:23:00,389
...Steve McQueen, James Coburn
and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar among them.

327
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:05,988
Bruce was an iconoclast and a rebel...

328
00:23:06,172 --> 00:23:10,371
...in that he thought
the traditional martial arts...

329
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:13,140
...were way too bound by tradition.

330
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:20,391
People who were not really
that effective at martial arts...

331
00:23:20,652 --> 00:23:26,026
...really were not promoting martial arts
but their own nationalistic brand of...

332
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:29,571
...martial arts
and their view of the world...

333
00:23:29,572 --> 00:23:33,626
...more so than a realistic
martial art fighting system.

334
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:36,627
He wanted to get to the
pure essence of the art.

335
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:40,531
Lee's Los Angeles school,
located in the heart of Chinatown...

336
00:23:40,532 --> 00:23:45,131
...and without any advertising, pulls in
not newcomers to the martial arts...

337
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,291
...but seasoned black belts...

338
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:51,346
...all of whom now look upon
Lee's art as revolutionary.

339
00:23:51,892 --> 00:23:54,811
And upon his talent as otherworldly.

340
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:59,151
In the Sportsweek of the Washington Star...

341
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:05,225
...printed in Washington, D.C. On August 16, 1970:

342
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:12,746
"Three of Bruce Lee's pupils, Joe Louis,
Chuck Norris, and Mike Stone...

343
00:24:13,092 --> 00:24:18,341
"...have between them won every major
karate tournament in the United States.

344
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:24,870
"Joe Louis was grand national
champion three successive years.

345
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:29,811
"Bruce Lee handles and instructs these guys...

346
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:33,821
"...almost as a parent would a young child.

347
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:38,651
"Which can be somewhat
disconcerting to watch.

348
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:42,911
"It's like walking into a saloon in the old West...

349
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,971
"...and seeing the fastest guy in the territory...

350
00:24:46,972 --> 00:24:50,708
"...standing there with notches all over his gun.

351
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:55,186
"Then in walks a pleasant little fellow who says:

352
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:58,545
"'How many times do I have to tell you...

353
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:01,411
"'... you are doing it all wrong? '

354
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:05,705
"And the other guy listens intently."

355
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:09,971
With the top actors and
martial artists in America...

356
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:12,731
...now coming to his home
for private instruction...

357
00:25:12,732 --> 00:25:15,531
...Lee is the toast of the martial arts world.

358
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:18,107
However, by the end of 1969...

359
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:21,771
...Lee is growing concerned
that his students are looking to his art...

360
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:26,811
...as containing a secret way, special
techniques that alone are responsible...

361
00:25:26,812 --> 00:25:29,501
...for success and ability in combat.

362
00:25:30,132 --> 00:25:33,171
To Lee, there is no such thing
as a magic system.

363
00:25:33,172 --> 00:25:38,091
The only secret to martial art success
being a willingness to train hard enough...

364
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:41,225
...to cultivate one's own innate abilities.

365
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:43,411
Taking matters into his own hands...

366
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:47,251
...Lee now does something that is
unheard of in martial arts circles.

367
00:25:47,252 --> 00:25:49,131
In January of 1970...

368
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:53,691
...at the very height of his popularity
and reputation in the martial art world...

369
00:25:53,692 --> 00:25:58,131
...he closes all three
of his jun fan kung fu schools.

370
00:25:58,132 --> 00:26:02,425
When Bruce closed the schools,
he felt he was unburdening himself of...

371
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:06,131
...having to prove through his students...

372
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:10,141
...that his system had merit.

373
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,731
He didn't want to get into that.

374
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:17,628
He wanted them to evolve and teach,
but it was not a thing where...

375
00:26:17,732 --> 00:26:20,211
..."you have to teach what I taught.

376
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:22,931
"You have to teach what you learned"...

377
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:26,091
...and that's going to be more
than what he taught, hopefully...

378
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:29,571
...for those students that
understood what he was doing.

379
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:31,651
Lee's going to teach me all this.

380
00:26:31,652 --> 00:26:33,171
I cannot teach you.

381
00:26:33,172 --> 00:26:35,811
Only help you to explore yourself, nothing more.

382
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:39,331
Lee now trains only a handful
of students privately.

383
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:42,931
As his art is about personal growth,
he feels he must come to know...

384
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:46,571
...each student thoroughly in order
to assist the student in developing...

385
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:51,611
...the skills and confidence required
to free him from the chains of limitation...

386
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:54,790
...whether of physical
or psychological origin.

387
00:26:55,012 --> 00:26:56,891
What is your instinct?

388
00:26:56,892 --> 00:26:58,251
To pray.

389
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:00,907
In this position, your arms are useless.

390
00:27:00,932 --> 00:27:02,051
Yeah.

391
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:04,343
Can you kick or stomp me?

392
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:07,467
No.

393
00:27:07,612 --> 00:27:11,427
Then if you wish to survive,
what do you do?

394
00:27:12,052 --> 00:27:13,990
I don't know.

395
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:16,664
Bite.

396
00:27:17,092 --> 00:27:18,251
Bite?

397
00:27:18,252 --> 00:27:20,224
Are we not animals?

398
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:26,191
You all right?

399
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:29,944
I can't find much evidence
to the contrary, Lee.

400
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:31,785
Bite?

401
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:36,189
Biting is efficient in close quarters...

402
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,386
...but don't make a plan of biting.

403
00:27:39,772 --> 00:27:42,905
That is a very good way to lose your teeth.

404
00:27:43,532 --> 00:27:45,731
There's so much to remember.

405
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:49,069
If you try to remember, you will lose.

406
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:51,371
Empty your mind.

407
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:52,811
Be formless...

408
00:27:52,812 --> 00:27:55,148
...shapeless, like water.

409
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:57,411
Now, you put water into a cup...

410
00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:59,430
...it becomes the cup.

411
00:27:59,772 --> 00:28:03,030
Put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot.

412
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:08,507
Now, water can flow or creep or drip or crash.

413
00:28:09,652 --> 00:28:11,451
Be water, my friend.

414
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:14,771
Yeah. Why don't I stand in front
of Paul and recite that to him.

415
00:28:14,772 --> 00:28:16,811
Maybe he'll faint. Or drown.

416
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:18,465
When is it?

417
00:28:19,332 --> 00:28:20,906
Tomorrow.

418
00:28:22,412 --> 00:28:24,065
You are not ready.

419
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,901
I know.

420
00:28:26,132 --> 00:28:30,505
Like everyone else,
you want to learn the way to win...

421
00:28:31,652 --> 00:28:34,182
...but never do accept the way to lose.

422
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:37,390
To accept defeat.

423
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:40,545
To learn to die is to be liberated from it.

424
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:45,304
So when tomorrow comes,
you must free your ambitious mind...

425
00:28:46,612 --> 00:28:49,142
...and learn the art of dying.

426
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:53,211
I remember he said, for me...

427
00:28:53,212 --> 00:28:57,551
...if I were going to use, let's say, judo style.

428
00:28:57,692 --> 00:29:00,411
Imagine me trying to get
my hips underneath him...

429
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:02,411
...to throw him, for a hip throw.

430
00:29:02,412 --> 00:29:06,261
"You're going to try and do that
while I beat you down?

431
00:29:06,772 --> 00:29:08,771
"You'll be trying to do something else."

432
00:29:08,772 --> 00:29:10,851
You know, he was absolutely right.

433
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:14,691
Lee is his own best example
of the potency of his beliefs.

434
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:18,651
He's detected his own weaknesses
and limitations and by the application...

435
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:23,104
...of intellect and dint of hard work,
he alone has overcome them...

436
00:29:23,572 --> 00:29:28,388
...raising his physical ability to a level
that borders on the phenomenal.

437
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:32,171
He routinely performs
one-finger pushups on one hand...

438
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:36,226
...executes elevated V-sits
for extended periods of time.

439
00:29:36,452 --> 00:29:38,211
He can cannonade an opponent...

440
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:42,585
...several feet back from a punch
he delivers from only one inch away.

441
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:47,171
And his sidekicks have so much power
that, in the words of one recipient:

442
00:29:47,172 --> 00:29:49,702
"They feel like being hit by a car."

443
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:52,891
He trains hard, six days a week...

444
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:57,131
...pushing to discover the outer limits
of expression for the human body.

445
00:29:57,132 --> 00:30:00,091
He finds out with disastrous consequences...

446
00:30:00,092 --> 00:30:03,304
...on August 13, 1970.

447
00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:07,851
As a result of an improper warm-up
while lifting weights...

448
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:12,065
...Lee severely strains
the fourth sacral nerve in his lower back.

449
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:16,624
It's an injury that will continue
to plague him for the remainder of his life.

450
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:21,264
The injury leaves Lee virtually bedridden
for a period of six months.

451
00:30:21,732 --> 00:30:25,547
His doctors tell him
he may never be able to kick again.

452
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:29,371
For Bruce to be lying down
in bed 24 hours a day...

453
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:31,867
...for approximately six months...

454
00:30:32,412 --> 00:30:34,942
...was an impossible thought.

455
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:38,301
You cannot contain him like that.

456
00:30:38,302 --> 00:30:43,357
But he did, because he knew if there
were any future, even to walk normally...

457
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:46,061
...he would need to give this time to heal.

458
00:30:46,062 --> 00:30:51,061
So he spent a great deal of time resting,
flat on his back, for quite a long time...

459
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:53,941
...and then also, you know,
just sitting in a chair.

460
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:56,981
But he was not one to just waste time.

461
00:30:56,982 --> 00:31:00,240
So he spent this amount of time...

462
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:04,821
...doing a lot of researching
of all of his vast library of books...

463
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:09,991
...which were books on the martial arts,
all combative arts, all hand-to-hand arts...

464
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:14,341
...whether they be Western,
Eastern, modern, or ancient...

465
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:19,301
...all types of philosophy, psychology,
especially in the motivational field...

466
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:24,471
...now that he was injured
and his future was in jeopardy.

467
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:28,512
He felt that he needed
to self-motivate himself all the time.

468
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:33,061
Unable to put his energy to use physically,
Lee now channels it mentally.

469
00:31:33,062 --> 00:31:37,958
The writings of the Buddha,
Alan Watts, Carl Rogers, Lao-tse...

470
00:31:38,302 --> 00:31:42,601
...Frederick Perls, Daisetz Suzuki,
and Jiddu Krishnamurti...

471
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:44,672
...become his constant companions.

472
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:49,821
Of these authors, Lee is particularly
taken by the thoughts of Krishnamurti...

473
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:54,221
...who states that, "truth cannot
be organized without invalidating it."

474
00:31:54,222 --> 00:31:57,673
You have to be a light to yourself...

475
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:03,181
...not the light of a professor, or an analyst...

476
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:09,079
...or a psychologist, or the light of Jesus,
or the light of the good heart.

477
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:11,757
You have to be a light to yourself...

478
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:16,581
...in a world that is utterly becoming dark.

479
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:22,002
I believe that part of the concept
that he enjoyed so much about...

480
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:25,678
...Krishnamurti's philosophy
was one of self-reliance.

481
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:30,781
If you're looking for truth, you must
look inward, rather than outward.

482
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,101
Lee begins to write about his
new insight and its application...

483
00:32:34,102 --> 00:32:35,541
...to martial art.

484
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:38,701
His writings will fill seven large volumes.

485
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:41,436
Slowly, Lee begins to battle back.

486
00:32:42,222 --> 00:32:47,101
Although the back injury will prove to be
a permanent problem, within six months...

487
00:32:47,102 --> 00:32:51,421
...he has proven both the naysayers
and the medical community wrong.

488
00:32:51,422 --> 00:32:55,821
Not only is he able to kick again,
he becomes a better martial artist...

489
00:32:55,822 --> 00:32:58,158
...than he ever was before.

490
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:01,781
Lee's harrowing experience,
coupled with his new insight...

491
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:05,421
...served to underscore for him
the validity of his belief that there...

492
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:10,381
...is no help but self-help,
including help in the form of instruction...

493
00:33:10,382 --> 00:33:12,957
...in the art of unarmed combat.

494
00:33:13,342 --> 00:33:18,061
Even his own beloved creation,
jeet kune do, by far the most scientific...

495
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:22,461
...of all martial arts, is not exempt
from his solvent analysis.

496
00:33:22,462 --> 00:33:25,981
Lee sees his error in the fact that
he had been striving to create...

497
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:30,480
...the ultimate way or style of martial art
to teach to his students.

498
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:35,021
First he thought he had it
with the Chinese way of martial art.

499
00:33:35,022 --> 00:33:39,713
Then, more recently, in his newly-created
way of the intercepting fist.

500
00:33:39,782 --> 00:33:43,941
But Lee has now come to see that the
ultimate truth does not reside in ways...

501
00:33:43,942 --> 00:33:48,061
...or styles, but within the soul
of each individual.

502
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:50,981
I do not believe in styles anymore.

503
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:56,541
I mean, I do not believe that there is
such a thing as a Chinese...

504
00:33:56,542 --> 00:34:02,101
...way of fighting or Japanese way
of fighting or whatever way of fighting...

505
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:07,476
...because, unless human beings
have three arms and four legs...

506
00:34:07,502 --> 00:34:09,941
...we will have a different form of fighting.

507
00:34:09,942 --> 00:34:12,781
But basically, we only have
two hands and two feet.

508
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:17,021
So styles tend to not only...

509
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:20,921
...separate men because they have
their own doctrines, and then their...

510
00:34:20,922 --> 00:34:25,234
...doctrines became the gospel truth,
that you cannot change, you know...

511
00:34:26,262 --> 00:34:28,101
But, if you do not have styles...

512
00:34:28,102 --> 00:34:34,159
...if you just say, "here I am, as a human
being, how can I express myself...

513
00:34:35,102 --> 00:34:36,581
"...totally and completely?"

514
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:41,741
Then it's just two people who are
being aware of their own movements...

515
00:34:41,742 --> 00:34:44,501
...who are observing
the other person's movements...

516
00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:49,021
...and being able to fit in with that
person's movements, so that there's no...

517
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:51,901
...set pattern of movements.

518
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:55,181
No "well, when he does this,
then I do this."

519
00:34:55,182 --> 00:35:00,795
It's just a total freedom to react
to what the other person does.

520
00:35:00,982 --> 00:35:06,161
In fact, Bruce inscribes it perfectly
on the back of this medallion...

521
00:35:06,162 --> 00:35:12,461
...where he wrote his motto,
it says, "Using no way as way...

522
00:35:12,462 --> 00:35:15,640
"...having no limitation as limitation."

523
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:19,995
Over the years this phrase has been
somewhat misinterpreted.

524
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:24,236
People think of using
"no way as way" to mean...

525
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:27,196
..."anything I do is okay...

526
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:30,600
"...and anything I do is my way."

527
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,901
I don't think Bruce really intended it
to mean that way.

528
00:35:33,902 --> 00:35:38,261
He just meant not to be boxed in...

529
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:41,501
...by a certain way, so that you...

530
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:46,592
...never get into a situation
where there's only one response.

531
00:35:46,742 --> 00:35:49,875
You adapt to what the situation calls for.

532
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:52,791
I think Bruce had that down pretty well.

533
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:57,121
When there is a way,
then there lies the limitation.

534
00:35:57,542 --> 00:35:59,560
To me, okay, to me...

535
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:05,421
...ultimately, martial art means
honestly expressing yourself.

536
00:36:05,422 --> 00:36:07,678
Now it is very difficult to do.

537
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:13,501
I mean, it is easy for me to put
on a show and be cocky and be flooded...

538
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:17,141
...with a cocky feeling
and then feel like pretty cool and all that.

539
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:21,301
Or I can make all kinds of phony things,
you see what I mean...

540
00:36:21,302 --> 00:36:25,754
...blinded by it, or I can show you
some really fancy movement.

541
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:30,834
But to express one's self honestly,
not lying to one's self.

542
00:36:31,582 --> 00:36:37,981
And to express myself honestly,
now that, my friend, is very hard to do.

543
00:36:37,982 --> 00:36:39,581
That's the whole key right there:

544
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:42,181
Do you know yourself?
Do you know your skills?

545
00:36:42,182 --> 00:36:47,941
Do you know your weaknesses?
Are you able to adjust your life...

546
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:51,061
...to compensate for whatever's
happening and take advantage...

547
00:36:51,062 --> 00:36:55,037
...of whatever's happening
in terms of plusses and minuses?

548
00:36:56,182 --> 00:36:58,313
That was his approach.

549
00:36:58,422 --> 00:37:02,781
And he was an incredible example of that...

550
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:05,461
...a walking model of that.

551
00:37:05,462 --> 00:37:09,541
In his critically acclaimed performance
on the television series, Longstreet...

552
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:13,461
...Lee attempts to teach his student,
played by James Franciscus...

553
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:16,301
...this higher purpose of his martial art.

554
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:19,719
Lee, I want you to teach me
what you did the other night.

555
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:23,276
I already told Miss Sparrow I can't.

556
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:27,792
I'm willing to empty my cup
in order to taste your tea.

557
00:37:29,462 --> 00:37:33,516
Your open-mindedness is cool,
but it doesn't change anything.

558
00:37:33,862 --> 00:37:37,837
I don't believe in system,
Mr. Longstreet, nor in method.

559
00:37:37,862 --> 00:37:41,518
Without system, without method,
what's to teach?

560
00:37:41,902 --> 00:37:43,301
You had to learn.

561
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,701
You weren't born knowing how to take
apart three men in a matter of seconds.

562
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:50,075
True, but I found the cause of my ignorance.

563
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,261
Now help me find mine.

564
00:37:52,262 --> 00:37:55,901
Having discovered the truth
of, "using no way as way...

565
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:58,591
"...having no limitation as limitation"...

566
00:37:58,702 --> 00:38:03,712
...Bruce Lee's mission now becomes
to communicate this truth to the world.

567
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:08,861
The most effective approach, he decides,
is not in private one-on-one instruction...

568
00:38:08,862 --> 00:38:11,501
...but in bringing this truth to the big screen.

569
00:38:11,502 --> 00:38:15,781
His quest: To create a new genre
of film that will reveal the higher...

570
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:17,381
...purpose of martial art.

571
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:21,277
His challenge: To overcome
the prejudices of Hollywood.

572
00:38:25,982 --> 00:38:30,381
Bruce, at that point in his life,
had decided that he was going to make...

573
00:38:30,382 --> 00:38:36,359
...the film business his career rather
than teaching martial arts on a mass basis.

574
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:41,916
So he tried to pursue the idea
of getting roles in film and TV.

575
00:38:44,902 --> 00:38:46,191
Okay.

576
00:39:12,982 --> 00:39:16,781
He had a great deal of trouble
securing really leading roles.

577
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:19,341
He had a number of roles in small pictures.

578
00:39:19,342 --> 00:39:23,341
But as far as really promoting
his career as a leading man...

579
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:25,981
...he had a lot of difficulty
in America at that time.

580
00:39:25,982 --> 00:39:30,201
In the United States,
I think something about the Oriental...

581
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:34,634
...I mean the true Oriental should be shown.

582
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:38,181
- Hollywood sure as heck hasn't.
- You better believe it, man.

583
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:41,101
I mean, its always the pigtail
and bouncing around...

584
00:39:41,102 --> 00:39:43,421
...you know, with the eye slanted and all that.

585
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:47,501
A screenplay written by Lee,
entitled The Silent Flute, which detailed...

586
00:39:47,502 --> 00:39:50,821
...the personal quest of self-discovery
of a young martial artist...

587
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,541
...is torpedoed by Hollywood.

588
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:54,861
He was in a kind of a poverty status then.

589
00:39:54,862 --> 00:39:57,861
He was having a tough time,
and in a letter...

590
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:01,021
...told me he was working
on a vehicle, and something like...

591
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:05,021
...The Silent Flute or equivalent to that,
and the letter I got the next month...

592
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:09,461
...he would tell me that that fell through,
because in one instance...

593
00:40:09,462 --> 00:40:13,981
...he told me that they just felt that
a young Asian couldn't carry...

594
00:40:13,982 --> 00:40:15,981
...the lead in something like that.

595
00:40:15,982 --> 00:40:18,541
Undeterred, the young man forges on.

596
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:21,061
He conceives an idea
for a television series...

597
00:40:21,062 --> 00:40:23,781
...that will feature martial art philosophy.

598
00:40:23,782 --> 00:40:28,341
Originally to be called The Warrior,
but later renamed Kung Fu.

599
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:32,421
Even when he conceived the idea
of the Kung Fu series...

600
00:40:32,422 --> 00:40:35,541
...had many,
many planning discussions with...

601
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:38,581
...the eventual producers
of the Kung Fu series.

602
00:40:38,582 --> 00:40:42,621
When it got right down to it,
they did not hire Bruce...

603
00:40:42,622 --> 00:40:46,501
...to play the part of the
leading part in Kung Fu...

604
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:51,781
...instead, going for a Caucasian man.
And the word was that Bruce...

605
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,821
...because he was Chinese,
was not considered a bankable commodity.

606
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:58,581
Let me ask you, however,
about the problems...

607
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:03,941
...that you face as a Chinese hero
in an American series.

608
00:41:03,942 --> 00:41:06,641
Have people come up
in the industry and said:

609
00:41:06,642 --> 00:41:09,821
"Well, we don't know how the audiences
are going to take a non-American"?

610
00:41:12,142 --> 00:41:17,741
Well, such a question has been raised.
In fact, it is being discussed.

611
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:21,512
And that is why The Warrior is
probably not going to be on.

612
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:26,541
- I see.
- You see, because unfortunately such...

613
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:31,461
...things do exist in this world,
you see, like I don't know...

614
00:41:31,462 --> 00:41:35,437
...certain parts of the country where...

615
00:41:35,622 --> 00:41:39,756
...they think that, business-wise, it's a risk.
I don't blame them.

616
00:41:40,302 --> 00:41:42,701
In the same way, it's like in Hong Kong...

617
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:45,701
...if a foreigner came and became a star.

618
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:51,122
If I were the man with the money...

619
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:53,581
...I probably would have my own worry...

620
00:41:53,582 --> 00:41:55,981
...of whether or not the
acceptance would be there.

621
00:41:55,982 --> 00:41:59,513
But that's all right, because...

622
00:41:59,822 --> 00:42:03,717
...if you honestly express yourself,
it doesn't matter.

623
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:08,101
Lee now realizes that Hollywood
only wants Asians to play grossly...

624
00:42:08,102 --> 00:42:09,981
...inaccurate stereotypes.

625
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:14,661
Despite his dire economic circumstances,
he refuses to accept roles...

626
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:18,661
...that would portray the Chinese race
as anything less than equal...

627
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:23,181
...to other cultures. With a wife
and now two small children to support...

628
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:27,555
...Lee's dignity and philosophical
principles come at a huge price.

629
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:31,461
With money rapidly running out,
he now realizes that he is...

630
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:33,673
...wasting his time with Hollywood.

631
00:42:57,982 --> 00:43:01,901
With that rejection in mind,
I guess you could say that was an overt...

632
00:43:01,902 --> 00:43:05,990
...expression of racism in the
film industry in the early '70s.

633
00:43:06,222 --> 00:43:08,821
And at that time, we went to Hong Kong.

634
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:13,541
Bruce decided that if he couldn't make it
in the American film industry through...

635
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:17,421
...the front door, he would go to Hong Kong
and come back in the side door.

636
00:43:17,422 --> 00:43:19,758
Which is precisely what he was doing.

637
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:24,195
At the time, Chinese action films
were largely sword-play films...

638
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:30,341
...or as Bruce Lee so aptly described
them, "simply one long, armed hassle."

639
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:35,557
He would say he didn't invent
the gore in Mandarin films...

640
00:43:35,702 --> 00:43:41,421
...but that the violence in his films
were always with just cause.

641
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:47,080
I hope that the picture I am in would...

642
00:43:47,822 --> 00:43:52,421
...either explain why
the violence was done...

643
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:57,301
...whether right or wrong, or what not,
but unfortunately, pictures...

644
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,301
...most of them, are done mainly...

645
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:01,821
...for the sake of violence,
you know what I mean?

646
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:05,101
Like fighting for 30 minutes,
or getting stabbed 50 times.

647
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:08,181
I'm fascinated...
Let me give you your microphone back.

648
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:12,221
- I'm fascinated that you came back.
- I am a martial artist.

649
00:44:12,222 --> 00:44:15,741
He's offered very little money
to star in his first film.

650
00:44:15,742 --> 00:44:18,661
But then, money has never
been his sole objective.

651
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:23,421
The film is entitled, The Big Boss,
and it will become the highest-grossing...

652
00:44:23,422 --> 00:44:26,101
...film in Southeast Asian history.

653
00:44:26,102 --> 00:44:29,701
Lee follows up the unprecedented
success of his first film with...

654
00:44:29,702 --> 00:44:31,799
...a second, Fist of Fury.

655
00:44:32,142 --> 00:44:35,701
It proceeds to smash the
record set by The Big Boss.

656
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:40,821
Bruce didn't want to be segmented,
in that he could only do Chinese movies...

657
00:44:40,822 --> 00:44:46,381
...or only do Chinese martial arts.
He didn't view himself as only...

658
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:52,181
...a Chinese man. He viewed himself as
a citizen of the world who had a mission...

659
00:44:52,182 --> 00:44:56,953
...that really had nothing to do
with what his nationality was.

660
00:44:56,982 --> 00:44:58,381
He wanted to bring...

661
00:44:58,382 --> 00:45:05,061
...his views of martial arts and of life and
of the culture that he had experienced...

662
00:45:05,062 --> 00:45:10,421
...in his short lifetime to the
audiences all over the world.

663
00:45:10,422 --> 00:45:14,510
Lee does just this with his next film,
The Way of the Dragon...

664
00:45:14,582 --> 00:45:16,440
...which he also directs.

665
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:20,221
In the film's climactic battle,
Lee takes on one-time student...

666
00:45:20,222 --> 00:45:23,798
...Chuck Norris, in a fight
set in the Roman Coliseum.

667
00:45:23,982 --> 00:45:28,798
Lee's character, using classical
gung fu techniques, is losing the fight...

668
00:45:29,142 --> 00:45:34,470
...until he begins to employ the formless
and adaptive approach of jeet kune do.

669
00:45:47,262 --> 00:45:50,661
The Way of the Dragon also affords Lee
the opportunity to include...

670
00:45:50,662 --> 00:45:53,954
...deeper elements of his personal
philosophy of life.

671
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:58,272
After reluctantly taking the life
of his adversary in the film...

672
00:45:58,302 --> 00:46:02,221
...Lee's character pauses
to make a symbolic gesture of respect...

673
00:46:02,222 --> 00:46:04,240
...to a fellow human being.

674
00:46:04,582 --> 00:46:09,061
It was yet another example of Bruce Lee
communicating to his audience a piece...

675
00:46:09,062 --> 00:46:13,640
...of his own personal philosophy regarding
the brotherhood of all races.

676
00:46:13,862 --> 00:46:17,981
After the first two movies,
then Bruce progressed into making...

677
00:46:17,982 --> 00:46:20,741
...The Way of the Dragon,
which was his own creation.

678
00:46:20,742 --> 00:46:22,501
Then The Game of Death, of course...

679
00:46:22,502 --> 00:46:26,821
...and then Enter the Dragon came along.
And I think as you can see...

680
00:46:26,822 --> 00:46:31,673
...there's a progression in those films
where the fighting has even more...

681
00:46:31,742 --> 00:46:36,381
...justification and that there's more
material built around the fighting...

682
00:46:36,382 --> 00:46:39,674
...to explain, first of all, the reason for it...

683
00:46:39,722 --> 00:46:45,601
...and to also find expression for the
philosophy underlying the martial arts.

684
00:46:51,022 --> 00:46:52,641
Do I bother you?

685
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,593
Don't waste yourself.

686
00:46:56,902 --> 00:46:58,635
What's your style?

687
00:46:58,702 --> 00:47:00,037
My style?

688
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:04,201
You can call it the art of
fighting without fighting.

689
00:47:04,702 --> 00:47:07,436
The art of fighting without fighting?

690
00:47:07,982 --> 00:47:09,501
Show me some of it.

691
00:47:09,502 --> 00:47:10,791
Later.

692
00:47:17,382 --> 00:47:18,671
All right.

693
00:47:21,182 --> 00:47:23,552
Don't you think we need more room?

694
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:26,955
Where else?

695
00:47:27,662 --> 00:47:30,078
That island, on a beach.

696
00:47:30,422 --> 00:47:32,553
We can take this boat.

697
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:41,471
Okay.

698
00:47:55,942 --> 00:47:57,621
What the hell are you doing?

699
00:47:57,622 --> 00:47:59,116
Hey, are you crazy?

700
00:48:03,062 --> 00:48:04,941
After filming Enter the Dragon...

701
00:48:04,942 --> 00:48:09,901
...Lee is now ready to complete the film
that will embody his greatest message...

702
00:48:09,902 --> 00:48:13,274
...a film Lee calls The Game of Death.

703
00:48:20,423 --> 00:48:24,262
I believe that this background of research...

704
00:48:24,263 --> 00:48:28,582
...and the building of a philosophy
of jeet kune do is what Bruce...

705
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:31,902
...intended to relate
through The Game of Death.

706
00:48:31,903 --> 00:48:38,039
He had an idea of how he wanted
to show the martial arts...

707
00:48:38,263 --> 00:48:44,302
...to the viewing public, these various steps
in finding your own way...

708
00:48:44,303 --> 00:48:49,822
...in martial arts, the different styles
and what styles mean...

709
00:48:49,823 --> 00:48:52,102
...and more importantly,
what they don't mean.

710
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:54,302
That was Bruce's big message.

711
00:48:54,303 --> 00:48:58,862
The style of no style, and The Game
of Death was going to be the platform...

712
00:48:58,863 --> 00:49:00,342
...for these expressions.

713
00:49:00,343 --> 00:49:04,142
While we may never know how the film
would've turned out, had Bruce Lee lived...

714
00:49:04,143 --> 00:49:08,182
...we do know with unimpeachable
certainty, the vision that he had...

715
00:49:08,183 --> 00:49:11,662
...for the movie
during the time he was filming its finale.

716
00:49:11,663 --> 00:49:16,142
According to Lee's 12-page storyline,
he would play a retired undefeated...

717
00:49:16,143 --> 00:49:20,302
...martial arts champion by the name
of Hie Tien, who had been approached...

718
00:49:20,303 --> 00:49:24,022
...by members of the Korean underworld
to take part in a daring raid...

719
00:49:24,023 --> 00:49:27,942
...on a five-story pagoda,
said to contain a valuable treasure...

720
00:49:27,943 --> 00:49:30,279
...on its uppermost level.

721
00:49:30,303 --> 00:49:33,822
When he refuses to participate,
his sister and younger brother...

722
00:49:33,823 --> 00:49:37,877
...are kidnapped, leaving him no option
but to take part in the raid.

723
00:49:37,943 --> 00:49:41,342
At a briefing at the boss's home,
Hie Tien is introduced...

724
00:49:41,343 --> 00:49:46,080
...to his accomplices in the raid, all of
them highly-trained martial artists.

725
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:50,602
The boss screens a reconnaissance
film of the temple area explaining to...

726
00:49:50,603 --> 00:49:53,822
...the accomplices that since
guns are prohibited in the village...

727
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:57,062
...the pagoda is guarded
by martial arts mercenaries.

728
00:49:57,063 --> 00:49:59,672
One on each level of the pagoda.

729
00:50:00,183 --> 00:50:03,722
Their instructions are to fight their way
to the top of the pagoda...

730
00:50:03,723 --> 00:50:08,382
...and retrieve the treasure. Lee selected
the Buddhist temple of Pope Jusaw...

731
00:50:08,383 --> 00:50:10,472
...as the setting for the film.

732
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:15,462
The temple's most striking object,
the 33-meter-high Buddha statue...

733
00:50:15,463 --> 00:50:19,073
...is clearly indicated
in Lee's storyline sketches.

734
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:25,142
Cast in one mold with 150 tons of bronze,
it's said to be the largest...

735
00:50:25,143 --> 00:50:27,952
...such standing figure in all of Asia.

736
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:32,082
In front of the Buddha is the five-story...

737
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:35,522
...wooden pagoda that Bruce Lee
had chosen as the backdrop...

738
00:50:35,523 --> 00:50:37,993
...for the climactic battles in the film.

739
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:40,422
Thus, the idea started from there.

740
00:50:40,423 --> 00:50:42,922
He took some of the ideas
he had been gathering...

741
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:47,921
...about the levels of martial
arts combat in the pagoda...

742
00:50:48,143 --> 00:50:52,982
...and Kareem came out and I believe that
the first scenes that they shot...

743
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,622
...were the fight scenes
between Bruce and Kareem.

744
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:59,742
The first day's rushes after we saw those,
we had to slow everything down because...

745
00:50:59,743 --> 00:51:03,262
...we were moving too fast.
It looked too jerky on film, and we had to...

746
00:51:03,263 --> 00:51:06,942
...slow it down so the film could follow,
so the camera could follow us...

747
00:51:06,943 --> 00:51:09,022
...and people could see things.

748
00:51:09,023 --> 00:51:12,262
We were doing things like we practiced it.

749
00:51:12,263 --> 00:51:17,159
And in practice with Bruce,
we'd do several things in a split second.

750
00:51:19,383 --> 00:51:23,442
The audience would miss the subtleties
of what he was trying to do...

751
00:51:23,443 --> 00:51:24,717
...if we didn't slow it down.

752
00:51:24,823 --> 00:51:27,262
Of what were to be
his accomplices in the film...

753
00:51:27,263 --> 00:51:32,462
...Lee wanted one to be slightly devious
and antagonistic toward his character.

754
00:51:32,463 --> 00:51:36,862
This would create an interesting dynamic
in the relationship between the two men...

755
00:51:36,863 --> 00:51:40,622
...not letting the audience know whether
or not Lee's partner was actually...

756
00:51:40,623 --> 00:51:42,662
...with him or against him.

757
00:51:42,663 --> 00:51:45,102
For the role of the antagonistic accomplice...

758
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:49,222
...Lee chose James Tien, an actor
who had appeared with Lee in two...

759
00:51:49,223 --> 00:51:52,276
...of his previous three films in Hong Kong.

760
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:56,422
The second accomplice was to be a strong
but simple-minded martial artist.

761
00:51:56,423 --> 00:52:00,382
These would be character attributes
that would allow for a different type...

762
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,822
...of dynamic to occur between
the accomplices as they fought their...

763
00:52:03,823 --> 00:52:06,478
...way up each level of the pagoda.

764
00:52:06,503 --> 00:52:09,822
Lee ultimately settled on
Hong Kong stuntman, Chieh Yuan...

765
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:11,862
...to play the role of this accomplice.

766
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:15,314
It would be the first time these
two had worked together.

767
00:52:15,343 --> 00:52:19,716
At the time of filming, the rest of Lee's
accomplices had not been decided.

768
00:52:19,863 --> 00:52:22,102
Within the pagoda, Lee and his accomplices...

769
00:52:22,103 --> 00:52:27,062
...would have to battle upwards past five
levels, each guarded by a martial artist...

770
00:52:27,063 --> 00:52:28,622
...of a particular style.

771
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:30,222
The first level was to be...

772
00:52:30,223 --> 00:52:33,262
...guarded by Whong In Sik,
who was to be portrayed as a...

773
00:52:33,263 --> 00:52:35,422
...master of a kicking style.

774
00:52:35,423 --> 00:52:37,342
Whong had worked with Lee before...

775
00:52:37,343 --> 00:52:41,079
...appearing as one of his opponents
in The Way of the Dragon.

776
00:52:43,183 --> 00:52:47,222
Lee had chosen his real-life
senior-most student, Taky Kimura...

777
00:52:47,223 --> 00:52:49,542
...to play the guardian of the second floor.

778
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:54,302
According to Kimura, Lee wanted him
to utilize praying mantis gung fu...

779
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:59,222
...as well as some elements of wing chun,
both arts that emphasize infighting...

780
00:52:59,223 --> 00:53:03,382
...use of hands predominately,
with kicks limited to below the waist.

781
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:10,822
I think it was in October of '71-'72,
in that era. He called me and said he...

782
00:53:10,823 --> 00:53:15,022
...wanted me to be in that movie.

783
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:19,742
I said, "Look, Bruce, I've got two left
front feet. "You know it and I know it.

784
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:24,222
"There's probably 1,000 people
in Hong Kong that can do it better.

785
00:53:24,223 --> 00:53:28,142
"Just let me sit here
and enjoy the fruits of your success.

786
00:53:28,143 --> 00:53:31,102
"You know me, I don't need to be in that."

787
00:53:31,103 --> 00:53:32,982
He said, "No, I want you in it.

788
00:53:32,983 --> 00:53:35,822
"I'm the technical director
and the co-producer.

789
00:53:35,823 --> 00:53:37,542
"Don't worry about it."

790
00:53:37,543 --> 00:53:40,502
So, I reluctantly, for fear that he'd...

791
00:53:40,503 --> 00:53:45,062
...kick my butt if I said no, at that point,
I said okay. He'd already sent me...

792
00:53:45,063 --> 00:53:48,342
...an airline ticket. And really, I think
at this point in his life...

793
00:53:48,343 --> 00:53:54,782
...I think he had transcended the gimmicks
that are usually in these movies.

794
00:53:54,783 --> 00:53:59,382
And I think that he had gotten to that
plateau where you could just simply do...

795
00:53:59,383 --> 00:54:02,662
...the simple, you know,
normal things and yet...

796
00:54:02,663 --> 00:54:05,796
...create that excitement within that simplicity.

797
00:54:06,503 --> 00:54:10,222
Lee selected another
of his real-life students, Dan Inosanto...

798
00:54:10,223 --> 00:54:12,182
...to be guardian of the third floor.

799
00:54:12,183 --> 00:54:15,742
As he was not only adept
in Lee's art of jeet kune do...

800
00:54:15,743 --> 00:54:19,422
...but in addition, was also
an advance practitioner in the arts...

801
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:22,556
...of kempo karate and Filipino escrima.

802
00:54:22,903 --> 00:54:26,382
Lee opted to have Inosanto employ
methods from both arts...

803
00:54:26,383 --> 00:54:29,942
...which he believed would add
an exciting visual element to the film...

804
00:54:29,943 --> 00:54:33,622
...and serve to break up
the unarmed combat sequences.

805
00:54:33,623 --> 00:54:38,582
Inosanto was also a brilliant exponent
of the nunchaku, allowing Lee to film...

806
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:42,034
...the first-ever nunchaku battle
between two opponents.

807
00:54:42,383 --> 00:54:46,542
Grappling or joint-locking would also
serve to add a fresh, visual element to...

808
00:54:46,543 --> 00:54:51,902
...the fight sequences. For this reason, Lee
settled on Korean hapkido grand master...

809
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:57,118
...Ji Han Jae, who at the time of filming
was a seventh-degree black belt in the art.

810
00:54:57,343 --> 00:55:00,462
Ji would be the guardian
of the fourth level of the pagoda.

811
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,702
Andrews Air Force Base.

812
00:55:02,703 --> 00:55:04,914
I did teaching time there.

813
00:55:07,143 --> 00:55:11,356
The tae-kwan-do master,
Jhoon Rhee, held...

814
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:14,633
...an international karate championship.

815
00:55:14,663 --> 00:55:17,955
I was there to do a demonstration.

816
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,662
At that time Jhoon Rhee
introduced me to Bruce Lee.

817
00:55:21,663 --> 00:55:25,982
I showed him, he looked at my technique
and he liked my technique.

818
00:55:25,983 --> 00:55:28,622
That's why he came
to the Andrews Air Force Base.

819
00:55:28,623 --> 00:55:30,902
He learned several techniques.

820
00:55:30,903 --> 00:55:32,862
Then, he went back to Hong Kong.

821
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,102
He invited me.

822
00:55:34,103 --> 00:55:36,582
Lee decided to have yet
another of his students...

823
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:41,982
...Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, play the role of the
guardian of the highest floor of the pagoda.

824
00:55:41,983 --> 00:55:47,102
He fights with an unknown style, which
symbolized the highest level of martial art.

825
00:55:47,103 --> 00:55:51,102
This unknown style was
the essence of jeet kune do.

826
00:55:51,103 --> 00:55:56,761
I was at the top of the pagoda because,
you know, I was the most effective fighter.

827
00:55:57,143 --> 00:55:58,942
And I didn't have any style.

828
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:02,702
And I was also in a place where my...

829
00:56:02,703 --> 00:56:05,471
...strengths were...

830
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:09,642
...enhanced by the environment.
So it was dark in there.

831
00:56:09,643 --> 00:56:11,542
I was supposed to be light-sensitive.

832
00:56:11,543 --> 00:56:15,002
My eyes were light-sensitive,
and that was a problem for me.

833
00:56:15,003 --> 00:56:19,222
But other than that, I was an incredible
human specimen, etcetera.

834
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:21,142
That was the whole idea about it.

835
00:56:21,143 --> 00:56:27,022
And he started knocking out the panes
in the walls, so more light came in.

836
00:56:27,023 --> 00:56:30,382
I couldn't see. And that's when
he got his advantage in the fight.

837
00:56:30,383 --> 00:56:33,562
The fact that Lee's character
in The Game of Death would be taking...

838
00:56:33,563 --> 00:56:37,142
...on advocates of different styles
on each level of the temple...

839
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:41,142
...was significant in a larger context
than might be initially evident.

840
00:56:41,143 --> 00:56:43,382
For Lee wasn't just taking on the various...

841
00:56:43,383 --> 00:56:48,222
...exponents of particular styles,
but the very notion of styles itself.

842
00:56:48,223 --> 00:56:53,462
I think it's evident in The Game of Death
how he planned to fight a person...

843
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:59,076
...of a different style, a very precise style,
on each floor of the pagoda.

844
00:56:59,223 --> 00:57:03,782
And show how he could fit in
with anybody else's style...

845
00:57:03,783 --> 00:57:06,342
...thus having no style of his own.

846
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:09,822
In the battle of the third floor,
Lee's character makes use of...

847
00:57:09,823 --> 00:57:11,636
...a green bamboo whip.

848
00:57:11,703 --> 00:57:15,542
The whip represents flexibility,
an attribute which Lee felt...

849
00:57:15,543 --> 00:57:20,234
...a martial artist must possess if he was
to be successful in combat.

850
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:25,542
Since combat, like life, is not predictable,
Lee held that one must possess...

851
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:29,942
...a pliable adaptability
in order to change with change.

852
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:31,382
Lee has his character...

853
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:35,502
...dressed in a one-piece yellow track
suit to symbolize no affiliation...

854
00:57:35,503 --> 00:57:37,662
...with any known martial arts style.

855
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,222
I think the wearing
of the yellow track suit...

856
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:44,722
...was an expression of how
he felt about the martial arts...

857
00:57:44,723 --> 00:57:51,182
...that you need not dress as a traditional
uniform in order to be an effective fighter.

858
00:57:51,183 --> 00:57:54,102
That yellow track suit is
something that's comfortable...

859
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:58,476
...it's flexible, you can
move without restriction.

860
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:01,982
So I think that was why he chose that.

861
00:58:01,983 --> 00:58:04,262
With his cast now firmly in place...

862
00:58:04,263 --> 00:58:09,956
...Lee spends the next three months
of his life from August to October of 1972...

863
00:58:10,183 --> 00:58:13,156
...putting his martial vision on celluloid.

864
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:16,272
Bruce was a perfectionist on a film set.

865
00:58:16,423 --> 00:58:20,841
He always choreographed all
of his own fights in detail...

866
00:58:20,983 --> 00:58:25,102
...writing them down, every movement,
every single movement, rehearsing them...

867
00:58:25,103 --> 00:58:27,553
...endlessly with the stuntmen.

868
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:32,742
And having many takes
so that it was always just perfect.

869
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:38,071
Bruce was very aware of how
camera angles worked in fight scenes.

870
00:58:38,543 --> 00:58:42,662
I visited him on The Game of Death set
on more than one occasion.

871
00:58:42,663 --> 00:58:47,582
The children, Brandon and Shannon, and I
were always welcome on the film sets.

872
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:51,922
We enjoyed going there because
he was having a lot of fun with it.

873
00:58:52,063 --> 00:58:56,622
First of all, Kareem was his good friend,
as was Dan Inosanto...

874
00:58:56,623 --> 00:58:58,142
...and some of the other...

875
00:58:58,143 --> 00:59:00,902
...martial artists as well,
were his good friends.

876
00:59:00,903 --> 00:59:04,673
He had worked with them
many times in the past.

877
00:59:04,703 --> 00:59:07,262
As you know, Kareem was his student...

878
00:59:07,263 --> 00:59:10,521
...Dan was his student
and assistant instructor...

879
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:13,662
...and so he had a real fun time working with...

880
00:59:13,663 --> 00:59:17,022
...these fellows and
constructing the fight scenes.

881
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:21,182
The results are three carefully crafted
and meaningful sequences...

882
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:23,997
...that resonate on many different levels...

883
00:59:24,103 --> 00:59:27,622
...as well as the most
graceful and dynamic presentation...

884
00:59:27,623 --> 00:59:32,201
...of the human form in hand-to-hand
combat ever captured on film.

885
00:59:39,783 --> 00:59:44,201
What you're about to see has never been
seen before in its entirety.

886
00:59:44,223 --> 00:59:47,622
It's the footage that Bruce Lee shot
for The Game of Death...

887
00:59:47,623 --> 00:59:50,542
...the takes he had indicated
as the ones to be selected...

888
00:59:50,543 --> 00:59:54,599
...for inclusion in the film
and the dialogue he had written.

889
00:59:54,943 --> 00:59:57,882
The footage, like the film, is incomplete.

890
00:59:57,983 --> 01:00:01,402
Approximately two minutes of footage
that represented the beginning...

891
01:00:01,403 --> 01:00:05,279
...of the film's finale have been
lost to the ravages of time.

892
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:08,422
In that missing footage, Lee's two allies...

893
01:00:08,423 --> 01:00:13,422
...James Tien and Chieh Yuan, come up
the stairs ahead of Lee and enter into...

894
01:00:13,423 --> 01:00:17,038
...the third level of the pagoda,
the Hall of the Tiger.

895
01:00:17,303 --> 01:00:21,842
There they meet the escrima master, whose
habit is to beat out a teasing rhythm...

896
01:00:21,843 --> 01:00:25,113
...on his sticks prior
to killing his adversary.

897
01:00:25,183 --> 01:00:29,601
Chieh Yuan sets out to attack the escrima
master with a large heavy club...

898
01:00:29,623 --> 01:00:31,462
...but is quickly disarmed.

899
01:00:31,463 --> 01:00:34,402
The escrima master then casts his sticks aside...

900
01:00:34,403 --> 01:00:37,982
...and battles Chieh Yuan, whom he
proceeds to render unconscious...

901
01:00:37,983 --> 01:00:40,422
...with a series of strikes and kicks...

902
01:00:40,423 --> 01:00:44,238
...known in kempo karate
circles as the Dance of Death.

903
01:00:45,223 --> 01:00:50,119
Now, it is James Tien's turn to
battle with the escrima master.

904
01:00:50,143 --> 01:00:54,922
It is at this point that Bruce Lee's final,
never-before-seen footage...

905
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:56,800
...for The Game of Death begins.

906
01:02:46,343 --> 01:02:48,315
Do you speak any English?

907
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,634
Of course I speak English.

908
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:58,841
I hope you don't mind,
if we move our man...

909
01:02:59,263 --> 01:03:03,192
...so that the two of us will
have more room to groove.

910
01:03:05,623 --> 01:03:06,833
But...

911
01:03:07,023 --> 01:03:12,556
...have your men stay as far away
from the stairway as possible.

912
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:18,716
You know, baby...

913
01:04:20,103 --> 01:04:22,359
...this bamboo is longer...

914
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:28,196
...more flexible, and very much alive.

915
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:34,062
And when your flashy routine cannot
keep up with the speed and elusiveness...

916
01:04:34,063 --> 01:04:35,742
...of this thing here...

917
01:04:35,743 --> 01:04:40,036
...all I can say is
that you will be in deep trouble.

918
01:04:42,983 --> 01:04:45,513
That, we will have to find out.

919
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:28,201
I'm telling you,
it's difficult to have a rehearsed routine...

920
01:05:28,223 --> 01:05:30,036
...to fit in with...

921
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:32,316
...broken rhythm.

922
01:05:44,669 --> 01:05:46,197
You see...

923
01:05:46,349 --> 01:05:50,722
...rehearsed routines
lack the flexibility to adapt.

924
01:07:02,949 --> 01:07:04,477
Surprised?

925
01:08:53,549 --> 01:08:55,407
How do you like that?

926
01:09:01,589 --> 01:09:03,686
How do you like that?

927
01:12:21,789 --> 01:12:24,948
As you gentlemen know,
red means danger.

928
01:12:24,949 --> 01:12:30,108
Therefore, I advise to you people
not to step into this warning arena.

929
01:12:30,109 --> 01:12:33,228
If you want to go on living, stop here.

930
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:36,123
Go back downstairs. Life is precious.

931
01:25:46,869 --> 01:25:50,479
Little fellow,
you must have given up the hope of living.

932
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:57,608
On the contrary,
I do not let the word "death" bother me.

933
01:26:00,429 --> 01:26:02,321
Same here, baby.

934
01:26:04,269 --> 01:26:06,480
Then what are you waiting for?

935
01:30:08,269 --> 01:30:11,242
This tough son-of-a-gun is wearing me out.

936
01:31:44,149 --> 01:31:47,486
Why continue? Just let me pass.

937
01:31:50,429 --> 01:31:53,562
You have forgotten that I, too...

938
01:31:53,909 --> 01:31:56,598
...am not afraid of death.

939
01:34:48,189 --> 01:34:50,928
I've been categorized
as the keeper of the grave...

940
01:34:50,929 --> 01:34:56,508
...up in Seattle and I try to make it there
at least once a month often times...

941
01:34:56,509 --> 01:34:58,948
...during the month I go up
there four or five times...

942
01:34:58,949 --> 01:35:02,108
...depending on who comes in
from you know, other parts of the world...

943
01:35:02,109 --> 01:35:04,028
...or something like that.

944
01:35:04,029 --> 01:35:07,748
I find that there are many
people that come up...

945
01:35:07,749 --> 01:35:11,168
...they're not even martial artists,
you would normally expect...

946
01:35:11,169 --> 01:35:13,108
...that the people who go there
are in martial arts...

947
01:35:13,109 --> 01:35:17,828
...and they want to try to have some
of that ability rub off on them.

948
01:35:17,829 --> 01:35:21,788
I go up there and I make it a point
to talk to people when I see them up there.

949
01:35:21,789 --> 01:35:25,228
And oftentimes they tell me,
"I'm not even into martial arts.

950
01:35:25,229 --> 01:35:29,908
"But I just came to try
to have some of that inspiration of his...

951
01:35:29,909 --> 01:35:35,242
"...come into my life, because obviously
I'm in a place where I need something."

952
01:35:35,269 --> 01:35:37,388
And personally, because of Bruce...

953
01:35:37,389 --> 01:35:41,758
...I've been able to help several young
people to find themselves, to get out of...

954
01:35:41,759 --> 01:35:46,125
...the drug scene and things like that.
And I don't take credit for that. It's Bruce.

955
01:35:46,549 --> 01:35:51,828
I mean I get letters now,
27 years after he's been gone...

956
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:55,268
...from people who weren't even born
when he was alive.

957
01:35:55,269 --> 01:36:00,801
They're telling me how he has motivated
them to be a better person, to be...

958
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:05,468
...to achieve their goals,
to be in better physical condition...

959
01:36:05,469 --> 01:36:10,148
...to live their own life
from their own heart, rather than just...

960
01:36:10,149 --> 01:36:12,548
...following or emulating somebody else.

961
01:36:12,549 --> 01:36:17,258
It really does my heart good, and I think
that Bruce would be smiling down...

962
01:36:17,259 --> 01:36:21,448
...to know that his work and his art
have continued to benefit...

963
01:36:21,449 --> 01:36:23,087
...people all over the world.

964
01:36:24,309 --> 01:36:26,308
There are lines that
express your philosophy.

965
01:36:26,309 --> 01:36:28,648
- I don't know if you remember them...
- I remember them.

966
01:36:28,649 --> 01:36:29,788
- Let's hear it.
- I said...

967
01:36:29,789 --> 01:36:32,000
...this is what it is, okay?

968
01:36:33,389 --> 01:36:35,725
I said, "Empty your mind.

969
01:36:36,269 --> 01:36:37,828
"Be formless.
