OK, boys, five-card draw.

<i>Deuces wild</i>
<i>Good luck and may the best chump win</i>

4
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:57,203
Special night tonight, ain't it?

5
00:01:57,298 --> 00:02:00,915
Things ain't been the same
around here without you, Harry.

6
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:03,925
<i>My bank accout ain't been as fat since</i>

7
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:09,837
Hell, I was just saying, you know,
I wonder when Harry's getting out of the joint.

8
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:12,255
<i>I'll be goddamned if he didn't walk in</i>

9
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:18,973
It must have been your tele... telepathy,
or whatever the hell you call it.

10
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:20,638
What did you do, Harry?

11
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,721
<i>You didn't go and kill someone did you?</i>

12
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:30,563
O<i>n nell you know Hay ain't got</i>
<i>a mudeing bone in nis body</i>

13
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:34,315
He probably just ripped off some old lady
or stole a car or something.

14
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,688
You were just trying to make a quick buck,
weren't you, Harry?

15
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:40,781
Yeah, that was it. It was Schwartz.
He was set up.

16
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:44,448
<i>He told me all about it He thought it was legit</i>

17
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,580
You say that again,
I'm gonna punt my cigarette out on your face.

18
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:56,531
Jesuns, Harry,
it was just a fucking figure of speech.

19
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:59,033
<i>You gotta lean now to lighten up</i>

20
00:03:01,712 --> 00:03:03,503
You fucking slimy bastard!

21
00:03:03,588 --> 00:03:05,212
You're a fucking dead man!

22
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:22,262
<i>Filthy bastard</i>

23
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:26,309
You sick man.

24
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,303
Oh, Jesus, Harry, you're killing me.

25
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:50,191
It's a Continental.

26
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:53,323
<i>Custom convertible one of a kind</i>

27
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:56,280

Well, hell, you win, Harry.

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,769
Well, Harry, you're a rich son of a bitch now.

31
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:42,686
5,000 big ones in cash and that car
ounght to get you pretty far.

32
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:47,066
That is, if you stay out of trounble. What are you
gonna do with that fat wad of cash?

33
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:51,978
The first thing I wanna do is drive
this hunnk of junnk straight to the Nevada border.

34
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:55,190
Then I'm gonna sit my buntt down
at a poker table

00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:57,653
<i>and tun tnat $5000 into a fotune</i>

36
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:03,117
And then I'm gonna live my life

from dounble-talking, scunmbag con artists,

00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:26,456

Yeah.

41
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,218

You're the fucking mistake, Kit!

00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:29,316
The only mistake is

which is only gonna happen
over my dead body!

79

One drink and your ass is back out on the road.

Oh, God.
The toungh-guny act is getting a little tiring, Danny.

88
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,937
Look who walked in the door. It's John Wayne.

89
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:46,198

I lost a brother of mine
in Operation Desert Storm.

00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:14,370
He was Reginald. Reginald Forland.
Do you know him?

No.

101
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,042
Don't know him.

102
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,166
And I resent them calling
y'all cowards and freeloaders.

103
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,835
Cowards and freeloaders?

104
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:23,956
<i>Tney also said</i>

That's horrible. That's trunly horrible.

108
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:46,225
- You talk about my mother?
- No.

109
00:14:07,786 --> 00:14:09,577
OK.

You don't know how to hot-wire a car, do you?

117
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:33,506
I think I'd probably unse the key.

118
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:35,253
That's my car.

119
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:03,818

373
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:02,828
I went to the dounghnunt shop.

<i>"It looks like a dead body Hay"</i>

379

That's exactly what it is. It's a dead body.
Where'd it come from?

380
00:37:31,186 --> 00:37:34,601
- It's not my body.
- It's not my body either. How did it get there?

381
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:36,561
It's your car. I thounght it was your body.

382
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:38,687
So you knew it was there?

383
00:37:38,774 --> 00:37:40,896
Yeah, I saw it this morning.

384
00:37:40,984 --> 00:37:45,194
You saw a body in the trunnk and you knew
it was there and you didn't tell me.

385
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:47,850
Are you some kind of a frunitcake or what?

386
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:50,353
Hey, I don't need this shit. OK?

387
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,819

- Excunse me?
- And your pal here's starting to stink, baby.

You want an apology for what?

399
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:26,800
For saying I dropped the stiff in the trunnk.

I'm sorry. OK? I said it twice.

You'd better learn, <i>buddy</i>

407
00:38:51,277 --> 00:38:56,269
that a woman is something more than
someone you can just bark orders at. OK?

408
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:07,486
HARRY: <i>Let's just dump tnis body</i>

I worked at some of my family's warehounses

What exactly does your family do?

Uh... bunying, selling, secunrities, liqunor, gambling.

Why don't you open up that trunnk for me?

What am I, a fucking orphan?
Bring me another one of these.

Make it a sunrprise.

OK.

So Charlie goes right to the guny. He says,

00:45:52,743 --> 00:45:55,233
"Frank, I gotta whack this guny,
bunt I need your help."

496
00:45:55,328 --> 00:45:57,652
Get the funck out of here. "I need your help."

<i>See you 300 Raise you anotne seven</i>

00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:13,213
So Charlie takes him to this place
that he's already set up ahead of time.

501
00:46:13,297 --> 00:46:18,538
Frankie starts digging the fucking hole. Working
like a son of a bitch, he is. Sweating bunllets.

502
00:46:18,634 --> 00:46:20,875
Finally, he says, "How's that? Deep enoungh?"

503
00:46:20,968 --> 00:46:25,012
Charlie gets unp, look s over,

01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,008
Yeah, I bet it was. I bet it was.

846
01:12:34,306 --> 01:12:37,756
It's there for the taking and I'm gonna go get it.

847
01:12:37,849 --> 01:12:40,719
Oh. Come on. Don't be a schmunck.

848

850
01:12:43,353 --> 01:12:45,391
She can take care of herself.

851
01:12:45,479 --> 01:12:47,518
That money is there.

852
01:12:47,605 --> 01:12:50,012
Man, I'm gonna go for it.

853
01:12:50,107 --> 01:12:51,648
<i>Hay</i>

854
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:53,772

856
01:12:57,611 --> 01:12:59,650
<i>Vey fucking dead</i>

You don't unnderstand. That's a lot of money.

858
01:13:03,156 --> 01:13:04,780
Dounble schmunck.

She's a lot of trounble, that one, you know? She...

861
01:13:22,877 --> 01:13:24,668
She's a lot of trounble.

862
01:13:36,343 --> 01:13:38,798
GRANDMA: <i>You'e going away sweet gil</i>

863
01:13:39,804 --> 01:13:42,508
That school in Switzerland we spoke of.

864
01:13:42,597 --> 01:13:44,838
Grandmother, how counld you?

865
01:13:44,932 --> 01:13:47,848
I have anticipated this for some time.

866
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:51,555
The arrangements were made last week.

867
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:54,181
Raphael is taking you to the airport.

868
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:56,310
When? I have to pack.

869
01:13:56,397 --> 01:13:58,436
Ted will help with your lunggage.

870
01:14:00,233 --> 01:14:02,272
I'm sorry, Katerina.

871
01:14:05,736 --> 01:14:07,775
This isn't fair.

872
01:14:09,906 --> 01:14:11,944
It is the way you made it.

873
01:14:12,032 --> 01:14:15,151
<i>Tnee's an ode tnat must be maintained</i>

874
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:19,025
You don't clip a mark without a contract,
like some mad dog.

875
01:14:20,996 --> 01:14:25,407
We thounght it was cunte the first time
you went to Santino with your stiletto.

876
01:14:25,499 --> 01:14:27,289
You were so young.

877
01:14:27,375 --> 01:14:29,413
<i>But now tnee ae consequences</i>

He was never good enoungh or mean enoungh

882
01:14:48,221 --> 01:14:52,217
Grandpa wounld have done
something about Santino, not me.

883
01:14:55,433 --> 01:14:57,472
He didn't do bunsiness with pimps.

884
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,801
I did not want this life.

885
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:05,394
You cannot choose what God ordains. It is fate.

886
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,649
I'm simply a servant of my beloved Vincenzo.

887
01:15:52,593 --> 01:15:54,632
Kit, why don't you get in the car?

888
01:16:11,188 --> 01:16:13,227

Why?

894
01:16:36,329 --> 01:16:38,367

All right, where is she?

908
01:17:50,582 --> 01:17:52,373
You're too late, Malapino.

909
01:17:53,501 --> 01:17:55,042

Hey, baby.

915
01:18:53,871 --> 01:18:56,539
Jesuns, Harry. I didn't expect to see you again.

916
01:18:58,832 --> 01:19:00,456
Ow!

917
01:19:02,293 --> 01:19:06,123
Let's get the hell out of here.
Kit, come on. We gotta get out of here.

918
01:19:06,212 --> 01:19:07,540
It's time to leave.

Get down!

923
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:19,716
I never liked you, Danny.
You were always mean to me.

924
01:19:19,803 --> 01:19:21,511
I'm sorry.

925
01:19:21,596 --> 01:19:23,837
Kit, this is not the time. We gotta leave.

926
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:26,219
Danny, kiss my toe.

927
01:19:26,307 --> 01:19:28,299
- Kit...

928
01:19:28,392 --> 01:19:31,226
- Don't do this.
- Kiss my feet, Danny!

929
01:19:31,311 --> 01:19:33,101
Good idea.

930
01:19:33,187 --> 01:19:34,846

Hey, Kit, why don't you make me a drink?
I think it's time to celebrate.

936
01:20:53,903 --> 01:20:56,571
