1
00:00:01,675 --> 00:00:04,092
(soft music)

2
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:27,452
(light orchestral music)

3
00:01:13,278 --> 00:01:15,861
(all laughing)

4
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,440
(all laughing)

5
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,525
- I told you he was bluffing!

6
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:36,860
- It's not how you play the game Carol,

7
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,970
it's whether you win or lose.

8
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,273
- Obviously.

9
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,554
(doorbell rings)

10
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:42,387
Excuse me.

11
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,792
- [Woman] Hi.

12
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:52,090
- Hi.

13
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,280
- I'm sorry to bother you
but I was up at the church

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,080
and I was waiting for some
people who never showed up

15
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,933
and well my friend got
a little weird on me.

16
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,960
Anyhow I was wondering if
I could use your phone,

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,130
if it's not too much trouble.

18
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,420
- Oh of course dear, please come in.

19
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,253
- Thanks.

20
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,880
(line ringing)

21
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,863
No answer.

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,140
- I guess I could drive you home.

23
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,760
- Thanks, mister?

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,160
- Lake, Kevin Lake.

25
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,210
- Stacy Lockwood.

26
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,043
- Hi.

27
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,120
Sure you don't want to
go home with your friend?

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,953
- No way.

29
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:40,499
(suspenseful music)

30
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:54,668
(engine revving)

31
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,200
(tires screeching)

32
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,875
- Cheerleading camp was fun,

33
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,830
but what I'm really looking
forward to is next year.

34
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,720
I mean it's not like being
a junior is so great,

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,203
but you know friends and all.

36
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,940
- Is your friend upset about something?

37
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,973
- It's alright, she's just kind of weird.

38
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,893
Oh here, turn right.

39
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,610
That's our place, the one
with the light outside.

40
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,810
I guess they're still out.

41
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,960
I'll just go next door.

42
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,643
Thanks, it was really sweet
of you to rescue me like that.

43
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:52,776
- I'll wait 'til you get inside.

44
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,276
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

45
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,176
(ominous music)

46
00:04:15,128 --> 00:04:16,864
- [Stacy] Go away!

47
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:19,697
(Stacy screaming)

48
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:26,018
(dramatic music)

49
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:34,585
Help!

50
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:37,808
- [Man] Stacy?

51
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:39,192
What's going on?

52
00:04:39,192 --> 00:04:40,847
- [Stacy] Help me.
- Stacy?

53
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,733
- [Stacy] Help me, I've been stabbed!

54
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:44,665
- Stacy who did this?

55
00:04:44,665 --> 00:04:47,704
(Stacy sobbing)

56
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,269
- I can't feel my legs.

57
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:52,102
- Call an ambulance.

58
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:53,269
- I can't breathe.

59
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:54,485
- It's gonna be alright Stacy.

60
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:57,150
Just hold on, hold on.

61
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,460
Stacy, hold on, it's gonna be alright.

62
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,150
- I thought the coach's
speech was right on target.

63
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,120
He really...

64
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:16,183
(all chattering)

65
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,544
- [Man] Step back, step back.

66
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:20,651
Just give me five minutes
please, thank you.

67
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:22,366
- [Man 2] There he is now.

68
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:23,830
- [Man 3] I chased the
car until I realized

69
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,480
what I saw was a knife and came back here.

70
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,313
- What's going on?

71
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:27,807
- It's Stacy.

72
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:28,640
- What?

73
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,473
No!

74
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:31,442
Stacy!

75
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:36,858
What's going, what happened?

76
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:40,161
(suspenseful music)

77
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:42,828
(siren wailing)

78
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,930
(doctors chattering)

79
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,890
- [Doctor] Her respiration
at 24 and dropping.

80
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,290
- [Nurse] And her systolic BP is 40,

81
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,903
I can't read the diastolic.

82
00:05:57,903 --> 00:05:58,985
(machine beeping)

83
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:00,017
- [Doctor] Full arrest.

84
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:02,350
- [Doctor 2] We've lost her.

85
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:06,192
- [Cheerleaders] Okay.

86
00:06:06,192 --> 00:06:07,859
Blue, orange, white!

87
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:10,044
Go get 'em!

88
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:12,451
- [All] Fight, fight, fight!

89
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:14,882

90
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:15,999

92
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:20,927

93
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,925
Go get 'em!

00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:24,506
- [All] Fight, fight, fight!

00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:27,019

96
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:27,920
Go get 'em!

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,650
- [All] Fight, fight, fight!

98
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,400

(feedback ringing)

109
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,890
- Thank you, thank you very much.

110
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,960
For the sake of our newcomers,

111
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,220
let me reiterate that my name is Ed Saxe.

112
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,060
I mention this only because

113
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,360
I have been told that a
few misguided upperclassmen

114
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,946
have on occasion

115
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:38,460
(all laughing)

116
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,460
mistakenly referred to me as Ex-Lax.

117
00:07:43,706 --> 00:07:48,706
(all laughing)
(audience applauding)

118
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,282
Okay.

119
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,333
It is excellence.

120
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,763
Excellence in the classroom,

121
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,569
excellence on the playing field.

122
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,736
(audience applauding)

123
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,650
And excellence in the community

124
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,529
that distinguishes Santa
Mira from its rivals.

125
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,279
(crowd cheering)

126
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,790
So, today, the first day
of the rest of your lives,

127
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,320
I issue this challenge to
each and every one of you.

128
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,369
I challenge you to be the best.

129
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:37,826
(audience applauding)

130
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:39,930
The best son or daughter,

131
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,010
the best student, the best athlete,

132
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,252
the best individual
that it is in you to be.

133
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:49,909
(crowd cheering)

134
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:52,266
We live in a competitive world.

135
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,150
The world in which second best

136
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,248
is simply not good enough.

137
00:08:57,248 --> 00:08:58,302
(audience applauding)

138
00:08:58,302 --> 00:08:59,700
And so I ask you,

139
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,404
what is your goal this
year at Santa Mira High?

140
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:05,554
- [All] To be the best!

141
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:06,557
- Again!

142
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:07,680
- [All] To be the best!

143
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,789
- [Ed] One more time!

144
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,400
- [All] To be the best!

145
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,233
(upbeat instrumental music)

146
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:20,965
Be the best!

147
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:24,539
Be the best!

148
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,510
(crowd cheering)

149
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,177
(dramatic orchestral music)

150
00:09:34,945 --> 00:09:35,778
- I'm going to be.

151
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:36,611
- What?

152
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:37,563
- The best.

153
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:39,900
- Give me a break, Angie.

154
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,220
- I am going to edit the yearbook,

155
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,940
and I'm going to be a cheerleader.

156
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,977
- Come on Angela, you're the
best writer in the school,

157
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:49,450
but yearbook editor is nothing
but a popularity contest.

158
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,870
And cheerleading, not a chance.

159
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,990
That's reserved for the
it's great to be me crowd.

160
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,620
- And I'm going to be a lark.

161
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,600
- A lark?

162
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,560
You mean like a Meadowlark?

163
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,780
They're such a bunch of snobs Angie.

164
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,950
- They're not.

165
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,320
They're into social service and things.

166
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,070
- Oh right, they do fashion shows

167
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,740
so they can parade in
front of their parents

168
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,010
and hear how gorgeous they are.

169
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,200
- Well I'm going to be one.

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,730
- No Angie, Stacy Lockwood
is gonna be a lark.

171
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,340
Meridith Ladd is gonna be a lark,

172
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,460
but you and me, we're
just gonna be you and me.

173
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,150
- Jill you don't understand.

174
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,043
I've got this feeling inside me like,

175
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,510
like I don't know, I'm gonna do things.

176
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,820
I'm gonna be someone.

177
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,390
I want what Mr. Saxe says.

178
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,440
To be the best.

179
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,740
- Well you already are
Angie, you already are.

180
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,990
I have to find out how much it costs

181
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,440
but if we want to go my
mom says she'll drive us.

182
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,433
Angela.

183
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,830
Angie.

184
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,550
Angie have you heard a thing I've said?

185
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,513
- Oh I'm sorry.

186
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,020
- God look at Jamie,
isn't she miss popularity?

187
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,070
- Jill stuff it, she's my friend.

188
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,890
- That was at Saint
Joe's, this is Santa Mira.

189
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,143
She's with them now.

190
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,763
- Hey Angie, come join the party.

191
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,733
- Yeah go ahead, I'll catch
up with you after school.

192
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,171
- [Angie] Hi.

193
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,080
- Hi.

194
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,966
I missed you Ang.

195
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:11,280
- Oh me too.

196
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,260
How was Hawaii?

197
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,093
- Awesome.

198
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:15,090
Beaches were unbelievable,
so were the guys.

199
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,950
- Yeah?

200
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,120
- How about you, what did you do?

201
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,663
- Um, you know I just
mostly hung out, you know.

202
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,863
- So, you know the gang, don't you?

203
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,860
- [Angie] Hi guys.

204
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,900
- So anyhow, the substitute,

205
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,880
she's got this unpronounceable name

206
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,110
and she's like four feet tall.

207
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,050
And the first thing she
does is she announces to us

208
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:46,490
that she has a PhD and we
had to call her doctor.

209
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,177
So listen, Cort he stands up and he says,

210
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:51,840
"Hey doctor, I've got
this pain in my heart,

211
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,033
what should I do?"

212
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:55,590
(all laughing)

213
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,423
Look.

214
00:11:56,423 --> 00:11:57,256
- [Woman] Oh it's Monica.

215
00:11:57,256 --> 00:11:58,881
- What is her problem?

216
00:11:58,881 --> 00:11:59,853
- I don't know.

217
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,200
- She used to be kind of cool.

218
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,700
- Yeah, well now she's
kind of a weird, isn't she?

219
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,983
Hey Monica!

220
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,720
Forget your broom?

221
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,812
- I don't need a broom to
fly away from you, you bitch.

222
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:14,783
- [All] Ooh.

223
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:16,460
- Cold.

224
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,180
Well you know it's been
really nice talking to you

225
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,600
but you better run along now.

226
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,460
We don't feed strays here.

227
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,390
(all laughing)

228
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,223
Bye!

229
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,623
- [Man] Stacy!

230
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,910
- Jill, it's starting to happen.

231
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,743
- What?

232
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:39,576
- Everything.

233
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:41,630
- I just got a job at
the attendance office

234
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,080
and guess who the other girl is?

235
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,360
- I don't know, but from
the way you're acting,

236
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,377
it must be someone important it.

237
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:46,950
Who is it, Nancy Reagan?

238
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,920
- Stacy Lockwood.

239
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,900
- Oh, the queen bee herself.

240
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,750
Does that make you one of her drones?

241
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,410
I'm sorry Angie I just don't want

242
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,196
to see you get hurt you know.

243
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,860
That's the Stacey does, she hurts people.

244
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,950
I heard she went after Monica again.

245
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,260
- She didn't mean anything by it.

246
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,970
She was just being funny.

247
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,450
And besides, Monica goes out
of her way to fight people.

248
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,846
(horn honking)

249
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:12,822
♪ I'd love to be your man ♪

250
00:13:12,822 --> 00:13:15,857
♪ So girl, I feel that I know ♪

251
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:19,607
♪ Feel right down in my soul ♪

252
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,330
Thank you Mrs. Anderson.

253
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,370
- Hey Angie.

254
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,800
Congratulations on the job.

255
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,438
- You'll see, this is
going to be a great year.

256
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,271
Bye!

257
00:13:40,097 --> 00:13:43,764
(solemn instrumental music)

258
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,363
Hi Daddy.

259
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,403
- Oh hi Angela.

260
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,343
How was school?

261
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,480
- It was, you know, school.

262
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,313
- Uh-huh.

263
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,530
- I got a job at the attendance office

264
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,540
with this girl who's really cool.

265
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,373
- That's good Angela,

266
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:23,793
you know work gives you dignity.

267
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:26,020
- Yeah.

268
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:29,590
What'cha doing?

269
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,443
- Carburetor.

270
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,767
All right, now to try it out.

271
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,831
(clock ticking)

272
00:14:49,831 --> 00:14:52,463
(alarm ringing)

273
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:55,130
(door creaking)

274
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,640
- Hi mom.

275
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,630
- Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

276
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,800
- I didn't want to interrupt or anything.

277
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,813
- Can I have a hug?

278
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,393
How was school?

279
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,060
- I got a job at the attendance office.

280
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,613
- Well that's wonderful dear.

281
00:15:10,613 --> 00:15:12,800
Did you know that Teresa is here?

282
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,760
- Oh, where?

283
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,402
- In the kitchen.

284
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:16,473
She's making dinner for us.

285
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:26,265
- Hi.

286
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:28,710
- Yuck, vegetables.

287
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,383
- I live on them, you should too.

288
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,470
- Terry.

289
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,303
- Yes?

290
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,547
- What's it like, being on your own?

291
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:39,830
- It's okay.

292
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,430
- No, come on, what's it really like?

293
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,543
- Don't be in such a hurry Angela,

294
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:44,780
it's not all that it's cracked up to be.

295
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,000
You go to work, pay your own bills,

296
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,243
and you stay at home alone a lot.

297
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,830
- Well maybe it's like
that for some people,

298
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,663
but not for me.

299
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,970
I am going to live in Cabrillo County

300
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,130
in one of those houses you know

301
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,260
that overlooks the sea.

302
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,940
And I'm gonna wake up every morning

303
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,860
to the sound of the waves
and the gulls and things.

304
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,610
- Well how are you gonna do that?

305
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,010
- I don't know.

306
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,150
Maybe I'll be a writer
like Danielle Steel.

307
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,380
- That's a pretty dream little sister,

308
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,040
but somewhere you got to stop
dreaming and be practical.

309
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,003
- I can do it.

310
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,140
I'm a good writer.

311
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,900
Jill says I'm the best
writer at Santa Mira.

312
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,150
- I think you're a good writer.

313
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,110
- Teresa you can do anything
you set your mind to.

314
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,450
That's what Mr. Saxe says and
that's what I'm going to do.

315
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,313
- [Terry] Angela!

316
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:30,725
(dramatic music)

317
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,420
- You are so bad.

318
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,525
- Well I thought that's
what she liked about me?

319
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,480
(both laughing)

320
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,333
- Hey Delvecchio,

321
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,870
Cort skipped school yesterday
and he needs an excuse.

322
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,690
I was thinking you could
come up with something.

323
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,540
You being such a good writer and all.

324
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,970
- I don't want to get
in trouble or anything.

325
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,833
- Relax, nobody's gonna know.

326
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,590
- Okay.

327
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,110
- Look, make it creative alright?

328
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,497
So what's been happening?

329
00:17:05,497 --> 00:17:07,630
- Did do you hear about Monica?

330
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,510
She goes walking downtown yesterday

331
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,110
dressed like a rerun
of "The Addams Family."

332
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,290
So this little boy sees her

333
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,270
and he screams and runs away.

334
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,890
By the time his mom catches up with him,

335
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,120
he's crying, he's like totally hysterical.

336
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,100
He saw Snow White,

337
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,329
he thought Monica was the
Wicked Witch coming to get him.

338
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,800
(all laughing)

339
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,990
Good morning Mr. Saxe.

340
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,150
- How is our prettiest office
assistant this morning?

341
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,730
How about it Cort, we
gonna take Ramirez tonight?

342
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,230
- Uh no sir.

343
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,230
- No?

344
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,770
- No sir, we're gonna crush 'em.

345
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,010
- Good, that's what I like to hear!

346
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,449
A winning attitude makes a winning team.

347
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:41,315
(bell ringing)

348
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:42,742
- [Angie] This should take care of it.

349
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:43,614
- Cool.

350
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:44,610
- Guess what?

351
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,450
Student council is sponsoring a ski trip.

352
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,770
It's gonna be in Timberland
and it's an overnighter.

353
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,603
- Yeah?

354
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:50,436
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,230
- Stacy can I see you for a minute?

356
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,880
- Sure Mr. Saxe.

357
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,713
I'll catch you later Cort.

358
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:55,546
- Later.

359
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,420
- So, what do you think,
are you gonna come?

360
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,100
The whole school's invited.

361
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,000
- Me?

362
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,157
- Of course you.

363
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:04,660
It's gonna be a blast.

364
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,660
Besides, it'll give us a
chance to get caught up.

365
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,410
Talk about old times.

366
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,790
- Sure, sure I'll go.

367
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,940
- Okay, great.

368
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,295
I gotta go, bye.

369
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:13,719
- Bye.

370
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,330
(bells ringing)

371
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,300
- [Mrs. Delvecchio] Everyone?

372
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,310
- Well almost everyone.

373
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,550
Jamie's going.

374
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,580
- And you want to go too.

375
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,640
- Could I mom?

376
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,570
Please could I?

377
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,707
They've got chaperones and everything.

378
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:25,350
And the boys stay in a different watch.

379
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,490
- I don't know Angela.

380
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,330
- Oh please mom, please,
please, please say yes.

381
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,230
- We'll discuss it later.

382
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,703
- Blessed are the meek,

383
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:35,693
for they shall inherit the earth.

384
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,930
Blessed are the poor,

385
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,743
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

386
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,083
We who live in Santa
Mira have many blessings.

387
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,123
The blessings of good family,

388
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,283
of lovely homes, good jobs,

389
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,060
and the blessings of a beautiful community

390
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,930
that is as close to paradise as

391
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,653
any of us will ever see on this earth.

392
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,550
Angela, it was just yesterday I baptized

393
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,430
you a babe in your mother's arms.

394
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,740
And look at you now.

395
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,400
A lovely young woman.

396
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,670
- It was a wonderful sermon, father.

397
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,520
- Oh thanks,

398
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,690
but I'm afraid some of the younger

399
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,130
members of the parish might of
thought it was a bit stuffy.

400
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,457
- You spoke the truth, father,

401
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,770
and the truth doesn't change with time.

402
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,040
- I suppose not.

403
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,240
Still, one must be
flexible don't you think?

404
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,680
Nice to see you.

405
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,580
Thanks for coming.

406
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,330
- Angela.

407
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,163
- [Angela] Yes, mom.

408
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,590
- I've been thinking about that ski trip.

409
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,968
- Yes, she said yes!

410
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:38,845
- Okay I get it.

411
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:39,678
She said yes.

412
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,280
Calm down before you beat
those brownies to death.

413
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,200
- It's just so cool!

414
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,050
I told you this was
going to be a great year.

415
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,883
- Aren't you forgetting something?

416
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:47,716
- What?

417
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:48,820
- You don't know how to ski.

418
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,810
- I can learn.

419
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,643
Can't I?

420
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:52,476
We can learn together.

421
00:19:52,476 --> 00:19:54,623
- No way, I'm not going
anywhere near there.

422
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,100
- Then I'll learn on my own.

423
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,450
- Well there's something else.

424
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,631
- What?

425
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:02,080
- It costs $75 for the trip,

426
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,733
and then you got to have
skis, boots, clothing.

427
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,270
- I'll earn it.

428
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,544
- How?

429
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:11,127
(upbeat music)

430
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:18,041
- What was that?

431
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,208
What was that?

432
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,767
It's your bunny.

433
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:34,191
It's gonna blow bubbles out.

434
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,858
(both laughing)

435
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,280
Look at this one.

436
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,910
- Yeah look at the price.

437
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,450
This stuff is all too expensive Angie.

438
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,600
You couldn't afford to
buy a boot in this place,

439
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,480
much less a whole outfit.

440
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,130
- I'll ask for credit.

441
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:08,963
- Right.

442
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,430
Look, we'll check out the rental skis

443
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,080
and we'll see if we can't
borrow a suit from someone.

444
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,473
You look great.

445
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,560
- I look like a pear.

446
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,703
- No you don't, you look fine, really.

447
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,040
- I'm not going.

448
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,270
- Nobody's gonna care how you look.

449
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,400
- I care.

450
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,220
Boys care, everybody cares.

451
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,010
- It doesn't matter, you've
worked too hard for this.

452
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,560
You're gonna go and you're
gonna have a great time.

453
00:21:39,873 --> 00:21:41,290
- [Man] Look out.

454
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:52,142
- I hate this.

455
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,813
- Come here honey.
- Mom!

456
00:21:56,813 --> 00:21:57,646
- Just a little-

457
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,907
- [Mr. Delvecchio] What'd you do?

458
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,040
- He is so hot, I think
he's gonna ask me to prom.

459
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,278
- [Girl] And what about Cort?

460
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:16,129
- Why settle for choice
when you can have prime?

461
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:18,712
(all laughing)

462
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,000
- So what do you suppose Monica was

463
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,550
scribbling in that book of hers?

464
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,223
- I dunno, she still in the shower?

465
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,760
Let's find out.

466
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,963
- You wouldn't.

467
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,893
- Bed time story, girls! (laughs)

468
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,790
Okay, once upon a time,

469
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,760
there was a very strange
little girl named Monica.

470
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,700
Her face was very very white,

471
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,460
and her clothes were very very black.

472
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,350
Now Monica was so weird that

473
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,860
none of the other little
girls would play with her.

474
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,620
She made her diary her constant companion.

475
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,470
And here's what she had to say to it.

476
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,450
Dear diary.

477
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,860
I'm sitting in the back of a
van on my way to Timberland,

478
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,900
all because my parents want me to fit in.

479
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,167
Fit in with Stacy
Lockwood and her toadies?

480
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:11,750
(all laughing)

481
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,884
I'd just as soon kill myself.

482
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:18,034
It would be a real
contribution to society.

483
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,780
Okay, she thinks she is so cool,

484
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,160
but I'll bet she's still a virgin.

485
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,650
Ah, now we're getting into
the meat of the story.

486
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,110
- Come on, Stacy, that stuff's private.

487
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,350
- Well excuse me.

488
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,430
What are you anyhow,
Monica's guardian angel?

489
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,250
Back to the story.

490
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,310
She thinks she is so cool,

491
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,830
but I'll bet she's still a virgin.

492
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,363
- You colossal bitch!

493
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,350
- Hi Monica.

494
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,190
We were just, you know,

495
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,500
feeling out the texture of your prose.

496
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,448
- Give me that back you slut!

497
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:48,427
I will kill you!
- Back off Monica!

498
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,268
Back off.

499
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:50,530
You haven't got any friends here.

500
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,970
- Monica just let it go, let it go.

501
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,404
She didn't mean anything by it.

502
00:23:53,404 --> 00:23:54,453
- I'd like to kill her.

503
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:57,338
- No, you don't mean
that, you're just angry.

504
00:23:57,338 --> 00:24:00,450
- What would a wannabe like
you know about it anyway, huh?

505
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,770
Go on, go, get away from me.

506
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,810
Run back and lick her boots,

507
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,210
that's what you're dying
to do anyway, isn't it?

508
00:24:10,478 --> 00:24:11,976
(door slamming)

509
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:15,809
(brooding instrumental music)

510
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:21,898
(dramatic music)

511
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,890
- Nice clothes, Angela.

512
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,433
Where'd you get them, a thrift store?

513
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,870
Come on girls, let's hit the slopes.

514
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,770
Are you coming Jaime?

515
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,120
- Yeah I'll be right there.

516
00:24:39,668 --> 00:24:41,830
- (sighs) Angie, why'd you
have to fight with her?

517
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,060
- She was being so mean.

518
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,893
- [Stacy] Hey Jaime,

519
00:24:43,893 --> 00:24:45,890
are you coming, or
staying with the strays?

520
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,160
- All right look.

521
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,200
Just stay out of her way
and she'll forget about it.

522
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,033
Okay?

523
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:53,347
Are you gonna be all right?

524
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,180
- We are headed for the same sort of

525
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,740
success on the baseball diamond we enjoyed

526
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,730
on the football field
and the basketball court,

527
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,180
and I just want you to
know that I am proud.

528
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,267
Not just of our teams, but of all of you.

529
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,497
Proud of your ability to compete

530
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:32,760
and of your determination to win.

531
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,570
Which brings me to our last announcement.

532
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,050
Cheerleading trials will be held

533
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,650
at three o'clock this afternoon.

534
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,370
Interested students should
contact Ms. Langdon.

535
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,320
Good luck to each and every one of you.

536
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,700
Will we be seeing you at the
trials this afternoon, Stacy?

537
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,723
- I wouldn't miss it.

538
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:51,680
- Well that's good,

539
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,530
because you are exactly the sort of girl

540
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,020
we need to represent us.

541
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,570
- I'm trying out too, Mr. Saxe.

542
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,940
- Well good, good for you.

543
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,623
Well back to work.

544
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,973
- Life disappoints us and we turn to God.

545
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:08,485
(chuckling)

546
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:11,550
Here I go lapsing into another sermon.

547
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,464
Angela, what's up with school?

548
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:15,297
Now I understand that you've

549
00:26:15,297 --> 00:26:17,410
turned into a fine young writer.

550
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,810
Oh come come now, don't be shy with me.

551
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,823
I'm no stranger.

552
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,290
- Well I've applied to the yearbook staff.

553
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,770
And I'm trying out for cheerleader,

554
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,150
and I think I'm going to be a Lark.

555
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,983
- A Lark?

556
00:26:30,983 --> 00:26:33,440
- The Meadowlarks, it's a service club.

557
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,640
They raise money for the
rehab center in Santa Flora.

558
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,310
- It's real hard to get into,

559
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,910
but Jaime has a friend who's in it,

560
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,020
and she's going to nominate us.

561
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,367
- Service club?

562
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:43,573
Now that's fine.

563
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,773
Service and sacrifice.

564
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,100
Those are two words we
don't hear very often.

565
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,600
This is delicious.

566
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,010
- Would you like some more, Father?

567
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,177
- Yes I would!

568
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,033
Thank you.

569
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:56,866
- Anyone else?

570
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:00,720
(girls giggling)

571
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,773
- [Girls] Larks!

572
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,585
- Me, you've chosen me?

573
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:06,764
- Yeah!

574
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:08,289
- Come on, we've got a lot to do.

575
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:09,122
- Okay, let me just get dressed.

576
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:11,404
- Oh no no no, everybody
comes as they are.

577
00:27:11,404 --> 00:27:13,932
(all laughing)
- Come on, hurry!

578
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,627
(all laughing)

579
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:17,791
(all chattering)

580
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:20,831
- You don't suppose she
looks that good all the time?

581
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:23,391
- Maybe somebody warned her.

582
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,610
(tapping on glass)

583
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:27,272
- Ladies, you are the chosen.

584
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:29,090
The best and the brightest,

585
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,800
the shining stars of the sophomore class.

586
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,175
- The only thing shiny about
me this morning is my nose.

587
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:35,557
(all laughing)
- I know, I know.

588
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:38,733
But my mother wrote this, I
promised her I'd read it, okay?

589
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,560
(clears throat)

590
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,600
If you prove worthy and pass the test,

591
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,720
you will be welcomed into a

592
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,480
sisterhood of achievement and service.

593
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,920
And now, let the initiates come forward

594
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,713
for anointment and instruction.

595
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,773
Come on girls, move it!

596
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,613
Kneel.

597
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,600
Do you, Stacy Lockwood,

598
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,910
promise to abide by
the rules, regulations,

599
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,140
precepts and traditions of the ancient

600
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,160
and distinguished order of Meadowlarks?

601
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,612
- I don't know, I'm not crazy
about rules and regulations.

602
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:14,510
- It's okay we haven't really got any,

603
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,433
just say I do.

604
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,900
- I do.

605
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,393
- Then I welcome you and anoint
you, Meadowlark Lockwood.

606
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:26,570
(all laughing)

607
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,712
Now rise, and fare thee
well in your quest.

608
00:28:29,712 --> 00:28:34,712
(upbeat rock music)
(all cheering)

609
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:43,067
All right, he's yours.

610
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:45,285
- Me?
- Yes, go get him!

611
00:28:45,285 --> 00:28:47,868
(all cheering)

612
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:54,651
(all laughing)

613
00:28:55,905 --> 00:28:58,572
(all screaming)

614
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:05,010
Okay Angela my love.

615
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,957
Oh he's all yours, you get him.

616
00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:14,560
(all laughing)

617
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:25,380
(horn honking)

618
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,960
- Angela?
- Yeah?

619
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,270
- [Terry] Mom said that you
made the Larks, congratulations.

620
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,103
- Thanks.

621
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,963
Terry, did you ever wish
you were someone else?

622
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,423
- Yeah, all the time, why?

623
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:46,012
- I don't know.

624
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,983
There's this girl.

625
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,570
Sometimes she's not very nice,

626
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,790
but she's so good at everything.

627
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,760
- What things?

628
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,593
- Everything!

629
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,300
People things.

630
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,990
- [Terry] You're good at people things.

631
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,010
- No I'm not.

632
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,450
- People like you.

633
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,283
- She doesn't.

634
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,303
- Look Angela,

635
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,480
we'd all like to be someone
else at some time or another.

636
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,203
We are who we are.

637
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,403
Just accept it and do the
best with what God gave you.

638
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,240
- I can't.

639
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,073
I won't.

640
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,620
I want to be better than just me.

641
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,020
I see a boat, it's
sails swollen with wind,

642
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,100
pushing against the current.

643
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,200
A V stretched out behind it marking

644
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,650
the waters where is has been.

645
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,180
And I see me, adrift on a windless sea.

646
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,940
No companion to give me succor,

647
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,020
no compass to give me bearing,

648
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,493
no port to give me hope.

649
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,730
(all chuckling)

650
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,823
- You're quite the
critic, aren't you Cort?

651
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,353
Okay, why don't we hear
what kind of a poet you are?

652
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,363
Well?

653
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:09,960
(Cort clearing throat)

654
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,014
- [Cort] I see a beaver gnawing on a tree.

655
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:12,847
(all laughing)
- I'm warning you, Cort.

656
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:15,150
- No, it's okay, it's an animal.

657
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,693
I see a beaver gnawing on a tree.

658
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,370
Hot and frenzied, wild and free.

659
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,540
- That will be enough, Cort.

660
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,660
- I look at the beaver, I look a the tree.

661
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,149
I look and I wonder, why not me?

662
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:29,063
(all laughing)
- Very good Cort.

663
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,540
So good I want you to trot on down to

664
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,763
Mr. Saxe's office and read it to him.

665
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:41,650
Stacy, why don't you go next?

666
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,040
- Okay.

667
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,980
Face like a ghost, hair black as sin,

668
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,890
the witch of Santa Mira
scratches her chin.

669
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,180
She cackles, she gloats,
she summons her broom,

670
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,863
and flies like a banshee
right out of the room.

671
00:31:56,368 --> 00:31:57,780
- I could kill you, Stacy Lockwood!

672
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,270
- Monica.

673
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,810
Stacy I think you'd better apologize.

674
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,220
I'm sorry Mrs. Chadfield,
it was just a poem,

675
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
it wasn't about her.

676
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:08,817
(bell ringing)

677
00:32:11,658 --> 00:32:14,408
(all chattering)

678
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,880
- We can do it, let's go.

679
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,434
Go, Warriors, go.

680
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:35,267
That's not right.

681
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:37,098
(all laughing)

682
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:38,783
- That's okay, you can start over.

683
00:32:40,555 --> 00:32:45,555
- (exhaling) We can do it,
let's go, Warriors fire it up.

684
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:55,963
We can do it, let's go,
Warriors fire it up!

685
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:57,923
- Good, good.

686
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:01,590
Very nice Angela, but your
moves are still a little loose.

687
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,620
Stacy, you seem to have a handle on it.

688
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,323
Come over and run through it for us.

689
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,310
- Ready, okay.

690
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:22,383
We can do it, let's go,
Warriors fire it up!

691
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:27,233
We can do it, let's go,
Warriors fire it up!

692
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,180
- Excellent Stacy.

693
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,850
Okay everyone listen up.

694
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,640
Final tryouts are Wednesday.

695
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,330
The winners will be announced on Friday

696
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,750
at the closing assembly.

697
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,021
Everybody got it?

698
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:39,610
- Yeah, we've got it!
- Okay good.

699
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,861
Hit the showers.

700
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:43,611
(all chattering)

701
00:33:52,704 --> 00:33:55,775
(bell ringing)

702
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:56,608
- Angie!

703
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:57,470
- Today's the day.

704
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,303
- For what?

705
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,136
- Yearbook staff.

706
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:00,090
Mr. Ludlow is posting the names

707
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,490
outside the journalism room.

708
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:08,938
- [Girl] I made yearbook staff!

709
00:34:08,938 --> 00:34:12,317
(girls shouting in glee)

710
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,150
- So?

711
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,043
- I didn't make it.

712
00:34:16,043 --> 00:34:16,876
- What?

713
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:17,709
Sure you made it,

714
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:18,900
you're the best writer in
the whole sophomore class.

715
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,130
- I didn't make it, Jill.

716
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,040
- There's gotta be some kind of mistake.

717
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,873
Let's go talk to Mr. Ludlow.

718
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:23,180
- I didn't make it, Jill!

719
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,530
Look don't worry about
it, it's not a big deal.

720
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,420
- Angie, you've got a lot going for you.

721
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,360
You're sweet, you're smart.

722
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
You're a lot smarter than I'll ever be.

723
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,647
Everybody likes you, you Lark.

724
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:36,160
You're gonna be a cheerleader,

725
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,610
I mean what else do you want?

726
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,943
Angie.

727
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:49,757
- Today in our last gathering
before the summer break,

728
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:52,924
(audience applauding)

729
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,280
we have a attempted to
recognize and to honor

730
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,240
those scholars and athletes among you

731
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,790
who took to heart the challenge

732
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,450
that I issued at the beginning
of the academic year.

733
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,330
To be the best.

734
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:10,790
And now to close our program
and our year together,

735
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,410
I would like to introduce four girls

736
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,800
who rose to that challenge.

737
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,850
The four new members of the
Santa Mira cheerleading squad.

738
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,360
And I'd like to ask each of them to please

739
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,273
join us up here as her name is called.

740
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,407
Meredith Ladd.

741
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:32,574
(audience applauding)

742
00:35:35,863 --> 00:35:37,946
Congratulations Meredith.

743
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:43,311
Courtney Clay.

744
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:46,478
(audience applauding)

745
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:53,402
Congratulations Courtney.

746
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:55,085
Trish Brennin.

747
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:58,252
(audience applauding)

748
00:36:07,364 --> 00:36:08,947
Good for you Trish.

749
00:36:10,557 --> 00:36:15,362
And last but not least, Stacy Lockwood.

750
00:36:15,362 --> 00:36:17,656
(audience applauding)

751
00:36:17,656 --> 00:36:19,989
Let's hear it for the girls!

752
00:36:22,936 --> 00:36:24,143
(dramatic music)

753
00:36:24,143 --> 00:36:25,453
- Are you okay?

754
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,873
Come on Angie.

755
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,367
Angie?

756
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:36,034
(Angie sobbing)

757
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,520
My mom's waiting, I gotta go.

758
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,283
- Mom sent me looking for you.

759
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,103
Are you gonna get in,

760
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:04,020
or am I gonna have to
pace you all the way home?

761
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,680
- What's that?

762
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,120
- Dad's latest acquisition,
he's gonna resurrect it for me.

763
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,953
Come on, get in.

764
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:16,382
(dramatic music)

765
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,869
Cucumber?

766
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:25,760
- I hate cucumbers.

767
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,043
- I know, it was a joke.

768
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:34,218
You want to tell me about it?

769
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:36,746
- It's nothing.

770
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,900
My life is over, that's all.

771
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:47,830
(both laughing)

772
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,983
- You're gonna do it.

773
00:37:49,983 --> 00:37:51,873
- I've never done this before Jill!

774
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,970
- That's what guys wanna hear
when you, you know. (laughs)

775
00:37:58,115 --> 00:38:00,880
- (laughs) I don't think I'll ever know.

776
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,700
Guys don't even know I exist.

777
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,300
- Oh, here we go again.

778
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,450
Nobody likes me, everybody hates me,

779
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,821
think I'll eat some worms!

780
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:08,830
(Angie laughs)

781
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,850
Give it a rest, Angie.

782
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,963
- What, I am serious!
- You're always serious.

783
00:38:14,452 --> 00:38:17,291
(both laugh)

784
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:19,541
- I wonder what you have
to do to be popular.

785
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,900
- I'll tell you what you could do.

786
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,330
Come to Roger's party
with me on Saturday night.

787
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,060
He said I can invite whoever I want.

788
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,466
So come with me, relax,
have a little drinky-poo.

789
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:32,660
Believe me, if you stop being so uptight,

790
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,850
guys will notice you.

791
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,683
- That's it!

792
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:35,765
- What?

793
00:38:35,765 --> 00:38:39,053
- The party, that's perfect!

794
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,810
I'll invite Stacy to the party

795
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,120
and I will make her my friend!

796
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,613
Jill that's perfect!

797
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:48,916
Jill?

798
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:56,430
(line ringing)

799
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,263
Oh.

800
00:38:57,263 --> 00:38:58,344
- [Mrs. Lockwood] Hello?

801
00:38:58,344 --> 00:38:59,177
- Mrs. Lockwood?

802
00:38:59,177 --> 00:39:01,530
Yeah hi, you don't know
me, but I'm with the Larks.

803
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,460
- [Mrs. Lockwood] Oh I'm sorry dear,

804
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,367
but Stacy isn't here right now.

805
00:39:03,367 --> 00:39:05,130
- Oh, I know, I know.

806
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,630
She's at cheerleader
camp, but that's okay,

807
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,622
because this is actually
supposed to be a surprise.

808
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:12,090
We're having a dinner for the Larks,

809
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,900
the new Larks, on Saturday night.

810
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,130
- [Mrs. Lockwood] How lovely.

811
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:19,000
- Yeah but, like I said, it's
supposed to be a surprise.

812
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,470
So um, if you could just
tell Stacy to be ready

813
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,210
at about nine o'clock and
someone will pick her up?

814
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,631
Okay?

815
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:27,464
- [Mrs. Lockwood] Oh yes dear.

816
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:28,960
And what should she wear?

817
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,950
- Oh, uh something nice,
but casual, you know.

818
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:34,923
- [Mrs. Lockwood] All right.

819
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,030
- Great!

820
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,500
Well nice talking to you.

821
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,798
- [Mrs. Lockwood] Thank you.

822
00:39:40,798 --> 00:39:41,848
And may I ask who is-

823
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,460
- Yes!

824
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,223
So they won't be back until late.

825
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:47,850
- They seem like a nice family.

826
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,400
- Oh yeah, their kids are
so easy to get along with,

827
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,370
they never give me any trouble.

828
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,120
In fact they actually go
to bed when I tell them to.

829
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,225
Oh it's this one.

830
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,058
- Oh.

831
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,910
- Mom, could you leave the car?

832
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:06,743
- What?

833
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:07,670
- If there's a car parked in the driveway,

834
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,800
then people will think someone's home,

835
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,300
and I would feel so much safer.

836
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,410
- Angela, you only have
a learner's permit.

837
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,580
You know you have to have someone
in the car when you drive.

838
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,670
- It's only four of five blocks.

839
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,730
You could walk home and
then I could drive it back.

840
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,410
- [Mrs. Delveccio] Angela,
it is against the law.

841
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,210
- I would feel so much safer, Mom.

842
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,043
Please?

843
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,080
- Really?

844
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,920
Well, it's against my better judgment,

845
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,540
but all right.

846
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,913
But just this once!

847
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,490
Okay, here.

848
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,323
- Thanks Mom.

849
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,740
- I'll wait 'til you get in.

850
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,153
- Oh, they always leave
the backdoor open for me.

851
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:44,410
I'll be fine, don't worry about it!

852
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,897
- Okay, you'll be careful?

853
00:40:45,897 --> 00:40:46,862
- Yes!
- With the car?

854
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,220
- Yes I'll be careful Mom!
- Okay.

855
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,263

862
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,640
- Oh, it's you.

863
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,011
- Come on, hop in.

864
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:44,980
- (scoffing) What's going on Angela?

865
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,140
I checked around, there isn't
any Larks dinner tonight.

866
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:47,973
- Nope,

867
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:50,180
that's just something I told
your mom so she'd let you come.

868
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,013
- Come where?

869
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:53,373
- To a party at Roger Huntley's house.

870
00:41:54,694 --> 00:41:55,527
- A party huh?

871
00:41:55,527 --> 00:41:57,240
- Not just a party, the party.

872
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,090
All the older crowd's gonna be there.

873
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,383
- All right.

874
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,980
Nice wheels.

875
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:11,640
- It's just transportation.
- What's this, hors d'oeuvres?

876
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,600
- Oh, um, my sister, she
sometimes fixes lunch in the car.

877
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,213
- Now that's real class, Angie.

878
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,420
So uh, who'd you say was
gonna be at this party?

879
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,663
- Oh, the older crowd.

880
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:27,040
- Think I'm gonna have to
fortify myself for this one.

881
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,880
Come on, turn here.

882
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,263
- Here?
- Just turn, okay?

883
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,720
- What are you doing?

884
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,113
- Did your brain die or something?

885
00:42:56,113 --> 00:42:57,653
What's it look like I'm doing?

886
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,733
- Oh.

887
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,543
Oh, that's okay.

888
00:43:03,654 --> 00:43:06,730
- (laughs) It's just a little grass.

889
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,140
- I know.

890
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,200
I just don't feel like it.

891
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,323
- So, tell me about this party.

892
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,323
- What's to tell?

893
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:19,613
- (sighs) I don't know, maybe
like how you got invited?

894
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,290
- Um, well I wasn't invited exactly,

895
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,123
it was my friend Jill,

896
00:43:25,123 --> 00:43:27,820
she said that it's okay.
- Oh great.

897
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,830
You're gonna crash and you plan on

898
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,200
taking me along for the ride.

899
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,969
- Oh no, it's okay, Jill said it was fine!

900
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:32,802
- No it's not okay!

901
00:43:32,802 --> 00:43:34,277
Maybe you're into public
humiliation, but I am not.

902
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:36,500
- [Angie] But Stacy, it's not a problem!

903
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,070
- You know what, this
is a really bad idea.

904
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:39,940
You better just take me home.

905
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,280
- That would spoil everything!

906
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,510
- There was never anything to spoil!

907
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,620
Look Angela I'm not going to a
party where I wasn't invited,

908
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,450
and I wouldn't go to that
party if I had been invited.

909
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,010
- Why are you so mean?

910
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:50,910
- Come on, put a lid on it, let's go.

911
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:53,614
- I don't understand, I
just want to be your friend!

912
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:55,496
- (scoffs) Sure.

913
00:43:55,496 --> 00:43:56,600
And I want to fly to the moon.

914
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,200
- I admire you Stacy,
I've always admired you.

915
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,380
You're so pretty and funny and confident.

916
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,213
- You're pathetic.

917
00:44:03,213 --> 00:44:04,573
- All I want is to be like you!

918
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,990
- That's it, I'm out of here.

919
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:08,520
- Wait, wait, no!

920
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,172
- You know what, you are
even weirder than I thought!

921
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:12,182
(dramatic music)

922
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:13,240
Why don't you give Monica a call,

923
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,140
maybe she can be your date.

924
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,457
- No Stacy that's not what I meant!

925
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,080
- [Stacy] Hi, I'm sorry to bother you,

926
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,162
but I was up at the church and
I was waiting for somebody,

927
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:25,160
but they never showed up.

928
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,160
And my friend got a little weird.

929
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,632
Anyhow I was wondering if
I could use your phone,

930
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:31,140
if it's not too much trouble.

931
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,480
- [Woman] Oh of course
dear, please come in.

932
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,563
(suspenseful instrumental music)

933
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,677
(tires screeching)

934
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,703
- [Stacy] You wouldn't believe

935
00:44:55,703 --> 00:44:56,536
what happened to me last night.

936
00:44:56,536 --> 00:44:57,960
Angela-
- (scoffs) That nerd?

937
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,250
- [Stacy] Nerd isn't even the half of it.

938
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:01,280
Then you're gonna love this one.

939
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,130
She tells me how pretty and
funny and confident I am.

940
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:05,731
- [Girl] Ew!

941
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:08,270
- [Stacy] I mean I always
knew she was weird, but geez,

942
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,886
it's like she was asking me
out on a date or something!

943
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:12,950
- [Girl] Wait 'til the
word gets out on this one.

944
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,380
She might as well just dig a hole

945
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,238
and pull the dirt in after her.

946
00:45:16,238 --> 00:45:18,821
(all laughing)

947
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,580
- I would've driven you home.

948
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,043
- You are so weird!

949
00:45:53,902 --> 00:45:55,735
Just go away, go away!

950
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,013
(Stacy screaming)

951
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:23,262
(tires screeching)

952
00:46:29,577 --> 00:46:33,077
(Angie breathing heavily)

953
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,941
(shower water running)

954
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:39,138
(knocking on door)

955
00:47:39,138 --> 00:47:40,976
- [Mrs. Delveccio] Angela?

956
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:43,640
Anela, Jaime's on the phone.

957
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,850
I told her you were in the shower,

958
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,750
but she says she has to speak to you.

959
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,837
Sounds like she's been crying.

960
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,263
- Hello?

961
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,863
You're right, it had to
be some crazy person.

962
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,140
- The sheriff's department spokesman

963
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,820
described the assailant
as a slender teenage girl

964
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,680
with shoulder-length hair.

965
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,624
- The suspect who was wearing-
- That's half the girls

966
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:27,970
at Santa Mira.
- Red sweatpants and

967
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:31,393
a brown shirt was seen
driving a light-colored Nova.

968
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,413
In other news today-

969
00:48:35,184 --> 00:48:38,470
- (chuckling) I'm a teenage
girl with shoulder-length hair,

970
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:40,240
and we have a Nova.

971
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,900
- Don't be ridiculous Angie,
nobody's gonna suspect you.

972
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,483
You're like the nicest girl at Santa Mira.

973
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:49,297
(dramatic music)

974
00:48:51,032 --> 00:48:52,199
- Amen.
- Amen.

975
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,650
- [Preacher] I know that each
of you gathered here today

976
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,163
has a question in your heart.

977
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,010
You want to know where was God

978
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,393
when this terrible thing came to pass.

979
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,223
There are no easy answers.

980
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,713
God gives us the freedom to do and to be,

981
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,570
and in that freedom we are vulnerable.

982
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:32,552
- I know, we loved her too.

983
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,760
- This is strictly routine Angela,

984
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,030
so I don't want you to be nervous.

985
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:44,790
The girl who called Stacy's
mother claimed to be a Lark,

986
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,379
so we're questioning all of the members.

987
00:49:47,379 --> 00:49:48,629
- I understand.

988
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:54,300
- Now, perhaps you could
start by telling me

989
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:56,980
where you were the
evening Stacy was stabbed.

990
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,750
- Yes sir, I was
babysitting for Mrs. Moore

991
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,235
from about 8:30 until maybe 11 o'clock.

992
00:50:03,235 --> 00:50:04,068
- Mm-hm.

993
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,410
How about the Nova
registered to your father?

994
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,730
- That's my sister's, really.

995
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:12,710
I mean my dad let's her drive it,

996
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,990
he's actually fixing up a car for me

997
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:16,500
for when I get my license.

998
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,333
- [Denning] Mm-hm.

999
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:20,420
How well did you know Stacy Lockwood?

1000
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,123
- Um, I knew her, Sergeant
Denning, but not very well.

1001
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,390
- [Denning] But you were both Larks,

1002
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,110
you both worked in the attendance office.

1003
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,323
You went out for cheerleader
together, am I right?

1004
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:33,983
- (chuckling) Not really, not together.

1005
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,393
Stacy kept to her own friends.

1006
00:50:40,087 --> 00:50:40,920
- [Denning] Do you have any idea

1007
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,600
why anyone would want to kill her?

1008
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,133
- No.

1009
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,233
No.

1010
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,570
Stacy was very popular.

1011
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,520
She was maybe the most popular
girl in the sophomore class.

1012
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,490
- [Denning] Well, someone didn't think so.

1013
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,813
Someone wanted her dead.

1014
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,153
- Maybe, um,

1015
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:14,963
it was someone she put down.

1016
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:18,340
- [Denning] Put down?

1017
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,623
- Stacy was real funny.

1018
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:28,740
And sometimes her jokes were
at other people's expense.

1019
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,810
- [Denning] So you
think someone killed her

1020
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:31,260
because she made fun of them?

1021
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:39,087
- That's just very hard to explain.

1022
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:42,223
She was very popular.

1023
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,573
- [Denning] All right
Angela, thanks for coming in.

1024
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:53,210
Angela?

1025
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,160
- Yes?

1026
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,050
- Would you mind taking
a lie detector test?

1027
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,200
We're asking everybody.

1028
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,996
- Sure.

1029
00:51:59,996 --> 00:52:01,780
(dramatic music)

1030
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:05,133
- [Man] Angela, were you
babysitting from 8:30 to 11?

1031
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:07,300
- [Angela] Yes.

1032
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,853
- [Man] Did you kill Stacy Lockwood.

1033
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:10,936
- [Angie] No.

1034
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:25,870
- Sierra Linda country sheriffs

1035
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:28,200
have questioned over 300 individuals

1036
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,470
and checked out over 700 Novas

1037
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:32,860
matching the description
of the suspect vehicle.

1038
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,870
But today nearly two months after

1039
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,910
the brutal slaying of Stacy Lockwood,

1040
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:38,750
they seem no closer to a solution

1041
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,390
than at the beginning of
their long investigation.

1042
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:42,970
Frustrated by official failure

1043
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:44,520
to uncover their daughter's killer,

1044
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,320
Dick and Dana Lockwood called
a press conference today

1045
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,600
to ask the public to cooperate
in solving this crime,

1046
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,700
and to urge investigators
to refocus their efforts,

1047
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,460
seeking the killer not in
the outlying communities,

1048
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,210
but in the Santa Mira student body.

1049
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,830
- We've broken our silence today because

1050
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,453
school is about to start up,

1051
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,780
and we strongly feel that the killer

1052
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:08,140
may be among those
returning to class tomorrow.

1053
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,373
Our Stacy was popular.

1054
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,203
She was an athlete, cheerleader,

1055
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,770
and all-American kind of girl.

1056
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,030
She was the establishment,

1057
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,490
and we have to ask ourselves if

1058
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,870
her killer was not anti-establishment.

1059
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,250
Someone who does agree with the way

1060
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,570
that the majority thinks and acts.

1061
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,820
My wife would like to
say to that individual,

1062
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:29,670
whomever she may be,

1063
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:33,700
that we will never forget
the night we came home

1064
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,453
and saw the flashing lights.

1065
00:53:37,496 --> 00:53:38,329
The ambulance.

1066
00:53:39,858 --> 00:53:41,793
The shock and grief
will be with us forever.

1067
00:53:43,896 --> 00:53:45,300
But the grief we have suffered is nothing

1068
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,130
compared the pain and terror

1069
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,473
that Stacy went through
on that terrible night.

1070
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:54,763
So I say to her killer, who
must be now suffering as well,

1071
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,573
come forth.

1072
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,523
Come forth, confess,

1073
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,003
and ease the pain that
all of us are feeling.

1074
00:54:05,197 --> 00:54:07,780
(line ringing)

1075
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:09,813
- Jill?

1076
00:54:10,973 --> 00:54:12,923
Oh come on Jill, please be there.

1077
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:16,961
I may not get the courage again.

1078
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,680
- There are no bad kids at Santa Mira.

1079
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,380
Though we enter our new academic year

1080
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,263
under a pall of grief and suspicion,

1081
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:32,193
I want to express my
confidence in all of you,

1082
00:54:33,467 --> 00:54:35,410
and I want to remind outsiders

1083
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:39,840
that this terrible incident
happened within the community,

1084
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,693
not in the school.

1085
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,623
We have suffered a shocking loss.

1086
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:49,650
But we must not let that loss sow

1087
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,713
the seeds of distension among us.

1088
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,650
- And I volunteered as a
candy striper at the hospital.

1089
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:00,730
- Wow, Angie, sounds to me
like you could be in danger.

1090
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,563
- Danger?

1091
00:55:01,563 --> 00:55:03,400
- Yeah, of becoming a real socialite.

1092
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,960
Candy striper, peer counselor, Lark.

1093
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,850
- I just wanna do some good I guess.

1094
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,390
- Great, my friend the do-gooder.

1095
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,730
Honestly you make me feel like I should

1096
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:13,813
go to church and confess or something.

1097
00:55:13,813 --> 00:55:16,651
(all yelling)

1098
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:17,484
- Murderer!

1099
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,209
- [Girl] Run, run away!

1100
00:55:19,209 --> 00:55:21,810
(girls yelling)

1101
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,863
- Like those women in the
Bible with the stones.

1102
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,760
- So anyway, I think in
light of what's happened,

1103
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,783
we should disband.

1104
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,533
And I'm gonna make a
motion to that effect.

1105
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,540
- Any seconds?

1106
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,800
- Wait a minute, this is all wrong.

1107
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,350
The Larks didn't kill Stacy.

1108
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:57,610
If we break up it'll be like

1109
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,670
we're admitting we had
something to do with it.

1110
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:03,170
And besides, the Larks are important!

1111
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,280
They were important to Stacy,

1112
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,380
and they're important to the rehab center.

1113
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,610
If we break up...

1114
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,950
We just can't break up, that's all.

1115
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:17,210
- I propose we drop the idea
and get on with the elections,

1116
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,320
and I want to nominate Angela
for secretary of treasure.

1117
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,340
- Oh no no, I couldn't,

1118
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,320
I just didn't want to see
everything fall apart because-

1119
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,153
- Second.

1120
00:56:25,153 --> 00:56:26,223
- Any objections?

1121
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,853
Any other nominations?

1122
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:33,763
Okay, all in favor of
Angela, raise you hands.

1123
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,020
Well Angie,

1124
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,470
it looks like you're our
new secretary treasurer.

1125
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:46,771
(all chattering)

1126
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,453
- Hey Angie.

1127
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,580
- Darren, how are you?

1128
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,913
- Well actually I'm a little bit late.

1129
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,715
- Only about 30 minutes.

1130
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:02,100
- Okay a lot late.

1131
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,558
- But I bet you've got this
really great excuse, right?

1132
00:57:05,558 --> 00:57:06,860
- How'd you know?

1133
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:10,590
Actually, my excuse is
I wanted to talk to you.

1134
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:12,350
See there's this party Friday.

1135
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:13,690
- Yeah?

1136
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,120
- I thought you might like to go with me.

1137
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,360
- Honest?

1138
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,990
- I'm askin' you, aren't I?

1139
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:20,980
- Well-
- Just say yes.

1140
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,100
- Yes!
- Great.

1141
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,440
I'll pick you up around eight, okay?

1142
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,354
Okay so uh, I guess I'll catch you later.

1143
00:57:28,354 --> 00:57:30,680
- Oh um, what about your excuse?

1144
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,850
- Oh I just remembered, I don't
have a first period class.

1145
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,123
So uh, guess I won't need one.

1146
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:40,760
- It's all a bunch of crap.

1147
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,800
- What is, Alicia?

1148
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,400
- This, peer counseling.

1149
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,200
You tryin' to tell me how
to straighten up my act.

1150
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,253
It's all crap.

1151
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,810
- It's just a chance to talk,

1152
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,520
and maybe figure things out together.

1153
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,890
- Together, you and me?

1154
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,023
Right.

1155
00:57:59,023 --> 00:58:01,303
- Well it's better than
getting expelled, isn't it?

1156
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,110
Sometimes people who do drugs,

1157
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:10,430
they're maybe dealing
with some kind of problem-

1158
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,030
- You want to know what the problem is?

1159
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:12,980
You're the problem.

1160
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,910
You and everyone else.

1161
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,730
Here you are pretending you care,

1162
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,990
pretending you want to help me,

1163
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:20,960
when all you really care
about is being popular.

1164
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,760
You and your hotshot friends
don't take jobs like this

1165
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,910
because you're like great humanitarians.

1166
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,960
It's just another notch in your gun belt.

1167
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,640
(dramatic music)

1168
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:37,889
- Wish we had more candy
stripers like you Angela.

1169
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,283
Mrs. Hattan again.

1170
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:45,076
Angela would you go and see
if you can calm her down?

1171
00:58:45,076 --> 00:58:45,909
- Sure.

1172
00:58:45,909 --> 00:58:48,576
(phone ringing)

1173
00:58:51,645 --> 00:58:52,478
- Oh, you!

1174
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,593
You!

1175
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,940
Get away from me, get away from me!

1176
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,960
I know what you are!

1177
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,980
Help, help, help, someone please!

1178
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,413
Please help!

1179
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,240
- The gifts of the Holy Spirit,

1180
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,150
which you're about to receive,

1181
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:19,000
is a spiritual sign and seal
to make you more like Christ

1182
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,003
and more perfect members of this church.

1183
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:29,450
Do you reject Satan, all his works,

1184
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,393
and all his empty promises?

1185
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:33,580
- [Congregation] I do.

1186
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:36,436
- Do you believe in God, the Father,

1187
00:59:36,436 --> 00:59:38,190
creator of heaven and Earth?

1188
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:39,133
- [Congregation] I do.

1189
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,433
- All powerful God, Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1190
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,813
by water and the Holy Spirit,

1191
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,050
free your sons and daughters from sin

1192
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,880
and give them new life.

1193
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,790
Send your holy spirit upon them

1194
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:54,373
to be their helper and guide.

1195
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,453
This we ask through
Jesus Christ, our Lord.

1196
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:05,187
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1197
01:00:06,354 --> 01:00:08,187
- [Congregation] Amen.

1198
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,597
- Forgive me father, for I have sinned.

1199
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,620
- [Girl 1] My dad said
they brought in the FBI,

1200
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:56,264
they're gonna interview
all the Larks again.

1201
01:00:56,264 --> 01:00:57,880
- [Girl 2] I don't know why they bother.

1202
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,570
Everyone knows it was Monica.

1203
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:01,730
- [Girl 1] She dropped out of school.

1204
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:02,900
- [Girl 2] Good.

1205
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,700
She had a lot of nerve
showing her face here,

1206
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,533
day after day.

1207
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,830
- She had an alibi, you know.

1208
01:01:30,129 --> 01:01:32,750
There's no way she
could've possibly done it.

1209
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:33,583
But it didn't matter,

1210
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:35,849
they just kept hounding
her and hounding her.

1211
01:01:35,849 --> 01:01:36,930
- Yeah.

1212
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,530
- All because she was different.

1213
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:40,967
And you know what?

1214
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:42,853
I did it too.

1215
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:46,330
Stacy mocked her so I mocked her.

1216
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:47,830
Stacy said jump, and I jumped.

1217
01:01:52,392 --> 01:01:57,392
You know Angie, I've been
thinking about her a lot lately.

1218
01:01:57,502 --> 01:01:59,663
And I'm ashamed to admit it.

1219
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,633
I never really liked her.

1220
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:05,099
I was just afraid of her.

1221
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,200
And I've been thinking
about her killer too.

1222
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:16,463
Maybe it was, I don't know,

1223
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:19,783
someone like me.

1224
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:38,510
- This is Special Agent Gilwood, Angela,

1225
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:40,200
he's with the FBI.

1226
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,290
He's here to try to straighten out

1227
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,450
some inconsistencies in your statement.

1228
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,590
We checked out your
babysitting alibi Angela,

1229
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:46,890
it doesn't wash.

1230
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,830
And we got another reading
of your polygraph test,

1231
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:50,710
you know what it says?

1232
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,230
It says you're a liar, Angela.

1233
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:54,040
- That's a little harsh, Dick.

1234
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:54,980
Why don't we let Angela here

1235
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,893
tell us what really happened that night.

1236
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,633
Angela?

1237
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:08,450
- You're right about the babysitting.

1238
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:12,473
I just, I lied about that
because I wanted the car.

1239
01:03:13,399 --> 01:03:15,060
- What did you want the car for?

1240
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:20,060
- Um, there was this movie
playing in Sierra Linda,

1241
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,263
and it was R, and I can only see PG.

1242
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,100
- [Gilwood] Do you
remember the name of it?

1243
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,247
- It was "Reckless."

1244
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,828
But I didn't get to see it
because they asked for my ID.

1245
01:03:31,828 --> 01:03:34,690
- (laughs) Well that clears up the problem

1246
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:35,643
with the polygraph.

1247
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:40,327
But you know Angela, you
could still help us out.

1248
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:41,530
- How?

1249
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:43,420
- [Gilwood] You could
tell us more about Stacy.

1250
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,720
What kind of girl she was.

1251
01:03:46,412 --> 01:03:47,830
- She was very popular.

1252
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:48,780
- Did you like her?

1253
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:52,490
- Everybody liked her.

1254
01:03:53,553 --> 01:03:55,460
- I think you're mistaken, Angela.

1255
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,770
Monica Whitley didn't like her.

1256
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:59,990
- But Monica didn't, she would never-

1257
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:01,670
- But someone did.

1258
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,670
Someone disliked her enough to kill her.

1259
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:07,740
In fact the Bureau has worked
up what we call a profile,

1260
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,190
which is a description of what

1261
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:11,773
we think the girl must be like.

1262
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:14,600
Would you care to hear it?

1263
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,803
- Sure, I guess.

1264
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,260
- Let me see.

1265
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:22,150
Oh, a lot of words here.

1266
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,793
You know psychiatrists are, huh?

1267
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,560
I remember a passage near the end

1268
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,850
where they finally get down to it.

1269
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:32,500
Ah, yeah, here it is, here it is.

1270
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,750
She is the same age as her victim

1271
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,820
and a member of the same peer group,

1272
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,330
though her involvement in that group

1273
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,263
is peripheral rather than central.

1274
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,090
She's impulsive, emotional,

1275
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,230
and driven both by fear of inadequacy

1276
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,800
and a desire for acceptance.

1277
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,330
While her crime was abrupt,
irrational and disorganized,

1278
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:55,130
she is unlikely to exhibit strong emotions

1279
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:58,003
when questioned about
her possible involvement.

1280
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:02,633
Hm, it's interesting isn't it, Angela?

1281
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,200
What do you think about it?

1282
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,300
- I think it sounds a lot like me.

1283
01:05:14,711 --> 01:05:16,153
- That's what we thought too.

1284
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,613
In fact we've been doing a
lot of thinking about it.

1285
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,563
Look, I'll tell you what.

1286
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:27,910
Why don't you go home and think
about it over the weekend,

1287
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:29,810
and maybe we can talk some more later.

1288
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:34,823
- I can go now?

1289
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,770
- Of course you can.

1290
01:05:43,375 --> 01:05:45,700
(door clicking)

1291
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:46,760
- It's her.

1292
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:47,980
- Of course it is.

1293
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,440
But all the evidence we
have is circumstantial.

1294
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,447
Unless she confesses.

1295
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:55,160
- (scoffs) I almost feel sorry for her.

1296
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,640
- Don't.

1297
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,390
Feel sorry for the girl she killed.

1298
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,700
- [Mrs. Delveccio] Joe?

1299
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:01,963
- Yeah, I'm out here.

1300
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:06,570
- What are you doing?

1301
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,737
- Oh fixing this gasket.

1302
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:11,063
- You seen Angela?

1303
01:06:11,063 --> 01:06:12,280
- No.

1304
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,272
- I'm worried about her.
- I'm sure she's all right.

1305
01:06:15,272 --> 01:06:16,737
She's probably gone off
with one of her friends.

1306
01:06:16,737 --> 01:06:18,403
You know how young people are.

1307
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,353
- [Mrs. Delveccio] No.

1308
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:24,833
No, I am really worried about her.

1309
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:29,680
I thought that when things
started happening for her,

1310
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:34,680
the Larks and this
volunteer work, and boys,

1311
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,430
that she would somehow
find some happiness.

1312
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,643
- [Mr. Delveccio] Well you know,

1313
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,850
sometimes I think that
maybe she's ashamed.

1314
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:46,260
She never brings anybody home.

1315
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:49,691
The other kids all have so
much, and we don't have any-

1316
01:06:49,691 --> 01:06:50,880
- No, no.
- I mean, really.

1317
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:51,760
- [Mrs. Delveccio] Joe, really,

1318
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,593
we have everything that we need.

1319
01:06:55,730 --> 01:07:00,713
She, she has such big dreams.

1320
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,093
- [Mr. Delveccio] Well maybe
the party will bring her out.

1321
01:07:06,052 --> 01:07:10,140
(upbeat instrumental music)

1322
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:12,984
You're our real angel, Angela.

1323
01:07:12,984 --> 01:07:13,942
(all clapping)

1324
01:07:13,942 --> 01:07:15,097
- [Woman] Oh, very nice.

1325
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:18,083
- All right everyone,
come on, around the tree!

1326
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,340
Listen, you four have gone off,

1327
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,820
and you've found your places in the world.

1328
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:26,820
And before long Angela will be gone too.

1329
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,740
So I would like to begin our

1330
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:31,653
pre-Christmas celebration with a prayer.

1331
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:35,810
Thank you God for our family.

1332
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:39,680
For letting us have this time together.

1333
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,230
For the memories of Christmases past.

1334
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:45,570
Bless us and keep us in the days ahead.

1335
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:48,310
Secure in the certain knowledge

1336
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:52,410
that though we now lead scattered lives,

1337
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:56,793
we are never further from
each other than a prayer.

1338
01:07:57,930 --> 01:07:58,763
Amen.
- Amen.

1339
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:03,593
- All right everyone, it's time
to draw the names for gifts.

1340
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:05,823
Angela, you go first.

1341
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,800
Now remember there are two
weeks left to do your shopping,

1342
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,440
so please do not leave it to

1343
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:16,300
the last minute like you always do.

1344
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,940
I think everybody has to give
nice presents this year, okay?

1345
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:22,460
And I think just to be safe
we should say another prayer.

1346
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:23,293
Okay?

1347
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,523
Lord, sh.

1348
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,159
Please bless us and keep
us from cheapskates.

1349
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:32,469
(all laughing)

1350
01:08:32,469 --> 01:08:34,319
- Angela, smile!

1351
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,693
(upbeat orchestral music)

1352
01:08:37,693 --> 01:08:40,443
(all chattering)

1353
01:08:46,638 --> 01:08:47,805
Angela, smile.

1354
01:08:50,498 --> 01:08:51,915
Theresa, Theresa!

1355
01:08:54,509 --> 01:08:56,434
All right, now, ready?

1356
01:08:56,434 --> 01:08:59,184
(all chattering)

1357
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,590
Thank you, thank you honey,
thank you for coming.

1358
01:09:02,590 --> 01:09:03,423
Thanks, bye bye.

1359
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,783
Hey, you drive careful, you understand?

1360
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:08,973
Good night.

1361
01:09:10,231 --> 01:09:12,310
(laughs)

1362
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:13,143
Oh boy.

1363
01:09:16,558 --> 01:09:19,690
- (sighs) Well it was
really nice, wasn't it?

1364
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:20,650
Time to clean up.

1365
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:22,340
- Why don't you just leave those?

1366
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:23,173
I'm gonna come in and help you.

1367
01:09:23,173 --> 01:09:25,520
- Joe, relax.
- All right, all right.

1368
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,050
Your mother's right, it
was nice, huh? (laughs)

1369
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:30,590
Everybody here.

1370
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:31,423
- Daddy.
- Yes?

1371
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:34,692
- I have something to tell you.

1372
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:36,359
- What's the matter?

1373
01:09:40,431 --> 01:09:41,264
- Nothing.

1374
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:44,810
Just that I love you.

1375
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:47,643
- I love you too.

1376
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:54,431
(sighs)

1377
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,270
- Mom can we talk?

1378
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,120
- Why certainly, dear.

1379
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,840
Oh, I'm awfully tired.

1380
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,193
Would you mind if I get
ready for bed first?

1381
01:10:07,728 --> 01:10:09,895
- No, I understand.
- Good.

1382
01:10:15,994 --> 01:10:19,827
(peaceful instrumental music)

1383
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,430
- Oh Angela,

1384
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:24,710
I guess I didn't realize
how tired I was last night.

1385
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:25,560
I fell asleep.

1386
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:26,393
- It's okay.

1387
01:11:26,393 --> 01:11:27,640
- Can we have our talk now?

1388
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,690
- Um, no I'm late, I'm
getting a ride with Melanie,

1389
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:32,675
I wrote you a note instead.

1390
01:11:32,675 --> 01:11:34,683
(car horn honking)
- Just some juice?

1391
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,667
(timer ticking)

1392
01:12:32,316 --> 01:12:33,149
- Thanks.

1393
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,609
(timer ticking)

1394
01:12:48,609 --> 01:12:51,276
(alarm ringing)

1395
01:13:02,102 --> 01:13:05,150
(dramatic music)

1396
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:06,820
Dear Mom and Dad.

1397
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:08,490
I've been trying to tell you this,

1398
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,210
but I love you so much and it's so hard

1399
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:11,653
I'm taking the easy way out.

1400
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,160
I just can't be near you when you see this

1401
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,210
because I've already caused so much pain.

1402
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:20,990
The reason why I took so long on Fridays

1403
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,653
is because the FBI man Mr.
Gilwood thinks I did it.

1404
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,173
And he is right.

1405
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:34,030
I can't bring her back, but I'm so sorry.

1406
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:35,620
I would kill myself except maybe

1407
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,700
that would hurt you even more.

1408
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,230
I've been able to live
with it for a while,

1409
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:40,750
but I can't ignore it.

1410
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,300
It's too much for me and
I can't be that deceiving.

1411
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:47,060
I've spoken to a priest,
but I still can't take it.

1412
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:49,250
I need to turn myself in.

1413
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,383
With you, if you would come today.

1414
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:55,833
Please forgive me, I need you.

1415
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,300
I'm so sorry to have been a

1416
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,930
disappointment to you in every way.

1417
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:04,970
I'm even worse than words can
describe and I hate myself.

1418
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:05,803
I need your love.

1419
01:14:05,803 --> 01:14:08,340
Please still love me.

1420
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,413
I can't live unless you love me.

1421
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,401
I've ruined my life, and yours,

1422
01:14:14,401 --> 01:14:15,801
and I don't know what to do.

1423
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:19,150
I'm so ashamed and scared.

1424
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:19,983
I love you.

1425
01:14:21,019 --> 01:14:22,569
Angela.

1426
01:14:22,569 --> 01:14:25,788
- Joe!

1427
01:14:25,788 --> 01:14:26,621
Joseph!

1428
01:15:14,163 --> 01:15:14,996
Angela.

1429
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:20,339
- Don't hate me, Mom.

1430
01:15:20,339 --> 01:15:22,922
(both sobbing)

1431
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:38,920
- [Girl 1] Where's Delveccio?

1432
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,530
- [Girl 2] I don't know, sick I guess.

1433
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:42,070
- Yeah?

1434
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,020
I heard they arrested someone.

1435
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,390
I heard it was a Lark.

1436
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:46,560
- So?

1437
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,360
- All the other Larks are in school.

1438
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:56,215
(girl whispering)

1439
01:15:59,374 --> 01:16:00,283
- [Girl] It's Angela.

1440
01:16:04,656 --> 01:16:07,040
(all murmuring)

1441
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,770
- I told you it was Delveccio.

1442
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:10,900
I always did think she was weird.

1443
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:11,773
- Liar!

1444
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:14,493
You guys are all a bunch of liars.

1445
01:16:16,346 --> 01:16:18,883
You don't know anything about her.

1446
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,323
She's better than all you put together.

1447
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,815
(sobbing)

1448
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:36,343
- This is for all of us
a shocking time of grace.

1449
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:41,220
It is for us a time to
look deeply into our values

1450
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:43,550
and to examine our goals.

1451
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:45,800
We're a close-knit community.

1452
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,400
You either belong or you do not.

1453
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:53,527
As I agonize over the events
of the last six months,

1454
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:58,360
I wonder if Angela didn't feel

1455
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:01,460
the community's pressure to be the best,

1456
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:05,453
be the brightest, own the
finest and the most expensive.

1457
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,253
Felt these pressures and
judged herself a failure.

1458
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:16,730
I wonder if what we're seeing is not the

1459
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:21,730
attitudes of the parents being
visited upon the children.

1460
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:25,030
Now these are painful,

1461
01:17:25,030 --> 01:17:27,893
agonizing questions that must be asked.

1462
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:32,983
If we are to survive and
thrive as a community,

1463
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,550
I beg you to look deeply into

1464
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:40,940
your hearts and souls for the answer

1465
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,930
so that we may assure
ourselves and our children

1466
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:51,533
that no such adversity
will ever afflict us again.

1467
01:17:56,787 --> 01:17:59,454
(Jaime sobbing)

1468
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,860
- I left her alone at
the ski lodge, Father.

1469
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:12,063
She was my best friend
and I left her alone,

1470
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:16,600
because I didn't have the
courage to stand up to Stacy.

1471
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:19,193
- You must forgive yourself.

1472
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,080
And then find the courage
to be her friend now,

1473
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,253
when so many are arranged against her.

1474
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,797
- But they won't even let me see her.

1475
01:18:29,797 --> 01:18:31,683
- Be her friend in your heart.

1476
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:34,620
The rest will come.

1477
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,910
- As the trial approaches,

1478
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:38,040
there is talk of community responsibility

1479
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,840
in the death of Stacy Lockwood.

1480
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,610
Channel 5 spoke to Santa Mira

1481
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:44,540
principal Ed Saxe to pose that question.

1482
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,010
- We have heard a lot about the

1483
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:48,420
community role in this unfortunate affair.

1484
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:49,753
Well I reject that.

1485
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:54,627
Did anyone ever consider that
this is maybe just a sick kid?

1486
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:58,140
Believe me there is no
problem with materialism

1487
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,430
here at Santa Mira then
there is anyone else.

1488
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:01,880
- [Newscaster] The question remains.

1489
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:04,870
Is it Angela Delveccio who
goes on trial tomorrow,

1490
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:06,503
or the community of Santa Mira?

1491
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,120
- Mr. Quan, there is a
rumor that the defense

1492
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,510
has offered the DA's office a plea

1493
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:23,130
of second degree and it was rejected.

1494
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,870
Can you confirm or deny?

1495
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:27,060
- An offer was made and rejected.

1496
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:28,580
- [Reporter] Could you tell us why?

1497
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:30,380
- We feel we have a
first degree case here,

1498
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:31,970
and it deserves to go to trial.

1499
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,710
- But what's the point?

1500
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:34,600
- The point?

1501
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,970
- [Reporter] Isn't the
punishment the same,

1502
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:39,030
whether the verdict is first
degree or second degree murder?

1503
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:40,780
- The juvenile code dictates that the

1504
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:42,740
punishment for either time is confinement

1505
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,890
to the juvenile authority
until the age of 25.

1506
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:47,210
- Then why go to trial?

1507
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,607
- We are trying to serve
the community interest here,

1508
01:19:49,607 --> 01:19:51,053
and see justice done.

1509
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,173
With calculation and deliberation,

1510
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:29,060
Angela Delveccio lured Stacy Lockwood

1511
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:33,610
from the safety of her home
and drove her to a church.

1512
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:38,610
A church where she gave
Stacy one last chance.

1513
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:42,663
If she would be her friend,
Angela would let her live.

1514
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:49,010
But Stacy fled, and Angela
pursued her with one intent,

1515
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:50,890
and one intent only.

1516
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,973
To kill Stacy Lockwood.

1517
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:57,400
It is, Your Honor, a clear
case of premeditation

1518
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,210
and murder in the first degree.

1519
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:03,950
- The murder of Stacy Lockwood
was a crime of passion.

1520
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:06,640
Un-premeditated, disorganized.

1521
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,210
The spontaneous action of a
confused and desperate child

1522
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:12,650
who's only intention was
to invite Stacy to a party

1523
01:21:12,650 --> 01:21:14,550
and ask her to be her friend.

1524
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:17,840
It as as we will prove a clear case

1525
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,390
of murder in the second degree.

1526
01:21:27,368 --> 01:21:29,150
(all chattering)

1527
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:30,480
- [Girl] Look at her.

1528
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,103
She has got a lot of nerve.

1529
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,800
- What do you think you're doing here?

1530
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,050
This trial is for Stacy's friends!

1531
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:38,490
- This isn't a party, Meredith.

1532
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:40,323
And there aren't any invited guests.

1533
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:43,530
Jill has as much right
to be here as you do.

1534
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:58,090
(dramatic music)

1535
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:01,215
- [Angela] I thought she was going to

1536
01:22:01,215 --> 01:22:03,370
tell everyone at school
that I was really weird.

1537
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,623
I can't explain it, I don't understand it.

1538
01:22:14,961 --> 01:22:18,370
It was like, if I had
been thinking straight,

1539
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:19,720
it never would've happened.

1540
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:23,770
I guess I was really angry,

1541
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:25,063
and I really don't know.

1542
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:29,643
She was just telling me to go away.

1543
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:32,893
And I did it.

1544
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:38,390
It was exactly like I was watching it.

1545
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:42,443
You know how you see a dream,

1546
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:45,260
and then you see yourself doing things?

1547
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:49,100
And it was so much like a dream

1548
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,650
that I thought I would wake up.

1549
01:22:52,610 --> 01:22:54,413
- [Gilwood] How do you feel about her now?

1550
01:22:58,785 --> 01:23:03,785
- [Angela] I keep wishing that
I could push time backwards.

1551
01:23:03,919 --> 01:23:07,780
(Mrs. Delveccio sobbing)

1552
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:10,133
I sort of apologized to her in my mind.

1553
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:15,510
Like I think she's in heaven now.

1554
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,743
- [Gilwood] Do you think
it was partly her fault?

1555
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,210
- [Angela] I remember the
mean things about her,

1556
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:30,713
but I could never think
that it was her fault.

1557
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:38,200
I don't think there's
any reason in the world

1558
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,980
that justifies killing someone.

1559
01:23:42,256 --> 01:23:43,354
Mr. Gilwood?

1560
01:23:43,354 --> 01:23:44,687
- [Gilwood] Yes?

1561
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:47,823
- [Angela] Will the press get my name?

1562
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:52,213
- [Gilwood] We don't release
names in juvenile cases Angela.

1563
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:56,070
But it's possible they
could get it on their own.

1564
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,877
- [Angela] I don't see any
reason for living if everyone,

1565
01:24:00,877 --> 01:24:02,987
(Mrs. Delveccio sobbing)

1566
01:24:02,987 --> 01:24:04,437
I mean if people knew that...

1567
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:08,783
Could I use the restroom?

1568
01:24:08,783 --> 01:24:10,080
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1569
01:24:16,392 --> 01:24:17,942
- [Mrs. Delveccio] Sweet Jesus.

1570
01:24:20,163 --> 01:24:21,933
(Mrs. Delveccio sobbing)

1571
01:24:21,933 --> 01:24:24,210
- Why are they doing this to her?

1572
01:24:24,210 --> 01:24:25,390
- I don't know.

1573
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:27,530
She confessed, she
admitted she was guilty.

1574
01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:29,360
- It's like what Mr. Derning
was telling us about.

1575
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,210
New England, the Puritans
would sinners in pillories,

1576
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:34,490
so the townspeople could
come by and spit on them.

1577
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:35,860
- Yeah well I wonder if the Puritans

1578
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,290
got all dressed up for their spitting.

1579
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:40,618
- No family wants to see the courts

1580
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:43,350
hold a yardstick up to their loss.

1581
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:47,610
But the evidence, not the
evidence presented by the defense,

1582
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:51,290
but by the prosecution, is clear.

1583
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:54,370
There was no premeditation,
no calculation,

1584
01:24:54,370 --> 01:24:55,730
and there was no planning.

1585
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:58,480
And no possible verdict but
murder in the second degree.

1586
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:02,970
Angela herself, she could not
explain her irrational act.

1587
01:25:02,970 --> 01:25:06,307
Don't ask why, she had
said, "I don't know why."

1588
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:11,633
She, like all of us, wants to understand.

1589
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,023
Wants to know why.

1590
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,413
Though the answer will forever elude us.

1591
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,363
I suggest that we look to ourselves,

1592
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:27,230
we look to our community,
in our quest to understand.

1593
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:30,130
The pressures are intense here,

1594
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:33,133
nobody wants to be a
hod-carrier in Santa Mira.

1595
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:36,140
No.

1596
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:41,140
You're supposed to be beautiful
and successful and popular.

1597
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:45,023
Perfect.

1598
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:49,393
Now, Angela was none of these things,

1599
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:52,610
and her fear of failure eventually became

1600
01:25:52,610 --> 01:25:54,190
too much for her to handle.

1601
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:58,740
It was this fear of public humiliation

1602
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:01,240
that led her to kill in the first place.

1603
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,170
In this trial,

1604
01:26:02,170 --> 01:26:07,170
in this public airing of
painfully private emotions,

1605
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:12,310
we have submitted her
to the worst humiliation

1606
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:13,913
she could ever have imagined.

1607
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:17,960
I don't say this to excuse her crime,

1608
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,330
for a crime she did commit.

1609
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:22,220
But to point out that the community

1610
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:26,370
can be as unforgiving
and pitiless in public

1611
01:26:26,370 --> 01:26:28,263
as it sometimes is in private.

1612
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:33,210
For this is a trial that
need never had happened.

1613
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:36,640
This is a clear case of
murder in the second degree.

1614
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,970
And had the district attorney's office

1615
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:42,290
accepted that plea in the first place,

1616
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:45,380
we might all of us have a avoided the pain

1617
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:49,623
of publicly reenacting
this terrible tragedy.

1618
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:57,960
- You have been subjected to a scene

1619
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:01,163
of enormous pathos here.

1620
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:06,480
The pathetic tableau of Angela

1621
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:10,080
surrounded by her family as she

1622
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,163
listened to her own damning words.

1623
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:18,933
But what of the tears and the
grief of the Lockwood family?

1624
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,000
Tears they will shed
and grief they will feel

1625
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,500
for the rest of their lives.

1626
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,980
And so I ask you, Your Honor,

1627
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:32,980
to consider the plight of the
victim and not the victimizer,

1628
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:38,393
and to return a verdict
that suits the crime.

1629
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:43,683
A verdict of murder in the first degree.

1630
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:48,990
- With the exception
of the tape confession,

1631
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:50,943
this whole case is circumstantial.

1632
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,000
Considering the evidence presented here,

1633
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,720
I must conclude that the prosecution has

1634
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:01,130
failed to prove it's
contention of premeditation.

1635
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:02,980
The evidence supports nothing more than

1636
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:05,713
a finding of murder in the second degree.

1637
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:08,800
I must further observe,

1638
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,203
and we have a kind of "Alice
in Wonderland" situation here.

1639
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,590
The juvenile code dictates a sentence of

1640
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:18,320
confinement to the age of 25.

1641
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,823
The degree whether first
or second is irrelevant.

1642
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:24,840
And so I find myself wondering

1643
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,640
what we have accomplished here.

1644
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,080
I hope it was justice,

1645
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,140
though I fear it may have been

1646
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:34,203
nothing more than entertainment.

1647
01:28:38,369 --> 01:28:41,869
(upbeat orchestral music)

1648
01:28:57,225 --> 01:28:59,380
- [Boy] Hey, wait up.

1649
01:28:59,380 --> 01:29:00,880
- [Boy 2] Come on.

1650
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,013
- [Jaime VOICEOVER] Dear Angela.

1651
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:23,810
There have been some changes in my life,

1652
01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:25,510
and I want you to know about them.

1653
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:28,520
I've quit the Larks,

1654
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,620
and next year I'm quitting Santa Mira too.

1655
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:34,210
I'm going to back to Saint Joe's

1656
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:37,513
where you and I had so
many wonderful times.

1657
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:43,483
I'm going back, and yet I
know I can't really go back,

1658
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:48,933
anymore than you can, or any of us can.

1659
01:29:51,133 --> 01:29:55,033
We can only go forward, and
that's what I hope to do.

1660
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,610
And that's my hope for you,

1661
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,473
as we both struggle to understand.

1662
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:07,879
Yours always, Jaime Hall.

1663
01:30:07,879 --> 01:30:11,712
(brooding instrumental music)

1664
01:30:21,404 --> 01:30:24,154
(dramatic music)

1665
01:31:31,629 --> 01:31:34,046
(soft music)
