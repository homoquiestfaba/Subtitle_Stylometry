1
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:59,025
In the summer of 1965,
when I was 13..

2
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,360
...I thought I knew everything
about life and death.

3
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:06,265
Our parents died when we were little.

4
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:10,240
My brother, Wiley, and I lived way
out in the country with our meemaw.

5
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,739
We'd hardly ever been off the place...

6
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,574
...but we were happy.

7
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:15,712
Then one day...

8
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,176
...Aunt Lucille blew into town...

9
00:01:18,386 --> 00:01:20,320
...and nothing was ever the same.

10
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:24,480
He said, "Kiss my butt, Lucille.
You're not going anywhere. "

11
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:28,526
He said that I couldn't go,
that he would never give me a divorce.

12
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:32,894
He said he would come and find me,
and he would knock some sense into me.

13
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:38,201
All I'm asking is for you to look
after my kids for one lousy month.

14
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,170
You know, I've never asked you
for anything.

15
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:47,240
And I've been waiting my whole life
for this chance.

16
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:49,708
And now...

17
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:52,146
...I'm gonna take it.

18
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:54,711
Do you hear me?

19
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm gonna take it.

20
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:02,452
He said no...

21
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,224
...when he should've said yes.

22
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:08,663
Mama...

23
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:10,670
...I killed him.

24
00:02:12,874 --> 00:02:14,739
Cut his head off.

25
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,610
So when did you do it?

26
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:01,475
Last night.

27
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:03,476
I put rat poison in his coffee.

28
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:04,977
You must be crazy.

29
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,112
He said that it was the worst coffee
that I ever made.

30
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:12,417
And I offered to pour it out
and make fresh.

31
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,063
And he said no.
I was always wasting his damn money...

32
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,198
...and he just drank it right down.

33
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,293
You must be crazy, Aunt Lucille.

34
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:24,003
All I know is you only got
one life, Peejoe.

35
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:27,800
You can't sit around waiting
for your next life to start.

36
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:30,910
Not when you see your big chance
about to pass you by.

37
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,973
-But did you have to--?
-I had to make sure he was dead.

38
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,848
I shouldn't have told you
all this, Peejoe.

39
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:42,819
I don't want anybody to know
what I did or where I'm going.

40
00:04:43,024 --> 00:04:47,825
So you just forget all about it.
Just block it out of your mind. Okay?

41
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:53,089
Thattaboy.
I knew I could trust you.

42
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:55,861
You've always been
my special buddy, you know?

43
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,471
Aunt Lucille said the only good thing
Uncle Chester ever gave her...

44
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,404
... was her kids, all seven of them.

45
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,043
And now she meant to leave
them all here.

46
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:09,615
Poor old Meemaw, all in a tizzy,
running to call Uncle Dove...

47
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:12,786
...because he was used to dead people.
He'd know what to do.

48
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:17,083
Mama, there's nothing to do.
It's already been done.

49
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,258
Come here, babies.

50
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,053
Dove is the coroner.
He's got connections.

51
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,097
And maybe you won't
have to go to jail.

52
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,957
You can tell them--

53
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,761
You can tell them
it was self-defence, honey.

54
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,036
They won't even try to understand.
Come here, Nana. Don't be ridiculous.

55
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:36,074
They will put me in the electric chair
if they catch me.

56
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:40,077
But they're not gonna catch me.
I love you, my baby, so much.

57
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:44,273
Meemaw said Aunt Lucille's life
was one long dream of the movies...

58
00:05:44,485 --> 00:05:46,976
... with herself in all the best parts.

59
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:49,588
That was one reason
I was in love with her.

60
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,918
Honey, you really need
to see a doctor.

61
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,685
You try and get some rest, Mama.

62
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,797
Peejoe, remember?
You promised. Bye.

63
00:05:58,132 --> 00:05:59,429
I promised, all right.

64
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:02,228
But keeping her secrets
was the last thing on my mind.

65
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,768
I thought about what she did
with the knife...

66
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:07,167
... Uncle Chester gave her
for Christmas.

67
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,240
I felt all cold inside...

68
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,105
... like I'd jumped into
a swimming pool full of boiling water.

69
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:16,283
I couldn't believe this was the
Aunt Lucille who used to rock me...

70
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:18,281
...hold me and sing me to sleep.

71
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,151
We'd heard about mean old Uncle
Chester as long as I could remember.

72
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:25,154
One minute she was married to him...

73
00:06:25,793 --> 00:06:29,285
...and then the next minute,
she was gone with his head.

74
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:35,001
Uncle Dove!

75
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:37,704
Peter Joseph.

76
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,336
Come here.

77
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:43,001
What you doing out here
by yourself?

78
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,044
They were all crying and stuff
in there. I couldn't stand it.

79
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,748
Where's Lucille?

80
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:50,711
Gone.

81
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:54,116
What'd she do with Chester?

82
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,652
I don't know.
She said she hid him somewhere.

83
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:00,223
Well, hell, that was thoughtful.

84
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:05,528
Listen, son.

85
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:11,865
I may need your help.

86
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:15,073
You and Wiley.
You wanna go with me?

87
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,773
-I never been anywhere before.
-Well, it's about time, then.

88
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:21,478
What do you say?

89
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,152
I don't know. Meemaw needs us.

90
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:27,947
I'm sorry, sweet pea.
I should've told you.

91
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:30,055
Y'all gonna go stay with Dove now.

92
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,691
-But for how long?
-I don't know.

93
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,060
It's all just been too much
for me right now.

94
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,235
And her young'uns need me
worse than you do.

95
00:07:47,408 --> 00:07:49,205
You said we could always stay here.

96
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,002
Quiet! Don't be contrary.
This has been a hard day.

97
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:59,753
Don't worry, Mama.
He'll be all right.

98
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:04,482
Dove...

99
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:07,350
...Lucille didn't mean to do
what she did.

100
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:08,892
She's just....

101
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:10,859
Lord, I don't know.

102
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:12,895
She's a good girl.

103
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,761
She's just...

104
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:16,800
...confused.

105
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:20,267
Well, if she calls,
tell her to stay where she is.

106
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:21,941
I'll come get her.

107
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:23,901
Oh, Mama.

108
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:27,709
Try to get some rest.
You look tired.

109
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:33,451
She say who she's gonna see
out there in California?

110
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:35,281
That agent fella?

111
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,621
I don't want them to catch her,
Uncle Dove.

112
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:44,263
It's awful what she did,
but it won't make it...

113
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:46,956
...better if they put her
in the electric chair.

114
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,261
Maybe that won't happen...

115
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:53,029
...if we can bring her back
before she does anything else.

116
00:08:57,611 --> 00:08:59,670
His name was Harry Hall.

117
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:03,680
Now, Uncle Dove?

118
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:05,215
Let it rip.

119
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:21,992
Wiley thought it was the coolest thing
in the world to ride in a hearse...

120
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:24,501
...as long as you were riding
up front.

121
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:27,998
But for the first time,
I felt like an orphan...

122
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:29,938
... with a capital "O"

123
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:31,906
I counted for nothing.

124
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,507
I belonged to nobody.

125
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:46,091
There's no need for this circus, John.

126
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:48,358
She did it.

127
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,525
I told you she did it.

128
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,895
Chester Vinson is a mean man.

129
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:56,733
Anybody deserved killing....

130
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,837
You know my boys never get
any action around here.

131
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,473
This is first-degree murder.
This is big.

132
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:07,044
We've known each other
since we were yea high.

133
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:10,684
You gotta help me out here.
We're talking about my sister.

134
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:13,682
She's out of her mind.
She doesn't know what she's doing.

135
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,316
Which boy did she talk to?

136
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:20,285
Peter Joseph, shake hands
with Sheriff Doggett.

137
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:26,199
He's a material witness.
I'll wanna talk to him.

138
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,628
He'll be with me.

139
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,702
If y'all know where she's headed,
you tell me now.

140
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,401
I'll try and bring her in safe.

141
00:10:34,608 --> 00:10:37,805
I have no idea.
I just came by to pick up his body.

142
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:40,343
We searched every inch.
He ain't here.

143
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,072
You check the basement?

144
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:45,051
The basement.

145
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:47,911
Don't come down here.

146
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:57,653
Come on. Come on.

147
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:15,713
Jesus!

148
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,928
Where's his head?

149
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:31,460
He ain't got one.

150
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,794
Oh, baby sister.

151
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:36,401
What have you done?

152
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,532
I give my wife one just like it
for Christmas.

153
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:40,762
Oh, my God!

154
00:11:40,975 --> 00:11:45,435
An all-points bulletin
for a 1964 Ford Galaxy sedan.

155
00:11:45,646 --> 00:11:49,138
Bright red. Suspect's name
is Lucille Vinson...

156
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,783
...age 34.

157
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:54,113
Aunt Lucille told me she stayed up
the whole night packing.

158
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:57,448
I was the only one that knew
who it was she packed up...

159
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,818
... in a plastic freezer container...

160
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,186
... in a brown paper bag...

161
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,886
... on the back seat of her car.

162
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:06,032
Lucille.

163
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:07,928
Chester?

164
00:12:08,836 --> 00:12:09,928
Lucille.

165
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,487
What do they want?

166
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:05,480
They wanna register to vote.
That's their latest thing.

167
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:07,626
Why don't they let them?

168
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,059
Negroes aren't allowed.
Not in Alabama. You know that.

169
00:13:11,598 --> 00:13:12,724
Yeah, I know it.

170
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:16,369
It just don't seem fair.
They're just people like us.

171
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,274
You're right. It's not fair.
It's just the way things are.

172
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:28,574
I reckon Aunt Lucille had
more than one chance...

173
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:30,443
... to lighten her load.

174
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,542
It's not deep enough.

175
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,782
But I guess after 13 years
of being married...

176
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,048
... it's kind of hard to let it go.

177
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:01,274
Whoa! Look it!

178
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:03,682
What do you think?

179
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:07,414
It's so creepy.

180
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,858
I can't believe this is your house.

181
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,496
It belongs to the funeral company.
We just live here.

182
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:23,592
If you died in Industry,
and you were white...

183
00:14:23,804 --> 00:14:26,102
... Croaker-Moseley Funeral Home
was where you'd come...

184
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,240
...before you went
to your final rest.

185
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:32,934
So many ghosts had been through
this house, you could smell them.

186
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,941
Uncle Dove said being
a funeral director...

187
00:14:39,153 --> 00:14:41,485
... wasn't quite as much fun
as it looked.

188
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:44,657
Hours were long, and you didn't
see people at their best.

189
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,086
Well, this is where we live.

190
00:14:47,694 --> 00:14:49,787
You all have the run of the attic.

191
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:52,257
Dove? Dove, is that you?

192
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:57,026
No, Earlene, it's the milkman.
Are you decent? The boys are here.

193
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:01,805
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

194
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:06,938
You poor darlings. I can't even
imagine what you've been through.

195
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:10,514
Get dressed!

196
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:13,185
Aunt Earlene had a firm grip.

197
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,548
We liked her because
she introduced us to Pop-Tarts...

198
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,452
...Kool-Aid, Chef Boyardee.

199
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,256
Also, she had a voice you could hear
half a block away.

200
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:29,261
But what can I tell you? Chester was
just a perfectly dreadful man.

201
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,906
I can't remember a single moment
when he didn't get on my nerves.

202
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,970
Oh, and Dove...

203
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:36,231
...don't ever push me too far.

204
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:01,559
Let's go shopping.

205
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:11,635
My name is Carolyn Clay,
and I need a hat.

206
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,575
I mean, I need a hatbox.
I mean, I need a hat.

207
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,943
Remember that movie
with Audrey Hepburn?

208
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,017
I think it was at Tiffany's.

209
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,585
The one with the floppy brim.
Something like that.

210
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,486
And a real nice hatbox.

211
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:29,127
We only offer the boxes
for the couture line.

212
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,158
Show me those, then,
because I have to have the box.

213
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,062
Care to leave your groceries here
while we're looking?

214
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:42,064
Five hundred dollars.

215
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:45,576
It's perfect.

216
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:46,973
I'll take it.

217
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,789
You little slut.

218
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,900
Waste my damn money on a hat.

219
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:12,567
Tell me what you got in the box.

220
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:33,652
A present for you!

221
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,612
-What do you need?
-What are they having?

222
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:04,085
Hurricanes.

223
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,316
Sounds good.
Give me one of those.

224
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:07,887
Two-fifty.

225
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:10,386
You're not local, are you?

226
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,265
No, just passing through.

227
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,992
Better keep on moving.
You can't work in here.

228
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,401
I'm not looking for a job.

229
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,139
I'm an actress.

230
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,535
Yeah, right.
And I'm Fred Astaire.

231
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:25,678
Here. Take your money,
drink your drink...

232
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:29,076
...and walk on over to Esplanade
with all the other whores.

233
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:37,219
You heard what I said, sugar.

234
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,824
Wait, wait!

235
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:42,359
Don't move.

236
00:18:42,562 --> 00:18:44,689
How dare you insult me?

237
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:48,129
Do you realize that this hat
cost $500?

238
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,735
-It's a misunderstanding.
-Is that your car?

239
00:18:50,937 --> 00:18:52,700
I'll take you, just don't take my car.

240
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:55,568
Put your keys on the bar,
and give me all your money.

241
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:56,606
Do it now!

242
00:18:59,479 --> 00:19:00,946
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

243
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:02,911
What did you put in her drink?

244
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,242
Don't you talk to me!

245
00:19:04,451 --> 00:19:05,543
Come on! Come on!

246
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:07,247
Quick, I gotta go.

247
00:19:07,454 --> 00:19:11,390
You need to learn the difference
between a whore and a lady.

248
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:12,523
Don't take my car.

249
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:20,926
She's taking my car!

250
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,948
I keep seeing his eyes.
He's looking at me.

251
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,208
Who?

252
00:19:40,454 --> 00:19:41,887
Uncle Chester.

253
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:44,246
Stop thinking about him.

254
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,954
It gives me the willies.

255
00:19:48,462 --> 00:19:50,293
What'd she do to you, anyways?

256
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,691
You've been weird ever since she left.

257
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,127
Nothing.

258
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,636
Come on, Peejoe. Don't lie to me.

259
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,635
It was just a bunch of crazy stuff.
She made me swear not to tell.

260
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,914
She always looked after us
special, Wiley.

261
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,685
We gotta protect her
from that sheriff. He's mean.

262
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:16,418
You better not get us in trouble.

263
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:19,820
We get kicked out of here,
and we got no place to go.

264
00:20:21,728 --> 00:20:25,664
She knew what she was doing.
She planned it out, Wiley.

265
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:28,826
She's not as crazy
as she wants everybody to think.

266
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,094
She seems pretty wacko to me.

267
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:34,432
-Funny. Listen to me.
-Still not deep enough.

268
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:37,701
I told you I'd come
knock some sense into you.

269
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:40,778
Chester, if that's really you,
leave me the hell alone.

270
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:44,473
Murder, armed robbery,
grand-theft auto. You lost your mind.

271
00:20:44,684 --> 00:20:47,278
Want me to stop this car
and kill you again?

272
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,287
-God, you just keep pushing!
-How're you gonna kill me again?

273
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,954
Just one more thing.

274
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:58,290
She say how she killed him?

275
00:20:58,999 --> 00:20:59,829
No, sir.

276
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:05,599
She pulled a .45 on a bartender
in New Orleans and stole his car.

277
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,468
That's ridiculous.
Baby sister wouldn't do that.

278
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:10,173
I beg to differ.

279
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:13,039
Your baby sister's
one bad little girl.

280
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:15,412
I'm gonna bring her in...

281
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,548
...one way or another.

282
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,342
And you're gonna help me.

283
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:22,048
She gonna call you...

284
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,151
...and you gonna say
just exactly what it takes.

285
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,388
Go.

286
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:38,903
I'll let you know what I hear.

287
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:45,905
-Can they put me in jail for lying?
-Not unless you're under oath.

288
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:50,048
Why don't y'all go down to
the pool for a while? Have some fun.

289
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,511
We've all had enough of this mess.

290
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,416
-You think she stole a car?
-Absolutely.

291
00:21:55,622 --> 00:21:58,022
If baby sister needed a car,
she'd get one.

292
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:02,758
I bet she's having the time
of her life off there by herself.

293
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:04,795
I hope she is.

294
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:07,130
I hope she's living it up.

295
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,137
Because if she does get caught,
that's when the fun stops.

296
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:12,021
Hey, I know you.

297
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:14,993
Weren't you marching
at the courthouse yesterday?

298
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,695
So what if I was?

299
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:22,100
I just saw you, that's all.
I ain't gonna tell anybody.

300
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,278
You better leave me alone.

301
00:23:26,713 --> 00:23:29,011
-Get out of the pool.
-Where's everybody going?

302
00:23:29,516 --> 00:23:30,448
Just get out.

303
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,208
Come on out of there.

304
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:37,288
Who let you boys in the pool?

305
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,481
Nobody.
We just came in back yonder.

306
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:42,161
You snuck in, is what you did.
Come on out.

307
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:44,421
-We wanna swim. That's all.
-Go on home.

308
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:47,163
It's white only allowed in this pool.

309
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:51,162
Excuse me. This is a public place.
We have a right to be here.

310
00:23:51,371 --> 00:23:52,463
Right.

311
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:54,706
Come on, let's go.

312
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,573
-I'm going over there.
-No, stay here.

313
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:05,475
Go on home, now!
Y'all just run along!

314
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:07,412
-Pikcaninny!
-Go swim in the pond!

315
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:09,247
No coloured people.

316
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:12,323
-Go swim somewhere else.
-I'll kick your butt.

317
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,622
-Y'all know you don't belong here.
-Go swim in the pond!

318
00:24:39,386 --> 00:24:40,785
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

319
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:42,249
Where you headed, hon?

320
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:43,979
California.

321
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:46,415
You going out there
to be a movie star?

322
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:47,718
How could you tell?

323
00:24:47,927 --> 00:24:50,589
We get about one through here a week.

324
00:24:50,797 --> 00:24:53,391
Bet you've already got
your movie name picked out.

325
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,034
I sure do. It's Carolyn Clay.

326
00:24:56,236 --> 00:24:59,797
Kind of like Marilyn Monroe,
only different. You like it?

327
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:03,166
It's all right. But,
honey, my advice to you:

328
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,708
Go back to the husband.

329
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,839
It's too late for that.
He's dead.

330
00:25:09,616 --> 00:25:12,710
Well, I hope you know
how to wait tables, then.

331
00:25:28,034 --> 00:25:30,901
How did he die? I mean,
if you don't mind me asking.

332
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:32,401
I killed him.

333
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:35,531
Well.

334
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,173
I guess that fixed
his little red wagon.

335
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,715
He's following me, though.
I mean, not him, his ghost.

336
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,476
Only it don't sound like a ghost.
It sounds just like him.

337
00:25:46,052 --> 00:25:47,349
Are you sure he's dead?

338
00:25:47,554 --> 00:25:48,987
I made sure of that.

339
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,859
Do you ever need to get rid of
somebody that just would not go away?

340
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:56,828
My first husband.

341
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:01,660
He used to yell out his mother's name
when we were doing it, making love.

342
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:04,502
The only thing Chester ever yelled
was "touchdown."

343
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,336
It's a warm day
here in Cotton County.

344
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:11,408
Expecting a high temperature of 96,
with a chance...

345
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,010
... of thunderstorms.

346
00:26:13,346 --> 00:26:15,337
They just want to swim.

347
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:18,818
You heard what Uncle Dove said.
It's not fair.

348
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:21,248
It's just the way things are.

349
00:26:23,523 --> 00:26:26,617
What if you wanted to swim
and they threw you out like that?

350
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:29,454
Oh, forget it. Go get wet.

351
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,099
Jim!

352
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:51,549
John.

353
00:26:57,857 --> 00:27:00,849
You get out of there right now.
Come on!

354
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,051
What in the world do they think
they'll do?

355
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:18,076
Hold on.

356
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,912
You boys don't want any trouble.

357
00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:24,782
We don't want trouble, sir.
We just wanna swim.

358
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:28,943
-What's your name, son?
-Taylor Jackson.

359
00:27:29,322 --> 00:27:30,516
Well, Taylor...

360
00:27:30,723 --> 00:27:33,123
...this pool is for white only.

361
00:27:33,593 --> 00:27:35,356
Y'all gonna have to move on.

362
00:27:36,362 --> 00:27:39,092
We'll just sit right here
till you change your mind.

363
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,597
-We're going home now.
-You go.

364
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:46,863
You come home with me right now
or I'm getting Dove.

365
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:54,940
Just thank God he's not a religious
fanatic. That's a pain in the butt.

366
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:58,544
My third husband, Charlie,
when he'd get--

367
00:27:59,118 --> 00:27:59,948
Howdy, Raymond!

368
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,518
Good morning, Sally.

369
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,211
-How you doing?
-Good.

370
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:05,823
Hon, it's getting kind of late.

371
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,391
Don't you wanna get back
on the road now?

372
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:11,257
No, I got it, hon. It is my treat.

373
00:28:11,664 --> 00:28:14,599
-Thank you.
-Now good luck to you out there.

374
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:17,564
-You've got a real talent.
-Thank you.

375
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,601
I like your style.

376
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,743
-How you doing, there?
-Fine, thanks. Yourself?

377
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:27,935
Real good.

378
00:28:28,147 --> 00:28:30,775
-Think I'll try a number two today.
-You got it.

379
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:37,713
Well, well, well.

380
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,357
Look what we got here.

381
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,492
Y'all are trespassing
on public property.

382
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:46,892
Get up and go home.

383
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,260
This is a sit-in.

384
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,871
-What was that?
-This is a sit-in.

385
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,141
Yeah. I know what this is.

386
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:59,803
Now you boys get up
and disperse from here...

387
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,973
...or I'm gonna have to disperse you.

388
00:29:03,182 --> 00:29:04,672
Go ahead and arrest us.

389
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:06,650
Oh, no.

390
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:12,051
I'm not gonna mess up my nice
clean jail with the likes of you.

391
00:29:14,661 --> 00:29:16,151
We got a right to be here.

392
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:26,261
Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you.

393
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:32,704
You got no rights in my town, boy.

394
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:34,573
You hear me?
Get him out of here!

395
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,872
Get back there!

396
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:38,550
You ain't nothing but a big old bully!

397
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:52,389
Run, David, run!

398
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,055
You're gonna need a stretcher.

399
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:01,763
This one's hurt.

400
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:04,300
What happened?

401
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:06,430
He fell.

402
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:09,106
He ain't hurt, John.

403
00:31:09,876 --> 00:31:11,036
He's dead.

404
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:13,305
I never touched him.

405
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:16,004
He fell. It was an accident.

406
00:31:18,718 --> 00:31:20,481
Like that boy accidentally...

407
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:23,447
...went off the Pigeon Creek Bridge
last spring.

408
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,615
And one accidentally
hung himself in your jail.

409
00:31:26,826 --> 00:31:28,487
Watch yourself, Dove.

410
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:32,723
All right.

411
00:31:33,065 --> 00:31:35,966
Let me take him, son.
I'll bring him home.

412
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:39,270
I didn't start this thing.

413
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:41,997
These boys came here looking
for trouble.

414
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:44,633
Well, they found it, didn't they?

415
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:48,674
Do you know who this boy is?

416
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,084
This is Nehemiah Jackson's boy.

417
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:54,951
Do you want me to twiddle my thumbs...

418
00:31:55,154 --> 00:31:57,281
...till this town explodes like Selma?

419
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,517
I mean to stop it, if I have to put
every last nigger in jail!

420
00:32:03,262 --> 00:32:05,526
Just don't kill any more
of them, okay?

421
00:32:06,699 --> 00:32:09,133
I am sick of cleaning up after you.

422
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,936
Uncle Dove and Nehemiah Jackson
were friends.

423
00:32:19,345 --> 00:32:21,438
They were both
in the funeral business.

424
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:24,309
They helped each other out
from time to time.

425
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:26,678
Just 17 years old.

426
00:32:29,522 --> 00:32:32,184
He was supposed to start
Tuskegee in the fall.

427
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:34,723
I wish I knew what to say, Nehemiah.

428
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:37,829
The day he was born....

429
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:41,064
Just so little.

430
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:45,101
Those little hands.

431
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:51,039
It rained so hard that day.

432
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:56,137
Just pouring.

433
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:02,380
You could stop the sheriff
if you tried.

434
00:33:02,588 --> 00:33:04,453
You don't know he's responsible.

435
00:33:04,657 --> 00:33:07,353
-No one saw what happened.
-I saw.

436
00:33:10,229 --> 00:33:11,719
He didn't fall.

437
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,433
Sheriff pulled him off the fence.

438
00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:19,394
You saw it?

439
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:22,499
Taylor was trying to get away.

440
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:24,740
He jumped on the fence.

441
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:27,741
The sheriff grabbed him
by the back of the shirt.

442
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:39,825
My boy.

443
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:43,251
My boy.

444
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:21,724
-Croaker-Moseley.
-Peejoe.

445
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:23,826
Aunt Lucille, where are you?

446
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,231
Florida. Hear the ocean?

447
00:34:27,473 --> 00:34:29,703
I thought you were going to Hollywood.

448
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,005
You didn't tell them Harry's name,
did you? The man I was going to see?

449
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,714
Dove's been calling out there
looking for me.

450
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:39,247
Not really. I mean....

451
00:34:39,585 --> 00:34:41,382
Well, sort of.

452
00:34:41,587 --> 00:34:43,452
Oh, Peejoe, you promised.

453
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:46,022
Well, I only told Uncle Dove, I swear.

454
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:48,249
And I didn't tell him about the....

455
00:34:48,794 --> 00:34:51,763
The sheriff asked me a bunch of stuff,
and I didn't say nothing.

456
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:54,831
You just tell Dove to quit calling
out there, okay?

457
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:58,197
Tell him I changed my mind,
that California's way too risky.

458
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:01,133
And have you talked to Meemaw?
How are my babies?

459
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,140
I keep calling out there, but that
damn party line's always busy.

460
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:09,280
She called Sunday. They're all right.
Cary's tooth fell out.

461
00:35:09,515 --> 00:35:11,210
Is he okay?

462
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,714
She just said he looks real funny.

463
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,422
Hey, do you happen to know how
your slingshot wound up in my car?

464
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:21,252
I thought you might need
some protection.

465
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:25,754
You are just about
the sweetest boy that I know.

466
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,691
Aunt Lucille, are you okay?

467
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:32,466
I'm fine, Peejoe. I'm free.

468
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:36,036
For the first time
in my entire life, I'm free.

469
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,668
I gotta run.
I'll call you later.

470
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:41,972
You stay by the phone. Bye.

471
00:35:42,214 --> 00:35:43,238
I'm coming.

472
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,378
Uncle Dove!

473
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:53,948
I don't care what you say.
Your vehicle is on my list...

474
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,391
...and that means you gotta
stay here until I check it out.

475
00:35:57,596 --> 00:36:01,123
But I told you. It's my
boyfriend's car. I didn't steal it.

476
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:04,061
You see, we had a big fight...

477
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,761
...and I told him
that the least he could do...

478
00:36:06,972 --> 00:36:10,567
...would be to give me his car
after the hell he put me through.

479
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,310
You can't imagine what he did to me.

480
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,681
Will you just do what I say
and step inside, Lucille?

481
00:36:17,883 --> 00:36:19,510
I can't go back there.

482
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,677
Let me fix this for you.

483
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:23,445
There, Raymond.

484
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:25,954
You see, he's a bartender...

485
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:27,921
...and, well, he drinks.

486
00:36:28,127 --> 00:36:30,721
And when he gets drunk
and he comes home...

487
00:36:31,464 --> 00:36:34,092
...and he makes me do things.

488
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:36,401
Just awful things.

489
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:39,100
What kind of things?

490
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:40,863
Well, I can't tell you.

491
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:44,304
I can't even say those words.

492
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:49,210
I couldn't, not to a big old lawman
like yourself.

493
00:36:50,116 --> 00:36:52,084
It's okay. You can tell me.

494
00:36:56,122 --> 00:36:58,022
A little lawn mower trouble?

495
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,330
What'd she do with his head?

496
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,963
-How should I know?
-You know a hell of a lot.

497
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,962
I'm gonna catch her.

498
00:37:13,672 --> 00:37:14,934
You're gonna help me.

499
00:37:16,008 --> 00:37:17,805
You can't make me.

500
00:37:18,043 --> 00:37:20,204
I know about you.
I saw what you did.

501
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:23,275
What'd I do?

502
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,474
You killed Taylor Jackson.

503
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:28,649
You pulled him off that fence.

504
00:37:29,054 --> 00:37:30,146
You meant to do it.

505
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,684
Who else you tell that to?

506
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:37,184
Nobody.

507
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:40,988
Not yet. But you better
leave her alone, or I'm telling.

508
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:49,740
Well, you just go on and tell,
junior boy.

509
00:37:50,776 --> 00:37:55,008
And then you tell Dove that I got
eyes and ears in this town...

510
00:37:55,214 --> 00:37:59,742
...and I know all about his flirtation
with the Justice Department.

511
00:38:00,386 --> 00:38:02,445
But I ain't scared...

512
00:38:02,755 --> 00:38:06,191
...because I mean to catch
that murdering sister of his...

513
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:08,383
...and I'm gonna bring her
back here...

514
00:38:08,594 --> 00:38:12,360
...and I'm gonna watch her fry
till her lips sizzle...

515
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:14,890
...and her eyeballs...

516
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:16,866
...pop out.

517
00:38:19,205 --> 00:38:21,070
-That is perfect.
-You mean that?

518
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:24,037
That is so good,
I can't hardly stand it.

519
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:25,568
So sexy.

520
00:38:25,778 --> 00:38:28,474
So handsome and so tall.

521
00:38:28,714 --> 00:38:29,942
So big and....

522
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:31,844
You're just a vision, angel.

523
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:33,643
Oh, yeah, kiss me there.

524
00:38:33,886 --> 00:38:36,286
-You like that?
-A little more.

525
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:37,887
Oh, that's so good.

526
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,921
Oh, so good.

527
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:41,384
All right.

528
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:46,120
I think I better take yours too.

529
00:38:46,332 --> 00:38:47,959
Okay, now listen.

530
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:50,635
Grab your handcuffs.
Do it fast. Come on.

531
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:52,929
-Are you serious?
-Put it on your wrist.

532
00:38:53,138 --> 00:38:55,163
-Oh, baby.
-Don't say anything.

533
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:57,841
Now hook it to right there.
Go ahead.

534
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:00,312
You're so nice, Raymond.

535
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:02,412
Do you realize how stupid you are?

536
00:39:02,615 --> 00:39:05,743
You know how much trouble
you can get in for this?

537
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:07,416
You know what?

538
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,248
This is the least of my troubles.
Really.

539
00:39:10,456 --> 00:39:11,889
Bye. Gotta go.

540
00:39:14,927 --> 00:39:16,292
I got your keys.

541
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,660
What'd he mean about
the Justice Department?

542
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,699
There's some people I've been
talking to the last couple days.

543
00:39:58,003 --> 00:39:59,834
I mean, how to stop him.

544
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:03,004
They're putting together a grand jury.

545
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:06,133
I'd like to know how the hell
he heard about it.

546
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:11,347
He said Aunt Lucille's gonna fry
till her eyeballs pop out.

547
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,341
I don't like him talking
to you like that.

548
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:16,919
He's not man enough to talk to me.

549
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:20,319
He didn't scare me.
I told him to leave us alone.

550
00:40:20,826 --> 00:40:22,953
Lord, you are something fearless.

551
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,226
You can believe you take after
your Aunt Lucille.

552
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,326
Dear Peejoe.:

553
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:33,733
You wouldn't believe what a wonderful
time I'm having in Las Vegas.

554
00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:36,533
It is a beautiful place,
let me tell you.

555
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:39,939
A hundred million light bulbs
in the middle of nowhere.

556
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:43,979
You drive up in your car,
and this nice man comes out and says.:

557
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:45,241
Evening, ma'am.

558
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:46,879
Checking in?

559
00:40:49,021 --> 00:40:51,546
Whoa! It's heavy.
What's in here, bricks?

560
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:54,089
My husband's head.
I take it everywhere.

561
00:40:54,526 --> 00:40:57,518
-Just his head, huh?
-I left the rest of him at home.

562
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:58,929
Right.

563
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,858
And he carries your bags
right inside for you.

564
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:06,560
There's no extra charge
for this service.

565
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:09,707
Inside, they have all kinds
of smart little shops.

566
00:41:09,908 --> 00:41:13,810
And I'm the kind of girl who can
resist anything but temptation.

567
00:41:14,046 --> 00:41:16,412
And that's how I found myself
in the casino.

568
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:25,614
I don't know much about gambling...

569
00:41:25,824 --> 00:41:29,021
...but sometimes in your life,
that's just what you have to do.

570
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:31,560
You put everything you have
on one number.

571
00:41:31,764 --> 00:41:34,198
Turns out my favourite game
is roulette.

572
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,662
It's so easy.

573
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:38,836
You put down your money
and watch this ball go around...

574
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,198
...and sometimes....

575
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,041
Oh, my God! I won! I won!

576
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:48,045
-$32,400.
-Thank you.

577
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:50,772
I can't begin to tell you
how nice everyone is.

578
00:41:51,283 --> 00:41:53,274
When you win,
they give you a free room.

579
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:56,386
And the same nice man
comes to help you find it.

580
00:42:03,462 --> 00:42:07,125
Anyway, I can't tell you about
all the adventures I'm having...

581
00:42:07,332 --> 00:42:10,597
...but I love you.
Gotta go. Talk to you soon.

582
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:13,135
Hugs and kisses, Aunt Lucille.

583
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:40,120
Daggone it!

584
00:43:06,091 --> 00:43:07,888
A white boy's been shot.

585
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:10,653
It's not safe to bury Taylor tomorrow.

586
00:43:10,863 --> 00:43:13,525
Tell everybody to keep
their head down and stay off--

587
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:14,993
Is the boy dead?

588
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,361
Nobody knows.

589
00:43:23,342 --> 00:43:27,403
Of course I hadn't been shot.
It was only that stupid lawn mower.

590
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,679
But nobody cared about the truth.

591
00:43:29,882 --> 00:43:32,043
People were so jumpy around town.

592
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:35,345
The story grew fast as a weed
in the summer down there.

593
00:43:35,554 --> 00:43:38,455
It was just the kind of thing
people wanted to believe.

594
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:50,958
Baby sister?

595
00:43:51,436 --> 00:43:53,904
She was probably gonna tell me
she was off to...

596
00:43:54,106 --> 00:43:56,040
... Wyoming or Alaska or somewhere.

597
00:43:56,341 --> 00:44:00,801
But really she was getting all dolled
up for her big trip to Hollywood...

598
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,537
... where dreams come true...

599
00:44:03,248 --> 00:44:06,342
... where the clock is always ticking
closer to midnight.

600
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:15,292
Your driver awaits.

601
00:44:16,595 --> 00:44:18,119
You must be Norman.

602
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,764
-How'd you know my name?
-Gotcha!

603
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:38,644
Where are we headed, Miss Clay?

604
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:41,717
Hollywood, California!
And don't you slow down...

605
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,444
... till we get there.

606
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,155
Hollywood!

607
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,026
You a movie star or something?

608
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:52,355
I will be. Just give me a week.

609
00:44:52,931 --> 00:44:56,230
You're more beautiful than any one
of them movie stars.

610
00:44:56,435 --> 00:44:59,097
We are gonna get along just fine.

611
00:45:01,707 --> 00:45:03,607
You don't look all that bad.

612
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:05,599
Yeah, sure.

613
00:45:06,044 --> 00:45:07,238
The one-eyed monster.

614
00:45:09,448 --> 00:45:13,179
Don't ever scare me like that, okay?
We all thought you were dead.

615
00:45:14,186 --> 00:45:15,517
Neat-o.

616
00:45:19,291 --> 00:45:23,125
They're finally gonna bury
Taylor Jackson today.

617
00:45:26,031 --> 00:45:27,362
Well, then...

618
00:45:28,066 --> 00:45:29,624
...we have to go.

619
00:45:30,535 --> 00:45:34,232
You're crazy. We're not even
supposed to go downstairs yet.

620
00:45:34,473 --> 00:45:35,701
Dove would kill us.

621
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,301
Well, you don't have to go...

622
00:45:38,977 --> 00:45:40,308
...but I do.

623
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,241
I watched him die.

624
00:45:49,087 --> 00:45:51,521
Would you look
at Miss High and Mighty...

625
00:45:51,723 --> 00:45:53,850
...riding in her limousine?

626
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:55,492
Here we go again.

627
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:57,786
Well, now, let's see,
you won...

628
00:45:57,996 --> 00:46:01,727
...a bunch of money and got
a bellboy to ring your chimes.

629
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:03,798
You running for Queen of the World?

630
00:46:04,002 --> 00:46:06,061
You wanna know something wonderful?

631
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:09,502
The world is full of men
who are nothing like you.

632
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:11,505
Did you say something, Miss Clay?

633
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,007
Not me.

634
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:36,623
I guess Taylor Jackson was
a pretty important guy.

635
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,033
Friends, the other day,
my boy, Taylor...

636
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,401
-... came to this pool...
-Go home, nigger!

637
00:47:17,609 --> 00:47:21,409
...and he sat down
on that pavement yonder...

638
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:23,981
...and they killed him for that.

639
00:47:24,182 --> 00:47:26,150
We buried him in the ground today.

640
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:31,251
Well, they can kill some of us...

641
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,385
...but they cannot kill us all.

642
00:47:38,263 --> 00:47:40,288
And so we are here.

643
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,495
I come here...

644
00:47:44,102 --> 00:47:46,434
... to finish what my boy started.

645
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:48,436
This pool...

646
00:47:49,374 --> 00:47:51,239
...is a river of freedom, friends.

647
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,903
And I mean to swim this river.

648
00:47:59,384 --> 00:48:01,249
This is for Taylor.

649
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:32,046
Hallelujah!

650
00:48:34,986 --> 00:48:36,647
This pool is open for business.

651
00:48:36,855 --> 00:48:39,847
Tell the world I'm gonna
Tell nobody but I

652
00:48:40,058 --> 00:48:41,821
Couldn't keep it to myself

653
00:48:42,027 --> 00:48:44,587
-But I
-Couldn't keep it to myself

654
00:49:23,768 --> 00:49:25,702
I hate to do this, Nehemiah.

655
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,234
I don't know, sheriff.

656
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,872
I think you kindly enjoy it.

657
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:40,283
Put them on yourself.

658
00:49:53,932 --> 00:49:55,229
They're coming!

659
00:50:08,446 --> 00:50:09,504
Okay, come on!

660
00:52:09,634 --> 00:52:11,465
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

661
00:52:13,705 --> 00:52:14,865
Checking in?

662
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,115
What a woman!

663
00:52:30,388 --> 00:52:33,084
We understand the protesters
were behaving peacefully...

664
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:35,259
...and were leaving
the demonstration...

665
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,223
... when you and your
deputies attacked.

666
00:52:37,462 --> 00:52:38,895
-Is this true?
-You're wrong.

667
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,028
He was there.

668
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,064
He was right in the middle of them.

669
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:45,202
We didn't try and stop them.

670
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:47,997
We made one peaceful arrest.

671
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,696
Are you sure?

672
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:52,438
You have to be sure.

673
00:52:53,011 --> 00:52:54,501
I'm sure. I saw him.

674
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,944
All I can tell you
is that the people of Industry...

675
00:52:58,149 --> 00:53:01,118
...got no patience for uppity Negroes
or outside agitators.

676
00:53:01,853 --> 00:53:04,321
There's a man we can talk to.

677
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,589
Somebody's gotta stop him.

678
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:11,158
Last thing Lyndon Johnson wants
is another Selma down here.

679
00:53:11,696 --> 00:53:15,257
Your Judge Mead has kept
a lid on so far, but this...

680
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,569
...Sheriff Doggett is
completely out of control.

681
00:53:19,704 --> 00:53:21,729
Well, I'll be honest, Mr. Murphy...

682
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:25,209
...I'm having big second thoughts.

683
00:53:26,111 --> 00:53:28,011
We shouldn't even be talking to you.

684
00:53:28,646 --> 00:53:30,409
Times are changing, Dove.

685
00:53:30,615 --> 00:53:33,083
This whole way of life down here
is over.

686
00:53:34,018 --> 00:53:36,509
We gotta move the sheriff out of
the picture. The boy must testify.

687
00:53:36,721 --> 00:53:40,487
No, I don't want him involved.
This is dangerous stuff.

688
00:53:40,692 --> 00:53:41,522
Uncle Dove--

689
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,523
He was at the pool both times.

690
00:53:43,728 --> 00:53:46,492
He's the only one who saw
what happened to Taylor.

691
00:53:46,698 --> 00:53:49,030
I think the grand jury
will believe him.

692
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:54,302
Peter Joseph, do you think
you could do that?

693
00:53:54,506 --> 00:53:56,371
Tell the jury what you saw?

694
00:53:57,942 --> 00:53:59,204
Yes, sir.

695
00:54:00,378 --> 00:54:01,572
I don't know.

696
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,613
You bring me all the way out here,
and you don't know?

697
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:06,617
Why'd you call me?

698
00:54:06,818 --> 00:54:09,719
-Because we want this killing to stop.
-So stop it!

699
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,051
You can't protect us.

700
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,449
No, sir, I can't. I cannot.

701
00:54:14,759 --> 00:54:18,957
The only way that you can do that
is to put this man away.

702
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:21,195
Oh, my God!

703
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,391
I wanna remember you just like this.

704
00:54:24,602 --> 00:54:25,762
Come on.

705
00:54:26,004 --> 00:54:27,164
Come.

706
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:29,070
Don't move.

707
00:54:32,777 --> 00:54:34,005
Alex...

708
00:54:34,245 --> 00:54:37,840
...Joan, I want you to meet
the latest Harry Hall discovery:

709
00:54:38,082 --> 00:54:39,310
Carolyn Clay...

710
00:54:39,584 --> 00:54:41,074
...from Alabama.

711
00:54:42,353 --> 00:54:43,911
Isn't she stunning?

712
00:54:44,522 --> 00:54:45,580
Lovely, Harry.

713
00:54:46,357 --> 00:54:47,585
What does she do?

714
00:54:48,393 --> 00:54:49,985
Me? Oh, I'm an actress.

715
00:54:50,295 --> 00:54:51,728
What have you done?

716
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:53,996
Well, just some things back home--

717
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:56,793
School plays, that sort of thing?

718
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:59,993
Well, yes, school plays
and that sort of thing, but...

719
00:55:00,438 --> 00:55:02,065
...Harry's giving me a chance.

720
00:55:03,374 --> 00:55:04,898
How ambitious of him.

721
00:55:05,109 --> 00:55:08,374
Walter Shwegmann at Screen Gems
saw a photo of her...

722
00:55:08,813 --> 00:55:10,974
...and fell completely in love.

723
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:13,642
Television, it's so...

724
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:15,413
...popular.

725
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:19,850
You should show her
to Hitchcock's people, Harry.

726
00:55:20,558 --> 00:55:22,822
Alexander, you know
I'm up for that part.

727
00:55:23,728 --> 00:55:26,060
Harry, it's been fabulous as always.

728
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,854
See you on Saturday.

729
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:30,125
And bring a date if you like.

730
00:55:30,335 --> 00:55:32,064
Good luck in television.

731
00:55:32,971 --> 00:55:34,404
Thank you.

732
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,735
Bye-bye.

733
00:55:40,812 --> 00:55:43,280
Promise me, when I make you
into a star...

734
00:55:43,514 --> 00:55:45,311
...you won't become a rattlesnake.

735
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:51,316
Harry, do you think
I really have a chance?

736
00:55:51,522 --> 00:55:55,822
If I didn't, sweetheart, you'd still
be back in Alabama, daydreaming.

737
00:55:57,629 --> 00:55:58,755
Are you ready to work?

738
00:55:58,997 --> 00:56:00,760
I've been ready my whole life.

739
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,027
I wouldn't have thought it possible...

740
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,430
...but you're even prettier
than your 8-by-10.

741
00:56:08,006 --> 00:56:10,839
Why, thank you, Mr. Shwegmann.
So are you.

742
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,266
Thank you.

743
00:56:12,844 --> 00:56:14,436
Excuse me, Harry.

744
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:16,772
This role only works
a couple of days.

745
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:21,450
But we feel that Samantha
needs a regular female...

746
00:56:21,653 --> 00:56:22,483
...bte noire...

747
00:56:22,687 --> 00:56:25,850
...juxtaposed against her usual
Midwestern sweetness.

748
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:30,728
So we're thinking of Lucille Fleur
as a recurring character.

749
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,726
Are you familiar with the show?

750
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:37,166
I watch it every week. It's clever.
But her name's Lucille?

751
00:56:37,402 --> 00:56:38,391
Right.

752
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:39,900
Lucille...

753
00:56:40,104 --> 00:56:41,571
...is a bombshell.

754
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:42,865
A real flirt.

755
00:56:43,374 --> 00:56:46,707
I'll give you Darrin's lines.
Top of page 12.

756
00:56:48,546 --> 00:56:50,138
Okay, you ready?

757
00:56:56,587 --> 00:56:59,215
I was hoping you would say yes.

758
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,921
"Yes" is my favourite word
in the whole world.

759
00:57:06,597 --> 00:57:09,293
Good. That's very, very nice work.

760
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,230
-Thank you.
-I wanna try it one more time.

761
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:15,764
"Peter J. Bullis.

762
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:19,740
Age 13. Injured in mysterious
shooting incident."

763
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,006
Look! Just look at this!

764
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,614
-What is this?
-Look at him!

765
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,612
Hugging a Negro
on the cover of Look!

766
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,478
I didn't know it'd turn out
like that.

767
00:57:27,685 --> 00:57:30,620
You knew? You knew about this
and didn't tell anybody?

768
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,222
Who gave you permission
to be on the cover of Look?

769
00:57:34,092 --> 00:57:36,390
Gosh dog, Peejoe, you're famous!

770
00:57:36,594 --> 00:57:40,223
You might as well start packing now!
Go on, Dove.

771
00:57:40,431 --> 00:57:42,899
Read it. "Night of Agony."
I'm so ashamed.

772
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:44,398
Now, look here, Earlene.

773
00:57:44,602 --> 00:57:47,002
You think he looks bad?
Look at John Doggett.

774
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:50,136
That's it!
I want them out of this house!

775
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:52,901
You're just gonna
have to call your old mother.

776
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:55,338
I'm sorry, but this is the last straw!

777
00:57:55,546 --> 00:57:58,572
Don't be silly. He can't help
that they took his picture.

778
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:02,913
I can't stand the idea
of everybody talking about us!

779
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:10,186
Excuse me, Miss Clay.
You're wanted on the set.

780
00:58:10,395 --> 00:58:12,989
Honey, I'm wanted in 17 states.

781
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,389
If you'll follow me.

782
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:16,956
Thank you.

783
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,699
-Got your lines down?
-I stayed up the night practising.

784
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:29,038
Relax and have fun. Would you
introduce her to everyone, Amanda?

785
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,477
-Certainly.
-Okay, people, let's go!

786
00:58:32,316 --> 00:58:34,978
-Can I put my husband here?
-Sure.

787
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:42,491
-And here you are.
-Thank you.

788
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,125
Break a leg.

789
00:58:46,297 --> 00:58:48,629
I'm Darrin today.
You're Carolyn, aren't you?

790
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,294
Great hair.

791
00:58:50,501 --> 00:58:51,866
Thank you. You're Darrin?

792
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,129
I'm his stand-in.
I feed you his lines.

793
00:58:54,338 --> 00:58:56,203
How you doing?
I'm Endora.

794
00:58:56,941 --> 00:58:58,909
-Samantha.
-I don't understand.

795
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,807
We're shooting cutaways. They'll
bring the real actors in Thursday.

796
00:59:03,014 --> 00:59:04,572
You just pretend I'm Darrin.

797
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:06,477
They'll plug him in later.

798
00:59:06,684 --> 00:59:09,915
Folks back home are never
gonna believe this.

799
00:59:10,121 --> 00:59:13,955
"Lucille Fleur pays a visit."
Scene 7, take 1.

800
00:59:14,158 --> 00:59:15,147
And action!

801
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,190
I was hoping you would say yes.

802
00:59:17,395 --> 00:59:20,489
"Yes" is my favourite word
in the whole world.

803
00:59:20,698 --> 00:59:21,562
I beg your pardon?

804
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,758
Aren't you looking for Miss Jasmine
for your ad campaign?

805
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:27,733
We are. Won't you sit down, Miss...?

806
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,668
Lucille Fleur.

807
00:59:29,874 --> 00:59:31,136
And cut.

808
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,578
-Action!
-Come off it, Sarah.

809
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,679
Dignity, Samantha. Dignity.

810
00:59:36,881 --> 00:59:38,075
Well, hello, Samantha.

811
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:40,807
My, but it has been a long time,
hasn't it?

812
00:59:41,018 --> 00:59:42,849
She's one of us,
though I hate to admit it.

813
00:59:43,387 --> 00:59:45,582
What are you doing with my husband?

814
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,984
Your husband?

815
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:49,623
Carolyn, that was swell.

816
00:59:53,297 --> 00:59:57,791
Nice job, everyone! That's a wrap
on Carolyn Clay, and that's a wrap!

817
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,912
Look, Chester.

818
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,916
I made it. I'm here.

819
01:00:17,255 --> 01:00:19,519
And they love me, you know?

820
01:00:20,191 --> 01:00:21,920
I was good.

821
01:01:00,731 --> 01:01:01,891
Peejoe?

822
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:05,033
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

823
01:01:19,283 --> 01:01:21,183
Be careful, there. He bites.

824
01:01:21,385 --> 01:01:22,545
Yes, sir.

825
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,319
Well, Peejoe...

826
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:27,752
...it's not every day
I get to treat a celebrity.

827
01:01:27,992 --> 01:01:30,324
That was some picture on Look.

828
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:34,361
That guy got me in trouble. He didn't
even ask if he could take it.

829
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,830
Well, you did look kind of surprised.

830
01:01:38,035 --> 01:01:41,232
They tried to make it out
like I was some kind of hero.

831
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,570
I didn't do anything.

832
01:01:44,008 --> 01:01:46,408
Well, you be careful, young son.

833
01:01:46,644 --> 01:01:48,908
This is dangerous times in this town.

834
01:01:49,113 --> 01:01:52,105
Oh, yeah. He was right about that.

835
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,416
That Sheriff Doggett was on me
like fleas on a dog.

836
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:59,647
There was a lot of protesting
going on in the streets of lndustry.

837
01:01:59,857 --> 01:02:01,984
And after that story
in Look magazine...

838
01:02:02,193 --> 01:02:05,492
... everybody in America knew
what was happening down there.

839
01:02:05,863 --> 01:02:08,297
Who would've thought
that before summer was over...

840
01:02:08,499 --> 01:02:10,023
...I would stand in a crowd...

841
01:02:10,234 --> 01:02:12,896
...hearing the most famous
black man in America...

842
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,129
...preach about Taylor Jackson?

843
01:02:15,339 --> 01:02:17,307
Judge Mead has issued an order...

844
01:02:17,508 --> 01:02:21,069
...for the integration of
the Industry Municipal Swimming Pool.

845
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:25,307
But I come here today
to make a promise to you.

846
01:02:26,684 --> 01:02:30,313
We shall overcome the walls
that divide one race from another...

847
01:02:30,521 --> 01:02:33,513
...to the everlasting shame
and detriment of both.

848
01:02:33,724 --> 01:02:36,284
We shall overcome
the arrogance of power.

849
01:02:36,494 --> 01:02:39,463
And with our golden sword
of nonviolence...

850
01:02:39,664 --> 01:02:43,156
...we shall overcome the violence
of those that will try to stop us.

851
01:02:43,601 --> 01:02:45,228
God is on our side!

852
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:50,372
My eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord!

853
01:02:55,713 --> 01:02:59,410
We shall overcome

854
01:03:01,018 --> 01:03:04,476
We shall overcome

855
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:12,390
Reverend...

856
01:03:12,697 --> 01:03:15,165
...this is the boy
on the cover of Look.

857
01:03:15,399 --> 01:03:19,563
This boy stood up for Taylor Jackson.
This is Peter Joseph.

858
01:03:28,612 --> 01:03:32,412
At last, I understood what made
Taylor Jackson so important.

859
01:03:32,917 --> 01:03:36,011
Taylor died just as dead
as those boys in Gettysburg...

860
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,245
...and for the same cause.

861
01:03:38,622 --> 01:03:42,581
Dove and Wiley and I were fighting
on the side of the black people...

862
01:03:42,893 --> 01:03:45,054
... the Yankees, Mr. Murphy...

863
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,228
...and Martin Luther King.

864
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:13,491
I worked my heart out making four
dozen sandwiches, and at 12:45...

865
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:20,391
...Mary Louise said they weren't
coming because we're nigger lovers.

866
01:04:20,598 --> 01:04:22,862
-That's ugly.
-That's what she said.

867
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,968
You don't need friends like that.
I hope you hung up on her.

868
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:30,129
Barbara Jean said he brought shame
to the town posing for that magazine.

869
01:04:30,341 --> 01:04:33,208
And if we don't like it here,
we can go somewhere else.

870
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,845
Nobody'd bother taking a photograph
of Barbara Jean.

871
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,707
What am I supposed to do now?

872
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:41,715
That's four dozen pimento cheese
sandwiches gone entirely to waste!

873
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,910
-We could eat them.
-No, we can't.

874
01:04:44,155 --> 01:04:45,554
I threw them in the garbage.

875
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,587
You threw away four dozen sandwiches?

876
01:04:47,825 --> 01:04:50,123
I was mad.
We'll never get invited anywhere!

877
01:04:50,327 --> 01:04:52,761
Get a grip on yourself!
You're coming undone.

878
01:04:52,963 --> 01:04:54,726
Why do you have to get involved?

879
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:58,231
Let somebody else be the hero.
This is none of our business.

880
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,960
Uncle Dove, look!

881
01:05:00,404 --> 01:05:03,373
"Yes" is my favourite word
in the whole world.

882
01:05:03,574 --> 01:05:06,134
It's her! It's Aunt Lucille!

883
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:08,775
I beg your pardon?

884
01:05:08,979 --> 01:05:10,674
Aren't you looking for a Miss... ?

885
01:05:10,881 --> 01:05:13,782
I do not believe this!

886
01:05:14,018 --> 01:05:15,713
I mean, we are.

887
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,982
Won't you sit down, Miss... ?

888
01:05:18,189 --> 01:05:19,884
She's pretty good!

889
01:05:20,658 --> 01:05:22,125
She's funny too.

890
01:05:49,253 --> 01:05:50,720
You were great.

891
01:05:50,921 --> 01:05:52,548
You were fantastic.

892
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,347
Welcome to Hollywood, kiddo.

893
01:05:54,592 --> 01:05:56,287
Walter called, all excited.

894
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:59,622
They're writing Lucille Fleur
into four episodes this season.

895
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,828
They offered us good money.

896
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,497
You're kidding!

897
01:06:03,734 --> 01:06:06,066
That is terrific, Harry.

898
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:09,603
I'm not so sure we should lock you
into television so quickly.

899
01:06:10,774 --> 01:06:12,366
You know my greatest ambition?

900
01:06:12,576 --> 01:06:13,770
What?

901
01:06:14,678 --> 01:06:17,340
To look in that hatbox
one of these days.

902
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:53,711
If I have to disappear
for a little while...

903
01:06:53,918 --> 01:06:56,819
...don't make a big thing
out of it, okay?

904
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,717
What do you mean, "disappear"?

905
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:03,792
We're just getting started.

906
01:07:06,964 --> 01:07:08,158
It's just...

907
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:12,460
...some unfinished business
that I have to take care of...

908
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,032
...and I don't want you to make
a big thing out of it.

909
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,175
It's just, I don't want
you to worry and....

910
01:07:20,344 --> 01:07:21,936
And I want you to know...

911
01:07:22,179 --> 01:07:25,307
...how grateful I am for everything.

912
01:07:28,018 --> 01:07:29,246
Hey, now.

913
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:33,488
Don't do anything without
talking to me.

914
01:07:35,859 --> 01:07:38,419
You have all the makings of a star.

915
01:07:43,534 --> 01:07:45,934
God, I hope so.

916
01:08:07,124 --> 01:08:09,752
Good. You brought
the lovely Miss Clay...

917
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,484
...a vision in gold.

918
01:08:11,695 --> 01:08:13,026
My dear.

919
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:15,424
Joan, you do remember Carolyn,
don't you?

920
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:16,622
How could I forget?

921
01:08:16,834 --> 01:08:20,201
Jeepers, your house is so wonderful.

922
01:08:20,404 --> 01:08:22,395
I wish my mama could see this.

923
01:08:22,606 --> 01:08:26,201
I just love the sound
of an authentic peasant accent.

924
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:27,638
Don't you, Harry?

925
01:08:28,012 --> 01:08:30,879
Yes, I do.
I remember when I fixed yours.

926
01:08:34,585 --> 01:08:35,882
Binkums...

927
01:08:36,086 --> 01:08:37,747
...do you smell something?

928
01:08:39,556 --> 01:08:42,753
He smells something.
Must be your perfume.

929
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:47,256
Is there someplace that I could
tuck my hatbox, maybe?

930
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,657
Catherine, show Miss...
where to put her things.

931
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:54,767
You go on, Harry. No, that's mine,
thank you. I'll catch up.

932
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,273
All right, Chester...

933
01:09:05,616 --> 01:09:08,346
...you stay right there and be quiet.

934
01:09:10,087 --> 01:09:11,714
Doggy, doggy! Doggies!

935
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,634
Well...

936
01:09:25,903 --> 01:09:30,772
...I hear you were quite the sensation
over at Screen Gems this week.

937
01:09:31,942 --> 01:09:35,002
I had more fun than you can imagine.

938
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,146
Here, doggies! Here, come on!
Jump up!

939
01:09:37,347 --> 01:09:41,044
There you go. That's it!
Good doggies!

940
01:09:41,485 --> 01:09:45,046
We're doing a picture with Tab Hunter.
It's a racecar thing.

941
01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:47,721
Maybe you'd like to read for me.

942
01:09:49,893 --> 01:09:54,592
I would love to. You're just gonna
have to talk to Harry first.

943
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:58,428
Learning fast, I see.

944
01:09:58,635 --> 01:10:02,093
Well, that's good. I like a girl
with a head on her shoulders.

945
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,328
Champagne?

946
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:07,702
What the hell?

947
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:16,201
What are you doing?
Bring her over here!

948
01:11:18,048 --> 01:11:19,310
Get her up here.

949
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:24,515
All right, Chester. I'm really
angry now. You're driving me nuts!

950
01:11:24,755 --> 01:11:27,815
Do you understand? Party's over.

951
01:11:31,929 --> 01:11:34,864
-You ruin everything for me.
-What went on in there?

952
01:11:35,098 --> 01:11:38,727
I don't know. There's something wrong
with those little rats of hers.

953
01:11:38,936 --> 01:11:40,836
-Wait. I'll drive you.
-No!

954
01:11:41,038 --> 01:11:42,869
I mean, no. I mean...

955
01:11:43,073 --> 01:11:46,668
...you don't have to. I had
the best time, but I really gotta go.

956
01:11:46,877 --> 01:11:48,868
I'll call you as soon as I can.

957
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,410
Hey, you!

958
01:11:50,614 --> 01:11:52,104
I'll give you a hundred--

959
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,180
Norman! Oh, my God!

960
01:11:54,384 --> 01:11:56,215
Get me the hell out of here.

961
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:58,445
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.

962
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,350
That's what I been waiting for.

963
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:04,857
24 hours, 7 days a week. I'm at your
service. All you gotta do is ask.

964
01:12:05,062 --> 01:12:09,021
Wherever you wanna go, I'm ready.
Gassed up and at your service.

965
01:12:09,233 --> 01:12:12,202
The wind's at our backs.
We're sailing now.

966
01:12:18,442 --> 01:12:21,434
Hey, Norman, did you follow me
to that party?

967
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:24,646
Yes, ma'am.

968
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:29,614
I've been following you
since the minute I saw you.

969
01:12:31,955 --> 01:12:36,016
Yeah, I figured sooner or later
you were bound to need a ride.

970
01:12:47,304 --> 01:12:50,273
Boy, you left that place
in an awful hurry, huh?

971
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:55,844
No questions, Norman.

972
01:12:56,346 --> 01:12:57,643
Yes, ma'am.

973
01:12:58,415 --> 01:12:59,609
Drive north.

974
01:13:00,017 --> 01:13:01,279
North, yes.

975
01:13:03,453 --> 01:13:04,511
Yes, ma'am.

976
01:13:21,204 --> 01:13:22,671
This is the place.

977
01:13:24,107 --> 01:13:25,870
The Golden Gate Bridge?

978
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:37,352
Can I go with you?

979
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,719
No questions, Norman.

980
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:49,057
Admit it, Lucille.
You can't throw me away.

981
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:50,891
You ain't got the guts.

982
01:13:51,101 --> 01:13:54,161
You need me.
You ain't nothing without me.

983
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:57,829
That used to be true,
but not anymore.

984
01:14:09,219 --> 01:14:11,016
That's deep enough.

985
01:14:29,106 --> 01:14:31,097
Shit! The money!

986
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:34,503
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

987
01:14:44,354 --> 01:14:45,514
Shit!

988
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:17,046
Don't do it!

989
01:15:17,254 --> 01:15:20,417
-There's too much to live for!
-Officer, I'm not trying to--

990
01:15:20,624 --> 01:15:22,489
Not until I get some backup.

991
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:25,217
I wasn't trying to jump, you idiot!

992
01:15:25,629 --> 01:15:28,393
Sorry. You know what?
See that bag over there?

993
01:15:28,598 --> 01:15:31,897
There's a bunch of money in there.
Just take it and let me go.

994
01:15:32,102 --> 01:15:33,091
What do we got?

995
01:15:33,303 --> 01:15:35,703
-She tried to go over.
-I wasn't trying to jump.

996
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:38,272
Don't take your hands off her.
They always try again.

997
01:15:38,475 --> 01:15:41,774
No, I'm not gonna try it.
Listen, I won all this money.

998
01:15:41,978 --> 01:15:43,002
Big money, Frank.

999
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:47,983
I won that money in Las Vegas, and I
was standing here and it fell over.

1000
01:15:48,185 --> 01:15:49,584
That's why I climbed over.

1001
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,588
-That something of yours?
-I beg your pardon?

1002
01:15:52,823 --> 01:15:54,450
Is that something of yours?

1003
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:58,617
No. I've never seen that before
in my whole life.

1004
01:15:59,029 --> 01:16:01,259
Please just let me go,
officer, really.

1005
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:04,597
Thank God!

1006
01:16:07,838 --> 01:16:08,770
Oh, my God!

1007
01:16:08,972 --> 01:16:10,496
Thank God, you're all right.

1008
01:16:10,707 --> 01:16:12,675
I couldn't let you go through
with this.

1009
01:16:13,176 --> 01:16:15,542
What the hell...?

1010
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:19,646
Joe!

1011
01:16:22,018 --> 01:16:23,542
Are you all right?

1012
01:16:27,657 --> 01:16:29,386
Bye, Chester.

1013
01:16:42,672 --> 01:16:45,664
I've come here to take custody
of this dangerous fugitive.

1014
01:16:45,876 --> 01:16:47,275
She won't hurt anybody else.

1015
01:16:57,187 --> 01:16:59,348
Welcome home, Aunt Lucille.

1016
01:17:05,328 --> 01:17:07,762
Lucille, do you feel remorse?
Why'd you do it?

1017
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,556
-It's good to be home.
-Did you confess?

1018
01:17:09,766 --> 01:17:11,324
I didn't do anything wrong.

1019
01:17:11,535 --> 01:17:12,729
-You're not guilty?
-No.

1020
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:15,733
-Where did you get the money?
-I got lucky in Las Vegas.

1021
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:17,372
Do you think you're crazy?

1022
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:21,071
No. I was crazy to be with him
all those years.

1023
01:17:21,278 --> 01:17:23,542
She'll answer your questions
at the trial.

1024
01:17:23,747 --> 01:17:24,577
Hello, Lucille.

1025
01:17:24,781 --> 01:17:27,249
Hello, sheriff.
I saw your picture in Look.

1026
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:29,145
They didn't do you any favours.

1027
01:17:29,352 --> 01:17:31,513
No, but I been looking for you.
Get back!

1028
01:17:31,721 --> 01:17:33,882
Hey, Peejoe! Hey, Wiley!

1029
01:17:34,090 --> 01:17:37,924
That was so sweet of y'all to come
and see me. How are my babies?

1030
01:17:38,161 --> 01:17:40,356
They're coming tomorrow. You okay?

1031
01:17:40,564 --> 01:17:43,328
I am fabulous!
Come and see me in jail.

1032
01:17:55,345 --> 01:17:56,778
Here comes Uncle Chester.

1033
01:18:02,118 --> 01:18:03,142
That's him.

1034
01:18:03,353 --> 01:18:07,016
I don't suppose there's any reason
to open it, is there?

1035
01:18:07,357 --> 01:18:08,790
I wouldn't.

1036
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:28,973
Sister?

1037
01:18:30,547 --> 01:18:32,105
Sister Vinson?

1038
01:18:34,718 --> 01:18:37,812
I don't know who you are,
but I'm not your sister.

1039
01:18:41,391 --> 01:18:43,655
My name is Nehemiah Jackson.

1040
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:47,591
Your brother and I are colleagues.
I run the other funeral home.

1041
01:18:48,498 --> 01:18:50,227
I read about....

1042
01:18:50,734 --> 01:18:54,431
I mean, I'm real sorry
to hear about your son.

1043
01:18:54,671 --> 01:18:55,729
Thank you.

1044
01:18:58,508 --> 01:18:59,770
You know...

1045
01:19:00,577 --> 01:19:04,604
...Dove is a good man.
He's done me many a favour.

1046
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:09,510
And I just want you to know
I'm sorry for your trouble.

1047
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:14,418
We'll be gone free tomorrow, and if
there's anything I can do for you....

1048
01:19:14,824 --> 01:19:16,815
No. Thank you.

1049
01:19:17,927 --> 01:19:21,761
I mean, unless you have
something to eat. I'm so hungry.

1050
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:30,773
Thank you.

1051
01:19:31,608 --> 01:19:32,973
Thank you.

1052
01:19:36,846 --> 01:19:40,873
I suppose it must be a terrible thing
to kill somebody.

1053
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:46,319
Yeah, I wouldn't recommend it.

1054
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:51,624
I don't believe I could bring myself
to do that...

1055
01:19:51,861 --> 01:19:54,625
...though I've thought
about it sometimes.

1056
01:19:58,134 --> 01:20:00,625
Well, it's a long story, you know?

1057
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:04,006
I just didn't see any other way out.

1058
01:20:04,307 --> 01:20:06,969
There's always some other way.

1059
01:20:08,745 --> 01:20:11,305
No, not with Chester.

1060
01:20:11,915 --> 01:20:13,143
Yes, ma'am.

1061
01:20:14,317 --> 01:20:17,047
But did you really have to do
what you did?

1062
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:24,986
I bet that you've always been
really kind to your wife...

1063
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:27,322
...haven't you, Mr. Jackson?

1064
01:20:27,564 --> 01:20:29,225
I try to be.

1065
01:20:32,068 --> 01:20:34,832
Well, then, you couldn't
possibly understand.

1066
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:36,562
Oh, sister...

1067
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,207
...I know what it's like to be
held down and kept down.

1068
01:20:40,877 --> 01:20:42,742
Believe me, I know.

1069
01:20:45,548 --> 01:20:47,709
Yeah, I imagine you do.

1070
01:20:49,919 --> 01:20:50,783
Well...

1071
01:20:51,554 --> 01:20:53,351
...I hope you sleep well.

1072
01:20:55,358 --> 01:20:57,519
Thank you. You too.

1073
01:20:58,528 --> 01:21:00,189
Good night, all.

1074
01:21:00,697 --> 01:21:02,358
God bless you.

1075
01:21:03,266 --> 01:21:05,530
And God bless Martin Luther King!

1076
01:21:06,369 --> 01:21:08,530
And our enemies too.

1077
01:21:18,281 --> 01:21:20,215
So that's how it works.

1078
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,319
Peter Joseph and I stay away
from the grand jury...

1079
01:21:24,521 --> 01:21:26,512
...and John Doggett will help you out.

1080
01:21:26,723 --> 01:21:29,419
He helps me out? How?

1081
01:21:29,626 --> 01:21:33,528
He can get the D.A. to go along
with a plea of temporary insanity.

1082
01:21:33,897 --> 01:21:36,798
So you want me to say that I'm crazy?

1083
01:21:38,902 --> 01:21:40,369
They'll believe you're crazy.

1084
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:50,502
Did I tell you that you look
very much like Errol Flynn...

1085
01:21:50,747 --> 01:21:52,942
...with that patch on your eye?

1086
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:55,574
It makes you very dashing.

1087
01:21:57,086 --> 01:21:58,348
Thanks.

1088
01:22:00,089 --> 01:22:01,750
I'm sorry you got caught.

1089
01:22:02,425 --> 01:22:04,985
That's all right.
It was fun while it lasted.

1090
01:22:07,263 --> 01:22:10,755
-You should've got rid of his head.
-Yeah, I know.

1091
01:22:12,769 --> 01:22:15,431
I guess that I just wanted him...

1092
01:22:15,672 --> 01:22:17,765
...to see that I could do it.

1093
01:22:22,045 --> 01:22:24,070
He talked to me sometimes.

1094
01:22:27,183 --> 01:22:30,277
I wasn't trying to jump off
that bridge.

1095
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:34,114
I was trying to shut him up
once and for all.

1096
01:22:34,858 --> 01:22:36,485
He talked to you?

1097
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:40,625
He talked to me.
He gave me a hard time...

1098
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,855
...just like when he was alive.

1099
01:22:56,479 --> 01:22:58,538
We're going with
a temporary-insanity plea.

1100
01:22:58,748 --> 01:23:01,808
You mean we're not talking
to the grand jury?

1101
01:23:02,051 --> 01:23:05,214
No, we're gonna start living
like everybody else in this town.

1102
01:23:05,421 --> 01:23:07,321
This is none of our business.

1103
01:23:09,092 --> 01:23:11,060
It's Aunt Lucille, ain't it?

1104
01:23:11,728 --> 01:23:13,719
You made a deal with the sheriff.

1105
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,624
He lets her go,
and we have to shut up.

1106
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:18,300
She's family.

1107
01:23:18,668 --> 01:23:21,933
She is my baby sister,
and I'm not gonna let them kill her.

1108
01:23:22,171 --> 01:23:25,038
But you said we can stop him!
You said we could put him in jail!

1109
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:27,402
-Careful, Peejoe.
-I was wrong.

1110
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:31,878
I'm sorry.

1111
01:23:35,618 --> 01:23:37,415
We stuck our necks out too far.

1112
01:23:57,106 --> 01:23:58,505
Hey, over here, Marlon.

1113
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:00,740
Down here.

1114
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:04,972
Down here. It's Mama.
Come on. Come here.

1115
01:24:05,214 --> 01:24:06,476
Marlon, down here.

1116
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:09,316
-Mama?
-Come here, my babies.

1117
01:24:11,554 --> 01:24:14,352
My God, Marlon.
I swear you've grown a foot!

1118
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:19,155
Oh, my babies, I missed you so much!
Oh, my God!

1119
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:23,024
Sondra, you taking care
of Marilyn for me?

1120
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:24,460
Yeah, Mama, I have.

1121
01:24:24,734 --> 01:24:26,725
You, Rock.
Let me see your muscles.

1122
01:24:29,138 --> 01:24:33,268
I love you all so much. Thank you
so much for bringing my babies here.

1123
01:24:33,643 --> 01:24:36,373
Go to Uncle Dove's and get
a good night's sleep...

1124
01:24:36,579 --> 01:24:38,274
...and I'll see you in the morning.

1125
01:24:38,481 --> 01:24:40,915
-Go on, you guys. Go on, now.
-Okay, Mama.

1126
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:43,482
I love you. I love you.

1127
01:24:43,953 --> 01:24:45,318
Good night!

1128
01:24:46,489 --> 01:24:49,117
-Love you, Mama.
-Bye, sweetie.

1129
01:24:59,102 --> 01:25:00,660
All rise.

1130
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:02,838
The Superior Court of Cotton County...

1131
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:05,473
...in the state of Alabama
is now in session.

1132
01:25:05,675 --> 01:25:08,143
The Honorable
Judge Lewis Mead presiding.

1133
01:25:14,617 --> 01:25:16,642
Please be seated and come to order.

1134
01:25:26,996 --> 01:25:28,725
Would you please rise?

1135
01:25:32,702 --> 01:25:34,966
Mrs. Vinson, I told you
at the arraignment...

1136
01:25:35,204 --> 01:25:40,073
...that you cannot enter a plea
of not guilty by reason of sanity.

1137
01:25:40,309 --> 01:25:43,642
But, Your Honour, I am not guilty
and I was not insane.

1138
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:46,641
Am I to take it that you'll
continue with this plea...

1139
01:25:46,849 --> 01:25:49,682
...in spite of your legal advisers...

1140
01:25:49,886 --> 01:25:51,820
...and my opinion about it?

1141
01:25:52,055 --> 01:25:54,580
Is that true?
You're gonna stick with it?

1142
01:25:55,491 --> 01:25:58,153
Your Honour, they've all
gotten together on this deal.

1143
01:25:58,361 --> 01:25:59,919
They want me to say I'm crazy...

1144
01:26:00,163 --> 01:26:02,757
...so they can pack me off
to the loony bin.

1145
01:26:03,366 --> 01:26:04,924
To a loony bin.

1146
01:26:06,502 --> 01:26:09,027
Then I have to stick with what I got.

1147
01:26:11,407 --> 01:26:13,739
Okay. C'est la vie.

1148
01:26:14,777 --> 01:26:17,337
Let the games begin.
Okay, bring in the--

1149
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:19,378
Hold it!

1150
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:22,611
Get them out.
What the hell is this?

1151
01:26:22,852 --> 01:26:24,945
Bailiff, get the children
out of my court!

1152
01:26:25,188 --> 01:26:28,680
What the hell do you think this is,
a kindergarten? Get them out!

1153
01:26:30,326 --> 01:26:31,384
Out!

1154
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:36,592
Gentlemen. I mean you,
lawyers, gentlemen. Forward.

1155
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:39,297
Yeah, you and you. Come here.

1156
01:26:39,702 --> 01:26:43,536
Darling, would you mind coming up here
with a little pen and pencil?

1157
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:47,236
What are you doing with
that cheap trick you just pulled?

1158
01:26:47,443 --> 01:26:49,001
I tried to do that 30 years ago.

1159
01:26:49,212 --> 01:26:51,339
You don't bring children
into the courtroom...

1160
01:26:51,547 --> 01:26:53,742
...to influence the jury
and get sympathy.

1161
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:55,508
Is that understood to you?

1162
01:26:55,718 --> 01:26:57,948
Not a word from you, my friend!

1163
01:26:58,187 --> 01:27:01,088
Now, just get your ass back.
Get your ass back!

1164
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:02,222
Yes, sir.

1165
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:03,983
You got an ass? Move it.

1166
01:27:05,461 --> 01:27:06,587
He's a mean son of--

1167
01:27:08,064 --> 01:27:09,861
Now you can bring in the jury.

1168
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:22,308
Now...

1169
01:27:22,512 --> 01:27:26,812
...when you arrived at the Vinson
residence on May the 5th...

1170
01:27:27,483 --> 01:27:31,783
...you found the body of a man who had
been decapitated. Is that correct?

1171
01:27:31,988 --> 01:27:33,285
It is.

1172
01:27:33,689 --> 01:27:37,216
I've been on this job for 20 years.
This is my first decapitation.

1173
01:27:39,061 --> 01:27:40,892
And you have identified...

1174
01:27:41,097 --> 01:27:43,657
...this man...

1175
01:27:43,866 --> 01:27:46,164
...as Chester Vinson?

1176
01:27:46,536 --> 01:27:47,833
That's right.

1177
01:27:48,871 --> 01:27:50,065
Let me ask you...

1178
01:27:50,873 --> 01:27:52,807
...how you knew who it was...

1179
01:27:55,444 --> 01:27:57,207
...if he didn't have a head?

1180
01:27:57,713 --> 01:27:59,146
I took Dove's word on that.

1181
01:27:59,348 --> 01:28:02,476
You consider Dove Bullis
to be a man of his word?

1182
01:28:03,286 --> 01:28:05,880
He gets confused about
whose side he's on...

1183
01:28:06,122 --> 01:28:08,682
...but I'd say sure,
more or less, he's honest.

1184
01:28:08,925 --> 01:28:11,985
You don't have a murder weapon.
You don't have a witness.

1185
01:28:12,228 --> 01:28:13,752
You don't have a confession.

1186
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:18,364
You don't even know for sure whose
body was in that deep freeze, do you?

1187
01:28:18,601 --> 01:28:20,535
She had his head
when she was arrested!

1188
01:28:21,737 --> 01:28:23,864
-What more proof do you need?
-Isn't it true...

1189
01:28:24,106 --> 01:28:27,507
...that you have always planned
to use Mrs. Vinson...

1190
01:28:27,743 --> 01:28:29,370
...to keep her brother in line?

1191
01:28:30,012 --> 01:28:32,378
Isn't that why you didn't bother
to gather evidence?

1192
01:28:32,615 --> 01:28:35,846
Chester Vinson didn't cut off
his own head! Did he?

1193
01:28:38,487 --> 01:28:39,886
That did it.

1194
01:28:40,923 --> 01:28:43,949
All right. I tell you what.
I'd like to have...

1195
01:28:44,994 --> 01:28:47,554
...a meeting with the young lady
in my chambers...

1196
01:28:47,763 --> 01:28:49,856
...and there'll be
a short recess, okay?

1197
01:28:50,066 --> 01:28:51,294
Without counsel?

1198
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,367
I'd like to see her alone,
you understand? Thank you.

1199
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:55,434
I object.

1200
01:28:55,671 --> 01:28:57,639
Do you know what A-L-O-N-E means?
Alone?

1201
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,172
Violation of procedural rules,
Your Honour.

1202
01:29:00,776 --> 01:29:02,676
Okay, objection overruled.

1203
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:04,710
You shall see her alone.

1204
01:29:08,918 --> 01:29:11,148
Be careful, you hear? Watch it.

1205
01:29:31,474 --> 01:29:32,805
What did he say to you?

1206
01:29:33,776 --> 01:29:35,573
What did he say?

1207
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:41,916
He said that he really liked me
in Bewitched.

1208
01:29:43,286 --> 01:29:45,948
Let me ask you, Mrs. Vinson...

1209
01:29:46,455 --> 01:29:49,788
...why you decided to take
your husband's head with you...

1210
01:29:50,693 --> 01:29:52,456
...to California.

1211
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:05,199
-That's kind of hard to explain.
-Well, just do your best.

1212
01:30:11,547 --> 01:30:14,141
Well, remember Fantasia?

1213
01:30:15,418 --> 01:30:16,783
That movie?

1214
01:30:18,554 --> 01:30:20,613
When Mickey Mouse...

1215
01:30:21,424 --> 01:30:26,361
...chops the wicked little broom
into splinters...

1216
01:30:27,697 --> 01:30:29,289
...and then those splinters...

1217
01:30:29,498 --> 01:30:31,796
...they turn into hundreds
and hundreds...

1218
01:30:32,001 --> 01:30:34,469
...and hundreds of brooms ?

1219
01:30:35,104 --> 01:30:39,700
I was afraid that Chester was gonna
pull some kind of stunt like that.

1220
01:30:46,015 --> 01:30:49,280
But you must've had plenty
of opportunities along the way...

1221
01:30:49,518 --> 01:30:51,008
...to dispose of his head.

1222
01:30:51,587 --> 01:30:52,884
Well....

1223
01:30:53,622 --> 01:30:56,557
Yeah, but as long as it was
in there keeping fresh....

1224
01:30:56,792 --> 01:30:59,955
You know, those plastic containers,
those things are...

1225
01:31:00,162 --> 01:31:02,357
...absolutely amazing.

1226
01:31:03,132 --> 01:31:06,124
Well, anyway, it was kind of like
it never happened...

1227
01:31:06,335 --> 01:31:08,565
...except that I was happy...

1228
01:31:08,771 --> 01:31:11,001
...and I was free.

1229
01:31:12,108 --> 01:31:14,338
I'm not sorry I killed him.
I'm not saying that.

1230
01:31:14,543 --> 01:31:17,171
I probably should've done that
a long time ago--

1231
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:19,712
No further questions, Your Honour.

1232
01:31:24,387 --> 01:31:28,323
Mr. Bullis, you've testified
that Mrs. Vinson...

1233
01:31:28,591 --> 01:31:30,582
...has trouble telling
the difference...

1234
01:31:30,826 --> 01:31:33,351
...between what's real and what's...

1235
01:31:34,196 --> 01:31:35,356
...not.

1236
01:31:35,831 --> 01:31:38,129
Can you give us some examples?

1237
01:31:38,834 --> 01:31:41,359
She said Chester's head
was talking to her.

1238
01:31:42,671 --> 01:31:43,638
Talking to her?

1239
01:31:43,839 --> 01:31:45,067
Out in California.

1240
01:31:45,574 --> 01:31:47,474
Can you think of anything else?

1241
01:31:47,676 --> 01:31:49,473
The whole pattern of her behaviour--

1242
01:31:49,712 --> 01:31:52,374
Your Honour, I object.
This man is not a psychiatrist.

1243
01:31:52,982 --> 01:31:55,280
Come on, will you?
You're overruled.

1244
01:31:55,484 --> 01:31:57,008
Just sit down now.

1245
01:31:57,253 --> 01:31:58,345
Go ahead.

1246
01:31:58,554 --> 01:32:00,545
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I'm her brother.

1247
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:05,016
She's always been a wonderful part of
our family, a good mother to her kids.

1248
01:32:05,227 --> 01:32:07,718
But Chester Vinson was not
good to her!

1249
01:32:08,297 --> 01:32:10,265
I never realized how much...

1250
01:32:11,700 --> 01:32:13,429
...how much he damaged her...

1251
01:32:14,503 --> 01:32:15,902
...or I would've--

1252
01:32:19,141 --> 01:32:20,938
I think he made her go...

1253
01:32:21,877 --> 01:32:22,844
...a little crazy.

1254
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:26,840
Do you think she's still dangerous?

1255
01:32:27,383 --> 01:32:28,407
Absolutely not.

1256
01:32:28,651 --> 01:32:30,676
No further questions, Your Honour.

1257
01:32:33,255 --> 01:32:34,222
What did she tell you that day?

1258
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:38,156
She said she killed Uncle Chester
right after the 14 0:00 news.

1259
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:40,294
Did she tell you how she killed him?

1260
01:32:41,564 --> 01:32:43,998
She put rat poison in his coffee.

1261
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,599
Terrible way to go.

1262
01:32:46,635 --> 01:32:47,624
Did she say why?

1263
01:32:48,504 --> 01:32:51,837
She said you use rat poison
if you wanted to kill a rat.

1264
01:32:52,908 --> 01:32:55,502
I meant, did she say
why she killed him?

1265
01:32:56,278 --> 01:32:58,109
He wouldn't let her go to Hollywood.

1266
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:02,148
He said she was crazy because
she wanted to be on Bewitched.

1267
01:33:02,418 --> 01:33:06,479
She made it too. She got there.
She was great.

1268
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:07,953
I bet she was.

1269
01:33:08,157 --> 01:33:11,786
Said you only got one life. Can't sit
around waiting for your next life.

1270
01:33:11,994 --> 01:33:13,791
She made me promise not to tell...

1271
01:33:13,996 --> 01:33:15,258
...how she did it.

1272
01:33:15,498 --> 01:33:17,227
But you're breaking that promise?

1273
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:21,727
You made me swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth.

1274
01:33:21,937 --> 01:33:23,564
Have you done that for us today?

1275
01:33:23,939 --> 01:33:25,930
Have you told us the whole truth...

1276
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:27,905
...and nothing but the truth?

1277
01:33:30,579 --> 01:33:31,511
No, sir.

1278
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:36,041
What exactly do you mean?

1279
01:33:37,052 --> 01:33:38,519
The whole truth is...

1280
01:33:38,721 --> 01:33:40,018
...she's here because of me.

1281
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:41,950
I know who killed Taylor Jackson.

1282
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:44,353
It was that man there!
Sheriff Doggett!

1283
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:47,654
He pretended it was an accident,
but I saw it!

1284
01:33:47,863 --> 01:33:51,230
He knows I saw it! He's been after
Aunt Lucille ever since...

1285
01:33:51,433 --> 01:33:53,697
...to keep me from telling.
He did it!

1286
01:33:53,903 --> 01:33:55,393
He killed Taylor Jackson!

1287
01:33:56,772 --> 01:33:58,137
Quiet in the court!

1288
01:33:58,340 --> 01:33:59,364
Okay, now.

1289
01:33:59,575 --> 01:34:03,909
Hold it down! I ain't running no
circus. Everybody just settle down!

1290
01:34:30,439 --> 01:34:31,963
Your Honour.

1291
01:34:33,008 --> 01:34:34,999
-Your Honour!
-I hear you.

1292
01:34:35,244 --> 01:34:37,178
With the court's indulgence...

1293
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:39,975
...my client would like
to make a statement.

1294
01:34:40,182 --> 01:34:42,776
A closing statement
from the defendant?

1295
01:34:43,118 --> 01:34:46,747
I don't know. I'd like to hear
what the young lady's got to say.

1296
01:34:47,256 --> 01:34:49,383
-You go ahead, darling.
-Thank you, sir.

1297
01:34:49,592 --> 01:34:53,619
Thanks. Last night I wrote down
a list of every single bad thing...

1298
01:34:53,829 --> 01:34:57,390
-...Chester Vinson ever did to me.
-I fail to see the relevance.

1299
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,660
Please sit down and be quiet.
You've had your turn.

1300
01:35:01,303 --> 01:35:03,203
Be a gentleman. Take her advice.

1301
01:35:03,405 --> 01:35:04,337
Sit down.

1302
01:35:05,608 --> 01:35:08,771
My darling, you can continue.
And if you wanna move around...

1303
01:35:08,978 --> 01:35:11,173
...whatever makes you relaxed,
go ahead.

1304
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:12,677
Thank you, sir.

1305
01:35:13,048 --> 01:35:15,209
Here, honey, come on. Go on.

1306
01:35:15,451 --> 01:35:18,443
Say it. Yeah, that's it.
Go right on up there.

1307
01:35:18,654 --> 01:35:20,747
Thank you, Your Honour.

1308
01:35:23,459 --> 01:35:25,927
I guess I'll just
start at the beginning.

1309
01:35:26,462 --> 01:35:28,430
The night that we got married....

1310
01:35:28,631 --> 01:35:30,189
Mama, remember?

1311
01:35:30,899 --> 01:35:32,867
Chester got so drunk...

1312
01:35:33,302 --> 01:35:36,135
...that he just ran off with
his coon-hunting buddies...

1313
01:35:36,572 --> 01:35:38,767
...and he forgot all about me.

1314
01:35:39,241 --> 01:35:41,903
And he stayed gone for three days.

1315
01:35:42,611 --> 01:35:44,044
Number two...

1316
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:47,276
...the time that I was pregnant
with Sond...

1317
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:52,819
...we went to the football game
and my water broke...

1318
01:35:53,656 --> 01:35:56,147
...but he didn't wanna leave...

1319
01:35:56,492 --> 01:36:00,360
...so I had to stand there with water
running down my legs until halftime.

1320
01:36:02,264 --> 01:36:05,233
There are worse things on this list.

1321
01:36:07,336 --> 01:36:10,737
He used to poke holes
in my diaphragm with a pin...

1322
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:13,740
...because he loved having
me pregnant...

1323
01:36:14,943 --> 01:36:19,744
...because that way I could stay home
and take care of him, cater to him.

1324
01:36:20,449 --> 01:36:24,249
So I was pregnant
for 54 months of my life.

1325
01:36:25,020 --> 01:36:28,046
And he used to cheat on me
all the time.

1326
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:30,815
He cheated on me when I was pregnant.

1327
01:36:32,328 --> 01:36:34,922
The last one was with my best friend.

1328
01:36:36,131 --> 01:36:38,429
That's right.
I'm talking about you, Charlene!

1329
01:36:38,934 --> 01:36:41,767
I knew about it
the whole goddamn time!

1330
01:36:43,405 --> 01:36:44,235
I did.

1331
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:55,013
And he used to hit me all the time.

1332
01:36:56,051 --> 01:37:00,681
Dove, you don't know how many times
I went to the emergency hospital....

1333
01:37:03,759 --> 01:37:08,696
I went to the emergency hospital.
I covered up my bruises with makeup...

1334
01:37:09,565 --> 01:37:11,897
...because I knew that if you knew...

1335
01:37:12,167 --> 01:37:13,691
...that you would kill him.

1336
01:37:18,173 --> 01:37:20,141
Well, now you don't have to.

1337
01:37:22,511 --> 01:37:24,206
That's not the worst part.

1338
01:37:26,181 --> 01:37:28,308
The worst part is that he used to...

1339
01:37:28,517 --> 01:37:30,644
...hit the kids when I wasn't around.

1340
01:37:34,056 --> 01:37:36,854
And they were just
scared to death of him...

1341
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:38,151
...my babies.

1342
01:37:40,596 --> 01:37:41,426
Sorry.

1343
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:56,378
Thank you. Right.

1344
01:37:59,448 --> 01:38:00,278
You know...

1345
01:38:02,117 --> 01:38:03,914
...there are lots of ways...

1346
01:38:05,788 --> 01:38:07,756
...that you can kill a person.

1347
01:38:08,991 --> 01:38:11,585
There are slow ways
and there are fast ways.

1348
01:38:12,561 --> 01:38:16,861
And Chester was killing me
the slow way for 13 years.

1349
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:20,895
You know, you stay....

1350
01:38:21,170 --> 01:38:25,436
You spend the whole day making
a beautiful meal for your husband...

1351
01:38:25,674 --> 01:38:28,108
...and he gobbles it down
in five minutes...

1352
01:38:28,343 --> 01:38:31,710
...and he never says thank you,
and a little piece of you dies.

1353
01:38:32,948 --> 01:38:36,042
Or you try to talk to him...

1354
01:38:36,652 --> 01:38:39,712
...and he tries to look around you
so he can see the TV.

1355
01:38:39,922 --> 01:38:41,822
He's just killing you.

1356
01:38:42,191 --> 01:38:44,216
He's just using you up.

1357
01:38:46,261 --> 01:38:50,561
He's just watching you grow old
and waiting for you to die.

1358
01:38:56,138 --> 01:38:57,628
I just hope...

1359
01:39:00,108 --> 01:39:02,975
...that you'll let me go back
to my babies.

1360
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:13,520
I'm not guilty.

1361
01:39:17,192 --> 01:39:18,819
Because what I did...

1362
01:39:19,027 --> 01:39:21,188
...I did it in self-defence.

1363
01:39:44,887 --> 01:39:46,718
What's a diaphragm?

1364
01:39:48,156 --> 01:39:49,453
I don't know.

1365
01:39:55,597 --> 01:39:57,292
"On the first count...

1366
01:39:57,533 --> 01:40:01,401
...citing premeditated murder
in the first degree...

1367
01:40:01,703 --> 01:40:05,002
...we, the jury, find the defendant...

1368
01:40:08,577 --> 01:40:09,703
...guilty.

1369
01:40:10,712 --> 01:40:12,009
On the second count...

1370
01:40:12,247 --> 01:40:14,943
...citing willful mutilation
and mayhem...

1371
01:40:15,884 --> 01:40:18,910
...we, the jury,
find the defendant...."

1372
01:40:19,154 --> 01:40:21,349
Guilty?
How could they find her guilty?

1373
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,388
But, Wiley, she is.

1374
01:40:23,592 --> 01:40:24,889
I don't understand.

1375
01:40:25,093 --> 01:40:27,027
Well, we tried to tell her, Mama.

1376
01:40:27,429 --> 01:40:29,363
But she had to have her say.

1377
01:40:30,399 --> 01:40:31,866
Well, she had it.

1378
01:40:32,234 --> 01:40:34,202
She gambled and she lost.

1379
01:40:35,537 --> 01:40:37,505
Now it's up to the judge.

1380
01:40:43,745 --> 01:40:44,734
Sheriff.

1381
01:40:45,681 --> 01:40:47,774
It's a pleasure to place you
under arrest...

1382
01:40:47,983 --> 01:40:50,577
...for violating the civil rights
of Taylor Jackson.

1383
01:40:50,786 --> 01:40:52,754
What is this? Tyrone, it's okay.

1384
01:40:52,988 --> 01:40:56,355
-You'll never make this stick.
-Well, you're probably right.

1385
01:40:56,858 --> 01:41:00,487
I'll have to settle on making your life
hell the next three or four years.

1386
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:11,364
Nobody's gonna thank you
for that, boy.

1387
01:41:21,083 --> 01:41:24,917
Was that your idea,
telling all that on the stand?

1388
01:41:26,321 --> 01:41:27,549
Yes, sir.

1389
01:41:27,823 --> 01:41:29,154
I'm sorry.

1390
01:41:29,791 --> 01:41:32,259
I didn't think about it first.
I just said it.

1391
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:34,655
Well, you said it in an open court.

1392
01:41:35,097 --> 01:41:37,122
That means we'll have to testify.

1393
01:41:37,766 --> 01:41:39,757
You can't back away from it now.

1394
01:41:40,769 --> 01:41:42,737
Yes, sir. I know.

1395
01:41:49,678 --> 01:41:51,009
Thank you, Peejoe.

1396
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:04,819
Well, I can send you down to Draper...

1397
01:42:05,627 --> 01:42:09,620
...but I don't think prisons were
designed for people like you.

1398
01:42:09,831 --> 01:42:13,028
Or I could send you
up to Bryce Hospital...

1399
01:42:13,969 --> 01:42:18,406
...and let the head shrinkers
take a shot at you.

1400
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:22,007
But I gotta tell you something.
I have a little feeling about you.

1401
01:42:22,477 --> 01:42:25,810
You got a little devil in you.
You'd charm your way out of there.

1402
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,016
You'd just skedaddle right out.

1403
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:29,774
No, I wouldn't, I promise.

1404
01:42:30,018 --> 01:42:31,042
Also...

1405
01:42:31,753 --> 01:42:33,482
...I could sentence you...

1406
01:42:34,156 --> 01:42:35,919
...to the electric chair.

1407
01:42:37,426 --> 01:42:38,654
And maybe...

1408
01:42:39,995 --> 01:42:42,054
...that's what the jury intended.

1409
01:42:43,765 --> 01:42:45,357
But I have never...

1410
01:42:45,867 --> 01:42:49,064
...sent a lady
to the electric chair...

1411
01:42:49,871 --> 01:42:51,498
...and I never will.

1412
01:42:53,275 --> 01:42:55,243
So here we are, my friends.

1413
01:42:55,677 --> 01:42:58,475
You're guilty, but I haven't seen
a shred of evidence...

1414
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:00,579
...that says you are a danger...

1415
01:43:00,916 --> 01:43:04,682
...to anybody or anything
except Chester Vinson.

1416
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:06,319
And let's face it:

1417
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:07,647
Bon soir.

1418
01:43:07,889 --> 01:43:10,380
It's too late for him, right?

1419
01:43:11,226 --> 01:43:15,595
So there's something else you should
know, my darling. I have sat here...

1420
01:43:15,797 --> 01:43:20,496
...and I have seen
our good white juries return...

1421
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:23,704
...verdicts that were...

1422
01:43:24,039 --> 01:43:26,303
...unbelievably stupid.

1423
01:43:29,544 --> 01:43:30,841
But they did.

1424
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:35,683
And I have seen men so guilty...

1425
01:43:37,552 --> 01:43:38,712
...and yet...

1426
01:43:39,554 --> 01:43:41,579
...they were allowed to go free.

1427
01:43:44,226 --> 01:43:45,625
So here you are...

1428
01:43:47,929 --> 01:43:49,260
...and here I am.

1429
01:43:52,734 --> 01:43:54,895
But it's my turn now, dear.

1430
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:01,038
I sentence you to 20 years.

1431
01:44:01,576 --> 01:44:03,237
Hold it. Hold it.

1432
01:44:04,813 --> 01:44:07,304
But I suspend that sentence...

1433
01:44:08,316 --> 01:44:11,149
...and I sentence you to five years...

1434
01:44:11,586 --> 01:44:13,110
...five years of probation...

1435
01:44:13,321 --> 01:44:16,154
...during which time
you have to seek...

1436
01:44:16,525 --> 01:44:18,186
...the help of a psychiatrist...

1437
01:44:18,393 --> 01:44:21,157
...during the whole time.
You understand that?

1438
01:44:21,363 --> 01:44:22,853
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

1439
01:44:23,932 --> 01:44:24,830
So...

1440
01:44:27,269 --> 01:44:28,361
...you're free to go.

1441
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:34,703
Travesty of justice!

1442
01:44:44,052 --> 01:44:45,349
This is an outrage!

1443
01:44:45,554 --> 01:44:46,816
Oh, shut up!

1444
01:44:47,122 --> 01:44:49,181
Judicial misconduct, Your Honour!

1445
01:44:49,558 --> 01:44:50,957
This case is adjourned!

1446
01:44:51,193 --> 01:44:52,387
God bless Judge Mead!

1447
01:45:11,880 --> 01:45:14,280
I wondered what Aunt Lucille
said to that judge...

1448
01:45:14,516 --> 01:45:16,780
... to make him change his mind
about her.

1449
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:21,122
She just smiled and said
he was one of those rare men...

1450
01:45:21,323 --> 01:45:25,350
... that knew the difference between
justice and what's just.

1451
01:45:26,761 --> 01:45:28,092
In all that excitement...

1452
01:45:28,330 --> 01:45:31,163
...I thought she'd forgotten
all about me and Wiley.

1453
01:45:37,672 --> 01:45:39,299
Well, I guess I was wrong.

1454
01:45:53,121 --> 01:45:56,488
We can squeeze these guys
into the hearse. Is that okay?

1455
01:45:58,426 --> 01:45:59,552
Oh, no.

1456
01:46:05,533 --> 01:46:07,831
Your timing is perfect.

1457
01:46:08,937 --> 01:46:10,370
I knew you were innocent.

1458
01:46:12,908 --> 01:46:14,899
I knew it the whole damn time.

1459
01:46:18,613 --> 01:46:20,205
Want to go for a ride?

1460
01:46:20,448 --> 01:46:21,506
Go!

1461
01:46:37,265 --> 01:46:38,755
I can't believe it.

1462
01:46:39,968 --> 01:46:42,801
I guess the judge said
it had to be integrated.

1463
01:46:43,905 --> 01:46:46,874
He didn't say nothing about
there having to be water in it.

1464
01:46:47,642 --> 01:46:49,542
Now you the same as us.

1465
01:46:49,911 --> 01:46:51,469
Ain't nobody allowed to swim.

1466
01:46:53,114 --> 01:46:54,741
That's so stupid.

1467
01:46:57,419 --> 01:46:59,410
You took the patch off your eye.

1468
01:47:02,023 --> 01:47:03,888
I can see light through it now.

1469
01:47:04,259 --> 01:47:06,227
Maybe you just had to let it heal.

1470
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:07,889
Come on. Let's go.

1471
01:47:11,466 --> 01:47:13,058
You can drive by today...

1472
01:47:13,268 --> 01:47:15,862
...and never know there was
a pool there at all.

1473
01:47:16,504 --> 01:47:18,131
But I know the secret.

1474
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:21,441
There's water trapped underneath
all that cement.

1475
01:47:21,776 --> 01:47:23,471
Three inches of water...

1476
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:26,372
...as blue as Lucille's eyes.

1477
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:39,316
I learned a lot of secrets
that summer.

1478
01:47:39,527 --> 01:47:42,963
You can bury freedom,
but you can't kill it.

1479
01:47:43,732 --> 01:47:46,200
Taylor Jackson died for freedom.

1480
01:47:46,401 --> 01:47:48,767
Aunt Lucille had to kill to get it.

1481
01:47:49,537 --> 01:47:52,005
Life and death are only temporary...

1482
01:47:52,307 --> 01:47:55,276
...but freedom goes on forever.
