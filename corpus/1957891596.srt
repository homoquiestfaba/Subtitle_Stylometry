1
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:37,237
Sorry, I'm not here.

2
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,306
Hey, I just wanted
to talk.

3
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,409
One of these days,
maybe you will, too.

4
00:00:42,644 --> 00:00:44,478
I, um, I know
you have a lot

5
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:45,747
going through your head
right now.

6
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,515
I think we all do.

7
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,183
And I know this isn't
exactly the curve ball

8
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,753
you were expecting--

9
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:53,755
shit, more like a cannon ball,
really,

10
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:58,425
but I just want you to know
that you're not alone.

11
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:01,328
I'm scared shitless.

12
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,332
I just can't stop wondering
if--

13
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,136
if we're doing
the right thing here, you know?

14
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,438
I know you said
this is for the best, but--

15
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,308
I just can't justify it.
I don't know.

16
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,310
I guess what I'm really
trying to say is,

17
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,679
the silver lining
to this whole mess

18
00:01:17,712 --> 00:01:23,618
is that I guess
I think I love you.

19
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,253
Aww!

20
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,656
So, um, yeah. I know
you're working or whatever,

21
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,592
but call me
when you get a chance.

22
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,360
Just want to make sure
we're still good for tonight.

23
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,362
See you soon.

24
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,130
The "L" word, huh?

25
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,701
Yeah. Hormones.

26
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:41,869
Hormones.

27
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,871
Hormones, my dick, man,
she digs ya!

28
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:48,442
This? This is hormones.
Little wobbly down there, huh?

29
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,277
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

30
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,847
You don't gotta be sorry
to me, man.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,816
My arm's cramping
like a motherfucker.

32
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:06,259
Hmm.
So you're a quitter now, huh?

33
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,795
I guess so.

34
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,530
Huh.

35
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,372
I'm sorry, its... I just--

36
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,408
I mean, do you think
she really meant that?

37
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,144
Or is she just
saying that because--

38
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,582
and I barely even know her.

39
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:30,384
I don't know, it's just...
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,753
You don't want
to hear this crap.

41
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:36,256
I just...
I just want her to be happy.

42
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:39,794
Worst case of ED
I'd ever seen.

43
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,264
- I don't have ED, I just...
-Emotional dependency.

44
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,904
Emotional dependency.
I don't know which one's worse.

45
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:53,206
Two peas in a shitty pod, huh?

46
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,877
Ain't the pea-pod
that's shitty, my man,

47
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,280
it's the roots.
Well, I've got to get back home.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,349
Wait, wait. You're leaving?
Wh... why?

49
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,619
I got so much stuff
I have to do before tomorrow.

50
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,486
Can you please just hang?

51
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,321
Just for a second, please?
Just this once?

52
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,725
- I... I can't.
-Um, ah, how's D?

53
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,460
Is he ready
for the big day tomorrow?

54
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:17,264
Want to see what the little
shithead did this morning?

55
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:23,403
No!
Is that his cake for tomorrow?

56
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:24,739
Yep.

57
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,944
What? He ate that much?
Are you sure it wasn't Lola?

58
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:33,548
Lola was at the vet
this morning, remember?

59
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,282
Just... wait, check it.

60
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,953
- Ooh, is that--
- Puke?

61
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,888
Yep.
Bet yer ass it is.

62
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:43,725
A big ol' pile of puke
right in the middle of his bed.

63
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:45,325
Little fucker tried
to make his bed

64
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,260
on top of the pile of puke,
just to hide it.

65
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,429
I spent all afternoon
cleaning that shit up.

66
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,298
Oh! The smell.

67
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,600
If I tell you something,

68
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,334
you promise
you won't get pissed?

69
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,370
It smelled a little puke-y when
you got in the car just now.

70
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,773
Oh, motherfucker!

71
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,041
And you weren't
even gonna say nothing?

72
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:01,576
I didn't want to be rude!

73
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,578
Come on, man! Huh!
I smell like puke,

74
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,313
my whole entire apartment
smells like puke.

75
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,815
Got my entire family
coming over tomorrow,

76
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,550
it's just gonna be
one giant fucking puke-fest,

77
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:12,053
with no goddamned birthday
cake! Fuck.

78
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,756
Mother fucking,
mother of the year.

79
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,962
Strange being a parent.

80
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,563
John says 'hi' to me the
wrong way

81
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:24,464
and I just wanna fucking
castrate him.

82
00:04:24,966 --> 00:04:26,801
And this dude pukes
all over my shit.

83
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,936
I just can't wait to get home
and see him.

84
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:32,507
Guess that's love, huh?

85
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,942
Or ED.

86
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:45,686
Oh, motherfucker! It's
on... it's on me! Fuck!

87
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,488
My whole fucking car's gonna
smell like fucking milk puke!

88
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:49,757
I got something.

89
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,358
- God damn!
- Wait one second, wait.

90
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,960
Fuck!

91
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,600
Fuckin' shit.

92
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,569
Here. Here, here.

93
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:03,838
It's not the most chic,
but, you know,

94
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,073
at least your car won't smell
like a dairy dumpster.

95
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:08,509
Heh-- I don't know
why you're cracking jokes, dude,

96
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:11,546
you still let me tug away at
that shit, smelling like this.

97
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,447
I'll give it a--
oh wait, I'll wash it

98
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:15,750
and I'll give it back
to you tomorrow.

99
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,484
Ah, yeah, don't worry about it.

100
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,856
Oh, uh, there's something else
I want you to have here.

101
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,096
Sorry I didn't have time
to wrap it.

102
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,331
I had to go to, like,
three stores before I fo...

103
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,802
This is the one
he wanted, right?

104
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,571
The Purple Plower?
I thought you said that--

105
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,739
Yeah.

106
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:44,512
Thanks.
That... he's gonna love it.

107
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:46,981
Ha.

108
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,155
Is this hug gonna cost me
an extra five bucks?

109
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,624
Hmm.

110
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:19,814
Still want to do this?
It ain't too late, you know.

111
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,718
Yeah, it is.
It's about nine months too late.

112
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,061
- Well, then, do you got cash?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,035
Here.

114
00:06:49,944 --> 00:06:53,446
Thanks...

115
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,218
Oh, and uh I still want to pay--
Oh, shit!

116
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,786
What the hell
are you doing, man?!

117
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,888
- I'm sorry. Oopsie--
- No! Fuck! No!

118
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:01,956
Okay, okay, okay.

119
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,824
Shit, calm down, man!

120
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,694
And you don't have to pay me
for the... that.

121
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,162
No no, don't be silly.
I still--

122
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,964
I got it. I got it.

123
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,599
I normally don't do
that sort of thing,

124
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,668
so just accept it
before I take it back.

125
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:18,105
Look, there's-- there's other
ways of getting the money,
you know.

126
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:23,644
This is like a zero sum business
that you're fucking with.

127
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:28,115
Look, I'm in no business
to be giving advice.

128
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:31,218
Nor should anyone listen to a
goddamned thing that
I have to say,

129
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:33,120
but I will say this.

130
00:07:33,154 --> 00:07:35,556
All your actions
have consequences, man.

131
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,224
Just because
you can't see 'em

132
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:39,459
doesn't mean that they're not
fucking shit up elsewhere.

133
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:44,899
Just like the shitty roots
to your shitty pea-pod.

134
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:49,469
Just don't fix that shit
at the roots,

135
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:54,608
it'll just... keep on spreading.

136
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,145
Kinda like that puke smell,
huh?

137
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:03,617
That's why I changed.
Why I gotta go.

138
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,088
Good luck, pal.

139
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:09,590
- See you next week?
- I hope not.

140
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,095
Have fun tomorrow at the--

141
00:08:57,338 --> 00:09:00,341
As we continue
to rock at KBILLY Bonanza

142
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:06,147
with another tune from Bobby
Day, only on K-B-I-L-L-Y,

143
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,551
the home of rock.

144
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,321
Say you're sorry.

145
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,822
No, I will not say
I'm sorry,

146
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,991
because,
A.) I'm not fucking sorry,

147
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,960
and B.) I'm not sorry
that I'm not fucking sorry.

148
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,728
Ow!

149
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,230
and C.) you should be--
and C.) looking for Beaux?

150
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,032
Yeah.

151
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,800
And C.) you should be sorry!

152
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,368
Whatever. I'm over it!

153
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,270
Would the two of you
just stop until we get there?

154
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:46,473
Jesus! This isn't the time
or the place. Sorry about that!

155
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,376
You just don't get it,
do you, like...

156
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:52,780
How was I supposed to know
you got drug-tested at work?

157
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,081
I'm not your fucking husband.

158
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,482
Oh, Jesus!
Is this about the ring?

159
00:11:55,517 --> 00:11:57,251
Fine. You can have mine!

160
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,186
Oh, is that how you feel?
Fine.

161
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,188
Then take mine, too!
That's just great!

162
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:03,224
Oh, you two can both
suck my ass.

163
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:05,059
If this is how the whole
arrangement is gonna go on

164
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,927
from now on
because a couple of rings,

165
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:08,862
you can count me out,
bunch of fucking queens!

166
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,064
Fine, then.

167
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,832
Fine!

168
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:21,976
So, ah... do you
all get drug-tested?

169
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:23,944
You heard that?

170
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:29,116
Uh, I mean, I wasn't trying to,
it's just you guys--

171
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,118
you guys like drugs?

172
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,387
Sweetie, as I was just
telling these two infants,

173
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,989
we live in Los Angeles...

174
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:36,390
if you don't have a drug
or alcohol problem,

175
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,158
you're doing it wrong.

176
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,927
Oh, just because I happen
to like my job, that means--

177
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,195
Oh, no need
to whisper now, honey,

178
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,896
the fat lady's belting
an encore!

179
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,132
Whatever, you fucking
drug addict! There!

180
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,035
Okay, no. Fuck this.
Could you pull over, please?

181
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,203
Yeah, just pull over.

182
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,505
Get that cardio, honey,

183
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,406
try not to buy any crack
on your way home!

184
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,807
- Please just keep driving.
- Cause you're a drug addict!

185
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,476
- Sorry.
- Crackhead.

186
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,012
- Stop being such a bitch!
- Thank you. Wait, me or him?

187
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:00,848
You, Beaux, Jesus! We're just
trying to look out for you!

188
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,416
Well, stop!

189
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,485
I'm not your fucking husband,
I'm not your child,

190
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,153
I'm just some guy
that both of you fuck

191
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:09,156
because you two
are bored with each other!

192
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:18,032
I can't believe
you just said that.

193
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,805
Mind if I say something?

194
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,408
Wish someone would.

195
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,277
I think it's pretty cool.

196
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,514
You know,
the whole gay marriage thing.

197
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:34,281
Oh, Jesus Christ,

198
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,050
next you're gonna tell us
you voted for Obama, right?

199
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,420
It feels like Thanksgiving
all over again.

200
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:41,288
Voting for Obama twice.
I did that.

201
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,390
No, no. Not that.

202
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,528
Like, how you two
are married and all,

203
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:50,331
but still do your thing
with him, as a couple? Is...

204
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,534
Did I get that right?

205
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,835
Eavesdrop much?

206
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,538
Yeah.

207
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:02,076
Yeah, by the way,
I did vote for Obama. Twice.

208
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,345
Oh, my God.

209
00:14:04,378 --> 00:14:06,313
Okay, one more thing.

210
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:07,615
I mean, as cool as it sounds

211
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,584
is, like,
the open relationship thing,

212
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:13,220
is it really worth it?
With all the fighting?

213
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:15,356
We're not fighting
about that.

214
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:17,091
Oh, well, what are you
fighting about?

215
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:19,360
Listen, as much
as I appreciate

216
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:21,161
any straight white boy
being woke,

217
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:23,197
trust me,
there's still some shit

218
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,299
straight little ears
just can't comprehend,

219
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:27,334
nor do we care
to hear your opinion.

220
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,970
Don't worry. I don't deserve
to have an opinion.

221
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,205
Why?

222
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,942
Okay, fine. Buckle up, bitch.

223
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,477
This drama queen is pissed
because I gummied

224
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,379
just a little bit of blow
before I ate out his ass.

225
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:40,114
It is not about that!

226
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,348
And now he's worried
he can't pass his drug test.

227
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,150
I'm not mad about the drug test!

228
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,085
You are just not being honest.

229
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:47,655
I wouldn't have even known if
my ass wasn't completely numb!

230
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:50,692
We're not mad, Beaux. We're
just concerned about you using
again.

231
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,493
That's all!

232
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:54,294
Using? Says the girls who
drink G every time we go out!

233
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,296
Oh, stop. That is not
the same thing.

234
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,965
Okay, so okay,
so where's the fucking--

235
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,400
Wait, wait, wait, G?
I don't know what G is.

236
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,934
What's G?

237
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,336
- It's Gamma Hydroxybutyrate.
- GHB.

238
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,438
You know, the date rape drug?

239
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,674
- Yeah.
- Gays chug that shit for fun.

240
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:10,645
- Wait, what, for real?
- Yup.

241
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:13,280
But even though princess
over here flushed my entire

242
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:16,950
eight ball down the shitter
to save me, I'm the bad guy.

243
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,654
I'm the bad guy with no drugs
going to a fucking disco

244
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,188
like a diabetic going to Willy

245
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,257
Wonka's fucking
chocolate factory!

246
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,159
I know a guy, uh, if you--

247
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:26,360
Absolutely not!
He has a problem.

248
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,061
Shut up do you, really?

249
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,430
And we're trying
to work on it.

250
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,633
Okay. So there's the
fucking cutoff?

251
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,135
You girls, you girls can chug G,
snort K, take X,

252
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,970
along with the rest
of the fucking alphabet,

253
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,206
but I do a little bit of blow
and it crosses the line!

254
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,374
Because you lied!

255
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,109
It's ruining your life!

256
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,248
I know I'm just
a straight white dude

257
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,417
and you don't care
to hear my opinion,

258
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,621
but I gotta say being
gay sounds pretty cool.

259
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:56,624
Sweet drugs, tons of sex
with other people

260
00:15:56,658 --> 00:16:00,961
while you're married, discos?
Where do I sign up?

261
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:04,097
Any Equinox is a good start.

262
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:06,668
Got news for you, sweetie.

263
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:09,136
Straight folks can do
all that stuff, too.

264
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,171
We just do it better.
Most of the time.

265
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:13,207
But there is one thing
we all can't do.

266
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,611
Say... sorry?

267
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,716
Well, uh, here we are.

268
00:16:22,584 --> 00:16:24,786
I want to thank you guys
for chatting with me.

269
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:28,790
- Most people, they just kinda--
- Look. Look, I'm sorry. Okay?

270
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:30,658
Honest. It was the drugs.

271
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,763
Is it the drugs now?

272
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:37,699
- No.
- Have a good night.

273
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,034
This my phone?

274
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:53,180
Hey, do you really know a guy

275
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,048
who can hook me up
with some blow?

276
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,585
Um, I uh, um--

277
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,387
No. Sorry, man.

278
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,489
Ah. Okay. Fuck. Okay.

279
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:05,727
By the way, your car smells
like puke. Have a good night.

280
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:09,363
Thanks.

281
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:18,472
Okay... let's go.

282
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:06,253
Fuck.

283
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,635
Uh... Carly?

284
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,870
Yep.

285
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:19,159
Wait... where--

286
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:12,714
So, uh, do you girls want
some-- do you want-- wait, uh...

287
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:17,384
Are you even old enough to--
never mind.

288
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,581
Actually, do you think
you could just drop us off

289
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:55,348
at the next Starbuck's up there?

290
00:21:56,551 --> 00:21:58,986
Yeah. I think there's one up
after the light up here.

291
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,420
Okay.

292
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:10,191
Yeah. Yeah, right here is fine.

293
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:15,863
- Okay. Mm-hmm. All right.
- Thank you, thank you.

294
00:24:56,831 --> 00:25:00,668
So, ah, you like drugs?

295
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:08,142
You, uh, want some blow?

296
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:20,688
How about a little nose candy?

297
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,525
Whaddya think?

298
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:55,256
Hello?

299
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:56,991
Yo, my man, it's me.
Where the hell you at?

300
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,093
I don't see you anywhere.
What you doin'?

301
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:04,065
Uh... I'm exactly where
you told me to pick you up.

302
00:26:04,098 --> 00:26:06,267
Where the hell did I tell
you to pick me up?

303
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:09,103
6925 Hollywood Boulevard.

304
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:11,839
Where the hell's that?

305
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:13,574
Exactly where I am.

306
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,709
Oh, shit!

307
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,178
Are you at that movie
theater place

308
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,846
that kind of looks
like a Chinese restaurant?

309
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,347
Yeah.

310
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:23,017
Oh shit, man,
I'm at Michelle Pfeiffer's star!

311
00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:27,021
- Okay?
- Know where that is?

312
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:29,323
No. No, I don't.

313
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:31,826
Oh shit, dude!
I think that's you right there.

314
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,227
Are you the dude with the DASH
sign parked in front of the

315
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,096
Chinese Theater,
with your four-ways on.

316
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:36,831
Fuck me, I'll be right there.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

317
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:45,940
- Let me get this straight--
- Are you--?

318
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:48,776
Pfeiffer's got a star
and Keaton don't?

319
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,945
I didn't really know that.

320
00:26:50,978 --> 00:26:53,380
Now that is a crock
of fucking bullshit, dude!

321
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:56,083
I guess, but--

322
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:58,919
I heard that dude used to rip
dips like a motherfucker.

323
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:00,321
Is that true?

324
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:02,656
Keaton?
Eh, he's kinda cool, so I bet--

325
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,125
Yeah dude, I'm heading
your way right now.

326
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:05,626
In a DASH as we speak.
No bro, I'm off tomorrow.

327
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,064
No bro, I'm off tomorrow.

328
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:13,267
I go that mandatory
eval bullshit

329
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,002
'cause of what went down today.

330
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:20,374
Stop, man, stop! You sound
like my fucking wife, man.

331
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,943
Don't tell her I said that.
I'll be fine.

332
00:27:22,977 --> 00:27:26,147
I'll be fine, all right?
All right, sick.

333
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,983
Yeah, dope. Should be
there soon, man.

334
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:32,286
Later.
Fuck, man!

335
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,356
I probably sound like a massive
dick right about now, don't I?

336
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:37,825
You partying it up tonight?

337
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,261
Better fucking believe it, son.

338
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:42,062
Yeah?

339
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:43,297
You trying to keep that party
going a little longer?

340
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,666
I'm trying, dude.
Dead-ass tired.

341
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,269
Long, shitty day
at the office, my guy.

342
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:50,905
Oh, I got something
that might wake you up a bit.

343
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:52,673
Hey, you're not a cop, are ya?

344
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:54,708
How'd you guess?

345
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:56,277
Ah, good one.

346
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:59,113
Hmm?

347
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:04,051
Ah, yeah. Sorry. I didn't--

348
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,220
There it is. There it
fucking is, man.

349
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:09,190
- No, it's--
- It's the same fucking look

350
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:11,025
everyone gives me
when they find out.

351
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:14,228
You don't need to freak out,
dude. I'm off duty, relax.

352
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:16,163
I know. I'm not freaking out.
I just--

353
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:18,499
If anything, you should
feel more safe.

354
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:20,768
I've still got my gun
on me and shit.

355
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:25,973
Oh, yeah? Oh yeah, cool.
Shit. That's very cool.

356
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,308
You got any guns?

357
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:29,810
No, no.
I mean, yeah, at home I do.

358
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:31,345
Yeah, what you got?

359
00:28:32,846 --> 00:28:35,783
I got a pistol, a Glock 27.

360
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,318
Okay, okay. Not bad.

361
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:39,787
You should carry that shit
around with you, dude.

362
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,256
You never fucking know
around here anymore.

363
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,324
Trust me.

364
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:48,295
So what's up?

365
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,030
You talkin' to me?

366
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,401
Yeah, dude. You like driving
DASH and shit late at night?

367
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:57,505
I mean, it gets
kinda lonely, but...

368
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,240
What are you
talking about, lonely?

369
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:01,075
You've got motherfuckers
in the back of your car-seat

370
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:02,943
all night long, man!

371
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:05,813
What you mean 'lonely,' probably
see all kinds of weird shit.

372
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:08,482
Not really.
I mean, you're a cop, right?

373
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:10,484
You probably see cooler stuff
than I do.

374
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:13,354
Yeah. Saw someone get
shot today.

375
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:15,222
That's pretty cool. Whoa.

376
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:17,391
It was a six-year-old kid.

377
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:21,095
Sorry to hear that, man.

378
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:23,197
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

379
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:28,002
Serve and protect though, right?
Another day after the office.

380
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,508
City of fucking angels, man.
You got any kids?

381
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,511
No, I don't.

382
00:29:37,512 --> 00:29:39,013
Check this out.

383
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:42,116
I, ah, got a four-year-old
back home.

384
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:45,819
Cute little fucker, isn't he?

385
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:48,222
- He sure is, man.
- He gets that from his daddy.

386
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:50,592
Pretty sure
it's the UPS guy, man.

387
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,560
Nobody gets that many
Amazon packages.

388
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:59,567
The kid wanted an apple juice.

389
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:02,537
In the picture?

390
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,104
The kid that got shot today.

391
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:12,146
Some fucking tweaker
all hopped up on PCP.

392
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:15,349
I didn't even know that was
still a thing anymore, man.

393
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,988
Fucking thought someone
was breaking into his apartment.

394
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:24,124
He was in the middle
of a fucking 7-11.

395
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,429
You like going to work?

396
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:31,298
- Who does, man?
- I used to.

397
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:35,969
Feel like I was putting on
a fucking superhero cape

398
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,838
every day
I put that badge on, man.

399
00:30:39,607 --> 00:30:41,875
Now I feel like
I'm putting a big old bullseye

400
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,410
right here on my chest.

401
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:50,250
I kiss my fucking boy every day
before I go to work, man.

402
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:53,320
Every day. But I spend
my 12-hour day with my heart

403
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:55,122
beating a million
fucking miles an hour,

404
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:57,559
just praying to God
I can do it again, dude.

405
00:30:57,592 --> 00:31:01,061
Shitty feeling. You know
what's even worse than that?

406
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:05,567
Thinkin' you're the hero,

407
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:09,203
but everyone else thinks
you're the bad guy.

408
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,071
Everyone else thinks
you're the villain.

409
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:12,439
I mean, fuck, man.

410
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:14,241
I might as well be
Darth fucking Vader

411
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:15,976
when I put that shit on, dude.

412
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:21,281
But you know what? At least
I wear my fucking cape, man.

413
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:23,350
The scariest ones
don't wear a goddamned thing.

414
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:25,587
They fucking blend
in right with us, dude.

415
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,354
They hide right in plain sight.

416
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:31,559
Fuck, man. I saw your face
when I told you I was a cop.

417
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:33,293
I fucking saw it, man.

418
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,396
Yeah, well-- yeah.

419
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:36,930
Your butt-hole clenched
about this fucking tight.

420
00:31:36,964 --> 00:31:38,465
I can feel it.

421
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:40,434
- No, why would it?
- That's what I'm saying.

422
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:42,403
You seem like a good enough
fucking guy.

423
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,705
Yeah.

424
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:45,573
Got nothing to
worry about, right?

425
00:31:45,607 --> 00:31:47,207
But just knowing I'm a cop--
just knowing I'm a cop made

426
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:48,475
you want to kick my ass
to the curb.

427
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,277
You regret picking me up,
don't you?

428
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,347
- Oh, not at all, man.
- Oh, bull fucking shit, dude.

429
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,215
I can sense that shit
a mile away.

430
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:58,952
But you got random motherfuckers
hopping in the back of your car

431
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:01,021
all night long,
and you don't think twice.

432
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:02,423
You don't think
twice about that.

433
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:04,158
Dude sitting there
could be a rapist.

434
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:06,026
Dude sitting here
could be a drug dealer.

435
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:08,228
This dude could be a murderer.
You don't give a fuck.

436
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:11,031
But me, a dude
trying to stop rapists,

437
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,600
drug dealers and murders,

438
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:14,301
hops back here, and you just
about shit your pants.

439
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:15,737
And to be honest dude,
I think you might have.

440
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,605
It smells
a little wonky back here.

441
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:21,375
I mean, do you think you're
driving around nuns all night?

442
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:24,011
My fucking ass, dude.

443
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:26,714
I mean, fuck, you could be
a drug dealer, for all I know.

444
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:29,316
Yeah, mean, but just
the messed up stuff

445
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:30,752
you see on the news,

446
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:32,286
the cell phone videos
and the body cams--

447
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,689
And those fucking assholes

448
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:37,559
shouldn't have got the job
in the first place, dude.

449
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:39,126
They shouldn't have got
the fucking job.

450
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,961
But that's a broad
generalization,

451
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:43,765
don't you think,
that we're all bad?

452
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:46,133
That one group's all good,
one group's all bad?

453
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:49,136
Dude, that's the same
fucked up mentality

454
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:51,438
that got us
in this mess to begin with.

455
00:32:51,472 --> 00:32:56,578
I mean, dude, John Q. Public has
no idea what it's like, dude.

456
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:58,312
They have no fucking clue.

457
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:01,583
No fucking clue what it's like
to do my job, man.

458
00:33:01,616 --> 00:33:04,552
I mean, what if there was
a camera right fucking there,

459
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:06,420
watching every move
you made, huh?

460
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:10,257
You ever drive too fast?
Not use your turn signal?

461
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,193
Fucking high beams on?
Anything? You ever fuck up?

462
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:16,698
I mean, that's not really
the same thing, not like as--

463
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:18,332
Okay. Okay, I'll give you that.

464
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:20,334
I'll give you that.
But imagine this now.

465
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,103
Imagine the dude
you just picked up

466
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,239
is all hopped up on PCP, right?

467
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:28,041
And there's a gun pointing
at your fucking head,

468
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,210
ready to pull that trigger
if you mess up one time.

469
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:31,713
You move too slow--
bang, you're fucking dead.

470
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:33,480
You don't use
that turn signal, bang!

471
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:35,315
You're fucking dead.
You drive too slow, too fast?

472
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:37,519
Bang, you're fucking dead.
Would you be a little tense?

473
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:38,653
Ah, yeah, I mean, yeah.

474
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,420
Mm-hmm.

475
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:45,092
Now imagine if DASH
and the whole fucking world

476
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:48,195
wanted your head
for driving too fast,

477
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,163
to get that guy
out of the car, right?

478
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:55,737
Drive too slow, that guy shoots
a fucking six-year-old kid

479
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,542
on your watch, man.
That look you just gave me--

480
00:34:02,276 --> 00:34:04,712
that's exactly why I'm afraid
to do my job, man.

481
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:09,751
And exactly why
the fucking kid died today.

482
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:17,157
But you know what? I'd take
that look a thousand times over

483
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,627
than seeing the look
on that kid's mom's face.

484
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:24,632
I get it, dude.
I fucking get it, I get it.

485
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:29,102
Rotten apple spoils a bunch,
I suppose.

486
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,707
But you know what?
There's a whole fucking or--

487
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,642
--a whole fucking orchard
out there.

488
00:34:34,676 --> 00:34:37,444
And you know what Mr. Chapman
told me in first grade?

489
00:34:38,278 --> 00:34:40,715
An apple a day keeps
the fucking doctor away, man.

490
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,217
You take away
all them good apples,

491
00:34:44,586 --> 00:34:47,287
them doctors washing plenty
of blood off their hands.

492
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:52,225
Maybe we should wash it off
the orchard's roots first, huh?

493
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:02,870
Oh, my fucking God,
Jesus fucking Christ.

494
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:05,773
My wife is going
to fucking kill me, bro!

495
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:07,240
Jesus, Christ.

496
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:08,643
You got a napkin or
something, dude?

497
00:35:08,676 --> 00:35:11,646
No, dude, get the fuck--
aghhh! Please.

498
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,648
Can I leave this for you?

499
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:15,550
No, get out of here!

500
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:23,658
Thanks a lot.
Yo, sorry, bro! Jesus.

501
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,729
No, no, no, dude! Oh, fuck man!

502
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:31,331
Get this shit--
oh, you fucking--

503
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:36,236
fucking shit, dude!
This is fucking disgusting.

504
00:35:37,672 --> 00:35:42,610
Oh fuck, man! Fuck me!

505
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:51,451
Sorry, babe. Ooh, sorry, babe!
Oh, God! Oh, fuck! Ah, fuck.

506
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:10,638
Jesus fucking Christ.
Fuck.

507
00:36:12,372 --> 00:36:15,576
Ah, shit!

508
00:36:18,412 --> 00:36:20,715
Ah, fuck. Aye.

509
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,587
Uh, Jenny?

510
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,454
Uh-huh.

511
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:45,700
You okay?

512
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:47,434
Allergies.

513
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:54,876
You want me to turn
the heat up?

514
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:57,344
I'm fine.

515
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:20,568
You know, Michael Keaton
doesn't have a star

516
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:22,302
on the Walk of Fame?

517
00:38:23,871 --> 00:38:28,643
I prefer awkward silence.
Thanks.

518
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:49,864
Do you want some blow?

519
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,368
- Just kidding. I didn't--
- Yeah, I'll take a gram.

520
00:38:55,603 --> 00:38:59,607
No, I'm sorry. Wait, what?
For real?

521
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,341
How much? A hundo?

522
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:04,979
Yeah. Yeah.
A hundred dollars, please.

523
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:08,716
Yeah. Let me just pull over,
and I'll get that for you.

524
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:10,450
Yeah.

525
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:20,828
How much did you want, again?

526
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:22,563
Just a gram.

527
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:25,633
Yeah. One sec.

528
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:32,974
You cool?

529
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,910
Yeah, yeah.
Almost ready here.

530
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:50,892
You got a charger?

531
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:52,526
Uh-huh.

532
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:10,678
Yo, what's the hold-up?

533
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:12,813
Ya, I... uh...

534
00:40:13,614 --> 00:40:16,517
I, uh, just have to text my
boy, make sure the
price is right.

535
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,123
Sorry, hang in there.

536
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:30,463
I'll get this for ya. Okay.

537
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:33,000
I know, I know.

538
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:43,978
So no charger, huh.

539
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:45,613
No, I know.

540
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:47,581
Oh yeah, I'll get that
for you in a second.

541
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:54,655
Let me just-- sorry.

542
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:06,133
Almost ready.
Here we go.

543
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:11,939
All righty, then.

544
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:13,774
What the hell is that?

545
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:16,476
Uh. The stuff's inside,
if you know what I mean.

546
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:18,879
Yo, if this is some
type of prank or something,

547
00:41:18,913 --> 00:41:19,981
I don't--

548
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:21,749
No.

549
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:23,617
What is this shit.

550
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:28,289
Oh, Jesus!
Yo, I wanted a gram, man.

551
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:30,091
Oh, is it...
is it not enough?

552
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:31,625
- Enough?
- I can give you some more.

553
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:34,028
More? Is this shit even real?

554
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:37,932
Ugh, yeah, yeah.
Pure AF.

555
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:41,102
Wait. Ah... ? Did you pool?

556
00:41:41,836 --> 00:41:44,171
Oh yeah, yeah.
I'm trying to save some money.

557
00:41:44,905 --> 00:41:47,675
- Do you mind if I--
- No. Do your thing.

558
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,281
Appreciate the honesty.

559
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,719
All right.

560
00:42:02,056 --> 00:42:03,657
Mind if I put on some tunes?

561
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:04,792
Yeah, do your thing.

562
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:10,798
With this little ditty
by Billy Lee Riley from 1957.

563
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:37,017
Goodness!

564
00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:43,657
Oh thank you. No, I don't
want to get in--

565
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:44,992
- No, I don't wanna get in.
- No, I don't want to get in.

566
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:46,660
- Get in the car!
- Okay!

567
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:50,364
- Hi!
- You looking for a Karen?

568
00:43:50,397 --> 00:43:52,166
We don't know
what we're doing here.

569
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:55,836
This is only, like,
our third time ever using DASH.

570
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,705
- Yeah, we're not from
around here. We're on vacation.

571
00:43:57,738 --> 00:43:59,940
- Vacation. From Nebraska.
- Nebraska.

572
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:01,742
Isn't this exciting?!

573
00:44:01,775 --> 00:44:03,978
I know, I know. We're headed
to the Chinese Theater.

574
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:05,813
- Ever been there?
- Uh-huh.

575
00:44:05,846 --> 00:44:06,780
Oh, he knows where it is.

576
00:44:06,814 --> 00:44:08,682
Yeah, oh, good, yeah.

577
00:44:08,716 --> 00:44:10,217
When we travel, we don't like to
do the normal touristy things.

578
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:11,785
We kind of like to get out
and do our own thing.

579
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,254
Yeah, we like
taking in the culture.

580
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:20,394
Where's the map? Let's see,
we're here, and we're going
here.

581
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:23,998
I guess Pauly Shore
lives right there!

582
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:25,266
Well, we'll have to walk by.

583
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:26,934
Of course!

584
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:28,235
Now, what are all
these red spots?

585
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:30,304
Oh, that's where
the Kardashians live.

586
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:32,072
No way!

587
00:44:32,106 --> 00:44:33,941
I know. Did you pack
the breath mints, like I said?

588
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:36,210
Of course, we might be
talking to these people.

589
00:44:36,243 --> 00:44:38,045
I know!

590
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:42,283
Okay now, if we're here,
and here, it is a little dark--

591
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:49,089
You know what?
Could we? I just was--

592
00:44:52,527 --> 00:44:53,861
Could--

593
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:55,162
Would you mind just turning

594
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:56,764
on the overhead light
real quick?

595
00:44:56,797 --> 00:44:58,032
We can't really see back--
oh thank you.

596
00:44:58,065 --> 00:44:59,900
- Thank you.
- That's so much better.

597
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:01,335
All right, don't touch her.
I don't want to wake her up.

598
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:04,038
Oh, ah, yeah.
I think she's high on marijuana.

599
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:05,172
-What?
- Yeah.

600
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:06,774
Oh. Fuck.

601
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:08,008
It's okay, it's California.
It's legal here.

602
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:10,444
- Ah, yeah, um--
- Oh my goodness!

603
00:45:10,477 --> 00:45:12,012
- Woah!
- I'm so sorry.

604
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:13,814
Oh wow, that was fast!

605
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:14,448
Yeah.

606
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:16,350
P. F. Chang's?

607
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:17,519
- Is this the Chinese Theater?
- I thought it was the TCL?

608
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:18,986
Yeah, right here, this is it.

609
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:20,988
It looks different.

610
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:22,223
Come on, yeah,
it looks different.

611
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:24,391
- Yeah, I know.
- This is it.

612
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:27,428
I hope you guys, appreciate
it. Enjoy the city.

613
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:31,865
Welcome to LA.
Yeah. Holy fuck.

614
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:35,169
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
Okay.

615
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:50,518
Holy fuck. You're okay.
You're okay,
you're gonna be okay.

616
00:45:50,552 --> 00:45:52,419
You're gonna be fine.

617
00:45:52,453 --> 00:45:56,156
You're gonna be okay. Holy shit.
Holy shit. Holy fucking shit.

618
00:45:57,124 --> 00:46:04,898
Shit! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck. Oh! Shit.

619
00:46:08,402 --> 00:46:15,876
Oh, fuck! Uh? Oh, shit!
Oh my... shit!

620
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:24,285
Um, uh, yeah.
Oh, God! Shit, oh, fuck.

621
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:30,391
Eh, eh, fuck.
Fuck. Fucking fuck!

622
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:40,901
Fuck. Fuck.
Oh, fuck!

623
00:46:45,507 --> 00:46:49,009
Holy, shit!
Oh, God, oh God, oh God.

624
00:46:49,043 --> 00:46:58,586
Oh God! Oh, God.
Oh, God! Oh, God. Holy shit.

625
00:47:02,923 --> 00:47:12,132
Oh, ah-- Mmmbop, ba duba bop
Mmmbop, ba duba bop mmmbop,
Ba du bop bop. Fuck Fuck.

626
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:29,183
Fuck. Oh God.

627
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:34,488
Oh shit. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

628
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:36,223
Fuck!

629
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:49,103
Hey, what's happening?

630
00:47:49,136 --> 00:47:51,905
Whoa, look at that!
He answered! Whatcha doing?

631
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:53,307
What do you mean?

632
00:47:53,575 --> 00:47:55,376
You're supposed to
be here by now.

633
00:47:58,379 --> 00:48:00,247
Ah, I'm so.. Fuck!
Yeah, yeah.

634
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,083
That's right. I'm on my way.
Dropping off a passenger now.

635
00:48:04,084 --> 00:48:06,120
You're not lying,
are you?

636
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:08,255
No. Of course not! Why?

637
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:12,059
I don't know,
you sound... frazzled.

638
00:48:13,026 --> 00:48:14,428
Like you're on drugs.

639
00:48:14,461 --> 00:48:17,398
Ha, me?! Drugs?! No!

640
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:20,467
Okay. Just hurry, please?
We cannot be late again.

641
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:23,070
And by that,
I mean I am fucking starving

642
00:48:23,103 --> 00:48:24,471
and I really want some pizza,

643
00:48:24,506 --> 00:48:26,340
but I can't eat
until after the doctor.

644
00:48:27,174 --> 00:48:29,009
Oh!
You know what sounds so good,

645
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:31,011
what I've been craving
since, like, last Friday?

646
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:33,414
And by last Friday,
I mean, like, six months ago?

647
00:48:34,014 --> 00:48:36,016
Sushi.
How am I supposed to believe

648
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:38,018
that this mercury thing
is like bad for a baby?

649
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:40,588
Like, I've been drinking coffee,
and everything seems fine.

650
00:48:40,622 --> 00:48:42,189
You know what? Whatever.
Doesn't matter.

651
00:48:42,222 --> 00:48:44,024
Being pregnant sucks.

652
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:47,194
Yeah, but, but, you're
so good at it!

653
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:50,598
Yeah, something's wrong.
I can tell.

654
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:53,701
What do you mean?

655
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:56,970
You're... talking.

656
00:48:58,138 --> 00:48:59,607
Hello?

657
00:48:59,641 --> 00:49:03,410
Ah, yeah, no,
I guess I'm just... nervous.

658
00:49:03,444 --> 00:49:06,113
Yes.
About stuff.

659
00:49:06,146 --> 00:49:07,615
Why are you freaking out?

660
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:09,617
I'm the one trying
to get this baby out of me.

661
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:13,353
Ya there?

662
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:16,490
Yeah, yeah. You bet.
See you soon!

663
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:19,259
Okay. Just let me know
when you're a few minutes away.

664
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:20,994
I'll be out. Bye.

665
00:49:21,495 --> 00:49:25,733
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

666
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:28,068
Come on,
answer your fucking phone.

667
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:29,604
Answer your fucking phone!

668
00:49:32,172 --> 00:49:33,541
Hello?

669
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:34,576
What the fuck kind of drugs
did you sell me?

670
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:36,176
There's a dead g--

671
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,545
Whoa, you said the F-word...

672
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,714
Hey, D. How's it going,
little buddy?

673
00:49:39,747 --> 00:49:41,114
Who is this?

674
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:43,016
Is your mommy home?

675
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,719
You said a bad word, mister!

676
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:46,521
I'm a good friend
of your mom's, pal.

677
00:49:47,287 --> 00:49:48,989
Can I please talk to her now?

678
00:49:49,757 --> 00:49:51,458
It's my birthday tomorrow!

679
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:54,495
Yeah, yeah, I know it's your
birthday tomorrow, little buddy.

680
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:57,364
But can I please, please, please
just talk to your mom now?

681
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,133
Say, "pretty please."

682
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:04,304
Pretty please.

683
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:06,106
With sugar on top.

684
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:07,675
Put your fucking mom
on the phone, you little shit!

685
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:09,577
Give me that phone,
you little shit!

686
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:11,579
Oh hey, yeah, I know left
my cigarettes in your car.

687
00:50:11,613 --> 00:50:13,748
What the fuck did you
sell me, Kalli?

688
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:15,583
Uh-huh, nope.
Start again.

689
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:18,786
Ta fuck did you
sell me, Kalli?

690
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,454
Nope.
I ain't gonna talk to you

691
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:22,055
until you calm down
and chill the fuck out!

692
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:23,558
Calm down? Calm down?

693
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:25,627
That shit you sold me
fucking killed someone!

694
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:31,164
Hello?

695
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,767
You have the
wrong number.

696
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,636
Stop fucking with me, Kalli!

697
00:50:35,235 --> 00:50:38,205
- Are you arrested?
- No! Oh my God.

698
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:39,541
What did you fucking do man?

699
00:50:39,574 --> 00:50:42,610
Well, shit, man.
That sucks.

700
00:50:42,644 --> 00:50:44,646
I don't know what to tell you.

701
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:47,114
I told you not to fuck
with that heroin shit.

702
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:49,216
What?! What?! Heroin?!

703
00:50:49,784 --> 00:50:52,119
Yeah. That's what
you wanted.

704
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:54,622
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no. I wanted smack.

705
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:57,357
Ta fuck
do you think smack is?

706
00:50:57,391 --> 00:51:00,127
Crack? Cocaine?
Crack cocaine!

707
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,263
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Sweetie, you got pure white H.

708
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:06,568
You're supposed
to re-cut it before you--

709
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:08,870
Wait, you thought
you were selling blow?

710
00:51:08,903 --> 00:51:10,638
Yes!

711
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:14,408
Are you laughing?
Are you laughing?

712
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:16,176
Are you seriously
fucking laughing right now?

713
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:17,879
You think this is funny?

714
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:20,515
Oh! Where did you
leave her?
- She's in my trunk!

715
00:51:22,215 --> 00:51:23,818
Did you say your trunk?

716
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:26,386
Yes! Yes, yes, she is
in my trunk.

717
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:29,356
No, no, no, no, no, no.

718
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:31,325
No, I am not fucking
with you, Kalli!

719
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:34,796
Ha! You're weird.
I've got puke to clean. Bye.

720
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:38,833
Wait, no, no, no, no, stop!
Fucking stupid fucking bitch.

721
00:51:41,168 --> 00:51:42,637
You fucking--I'm in some
serious shit here--

722
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,838
Hey hun, sorry I didn't...

723
00:51:43,871 --> 00:51:45,907
Whoa.
Everything okay?

724
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:50,511
Oh. Ha. Hey, babe. Sorry
about that. Everything's cool.

725
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:53,581
You sound
a bit... frazzled.

726
00:51:54,348 --> 00:51:57,885
Uh. I'm not frazzled,
I'm just, uh, excited.

727
00:51:58,753 --> 00:52:00,454
For what?

728
00:52:02,657 --> 00:52:04,559
Pizza.

729
00:52:04,592 --> 00:52:06,360
I thought you said
we were having Thai food?

730
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:08,228
Yes. Of course.
Yes, right, Thai.

731
00:52:08,261 --> 00:52:09,831
That's what I meant.

732
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:11,633
Oh, dog shit sounds
appetizing at this point.

733
00:52:11,666 --> 00:52:14,167
It's been a hell of a night.
Seriously doing

734
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:16,169
whole 30 next month, too. Ugh.

735
00:52:16,203 --> 00:52:18,338
Hey, is my extra coat in there?
Mine is filthy.

736
00:52:18,372 --> 00:52:20,842
I thought I left it in the back.
Can you check the trunk for me?

737
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:22,677
Ya, ya, ya.
It's in here somewhere.

738
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,779
I'll grab it when you
pick me up later tonight.

739
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:26,748
Are you stressed or something?

740
00:52:26,781 --> 00:52:28,482
Um, no. No. Not at all. Why?

741
00:52:28,516 --> 00:52:31,351
I can hear you chomping
on that damn Nicorette.

742
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:35,155
Please don't smoke.
I am so proud of you
for quitting.

743
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,859
Shit! I've gotta go.
Talk soon. Okay?

744
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:39,627
Okay, I love--

745
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:44,197
Fuck! Come on. Fucking Kalli.

746
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:53,273
Answer your fucking phone!

747
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:56,443
I fucking know you are! Errr!

748
00:52:58,813 --> 00:53:04,786
Cocksucking motherfucker!
Aaaahhhhhhh! Fuck, Kalli!

749
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:10,490
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Ah.
Fuckin' A!

750
00:53:10,858 --> 00:53:12,860
Please leave your
message for 8--

751
00:53:14,428 --> 00:53:16,564
Fuck.

752
00:53:30,745 --> 00:53:33,915
Shit! Fucking shit.

753
00:53:34,515 --> 00:53:42,557
Oh my... fucking shit!
Holy fuck! Oh, God.

754
00:53:48,996 --> 00:53:50,898
Oh, this stupid belly.

755
00:53:52,299 --> 00:53:54,267
- Hey.
- Hi.

756
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:57,505
Hi. How ya feeling?

757
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:04,311
- Ugh. Did you see "Jaws 2"?
- Uh. I don't know.

758
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,716
The movie, "Jaws 2,"
have you seen it?

759
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:13,020
Oh. Yeah, I think so. Why?

760
00:54:13,487 --> 00:54:15,455
I kind of feel like that dead
beached whale

761
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:18,593
whose insides burst out.
Closest thing I can think of.

762
00:54:19,326 --> 00:54:20,762
I could probably eat
that beached whale,

763
00:54:20,795 --> 00:54:21,929
come to think of it.

764
00:54:21,963 --> 00:54:23,430
Mm-hmm?

765
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:24,899
Which reminds me,
did you see my post?

766
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,502
Oh, yeah, I did. It's funny.

767
00:54:28,903 --> 00:54:31,606
Maybe one of these days
it'll funny enough to "like."

768
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,340
Yeah.

769
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:40,615
Are you-- you got the whole
pack of gum in your mouth,

770
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:41,983
or what?
Can I get a piece?

771
00:54:42,016 --> 00:54:47,855
Oh yeah, go ahead.
Sorry, it's right there.

772
00:54:47,889 --> 00:54:49,289
Oh. I'm starving.

773
00:54:54,028 --> 00:54:55,997
So how's work? Any weirdos?

774
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:59,332
- No, same-old, same-old.
- People are so gross.

775
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,036
They could be murders
or drug dealers, you know?

776
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:04,038
For real.
I listen to "Crime Junkies."

777
00:55:04,872 --> 00:55:07,008
That, or they're, like,
wiping their boogers

778
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:08,743
and farting all over your seats.

779
00:55:09,744 --> 00:55:12,079
No boogers or murderers yet.

780
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,916
I'm going to be honest,
it smells like a fart in here.

781
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:17,450
You should pay
to get this car detailed.

782
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:18,953
I wish.

783
00:55:19,587 --> 00:55:21,354
I'm a little strapped
at the moment.

784
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:22,790
Got a baby to pay for.

785
00:55:25,392 --> 00:55:28,996
Yeah. Well, I appreciate you.

786
00:55:30,598 --> 00:55:36,070
Damn, this gum's got a kick!
I appreciate you stepping up.

787
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,907
Yeah, well half my fault,
right?

788
00:55:39,941 --> 00:55:41,542
I'm serious.

789
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:43,044
Most guys woulda run
for the fucking hills.

790
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:46,514
I would have too, if you didn't
convince me otherwise.

791
00:55:46,547 --> 00:55:49,083
- Hey, you wouldn't have.
- No, I would have.

792
00:55:49,116 --> 00:55:51,853
I've had, like,
nine other late-term abortions.

793
00:55:52,854 --> 00:55:54,421
Tenth would have been free.

794
00:55:56,757 --> 00:55:58,659
That was a joke.

795
00:55:59,861 --> 00:56:01,562
Good-- good one.

796
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:05,066
I know you put a girl in here.

797
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:08,002
What?

798
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:10,805
In here.
This fat-ass stomach of mine.

799
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:13,174
I really think it's a girl.

800
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:15,710
Oh yeah, how do you know?

801
00:56:15,743 --> 00:56:17,912
Partly because of some shit
I read on Pinterest.

802
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:21,816
But mostly because I don't think
it's possible for a boy

803
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:24,051
to stay in my life
for eight months.

804
00:56:24,085 --> 00:56:25,853
Da duh pssshh.

805
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:30,591
Ouch. I've been around
for eight, right?

806
00:56:31,626 --> 00:56:33,460
'Cause you planted
your seed in me.

807
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:36,396
No, I didn't-- I just--

808
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:40,568
Oh my God, I didn't mean
to get you all frazzled.

809
00:56:41,669 --> 00:56:43,104
I'm not frazzled.

810
00:56:43,137 --> 00:56:47,842
I'm ah, I'm just stressed
about, you know, yeah.

811
00:56:49,677 --> 00:56:53,581
I just-- I just want everything
to go right for a change.

812
00:56:56,984 --> 00:56:58,819
Yeah. I feel ya.

813
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:03,190
You know, this whole thing
didn't seem right.

814
00:57:03,224 --> 00:57:04,959
Hey, sorry
I missed you.

815
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:06,661
I just realized
we didn't decide on dinner.

816
00:57:06,694 --> 00:57:08,195
Surprise me.
I trust you.

817
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:11,065
Just please,
don't pick pizza.

818
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:13,167
- I already feel so fat.
- I'm really fucking glad you
convinced me

819
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,769
to change my fucked up mind.

820
00:57:14,802 --> 00:57:15,736
Sorry if I
seem distracted...

821
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:16,871
It's not fair to you.

822
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:20,007
This place just never stops.

823
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:22,510
Okay, call you later.

824
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:24,078
I love you.

825
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:28,683
I couldn't be happier that we
decided to let things play out.

826
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:36,624
Hey, okay, huh?

827
00:57:36,657 --> 00:57:37,658
Yeah.

828
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:39,560
What did you tell me?

829
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:43,864
It's gonna be hard, but we're
doing the right thing, here.

830
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:47,134
I don't know if I'm capable
of doing the right thing.

831
00:57:47,902 --> 00:57:49,502
Yeah, you are.

832
00:57:49,537 --> 00:57:51,572
I'll just leave out
the part of the story

833
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:53,174
about the drunken one night

834
00:57:53,207 --> 00:57:56,544
stand after the Dave Matthews
concert at The Bowl, hmm?

835
00:57:57,945 --> 00:58:01,048
'Crash into Me,'
every fucking time.

836
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:06,854
You're a good dude.
At least I think you are.

837
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,291
Fucking Dave Matthews.

838
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,093
He should be paying
for all of this shit.

839
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:15,062
It's like his voice
forces ovulation, or something.

840
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:17,732
You can't park here,
you have to go to those spots.

841
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:19,266
Oh. I forgot to tell you,

842
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,202
I can't make it
into the appointment.

843
00:58:22,236 --> 00:58:23,938
I've got a scheduled ride.

844
00:58:26,207 --> 00:58:29,710
Are you, fuck--
seriously? Why? Why?

845
00:58:29,744 --> 00:58:31,912
Every single time
I have an appointment,

846
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:33,647
you always come up
with some excuse--

847
00:58:33,681 --> 00:58:37,718
I know, I'm sorry, it's ah...
Something came up.

848
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:42,990
How am I going to get home?

849
00:58:43,024 --> 00:58:44,191
Take a DASH.

850
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:48,763
No, me. Me.
I'll pick you up.

851
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:54,201
Huh. Whatever. Oh.

852
00:58:56,103 --> 00:58:58,606
Forget about that voicemail
I left earlier.

853
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,575
Probably sounded
like a psychopath,

854
00:59:01,609 --> 00:59:03,811
it's the hormones, don't worry.

855
00:59:03,844 --> 00:59:05,646
Let me help you. Wait, wait--
I'll come. I can...

856
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:07,214
I'll get-- I'm coming.

857
00:59:09,316 --> 00:59:10,885
Can I take this?

858
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:12,953
Uh. Yeah, sure.

859
00:59:12,987 --> 00:59:19,226
I gotcha. Sorry, um, good luck.
I'll see you later.

860
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:30,604
Fuck! Holy fuck! Come on.

861
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:37,311
Answer your fucking phone!

862
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,784
Mm-hmm?

863
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:46,687
Hey Kalli, what's happening?

864
00:59:48,355 --> 00:59:49,790
You calmed down now?

865
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:51,325
Uh-huh.

866
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:55,229
Is there really a
dead bitch in your trunk?

867
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:56,964
Uh-huh.

868
00:59:57,965 --> 00:59:59,366
You ain't fucking
with me?

869
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,968
Nuh-uh.

870
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:03,237
Fuck. Well...

871
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,306
Yeah, I know Mommy
said the F-word,

872
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,374
but I'm allowed to say it.

873
01:00:07,408 --> 01:00:10,111
Don't know what to tell you.
I warned you, man.

874
01:00:10,144 --> 01:00:12,079
What do you mean,
you don't know what to tell me?

875
01:00:12,113 --> 01:00:13,914
I don't care...
if you turn six tomorrow.

876
01:00:13,948 --> 01:00:16,817
You ain't saying it!
You got yourself in this mess.

877
01:00:17,218 --> 01:00:19,854
No, you can't say the "shit"
word either.

878
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:22,356
Go to bed! Play with fire,
you gonna get burned.

879
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:24,258
No, no, Kalli! Kalli!
You can't just fucking--

880
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:25,893
I gotta go, bye.

881
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:27,094
No, you can't just
fucking leave me like--

882
01:00:27,128 --> 01:00:28,696
Fuck, you stupid fucking bitch!

883
01:00:28,729 --> 01:00:30,998
You fucking ruined
my whole fucking life!

884
01:00:31,031 --> 01:00:32,733
Boy, am I glad
I didn't hang up!

885
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:36,704
Oh yeah, hey, Kalli, sorry.
Sorry about that.

886
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:41,108
Let's get one thing
straight, pal.

887
01:00:41,142 --> 01:00:44,678
I'm not your therapist, I'm not
your lover, I'm not your friend.

888
01:00:44,712 --> 01:00:48,115
Your my customer. Got that?
You pay me to make you happy.

889
01:00:48,149 --> 01:00:51,919
It ain't my fault that you can't
do that for yourself! Bye.

890
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:54,722
Wait, no! Wait you stupid
fucking bitch...

891
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:58,159
Yeah, you fucking stupid
fucking bitch, fuck!

892
01:00:59,226 --> 01:01:08,235
Fuck! Fuck! Shit!
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Come on.

893
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:15,009
All right, fuck. You got this.
Come on. You can do this.

894
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:18,145
You've been through worse.

895
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:20,915
It's just... now you're
a murderer.

896
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:24,251
Great.
How was your night, Milly?

897
01:01:25,886 --> 01:01:27,421
Oh, you know, same-old,
same-old.

898
01:01:28,756 --> 01:01:31,225
Just killed a chick.

899
01:01:33,027 --> 01:01:35,696
Fuck! Fuck!

900
01:01:38,165 --> 01:01:41,769
You fucking killed her, man.
She's in your fucking trunk!

901
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:49,877
Fuck. She had friends.
Fuck. A family. A Mom.

902
01:01:51,245 --> 01:01:57,017
A Mom, a Dad. Fuck.
A Dad.

903
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:04,358
Fuck. Fuck.

904
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,830
Okay. Okay, okay,
okay, calm down, calm down.

905
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:13,400
You got this.
You can do this shit.

906
01:02:13,434 --> 01:02:18,872
Let's just fucking reconvene
here. Fucking... reconvene.

907
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:26,413
Where the fuck...
Where the fuck?

908
01:02:26,447 --> 01:02:30,884
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Where the fuck-- oh, fuck!

909
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:32,419
Fuck, fuck!

910
01:02:55,543 --> 01:02:57,211
UGH!

911
01:02:57,244 --> 01:02:59,046
Fuck.

912
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:09,724
Fuck. Ahhhhh, fuck.
Ahh, ahh, ahh. Fuck!

913
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:24,805
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck!
Ahh! Oh! No! Fuck. Oh!

914
01:03:28,242 --> 01:03:30,578
Oh, fuck.

915
01:03:32,179 --> 01:03:37,818
Oh, fuck.
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

916
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:59,541
Oohh. Fuck. Uh.

917
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:03,844
Oh my g... Oh fuck.

918
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:09,316
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

919
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:18,560
Come on. Pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone...

920
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:20,327
Pick up the phone.

921
01:04:29,336 --> 01:04:33,040
Goddammit, fuck.

922
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:36,477
Hey, this is Emily.
Leave a message.

923
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:37,311
Call.

924
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:41,148
Pick up the phone.

925
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:45,185
Ow, shit!

926
01:04:46,387 --> 01:04:47,589
Fuck.

927
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:51,959
- Hey this is Emily-- - Ah!
 Come on answer your fucking phone!

928
01:04:51,992 --> 01:04:54,094
The mailbox is full...

929
01:04:54,629 --> 01:04:56,363
Fuck.

930
01:05:00,668 --> 01:05:03,003
Oh, shit.

931
01:05:08,643 --> 01:05:10,277
Oh, fuck!

932
01:05:10,612 --> 01:05:12,479
Goddamnit.

933
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:14,549
Did...

934
01:05:14,582 --> 01:05:15,617
You...

935
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,017
Take...

936
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,252
The...

937
01:05:18,485 --> 01:05:19,521
Food...

938
01:05:21,188 --> 01:05:22,524
Ah, fuck!

939
01:05:24,592 --> 01:05:25,660
Ah, fuck!

940
01:05:33,635 --> 01:05:35,637
Please remain in your vehicle.

941
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:38,305
Put your hands
where we can see them.

942
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:41,375
My partner's going to come
and check you out.

943
01:05:54,722 --> 01:05:56,724
Welcome to the party, pal!

944
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,727
Fuck.

945
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,168
Well, this sucks, don't it?

946
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:10,370
You have no idea.

947
01:06:10,605 --> 01:06:12,239
Did I miss something?

948
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:15,175
Hell of a night, sir.

949
01:06:15,209 --> 01:06:18,278
Okay. Can I get your license
and registration, please?

950
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:19,413
Yes, sir.

951
01:06:28,088 --> 01:06:29,524
All right, here you are, sir.

952
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:32,192
Ah, texting and driving?

953
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:33,561
Busted, how did you guess?

954
01:06:33,595 --> 01:06:35,362
Plowed into a cop car, dude.

955
01:06:35,395 --> 01:06:38,098
It's either texting and driving
or drinking and driving.

956
01:06:39,767 --> 01:06:42,069
Yeah. Uh. Sorry.

957
01:06:42,102 --> 01:06:43,470
This car don't belong to you?

958
01:06:43,505 --> 01:06:46,306
No sir, no. Ah.
It's my wife's.

959
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,409
Looks like this shitty night's
just got started then, huh?

960
01:06:49,443 --> 01:06:52,145
I just found out I'm having
a baby girl. Hence the texting.

961
01:06:52,179 --> 01:06:54,081
Had the same look in my eye
when I found out

962
01:06:54,114 --> 01:06:57,084
I was having a daughter, too.
Congrats to you and your wife.

963
01:06:57,117 --> 01:06:58,385
It's not hers.

964
01:06:58,418 --> 01:06:59,754
The car?
But you just said that--

965
01:06:59,787 --> 01:07:03,023
No, no. The uh...
the baby girl.

966
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,228
It smells a bit funky in there.

967
01:07:08,428 --> 01:07:09,731
Ha. Like puke or shit?

968
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:11,198
Like gunpowder.

969
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:13,467
Carrying a firearm on you?

970
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:15,369
No, sir. I just--

971
01:07:15,402 --> 01:07:18,840
I gave a ride
to an officer earlier. I can--

972
01:07:18,873 --> 01:07:20,642
Hey hey, keep your hands
where I can see them, sir!

973
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:22,042
Oopsies.

974
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:23,377
Sorry about that.

975
01:07:25,112 --> 01:07:26,614
Please remain
in your vehicle.

976
01:08:08,488 --> 01:08:10,625
This registration expires
in about two weeks.

977
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:13,561
I'll be sure
to tell the wife.

978
01:08:13,595 --> 01:08:15,697
Good news is, your wife
won't kill you tonight,

979
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:18,432
not over the car, at least.
There appears to be no damages.

980
01:08:18,465 --> 01:08:20,367
Bad news is, it smells
like a frat party in there.

981
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,135
I'm going to ask you to take
a step outside the vehicle

982
01:08:22,169 --> 01:08:23,270
so I can have a look around.

983
01:08:23,303 --> 01:08:24,839
Okay.

984
01:08:24,872 --> 01:08:27,474
All right, nice and slow,
please shut off your vehic--

985
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:29,176
Reports of
shots fired at an officer on
Franklin and North Cherokee...

986
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:30,712
Any officer in the area--

987
01:08:30,745 --> 01:08:34,314
Ten-four dispatch, en route.
Consider this a warning.

988
01:08:35,215 --> 01:08:37,150
Grolemund, let's go!

989
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:51,264
Fuck! Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Oh fuck. Ow!

990
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:53,500
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Oh fuck. Ow!

991
01:08:53,935 --> 01:08:55,603
Oh, shit.

992
01:08:55,903 --> 01:08:56,871
Oh, fuck.

993
01:08:56,904 --> 01:08:58,706
Owww!

994
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:00,908
Okay.

995
01:09:05,278 --> 01:09:06,514
Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.

996
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:08,315
Oh, fuck!

997
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:10,918
Come on!

998
01:09:11,653 --> 01:09:12,820
Ahh.

999
01:09:13,655 --> 01:09:15,255
Answer your phone.

1000
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:20,260
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

1001
01:09:20,293 --> 01:09:23,665
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1002
01:09:26,266 --> 01:09:29,570
Holy fucking shit!

1003
01:09:36,443 --> 01:09:37,712
Hey, what's going on? I--

1004
01:09:37,745 --> 01:09:39,346
Did you take the food
from my car?

1005
01:09:39,379 --> 01:09:41,883
Yeah, sorry.
You said I could take it.

1006
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:44,652
Toss it. Ah? It's...
it's gone bad.

1007
01:09:44,686 --> 01:09:46,754
Gone bad? It's fast food.

1008
01:09:46,788 --> 01:09:48,455
I don't even think
that's possible.

1009
01:09:48,488 --> 01:09:50,725
No, no, no, just toss it, okay?
Just toss it.

1010
01:09:50,758 --> 01:09:54,227
Whoa! Okay, I will.

1011
01:09:58,432 --> 01:09:59,867
Hello?

1012
01:09:59,901 --> 01:10:02,570
Sorry about that.
Is, uh... is everything okay?

1013
01:10:03,503 --> 01:10:05,006
Yep.
Hopefully just one more test

1014
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:07,975
and I should be good to go.
You still picking me up?

1015
01:10:08,009 --> 01:10:09,711
Ah--

1016
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:11,579
Hello?

1017
01:10:11,612 --> 01:10:13,948
Yeah. You bet.
I'll see you soon.

1018
01:10:13,981 --> 01:10:15,817
Cool, cool.

1019
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:18,853
I hate to be a dick, but can you
pick up some pizza or something?

1020
01:10:19,486 --> 01:10:22,255
If not, I will just scarf down
this poison stuff, which--

1021
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:24,592
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Ah, I'll pick something up.

1022
01:10:25,827 --> 01:10:27,695
You da best.

1023
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:28,696
And, hey?

1024
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:30,865
What's up?

1025
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:32,600
We're having a baby girl.

1026
01:10:34,669 --> 01:10:36,804
Yeah.

1027
01:10:38,005 --> 01:10:38,873
We're having a baby girl.

1028
01:10:39,607 --> 01:10:41,809
Okay. Gotta go.
I'll see you soon.

1029
01:10:41,843 --> 01:10:43,511
Okay, bye.

1030
01:10:43,544 --> 01:10:44,979
Fuck.

1031
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:46,581
Fuck.

1032
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,683
Fuck!

1033
01:10:50,918 --> 01:10:53,688
Ahhh.

1034
01:10:56,724 --> 01:10:58,526
Hey, what's up?
I only got a second.

1035
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,962
I uh... I uh... when do you
go on break?

1036
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:02,897
In five minutes. Why?
What's up?

1037
01:11:03,831 --> 01:11:06,067
Uh. I'm in the area.

1038
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,902
Thought I'd bring you some food.

1039
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:09,670
Want to talk to you
about something.

1040
01:11:09,704 --> 01:11:11,404
I don't-- know,
I don't have much time now.

1041
01:11:11,438 --> 01:11:12,439
Do you really need
to talk about this right now?

1042
01:11:12,472 --> 01:11:14,041
It won't take long.

1043
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:15,743
Everything okay?

1044
01:11:15,777 --> 01:11:18,579
Ah... Not really.

1045
01:11:18,613 --> 01:11:21,783
Ah, no, don't like
that answer at all.

1046
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,885
Should I be concerned?

1047
01:11:23,918 --> 01:11:25,620
No, no. Not at all.

1048
01:11:25,653 --> 01:11:28,355
Okay, swing by.
Okay, gotta go, bye.

1049
01:11:28,388 --> 01:11:29,791
Okay, I--

1050
01:11:31,058 --> 01:11:33,326
No worries, sweetheart.

1051
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,327
Just...

1052
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:35,797
Shot a hole in my foot

1053
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,397
and got blood all over
your new car

1054
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:39,100
while I was trying
to blow my brains out!

1055
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:41,869
Oh! And I'm about to ruin
your whole fucking life.

1056
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:44,839
But no worries.
It's not all bad.

1057
01:11:46,808 --> 01:11:49,544
My baby mama, she didn't eat
all my heroin, so there's that.

1058
01:11:49,577 --> 01:11:51,411
Yeah, yeah.
Pete's A-Pizza.

1059
01:11:51,612 --> 01:11:54,381
Yeah, can I order
for pickup, please?

1060
01:11:54,414 --> 01:11:55,917
Uh-huh.
Go ahead.

1061
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:58,418
Uh, can I get a large
pepperoni pie?

1062
01:11:58,451 --> 01:12:00,054
Uh-huh. What kind of crust?

1063
01:12:00,788 --> 01:12:02,790
What the fuck kind of
question is that?

1064
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:06,027
No, can I--
what do you have? Fuck?

1065
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,996
Original, pan, deep,
stuffed.

1066
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,798
Got this new
low-carb fuckin.

1067
01:12:10,832 --> 01:12:13,134
- Ah, fuck!
- Cauliflower bullshit.

1068
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:15,335
Oh, shit!

1069
01:12:16,604 --> 01:12:18,973
- Uh, hey.
- Wise Thai.

1070
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:20,575
Can I get an order for pickup?

1071
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:21,609
Uh-huh.

1072
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:24,078
Um, ooooh!

1073
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:25,847
Yeah, sorry, can I get
a Tom Yum soup?

1074
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,048
Uh-huh.

1075
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:29,482
Uh, are there any carbs in that?

1076
01:12:30,918 --> 01:12:32,553
No, no fuck it.

1077
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:34,055
I'll just get a spicy chicken
Pad-Thai, too.

1078
01:12:34,088 --> 01:12:35,823
Uh-huh.

1079
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:37,124
Fuck!

1080
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:38,793
Uh-huh.
- Crap! Not you.

1081
01:12:38,826 --> 01:12:40,493
That be $35.92.
Ready in ten minutes.

1082
01:12:40,528 --> 01:12:43,631
Yeah. No no no,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

1083
01:12:43,664 --> 01:12:45,166
Thirty-five dollars?

1084
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:47,869
Tom Yum,
spicy chicken Pad-Thai, pho,

1085
01:12:47,902 --> 01:12:49,070
Pad Kra Pao Moo...

1086
01:12:49,103 --> 01:12:50,605
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- $35.92.

1087
01:12:50,638 --> 01:12:52,840
Just the spicy chicken
and the Tom Yum.

1088
01:12:53,674 --> 01:12:55,509
Okay, ten minutes.

1089
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:59,479
Okay. Okay. Bye.

1090
01:13:02,617 --> 01:13:07,989
Ah, oh, oh! Fuck!

1091
01:13:14,996 --> 01:13:19,432
What the fuck?
Oh, shit. Okay.

1092
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:22,103
Okay, hello?

1093
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:24,105
Hey man, sorry about
the puke. I think I might have
left my--

1094
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:26,874
- Snuck out a little early.
- Hi.

1095
01:13:26,908 --> 01:13:29,143
- Sorry.
- How's your night?

1096
01:13:29,176 --> 01:13:32,647
I was just running all over.
It's okay.

1097
01:13:32,947 --> 01:13:37,218
Whoa. Smells like something
died in here. Do you smell that?

1098
01:13:37,251 --> 01:13:40,154
- Um...
- It's my fucking coat.

1099
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:43,524
I had a to pump
a patient's stomach today.

1100
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:45,893
But you brought Thai food.

1101
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:46,961
Ah, shit.

1102
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:48,029
You forgot Thai food.

1103
01:13:48,062 --> 01:13:49,462
No, it's uh, just--

1104
01:13:49,496 --> 01:13:50,932
It's fine.
I'll just get something.

1105
01:13:50,965 --> 01:13:52,667
No, I ordered it,
we just have to go pick it up.

1106
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,467
No really, it's fine.
I have, like, ten minutes.

1107
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:56,137
That's all it'll take. Great.

1108
01:13:56,170 --> 01:13:57,872
Really, I have to--

1109
01:13:58,539 --> 01:13:59,840
I know. I know.
I know, I know.

1110
01:13:59,874 --> 01:14:01,776
You still seem frazzled.

1111
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:03,511
I'm not frazzled, it's--

1112
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:07,615
Well, it sure as hell sounded
like it on the phone earlier.

1113
01:14:07,648 --> 01:14:09,150
Oh.

1114
01:14:09,884 --> 01:14:12,086
Oh yeah, what's this news
you have to tell me?

1115
01:14:12,553 --> 01:14:15,022
Umm. Ah...

1116
01:14:15,256 --> 01:14:19,260
Aw! Did you see Audra and
Paul got engaged?

1117
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:21,529
Oh my God! Finally.

1118
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:24,665
Oh, yeah.

1119
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:26,667
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

1120
01:14:26,701 --> 01:14:28,235
Oh my God.
Oh my God, oh my God.

1121
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:30,638
Did he break... did he cheat
on her, or something?

1122
01:14:30,671 --> 01:14:35,042
No. No no, that's not it.
It's just-- ooh. I-- I--

1123
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:38,846
How about we wait
until you have some food in you

1124
01:14:38,879 --> 01:14:42,016
'cause I know how you get
when you haven't eaten.

1125
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:45,086
What? What?
That is not fair.

1126
01:14:48,255 --> 01:14:49,957
When's the last
snack you had?

1127
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:51,792
I had an RX bar.

1128
01:14:51,826 --> 01:14:54,028
- When?
- I don't know. Like, noon.

1129
01:14:54,662 --> 01:14:56,163
God, what is this? I mean, like,
you're seriously--

1130
01:14:56,197 --> 01:14:57,698
You've been saying
that you need to talk to me--

1131
01:14:57,732 --> 01:14:59,033
Let's just wait
until you get some food.

1132
01:14:59,066 --> 01:15:00,568
It's, like, what is it?
What is it?

1133
01:15:00,601 --> 01:15:02,136
You want to divorce me
or something?

1134
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:03,637
Like, you're really starting
to freak me out here.

1135
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:04,939
No, no, no,
that's not it at all.

1136
01:15:04,972 --> 01:15:09,143
It's, um, um, ah a surprise.

1137
01:15:10,277 --> 01:15:14,849
Yeah. I know how
much you like surprises.

1138
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:20,021
I do. I love surprises.
What is it?

1139
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:25,626
What? Oh my-- oh my God,
did you fix the kitchen sink?

1140
01:15:26,694 --> 01:15:29,030
No, I didn't have time
to do that today.

1141
01:15:29,063 --> 01:15:30,197
So, you keep guessing.

1142
01:15:30,231 --> 01:15:31,699
Ummm, okay.

1143
01:15:31,732 --> 01:15:34,235
Um, I know we talked
about a puppy.

1144
01:15:34,268 --> 01:15:37,171
I'd be excited, but, like,
maybe not the best time.

1145
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:38,939
Nope. Guess again.

1146
01:15:38,973 --> 01:15:40,007
Okay, good.

1147
01:15:40,341 --> 01:15:42,143
Third time's a charm.
You can do it.

1148
01:15:42,176 --> 01:15:44,211
Well, we did go to that
jewelry store the other day--

1149
01:15:44,245 --> 01:15:47,048
Oh, so close!
You'll found out soon enough!

1150
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:48,783
Be right back. Ow!

1151
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,253
My coat.

1152
01:15:53,788 --> 01:15:56,757
Oh, my God. Oh.

1153
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:18,112
I fucking knew it!
Piece of shit!

1154
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:33,761
Oh! Are you fucking-- ugh!

1155
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:38,032
What is this? Ugh!

1156
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:43,070
My coat-- destroying my car!

1157
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:59,153
Tara, Tara, Tara! Tara!
Hey! What you doing?

1158
01:16:59,753 --> 01:17:01,822
Looking for my other
white work coat.

1159
01:17:01,856 --> 01:17:03,424
- No--
- I know I put it in here
somewhere.

1160
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:05,192
What did someone steal
my white work coat?

1161
01:17:05,226 --> 01:17:06,894
No, no, let's get you back
to the hospital, huh?

1162
01:17:06,927 --> 01:17:09,163
These people are disgusting!

1163
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:15,803
Looking for this, I assume?

1164
01:17:15,836 --> 01:17:17,972
Oh yeah, thanks.
I dropped it earlier.

1165
01:17:24,145 --> 01:17:26,113
Got anything you want
to tell me?

1166
01:17:26,147 --> 01:17:28,349
Um, not off the top of my head.

1167
01:17:30,818 --> 01:17:33,821
Oh, you mean-- yeah, you mean,
like, why you wanted to talk?

1168
01:17:33,854 --> 01:17:35,389
No, no, no. I mean, like
why the hell

1169
01:17:35,422 --> 01:17:37,892
there's a pack of cigarettes
in the glove box.

1170
01:17:38,259 --> 01:17:40,127
Oh, those aren't mine,
they're a friend's.

1171
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:41,462
I mean a passenger's.
A client's.

1172
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:43,197
Stop. Just stop fucking
lying to me.

1173
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:44,798
No, I'm not lying to you.

1174
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:46,367
Okay, okay.
I don't care, I don't care.

1175
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,301
I just, I just want to find
my other white work coat.

1176
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:49,003
It smells like puke.

1177
01:17:49,036 --> 01:17:50,137
I'm gonna smell
like puke the rest of the day.

1178
01:17:50,171 --> 01:17:51,272
I made the car smell like puke!

1179
01:17:53,307 --> 01:17:57,444
I'm sorry. I am really hungry.
Can I please just eat?

1180
01:17:57,478 --> 01:17:58,279
Please?

1181
01:17:58,312 --> 01:17:59,113
Yeah, dig in.

1182
01:17:59,146 --> 01:18:02,416
Okay.

1183
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:04,818
Do you care if I have
a bite of your Pad Thai?

1184
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:07,021
Ah, you know,
there are carbs in the Pad Thai.

1185
01:18:07,054 --> 01:18:08,422
Yes, thank you,
I know there's carbs in this.

1186
01:18:08,455 --> 01:18:10,424
I'm having a bite.

1187
01:18:18,966 --> 01:18:23,370
What? I just got your text
saying you're on your way.

1188
01:18:23,404 --> 01:18:24,905
Yeah, weird. So weird.

1189
01:18:28,976 --> 01:18:34,048
Mmm, my God.
This is so fucking good.

1190
01:18:36,283 --> 01:18:38,319
I feel better.

1191
01:18:39,186 --> 01:18:40,788
I knew you would.

1192
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:42,022
You want some?

1193
01:18:42,056 --> 01:18:45,192
Ooh, um, no. I'm not hungry.

1194
01:18:45,226 --> 01:18:48,229
It's amazing.
A little cold, but I'm good.

1195
01:18:49,196 --> 01:18:52,433
Mmm. Honey.

1196
01:18:52,466 --> 01:18:53,467
Yeah?

1197
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,236
You picked the good place.

1198
01:18:55,269 --> 01:18:59,373
- I did, didn't I?
- Ah shit, pot hole. God, fuck.

1199
01:19:04,378 --> 01:19:07,815
There's not as much chicken
in this one. Oh, there's one.

1200
01:19:10,518 --> 01:19:14,154
Ow, yeah, I'm having
stomach cramps today,

1201
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:16,056
So that's-- it's weird.

1202
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,458
Want some? You hungry?

1203
01:19:17,491 --> 01:19:18,826
No, no.

1204
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,205
Honey, I don't have
any more time to get--

1205
01:19:31,238 --> 01:19:32,439
I know, I know...

1206
01:19:32,473 --> 01:19:34,341
Can we-- can we
please just talk?

1207
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:36,410
Sure. Can we talk and I eat?

1208
01:19:41,849 --> 01:19:45,953
This is so weird,
but you are extremely smart.

1209
01:19:47,187 --> 01:19:49,356
Getting me food
and then telling me--

1210
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:51,292
I don't even know what the fuck
you're going to tell me.

1211
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:53,861
You tell me you killed my
parents, I don't care, whatever.

1212
01:19:55,195 --> 01:19:58,132
You know how much
I love you, right?

1213
01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:00,434
I love you too.

1214
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:03,070
And you know that I'd do
anything for you, right?

1215
01:20:03,605 --> 01:20:05,540
Is this about Audra
and Paul's wedding?

1216
01:20:05,573 --> 01:20:07,408
'Cause you don't have to go.
I know they kind of suck.

1217
01:20:07,441 --> 01:20:08,942
No, will you please
just listen,

1218
01:20:08,976 --> 01:20:12,112
listen to me, for once?
Um, you remember

1219
01:20:12,146 --> 01:20:14,582
the Dave Matthews concert
you couldn't go to?

1220
01:20:14,616 --> 01:20:19,253
What? Um, no. When was that?

1221
01:20:20,254 --> 01:20:22,089
About eight months ago.

1222
01:20:22,122 --> 01:20:24,091
Did I have to cover a shift,
or something?

1223
01:20:24,124 --> 01:20:25,326
Uh-huh.

1224
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:27,428
Um, I mean, yeah, I guess.
Kind of.

1225
01:20:28,596 --> 01:20:31,533
Do you remember why we moved
into a two-bedroom apartment?

1226
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:33,934
You serious?

1227
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:35,537
You're seriously going
to bring this up? Right now?

1228
01:20:35,570 --> 01:20:37,137
Every time I try to bring
it up, you change the subject.

1229
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:38,305
Because it's not
a conversation

1230
01:20:38,339 --> 01:20:40,107
I particularly enjoy having.

1231
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:41,643
Yeah, but it's a conversation
that we need to have.

1232
01:20:41,676 --> 01:20:43,310
Well, there's not an outcome
to this conversation

1233
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:44,278
where I don't end up
looking like a selfish,

1234
01:20:44,311 --> 01:20:46,013
narcissistic bitch.

1235
01:20:47,615 --> 01:20:49,383
This is the part
where you tell me

1236
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:51,519
that I'm not in fact a selfish,
narcissistic bitch.

1237
01:20:51,553 --> 01:20:53,987
Oh, yeah, you're not selfish
or narcissistic.

1238
01:20:55,623 --> 01:20:56,658
Or a bitch.
Or a bitch.

1239
01:20:56,691 --> 01:20:58,225
Thank you!

1240
01:20:58,258 --> 01:20:59,326
But we have to have
this conversation,

1241
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,662
because we haven't finished--

1242
01:21:00,695 --> 01:21:02,129
Okay, okay,
do you really not think

1243
01:21:02,162 --> 01:21:03,097
that I don't think about
this stuff, too?

1244
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:04,431
No, I know you do,

1245
01:21:04,465 --> 01:21:06,300
but we haven't
talked about it, so--

1246
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:09,370
Okay. Okay. Let's do this.
I have aspired my entire life

1247
01:21:09,403 --> 01:21:11,271
to wear this white coat,
you know that.

1248
01:21:11,305 --> 01:21:15,175
High school, college, MCATS,
residency-- all those years.

1249
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:18,445
And-- and I know, it's just
a stupid white coat to you.

1250
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:20,447
But you know how much
this coat cost me--

1251
01:21:20,481 --> 01:21:24,118
three hundred thousand dollars
of student loan debt

1252
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:27,054
and clinical FOMO.
But now that I'm wearing it,

1253
01:21:27,087 --> 01:21:29,089
I have to work twice as hard
just to keep it on,

1254
01:21:29,123 --> 01:21:30,991
or it was all for nothing!

1255
01:21:31,024 --> 01:21:33,026
- Tara...
- And yes, I would love
to be that girl

1256
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,329
that lays around all day
and drinks White Claws

1257
01:21:35,362 --> 01:21:38,465
and eats Taco Bell, or go on
hikes in the middle of the day,

1258
01:21:38,499 --> 01:21:40,200
bake cute shit
on "British Bake-Off,"

1259
01:21:40,234 --> 01:21:43,070
or just maybe have
one hour to work out

1260
01:21:43,103 --> 01:21:45,038
so I don't watch
my body fade to flub.

1261
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:46,140
I know, I know.
I know, but--

1262
01:21:46,173 --> 01:21:47,341
I want to go to Dave Matthews.

1263
01:21:47,374 --> 01:21:48,976
I love Dave Matthews.
Okay?

1264
01:21:49,009 --> 01:21:51,345
The point is, I can think
of a thousand other ways

1265
01:21:51,378 --> 01:21:54,148
to spend three
hundred thousand dollars.

1266
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:57,384
Just listen!

1267
01:21:57,418 --> 01:22:00,588
I put my life on hold
to make this happen for us.

1268
01:22:01,221 --> 01:22:04,726
Okay? And I see that life
passing me by every single day.

1269
01:22:04,759 --> 01:22:07,127
But that's cool.
I signed up for that.

1270
01:22:08,262 --> 01:22:09,963
And I think you did, too.

1271
01:22:16,738 --> 01:22:21,975
Okay. I mean, okay, okay.
I want a family, I do.

1272
01:22:22,644 --> 01:22:26,013
I know you want a baby,
and I want a baby, too.

1273
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:30,552
I want a baby, too.
So we'll figure it out, right?

1274
01:22:32,052 --> 01:22:36,423
Figure it out.
We'll adjust, and I'll reroute,

1275
01:22:37,759 --> 01:22:39,561
it's just
there's moving pieces--

1276
01:22:41,395 --> 01:22:45,499
The dirty things that I would do
for some Taco Bell

1277
01:22:45,533 --> 01:22:47,201
and a cigarette.

1278
01:22:47,234 --> 01:22:52,406
Is she a
passenger? So awkward.

1279
01:22:52,774 --> 01:22:55,743
She's so pretty.

1280
01:22:55,777 --> 01:22:57,512
What's up?

1281
01:22:57,545 --> 01:23:02,082
Oh, hey, um congratulations.
How far along are you?

1282
01:23:02,115 --> 01:23:05,052
Eight long hormonal months,
girl, but--

1283
01:23:05,085 --> 01:23:06,588
You look great.

1284
01:23:08,288 --> 01:23:10,324
I feel like a Ziploc bag
full of pudding.

1285
01:23:11,091 --> 01:23:14,294
We have artificial intelligence
and self-driving cars,

1286
01:23:14,328 --> 01:23:16,163
and literally anything
we could possibility

1287
01:23:16,196 --> 01:23:19,066
want to figure out at the palm
of our fucking hands,

1288
01:23:19,099 --> 01:23:21,034
and yet I am still
pushing this sucker out

1289
01:23:21,068 --> 01:23:22,737
like I'm in a freakin' manger.

1290
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:26,674
But, at least we can get you
high as a kite though, right?

1291
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:29,744
Shit. Are you a doctor?

1292
01:23:29,777 --> 01:23:31,478
Mm-hmm.

1293
01:23:31,513 --> 01:23:33,046
Sorry, I didn't mean
to make your job seem like it's-

1294
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,281
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1295
01:23:34,314 --> 01:23:35,750
You look amazing,
better than me.

1296
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:38,653
And all I have is a belly
full of Thai food, so...

1297
01:23:38,686 --> 01:23:40,354
Oh my God, that sounds so good.

1298
01:23:40,387 --> 01:23:42,089
Please, please tell me
you picked up some grub

1299
01:23:42,122 --> 01:23:43,625
like I asked.

1300
01:23:44,258 --> 01:23:47,662
Oh, my god. You're doing Food
DASH now too. That's awesome.

1301
01:23:47,695 --> 01:23:51,298
Um. There's Tom Yum,
if you want it.

1302
01:23:51,699 --> 01:23:53,100
Do you have anything
with carbs?

1303
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:55,168
Because I've got
nothing to hide.

1304
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:57,572
Just my Pad Thai.

1305
01:23:57,605 --> 01:23:59,306
Okay.

1306
01:23:59,807 --> 01:24:04,344
Um, okay.
I... I don't have cooties, so...

1307
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:07,414
Girl, I don't care
if you have the Bubonic Plague.

1308
01:24:07,447 --> 01:24:12,119
Hell, yes! Thank you.
Can I get that fork?

1309
01:24:12,452 --> 01:24:15,455
Oh, um, sure.

1310
01:24:48,221 --> 01:24:52,594
Goddamn, I just named this
baby girl of yours Pad Thai.

1311
01:24:55,162 --> 01:24:58,131
I've got to get back to work.
Um, it was so nice meeting you.

1312
01:24:58,165 --> 01:24:59,399
Mm-hmm.

1313
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:00,568
No, I really,
I have to go back.

1314
01:25:00,602 --> 01:25:02,336
Oh, I know.

1315
01:25:02,369 --> 01:25:03,403
Oh, I thought you were
a passenger getting dropped.

1316
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:04,572
Do you guys know each other?

1317
01:25:04,606 --> 01:25:06,206
Ah, yeah, I'm his--

1318
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:07,307
We're just going to go
for a little ride, yeah.

1319
01:25:07,341 --> 01:25:08,710
Babe, this isn't funny.

1320
01:25:08,743 --> 01:25:10,243
I have to be back,
I am 10 minutes late--

1321
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:11,378
Babe?

1322
01:25:11,411 --> 01:25:13,246
Yeah?

1323
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,549
Babe?

1324
01:25:14,582 --> 01:25:16,316
What's up?

1325
01:25:19,486 --> 01:25:21,288
What's going on here?

1326
01:25:21,321 --> 01:25:23,423
I'm a bit confused myself.
Do you two know each other?

1327
01:25:26,259 --> 01:25:28,261
Um-- Ha. Yeah,
you could say that.

1328
01:25:28,796 --> 01:25:29,931
And you are?

1329
01:25:29,964 --> 01:25:31,566
She's my favorite prostitute.

1330
01:25:34,902 --> 01:25:36,804
I'm this strange man's wife.

1331
01:25:39,272 --> 01:25:41,542
Don't call me that in public.
We talked about that.

1332
01:25:41,576 --> 01:25:44,478
- Yeah.
- You doing okay?

1333
01:25:44,512 --> 01:25:45,813
I am a bit frazzled now.

1334
01:25:45,847 --> 01:25:51,753
Yeah.
So, you two know each other?

1335
01:25:51,786 --> 01:25:53,220
Mm-hmm.

1336
01:25:53,253 --> 01:25:54,756
Hmm. How so?

1337
01:25:55,823 --> 01:25:58,225
- Um...
- Yeah.

1338
01:26:00,427 --> 01:26:03,798
Ha, okay. That strange man
up there put this baby in me.

1339
01:26:05,867 --> 01:26:06,868
So...

1340
01:26:06,901 --> 01:26:08,770
So, unless the two of you,

1341
01:26:08,803 --> 01:26:10,872
uh, met and then got married
within the last eight months,

1342
01:26:10,905 --> 01:26:13,340
I think we've got a pretty
big fucking problem here.

1343
01:26:13,373 --> 01:26:15,710
- I can explain.
- To who?
- To whom?

1344
01:26:15,743 --> 01:26:17,344
Tara-- I--

1345
01:26:17,377 --> 01:26:19,681
Oh my God, this is real.
My God, this is real!

1346
01:26:19,714 --> 01:26:21,214
Tara. Tara, Tara, I--

1347
01:26:21,248 --> 01:26:22,249
Shut the fuck up.
Just shut the fuck up?

1348
01:26:22,282 --> 01:26:23,818
Not a single fucking word!

1349
01:26:24,819 --> 01:26:26,420
For what it's worth,
I had no idea--

1350
01:26:26,453 --> 01:26:27,955
Yeah, that goes for you, too.
Shut up!

1351
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:29,724
Okay, miss.

1352
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:31,726
Listen, I'm about to kill
the man sitting next to you.

1353
01:26:31,759 --> 01:26:33,728
Do not put yourself
on that list, too!

1354
01:26:35,997 --> 01:26:38,533
- For what it's worth...
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shut the fuck up!

1355
01:26:44,972 --> 01:26:46,741
Take me back to work, please.

1356
01:26:46,774 --> 01:26:48,308
No, no, no. Tara, Tara,
we have to talk about this.

1357
01:26:48,341 --> 01:26:49,309
Yeah, I'd actually
like to walk from here--

1358
01:26:49,342 --> 01:26:50,578
No, no, no, please, no.

1359
01:26:50,611 --> 01:26:52,013
No one's getting out
of this car

1360
01:26:52,046 --> 01:26:53,915
until we talk about this
and act like adults here,

1361
01:26:53,948 --> 01:26:55,850
- because I have to tell...
- You want to act like adult?

1362
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:57,417
Okay, fine.

1363
01:26:57,451 --> 01:27:00,822
I work 100 hours a week,
I own my own car.

1364
01:27:00,855 --> 01:27:03,524
Um, what do you besides
knock up random sluts?

1365
01:27:03,558 --> 01:27:05,492
- It's not about that right now.
- Excuse me! Who?

1366
01:27:05,526 --> 01:27:06,794
Were you going to keep this
a secret from me?

1367
01:27:06,828 --> 01:27:08,696
No, no.
I was going to tell you.

1368
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:10,363
I had a plan--

1369
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:11,799
So, how were you going
to pay for-- oh, man.

1370
01:27:12,432 --> 01:27:13,668
I had a plan.

1371
01:27:13,701 --> 01:27:15,002
Oh my God,
you were going to pay

1372
01:27:15,036 --> 01:27:16,771
for this bastard child
with my money!

1373
01:27:16,804 --> 01:27:19,372
- No, it's--
- Bastard child? Excuse me--

1374
01:27:19,406 --> 01:27:20,675
You can't even afford
your own car!

1375
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:22,543
You know that, right?

1376
01:27:22,577 --> 01:27:25,680
No money, no money, and you want
to raise a child behind my back!

1377
01:27:25,713 --> 01:27:26,446
Oh, my God.

1378
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,015
My God!

1379
01:27:28,049 --> 01:27:29,884
I would appreciate it
if you saw my side in this,

1380
01:27:29,917 --> 01:27:32,452
because I am carrying
this man's child, and I--

1381
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,889
I was going to tell you, too.
I just--

1382
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:37,825
Oh. Oh, you were? When?
In the fucking delivery room?

1383
01:27:37,859 --> 01:27:39,493
At my fucking hospital?

1384
01:27:39,527 --> 01:27:40,728
Ow, please!

1385
01:27:40,762 --> 01:27:42,530
Ow, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

1386
01:27:42,563 --> 01:27:44,699
I know, I know, I know.
I'm sorry! I'm driving!

1387
01:27:44,732 --> 01:27:46,868
I'm fucking driving!
Babe, baby, babe, babe.

1388
01:27:46,901 --> 01:27:48,970
Fuck you! And fuck that baby!

1389
01:27:49,604 --> 01:27:51,304
Oh, you're really
gonna play the fucking--

1390
01:27:51,338 --> 01:27:52,472
No! No!

1391
01:27:52,507 --> 01:27:53,875
Oh, no no, stop!

1392
01:27:53,908 --> 01:27:55,076
Stop it!

1393
01:27:55,109 --> 01:27:56,944
Oh! Will you fucking--

1394
01:27:56,978 --> 01:27:59,379
somebody just fucking listen
to me for a fucking change?

1395
01:28:01,115 --> 01:28:02,817
I spend all day every day

1396
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:05,586
listening to what other people
have to tell me--

1397
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:10,625
but it's my turn now!
This isn't about us.

1398
01:28:10,658 --> 01:28:12,459
It's about that baby,
right there.

1399
01:28:13,928 --> 01:28:15,763
You're going to divorce me.

1400
01:28:15,797 --> 01:28:17,698
You're going to get
full custody.

1401
01:28:17,732 --> 01:28:19,567
I understand if neither of you
ever want to talk to me again,

1402
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,871
I get it. I get it!
But please, I know,

1403
01:28:23,905 --> 01:28:26,707
I know that you two will never
give me another chance.

1404
01:28:27,909 --> 01:28:29,644
I don't deserve one.

1405
01:28:29,677 --> 01:28:32,513
But let that child
just give me one.

1406
01:28:32,547 --> 01:28:34,081
Fuck!

1407
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,655
What the hell is that?

1408
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:42,790
Yeah, everybody, let's get out.

1409
01:28:42,824 --> 01:28:43,891
Yeah, let's just--
let's get out.

1410
01:28:43,925 --> 01:28:44,959
What have you done to my car?

1411
01:28:44,992 --> 01:28:45,893
No no, probably a flat tire.

1412
01:28:45,927 --> 01:28:48,596
You ruin everything!

1413
01:28:48,629 --> 01:28:49,997
- Get out, get out, get out,
get out, get out! Get out!
- What kind of flat tire is...

1414
01:28:50,031 --> 01:28:51,833
Yes. No, I know, it's okay,
a flat tire is--

1415
01:28:51,866 --> 01:28:58,773
I'll change it real fast.
Ow! Okay, BRB! I'm sorry.

1416
01:28:59,507 --> 01:29:04,846
BRB! Ow. Holy fuck.

1417
01:29:05,079 --> 01:29:09,449
Holy fuck. I know, I hear you.
I fucking hear you. Jesus! Fuck.

1418
01:29:09,482 --> 01:29:11,986
( Help me! Somebody help me! )

1419
01:29:12,587 --> 01:29:14,655
- Calm down, calm down!
- ( Help me! )
- Okay, okay, okay!

1420
01:29:14,689 --> 01:29:15,523
( Someone, help! )

1421
01:29:15,556 --> 01:29:16,958
Stop yelling!

1422
01:29:16,991 --> 01:29:18,059
( Get me out! )

1423
01:29:18,092 --> 01:29:24,397
Fuck! Fuck! Um, ah. Shit! Ow!

1424
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:27,467
( Get me out of here!
Somebody help me!)

1425
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,803
Oh, shit!

1426
01:29:28,836 --> 01:29:32,974
( Someone help, please!
Please! Please!)

1427
01:29:42,917 --> 01:29:44,384
Hello?

1428
01:29:49,957 --> 01:29:52,727
Is there someone
in the trunk of the car?

1429
01:29:53,027 --> 01:30:00,467
- What the fuck do you think?
- Jesus Christ-- are you okay?

1430
01:30:02,103 --> 01:30:05,438
What the fuck do you think?
Stop asking stupid questions!

1431
01:30:05,472 --> 01:30:07,575
I'm not asking
stupid question, I just--

1432
01:30:07,608 --> 01:30:08,776
Get me the fuck out of here!

1433
01:30:08,809 --> 01:30:10,011
Okay. Wait, wait, wait--

1434
01:30:10,044 --> 01:30:11,812
Are you fucking insane?
Help!

1435
01:30:11,846 --> 01:30:14,081
Stop, stop, stop, please!
Stop yelling. Stop yelling!

1436
01:30:14,115 --> 01:30:16,416
Get me out of it!

1437
01:30:16,851 --> 01:30:22,723
Please! Please!
Just get me out of here!

1438
01:30:25,526 --> 01:30:31,632
Okay. If I let you out,
are you going to scream?

1439
01:30:32,733 --> 01:30:34,101
No.

1440
01:30:34,135 --> 01:30:36,938
If I let you out,
are you going to run away?

1441
01:30:37,872 --> 01:30:39,507
>> No.

1442
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,943
If I let you out, are you
going to call the police?

1443
01:30:44,879 --> 01:30:46,180
Are you going to
call the police?

1444
01:30:46,213 --> 01:30:48,215
I heard what you said.

1445
01:30:48,249 --> 01:30:50,952
And no, I'm not going to call
the fucking police.

1446
01:30:50,985 --> 01:30:55,523
I just want-- I just want
to get out of here. Please!

1447
01:30:56,257 --> 01:30:57,725
Okay, okay.

1448
01:30:57,758 --> 01:30:59,193
Please!

1449
01:30:59,226 --> 01:31:04,565
I'm going to let you out now.
Ow! Fuck! Oh.

1450
01:31:09,804 --> 01:31:11,939
Okay.

1451
01:31:12,306 --> 01:31:14,208
I'm going to open it now.

1452
01:31:19,146 --> 01:31:24,151
Oh, shit. I got you.
I got you.

1453
01:31:28,155 --> 01:31:32,893
Step down. Yeah. I got you.
Here you go.

1454
01:31:36,831 --> 01:31:39,266
- You got the door?
- Uh-huh.

1455
01:31:40,301 --> 01:31:42,536
Okay. Sorry.

1456
01:31:48,576 --> 01:31:52,513
Owww, fuck! Oh, shit! Ah!

1457
01:32:01,789 --> 01:32:05,526
Shit. Okay.

1458
01:32:20,174 --> 01:32:21,876
Thanks.

1459
01:32:22,276 --> 01:32:25,079
Yeah. For... for what?

1460
01:32:26,213 --> 01:32:28,115
Not leaving me--

1461
01:32:29,150 --> 01:32:32,186
Not leaving you--
are you serious?

1462
01:32:34,755 --> 01:32:36,257
That's what usually happens.

1463
01:32:38,993 --> 01:32:45,199
Basements, warehouses,
back alleys.

1464
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,570
I've came to in
just about all of them.

1465
01:32:51,639 --> 01:32:54,909
Yeah, I couldn't
abandon someone like that.

1466
01:32:59,313 --> 01:33:02,116
This, ah, this ever happened
before?

1467
01:33:05,252 --> 01:33:09,690
Yeah, but always to
bright lights, like hospitals,

1468
01:33:10,357 --> 01:33:12,159
ambulances, flashlights.

1469
01:33:12,193 --> 01:33:19,166
But never-- this is the
first time I came to darkness.

1470
01:33:22,303 --> 01:33:24,238
Nothing.

1471
01:33:26,373 --> 01:33:31,011
I thought it was 'it.'
I just accepted it.

1472
01:33:32,213 --> 01:33:33,881
I gave up.

1473
01:33:38,085 --> 01:33:40,621
Now you've got a
second chance.

1474
01:33:42,857 --> 01:33:44,625
This is my third
second chance.

1475
01:33:47,128 --> 01:33:50,698
I was on my way to rehab.

1476
01:33:51,198 --> 01:33:54,135
When? You mean-- oh, fuck!

1477
01:33:59,206 --> 01:34:01,942
You're not a very good drug
dealer, are you?

1478
01:34:03,010 --> 01:34:04,378
How could you tell?

1479
01:34:05,446 --> 01:34:09,183
I'm your customer.
I'm not your friend.

1480
01:34:12,953 --> 01:34:14,722
Yeah, blame my ED.

1481
01:34:14,755 --> 01:34:16,323
Huh?

1482
01:34:16,357 --> 01:34:18,092
Nothing.

1483
01:34:21,095 --> 01:34:22,796
Scary thing, huh?

1484
01:34:23,364 --> 01:34:25,933
Not knowing the person
sitting in your back seat.

1485
01:34:27,801 --> 01:34:30,137
Scarier not knowing
the person sitting up front.

1486
01:34:31,105 --> 01:34:32,840
Shit.

1487
01:34:34,175 --> 01:34:37,978
Can you, um,
take me to the hospital?

1488
01:34:40,114 --> 01:34:43,484
I'm not going to say
anything, man.

1489
01:34:43,518 --> 01:34:46,921
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's...

1490
01:34:48,189 --> 01:34:50,024
I might get a VIP parking spot
at that place

1491
01:34:50,057 --> 01:34:51,792
by the end of tonight.

1492
01:35:04,505 --> 01:35:06,073
I know this is bad timing,

1493
01:35:06,106 --> 01:35:09,276
but we've got to pick up
a few more.

1494
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,516
I know.

1495
01:35:14,549 --> 01:35:18,052
Are you sensitive
to loud noises?

1496
01:35:18,452 --> 01:35:21,455
- Like music?
- Like screaming.

1497
01:35:23,123 --> 01:35:27,294
Eh, I don't feel much
of anything right now.

1498
01:35:28,829 --> 01:35:31,999
Two peas in a shitty pod,
huh?

1499
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:41,509
You got any cigarettes?

1500
01:35:41,543 --> 01:35:42,843
Um...

1501
01:35:44,311 --> 01:35:46,013
Ah--

1502
01:35:48,449 --> 01:35:52,353
What... ? You've gotta be
fucking kidding!

1503
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:54,188
Oh!

1504
01:35:54,221 --> 01:35:55,956
- Is she--
- Oh, God.

1505
01:36:01,529 --> 01:36:04,131
We have to go now!
Get in the fucking car now!

1506
01:36:04,865 --> 01:36:06,534
Are you okay?! Oh, my god!

1507
01:36:06,568 --> 01:36:08,269
Drive! Drive!

1508
01:36:08,302 --> 01:36:10,304
- Okay, okay. We're going.
- We're going to breathe,

1509
01:36:10,337 --> 01:36:11,939
- and we're going to count
to five.
- Oh, my god.

1510
01:36:11,972 --> 01:36:13,207
I don't want to fucking
count to five.

1511
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,075
I want to go
to the fucking hospital!

1512
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:16,477
I'm going. I'm going.

1513
01:36:16,511 --> 01:36:18,946
Oh, fuck you, fuck you.
Fuck you!

1514
01:36:18,979 --> 01:36:20,447
- I'm sorry--
- Fuck Dave Matthews. Oh, my
god. Fuck you for all of this.

1515
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:23,250
Where the fuck did you go?!

1516
01:36:23,284 --> 01:36:24,552
I just went around the corner--

1517
01:36:24,586 --> 01:36:26,153
You fucking left us there!

1518
01:36:26,186 --> 01:36:27,354
I didn't know you were going
to pop the thing

1519
01:36:27,388 --> 01:36:29,456
out right fucking here!

1520
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:31,892
Who the fuck is this?! Did
you fucking knock her up too?!
- No!

1521
01:36:31,925 --> 01:36:33,360
- Watch the road. Watch the-
- Where are you going? Don't
take Melrose!

1522
01:36:33,394 --> 01:36:36,130
- What? Not--
- Drive! You're going the wrong.

1523
01:36:36,163 --> 01:36:37,431
Drive faster! Keep your eyes
on the road.

1524
01:36:37,464 --> 01:36:39,066
I'm going as fast as
I fucking--

1525
01:36:39,099 --> 01:36:41,435
Go around the car! Just go
around the car!

1526
01:36:41,468 --> 01:36:44,071
It doesn't matter if there's
a red light.

1527
01:36:44,104 --> 01:36:45,439
There is a red light,
just keep driving!

1528
01:36:45,472 --> 01:36:47,875
I know, I know.
I can't believe this.

1529
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:50,144
I don't know what to do!
There's a fucking red light!

1530
01:36:50,177 --> 01:36:52,246
She's having a child
in the back seat!

1531
01:36:52,279 --> 01:36:54,014
I know, I know.

1532
01:36:54,048 --> 01:36:58,185
Just go around the cars.
It doesn't matter just drive!

1533
01:36:58,218 --> 01:37:00,254
- I'm going!
- You cannot do anything right!

1534
01:37:00,287 --> 01:37:01,388
You seriously cannot do
anything right.

1535
01:37:01,422 --> 01:37:03,490
I'm literally fucking driving!

1536
01:37:04,024 --> 01:37:06,927
- I know!
- Watch the road!
Just keep going!

1537
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:12,132
I'm fucking lost!

1538
01:37:16,437 --> 01:37:19,106
I don't know where I'm going.

1539
01:37:22,242 --> 01:37:23,877
I'm lost.

1540
01:37:26,213 --> 01:37:28,382
And I'm sorry.

1541
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:33,120
You should have said
that before. Make a right here.

1542
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,530
- Make a right down there.
- Okay.

1543
01:37:44,599 --> 01:37:48,936
It's okay. We're almost
there. We're almost there.

1544
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,176
Okay. We're almost there,
we're almost there.

1545
01:37:58,646 --> 01:38:00,347
It's going to be okay.

1546
01:38:01,448 --> 01:38:04,151
- Okay! Okay.
- Ow.

1547
01:38:08,389 --> 01:38:09,957
Ah fuck. Ow.

1548
01:38:12,527 --> 01:38:14,428
Okay. Okay.

1549
01:38:14,962 --> 01:38:17,164
Sit the fuck down.

1550
01:38:22,202 --> 01:38:23,571
Fuck you!

1551
01:38:43,157 --> 01:38:46,460
Can I use your phone?
Mine's dead.

1552
01:38:56,303 --> 01:39:03,210
Umm... can you...?

1553
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,522
Hello?

1554
01:39:14,556 --> 01:39:17,324
Hey, Dad?

1555
01:39:18,125 --> 01:39:20,294
Jesus, Jenny, where
the hell have you been?

1556
01:39:20,528 --> 01:39:22,597
Where are you? I've been
trying to call you for--

1557
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:25,533
I'm fine. I promise.

1558
01:39:25,567 --> 01:39:27,434
Well, did you make it
to the clinic?

1559
01:39:29,169 --> 01:39:31,138
Mm-hmm.

1560
01:39:31,171 --> 01:39:33,040
You're not lying this
time, are you?

1561
01:39:34,107 --> 01:39:35,677
Nope.

1562
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:37,277
Well, best of luck,
all right?

1563
01:39:37,311 --> 01:39:38,780
No, but Dad, hey--

1564
01:39:38,813 --> 01:39:40,314
Yeah?

1565
01:39:41,783 --> 01:39:44,384
Hey dad, can I talk
to her, please?

1566
01:39:48,288 --> 01:39:49,591
Dad?

1567
01:39:49,624 --> 01:39:51,358
Not sure if that's a good
idea.

1568
01:39:51,391 --> 01:39:57,364
Dad, please! Please.
I just need to hear her voice.

1569
01:39:57,397 --> 01:40:01,435
Listen, it's late.
All right, all right.

1570
01:40:01,468 --> 01:40:06,473
All right. Give me a second.
Hey honey, come here.

1571
01:40:06,508 --> 01:40:07,709
Hello?

1572
01:40:07,742 --> 01:40:10,110
Hey. Hey, Booger.

1573
01:40:10,410 --> 01:40:14,147
- Mommy!
- Yeah, it's Mommy.

1574
01:40:15,115 --> 01:40:16,651
Where are you?

1575
01:40:18,252 --> 01:40:22,356
- I'm gonna go see the doctor.
- Are you sick again?

1576
01:40:24,592 --> 01:40:27,294
Yes, honey. I'm sick again.

1577
01:40:28,428 --> 01:40:32,032
When are you
coming home?
- When I get all better.

1578
01:40:32,867 --> 01:40:38,405
- When will that be?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1579
01:40:39,239 --> 01:40:42,810
I miss you, Mommy.
Grandpa smells funny.

1580
01:40:42,844 --> 01:40:49,049
Yeah, I know, Daddy...
Grampy, he smells funny.

1581
01:40:49,717 --> 01:40:52,520
Can you read me
a bedtime story tonight?

1582
01:40:56,290 --> 01:40:58,225
Mommy?

1583
01:40:58,258 --> 01:41:01,395
Not tonight, honey.
Soon, though.

1584
01:41:02,897 --> 01:41:05,299
Grandpa says I have
to brush my teeth now.

1585
01:41:05,332 --> 01:41:09,604
So I gotta go. Mommy,
do I have to brush my teeth?

1586
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:15,142
Yeah. Yes, baby,
you have to brush your teeth.

1587
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:22,115
Oh, man! Okay.
Bye, Mommy. I love you
soooo much.

1588
01:41:22,416 --> 01:41:25,419
Even when you're sick.
Here's Grandpa.

1589
01:41:25,753 --> 01:41:27,755
Love you too, Booger.

1590
01:41:27,789 --> 01:41:31,693
Listen, Jenny, we really
need to have a talk--

1591
01:41:49,711 --> 01:41:51,278
I'm going to go now.

1592
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:54,147
I hope you get better.

1593
01:41:54,882 --> 01:41:56,483
I hope you do, too.

1594
01:41:58,485 --> 01:42:01,856
Guess we're kinda at
the right place to do that, huh?

1595
01:42:26,581 --> 01:42:27,949
I'm here.

1596
01:42:27,982 --> 01:42:30,918
Congratulations!
You have won!

1597
01:42:30,952 --> 01:42:34,154
You have been selected
for an all-inclusive--

1598
01:43:02,382 --> 01:43:05,419
Ugh. Fuck.

1599
01:46:00,862 --> 01:46:02,897
What kind of car
was it?

1600
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:04,932
- I don't know, man?
- A black one?

1601
01:46:04,966 --> 01:46:07,168
Are you using
the, ah, Find My Phone app?

1602
01:46:07,201 --> 01:46:09,170
Yeah, dude,
it says it's right there.

1603
01:46:09,203 --> 01:46:11,072
Are you calling it
right now?

1604
01:46:11,105 --> 01:46:13,674
- Yep. It's ringing.
- Sh-sh-sh, you hear that?

1605
01:46:13,975 --> 01:46:15,843
Oh, it's right there!
Right there.

1606
01:46:15,877 --> 01:46:18,045
Boom-chaka-laka!
I knew it!

1607
01:46:18,079 --> 01:46:20,514
Looks like this dude
had a hell of a night.

1608
01:46:20,548 --> 01:46:22,984
Ah, shit, is there
puke everywhere?

1609
01:46:23,584 --> 01:46:25,385
Shit, man,
is that a shell casing?

1610
01:46:26,888 --> 01:46:27,722
Rob, I'm seeing
blood up here.
Er... uh... eh...

1611
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:31,959
Yeah, that was not me.

1612
01:46:31,993 --> 01:46:34,762
Fuck me!
Should we call this in?

1613
01:46:35,229 --> 01:46:38,065
Goddamn it, Brock,
what the fuck is this?

1614
01:46:38,566 --> 01:46:41,836
Hmm. I ah...
I guess there's a first time
for everything, huh, boys?
