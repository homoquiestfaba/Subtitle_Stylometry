1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,399
Boy you had me from the start,

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,599
by the way you stay, the way
you wrote it for me, naked

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,999
and I felt your

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,999
energy

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,099
wasn't used to being loved and
treated differently, YEAH

6
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,359
but something went wrong.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,229
our signals got crossed

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,089
Now we're on completely
differnt pages

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,029
Let's go where we were

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,619
When no one gets hurt

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,749
Baby keep it right there don't

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,399
stress, the

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,999
flow,

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,399
trying to pick the pace up.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,899
We should take it slow,

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,499
baby.

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,599
Keep your focus.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,799
Don't you make me change

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,299
my mind

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,949

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,529
You have the right. To remain
silent.

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,529
Okay daddy!

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,049

We went to the bar

226
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,799
After work,

227
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,999
after the bar, we went to the
club

228
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,499

229
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,899
I couldn't hear you calling my
phone

230
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,229
So why you ain't text me or
something?

231
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,619
Because-

232
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,219
I had one too many drinks

233
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,289
and-

234
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,799
I didn't want to drive all the
way home.

235
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,099
did you want me to drive home
drunk?

236
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,649

237
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,839
Why I gotta do all that

238
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,839

239
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,649

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,289

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,609

You should've kept it going

251
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,469

eventually

252
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,599

00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,419

272
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,299

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,099
Cut it out.

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,599

278
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,829

00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,649

Cut it out. I'm trying to cook.

283
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,299
Look, I'm just a little tired
from last night, okay?

284
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,899
You wouldn't be tired if you
wasn't hanging out.

285
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,049
Not fair.

286
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,599
Not fair

287
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,599
I mean, what's up?

288
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,289

Something wrong with me.

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,599
No, baby.

292
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,999
It's nothing wrong with you.

293
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,399
I'm just a little tired from
last night.

294
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:31,999
That's all

295
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,899

296
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,199
any other way.

297
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,499

I'm just a little tired

305
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,899
after I finish cooking on, make
it up to you.

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,099

307
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,199

What do you want?

310

I said, all right, don't keep
rushing me.

311
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,199
I still haven't figured out
what I'm going to say to Daniel.

312
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,099
Didn't I say.

313
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,699

00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,419
Why do you assume she's
cheating?

538
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,559

she come on super late nights

540
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,599
and I feel like it's the little
thing she lying about

541
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,499
Anything else

542
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:05,999

543
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,699

Wait to Daniel sees this shit.

578
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,779

579
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,699
Things with Daniel.

581
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,899
Why?

582
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,899
To be with you, why else.

583
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,529

584
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,159
you can't do that

585
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,389
You do that

586
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,389
that'll crush my brother

587
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,149
I can't bare to see him hurt
like that.

588
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,579
so what

589
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,559
what we're doing now isn't
hurting him?

590
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,379
listen I just don't want him to
find out alright

591
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,379
atleast not right now

592
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,789
So what I'm supposed to just
keep sneaking behind his back,

593
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,399
I don't want him anymore.

594
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,399

595
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,499

597
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,089
but you cant just

598
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,519
break up with him

599
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,379
and then

600
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,959

601
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:04,969
how would that look?

602
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,099
We do that, he's gonna know
that it's been me this whole time

603
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,099
he's gonna put two and two
together.

604
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,099
and I just can't be on my
brothers bad side alright

605
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:16,198
So what, wait how I feel
doesn't matter in this.

606
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:17,999

607
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,599

01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:22,279
up.

1131
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,299
Maybe

1132
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,398
maybe if we pay him and he'll
just give us the pictures

1133
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:31,899
instead of showing Daniel

1134
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:34,999
I don't know

1135
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,199
That doesn't work.

1136
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,299
I'm gonna have to take him out.

1137
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:40,999
It's no other way.

1138
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,599
As in... Kill.

1139
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:49,199
Nah

1140
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:50,699
that's

1141
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,099
that's too far.

1142
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,499
Let's just leave

1143
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,399
you and me

1144
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:56,299
and

1145
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,999
get far away from him and
Daniel.

1146
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,259
Listen, I'll have it if that's
the only way

1147
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:05,199
It's not the only way

1148
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,599
if you kill him and go to jail
for Life.

1149
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,699
How are you going to be a
father to your son?

1150
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:13,299
What are you talking about
father?

1151
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,899
I don't have any kids.

1152
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:19,289
Not yet!

1153
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,319
Hold on

1154
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,319
are you serious right now

1155
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:26,279
are you trying to tell me that
you're pregnant?

1156
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:28,209
yeah,

1157
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:29,949
I am,

1158
01:07:30,770 --> 01:07:31,769
We're having a baby!

1159
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,249
wow

1160
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,049
are you sure it's mine and not
my brothers?

1161
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,829
I've only been having sex with
you for the past 5 months!

1162
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,199
I'm sure it's yours.

1163
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:47,399
Wow.

1164
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:49,799
Okay.

1165
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:53,999
Okay.

1166
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:54,399
Listen.

1167
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,899
You gonna move in with me
alright!

1168
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:00,299
I want you to go to the house.

1169
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,799
get all of your stuff.

1170
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:03,699
Are you serious?

1171
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:05,629
as a heart attack

1172
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,199
Are you coming with me?

1173
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:10,899
What if Daniel's home?

1174
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,099
listen

1175
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,119
He's still playing basketball
alright

1176
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,989
I'll head there to make sure
that he's still there

1177
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,989
I'll text you

1178
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:20,249
once I've gotten there okay.

1179
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:21,589
get all of your things out the
house

1180
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,639
because once you leave we're
not coming back

1181
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:27,148
okay

1182
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:29,028
okay then

1183
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:30,599
I'll See you soon.

1184
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:37,398
-bullshit

1185
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:37,999
You know what?

1186
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,898
Get the fuck out of here.

1187
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,299
I'd better not see you around
here again.

1188
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:40,799
Fuck you

1189
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:29,749
Daniel

1190
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:30,999
What are you doing here?

1191
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:32,799
I shouldn't be here

1192
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:33,389
I live here

1193
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:38,839
I just thought you was-

1194
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,259
you were at work

1195
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,898
I've decided to take the day
off.

1196
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,099
Imma be Right here.

1197
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:51,898
Are you okay?

1198
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,199
Yeah.

1199
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,199
Why would you ask that?

1200
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,799
because you're day drinking

1201
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,399
and you don't usually do that.

1202
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,399
Don't even worry about all that.

1203
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,299
Sit down.

1204
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,299
Now.

1205
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:32,999
Rachel-

1206
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,799
Do you remember the first time
we said, I love you.

1207
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,499
we said it so many times,

1208
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,199
I just

1209
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,199
can't remember when the first
time was

1210
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,899
well, if you actually meant to
say it,

1211
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:58,999
you would remember it

1212
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,089
And if you was telling a lie
and I mean, you just wanted to

1213
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:03,999
forget it.

1214
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,299
See when I said it,

1215
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,699
I meant it.

1216
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,199
Because even at that time, I
remember every day,

1217
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,999
the place, the moment,

1218
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:16,999
the park

1219
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,399
it was raining that day.

1220
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,699
and even for a Split Second,

1221
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,199
I know you had on heels.

1222
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,699
I had to carry you to the
shelter.

1223
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,799
To the point where no cars were
there

1224
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,399
about a mile off.

1225
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:34,399
And after I did all that.

1226
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,599
I knew, I have to tell you.

1227
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,699
I said it right to you.

1228
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,399
I love you.

1229
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,499
Do you remember that?

1230
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,699
Of course not you don't
remember that

1231
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,199
you don't remember anything
about me.

1232
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,369
Don't-Do that Daniel

1233
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,799
It's not like that.

1234
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,299
I may not remember every time
but

1235
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,899
I love you from the bottom of
my heart

1236
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,299
you know that

1237
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:07,699
you mean that?

1238
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,799
Do you really love me from the
bottom of your heart?

1239
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:14,799
Yes.

1240
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,499
What's in the envelope?

1241
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,199
Do you really mean it?

1242
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,199
When you say you love me.

1243
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,599
What's in this envelope?

1244
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,599
Doesn't even matter.

1245
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,399
I could put it all behind me.

1246
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:45,699
Rachel,

1247
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,599
will you marry me?

1248
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,599
I don't know what to say.

1249
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,099
I just

1250
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:12,899
can't right now.

1251
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,499
You can

1252
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,699
You just don't want to marry me.

1253
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:39,509
I can stop everything

1254
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:41,969
and make this work

1255
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:46,929
but when will you marry me?

1256
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:53,699
I don't know.

1257
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,119
When you gone tell me what's
going on?

1258
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,699
How long has what been going on?

1259
01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:25,899
Don't fucking play me.

1260
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,599
Like I'm stupid.

1261
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,299
You know what the fuck I'm
talking about?

1262
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,399
You were fucking him.

1263
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:40,289
You're drunk and confused put
the bottom down maybe you've

1264
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,099

Like I'm stupid.

1269

It was right in my fucking face

1270
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,499

1271
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,699

1436
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,319
His brother on the other hand

1438
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,999

01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,499
I tried to show you

1448
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,699
and it still wasn't enough.

1449
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:20,999
I really had hopes and dreams
in it.

1450
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:22,699

01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,599
