2
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,800
She came along the alley, and up the backstairs 
the way she always used to

3
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,360
Doc hadn’t seen her for over a year, no body had.

4
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,220
Back then it was always sandals, bottom half of

5
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,040
a flower-print bikini..

6
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,520
and a faded Country Joe and the Fish T-shirt..

7
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,360
Tonight she was all in flatland gear..

8
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,360
hair a lot shorter than he remembered..

9
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,420
Looking just like she swore she’d never look.

10
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,980
Pssst..!

11
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,620
Is that you Shasta ?!

12
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,280
Thinks he’s hallucinating

13
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,800
No, just a..new package I guess.

14
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,560
I need your help Doc.

15
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,880
You know I have an office now!

16
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,600
It’s like a day job and everything.

17
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,520
I looked into the phone book, 
I almost went over there..

18
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,300
Then I thought better for every one 
if this looks like a secret rendezvous.

19
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,480
Somebody keeping a close eye..?

20
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,520
Just spent an hour on surface streets 
trying to make it look good.

21
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,420
Uhm...you wanna beer..?

22
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,300
How about a beer you’n’I

23
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,380
Yeah

24
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,020
There’s this guy.

25
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,460
Gentleman of the straight world persuasion?

26
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,560
Ok Doc...

27
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,100
He’s married.

28
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,980
Some ah...money situation ?

29
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,440
And the wife uhm..she knows about you?

30
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,280
She’s seeing somebody too.

31
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,100
But it’s not just the usual lie..

32
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,180
I think they’re working on some 
creepy little scheme

33
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,560
To make off with hubby’s fortune?

34
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,540
I heard of that happening once or twice!

35
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,000
And you want me to do what exactly ?

36
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,220
They want me in on it

37
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,720
They think I’m the one who 
can reach him when he's vulnerable

38
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,560
as much as he ever gets.

39
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,620
Bare ass and asleep.

40
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,620
I Knew you'd understand.

41
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,640
Are you still trying to figure out if it’s 
right or wrong Shasta?

42
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,900
Worse than that...

43
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,620
How much loyalty I owe him.

44
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,280
Um..groovy!

45
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,760
All right..if..emotions aside...

46
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,780
Let’s look at the rent..

47
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,980
How much of your rent he’s been picking up?

48
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,080
All of it.

49
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,480
Pretty uh..hefty?

50
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,180
For Hancock Park..?

51
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,320
You’re giving him IOY’s for everything of course!

52
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,200
Fucker..If I’d known you’re still this bitter.

53
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,660
Me...trying to be professional that’s all

54
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,140
All right, how much is the..

55
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,720
wifey and boyfriend offering to cut you in for..?

56
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,140
It isn’t what you’re thinking Doc.

57
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,140
Don’t worry thinking comes later...

58
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,620
What else...!

59
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,080
I’m not sure...

60
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,720
Sounds like they want to commit him to a loony bin

61
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,520
Back when they were together she can go weeks

62
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,520
without anything more complicated than a pout

63
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,600
Now she’s laying some heavy combination of face ingredients on Doc that he couldn't read at all..

64
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,520
Come to think of it, there’s never been this 
much sorrow in her voice.

65
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,620
Heard you’re seeing someone downtown..?

66
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,960
Penny..?

67
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,780
Some kinda junior D.A. ?

68
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Yeah, you think somebody down there 
can stop this before it happen?

69
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,860
Not too many places I could go with this Doc

70
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,980
I’ll talk to Penny, see what we can..see

71
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,420
Your happy couple..they have names ?

72
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,000
It’s Micky Wolfmann

73
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,200
Always in the paper? The real estate big shot?

74
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,220
Yeah

75
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,440
Can’t tell anyone about this Doc

76
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,660
Deaf and dumb...it's kinda of my job.

77
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,260
How do I reach you?

78
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,840
You don’t

79
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,200
I move out of my old place staying where I can anymore

80
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,040
Don’t ask

81
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
There’s room here!

82
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,980
Walk down my car ?

83
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,400
Someone might be watching

84
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,660
You never did let me down Doc

85
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,780
-Don’t worry uhm..
-No, I mean really..ever.

86
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,480
No you’re always true

87
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,760
You don’t have to go

88
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,760
Watch your toes.

89
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,240
Doc ran through all the things he hadn’t asked Shasta..

90
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,060
Like how much she’s come to depend on Wolfmann’s guaranteed level of ease and power..

91
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,760
And least askable of all..how passionately did she 
really feel about old Mickey.

92
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,520
-Hey, what’s up Doc? 
-Hey dude.

93
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
-What’s up man? What’s going on?

94
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:14,040
Doc knew the likely reply: I love him, what else!

95
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,460
With the unspoken foot note that the word these days 
was being way too over used.

96
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,740
-You hungry?

97
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,860
-Let’s go eat some place

98
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,280
So when when Doc and Dino came in that night..

99
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,340
It wasn’t just the usual hungry doper thing..

100
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,920
It was something else.

101
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,140
And with Neptune moving at last out of 
it’s Scorpio death trip..

102
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,980
and rising into the Sagitarian light of 
the higher mind..

103
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,780
it was bound to be something love related..

104
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,160
and I thought I knew what it was.

105
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,160
So...!

106
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
She stuck her head in for a minuet.

107
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,540
You’re feeling broken up ?

108
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,660
It was kinda weird seeing her again, you know?

109
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,800
you know I figured next time I see her 
would be on the tube?

110
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I mean not in person.

111
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,760
Well, you better do something about this

112
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,500
yeah again?

113
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,900
Can’t tell you enough, change your hair, 
change your life.

114
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,540
What do you recommend ?

115
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,020
It’s up to you,  follow your intuition!?

116
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,860
Hello.

117
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,640
Hey Aunt Reet.

118
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,200
Yes honey, make it quick. I gotta live one tonight, 
and I totally fucked up my face.

119
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,180
Oh, Ok..Mickey Wolfmann, what can you tell me?

120
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,940
Power house in L.A real estate..

121
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,140
from the desert to the sea..

122
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,700
technically Jewish but wants to be a Nazi..

123
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,840
What’s he to you ?

124
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,020
Possible case..say I wanted to hang out and rap 
with this Wolfmann?

125
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,460
I’d say it’s a really bad idea, he goes around 
with a dozen bikers..

126
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,940
mostly Aryan brotherhood alumni.

127
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,480
Wow..wow..wow..wait, I flunked social studies but..ah..

128
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,660
Jews and Aryan brotherhood..isn’t there 
something about hatred?

129
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,620
No, Mickey is eccentric, more and more lately..

130
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,160
I’d say stoned out of his fucking mind since he 
discovered drugs..

131
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,160
no offense to you Doc.

132
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,500
So where would I find him...like accidentally?

133
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,640
Try the Channel View Estates, his latest insult 
to the environment.

134
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,060
The..the one that..ah..BigFoot Bijornsen does 
the commercial for?

135
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,060
That’s the one.

136
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,200
Maybe your old copper is the one who should be..
taking care of your case.

137
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,120
Yeah well I did think about going to BigFoot 
with this but..

138
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,060
just as I reached for the phone..history and all, I thought

139
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,560
Oooof!

140
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,880
Well may be you’re better off with the Nazis.

141
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,860
All right, all right.

142
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,420
I got major liquid-liner...if it's all right I 
gotta get off now Larry.

143
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,140
Hey man, I don’t want you paying rent..

144
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,520
rent’s a hassle..I wanna see you in your own pad..

145
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,780
How did BigFoot...?!

146
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,560
The Channel View Estates, Artige's newest and 
grooviest housing development..

147
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,380
no buzz-kill credit checks..

148
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,400
no minimum down payments..that's not your bag..

149
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,900
but check this out: fully equipped kitchen..

150
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,980
with automatic self cleaning oven and breakfast nook..

151
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,400
out of sight..

152
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,600
attached one car and available two car garage..

153
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,600
and best of all..

154
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,640
a view of the domingus flood controlled channel that can only be described in two words..

155
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,640
Right On!

156
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,920
What’s up Doc ?!

157
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,080
Michael Wolfmann, one of Los Angeles most prominent 
real estate developers..

158
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,180
has announced in a Wednesday press conference..

159
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,560
he’s proceeding with construction of several new 
urban housing developments..

160
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,340
the most immediate to be called Channel View Estates.

161
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,800
-Doc... 
-Howdy.

162
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,300
Pop came down last night looking for you again.

163
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,400
-BigFoot !

164
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,980
-Yeah, that’s the one.

165
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,940
I wonder why he didn’t kick-in my door as usual ?!

166
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,680
He might’ve been thinking about it, but said something like..

167
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,680
tomorrow is another day..

168
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,680
Which would be today, right ?

169
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,380
Micke Wolfmann’s known for his outlandish advertising, 
and aggressive style..

170
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,740
and has been..ah..actively involved in the Southern California real estate development for the past...

171
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,360
-Good morning Doc. 
-Hey..good morning Petunia.

172
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
-I love your Afro!
-Oh yeah?

173
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,780
Doc, you have someone waiting in your office.

174
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,560
-Doctor.. 
-Doctor..

175
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,920
Hi there...sorry to keep you waiting.

176
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,540
Doctor Sportello ?

177
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,160
That’s right..what is it my brother?

178
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,880
Peace..I’m Tariq Khalil.

179
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,520
Cool...sit down

180
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,820
How can help you today ?

181
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,700
There’s this white boy I was in the joint with..

182
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,680
Aryan brotherhood..we did some business and all..

183
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,840
Now we’re both out and he still owes me..

184
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,180
I can’t tell you the details but..

185
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,180
it’s a whole lot of money.

186
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,660
What about his name..?

187
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,660
Glenn Charlock.

188
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,800
And a...you now where he’s staying now ?

189
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,460
I know where he works..

190
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,520
He’s a bodyguard for this building named Wolfmann.

191
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,320
Pardon my asking Mr. Khalil, how did you hear about me?

192
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,040
Sledge..Sledge Poutee.

193
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,880
Wow...flash from the past brother..

194
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,080
yeah

195
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,560
He said you helped him out of a situation back in 67.

196
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
First time I got shot at..

197
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,980
I hope you don’t mind an obvious question..

198
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,960
You know where this Glenn Charlock works, why not just go there and look him up directly?

199
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,040
Well because, Wolfmann likes to surround himself 
with the Aryan brotherhood..

200
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,500
day and night..

201
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,460
You see, outside of Glenn, I ain’t never liked 
the company of Nazis.

202
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,320
So a..send somebody who might get his head hammered?

203
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,100
More or less.

204
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,100
When you were inside, were you in ah..a  gang?

205
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,800
The Black Gorilla Family.

206
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,660
And you say you did business with who now..? 
The Aryan brotherhood?

207
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Listen..

208
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,780
We found we shared some of the similar opinions 
about the U.S government..

209
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,480
-That's all. 
-Mmm...I can dig.

210
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,640
There something else...?

211
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,220
Matter of fact there is..

212
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,620
my old street gang..the Artiza Crips...

213
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,200
see when I came home from chino..

214
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,800
I went looking for them and found out they 
ain’t just them gone..

215
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,140
but the whole turf itself!

216
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,860
What do you mean gone..?

217
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,140
Man I’m talking not there.

218
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,220
Ground up into little pieces, sea gulls 
pickin' all over it..

219
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,960
Man I thought i was tripping..

220
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,700
got in my car, drove around, came back, still gone

221
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,480
Nothing..nobody..

222
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,180
just a ghost town..

223
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,600
with a big sign that said coming to this site soon..

224
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,000
with a big ass ugly picture of some houses..

225
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,180
-And guess who the builder is? 
-Let me guess!

226
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,860
Wolfmann again.

227
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,400
Can you ah..show me up here on this map?

228
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,160
Long, sad history of L.A land use..

229
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,380
Mexican families..

230
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,900
bounced out of shava’s ravine to build 
the Dodgers stadium..

231
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,080
American Indians swept out of Bunker Hills for 
the music center..

232
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,420
and now Tariq’s neighborhood..

233
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,140
bulldozed aside for Channel View Estates.

234
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,440
Hello..!

235
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,580
Hi..I’m Jade, welcome to Chick Planet massage

236
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,100
Please take note of today’s pussy eater special..

237
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,880
which is all day till closing time.

238
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,120
-How much is it..? 
-14.95

239
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,760
Well not that 14.95 ain’t a totally groovy price..

240
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,560
but I’m actually trying to locate this guy 
who works for Mr. Wolfmann?

241
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,160
Ah...does he eat pussy ?

242
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,280
Fella named Glenn Charlock..?

243
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,080
Ah sure, Glenn, he comes in here..

244
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,960
he eats pussy.

245
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,060
Well Glenn and I were in chino round the same time, 
you seen hime today?

246
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,620
Are you a cop ?

247
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,760
No.

248
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,320
The reason I ask is if you’re a cop..

249
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,900
you'd be entitled to a free preview of our 
pussy eater special.

250
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,900
Well how about a licensed P.I ?

251
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,640
Hey Bambi...

252
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,360
So..where do we uhm..

253
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,100
Not you bong brain.

254
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,360
I thought it was here..pussy eaters special..
does that mean..

255
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,520
Congratulations...hippie scum..

256
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,120
Welcome to a world of inconvenience.

257
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,760
Well morning Sam..

258
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,000
like a bad luck planet in today’s horoscope..

259
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,040
Here’s the old, hippie-hating mad dog himself..

260
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,320
in the flesh..

261
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,080
Lieutenant Detective Christian F. 'BigFoot' Bjornsen..

262
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,880
SAG member, John Wayne walk..

263
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,440
flat top of Flintstones proportion..

264
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,840
and that little evil shit twinkle in his eye that says..

265
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,760
civil rights violations.

266
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,280
What’s up Doc..?

267
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,840
How about your ex-girlfriend ?

268
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,060
Shasta...Fay....Hepworth.

269
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,760
Shasta Fay Hepworth !

270
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,160
She’s a known intimate...

271
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,400
of Glen’s employer Mickey Wolfmann..

272
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,880
but do you think that Glenn and Shasta..

273
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,980
were....

274
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,320
F U C K I N G ing.

275
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,320
Fuckinging...?

276
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,640
Is that why you killed him ?

277
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,840
BigFoot..

278
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,640
Just how does it make you feel..?

279
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,160
I mean here you are still carrying the torch..

280
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,220
and here she is in the company of all those 
Nazi lovers.

281
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,100
Keep doing that BigFoot you’'re giving me a hard on.

282
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,440
Tough little white monkey..

283
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,860
as my friend Fatso Justin always says..

284
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,600
So our suspect, that’s you...

285
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,780
was having alleged midday nap so necessary 
to the hippie life style..

286
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,560
some sort of incident occurs in the vicinity of 
Channel View Estates..

287
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,980
fire arms are discharged, when the dust settles..

288
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,240
we found him on Glenn Charlock deceased..

289
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
but more compellingly for LAPD..

290
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,680
is the man Charlock was supposed to be guarding...

291
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,140
Michael Z. Wolfmann..has vanished..

292
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,860
giving local law enforcement less than..

293
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,960
24 hours before the Feds call it a kidnapping 
and come in to fuck..

294
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,120
everything up..

295
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,540
so perhaps,Sportello, you can help forestall this..

296
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,960
by providing the names of the other 
members of your cult.

297
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,840
Cult..?

298
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,580
No one would ever be stupid enough 
to attempt this alone..

299
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,820
which suggest some kind of Mansonoid conspiracy, 
wouldn't you agree?

300
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,660
No.

301
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,660
Look I’v been referred to..

302
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,180
more than one time..

303
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,780
by the L.A Times..

304
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,100
as a renaissance detective, OK?

305
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,540
which means I am many things..

306
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,020
One thing I am not is stupid..

307
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,720
so purely out of noblesse oblige..

308
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,000
I extend this assumption to cover you as well.

309
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,140
What the fuck..?

310
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,400
Hey Saunch.

311
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,020
What’s up Doc..!

312
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,180
You know you have no case here..

313
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,360
so if you’re gonna charge him you better..

314
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
otherwise, you have to let him go.

315
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,860
Saunch, remember who this is you’re talking to, this is 
BigFoot Bjornsen, renaissance cop.

316
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,120
I know who he is.

317
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,960
So, what’s the beef here exactly ?

318
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,440
It doesn’t have much to do with your speciality 
which I understand is Marine Law?

319
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,300
We got plenty of crime on the high seas Lieutenant.

320
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,440
Ok, well so far we have murder..

321
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
and kidnapping..

322
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,600
we can work-in pirates, if it would make you 
more comfortable..

323
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,580
-either way it’s high profile. 
-Yeah but ah...

324
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,620
Given you history of harassment with my client..

325
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,400
this will never make it to trial.

326
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,960
No I think we could probably take this all the way to trial..

327
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,120
but with our luck...the jury pool will be 99%..

328
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,200
hippie.

329
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,220
Well let’s change the venue to may be 
Orange County..

330
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,220
not as many hippies there you know?

331
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,260
Saunch, who are you working for ?

332
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,240
Clients pay me for work Doc..

333
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
clients pay me for work Doc.

334
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,780
So..?

335
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,620
I’ve decided I’m gonna kick Mr. Sportello.

336
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,100
You’re gonna kick him?

337
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,680
That's assault!

338
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,500
I think it’s police Lang. Saunch, it means cut me loose.

339
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
I’ll release the suspect at the impound Garage.

340
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,980
Promise...?

341
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,020
I promise.

342
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,800
Apparently a party of civilians had some training 
exercise in anti guerrilla war fare..

343
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,560
they may have assumed this construction site, 
not yet open for occupancy..

344
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,940
was deserted enough to provide a realistic setting..

345
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:09,120
for what we must assume was..only a 
harmless patriotic scenario.

346
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,400
-Hello. 
-Hey, it's me.

347
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,120
Hey.

348
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,520
Listen, we uhm....

349
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,000
we sent that police academy hot shot over to the last know address of Shasta Fay Hepworth.

350
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,840
Fuck, no. no..

351
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,840
Yeah they got there and it was a....

352
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,140
they looked through the window and a...

353
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,220
What...?

354
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,920
Tried to open the door and they just a...

355
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,720
they went in...you know!

356
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,540
she’s gone...

357
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,040
Sportello, she’s gone

358
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,320
She’s out there man.

359
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,580
Out there..?

360
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,300
Yeah.

361
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,080
what..what does that mean?

362
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,660
She’s disappeared just like her boyfriend Mickey,
and I thought you think there’s a connection.

363
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,820
-She’s disappeared? 
-Yeah, she's gone man...baby!

364
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,460
She’s gone? She disappeared..? What!

365
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,060
She went all groovy on us.

366
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,840
You know, BigFoot man...

367
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,700
can we just try to be fucking professional, just, 
just pretend to be professional.

368
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,980
-Shasta Fay Hepworth, she’s gone. 
-Fuck you.

369
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,560
Doc could never figure out what Shasta 
might've seen in him..

370
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,340
besides being just about the only doper she knew 
who didn’t use heroin..

371
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,200
freeing up a lot of time for both of them..

372
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:58,120
and he wasn’t any clearer about what had 
driven them apart either..

373
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,440
they each gradually located a different Karmic thermal..

374
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,860
watching the other glide away into different fates..

375
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,720
does it ever end? Of course it does..it did.

376
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,700
Hello..!

377
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,700
Em..Hello..!

378
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,180
Mr. Sportello..?

379
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,640
Aha

380
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,640
I got your number from the head shop..

381
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,980
down in ah..Cordida beach..

382
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,480
I’m calling about my husband, he was..

383
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,920
a close friend of a friend of yours..

384
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,120
Shasta Fay Hepworth..?

385
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,240
And uhm...your name is..?

386
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,680
Hope Harlingen..

387
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,980
And..your husband is..?

388
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,980
Dead.

389
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,060
Sorry to hear that.

390
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,060
-You wanna a cooky? 
-I'm all right, thank you.

391
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,300
So you never heard of him of his music?

392
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,160
Inside the surf-sax category he was this 
towering figure..

393
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,100
cause he actually improvised once and a while..

394
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,340
instead of just repeating the second and third 
chorus note for note..

395
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,300
Coy and I should’ve met cute but..
we actually met squalid..

396
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,680
Down in Oscar’s in St. Yesedra...?

397
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,520
Oh boy!

398
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,760
I had just run into this bathroom stall 
without checking first..

399
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,940
and I already had my finger down my throat 
to vomit up this big..

400
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,240
balloon of dope I just scored and...

401
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,360
there Coy sat..

402
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,820
gringo digestion..about to take this giant shit..

403
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,960
And we both let go at the same time and there’s 
just vomit and shit all over the place..

404
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,720
and with my head on his lap..

405
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,840
and to complicate things, he had this....hard on..

406
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,080
Sure.

407
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,800
One thing leads to another and..

408
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,040
we pretty much started shooting up together 
on a regular basis..

409
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,180
then, along comes little Amethyst..

410
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,700
I don’t know if you have the stomach for it, but..

411
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,160
this is...what we had her looking like..

412
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,440
Everybody helpfully pointed out how..

413
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,520
the hair was actually coming through 
my breast milk but..

414
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,700
Ahhhh.....aahm..

415
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,620
we couldn’t afford formula, you know!

416
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,100
It’s a long way from where we are now.

417
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,480
Yeah, no seems like you’re doing real good.

418
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,840
I’m a drug counselor.

419
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,560
Sorry..?!

420
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,260
A drug counselor?

421
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,480
Trying to..talk kids into sensible drug use..

422
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,520
What do you think of my chompers ?

423
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,060
you like them..?

424
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,560
No no, I, yes, yeah..no I hadn’t noticed.

425
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,680
The heroin sucks the calcium of out of 
your body like a vampire..

426
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,160
if you use it for any length of time your 
teeth just go all to hell..

427
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,840
and that’s the good part.

428
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,220
So this thing that happened to your husband, how can I help you?

429
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,920
Mr. Sportello I don’t think Coy is really dead.

430
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,360
But..did you ID his body ?

431
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,340
No..

432
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,360
Who ever it was that called just..

433
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,340
said that...one of his band members did that.

434
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,480
What do you mean who ever called? The police?

435
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,560
I mean it’s ah..it’s supposed to be next of kin.

436
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,860
And then this deposit shows up..

437
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,560
close to his disappearance.

438
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,960
Interesting sum.

439
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,920
Why would this big deposit just suddenly 
appear in my account?

440
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,680
I went to the bank, I talked to the bank manager 
for an hour..

441
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,140
he kept saying over and over..
you just lost your deposit slip..

442
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,620
you just lost your deposit slip, 
you just lost your deposit slip..

443
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,660
and I don’t lose...deposit slips this big.

444
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,020
Do you have a spare picture of Coy I could borrow?

445
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,020
That I do have.

446
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,040
These were perilous times..

447
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,960
astrologically speaking for dopers..

448
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,700
 especially those of high school age..

449
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,280
for being born, most of them, under a 90 degree aspect..

450
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,100
the unluckiest angle possible..

451
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,600
between Neptune..

452
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,200
the dopers' planet..

453
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,280
and Uranus, the planet of rude surprises.

454
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,500
Doc had known it to happen that those 
left behind would refuse..

455
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,240
to believe that people they loved..

456
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,460
or even took the same classes with, 
were really dead..

457
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,440
they came up with all kinds of alternate stories...

458
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,540
so it wouldn’t have to be true.

459
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,000
How did Coy and Shasta know each other?

460
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,080
She..picked us up hitchhiking once..

461
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,580
I think Coy and her stayed in touch somehow, 
I don’t really know for sure.

462
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,660
Alright well...I’ll call you when I know something.

463
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,180
Thank you.

464
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,600
Shasta has mentioned a possible laughing academy angle..

465
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,980
to Mickey Wolfmann’s matrimonial drama..

466
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,780
and Doc thought it might be interesting to see how..

467
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,660
society page super star, Mrs. Sloane Wolfmann..

468
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,340
would react when somebody brought up the topic..

469
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,060
If Mickey was currently being held against his will 
in some private nut house..

470
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,700
then Doc’s immediate chore would be to try 
and find out which one.

471
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,920
Do you like the lighting ?

472
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,000
Aha...

473
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,700
Jimmy Wong Hau did it for us..years ago..

474
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:08,380
Luz,  the midday refrescos now if you would’t mind

475
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,220
Shall we sit ?

476
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,840
Now, your husband was planning to endow 
a new wing for our facility..

477
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,120
he actually tendered us a sum in advance..

478
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,860
some how it didn’t seem right to keep the money..

479
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,740
while so little is known of his where abouts...

480
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,940
so we’d like to refund you the sum..

481
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,940
and if, as we all pray..

482
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,220
when Mr. Wolfmann is heard from again..
well then perhaps..

483
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,780
the process can resume..again.

484
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,780
We did recently endow another facility..in Ojai..

485
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,600
the Chryskylodon Institute.

486
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,760
Chriscolodon..?

487
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,680
It’s an ancient Indian word that means serenity.

488
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,700
Ah, of course.

489
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,240
Are you some how a subsidiary ?

490
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,800
Perhaps one of our sister sanatoria.

491
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,240
-Mr. Riggs Warbling...my spiritual coach.

492
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,240
-How do you do... 
-Pleasurable.

493
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,220
Well if you can tell where to send the refund 
and what form you like it in..

494
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,900
Small bills, with non-consecutive serials..

495
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,900
Riggs, enough...

496
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,540
He’s always making these terrible jokes, I'm so sorry.

497
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,640
Perhaps if one of your company officers..

498
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,140
simply endorsed Michael’ check back to 
one of his accounts.

499
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,900
Of course, let us know the account number..

500
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,540
and its good as in the mail.

501
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,400
-Let me find you the deposit form. 
-Wonderful.

502
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,040
So this is Riggs, the spiritual advisor..

503
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,620
and there is Sloane..

504
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,200
 maybe not so much English rose as English daffodil...

505
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,320
and this is LAPD..

506
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,380
busy as ever, protecting and serving..

507
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,220
getting in some last minute free catering before 
the Feds show up..

508
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:47,040
and there’s Luz, the sexy chicana housekeeper..

509
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,980
or, pretending to be?!

510
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,680
some kidnapping!

511
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,080
Doc would bet an ounce of seedless Hawaiian..

512
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,080
and then throw in a pack of ZigZags..

513
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,960
 that Sloane and old Riggs here were 
fucking regularly..

514
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,340
and that this was the BF Shasta had mentioned..

515
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,260
did Shasta have a room of her own here?

516
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,060
or did they all just cozy up together?

517
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,940
-I’m ticklish little babe. 
-I like that.

518
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,740
Keep looking, I’m in there somewhere..

519
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,420
Vicky....Roxy..

520
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,200
here I am....cute..ha?

521
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,700
My tits aren’t really that big but..it’s 
the thought that counts.

522
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:56,260
Did ah, all you ladies pose for these ?

523
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,760
A guy over in North Hollywood does custom work

524
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,080
And ah..would about that ah girl that’s gone missing?

525
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,780
Shasta? yeah, she’s in there some place..

526
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,300
you know Mickey used to take me to 
the shower to fuck..

527
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,380
and I never got to do anything on that 
groovy bed in there

528
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,760
Luz...(speaks Japanese)

529
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
-Another time perhaps ? -Aha

530
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,420
BigFoot...!

531
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,280
Something has been puzzling Doc now for a while..

532
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,500
mainly, what exactly the fuck was with BigFoot here?

533
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,280
as much as he liked to stay and chat..

534
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,500
he had a lunch date to keep..

535
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,600
with part-time squeeze deputy D.A Penny Kimball..

536
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,340
It was only because someone else had cancelled that she was able to pencil him in..

537
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,860
and Doc didn’t want to fuck up her act..

538
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,240
considering they were meeting in public.

539
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,840
Hi

540
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,140
This Wolfmann-Charlock case..

541
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,280
apparently one of your girlfriends is a principal.

542
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,300
I just heard that she skipped.

543
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,300
Let me put it to you like this..

544
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,400
How close were you to this Shasta Fay Hepworth?

545
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,380
I’ve been asking myself that very question.

546
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,880
It was all over years ago..

547
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,900
-months, I don’t now. 
-Years?

548
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,860
if you Hadn’t you come along babe who knows 
how bad it might’v got.

549
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,680
True, you were a fucking mess when I met you.

550
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,720
How about now?

551
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Old times aside..

552
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,760
have you had any contact with her in the last, say week or so?

553
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
Well, funny you should ask..

554
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,480
she called me up a couple of days ago before 
Mickey Wolfmann disappeared..

555
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,740
told me a story about how his wife and her boyfriend..

556
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,460
were plotting to hustle Mickey into booby hatch..

557
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,660
and grab all his money?

558
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,600
so I sure hope that you guys or the cops..

559
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
or whoever, are looking into that.

560
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,820
With your years of experience as a P.I would you 
call that a reliable lead?

561
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,820
I’ve know worse..

562
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,220
Oh, I can did, you all just gonna ignore that?

563
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,540
Some hippie chick with boyfriend trouble, brain's all...

564
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,540
mushed up with dope, sex, and rock’n’roll ?

565
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,900
-Never seen you so emotional Doc. 
-The lights are out usually..

566
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,900
I never see you during the day Penny.

567
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,720
You didn’t tell Lieut. Bjornsten any of this..

568
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,400
when he pulled you in at the crime scene.

569
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,500
Ok, it’s because I promised Shasta I’d come talk to you first..

570
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,820
see if anybody at the D.A shop can help out with this..

571
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,820
now I tried to call you, day and night no reply

572
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,820
You tried to call me? Day and night?

573
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,820
And ah, yeah look, I forgot..I don’t know..

574
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,340
All I know is that next thing, Shasta’s missing..

575
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,460
Wolfmann’s gone and Glenn Charlock is dead.

576
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,060
Bjornsten seems to think you are as good a suspect as any.

577
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,960
Seems to? what do mean..

578
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
you’ve been talking to BigFoot about me?

579
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
Doc...please.

580
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,340
Besides, maybe you did it.

581
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,340
Has that crossed your mind?

582
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,560
 -Maybe you just forgot? 
-What? did do what?

583
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
-Kill Glenn Charlock. 
-Kill him?!

584
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,560
-Yeah. 
-What?

585
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,200
How would I forget something like that?

586
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,700
Grass, and who knows what else?

587
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,060
I’m only a light smoker.

588
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,440
How many joints have you had today?

589
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,580
-I have to check the log book. 
-Can't remember?

590
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,120
I don’t see how my smoking has any link..

591
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,360
to the Wolfmann, Charlock, Shasta case

592
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,000
No?

593
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,740
Then how come Miss Hepworth dismantled your relationship?

594
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,740
She got other fish to fry.

595
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,680
Would you say you’re still in love with her?

596
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,860
No.

597
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,860
Take off your glasses.

598
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,880
No.

599
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,880
I’m not..wait

600
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,700
I’ve a hectic week ahead of me, so unless things heat up 
dramatically, I hope you understand.

601
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
Walk me back to work ?

602
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,220
I’m agent Flatweed, this is agent Borderline..FBI

603
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,020
I just have to use the bathroom.

604
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,500
It’s been brought to our attention that not too long ago..

605
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,100
you had a visit from a black prison militant 
calling himself Tariq Khalil.

606
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,100
we naturally became curious.

607
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,340
Let’s talk upstairs Larry.

608
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,340
Did I miss an episode?

609
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,120
 I love you guys every sunday night at 8 pm.

610
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,400
We like investigating and spending energy..

611
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
on black nationalist hate groups.

612
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,740
It’s the chronology really..

613
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,740
 Khalil visits you place of business..

614
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,340
the next day a know prison acquaintance of his..

615
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,840
Glenn Charlock, is slain..

616
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,880
Michael Wolfmann disappears and you 
get arrested on suspicion and..

617
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,600
somewhat mysteriously let go again.

618
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,180
Well have you talked to BigFoot Bjornsen about all this?

619
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,180
Cause he’s gonna tell you about this kinda shit.

620
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,760
Mr. Bjornsen’s antipathy at the federal level is well known.

621
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Ah..some guys are like that..

622
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,020
so..what is it you want with me?

623
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,300
Ordinarily we’re the ones asking the questions here.

624
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,860
Sure thing fellas but....ah..

625
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,220
aren’t we all in the same business ?

626
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,900
There’s no need to be insulting

627
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,740
Why don’t you just go ahead and tell us..

628
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,560
what Mr. Khalil had to say when he visited you the other day?

629
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,320
Cause it’s privileged, and I'm inclined, that’s why.

630
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,100
If it has a bearing on the Wolfmann case..

631
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
then we may have to disagree.

632
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,260
Look, I really wish I could help you guys out but..

633
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,020
I can’t figure is if you’re so focused on the black panthers,

634
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,240
then what’s with your interest in Mickey Wolfmann...

635
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:48,420
Unless somebody ah..playing Monopoly 
with federal housing money?

636
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,480
You figure Mickey’s kidnapping is a black panther operation?

637
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,940
They put the snatch on Mickey trying to prove 
a political point, or maybe ah..

638
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,660
a nice shot at some ransom money.

639
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,380
So maybe you’v at least start putting that forward as a cover up story for what did happen.

640
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,100
Do you realize how thoroughly we can fuck your life up?

641
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,180
All right...could I be frank a minute?

642
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,940
Why stop now..please.

643
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,440
You be Dino, you be the other guy..

644
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,180
and tell Penny Davis Jr. what a lovely day we had..

645
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:25,820
Thank you.

646
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,820
As a COINTELPRO informant you could be making..

647
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,000
up to $300 a month Larry.

648
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,740
Just, consider that.

649
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,320
U.S dollars ?

650
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,880
And we’ll through in a book of Mormon...free.

651
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,880
Doc, a mysterious young Oriental cutie..

652
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,040
 just dropped off a package for you at the front desk..!

653
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,100
Well, it’s dark and lonely work but somebody’s gotta do it, right?

654
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,400
Heard they cut you loose..

655
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,800
need to see you about something..

656
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,480
I’m working week nights at club Asiatique..in San Pedro..

657
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,660
love and peace, Jade

658
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,700
P.S beware The Golden Fang.

659
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,960
I can’t stay out here long this is golden fang territory..

660
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,940
and a girl don’t necessarily want to 
get into difficulties with those folks..

661
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,940
What is it? A band ?

662
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,460
You wish

663
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,460
I just wanted to say how sorry I was..

664
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,460
 I felt shitty about what I did..

665
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,880
Which is what again ?

666
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,120
I’m not a snitch..

667
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,420
The cops said they’d drop charges if we just put you..

668
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,620
in the scene which they already new you were..

669
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,120
so where’s the harm..I’m like so sorry Larry

670
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,120
Call me Doc, that’s cool Jade.

671
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,120
-That copper?     
-BigFoot?

672
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,120
He’s a warped sheet of plastic.

673
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,160
So ah..was it BigFoot who put me on 
the buenos notches express..

674
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,360
or did he sub-contract it?

675
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,980
I missed all that man..last thing I 
remember was eating Bambi's pussy..

676
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,520
and Puck Beaverton’s tattoo..like it was pulsating.

677
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,880
Puck..what’s a Puck Beaverton ?

678
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,560
He’s a bald headed asshole with a 
swastika tattoo you don’t wanna meet.

679
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,380
Me and Bambi were so afraid with the bad ass brigade 
stomping in there, we didn’t stick around.

680
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,380
Listen, there’s somebody who want’s to talk to you, 
he thinks you can help each other out..

681
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,240
He’s a new face, I’m not sure of his name but..

682
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,560
I know he’s in some trouble.

683
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,840
I would’ve come by your office man 
but I thought there might be unfriendly eyeballs.

684
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,420
Well is this ah, safe enough for you out here?

685
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,020
Let’s light this and pretend we came out to smoke..

686
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,480
-I’m supposed to be dead 
-Well, there’s also a rumor that you’re not.

687
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,780
That don’t come as such great news.
Being dead is part of my job image..like what I do.

688
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,260
You’re working for these people here at the club?

689
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,420
I don’t know, maybe, it’s where I pickup my pay check.

690
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,500
Where are you staying?

691
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,760
House in Topanga Canyon..

692
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,260
band I used to play for, The Boards..

693
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,620
but none of them know it’s me.

694
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,620
 How come they don’t know it’s you?

695
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,260
Even when I was alive they didn’t know it’s me..

696
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,980
the sax player, the session guy..

697
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,780
plus over the years there’s 
been a big turnover in personnel..

698
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,140
but The Boards I played with..

699
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,600
most of’em gone off and formed other bands..

700
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:46,300
only one or two of the old crew left, and luckily, 
they're suffering from heavy doper’s memory.

701
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,860
The story is that you came to grief behind some bad smack..

702
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,800
you still into that?

703
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,440
No..no..

704
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,940
I’m clean these days..

705
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,580
I spent my time rehabilitating up in...

706
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,820
It’s ok, it’s ok, I can’t hear too good 
and how can I talk about what I don’t hear?

707
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,460
Look, the thing I wanted to see you about is 
I wondered if you could check on a couple of people..

708
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,180
lady and a little..little girl..

709
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,080
see if they’re ok without bringing me into it..

710
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,740
staying out in Torrance. Just see if they’re still living there..

711
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,480
see what’s in the drive way, 
law enforcement in the picture..

712
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,940
or any details you find interesting.

713
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,540
All right, I’m on it.

714
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,100
I can’t pay you right now.

715
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,940
When you can..

716
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,640
unless you’re one of those folks who 
believes information is money in which case..

717
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,640
I could ask you something.

718
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:45,940
Bearing in mind that either I don’t know..

719
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,860
or if it's my ass if I tell you..

720
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,180
what is it?

721
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,480
Ever heard of the Golden Fang ?

722
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,480
Sure, it’s a boat.

723
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,180
A boat !

724
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:02,600
Big schooner, somebody said, she brings stuff in and out 
of the country but nobody wants to talk about it.

725
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,960
Because ?

726
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,320
That was it.

727
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,840
How do you know?

728
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,580
I saw it sail in when I got here tonight.

729
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,560
I don’t know what I just saw.

730
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,560
Me neither..

731
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,540
in fact, I don’t even wanna know.

732
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:30,480
Okay, Doc figured it might’ve been easier to let Coy know..

733
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,640
that Hope and little Amethyst were doing just fine..

734
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,500
but he had a rule against getting involved in matrimonials..

735
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,920
which had just gone up in smoke..

736
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:43,600
like the Asian indica in the joint they’ve been smoking,

737
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,980
creating an extra layer of fog on top of the 
one Doc was already standing inside of.

738
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,340
Meet the schooner Golden Fang..

739
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,560
out of Charlotte Amalie.

740
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,460
-Where is that ? 
-U.S Virgin Islands

741
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,200
Bermuda Triangle ?

742
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,200
Close enough.

743
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,200
Sizable vessel!

744
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,000
She has a tendency to show up 
here in the middle of the night..

745
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,400
no running lights, no radio traffic...

746
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,920
see the problem with this vessel is 
trying to find out anything..

747
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:16,920
people back off, change the subject and get real creepy.

748
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,880
The owners are listed as a 
consortium in the Bahamas..

749
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,240
Her real name, isn’t really the Golden Fang..

750
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,520
she was originally a fishing boat named Preserved..

751
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,760
then after World War II she was 
bought by Burke Stodger..

752
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:39,180
Burke Stodger the actor? 
‘45 Caliber Kiss off’ Burke Stodger?

753
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:41,180
The movie star..

754
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,380
He..gets blacklisted because of his politics..

755
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,380
and branded a communist..

756
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,960
so he takes the boat, splits the country...

757
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,840
which is where your Bermuda Triangle comes in.

758
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,820
Hi, I’m Chlorinda, how can I help you ?

759
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:08,020
Well, I’m gonna have the..house anchovy loaf to start..

760
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,180
and, um, the devil-ray filet..

761
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,920
-can I get that deep-fried in beer batter? 
-It's your stomach.

762
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,920
What can I get for you little buddy?

763
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,160
Mmm, I’ll take the jellyfish teriyaki croquettes 
and the Eel Travatore please.

764
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,580
Ok. And to drink gentlemen? ..

765
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,680
You’re gonna want to get good 
and fucked up before this meal.

766
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,680
That’s for sure.

767
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,920
I have some recommendations, 
maybe the..Tequila Zombie?

768
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,920
-Make it two.  -Aha

769
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,740
Thank you.

770
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,740
So Burke’s black listed, takes the boat..

771
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,740
splits the country..

772
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,660
somewhere between San Pedro 
and Papetee the boat disappears..

773
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,320
disappears till one day, a couple of years later..

774
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,780
the boat and the owner suddenly reappear...

775
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,500
-You dig? 
-umhum

776
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,100
The Preserved, is in the 
opposite ocean off of Cuba..

777
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:59,000
and Burke Stodger, on 
the front page of the Daily Variety

778
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,700
in an article reporting his return to pictures...

779
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,340
in a major motion picture called: 
Commie Confidential

780
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,180
Ooooh. Soo Burke is working again!

781
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,100
And his politics have miraculously changed.

782
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,840
And the ship?

783
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:19,640
Man..they removed any 
traces of soul she once had,

784
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:21,800
it’s a horror story.

785
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,160
Are you emotionally involved? 
With the boat?

786
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,720
She’s not just a boat Doc..

787
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,580
she’s much more than that.

788
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,440
What..?

789
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,240
I know why I’m so interested..

790
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,060
but why are you?

791
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:43,080
That story I heard the other night, 
something about a smuggling angle.

792
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,820
And that story you heard..

793
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,200
did it happen to include Mickey Wolfmann?

794
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,200
Not so far....why?

795
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,000
Well, according to scuttlebutt, 
shortly before he disappeared..

796
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,240
Mickey Wolfmann was seen 
taking the Golden Fang out for..

797
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,040
a three hour tour, or should I say 
a three hour tour.

798
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,460
And ah, was he accompanied 
by his lovely companion?

799
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,900
Ok!

800
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:14,140
-My fucking Ex, old Shasta Fay! 
-I know..I know who she is...

801
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,700
But Doc I thought you were done 
with all that sad bullshit.

802
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,000
Listen, did everybody make it back ok?

803
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Nobody was pushed overboard, 
nothing like that?

804
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,280
Actually the word I’m hearing is that Mickey Wolfmann 
might not be as missing as we think.

805
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,480
Like gone but not gone.

806
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,220
Man...you’re gonna love this..

807
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:38,180
-The rumor is that the department of justice is trying..
-A..a..a..a

808
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,380
-Here you go 
-Thank you.

809
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:48,700
The word I’m hearing is that the department of 
justice is trying to broker a Vegas deal for him.

810
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,920
Doesn’t compute. Say again. Vegas...Wolfmann!

811
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,920
FBI stuff..

812
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,900
they need somebody else on 
the strip, who’s not Italian.

813
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:03,080
You dig? Like Howard Hughes 
when he bought the..Desert Inn.

814
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,400
Howard Hughes was Italian?

815
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,500
No...they want white people..

816
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,500
they want white, Anglo owners on the strip..

817
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,280
Who better than Mickey Wolfmann?

818
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,580
Hello.

819
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,840
All right Doc, so she just departed San Pedro 
on board The Golden Fang.

820
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,220
-Who? 
-Your ex, Shasta Fay.

821
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,220
Shasta is on the...on the Golden Fang?

822
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,200
My friend at DoJ just called me...yeah.

823
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,980
Ah, where...where is it going?

824
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,980
Out at sea someplace.

825
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,560
Huh..?

826
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,900
Out at sea someplace

827
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,240
Yeah! Where!

828
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,180
Not known..not known.

829
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:01,200
-Hang tight, I’m gonna get back to you 
-All right...call, call me...

830
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,740
Penny Kimball, deputy D.A

831
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,380
Hey.

832
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,700
Who is this?

833
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,700
It’s me.

834
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,900
Where did you get this number?

835
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,900
It’s Doc!!

836
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:04,080
Oh...I thought you'd never wanna speak to me again.

837
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,820
Ha..I didn’t..ah..

838
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:09,540
I didn't mind talking to the FBI

839
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,540
Am I in trouble?

840
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,720
I don’t know are you?

841
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:22,520
It’s an awful nice night out here at the beach

842
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,820
But you’re a dirty filthy hippie..

843
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,960
what would a nice clean girl 
like me do with you?

844
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,820
Um..you could ah..

845
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:37,600
bring your soap and clean my feet..

846
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,740
Ewe...no thank you..

847
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,800
But then again I could bring you a pizza..

848
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,740
I can hear your pants growing.

849
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,700
So..!

850
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,440
I’ll be there in an hour...go wash your feet.

851
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,620
The dumb..

852
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,120
hugging on the dumb.

853
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:16,420
That’s the best thing I’ve heard all day.

854
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,860
No....what the fuck!!

855
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,460
What, who ?

856
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:49,220
That’s no hippie..that’s Chucky.

857
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,820
I..yeah? He’s ah..friend of yours?

858
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,040
Everybody know Chucky..

859
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,320
If he’s not at the Hall of Justice, 
he's down at the Glass House.

860
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,320
A...a snitch?

861
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,320
Informant, please...

862
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,580
He only works with the Red Squad.

863
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:14,120
Wow..so what’ he ah, why is he screaming 
and yelling like that at Nixon again?

864
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:19,220
Now he’s been on TV he has 
instant and wide credibility..

865
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:23,380
Police can infiltrate him into any group they want to.

866
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,900
Bastards!

867
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,560
Do you love me?

868
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:39,200
Hmm..a snitch, a spy, a weasel..

869
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,900
and damn..If it ain’t a resurrected sax tenor player..

870
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:47,060
working under cover...but for who?

871
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:52,640
These patriotic pals of President Nixon 
called Vigilant California?

872
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,620
Some other unseen hand?

873
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,400
-Now, who am I again? 
-You’re the photographer.

874
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:02,840
-And the name of the magazine is..
-Stone Turntable.

875
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:07,920
Coy’s band, The Boards, were currently 
renting a place in Topanga Canyon..

876
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,760
from a Bass player turned record company executive..

877
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,920
which trend watchers took as further 
evidence of the end of Hollywood...

878
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,260
if not the world as they have known it...

879
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:22,620
Doc and Denis hadn’t dropped acid 
for years in this town without..

880
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:26,860
picking up some kind of extra-sensory chops..

881
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,180
and truth was..

882
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,660
since crossing the door sill of this place..

883
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:35,140
they couldn’t help noticing what 
you would call..an atmosphere.

884
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,660
Oh...what are you playin'?!

885
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,740
I drove up with Bambi..

886
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:51,080
She heard Spotted Dick were staying here, 
so I had to come over and keep her out of trouble?

887
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,000
She’s possessed. She’s got Spotted Dick 
black-light posters on the walls..

888
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Spotted Dick sheets and pillow cases on the beds..

889
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,680
-Spotted Dick T-shirts..
-Ah..she's team dick!

890
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:03,480
for 24 hours a day she’s got 
Spotted Dick albums on stereo man.

891
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,640
Listen, I’m looking for that guy I met at
Club Asiatique the other night?

892
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,640
-He’s here  
-Yeah...where?

893
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,640
-He’s in the kitchen. 
-The kitchen?

894
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,300
Hey, when you leave, can I get a ride with you?

895
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,300
This place is freaking me out.

896
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,300
Mmm...ok

897
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:27,000
Good Evening, Larry Sportello, 
Stone Turntable magazine?

898
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,040
Split Lits, Spotted Dick, keyboards.

899
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,500
Was it possible that at every gathering..

900
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,960
concert..peace rally..love-in..be-in and freak-in..

901
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,420
here..up north..back east..where ever..

902
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,600
some dark crews had been busy all along...

903
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,420
reclaiming the music..

904
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:53,120
the resistance to power..
the sexual desire from epic to everyday?

905
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:58,460
All they could sweep up for the 
ancient forces of greed and fear.

906
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:02,400
gee, he thought..I don’t know.

907
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,560
-Hey 
-Hi..

908
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,340
Look it there..remember me?

909
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,620
Larry Sportello, StoneTurntable magazine?

910
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:21,940
You ah, asked me to look into that uhm..

911
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,060
vehicle.

912
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,460
-What? 
-A...the vehicle?

913
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,980
Yeah..what was the..make and model 
that you looked at again?

914
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:36,580
You were asking about that older type..
VW with the hearts and bluebirds...

915
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,180
Any..any replacement parts?

916
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:40,600
None I could see.

917
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,980
You didn’t see any replacement..
what about street legal?

918
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,140
was there any hassles with registration?

919
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,140
No, I didn’t see anything.

920
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,840
You saw Hope?

921
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,160
For a minute..she’s ok..

922
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,520
 looks like she’s been staying clean too.

923
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,960
How did she do it?

924
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,080
I don’t know she’s ah..
back teaching is all she said

925
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,080
Where?

926
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:08,040
Where? I don’t know, she didn’t say.

927
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,520
It didn't matter..

928
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,420
no way I could go ever back to them.

929
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:20,700
All right man look, you can’t go back to 
them...cause what? Why?

930
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,160
Because it would be my ass and my family’s too..

931
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,260
It’s like a gang, it’s like once you’re in you’re in for life.

932
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,260
Did you know that when you signed up?

933
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:34,060
All I knew is we couldn’t do each other 
any good staying together..

934
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,080
the baby looked like shit, getting worse every day..

935
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,140
 we were just getting fucked up and sitting there..

936
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:45,960
saying we gotta do something..
we’re dragging ourselves down.

937
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:50,180
Listen, I’m not asking you to give 
away any secrets here..

938
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:54,160
but I think I saw you on the tube at a rally for Nixon.

939
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,920
And your question is which side am I on ?

940
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,920
Yes.

941
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,840
Well..

942
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,380
 you know, these people here have money..

943
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:09,980
It’s not like those bible freaks that go up and 
down the beach like screaming at you..

944
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,980
they really wanna help..

945
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:16,280
I thought it was something good to do for my country.

946
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,280
As stupid as that sounds..

947
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:25,220
but what I really found out was they just wanna 
like use us and keep the membership in line..

948
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:30,860
my country, right or wrong, with Vietnam 
going on is just fucking crazy..

949
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,100
Suppose your mom was on smack..

950
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,100
My mom?

951
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,100
Yeah, what would you do?

952
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:47,020
-Wouldn’t you try to help her? 
-Yeah...I think..

953
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:51,040
Are you saying that the U.S is somebody’s mom?

954
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,300
And she’s ah..strung out?

955
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,080
On what?

956
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:01,040
Sending people off to die in jungles for no reason..

957
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:06,080
something wrong and suicidal 
about that that she can’t stop.

958
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:11,840
And..Vigilant California, or whoever it is 
you’re working for wouldn’t buy that?

959
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,660
I don’t belong here man.

960
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,340
I do get the feeling you’d rather 
be someplace else.

961
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,860
Yeah..back where I was would be nice

962
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,680
Listen, I did just run a fast check..

963
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,440
we gotta find some angle that 
maybe you haven’t thought of

964
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:37,400
Listen, nothing personal, but there’s 
too much you...haven’t thought of.

965
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,540
Oh, I can dig you’re trying to chase me off of this..

966
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:45,440
but whatever it is you’re caught inside, 
I’m out here, on the outside of it..

967
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,680
I can move in ways you may not be able to.

968
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,320
Shhh..how did the baby look? Amethyst?

969
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,100
Oh man, sweetie pie.

970
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,620
-She looked good? 
-Yeah

971
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,980
No sign of them little-kid blues?

972
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,320
Little-kid blues?

973
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,320
You know that happens, they get that.

974
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,840
No..no..I could see it.

975
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,100
You saw it a little bit, I blew this solo man..

976
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,500
Where does it come from?

977
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,900
Give me a glimpse here man, 
who set you up with these people?

978
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:18,260
You know when I first started snitching, I realized how often 
people ask questions they already know the answers to..

979
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,680
They just wanna hear it from another voice..

980
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,260
 like one outside their head..

981
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,980
You better find Shasta Fay.

982
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,340
Huh?

983
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,000
Shasta Fay.

984
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,780
Thanks for the lift boys

985
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:13,420
Ahh..Jade, Jade..

986
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:19,900
you said in your note to beware of the Golden Fang..
why am I supposed to beware of a boat?

987
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,880
They’re an IndoChinese Heroin cartel..

988
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:34,080
A vertical package, they grow it, bring it in, step on it..

989
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:39,920
run state side networks of local street dealers and 
take a separate percentage off of each operation.

990
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,920
So...your dealing smack?

991
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:47,860
No..but they use Chick Planet 
as a front to launder money.

992
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,780
See you around.

993
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:56,880
Reluctant, may be even a little desperate..

994
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,960
Doc figured he had to go visit BigFoot now..

995
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:05,600
On principle, he tried to spend as little time 
around the glass house as possible..

996
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:10,460
all this strange alternate cop history and cop politics..

997
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:14,460
cop dynasties, cop heroes and evil doers..

998
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,000
 saintly cops and psycho cops..

999
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,660
cops too stupid to live and cops 
too smart for their own good...

1000
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:29,720
insulated by secret loyalties and codes of silence 
from the world they’d all been given the control..

1001
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,920
BigFoot’s native element..

1002
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:39,600
the air he breathed, the big time he’d been so crazy to 
get away from the beach and be promoted into..

1003
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,840
then why so grumpy, BigFoot?

1004
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:47,740
Doc remembered, dimly, a story from long past..

1005
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:54,080
a rumor about a partner of BigFoot's who’s been 
shot and killed a while back in the line of duty..

1006
01:06:54,080 --> 01:07:00,040
and ever since then, the story went, 
BigFoot had worked alone.

1007
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:07,120
I hope this won’t be another one of those unabridged, paranoid, 
hippie monologues you seem obliged to sit through.

1008
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,960
So what if someone dies but is resurrected?

1009
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,660
Not at first glance a matter for Homicide.

1010
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,520
So who around here handles resurrections?

1011
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,520
Bunkus Squad, usually.

1012
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,760
Does that mean the L.A PD believes that every 
return from the dead is some kinda con?

1013
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,580
Look, you’re you’re dead..we we’re talking philosophy?

1014
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,080
That there is Coy Harlingen, 
the stiff in question?

1015
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:37,480
that was taken last night.

1016
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,640
Remind me why I give a shit again?

1017
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,940
Mmm..he worked for the department as a snitch..

1018
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:51,120
 not the mention for some patriotic bad asses 
known as Vigilant California?

1019
01:07:53,940 --> 01:08:00,080
who knows, they may or may not’ve been on the raid at 
Channel View Estates..you remember that raid BigFoot ?

1020
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,960
All right..

1021
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,300
all right I’ll look into it personally..

1022
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,860
sometimes it’s just about doing the right thing.

1023
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,340
Who...are you?

1024
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,820
Clancy Sharlock

1025
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:48,420
Glenn...Sharlock’s..sister..

1026
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,420
Sister

1027
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:52,840
Sister..hehe

1028
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,240
I’m..so sorry about your uhm..brother

1029
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:02,780
Glenn was a shit, bound to have his 
series cancelled sometime..

1030
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:06,220
that don’t keep me from wanting to know who his killer is.

1031
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,920
Did you talk to the police?

1032
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,180
They talked to me. Some smart ass named BigFoot..

1033
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:17,580
he seemed less concerned with Glenn’s murder 
than Mickey Wolfmann’s disappearance..

1034
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:20,000
but he’s a fan of yours all right..

1035
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
he said you might be able to help?

1036
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,420
Did he now?

1037
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,600
Did you hear that Wolfmann is working 
on a way to give away all his money?

1038
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,860
Why does he wanna do that ?

1039
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,100
He was on a guilt trip man..

1040
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,320
doing tons of acid and peyote..and..

1041
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,320
just got to a point..

1042
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:42,040
he felt bad about making people pay for 
all those cheap ugly houses of his..

1043
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,580
You gonna keep holding to that thing 
or are you gonna marry it?

1044
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,540
He wanted to build this big place out in the desert 
where people could come and live for free..

1045
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,820
called Arrepentimiento

1046
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:02,080
Arrpent...what’s that mean again?

1047
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,280
It’s Spanish for ‘Sorry About That’

1048
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:30,740
Do you think that maybe your brother was just..
you know, doing his job trying to prevent ah..

1049
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,560
you know, who ever it was who was putting the snatch on Mickey?

1050
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:36,000
That’s way too fuckin’ sentimental.

1051
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,660
Sounds like somebody objected to Mickey’s big give away!

1052
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,480
The..wife?..business partners?

1053
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,360
Puck Beaverton..

1054
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,720
he had the duty that day to guard Mickey..

1055
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:54,460
changed shift with Glenn at the last minute.

1056
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,640
Puck Beaverton....interesting fellow I hear.

1057
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,460
He’s a major league ass hole.

1058
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,880
-Mmm..so you dated! 
-Him, and his roommate.

1059
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,480
Two at a time?

1060
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,780
That’s my preference.

1061
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:09,020
Well ah...

1062
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,720
You know were I might be able this..Puck fellow?

1063
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,380
Dropped out of sight after Glenn’s murder..

1064
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,380
set sail.

1065
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,320
Set sail? like on a boat?

1066
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,320
I don’t know, maybe.

1067
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,100
If you find him, you’ll let me know?

1068
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:37,020
Well ah..perhaps we should continue this 
conversacion somewhere else

1069
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,680
I’ve got a date.

1070
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:58,000
Oh, and miss Charlock, I just need 
a contact information from you

1071
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,420
Hey Clancy..

1072
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,900
did ah..Glenn ever mention one of Mickey’s ladies..?

1073
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,900
a girl by the name of Shasta?

1074
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,460
-The girl that’s gone missing? 
-That's her.

1075
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:14,000
Yeah, she was in love with him...deeply in love.

1076
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,380
Oh, Shasta and Doc lived together for a short while.

1077
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:21,300
Oh....bummer.

1078
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,960
Well, ask someone who’s been down 
this particular exit ramp..

1079
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:28,800
you can only cruise the boulevards 
of regret so far..

1080
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,260
then you gotta get back up on the freeway again.

1081
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,200
Hmm..

1082
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,200
Good luck

1083
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,000
-See ya 
-Bye now.

1084
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,760
I wish you could see these waves..

1085
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:08,620
it’s one more of these places a voice from 
somewhere else tells you you have to be..

1086
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,500
Remember that day with the ouija board?

1087
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:22,120
I miss those days...and I miss you..

1088
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,860
nothing was supposed to happen this way Doc..

1089
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,040
I’m so sorry.

1090
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:37,900
You don’t remember the ouija board, 
do you Doc?

1091
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:42,360
It has been one of those prolonged times with no dope.

1092
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,320
You think it knows where we can score?

1093
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:52,160
Ask....just do it by your self like that.

1094
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:58,560
Nobody had any...everybody was desperate 
and suffering lapses of judgment.

1095
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,560
3..4..2..9..

1096
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,560
It’s a phone number!

1097
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,580
It’s ringing.

1098
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,860
Howdy dopers, we’ve got what ever you need..

1099
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:16,300
and remember, the sooner you get 
over here the more there will left for you..

1100
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:20,500
so come on down to 72723 
Sunset Boulevard..you better hurry.

1101
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,700
Sorry..Ok..who is this I’m talking to..? 
she hung up.

1102
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:28,820
She’s screaming at you: 
stay away..I’m a police trap.

1103
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:32,520
Ah that’s the problem with ouija boards.

1104
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,680
That board sure did it’s work..

1105
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,820
they didn’t score any dope that day but..

1106
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:11,440
somehow suddenly it didn’t matter..

1107
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,740
it was weird that in the limited space of a post card..

1108
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:20,360
Shasta should’ve chosen to 
remember that one day in the rain..

1109
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,640
it had stuck with Doc too..

1110
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,700
even though it was late in their time together..

1111
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:29,520
when she was already half way out the door.

1112
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,080
Hey Denis..

1113
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,480
Denis I’m gonna go look around, you wanna wait 
in the car or come in to cover my back?

1114
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:08,240
I was gonna go try to find a pizza..is that ok?

1115
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,340
All right, now you recall this is stick-shift, 
not automatic and so forth?

1116
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:13,340
It’s easy as pie Doc.

1117
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:27,160
After noon..

1118
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:31,620
this is the address that gave me 
at Club Asiatique, in San Pedro..?

1119
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,760
just here to pick up a package for management.

1120
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:43,540
Hello, this is Sandra from front desk, 
we have a pick up for management

1121
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,620
Follow me.

1122
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:03,220
Dr. Blatnoyd will see you in a moment.

1123
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:28,360
So you have some I.D, I imagine.

1124
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,960
I don’t know what this is...What is it?

1125
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,180
It’s Oriental or something.....is it Chinese?

1126
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:50,460
I figured..ah....you being Chinese.

1127
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,380
What? what are you talking about?

1128
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:58,480
The.....Golden..Fang?

1129
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:01,440
It’s a syndicate..

1130
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,340
Most of us happen to be dentists..

1131
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:09,660
a syndicate of dentists, set up 
long ago for tax purposes..

1132
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:11,180
all legit.

1133
01:19:16,180 --> 01:19:20,780
Where did....you tell Sandra you’re from again?

1134
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,060
Oooh..

1135
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,300
why you’re another one of those 
hippie dope fiends aren’t you!

1136
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,860
My goodness, my goodness me..

1137
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:37,480
You’re here of a little perking-up aren’t we?..

1138
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,480
It’s from Darmstadt..lab quality

1139
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,920
Mmm..I try not to do any dope 
I can’t pay for, that’s what it is

1140
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:49,840
No, no..on the house..

1141
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:54,860
in fact maybe I can even join ya for 
one.. one little moment..

1142
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,060
Ah..just to be sociable..

1143
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:10,100
Doctor, I think there’s a problem with 
the couch in your office,

1144
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,100
and bring that bottle.

1145
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,740
What do you think of my chompers?

1146
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:57,040
Heroin sucks the calcium out 
of your body like a vampire..

1147
01:20:57,220 --> 01:21:02,540
you could use it for any length of time, 
your teeth will go to hell..

1148
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,820
and that’s just the good part.

1149
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,880
Doc..

1150
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,880
Doc..

1151
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,360
Dr. Rudy, I’m back!

1152
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,880
You’re not Dr. Rudy!

1153
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:26,360
You’re not Dr. Rudy!

1154
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,620
That’s that Japoica, aint’t?

1155
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,260
Japonica Fenway?

1156
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,620
Imagine meeting you here!

1157
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:39,180
Doc rooted through the city dump 
that was his memory..

1158
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:44,160
recalling that Japonica here had been a pretty 
open and shut run away daughter case..

1159
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,660
hardly worth daily scale..

1160
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:49,240
let alone the extravagant bonus 
her father..Crocker Fenway..

1161
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:54,840
had insisted on paying when Doc finally 
brought Japonica back home.

1162
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:56,660
So what’ve you been up to?

1163
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,400
Escaping mostly..

1164
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:01,320
and I escape real good.

1165
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,160
Escaping what?

1166
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:08,300
Chryskylodon, this like..booby hatch 
my parents keep sending me too.

1167
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:12,140
-Booby hatch?..up in Ojai? 
-You know it?

1168
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,480
Shakes a tambourine.

1169
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:18,460
Ah....Dr. Rudy

1170
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:20,040
Ok..all right.

1171
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:22,560
Japonica you promised me..

1172
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,560
did you not promise me?

1173
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:27,180
-What are you doing here? 
-I escaped again..for you.

1174
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:33,960
Look at the greedy little hippie..snorting away are ya?

1175
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,700
-Your parents know you’re here? 
-No

1176
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:39,080
The Fenways, they were heavy duty 
South Bay money..

1177
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:43,360
 and led lives of unusually high 
density and often incoherence..

1178
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,440
her father Crocker, also known as 
the dark prince of Palace Fairdays,

1179
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:50,420
was a lead lawyer at the office Forheath Kruger..

1180
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:54,240
who had given Doc his first paying gig as a P.I

1181
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,740
Man, like, I’m sorry

1182
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:59,240
Denis..what is...that’s my steering wheel?

1183
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,600
I don’t know how to drive.

1184
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,340
Ahh man I though you said you..

1185
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:03,640
Hey..

1186
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:07,340
smile maintenance chick..how lovely!

1187
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:10,440
Miss Fenway may appear a little psychotic today.

1188
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,700
Groovy!

1189
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:12,880
What?

1190
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,060
It’s groovy being insane man...where you at?

1191
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:18,400
It’s not groovy to be insane..

1192
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,060
Japonica here has been institutionalized for it.

1193
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:24,480
OK, come now Denis, we gotta 
figure a way back to the beach.

1194
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,960
Hey if you need a ride I’m heading that way.

1195
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,420
Huh, ah..cop friendly? everything cool 
with your ride Japonica?

1196
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:32,700
-break lights, license plate’n so forth? 
-Yeah

1197
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:33,880
A OK.

1198
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,940
Mind if I tag along with you guys? 
contingencies of the road and so forth?

1199
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:41,560
Yeah yeah, that’s a good idea maybe we can 
just do a bit more of that...for the road?

1200
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,720
Yes...you want some?

1201
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,940
What’s in that bag you’re stuffing under Doc’s seat?

1202
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,940
Pay no attention to that bag,..

1203
01:23:56,940 --> 01:23:59,260
you’re gonna make everybody paranoid.

1204
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:05,720
Though he may have rescued Japonica from a life of dark and unspecified hippie horror..

1205
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:09,540
apparently restoration to the bosom 
of her family had been enough..

1206
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:12,180
to really drive her around the bend.

1207
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,060
Oh Fuck..fuck it!

1208
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:17,420
Shh..easy easy

1209
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:23,220
Fuck! fuck! fuck..I can’t...OK 
we are so fucked..I got so many..

1210
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:30,120
-Are you the Great Beast? 
-No, no, that's uhm..policeman!

1211
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:32,320
You know you’re driving without 
your headlights ma’m?

1212
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,320
But I..I can see in the dark.

1213
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,320
Perhaps you shouldn’t be driving then..

1214
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,320
I’m gonna need to see all of you IDs please?

1215
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,640
And what is this all about sir?

1216
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:43,060
Any gathering of three or more civilians i
s now considered a possible cult.

1217
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:45,560
What? It’s Charlie Manson again?

1218
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,440
Criteria..criteria includes reference to the book of revelation..

1219
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,440
males with shoulder-length hair or longer..

1220
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:54,660
 and endangerment through inattentive driving..

1221
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,300
all of which, all of you have been exhibiting.

1222
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,560
Oh, I don’t think so!

1223
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:02,380
Man, listen, this is a Mercedes..it’s only painted one color.

1224
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:03,340
You all hang tight.

1225
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,680
-That should count for something...
-Good point!

1226
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:15,700
Ah..I actually gonna have a heart attack, actually my heart is racing like a little boom boom

1227
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:17,700
Yes, sir

1228
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:22,400
I’m gonna hand these in Mr. Sportello and as long as there isn’t any wants or warrants I don’t know about..

1229
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:23,980
I don’t wanna hear any more about this.

1230
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:25,640
Thank you officer, you have a good night.

1231
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,860
Thank you sir, drive safely.

1232
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,120
Idiots Unlimited?

1233
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,900
Oh yeah, I’m in an evil mood myself tonight..

1234
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:02,860
Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd, D.D.S...

1235
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:07,440
has perpetrated his last root canal, I’m afraid.

1236
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:10,560
Habla ingles man..what’s that..he’s dead?

1237
01:26:10,660 --> 01:26:15,380
We found him next to a trampoline in Bel Air, 
with a fatal neck injury..

1238
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:19,680
so far no witnesses, no motives, no suspects..

1239
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,680
apart from you.

1240
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,920
Um..not me..why me?

1241
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,200
You were observed in Blatnoyd’s company,

1242
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:30,640
both of you were riding in a vehicle 
full of drug crazed hippies

1243
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,640
Yeah, well, you know..

1244
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,640
 the owner of that vehicle..

1245
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:39,800
is a very well respected lawyer down at Palos Verdes..

1246
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,700
and his daughter was driving..she offered me a ride..

1247
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,420
and um..you know the cops didn’t even give her a ticket!

1248
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:47,840
and you know Blatnoyd was her friend not mine.

1249
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,560
Go to bed.

1250
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,240
I’m working, why do you want me to go to bed?

1251
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,580
I think it’s time we had one of our chats.

1252
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,120
So on this Coy Harlingen matter..

1253
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,100
on the face of it..

1254
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:15,100
just one more O.D, one last junkie, case cleared.

1255
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,100
And on the not face of it?

1256
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:21,340
Why, what do we have here..

1257
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:26,120
why don’t you pick a card, any card..

1258
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,220
these are field interrogation reports..

1259
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:31,500
see if you find anything that looks familiar.

1260
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:33,500
Card tricks

1261
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,700
Puck Beaverton!

1262
01:27:40,700 --> 01:27:44,580
Excellent choice..one of 
Mickey Wolfmann’s bodyguards.

1263
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,500
Interesting fellow I here.

1264
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:49,540
Sherif’s people happen to run into him at the Venice home of the very dealer

1265
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,420
that sold Coy Harlingen the smack that killed him..or..didn't kill him

1266
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:56,340
What..what was Puck doing in Coy’s dealer’s place?

1267
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,780
The interesting thing..

1268
01:27:58,780 --> 01:27:59,980
about this over dose..

1269
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:03,440
is that Leonard James Loose-meat, aka El Drano..

1270
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:05,780
was know for the street percent product..

1271
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:09,620
yet the report says what killed him was 
pure China white number four

1272
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,980
You mean like from the whole seller, 
like who ever is bringing it in?

1273
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:15,180
I seem to recall some years ago..

1274
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:17,060
jus before I went into Folsome..

1275
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:20,120
 Beaverton..used to work for this loan shark..

1276
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,900
Adrian Prussia.

1277
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,840
Fucking zoiks, I know Adrian Prussia..!

1278
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:29,900
yeah I know him from my skip-tracing 
days..he’s a bad man..

1279
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,900
with a baseball bat...sick.

1280
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:38,400
And Coy’s dealer, El Drano, also happens to be..Prussia’s steady customer..

1281
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:42,780
so maybe Puck was there in Adrian’s behalf..

1282
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:45,560
what do you think?

1283
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:52,800
I think you and Adrian have a history 
you’re not sharing with me.

1284
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:09,700
Pancakes aren’t quite as good as my mother’s..

1285
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:14,120
 but what I really go for here is the respect...respect.

1286
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,900
You didn’t get enough of that from your mom.

1287
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:23,440
You probably imagine, that I have a 
lot of status up in robbery-homicide..

1288
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,380
I mean who can blame you for thinking that..

1289
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,640
the reality, however..

1290
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,260
no Cielo Drive for BigFoot..

1291
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:40,080
no TV movie rights or book deals for BigFoot..

1292
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,100
I mean even the extra work is drying out..

1293
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:50,540
God help us all..

1294
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,300
dentists on trampolines..

1295
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:58,380
Your Dr. Blatnoyd, had puncture wounds on his throat.

1296
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:01,720
consistent with bites from canines of 
a mid-sized wild animal..

1297
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:05,380
that’s what the coroner told me..swallow that.

1298
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,240
Listen, that’s, that’s mighty weird BigFoot..

1299
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:14,900
Ok? because Blatnoyd was a partner in a tax dodge called itself The Golden Fang Enterprises..

1300
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:18,900
now you didn’t happen to get the SID to test those neck punctures for gold or nothing?

1301
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,160
I..shouldn’t think there’d be much trace..

1302
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,280
gold is all but chemically inactive..

1303
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,740
as you might’ve learned in chemistry class..

1304
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:29,900
if you hadn’t been ditching all the time 
to score dope...Sportello.

1305
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:31,900
Every contact leaves traces..

1306
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,780
it would sure be ironic man, that’s all I’m saying..

1307
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:37,640
 if it turns out that Blatnoyd was bit to death by a golden fang..

1308
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,400
or better yet, like even better, like two golden fangs!

1309
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,900
I don’t see why any of this would be material.

1310
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,660
Cause it’s the fuckin Golden Fang.

1311
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:47,000
If it’s the decedent’s tax shelter, so what?

1312
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,700
No, man, it’s not a tax shelter, it’s something...

1313
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:53,820
BigFoot man, much more..more vast.

1314
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:58,860
This wouldn’t be just more of your 
paranoid hippie bullshit would it?

1315
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,960
Look, have the lab check for traces of copper..

1316
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,760
not the kind that goes stumbling all over a crime scene contaminating  evidence..

1317
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,040
we want Copper the metal, you see..

1318
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,580
gold teeth are never made with pure gold..dentists like to alloy it with Copper..

1319
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:14,640
now if you hadn’t ditched forensics class 
to go steal hubcaps..

1320
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,320
to plant on some innocent hippie,..

1321
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,600
you might’ve known that!

1322
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:23,200
Oh, you feel like a cop almost, don’t you!

1323
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:28,520
Good Day.

1324
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:43,200
So where to?

1325
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:46,920
A place up in Ojai called Chryskylodon?

1326
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:50,680
Chryskylodon...animal tooth.

1327
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:55,220
Mmm..ancient Indian word, Sortilege, 
means serenity.

1328
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,540
I'm a nerd in the classics! it’s not Indian, 
it’s ancient Greek..

1329
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:02,900
it means animal tooth made out of gold.

1330
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:10,420
You’re doing good Doc.

1331
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,000
Thanks Lege.

1332
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:22,420
Owing to governor Reagan’s shut down of most of the State’s mental facilities..

1333
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:26,940
the private sector has been given 
cart blanche to pick up the slack..

1334
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:31,440
soon,in fact, becoming a standard 
California child rearing resource..

1335
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:34,440
for kids like that old Japonica Fenway.

1336
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:35,940
Mr. Sportello.

1337
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:37,940
-Dr. Albrie Threeply.

1338
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:38,960
-Oh, how do you do?

1339
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,960
-So good to see you sir  
-Good to see you.

1340
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:42,960
Welcome, welcome.

1341
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,580
Would you uhm, sorry, would you like to use the facilities?

1342
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,480
You already used the bathroom?

1343
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,480
Hit the bathroom before you take 
a tour of the facilities?

1344
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,480
This is my colleague Dr. Lily Hammer.

1345
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:54,480
-How do you do?  
-Mr. Sportello

1346
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:56,480
Please join us.

1347
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,520
This is our administrative lounge..

1348
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:04,240
our Chenin Blanc comes from the institutes own vineyard..

1349
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,260
hands steady as rock today I see, Kimberly.

1350
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:10,760
So happy you noticed Dr. Threeply.

1351
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:13,300
-More soup Dr. Hemard  
-Yes, if you know what’s good for you.

1352
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:15,300
Have you been with us before Mr. Sportello?

1353
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:17,300
I know I’ve seen your face.

1354
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,300
Hmm..first time I’ve been down here..

1355
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:21,300
normally I don’t get much south of south city

1356
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,300
And..abnormally?

1357
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,580
What?

1358
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:29,780
Well I only meant that with any number of qualified facilities in the Bay Area..

1359
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:32,580
Why would you bother coming 
all the way down here to us?

1360
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:39,080
Mmm..my clients believe that Ojai 
is a planetary chakra?

1361
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:50,600
Ah, Chryskylodon’s motion picture palace..

1362
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:55,060
now showing the Burke Stodger marathon, 
all Burke, all day,

1363
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:57,060
24 hours of Stodger.

1364
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,040
This is particularly popular with the patients.

1365
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:14,000
‘This..this was not invented by a Russian, the man’s name was Bell, Alexander Graham Bell..’

1366
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:18,180
‘and he was an American..
get that comrade.’

1367
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:21,000
‘Everything on this table is as phony as the town..’

1368
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,620
‘the rotten system you call communism.’

1369
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:31,960
It was occurring to Doc now something Jade said once about vertical integration..

1370
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:36,340
that if The Golden Fang could get it’s 
customers strung out..

1371
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:39,620
 why not turn around and sell 
them a program to help kick?

1372
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:43,320
get them coming and going..twice as much revenue..

1373
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:47,380
as long as American life was something 
to be escaped from..

1374
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:52,240
the cartel could always be sure of a 
bottomless pool of new customers.

1375
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,280
Any questions?

1376
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:30,940
Is that a swastika on that man’t face?

1377
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:33,220
Uhm...no it isn’t it.

1378
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:37,700
That’s an ancient Hindu symbol, meaning all is well..

1379
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:41,180
it brings good fortune, luck, and well being.

1380
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:44,940
What do you mean?

1381
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:48,180
I mean it looks like a swastika to me.

1382
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:51,720
Well, he isn’t a regular employee of the Institute..

1383
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,680
perhaps you should pay no attention to that man.

1384
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:15,300
Encapsulated in the charming phrase -Japanese-

1385
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:17,540
which means, of course, ‘you must be very tired’..

1386
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:20,680
which brings us to the Institute’s own zen garden..

1387
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,540
 imported from Kyoto..

1388
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:24,540
but each textured pebble, each..

1389
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:26,540
grain of white sand..

1390
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:29,580
was transported and reassembled here exactly in place..

1391
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:32,960
by a team of some of our more obsessive patients..

1392
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,820
Oh...Mickey

1393
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:27,260
Mickey..

1394
01:37:28,220 --> 01:37:29,260
Mickey..!

1395
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,600
Hello little hippie..

1396
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,180
how are you?

1397
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:48,020
Ah..what are you doing here?

1398
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:52,780
They are helping me..

1399
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:57,860
they’re helping me wake up 
from my bad hippie dream.

1400
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,200
What did you dream about?

1401
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:10,780
I dreamed..I gave away all my money..

1402
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:12,780
yeah

1403
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:18,820
Who..who brought you here?

1404
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,740
My friends.

1405
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:29,300
Who are your friends? The FBI?

1406
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:35,000
I spent my whole life...

1407
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:40,460
I spent my whole life making people pay for shelter.

1408
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,800
And all along..I didn’t realize...

1409
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:51,640
I didn’t realize it was supposed to be for free..

1410
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:53,640
for free.

1411
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:59,820
Where’s Shasta?

1412
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:10,840
Tell me, did she come with you?

1413
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,300
Is she here?

1414
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,820
Mickey, where the fuck is Shasta?

1415
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:22,260
Go away little hippie..

1416
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,420
go away.

1417
01:39:29,300 --> 01:39:31,300
New casino..

1418
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:34,600
hotel, 25000 square feet..

1419
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,280
9 dining places..

1420
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,440
We don’t have much to go on..
just a broadcast Baret put out..

1421
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:22,660
he was ambushed by two male negroes..

1422
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:23,560
possibly on foot..

1423
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:26,660
he thinks he wounded both 
of them, but we can’t be sure..

1424
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:28,880
as far as I know we have two units code 100..

1425
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:29,960
one on Manchester..

1426
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,400
Oh, BigFoot...you’re adorable.

1427
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:46,640
Hi Shasta!

1428
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:50,360
Hi Doc.

1429
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:59,000
Uh..either I’m on a..time machine..

1430
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
or you’re back.

1431
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,600
I’ve been away.

1432
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:06,600
Where've you been?

1433
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:09,820
Up north...family stuff..

1434
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:15,880
anything been happening down here?

1435
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:22,020
Your friend in the a..

1436
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:24,740
construction business?

1437
01:41:24,740 --> 01:41:27,000
Ah, it's all over..

1438
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,860
he’s back with Sloane and 
the kids and..so what?

1439
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:36,440
You know you got a load of 
people out looking for you Shasta.

1440
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:39,540
Well here I am..c’est la vie.

1441
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,540
C’est la vie..

1442
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:44,340
que se’fuckin sera, sera.

1443
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:49,260
Something like that!

1444
01:41:56,980 --> 01:41:59,420
Hah...I like your necklace..

1445
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,680
Umm..it can’t be good..

1446
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:15,080
Got word that your girl is back in town.

1447
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:18,580
Oh yeah? well that’s..ah..news to me.

1448
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:20,580
Where you’ve been?

1449
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,440
No place I’d recommend.

1450
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:27,700
Any developments on the Coy Harlingen matter?

1451
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:29,460
I could give a shit.

1452
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:31,240
Any of them include Prussia?

1453
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:34,340
or Beaverton, or any of the mother 
fuckers that I’ve given you?

1454
01:42:34,340 --> 01:42:38,680
All right, forget that..listen, listen..
any results on those fang marks?

1455
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:44,340
You know, coroner’s people got very upset with me for 
suggesting more lab work, you know that?

1456
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:45,340
Well..

1457
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:49,420
I just thought it'd be a helpful tip to a fellow professional

1458
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,440
Yeah..well how is that Sportello?

1459
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:56,360
Yeah, when your own..ah..hearing comes up!

1460
01:42:57,360 --> 01:42:59,820
What are you suggesting?

1461
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,340
One county supervisor with a bug up his ass..

1462
01:43:06,340 --> 01:43:09,120
is all it takes to bring you down BigFoot.

1463
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:21,280
This is Mrs. Chastity Bjornsen, and if that is one more sociopathic..

1464
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:26,340
special employee of my husband, I will thank you 
to stop harassing him on his day off

1465
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:29,880
-It’s Sportello.  
-Oh, Sportello! Doc Sportello..

1466
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:33,560
The Doc Sportello..so..we meet at last..

1467
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:36,020
Mr. moral fucking turpitude himself?

1468
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:41,220
Have you any idea of the therapist bills around here 
for which you are directly responsible?

1469
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:43,400
The Department picks up just a little. 
-Oh the Department?

1470
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:46,900
Yeah after a deductible that would choke a fuckin horse.

1471
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:49,260
Ahh, you know he called me.

1472
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:51,260
I don’t understand your spineless response to that dirty,

1473
01:43:51,260 --> 01:43:53,260
hippie, piece of shit..

1474
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:55,260
Would you get the fuck up..

1475
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:57,260
get the fuck up Christian..

1476
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:01,800
Christian get the fuck up, now Christian please..

1477
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:04,540
and would you stop acting like a beaten dog,

1478
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:07,780
I ask you for one fuckin day a week.

1479
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:37,180
What kind of girl do you need Doc?

1480
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:47,440
Maybe a thing from one of those Manson chicks?

1481
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,080
Well..

1482
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:51,780
the thing is that ah..

1483
01:44:51,780 --> 01:44:56,240
depends on what ah..you sure you wanna be doing that?

1484
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:59,120
Submissive, brainwashed, horny little teeners..

1485
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:00,720
who'd do exactly what you want ..

1486
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:03,520
before you even know what that is?

1487
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,620
You don’t have to say a word out loud..

1488
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:10,340
 they get it all by ESP..

1489
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:13,440
Your kind of chick Doc?

1490
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:17,980
You’re the one that's been stealing my magazines!

1491
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:20,280
What would Charlie do?

1492
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:22,840
Well..

1493
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:26,240
probably not this.

1494
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:49,440
Listen..

1495
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:53,580
-I’m sorry about Mickey. 
-Ha..Mickey!

1496
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:03,580
Mickey could’ve taught all you swinging 
beach bums a thing or two..

1497
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:08,160
He was just so powerful..

1498
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:15,440
sometimes he could almost make you feel invisible..

1499
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:19,560
fast..

1500
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,020
brutal..

1501
01:46:25,300 --> 01:46:29,660
not what you’d call a considerate lover...

1502
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:35,320
but we adored it about him...

1503
01:46:38,760 --> 01:46:39,780
me...

1504
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:45,560
and Sloane..and Luz..

1505
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:54,780
so nice to be made to feel invisible 
that way sometimes.

1506
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:01,320
And guys just love to hear shit like this.

1507
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:16,880
He’d bring me to lunch in Beverly Hills..

1508
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:23,460
one big hand wrapped around my 
bare arm steering me blind..

1509
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:28,460
down those bright streets into some space 
where it’s dark and cool..

1510
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:31,780
you couldn’t smell any food, only alcohol..

1511
01:47:33,860 --> 01:47:36,420
tables full of them..

1512
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,420
they’d all be drinking..

1513
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,480
in a room that could’ve been any size...

1514
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:50,100
and they all new Mickey..

1515
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:55,060
they wanted, some of them,

1516
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:58,700
to be Mickey..

1517
01:48:01,640 --> 01:48:06,060
he might as well’ve been bringing me in on a leash..

1518
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:14,260
he kept me in those micro-mini dresses..

1519
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:17,960
never allowing me to wear anything underneath..

1520
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:25,100
just..

1521
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:28,060
offering me up to whoever wanted to..

1522
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:30,980
stare..

1523
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,680
grab..

1524
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:37,300
sometimes..

1525
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:40,460
he’d fix me up with some of his friends..

1526
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:44,400
and I have to do...whatever they wanted.

1527
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:46,880
Why are you telling me all this?

1528
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:51,380
Oh...I’m sorry Doc..

1529
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:54,220
you want me to stop?

1530
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:02,620
If my girlfriend had run off to be the 
bought-and-sold whore..

1531
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:05,380
of some scumbag developer?

1532
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:12,620
I’d be so angry I don’t know what I’d do..

1533
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,280
Well..

1534
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:26,200
I’m even lying about that, I know what I’d do..

1535
01:49:27,980 --> 01:49:32,700
if I had the faithless little bitch 
over my lap like this....

1536
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:37,540
this doesn’t mean we’re back together.

1537
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:42,060
Of course not.

1538
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:19,240
You didn’t get this..necklace up north hmm?

1539
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:24,860
I went on a boat ride.

1540
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,260
Hmm...a three hour tour?

1541
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:36,080
They told me I was..

1542
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:38,520
precious cargo that couldn’t be insured..

1543
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:40,820
because of inherent vice.

1544
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,240
What’s that?

1545
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,560
I don’t know.

1546
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:29,020
Inherent Vice..

1547
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:31,420
 in a marine insurance policy..

1548
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:34,400
is anything that you can't avoid..

1549
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,400
eggs break..

1550
01:52:36,400 --> 01:52:39,560
chocolate melts, glass shatters..

1551
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:44,520
and Doc wondered what that meant when 
it applied to ex old ladies

1552
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,780
What’s on your mind Doc?

1553
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:01,040
Besides the usual?

1554
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:10,120
I’m like...you know..

1555
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:14,300
working my salad of a brain crazy lege.

1556
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:17,620
Well..

1557
01:53:17,640 --> 01:53:19,620
put it in another way..

1558
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:23,400
what’s gonna nag at you in the middle of the night?

1559
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:27,340
What’s gonna nag at me in the middle of the night?

1560
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:31,600
little-kid blues...

1561
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,780
saxophone blues..

1562
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:41,820
You know, whatever..

1563
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:47,880
I meant to do, Coy..you know, mistakes aside..

1564
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:54,500
nobody deserves to go through life without 
seeing their daughter..

1565
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:57,380
that don’t sit well with me.

1566
01:54:01,740 --> 01:54:03,340
Then go get ’em.

1567
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:10,160
-Wow, what are you doing here?  
-Wow?

1568
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:12,160
Wanted to see if you’re free for dinner..

1569
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:13,900
didn’t mean to freak you out.

1570
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,460
Are you all right?

1571
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:16,500
Am I?

1572
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:17,780
Are you?

1573
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:20,700
Should I..call security?

1574
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:23,040
I don’t think we need..

1575
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:26,360
This is the one I’ve been telling you about.

1576
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:37,500
Yeah?

1577
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:39,940
You know who of your pals had Mickey Wolfmann?

1578
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,740
What?

1579
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,960
the FBI? I mean we suspected but we couldn’t prove it.

1580
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:45,620
Well, I saw him in their custody.

1581
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:47,620
-You saw him? 
-Yeah

1582
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,680
Would you be willing to let me depone you?

1583
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:53,680
-Sure would.   -You would?

1584
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:54,320
What is it?

1585
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:57,540
You, me, a tape machine, maybe another 
DDA to witness it?

1586
01:54:57,540 --> 01:55:00,560
-All right listen, I need something from you though? 
-What?

1587
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,920
I need to look up somebody’s jacket.

1588
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,220
That’s it?

1589
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:06,600
That’s no big deal, we do that all the time.

1590
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:09,640
What! you break into officially sealed records 
all the time?

1591
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:12,380
Grow up, what’s the name on the file?

1592
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,140
Adrian Prussia.

1593
01:55:26,860 --> 01:55:30,140
As if looking for something he didn’t want to find..

1594
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:33,960
it became clear as Vodka you keep in the ice box..

1595
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:35,660
that whatever the connection..

1596
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:38,780
between the LAPD and Adrian Prussia..

1597
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:42,500
he might as well have been working for them 
as a contract killer..

1598
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:45,600
doing deeds for them they couldn’t do 
for themselves..

1599
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,100
time after time he was pulled in,..

1600
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:51,080
questioned, arraigned, indicted, no matter..

1601
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:53,840
somehow the cases never quite got to trial..

1602
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:57,160
each being bargained down in the interests of justice..

1603
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:58,840
not to mention Adrian..

1604
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:00,840
who invariably walked..

1605
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:03,640
and one of those deeds appeared to be labeled:

1606
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:05,640
The Justifiable Homicide

1607
01:56:05,640 --> 01:56:08,380
of one of the LAPD’s very own...

1608
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:11,140
Vincent Intellicado...

1609
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:14,420
otherwise known as BigFoot’s partner.

1610
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:15,980
BigFoot?!

1611
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:21,760
BigFoot’s partner? Fuckin..BigFoot’s partner?

1612
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,860
BigFoot’s air of possessed melancholy..

1613
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:29,040
now began to make sense..

1614
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:31,640
this was mourning all right..

1615
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:33,060
and it was deep.

1616
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:34,760
Is this your new partner BigFoot?

1617
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:36,360
Want a banana Adrian?

1618
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,980
Bend over and I’ll stick it in for you.

1619
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:40,420
Fuck you, and fuck your banana.

1620
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:42,020
Man oh man..

1621
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:44,160
never be surprised at the levels..

1622
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,900
of disrespect within the LAPD..

1623
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:49,020
but this was down right nasty..

1624
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:51,240
not to mention unprofessional..

1625
01:56:51,240 --> 01:56:53,180
this bond between partners..

1626
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:58,640
was nearly the only thing Doc had ever found to admire 
about the LAPD..

1627
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:02,500
You know there’s places you don’t wanna go Doc..

1628
01:57:02,740 --> 01:57:05,240
go back to the beach..

1629
01:57:05,240 --> 01:57:08,000
you smell like a patchouli fart.

1630
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:11,160
So here is Doc..

1631
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:14,560
midnight..

1632
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:15,580
pitch dark..

1633
01:57:15,580 --> 01:57:18,480
can’t remember whether they’d drained 
the pool or not..

1634
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:21,120
but hey, what the fuck does it matter?

1635
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:23,120
He bounced once..

1636
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:24,160
twice..

1637
01:57:24,160 --> 01:57:26,020
and then off the end of the board..

1638
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:31,320
in a blind cannonball down into old karma 
with Adrian Prussia..

1639
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:33,340
who had not only shot at him once..

1640
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:37,460
 but threatened him with a Carl Yestremsky 
special baseball bat..

1641
01:57:37,460 --> 01:57:38,540
all this..

1642
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:40,680
leaving Doc to wonder:

1643
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:43,660
where’s the partner to watch my back?

1644
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:46,880
Far out man..

1645
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:54,060
right..psychedelic...done.

1646
01:57:57,340 --> 01:57:58,360
So..

1647
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:01,660
you’re here about..?

1648
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,100
Good question!

1649
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:12,840
Wait a minute..this is bullshit..

1650
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:15,380
I remember you..

1651
01:58:15,620 --> 01:58:20,320
You’re that kid from Fritz’s shop up in 
Santa Monica right?

1652
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:23,660
So what’re you up to these days? Skip-tracing?

1653
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:26,260
Or did you go into the priesthood?

1654
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:27,880
P.I

1655
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:31,560
They gave you...a license?

1656
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,940
So who sent you here?

1657
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:36,840
Who you’re working for today?

1658
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:40,740
Ahh..all on..um..spec...on my own time.

1659
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:44,080
Wrong answer...

1660
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:46,280
How much..

1661
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:49,660
of your own time, do you think you 
got left kid?

1662
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:53,300
I was just about to ask..

1663
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:57,300
Howdy....Puck?

1664
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:58,860
Do I know you?

1665
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:01,120
I don’t think I do.

1666
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:05,220
Ah..you must..ah..remind me of someone 
I ran into someplace,

1667
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:06,420
my mistake.

1668
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:09,620
I, have a busy day ahead..

1669
01:59:10,860 --> 01:59:13,420
and I know nothing..

1670
01:59:14,420 --> 01:59:16,480
of any of this.

1671
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:26,360
What are you doing here?

1672
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:31,040
Just..ah....talking to Adrian..

1673
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:36,620
these..ah..

1674
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:40,260
various cases I’m working on..

1675
01:59:40,260 --> 01:59:42,260
and ah..

1676
01:59:45,640 --> 01:59:47,800
Glenn Charlock..

1677
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:52,420
and ah..Vincent Intellicado..

1678
02:00:05,420 --> 02:00:07,160
and ah..

1679
02:00:07,160 --> 02:00:09,720
where..

1680
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,220
did you..ah..

1681
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:18,760
your necklace is...

1682
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:21,300
it looks funny on you..

1683
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:24,060
big man..small necklace..

1684
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:28,980
Acid, invites you through a door..

1685
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:32,040
 PCP opens that door..

1686
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:34,040
shows you through it..

1687
02:00:34,120 --> 02:00:36,780
slams the door behind you..

1688
02:00:37,660 --> 02:00:39,220
and locks it.

1689
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:49,720
Special treat for you today doper..

1690
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:53,680
just got in a shipment of..pure number four..

1691
02:00:55,220 --> 02:00:58,320
ain’t a white guy’s finger laid on it..

1692
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:01,320
between the Golden Triangle and..

1693
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:04,780
your own throbbing vein..

1694
02:01:05,780 --> 02:01:10,440
just let me step out and..I’ll go get you some.

1695
02:01:17,300 --> 02:01:18,780
Don’t go away now.

1696
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:30,780
Puck...

1697
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,400
Pucky..

1698
02:02:57,260 --> 02:02:58,540
Did I get you..?!

1699
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:28,620
BigFoot?

1700
02:03:29,260 --> 02:03:31,200
What the fuck?

1701
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:35,360
Did you take care of them OK Doc?

1702
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:39,620
You fuckin lunatic...what is this?

1703
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:42,400
I’m in enough shit personally with the Captain..

1704
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:45,360
and I’ve seen you on the range, nice work.

1705
02:03:49,140 --> 02:03:52,700
Is that what I think it is? ha?

1706
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:54,460
Just one of the two of them..

1707
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:56,860
there’s more than enough left for evidence.

1708
02:03:56,860 --> 02:03:59,580
Man..BigFoot..I saw the movie..

1709
02:03:59,580 --> 02:04:03,180
as I recall that character comes to a bad end.

1710
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:04,820
Put the gun away Doc.

1711
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:06,820
-What? 
-The gun, put it away

1712
02:04:06,820 --> 02:04:09,920
This is The Golden Fang you’r about 
to rip off man..

1713
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:13,280
the fully fuckin weird outfit that 
kills people.

1714
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:16,600
That’s according to your own delusional 
system, get in the car..

1715
02:04:16,600 --> 02:04:18,460
get in the car.

1716
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:42,380
Where are we going?

1717
02:04:43,820 --> 02:04:46,560
We had to impound your car again..

1718
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:49,680
it was parked illegally.

1719
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:34,700
Dopers’ ESP Doc....dopers’ ESP..

1720
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:47,260
Oooh no, BigFoot you mother fucker..

1721
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:52,360
OK Doc, you have what looks to be a 20 kilo 
inconvenience

1722
02:05:52,360 --> 02:05:53,580
in your trunk..

1723
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:57,060
and BigFoot no doubt putting out word 
to that effect..

1724
02:05:57,060 --> 02:05:59,620
and once again, you’re the bait.

1725
02:06:25,960 --> 02:06:26,800
Hello?

1726
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:29,840
It sure been a long time.

1727
02:06:30,860 --> 02:06:33,280
And, your name was?

1728
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:35,640
This is Crocker Fenway.

1729
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:38,020
Japonica’s dad?

1730
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:42,200
Oh..what happened this time?

1731
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:45,280
You have something that belongs to 
some people I represent..

1732
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:47,600
and they would like it back.

1733
02:06:47,600 --> 02:06:51,920
Oh..so you’re a principal of all this?

1734
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:54,720
It’s only because of me and our small transaction..

1735
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:57,540
over Japonica that you’re still alive.

1736
02:06:57,540 --> 02:06:59,580
Ever so grateful sir..

1737
02:06:59,580 --> 02:07:03,360
so ah..what do we do?

1738
02:07:04,180 --> 02:07:08,540
Suppose someone wants their..ah..back?

1739
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:11,280
Why don’t we meet this evening at 6 o’clock..

1740
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,640
 at my club The Portola, in Elysian Park?

1741
02:07:15,820 --> 02:07:18,340
Aha..is there is a dress code?

1742
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:20,600
Jacket and tie if possible.

1743
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:24,280
I’ll see you then.

1744
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:38,820
Mr. Sportello?

1745
02:07:39,260 --> 02:07:40,820
Mr. Fenway.

1746
02:07:55,680 --> 02:08:00,200
To a..peaceful..resolution.

1747
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:09,180
How is the ah...family?

1748
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:14,100
Japonica is..doing fine if that’s what you mean?

1749
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:17,740
You I know I..ah..

1750
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:21,660
I think I saw Japonica the other day at 
my doctor’s office..

1751
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:27,000
You ever run across a dentist named 
Rudy Blatnoyd?

1752
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:31,420
The son of a bitch who until recently was 
corrupting my daughter?

1753
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:32,360
yes I..

1754
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:35,720
do seem to recall the name. He perished in a..

1755
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:37,780
trampoline accident..didn’t he?

1756
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:40,700
The LAPD aren’t so sure it was an accident.

1757
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:44,060
And you’d like to know if I did it?

1758
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:49,380
What possible motive would I have?

1759
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:52,520
Just because the man preyed on a..

1760
02:08:52,740 --> 02:08:55,780
an emotionally vulnerable child?

1761
02:08:55,780 --> 02:08:58,840
Forced her to engage in sexual practices..

1762
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:02,560
that might appall even a..sophisticate like yourself?

1763
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:05,140
Does that mean I’d have any reason to see 
his miserable..

1764
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:07,240
pedophile career come to an end?

1765
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:08,360
What a...

1766
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:10,980
vindictive person you must imagine me.

1767
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:17,580
I did suspect he was fucking his receptionist but..

1768
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:19,280
what dentist doesn’t?

1769
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:21,620
It’s some oath they all take in dentist school..

1770
02:09:21,620 --> 02:09:22,980
anyhow it’s a..

1771
02:09:22,980 --> 02:09:27,280
long way from strange and weird sex. Isn’t it?

1772
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:29,700
What about when he forced my little girl to 
listen to..

1773
02:09:29,700 --> 02:09:34,920
original cast albums of Broadway musicals 
while he had his way with her?

1774
02:09:34,920 --> 02:09:35,920
Or the..

1775
02:09:37,260 --> 02:09:40,680
tastelessness of...the decor of..

1776
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:44,500
resort hotel rooms..

1777
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:48,640
he took her to during...endodontist conventions?

1778
02:09:48,740 --> 02:09:52,700
the wallpaper......the lamps!

1779
02:09:56,100 --> 02:09:59,320
Japonica is of legal age now, isn’t she?

1780
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:03,360
In their fathers’ eye they’re always too young.

1781
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,100
To the matter at hand..

1782
02:10:12,340 --> 02:10:13,500
those I represent..

1783
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:16,680
are prepared to offer you a generous 
compensation package..

1784
02:10:16,680 --> 02:10:19,780
for the safe return of their property.

1785
02:10:20,600 --> 02:10:23,580
Suppose it didn’t have to be in the form of money?

1786
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:26,620
Well, money would be a lot easier.

1787
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:32,040
There’s a saxophone player named Coy Harlingen..

1788
02:10:32,040 --> 02:10:33,400
he’s been working undercover..

1789
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:36,680
for different anti-subversive outfits 
including the LAPD..

1790
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:40,860
He’s, come to feel lately that he made the 
wrong career choice..

1791
02:10:41,200 --> 02:10:43,560
lost all his family, his freedom..

1792
02:10:43,560 --> 02:10:46,160
like you, he only has one daughter..

1793
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:47,440
Please.

1794
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:51,720
Okay, well, he wants out.

1795
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:54,360
I think I can square with the heat..

1796
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:58,060
there’s this other bunch..Vigilant California..

1797
02:10:58,240 --> 02:11:01,300
and, well, whoever is running them of course..

1798
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:09,620
My guess is, they prefer he not disclose any 
confidential information

1799
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:11,660
I’ll see he never do.

1800
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:13,660
Your personal guarantee?

1801
02:11:13,660 --> 02:11:16,260
I’ll go after him myself if he tries anything.

1802
02:11:17,260 --> 02:11:18,800
Then we have a deal.

1803
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:21,680
That’s all you wanted!

1804
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:25,080
No..money...now..you sure?

1805
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:32,180
Well how much would I have to take from you so I wouldn’t lose your respect?

1806
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:36,660
It’s a bit late for that, Mr. Sportello.

1807
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:38,800
People like you lose all claim to respect..

1808
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:41,440
the first time they pay anybody rent.

1809
02:11:45,580 --> 02:11:48,620
I may not be as well connected..

1810
02:11:48,620 --> 02:11:52,500
for sure not as much into revenge as folks are..

1811
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:56,340
but if you jive with me my man..

1812
02:11:56,560 --> 02:11:59,200
I say to you (....) !

1813
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:01,520
Hmm..?

1814
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:09,060
so, where are we gonna do this hand off?

1815
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:24,480
Golden Fang operatives,12 O’clock, fast approaching.

1816
02:13:03,160 --> 02:13:05,240
Uhm..what’s all this?

1817
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:08,900
It’s a credit card. Don’t hippies have them?

1818
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:12,620
Yeah..I must’ve meant why is you mother 
handing me this?

1819
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:14,180
It’s not for you.

1820
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:18,520
You’re supposed to tell him:

1821
02:13:18,680 --> 02:13:22,220
well done, welcome back to the main herd, 
safe journeys.

1822
02:13:22,820 --> 02:13:24,900
That’s journeys plural.

1823
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:30,000
Ok, I guess I can remember that.

1824
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:40,900
What are you lookin at?

1825
02:13:40,900 --> 02:13:41,760
Huh?

1826
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:53,820
So..you guys been working for The Golden Fang 
long?

1827
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:56,080
Everything is cool, I’m officially off everybody’s payroll..

1828
02:14:56,080 --> 02:14:57,860
Burke Stodger just called me personally..

1829
02:14:57,860 --> 02:15:00,220
you’re a dangerous hombre!

1830
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:25,420
You all right?

1831
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:35,720
You know what the Indians say..

1832
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:40,220
you saved my life..now you’re responsible it.

1833
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:43,100
No, no, no man..no it’s not true

1834
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:46,720
some hippie made that up man..

1835
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:50,900
you saved your own life man, now you get to live it.

1836
02:17:06,380 --> 02:17:09,580
Yet there is no void in time..

1837
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:12,360
the sea of time..

1838
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:16,680
the sea of memory and forgetfulness..

1839
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:21,400
the years of promise gone and unrecoverable..

1840
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:25,620
of the land almost almost allowed to claim 
it’s better destiny..

1841
02:17:25,620 --> 02:17:30,500
only to have that claim jumped by evil doers 
known all too well..

1842
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:32,180
and taken, instead,..

1843
02:17:32,180 --> 02:17:37,020
and held hostage to the future we must live in 
now, forever.

1844
02:17:37,340 --> 02:17:39,020
So who got her?

1845
02:17:39,260 --> 02:17:40,820
The Department of Justice.

1846
02:17:40,980 --> 02:17:43,400
So like..ah..justice was served?

1847
02:17:43,400 --> 02:17:47,120
That’s exactly right, Doc, that’s exactly right.

1848
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:49,580
May we trust this blessed ship..

1849
02:17:49,580 --> 02:17:52,540
was bound for some better shore?

1850
02:17:52,920 --> 02:17:55,300
risen and redeemed..

1851
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:57,980
were the American fate..

1852
02:17:57,980 --> 02:18:01,360
 mercifully failed to transpire.

1853
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:16,320
Don’t get up.

1854
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:18,920
BigFoot, man..

1855
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:23,820
you smashed through my door?!....come on

1856
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:27,800
After a long and busy day of civil rights 
violations..

1857
02:18:28,940 --> 02:18:32,460
I found myself in the neighborhood and 
compelled to drop in..

1858
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:35,540
just to check and see the current state of affairs..

1859
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:37,540
of my old stomping grounds..

1860
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:40,300
seeing as your effort to keep lines of communication..

1861
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:44,200
had been.. limited...to say the least.

1862
02:18:45,740 --> 02:18:48,440
Well.....I’ve been busy.

1863
02:18:49,260 --> 02:18:53,440
Trying to figure out which side of the Zigzag 
papers to stick your sign?

1864
02:18:56,060 --> 02:18:57,480
Give it to me.

1865
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:27,340
Listen..

1866
02:19:27,340 --> 02:19:29,460
I’m sorry about last night..

1867
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:31,040
You?

1868
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:33,500
 Why should you be sorry?

1869
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:36,120
Weird.

1870
02:20:12,220 --> 02:20:14,040
Are you ok brother?

1871
02:20:18,900 --> 02:20:21,140
I’m not your brother.

1872
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,980
Yeah but you could use a keeper.

1873
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:46,420
Remember that day?

1874
02:20:46,540 --> 02:20:50,060
 Ouija board set us off into that big star..

1875
02:20:52,960 --> 02:20:55,760
this feels the same way tonight..

1876
02:20:58,540 --> 02:20:59,920
just us...

1877
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:01,920
together..

1878
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:11,080
almost like being under water..

1879
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:15,780
the world..

1880
02:21:18,440 --> 02:21:19,740
everything...

1881
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:24,900
gone some place else.

1882
02:21:30,340 --> 02:21:34,180
Just figured it was Sortilege setting us up.

1883
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:37,280
