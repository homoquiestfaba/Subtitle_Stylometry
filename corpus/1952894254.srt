9
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:20,770
we have been known to drag ...
the guilty part to the stage.

10
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,262
Swipe them off their phones ...
and there clothes...

11
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:26,331
and make them sing and dance
with the cast ...

12
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,741
naked.
which is always fun.

13
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,300

19
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,900
Tonight! ...
we throw inhibition away.

20
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Why even bother to make a fuss ...

21
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,700
when it's obvious ...

22
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,500
to us, you're here to see ...

23
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
gratuitous nudity.

24
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,827
Tonight! ...
we show no remorse or apology.

25
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:47,000
Tonight! ...
we sing Billy Graham doxology.

26
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,300
Tonight! ...
it's no wonder that we're all the rage.

27
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Tonight! ...
we give new meaning to a bare stage.

28
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Pat Robertson should live in fear.

29
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,300
Stick it in your rear.

30
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,087
We're here.
No crudity. Just gratuitous nudity.

31
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:13,395
My mother ...
spent all of the money she earned,

32
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:17,995
on tap shoes and tights
and the lessons I've learned.

33
00:05:18,595 --> 00:05:23,195
If she saw me today,
well what would I say?

34
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:26,495
For my ten years of tap ...

35
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:31,995
and six years of ballet.

36
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:33,995
Look, ...

37
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:38,695
I'm grateful for ...
all my professional gains.

38
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:47,047
And now I can tell her:
"Hey look ma, no Hanes".

39
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:53,095
Tonight! ... There's an atmosphere
where it's alright to stare.

40
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:58,995
Tonight! ...You won't wonder
what's under our underwear.

41
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:02,505
Oh! ...Oh! ...Oh! ...Jerry ...
sorry ....Jerry.

42
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:05,268
So phone. I knew it ...
So phone.

43
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:10,223
I'll take that.

44
00:06:11,215 --> 00:06:12,719
Hallo?

45
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,508
No, This is not Sal.
Who is this?

46
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,956
Sal's mom.

47
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,514
He can't get to the phone now.
He's about to get naked.

48
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:26,101
Did you hear the announcing ...
before the show?

49
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,834
No I'm sorry.
- Well, What it said is.

50
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:32,223
If your cell phone went off during the
performance, You have to get naked with us.

51
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:34,485
So ...

52
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,885
So come on Sal, come on.

53
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:57,995
Sorry, Sal, you won't get the phone back,
for you are in the show now.

54
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:01,395
So can you sing and dance? 'course,
we can use another guy.

55
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:07,172
All right. Who want to see Sal
sing and dance - Naked?

56
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:11,172
Do you want to see Sal sing and dance?
- Yea, come on Sal.

57
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:18,404
So, in a count of tree, - this will be Sal's
very first naked performance.

58
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,991
Ready?
Ready, Sal?

59
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,299
One ... two ...
tree.

60
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,192
Where were we?

61
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:55,884
Tonight! ... there's an atmosphere
where it's alright to stare.

62
00:07:56,084 --> 00:08:01,095
Tonight! ... You won't wonder
what's under our underwear.

63
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:04,395
You're straight or you're bi ...
or transgendered or queer.

64
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:07,195
There's only one reason tonight ...
that you're here.

65
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:12,995
So side by side and front to rear.

66
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:18,295
We will shout out loud:
"We're proud".  -No prudity.

67
00:08:18,495 --> 00:08:22,495
Tonight you're gonna see.

68
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:31,992
I stand before you naked.
What's left of me to show?

69
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:38,873
The doors and blinds are shut now.
There's nowhere else to go.

70
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:42,298
I've peeled off all the layers.

71
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:45,522
And what have I discovered?

72
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:55,170
That being naked means much more ..
than being just uncovered.

73
00:08:55,205 --> 00:09:01,542
Today I want to learn ...
all that nakedness could mean.

74
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:10,395
I need to know that who I am, ...
isn't shameful or obscene.

75
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,995
For if what we think is true.

76
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,995
And honesty our goal.

77
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:27,995
Oh then nakedness is just ...
another window to the soul.

78
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:33,895
Tonight! ...
No drama tragic with a bleak end.

79
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:40,036
Tonight! ...
It's more like Palm Springs on a weekend.

80
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:42,826
Tonight! ...
Good old Shakespeare's considered a bore.

81
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:45,743
Tonight! ...
Something new and unique is in store.

82
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:51,416
We love to hear our audience roar.
just hear them roar!!

83
00:09:51,616 --> 00:09:56,995
If you yell and scream ...
for more you're sure to see.

84
00:09:57,114 --> 00:10:02,243
Oh yes you're sure to see.
Oh yes they're sure to see.

85
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:10,216
Gratuitous, gratuitous,
gratuitous, gratuitous nudity.

86
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,992
Tonight.

87
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:25,259
The Naked Maid.

88
00:10:25,946 --> 00:10:29,348
I told an old acquaintance
I was desperate for a job.

89
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:33,407
And oddly then he asked
if I was anal or a slob.

90
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:37,331
He said he cleaned apartments and,
he could use a hand.

91
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:39,903
But, there's one stipulation ...

92
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:44,830
his customers demand.

93
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,703
Scrubbing toilets with your dick out.

94
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:52,491
Vacuum carpets in the buff.

95
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:57,067
Making sure your buttocks stick out.

96
00:10:57,267 --> 00:11:01,004
Waiting for the sheets ...
to fold and fluff.

97
00:11:01,204 --> 00:11:04,951
Flash a lot of muscle.
while dutifully you hustle, ...

98
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:08,920
to make a hovel ...
sparkle like the Taj Mahal.

99
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,807
Nudity is fun to me.
Attention is like sex to me.

100
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:16,468
Cleaning is good therapy, ...
so till my bills are paid,

101
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:20,114
I really sort of love my job.
I'm a naked maid.

102
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:31,114
At the start the client's nervous.

103
00:11:31,614 --> 00:11:34,929
That's when you become the host.

104
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:38,714
Tell them all about your service.

105
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:42,300
Laugh about ...
which Olsen twin you hate the most.

106
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,255
Next you start disrobing.
And then begin your probing.

107
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,976
Looking for the tools ...
you need to clean his house.

108
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:54,023
Paper towels and bathroom duck.
And all the while he wants to fuck.

109
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:57,414
Unless he's cute he's out of luck, ...
my business cards are laid.

110
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:01,156
Not "mop and blow or spic and spank"
it says "The naked maid"

111
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:02,877
Call me.
You are dirty.

112
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:08,238
He will follow you like cattle.

113
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:12,312
Let him ogle all he likes.

114
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:15,804
As you clean you sort of prattle.

115
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,799
Entertain him ...
as the moment strikes.

116
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:23,435
An odd scenario. Some say it's scary. Oh.

117
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:27,225
It's naked stand-up comedy ...
except you use a broom.

118
00:12:27,325 --> 00:12:31,010
Working on my hands and knees.
Getting into crevices.

119
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,898
Knowing that I'm sure to ...
please you as I promenade.

120
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:38,738
It's good clean fun for you and me.
Just call the naked maid.

121
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,482
I charge extra for The Valley.

122
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,643
But I give a discount, ...
if you live in West Hollywood.

123
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:56,250
The neighbors will love it...
when I doo windows

124
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:21,183
When all is clean and dried, ...
I gave it my best shot.

125
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:25,265
The body of my work ...
has left him pleased, ...

126
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:27,240
yet hot.

127
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,265
For now until my ship comes in, ...

128
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:33,765
I really wouldn't trade ...

129
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:38,265
The satisfaction
that I get to be your naked maid.

130
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:42,395
But ...

131
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:48,227
just to add a coda.
That when I reach my quota.

132
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:54,060
I don't care an iota
for the gift of cleanliness.

133
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:00,020
I hope you won't think less.
Unless I can undress ...

134
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:04,180
to show off and impress.
I crave all to obsess.

135
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:16,733
The irony I guess ...
is my place, is a mess.

136
00:14:18,632 --> 00:14:20,466
What a dump.

137
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:44,163
The Bliss Of A Bris

138
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:40,876
When I was eight days old ...
a crowd gathered in my room.

139
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:46,524
With a man in a robe
and hat and something shiny in his hand.

140
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:48,740
And he said: ...

141
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:52,708
Behold the fruit of his mother's womb.

142
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:57,251
And he spoke in a language ...
that I couldn't even understand.

143
00:15:57,351 --> 00:16:00,051
Baruchatah ...Whatever.

144
00:16:00,485 --> 00:16:06,473
And the people squealed ...
as my manhood was revealed.

145
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:11,519
And he held it up ...
for everyone to see.

146
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:19,265
They said it was Divine.
And they toasted it with wine.

147
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:34,107
And behaved ...
as though it had a pedigree.

148
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:39,887
Ah the Bliss, ...
of a Bris.

149
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:43,834
When they all congregate ...
to admire your penis.

150
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,999
They stare. And the glare ...

151
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:50,899
of their idolization ...
is brighter than Venus.

152
00:16:52,028 --> 00:16:55,428
They're awed. They applaud ...

153
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:59,228
as they thrill at the sight...
of it's dazzling perfection.

154
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,618
They gasp as they grasp ...

155
00:17:02,818 --> 00:17:06,218
how sublime it will be ...
when it has an erection.

156
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,618
They rave at the length ...
and the marvelous angle.

157
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:13,687
They kvell at the girth and ...
they plotz at the dangle.

158
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:18,260
It doesn't get better than this.
The Bliss of a Bris.

159
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:19,884
"Mazel Tov".

160
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,287
You suppose that these roses ...
are going to be thrown every day. - Whee.

161
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:29,547
Ah! But then they snip off the tip ...
once you've shown it.

162
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:33,682
And that's when they say:
don't expose it again.

163
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:36,535
But I do. ...
I'll show you.

164
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:40,703
And then you may ...
commence complimenting and cooing ...

165
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:43,845
so gaze. Give it praise.

166
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:47,711
Like a Liz Taylor movie ...
with Rex Reed reviewing.

167
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:51,134
Acclaim it. Adore it. ...
Extol it. Exalt it.

168
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:55,009
Rejoice in it's glory.
For God's sake don't fault it.

169
00:17:55,109 --> 00:18:00,942
Fawning and flattering, ...
worshipping, swooning.

170
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:10,370
Remember ...
it doesn't need any more pruning.

171
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:16,093
Just say ...
"It's like butter."

172
00:18:16,293 --> 00:18:18,542
So now bagel cutter her.

173
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:20,255
Bask in it's splendor.

174
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:22,300
Unplug the blender.

175
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,993
No sharp objects near it.

176
00:18:24,351 --> 00:18:31,680
Simply revere it.

177
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:43,143
Oh how I miss ...
a Bliss of a Bris.

178
00:19:17,511 --> 00:19:20,606
Window to Window

179
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:56,219
There you are again.
Passing by your window.

180
00:19:56,254 --> 00:20:01,420
Will you look out, ...
and see me standing here?

181
00:20:05,058 --> 00:20:10,207
Here I am again.
Standing at my window.

182
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:16,413
Will we play the same old game?
So far, so near.

183
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:24,203
The accidental glance,
where we discover one another.

184
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:28,929
Then we'll make up an excuse
to look again.

185
00:20:29,475 --> 00:20:35,155
And finally we fix our gaze
from behind our window sills.

186
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:42,495
Where we silently agree
we both like what we see.

187
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:52,479
And here we are again.
Slowly rising passion.

188
00:20:52,679 --> 00:21:02,542
Will this be the night, ...
you beckon me to come to you?

189
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:08,659
'Cause if you send for me,
I will touch you and caress you.

190
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:14,635
And if you send for me, ...
I will tell you all the things I dream.

191
00:21:14,735 --> 00:21:20,486
And how ev'rything with you, ...
feels so right.

192
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:27,840
And make sweet love,...
until the morning light.

193
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:40,295
Here we go again. ...
Taking off our shirts.

194
00:21:40,395 --> 00:21:45,303
And teasing with the way, ...
we slide our pants down.

195
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:54,265
And in our underwear. ...
How we stop and stare.

196
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:59,420
The things that we go through, ...
to let our guards down.

197
00:22:02,184 --> 00:22:07,765
The connection that was made ...
from window to window.

198
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:13,265
There's magic in that alone.

199
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:18,265
A moment by itself, ...
that can't be taken lightly.

200
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:23,586
At last someone ...
to call my own.

201
00:22:23,686 --> 00:22:29,534
And if you send for me, ...
I will feel and kiss and hold you.

202
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:35,022
And if you send for me, ...
I will share my beating heart.

203
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:40,971
Knowing everything with you, ..
will be alright.

204
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:47,358
And make sweet love, ...
until the morning light.

205
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:52,447
I see the way you want me.

206
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:55,104
It's the way that I want you.

207
00:22:55,204 --> 00:22:57,271
I want you ...

208
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,144
I want you ...

209
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:05,067
I want you.

210
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:11,672
Please won't you send for me?
We could start a lifetime of caring.

211
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:17,171
Come on send for me. ...
Take a risk. Be daring.

212
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:23,191
I know everything for us, ...
will turn out right.

213
00:23:28,479 --> 00:23:33,671
No don't pull down the shade. ...
And don't turn out your light.

214
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:40,310
Let's end this silly game.
Don't lose sight.

215
00:23:45,903 --> 00:23:48,265
Please, just one last peek.

216
00:23:48,765 --> 00:23:52,265
I'm the one you seek.

217
00:23:54,765 --> 00:24:12,065
Well then.
Until tomorrow night

218
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:41,995
Fight the Urge

219
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:55,265
Don't. Please don't.
Don't do it.

220
00:24:55,765 --> 00:24:59,074
Think of really ugly girls, ...
and the smell of body odor

221
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:01,991
and your parents having sex. Eugh!

222
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:08,619
Don't. I'm embarrassed
and I'm shy and it's happening by reflex.

223
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:16,127
Wait. Please wait.
Wait a minute.

224
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:18,468
Wait until I'm in my locker

225
00:25:18,503 --> 00:25:21,816
and they've given me my towel
and I've put on my Hanes.

226
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:28,711
Shit. Wait. It's an evolution oversight,
that dicks have no brains.

227
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:37,076
Breathe. Just breathe.
Breathe deeply.

228
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:42,570
Pretend you're in a forest, surrounded ...
by tranquility and no one else is here.

229
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:49,235
Right. Breathe. Nothing like hard evidence, ...
to prove that I'm a queer.

230
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,465
Screwing up in gym class ...
or the baseball field.

231
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:56,779
The basketball court.
The wrestling match.

232
00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:02,712
I hate this Nazi torture, ...
as it stands

233
00:26:02,747 --> 00:26:06,323
Then like World War II, ...
we're forced to wait for the shower.

234
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:11,643
And I don't have the power,
to control my fucking glands.

235
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:14,927
Thank God for my hands.

236
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:18,997
Fight the urge.

237
00:26:19,165 --> 00:26:21,935
No - wait.
- Breathe.

238
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,519
Fight the urge.

239
00:26:25,554 --> 00:26:28,831
Really ugly girl. In my Hanes.
No one's here.

240
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:31,699
Let my mind and body converge.

241
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,793
Yes it's for thrills, ...
to see Bobby Baker nude.

242
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:38,544
but you don't understand, ...
that pointing is rude.

243
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:40,483
Fight the urge.

244
00:26:45,831 --> 00:26:50,115
Stop. Oh stop. Stop thinking.

245
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:53,763
The more you focus on it, ...
the more the blood is flowing.

246
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,662
The more you feel the rush.

247
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,983
Help.
Stop.

248
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:01,879
It makes the lead go to my pencil, ...
and my whole body flush.

249
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:06,342
Letting nature happen here, ...
could ruin my life.

250
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:09,631
And get me punched in the nose.
Called a big fag.

251
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:14,765
I wonder if this fight, ...
will take it's toll?

252
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:18,265
So while I'll never be normal ...
and I won't have a wife.

253
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:24,206
I can still have a life ...
if I can get myself under control.

254
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:25,963
That's the goal.

255
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:28,816
Don't think of a pole

256
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:32,528
Or a hole.

257
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:40,206
Hey, Bobby. Bobby Baker, Bobby Baker,
Bobby Baker, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby Baker.

258
00:27:42,122 --> 00:27:46,811
Oh wait. Please wait.

259
00:27:46,911 --> 00:27:50,811
Wait a minute until I am at my locker ...
and I've put on my Hanes.  Shit- Wait- Oh

260
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:54,811
- Hate this Nazi torture give me my fucking towel.

261
00:27:54,902 --> 00:28:04,039
No. No. No.
Fight the urge.

262
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:07,417
Don't wait breathe stop
Don't wait breathe stop

263
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,177
Fight the urge.

264
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:13,171
Bloody nose. You're a faggot.
Ruin my life.

265
00:28:13,206 --> 00:28:16,385
All these thoughts ...
I'm desperate to purge.

266
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,903
No one's noticed yet.
If they did I'd have died.

267
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:24,424
I can't let anyone know ...
what's happening inside.

268
00:28:28,808 --> 00:28:42,106
I am all alone.

269
00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:01,538
Nothin' But the Radio On

270
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:07,796
Honey, Aunt Ruby just gave ...
Daddy and me this Playgirl magazine.

271
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:11,027
Now, I can't believe ...
you'd expose yourself like that.

272
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:14,587
I don't know how I'm ever gonna ...
hold my head up in this town again.

273
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,760
What were you thinking?

274
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:23,326
Hey Chris, why didn't you tell me ...
you were gonna ruin your career ...

275
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:26,075
not to mention mine? I'm your agent, we've gotta talk.

276
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:29,075
Hold on I've got another call coming in.

277
00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:40,387
Marilyn Monroe posed without clothes, ...

278
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:44,598
for a backroom calendar;
one of those.

279
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:48,442
The nation was shocked.
Mama called her a sleaze.

280
00:29:48,543 --> 00:29:52,995
But she sold a million calendars ...
and tripled her fees.

281
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:58,190
She was just starting ...
and a little naive.

282
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:02,688
When the press asked hon:
"what did you have on?"

283
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:05,738
Would you believe she said?

284
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:09,394
I had nothing but the radio on.

285
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,894
Nothing but the radio on.

286
00:30:14,383 --> 00:30:18,244
Now tell me boys is that so wrong?

287
00:30:18,344 --> 00:30:23,394
You'd best be believing, ...
it was playing the sweetest song.

288
00:30:23,894 --> 00:30:27,394
With nothing but the radio on.

289
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:33,066
Young Burt Reynolds ...
did his own spread

290
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:36,810
In Cosmo magazine,
everybody has read.

291
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,891
On a bearskin rug with a grin on his face.

292
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:43,448
With one hand over his talent.

293
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:45,946
The man has taste.

294
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:52,016
And two decades later Momma's just stunned.

295
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,228
But when the talk died down ...
in our sleepy town.

296
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:56,394
in the sleepy old town ...

297
00:30:56,894 --> 00:30:59,394
Burt was the new number one.

298
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:03,394
And he had nothing but the radio on.

299
00:31:04,252 --> 00:31:07,640
Nothing but the radio on.

300
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,737
Now tell me boys
is that so wrong?

301
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:17,463
You'd best be believing,
it was playing the sweetest song.

302
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:21,394
Nothing but the radio on.

303
00:31:34,745 --> 00:31:39,150
With nothing but a few dreams,
and a pleasing personality.

304
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,451
Though I had ambition I was shy.

305
00:31:43,551 --> 00:31:47,420
But you know I kind a like ...
being in the light.

306
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,040
When the cameras started clicking

307
00:31:51,240 --> 00:32:01,211
I was a star burning bright.

308
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:07,174
And I had nothing but the radio on.

309
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:09,639
Nothing but the radio.

310
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:12,167
Nothing but the radio.

311
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:16,113
Now I don't believe that it's oh so wrong.

312
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:24,418
And from now on ...
they'll be playing my country song.

313
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,387
Yea! Nothing but the radio on.

314
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:38,975
I'm at my best. I'm better than all the rest.

315
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:43,331
Nothing but the radio on.

316
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:47,779
Nothing but the radio on. ...

317
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:58,694
Nothing but the radio on. ...

318
00:33:14,935 --> 00:33:18,631
Jack's Song.

319
00:33:30,807 --> 00:33:36,100
When all those trials and tribulations
gather daily at my door.

320
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:41,240
When all those petty aggravations are attracting even more.

321
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:48,009
In my hour of desperation
something always pulls me through.

322
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:57,049
Thus I find rejuvenation
doing what I always do.

323
00:33:57,671 --> 00:34:02,291
I beat my meat.

324
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:05,609
I beat my meat.

325
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:12,211
I get a grip and zip zip zip.
I'm gonna give myself a treat.

326
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:15,155
I seek relief.

327
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:17,410
I pound my beef.

328
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:23,228
I breathe a sigh and yet, ...
if I don't feel contented and complete.

329
00:34:24,447 --> 00:34:26,400
I just repeat.

330
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,072
I beat my meat.

331
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:37,050
You don't need an education
You don't need a PHD.

332
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:42,526
All you need is concentration
and the rest comes naturally.

333
00:34:42,926 --> 00:34:50,066
You don't need collaboration.
Calvin Klein’s or great physiques.

334
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,746
Now we'll do a demonstration  ...

335
00:34:55,556 --> 00:34:59,702
of a few of our techniques.

336
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:05,938
I beat my meat.

337
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:08,887
I beat my meat.

338
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:13,930
I get a grip and zip zip zip
I'm gonna give myself a treat.

339
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:16,896
I beat my meat.

340
00:35:16,996 --> 00:35:18,216
I beat my meat.

341
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:25,012
I breathe a sigh and yet, ...
if I don't feel contented and complete.

342
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:30,942
Then I repeat, and I repeat, and I repeat.
I beat my meat

343
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:55,300
Pardon us for moralizing.

344
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:59,940
But our favorite form of exercising.

345
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:02,100
Is socially correct

346
00:37:02,163 --> 00:37:05,700
As well as appetizing.

347
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:13,985
'Cause who would serve a steak
in need of tenderizing.

348
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:19,154
So ...

349
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:24,554
I beat my meat

350
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:26,978
I beat my meat

351
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:29,836
And zip zip zip I get a grip.

352
00:37:29,936 --> 00:37:31,690
I'm gonna give myself a treat.

353
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,063
I beat my meat.

354
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:34,579
I beat my meat.

355
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:38,400
And when I do I'm telling you
I'm contented and complete.

356
00:37:38,486 --> 00:37:39,847
I get a thrill.

357
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:41,383
I get the grill.

358
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:44,350
Change my attire.
And light the fire.

359
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,519
I salt I oil and then I broil then
we say grace and then we eat.

360
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:51,235
But first I beat, but first I beat,
but first I beat, but first I beat

361
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:59,719
I beat my meat.

362
00:38:29,718 --> 00:38:31,910
Robert Mitchum

363
00:38:40,122 --> 00:38:43,939
There must be something wrong with me.

364
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,824
'Cause I don't find in the least sexy.

365
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:51,171
All those pretty boys
with their perfect bods.

366
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:54,868
Prancing around like Hollywood gods.

367
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:58,174
Yet, everywhere that I care to look.

368
00:38:58,274 --> 00:39:01,892
In every movie and every book.

369
00:39:01,992 --> 00:39:06,882
I see, I see, I see.
Those guys with their deltoids pumped.

370
00:39:06,982 --> 00:39:11,104
And their sex appeal
has my libido stumped.

371
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,679
As for me,
I long for the days of Robert Mitchum.

372
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:20,742
I know he was a little beefy and soft.

373
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:24,696
But when he took it all off.

374
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,951
He was Bitchin

375
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:33,000
As for me
I long for the days when guys didn't look,

376
00:39:33,016 --> 00:39:36,202
like they spent all week at the gym.

377
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:40,916
Skinny legs
and love handles were in.

378
00:39:41,016 --> 00:39:47,619
At least a smidgeon, ...
give me Robert Mitchum.

379
00:39:49,623 --> 00:39:53,225
Now I'm not immune
to the well known charms,

380
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:57,057
of a drop dead chest
and some well toned arms.

381
00:39:57,157 --> 00:40:00,423
But a little flaw here and there

382
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:04,299
makes it hard for me not to stare.

383
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:07,553
Now I'll never look like Marky Mark.

384
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:13,367
But some people say
I've a real big heart.

385
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:19,383
It's true it's true oh God
I would have been hot back then.

386
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:25,514
Before the age of implants and collagen.

387
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:31,183
As for me
I long for the days of Robert Mitchum.

388
00:40:31,283 --> 00:40:34,289
Though he smoked,
and did a lot of bad stuff.

389
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:38,041
But when he acted real tough.

390
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:41,331
He had me twitchin'.

391
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:46,583
As for me
I long for the days when guys didn't drink

392
00:40:46,683 --> 00:40:49,931
bottled water but bottles of gin.

393
00:40:50,537 --> 00:40:54,495
Or fret about the state of their skin.

394
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:56,836
That's when I would ditch 'em.

395
00:40:56,936 --> 00:41:01,016
Give me Robert Mitchum.

396
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:15,019
Does anybody
remember him in Cape Fear?

397
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:18,501
Now that was a moving experience.

398
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:22,487
He was homicidally sexually serious.

399
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:26,967
Bad to the core and the little he wore.

400
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,617
I'll never forget and better yet.

401
00:41:30,717 --> 00:41:34,278
When his bedroom eyes came into view.

402
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:37,720
You know he knew just what to do.

403
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,586
A perfect ten.
Back in the days of real men.

404
00:41:43,686 --> 00:41:46,554
Like Robert Mitchum.

405
00:41:46,654 --> 00:41:48,266
And I'm not alone.

406
00:41:48,731 --> 00:41:53,092
As for us, we long for the days of ..
Robert Mitchum.

407
00:41:53,192 --> 00:41:55,893
When guys came in all sizes and shapes.

408
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,831
And some could even get dates.

409
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:02,926
And while we're dishin'

410
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:07,949
As for us we long for the days
when guys weren't so young.

411
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:10,784
Or tall or thin or perfectly done.

412
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:17,109
Now let's be frank.
So perfectly hung.

413
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:22,602
A perfect ten back
in the days of real men.

414
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:27,844
Like Robert Mitchum.

415
00:42:46,578 --> 00:42:48,819
Members Only

416
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:47,029
According to the
American Heritage Dictionary

417
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:59,305
of the English Language.

418
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:05,512
Penis is the male organ of copulation.
And in mammals urinary

419
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:07,891
excretion.

420
00:44:12,701 --> 00:44:16,989
When one lists the male genitalia.

421
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:20,928
There's one book
'twill never ever failya.

422
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:28,926
When fishin' for a definition
let us not forget.

423
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:34,886
The infamous Thesaurus by Roget. - Rogét

424
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:45,667
According to the southern Baptist
sexual manual - penis is

425
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:56,700
In matters categorical or even metaphorical

426
00:44:56,756 --> 00:45:04,964
We've only found an oracle
or something sophomorical.

427
00:45:05,718 --> 00:45:08,927
So unabridged,
and until now,

428
00:45:09,427 --> 00:45:12,099
unexposed

429
00:45:12,134 --> 00:45:15,754
We present the different geneses.

430
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:22,375
The long and short of
what we call our penises.

431
00:45:45,933 --> 00:45:49,902
Dick dick

432
00:45:50,802 --> 00:45:53,902

433
00:45:54,002 --> 00:45:56,116

435
00:45:58,004 --> 00:46:02,756
Dick.- Prick. Dick.- Prick. Dick.- Prick. Dick.- Prick.

436
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,584
Dick-a ... Prick-a ... Dick-a ... Prick-a ...

Does he wear it on the right?
Is it tan or black or white?

443
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:13,262
Does he wear it on the left?

444
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:15,123
Big fat short thin?

445
00:47:15,143 --> 00:47:18,152
Pink or purple head?
Thick. fat. short, thin?

446

Is it tan or is it red? Or
pink tan black white

447
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:23,000
Big or small?  Left or right?

448
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:24,828
Here's a dink and here's a pecker.

449
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:28,742
Here it cums, ...
a double decker.

450
00:47:28,777 --> 00:47:34,972
What a wanker! What a wanker!
What a wanker! What a wanker!

451

Peeeeeeeeeeeee ... nis.

Perky Little Porn Star

455
00:48:43,026 --> 00:48:45,243
You see?

456
00:48:47,035 --> 00:48:52,146
I'm a perky little porn star
from Skokie, Illinois.

457
00:48:52,803 --> 00:48:55,835
My mother doesn't like my job at all.

458
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:59,783
If I have to go to work.
Sexuality's a perk.

459
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:03,195
But she says
it's just as far as I can fall.

460
00:49:03,295 --> 00:49:07,299
See I'm a Jewish boy inside, ...
but the nice part went and died, ...

461
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:10,422
on the first day, ...
that I showed up on the set.

462
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:13,027
I could hear the rabbi screaming, ...

463
00:49:13,127 --> 00:49:14,796
'cause I did what I was dreaming ...

464
00:49:14,896 --> 00:49:17,755
since the day, ...
I saw Tab Hunter soaking wet.

465
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:20,362
When your background is suburban, ...

466
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:22,499
sex can be a bit perturbing, ...

467
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:25,682
subject of your penis is taboo.

468
00:49:25,782 --> 00:49:29,880
It really is a thrill though, ...
to monkey with a dildo, ...

469
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,291
and let the world watch ...
you while you screw.

470
00:49:33,624 --> 00:49:37,324
I'm a perky little porn star
from Skokie, Illinois.

471
00:49:37,624 --> 00:49:40,524
I can't believe it's happening to me.

472
00:49:40,824 --> 00:49:43,224
Guys are jealous of the sex ...

473
00:49:43,324 --> 00:49:44,824
with Ryan, Jeff and Rex.

474
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:47,824
I get to live a gay mans fantasy.

475
00:49:47,924 --> 00:49:52,124
But try to tell an old curmudgeon ...
that you like to push the fudge in ...

476
00:49:52,224 --> 00:49:55,603
for the cam'ras ...
with two guys or three or four.

477
00:49:55,703 --> 00:49:59,703
He will call you Heretic ...
Sinner, Aberrant, you are sick.

478
00:49:59,803 --> 00:50:03,063
Blow the shofar, ...
not a boy on Yom Kippur.

479
00:50:03,163 --> 00:50:07,591
If I shoot a film on Sukkoth, ..
dicks both in my mouth and tuchus

480
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:10,683
A sudden gust of family shame, ...
attacks

481
00:50:10,783 --> 00:50:12,624
I continue giving head, ...

482
00:50:12,824 --> 00:50:14,324
and pretend that mom is dead, ...

483
00:50:14,824 --> 00:50:18,324
so my conscience ...
and my sphincter can relax.

484
00:50:18,624 --> 00:50:22,324
I'm a perky little porn star ...
from Skokie, Illinois

485
00:50:22,524 --> 00:50:25,324
I don't quite make a killing ...
spilling seed.

486
00:50:25,824 --> 00:50:27,624
But the money's pretty good, ...

487
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,843
and as long as I get wood, ...

488
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:32,724
I can have ...
the little comforts that I need.

489
00:50:32,924 --> 00:50:35,288
See, ...
depending on the ratio, ...

490
00:50:35,388 --> 00:50:37,367
of schtupping to fellatio ...

491
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,216
and what I'll do, ...
and what he'll do to me.

492
00:50:40,616 --> 00:50:44,543
I know I've really got 'em, ...
if I say I'll top or bottom.

493
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:48,021
Profit comes from versatility.

494
00:50:48,121 --> 00:50:50,059
There's a part of me that's guilty, ...

495
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:51,791
but if my costar is built, ...

496
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:55,523
he makes me whimper, ...
jodle, scream and sound and beg.

497
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:59,540
Thrilled the film is getting made, ...
I'm getting paid and getting laid. ...

498
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:03,267
and his family jewels, ...
are larger than my leg. - Whee!

499
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:06,324
I'm a perky little porn star ...
from Skokie, Illinois.

500
00:51:07,075 --> 00:51:10,141
I've got some awesome films ...
for you to rent.

501
00:51:11,086 --> 00:51:18,891
This may be my legacy.
No great actor's life for me.

502
00:51:18,991 --> 00:51:23,174
And I guess this means ...
I can't be president.

503
00:51:23,851 --> 00:51:27,447
So my prospects may seem bleak.

504
00:51:27,547 --> 00:51:30,520
You may see me as a freak.

505
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,943
But I did it, ...
and I'll take the consequence.

506
00:51:35,211 --> 00:51:39,085
I guess I needed to rebel, ...

507
00:51:39,185 --> 00:51:43,883
from my goodie goodie hell.

508
00:51:43,983 --> 00:51:47,687
But I love it and I made it

509
00:51:47,787 --> 00:51:49,571
Pretty soon I'll get a cut, ...

510
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:53,755
when they start to sell ...
the nifty rubber version of my butt.

511
00:51:53,856 --> 00:51:58,337
And when my posterior ...
goes down for posterity.

512
00:51:58,437 --> 00:52:02,430
They can't say he's inferior, ...
because he chose to bare it.

513
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:07,258
He's a perky little porn star from Skokie,

514
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:12,244
from Skokie, Illinois.

515
00:52:12,344 --> 00:52:16,297
I'm a perky little porn
star from Skokie Illinois. --- Oi!

516
00:52:33,285 --> 00:52:36,212
Kris, Look What You've Missed.

517
00:52:57,734 --> 00:53:04,031
I was naked. I was raw, ...

518
00:53:04,636 --> 00:53:08,979
and oh so vulnerable.

519
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,857
I got angry. I got lost.

520
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:19,411
I loved you so much.

521
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:23,965
Such talent, such humor.

522
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,323
So much to live for.

523
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,169
With passion. With fever.

524
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:37,463
You were my life.

525
00:53:37,864 --> 00:53:39,743
You're the one who left.

526
00:53:40,243 --> 00:53:43,744
But there's nothing left to me

527
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:49,279
Kris look what you've missed.

528
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,320
I have more friends there, ...

529
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,740
than I do here.

530
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:10,165
So many. So wasteful.

531
00:54:10,874 --> 00:54:16,146
I try to forget.

532
00:54:16,646 --> 00:54:19,246
I'm busy. I'm active.

533
00:54:19,346 --> 00:54:22,551
I have to survive.

534
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:25,202
I am empty. It's lonely.

535
00:54:25,302 --> 00:54:32,258
But I am alive.

536
00:54:32,364 --> 00:54:35,211
I'm the one who's left.

537
00:54:35,423 --> 00:54:38,225
And I wanted it to be we.

538
00:54:38,615 --> 00:54:43,764
Kris look what you've missed.

539
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,364
I miss you.

540
00:54:49,864 --> 00:54:54,353
I wonder how much you'd have changed.

541
00:54:55,396 --> 00:55:00,593
Life goes on.
I'm dating. I have a great job.

542
00:55:00,693 --> 00:55:03,602
I love you. I laugh now.

543
00:55:03,702 --> 00:55:08,071
Remembering things.
You're with me.

544
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:16,864
Part of me. We're growing up.

545
00:55:17,364 --> 00:55:19,671
We are still as one.

546
00:55:20,815 --> 00:55:23,602
Oh but I'm becoming me.

547
00:55:23,802 --> 00:55:29,065
Kris, look what you've missed.

548
00:55:31,146 --> 00:55:34,969
Richard got fat.
Then got thin.

549
00:55:35,972 --> 00:55:37,505
Marco went bald.

550
00:55:38,344 --> 00:55:41,055
And Michael is famous.

551
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:47,361
And Sam hasn't changed.

552
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:55,302
Your nephew is married.
The whole world's on line.

553
00:55:55,402 --> 00:55:58,118
There's hope now. We're living.

554
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:05,364
I feel OK.

555
00:56:05,764 --> 00:56:08,364
I am standing strong now.

556
00:56:08,864 --> 00:56:12,648
Here with my memories.

557
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:15,415
Kris. -

558
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:27,419
I met a man, ...
and he loves me so very much.

559
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,614
He's nothing like you, ...

560
00:56:31,714 --> 00:56:34,867
and I love him too.

561
00:56:34,967 --> 00:56:38,139
We're happy. We're one now.

562
00:56:38,391 --> 00:56:42,724
We have a good life.

563
00:56:42,824 --> 00:56:46,364
I'm me now. I'm whole now.

564
00:56:46,964 --> 00:56:55,067
I'm a grown man.

565
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:11,662
Kris, look what you missed.

566
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:13,779
Oh, Kris ...

567
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:18,276
Oh, Kris ...

568
00:57:20,034 --> 00:57:25,518
Oh, Kris ...

569
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:46,355
look at what you missed.

570
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:03,058
Muscle Addiction

571
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,210
Six AM. The sun is gone, ...
and my eyes all droopy. I'm yawnin.

572
00:58:15,245 --> 00:58:17,250
Everybody's looking, ...
all mean and grim.

573
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,255
Why the hell, ...
do I come to the gym?

574
00:58:22,346 --> 00:58:23,710
My eyes say no.

575
00:58:24,253 --> 00:58:25,627
My lips say no.

576
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,564
My head says no.

577
00:58:27,992 --> 00:58:31,419
But Willie says yeah, yeah, ...
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

578
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:34,583
You've gotta be ...
a pumpy junkie boy

579
00:58:34,783 --> 00:58:38,275
if you wanna be a ...
humpy hunky boy.

580
00:58:38,475 --> 00:58:42,483
Then you've gotta be ...
a pumpy junkie boy.

581
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:47,902
if you wanna be ...
a humpy hunky muscleman.

582
00:58:51,468 --> 00:58:53,532
My muscles shake ...
and I'm soaking wet.

583
00:58:53,632 --> 00:58:55,599
And I'm just finishing ...
my first set.

584
00:58:55,634 --> 00:58:59,509
I look in the mirror and feeling some pride, ...
when a big boy comes and stands by my side.

585
00:58:59,544 --> 00:59:01,316
I feel like a stick ...
standing next to him.

586
00:59:01,351 --> 00:59:03,211
Why the hell ...
do I come to the gym?

587
00:59:06,419 --> 00:59:08,125
Biceps say no.

588
00:59:08,225 --> 00:59:09,651
Triceps say no.

589
00:59:10,062 --> 00:59:11,606
My legs say no.

590
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:16,052
But Willie says yeah, yeah, ...
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

591
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,512
You've gotta be ...
a pumpy junkie boy

592
00:59:18,612 --> 00:59:22,617
if you wanna be ...
a humpy hunkie boy.

593
00:59:22,652 --> 00:59:26,546
Then you gotta be ...
a pumpy junkie boy

594
00:59:26,581 --> 00:59:31,327
if you wanna be ...
a humpy hunky muscleman

595
00:59:35,555 --> 00:59:37,792
Run on the treadmill. I'm outta' air.

596
00:59:37,827 --> 00:59:39,613
Run in place and I get nowhere.

597
00:59:39,648 --> 00:59:41,680
Wheezing, panting,
and growing dim.

598
00:59:41,715 --> 00:59:43,529
Why the hell ...
do I come to the gym?

599
00:59:43,564 --> 00:59:44,303
My lungs say no.

600
00:59:44,403 --> 00:59:45,453
My legs say no.

601
00:59:45,553 --> 00:59:46,445
My heart says no.

602
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:51,002
But Willie says yeah.
It's true for you and it's true for me.

603
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:55,448
Gay men got ...
to be fat free.

604
01:00:27,303 --> 01:00:31,896
Arch your back.

605
01:00:32,509 --> 01:00:39,885
Turn. Pose.
Head for the shower.

606
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:45,313
Slowly peel .
your sweaty clothes.

607
01:00:45,348 --> 01:00:49,872
Pout, brood, sulk, scowl.

608
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:54,361
Slip into a skimpy towel.

609
01:00:54,396 --> 01:00:59,642
And as you step beneath ...
the steamy spray.

610
01:00:59,848 --> 01:01:06,526
Pretend you don't notice ...
you're on display.

611
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:10,464
Keep on soaping, ...
groping too.

612
01:01:10,499 --> 01:01:18,056
Because everybody's ...
secretly scoping you.

613
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:28,710
Fire. Steam.
Like a sweaty dream.

614
01:01:28,745 --> 01:01:33,102
The figure shift ...
is straining your eyes.

615
01:01:33,137 --> 01:01:40,492
Feel the tension ...
rise and rise.

616
01:02:26,372 --> 01:02:36,261
Cruisey. Floozy.

617
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:41,479
Who is he?

618
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:56,921
And my arms say Aahh.

619
01:02:59,831 --> 01:03:04,946
And my back says Aahh.

620
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:13,432
And my legs say Aahh.

621
01:03:13,532 --> 01:03:16,420
And Willie?
Willie says:

622
01:03:17,715 --> 01:03:18,970
Hi

623
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,239
Hi.

624
01:03:20,451 --> 01:03:22,256
Later? ...

625
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:24,061
Yeah later.

626
01:03:26,472 --> 01:03:30,754
Romeo and Juliet it ain't.

627
01:03:31,451 --> 01:03:37,985
So, ...
get out of the steam room.

628
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:40,085
Before you faint.

629
01:03:51,402 --> 01:03:56,304
If god made his angels ...
with his muscle grace.

630
01:03:56,339 --> 01:04:00,940
Then Heaven ...

631
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:06,135
must be a hot ...
and sweaty place.

632
01:04:09,578 --> 01:04:11,494
This may sound dumb ...
and this may sound silly.

633
01:04:11,594 --> 01:04:13,575
But I'm pretty sure ...
I'm working out for Willie.

634
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:15,404
Getting big and buff ...
should go.

635
01:04:15,504 --> 01:04:17,145
Does it matter ...
which head is in control?

636
01:04:17,245 --> 01:04:19,213
Who cares ...
if the little heads the one?

637
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:21,029
As long as ...
you get your workout done.

638
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:23,043
Yes, ...
I'm doing it all for him.

639
01:04:23,262 --> 01:04:25,096
Now I know ...
why I go to the gym.

640
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:31,164
And Willie says
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:13,267
The Entertainer.

642
01:05:22,371 --> 01:05:26,705
You come to see my show.

643
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:31,872
Amazed at how ...
I let you know the real me.

644
01:05:31,922 --> 01:05:34,603
You ask yourself "What's this?"

645
01:05:34,653 --> 01:05:39,614
You simply can't ...
resist a mystery.

646
01:05:39,664 --> 01:05:45,466
I open up my heart and soul
in every part

647
01:05:45,516 --> 01:05:50,518
and role
"to be or not to be."

648
01:05:50,568 --> 01:05:56,106
And I hit the perfect stance.

649
01:05:56,146 --> 01:06:00,992
I croon a tune. I do my dance.

650
01:06:01,052 --> 01:06:03,133
You clutch your chest.

651
01:06:03,183 --> 01:06:06,179
Let out a sigh.

652
01:06:06,909 --> 01:06:10,432
May I suggest. There's so much more

653
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:17,874
than meets the eye.

654
01:06:21,508 --> 01:06:23,343
It's all a lie.

655
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:27,519
A filthy lie.

656
01:06:27,569 --> 01:06:32,136
Right now I'm thinking "God I hate this job.
Life sucks. I wanna die"

657
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,788
But I pull through.

658
01:06:33,838 --> 01:06:39,623
It's all for you. I'm the entertainer.

659
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:44,111
Bette's divine.
Barbra's sublime.

660
01:06:44,151 --> 01:06:46,351
'cource when they're inky mopy bitchy

661
01:06:46,371 --> 01:06:48,105
or just out of their fucking minds.

662
01:06:48,135 --> 01:06:50,087
They still deliver.

663
01:06:50,127 --> 01:06:51,870
Like me they're givers.

664
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:56,105
We're entertainers.

665
01:06:56,135 --> 01:06:59,754
Night after night. We do it right.

666
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,875
We're entertainers.

667
01:07:03,488 --> 01:07:07,364
See when I strip the layers off you'll agree.

668
01:07:07,464 --> 01:07:11,106
All I am is just a facsimile.

669
01:07:11,206 --> 01:07:15,166
Of everything I work ...
so very hard to get you to see.

670
01:07:15,206 --> 01:07:18,569
Beneath the makeup and costumes ...
and lights you'd never have guessed.

671
01:07:19,072 --> 01:07:23,918
That I've got aches and pains ...
and fever and congestion in my chest

672
01:07:26,965 --> 01:07:28,972
Chest.

673
01:07:32,026 --> 01:07:33,868
Jerry ...

674
01:07:41,872 --> 01:07:44,734
Thank you

675
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,597
Chest.

676
01:07:48,203 --> 01:07:50,086
It's all a lie.

677
01:07:50,146 --> 01:07:52,272
But I get by.

678
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:54,391
I'll hit the wings,
stare in the mirror,

679
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:56,283
hate myself and start to cry.

680
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:57,843
It's what I do.

681
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,700
So sad but true.

682
01:07:59,714 --> 01:08:03,580
I'm the entertainer ...

683
01:08:03,593 --> 01:08:05,582
Onstage we shine.

684
01:08:05,622 --> 01:08:07,635
Offstage we whine.

685
01:08:07,685 --> 01:08:10,391
We're entertainers.

686
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:12,376
But see you boys.

687
01:08:50,695 --> 01:08:55,464
But when I strip the layers off,
you'll agree.

688
01:08:55,504 --> 01:08:59,245
All I am is just a facsimile.

689
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:02,802
Of everything I work ...
so very hard to get you to see.

690
01:09:02,842 --> 01:09:06,211
Beneath the makeup 'nd costumes ...
'nd lights you'd never have guessed.

691
01:09:06,467 --> 01:09:09,046
That I've got aches 'nd pains
'nd bumps 'nd sprains.

692
01:09:09,086 --> 01:09:11,073
Bruises 'nd scrapes
'nd varicose veins.

693
01:09:11,103 --> 01:09:12,828
Bunions 'nd migraines
'nd sinus 'nd gas.

694
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:14,773
Laryngitis, bronchitis, arthritis, a rash.

695
01:09:14,813 --> 01:09:16,443
Bloated 'nd tired
'nd nauseous 'nd sleepy.

696
01:09:16,483 --> 01:09:18,266
Frustrated, fatigued 'nd
I gotta go pee pee.

697
01:09:18,306 --> 01:09:23,443
I'm lonely, I'm needy,
I'm cranky and I am depressed.

698
01:09:23,503 --> 01:09:24,877
Oh but please.

699
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:26,731
Don't cry for me.

700
01:09:26,771 --> 01:09:29,050
Up here wee thrive and feel alive.

701
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:32,318
It's better than nine to five.

702
01:09:32,516 --> 01:09:36,258
I love it so.
This called show.

703
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:40,312
And though I love to stay folks.
I gotta go.

704
01:09:40,352 --> 01:09:42,897
But we'll be back.

705
01:09:43,824 --> 01:09:47,447
Without a crowd just lay me flat. Splat

706
01:09:47,534 --> 01:09:50,325
I need to see my name ...
on that old marquee.

707
01:09:50,365 --> 01:09:54,884
And stand in front and be some fake ...
yet fabulous version of me.

708
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:57,467
Could we be plainer?

709
01:09:57,507 --> 01:10:05,347
I'm what then if not the entertainer?

710
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:15,051
Oh yeah!

711
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:35,155
Window to window (reprise)

712
01:10:58,175 --> 01:11:00,187
There you are again.

713
01:11:00,751 --> 01:11:03,610
Passing by your window.

714
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:08,950
You look out,
and see me standing here.

715
01:11:11,999 --> 01:11:14,214
And here we are again.

716
01:11:14,743 --> 01:11:17,303
Slowly rising passion.

717
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:22,803
Will this be the night
you beckon me ...

718
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:27,381
to come to you?

719
01:11:27,481 --> 01:11:30,667
Cause if you send for me ...

720
01:11:30,767 --> 01:11:33,451
I will touch you and caress you.

721
01:11:33,551 --> 01:11:36,159
And if you send for me ...

722
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:39,180
I will tell you all the things I dream.

723
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:44,641
I know everything
with you feels so right.

724
01:11:44,741 --> 01:11:53,685
And makes me love
until the morning light.

725
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:56,595
I see the way you want me.

726
01:11:56,630 --> 01:11:59,420
It's the way that I want you.

727
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:05,015
I want you. I want you.

728
01:12:05,016 --> 01:12:09,853
I want you.

729
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:13,743
Please won't you send for me?

730
01:12:13,843 --> 01:12:16,435
We can start our lifetime of caring.

731
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:19,215
Come on send for me.

732
01:12:19,315 --> 01:12:21,868
Take a risk. Be daring.

733
01:12:21,968 --> 01:12:30,243
I know everything for us
will turn out right.

734
01:12:33,473 --> 01:12:34,815
Well then.

735
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:46,555
Until tomorrow night.

736
01:13:25,312 --> 01:13:30,992
I stand before you naked.

737
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:42,505
What's left of me to show?

738
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:48,347
The doors and blinds are shut now.

739
01:13:48,895 --> 01:13:55,711
There's nowhere else to go.

740
01:14:14,335 --> 01:14:19,295
Today I want to learn.

741
01:14:19,495 --> 01:14:24,219
And today I want to love.

742
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:27,810
Today we fit inside each other.

743
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:30,441
And we're holding one another

744
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:35,954
like a hand inside a glove.

745
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:40,627
And today I start to know.

746
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:45,850
What two lovers really mean.

747
01:14:46,503 --> 01:14:50,377
And now I know that who I am

748
01:14:50,477 --> 01:14:55,858
isn't shameful or obscene.

749
01:14:55,893 --> 01:15:02,347
But if what we think is truth.

750
01:15:02,382 --> 01:15:12,107
and honesty our goal

751
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:20,025
Oh then nakedness

752
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:25,716
and nakedness is just ...

753
01:15:25,951 --> 01:15:32,528
another window to the soul.

754
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:36,682
And if you send for me

755
01:15:36,717 --> 01:15:40,543
I will feel and kiss and hold you.

756
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:49,287
And if you send for me ...
I will share my beating heart.

757
01:15:49,387 --> 01:16:00,715
Knowing everything ...
for us will turn out right.

758
01:16:03,266 --> 01:16:06,278
Tonight you'll finally get ...
what you paid for.

759
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:09,360
I'm a perky little porn star
from Skokie Illinois.

760
01:16:09,395 --> 01:16:12,312
I really sort of love my job.
I'm a naked maid.

761
01:16:12,347 --> 01:16:15,230
Tonight
you will see what our bodies are made for.

762
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:17,999
Nothing but the radio on.

763
01:16:18,039 --> 01:16:20,670
Tonight
get ready for something risqué'.

764
01:16:20,679 --> 01:16:23,611
I beat my meat. I beat my meat.
I beat my meat. I beat my meat.

765
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:26,300
Tonight
we throw inhibition away.

766
01:16:26,313 --> 01:16:30,563
Give me Robert Mitchum.
I'm the entertainer.

767
01:16:30,661 --> 01:16:33,306
Tonight
Will Shakespeare's considered a bore.

768
01:16:33,346 --> 01:16:36,105
Tonight
something new and unique is in store.

769
01:16:36,155 --> 01:16:39,800
We love to hear our audience roar.

770
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:41,805
just hear them roar

771
01:16:41,835 --> 01:16:46,717
If you yell and scream
for more you're sure to see.

772
01:16:46,752 --> 01:16:52,160
Oh yes there's sure to be.
Oh yes you're sure to see.

773
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:59,956
Gratuitous, gratuitous, gratuitous,
gratuitous nudity.

774
01:17:00,178 --> 01:17:01,707
Tonight.

775
01:18:34,707 --> 01:18:36,907
Naked Boys Singing

776
01:18:41,443 --> 01:18:44,755
Yelled and scream for more. Well.

777
01:18:44,816 --> 01:18:48,400
Let's give a cheer,
We're naked boys singing.

778
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,625
Marching to the beat of ...
a different drum.

779
01:18:51,725 --> 01:18:54,935
We will shed out clothes
if you shed your inhibitions.

780
01:18:55,035 --> 01:18:58,683
There isn't any plot
but there is an exposition!

781
01:18:58,783 --> 01:19:01,439
Let's give a shout.
Let it all hang out!

782
01:19:01,539 --> 01:19:06,953
We're naked boys ---...

783
01:19:07,103 --> 01:19:08,947
Singing.

784
01:20:00,348 --> 01:20:30,648
