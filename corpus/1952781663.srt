I don't want.

516
00:39:55,244 --> 00:39:59,442
I'm going to the chair fulfilled,
knowing that I killed Superman.

517
00:39:59,615 --> 00:40:01,082
Poisoned him with an overdose...

518
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,151
...of the same solar rays
that give him his powers.

519
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,719
You can't prove any of this.

520
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,412
It's the truth, Kent.

521
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:09,079
My gift to you.

522
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:11,852
He doesn't want the world
to know he's dying, of course.

523
00:40:12,027 --> 00:40:13,289
So break the news gently.

524
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:17,228
A tasteful 140-point headline
should suffice.

525
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:26,365
This is as far as I go.

526
00:40:26,542 --> 00:40:30,444
My lovely niece, Nasthalthia,
will take you the rest of the way.

527
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:31,670
Mr. Kent.

528
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:36,910
She's 18, speaks 30 languages
and aspires to someday rule the world.

529
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,652
I may let her, after I'm done with it.

530
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,725
It's such a waste. You and Superman
could have been friends...

531
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:47,555
...and instead you're going to die.

532
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,960
Ah, but he'll die first.

533
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,276
NASTHALTHIA:
Where to now, Mr. Kent?

534
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,909
CLARK:
Deep space.

535
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,317
Why?

536
00:41:12,488 --> 00:41:13,716
Do you know what this is?

537
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:15,823
It's the bottle city of Kandor.

538
00:41:15,991 --> 00:41:18,858
One of your enemies stole it
from Krypton, before it exploded.

539
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:22,589
Brainiac. He used his technology
to miniaturize the greatest city...

540
00:41:22,765 --> 00:41:23,959
...of my home world.

541
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:27,364
I've been trying to restore
the thousands of people who live there...

542
00:41:27,536 --> 00:41:28,867
...to regular size.

543
00:41:29,038 --> 00:41:30,972
You've found a way.

544
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,539
No.

545
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:35,268
But I have found a suitable planet
for them to colonize.

546
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:36,775
And I'm taking them there.

547
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:40,813
The thing is, it's very far away.

548
00:41:40,983 --> 00:41:42,575
Even under normal circumstances...

549
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:45,515
...it would take me three weeks
to fly there and back.

550
00:41:45,687 --> 00:41:50,021
In my current condition,
it'll take longer than that.

551
00:41:50,192 --> 00:41:52,285
Maybe longer than I have.

552
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:54,228
I don't understand.

553
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,560
It's what I've been keeping from you.

554
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:01,568
I'm dying, Lois.

555
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:13,080
You won't die.
You'll find a way out of this.

556
00:42:13,482 --> 00:42:16,576
We'll be together. Our children
will go flying in Metropolis Park.

557
00:42:16,752 --> 00:42:17,776
Promise me.

558
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,519
We can't have children.
Our biology is too different.

559
00:42:24,693 --> 00:42:27,685
Whatever happens,
we'll never have more than this.

560
00:42:27,863 --> 00:42:29,592
What do you always say?

561
00:42:29,765 --> 00:42:31,665
"There's always a way."

562
00:42:31,834 --> 00:42:33,096
I'm sorry, Lois.

563
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:36,669
The work doesn't stop
just because I'm dying.

564
00:42:41,343 --> 00:42:43,334
Take your people to their new home.

565
00:42:43,512 --> 00:42:46,606
When you get back,
I'll be right here waiting.

566
00:43:24,653 --> 00:43:26,746
Look, up in the sky.

567
00:43:53,248 --> 00:43:55,716
Sorry if I startled you.

568
00:43:56,718 --> 00:44:00,745
It's been a long trip
and I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

569
00:44:18,207 --> 00:44:19,731
What happened to Metropolis?

570
00:44:24,246 --> 00:44:25,907
PERRY:
Great Caesar's ghost.

571
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,948
Kent, where have you been
for the last two months?

572
00:44:29,117 --> 00:44:30,243
I went to your funeral.

573
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,416
I was accidentally buried underneath
Stryker's Island during the prison riot.

574
00:44:34,856 --> 00:44:37,791
Lucky for me, there was
a fully stocked bomb shelter down there.

575
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,487
To make a long story short,
Superman heard me calling for help--

576
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,765
Superman's alive? I knew it.

577
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:46,958
Has he seen this?

578
00:44:57,246 --> 00:44:58,679
Refreshing.

LILO:
And beautiful.

BAR-EL: A fitting spot for the capital
of new Krypton.

581
00:45:03,418 --> 00:45:06,478
I think we could just as easily
clear the apes out of Metropolis...

582
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:08,122
...and build there.

583
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:11,286

Hello there.

- Did you hear something?
- The wind?

586
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:19,524
Bar-El and Lilo. I just read all about you.

587
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:23,063
Astronauts from Krypton
who were lost in space for decades.

588
00:45:23,238 --> 00:45:26,036
It's an honor to meet you,
I'm from Krypton too.

589
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:29,109
We know who you are, Superman.

590
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:31,576
We found Earth
by tracking the warp signature...

591
00:45:31,747 --> 00:45:33,578
...of the vessel that brought you here.

592
00:45:33,749 --> 00:45:36,081
I don't know why you bothered to return.

593
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:38,310
This planet's my home, I was raised here.

594
00:45:38,487 --> 00:45:40,216
But my Kryptonian name is Kal-El.

595
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:42,482
I'm the son of Jor-El.
We're probably related.

596
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:46,321
I remember Jor-El. A weak man.

597
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:48,690
An ineffectual dreamer.

598
00:45:48,864 --> 00:45:51,526
The son follows the father.

599
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:54,895
You could have built a new Krypton
in this squalor.

600
00:45:55,437 --> 00:45:58,998
I don't have any right
to impose my will over--

601
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:11,582
You just moved into my fortress?

602
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:14,022
LILO:
Shouldn't have left the key lying around.

603
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,384
BAR-EL:
We had every right.

604
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:19,420
The powers that we gain
from this world's yellow sun.

605
00:46:19,594 --> 00:46:22,859
The superiority
of our Kryptonian culture.

00:46:23,332 --> 00:46:28,497
LILO: You were remiss not taking
similar liberties with the rest of the planet.

607
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:36,369
You tore down the statue of my parents.

608
00:46:36,745 --> 00:46:40,181
We celebrate the life of Krypton,
not her death.

609
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:43,045
This whole place reeks of morbidity.

610
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:53,627
Even Krypton's criminally insane,
forever trapped in the Phantom Zone...

611
00:46:53,795 --> 00:46:57,458
...evidence more nobility
than the best of the human apes.

612
00:46:57,632 --> 00:46:59,293
You should be ashamed.

613
00:47:00,335 --> 00:47:03,202
I was thinking maybe
you could replace me after I'm gone...

614
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:07,769
...but you don't have the best interests
of this planet's people at heart.

615
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:11,003
And this is you
puffing up your chest at me, is it?

616
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:12,737
You've gone native.

617
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,404
It's disgusting.

I think you looked better in the dress.

00:48:06,668 --> 00:48:09,330
I didn't realize Kryptonian fashion
was so popular.

Kryptonian everything.
It's a new world, Mr. Kent.

That's gotta be a little embarrassing.

630
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:44,203
So this is where Superman hides.

00:48:44,372 --> 00:48:46,135
It's worse than I'd thought.

632
00:48:46,308 --> 00:48:48,367
You choose to disguise your greatness...

Have you no dignity?

635
00:48:54,149 --> 00:48:56,811
I'm loaded with dignity.

636
00:48:57,252 --> 00:48:59,083
I can see how you'd make the mistake...

637
00:48:59,254 --> 00:49:02,621

I'm not Superman.

You said you retraced the path

That means you passed through
Krypton's debris field.

The minerals in your bodies
have been slowly turning to Kryptonite.

Einstein couldn't connect
the gravitational force to the other three...

860
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:10,577
...but if he could have seen this....

861
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:13,444
It's so obvious.

862
01:07:13,614 --> 01:07:15,081
Uncle Lex?

863
01:07:15,249 --> 01:07:17,979
The fundamental forces
are yoked by consciousness.

864
01:07:18,152 --> 01:07:20,245
Everything's connected.

865
01:07:20,421 --> 01:07:22,912
Everyone.

866
01:07:23,157 --> 01:07:26,854
And this is how he sees things
all the time.

867
01:07:27,027 --> 01:07:28,619
Every day.

868
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:31,856
I don't know
if I should be worried or mortified.

869
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,233
It's a cruel joke.

870
01:07:34,401 --> 01:07:36,494
The mechanistic clockwork of reality...

871
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:42,108
...hinging on a precious
impossible defiance of entropy, on life.

872
01:07:42,276 --> 01:07:43,937
And the clockwork doesn't care.

873
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:48,673
It's like-- Like it's all just us,
in here together.

874
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,174
We're all we've got.

875
01:07:51,919 --> 01:07:54,114
You are embarrassing me
beyond therapy.

876
01:07:54,288 --> 01:07:56,552
SUPERMAN:
You'll have to forgive him, Nasthalthia.

877
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,489
He just figured out
how everything works.

878
01:08:00,361 --> 01:08:02,625
Gravity warps time.

879
01:08:02,796 --> 01:08:05,663
Superman trapped me
in a relativistic conundrum.

880
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:12,164
He's trying to say his 24 hours
of super-powers just ran out.

881
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:14,273
But it's only been a couple of hours.

882
01:08:14,441 --> 01:08:15,874
Relative to us.

883
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:18,637
The gravity gun sped up his clock a little.

884
01:08:18,812 --> 01:08:21,406
You think I didn't make more of the--?

885
01:08:21,582 --> 01:08:23,812
Looking for this?

886
01:08:24,852 --> 01:08:27,377
Give it back. I saw everything.

887
01:08:27,554 --> 01:08:29,317
I saw how to save the world.

888
01:08:34,962 --> 01:08:36,725
I could have made everyone see.

889
01:08:37,898 --> 01:08:41,459
If it wasn't for you,
I could have saved the world.

890
01:08:42,403 --> 01:08:44,428
If it had mattered to you, Luthor...

891
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:47,435
...you could have saved the world
years ago.

892
01:08:49,576 --> 01:08:50,873
You're right.

893
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,952
Oh, your poor face.

894
01:09:02,589 --> 01:09:05,114
No one can repair the sun but me, Lois.

895
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:08,421
I'm turning into pure energy...

896
01:09:11,832 --> 01:09:15,563
...and I only have one chance
to save the world.

897
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,629
That's all you've ever needed.

898
01:09:20,107 --> 01:09:22,075
I love you, Lois Lane...

899
01:09:22,943 --> 01:09:25,036
...until the end of time.

900
01:10:54,401 --> 01:10:57,097
Are you sure you don't wanna speak
at the memorial service?

901
01:10:57,271 --> 01:10:59,967
Thousands of people are there
paying their respects.

902
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,607
He's not dead.

903
01:11:01,775 --> 01:11:03,800
He's up there fixing the sun.

904
01:11:03,977 --> 01:11:06,571
And when he's done, he'll be back.

905
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:10,074
And I'll be here waiting for him.

906
01:11:18,425 --> 01:11:20,290
Doomed planet.

907
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,758
Desperate scientists.

908
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:24,557
Last hope.

909
01:11:24,731 --> 01:11:26,699
Kindly couple.

910
01:11:26,867 --> 01:11:28,095
Superman.

911
01:11:28,735 --> 01:11:30,635
QUINTUM:
We all know the story, Luthor.

912
01:11:30,804 --> 01:11:32,533
Why did you ask to see me?

913
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,507
If this is an escape attempt--

914
01:11:34,675 --> 01:11:36,609
I'd already be free.

915
01:11:36,777 --> 01:11:40,508
No, I've already accepted
my imminent execution.

916
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:43,513
This is a confession.

917
01:11:43,684 --> 01:11:47,085
Forgive me, doctor, for I have sinned.

918
01:11:48,188 --> 01:11:49,678
A lot.

919
01:11:50,991 --> 01:11:52,515
You killed him.

920
01:11:52,693 --> 01:11:57,756
And my deathbed claims that I've seen
the error of my ways can't change that.

921
01:11:57,931 --> 01:12:01,196
But there is one thing that I can do
to honor his memory.

922
01:12:11,945 --> 01:12:17,645
QUINTUM:
"A-A-C-C-A-T-T-A"....

923
01:12:18,352 --> 01:12:22,584
- Is that--?
- A map of Superman's genetic code.

924
01:12:23,223 --> 01:12:26,454
I reverse-engineered it
from his 24-hour super-serum.

925
01:12:26,627 --> 01:12:29,755
I also finally figured out
how to replicate it.

926
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:31,261
No.

927
01:12:31,431 --> 01:12:35,765
Of course, it will require an ovum
from a healthy human woman.

928
01:13:00,727 --> 01:13:03,628
They always said they wanted children.

929
01:13:10,871 --> 01:13:12,964
LOIS:
He's not dead.

930
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:16,003
He's up there fixing the sun.

931
01:13:17,044 --> 01:13:20,036
And when he's done, he'll be back.
