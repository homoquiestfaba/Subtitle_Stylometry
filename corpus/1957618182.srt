1
00:00:01,105 --> 00:00:04,022
(thunder rumbling)

2
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:15,611
(dramatic music)

3
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:38,437
(bell tolling)

4
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:41,354
(thunder rumbling)

5
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:45,312
(dramatic music)

6
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:46,721
(screaming)

7
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:52,405
(dramatic music)

8
00:01:54,852 --> 00:01:57,185
(screaming)

9
00:02:01,645 --> 00:02:04,395
(dramatic music)

10
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,177
(flames crackling)

11
00:03:13,783 --> 00:03:16,533
(dramatic music)

12
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:16,583
(thunder rumbling)

13
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,967
(soft music)

14
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:34,330
(bell tolling)

15
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:39,810
(choir singing in foreign language)

16
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,253
- Excuse me.

17
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,010
- Oh, shit, man.

18
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,320
- You speak English?

19
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,530
- Yeah, sure, most of the kids here do.

20
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,998
Didn't you know?

21
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:29,930
This is a place where
rich Americans abroad

22
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,420
dump their troublemaking kids.

23
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,820
How many schools you been kicked out of?

24
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,200
- None, actually.

25
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,700
- Hmm, parents get divorced,
sort of an odd man out then?

26
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,680
- No.

27
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,050
- You musta done something wrong,

28
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,580
because nobody ever came
here for a good reason.

29
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,600
- So what did you do then, huh?

30
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,800
- Well I used to experiment
with various states

31
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,390
of expanded consciousness,
when I wasn't get stoned.

32
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,990
- And you don't to it anymore?

33
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,540
- Not in this municipality.

34
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,010
See, their approach to the subject

35
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,350
of recreational chemistry
is downright medieval.

36
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:01,363
So I stick to the tried and true.

37
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,950
Ah, better living through chemistry.

38
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,490
Jacob Fine, how are you, you want a slug?

39
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,410
- Elias Storm, man, no thanks.

40
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,030
- Come on, I'll introduce you around.

41
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,960
I know this place looks
picturesquely desolate.

42
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,887
But if you look close,
it's just ... seedy.

43
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:21,910
(chuckling)

44
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,310
Almost everybody's gone, of course,

45
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,730
you know, for the winter break.

46
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,790
Only we hard-core unloved remain.

47
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,530
Of course, that includes
our local human anachronism,

48
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,110
Dr. Jarod, he of the shiny
jacket and poor hygiene,

49
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,190
teacher of theology, and
our dear headmistress,

50
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,400
Miss Greynitz, or as we like to call her,

51
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,500
the Daughter of Satan.

52
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,224
- Who's that?

53
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:47,130
- Oh, that's Lilia.

54
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,853
In a world of forbidden fruit,
she's what I call a peach.

55
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,080
She's also Miss Greynitz's
daughter, come on.

56
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,090
- Hey there, how's it going, Jakey?

57
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,570
- Oh, hi.

58
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,560
Elias, this is Burke and
Grimes, Colby, Willis.

59
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,710
Elias is new.

60
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,127
(soft music)

61
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,920
- Welcome to the school.

62
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,215
(soft music)

63
00:07:18,006 --> 00:07:19,480
- Okay, okay, man, you win.

64
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,930
- Win what?

65
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,260
Come on, you can squeeze harder than that.

66
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,460
Show me what you've got.

67
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,330
Now you wanna fight me, is that it?

68
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,213
Huh, is that it?

69
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:31,840
I don't think it would
be too fair, do you?

70
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,010
You can't even shake my hand.

71
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,460
- What am I supposed to do, cry uncle?

72
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,240
- I don't know. Do whatever you want.

73
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,900
- Okay.

74
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,770
- Ow, ooh.

75
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,560
You wanna bite my finger?

76
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
That's playing a little
dirty. I can play dirty too.

77
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,810
Maybe when you're not expecting it.

78
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:47,789
- Maybe.

79
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:48,622
- Maybe.

80
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,513
That's right.

81
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,930
(soft music)

82
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,630
(thunder rumbling)

83
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,850
- Europe had Hitler. We have Burke.

84
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,530
Those others are kinda like
those other axis countries

85
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,390
or something like that, I don't know.

86
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,350
Personally, I advise sort
of a Switzerland approach.

87
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,620
You have to be careful with
those guys, especially Burke.

88
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,730
- So I gather.

89
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,850
- I don't mean just
because he's an asshole.

90
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,050
He's also Miss Greynitz's watchdog.

91
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,670
Us poor mortals get locked in at night.

92
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,503
He has the run of the place,

93
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:22,440
sort of like her own
personal stormtrooper.

94
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,200
- We get locked in at night?

95
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,520
- Like I said, you musta
done something wrong,

96
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,820
else you wouldn't be here.

97
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,650
- Why do you always do that?

98
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:36,590
I don't bite ... unlike the new kid.

99
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,700
You see, I was just wondering.

100
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,080
We were going into town.

101
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,580
I just was wondering if you
wanted me to get you anything.

102
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,493
- No thank you.

103
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,090
- Come on, we have to
report to Frau Greynitz.

104
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,450
- I knew I could get her to talk.

105
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,110
- [Greynitz] Why are you here?

106
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,980
- [Elias] I'm sorry.

107
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,230
- I assume by now you realize
that our little school,

108
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,530
it's a kind of dumping ground.

109
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,260
Forgive my bluntness.

110
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,750
But now we have you,
an orphan of some kind.

111
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,780
A trust fund of some kind.

112
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,717
Nothing that tells me why
you have been sent here.

113
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:15,643
- Well I really couldn't tell you why.

114
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:16,476
- I see.

115
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,760
A mystery.

116
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,963
Well, we shall certainly
solve you in no time at all.

117
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,590
We are not at all modern here.

118
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,470
I will not tolerate any
disobedience, insolence

119
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,570
or improper behavior.

120
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,063
This school is also my home.

121
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,083
Locked rooms are to be
left strictly alone.

122
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,560
Meal time are posted.

123
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,420
I trust you ate in Brevik,

124
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,900
as dinner, it's over for this evening.

125
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,733
- Well actually, I was--

126
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:49,553
- And curfew is at nine o'clock.

127
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,103
Classes will begin three
days after the new year.

128
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,500
You have seen my daughter?

129
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,680
- Yes, Miss Greynitz.

130
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,580
- She's an innocent young girl.

131
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,160
You will leave her alone.

132
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,663
You are not to speak to her at any time.

133
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,369
Good day, Mr. Storm.

134
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:10,860
(bell tolling)

135
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,500
(choir singing in foreign language)

136
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,333
- Excuse me.

137
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,140
Is it true we're locked
in our rooms at night?

138
00:10:20,055 --> 00:10:20,960
- Yeah.

139
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,250
- Well, what if there's a fire or?

140
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,073
- We must trust to God
that there isn't one.

141
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,250
- One more question.

142
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,260
When do you turn the heat on around here?

143
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:40,138
(thunder rumbling)

144
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,669
(owl hooting)

145
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:46,836
(soft dramatic music)

146
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:56,248
(fire crackling)

147
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:59,101
(thunder rumbling)

148
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,000
- On the other hand, if
I was my uncle Steffi

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,210
and I wanted some ne'er-do-well
American relatives

150
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,450
to carry out my postmortem wishes,

151
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,223
I would certainly take steps
to see that they were honored.

152
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,040
For all we know, there
could be a Russian-made

153
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,653
video camera hidden inside
one of these tombstones.

154
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,750
Ah, here we go.

155
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,603
Here's dear Uncle Steffi.

156
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:29,370
- Do you know what that means?

157
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,360
- No, but somehow I
doubt it's a compliment.

158
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,193
Shall we?

159
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,026
- Yeah.

160
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:37,580
(thunder rumbling)

161
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,413
Here.

162
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,593
- Three feet, seven inches.

163
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,693
Trowel?

164
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,724
(thunder rumbling)

165
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,689
- What if it isn't there?

166
00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:54,189
- [Father] Got it.

167
00:12:00,993 --> 00:12:02,243
- Ugh, ugly little thing.

168
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,500
- [Father] Give me the hair.

169
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,333
- Right here.

170
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,283
- Now all that magical junk.

171
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,863
- Some cannabis leaves.

172
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:20,430
Salt.

173
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,263
Sulfur.

174
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:28,560
Ah, blood of a virgin.

175
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,610
Age three months, sex female.

176
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,287
I think the virginity in
this case is a good bet.

177
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,742
(thunder cracking)

178
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:40,492
And, that's about it.

179
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,610
- Right, you hold the talisman,

180
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,073
and I'll say the secret word.

181
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,547
- You're scared, aren't you?

182
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:50,380
- No.

183
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,770
- Yes, you are.

184
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,677
I'm not.

185
00:12:52,677 --> 00:12:55,594
(mysterious music)

186
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:57,980
(gasping)

187
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,400
- What, what is it?

188
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,614
What is it?

189
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,270
(crickets chirping)

190
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,150
- Nothing.

191
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,743
Sorry, I just had a nightmare.

192
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,260
- Wait, let me guess.

193
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,167
You went to sleep, you
dreamt you were here

194
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:11,720
and you woke up screaming?

195
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,553
- Huh.

196
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:14,300
- [Jacob] You're not gonna be doing

197
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,210
that every night, are you?

198
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:16,923
- No.

199
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:18,010
- Good.

200
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,490
We had a screamer here a
couple of semesters ago.

201
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,350
He used up the goodwill
around here mighty fast.

202
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,130
Finally, Miss Greynitz moved
him to the other dorm, Burke's.

203
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,310
You don't wanna be there,

204
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:31,480
not unless you enjoy being
tied up in a sheet and beaten.

205
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,313
He does that.

206
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,050
- Don't worry about it.

207
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,450
- Just giving you the
benefit of my wisdom, Son.

208
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,273
What's the matter?

209
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:43,940
Didn't you believe me when I
told you the doors are locked?

210
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,350
- [Elias] Going for a walk.

211
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,400
- Oh, and how do you plan to manage that?

212
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,883
- Skeleton key.

213
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,330
Wanna come along?

214
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,510
- [Jacob] Hell no, wait.

215
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,553
- Suit yourself.

216
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,140
- You know, somehow I have a feeling

217
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,680
this is more than just restlessness.

218
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,180
- You really wanna know?

219
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,260
- Good point, good point.

220
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,750
Listen, Miss Greynitz
and Lilia live up on two.

221
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,070
Now those are their private digs,

222
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,520
so don't go trying any doors up there.

223
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,120
Dr. Jarod's room is down
by the back storage closet.

224
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,740
- Thanks.

225
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,230
- And watch out for Burke.

226
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,180
Sometimes he likes to go for walks too.

227
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,003
(soft mysterious music)

228
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:51,024
- Again.

229
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,357
(soft mysterious music)

230
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:56,136
Again.

231
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:03,889
Again.

232
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:04,758
Again.

233
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:08,091
(soft mysterious music)

234
00:15:09,147 --> 00:15:09,980
Again.

235
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,184
Come on.

236
00:15:13,184 --> 00:15:14,334
Come on, Grimes, again.

237
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,290
Hey, what's the matter, are you a girl?

238
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,123
Is that it?

239
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:18,956
- No.

240
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:21,420
- Come on, another one.

241
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,350
Again.

242
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,639
(soft mysterious music)

243
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,639
(crickets chirping)

244
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,163
Boy, that was pretty bad.

245
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,773
Come on, get up.

246
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,455
Get up.

247
00:15:40,455 --> 00:15:44,050
(soft mysterious music)

248
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,930
Just sit here and relax,

249
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,030
so I can tell how delicate you really are.

250
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,901
Now count, if it doesn't
take too much work.

251
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:52,861
- Yeah, yeah.

252
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:56,866
(soft mysterious music)

253
00:15:56,866 --> 00:15:58,199
One, two, three.

254
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,533
- To yourself, count to yourself.

255
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,180
Your problem is ... you don't
have enough imagination.

256
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,057
You just gotta picture
little Lilia underneath you,

257
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:13,710
and you can do this all night long.

258
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:15,533
Ah.

259
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:18,999
(soft mysterious music)

260
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:21,169
(groaning)

261
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:24,502
(soft mysterious music)

262
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:32,813
(dramatic music)

263
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,200
- Oh.

264
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were in here.

265
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,990
- [Lilia] Nightmare?

266
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,823
- Excuse me?

267
00:16:50,823 --> 00:16:54,850
- I was just wondering why
you were up, wandering around.

268
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,350
I sometimes have nightmares, and

269
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,320
I go walking.

270
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,730
I thought maybe you'd had a nightmare.

271
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,410
- No, actually I-

272
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,000
Well actually I did have a nightmare, but

273
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,510
I was just curious.

274
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,260
You know, it's all new to me and I-

275
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,605
I'm Elias St-

276
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:13,808
(crickets chirping)

277
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:15,273
- Are you going to hurt me?

278
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,140
- I don't understand.
Why would I hurt you?

279
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,140
- That's, that's what boys
do to girls, isn't it?

280
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,533
- No.

281
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,450
Look,

282
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,283
I'm just.

283
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,853
I'm sitting down, see?

284
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,303
I don't wanna hurt you.

285
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:37,903
- What was your nightmare about?

286
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,893
- Um,

287
00:17:41,832 --> 00:17:43,153
just my sister.

288
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,733
- What happens to your
sister in the dream?

289
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:52,420
- I can't remember.

290
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,070
- Maybe it's a warning.

291
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,320
Where is your sister now?

292
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:57,014
- Dead.

293
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,330
How about you? Do you have
any brothers or sisters?

294
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,280
- Should I tell you about my nightmare?

295
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,630
- If you want.

296
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,020
- It's about God.

297
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,000
- [Elias] You had a nightmare about God?

298
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,030
- Yes.

299
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,730
I heard somebody say, or maybe I read it,

300
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,297
that steeples of churches
are the teeth of God.

301
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,550
In my dream, I can see
God like a huge mouth

302
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,033
full of teeth like steeples.

303
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,033
And out of the mouth of
God, I can hear screaming.

304
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,181
But it's not God
screaming, you understand?

305
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,014
- No.

306
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,614
- It's the voices of the damned.

307
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:41,433
And they're calling out
for me to set them free.

308
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,600
But to do this, I have
to go into the mouth.

309
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,883
- So what do you do?

310
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:51,150
- I woke up. Do you think it's fair?

311
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,600
- [Elias] What, that you woke up?

312
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,760
- No.

313
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,880
Some people end up in hell for something

314
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,233
that only takes one second.

315
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,290
Even the worst person
doesn't sin all the time,

316
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,350
so why should the
punishment go on forever?

317
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,220
- I suppose you only get one life,

318
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,530
and if you use it right, that's heaven.

319
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,803
If you use it wrong, that's hell.

320
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,510
And it goes on forever because
you only had one chance.

321
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,343
- Really?

322
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,173
That sounds really simple.

323
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,580
Do you think that life is that easy?

324
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,713
You think it's always that
easy to do the right thing?

325
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,461
- So tell me, is your father still-

326
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:37,990
(door banging)

327
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,933
- It's my mother.

328
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,310
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

329
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,090
I wasn't here just because of the dream.

330
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,940
I was hiding.

331
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,150
- Hiding, why?

332
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,853
- Sometimes my mother has
me do things late at night.

333
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,880
- What things?

334
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,782
- Sh.

335
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:59,100
(soft dramatic music)

336
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,573
- Oh, there you are.

337
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,150
I was looking all over for you.

338
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,193
- I'm sorry.

339
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,820
- Well, do you want to go now?

340
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,870
- Of course, I'll go.

341
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,933
I know what I have to do.

342
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:16,266
(soft mysterious music)

343
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,040
(thunder rumbling)

344
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,410
- Only frigging train of the day,

345
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,860
and it leaves at 7:30 in the morning.

346
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,760
- Oh, you're just breaking my heart.

347
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,920
Having to drag your own asses
to some warm little beach

348
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,681
full of topless French bitches.

349
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:46,430
- Yeah, it's hell, but
somebody's gotta do it.

350
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:47,700
- I'll see you guys next semes--

351
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,353
- Get away from me with that thing.

352
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,330
- I'm gonna miss having
a couple of pussies

353
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,330
like you two around.

354
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:57,874
- I hate that son of a bitch.

355
00:20:57,874 --> 00:20:58,860
(Lilia moaning)

356
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,440
Whoa, what is that?

357
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:04,116
(Lilia moaning)

358
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:12,579
(door creaking)

359
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:15,214
(Lilia moaning)

360
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:18,547
(soft mysterious music)

361
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:46,594
(hissing)

362
00:21:48,402 --> 00:21:51,152
(dramatic music)

363
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:25,859
(screaming)

364
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:36,177
(dramatic music)

365
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,606
(screaming)

366
00:22:40,744 --> 00:22:43,494
(dramatic music)

367
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,056
(flames crackling)

368
00:22:52,056 --> 00:22:54,806
(dramatic music)

369
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,050
- [Jacob] I need to get out more.

370
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,820
This place is happening after curfew.

371
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,923
- You don't believe me?

372
00:23:05,923 --> 00:23:06,756
- I didn't say that.

373
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:08,560
I mean I did think it,
but I didn't say it.

374
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,470
- Come on.

375
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,700
- Hey, now you know, if you're late

376
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,220
for breakfast, they don't feed you.

377
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,670
And it's not like they're all that anxious

378
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,160
to feed you around here
in the first place.

379
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,043
- Yeah, it'll only take a second.

380
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,330
- Look, not that I'm
suggesting that you can't tell

381
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,720
the difference between
a dream and reality,

382
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,560
but maybe you just fell
asleep out here somewhere

383
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,500
and sorta, and now you can't tell

384
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,370
the difference between
a dream and reality.

385
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,870
- You ever wash blackboards
when you were a kid?

386
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,600
- No, I missed out on that.

387
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,760
- Well something I noticed.

388
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,407
When you wet down a backboard,

389
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,930
even after it's already been erased,

390
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,200
the last thing that was on it,

391
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,860
sort of, kind of, reappears.

392
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,350
- Well you learn something new every day.

393
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,680
(thunder rumbling)

394
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,513
My God, a wet blackboard.

395
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:57,273
- Wait'll it starts to dry.

396
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:02,075
(thunder rumbling)

397
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:05,242
(soft dramatic music)

398
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,953
- Right that's, what?

399
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:17,120
(soft dramatic music)

400
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:22,791
- What is it?

401
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,093
Do you know?

402
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:28,493
- Come on. You're only dreaming.

403
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:30,837
- I'm following.

404
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,193
Dig in, it's simple fare, but well.

405
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,213
Actually, it's loathsome,
but what are you gonna do?

406
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,903
Like I said, the hard-core unloved.

407
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:53,483
- Where are?

408
00:24:54,338 --> 00:24:57,530
- Willis and Colby? They
took off to the Riviera

409
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,650
someplace till the new semester starts.

410
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,010
You know, some fun in the
sun before coming back

411
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,420
to some mold in the cold.

412
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,820
No great loss, believe me.

413
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,653
(boys chattering)

414
00:25:38,896 --> 00:25:42,063
(soft dramatic music)

415
00:25:47,928 --> 00:25:48,761
- Stop it.

416
00:25:51,253 --> 00:25:52,610
- I was just sitting at the table.

417
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,510
- Did I ask you to explain, Mr. Burke?

418
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,550
- No, Miss Greynitz.

419
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,810
- Do you think that I do not know

420
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,003
what goes on under my roof?

421
00:26:01,003 --> 00:26:03,913
Can you be so stupid as to
think that for one second?

422
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
- No, Miss Greynitz, I was just sitting--

423
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,123
- I know what you did.

424
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,670
I know what everybody does under my roof.

425
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,570
So you see, I have no
interest in your lies.

426
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,933
Mr. Burke, do you hear me?

427
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,983
Do you understand me?

428
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,423
- Yes, Miss Greynitz.

429
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,900
- Since the food is to be wasted,

430
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,760
you are done with meals for today.

431
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,960
You will remain in your
room until after dinner.

432
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,770
When the dinner period's over,

433
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,650
and the rest of us have eaten,

434
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,373
you will come into my office.

435
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,153
Get out.

436
00:26:39,153 --> 00:26:42,294
(soft dramatic music)

437
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:02,093
- That was about the
damnedest thing I ever saw.

438
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:03,370
I don't even know if I
wanna sit next to you.

439
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,920
You're kinda scary.

440
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,210
- I don't like bullies.

441
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,888
- [Jacob] Who does?

442
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:10,721
(boys chattering)

443
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,540
- Excuse me, I'm gonna
go talk to Dr. Jarod.

444
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,940
- Talk about insult.

445
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,220
Was it something I said?

446
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,710
- It's business.

447
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,955
See you later.

448
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:22,122
(soft dramatic music)

449
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:28,480
Dr. Jarod, I'm Elias Storm.

450
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,590
- So I gather.

451
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,128
- May I sit down?

452
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:34,295
(soft dramatic music)

453
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,743
I know you're a doctor of theology.

454
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,509
I was wondering if you, um,
might know what that was.

455
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:51,676
(soft dramatic music)

456
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:55,850
I was also wondering if
you'd heard of a relative

457
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,093
of mine, a late uncle.

458
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:00,930
- I know many late uncles.

459
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,490
- His name was Sturma, Steffon Sturma.

460
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,623
- Your uncle was Steffon Sturma?

461
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,623
- He's a great uncle actually.

462
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,663
- Yes, of course I've heard of him.

463
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,153
He's well known in some circles.

464
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,273
He was insane.

465
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,910
- Why do you think he was insane?

466
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,870
- Well, when a man seeks to
invoke the Angel of Darkness

467
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,150
and bring about the end of the world,

468
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,870
and when in rituals
include blood sacrifices

469
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,410
and unspeakable atrocities,

470
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,593
what would you call that if not insane?

471
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,960
- So this,

472
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,460
this is the Angel of Darkness?

473
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,440
- Are you playing games
with me, young man?

474
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,660
- I don't understand.

475
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,850
- They don't put this symbol on the backs

476
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,750
of the playing cards or show it on TV.

477
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,660
So how could you have come by it

478
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,380
without knowing what it was?

479
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,373
Especially considering
your exalted late uncle.

480
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:01,500
- I saw it on one of the blackboards

481
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,930
in one of the classrooms.

482
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,370
It's not there anymore, but
I was just wondering if--

483
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:09,660
- Indeed, maybe you know no
more than your questions imply.

484
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,130
And maybe your presence
here is a perfectly

485
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,503
innocent coincidence.

486
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,690
Maybe.

487
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:21,120
Of course, I do not
believe in coincidences.

488
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,073
And maybe I should trust
you, Mr. Storm, maybe.

489
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,350
But then again, maybe not.

490
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,517
(soft dramatic music)

491
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:35,468
Now, I'm finished with my breakfast.

492
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,825
Good day to you, Mr. Storm.

493
00:29:38,825 --> 00:29:41,575
(dramatic music)

494
00:29:48,362 --> 00:29:50,997
(birds singing)

495
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:54,164
(soft dramatic music)

496
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,159
(thunder cracking)

497
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,909
(dramatic music)

498
00:31:20,577 --> 00:31:23,425
(thunder cracking)

499
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:26,175
(dramatic music)

500
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:30,314
(thunder cracking)

501
00:31:30,314 --> 00:31:33,334
(dramatic music)

502
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:36,156
(thunder cracking)

503
00:31:36,156 --> 00:31:38,906
(dramatic music)

504
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,421
(thunder cracking)

505
00:32:06,421 --> 00:32:07,692
- He sees us!

506
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:10,859
(soft dramatic music)

507
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:17,892
(thunder cracking)

508
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:21,059
(soft dramatic music)

509
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,407
(birds singing)

510
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:37,771
(knocking on door)

511
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:39,354
- [Greynitz] Enter.

512
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
- Miss Greynitz?

513
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,409
- Mr. Burke, come in.

514
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:47,576
(soft dramatic music)

515
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,943
Sit.

516
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,783
Sit down.

517
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:56,313
Have you been thinking today, Mr. Burke?

518
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:59,100
- Yes I have, Miss Greynitz.

519
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,793
- Thinking about what, this?

520
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,960
After a whole 12 hours with nothing to eat

521
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,333
and no prospect of
anything for another 12,

522
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,983
you must be feel yourself terribly ill.

523
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,073
- No, Miss Greynitz.

524
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,620
- You'd like something to eat?

525
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,710
- I guess that's up to you, Miss Greynitz.

526
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,980
- You guess?

527
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Three years here with me,
and you still say I guess.

528
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,413
What a disappointment you are, Mr. Burke.

529
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,060
- I'm sorry about what happened
at breakfast, Miss Greynitz.

530
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,450
It won't happen again.

531
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,963
- Well then, we will
speak no more about it.

532
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,113
Please, go ahead.

533
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,550
Justice must be tempered with mercy.

534
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,383
Go on.

535
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,160
I brought you here to
tell you that I'm going

536
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,960
to be away from the school
until tomorrow morning.

537
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,890
- [Burke] Away?

538
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:00,113
- Yes, I know it is
unusual, but it does happen.

539
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,853
On occasion.

540
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,010
Dr. Jarod is, of course, useless.

541
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,873
Therefore, I look to you
to maintain order here.

542
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,880
- Yes, Miss Greynitz.

543
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,430
- I know that your
capabilities are limited,

544
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,573
but I suspect this won't strain them.

545
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,610
You are a very lucky young man.

546
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,680
You know that, don't you?

547
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,670
- Yes, Miss Greynitz.

548
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,063
- And do you know why you're lucky?

549
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,370
Because you're the worthless
son of a wealthy family,

550
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,740
and if one is going to be worthless,

551
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,763
it is always a good idea to be wealthy.

552
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,963
That will be all.

553
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,913
Leave it.

554
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:50,749
Good night, Mr. Burke.

555
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,290
- Good night, Miss Greynitz.

556
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:02,975
(soft music)

557
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,304
- Oh, hello there.

558
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:16,137
- Hello.

559
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,203
Don't worry, we can talk.

560
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,460
We'll hear if anybody comes.

561
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,000
- Did you get in trouble,
with your mother?

562
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,833
- A little.

563
00:35:26,984 --> 00:35:28,613
You were lucky at breakfast.

564
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,783
- I didn't feel lucky.

565
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,940
So, uh?

566
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,148
- So?

567
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:37,565
(soft music)

568
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:41,623
- Have you always lived
here with your mother?

569
00:35:41,623 --> 00:35:44,120
- No, I was born in New York,

570
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,830
and then we went to Paris when I was two.

571
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,973
And then we came here, around eight years.

572
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,120
I meant you were lucky because my mother

573
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,390
decided to go after Burke.

574
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,020
If she'd screamed at you,
too, it wouldn't have been

575
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,970
so bad for him, that's the
only reason she didn't.

576
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,320
- Your mother is--

577
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,073
- I'd just as soon not
talk about my mother.

578
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,010
If you don't mind?

579
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:09,843
- Sure.

580
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,430
Can I ask you a question?

581
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,860
- You just did.

582
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,693
- Okay.

583
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:24,163
When were you born?

584
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,700
- Why?

585
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,517
- I was wondering what sign you are.

586
00:36:29,517 --> 00:36:30,390
- My sign?

587
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,520
- Yeah, you know, astrology.

588
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,773
- Astrology, all right.

589
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,203
I was born on September 23rd, 1982.

590
00:36:39,112 --> 00:36:40,410
- Oh.

591
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,120
- You seem disappointed.

592
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,930
Does that mean there's
something wrong with me?

593
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,339
- No.

594
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:46,880
- What sign is it anyway?

595
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,813
- Oh, um, Pisces, I think.

596
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,590
- So is there anything else
you'd like to know about me?

597
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,420
- Sure, um,

598
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,540
what about your father, is he, um?

599
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,373
- He's dead.

600
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,890
Like your sister.

601
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:02,723
- I'm sorry.

602
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,283
- Now can I ask you questions?

603
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,153
- Go ahead.

604
00:37:08,153 --> 00:37:10,350
- It's really just one question.

605
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,490
My mother thinks that
you're a bit of a mystery.

606
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,323
- I know.

607
00:37:14,323 --> 00:37:15,890
- Do you know why?

608
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,700
Because she checked you out
and found out that you came

609
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,440
into control of your trust
fund at the age of 18.

610
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,320
And you're 18 now.

611
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,690
That means that you came here on your own.

612
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,123
She can't figure out why.

613
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:35,130
- I was ... in an uncomfortable situation.

614
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,663
And I ... needed to get
as far away as possible.

615
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,040
Someplace no one had ever heard of.

616
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,873
That's all.

617
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:46,003
- Oh, so you're just
hiding out, is that it?

618
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,040
- Something like that.

619
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,940
- You should practice more.
You're not a very good liar.

620
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,280
- What, you think I'm lying?

621
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,113
- Aren't you?

622
00:37:55,113 --> 00:37:55,946
- No.

623
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,953
I mean I.

624
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,380
I see.

625
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,952
So you're a good liar.

626
00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:05,369
- No, not at all.

627
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,193
Of course that could be a lie too.

628
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,250
- I've gotta get back to
my dorm before curfew.

629
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,501
- You have time.

630
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,918
(soft music)

631
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:19,850
Would you like to kiss me?

632
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,257
- No.

633
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,090
Uh.

634
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:24,834
- Why not?

635
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,713
- I, I just ... don't.

636
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:31,330
- Don't you like girls?

637
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,773
- Yeah, yeah, I like them.

638
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,710
- You think I'm ugly?

639
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,660
- No, it's not that, I just.

640
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,373
- Then why not?

641
00:38:39,373 --> 00:38:40,523
I want to.

642
00:38:41,692 --> 00:38:42,525
Why not?

643
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,521
Tell me.

644
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:47,047
- I can't.

645
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:48,870
- You can't kiss me?

646
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,233
- I can't tell you.

647
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,643
It's,

648
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,990
I just have to be sure of something.

649
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,967
I just, I--

650
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,470
Uh, look, I'm sorry.

651
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,863
I just can't explain. I'm not a prude.

652
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,194
I have to go.

653
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:08,611
(soft music)

654
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:13,748
(crickets chirping)

655
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,713
- Going out for another walk?

656
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,930
- Yeah, something like that.

657
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,970
- Hey, Elias, what is it about?

658
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,603
What is it you're looking for?

659
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:30,690
(crickets chirping)

660
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,240
- I'll tell you when I find it.

661
00:39:35,412 --> 00:39:38,929
(door opening and closing)

662
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:42,096
(dramatic drum music)

663
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,850
- You sure she said she was gonna be here?

664
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,213
- That's right.

665
00:39:51,213 --> 00:39:53,413
And I knocked on her
door before, no answer.

666
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,610
They're locked in their room,

667
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,407
and I locked Jarod's door
before I got you two.

668
00:39:58,407 --> 00:40:01,323
- And that means it's just
us ... and little Lilia.

669
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,460
Poor Colby and Willis.

670
00:40:04,383 --> 00:40:06,403
They don't know what
they're about to miss.

671
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:11,330
(door creaking)

672
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,350
- I've never been here before.

673
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,183
- Sh.

674
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,303
Oh Lilia, Daddy's here.

675
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:19,687
- You think this is the right room?

676
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:20,520
- Shut up.

677
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,007
If she isn't here, then
I know where she'll be.

678
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,308
Let's go.

679
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:31,475
(dramatic drum music)

680
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,243
Grab her arms.

681
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,833
- I know you. I know you!

682
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:41,733
- I want you to.

683
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:46,452
Too bad your mother
can't be here to watch.

684
00:40:46,452 --> 00:40:49,202
(dramatic music)

685
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:01,018
(screaming)

686
00:41:01,018 --> 00:41:04,431
(dramatic music)

687
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:06,764
(screaming)

688
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,851
(dramatic music)

689
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:22,251
(soft dramatic music)

690
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:37,591
- Tears of young men, are they
not the most poignant of all?

691
00:41:38,419 --> 00:41:41,586
(soft dramatic music)

692
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:45,234
(screaming)

693
00:41:46,645 --> 00:41:49,395
(dramatic music)

694
00:41:52,824 --> 00:41:53,962
- Get out of here.

695
00:41:53,962 --> 00:41:57,374
Get back to your room, get out.

696
00:41:57,374 --> 00:42:00,541
(soft dramatic music)

697
00:42:06,796 --> 00:42:09,713
(thunder rumbling)

698
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,603
- No, Elias, I have to admit

699
00:42:12,603 --> 00:42:14,703
that I didn't hear any screams last night.

700
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,160
Maybe it was some sort of
primitive male bonding ritual,

701
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,370
you know, like howling at the moon.

702
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,390
I have no problem
picturing Burke doing that.

703
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,320
- No, it wasn't like that.

704
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,910
They were coming from that room at the end

705
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,110
of the second floor corridor.

706
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,850
It's like a library.

707
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,550
- Second floor is forbidden
territory, man. I warned you.

708
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,360
- Yeah well there's nothing
I can do about it now.

709
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,980
She saw me.

710
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,530
She was in there, and,

711
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,022
and that's where those
screams were coming from.

712
00:42:40,022 --> 00:42:44,380
It was like they were being
tortured or ... or killed.

713
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,950
- Aw, see, see you just
trying to make me feel good.

714
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,420
- And there was this strange smell.

715
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,720
It was like.

716
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,553
- [Jacob] What?

717
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:53,543
- Like burning meat.

718
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,810
- What can I say?

719
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,940
I mean, torture and a
barbecue? Sounds good to me.

720
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,780
- You know what today is?

721
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,150
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

722
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,370
- It's the last day of the millennium.

723
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,880
50 generations since the last one.

724
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,800
An even hundred since we started counting.

725
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,320
- Well if it's gonna be
the end of the Earth,

726
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,600
I can't think of a more
appropriate place to experience it.

727
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,700
I mean we are in hell.

728
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:18,803
We are.

729
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,260
- [Jarod] Mr. Storm.

730
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,530
- Dr. Jarod, have you seen Lilia?

731
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:28,760
- I'm afraid I haven't.

732
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,520
I spent most of the
morning locked in my room.

733
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,790
Clearly someone's idea of a joke.

734
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,310
You were wandering the
halls last night, so I hear.

735
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,143
- Yes I was.

736
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:40,690
- Mrs. Greynitz spoke to me about it.

737
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,540
She's considering expelling you.

738
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,010
- Did Mrs. Greynitz tell you what happened

739
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,530
to Burke and his friend?

740
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:48,800
- Yes, she said they left late last night,

741
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,160
some sort of jaunt.

742
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,040
- And you believe that?

743
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,080
- Why do you care, Mr. Storm,

744
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,903
what I believe and what I don't?

745
00:43:56,955 --> 00:43:59,360
(thunder rumbling)

746
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,460
- A few weeks ago, I received this letter.

747
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,213
My sister and I were both
orphaned 12 years ago.

748
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,120
Our parents were murdered
at Steffon Sturma's grave,

749
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,090
and my sister ... disappeared.

750
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,030
At least I think she did.

751
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,673
I don't really remember what
happened all that clearly.

752
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,563
- Why do you tell me this?

753
00:44:22,982 --> 00:44:24,700
- This letter is not signed,

754
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,543
but it says that my sister's here.

755
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,293
Do you recognize the handwriting?

756
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,963
- I couldn't say.

757
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,010
I don't know why you're
telling me about this.

758
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,220
- My sister and I are
both blood descendants

759
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,560
of Steffon Sturma, the
only living descendants.

760
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,710
My parents brought us to his grave,

761
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,260
because they had to do something,

762
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,673
perform some kind of ritual.

763
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,840
I was wondering if you
might have some idea

764
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,703
what kinda ritual that may have been.

765
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,460
- How should I know?

766
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,910
- [Elias] Why are you afraid?

767
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,170
- Why shouldn't I be
afraid today, of all days?

768
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,043
The last day.

769
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:08,067
- Do you really believe that?

770
00:45:09,878 --> 00:45:11,123
- I don't know.

771
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:12,933
- Dr. Jarod, I need your help.

772
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,040
I think Lilia is in danger,

773
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,360
and I think Mrs. Greynitz
is using her for something,

774
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,650
I don't know what.

775
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,310
But something evil.

776
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:23,700
I don't know about the rest of the world,

777
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,533
but I have to help my-

778
00:45:26,705 --> 00:45:27,596
to help her.

779
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:30,763
(soft dramatic music)

780
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:35,940
(thunder cracking)

781
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,220
- Mr. Storm, you don't know what

782
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,020
you're getting yourself involved in.

783
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:42,943
- Maybe not.

784
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,309
But I am involved.

785
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:49,476
(soft dramatic music)

786
00:45:51,158 --> 00:45:52,260
- Have you seen Lilia?

787
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,400
- No, but she's got a way
of making herself scarce.

788
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,760
Elias, Burke and Grimes are gone.

789
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,650
- I know.

790
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:00,360
- Yeah, but you see, I didn't believe you.

791
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,210
But I checked the room and
nothing's been touched.

792
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,080
Their clothes, their
packs are still there.

793
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,810
Their toothbrushes.

794
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,440
Why would they just go off
in the middle of the night,

795
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,280
and where would they go?

796
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,840
The next train from Brevik doesn't leave

797
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,120
until tomorrow morning.

798
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,240
- I think something happened to them

799
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,380
in that library last night.

800
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,150
Look, I need your help.

801
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,060
- Yeah, well, there's something
you need to understand.

802
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,700
If I get kicked outta here,
my parents have assured me

803
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,850
that my next stop is military academy.

804
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:24,960
Now I don't like one Burke.

805
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,330
I certainly don't wanna end
up in a place full of Burkes.

806
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,170
- I think Burke and Grimes
were killed last night.

807
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,370
- Aw, come on.

808
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,809
- And I think Lilia is in danger,

809
00:46:31,809 --> 00:46:33,067
and I think the answer is in that library.

810
00:46:34,998 --> 00:46:37,998
(soft violin music)

811
00:46:41,681 --> 00:46:44,290
(birds singing)

812
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:47,290
(soft violin music)

813
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:57,611
(soft dramatic music)

814
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:06,271
(thunder cracking)

815
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:09,438
(soft dramatic music)

816
00:47:29,074 --> 00:47:31,913
(clock ticking)

817
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:35,080
(soft dramatic music)

818
00:47:59,237 --> 00:48:01,904
(door creaking)

819
00:48:03,343 --> 00:48:05,193
- Dr. Jarod, what are you doing here?

820
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,283
- I must ask you a question.

821
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,290
I know that you were out
of your room last night.

822
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,560
- I was here.

823
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,490
I heard Burke screaming,
and I came up here.

824
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,223
- And saw Mr. Burke?

825
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,527
- No, just Mrs. Greynitz and Lilia.

826
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,430
- And what else?

827
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,480
- I don't understand.

828
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,973
- Did you, did you smell anything?

829
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,640
- Yes.

830
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,093
There was a smell like burning meat.

831
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,674
And look, somebody's been reading this.

832
00:48:37,674 --> 00:48:38,900
And this.

833
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,150
This drawing, look at it.

834
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,217
(soft dramatic music)

835
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,650
- This is Theriel, the Black Angel.

836
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:53,230
He who is destined to
usher in the end of days.

837
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,990
- My parents had an amulet, a talisman

838
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,040
at my uncle's grave, it looked like this.

839
00:48:59,178 --> 00:49:00,011
I remember.

840
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:00,844
- Indeed.

841
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:05,510
Well, Mr. Storm, I have a confession.

842
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,660
I've also been playing
the detective today,

843
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,980
in the office of records.

844
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,360
I'm cousin to the man who works in there.

845
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,020
And in this office I found a record

846
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,360
of an adoption from 12 years ago.

847
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,193
Female.

848
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,320
Age approximately six.

849
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,493
English speaking, parents unknown.

850
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:23,690
Presumed dead.

851
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:24,550
Adopted by--

852
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:25,607
- Mrs. Greynitz.

853
00:49:28,138 --> 00:49:29,018
Lilia.

854
00:49:29,018 --> 00:49:32,185
(soft dramatic music)

855
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:34,113
- So it seems.

856
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,313
No great surprises.

857
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:41,370
Young Mr. Storm, there is
something terribly wrong

858
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,067
about Mrs. Greynitz and her daughter.

859
00:49:45,588 --> 00:49:46,990
- [Elias] I know.

860
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:48,203
- No, you do not.

861
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,000
To understand, you must see them

862
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,850
when they think themselves unobserved.

863
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,380
As I have over the years.

864
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,590
When you see them, you'd almost believe

865
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,740
that Lilia is the mother

866
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,233
and Mrs. Greynitz is the daughter.

867
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,856
That the will of the child,
not the woman, commands.

868
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:10,880
- I don't understand.

869
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,600
- The girl, she's not as she appears.

870
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,029
She's not what she should be.

871
00:50:17,029 --> 00:50:20,196
(soft dramatic music)

872
00:50:25,196 --> 00:50:27,831
(wolves howling)

873
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:30,998
(dramatic drum music)

874
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,613
- Oh, hi.

875
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,833
- Hello.

876
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,918
- Fancy meeting you here.

877
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:45,963
- I knew you would be in here.

878
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:46,796
- Oh.

879
00:50:48,655 --> 00:50:52,563
So, uh, I guess I won't be
starting the new semester.

880
00:50:53,472 --> 00:50:54,863
- What are you talking about?

881
00:50:54,863 --> 00:50:57,790
- I was sorta picturing
a sequence where you

882
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,923
tell your mom, I get expelled.

883
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,170
I end up wearing a uniform,

884
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,090
being beaten with bars of soap.

885
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,970
- She's not my mother.

886
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:06,930
- I'm sorry.

887
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,380
- She's not my mother.

888
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,563
Just an occasionally useful tool.

889
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,840
- Okay.

890
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,810
- You're clever but not
really very smart, are you?

891
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,460
- Smart enough not to bother
answering that question.

892
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:25,253
- Now, show me how warm you can make me.

893
00:51:25,253 --> 00:51:28,420
(soft dramatic music)

894
00:51:33,711 --> 00:51:35,827
(hissing)

895
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,577
(dramatic music)

896
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,560
- Theriel must be
summoned by the anointed.

897
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:49,820
Seven sacrifices are laid at
the seven points of the altar.

898
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,020
Theriel stands at the seventh point.

899
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,533
Through him, the gate is open.

900
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,930
- The gate to hell?

901
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:58,060
- Yes, the gate to hell.

902
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,718
From which the armies of Lucifer will come

903
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:04,393
to fight their final war on Earth.

904
00:52:06,550 --> 00:52:07,500
- You believe that?

905
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,080
- That, young man, is for us to discover.

906
00:52:13,049 --> 00:52:15,648
(door creaking)

907
00:52:15,648 --> 00:52:18,398
(dramatic music)

908
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:26,850
(door creaking)

909
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,200
- This is fake. Did you know about this?

910
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,960
- [Jarod] This is Mrs.
Greynitz's private library.

911
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,360
I've never been here before.

912
00:52:33,365 --> 00:52:36,698
(upbeat dramatic music)

913
00:52:41,353 --> 00:52:44,970
(soft dramatic music)

914
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,600
- What is this?

915
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,550
What's going on? Who are you?

916
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:49,970
- Don't you know me?

917
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,710
I am the final sleep of the world.

918
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,870
I am Tidu.

919
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:59,023
- Okay, fine.

920
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,351
I got you.

921
00:53:01,351 --> 00:53:04,101
(dramatic music)

922
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:09,833
- Oh my God.

923
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,077
My God, my God.

924
00:53:14,117 --> 00:53:15,611
- Holy shit.

925
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:17,620
- You know what this means, don't you,

926
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,400
why they are here?

927
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,680
They're five of the seven sacrifices,

928
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,033
their hearts burnt out
just as the book says.

929
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,390
And two more sacrifices are needed,

930
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,203
and two more students remain.

931
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,195
Close the door please, close it.

932
00:53:33,195 --> 00:53:35,930
(door creaking)

933
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:39,166
Mr. Storm, I'm going to call the police.

934
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:40,720
- What good'll that do?

935
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,640
- Do you think they're all-powerful?

936
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,640
You must find Jacob
and get away from here.

937
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,473
And quickly.

938
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,483
- What about Lilia?

939
00:53:48,336 --> 00:53:50,240
- Don't you understand?

940
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,958
She's the one from whom you must run.

941
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:53,791
- I don't believe you.

942
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,330
- Well believe what you will.

943
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,750
I believe that if seven
bodies lie upon the altar

944
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,813
at midnight tonight, the
sun will never rise again.

945
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:06,101
Please, find Jacob and
leave here. And quickly.

946
00:54:06,101 --> 00:54:09,268
(soft dramatic music)

947
00:54:17,851 --> 00:54:20,518
(blow striking)

948
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,090
(dramatic music)

949
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,500
- Faith is God's great weakness.

950
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,473
Don't you agree?

951
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,330
I have none, not in God.

952
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:50,160
But in the other one,
in him, I have faith.

953
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,860
Because he has shown himself to me.

954
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,060
He has shown me the world as it will be.

955
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,290
He has removed the scales from my eyes.

956
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:04,273
Tonight, all things
will be changed, Doctor.

957
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,500
The weak will become strong.

958
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:13,000
The obscure will be
lifted up to greatness.

959
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,510
The slaves in hell will all be freed.

960
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:19,052
All thing on the last day.

961
00:55:19,052 --> 00:55:21,701
- No (screams).

962
00:55:21,701 --> 00:55:24,451
(dramatic music)

963
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:29,200
(screaming)

964
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:33,156
(soft music)

965
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,467
(body thudding)

966
00:55:51,624 --> 00:55:54,374
(dramatic music)

967
00:56:03,317 --> 00:56:06,618
(door creaking)

968
00:56:06,618 --> 00:56:09,368
(dramatic music)

969
00:56:37,587 --> 00:56:40,754
(soft dramatic music)

970
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,883
- My hand comes from fire.

971
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,571
I hold thy heart.

972
00:56:55,571 --> 00:56:58,152
(screaming)

973
00:56:58,152 --> 00:57:00,902
(dramatic music)

974
00:57:48,103 --> 00:57:50,520
(soft music)

975
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,471
- Oh good, you're awake.

976
00:57:57,761 --> 00:57:59,570
- Please, Lilia, don't do this.

977
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:02,180
- Do you think anything
can it stop it now?

978
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,700
Don't you know where we are?

979
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,900
This is the heart of the whole world,

980
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:12,040
and soon the Black
Angel will burn it away,

981
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,960
just as he burned the
hearts of your friends.

982
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,793
See.

983
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:22,100
You see, he burned their hearts

984
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,230
with his hand made of fire.

985
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:29,250
A stupid boy like you
could never understand.

986
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,433
This is a miracle.

987
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:36,780
More a miracle than
turning water into wine.

988
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,717
And you are here to be part of it.

989
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:41,720
- You're crazy.

990
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,583
- In a few moments, the
whole world will be crazy.

991
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:47,565
Look.

992
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,230
Look at him.

993
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,063
He stands.

994
00:58:55,543 --> 00:58:58,626
- It is time for the final sacrifice.

995
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:01,883
- Elizabeth.

996
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:04,340
- She won't answer to that name.

997
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,110
It was I who found her

998
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,730
in a stinking home for forgotten children.

999
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:15,730
It was I who saw her
for what she truly was.

1000
00:59:16,176 --> 00:59:19,267
The proud princess, the avatar.

1001
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:21,930
All of death resides within her life,

1002
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:26,680
and tonight it all will come to pass,

1003
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,203
as it has been foretold.

1004
00:59:29,681 --> 00:59:33,255
Tonight, the last night of the world.

1005
00:59:33,255 --> 00:59:36,332
(dramatic music)

1006
00:59:36,332 --> 00:59:38,582
(groaning)

1007
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:47,583
- Good night, Mother, on
this last night of the world.

1008
00:59:51,023 --> 00:59:53,323
I've missed you, Elias.

1009
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:55,563
I really have.

1010
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,613
I've thought about you.

1011
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,060
- Why?

1012
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,940
- I suppose I could have
just killed her before

1013
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,830
and not bothered tying
you down on the altar.

1014
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,420
She wanted to be evil,

1015
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,300
but she didn't have the
courage of her convictions.

1016
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,750
I despise cowards.

1017
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,260
She was always going to be the last.

1018
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:16,263
And, Elias, you were always
meant to be here to see it.

1019
01:00:19,466 --> 01:00:21,870
- I don't understand.

1020
01:00:21,870 --> 01:00:23,353
- I'm sorry I lied to you.

1021
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,103
I had to be careful.

1022
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:32,750
(choir singing in foreign language)

1023
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,673
But I will never lie to you again.

1024
01:00:35,756 --> 01:00:38,923
(soft dramatic music)

1025
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:54,360
Don't worry about breaking taboos.

1026
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,853
Soon, there won't be any.

1027
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,933
Who do you think sent
you the letter, and why?

1028
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:06,470
Because tonight is the
time, and this is the place.

1029
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:09,743
And you and I are the ones
that must bring it about.

1030
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,360
We were both part of the ceremony.

1031
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,723
We were both chosen.

1032
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:17,723
You ran, but it doesn't matter.

1033
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:22,053
Nothing matters anymore
except that you are here.

1034
01:01:26,231 --> 01:01:30,564
(choir singing in foreign language)

1035
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,900
Don't let it bother you.

1036
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,250
A couple of days ago, they were strangers.

1037
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,650
Now, they're just memories.

1038
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:40,500
- Just?

1039
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:42,890
- We stand on the edge of a great change.

1040
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:47,240
And all great changes are
marked by the spilling of blood.

1041
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,293
- Innocent blood?

1042
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,323
- Who of us is truly innocent.

1043
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:57,040
Look, his name is Theriel.

1044
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,500
He was cast out of
heaven because he refused

1045
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,110
to bow down before God.

1046
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:04,560
But he bows down before me and you.

1047
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,393
- Why?

1048
01:02:05,393 --> 01:02:06,226
- Because we're royalty.

1049
01:02:08,351 --> 01:02:10,483
We were anointed by our uncle.

1050
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,061
I am to be the queen of air and fire.

1051
01:02:15,061 --> 01:02:15,894
You are to be the Earth king.

1052
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:19,900
(hissing)

1053
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:30,386
(soft dramatic music)

1054
01:02:32,376 --> 01:02:33,709
We'll begin now.

1055
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,763
Just do as I say.

1056
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:40,683
Everything will be all
right. I promise you.

1057
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,713
My husband to be.

1058
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,400
There is a language that made the world.

1059
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,450
To speak in that language is to create

1060
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:56,763
the way God creates,
and I have learned it.

1061
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,500
By the words I speak, and by the summoning

1062
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,560
of the Black Angel, we
will make the world new,

1063
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,863
in fire and in blood.

1064
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:11,915
(speaking foreign language)

1065
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,873
Come, close to me.

1066
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,673
They say that no one can look
into the face of God and live.

1067
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:10,393
In here is the face of
that which even God fears.

1068
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,900
Look at it, Elias.

1069
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:16,950
By the power of the Black
Angel, we will open the gate

1070
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:18,693
and let it walk upon the Earth.

1071
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:21,903
Take my hand, Elias.

1072
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,823
Do it, do as I say.

1073
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,584
I love you, Elias. I love you.

1074
01:04:28,584 --> 01:04:31,001
(whispering)

1075
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:37,136
(speaking foreign language)

1076
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:44,127
Awaken, Black Angel, doom of the world.

1077
01:04:46,024 --> 01:04:48,132
(zapping)

1078
01:04:48,132 --> 01:04:50,882
(dramatic music)

1079
01:05:12,932 --> 01:05:15,182
(growling)

1080
01:05:18,885 --> 01:05:22,139
(dramatic music)

1081
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:24,889
(knife striking)

1082
01:05:30,657 --> 01:05:33,407
(dramatic music)

1083
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:45,087
(choir singing)

1084
01:05:51,632 --> 01:05:54,799
- I love you, Elizabeth. I always did.

1085
01:05:55,846 --> 01:05:58,596
(dramatic music)

1086
01:06:13,895 --> 01:06:16,812
(thunder rumbling)

1087
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:33,010
- The engineers say that
it was structurally sound.

1088
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:35,040
And it's dirt cheap.

1089
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,470
Way below market, even for this place.

1090
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:40,530
- Why way below market if
it isn't about to fall down?

1091
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:41,610
No indoor plumbing.

1092
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:43,270
- [Father] No, the plumbing is fine.

1093
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,140
It has an evil history.

1094
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,290
- [Mother] Ghosts?

1095
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:47,890
- Mass murder.

1096
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:50,930
Around five years ago,
nine victims found dead.

1097
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:53,330
Seven with their hearts torn out.

1098
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:54,320
- [Mother] How charming.

1099
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,140
What did the other two have torn out?

1100
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:56,973
- Nothing.

1101
01:06:56,973 --> 01:06:58,349
One was smothered, and the other one

1102
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:01,370
had been stabbed around 100 times.

1103
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:03,130
And the killer was never found.

1104
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:04,920
- And this is where you want to build

1105
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,460
your corporate retreat?

1106
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:08,360
- [Father] Well I'm not superstitious.

1107
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:11,293
- [Mother] Where's Linnie.

1108
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,420
- Linnie.
- Linnie.

1109
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,813
- Linnie, where are you?

1110
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:15,646
- Linnie.

1111
01:07:18,706 --> 01:07:20,206
- Linnie.
- Linnie.

1112
01:07:21,207 --> 01:07:22,040
- Linnie.

1113
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,876
(soft dramatic music)

1114
01:07:24,876 --> 01:07:25,709
Linnie.

1115
01:07:32,474 --> 01:07:35,224
(dramatic music)
