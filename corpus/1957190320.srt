Did you follow my instructions?

139
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,663
Yes. I think
that his humerus is better

140
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:12,535
because he's flapping
and flying around the cage.

141
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,059
That's good.
Really good work, Todd.

142
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,321
And he eats all the time.

taken good care of him.

00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,907
You have to let him go.

182
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:06,127
[bird chirps]

183
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,824
[cage rattles]

184
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:12,394
Hey, go see
your family again.

185
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,362
[bird screeches]

186
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:32,153
Bye, Jay.

187
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,679
Hey, hey, hey,
you did good.

188
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:37,724
[sniffles]

189
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:38,899
You did good.

190
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:42,903
He can be
his own master again.

191
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,777
Because I set him free?

192
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,736
Mm-hmm, yeah,
that's right.

193
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,740
Okay.

194
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:54,871
I think Mom's probably
got dinner ready.

195
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:56,046
Let's go in,
all right?

196
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,441
Okay.
All right,
good boy.

197
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,402
["Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"
playing on radio]

198
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:05,795
Todd, when you're done clearing
the table,

199
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,883
I'd want you to go upstairs
and clean your room.

200
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,885
Okay.

201
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,366
No, Todd,
look at me.

202
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,324
I know you don't like
doing it,

203
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:15,675
but I want you to at least
put away your shoes and clothes.

204
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,894
I want that room clean
for the Christmas party.

205
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:20,244
I will.

206
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,029
MAN [on radio]:
If that song doesn't get you
in the Christmas spirit,

207
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,683
I've got just the thing
that will.

208
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,294
We have someone here in our very
own studio, Hayley Ronaldson,

209
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:28,731
manager of the Santee County
animal shelter.

210
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,081
Hayley Ronaldson?
Don't we know her?

211
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,736
Yeah, Hayley Price.
Hannah's friend, remember?

212
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,259
Oh, that's right, yeah.

213
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:37,435
HAYLEY:
What we've done
is we've created a program

214
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:40,134
that we call
Adopt-A-Dog for Christmas.

215
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:41,744
Now, our employees
and volunteers

216
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:45,400
naturally would like to take
a few days off at Christmas

217
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:47,619
to spend time
with their loved ones.

218
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:51,667
The problem is, is this leaves
us shorthanded at the shelter.

219
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,583
So what we're doing
is offering people a chance

220
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:57,281
to care for a dog
for the holidays.

221
00:11:57,325 --> 00:11:58,935
No, Todd.

222
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,329
Come on by the shelter
and pick out a dog to take home.

223
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,418
Oh, Dad...
No.

224
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:07,161
Give him or her lots of love
and affection over the holidays,

225
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:10,773
and then you bring the dog back
after Christmas on the 26th.

226
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:13,733
That is, of course,
unless you decide to keep it.

227
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:15,125
Dad, could we get
a dog?
No, Todd!

228
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,997
MAN:
That sounds like
a doggone good idea.

229
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,303
And good luck with the program.

230
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:20,478
It sounds like a real winner.

231
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:22,132
It's a real
winner, Dad.
You know...

232
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,481
It's a real winner!

233
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,353
This is a farm, Todd.

234
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:26,441
We raise animals for a purpose.

235
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,269
That purpose
is to make a living.

236
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:29,313
Mom has horses.

237
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:31,838
Well, yeah,
which are for breeding.

238
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,013
She sells the colts each year.

239
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:37,147
Dad, the shelter wants us
to have a dog for the holidays.

240
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,019
It's just
for a few days

241
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:40,498
so that the dogs
aren't alone

242
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:41,804
in their kennels
for Christmas.

243
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,197
You know, it's just...
it's not that simple.

244
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,808
They figure that when
folks get the dog home,

245
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:46,722
they're gonna bond with it

246
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:49,072
and somebody is gonna
beg to keep it--

247
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:50,987
that would be you--
and then somebody else

248
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:53,468
is gonna give in.

249
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:56,819
Besides, we don't need any more
animals around here.

250
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,603
[dishes clattering]

251
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,868
Most definitely not a dog.

252
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:06,524
It's a real winner.

253
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:09,484
[piano playing gentle melody]

254
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,758
[music stops]

255
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:34,509
Making a list
and checking it twice?

256
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:37,991
It's year-end bills.

257
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,522
So...

258
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,089
about that
Adopt-A-Dog thing.

259
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,398
We've talked about
dogs before.

260
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:55,312
No, we've never talked
about dogs before.

261
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:59,577
You've always
just said no.

262
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:04,060
Why can't we bend
on this a little?

263
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,281
We never bent with any
of the other kids.

264
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,761
I don't want to make
an exception with Todd.

265
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:13,200
But they didn't need it
the way Todd does.

266
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:15,245
And in this case,
it wouldn't be permanent.

267
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:18,292
Exactly. We're going to upset
his daily routine for what,

268
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:20,598
for a week?

269
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,209
He's gonna fall in love
with that dog

270
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:23,645
after three wags of a tail,

271
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:26,648
and then we're going
to force him to take it back.

272
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,824
Do you have any idea how hard
that's gonna be on him?

273
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,479
He's raised 4-H calves
and sheep

274
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:33,481
and sold them
when it came time.

275
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:36,919
That's... different.

276
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:41,054
Livestock don't...
get into a boy's heart

277
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,056
the way a dog does.

278
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:47,930
He's not a boy.

279
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:51,499
And if you don't want him
to be a burden,

280
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:52,152
he needs these kinds

281
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:55,329
of opportunities.

282
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:58,114
My answer is still no.

Hey, good news, McCray.
You're going home.

Take it easy.
Take it easy.

00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,143
You're not gonna be walking
any time soon, okay?

289
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:30,277
My-my dog.

290
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,322
There wasn't
any dog, okay?

291
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,845
Get him on the
chopper, guys.

292
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:34,803

You a lucky man.
Yes, sir.

302
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,453
What about you?

303
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,455
You got yourself
a girl?

304
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:47,109

[knocking on door]

309
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,386
Oh, Todd.

310
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:51,260
Mom, can you talk to Dad about
the Adopt-A-Dog program?

311
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:54,220
Because I've been thinking
about it a lot, a really lot,

312
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:57,527
and it's a good thing
to help out...

313
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,182
and I'm a responsible person.

314
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:02,184
I know.

315
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,577
You're a young man now, right?

316
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,101
I <i>am</i> a young man now.

317
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,408
MARY ANN:
I thought this year
we might get a live tree.

318
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,585
One that we could plant
somewhere on the place

319
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,064
after Christmas.
What do you think?

320
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,718
Yeah. Yeah,
I could pick one up.

321
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:15,589
I have to go into town
after work

322
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,634
to pick up dewormer anyway.

323
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:18,722
You need anything
from Hank's?

324
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,115
What do I need to do?

325
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,161
Well, you can help me
pick out the tree.

326
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,336
You're a real good
tree picker.

327
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:25,947
No, what do I need
to do to get the dog?

328
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,385
The radio says it's
a really good idea.

329
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:33,302
I'm sure they do, Todd.
We've been through this already.

330
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:34,390
But you always say

331
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:36,566
that anything worth having
is worth working for.

332
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,480
And a dog is worth having.

333
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:39,917
I want to work
for a dog.

334
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:42,181
Son, you don't understand.

335
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,400
But I do.
I do understand.

336
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:45,793
I'm a young man now.

337
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:47,795
And I want to work for it.
What do I need to do?

338
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,717
Look, I'll tell you right now

339
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,981
I don't think this
is a good idea.

340
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,681
But if I were to agree,

341
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:05,595
we would have to
do things my way.

342
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,467
When the dog got here,

343
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,643
I would expect you
to take care of it--

344
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,862
not your mother
and not me.

345
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:13,255
And I would expect you

346
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,691
to keep up with
all of your chores.

347
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:17,085
I will. I promise.

348
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:22,656
You have to give your
word that when it's time

349
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,571
to take the dog back to
the shelter, you'll do it.

350
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:27,400
Without complaining.

351
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:28,923
I give you my word.

352
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:34,842
What about your room?

353
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:37,018
I know you
think it's clean,

354
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:37,975
you know where
everything is,

355
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:39,586
it all makes
sense to you,

356
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:41,544
but to your mother and me,
it's a jungle in there.

357
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:42,632
I'll clean my room.

358
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,460
No, I mean really
clean, Todd.

359
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:45,766
I don't mean stuffing
things in the closet

360
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,637
and putting stuff
under the bed.

361
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:49,160
I'll get it really clean.

362
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:51,728
That's right,
I mean really clean.

363
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:52,947
Deal.

364
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,688
Well, all right,
then, yeah, okay.

365
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:57,299
Then we have a deal.

366
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:01,521
Well, let's go feed.

367

I have to go help Dad.

368
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,008
We're gonna feed
the cows.

369
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:16,666
I don't know why
you feel the need

370
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,234
to make this so hard for him.

371
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,458

You need to eat
all your food.

372
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,286
Good girl.

All right,
that's enough, Katie.

376

Want some, too, Lucy?

377
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:36,991
All right, come here.
Come here, Lucy.

378
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:39,036
Good girl. Good girl.

[laughing]

380
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,359
All right, we'll do this
on three, all right?

381
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,622
Okay.

382
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:03,409
One, two, two and a half...

383
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:04,975
Dad!

384
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,237
You said three!

385
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:07,282
I said--
well, did I?

386
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,111
You didn't say
two and a half.

I'm getting a dog
for Christmas.

390
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:27,563
No kidding?

No kidding.

Well, not just yet.

You've got a couple things
to do first.

I have to clean my room
before I can get it.

I have to get it
really clean.

397
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:39,836
I'll hang on to these
for you, Todd.

398
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,664
Bye, Mr. Fisher.

399
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,187

Just like you when
you were a kid.

406

Never saw you without
that dog of yours.

this paint over to you,

forgetting.

of the tree this year

Todd, I believe

00:24:05,226 --> 00:24:07,968
this is the prettiest
tree we've ever had.

for finding it.

No, Dad,
it's not over there.

Okay.
You stop it.

in the morning.

stop torturing him.

I could be getting pneumonia.

Well, Todd, since your dad
is feeling so ill,

476
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:53,960
I guess I'll have
to go with you

477

to get the dog.

I think you should drive.

And when do we
take the dog back?

On December 26.

That's when
Christmas ends.

That's when he has to
go back to the shelter.

That's when he has
to go back to the shelter.

Okay.

Oh, she's great.

I'll tell her
you asked.

won all those ribbons

Yes, I was in 4-H.

516

Yeah, and I
remember how nicely
you treated the animals.

So you can look
over all the dogs,

522
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,693

if there's a good fit

family, okay?

have called in?

Well, you're
still the first,

527
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,050
but hopefully...

Wow, that's a lot of dogs.

529
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,706
Yeah, we normally have
around 25 in here at once,

we've got 33.

all come from?

533
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:04,063
Dogs come to us for a
lot of different reasons.

534
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:06,195
Um, they get lost.

535
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:07,370
Their owners drop
them off

536
00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:08,850
because they can't
afford to keep them.

537
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:11,418
And sometimes, when people
don't want their dogs anymore,

538
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:14,073
they just dump 'em,
and we pick 'em up.

539
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:15,204
What's this one's name?

540
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:18,773
That's Pork Chop.
Pork Chop?

541
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,253
Hi, Pork Chop.
She's a basset
hound-beagle mix.

542
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:22,385
Did she get lost?

543
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:23,952
Well, she had her collar
and her tags.

544
00:30:23,996 --> 00:30:26,041
We were able
to contact the owner,

545
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:27,521
but he never showed up.

546
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:31,351
Why didn't he come
pick up his dog?

547
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:33,614
She was waiting for him.

548
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,094
How people treat a dog
says a lot about them.

549
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:37,226
Sometimes, people have
to spend so much time

550
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,098
taking care of themselves

551
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:41,578
that they don't have
anything left for an animal.

552
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:43,189
Whoa!
Do you want
to see this one?

553
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:44,233
Yeah.

554
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:45,278
This is Sally.

555
00:30:45,321 --> 00:30:46,279
Hi, Sally.

556
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:48,934
She's a Border collie.

557
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:51,719
Oh, she's a pretty
Border collie.

558
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,590
Mm-hmm.
Hi.

559
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:57,029
Were you sleeping?

560
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:59,031
She got hurt, huh?

561
00:30:59,074 --> 00:31:01,424
You're right.
How can you tell?

562
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:02,599
She has a scar.

563
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:06,255
Hello.

564
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:09,258
This is Serena.

That's Buddy.

He's really gentle.

571
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,311
He's actually been here
for a little while.

HAYLEY:
She's very gentle.

574
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,578
You just go on in.
You can pet her.

575
00:31:24,621 --> 00:31:25,622
She's a doll.

576
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,102
I can't see her face.

577
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:31,324
-Hi, Winky!
-And that's a sheepdog.

578
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,065
That's Shelby.

Whoa, so much hair.

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,634
Hi. Yeah.

Look at you.
You're so pretty.

582
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,856
Lassie?
I watched a movie with you.

583
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,991
She's a little shy,
but no, she likes you!

What's his name?

00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:16,456
He doesn't
have one yet.

593
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:18,023
We just brought
him in yesterday.

594
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:21,287
Hasn't been here
long enough for us
to give him a name.

595
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:26,161
Do you want
to look him over?

596
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:30,513
Now, I checked him out

597
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,037

598
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,735
He's had some training.
Watch this. Good boy. Good boy.

Now stay.

Why is he so dirty?

606
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:55,364
HAYLEY:
I haven't had time
to clean him yet.

607
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:57,540
He's been on his own
for awhile.

608
00:32:57,584 --> 00:33:00,587
He hasn't had anybody
to take care of him.

609
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,937
Hi!

610
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,682

I want this one.

612

-This is your collar.
-Nice.

00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:18,230
We take him back
on December 26

628
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:20,101
because that's when
Christmas ends.

629

was named Sally.

891
00:45:44,132 --> 00:45:47,048
Would've taken me months
to get a dog trained that well.

892
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:48,180
Todd didn't have
months, Hank.

893
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:49,442
And Dad says Christmas
has to go back

894
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:52,097
to the animal shelter
on the 26th.

895
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,664
What's the matter, George?
You don't like Christmas?

896
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,144
He's only here on loan.

897
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:57,667
Is there something
wrong with him?

898
00:45:57,711 --> 00:45:59,365
The shelter wants people to take
dogs over the holidays,

899
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:01,236
so we're just trying
to do our part.

900
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,630
Hey, you could do it,
too, Mr. Fisher.

901
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:05,066
GEORGE:
Yeah.
[laughter]

902
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:06,676
Why don't you try that, Hank?

903
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,417
Yeah, well, I'm getting a little
too old to be adopting a dog.

904
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:11,333
No, you're not too
old, Mr. Fisher.

905
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:14,380
I think
it's a wonderful idea.

906
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:15,381
Hank, why don't we?

907
00:46:16,686 --> 00:46:20,038
Well, only if I can find
a dog I can warm up to.

908
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:21,604
And what kind of dog
would that be, Hank,

909
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:22,736
a bulldog?

910
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,521
THOMAS:
More like a pit bull.

911
00:46:25,565 --> 00:46:27,132
[laughter]

912
00:46:27,175 --> 00:46:28,960
Jonathan and Thomas,

913
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:30,570
you guys should do it, too.

914
00:46:30,613 --> 00:46:33,616
Yeah, I can tell you guys think
it's a good idea, don't you?

915
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,792
[both groan]

916
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:35,705
HANK:
You know, George...

917
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:38,578
they've really inspired me.

918
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:40,667
You guys are going to lead
by example, aren't you?

919
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,801
Taking in those cuddly
homeless dogs

920
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:45,672
for your kids to love.

921
00:46:45,715 --> 00:46:46,760
Now, that's noble.

922
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,327
Actually, I
didn't plan on...

923
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:49,763
Well, Faye and I are going to go
see the folks, so we're, uh...

924
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,939
You know, it's so
generous of you

925
00:46:51,983 --> 00:46:53,027
to take time out of
your hectic schedule

926
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:55,116
to go down to the shelter,
both of you,

927
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,378
and pick out a dog.

928
00:46:56,422 --> 00:46:58,598
TWINS:
We're getting a dog, Daddy?

929
00:46:58,641 --> 00:46:59,991
[laughter]
Oh, hey,

930
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:01,383
guys, no way.

931
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:04,865
I think that it's
a fabulous idea, boys.

932
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:06,040
I can make a list, okay?

933
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:06,998
Mom, I need a
pen and paper.

934
00:47:07,041 --> 00:47:08,695
Well, I'll get them for you.

935
00:47:08,738 --> 00:47:10,740
Okay. Hey,
you guys want

936
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:12,003
to help me sign
people up, too?

937
00:47:12,046 --> 00:47:13,047
Yeah, sure.
Okay.

938
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:14,179
Okay. Dad, we're going

939
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:15,745
to make an Adopt-A-Dog
list, okay?

940
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:17,095
All right.
Perfect, perfect.

941
00:47:17,138 --> 00:47:18,400
You know, George,

942
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:19,662
I think your sons have
really started something.

943
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:21,795
I'm real proud of my boys.

944
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,231
[chuckles]

945
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:26,669
TODD:
Jonathan gets one.

946
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:29,977
Mr. Fisher gets one.

947
00:47:30,021 --> 00:47:33,720
Lucy and Thomas...

948
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:35,026
You know, Dad,

949
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:37,593
donations to a nonprofit
are fully deductible.

950
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:39,073
Considering all the dogs
you placed tonight,

951
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:40,901
you could probably write off
the whole party.

952
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:42,729
Really?
No, Dad.

953
00:47:42,772 --> 00:47:44,949
I can't believe
this, Todd.

954
00:47:44,992 --> 00:47:46,428
How many people
signed up?

955
00:47:46,472 --> 00:47:47,995
Seven.

956
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:50,258
We're going to take this over
to Hayley in the morning.

957
00:47:50,302 --> 00:47:52,652
And then
I can get some more.

958
00:47:52,695 --> 00:47:53,958
No, Todd. One dog.

959
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:55,611
That's all.

960
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:58,049
No. More people, Dad.

961
00:47:58,092 --> 00:48:00,399
'Cause Hayley says
she needs more people

962
00:48:00,442 --> 00:48:02,967
so that all the dogs
have homes for Christmas.

963
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,403
Just until the 26th.

964
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:06,405
That's when the dogs
go back to the shelter.

965
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:07,754
Right?

966
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:08,929
Not all the dogs.

967
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:10,148
Right.

968
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:11,889
Some people will
keep their dogs.

969
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:14,108
We are not keeping
the dog.

970
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:21,246
I'll see you Christmas day.

971
00:48:21,289 --> 00:48:22,508
Play your cards right, I might
let you drive the tractor.

972
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:24,510
You used to love that
when you were a kid.

973
00:48:24,553 --> 00:48:28,035
Yeah, the tractor
was always great, Dad,

974
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,167
but I really loved
being with you.

975
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,820
Jonathan gets one...

976
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:33,084
Same here.
Still do.

977
00:48:33,127 --> 00:48:34,172
You, don't stay up too late.

978
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:36,739
You've got chores
in the morning.

979
00:48:36,783 --> 00:48:37,784
Night, Dad.

980
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:38,916
Don't use the help too hard.

981
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:42,049
We might need them
when we're old.

982
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:43,485
I'll be up in a few minutes.

983
00:48:43,529 --> 00:48:44,834
Night, Dad.

984
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:47,359
Night, honey.

985
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,892
Ow.

986
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:03,157
Ow.

00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:20,174
That was quick.

992
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,790
Get down.

993
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:30,924
Get off.

994
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,883
Get.

995
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:37,757
Just...

996
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:40,847
Get lost!

997
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,197
Get off.

1001
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:27,154
Good morning, Hayley.

1002
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:28,373
Hey, Todd.

1003
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,939
Is everything okay
with your dog?

1004
00:50:29,983 --> 00:50:32,290
Yes, Christmas
is wonderful.

1005
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:35,249
Todd's actually got something
he'd like to give you.

1006
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:37,599
It's a lot of people
from our Christmas party--

1007
00:50:37,643 --> 00:50:40,385
not the kids, though,
just the grown-ups--

1008
00:50:40,428 --> 00:50:41,081
they all want to take a dog.

1009
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,431
Are you serious?

1010
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:44,432
Yeah.

1011
00:50:45,738 --> 00:50:46,565
And they didn't know about it,
but now they do.

1012
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:49,089
And then they all said yes.

1013
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:51,091
With a little
convincing.

1014
00:50:51,135 --> 00:50:52,179
Wow, this is amazing.

1015
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:54,399
Todd, I don't know
how to thank you.

1016
00:50:54,442 --> 00:50:55,008
No one else has even called.

1017
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,402
Yeah.

1018
00:50:57,445 --> 00:51:00,100
How many more people
do you need now?

1019
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:02,276
Well, if everybody
on this list takes a dog,

1020
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,886
we'll need about... 25 more.

1021
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,802
Okay, I'll find some more.

But that's okay, Mrs. Erdman.

1033
00:52:07,428 --> 00:52:09,691
You don't have to want
a forever dog.

1034
00:52:09,735 --> 00:52:11,084
You just have to take
a Christmas dog.

1035
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,348
All you do is go see Hayley,
down at the shelter.

1036
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:19,048
Well, you should
definitely hurry up

1037
00:52:19,092 --> 00:52:21,573
'cause dogs are going fast

1038
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:23,575

1057
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,946
She said no.

1058
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:31,773
Still at it?

1059
00:53:32,948 --> 00:53:34,167
Todd's placed
five more dogs already.

1060
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,125

he is some operator.

1062
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:43,481
How many are left?

1063
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:44,090
There are...

1064
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,226
...20 more.

1065
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:50,836
We may run out of friends.

1066

Probably already
run out of friends.

1067
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,711

a few more days.

00:53:58,844 --> 00:54:00,628
Well, how many dogs
have you placed already?

1070
00:54:00,672 --> 00:54:02,717
Twelve?
That's amazing.

1071
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:03,588
You should be proud
of that right there.

1072
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:06,634
No, it's not good enough.

1073
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:08,288
Well, I'm just saying
there's no shame

1074
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:10,682
in not finding a home
for every dog.

1075
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:11,900
-It's not good enough, Dad.
-Well...

1076
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:14,120
George, instead
of discouraging your son,

1077
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,991
why don't you help him?

1078
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:17,297
I'm not discouraging him.

1079
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:18,211
You've called everybody we know.

1080
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,126
It's been on the radio.

1081
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:21,475
What else are you
supposed to do?

1082
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:23,042
MARY ANN:
What about your
Rotary buddies?

1083
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:24,304
GEORGE:
Well, why don't you look
at your school roster?

1084
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:25,697
Call Betty Meyer.

1085
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,915
Give her that little...
give her the little poodle.

1086
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:28,221
That little...
what was his name?

1087
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,223
Hannah took the poodle.

1088
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,050
-Her name is Serena.
-Hannah?

1089
00:54:31,093 --> 00:54:33,922
She's not supposed to...

1090
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:35,402
She's not supposed to have
pets in her apartment.

1091
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:36,925
I think she bribed
the manager.

1092
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:38,231
Yeah, well, she's turned into
a regular little outlaw.

1093
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,147
Should have
raised her better.

1094
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,018
And what's-what's...

1095
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:47,545
Where's Todd? Isn't this
supposed to be his thing?

1096
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:09,306
Someone must be lost.

1097
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:12,613
No, they're not.

1098
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,139
What is going on?

1099
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,577
Todd seems to know.

1100
00:55:27,715 --> 00:55:30,936
Hi, I'm Brianna Lewis
from Channel 8.

1101
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:31,893
Hi, Brianna Lewis.

1102
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:34,243
My name is Todd McCray
from Crossing Trails.

1103
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:36,550
Nice to meet you, Todd.

1104
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:37,725
This is Christmas.

1105
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:39,248
You want to shake hands
with him, too?

1106
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:41,686
Uh... absolutely!

1107
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:43,731
Hi, there, Christmas.

1108
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:46,430
I've heard so
much about you.

1109
00:55:46,473 --> 00:55:47,387
Oh, hi.

1110
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:49,128
You must be
Todd's parents.

1111
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:52,392
-We are. I'm George McCray.
-Nice to meet you.

1112
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:53,698
-This is my wife, Mary Ann.
-Hi.
Hi.

1113
00:55:53,741 --> 00:55:55,482
Your son called
the station

1114
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:58,137
and he was quite persuasive.

1115
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,095
I did a little research,
and the station manager agreed

1116
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:03,664
that we should do a story
about the Adopt-A-Dog
for Christmas program.

1117
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,579
Can we come in and talk
to you all about it?

1118
00:56:05,623 --> 00:56:07,407
Yes. It's this way.

1119
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:08,234
Come here, boy.

1120
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:12,673
TODD:
Come here.

1121
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:14,414
CAMERAMAN:
Rolling.
Christmas--

1122
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,590
the happiest day
of the year, right?

1123
00:56:16,634 --> 00:56:19,158
At least that's what
we want it to be.

1124
00:56:19,201 --> 00:56:20,768
Every year, we rush around,

1125
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:23,336
trying to ensure that everything
is perfect for the big day--

1126
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,731
making lists, getting presents.

1127
00:56:26,774 --> 00:56:29,647
But what does Christmas
really mean?

1128
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:32,127
Tonight, we're going to talk
to a very special young man

1129
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:34,869
who found his own answer
to that question.

1130
00:56:34,913 --> 00:56:36,262
GEORGE:
Oh, there he is. There he is.

1131
00:56:36,305 --> 00:56:38,046
[Mary Ann cheers]

1132
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,048
BRIANNA:
When 20-year-old Todd McCray

1133
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:42,964
found out about
a program being offered

1134
00:56:43,008 --> 00:56:44,618
by the Santee County
animal shelter,

1135
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:47,142
the Adopt-A-Dog
for Christmas program,

1136
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:50,885
he knew it was something
he wanted to be involved in.

1137
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:53,714
Todd, would you tell us
about the Adopt-A -Dog program?

1138
00:56:53,758 --> 00:56:55,194
It's not really adopting.

1139
00:56:55,237 --> 00:56:59,764
You can adopt if you want
to, but you don't have to.

1140
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:02,419
You can just take a dog
home for Christmas.

1141
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:04,682
And why is it so important

1142
00:57:04,725 --> 00:57:07,336
for people to adopt a dog
for Christmas?

1143
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:11,340
Why wouldn't you?

1144
00:57:11,384 --> 00:57:14,169
The dogs don't have
moms or dads.

1145
00:57:14,213 --> 00:57:17,259
And... everybody needs
somebody to love them.

1146
00:57:17,303 --> 00:57:19,305
[Christmas groans]

1147
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:25,485
Especially at Christmas.

1148
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:29,315
It's like...
it's like the best gift.

1149
00:57:32,274 --> 00:57:33,362
Lucky dogs.

1150
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:35,539
Lucky people.

1151
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,891
So, let's all do what we can

1152
00:57:39,934 --> 00:57:42,328
to make Todd's dream come true.

1153
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,983
The shelter will be staying
open late the next few nights

1154
00:57:45,026 --> 00:57:47,464
and until noon on the 21st.

1155
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,161
Adopt-A-Dog for Christmas.

1156
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:53,208
This is Brianna Lewis,
for Channel 8 News.

1157
00:57:53,252 --> 00:57:55,297
Wow, that was...

1158
00:57:55,341 --> 00:57:58,431
[cheering]

1159
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,217
[laughing]

1160
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:03,523
You did real good, son.

1161
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:06,308
-Real good.
-It was wonderful!

1162
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:09,137
You were fabulous!

1163
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:10,661
So was Christmas!

1164
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:15,840
I'm just gonna go
stretch my legs.

1165
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:17,450
HANNAH:
You're a TV star now.

1166
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,844
[laughs]

1167
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:21,410
I'm so proud of you.

1168
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:46,305
[sighs]

1169
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,484
Post us out there
at 1400 hours.

1170
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,399
All right.
Got it.

1171
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:56,054
GEORGE: <i>

1183
00:59:48,802 --> 00:59:51,239
I think he likes
that dog, George.

1184
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:53,677
Well, you're
right about that.

1185
00:59:56,723 --> 00:59:59,247
How about you?

1186
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:02,076
Do you like the dog?

1187
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,557
Well, ye...

1188
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:09,127
Yeah, if you like furry types,
I guess he's all right.

1189
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:14,480
It's complicated.

1190
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:14,785
Mm-hmm.

1191
01:00:22,793 --> 01:00:26,405
Have I ever told you how much
your letters meant to me?

1192
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:30,496
You told me a thousand times.

1193
01:00:32,324 --> 01:00:35,370
I should have told you
a million times.

1194
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:56,087
It's cold.

1195
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,611
Come on.

Hey![Christmas barking]

1199
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:40,087
Todd did it!

1200
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:41,262
He did it!
Did what?

1201
01:01:41,306 --> 01:01:42,568
The phone's been ringing
off the hook

1202
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:44,613
the past couple days
and it hasn't stopped.

1203
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:47,486
Seems like everybody that was
watching TV the other night

1204
01:01:47,529 --> 01:01:50,402
decided that they could
suddenly foster a dog.

1205
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:51,838
He cleared out
the shelter!

1206
01:01:51,882 --> 01:01:54,058
That's wonderful,
Hayley.

1207
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:55,581
Todd, look what you did.

1208
01:01:55,624 --> 01:01:57,148
GEORGE:
Good for you.[whimpers]

1209
01:01:57,191 --> 01:01:59,672
Is that your dog?

1210
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,065
No, I was just locking up
when she was brought in.

1211
01:02:01,108 --> 01:02:03,763
My mom's in a nursing
home over in Wichita

1212
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:07,332
so looks like I'll have
some company for the road.

1213
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:08,246
Oh, yeah, keep you
from being bored.

1214
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:10,944
Yeah, you've got that right

1215
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:13,468
because she's about
to have puppies.

1216
01:02:16,036 --> 01:02:17,821
Maybe we should...

No, Mary... No...

at birthing animals!

You guys have done
enough already.

1220
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:24,436
It's too much.

1221
01:02:24,479 --> 01:02:25,263
She can't have puppies
in a car.

It's too much.

Sure.

I can't, but, um...

I can do?

Not that I can think of.

You want to get in your box?

1241
01:03:13,964 --> 01:03:16,227
Ruthie? Is that what Hayley
wanted us to call her?

1242
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:17,881
Who on earth would
name a dog Ruthie?

1243
01:03:17,924 --> 01:03:20,231
I would.

1244
01:03:20,274 --> 01:03:21,885
[yawning]

1245
01:03:24,975 --> 01:03:26,193
I'll be
out in the barn.

1246
01:03:26,237 --> 01:03:28,369
Oh, no. Ruthie!
Ruthie!

1247
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:30,981
[Ruthie barking]

1248
01:03:31,024 --> 01:03:32,069
Ruthie, come back!

1249
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:35,855
Ruthie! Oh, George!

1250
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:37,988
[barking]

1251
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:41,121
Ruthie!

1252
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:42,688
Ruthie, come here!

1253
01:03:42,731 --> 01:03:44,821
Why did you
let her out?!
I didn't.

1254
01:03:44,864 --> 01:03:46,648
She let herself out.

1255
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:47,954
Ruthie!

1256
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:51,349
TODD:

1257
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:55,353
Ruthie!

1258
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:57,485
Ruthie?

1259
01:03:57,529 --> 01:03:58,747
Here, Ruthie.
Here, girl.

1260
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:00,793
Where are you,
sweetheart?
Where are you?

1261
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,882
She's here!

1262
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:04,188
Oh, come on, Ruthie.

1263
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,015
Come back inside with us.

1264
01:04:05,058 --> 01:04:07,887
[whining]

1265
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:11,412
Mom, I think she wants to be
alone to have her babies.

1266
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:13,023
She'll freeze out here.

1267
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:15,025
No, Todd's right.

1268
01:04:15,068 --> 01:04:17,288
I'll get her food.

1269
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:23,207
Make up a bed.

1270
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:24,904
I'll figure out
some heat.
Okay.

1271
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:26,297
It's okay.

1272
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,125
We're gonna make you
a little bed.

1273
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:29,953
You'll be okay here.

1274
01:04:59,678 --> 01:05:01,810
[barking]

1275
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:04,291
Come on. Come on.

1276
01:05:04,335 --> 01:05:05,118
Yeah, we're coming,
we're coming.
Okay.

1277
01:05:05,162 --> 01:05:07,120
TODD:
Whoa.

1278
01:05:07,164 --> 01:05:10,645
[barking]

1279
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:12,299
GEORGE:
You can open
one present now,

1280
01:05:12,343 --> 01:05:15,128
but save the rest
for after Hannah gets here.

1281
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:18,262
Oh, here we go. Todd.

1282
01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:19,350
Ready?
Yeah.

1283
01:05:21,352 --> 01:05:24,703
-You got me new shoes!
-HANNAH:
Oh, sweet!

1284
01:05:24,746 --> 01:05:26,618
[laughs]

1285
01:05:26,661 --> 01:05:29,882
-It's a radio!
-You like it?

1286
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,405
GEORGE:
Have just... Ow.
MARY ANN:
You okay?

1287
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:32,972
Have that one.

1288
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:35,105
Just rip it!

1289
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:37,542
It's a tool chest
-for Dad.
-It matches my sweater.

1290
01:05:37,585 --> 01:05:39,500
Are there goodies?
Are there goodies?

1291
01:05:39,544 --> 01:05:40,980
TODD:
No, those aren't
good for you.

1292
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:42,547
Stop eating the cookies!

1293
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,375
[George laughing]

1294
01:05:47,204 --> 01:05:49,075
You can't do that.

1295
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,686
It's a paintbrush!

1296
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:53,079
-GEORGE: Oh!
-MARY ANN: Ooh!

1297
01:05:53,123 --> 01:05:54,951
See!
MARY ANN:
Very nice!

1298
01:05:54,994 --> 01:05:55,429
Come here, sweetie.

1299
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:56,996
[laughter]

1300
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,434
GEORGE:
-Oh, nice.
-It's so many colors!

1301
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:01,958
It looks good
on Christmas.

1302
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:02,871
Oh, it looks good.

1303
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:04,525
-It's beautiful!
-TODD:
What is that?

1304
01:06:04,569 --> 01:06:05,962
What is it?

1305
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:07,485
-With Hannah's help.
-You did not pick this.

1306
01:06:07,528 --> 01:06:09,400
-Well, Hannah helped me a little.
-Hannah picked this.

1307
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:11,141
MARY ANN:
This is very sweet.

1308
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:13,099
Mom wrapped it.

1309
01:06:13,143 --> 01:06:15,188
[straining]:
Oh, she did a
really good job.

1310
01:06:15,232 --> 01:06:17,364
Hmm...

1311
01:06:17,408 --> 01:06:18,844
Yeah, it's my favorite...

1312
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:19,976
-I found it at the river.
-Oh!

1313
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:21,151
It's my favorite one
that I saw there.

1314
01:06:21,194 --> 01:06:23,414
Oh, I love it.

1315
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,114
Yeah.
Okay.

1316
01:06:28,158 --> 01:06:31,161
Oh, there you go.

1317
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:33,076
Yeah.
Oh!
Snap.

1318
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,036
You're so fast.
Uh-oh,
uh-oh.

1319
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,907
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh...

1320
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:41,040
[all laughing]

1321
01:06:45,262 --> 01:06:47,090
[whining]

1322
01:06:53,574 --> 01:06:55,533
TODD:
What was your
favorite present?

1323
01:06:55,576 --> 01:06:57,448
Um, the stone. What else?

1324
01:06:57,491 --> 01:06:58,753
Bye, Mom.
Bye.

1325
01:06:58,797 --> 01:07:00,277
Thanks for all
the amazing food.

1326
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,147
-Thanks, sweetie.
-Bye, Dad.

1327
01:07:01,191 --> 01:07:03,193
Drive safely, honey.

1328
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:04,629
-I will.
-Bye, Hannah.

1329
01:07:04,672 --> 01:07:05,934
Bye, Todd.
-See you guys soon.
-You can go ahead now.

1330
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:08,546
Bye.
Hey, away
from the table.

1331
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:10,243
The pineapple.
Okay.

1332
01:07:10,287 --> 01:07:12,898
Get the pineapple
on a fork.

1333
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:15,640
Remember how to
do this? You dip?

1334
01:07:15,683 --> 01:07:17,468
Oh.
Go ahead.

1335
01:07:23,387 --> 01:07:25,563
Hi, Ruthie.

1336
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:29,871
Brought you some water.

1337
01:07:29,915 --> 01:07:32,048
Here.

1338
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:33,484
You thirsty?

1339
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:36,400
I got you a Christmas present.

1340
01:07:36,443 --> 01:07:38,445
Can you guess what it is?

1341
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:40,186
It's a bone.

1342
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:43,233
You like it?

1343
01:07:43,276 --> 01:07:45,235
Here you go.

1344
01:07:49,282 --> 01:07:51,371
You want one, too?

1345
01:07:51,415 --> 01:07:53,678
All right.

1346
01:07:56,681 --> 01:08:00,380
[barking]
Come here, Christmas.

1347
01:08:00,424 --> 01:08:01,642
Come here.

1348
01:08:03,601 --> 01:08:06,125
Good boy!

1349
01:08:06,169 --> 01:08:08,040
Come here, Christmas.

1350
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:08,171
Come here.

1351
01:08:09,259 --> 01:08:12,175
TODD:
Come here.

1352
01:08:12,218 --> 01:08:14,177
George?

1353
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:18,094
Mm-hmm?

1354
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:20,966
It was a perfect day.

1355
01:08:24,317 --> 01:08:27,320
It was.

1356
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:36,677
What are you going to do
about Christmas tomorrow?

1357
01:08:40,246 --> 01:08:41,291
Christmas was today.

1358
01:08:41,334 --> 01:08:46,296
You know what I mean.

1359
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:55,000
The easy thing would be
to let Todd keep him.

1360
01:08:55,043 --> 01:08:58,177
The easy thing is not
always the best thing.

1361
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:04,792
Why not?

1362
01:09:04,836 --> 01:09:08,274
Why wouldn't it be
the best thing?

1363
01:09:08,318 --> 01:09:13,584
Because he has
to learn...

1364
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:16,108
About loss?

1365
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,677
Life will teach him
about loss, George.

1366
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:22,593
We made the agreement.

1367
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:27,206
Todd and I.

1368
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:32,080
To go back on that agreement
is not going to help him

1369
01:09:32,124 --> 01:09:35,214
turn into a stronger,
more independent person.

1370
01:09:35,258 --> 01:09:36,563
If you and I are soft,

1371
01:09:36,607 --> 01:09:38,913
he'll expect the
world to be soft,

1372
01:09:38,957 --> 01:09:42,134
and he'll be in for
a rude awakening.

1373
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,617
You know what I think?

1374
01:09:49,446 --> 01:09:53,058
I think you're afraid.

1375
01:09:56,017 --> 01:09:58,237
This is about what's
best for Todd.

1376
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:00,326
If you say so.

1377
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:03,286
What does that mean?

1378
01:10:07,377 --> 01:10:08,639
Nothing.

1379
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:39,844
PENDLETON:
So, McCray, what's she like?

1380
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:41,280
GEORGE:
Too good for you.

1381
01:10:41,324 --> 01:10:42,760
Hey, how you doing,
Charlie?

1382
01:10:42,803 --> 01:10:44,457
-Hey, boy.
-Hey, Charlie.
Good, boy.

1383
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:45,763
-What's up, buddy.
-You a lucky man.

1384
01:10:45,806 --> 01:10:48,418
[barks]
Hey, boy.

1385
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:49,593
What about you?

1386
01:10:49,636 --> 01:10:51,290
You got yourself a girl?

1387
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:53,771
Boy, I get lots of girls.[Charlie barking]

1388
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:55,425
But not one that
writes me every day.

1389
01:10:55,468 --> 01:10:56,774
What's wrong, Charlie?

1390
01:10:56,817 --> 01:10:59,690

What is it?

[pained groans]

1397
01:11:12,442 --> 01:11:15,532
Hey, McCray, good news.
Uh, you're going home.

1398
01:11:15,575 --> 01:11:17,969
GEORGE [hoarsely]:
Where's my dog?

1399
01:11:18,012 --> 01:11:19,275
I-I have to find him.

1400
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:22,147
Whoa, whoa, whoa, take
it easy, take it easy.

1401
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,496
Get him
on the chopper, guys.

1402
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:24,715
-I've got to find him.
-It's gonna be
all right.

1403
01:11:24,758 --> 01:11:26,325
You're going home.
[grunts]

1404
01:11:26,369 --> 01:11:27,805
I gotta find my dog!

-I don't know.

1412
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:52,264
-We don't know, honey.
-Christmas is barking.

1413
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,700
I know.
-Why is he barking?
-No, no, wait, wait.

1414
01:11:53,744 --> 01:11:55,920
-Okay, okay.

01:21:30,276 --> 01:21:34,933
Well, if you change your mind
call me by 5:00 tonight.

1594
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:37,457
Hayley, thank-thank you
so much for everything.

1595
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:39,459
We're so proud.

1596
01:21:39,503 --> 01:21:41,809
Oh, you're more than welcome.

1597
01:21:41,853 --> 01:21:43,115
Well, okay. Yeah.

1598
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:45,161
Bye-bye.

1599
01:21:45,204 --> 01:21:46,292
I told you.

1600
01:21:46,336 --> 01:21:48,425
What did you tell me?

1601
01:21:48,468 --> 01:21:51,428
Well, I-I was right.

1602
01:21:51,471 --> 01:21:53,430
Taking the dog back.

1603
01:21:53,473 --> 01:21:54,910
I mean...

1604
01:21:54,953 --> 01:21:56,085
teaching Todd to
deal with this

1605
01:21:56,128 --> 01:21:57,347
like an adult--
it paid off.

1606
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:59,958
It was just like
-I hoped.
-Just like you...?

1607
01:22:00,002 --> 01:22:01,960
Our son

1608
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:04,963
wasn't offered this job
because of anything you did.

1609
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:06,965
It's because of what he did.

1610
01:22:07,009 --> 01:22:10,534
And making him take the dog back
was not some grand,

1611
01:22:10,577 --> 01:22:13,493
character-shaping event
for Todd.

1612
01:22:13,537 --> 01:22:15,539
You're a fool

1613
01:22:15,582 --> 01:22:18,368
for not keeping that dog.

1614
01:22:22,285 --> 01:22:24,113
[door closes]

1615
01:22:25,331 --> 01:22:27,246
GEORGE:
And I just wanted Todd
to understand

1616
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:30,597
how important it is
he keep his word.

1617
01:22:30,641 --> 01:22:32,077
You know, and besides,
with the job

1618
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:34,471
at the shelter, he's going to be
with dogs all day long.

1619
01:22:34,514 --> 01:22:36,125
Makes sense.

1620
01:22:36,168 --> 01:22:38,344
Hand me that lubricant,
would you?

1621
01:22:39,867 --> 01:22:42,566
You know, it's a big deal
Todd getting this job.

1622
01:22:42,609 --> 01:22:45,830
And I feel like I...

1623
01:22:45,873 --> 01:22:48,659
me caving in
is just a big step backward.

1624
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:53,185
Sounds like you're trying to
convince yourself of something.

1625
01:22:53,229 --> 01:22:54,491
I could be wrong,

1626
01:22:54,534 --> 01:22:57,973
but Todd having this dog
or not having this dog

1627
01:22:58,016 --> 01:22:59,975
isn't going to make a blind
bit of difference,

1628
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:02,455
not in the long run,
at least not to Todd.

1629
01:23:03,282 --> 01:23:06,720
Getting this dog would
be good for you.

1630
01:23:06,764 --> 01:23:08,722
It's not about me.

1631
01:23:08,766 --> 01:23:10,115
It isn't?

1632
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,857
Seems to me this has everything
to do with you

1633
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,947
and nothing to do with Todd.

1634
01:23:18,036 --> 01:23:19,820
You forget who
you're talking to?

1635
01:23:19,864 --> 01:23:21,648
I was here when
you were a boy

1636
01:23:21,692 --> 01:23:23,302
running around with
that dog of yours.

1637
01:23:23,346 --> 01:23:27,524
And I was here when you
got back from the war.

1638
01:23:27,567 --> 01:23:29,178
With a lid on things.

1639
01:23:29,221 --> 01:23:30,048
All bottled up.

1640
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,529
Doesn't have to stay
that way forever.

1641
01:23:32,572 --> 01:23:35,967
You get to be my age,
you're going to regret it.

1642
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,838
I don't think
it's such a bad thing

1643
01:23:37,882 --> 01:23:39,536
for you to let a dog
back in your life.

1644
01:23:39,579 --> 01:23:43,061
I suppose I could be wrong.

1645
01:24:03,864 --> 01:24:05,823
[horn honks]

1646
01:24:07,999 --> 01:24:09,044
Hi, Dad.

1647
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:11,655
Hi.

1648
01:24:11,698 --> 01:24:14,658
Mom says that this
is her favorite color.

1649
01:24:14,701 --> 01:24:16,399
Oh.

1650
01:24:17,878 --> 01:24:19,141
Have you told him
about the call?

1651
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:21,099
Not yet.

1652
01:24:21,143 --> 01:24:22,492
Why don't you
go ahead.

1653
01:24:23,145 --> 01:24:27,671
You have a job, starting Monday.

1654
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:30,891
I do?

1655
01:24:30,935 --> 01:24:31,979
Mm-hmm.

1656
01:24:32,023 --> 01:24:33,503
At the shelter.

1657
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:36,549
Yeah, Hayley
was so impressed

1658
01:24:36,593 --> 01:24:38,595
with the way you handled
the Christmas dog program

1659
01:24:38,638 --> 01:24:41,902
that I guess she wanted to
snap you up before somebody else

1660
01:24:41,946 --> 01:24:43,165
could get you.

1661
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:45,123
Do I get to drive to work

1662
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:46,168
on my own now?

1663
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:47,517
I have my
learner's permit.

1664
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:49,693
When you
get your license.

1665
01:24:50,563 --> 01:24:51,825
Can I use second gear?

1666
01:24:51,869 --> 01:24:54,263
Well, yeah. You'll learn
to use all the gears.

1667
01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:55,612
Thanks, Dad.

1668
01:24:55,655 --> 01:24:58,658
Oh, we're so proud
of you, Todd.

1669
01:24:58,702 --> 01:25:00,965
I'm really proud
of you.

1670
01:25:01,008 --> 01:25:02,445
Really proud.

1671
01:25:03,446 --> 01:25:05,143
And I've been thinking...

1672
01:25:05,187 --> 01:25:08,146
that with you
having a job,

1673
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:12,498
things might get kind of lonely
for me around here.

1674
01:25:12,542 --> 01:25:13,934
I'm sorry, Dad.

1675
01:25:13,978 --> 01:25:15,153
No, it's-it's okay.

1676
01:25:15,197 --> 01:25:16,720
It's just that, uh...

1677
01:25:16,763 --> 01:25:19,157
You know the way
I always thought how...

1678
01:25:19,201 --> 01:25:22,682
family pets don't work out well
on a working farm and...

1679
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:26,686
I don't think that anymore.

1680
01:25:29,385 --> 01:25:32,388
I think maybe I need a dog.

1681
01:25:32,431 --> 01:25:35,217
You know, keep me company
when you're at work.

1682
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:37,567
What do you think?

1683
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:40,265
I think Christmas would be
a really good dog for you.

1684
01:25:40,309 --> 01:25:41,745
[laughing]:
Well, you're...

1685
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:43,747
you're a good dog picker,
you know that?

1686
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:44,878
Yes.

1687
01:25:44,922 --> 01:25:46,880
Yes, you are.

1688
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:51,494
Well, I guess, then...

1689
01:25:51,537 --> 01:25:53,104
you should drive,

1690
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,759
because I can't be
running you to and fro

1691
01:25:55,802 --> 01:25:57,717
when you have
this job all the time.

1692
01:25:57,761 --> 01:25:59,066
So, maybe you better...

1693
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:02,679
Do we have to stay
in first gear the whole way?

1694
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:04,985
No, we have to be there
before 5:00.

1695
01:26:05,029 --> 01:26:05,986
[Mary Ann laughing]

1696
01:26:07,205 --> 01:26:08,946
No, I'll teach you
how to shift into second.

1697
01:26:18,956 --> 01:26:20,262
[engine starting]

1698
01:26:21,654 --> 01:26:22,525
[gears grinding]

1699
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,138
[laughing]

1700
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,792
GEORGE: <i>No, keep... keep the clutch out.</i>

1701
01:26:28,835 --> 01:26:29,836
[gears grinding]
TODD: <i>
Uh-oh.</i>

1702
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:31,751
<i>Keep the clutch out. That's it.</i>

1703
01:26:31,795 --> 01:26:34,493
<i>Foot off the brake.</i>

1704
01:26:34,537 --> 01:26:35,755
<i>Look at the road.</i>

1705
01:26:35,799 --> 01:26:37,496
<i>Like this? Yes.</i>

1706
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,585
<i>Dad?</i>

1707
01:26:39,629 --> 01:26:40,804
<i>There's a turn
coming up.</i>

1708
01:26:40,847 --> 01:26:42,109
<i>That's it, that's it.</i>

1709
01:26:42,153 --> 01:26:43,633
<i>Foot off the brake.</i>

1710
01:26:43,676 --> 01:26:44,416
<i>That's it. Okay.</i>

1711
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:46,288
<i>It's all right now.</i>

1712
01:26:46,331 --> 01:26:47,463
<i>Check your side mirror.</i>

1713
01:26:47,506 --> 01:26:49,160
Somebody's behind me.[horn honking]

1714
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,335
Yeah, just let him
go by.

1715
01:26:50,379 --> 01:26:51,380
Okay.

1716
01:26:51,423 --> 01:26:52,642
<i>Slow down, slow down.</i>

1717
01:26:52,685 --> 01:26:55,253
<i>That's right. Good.[horn honking]</i>

1718
01:26:55,297 --> 01:26:58,038
Yep, that's good.
Bye!

1719
01:26:58,082 --> 01:26:59,126
Yeah, okay.

1720
01:27:00,519 --> 01:27:01,651
Good idea to stay
on the right-hand side.
Okay.

1721
01:27:03,435 --> 01:27:04,393
<i>Okay, clutch in.</i>

1722
01:27:04,436 --> 01:27:07,483
<i>Brake on.</i>

1723
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:10,094
<i>I'm a good driver, huh?</i>

1724
01:27:10,137 --> 01:27:11,313
<i>Yeah.</i>

1725
01:27:11,356 --> 01:27:12,923
<i>I'll drive home.</i>

1726
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:22,628
[bells ringing]

[dogs barking]

1728

WOMAN:
I told you the fence needed
fixing two days ago.

1729
01:27:28,068 --> 01:27:29,331
HAYLEY:
I thought you were
going to take care of it.

1730
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:32,029
With the holidays,
it was hard to get someone out.

1731
01:27:32,072 --> 01:27:33,030
GEORGE:
Hayley?

1732
01:27:33,073 --> 01:27:34,292
TODD:
Hayley?

1733
01:27:34,336 --> 01:27:35,685
I'll try again.

1734
01:27:35,728 --> 01:27:37,382
Mr. McCray, Todd.

1735
01:27:37,426 --> 01:27:39,341
Well, we're... we're here.

1736
01:27:42,996 --> 01:27:47,087
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this, but, uh...

1737
01:27:47,131 --> 01:27:51,004
there was a weak spot
in the dog run, and, um...

1738
01:27:51,048 --> 01:27:54,312
apparently,
Christmas found it.

1739
01:27:57,707 --> 01:27:59,361
He's gone?

1740
01:27:59,404 --> 01:28:00,405
He's gone.

1741
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:03,452
Christmas ran away?

1742
01:28:03,495 --> 01:28:05,715
I'm so sorry.

1743
01:28:08,065 --> 01:28:11,068
Well, what...
what time was this?

1744
01:28:12,374 --> 01:28:13,679
Hours ago.

1745
01:28:13,723 --> 01:28:17,422
Jennifer's been looking
for him since about 2:30.

1746
01:28:17,466 --> 01:28:19,859
Could be anywhere
by now.

1747
01:28:24,124 --> 01:28:25,343
Mr. McCray, if he shows up,

1748
01:28:25,387 --> 01:28:27,389
I'll call you
straightaway.

1749
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:29,173
You have my word.

1750
01:28:30,392 --> 01:28:31,480
Thank you, Hayley.

1751
01:28:31,523 --> 01:28:33,743
[dogs barking]

1752
01:28:51,413 --> 01:28:54,285
[sighs]

1753
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,331
[engine starting]

1754
01:29:05,296 --> 01:29:06,906
Don't worry, Dad.

1755
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:10,040
Christmas can take care
of himself.

1756
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:12,434
That's the way it works
with him.

1757
01:29:20,572 --> 01:29:22,444
That's how it works
with him.

1758
01:29:41,506 --> 01:29:43,334
You just missed
Jean and Hank.

1759
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:46,424
They came by to pick up
Ruthie and the puppies.

1760
01:29:46,468 --> 01:29:48,644
They're adopting them all.

1761
01:29:48,687 --> 01:29:49,427
What's wrong?
Where's Christmas?

1762
01:29:49,471 --> 01:29:51,734
Gone.

1763
01:29:51,777 --> 01:29:53,779
There was a hole
in the fence

1764
01:29:53,823 --> 01:29:55,564
at the shelter, and he ran away.

1765
01:29:55,607 --> 01:29:56,826
Oh, no.

1766
01:29:58,523 --> 01:30:01,352
