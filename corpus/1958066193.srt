1
00:00:16,849 --> 00:00:18,267
People of Bhutan,

2
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:23,188
I have advised the government

3
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:30,505
to stop all taxes on personal income.

4
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:37,804
This should make you happy.

5
00:00:37,828 --> 00:00:42,082
The introduction of TV and internet

6
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:44,668
in Bhutan

7
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:50,257
is a true sign of Bhutan's
modernization and development.

8
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:56,740
But I would like to caution
the youth of Bhutan.

9
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:59,224
The TV and the internet,

10
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:02,102
in its news and programs,

11
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:04,813
has contents that are both harmful

12
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:08,567
and useful to you and your country.

13
00:01:08,692 --> 00:01:12,279
For this reason, we must be

14
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:15,741
very careful and selective

15
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:19,244
in using this new resource.

16
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:26,001
Nevertheless I have decided

17
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:28,879
to allow the access
of internet and TV

18
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:32,174
in our Kingdom.

19
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:37,262
I hope this will bring great benefits
to the people of Bhutan.

20
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:57,282
Nothing I have ever said until now
has made you applaud.

21
00:01:57,407 --> 00:02:00,828
I had to introduce TV and internet
to get applause.

22
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,218
<i>My dear beloved father</i>

23
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:01,054
<i>Let there be no worries
in your heart</i>

24
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,225
<i>Instead let there be
happiness and peace</i>

25
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,897
<i>Who am I going to live with
in this world?</i>

26
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:15,235
<i>Who am I going to live with
in this world?</i>

27
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:20,324
Mother, when you harvest barley,
does it cut your fingers?

28
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:21,783
Yes, sometimes.

29
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,786
Mother, let's swap sickles.

30
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:27,414
If we swap,
you might cut your hands.

31
00:03:28,957 --> 00:03:30,375
Mine's even sharper.

32
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,462
- No worries.
- Mine is less comfortable.

33
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:37,966
You're funny. How can you harvest
if you keep swapping sickles?

34
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:48,977
I saw workmen carrying
electric poles in the valley.

35
00:03:49,102 --> 00:03:53,106
- So did I.
- They're making fast progress.

36
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:56,276
They've also started
working on the road.

37
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:01,823
In a few years, tourists
will be visiting us by car.

38
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:11,583
- We'll have electricity next year.
- You're right.

39
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,172
Youngsters will have a better life.

40
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,678
But I'm worried about
the electricity bill.

41
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:24,888
I hope it will be reasonable!

42
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:55,220
Brother, I asked you to come
so we could discuss something.

43
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:53,619
Is suffering with me.

44
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:56,313
I feel that Peyangki

45
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:07,866
I want him to join the monastery.

46
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:18,102
I think you're right.

47
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:20,462
It could be useful for the family, too.

48
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:23,632
You should take him
the day after tomorrow.

49
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:31,973
I was planning to take him tomorrow.

50
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,976
- Take him the day after tomorrow.
- OK.

51
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:44,520
It'll be an auspicious day.

52
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:53,995
The rain has stopped.

53
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:59,918
Yes, brother, it will be cold today.

54
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:03,338
<i>Winter is about to begin.</i>

55
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,042
Did you look after the yaks well?

56
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:46,756
- Did you count them?
- Yes. I put them in their pen.

57
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,092
Can I burn this?

58
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,220
You're always playing with a ball.

59
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:55,390
- No, I'm not.
- I don't know about that.

60
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:01,771
I need to talk to you about something.

61
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:03,690
Yes?

62
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:09,279
I'm thinking of sending you to
the monastery so you'll become a monk.

63
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:12,991
What do you think?

64
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:14,284
I don't want to.

65
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:18,955
I can't afford
to send you to school.

66
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,625
You'll be very happy
in the monastery.

67
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:30,425
If you go to the monastery,
I don't have to spend anything.

68
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:36,348
Once you're a monk,
you'll get food and clothes for free.

69
00:08:40,018 --> 00:08:43,688
You can benefit me
and a lot of others in the future.

70
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,863
Right now, I can't afford
to send you to school.

71
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:56,743
And when you're older,
it will be even more expensive.

72
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,920
I won't always be here.

73
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:11,007
You'll have to look
after yourself someday.

74
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:05,478
- You want him to become a monk?
- Yes.

75
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,772
Why? He'd be better off in school.

76
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:12,110
He doesn't want to go to school.

77
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:23,163
I see. You think it's better
for him to become a monk?

78
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,414
Yes, sir.

79
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,584
OK, that's good.

80
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,545
- There's no need for that.
- Please accept it.

81
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,213
It isn't necessary.

82
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:35,550
Change his clothes then.

83
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:39,095
You won't change your mind?

84
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:43,433
Some parents take their child
back home just after a month.

85
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:45,518
I won't.

86
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:50,458
He'll be very fortunate to be here.

87
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:55,087
I have two daughters
and four sons.

88
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:58,990
Their father passed away,
so it's very difficult for me.

89
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,626
You can come and visit me.

90
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,796
The house isn't far away.

91
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:17,801
Serve the Lama with full dedication.

92
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:20,053
Listen to him

93
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:22,597
and do as he says.

94
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:26,601
I trust in you completely.
Be a good boy.

95
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:37,270
Prostrate yourself three times.

96
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,308
With full dedication.

97
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,936
Pray for every sentient being.

98
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,715
Pray and promise to serve
every sentient being.

99
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:03,930
And to overcome any obstacle
during your study.

100
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:07,183
May I be a good devotee
blessed with every wish.

101
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:13,082
- That's all.
- Thank you, sir.

102
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:16,860
Peyangki, it's time for me to leave.

103
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:21,030
Be a good boy and a dedicated monk.

104
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,574
Good luck.

105
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,480
It's time to go and herd the yaks.

106
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:37,524
Yes, uncle, it's time.

107
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:42,862
It will be difficult after dark
when we can't see a thing.

108
00:13:42,987 --> 00:13:44,113
Yes, uncle.

109
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:48,076
After dark, all we can do
is curse the darkness.

110
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:59,295
I'll sell a yak in the city
and buy a TV with the money.

111
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:03,466
That's smart, you'll be ready
when the electricity arrives.

112
00:14:04,717 --> 00:14:08,388
People will love watching TV.

113
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,349
You can even make money with your TV.

114
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:15,895
People will come and pay to watch it.

115
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:20,942
In the city, they have
different kinds of TVs, big and small.

116
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:25,530
Try to bring back
the biggest one!

117
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:30,201
A big screen
will be more entertaining.

118
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:32,537
Much more entertaining.

119
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:40,295
If I sell a yak,
I can buy a TV too?

120
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,214
Yes, if you manage to sell one.

121
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:46,175
Then I should do it as well.

122
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:48,261
If you go to the city...

123
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,809
there are lots of places
where you can sell yaks.

124
00:14:56,644 --> 00:15:04,644
I also want to sell a yak
to buy a TV.

125
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:02,710
I'll watch it and my kids, too.

126
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,111
I want my own TV.

127
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:16,623
Then I can leave them at home.

128
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:19,417
Baby, do you want to watch TV?

129
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,462
Then I can go and herd the yaks.

130
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,923
It'll be great like that.

131
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:09,008
<i>Compassion</i> comes

132
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:13,638
<i>from the transcendental wisdom...</i>

133
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:19,769
<i>the transcendental wisdom...</i>

134
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,272
<i>the transcendental wisdom...</i>

135
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:26,985
<i>of all the Buddhas,</i>

136
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,947
<i>past, present and future.</i>

137
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:33,324
<i>The transcendental wisdom...</i>

138
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:49,007
Tell Khorey to come.

139
00:16:52,093 --> 00:16:53,302
Sit.

140
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:01,477
We used to be eight monks,
now we're three.

141
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:05,273
The other five left for the city
and I don't know why.

142
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:09,944
Maybe for studies, the TV,
electricity, or other comforts.

143
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:14,574
They probably had
their own reasons for leaving.

144
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:19,787
They say it was to study,
but who knows their true motives!

145
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:23,374
Do you have a desire to go to the city?

146
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:25,102
Yes, master.

147
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,045
Why?

148
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,338
We want to watch TV.

149
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:34,177
- You expect TV to make you happy?
- Yes, master.

150
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:36,429
Is that so?

151
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,018
What you see and hear on TV
can influence a mind negatively.

152
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,896
Our ignorance of worldly ways

153
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:48,858
has allowed us to stay focused
on studying prayer

154
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:52,111
and not doing bad deeds.

155
00:17:54,155 --> 00:17:56,741
If ever you meet the five monks,

156
00:17:56,866 --> 00:18:01,412
they may tell you that
it's great to be in the city,

157
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:04,874
because of the TV
and the delicious food.

158
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:09,629
But don't listen to them,
they've been badly influenced.

159
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:13,007
Only stray people leave for the city.

160
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:17,970
So if you stay and live here,
you'll become a good person.

161
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,209
Prostrate yourself.

162
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,605
Light the butter lamp.

163
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:36,817
Put it over there.

164
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:43,658
- Must I cover my mouth?
- Yes.

165
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:47,870
- Let me do it.
- OK.

166
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:51,874
You must do it properly.

167
00:20:54,543 --> 00:20:57,713
You'll like this place.

168
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:00,675
You'll study all day long.

169
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,135
It'll be useful when you grow up.

170
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:09,392
It's hard for our teacher
to always be here.

171
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:12,955
He has to do the rituals in the village.

172
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:16,941
But we can wake up early and study hard.

173
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:21,737
Why did you join the monastery?

174
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,322
My father died.

175
00:21:24,323 --> 00:21:28,077
So my mother decided
I should come here.

176
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:31,497
She has to look after the yaks.

177
00:21:31,622 --> 00:21:35,793
How come your dad passed away?

178
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:38,188
He encountered a bear.

179
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:39,797
- A bear?
- Yes.

180
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:47,179
He was alone in the forest

181
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:51,118
when he encountered the bear.

182
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:55,896
He had a heart attack and died.

183
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:59,608
So your mum sent you here.

184
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:07,283
Otherwise I'd be alone
when she takes care of the yaks.

185
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:12,079
She said I'd have a better life
if I joined the monastery.

186
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:14,999
That's how I became a monk.

187
00:22:19,712 --> 00:22:22,298
It's good that you came here.

188
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:30,890
How many have you cleaned?

189
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:33,642
Almost three.

190
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,747
Only three?

191
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:42,443
I've only cleaned two.
Can I count yours as mine too?

192
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:45,613
I thought you'd clean them all.

193
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:49,158
I'll let you win.

194
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:23,168
<i>I don't see what the problem is.</i>

195
00:23:23,192 --> 00:23:25,629
He doesn't understand.

196
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:28,030
Tell him to come up here and see.

197
00:23:28,155 --> 00:23:31,155
We can't go through houses, it's simple!

198
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:35,830
It's not like on the map at all.

199
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:37,611
It's a big mess.

200
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:40,154
A big mess.

201
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:01,767
So you finally bought a TV!

202
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:06,647
Yes, it's very fragile
and difficult to carry on a horse.

203
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:09,817
It fell off, I think it's broken.

204
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:15,281
I should hit you for not taking care
of such an expensive thing!

205
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:19,451
Whatever you do, you're useless!

206
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:26,333
Why are you always like that?

207
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:29,587
I'll never be able to watch TV now.

208
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:44,018
Please calm down.
I'll buy a better TV next time.

209
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:58,616
I'll buy a better one
and we'll enjoy watching it.

210
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:18,260
Like this...

211
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:38,739
No, like this...

212
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,950
Your lips a bit higher and blow.

213
00:27:53,837 --> 00:27:56,548
Try to make the same sound as me.

214
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:59,718
Move your lips up a bit.

215
00:30:15,437 --> 00:30:17,189
Keep us safe.

216
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:35,916
What's that?

217
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,292
I don't know.

218
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:44,758
- Are you happy today?
- Yes.

219
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:51,181
Do you like playing or studying?

220
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:52,808
Studying.

221
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:59,690
If you like studying then study.

222
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:05,904
- What kind of wife do you want?
- A goddess.

223
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:07,990
- A goddess?
- Yes. And you?

224
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:10,200
I don't want a wife.

225
00:31:10,325 --> 00:31:12,870
- You must have a type!
- No.

226
00:31:12,995 --> 00:31:17,958
- Then I don't want a wife either.
- You said you wanted a goddess!

227
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,753
Because you asked me.
Otherwise I wouldn't have said.

228
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:24,756
- Liar!
- You're the one who's lying.

229
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:29,511
You're surrounded by beauties.
There's no escape for you.

230
00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:39,813
To me, it's a river full of stones!

231
00:31:39,938 --> 00:31:44,693
But if a goddess makes you happy,
that's OK by me!

232
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:47,112
I doubt I'll find one.

233
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:52,826
Kids like you
always want to find a wife.

234
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:56,288
But I'm not interested in such things.

235
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:59,082
- Not interested?
- Let's sleep now.

236
00:32:15,974 --> 00:32:22,397
<i>Compassion</i> comes...

237
00:32:26,526 --> 00:32:34,526
<i>from the transcendental wisdom...</i>

238
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:39,665
<i>of all the Buddhas</i>

239
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,960
<i>past, present and future.</i>

240
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:49,216
<i>Compassion comes from...</i>

241
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:51,927
<i>the transcendental wisdom...</i>

242
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:58,308
<i>The transcendental wisdom...</i>

243
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,749
Stop bothering me!

244
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,627
Just let me sweep!

245
00:34:07,753 --> 00:34:09,212
What did you say?

246
00:34:09,337 --> 00:34:10,756
Shut up!

247
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:13,842
- I'm trying to scare you.
- I said shut up!

248
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:20,682
Why would I be scared of you?

249
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,815
I'm not listening.
You sound like an idiot.

250
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:04,119
<i>I've given all my love for you</i>

251
00:36:04,244 --> 00:36:09,916
<i>I'll keep faith in you</i>

252
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:21,469
<i>Your beauty is everything to me</i>

253
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,749
Hands down!

254
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:57,756
Students, attention!

255
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:01,593
Hands together, pray for wisdom!
One, two, three!

256
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:07,724
<i>Om Ara Banza Na Dhe</i>

257
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:09,809
<i>Affectionate Buddha</i>

258
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:13,355
<i>May the rays of light
of your supreme omniscience</i>

259
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:18,109
<i>Clear the darkness of naivety
from my mind</i>

260
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:38,022
Use Thinley's bow.
Thinley, give him your bow.

261
00:37:38,046 --> 00:37:40,298
Thinley's bow is stiff.

262
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:02,779
Pass me the bowl

263
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:26,177
- Do you guys like school?
- Yes.

264
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:28,096
What about the monastery?

265
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:32,517
No. It's no fun. School's fun.

266
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:37,439
Monks aren't supposed to do archery.

267
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:40,608
I sneaked out of the monastery.

268
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:44,529
I love archery
and I'm not allowed to do it there.

269
00:38:44,654 --> 00:38:50,511
So I sneaked out.

270
00:38:50,535 --> 00:38:47,925
Archery's fun, isn't it?

271
00:38:47,949 --> 00:38:49,242
Oh, right.

272
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:58,960
A bull's eye and you lose your points!

273
00:38:59,085 --> 00:39:01,463
Hey, that's my bowl

274
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:06,009
- Where does Nupchu live?
- Near the herding place?

275
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:08,154
We were meant to
join school together.

276
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,888
- Hey, guys!
- What?

277
00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:12,766
- This is my bow, right?
- Which one?

278
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:15,643
The one he's holding.

279
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:18,772
He's trying to take it.

280
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:36,039
Monk, go pray
instead of mining my weaving.

281
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:56,393
<i>My dear beloved father</i>

282
00:39:56,518 --> 00:39:59,479
<i>Let there be no worries in your heart</i>

283
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:04,877
<i>Instead let there be
happiness and peace</i>

284
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:09,423
Who am I going to live with
in this world?

285
00:40:09,447 --> 00:40:12,325
This little boy
keeps playing with my loom!

286
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,371
I'm not a little boy.
I'm a big boy now.

287
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,606
Your brother's going to get married.

288
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,275
Mum, I want to leave the monastery.

289
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:30,969
Where else would you go?

290
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:33,555
The Lama beats me.

291
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:44,149
His wife may not let you
stay here anymore.

292
00:40:44,941 --> 00:40:48,778
You don't have a father.
Things may become difficult.

293
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:51,573
It's best if you stay.

294
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:54,033
Then I want to change monasteries.

295
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,746
If you go elsewhere,
it might be the same thing.

296
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:02,500
Please stay where I sent you.

297
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:03,918
Alright?

298
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:09,340
It's for the best.

299
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:15,221
You're too young
to think of going elsewhere.

300
00:41:15,388 --> 00:41:20,977
- I want to go to Gasa.
- Maybe in 4 or 5 years.

301
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:25,523
Once you've finished your studies,
you can go elsewhere.

302
00:41:25,648 --> 00:41:30,487
Right now, at your age,
how can you leave?

303
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:32,822
I'll go to Gasa.

304
00:41:32,947 --> 00:41:37,535
Gasa is very strict.

305
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,998
You may not be able to cope
with the discipline.

306
00:41:43,374 --> 00:41:46,711
If you go to Gasa,

307
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:51,299
I'll have to travel far to visit you.

308
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:55,136
And you'll miss me.

309
00:41:56,346 --> 00:42:00,225
But if you're nearby,
we can meet from time to time.

310
00:42:03,478 --> 00:42:05,730
Why the grief-stricken mood?

311
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:08,441
Come on, be strong.

312
00:42:08,608 --> 00:42:13,947
If you go, we won't be able to meet,

313
00:42:14,072 --> 00:42:17,200
despite missing each other a lot.

314
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:22,163
You nearly fell into the fire!

315
00:42:27,252 --> 00:42:31,047
It's really burning.
The fire almost burned your back.

316
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,641
What are you thinking about?

317
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:49,232
Mum, can I sleep here tonight?

318
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:51,192
I want to stay here tonight.

319
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,280
OK, then.
I'll take you back in the morning.

320
00:43:58,843 --> 00:44:02,513
- Where did you come from?
- From the monastery.

321
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:06,809
- Is the Lama there?
- Yes.

322
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:09,437
Does he let you go out like this?

323
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:13,566
No, he doesn't.
I asked Mum's permission.

324
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:21,908
Is the Lama there
during winter time?

325
00:44:22,075 --> 00:44:24,118
No, the monastery's closed.

326
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:29,099
The Lama goes down south.

327
00:44:29,123 --> 00:44:31,459
You can go as his helper then.

328
00:44:32,752 --> 00:44:37,090
No, I can't help him.
I'm not at ease with him.

329
00:44:42,011 --> 00:44:44,114
- Monk?
- Yes?

330
00:44:44,138 --> 00:44:46,766
Do you want to go down south with me?

331
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:48,101
Yes...

332
00:44:49,894 --> 00:44:53,898
We'll take a yak to sell it over there.

333
00:44:55,191 --> 00:45:00,488
I don't know if Mum will agree,
but if so, I'll go.

334
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,283
Why not? You can study down there.

335
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,411
And no herding yaks!

336
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:14,585
- Do you want to go?
- If I'm allowed, yes.

337
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:22,593
But... Mum may not allow me to go.

338
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:26,973
I'll talk to your mother about it.
Don't worry, OK?

339
00:45:27,098 --> 00:45:32,228
Soon, there will be too much snow here.

340
00:45:32,353 --> 00:45:34,439
It will be very cold.

341
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:40,570
So if you want to go,
let's go in about three days.

342
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:52,498
- Why are your trousers so tight?
- I'm freezing.

343
00:45:52,623 --> 00:45:56,895
You should button them looser.

344
00:45:56,919 --> 00:45:59,005
I'm feeling better now.

345
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:02,842
I'm leaving soon.

346
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:08,848
When you're in Thimphu,
you'll be able to see your sister.

347
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:12,268
Do you want to visit
your sister in Thimphu?

348
00:46:12,393 --> 00:46:14,145
I don't know.

349
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,564
- Would you like to see her?
- Yes.

350
00:46:16,731 --> 00:46:18,608
- Really?
- Yes.

351
00:46:18,733 --> 00:46:24,631
During the day, your sister will be
at the office working with computers.

352
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:30,554
I don't know if you'll be able
to meet her.

353
00:46:30,578 --> 00:46:32,789
Maybe she has days off.

354
00:46:32,914 --> 00:46:38,294
I'm sure she'll take a day off
to see you.

355
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:43,758
You're right.
She must be able to take a day off.

356
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:52,266
Hold the soap!

357
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,230
You can't even hold the soap!

358
00:47:29,512 --> 00:47:31,889
Come closer.

359
00:47:37,812 --> 00:47:39,981
May our journey be a success.

360
00:47:40,147 --> 00:47:44,944
May you protect us from illness.

361
00:47:45,987 --> 00:47:49,115
Bless us on our journey.

362
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,035
Bless us on our journey!

363
00:49:27,129 --> 00:49:29,882
I brought this yak from Laya
to sell it.

364
00:49:30,007 --> 00:49:33,135
It was really hard to lead it here.

365
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,762
So I see.

366
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:37,098
I'll be happy to sell it to you.

367
00:49:37,223 --> 00:49:40,059
It looks good and healthy.

368
00:49:40,184 --> 00:49:41,811
It's a good yak.

369
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:45,481
If you're interested in it,
I'll sell it to you.

370
00:49:45,606 --> 00:49:50,379
Cash in hand for 15,000 nu.

371
00:49:50,403 --> 00:49:52,321
OK, OK...

372
00:49:52,446 --> 00:49:57,094
I get you,
but 15,000 is a bit too much.

373
00:49:57,118 --> 00:50:01,789
If you really want it,
I'll sell it for 13,500 nu then.

374
00:50:01,956 --> 00:50:05,835
If that's the price, I'll buy it.
It looks healthy.

375
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,753
It's good and healthy.

376
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:12,800
It's turned really cold
on the highlands, Mr Kinley.

377
00:50:12,925 --> 00:50:16,971
We had to walk three days
from Laya to get here.

378
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:24,979
Now, Mr Kinley,
pray well for the animal.

379
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:29,584
Pray that it benefits me.

380
00:50:29,608 --> 00:50:31,902
- OK.
- Here's the money.

381
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:34,655
It's all there. Count it yourself.

382
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,159
It was a good deal
without too much bargaining.

383
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:41,746
I went to Tibet to buy a TV.

384
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:42,997
Really?

385
00:50:43,122 --> 00:50:48,127
But on the way home,
it fell off the horse and broke.

386
00:50:48,252 --> 00:50:53,424
When I told my wife,
she went crazy and started yelling.

387
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:56,552
We argued about it.

388
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,056
That's why I brought the yak to sell.

389
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:03,350
With the money,

390
00:51:03,517 --> 00:51:08,731
I can buy a new TV.

391
00:51:09,899 --> 00:51:14,320
I have to think hard about
how to get it all the way up.

392
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:17,281
- True, true.
- No way can I break it.

393
00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:30,539
Look at that man.

394
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:36,629
- Is it a real man?
- No, it's a mannequin.

395
00:53:38,714 --> 00:53:41,258
How can a man look real if he's not?

396
00:54:45,155 --> 00:54:48,450
The cars come and go,
it's never ending!

397
00:54:50,995 --> 00:54:54,373
They keep going up and down.

398
00:54:54,498 --> 00:54:57,668
They have to,
they can't drive straight across.

399
00:54:57,793 --> 00:55:00,796
- Why?
- They can't go straight.

400
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:03,674
- But why?
- Traffic rules.

401
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:07,678
- Where are they from?
- From down there and up there.

402
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,644
Stay here!

403
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:18,355
Let's take this motorbike
and escape.

404
00:55:19,231 --> 00:55:23,193
Ride, ride, ride...

405
00:55:29,575 --> 00:55:33,662
- What happened to him?
- He's just drunk and sleeping.

406
00:55:33,787 --> 00:55:35,247
What are those things?

407
00:55:35,372 --> 00:55:37,458
How do they help him walk?

408
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,918
He leans on the handles and walks.

409
00:55:40,044 --> 00:55:42,629
- Where do his legs 90?
- In the middle.

410
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:45,299
Do his legs 90 through here?

411
00:55:45,424 --> 00:55:47,593
One for each leg.

412
00:55:49,303 --> 00:55:52,514
- How does it work then?
- He has to jump.

413
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:54,933
- What?
- Walk and jump.

414
00:56:00,856 --> 00:56:03,192
Come on, let's go.

415
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:16,014
Don't eat too much.

416
00:56:16,038 --> 00:56:20,501
If you eat too much,
you might throw up again.

417
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:36,892
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

418
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,188
- I'll buy you another one later.
- OK.

419
00:56:43,857 --> 00:56:48,153
It's ten nu. Ten nu for an egg too.

420
00:56:48,278 --> 00:56:52,866
Ten plus ten makes... a lot!

421
00:57:11,677 --> 00:57:14,596
<i>Now Ray Mysterio.
The unique style of Mysterio.</i>

422
00:57:14,763 --> 00:57:17,015
<i>Rhodes puts on the brakes.</i>

423
00:57:20,936 --> 00:57:22,521
<i>Ooh!</i>

424
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:28,277
<i>Oh, look at this. And Ray once again
taking out Cody Rhodes.</i>

425
00:57:28,402 --> 00:57:30,154
<i>And here comes Mysterio...</i>

426
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:35,367
Uncle Kinley, is it real?

427
00:57:35,534 --> 00:57:38,954
It can't be real,
but I'm not certain about it.

428
00:57:39,121 --> 00:57:42,541
If it was real,
they'd have killed each other.

429
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:50,424
No, it can't be real fighting.
They'd be dead already.

430
00:57:52,885 --> 00:57:57,681
<i>Alberto Del Rio is looking
to fulfill what he feels is his destiny</i>

431
00:57:57,806 --> 00:58:01,393
<i>by becoming the world heavyweight
champion here at WrestleMania.</i>

432
00:58:01,518 --> 00:58:03,687
<i>And, gentlemen,
as you see in the background,</i>

433
00:58:03,812 --> 00:58:08,484
<i>that is a portrait
of his estate in northern Mexico...</i>

434
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:50,400
Sorry, but there's no one
called Choki working here.

435
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:53,487
Sorry I can't help you.

436
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:55,405
OK, thank you.

437
00:58:57,824 --> 00:58:59,701
She's not here. So what now?

438
00:58:59,826 --> 00:59:04,164
Mum told me she worked here.

439
00:59:05,832 --> 00:59:08,627
His mother told him

440
00:59:08,752 --> 00:59:13,882
she works here as a computer operator.

441
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:21,640
There's no one called Choki
in my section.

442
00:59:21,765 --> 00:59:25,227
She might be working
in another ministry or office.

443
00:59:26,478 --> 00:59:28,689
Thank you.

444
00:59:37,781 --> 00:59:40,242
I should call Mum.

445
00:59:44,162 --> 00:59:46,331
I think you should.

446
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,799
- OK, let's call her.
- Yes, call her.

447
00:59:57,551 --> 00:59:58,969
Hey!

448
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:04,516
Mum, I can't find Choki.

449
01:00:05,559 --> 01:00:09,271
We've been trying to find her
for a few days now.

450
01:00:17,029 --> 01:00:22,117
Mum, can you give me
her friend's number?

451
01:01:49,996 --> 01:01:52,791
Your blinking lights are beautiful.

452
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:54,710
They are.

453
01:01:54,835 --> 01:01:56,837
- You like them?
- Yes.

454
01:02:05,846 --> 01:02:09,391
Are the fish artificial or real?

455
01:02:09,516 --> 01:02:13,037
They're real, kept in a tank.

456
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:17,899
- How do they survive?
- In special water for fish.

457
01:02:18,024 --> 01:02:23,363
- What about food?
- You put their food in the tank.

458
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:29,077
It's so interesting to be here.

459
01:02:29,202 --> 01:02:32,789
- Do you like being here?
- Yes. Where do you sleep?

460
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:35,167
Here.

461
01:02:37,502 --> 01:02:40,046
- So you live here?
- Yes.

462
01:02:42,507 --> 01:02:45,886
- So you sleep here?
- Yes, we have to sleep here.

463
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:49,598
- You don't go out?
- No, we have to stay here.

464
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:01,234
Sister, can I tell Mum

465
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:05,655
that you're a club dancer
when I go back home?

466
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:11,703
I thought about calling her
to tell her about this,

467
01:03:11,828 --> 01:03:15,165
but I just couldn't do it.

468
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:19,377
I used to work in an office,

469
01:03:19,503 --> 01:03:21,755
but later I came to work here.

470
01:03:24,716 --> 01:03:28,386
- How is Mum? Is she OK?
- Yes.

471
01:03:28,512 --> 01:03:30,722
Will you go back home someday?

472
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:35,310
I want to visit some temples
before going back home.

473
01:03:37,395 --> 01:03:41,608
I'll go back to the village
in two weeks' time.

474
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:19,062
Did you enjoy being in the city?

475
01:04:19,187 --> 01:04:20,355
Yes.

476
01:04:21,815 --> 01:04:26,152
- Did you get car sick?
- Yes, very sick.

477
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,574
So sick, I didn't even realize
we'd reached the city.

478
01:04:31,575 --> 01:04:34,536
So you could only visit it
the next morning?

479
01:04:34,703 --> 01:04:36,204
Yes.

480
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:39,457
That night, I couldn't sleep.

481
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:42,460
- Did you like it there?
- Yes, I did.

482
01:04:44,129 --> 01:04:46,590
There must be a lot of shops.

483
01:04:48,174 --> 01:04:50,594
I bet you wanted to buy many things.

484
01:04:52,095 --> 01:04:53,763
I wished for many things.

485
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:56,391
Wishes alone won't help.

486
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,394
You have to work
to get what you wish for.

487
01:05:01,396 --> 01:05:04,983
- Did you see your sister?
- She was hard to find.

488
01:05:05,108 --> 01:05:06,735
Really?

489
01:05:09,362 --> 01:05:12,115
- Is she working?
- Yes.

490
01:05:12,282 --> 01:05:14,117
Good.

491
01:05:14,242 --> 01:05:17,537
But I had a hard time finding her.

492
01:05:17,662 --> 01:05:20,582
She's working in an office.

493
01:05:20,707 --> 01:05:24,169
She delivers letters here and there.

494
01:05:31,635 --> 01:05:33,845
Did she tell you...

495
01:05:35,513 --> 01:05:37,933
whether she'll come back soon?

496
01:05:38,058 --> 01:05:39,434
Yes, she did.

497
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:46,816
- Was she happy to see you?
- Yes.

498
01:05:54,866 --> 01:05:56,701
I must go.

499
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:20,558
- You came back at last!
- Yes.

500
01:06:23,311 --> 01:06:25,480
- How shall I cut your hair?
- What?

501
01:06:25,605 --> 01:06:28,566
- How shall I cut it?
- As you like.

502
01:06:28,692 --> 01:06:30,819
- I'll cut it short.
- OK.

503
01:06:44,124 --> 01:06:45,417
Ouch!

504
01:06:50,046 --> 01:06:53,508
- There's hair on your clothes.
- That's OK.

505
01:06:53,675 --> 01:06:55,343
I can wipe it off.

506
01:07:00,265 --> 01:07:03,810
Will my hair look like
it's been eaten by a rat?

507
01:07:03,935 --> 01:07:05,395
No, don't worry.

508
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:09,065
Your hair is so rough.

509
01:07:10,859 --> 01:07:13,778
- When did you last wash it?
- I don't remember.

510
01:07:16,865 --> 01:07:21,036
You should wash it more often
to make it softer.

511
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:23,747
OK, I will.

512
01:07:29,169 --> 01:07:32,422
It's too cold here to wash it every day.

513
01:07:40,346 --> 01:07:42,557
- I heard you went to Thimphu.
- Yes.

514
01:07:42,682 --> 01:07:46,102
- How long did you stay?
- A long time.

515
01:07:46,227 --> 01:07:48,104
- Did you like it?
- Yes.

516
01:07:49,564 --> 01:07:52,108
- Was it your first time there?
- Yes.

517
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:55,570
- Who did you go with?
- What?

518
01:07:55,737 --> 01:07:57,405
Who did you go with?

519
01:07:58,448 --> 01:08:02,577
With my Uncle Kinley.

520
01:08:02,744 --> 01:08:04,579
I also went to Faro.

521
01:08:04,704 --> 01:08:06,247
Sit up straight.

522
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:16,716
Please don't cut my ear.

523
01:08:16,883 --> 01:08:20,386
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

524
01:08:23,556 --> 01:08:24,849
Almost done.

525
01:08:24,974 --> 01:08:27,310
- Ouch! Ouch!
- Sorry.

526
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:29,604
You have to bear a little pain!

527
01:10:40,568 --> 01:10:45,823
I'm going to leave soon,
you know that, right?

528
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,116
We know.

529
01:10:47,242 --> 01:10:53,081
After I leave, the monastic body
will try to send you a new teacher.

530
01:10:53,248 --> 01:10:56,501
So behave, alright?

531
01:10:58,336 --> 01:11:00,588
- Are you happy I'm leaving?
- Not at all.

532
01:11:00,713 --> 01:11:03,341
- Now don't lie.
- We're not happy at all.

533
01:11:04,342 --> 01:11:07,512
Well, I'm not going too far.

534
01:11:07,637 --> 01:11:09,764
I'll be in Punakha...

535
01:11:10,848 --> 01:11:15,645
so we may meet again.

536
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:20,626
There are those who dwell
in the mud and rain,

537
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:22,610
but it will be different for you.

538
01:11:22,735 --> 01:11:25,947
Happiness and peacefulness

539
01:11:26,072 --> 01:11:28,783
is having a shelter

540
01:11:28,908 --> 01:11:32,453
to protect us from rain and sun.

541
01:11:32,578 --> 01:11:34,580
We shall meet again in the future.

542
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:01,524
Now I'll hand over the monastery
to you two.

543
01:12:01,649 --> 01:12:03,776
Take good care of it.

544
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:07,572
Always light butter lamps
and offer holy water.

545
01:12:07,697 --> 01:12:09,907
Do that and your life will be blessed.

546
01:15:08,669 --> 01:15:10,963
<i>Del Rio
obviously thought he had Edge.</i>

547
01:15:11,088 --> 01:15:13,508
<i>And he did have... Look at this!</i>

548
01:15:15,801 --> 01:15:18,471
<i>Del Rio didn't want... Oh, my!</i>

549
01:15:18,596 --> 01:15:20,181
<i>Once again.</i>

550
01:15:20,306 --> 01:15:22,308
<i>He's gonna do it!
Del Rio's gonna do it here!</i>

551
01:15:22,433 --> 01:15:24,810
<i>Alberto Del Rio closed into cover.</i>

552
01:15:26,729 --> 01:15:28,731
<i>Edge put his foot on the bottom rope.</i>

553
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:31,335
<i>Ricardo made sure of that.</i>

554
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:32,777
<i>- And... Uh-oh.
- Christian.</i>

555
01:15:32,902 --> 01:15:34,403
<i>Oh!</i>

556
01:15:38,032 --> 01:15:40,326
<i>- Watch it!
- Oh, man!</i>

557
01:15:42,954 --> 01:15:44,872
<i>80, Christian... Oh, man!</i>

558
01:15:44,997 --> 01:15:47,708
<i>Fallaway slam by Clay.</i>

559
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:51,003
<i>Del Rio took his eyes
and attention off of the champion!</i>

560
01:15:51,128 --> 01:15:53,047
<i>Oh, Del Rio kicks again.</i>

561
01:15:58,052 --> 01:16:00,054
<i>Edge, the ultimate opportunist.</i>

562
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:02,056
<i>Tried to take one there from Del Rio.</i>

563
01:16:02,223 --> 01:16:03,641
<i>Oh!</i>

564
01:16:13,651 --> 01:16:16,696
<i>Oh, look at the eyes of Edge!</i>

565
01:16:23,369 --> 01:16:25,079
<i>Look at those eyes!</i>

566
01:16:33,921 --> 01:16:36,966
<i>- Edge going for the spear.
- Del Rio side-stepping.</i>

567
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:41,053
<i>And Brodus Clay...
Oh! To the injured arm.</i>

568
01:16:41,178 --> 01:16:44,181
<i>Edge's arm, off the steel post.</i>

569
01:16:44,307 --> 01:16:47,310
<i>- Alberto Del Rio cross armbreaker.
- It's over. It's over.</i>

570
01:16:47,435 --> 01:16:49,645
<i>Del Rio's gonna steal
the World Championship.</i>

571
01:16:49,812 --> 01:16:51,939
<i>Edge is gonna tap. Edge is gonna tap.</i>

572
01:16:52,064 --> 01:16:53,816
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
Edge, his hands locked.</i>

573
01:16:53,983 --> 01:16:57,111
<i>If he can keep them locked,
he can keep some of that pressure off.</i>
