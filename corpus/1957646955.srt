192
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,990
such as yourself.

193
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,980
So where's my reward?

194
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,680
- Who were those punks?

195
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,590
- I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

196
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,330
Look, they just gave
me a couple of credits

197
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,370
for a little bump and run, that's all.

198
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,207
Look, I didn't know they
was gonna ambush you.

199
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:18,212
I didn't, honest injun.

200
00:12:18,212 --> 00:12:20,795
(somber music)

201
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,530
- [Computer] Deceased.

202
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,663

- [Computer] File erased.

204
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:46,530
- I'm looking for a patient, Ino Templar.

205
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,930
- I'm busy, come back later!

206
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:52,282
(computer keys clicking)

207
00:12:54,093 --> 00:12:56,600
(ominous music)

208
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,770
Last Order member came in here was D.O.A.

209

210
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:11,817
(thudding)

211
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:13,550
- You got a computer.

212
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,010
Look it up.

213
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,093
Ino Templar.

214
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,490
- [Computer] Processing.

215
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,323
Processing.

216
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:25,137
- Cryo-support, section six.

217
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:29,083
(somber music)

218
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:31,042
(coughing)

219
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:33,959
- [Announcer] Entering section six.

220
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,300
- I got something for you, old friend.

221
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,020
Not yet, nose boy.

222
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,620
Info first.

223
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,590
Who is he?

224
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,050
- Company muscle.

225
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,490
Came looking for his brother.

226
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,500
Some cop that came in D.O.A. two days ago.

227
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,170
- [Greenberg] So the beau
was looking for his bro?

228
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,720
- [Nose Boy] Had a card said
he was some kind of Keeper.

229
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,090
- There must be something
monumental afoot around here.

230
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,720
- All I know is that he got smoked good.

231
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,660
Execution style.

232
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,890
- Any booty involved?

233
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,060
- Word is it was a who
satchel of something serious.

234
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,400
- Satchel full of what?

235
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,233
Credits?

236
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,943
Z-bite?

237
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,783
- I wish.

238
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:15,600
- You know, them Order boys are real bad.

239
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,433
- Order boys?

240
00:14:16,433 --> 00:14:20,990
Order boys are raised on
kung fu ninjaese, okie dokie.

241
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,990
- What you're saying is,

242
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,180
we got the Keeper coming to
give his last rites to his bro.

243
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,633
We got a dirty cop with
a bag full of goodies.

244
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,423
Oh, I smell a deal here somewhere.

245
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:36,230
(ominous music)

246
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,820

from the glass partition.

No physical contact with
plague victims is allowed.

249
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,941
Martian plague virus is airborne.

250
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:49,508
(coughing)

251
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:52,258
(dramatic music)

252
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,060
Section six.

253
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,463
Cryogenic support.

254
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,080

nitrogen injection complete.

255
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,484
Memory download in progress.

256
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:28,401
(foreboding music)

257
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:50,347
(dramatic music)

258
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:58,228
(computer beeping)

259
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:11,880
(ominous music)

260
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,670
- Don't move a muscle.

261
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,580
Just turn around real slow

262
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,583
and go back the way you came.

263
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,073
- This man is my brother.

264
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,803
- You got any ID, brother?

265
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,797
I'd offer my condolences,

266
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:42,141
but you Order boys get
paid to die, don't you?

267
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:43,713
- We solve Company problems.

268
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,390
- When you solve these problems

269
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,213
my work goes into double overtime.

270
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,400
- What happened to him?

271
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,020
- Multiple laser punctures,

272
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,950
bone fractures,

273
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,870
subcutaneous traumas.

274
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,570
Coup de grâce was a blaster wound.

275
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,970
It's a mob signature.

276
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,890
Usually destroys the memory.

277
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,723
- Did it?

278
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,310
- Don't know.

279
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,600
I won't know until tomorrow morning

280
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,083
because that's how long it's
gonna take to download him.

281
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,070
- You don't care much for the law, do you?

282
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,710
- I don't mind the law.

283
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,040
It's the Order I'm not a big fan of.

284
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,890
Especially the way you people see it.

285
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,083
- I will be back.

286
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,683
- One way

287
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,071
or another.

288
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:28,904
(moaning)

289
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:29,737
- Faster, Z-bitch!

290
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:31,282
You know you love it!

291
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:32,810
(moaning)

292
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:33,900
- More!

293
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,733
Give me more!

294
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:36,224
Come on, I need it!

295
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,290
(groaning)

296
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,362
- Z-bite fix coming up.

297
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:42,529
(moaning)

298
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:44,819
- Come on!

299
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:47,069
(groaning)

300
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:51,539
(thudding)

301
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:55,932
(moaning)

302
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:56,849
- Get lost!

303
00:17:59,247 --> 00:18:01,240
Get out, Z-head!

304
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,600
Oh, Roko.

305
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,453
Looks like that Keeper messed you up.

306
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,820
That Keeper just too fast for you?

307
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,653
(thudding)

308
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:13,610
Huh?

309
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,597
Keepers are fast like that.

310
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:18,031
You know, this kind of
thing really pisses me off

311
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,640
and I'm in a very good mood.

312
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,860
So just a little punishment will do.

313
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:26,831
(groaning)

314
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:27,906
You're fired.

315
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,239
(chuckling)

316
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:33,720
- Hey, bub!

317
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,810
I'll carry your bag for you.

318
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,880
- [Caution] Get lost.

319
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,790
- Oh, don't shut me out.

320
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,770
Come on, Mr. Keeper, man.

321
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,603
I'm a good man to know.

322
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:40,960
I can help you with any problem.

323
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,630
Ask me anything.

324
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,960
Everybody knows I know everybody.

325
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,860
Everybody knows, Buckskin knows everybody.

326
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,910
Let me make a deal with you.

327
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,910
- A moment of your time.

328
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:52,503
Find a sandbox, kid.

329
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,153
- Catch you later, bub.

330
00:18:58,728 --> 00:18:59,828
- When I was a Keeper,

331
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,620
we signed into company headquarters

332
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,560
before we started a sweep.

333
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,760
- Just got off the shuttle.

334
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,150
- Name's Bascom.

335
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,833
Chief of security, IP Mining.

336
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,253
Let's talk.

337
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,510
Why would the company send you here?

338
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,966
Or is there something I don't know about?

339
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,093
The company only sends a Keeper out

340
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,043
when things get out of hand.

341
00:19:23,043 --> 00:19:26,170
- One of out men flatlined
down here two days ago.

342
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,003
- I know.

343
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:27,836
Ino Templar.

344
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:28,860
So what's the connection?

345
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,080
- My name's Caution Templar.

346
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,857
He was my brother.

347
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:33,690
- Oh.

348
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,493
My condolences.

349
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,590
I shoulda realized.

350
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,590
You know, I knew your father.

351
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,330
I served under him 30 years ago
when he was Order Commander.

352
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,730
Didn't know he had two sons.

353
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,130
The way it looks right now,

354
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,523
Ino coulda been mixing with bad company.

355
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,893
- What are you saying?

356
00:19:51,893 --> 00:19:54,150
- I'm saying that witnesses
saw him running away

357
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,220
with a satchel.

358
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,080
Coulda been something valuable.

359
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,350
Anyway, there's someone
important who wants to meet you.

360
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,665
Come on.

361
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:03,665
(somber beat music)

362
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,843
Mr. Clement?

363
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,380
Caution Templar.

364
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,980
- Philip Clement, VP
operations, here, in Alpha City.

365
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,120
Always a pleasure to host

366
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,970
one of our associates from the Order.

367
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,030
After all,

368
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,560
we like to think of our employees

369
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,280
as one big family.

370
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
We should help each other
whenever there's a problem.

371
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,290
Although, I think you'll find

372
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,380
the criminal element in
Alpha City is negligible.

373
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,180
Of course, the mining operation's
running smoothly along.

374
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,610
And that's what we're about.

375
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,910
Silex, once refined,

376
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,760
is the most efficient natural fuel found

377
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,390
anywhere in the system.

378
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,573
Please, sit, gentlemen.

379
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,250
Tell me, Caution, why
were you sent down here?

380
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,900
- I'm here to investigate a murder.

381
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,370
- Templar's brother, Ino,
was on assignment here, sir.

382
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,810
Somebody killed him two days ago.

383
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,430
- I'm so sorry.

384
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,480
I didn't know your brother well

385
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,760
but well enough to know
that he was a good man.

386
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,160
And I don't, for a minute,
believe those rumors.

387
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,610
If there's anything we can
do, I mean anything at all,

388
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:16,980
you just tell me.

389
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,980
- Your brother had a
room at the Nostromo Inn.

390
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,420
I suppose you'll wanna start
you investigation there.

391
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,860
We can arrange to have you stay
there while you're in town.

392
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,120
- Of course.

393
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,213
And the door to my office is always open.

394
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:33,761
(electron video game music)

395
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,747
- [Announcer] Welcome to the Nostromo Inn.

396
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:48,747
Serving satisfied customers
since the Great Silex Rush.

397
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,247
- I think you got a customer.

398
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,443
- I can see you, Keeper.

399
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,980
- Ino Templar's old room.

400
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,450
I have company clearance.

401
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,860
- Sure.

402
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,045
Here it is.

403
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:07,422
Keeper room seven.

404
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:10,372
(laughing)

405
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:11,205
Come here, honey.

406
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,038
Come here.

407
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:13,870
Hey, want some poochie?

408
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,403
Very young poochie.

409
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,167
Retro-virgin.

410
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,580
(laughing)

411
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,590
- I'm not interested. Give me the key.

412
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,007
- Not interested?

413
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:26,443
(ominous music)

414
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:29,110
(knife slicing)

415
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,498
- You don't wanna do this.

416
00:22:33,498 --> 00:22:34,860
- Oh,

417
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,796
I think we do.

418
00:22:35,796 --> 00:22:36,964
(knife swishing)

419
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:38,458
(thudding)

420
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,379
(groaning)

421
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:41,541
(yelling)

422
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,287
(glass shattering)

423
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:46,514
(suspenseful music)

424
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:48,681
(yelling)

425
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,076
(glass shattering)

426
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:59,502
- What do you know about a cop
getting blasted two days ago?

427
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:00,410
Huh?

428
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,243
- I don't know a thing.

429
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:03,220
I aint heard no word on that, man.

430
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,140
- Everybody heard about it.

431
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,973
Who did it?

432
00:23:04,973 --> 00:23:06,322
- Coulda been anybody.

433
00:23:06,322 --> 00:23:07,770
You got your Z-heads,

434
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,489
and your smugglers.

435
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:10,380
Your pimps.

436
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,052
Nobody likes the law around here, man.

437
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:14,419
Nobody!

438
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:16,079
(foreboding music)

439
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,812
The boss promised me a bonus
if you're dead before sundown.

440
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:21,062
(groaning)

441
00:23:23,077 --> 00:23:24,330
- Who's your boss?

442
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,590
- I can't tell you, man.

443
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,477
He'll kill me.

444
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:27,713
(yelling)

445
00:23:27,713 --> 00:23:29,010
All right, all right.

446
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,980
Ike Ringo.

447
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,685
- Where do I find him?

448
00:23:31,685 --> 00:23:32,518
Where?

449
00:23:32,518 --> 00:23:33,351
(bones cracking)

450
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:34,184
- The Silex Nugget down the strip.

451
00:23:36,753 --> 00:23:37,586
- Nice to meet you.

452
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:38,850
Happy holidays!

453
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,100
Hey, babe, listen.

454
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,400
The Buckskin's gonna be
rolling in the credits now.

455
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,290
See, I hooked up with this Keeper

456
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,473
and word has it there's a
satchel full of Z-bite to be had.

457
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,400
You like that, don't you?

458
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,560
See, if you stick with me,

459
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,760
I'll get you off this
disease-ridden planet.

460
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,200
Hey, beau!

461
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,520
I'll catch you later, babe.

462
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,353
Gotta go!

463
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,182
Hey, beau, Buckskin
Greenberg at your service.

464
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:06,110
I'm telling you, beau, nobody,

465
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,130
nobody knows this dome like me.

466
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,340
Of course, any good
Alphin, such as myself,

467
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,813
they don't just pop out of an incutube,

468
00:24:12,813 --> 00:24:14,963
they need to be nurtured, incentified.

469
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,750
A place like this could
be a regular credit line.

470
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,300
You and me hook up,

471
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,840
we could run it right.

472
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,640
Oh, beau, you gotta
love modern technology.

473
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,473
Look at this.

474
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:24,480
This is a Jenny Max Joy.

475
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,475
Hey, baby.

476
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:28,470
Hey, beau, I checked her out personally.

477
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,040
Hey, there's not one original part left

478
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,960
on that pleasure pinata.

479
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,740
Beau, is it true that
Keepers never bump uglies?

480
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,850
You know, do the nasty?

481
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,700
Horizontal mambo?

482
00:24:39,673 --> 00:24:41,295
- Wait! Wait!

483
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:42,128
- Oh,

484
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:43,453
the Silex Nugget.

485
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:45,870
(beat music)

486
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,948
(club commotion)

487
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:57,870
- Hey, miners only!

488
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,703
Dome rat.

489
00:24:58,703 --> 00:25:00,330
- Hey, cool your boosters, King Kong.

490
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,343
I'm with the Keeper.

491
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,784
Keep your grimy paws off.

492
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:09,201
(beat music)

493
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,973
(men laughing)

494
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,643
Beau!

495
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:35,476
- [Caution] Is that him?

496
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:36,309
- The bald guy?

497
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:38,588
No, that aint Ringo. That's Fargo.

498
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:39,421
No.

499
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:42,277
You don't wanna rattle their cage.

500
00:25:42,277 --> 00:25:43,530
- All right, man, you play the hand,

501
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,907
you're stupid after all.

502
00:25:44,907 --> 00:25:47,157
(laughing)

503
00:25:50,263 --> 00:25:52,960
(ominous music)

504
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,510
What do you want, Keeper creep?

505
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:56,973
Lap dance is over there.

506
00:25:57,938 --> 00:25:59,838
Bet you Keepers don't even like girls.

507
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,747
- Where's Ike Ringo?

508
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:09,241
- Ike, who?

509
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:11,438
Never heard of him.

510
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:14,337
(ominous music)

511
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:16,087
What're you gonna do?

512
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:17,788
Arrest me?

513
00:26:18,628 --> 00:26:20,878
(laughing)

514
00:26:23,703 --> 00:26:25,146
(glass shattering)

515
00:26:25,146 --> 00:26:25,979
- Greasy bastard!

516
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:27,560
Like I said,

517
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,530
Ike Ringo!

518
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,020
- I don't know.

519
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,120
What do you think, he
hangs out with you cops?

520
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,953
- Find out

521
00:26:33,953 --> 00:26:35,608
and tell him I want him.

522
00:26:35,608 --> 00:26:36,441
You got that?

523
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:37,274
- Yeah.

524
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:38,107
- Huh?

525
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:38,940
- Yeah!

526
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:41,120
(swishing)

527
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,193
(groaning)

528
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:44,164
(thudding)

529
00:26:44,164 --> 00:26:46,195
(yelling)

530
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:47,411
- [Buckskin] Look out!

531
00:26:47,411 --> 00:26:48,560
(thudding)

532
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,477
(glass shattering)

533
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,381
- Come on, bastard!

534
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:00,631
(thudding)

535
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,281
(glass shattering)

536
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:05,273
- Way to go!

537
00:27:05,273 --> 00:27:06,386
Let's go! Let's go!

538
00:27:06,386 --> 00:27:07,287
Come on!

539
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:08,723
Way to kick some butt!

540
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:14,990
- This Keeper's starting
to stick in my craw!

541
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,110
He digs any deeper,

542
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,550
he might discover our dirty little secret.

543
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,550
Get our best guys together.

544
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,380
I want that brother's memory chip!

545
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,890
I'm going with you.

546
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,610
If you screw this up,

547
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,580
just throw yourself off the skywalk,

548
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,593
save me the trouble.

549
00:27:32,061 --> 00:27:33,759
- [Announcer] Here at Nostromo Inn,

550
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,131
you pleasure is our highest priority.

551
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:38,960
Indulge yourselves

552
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,773
with our selection of our
Jenny-Max enhanced playmates.

553
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,164
- [Computer] Access granted.

554
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:47,997
Enter.

555
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,463
- Lights.

556
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,836
Closet.

557
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:58,003
(beeping)

558
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:02,571
(electronic buzzing)

559
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:11,516
(ominous music)

560
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,887
Z-bite.

561
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:23,637
(dramatic music)

562
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,928
(knocking)

563
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,970
- Beau, it's me, it's Buckskin!

564
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,620
Come on, you told me to meet
you here in a half hour.

565
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,020
I am really being serious.

566
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,060
I wanna be a Keeper.

567
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,130
I really wanna be a Keeper.

568
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,190
You gotta hook me up.

569
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,830
You guys got the slickest
scam going in town.

570
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,248
I mean, you're going,
you do a little bruising,

571
00:28:50,248 --> 00:28:51,630
and then you get whatever you want.

572
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,700
Look, you've really gained my respect.

573
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,533
I like it.

574
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,600
I mean, I really, really like it.

575
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,900
- It's not what you think!

576
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,560
- Beau!

577
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,930

583
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,927
- Give me a cross molecular
comparative analysis

584
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:21,450
wit all local geology on record

585
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,840
versus tissue samples

586
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,940
A-23...

Through T-630.

588
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,088

(sighing)

593
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,420
- Man, you've gotta make a
noise when you walk in a room,

594
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,253
or something.

595
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,870
- What's the status with Ino?

596
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,823
- He's still dead.

597
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,810
Sorry.

598
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,280
Just me and the boys.

599
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,513
Conversations are few and far between.

600
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,153
Ino's memory download should
take another minute or so.

601
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:07,530
- [Computer] Analysis initiated.

602
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,740
- What's all this?

603
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,260
- It's research.

604
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,530
I've been trying to
figure out what's making

605
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,850
everybody on this planet so sick.

606
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,750
The company says that it's airborne.

607
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,830
That the re-breather's help.

608
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,137
I don't buy it.

609
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,720
- [Computer] Negative.

610
00:30:26,853 --> 00:30:28,810
- I've got a holoframe here.

611
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,813
Do you have an IEM?

612
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,400
- Image Enhancement Module?

613
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,590
Yeah, it's old and outdated
like everything else around here

614
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,355
but it works.

615
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:37,188
Why?

616
00:30:37,188 --> 00:30:38,103
What're you gonna do?

617
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:41,400
- The picture file that
was in this holoframe

618
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,700
has been deleted.

619
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,700
But the image burns into the
surface of the glass over time.

620
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,820
The IM will make it visible to the eye.

621
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,010
- I thought all you keepers
did was break bones,

622
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,280
bust up people.

623
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,990
You know, loyal to the company.

624
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,360
The company is God.

625
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,010
Order is your family.

626
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,610
Not very impressed by any of it.

627
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:02,023
- If that's true,

628
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,763
then why are you here, doc?

629
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,343
- Why is anybody here?

630
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,900
Bad luck.

631
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,763
Bad timing.

632
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,168
Nobody comes to Mars for a tan.

633
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:17,168
Everybody's running away from something.

634
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,010

from the glass partition.

635
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,810

00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:22,938
Get the disk!

00:31:22,938 --> 00:31:25,605
(ominous music)

638
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,600
- [Doc] Wow!

639
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,870
That's impressive.

00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,703

662
00:32:23,512 --> 00:32:25,345
Let's get out of here!

663
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:27,670

Templar!

669
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,070
Caution Templar!

670
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,488
You don't think we got enough
casualties around here, son?

671
00:32:41,488 --> 00:32:42,816
You listen to me, Caution.

672
00:32:42,816 --> 00:32:44,040
I may not be on the roles anymore,

673
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,940
but you aint dealing with an old fool.

674
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,810
We both work for the company
first, last and forever.

675
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,300
I'm the shepherd of this dome

676
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,860
and you're a company attack dog.

677
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,750
When the Company tells
you to sit, you sit.

678
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,180
When the Company tells
you to heel, you heel.

679
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,940
Right now we don't need your teeth.

680
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,560
- My brother's dead.

681
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,400
Someone's gotta pay the bill.

- You're gonna pay for it if
you don't leave Alpha City.

Mommy, I see you.

690
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:37,494

- [Ino] I did wrong.

700
00:34:04,446 --> 00:34:05,685
I broke the code.

701

But I won't,

702
00:34:06,518 --> 00:34:08,303

If this is about that cop's
memory, check with the company.

00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,610
It's their regulations, not mine.

741
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,443
- It's too bright in here.

742
00:35:37,443 --> 00:35:39,440

- Say it!

749
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,223
- Nap.

750
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:54,168
No!

751
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:55,001
- Oh,

752
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:57,884
yeah.

753
00:35:57,884 --> 00:35:59,122
Better.

754
00:35:59,122 --> 00:36:00,655
Better.

755
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:02,767
Oh, that's so much better.

756
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:05,372
- I'm warning you, I'm protected.

757
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:06,867
- Oh yeah, that's good.

758
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:08,867
We are all into sani-sex

759
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:11,860
- Fire!

760
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,236
(whooshing)

761
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:16,403
(yelling)

762
00:36:20,123 --> 00:36:23,737
(glass shattering)

763
00:36:23,737 --> 00:36:27,058
(alarm beeping)

764
00:36:27,058 --> 00:36:29,808
(dramatic music)

765
00:37:03,134 --> 00:37:05,040
(knocking)

766
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,890
- [Caution] Open.

767
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:12,290
- Please, just put that thing down.

768
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,363
Look, the only reason I'm here

769
00:37:13,363 --> 00:37:15,650
is because you got me into
this mess in the first place.

770
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,690
- What mess?

771
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,650
- Ike Ringo and a couple of his yo-yos

772
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,810
were just at my apartment.

773
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,530
They scared the shit out of me,

774
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,420
but all I have to do is
get back to the hospital

775
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,170
and finish a job that I have to do.

776
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,273
What?

777
00:37:27,273 --> 00:37:28,180
This is my bag.

778
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,673
- Ino had a bag like this.

779
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:34,690
- You know, Caution, I
am no skull squeezer,

780
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,660
but you are suffering from some
serious obsessive behavior.

781
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,940
- Why are you here?

782
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,550
I thought you hated keepers.

783
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,200
- Ike Ringo came after me

784
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,340
because I downloaded Ino's
memory and gave it to you.

785
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,913
Now I am not a big fan
of yours but you owe me!

786
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,370
Caution,

787
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,953
I am really sorry that
your brother got killed.

788
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:01,170
It had nothing to do with me.

789
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,070
All I need to do is get to the hospital

790
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,633
and I need your help.

791
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,900
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

792
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh, look at you, beau.

793
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,970
- Don't you ever knock, Greenberg?

794
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,933
- Hey, lady,

795
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,360
I saw him first.

796
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,460
Look, I got business.

797
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,740
Him and me.

798
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,050
Business together.

799
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,750
I'm his right hand man.

800
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,072
Ham and mayo.

801
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:25,470
Hornet and Kato.

802
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,440
- You are dome scum, Greenberg.

803
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,840
Friend to the highest bidder.

804
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,050
- [Buckskin] Yeah?
- [Doc] Yeah!

805
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:30,883
- Stop it!

806
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,790
- Oh, beau.

807
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,990
- [Caution] Who is she?

808
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,090
- Oh, she's a dancer.

809
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,150
Girls at Strip Mine.

810
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:39,983
You can tell.

811
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:41,950
She got that collar, all
the girls wear those.

812
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:42,990
- Explain.

813
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,400
- See, they all got
these auto Z-bite collars

814
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:48,750
and management, they zap a signal

815
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,073
that sends them flying into orbit.

816
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,203
Some of the things they do, beau,

817
00:38:53,203 --> 00:38:55,080
some of the things they do, you gotta see.

818
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,780
I mean, it is incredible stuff.

819
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,490
They are so sexy.

820
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,323
- Let's go.

821
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:01,386
- Okay, let's go.

822
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:04,553
(exciting beat music)

823
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,680
- Have you seen this girl?

824
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,730
- She's on stage now.

825
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:31,304
50 credits at the door.

826
00:39:31,304 --> 00:39:34,471
(exciting beat music)

827
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,169
- [Announcer] Get a firm grip
on your Z-bite triggers, man.

828
00:39:46,169 --> 00:39:48,698
These girls love Z-bite!

829
00:39:48,698 --> 00:39:50,703
They'll love you for giving it to them.

830
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:53,370
(women moaning)

831
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:01,073
- I'd love to snap that Z-head.

832
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:03,323
(laughing)

833
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,999
- So tasty, baby!

834
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:09,749
(exciting music)

835
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:15,349
(woman moaning)

836
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:23,604
(remotes beeping)

837
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:33,192
(woman sexually moaning)

838
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:48,909
(applauding)

839
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:54,500
- [Announcer] Give it up for Shella!

840
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,160
The hottest Z-head on Mars!

841
00:40:57,795 --> 00:41:00,712
(crowd applauding)

842
00:41:01,605 --> 00:41:05,413
Next up, Tamera and her
twin satellites of love!

843
00:41:07,774 --> 00:41:10,941
(exciting beat music)

844
00:41:20,149 --> 00:41:20,982
(gasping)

845
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:22,010
- What happened to Ino?

846
00:41:22,877 --> 00:41:24,490
- Ino who?

847
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,963
- Ino Templar, my brother.

848
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,670
- I know who you are.

849
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,140
You came all the way out here

850
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,770
because your brother finally
got what he was begging for.

851
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,533
Where the hell were you, huh?

852
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:39,110
What do you want from me?

853
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,550
- I want answers!

854
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,510
- You don't want the truth
because the truth was

855
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,670
your brother was dirty!

856
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,710
Oh yeah,

857
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,620
he liked it all!

858
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,480
Oh yeah, he was the dirtiest
keeper in the planet.

859
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,270
- That's not true!
(glass shattering)

860
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,020
(ominous music)

861
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,120
- Oh, just like your brother.

862
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,293
He liked that too.

863
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,010
- Why would he ever love
somebody like you, huh?

864
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,200
- Your brother pissed on that Order badge.

865
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,700
He was into the Z-bite run,

866
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,893
taking a kick.

867
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,370
Jesus, you didn't even know him.

868
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,333
- What was in that bag?

869
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:20,370
- That kid didn't mean nothing to me.

870
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,410
He should've known that.

871
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,800
He was crazy to even try it.

872
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,633
- What kid?

873
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,453
- [Guard] Hey!

874
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,694
(groaning)

875
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:33,810
(suspenseful music)

876
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,662
- Get out of my way!

877
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:38,495
(crowd commotion)

878
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,460
(thudding)

879
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,087
(groaning)

880
00:42:49,087 --> 00:42:49,920
(yelling)

881
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,617
(glass shattering)

882
00:42:52,617 --> 00:42:55,617
(suspenseful music)

883
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,952
(whimpering)

884
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:22,781
- Shella?

885
00:43:22,781 --> 00:43:24,114
Come on, Shella!

886
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,303
You won't be blabbing to anybody again.

887
00:43:32,781 --> 00:43:33,614
- Uh oh.

888
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,413
Oh, beau.

889
00:43:36,382 --> 00:43:38,822
This doesn't look good.

890
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:41,572
(thugs laughing)

891
00:43:43,126 --> 00:43:45,170
- [Buckskin] I've got your back, beau.

892
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,003
- Party time.

893
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,796
- Oh, beau,

894
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:52,525
this doesn't look like
a very friendly party.

895
00:43:52,525 --> 00:43:55,192
(ominous music)

896
00:44:04,236 --> 00:44:05,641
(yelling)

897
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:08,724
(fighting commotion)

898
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,830
(banging)

899
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,663
Take that!

900
00:44:21,107 --> 00:44:22,890
(thudding)

901
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,164
Good shot, beau!

902
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:26,331
(yelling)

903
00:44:30,435 --> 00:44:31,520
Get him, beau!

904
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,002
You okay?

905
00:44:33,002 --> 00:44:34,828
(ominous music)

906
00:44:34,828 --> 00:44:36,078
You okay, beau?

907
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,430
He'll kick your ass, Fargo.

908
00:44:40,383 --> 00:44:42,633
(groaning)

909
00:44:44,074 --> 00:44:44,907
Way to go!

910
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:48,570
(screaming)

911
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,570
(suspenseful music)

912
00:44:56,232 --> 00:44:58,565
(screaming)

913
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,973
(screaming)

914
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,207
(Shella gagging)

915
00:45:14,505 --> 00:45:16,817
(screaming)

916
00:45:16,817 --> 00:45:17,984
You hear that?

917
00:45:19,601 --> 00:45:20,434
Move! Move!

918
00:45:20,434 --> 00:45:22,058
Get out of the way!

919
00:45:22,058 --> 00:45:23,373
Oh no!

920
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:26,373
(suspenseful music)

921
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:31,245
(gagging)

922
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:33,495
(laughing)

923
00:45:35,945 --> 00:45:36,890
- Oh my god.

924
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,063
Doesn't look like it's gonna
have a good ending, beau.

925
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:41,223
I've never seen nothing like this before.

926
00:45:42,561 --> 00:45:43,394
Bring her down.

927
00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:44,550
Bring her down easy.

928
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,070
Come on, make some room now!

929
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:46,903
Back off!

930
00:45:47,894 --> 00:45:49,816
(ominous music)

931
00:45:49,816 --> 00:45:51,220
Get this thing off of you.

932
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,210
Beau, she aint breathing.

933
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:54,210
Come on, talk to me.

934
00:45:55,265 --> 00:45:56,815
Someone! Someone call a doctor!

935
00:45:57,717 --> 00:46:00,634
(foreboding music)

936
00:46:03,183 --> 00:46:05,180
(door opening)

937
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,320
- My word, Keeper.

938
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,153
Look at you.

939
00:46:07,153 --> 00:46:08,530
You look like you were
hit by the hover bus.

940
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,070
Bet you could use a drink.

941
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,420
I've got a fine Apollo.

942
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,510
26, I think.

943
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,200
- Sir, my brother's dead

944
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,230
and his girlfriend's just been murdered.

945
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:19,180
- Oh my god.

946
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,593
- It was Ike Ringo.

947
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,020
- I've talked to Bascom about
these people until I'm purple!

948
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,090
They're nothing but hoodlums.

949
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,390
He always throws the
union in my face as if...

950
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,480
Sometimes I wonder
who's running this dome.

951
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,350
The Company or the miners.

952
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,390
Tell me, what about the girl?

953
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:36,980
Did she say anything before?

954
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,320
Was she at all helpful?

955
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,950
- She said something about a kid.

956
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,855
- A kid as in child?

957
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:44,700
No, no, no, Keeper, you
must've misheard her.

958
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,290
I mean, as you're aware,

959
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:47,980
we have very strict
regulations here on Alpha

960
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,490
regarding family structure,
don't get me wrong.

961
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,323
I love kids.

962
00:46:51,323 --> 00:46:52,420
I have three little ones at home.

963
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,450
I miss them terribly.

964
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,730
I assure you, off the record,

965
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:56,801
if they could be here they would be

966
00:46:56,801 --> 00:46:59,960
but the company rules are
very clear on this issue.

967
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,730
At any rate, I'm sure you realize by now,

968
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,080
that there's probably
little meaning at all

969
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,480
behind your brother's death.

970
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,960
I wish it were otherwise.

971
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,590
But you and I will not be broken.

972
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,180
We shall prevail.

973
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,840
I want you to punch out
a full report on this

974
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,640
and we can work on it together.

975
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,100
- Thank you, sir.

976
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,750
- But I do assure you, there
are no children on Mars.

977
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:31,040
- [Computer] Analysis of
Silex Chemical composition

978
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,520
in selected damaged human DNA

979
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,470
nearing completion.

980
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,550
First new plague series, match.

981
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,850
Second new plague series,

982
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:41,683
match.

983
00:47:41,683 --> 00:47:42,516
(chiming)

984
00:47:42,516 --> 00:47:43,998
Third new plague series,

985
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:44,831
match.

986
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,223
Overall analysis concludes,

987
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,673
match.

988
00:47:49,673 --> 00:47:52,340
(ominous music)

989
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:04,060
- [Clement] Ringo!

990
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,893
- Yes, sir?

991
00:48:04,893 --> 00:48:06,230
- [Clement] We need to talk.

992
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,100
- Yes, sir, I'll be right there.

993
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,150
- Caution!

994
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:18,920
Jesus, what happened to you?

995
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,753
- I'm fine.

996
00:48:19,753 --> 00:48:21,740
- Let me disinfect it.

997
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:24,193
- [Buckskin] Fargo pulverized
him with mining mace.

998
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,360
(wincing)

999
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,562
- What do you know about kids on Mars?

1000
00:48:29,562 --> 00:48:31,248
(spraying)

1001
00:48:31,248 --> 00:48:33,585
(groaning)

1002
00:48:33,585 --> 00:48:35,240
- There are no kids on Mars.

1003
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,640
It's another company policy.

1004
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,670
- See, beau, I told you.

1005
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,853
No elves on Alpha.

1006
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,560
- What are you doing
with the re-breathers?

1007
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,764
- We're going outside the
dome to look for evidence.

1008
00:48:49,764 --> 00:48:52,907
- I'd like to get out there
soon before the storms act up

1009
00:48:52,907 --> 00:48:55,020
and we can't find a way back.

1010
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,620
- Yeah, well you're wasting
your time with those filters.

1011
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:00,090
I found it.

1012
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,300
- You found what?

1013
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,360
- For months I've been
running tests to find out

1014
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,040
what's making everyone so sick

1015
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,813
and today I got the results.

1016
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:08,950
- What're you talking about, doc?

1017
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,040
- And it's not the air.

1018
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,430
It's not Z-bite,

1019
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:15,900
it's not anything that the
company wants you to know about.

1020
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,150
- What is it?

1021
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,500
- Welcome to the gold rush, boys.

1022
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,250
Only this time, the gold is poison.

1023
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,093
It's the Silex.

1024
00:49:23,936 --> 00:49:25,460
(foreboding music)

1025
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:26,293
- Let's go.

1026
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,860
- I'm right behind you, beau.

1027
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:30,743
- Wait a second.

1028
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,350
- Hey, what's next, beau?

1029
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,188
- Outside to where my brother was killed.

1030
00:49:35,188 --> 00:49:36,840
- There's this old freak out
there named Pete the Hermit.

1031
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,590
I bet he knows something
about that satchel.

1032
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:39,423
- We'll find out.

1033
00:49:39,423 --> 00:49:40,740
- Okay!

1034
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,903
- Damn it, Caution!

1035
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,090
Look, you don't get it.

1036
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,030
We've gotta warn people.

1037
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,040
We've gotta evacuate this planet now.

1038
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,680
- Not until I know who
killed my brother and why.

1039
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,550
- See, it's about his bro, sis,
and you wouldn't understand.

1040
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:54,942
- No, you don't understand.

1041
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:57,720
There's a lot more important
things than your dead brother.

1042
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,020
- You do whatever you have to.

1043
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,173
- [Buckskin] Yeah, we're
gonna go see Pete the Hermit.

1044
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:05,431
(dramatic music)

1045
00:50:10,229 --> 00:50:12,560
- Of course the essence of productivity

1046
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,680
is a dedication to commitment
to a healthy bottom line.

1047
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,140
That is what put Interplanetary on top

1048
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,523
and that is what will keep us here.

1049
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,113
Now, let us come to the
issue of risk versus reward.

1050
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:29,910
Calculated risk.

1051
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,647
So what the hell are these
two troublemakers doing?!

1052
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,990
I want answers, gentlemen.

1053
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,570
I need solutions.

1054
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,470
Otherwise, this whole operation

1055
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,163
will be jeopardized.

1056
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,420
- Yes, sir.

1057
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,973
- And your bonuses, forget it.

1058
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,160
The Company raises these Keepers

1059
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,920
from the time they're children, correct?

1060
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,150
We train them, we indoctrinate them.

1061
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,300
- They bleed like the rest of us, sir.

1062
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,574
(laughing)

1063
00:50:57,574 --> 00:50:59,010
- Yes.

1064
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:00,420
That's it, Mr. Ringo.

1065
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,253
Up until now,

1066
00:51:01,253 --> 00:51:03,650
you have had every
Keeper who swans in here

1067
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,973
thinking he's saving the planet

1068
00:51:04,973 --> 00:51:07,080
from Z-bite or whatever else,

1069
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,790
but now we have a zellet
out there with a mission.

1070
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,570
Do you have any idea, Mr. Ringo,

1071
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,170
the danger posed by a pissed off Keeper?!

1072
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,841
- I'll get my people
right on it, Mr. Clement.

1073
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,700
(foreboding music)

1074
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,690
- Whatever you did to the brother,

1075
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:23,410
do it again.

1076
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,243
Kill him.

1077
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:26,513
Am I clear?

1078
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,659
- Yes, sir.

1079
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:31,326
(ominous music)

1080
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,270
- What do you think was in that satchel?

1081
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:36,103
Z-bite?

1082
00:51:36,103 --> 00:51:37,055
Credits?

1083
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:38,770
You think Pete the Hermit's got it?

1084
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,690
What are we gonna get?

1085
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:41,780
Tell me!

1086
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,307
- Answers.

1087
00:51:43,307 --> 00:51:45,474
(beeping)

1088
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,358
- [Radio Guard] Sir, Dr.
Halliday is here to see you.

1089
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:55,631
Should I send her in?

1090
00:51:55,631 --> 00:51:58,714
(ominous beat music)

1091
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,170
Sir, she's coming up.

1092
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,320
Should I call security?

1093
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,223
- No, send her in.

1094
00:52:09,223 --> 00:52:10,056
I'm expecting her.

1095
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:14,308
(foreboding music)

1096
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,310
- Clement, we have got to talk right now.

1097
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,480
- Sure, doctor, of course.

1098
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,313
It's rather good timing.

1099
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:21,500
Here, join me for a drink.

1100
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,157
- I've just sent a communicate to Entermed

1101
00:52:23,157 --> 00:52:26,010
that's gonna cause the
evacuation of this entire planet.

1102
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,830
They're gonna be here in less
than 12 hours to investigate.

1103
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:29,690
In the meantime,

1104
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,920
you are the only person with the authority

1105
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,830
to get these workers to safety.

1106
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:34,800
- Okay.

1107
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,990
- Okay?

1108
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,823
- Sure.

1109
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:37,656
Please, drink up.

1110
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:39,150
You're obviously a little stressed.

1111
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,980
Lights, dim to tranquil.

1112
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,610
- Look, thank you very
much but I don't drink.

1113
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:45,443
- Please, sit.

1114
00:52:45,443 --> 00:52:46,276
Drink up and we'll talk.

1115
00:52:46,276 --> 00:52:47,470
This is just a martian version

1116
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:48,943
of a fruit juice cocktail.

1117
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:51,780
- Fruit juice, huh?

1118
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,480
- Now, tell me everything.

1119
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,860
- The Silex, Mr. Clement,

1120
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,360
is what's causing the fatalities
among the employees here.

1121
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,620
- I can't even guess as to the motivation

1122
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:03,480
behind that statement.

1123
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,870
It's such a radical leap of logic.

1124
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,580
- Yeah, well, it is the Silex.

1125
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,090
Look, I've proven it.

1126
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,243
Even got evidence.

1127
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,460
- Doctor,

1128
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,390
think about it.

1129
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:17,030
The fossil fuel that we
discovered back in 1996

1130
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,870
has passed every possible
test ever devised on Earth

1131
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,630
and here you are claiming that you, alone,

1132
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,190
have discovered something that's withstood

1133
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,357
60 years of expert scrutiny.

1134
00:53:26,357 --> 00:53:27,927
No.

1135
00:53:27,927 --> 00:53:30,737
(chuckling)

1136
00:53:30,737 --> 00:53:33,160
(sighing)

1137
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,722
Are you all right, my dear?

1138
00:53:34,722 --> 00:53:35,846
- Look,

1139
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:39,600
this whole operation on Mars,

1140
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,120
it's a big mistake.

1141
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,080
- Oh, no, no, no, doctor.

1142
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,983
The mistake is yours, I'm afraid.

1143
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,220
You see,

1144
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,540
the mission of this corporation

1145
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,460
can in no way be detoured by

1146
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:52,900
your lovely, yes, but sick,

1147
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,073
misguided idea.

1148
00:53:57,217 --> 00:53:59,300
- What was in that drink?

1149
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:03,196
Bastard.

1150
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:07,630
(whimpering)

1151
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:10,630
(suspenseful music)

1152
00:54:13,914 --> 00:54:15,560
- Service access.

1153
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,393
This is it.

1154
00:54:17,936 --> 00:54:20,853
(foreboding music)

1155
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,833
- Let's do it.

1156
00:54:26,059 --> 00:54:29,059
(somber beat music)

1157
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,260
Ike Ringo, voice ID.

1158
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,093
Security open.

1159
00:54:37,543 --> 00:54:40,720
- Goddamn, got the worst re-breather.

1160
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,613
Thing's ancient.

1161
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:47,136
(foreboding music)

1162
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,280
- Hey, man, that's a particle beam.

1163
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,330
You can't use that in the Dome.

1164
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,870
- Hey, don't panic, it's a torch.

1165
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:55,180
It's no good outside a hundred yards

1166
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,043
but within that, everything's toast.

1167
00:54:57,882 --> 00:54:59,708
(vacuum seal hissing)

1168
00:54:59,708 --> 00:55:02,291
(wind howling)

1169
00:55:11,815 --> 00:55:14,482
(alarm beeping)

1170
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,350
Hey, take your guys, go out the back.

1171
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,157
We're gonna beat the hermits.

1172
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:27,407
I'm gonna cover the dome.

1173
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,613
Finders, keepers.

1174
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,513
(wind howling)

1175
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:40,591
(coughing)

1176
00:55:41,955 --> 00:55:43,140
- [Man] They've got a gun!

1177
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,264
Bastards!

1178
00:55:44,264 --> 00:55:46,597
Hey, where'd they get those?

1179
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:52,530
(wind howling)

1180
00:55:58,828 --> 00:56:01,578
(water sloshing)

1181
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:11,969
- There's something on the air.

1182
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:12,910
I can't make it out.

1183
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,294
- [Caution] Just follow me.

1184
00:56:14,294 --> 00:56:15,127
Come on.

1185
00:56:16,605 --> 00:56:19,262
(ominous music)

1186
00:56:19,262 --> 00:56:21,701
(water sloshing)

1187
00:56:21,701 --> 00:56:22,534
- Move it!

1188
00:56:22,534 --> 00:56:23,867
Come on, faster!

1189
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:26,932
This way!

1190
00:56:26,932 --> 00:56:27,765
Let's go!

1191
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:33,473
- [Caution] There it is.

1192
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:36,140
(ominous music)

1193
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,228
(metal squeaking)

1194
00:56:50,228 --> 00:56:51,061
Come on.

1195
00:56:53,498 --> 00:56:55,660
- [Computer] Access granted.

1196
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,530
Please initiate

1197
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,953
filtering process.

1198
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:01,883
(thudding)

1199
00:57:01,883 --> 00:57:02,920
- [Caution] Where's the switch?

1200
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:08,890
(ominous music)

1201
00:57:11,318 --> 00:57:12,540
(electrical fizzling)

1202
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,373
- [Computer] Please wait

1203
00:57:13,373 --> 00:57:15,590
for oxygenation process to complete.

1204
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:17,701
Five, four, three,

1205
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:19,710
two, one.

1206
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,500
Oxygenation complete.

1207
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,923
You make exit airlock.

1208
00:57:29,323 --> 00:57:30,843
(gun clicking)

1209
00:57:30,843 --> 00:57:34,301
(door creaking)

1210
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:36,217
(coughing)

1211
00:57:36,217 --> 00:57:38,800
(wind howling)

1212
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,330
- Hey, beau, look at all this stuff.

1213
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,569
- Hey!

1214
00:57:44,569 --> 00:57:45,821
Shut the damn door!

1215
00:57:45,821 --> 00:57:47,280
The filthy filters is already as unholy

1216
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,893
as the dark side of a lunar.

1217
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:50,843
Shut it!

1218
00:57:52,066 --> 00:57:52,899
- Okay.

1219
00:57:52,899 --> 00:57:54,157
Just take it easy, old man.

1220
00:57:57,928 --> 00:57:59,869
(door thudding)

1221
00:57:59,869 --> 00:58:01,480
- What's the law want with me?

1222
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,880
- Relax, old man!

1223
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,790
We're not here on Company business, okay?

1224
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:05,623
- Is that so?

1225
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,330
- Old timer,

1226
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,290
this is Caution Templar

1227
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:13,020
and they call me Buckskin Greenberg.

1228
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,690
Hey, take it easy!

1229
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:17,093
- Yeah, well they call
me a crazy old fool.

1230
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:20,463
Maybe that's why they aint killed me yet.

1231
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:26,530
You're not here to check me
registration papers, Keeper?

1232
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:29,150
- It's about my brother.

1233
00:58:30,752 --> 00:58:31,697
- Yeah.

1234
00:58:31,697 --> 00:58:34,130
Caution's bro was the dude
that got blasted out here

1235
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:35,143
a few days ago.

1236
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:39,080
- Aye, bless his soul.

1237
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,760
I saw it all.

1238
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,600
Ike Ringo and company.

1239
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,777
They finished him.

1240
00:58:43,777 --> 00:58:46,090
I took a satchel off of him.

1241
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,329
- A satchel?

1242
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:49,130
Keeper, eureka!

1243
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,500
Well cut to the chase, old man!

1244
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,750
What was in the satchel?

1245
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,583
- Shut up.

1246
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:53,500
- Come on, tell us!

1247
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,583
- Shut up!

1248
00:58:54,583 --> 00:58:55,502
- What was in the satchel?

1249
00:58:55,502 --> 00:58:56,335
- Shut up!

1250
00:58:56,335 --> 00:58:57,168
- Yes, sir.

1251
00:58:57,168 --> 00:58:58,001
- Shut up!

1252
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:58,834
- Okay, sir.

1253
00:58:58,834 --> 00:58:59,667
- Shut up!

1254
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:00,500
- Just take it easy.

1255
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,083
- Doesn't he ever shut up?

1256
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,773
Yo, Greenberg.

1257
00:59:05,773 --> 00:59:06,606
- Huh?

1258
00:59:06,606 --> 00:59:07,470
- You move around too much

1259
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:09,560
and you run your mouth way too much.

1260
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,663
Sit your ass down.

1261
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,243
Sit your ass down!

1262
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:16,018
- Just take it easy.

1263
00:59:16,018 --> 00:59:17,190
- Go on, sit your ass down on the table.

1264
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:18,130
Get over there.

1265
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,260
- Okay.

1266
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,052
Just don't point that thing at me, okay?

1267
00:59:23,052 --> 00:59:24,052
Put it down.

1268
00:59:31,675 --> 00:59:32,543
- [Fargo] Move!

1269
00:59:32,543 --> 00:59:34,626
Let's finish this keeper!

1270
00:59:36,247 --> 00:59:39,300
(wind howling)

1271
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,800
- You strong of heart, Keeper?

1272
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,653
I said, are you strong of heart, Keeper?

1273
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,737
(dramatic music)

1274
00:59:48,737 --> 00:59:51,900
(wind howling)

1275
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,640
There's a wind storm,

1276
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,570
just like tonight.

1277
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,420
We always get them this time of year.

1278
00:59:58,405 --> 01:00:00,110
(gunshots popping)

1279
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,050
I heard shots.

1280
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:03,370
I saw a man running.

1281
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:04,335
Didn't know who.

1282
01:00:04,335 --> 01:00:06,213
(gunshots popping)

1283
01:00:06,213 --> 01:00:07,793
But he must've known about me.

1284
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:12,356
He knew I'd take care of
that little package for him.

1285
01:00:12,356 --> 01:00:13,443
But it was too late.

1286
01:00:14,846 --> 01:00:16,161
(groaning)

1287
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:18,283
Oh, the guards had a mighty good time.

1288
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:23,140
Before they shot our brother
in the back of the head.

1289
01:00:24,156 --> 01:00:26,097
(booming)

1290
01:00:26,097 --> 01:00:28,847
(dramatic music)

1291
01:00:29,712 --> 01:00:31,755
You Company boys really know how to

1292
01:00:31,755 --> 01:00:34,093
drain all to the memory banks.

1293
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,773
When he opened up that satchel,

1294
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,343
me heart just broke.

1295
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:45,107
I heard her crying first.
(baby crying)

1296
01:00:45,107 --> 01:00:48,083
Her tiny lungs fighting to
find air but there was none.

1297
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:50,533
The poor, wee thing.

1298
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:54,130
She couldn't have been
more than a month old.

1299
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:55,611
(baby crying)

1300
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:57,933
Those damned, heartless monsters.

1301
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,835
What they did...

1302
01:01:00,835 --> 01:01:02,610
(baby crying)

1303
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:04,142
I'll never forget.

1304
01:01:04,142 --> 01:01:07,131
(baby crying)

1305
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:09,251
(gunshot booming)

1306
01:01:09,251 --> 01:01:12,001
(dramatic music)

1307
01:01:13,976 --> 01:01:14,809
Come on.

1308
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,610
- [Fargo] Let's enjoy this.

1309
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,953
It's not everyday we get
to play with our firearms.

1310
01:01:24,691 --> 01:01:27,691
(suspenseful music)

1311
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,834
(alarm beeping)

1312
01:01:30,834 --> 01:01:33,501
(wind rumbling)

1313
01:01:49,823 --> 01:01:52,823
(door seal hissing)

1314
01:01:57,576 --> 01:02:00,076
- I didn't know about the kid.

1315
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,953
- And if you had, would
you have cared, Keeper?

1316
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,387
- Hey, if you found anything,

1317
01:02:14,387 --> 01:02:16,387
you just better give it to him, old man.

1318
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:21,280
- It's all he had on him.

1319
01:02:22,216 --> 01:02:23,784
That's his Keeper I.D.

1320
01:02:23,784 --> 01:02:26,451
I went and buried the wee thing.

1321
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:29,076
Put her to rest.

1322
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:31,793
- Where?

1323
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,503
- Out there.

1324
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,280
I could find her but you
don't want to see her, Keeper.

1325
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,970
Like the rest,

1326
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:40,093
she weren't right.

1327
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,013
- What do you mean?

1328
01:02:43,797 --> 01:02:46,270
- I been here since the start, Keeper.

1329
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,850
First mission after they nuked the icecap

1330
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:53,740
and went greenhouse.

1331
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,390
First farming

1332
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:57,283
when the geo struck Silex.

1333
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,870
Finest fossil fuel ever.

1334
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:02,130
That's crap.

1335
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:04,810
And plenty of EPA boys got plenty rich

1336
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,923
swearing that this planet was safe.

1337
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,430
You know why their aren't
any women on Mars, Keeper?

1338
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,052
- Company regulations.

1339
01:03:15,052 --> 01:03:16,917
- Company regulations.

1340
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:18,692
(laughing)

1341
01:03:18,692 --> 01:03:20,940
Company regulations.

1342
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,562
(laughing)

1343
01:03:22,562 --> 01:03:24,812
(coughing)

1344
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:32,905
(suspenseful music)

1345
01:03:42,896 --> 01:03:45,063
There used to be children.

1346
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:49,493
We had about six of them
the first year on Alpha.

1347
01:03:50,737 --> 01:03:51,833
They wasn't right.

1348
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,550
The Company shuttered them off.

1349
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:56,763
We reckon for some sort of rehab.

1350
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:58,993
We never saw them again.

1351
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:02,270
- Why don't you quit
your jabbering, old man,

1352
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,502
and get to he crust of the biscuit, okay?

1353
01:04:04,502 --> 01:04:05,983
Come on!

1354
01:04:05,983 --> 01:04:08,397
(ominous music)

1355
01:04:08,397 --> 01:04:11,219
- Billy?

1356
01:04:11,219 --> 01:04:12,302
Come on down.

1357
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,740
I've got some folks I want you to meet.

1358
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:17,311
- [Billy] Father.

1359
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,972
(eerie music)

1360
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:20,972
- That's it.

1361
01:04:22,297 --> 01:04:23,880
That's it, wee lad.

1362
01:04:32,407 --> 01:04:36,050
The Company didn't want folks to see this.

1363
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:37,593
They made Billy work here.

1364
01:04:37,593 --> 01:04:38,673
Said they made a row.

1365
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,477
Many children buried.

1366
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,668
Go back up to your room, son.

1367
01:04:45,668 --> 01:04:48,010
- [Billy] Yes, father.

1368
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:50,449
- Easy there, fella, easy.

1369
01:04:50,449 --> 01:04:53,233
(dramatic music)

1370
01:04:53,233 --> 01:04:55,110
He's a good boy.

1371
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,913
He's a good boy.

1372
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,203
I'm awful sorry about
your brother, Keeper.

1373
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,690
And I wish he'd gotten
that girl back to Earth

1374
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:06,870
so some doctor could approve

1375
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:10,101
what's eating all of us up on this planet.

1376
01:05:10,101 --> 01:05:10,934
- The Silex.

1377
01:05:10,934 --> 01:05:13,080
- Of course it's the Silex.

1378
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,130
- Doc ran a program a few hours ago

1379
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:16,960
and she said that's what it was.

1380
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,973
- Damn straight.

1381
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,310
- And the Company has
been keeping a lid on it

1382
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:23,223
and they knew it all along.

1383
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:26,713
And it's going to happen on the earth.

1384
01:05:27,828 --> 01:05:32,828
Silex fumes spewing from
every engine on every road.

1385
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,963
That's why they won't let
nobody get off this rock.

1386
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:41,240
Sure, they can swing
out to the army station

1387
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,040
but that's nothing but a
freaking dead satellite by now.

1388
01:05:45,618 --> 01:05:46,518
We're trapped here

1389
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,117
until we die.

1390
01:05:49,117 --> 01:05:51,784
(ominous music)

1391
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,620
That's a Company memo from 30 years ago.

1392
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:08,013
The president of I.P.C ordering
everyone to hush things up.

1393
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:13,500
Nice outfit you work for, aye Keeper?

1394
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,143
Killing kids for profit.

1395
01:06:17,946 --> 01:06:20,946
(suspenseful music)

1396
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,033
- [Caution] Nice.

1397
01:06:26,033 --> 01:06:27,403
- [Pete] They is all antiques.

1398
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:33,910
- [Caution] Where'd you get the guns?

1399
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:35,890
- It's all from the first landing.

1400
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:38,750
You can't buy ammo for it anymore.

1401
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,540
- Where do you get it?

1402
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,950
- I made me a reloading bench.

1403
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,913
Crazy old fool's got to have a hobby.

1404
01:06:46,526 --> 01:06:50,030
(suspenseful music)

1405
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:51,480
These are fun.

1406
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,650
- [Buckskin] This is some heavy arsenal.

1407
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,560
- Here you go, boy.

1408
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,640
- [Buckskin] Thank you.

1409
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,710
- Take this one, that's good.

1410
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:56,960
- [Buckskin] Okay.

1411
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,540
Oh wee, we're gonna get some action, beau.

1412
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,830
- Sure you know how to handle it all?

1413
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:01,870
- [Caution] No problem.

1414
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:02,703
- [Buckskin] Yeah, yeah.

1415
01:07:02,703 --> 01:07:04,650
Me, I'm a basement bomber by birth.

1416
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:06,480
- That may get you as far as the Dome.

1417
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,000
You're marked men.

1418
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,790
Nobody who ever took on the company

1419
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:11,940
lived to tell about it.

1420
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:17,347
May the grace of God be with you.

1421
01:07:17,347 --> 01:07:18,180
(foreboding music)

1422
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:19,013
Get down!

1423
01:07:19,013 --> 01:07:21,541
(explosion booming)

1424
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:23,074
Company bastards!

1425
01:07:23,074 --> 01:07:24,147
Get off me land!

1426
01:07:24,147 --> 01:07:27,068
(gunshots booming)

1427
01:07:27,068 --> 01:07:28,103
(yelling)

1428
01:07:28,103 --> 01:07:30,721
(gunshots booming)

1429
01:07:30,721 --> 01:07:33,888
(Buckskin whimpering)

1430
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:37,617
(glass shattering)

1431
01:07:37,617 --> 01:07:39,857
(suspenseful music)

1432
01:07:39,857 --> 01:07:42,309
- [Buckskin] Go get 'em!

1433
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:45,226
(gunshots booming)

1434
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:48,397
(yelling)

1435
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,073
- Down!

1436
01:08:03,923 --> 01:08:06,835
Nothing I hate worse than dirty mine rats!

1437
01:08:06,835 --> 01:08:09,159
(Buckskin whimpering)

1438
01:08:09,159 --> 01:08:11,560
(gunshots booming)

1439
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,055
- [Buckskin] Beau!

1440
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:13,888
Beau!

1441
01:08:13,888 --> 01:08:15,954
- Come out, come out, wherever you are!

1442
01:08:15,954 --> 01:08:17,578
(booming)

1443
01:08:17,578 --> 01:08:18,411
(air tank hissing)

1444
01:08:18,411 --> 01:08:19,991
- Go!

1445
01:08:19,991 --> 01:08:20,840
(groaning)

1446
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,874
(gunshots booming)

1447
01:08:21,874 --> 01:08:22,870
- Give me the gun.

1448
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:23,703
- [Buckskin] Okay!

1449
01:08:23,703 --> 01:08:26,285
(yelling)

1450
01:08:26,285 --> 01:08:27,535
Watch it, beau!

1451
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,147
(booming)

1452
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:35,498
- Let's play, Superman!

1453
01:08:35,498 --> 01:08:36,775
You run and I kill you!

1454
01:08:36,775 --> 01:08:40,370
(gunshots booming)

1455
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:43,053
Come on, die like a good Company dog!

1456
01:08:44,872 --> 01:08:46,570
It's over, Keeper man.

1457
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:48,857
Our boss, Mr. Clement,
sent us to kill you!

1458
01:08:48,857 --> 01:08:51,774
(gunshots booming)

1459
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:56,187
Come on, you stinking poochie!

1460
01:08:56,187 --> 01:09:01,187
Let's play for keeps!

1461
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,234
(yelling)

1462
01:09:05,234 --> 01:09:06,067
(booming)

1463
01:09:06,067 --> 01:09:09,002
(groaning)

1464
01:09:09,002 --> 01:09:11,585
(bomb beeping)

1465
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,311
- Way to go, beau!

1466
01:09:15,311 --> 01:09:16,144
It's gonna blow!

1467
01:09:16,144 --> 01:09:18,253
It's gonna blow!

1468
01:09:18,253 --> 01:09:21,336
(explosion rumbling)

1469
01:09:22,212 --> 01:09:24,463
(suspenseful music)

1470
01:09:24,463 --> 01:09:25,753
- Excuse me, sir.

1471
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,110
But maybe we should rethink this.

1472
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,250
Cool down, some.

1473
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,800
- Am I taking advice
from failed Keepers now?

1474
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,640
- We took care of Ino.

1475
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,840
If that would've been the end of it, okay.

1476
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,040
But why can't we let
this brother of his go?

1477
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:45,360
Let him take out that animal, Ringo.

1478
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,730
And he'll be done with it.

1479
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:49,062
- We can not afford to take
that risk, Chief Bascom.

1480
01:09:49,062 --> 01:09:51,770
Why don't you just follow your directives?

1481
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,570
Come on, there's nothing
but two loose ends here.

1482
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:54,403
Nothing more.

1483
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:55,236
One's over there.

1484
01:09:55,236 --> 01:09:56,520
The company doctor.

1485
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,410
The other's the Keeper.

1486
01:09:58,410 --> 01:10:00,020
Now,

1487
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,410
once both are taken care of,

1488
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,283
it's back to business as usual.

1489
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,210
I'll take that as a yes.

1490
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,810
Now, I'm going out for a stroll.

1491
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:13,630
Make sure the women is secure

1492
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,690
and I'll telecom if I need you.

1493
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:16,523
Door open.

1494
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,100
(suspenseful music)

1495
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:30,873
- I'll have you undone
here in a minute, doctor.

1496
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,910
I'll tell you how things
got so out of hand.

1497
01:10:38,057 --> 01:10:41,250
(foreboding music)

1498
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,417
(moaning)

1499
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:49,446
- Bascom.

1500
01:10:49,446 --> 01:10:50,279
(Doc whimpering)

1501
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,435
(booming)

1502
01:10:52,435 --> 01:10:55,213
(crying)

1503
01:10:55,213 --> 01:10:57,563
Now that's what I call executive action.

1504
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,170
- [Buckskin] So where we going, beau?

1505
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:03,650
I mean, you heard Fargo, right?

1506
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,070
Clement's behind it all.

1507
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:07,230
We going to get Clement, huh, beau, huh?

1508
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,070
- [Caution] Be quiet.

1509
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:09,040
Load this.

1510
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,300
- Okay.

1511
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,990
Okay, I'm ready.

1512
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:12,823
Let's go.

1513
01:11:14,426 --> 01:11:17,426
(suspenseful music)

1514
01:11:31,272 --> 01:11:32,689
You see anything?

1515
01:11:34,095 --> 01:11:34,928
Huh?

1516
01:11:34,928 --> 01:11:36,345
You see anything?

1517
01:11:42,536 --> 01:11:43,903
You see anything?

1518
01:11:43,903 --> 01:11:45,320
Beau?

1519
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:48,320
(suspenseful music)

1520
01:11:58,005 --> 01:11:59,653
Beau?

1521
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:00,968
What're we looking for?

1522
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:01,885
- Get back.

1523
01:12:16,802 --> 01:12:19,385
(gun clicking)

1524
01:12:27,269 --> 01:12:29,769
(rustling)

1525
01:12:29,769 --> 01:12:30,602
- Beau!

1526
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:35,036
(gunshots booming)

1527
01:12:36,337 --> 01:12:39,085
(yelling)

1528
01:12:39,085 --> 01:12:40,673
(yelling)

1529
01:12:40,673 --> 01:12:42,793
(thudding)

1530
01:12:42,793 --> 01:12:45,710
(gunshots booming)

1531
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,345
- Damn!

1532
01:12:49,345 --> 01:12:52,580
(Buckskin whimpering)

1533
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:54,211
- Corner!

1534
01:12:54,211 --> 01:12:56,378
(booming)

1535
01:12:58,566 --> 01:12:59,399
Open the bag.

1536
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:00,232
- What?

1537
01:13:00,232 --> 01:13:01,065
- Open the bag!

1538
01:13:01,065 --> 01:13:02,435
- Okay, okay, open the bag.

1539
01:13:02,435 --> 01:13:03,268
All Right.

1540
01:13:03,268 --> 01:13:06,348
(gunshots booming)

1541
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:07,181
I can't see! I can't see!

1542
01:13:07,181 --> 01:13:08,486
- A grenade!

1543
01:13:08,486 --> 01:13:09,319
- What's a grenade?

1544
01:13:09,319 --> 01:13:10,152
- Come on, man!

1545
01:13:12,356 --> 01:13:14,399
(gunshots booming)

1546
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:15,232
Ancient thing.

1547
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:16,974
Thant's it.

1548
01:13:16,974 --> 01:13:17,807
- Okay, got it.

1549
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:18,640
Now what?

1550
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,910
(booming)

1551
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:20,989
- Pull out the pin.

1552
01:13:20,989 --> 01:13:22,629
- Okay, pull out the pin.

1553
01:13:22,629 --> 01:13:24,300
Okay, now what?

1554
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,173
- Get rid of it.

1555
01:13:25,173 --> 01:13:27,167
(grenade beeping)

1556
01:13:27,167 --> 01:13:30,488
(gunshots booming)

1557
01:13:30,488 --> 01:13:32,429
(yelling)

1558
01:13:32,429 --> 01:13:34,421
(suspenseful music)

1559
01:13:34,421 --> 01:13:37,254
(grenade beeping)

1560
01:13:42,365 --> 01:13:45,448
(explosion rumbling)

1561
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:47,810
Come on, let's go!

1562
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:55,180
(foreboding music)

1563
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:58,760
- [Thug] Come in, Ringo.

1564
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,593
- Speak!

1565
01:13:59,593 --> 01:14:00,426
- [Thug] I'm sorry, sir.

1566
01:14:00,426 --> 01:14:01,419
The Keeper got through.

1567
01:14:01,419 --> 01:14:03,586
(yelling)

1568
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,666
(beeping)

1569
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:11,866
(buzzing)

1570
01:14:11,866 --> 01:14:12,699
- This is Clement.

1571
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:13,532
- They missed him.

1572
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:14,623
They couldn't stop the Keeper.

1573
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:18,140
- What do you mean, you missed him?

1574
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:20,900
- He's on his way back to the Dome.

1575
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:22,800
- That means he'll be coming after me.

1576
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,900
Ringo, I had better not
encounter that Keeper alive!

1577
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:27,733
Do you hear me?

1578
01:14:27,733 --> 01:14:29,490
- Yes, sir, I'll be waiting for him!

1579
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:30,743
- Now out!

1580
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,700
Well, it appears, doctor,
that I may need you

1581
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,883
as an insurance policy.

1582
01:14:38,448 --> 01:14:40,615
(moaning)

1583
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,080
What a nice night for a shuttle ride.

1584
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,080
(suspenseful music)

1585
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:53,163
- Hey!

1586
01:14:53,163 --> 01:14:53,996
You can't--

1587
01:14:53,996 --> 01:14:54,829
(groaning)

1588
01:14:54,829 --> 01:14:57,133
(thudding)

1589
01:14:57,133 --> 01:14:58,100
(whooshing)

1590
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,003
(yelling)

1591
01:15:00,003 --> 01:15:03,003
(suspenseful music)

1592
01:15:12,526 --> 01:15:15,443
(glass shattering)

1593
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,993
- Time to die, Keeper!

1594
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:28,942
(yelling)

1595
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:31,192
(thudding)

1596
01:15:33,463 --> 01:15:36,630
(electrical fizzling)

1597
01:15:41,189 --> 01:15:43,856
(ominous music)

1598
01:15:50,461 --> 01:15:53,500
(thudding)

1599
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:54,333
Escape!

1600
01:15:55,276 --> 01:15:58,276
(suspenseful music)

1601
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:14,143
Come to poppa, baby, let's heat things up.

1602
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,767
(suspenseful music)

1603
01:16:29,734 --> 01:16:31,111
(Buckskin whooping)

1604
01:16:31,111 --> 01:16:33,361
(thudding)

1605
01:16:48,082 --> 01:16:50,828
- That'll keep you to mess
with the Junior Keeper.

1606
01:16:50,828 --> 01:16:51,739
(groaning)

1607
01:16:51,739 --> 01:16:52,572
(yelling)

1608
01:16:52,572 --> 01:16:54,822
(thudding)

1609
01:17:00,135 --> 01:17:02,802
(ominous music)

1610
01:17:27,317 --> 01:17:29,567
I'm right behind you, beau.

1611
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:32,463
No worries.

1612
01:17:41,932 --> 01:17:44,849
(foreboding music)

1613
01:17:47,232 --> 01:17:49,399
(yelling)

1614
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,296
- Looks like your goose is cooked!

1615
01:18:01,068 --> 01:18:01,901
Damn!

1616
01:18:01,901 --> 01:18:03,244
(fire whooshing)

1617
01:18:03,244 --> 01:18:05,577
(screaming)

1618
01:18:09,673 --> 01:18:11,840
(banging)

1619
01:18:12,777 --> 01:18:13,610
Ashes to ashes!

1620
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,940
(screaming)

1621
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:18,971
(fire whooshing)

1622
01:18:18,971 --> 01:18:21,304
(screaming)

1623
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,094
- Oh, you wanna make a fireball?

1624
01:18:30,094 --> 01:18:31,384
Listen, I may be a sleazebag

1625
01:18:31,384 --> 01:18:33,557
but baby killing pisses me off!

1626
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,331
Get him, beau!

1627
01:18:36,331 --> 01:18:38,145
(fizzling)

1628
01:18:38,145 --> 01:18:39,228
Go, beau, go!

1629
01:18:41,172 --> 01:18:42,321
Come on!

1630
01:18:42,321 --> 01:18:43,540
(suspenseful music)

1631
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,120
- Come on, Keeper.

1632
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:46,689
Come on.

1633
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:48,489
I'll do you like I did your brother.

1634
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:53,157
Let's hear you beg like he did.

1635
01:18:55,595 --> 01:18:57,845
(thudding)

1636
01:19:00,415 --> 01:19:01,498
I'll cut you.

1637
01:19:03,889 --> 01:19:06,889
(suspenseful music)

1638
01:19:09,534 --> 01:19:11,784
(thudding)

1639
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,183
- Let's go, beau, let's go!

1640
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,303
- Ino hated you.

1641
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,433
Hated your guts.

1642
01:19:20,478 --> 01:19:21,311
Yeah.

1643
01:19:26,634 --> 01:19:28,884
(thudding)

1644
01:19:31,551 --> 01:19:32,384
- Yeah!

1645
01:19:34,003 --> 01:19:36,420
(whimpering)

1646
01:19:38,269 --> 01:19:39,102
- Go, beau!

1647
01:19:39,102 --> 01:19:39,935
Take him down!

1648
01:19:39,935 --> 01:19:41,262
- Where's Clement?

1649
01:19:41,262 --> 01:19:44,243
- You think you've won,
don't you, Order boy?

1650
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:46,093
You lost!

1651
01:19:46,093 --> 01:19:47,460
Clement's on the shuttle.

1652
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,093
I hope you can fly.

1653
01:19:50,074 --> 01:19:51,430
Go ahead, huh?

1654
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:52,750
Kill me in cold blood.

1655
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:54,450
Forget about that holy order, huh?

1656
01:19:55,387 --> 01:19:57,600
Go on and kill me.

1657
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,010
You're gonna enjoy it just as much

1658
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:01,060
as I enjoyed killing your little brother.

1659
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:02,743
Go on, do it!

1660
01:20:02,743 --> 01:20:04,590
You're just like me!

1661
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:05,795
Yeah!

1662
01:20:05,795 --> 01:20:07,826
(yelling)

1663
01:20:07,826 --> 01:20:10,493
(ominous music)

1664
01:20:14,569 --> 01:20:16,736
(gagging)

1665
01:20:20,584 --> 01:20:22,990
- Beau, you should get
triple overtime for that.

1666
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,070
- Come on, let's move.

1667
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:24,903
- Okay!

1668
01:20:26,834 --> 01:20:29,300
(suspenseful music)

1669
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,460
Hurry up!

1670
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,840
What was that shuttle?

1671
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,395
- [Announcer] Shuttle
will depart in 10 minutes.

1672
01:20:34,395 --> 01:20:35,740
(wind howling)

1673
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:36,790
- I want that hover bus now!

1674
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:38,640
I can't walk to the blasted shuttled site!

1675
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,090
No, I don't care about
any explosion in a tunnel!

1676
01:20:42,262 --> 01:20:43,922
- We're almost there.

1677
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,850
(suspenseful music)

1678
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:48,430
- Just get me to that shuttle!

1679
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:49,263
- Clement!

1680
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:51,363
- Security,

1681
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,050
get to the shuttle bay.

1682
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:54,560
Intruder alert!

1683
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,310
Security, I need assistance now!

1684
01:20:58,310 --> 01:21:00,330
Caution, you shoulda stayed out of this,

1685
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:01,590
followed your Keeper's Code!

1686
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,060
You don't understand the complexities

1687
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,440
in this kind of operation!

1688
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,730
It's difficult to maintain
corporate integrity!

1689
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:08,390
- Integrity?

1690
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:09,223
- Yes.

1691
01:21:09,223 --> 01:21:10,056
Security.

1692
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:13,570
Structure.

1693
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:16,010
The key to survival.

1694
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:17,830
Order.

1695
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:18,820
- Order?

1696
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:21,540
- You are a trader to
the Company, Caution.

1697
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:25,420
How dare you bite the hand that feeds you?

1698
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:26,470
Gives your life meaning.

1699
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:29,680
Now you have once chance
to save your membership.

1700
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,063
Serve the Company.

1701
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:34,968
Security, arrest this man!

1702
01:21:34,968 --> 01:21:37,968
(suspenseful music)

1703
01:22:01,382 --> 01:22:04,049
(knife slicing)

1704
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:08,564
(squelching)

1705
01:22:08,564 --> 01:22:11,564
(suspenseful music)

1706
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:13,624
- [Announcer] Attention!

1707
01:22:13,624 --> 01:22:16,776
Orbit shuttle departs in five minutes.

1708
01:22:16,776 --> 01:22:18,180
- Hover bus, override!

1709
01:22:18,180 --> 01:22:19,013
This is Clement!

1710
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:23,610
You broke your code, didn't you Caution?

1711
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,413
You attached yourself to this woman.

1712
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,373
You forgot, didn't you?

1713
01:22:27,373 --> 01:22:29,410
A Keeper can never get involved

1714
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,380
and never care.

1715
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,970
Can never show mercy.

1716
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:35,820
- And never negotiate.

1717
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:39,370
- No, I will sacrifice this
woman for the greater cause!

1718
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:41,620
(thudding)

1719
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,660
- You okay?

1720
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:45,526
How you doing, doc?

1721
01:22:45,526 --> 01:22:48,152
(screaming)

1722
01:22:48,152 --> 01:22:51,152
(suspenseful music)

1723
01:22:55,206 --> 01:22:56,999
(groaning)

1724
01:22:56,999 --> 01:22:57,832
Where'd they go?

1725
01:22:57,832 --> 01:22:58,701
- Caution!

1726
01:22:58,701 --> 01:22:59,534
- Beau?

1727
01:23:04,419 --> 01:23:05,920
- Caution, stop it!

1728
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,560
Stop it, Caution, you can't do this!

1729
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,393
- Why?

1730
01:23:09,393 --> 01:23:10,226
- You owe it to the Company!

1731
01:23:10,226 --> 01:23:12,580
It's your job, it's your duty!

1732
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:15,160
(groaning)

1733
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:16,935
(gunshot booming)
(glass shattering)

1734
01:23:16,935 --> 01:23:19,370
(wind howling)

1735
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,720
- I quit!

1736
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:23,053
(screaming)

1737
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:28,651
- Where's Clement?

1738
01:23:28,651 --> 01:23:31,440
(thudding)

1739
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,523
(jackhammer buzzing)

1740
01:23:35,668 --> 01:23:37,568
- He finally joined the working class.

1741
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:39,530
Come on.

1742
01:23:39,530 --> 01:23:41,106
- No, hey, let's see what he left behind.

1743
01:23:41,106 --> 01:23:41,939
Come on!

1744
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,197
- [Announcer] Medical alert in progress.

1745
01:23:47,197 --> 01:23:50,092
Calmly proceed to the
shuttle deck for evacuation.

1746
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:50,934
(dramatic music)

1747
01:23:50,934 --> 01:23:55,351
All citizens must evacuate
in a calm, orderly manner.

1748
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,137
- Caution?

1749
01:23:58,137 --> 01:23:59,222
Caution!

1750
01:23:59,222 --> 01:24:00,717
Where you gonna go?

1751
01:24:00,717 --> 01:24:02,933
When you have no family, you have no job,

1752
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:05,333
what do you plan on doing now?

1753
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,113
- Nothing.

1754
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:11,128
It's over.

1755
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,070
- Come on, Caution.

1756
01:24:14,070 --> 01:24:15,620
It's not over.

1757
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:17,800
Please, come back to Earth.

1758
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,200
The people really need your help.

1759
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,100
Fight the Company.

1760
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,750
We still got a few more
battles before justice is done.

1761
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:27,220
- Beau, skip that!

1762
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:28,053
Come to Venus with me.

1763
01:24:28,053 --> 01:24:29,280
They got a new colony opening up.

1764
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,870
I mean, you and me, together.

1765
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,320
Keepers gotta stick together.

1766
01:24:34,164 --> 01:24:34,997
What, doc?

1767
01:24:34,997 --> 01:24:35,830
- Nothing.

1768
01:24:36,762 --> 01:24:38,943
Find a good cause wherever you go.

1769
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,270
- Looks like it's you and me, beau.

1770
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:45,190
Brothers in blood, snow and mud.

1771
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:46,860
I hear some of the poochie on Venus

1772
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:49,010
is like you've never seen before.

1773
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:50,463
We'll be killing out there.

1774
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:52,299
Beau?

1775
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:54,813
- Hey, doc!

1776
01:24:58,222 --> 01:24:59,590
- Beau!

1777
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:01,140
Beau, I thought we were a team.

1778
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:05,313
(somber music)

1779
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:08,123
- Thanks.

1780
01:25:16,842 --> 01:25:17,675
- Beau!

1781
01:25:17,675 --> 01:25:18,508
Okay, beau.

1782
01:25:18,508 --> 01:25:19,461
So you've got the hots, here, for the doc.

1783
01:25:19,461 --> 01:25:20,310
Understandable,

1784
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:21,280
but you gotta let the big head

1785
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,330
do the thinking for the little head.

1786
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:23,163
- [Caution] Greenberg.

1787
01:25:23,163 --> 01:25:24,700
- [Buckskin] Beau, beau,
I just had a brainstorm.

1788
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,630
You Keepers are like the core, right?

1789
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:27,970
You probably got the dirt on everyone.

1790
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:28,980
So let's sell the story.

1791
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:30,280
We'll make millions of credits!

1792
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,690
- [Caution] I'll tell you
the world's greatest secret.

1793
01:25:31,690 --> 01:25:33,060
- [Buckskin] Yeah, finally!

1794
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,719
- [Caution] Silence is golden.

1795
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,969
- [Buckskin] Come on, beau.

1796
01:25:38,844 --> 01:25:41,594
(dramatic music)

1797
01:26:08,945 --> 01:26:11,945
(suspenseful music)

1798
01:26:57,783 --> 01:27:00,366
(somber music)

1799
01:28:11,434 --> 01:28:14,434
(suspenseful music)

1800
01:29:58,903 --> 01:30:01,653
(dramatic music)
