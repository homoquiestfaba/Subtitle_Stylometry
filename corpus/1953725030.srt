AFTER THE WAY YOUR TEAM
SCREWED UP AS BADLY AS

00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:13,288
IT DID, YOU
SHOULDN'T BE HERE!

359
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:18,492
BUT THE IRONY IS THAT
NOW THE HOUSE IS GUARDED,

00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,502
AND YOU HAVE GONE FROM BEING
A LIABILITY TO AN ASSET.

361
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:27,304
SINCE YOU OWN THE MALES

362
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,379
- TICKET IN TO WHAT?

363

INTERESTED IN THIS HOUSE

365
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,021

CRITICAL ELEMENT.

366

- WHAT DO I HAVE
TO DO WITH IT?

367
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,817
- TAKE THE FEMALES MIND
LIKE YOU HAVE THE MALES.

368
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,190
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

369

THERE'S NO WAY I
CAN GET NEAR THAT.

YOU'LL HAVE ONE
WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY

FALL INTO PLACE.

I WAS DATING HER
SISTER FIRST.

BUT YOU'RE LEAVING OUT THE
BEST PART OF THE STORY

387
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,084
JESS ACTUALLY TALKED
LISA OUT OF SEEING ME.

388
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,127
SHE SAID THAT I WAS NO GOOD
FOR LISA AND THAT SHE COULD

389
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:52,957
DO MUCH BETTER THAN ME.

390

A WORD OF IT.

GET MY HANDS ON HIM.

- SO WHEN DID YOU START
DROPPING HINTS TO YOUR SISTER

397
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,378
- AS SOON AS I MET JASON.

- REALLY? THE WHOLE TIME?

399

- YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T
KNOW US VERY WELL.

WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IS
THAT WE WILL STOP AT NOTHING

870
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,008
THEY DO, THEIR CHARACTER.

871
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,604
NOT THAT THERE'S ANY
PRESSURE, OF COURSE.

872
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:56,206
- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING
TO LOSE ANY SLEEP OVER IT.

873
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,479
SOME OF THE MOST EVIL PEOPLE
IN HISTORY HAD

874
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,179
WONDERFUL PARENTS.

875
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:02,518
NO MATTER WHAT EXTERNAL
FORCES TRY TO INFLUENCE OUR

876
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:05,786
LIVES, IN THE END,
WE HAVE FREE WILL.

877
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,692
- I COULDN'T DISAGREE
WITH YOU MORE.

878
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,787
I COMPLETELY
DISAGREE WITH YOU.

879
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,594
ADULTS HAVE FREE WILL.

880
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,134
ADULTS DO, YES THEY DO.

881
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:15,669
KIDS, THEY DON'T.

882
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,170
THEY DON'T GET TO
CHOOSE THEIR PARENTS.

883
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,830
THEY DON'T GET TO CHOOSE
THEIR UP BRINGING.

884
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,567
THEY CAN'T CONTROL THE
EMOTIONAL CLIMATE

885
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,541
OF THEIR HOMES.

886
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:24,737
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT POWER,
AND CHILDREN --ADULTS FOR

887
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,814
THAT MATTER --THEY'RE ALL
CONTROLLED BY

888
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,405
OUTSIDE INFLUENCES.

889
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:33,113
THEY ARE, AND --
[CELL PHONE RINGING]

890
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,712
I'M ON A LEASH.

891
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:36,256
- OUTSIDE INFLUENCES.

892
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:37,757
- HELLO?

893
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:45,026
YES, WE'RE PLAYING CHESS.

894
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:50,121
I CAN DO THAT.

895
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,151
YOUR TURN.

896
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,696
JASON, IT'S YOUR GO.

897
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:19,824
JASON!

898
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,698
JASON!

899
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:23,532
YOU NEED TO STOP STARING AT
THE GIRLS, MAN, YOU'RE GOING

900
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:28,838
TO CREEP TH EM OUT.

901
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,309
REMATCH?

902
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,902
- YEAH.

903
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,447
YEAH.

904
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,174
- YES, YES, YES.

905
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,774
- YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE ENCOURAGED HIM.

906
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,443
- YOU <i>KNOW, THAT'S</i>
FUNNY COMING FROM YOU.

907
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,145
<i>- DON'T IGNORE THE OBVIOUS.</i>

908
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:41,984
<i>HE IS</i> DRAWING HIS BAD
DREAMS BECAUSE OF YOU.

909
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,887
<i>- DON'T EVEN START.</i>

910
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,551
- <i>YOU NEED HELP, AND</i>
YOU'RE <i>GETTING WORSE.</i>

911
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,028
<i>AND IF YOU DON 'T GET HELP,</i>
TH EN <i>JASON'S GOING</i> TO...

912
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,564
<i>- GOING TO WHAT?</i>

913
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:52,065
- <i>AT LEAST I CARE ABOUT HIS
MENTAL</i> HEALTH AND

914
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,725
<i>HIS WELL BEING.</i>

915
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,393
- <i>DAMN H: HANNAH, DON'T YOU
THINK</i> I <i>CARE ABOUT HIM, TOO.</i>

916
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,028
- <i>I BELIEVE YOU DID
BEFORE YOU CAVED.</i>

917
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,765
<i>YOU NEED HELP.</i>

918
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:02,071
<i>- I DON'T NEED HELP!</i>

919
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,515
- JOSHUA, ARE YOU AWARE OF
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

920
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,084
THE HOUSE?

921
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,709
- YES.

922
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,481
- HOW DIFFICULT
IT GET THIS FAR?

923
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,180
- STEPHEN, THIS HAS BECOME
A BATTLE OVER THE MIND.

924
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,053
IF JASON CAN BREAK FREE OF
FEAR, THEN THE HOUSE CAN BE

925
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,717
WON, BUT NOT BEFORE.

926
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,852
- JOSHUA, IT'S
WORSE THAN YOU THINK.

927
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,453
ACCORDING TO OUR LATEST
INTEL, DIVINATION IS

928
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,396
BEHIND ALL THIS.

929
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,230
LOOK, CUT YOUR LOSSES.

930
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,929
LET DANIEL TAKE OVER.

931
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:31,630
HE'S GOT NOTHING TO LOSE.

932
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,435
IF YOU LOSE ANOTHER HOUSE
TO DIVINATION, YOU'LL LOSE

933
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,340
EVERYTHING YOU'VE WORKED
SO HARD TO ATTAIN.

934
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:40,142
YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE
WHAT ALL THE ANGELS WANT.

935
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,147
YOU'RE THIS CLOSE TO DWELLING
WITH THE PERFECT ONE

936
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,218
IN THE INNER CIRCLE.

937
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,617
I'M ASKING YOU AS YOUR
FRIEND, DON'T RUIN EVERYTHING

938
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,553
ON THIS FAMILY

939
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:51,125
- THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL
ABOUT THE THREE OF THEM.

940
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,558
- THREE?

941
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,391
THE FEMALES PREGNANT.

942
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:58,227
- YES, AND HER
NAME IS JESSICA.

943
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,234
- JOSHUA, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BECOME ATTACH ED.

944
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,099
- I'M NOT ATTACHED.

945
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,605
I JUST KNOW A GOOD
THING WHEN I SEE IT.

946
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:08,972
- VERY WELL.

947
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:13,104
I HATE TO DO THIS, BUT YOUR
FATE IS NOW TIED TO THEIRS.

948
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:16,116
I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

949
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:20,376
- I BROUGHT SOME
THINGS TO SHOW YOU.

950
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,651
- I BROUGHT SOME
THINGS TO SHOW YOU.

951
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,349
I'VE BEEN DRAWING WHAT I SEE.

952
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:31,024
I'VE BEEN DOING IT SINCE
MY DAD PASSED AWAY

953
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:36,036
- SO ARE THESE DREAMS OR
ARE THESE WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE?

954
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:40,472
- THOSE RIGHT THERE HAVE
BEEN WHEN I'M AWAKE.

955
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,008
- JASON, IS THERE A HISTORY
OF MENTAL ILLNESS

956
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:43,975
IN YOUR FAMILY?

957
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,375
- YOU'RE ASKING
ME THAT ALREADY?

958
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:49,075
- SUCH AS YOUR FATHER?

959
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:50,981
- OKAY, LISTEN, DOC, I DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE...

960
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,213
- JASON, WE'RE IGNORE THE
ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, ONLY

961
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,619
YOU THINK I DON'T SEE IT.

962
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,316
I THOUGHT YOUR NAME
LOOKED FAMILIAR,

963
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,984
SO I DID SOME RESEARCH.

964
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,928
MY MENTOR COUNSELED
YOUR FATHER.

965
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,999
- MY FATHER WAS A GREAT MAN.

966
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,558
- YES, HE WAS, BUT HE
ALSO HAD HIS ISSUES.

967
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:10,262
I'M SURPRISED YOU THOUGHT
WE COULD MAKE PROGRESS HERE

968
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,534
PRETENDING HE DIDN'T EXIST.

969
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,371
YOU CAN'T DECEIVE YOURSELF

970
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,968
THE TRUTH IS WHAT
MATTERS HERE.

971
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:27,249
HAVE YOU KEPT YOUR FATHER
A SECRET FROM EVERYONE?

972
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,807
- WHY, WHY ARE
YOU ASHAMED OF HIM?

973
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,905
- BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT TO BECOME HIM.

974
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:56,881
IF I CAN MAKE MY PAST
DISAPPEAR, THEN I CAN

975
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,714
CREATE MY OWN FUTURE.

976
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,310
I CAN START A CLEAN CANVAS.

977
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,014
- NOT BY IGNORING IT.

978
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,920
- I THOUGHT YOU DID
MOSTLY LISTENING.

979
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:05,287
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE MAN
ENOUGH TO BE

980
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:07,486
STRAIGHT WITH ME.

981
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,621
WHAT DO YOU
REMEMBER ABOUT HIM?

982
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,531
- I REMEMBER THAT HE
WAS A BRILLIANT MAN.

983
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,034
AND THEN TOWARDS THE END OF
HIS LIFE, HE STARTED

984
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:16,762
TO LOSE HIS MIND.

985
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,170
HE WOULD SCREAM AT WALLS,
HE WOULD TALK TO THIN AIR;

986
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:24,041
CONSTANT RAMBLINGS ABOUT
THE POWER OF BLOOD.

987
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:25,942
I DON'T KNOW, EVENTUALLY, HE
WOULDN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE.

988
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,311
EVERYTHING HE
SAW HAUNTED HIM.

989
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,042
THE ONLY THING THAT SILENCED
THE VOICES WAS THE BULLET HE

990
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:33,211
ENDED UP WITH IN HIS HEAD.

991
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,754
- ACCORDING TO THE
POLICE REPORTS,

992
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,448
THERE WAS AN EYEWITNESS.

993
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:40,494
[GUNSHOT]

994
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:44,194
- HE DIDN'T
KNOW I WAS THERE.

995
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:45,732
THAT'S AN IMAGE I HAVEN'T
BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT OF MY

996
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,826
HEAD, NOT FORA SINGLE DAY

997
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:52,566
- JASON, WE INHERIT A LOT
FROM OUR PARENTS, NOT JUST

998
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,575
GENETICS BUT EMOTIONAL TRAITS
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL

999
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:58,373
TRAITS AND OTHERS.

1000
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,470
YOU'RE EXPERIENCING WHAT
YOUR FATHER EXPERIENCED.

1001
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,983
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU'RE BECOMING YOUR FATHER.

1002
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:07,054
DID YOU KNOW THAT AMID ALL
THE PRESS AND SPIN ABOUT HIM,

1003
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:10,784
HE ASSISTED THE POLICE IN
ARRESTING FOUR MURDERERS?

1004
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,918
I SHOULD SAY
MORE THAN ASSIST.

1005
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,894
AS A PROMINENT RELIGIOUS
LEADER IN THE COMMUNITY, IT

1006
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:18,625
WAS NORMAL FOR HIM TO LISTEN
AND PRAY WITH THE FAMILY

1007
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,965
MEMBERS, BUT SEEING THE CRIME
SCENE, YOUR FATHER TOLD

1008
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,370
POLICE THE NAME AND ADDRESS
OF THOSE THAT COMMITTED THE

1009
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:30,000
CRIME, RIGHT THEN AND
THERE JUST SPOKE IT OUT

1010
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,510
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

1011
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,638
- YOU DON'T KNOW BECAUSE
IT WAS KEPT UNDER WRAPS.

1012
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,477
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN IF THE PUBLIC FOUND

1013
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,176
OUT THE POLICE GOT
THEIR TIPS FROM A

1014
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,253
PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC?

1015
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:43,381
- I ASKED HOW
DO YOU KNOW THIS?

1016
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,358
- JASON, I BELIEVE
WHAT YOU HAVE IS A GIFT.

1017
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,985
YOUR FATHER COULDN'T
FILTER IT, EITHER,

1018
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,859
AND IT DROVE HIM MAD.

1019
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:52,092
I SUGGEST THAT YOU START
FILTERING THE NOISE.

1020
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,134
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M HEARING THIS.

1021
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,464
I'M TURNING INTO THE
PSYCHOPATH MY FATHER IS.

1022
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,334
THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF
IS HOW TO NOT PASS THIS TO MY

1023
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,102
CHILD, AND YOU'RE TELLING
ME THIS IS A GOOD THING?

1024
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,234
- JASON, WHEN YOU FIRST
START TO SWIM, YOU'RE GOING

1025
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,971
TO SWALLOW SOME WATER.

1026
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:07,173
I SUGGEST YOU EXERCISE YOUR
MIND AND LEARN

1027
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,648
TO FILTER THE IMAGE.

1028
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,548
FEAR WANTS TO CONTROL AND YOU
STOP YOU FROM BECOMING WHO

1029
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,382
<i>YOU REALLY ARE.</i>

1030
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,251
- WHAT THE HELL PSYCHIATRIC
COLLEGE DID YOU GO TO?

1031
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,256
URI GELLER UNIVERSITY

1032
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:20,954
THIS ISN'T SCOOBY DOO,
DOC, THIS IS MY LIFE.

1033
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,500
- JESS.

1034
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:39,240
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

1035
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,941
- JESS, I WAS
GOING TO TELL YOU.

1036
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:45,315
- YEAH, WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR SIX YEARS,

1037
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,888
MARRIED FOR TWO.
