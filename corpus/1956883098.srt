1
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,106
- Tell me again why we're sitting

2
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,076
on top of this giant
rock called Trollsvotin?

3
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,636
Why couldn't I have got the job in Hawaii?

4
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,536
At least there's action there.

5
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,496
This volcano's been dormant for how long?

6
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,526
- Give it a rest, Jeff.

7
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,453
- All you two do is argue.

8
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,316
- There's nothing better
to do on this mountain.

9
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,776
Keeps me from yawning to death.

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,576
- Well, you could save your
energy and try not to talk.

11
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,557
- You'd like that wouldn't you?

12
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:16,473
- Oh, yeah.
- So would I.

13
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,310
- Fine.

14
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,256
- This whole mountain is gonna blow.

15
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,090
- Ryan and Fred,

16
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,906
they're still up at the
top collecting samples.

17
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,616
- Get them on the radio now.

18
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,777
We got to clear out!

19
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,443
- Ryan, this is base camp, copy.

20
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:11,275
Ryan, this is base camp, copy.

21
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,963
Ryan, this is base
camp, get down here now!

22
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,306
Nothing.

23
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,030
These seem to have worken earlier.

24
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,586
You can't go up there.

25
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,806
- Lisa's coming with me.

26
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,926
- You won't make it.

27
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,546
- I'm not leaving them.

28
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,166
Call the helicopter evac team

29
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,986
and then pack up all our equipment.

30
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,376
We'll be back before your finished.

31
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
- Hurry.

32
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,450
Iceland Transport, copy

33
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:57,343
Iceland Transport, requesting
emergency evac, copy.

34
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,286
- This is Iceland
Transport, repeat request.

35
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,746
- This is USGO Survey Team Trollsvotin,

36
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,086
requesting immediate transport, copy.

37
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,110
- On our way.

38
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,176
ETA five minutes.

39
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,386
Emergency evac gives you
two minutes load time,

40
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,856
then we're out of there.

41
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,173
- Copy that Iceland
Transport, we'll be ready.

42
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,546
- Ryan, let's pack it up!

43
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,666
I can't get through to base camp

44
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,049
and these temperature readings
are rising pretty quick.

45
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:24,240
- Okay.

46
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,043
- Jeff, Jeff, where's the evac team?

47
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,226
- The 'copter's on its way,

48
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,427
get down here now!

49
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:02,337
- The case!

50
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,238
- Oh no.

51
00:05:23,515 --> 00:05:26,026
Let's get out of here!

52
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:04,826
- Just like that, in
the span of a heartbeat,

53
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,671
we see the earth go from
her most serene and bucolic

54
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:12,093
to her most violent and destructive.

55
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,766
Our planet was forged

56
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:17,696
out of this primordial
struggle of the elements,

57
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,103
earth, air, fire, and water.

58
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,546
And so volcanic activity
today, while less frequent,

59
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,261
tells us that the battle continues.

60
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,503
Mr. Taylor, welcome back.

61
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,146
These images were recorded
in Hualalai in 2000.

62
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,963
They are spectacular, beautiful,

63
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,196
but proof at the same time of how

64
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,253
unpredictable and
unmerciful nature can be.

65
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,926
All of these events remind us

66
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,986
that our survival as a species

67
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,096
is dependent upon our
ability to understand

68
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,333
and adapt to the planet's
ongoing evolution.

69
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,326
Hence volcanology,

70
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,316
despite Mr. Taylor's earlier
assertions to the contrary,

71
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,363
has nothing to do with Mr. Spock
or the Starship Enterprise,

72
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:19,906
but rather is the study of
the earth's blood pressure.

73
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,930
Its life force carries
us from our distant past,

74
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,896
right up to the present

75
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,694
and tells us much about our future.

76
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,750
I know I went over,

77
00:07:32,774 --> 00:07:34,466
but I did want to give
you guys a sneak preview

78
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,316
of what you have to look
forward to next semester.

79
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,676
Remember to put your term papers

80
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,686
on the desk on your way out.

81
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,766
As always, I look forward

82
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,040
to being shocked and
awed by your brilliance.

83
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,205
- Dr. Shepherd,

84
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:53,526
sorry, do you have a sec?

85
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,536
- As of two minutes ago

86
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,410
I've got a whole week's worth of 'em.

87
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,126
What can I do for you, miss?

88
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,960
- Brianna Chapman,

89
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:01,326
I was in your thermodynamics
lab last semester.

90
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,686
- You're one of my grad students?

91
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,123
- I was, but then I sort of shifted gears.

92
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,096
- Is that so?

93
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,930
To what?

94
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,016
- Geochemistry actually.

95
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,850
- Well, that'd be here

96
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:11,946
and we can use all the help
we can get in that field.

97
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,526
- That is exactly why I
wanted to talk to you.

98
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,616
I heard about your expedition

99
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,929
that you're taking to
Iceland over the break.

100
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:17,939
- I don't suppose you
heard about that trip

101
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,616
from my illustrious TA did you?

102
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,236
- Christopher, did he tell you about me?

103
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,856
- No, but,

104
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,873
you're definitely his type.

105
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,156
- I want to come with you.

106
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,126
- Sorry, I've already filled
my quota of student volunteers.

107
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:43,977
- Oh, well I happen to know

108
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,696
that your chemist dropped out last minute.

109
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,906
- Do me a favor.

110
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,446
When you see your friend, Christopher,

111
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,376
tell him I'm going to wring his neck.

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,793
- I can do this job.

113
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,076
- It's not going to be some
clean, controlled environment,

114
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,236
you know, we're going
to be taking samples,

115
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,106
doing field analysis on the fly.

116
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,696
- And I'm not afraid
to get my hands dirty.

117
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,196
And I've spent time at volcanoes.

118
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,846
My family had a reunion
in Hawaii last year

119
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,023
and I spent the whole
entire time at Mauna Kea

120
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,626
and my Aunt Grace was not
very happy about that.

121
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,246
- Sorry, never get it past the trustees.

122
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,016
- Oh, but I'm not looking
for recommendation or credit.

123
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,206
I just, I just really want to get

124
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,326
some more field experience under my belt.

125
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,750
- Nobody can fault you
for a lack of enthusiasm.

126
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,449
Look, if I were to agree,

127
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:22,676
there would have to be conditions.

128
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,896
- Such as?

129
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,833
- No recommendations or credit.

130
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,706
I'd expect your very best at all times.

131
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,673
You'd have to buy your own plane ticket.

132
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:36,606
Okay, you win.

133
00:09:37,463 --> 00:09:38,317
- Thank you.

134
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:39,586
Oh, you will not regret this,

135
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,666
I could hug you right now.

136
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,786
And when I published my first book,

137
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,676
you are so getting a
shout out in the forward.

138
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,166
- Can I give you a tip?

139
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,000
- Don't hug you?

140
00:09:47,024 --> 00:09:49,556
- And bring warm clothes
'cause it's very cold

141
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,390
and be on time

142
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:51,896
because we're leaving
first thing in the morning.

143
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,857
- Yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, thank you.

144
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:04,177
- I'm telling you this girl's amazing.

145
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:06,776
She's smart, she's funny, she's cool.

146
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,023
- She's a Hottie McNaughty.

147
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:10,736
What, that's what you said.

148
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,867
- By the way,

149
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:12,701
why don't you try
consulting with me next time

150
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:15,226
before using your job as
an excuse to pick up girls.

151
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,096
- That's unfair.

152
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,930
I honestly thought that

153
00:10:16,954 --> 00:10:18,996
she's be a valuable member of the team.

154
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,830
- Meaning what?

155
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,676
She already shot you down once?

156
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,226
- Well, I kind of had a thing for her

157
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,536
and then I kind of had a
thing for her roommate.

158
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,370
It's complicated.

159
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:27,830
- Yeah, with you it usually is.

160
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:30,446
- But you're not upset, right?

161
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,116
- No, no.

162
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:32,950
I do have a few things

163
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:35,596
I'd like you to take a
look at during the break.

164
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,136
Tough but fair.

165
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,046
I'm gonna go check in with the pilot.

166
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,306
- Good to see you're still doing your part

167
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,436
in putting the T and A back in being a TA.

168
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,556
- Look, I know you're upset about

169
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,216
our little boys club getting busted up,

170
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,826
but I'm telling you, even
you will like this girl.

171
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,856
She's really smart.

172
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,826
- Well, given that
she's apparently managed

173
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,700
to resist your dubious charms,
I rather like her already.

174
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,486
- Damn, Phil, you weren't kidding.

175
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,173
- No, Phil, I wasn't.

176
00:11:09,997 --> 00:11:11,033
- Hi.

177
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:16,266
- Jacques, Kai, this is Brianna.

178
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,221
- Hi.

179
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:18,054
Nice to meet you.

180
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:18,887
- I'm Kai.
- Bri.

181
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,756
- Can I give you a hand with that?

182
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
- Sure.

183
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,540
- This way.

184
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,146
- Okay, no way she goes to Raven,

185
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,066
believe me, I'd have noticed.

186
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,736
- Maybe if you spent more time outside

187
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,196
and less time in your
room pirating porn DVDs.

188
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,496
- Hey, bro, that school ain't cheap.

189
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,006
Guy's gotta make a living.

190
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,076
- All right, we're all here,

191
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,650
let's get the show on the road.

192
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:03,763
- So I don't understand, why Iceland?

193
00:12:03,787 --> 00:12:05,486
- Yeah, man, all I know about
Iceland is that it's all,

194
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,676
well, ice.

195
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,056
- That's Greenland, Phil, you jackass.

196
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,435
- We're going to Iceland
because it's been estimated

197
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,736
that 1/3rd of all the lava
that's ever flowed upon the earth

198
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,906
has come from there.

199
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,586
- And there was a team of geologists

200
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,537
exploring a crater there

201
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:19,036
that have gone missing.

202
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,236
- Well, that sounds more like a job

203
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,226
for the Icelandic Search and Rescue, Phil.

204
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,386
- Except seismic reports
show that apparently

205
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,146
there was a sudden eruption
when they disappeared.

206
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,559
- And the professor has a theory

207
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,870
that the volcano that we're visiting

208
00:12:30,894 --> 00:12:31,989
is actually a few million years older

209
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:33,093
than the experts say it is.

210
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,671
The government gave him
a grant to prove it.

211
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:36,909
- So what if we prove it?

212
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:39,626
It's not like we win a car or something.

213
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,646
- Science is about the
search for truth, not glory.

214
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,656
- I didn't say they had to

215
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,553
name a national holiday after my ass.

216
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:46,992
All I'm saying is

217
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,616
if I'm gonna be spending my break

218
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,796
freezing my butt off in ass end of nowhere

219
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,203
instead of living in up in Miami or Cabo,

220
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,326
I at least want to see
some real action, you know?

221
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,160
- Well, it is

222
00:12:57,184 --> 00:12:58,766
the most volcanically active
country on the planet.

223
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,846
Maybe you'll get your chance.

224
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,166
- I thought I read
somewhere that Grimsvotn

225
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,396
hasn't blown his top in like, 700 years.

226
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,420
- She hasn't.

227
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:37,596
- And we are a go for
geothermal and seismic, Phil.

228
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,656
Looks like she's sleeping like a baby.

229
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,080
- Copy that, Phil.

230
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:59,482
- Dr. Shepherd, this is amazing!

231
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,836
I feel like I'm in another
world or something.

232
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,935
- You and Jules Verne, "Voyage
to the Center of the Earth."

233
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,676
This was their point of origin.

234
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,066
You couldn't ask for
more pure, active example

235
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,913
of earth's ongoing evolution.

236
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:23,916
- And on that note, should
we get back to work?

237
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,907
Unless, of course, any of you fancy

238
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:26,306
spending the entire afternoon

239
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,180
basking in the stench of rotten eggs.

240
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:32,146
- Alright, Kai, you want
to hold down the fort?

241
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,356
We're gonna be taking some samples.

242
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,586
- Yeah, try not to eat all the food.

243
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,910
- Yeah, copy that.

244
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:50,630
- So let me ask you something.

245
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:53,873
What is the deal with you and
Kai and the Phil, Phil thing?

246
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,436
- It's just a thing.

247
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,036
- Oh, is it like a girl thing

248
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,483
or just haven't been in a
group long enough thing?

249
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,823
- Easy, Miss Insecurity.

250
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,306
No, I dated this PT major last year

251
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,706
and for some weird reason
she didn't like Kai.

252
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,045
So whenever he called the apartment

253
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:14,949
he called himself Phil.

254
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:17,163
So then I started calling
him Phil all the time.

255
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:19,699
And he started calling
me Phil all the time

256
00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:21,613
and just sort of stuck.

257
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,393
- Jacques, check it out.

258
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:32,436
- It looks like an ammonite,

259
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,486
which would place this site
at the Mesozoic at least,

260
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,956
if not the Devonian,

261
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,373
which means bravo, professor.

262
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,296
- So what is the deal with Dr. Shepherd?

263
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,610
- What do you mean?

264
00:15:49,634 --> 00:15:51,334
- I don't know, he's just kinda...

265
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:55,193
- He's married.

266
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,846
- Oh, he's married.

267
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,870
- Separated.

268
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:00,509
I guess she got tired

269
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:03,306
of chasing him into smoldering
holes in the ground.

270
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,306
That definitely felt like a tremor.

271
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,126
- Kai, talk to me, was that us?

272
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,010
- No, I got a spike, but I
don't know where it came from.

273
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:24,862
Hang on, we're offline.

274
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:28,303
Quake must have jarred the sensors loose.

275
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:32,422
- There's definitely
some activity going on.

276
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:34,258
- What happened to the 700 years?

277
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:36,653
- I don't know, I guess
there's hope for Jacques yet.

278
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:42,055
- I, I can get it.

279
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,802
- Kai, contact the chopper,
I know this isn't the goal,

280
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:45,966
but I don't want to wait
around and find out.

281
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,990
CJ, Bri!

282
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,303
- Way ahead of you, doc.

283
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,473
- Not again.

284
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,986
- Mayday, mayday,
this is Exodus Expedition.

285
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,443
- Go ahead Exodus, what is your emergency?

286
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:09,646
- The volcano's become active.

287
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,976
We need immediate extraction, do you copy?

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,793
- Copy, Exodus, emergency
evac is on its way.

289
00:17:21,747 --> 00:17:23,536
- All right, Jacques,
let's go, we're out of here.

290
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,370
- Wait a minute, sir.

291
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:25,567
- When are you gonna
know when to walk away?

292
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:27,126
Let's go.

293
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,846
It isn't worth it, now come on, move.

294
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,120
- I can get it.

295
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:35,289
- Let's go!

296
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:37,395
- I can get it.

297
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,150
I got it!

298
00:17:58,192 --> 00:17:59,192
- Here.

299
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,496
- Team Exodus, Team Exodus,

300
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,653
This is Iceland Transport, do you copy?

301
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,236
- Copy, Iceland Transport.

302
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,655
- Rescue chopper is in route,

303
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,576
ETA five minutes.

304
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,525
- Copy that, Iceland Transport.

305
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:17,626
- Kai, what's the ETA on that chopper?

306
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,336
It's getting kind of hot down here.

307
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,723
- Guy said we're looking
at another five minutes.

308
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,083
Wind's been picking up big time.

309
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:36,388
- Keep going, we're right behind you!

310
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,316
- The heat vents are
melting the glacier, sir.

311
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,226
That means-

312
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,107
- If it collapses

313
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:49,916
you and I are a permanent
part of the landscape

314
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,750
so keep climbing.

315
00:18:50,774 --> 00:18:51,916
- We'll never make it.

316
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,383
- Yes, we will, now come on!

317
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,100
- Come on, let's go!

318
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,056
- Come on, Jacques,
it's just a little further.

319
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Come on.

320
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,236
- We gotta get out of here!

321
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,786
- There's two more people down there!

322
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,146
- If we don't
get off this rock now

323
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,670
we'll never make it out alive!

324
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,430
- All right, guys, let's go!

325
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:37,621
You can do it!

326
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:39,804
That's it.

327
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
Come on.

328
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:47,742
Watch your step.

329
00:20:21,877 --> 00:20:23,358
- Thank you.

330
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:24,546
- You okay?

331
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,086
- Yeah, I'm fine.

332
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,706
But since you're the one
looking for some action,

333
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,796
might I suggest that the next time

334
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,946
you go inside the volcano

335
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,686
and I'll stay at the
top with the equipment?

336
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,849
- Hey man, if it'd been my
fat ass out in that crater

337
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:36,066
it would've been a deep
fried pork rind right now.

338
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,583
- We should be so lucky.

339
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,033
- Oh my god.

340
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,396
Look at that, never seen anything like it.

341
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,266
- Nobody ever has.

342
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,836
The fact that I went off today

343
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,643
definitely supports
Vallian's Exodus theory.

344
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,896
- Volcanic
activity has subsided for now,

345
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,236
but the skies remained
choked with smoke and ash

346
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,781
and fall out has been experienced
as far away as Sweden.

347
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:25,066
With the death toll now
at an estimated 3,400

348
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,956
this eruption in Iceland is being called

349
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,836
the worst volcano related disaster

350
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,993
since the eruption of
Mount Pinatubo in 1991.

351
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,746
Meanwhile, scientists believe

352
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,676
they have traced the source of activity,

353
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,286
centered mainly on
Iceland's western peninsula,

354
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,156
to the apparent accidental rupturing

355
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,366
of several natural vents

356
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,336
by an off offshore drilling operation

357
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,500
in the North Atlantic late last week.

358
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
- She's pretty.

359
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,579
- Yes, she is.

360
00:21:54,603 --> 00:21:55,953
- That your wife?

361
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
- For now.

362
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,773
- Sorry, Christopher told me.

363
00:22:02,098 --> 00:22:04,393
- Is there anything he hasn't told you?

364
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,433
- Do you want to talk about it?

365
00:22:09,457 --> 00:22:12,876
- No, what, my TA's
astounding ability to share

366
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,550
the intimate details of my
personal life with others?

367
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,933
- No, I meant your wife,

368
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,546
he told me that you guys are separated.

369
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,770
Then maybe I could help.

370
00:22:25,228 --> 00:22:26,513
- I doubt it.

371
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:31,576
- Well, have you tried
calling and apologizing?

372
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,223
- I did actually try a couple of times,

373
00:22:33,247 --> 00:22:35,786
but I just couldn't get past

374
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,483
the listening to her voice on
the answering machine part.

375
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
- So try again.

376
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,563
- Yeah, no, I know, you're right.

377
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,626
Hey, can I ask you something?

378
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,896
- Sure.

379
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,176
- Two dormant volcanoes,
I mean completely dormant,

380
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,996
erupt violently within days of each other.

381
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,020
Coincidence?

382
00:22:59,527 --> 00:23:01,293
- Good luck with the phone call.

383
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,920
- Yeah, I didn't think so either.

384
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,706
Hey Melanie, is he here?

385
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,730
- He's inside.

386
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,870
Good to see you.

387
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:38,346
- Good to see you, how are you?

388
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,370
- Good.

389
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,576
- How's Natalie?

390
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,653
- She's fine.

391
00:23:48,112 --> 00:23:49,112
I guess she's fine.

392
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,990
I hear she's fine.

393
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,536
Actually, you'd have to
call and ask her yourself,

394
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,626
maybe then she'd pick up the phone.

395
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,693
- It's like I told you,

396
00:23:59,717 --> 00:24:01,646
you can't spend the rest of your life

397
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,266
going down in those holes

398
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,366
without screwing everything up.

399
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,376
- You're one to talk.

400
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,396
I don't exactly see you slowing down.

401
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,076
- I lost some mobility,
you lost a marriage,

402
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,686
big difference.

403
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,466
- Some would argue that
marriage is a loss of mobility,

404
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,280
but I'm not saying that.

405
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,646
Anyway, how are things at USGS?

406
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,676
Kincaid still a jerk?

407
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,836
- Yeah,

408
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,386
he was a jerk when you
two were my students

409
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,696
and he was a bigger jerk

410
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,406
when I told him where he could stuff it,

411
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,906
so yeah, he's still a jerk.

412
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,536
- You what?

413
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
- I quit.

414
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,454
- You're kidding me.

415
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,871
- You remember what that place is like.

416
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:45,276
You get to be my age you ran
out of patience for politics.

417
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,823
It's a young man's game now.

418
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:49,516
And I could never get used to the idea

419
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,376
that one of my former
students was now my boss.

420
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,756
- Wow, I had no idea.

421
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,306
When did all this happen?

422
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,876
- Four months ago.

423
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,867
And you would have known

424
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:01,016
if you'd pick up the damn
phone once in a while.

425
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,040
- Me?

426
00:25:02,838 --> 00:25:03,906
- You're the one whose
phone was disconnected.

427
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,363
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

428
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:09,716
What's with the sheets,
you going somewhere?

429
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,346
- Yeah, we're flying
to Honshu on Wednesday.

430
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,876
- Wednesday, yes.

431
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
- Wednesday.

432
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,916
- Planning on staying awhile?

433
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,736
- As long as necessary.

434
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,570
- Hmm.

435
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:23,413
Well, with that in mind,

436
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:26,033
take a look at this.

437
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,596
- Grimsvotn, quite a mess, so I hear.

438
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,786
- It is, I was there.

439
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:38,096
- And the word is you took
along a team of rugrats.

440
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,746
- They're great scientists, Oskar.

441
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,856
- I'm sure they are.

442
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,230
You always could pick them.

443
00:25:44,298 --> 00:25:46,096
What is this?

444
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,881
- You tell me, could Cotacachi, Ecuador.

445
00:25:49,905 --> 00:25:51,711
Then 48 hours later,

446
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:55,406
five near simultaneous
eruptions in Iceland,

447
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,530
four of which hadn't made a peep in years.

448
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,273
It's the kind of thing
you've always talked about.

449
00:26:01,297 --> 00:26:03,114
You were right about Exodus
and this is the start of it.

450
00:26:03,138 --> 00:26:04,543
- No, it's not.

451
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,466
- What do you mean, no, it's not?

452
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,616
If these aren't the initial
indications of Exodus,

453
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,717
I'd love to know what the hell it is.

454
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,646
- First eruption happened here,

455
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,956
five weeks ago, off the coast of Spain.

456
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,146
Then here, two days later,

457
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,656
at Rarotonga in the South Pacific.

458
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,026
Then nothing, nothing for weeks

459
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,736
to the point where I began to think

460
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,276
that everyone else was right

461
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,726
and I was just grabbing at straws.

462
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,103
Then earthquakes here, here and here.

463
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,566
Of course I hadn't counted on Iceland

464
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,456
until sometime next week

465
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,066
and Cotacachi was a surprise.

466
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,306
- So?

467
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,630
- So this cannot be the start of Exodus

468
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:52,763
because Exodus already started.

469
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,456
- You gotta do something with it,

470
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,116
just take it to Kincaid.

471
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,966
Kincaid said the USGS
doesn't have the time

472
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,656
or the resources to prove some
old crackpot's hypothesis.

473
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,136
I'm done trying to prove anything

474
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,354
to people who don't want to listen.

475
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:09,556
- Isn't that what you're
going to Mount Fuji for,

476
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,306
to get proof?

477
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,316
Unless you're secretly hoping

478
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,996
that the myth of the fountain
of youth isn't a myth.

479
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,276
- You all already said it, Peter,

480
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,736
this was my life's work and no one cares.

481
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,756
- Then the hell with
Kincaid, go over his head,

482
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,607
take it to the Hill.

483
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,726
- It's the same game everywhere,

484
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,276
you of all people should know that.

485
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,686
- I understand if you don't want to do it,

486
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,276
but at least give me a shot,

487
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,800
you know what's at stake here.

488
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,976
- Take it.

489
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,127
Take all of it.

490
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,803
You and I both know
where I'm going and why.

491
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,510
I don't want to end my
life in some hospital room.

492
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,773
I'm going back to the front line.

493
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Goodbye, Peter.

494
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,933
- CJ, I need you to
look up a number for me,

495
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:11,481
Stephen Daugherty

496
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:14,473
at the Bureau of Disaster
Relief and Awareness.

497
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,410
Call me back as soon as you can.

498
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,357
- Dr. Shepherd,

499
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,326
are you saying that you
can accurately predict

500
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,676
where and when these eruptions will occur?

501
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,006
- Given the proper resources, yes.

502
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,816
- Right now, all we're looking at

503
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,866
are generalities, probability.

504
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,839
The point here is what some
may see as a coincidence,

505
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:39,296
I think is the earth trying
to tell us something.

506
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,546
And in my experience, when that happens,

507
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,320
it's usually a good idea to listen.

508
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,276
- My apologies, gentlemen.

509
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,169
- Peter, I believe,
you know William Kincaid

510
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:51,245
from the US Geological Survey.

511
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:52,797
- Our paths have crossed, yes.

512
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:53,956
Would you like me to recap?

513
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,226
- Thanks, but I'm sure
I'll be able to catch up.

514
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,396
Please continue.

515
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,736
- Basically, we're seeing a
massive increase in activity

516
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,726
on a worldwide scale.

517
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,986
Now, I don't believe

518
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,316
that these are a succession
of random volcanic events.

519
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,190
I think they're part of a pattern

520
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,986
which, if ignored,

521
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,336
could have serious consequences

522
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,446
to the future of life on this planet.

523
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,786
- Peter, tell me you're not here

524
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,276
to sell us this Exodus crap again.

525
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,606
- What's Exodus?

526
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,536
- It's a halfback theory first put forth

527
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,146
by Dr. Shepherd's mentor, Oskar Vallian.

528
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,579
- It's anything but half baked.

529
00:29:25,603 --> 00:29:27,556
- What Dr. Shepherd is suggesting

530
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,386
runs contrary to theories

531
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,906
the global scientific community

532
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,436
has unanimously subscribed
to for nearly half a century.

533
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,950
Volcanoes don't just erupt.

534
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:39,856
There are warning signs weeks,

535
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,686
sometimes months in advance.

536
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,626
- The global scientific community

537
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,250
unanimously subscribed to
the flat earth theory too.

538
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:50,246
I understand that this sounds farfetched,

539
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,046
but in order to understand Exodus,

540
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,246
you have to see the bigger picture.

541
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,876
Something has happened at the earth's core

542
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,736
causing it to expand.

543
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,476
The tremendous pressure
that has been displaced

544
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,776
is now working its way through the earth,

545
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,316
manifesting itself in these
accelerated eruptions.

546
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,896
The traditional warning
signs no longer apply,

547
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,666
not here, not to this.

548
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,539
- And what exactly is this something

549
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,706
that has caused the core's expansion?

550
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,806
Or does your theory not cover that?

551
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,936
- It could be any number
of different things.

552
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,693
What is causing the pattern
is beside the point.

553
00:30:22,717 --> 00:30:24,766
Look, we can figure that out later,

554
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,236
right now we need to
figure out how to stop it.

555
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,086
- Dr. Shepherd,

556
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,756
I'm afraid I just don't see the emergency.

557
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,980
- How else can I put it?

558
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:37,936
There are 1,500 volcanoes
on the surface of the earth.

559
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,270
Some of them are active and
some of them are dormant.

560
00:30:40,294 --> 00:30:44,736
Over 150 of them are located
in North America alone.

561
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,067
If they erupt, and I think they will.

562
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:50,506
We are looking at cataclysmic devastation.

563
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,716
- What's your worst case scenario?

564
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,776
- Gentlemen, I think
it's my duty to point out

565
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,759
that none of Dr.
Shepherd's so-called theory

566
00:30:55,783 --> 00:30:56,946
has yet to be proven.

567
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,086
- Dr. Kincaid-

568
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,186
- He could be completely wrong.

569
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,760
- Please allow Dr. Shepherd
to answer the question.

570
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,023
- Worst case scenario,

571
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,780
the extinction of everything
living on the planet.

572
00:31:11,482 --> 00:31:13,096
- How long do we have?

573
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
- Months?

574
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,486
- Thank you, Dr. Shepherd,

575
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,606
I believe I've heard enough.

576
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,186
I want you and your team
to go over his data,

577
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,256
see if there's anything to it.

578
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,276
If there is, come up with a
list of possible solutions.

579
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
- I'd be glad to.

580
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,340
- Thank you, gentlemen.

581
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,426
- You're an alarmist, Peter,
just like the old man.

582
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,566
Still, that was quite a
presentation you made back there.

583
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,476
The extinction of every
living thing on this planet,

584
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,756
compelling!

585
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,036
Oskar Vallian write that for you?

586
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,293
- You're not even going to
review my data, are you?

587
00:31:48,317 --> 00:31:50,426
- Oh no, I'll review it.

588
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,746
I'll review it very carefully

589
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,446
and prove that your little
theory is complete crap.

590
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,666
And the amazing thing here is

591
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,141
that by doing that, I'll
be doing you a favor.

592
00:31:58,165 --> 00:31:59,677
- How's that?

593
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:01,606
- Have you forgotten what tends to happen

594
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,746
whenever you start jumping the gun?

595
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,156
Tungurahua, Sakurajima.

596
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,986
- I was doing my job.

597
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,156
If those volcanoes had erupted

598
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,936
tens of thousands of
people would have died.

599
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,816
- Yes, and instead millions
of dollars were lost

600
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,650
and those same people

601
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:17,156
were placed in a state of
fear and panic for no reason.

602
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,326
- I guess I'm missing your point.

603
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,113
- My point is you have a
long history of being wrong.

604
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,590
I'd imagine by now you'd
be quite used to it.

605
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,730
- There she is, just in time.

606
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
- Morning, Harv.

607
00:32:53,214 --> 00:32:54,214
Here you go.

608
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,576
There's a couple Danish in
here with your name on it.

609
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,976
- Natalie, you know I shouldn't.

610
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,223
- Yeah, I know you will.

611
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:01,526
I don't care what Lorraine says.

612
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,666
I like a man with a few
extra pounds on him.

613
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,500
- Hey, you missed

614
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,966
all the excitement
around here this morning.

615
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,807
It seems like Old Faithful

616
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,856
decided she didn't like her name anymore.

617
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,767
- What do you mean?

618
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,640
- Not so much as a burp
since yesterday afternoon.

619
00:33:26,622 --> 00:33:29,659
- So what are they gonna do?

620
00:33:29,683 --> 00:33:31,906
- In a word, nothing.

621
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:32,930
- Nothing?

622
00:33:33,623 --> 00:33:34,966
- I guess the government's
decided to sit around

623
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,276
with their thumbs up their butts

624
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,616
till we're all knee deep lava

625
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,786
before they decide to do something.

626
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,776
- A little more eloquent explanation,

627
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
thank you, Kai.

628
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,223
Government wants proof.

629
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,716
I guess we have to get it for 'em.

630
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,146
Look, as you guys all know,

631
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,646
Oskar Vallian is the mind
behind this theory, right?

632
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,670
Well, guess what?

633
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,446
He thinks Mount Fuji is gonna erupt

634
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,113
within the next three weeks.

635
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,009
- I want you and Konomi
to go back to Tokyo.

636
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:29,523
- Konomi, there's a car
waiting for you outside.

637
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,526
- Yes, but I'm not finished with my work.

638
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,013
- Just go.
- Yes, ma'am.

639
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,386
- I said both of you.

640
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,220
- Oskar.

641
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,806
- You're a young woman

642
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:43,196
and you have your entire
life ahead of you.

643
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,576
- You've been my entire life for 12 years.

644
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,576
I'm not going to leave you now.

645
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,547
- Melanie.

646
00:34:48,571 --> 00:34:50,216
- Don't say anything,

647
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
I'm staying.

648
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,726
- And to that end, he's gone off to Honshu

649
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,876
to gather data directly.

650
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,283
In the meantime, I'll be going to Ecuador.

651
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,273
If our theory is correct

652
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:26,166
and these recent volcanic events

653
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,696
are like dominoes in a long chain,

654
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,132
each linked to a tectonic plate

655
00:35:32,156 --> 00:35:35,216
through a series of
interconnecting fault lines.

656
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,226
Our job would then be to ascertain,

657
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,446
not only why all of this is happening,

658
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,318
but which faults are being affected

659
00:35:41,342 --> 00:35:44,453
and which volcanoes are
likely to go off next.

660
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,100
I'm not gonna lie to you,

661
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,176
this is gonna be dangerous.

662
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,825
So if any of you have any reservations,

663
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:56,186
especially after what happened in Iceland,

664
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,513
believe me, I'll understand.

665
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,016
- It's not even an issue.

666
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,806
Count me in.

667
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,146
- Me too.

668
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,206
- Well, seeing that it's
the only chance we've got

669
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,057
of proving any of this,

670
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,671
we don't have much of a choice, do we?

671
00:36:09,695 --> 00:36:12,209
- Yeah, if we're gonna
be working with you,

672
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:14,326
does that mean you're
exempt from everything else?

673
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,893
Because I got this major
biochem paper due next Tuesday.

674
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,807
What?

675
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:22,027
I'm just asking.

676
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:23,857
But I'm totally in.

677
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:24,881
- Good.

678
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:45,523
Hi, sorry, I guess you're out.

679
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,979
Unless you're standing
there listening to this,

680
00:36:48,003 --> 00:36:50,933
waiting for me to hang
up so you can hit delete.

681
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,200
Which I can only assume
is what you've done

682
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:55,536
the last three times-

683
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,666
- Hey.

684
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,940
- You answered.

685
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,786
- Right, shouldn't you be

686
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,110
climbing into some smoking
hole in the ground?

687
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,429
- Okay, I got it.

688
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:07,736
I guess this was a bad idea,

689
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,570
I shouldn't have called.

690
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:11,455
- Well, what did you expect
this to be like, Peter?

691
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,289
- Oh, I don't know.

692
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,480
I guess civil would have
been too much to hope for.

693
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,123
- Fine, let's start over.

694
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,550
How are you?

695
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:25,076
- Been better.

696
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,726
- Why? What's the matter?

697
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,606
- A little run in with Bill Kincaid today.

698
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,733
- Kincaid, how's he?

699
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,567
- Slimy as ever,

700
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:36,549
but look, I didn't call to talk about him.

701
00:37:36,573 --> 00:37:38,396
- Then why did you call?

702
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,906
- To hear your voice,
to see how you're doing.

703
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,216
- Well, this is a little
out of character, Peter.

704
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,966
Are you sure that's the reason?

705
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,990
- Yeah, I...

706
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,247
So, how are you doing?

707
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:53,396
How's life at Yellowstone?

708
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,346
- Well, apparently
mother nature has decided

709
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,606
to make my life a living hell

710
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,506
with fire season in the middle of winter,

711
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,846
but other than that, everything's fine.

712
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,827
Peter, you sound weird.

713
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:03,446
Are you sure you're okay?

714
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,650
- What?

715
00:38:04,674 --> 00:38:05,866
Yes.

716
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,903
Just worrying about you.

717
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,995
- Listen, I should really get going.

718
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:14,106
They have me supervising
these sunrise trail walks

719
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,503
three times a week, so.

720
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:17,923
- Well, great talking to you.

721
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:20,426
Nice to hear you finally say something

722
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,746
other than hello, this is Natalie,

723
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,446
please leave a message after the beep.

724
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,534
- Take care of yourself, Peter.

725
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:28,057
- You too.

726
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:29,581
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

727
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:18,990
- Hello, you've reached

728
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:20,436
the voicemail box of Peter Shepherd.

729
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,410
After the tone, please leave a message.

730
00:39:26,421 --> 00:39:31,076
- Peter, I just want to
give you a last message.

731
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,023
It's good to be on the front line again.

732
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,413
- Oskar, we gotta go.
- No.

733
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,529
- Let's go, Oskar.
- It's too late, no.

734
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,357
- It's good to be
on the frontline again.

735
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,650
- Hi.

736
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Try this instead.

737
00:40:18,724 --> 00:40:20,756
I'm sorry about your friend.

738
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,483
Maybe he wasn't there, maybe he got out.

739
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:26,568
- No, he was there.

740
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,583
He knew what was gonna happen.

741
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:29,893
It was what he wanted.

742
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,230
- To die?

743
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,160
- He didn't have anything left to give.

744
00:40:36,462 --> 00:40:38,403
He sacrificed everything,

745
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,246
family, career,

746
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:45,116
for a theory that nobody
would pay any attention to.

747
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,006
- Bet they're paying attention now.

748
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,180
- If it's not too late.

749
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:51,906
- Is that your wedding ring?

750
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:55,316
- Symbolic, huh?

751
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,053
Hanging in limbo.

752
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:01,453
- It's an interesting concept,
wedding ring purgatory.

753
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,516
I wanted to apologize for
what I said the other day

754
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,956
about your marriage, it
was none of my business.

755
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,316
There's this really serious
genetic condition in my family

756
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,616
called foot in mouth disease.

757
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,146
- You oughta get that looked at.

758
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,636
- Sorry, I was just trying to help.

759
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,176
- It's not that I don't appreciate it,

760
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,809
it's just that

761
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,636
I don't know if my failed marriage

762
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,210
is really appropriate
student teacher conversation.

763
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:27,616
- Well, technically we're
not really supposed to be

764
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,905
drinking beers together either.

765
00:41:29,929 --> 00:41:32,686
But then again, I'm not
your student this semester,

766
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,203
so maybe we're in the clear.

767
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,426
Can I ask you what happened?

768
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,826
- Basically, I spent the first
two years of our relationship

769
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,666
chasing after her

770
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,906
and then I spent the first
three years of our marriage

771
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:49,373
chasing after volcanoes,
dragging her with me.

772
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,416
I was all pretty much about my world.

773
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,921
And I guess she got fed up with that.

774
00:41:56,945 --> 00:41:59,863
Took off to go find a life of her own.

775
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,810
I screwed up.

776
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,990
- You really want it back?

777
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:08,136
- Nothing makes very
much sense without her,

778
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,160
but I haven't figured out how to fix it.

779
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,513
- Well, like I said before,
you can try apologizing.

780
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,160
- I have a hard time
admitting when I'm wrong.

781
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,136
Although, as someone
pointed out to me recently,

782
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,386
I should be used to it by now.

783
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,860
- You just admitted it to me.

784
00:42:27,116 --> 00:42:29,436
I don't know, maybe if
you give it some time

785
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,377
and you admit it to her

786
00:42:30,401 --> 00:42:33,083
you guys can have another chance.

787
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,416
- Maybe.

788
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,322
- But can I give you a tip?

789
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,926
- Don't hug you.

790
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,250
- No, don't wait too long.

791
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:44,417
- Thank you.

792
00:42:46,948 --> 00:42:48,365
- You're welcome.

793
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,746
- The sudden
eruption of Mount Fuji

794
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,616
has not only destroyed much of the island,

795
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,176
but has triggered several tsunamis,

796
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,856
the biggest in this part
of the world since 2004,

797
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,476
placing an estimated 60% of
the coast of China under water.

798
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,536
The death toll is likely to be
in the hundreds of thousands.

799
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,536
And breaking news from Africa.

800
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,006
- The first major
eruption of Mount Kilimanjaro

801
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,346
since the last ice age.

802
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,356
Many fear the danger from these eruptions

803
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,226
may be compounded by storm clouds,

804
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,413
creating a highly concentrated
form of acid rain.

805
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,886
- He never said anything about Africa.

806
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,636
And he told us Fuji wouldn't
go off for another month,

807
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,260
- But he did say it would erupt.

808
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,136
- He's grabbing at straws.

809
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,616
- Well, maybe you should consider

810
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,683
grabbing a handful or two for yourself.

811
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,606
- There's definitely some
major rocking and rolling

812
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,186
going down the lithosphere,

813
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,776
but it ain't from this site.

814
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,276
- He's right, it looks
like the epicenter's

815
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,496
maybe a mile, mile and a
half northwest of here.

816
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,056
- That would place us
somewhere in the vicinity

817
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,276
of this area here.

818
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,247
According to this,

819
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,673
there appears to be a series
of mines, copper mostly.

820
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:13,864
- Let's do it.

821
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,946
- What is it?

822
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:37,286
- It says this site is
closed until further notice

823
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:40,373
per order of the Auracona mining company.

824
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:43,016
- Well, it works for me.

825
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,390
I guess we're leaving then?

826
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:56,113
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

827
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,341
- What'd you say to him?

828
00:45:09,365 --> 00:45:11,777
- I said we're scientists,
that the company sent us.

829
00:45:11,801 --> 00:45:13,246
- For heaven's sake, tell
him we're not trespassing!

830
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,720
- Well, we sort of are, dude.

831
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,836
- Ask him what happened.

832
00:45:28,825 --> 00:45:31,973
- He said that there were
some men working at the mine

833
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:33,997
a few weeks ago when the
earth began to bleed fire.

834
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,851
Worse than fire, it
was like it was poison.

835
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:44,875
- Poison?

836
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,443
- Oh, we're not going in.

837
00:46:17,744 --> 00:46:19,446
- Go ahead and set up, Kai.

838
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,123
Everyone else, stay close.

839
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,583
- So this is what hell is like.

840
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,136
- Guys, this is definitely it.

841
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,710
I'm showing hot spots all
over the place down here.

842
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,117
- Which way do we go?

843
00:46:53,141 --> 00:46:54,747
- I'm not sure,

844
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:56,891
the map doesn't seem to show
this particular juncture.

845
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,063
- Heat's definitely
stronger in this direction.

846
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,620
- Anyone else feel

847
00:47:13,644 --> 00:47:15,493
like these walls are closing in?

848
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:21,068
- Definitely getting tighter in here.

849
00:47:21,092 --> 00:47:22,572
- It's also getting hotter.

850
00:47:54,031 --> 00:47:56,146
- This is it.

851
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,110
- Wow, it's a magma chamber.

852
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,416
- Looks like it's rising pretty fast.

853
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,140
- Yeah, a little too fast.

854
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,369
Let's get some rock and vapor samples

855
00:48:14,393 --> 00:48:15,893
then get the hell out of here.

856
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:19,463
- That's the best
idea I've heard all day.

857
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:45,002
- Do you think the radiation's

858
00:48:45,026 --> 00:48:47,339
coming from the magma?

859
00:48:47,363 --> 00:48:49,488
- We won't know until
they run the core samples,

860
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:50,894
but the levels are extremely high.

861
00:48:50,918 --> 00:48:53,596
It's no wonder they
closed this place down.

862
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,856
- Guys, just as an FYI,

863
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,616
I'm starting to pick up some major burps

864
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,636
on the seismal.

865
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:58,976
- Copy that, Kai.

866
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,106
Bri and I are already
making our way back to you.

867
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,923
Jacques and CJ are wrapping it up.

868
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:07,793
- Wait a moment, CJ.

869
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,667
- What is it now?

870
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:11,334
- You know, I'm not so certain

871
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:12,506
this tunnel is supposed to be here.

872
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:13,340
Our location is nowhere to be found.

873
00:49:13,364 --> 00:49:14,536
This just doesn't make sense.

874
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,493
According to this map, this
tunnel simply does not exist.

875
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,470
- Okay, Magellan,

876
00:49:19,494 --> 00:49:21,916
how do you explain the fact
that we're standing in it?

877
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,990
- I can't explain it.

878
00:49:24,323 --> 00:49:26,073
Unless. - Unless what?

879
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:28,796
- Well, I'm just beginning to wonder

880
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,507
if this isn't a tunnel,
but rather-

881
00:49:36,608 --> 00:49:41,608
This isn't a tunnel, it's a lava tube!

882
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,260
- Where's Jacques?
- He's gone.

883
00:50:22,284 --> 00:50:23,733
- He didn't make it, Kai.

884
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:40,066
- Doctor said that the burns
were mainly superficial,

885
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:40,900
except for on his leg.

886
00:50:40,924 --> 00:50:43,648
They're going to have to set
it before the skin graft,

887
00:50:43,672 --> 00:50:44,672
but it's gonna be okay.

888
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,860
- Good.

889
00:50:52,728 --> 00:50:56,316
- You can't blame yourself
for what happened down there.

890
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,440
Jacques and CJ knew the risks, we all did.

891
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:00,920
- The point is

892
00:51:00,944 --> 00:51:03,986
I never should have put anybody
at risk in the first place.

893
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,537
- But that's the job, right?

894
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:09,736
Look, Kai is upstairs right now

895
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,576
analyzing the samples we got.

896
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,600
We have a better handle on where and how

897
00:51:15,932 --> 00:51:17,479
magma flow is affecting the fault network.

898
00:51:17,503 --> 00:51:19,640
He didn't die for nothing.

899
00:51:20,865 --> 00:51:22,365
None of this is worth nothing.

900
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:25,807
I believe that, have to.

901
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,073
- Oh my god.

902
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:37,983
- Much of the historic
city of Rome lies in ruins

903
00:51:38,332 --> 00:51:40,556
following the reawakenings
of Mount Etna and Vesuvius.

904
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,446
The pope has proclaimed that he believes

905
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,406
this global devastation may be

906
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:46,080
the beginning of the end of days.

907
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:50,346
- Well, it's all happening
just like you said it would.

908
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:51,420
They wouldn't listen.

909
00:51:52,481 --> 00:51:53,983
- No, matter of time.

910
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:58,586
Where is this one?

911
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:59,986
- Crater in San Sebastian,

912
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,936
that's from down in the mine.

913
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,866
Numbers threw me off at first, too.

914
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:06,406
Math is constant and
crystallization levels.

915
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,646
I ran the test twice, they're for real.

916
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,646
- That's what this trace
levels of radioactive material,

917
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,116
43.7, 48.4?

918
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,057
- Those too,

919
00:52:14,081 --> 00:52:15,876
whole chemical compositions
in both samples

920
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,196
were out of whack.

921
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,825
I mean, it looks more like,

922
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:20,076
- Like it would have been taken

923
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,650
directly from the Earth's core.

924
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,856
- There's something else.

925
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,369
Who do we know at the USGS?

926
00:52:27,393 --> 00:52:28,319
- Why?

927
00:52:28,343 --> 00:52:29,152
What's happened?

928
00:52:29,176 --> 00:52:30,047
- When I went online

929
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:32,770
to compare all this stuff
to our databases from Raven,

930
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,256
I had problems getting into the server.

931
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,780
It looked like someone had
hacked into our system.

932
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,950
I did some backhacking

933
00:52:39,974 --> 00:52:42,317
and they got copies of everything we had.

934
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,486
- While I can understand how
you might feel somewhat angered

935
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,846
by whatever injustice you
may feel has occurred-

936
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,096
- You're damn right I'm angry,

937
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,046
you had no authority to do this.

938
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:59,680
- I assure you it was
done for the common good.

939
00:52:59,704 --> 00:53:01,396
- Look, there's still time.

940
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,346
If you just listen to
me, I could help you.

941
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:05,793
- Your help will no longer be necessary.

942
00:53:05,817 --> 00:53:08,843
My people have compiled
everything into a workable theory,

943
00:53:09,736 --> 00:53:11,596
which we will be presenting
in Washington tomorrow.

944
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,116
- So that's it?

945
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,873
Last week you didn't believe in Exodus,

946
00:53:14,897 --> 00:53:16,373
now you're stealing it.

947
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,780
- Goodbye, doctor.

948
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:22,950
- So now what?

949
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,474
- Listen, Dr. Shepherd and Kai

950
00:53:34,498 --> 00:53:36,763
need you more than I do at this point.

951
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:40,377
- I know, I just-

952
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:42,743
- I'll be fine, trust me.

953
00:53:44,213 --> 00:53:46,844
- Bri, we gotta to go now if
we're gonna catch that plane.

954
00:53:46,868 --> 00:53:47,868
- Okay.

955
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:50,976
Make sure you don't

956
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,140
hook up with any hot Columbia
nurses while I'm gone.

957
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,423
- Yes, I'd like to speak with
Stephen Daugherty please.

958
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,106
- Based on what we have seen so far

959
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,646
with regard to these eruptions,

960
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,396
while indeed the problem
is dire, Mr. President,

961
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,386
it is not insurmountable.

962
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,356
The key will be to relieve pressure

963
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:33,323
from within those volcanoes
that have yet to go off.

964
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:36,936
Excuse me, this is a closed meeting.

965
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,876
- Stephen, this meeting been
going on for half an hour now,

966
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:41,736
who are these people?

967
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,570
- Mr. President,

968
00:54:42,594 --> 00:54:43,686
I like to introduce you to the man

969
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:46,126
who first brought the Exodus
theory to our attention.

970
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,543
- Dr. Peter Shepherd, sir.

971
00:54:47,567 --> 00:54:49,336
And these are two of
my research associates,

972
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,416
Brianna Chapman, and Kai Senakoia.

973
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,930
- I was under the
impression that Dr. Kincaid

974
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:55,746
was the leading authority in all this.

975
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:57,196
- With all due respect, sir,

976
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,386
Dr. Oskar Vallian is the
leading authority on Exodus.

977
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,664
He and I worked very closely
together for many years-

978
00:55:02,688 --> 00:55:03,537
- I assure you, Dr. Shepherd,

979
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:05,466
the problem is in capable hands.

980
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:06,506
Now, may I suggest

981
00:55:06,530 --> 00:55:09,346
you take the science club
field trip elsewhere?

982
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:11,936
- Mr. President, Dr. Kincaid's
evidence is incomplete,

983
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,813
I can prove that.

984
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:13,966
- Ridiculous.

985
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:16,626
- You stole it off our server
in the first place, remember?

986
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,216
- Kai.

987
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,366
Excuse me, Mr. President,

988
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,097
There've been some new developments,

989
00:55:21,121 --> 00:55:24,646
developments that Dr.
Kincaid knows nothing about.

990
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,711
As a result he's likely to
draw the wrong conclusions

991
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:28,266
and this is not a situation

992
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,090
we can afford to make mistakes with.

993
00:55:33,615 --> 00:55:35,006
- All right.

994
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,026
We'll adjourn.

995
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:37,936
We'll meet back here in five minutes.

996
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,770
- Thank you, sir.

997
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,106
- Don't thank me yet.

998
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:41,406
I don't know what you've got,

999
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,493
but boy, it better be damn good.

1000
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:47,636
Now I don't know what the
hell is going on here.

1001
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,483
But I want to talk to the
two of you immediately.

1002
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,676
- There you are,
thought we lost you for a sec.

1003
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,756
- Is everything okay?

1004
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,926
- Fine.

1005
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:06,760
- Okay, Kai,

1006
00:56:06,784 --> 00:56:08,146
why don't you run ahead and
get things set up for us,

1007
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,170
be right with you.

1008
00:56:09,921 --> 00:56:10,731
- Sure thing.

1009
00:56:10,755 --> 00:56:12,026
- Sure you're okay?

1010
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:12,860
- I don't know, that depends.

1011
00:56:12,884 --> 00:56:14,076
Is it normal to throw up before you're

1012
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,086
about to present your theory

1013
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,447
on how the world is gonna end

1014
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:17,936
to the president of the United States?

1015
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,183
- I don't know, it's the
first time for me too,

1016
00:56:19,207 --> 00:56:21,886
but I will say I made a point of

1017
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:25,176
steering clear the chicken
Florentine on the flight up.

1018
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,157
Alright, ready to go knock
this one out of the park?

1019
00:56:27,181 --> 00:56:28,181
- Yeah.

1020
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,936
- So these layers
surrounding the earth's core

1021
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,686
serve as both filters and conductors

1022
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,106
for the heat and radiation

1023
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:42,192
that are essentially the fuel
that makes the planet run.

1024
00:56:42,216 --> 00:56:46,146
And it's been running pretty
well for a very long time,

1025
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,513
but there is one variable
that earth hadn't counted on.

1026
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:52,083
Us.

1027
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,066
By releasing toxins and radiation

1028
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:58,526
in ever increasing quantities
on the surface of the earth,

1029
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:02,216
man has sped up the internal
processes of the planet,

1030
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,223
generating an excessive heat at the core.

1031
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:09,086
It's caused an expansion to take place.

1032
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:12,797
It's pushing its way out
into the molten outer core.

1033
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:15,321
It's leading to these
large-scale volcanic events.

1034
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:20,706
- Basically it's like the
earth is trying to get rid of a

1035
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:23,083
really bad case of double
burrito indigestion.

1036
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,703
- Now her explanation I understand.

1037
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,826
- As fascinating as all
this may be, doctor,

1038
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,376
I'm afraid the purpose of this meeting

1039
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,186
isn't to determine how this began,

1040
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:38,586
rather how and when it's going to end.

1041
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,736
- Sooner than you might think.

1042
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,454
- That's a pretty bold statement

1043
00:57:42,478 --> 00:57:44,418
considering we haven't seen anything

1044
00:57:44,442 --> 00:57:46,736
remotely resembling what
you've been talking about,

1045
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,666
I mean, not here, not in this country.

1046
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,860
- I'm afraid that's about to change.

1047
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,726
And not just in this country.

1048
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,186
If you look here,

1049
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:58,636
you'll see fault lines radiating
out from the earth's core,

1050
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,626
coursing through the planet,

1051
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,886
linking together with tectonic plates

1052
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:04,615
like veins and arteries.

1053
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:08,986
These points indicate where
eruptions have already occurred.

1054
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,579
You might notice that

1055
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:14,186
they've all taken place
along a major fault line,

1056
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:16,623
which puts pressure on various plates,

1057
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,566
particularly the Pacific
and the North American.

1058
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,083
- What does that mean to us?

1059
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,886
- That we can expect
increased eruption patterns

1060
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,376
in Hawaii within the next 24 hours,

1061
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,836
followed by both volcanic
and seismic activity

1062
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,896
along the Rockies, all
the way up into Alaska.

1063
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,106
And that's just for starters.

1064
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,780
- This is a recent satellite
image of the atmosphere.

1065
00:58:42,055 --> 00:58:45,172
Now, based on the current rate

1066
00:58:45,196 --> 00:58:46,006
at which these eruptions are occurring,

1067
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:48,926
here's a projection of how
it will look in two days,

1068
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:49,950
one week,

1069
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:53,490
two weeks.

1070
00:59:00,747 --> 00:59:01,557
- Are you trying to tell me

1071
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:03,480
that we could be looking
at another ice age?

1072
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:08,736
- If these eruptions
continue unabated, yes.

1073
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,318
- And how are we supposed to shut down

1074
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:13,436
every volcano on Earth?

1075
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,556
- Believe it or not,

1076
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,730
I actually have a plan.

1077
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:17,913
- We're all ears, doctor.

1078
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:20,569
- The planet is going to

1079
00:59:20,593 --> 00:59:24,046
continue to discharge
this volcanic material.

1080
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:25,786
The question is, where do you want it,

1081
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:28,696
on the land or under the ocean?

1082
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,066
- And what are you suggesting, doctor?

1083
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:32,676
- Rather than letting the planet decide

1084
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,756
where and when to erupt,

1085
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,126
we released the pressure for her.

1086
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:37,150
- How?

1087
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:39,227
- We would need to develop

1088
00:59:39,251 --> 00:59:42,806
a somewhat more sophisticated
oceanographic floor plan.

1089
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:45,789
But we would pick strategic
geological targets

1090
00:59:45,813 --> 00:59:49,436
to detonate a series of charges along,

1091
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,796
creating vents in the
subaquatic lithosphere

1092
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:54,466
that would release the rock and magma,

1093
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,616
reducing the pressure

1094
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,646
and allowing the plates
to realign themselves.

1095
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,563
- And that would work?

1096
01:00:01,553 --> 01:00:03,173
- It's just a theory, but-

1097
01:00:03,197 --> 01:00:05,563
- And a rather poorly
thought out one, at that.

1098
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,266
- Look, I'm not saying it would be easy.

1099
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,046
Even with precision detonations,

1100
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:14,463
there would be aftershocks,
significant wave activity.

1101
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:18,346
The eruptions aren't just
going to stop overnight.

1102
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:20,863
The change would be gradual but steady.

1103
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:30,225
But given the depths

1104
01:00:30,249 --> 01:00:32,836
of the thermally active
regions I have in mind,

1105
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,096
I believe that the
aftereffects would be minimal,

1106
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,436
especially when you
consider the alternatives.

1107
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:39,766
- Wait a minute,

1108
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:40,697
Dr. Shepherd,

1109
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,890
are you seriously
proposing the global launch

1110
01:00:42,914 --> 01:00:47,286
of nuclear warheads to stop a
bunch of volcanic eruptions?

1111
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,316
- Which goes against everything
I've ever believed in.

1112
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,666
But when your back is against the wall,

1113
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,616
you have to fight fire with fire.

1114
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,626
- Mr. President, with all due respect,

1115
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,331
I strongly advise against-

1116
01:00:57,355 --> 01:00:58,646
- Look, Professor Plagiarism,
you had your chance.

1117
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:00,146
Now whether you want to admit it or not,

1118
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,696
we are running pretty damn
low on options and time.

1119
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,196
So if you have a better idea,

1120
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,920
I'm sure we'd all love to hear it.

1121
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,063
- Atlas has shrugged, gentlemen.

1122
01:01:19,669 --> 01:01:22,163
Now, what are we gonna do about it?

1123
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,516
- Sorry about that, I
just couldn't help myself.

1124
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:30,496
That guy is a first class tool.

1125
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,330
- No, that's,

1126
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,403
hey, I couldn't have
said it better myself.

1127
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,546
- You want me to leave?

1128
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:39,477
- Yes.

1129
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:42,038
- Oh god, Peter, and go where?

1130
01:01:42,062 --> 01:01:43,596
Look, if this is your way of convincing me

1131
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:44,936
to go back to New York-

1132
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,523
- Natalie, I just told you
everything I've been through.

1133
01:01:49,355 --> 01:01:52,156
I don't want to argue with you.

1134
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,826
That's not why I called.

1135
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:55,616
- Nothing is going to happen here.

1136
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,726
- You don't know that.

1137
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,587
- There hasn't been

1138
01:01:57,611 --> 01:01:59,976
a major eruption at Yellowstone in years.

1139
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,830
- That doesn't change the fact

1140
01:02:00,854 --> 01:02:02,276
that it's sitting right on top

1141
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,646
of the largest fault
line in North America,

1142
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:07,026
the same one that I've been
tracing volcanic activity

1143
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:08,413
over the last three days.

1144
01:02:13,337 --> 01:02:14,573
Oskar's dead, Nat.

1145
01:02:15,901 --> 01:02:18,238
So is one of my students.

1146
01:02:18,262 --> 01:02:19,072
- What?

1147
01:02:19,096 --> 01:02:21,120
- Oskar was at Mount
Fuji when it went off.

1148
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,436
Jacques was with me.

1149
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,753
- Oh my god, Peter.

1150
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,053
I'm so sorry.

1151
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,180
Are you okay?

1152
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,876
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1153
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,533
I'd just feel a lot better
if I knew that you were too.

1154
01:02:35,769 --> 01:02:39,243
- Peter, I don't know
what you expect me to do.

1155
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,936
I don't know what to say.

1156
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,163
- Listen, I'm sorry,

1157
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,210
about everything.

1158
01:02:50,047 --> 01:02:51,047
I was wrong.

1159
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,736
What happened between us was my fault,

1160
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:56,760
I know that.

1161
01:02:57,850 --> 01:02:58,827
- Peter.

1162
01:02:58,851 --> 01:03:02,026
- Look, I don't know

1163
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,273
how you feel about me at this point.

1164
01:03:03,297 --> 01:03:05,773
I don't know if we have another chance.

1165
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,473
I just need you to believe me
about this, if nothing else.

1166
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,923
- FEMA has so
far failed to comment on-

1167
01:03:18,947 --> 01:03:20,266
- Are you watching what's going on?

1168
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,506
They're showing footage of Hualalai.

1169
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,493
I almost don't recognize it anymore.

1170
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:27,606
- The governor has authorized

1171
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:30,166
the National Guard to
begin mass evacuations

1172
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:31,117
following the eruption

1173
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,823
of virtually all the
island chain's volcanoes.

1174
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,526
- It's gonna
get worse, isn't it?

1175
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:37,637
- Yeah, it is.

1176
01:03:41,327 --> 01:03:42,418
- Dr. Shepherd,

1177
01:03:42,442 --> 01:03:43,976
there's an urgent call for
you from a Stephen Daugherty.

1178
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,616
- Yeah, tell him I'll be right there,

1179
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,640
just one second.

1180
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,596
Natalie?

1181
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,430
- Yeah.

1182
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:50,653
- I'm sorry, I gotta run.

1183
01:03:50,677 --> 01:03:52,956
But I'll call you back
soon as I can, okay?

1184
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,940
- Peter.

1185
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:55,964
- Yeah?

1186
01:03:57,849 --> 01:03:59,620
- Just be careful.

1187
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:01,660
Please.

1188
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:03,870
- I will.

1189
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,706
Stephen?

1190
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,516
- Peter, how long would
it take you and your team

1191
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,243
to create your floor plan?

1192
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:13,461
With the resources we have at the moment,

1193
01:04:13,485 --> 01:04:15,416
at least a week.

1194
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,926
- Naval Intelligence is
expecting you within the hour.

1195
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,934
They've been told they're working for you

1196
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:21,576
and you're to have full
access to whatever you need.

1197
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,606
You have 24 hours.

1198
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:26,046
- So the president accepted the plan.

1199
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,336
- You're good to go, Peter.

1200
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,360
Good luck.

1201
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,479
- Okay, I'll be there.

1202
01:04:35,856 --> 01:04:37,439
So this is it, huh?

1203
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:39,977
Now, unfortunately

1204
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:41,516
we're not gonna be able to
go with satellites today

1205
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,656
because of the cloud cover

1206
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,546
so if we can get detailed maps

1207
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,796
of the Atlantic and Pacific
basins, that'd be great.

1208
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,820
- Okay.

1209
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,937
- That looks like the sea
project NOAA was working on.

1210
01:04:53,961 --> 01:04:55,209
- It is.

1211
01:04:55,233 --> 01:04:56,043
- Wasn't that scrapped in the late '80s

1212
01:04:56,067 --> 01:04:57,546
because of security concerns?

1213
01:04:57,570 --> 01:04:58,437
- It was, officially.

1214
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,413
So, officially, you've never seen it.

1215
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,489
- Yeah, right, understand,

1216
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:33,373
we should get initial data back

1217
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:34,209
in about the next 30 minutes.

1218
01:05:34,233 --> 01:05:35,297
- I hope they understand
the time constraints

1219
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:36,226
we're working under here.

1220
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,332
- Yeah, the certainly do.

1221
01:06:35,085 --> 01:06:38,002
- All right, here's what we've got.

1222
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:42,676
- Okay, submarine fleets
throughout the Pacific

1223
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,716
and Atlantic are being armed

1224
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,096
and moving into position as we speak.

1225
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,326
- Okay, well, we're closing in on it.

1226
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:48,556
I just want to make
sure all the coordinates

1227
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,616
are 100% accurate.

1228
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,106
- And that's why you're
going to be working

1229
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:53,106
hand in hand with the Navy
throughout this operation

1230
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:56,836
aboard two of its flagships,
the Hyperion and the Reprisal.

1231
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:58,390
- Wait a minute, you want us to actually-

1232
01:06:58,414 --> 01:06:59,806
- Transportation's already been arranged.

1233
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:01,580
I'll let you decide who goes where.

1234
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,176
- Alright, you're going
to be our go between.

1235
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,996
Kai and I will relay information
back to you and the techs

1236
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,606
to verify any potential hot spots.

1237
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:31,816
- Got it.

1238
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,676
- Listen, if something goes wrong-

1239
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,552
- Dr. Shepherd, no.

1240
01:07:36,576 --> 01:07:37,576
- Yes.

1241
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:41,493
I want you to give this to my wife.

1242
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,853
Tell her I'm sorry.

1243
01:07:46,872 --> 01:07:48,766
That I, I didn't have time,

1244
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:51,667
couldn't figure out how to,

1245
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:56,753
just tell her I'm sorry, okay?

1246
01:07:58,356 --> 01:08:00,097
- Okay.

1247
01:08:00,121 --> 01:08:01,121
- Thank you.

1248
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:13,226
Is this absolutely necessary?

1249
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,896
- It is if you
want to reach the Hyperion

1250
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,083
inside of this week.

1251
01:08:17,980 --> 01:08:19,253
- How long until we land?

1252
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:21,720
- We don't.

1253
01:08:27,053 --> 01:08:30,158
- You're sure this is a good idea?

1254
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,256
Captain Holloway, Dr. Peter Shepherd.

1255
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,237
- It's a pleasure.

1256
01:09:10,261 --> 01:09:11,426
You tell us where you want 'em,

1257
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:12,946
we'll do our best to hit the target.

1258
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:13,780
- Yes, sir.

1259
01:09:13,804 --> 01:09:15,546
- We've set you up over here.

1260
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:16,770
Show me what you've got.

1261
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:21,426
- Well, this is definitely
a work in progress,

1262
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:25,996
but we've detected serious
thermal and vent activity in here

1263
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:28,176
as well as along this ridge.

1264
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,936
So according to our calculations,

1265
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,736
the explosions should start taking place

1266
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,560
somewhere in this general area here.

1267
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:35,656
- That's gonna put us

1268
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,396
smack in the middle of
the Marianas Trench.

1269
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:39,520
- I realize that, sir.

1270
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,843
- I hope you know what
you're doing, Doctor.

1271
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:46,017
- That makes two of us.

1272
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:58,690
- Excuse me.

1273
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:02,230
Excuse me.

1274
01:10:06,674 --> 01:10:08,476
I'm sorry for the disturbance,

1275
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,120
but we have a situation developing

1276
01:10:10,144 --> 01:10:12,156
and we need you folks

1277
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:14,936
to proceed to the South
exit as soon as possible.

1278
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,799
- Can we get dressed first?

1279
01:10:16,823 --> 01:10:18,593
- Yeah, that would be a good idea.

1280
01:10:20,022 --> 01:10:20,832
- Babe, who was that?

1281
01:10:20,856 --> 01:10:21,993
Why you getting dressed?

1282
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,385
- Natalie, you there?

1283
01:10:24,409 --> 01:10:26,256
- Go ahead, Harv.

1284
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,090
- You want to explain to me

1285
01:10:27,114 --> 01:10:28,319
why I'm getting reports
from all over the place

1286
01:10:28,343 --> 01:10:31,166
that you're telling people back
to evacuate the camp ground?

1287
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,806
- Because I am.

1288
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:34,596
- Listen, I'm up here at Old Faithful

1289
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,046
with some guys from the university.

1290
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,346
They tell me we have
some ground declination,

1291
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,416
but I don't think that's
any reason to panic.

1292
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,816
- No, it's deformation, Harv,

1293
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,343
which means there's magma
moving beneath the earth

1294
01:10:43,367 --> 01:10:45,686
and we do have reason to panic.

1295
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:48,277
- Natalie, why
don't we just wait and see?

1296
01:10:48,301 --> 01:10:50,203
- Trust me on this one, Harv.

1297
01:10:51,082 --> 01:10:52,596
I'm headed over to Canyon campgrounds,

1298
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:54,286
I sent a couple of
families there yesterday.

1299
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:56,396
Get everyone is far away
from the geyser as possible,

1300
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,543
I'll be in touch.

1301
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,990
- Approaching a large
hydrothermal field now.

1302
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,193
160 by north 20.

1303
01:11:16,008 --> 01:11:17,186
- Any chimneys out there?

1304
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:18,210
- Take a look.

1305
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:24,386
Have your pick, black or white.

1306
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:27,193
- Iron saturation levels
must be off the charts.

1307
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,613
Definitely closing in on it.

1308
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:35,395
- Dr. Shepherd,

1309
01:11:35,419 --> 01:11:38,726
someone on the comm line for you.

1310
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:40,500
You can patch in right here, sir.

1311
01:11:40,524 --> 01:11:41,524
- Thank you.

1312
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,197
Hello?

1313
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:50,196
- Hey, doc, how're things
in the Pacific rim?

1314
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,456
- Cold and dark,

1315
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,033
but it looks like that's
starting to change.

1316
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:56,696
How are things on your end?

1317
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:57,956
- Like I'm playing sub commander

1318
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,713
in the world's biggest bathtub, man.

1319
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,186
You should've seen the
look on the captain's face

1320
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:14,746
when he realized he'd be entrusting

1321
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:17,906
the navigation of $6 billion
worth of Navy equipment

1322
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:19,296
to a joker.

1323
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:20,130
- Why don't we try

1324
01:12:20,154 --> 01:12:21,676
and keep that a secret
for a while, all right?

1325
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,356
And remember, we've got the Russians

1326
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,806
and the UK waiting in the wings.

1327
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:26,096
So as soon as you sync up with Bri

1328
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:27,216
and finalize your coordinates,

1329
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,276
I want you to forward 'em
all around, all right?

1330
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,300
- Aye, aye, sir.

1331
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,660
Always wanted to say that.

1332
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:47,946
- Okay, Kai, target coordinates
are good on one and two,

1333
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:50,043
waiting for confirmation on three.

1334
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,653
- Copy that, standing by.

1335
01:12:58,097 --> 01:12:59,886
- What's the minimum safe distance

1336
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:01,483
from these kinda detonations?

1337
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:04,456
- Two nautical miles.

1338
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,480
- Hope we make it.

1339
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:09,779
- This is either the smartest
plan in the history of mankind

1340
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:11,669
or the dumbest.

1341
01:13:11,693 --> 01:13:12,736
- If it's the latter

1342
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,337
we won't be around long
enough to regret it.

1343
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,439
- What the hell was that?

1344
01:13:33,463 --> 01:13:34,536
- Sir, we've got multiple thermal spikes

1345
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,052
popping up all over the trench.

1346
01:13:36,076 --> 01:13:37,440
- Looks like they want to
beat us to the punch, huh?

1347
01:13:37,464 --> 01:13:39,186
- Load specials in tube one and two,

1348
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,546
flood and standby.

1349
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:42,246
- Load specials in tube one and two,

1350
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:43,740
flood and standby, aye.

1351
01:13:52,287 --> 01:13:54,454
- Come on, Peter, pick up.

1352
01:14:10,211 --> 01:14:13,274
Oh my god.

1353
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,416
- Damage report.

1354
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,876
- We're gonna need a hell of an overhaul

1355
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,450
when we put into port, captain.

1356
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:53,348
I wouldn't advise that we stay
in the trench much longer.

1357
01:14:53,372 --> 01:14:55,986
- Noted, XO, maintain course and speed.

1358
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:57,660
- Maintain course and speed, aye.

1359
01:15:02,138 --> 01:15:05,971
- Open tubes one and
two, standby for launch.

1360
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:09,746
- Hyperion has her tube doors open.

1361
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:10,863
She's ready to fire.

1362
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,806
- Torpedo status, Mr.Cartwright?

1363
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:18,986
- Torpedoes armed and ready.

1364
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:20,316
Tubes one and two are flooded.

1365
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:21,267
Tube doors are open.

1366
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:22,933
Ready to fire your command, sir.

1367
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:25,363
- Fire torpedo one and two.

1368
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,253
- Torpedoes away.

1369
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:43,716
- What was that?

1370
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,506
- Torpedo two went off track, sir.

1371
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:48,426
- Number two torpedo has
impacted with the trench wall.

1372
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:49,916
- Now what?

1373
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:51,056
- Now we hope the first one

1374
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,906
penetrated deep enough to get the job done

1375
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:54,706
and the next ones don't miss.

1376
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,586
- Load specials, tubes three and four.

1377
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:58,143
- Torpedo one on track, sir.

1378
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:02,016
Time to target,

1379
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,650
T minus three, two, one.

1380
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:25,216
Signatures are weakening, sir.

1381
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:27,446
Sea water's already cooling off the magma,

1382
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:29,616
looks like our plan is actually working.

1383
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,990
- Let's not pat ourselves
on the back just yet.

1384
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,563
We've still got our two
biggest targets coming up.

1385
01:16:42,755 --> 01:16:46,156
- I just wanted to let you
know Operation Heal the Earth

1386
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,836
has officially commenced
here in the Atlantic.

1387
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:50,506
Hope they got a crap load of champagne

1388
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:52,603
ready on ice back in DC, the good stuff.

1389
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:56,790
- Torpedoes three and four are away.

1390
01:17:21,606 --> 01:17:24,511
- Kai, what happened?

1391
01:17:24,535 --> 01:17:25,535
Kai!

1392
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,423
- Transmitting SOS on high frequency.

1393
01:17:43,589 --> 01:17:47,339
This is the United States
Submarine Reprisal-

1394
01:18:02,826 --> 01:18:04,736
- Maintain port side
clearance, full right rudder!

1395
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,466
- Captain, I've lost all contact

1396
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:07,906
with my man on the Reprisal.

1397
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:09,396
- It's gonna have to wait.

1398
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:10,786
Fire tubes three and four.

1399
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:12,483
- Fire tubes three and four, aye.

1400
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:24,246
- My fellow Americans,
as you are well aware

1401
01:18:24,270 --> 01:18:26,266
for the past several weeks

1402
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:28,686
our planet has been besieged

1403
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:32,623
by a series of unusual volcanic eruptions.

1404
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:39,910
These geological events
have caused untold damage

1405
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:43,213
and loss of life all across the globe.

1406
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:47,666
The world's top scientists

1407
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:51,880
have concluded that the earth
will continue to release magma

1408
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:55,030
at an increased startling rate.

1409
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:07,956
However, there is hope,

1410
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:10,806
a possibility to bring an end

1411
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:14,457
to the devastation and
destruction of our planet.

1412
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,226
Earlier this morning,

1413
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:23,486
acting with the full cooperation
of the United Nations,

1414
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,396
I authorized a plan of action

1415
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:30,063
intended to counter the
effects of these eruptions.

1416
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:01,166
At this very moment

1417
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:05,646
several American submarines in
the Atlantic and the Pacific

1418
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:07,976
are working in conjunction

1419
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,396
with submarine fleets from other nations,

1420
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:14,816
22 countries, coordinating efforts

1421
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:19,276
to launch 44 nuclear tipped torpedoes

1422
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:23,013
at various targets beneath
the world's oceans.

1423
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:32,716
If we are successful in our joint mission,

1424
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:37,053
and I have every
confidence that we will be,

1425
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:43,270
our way of life will be
preserved for future generations.

1426
01:20:51,247 --> 01:20:54,196
However, planet Earth, as we know it,

1427
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:56,163
will be forever changed.

1428
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:02,216
I ask you, regardless of your faith,

1429
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,150
to join me in a prayer

1430
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:09,626
for our families, for our friends,

1431
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:11,536
for our heroes,

1432
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,223
and most of all for our future.

1433
01:21:51,397 --> 01:21:52,730
Will we survive?

1434
01:21:54,263 --> 01:21:57,893
I believe we are destined to do so.

1435
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:00,647
May God bless us all.

1436
01:23:49,128 --> 01:23:50,588
- Hey, I didn't hear you come in.

1437
01:23:50,612 --> 01:23:51,945
- Just got back.

1438
01:23:54,193 --> 01:23:55,595
- You okay?

1439
01:23:55,619 --> 01:23:56,619
- Yeah,

1440
01:23:57,494 --> 01:23:58,885
I'm really glad you're here.

1441
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:00,439
- Me too.

1442
01:24:00,463 --> 01:24:02,793
- Are you having second
thoughts about USGS?

1443
01:24:04,608 --> 01:24:06,786
- I don't want Kincaid's job.

1444
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:08,723
I'm a teacher, not an administrator.

1445
01:24:12,543 --> 01:24:14,723
I only want to be with you.

1446
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:30,146
As scientists we study
recent volcanic activity

1447
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,996
in the hopes of better understanding

1448
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:34,726
the way our world functions

1449
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,476
and to prevent the loss of life

1450
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:39,303
by eventually being able
to predict these eruptions.

1451
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,566
Shared knowledge among
the nations of the world

1452
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:45,863
will prevent future loss of life.

1453
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:50,116
Today, we are capable of
learning more about Earth

1454
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:51,313
than ever before,

1455
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:54,696
but without our humanity,

1456
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,293
our scientific progress helps no one.

1457
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:02,503
The next time nature rebels,
will mankind be ready?

1458
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:06,073
Have we learned from our past,

1459
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:08,677
in order to protect our future?

1460
