1
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,069
I wouldn't be caught
dead in this ugly hat.

2
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,859
One day, you will only
remember me by this hat.

3
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,720
You will put it on

4
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,243
and never take it off again.

5
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,629
By the time you read this letter,

6
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,652
I will already be back in Mexico.

7
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,845
I'll be home imagining your laughter,

8
00:01:42,846 --> 00:01:45,493
your friendship and your lips.

9
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,973
And you'll be in our same
spot, but without me.

10
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,073
No one in the world will
ever compare to you.

11
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,423
Susan, come be with me in Mexico.

12
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,929
Let me share my life with you like

13
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,603
you shared your with me

14
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,509
and we'll grow all
together with lots of kids

15
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,113
and, please, come find me.

16
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,499
But if you wait too long,
things could change.

17
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,340
My humble village with no
ferries, no tourists could change

18
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,529
and this broken heart could be mended

19
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,449
by someone else, so please,
don't wait too long.

20
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,869
Come find me.

21
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,719
So how did you hear about the island?

22
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,593
I'm visiting someone who lives here.

23
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,899
I hope he still lives here.

24
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,479
Sounds like love.

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,505
Not really.

26
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:13,006
♪ I saw you in the sunlight ♪

27
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:17,897
♪ You were wearing blue ♪

28
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,844
♪ I'm so in love ♪

29
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:26,845
♪ In love with you ♪

30
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:35,912
♪ Your eyes shine like the moonlight ♪

31
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,033
♪ Your lips are fully red ♪

32
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:44,806
♪ I'm so in love ♪

33
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,724
♪ In love with you ♪

34
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:06,299
You speak English?

35
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,389
Yes.

36
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,509
She said you should
never marry anyone local.

37
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,959
It's the worst you can do.

38
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,969
Look at that, that's how
you gonna get, you see.

39
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,415
Unless you like that.

40
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,420
What are you doing over here?

41
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:20,449
I'm looking for a friend.

42
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,283
What's his name?

43
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,283
- Luis.
- Luis what?

44
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:25,665
Javier Avila Gonzales.

45
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,799
Luis Avila Gonzales.

46
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,604
Look, you know what?

47
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:31,607
You need to sit down

48
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:32,609
and I'll tell you the story of Luis.

49
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,169
Sit, have a seat.

50
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,158
Have a seat and perhaps have some tequila

51
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,548
or a beer or something.

52
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:38,809
He has

53
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,479
a very, very jealous wife.

54
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,908
So I don't know why
you're looking for him,

55
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,779
but be careful what you do, okay?

56
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,862
I should be going, gracias, thank you.

57
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:47,939
No, no, no, no, did
I say something wrong?

58
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,699
Have some ceviche, it's wonderful.

59
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,643
Try it, try it.

60
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,679
There you go, you like that.

61
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,019
I'm losing interest. Who is she?

62
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,649
In order for someone to
take your script seriously,

63
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,749
it has to be great.

64
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,313
This is not a great movie.

65
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,701
You only read up to page five.

66
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,949
The first five pages
make or break a script.

67
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,029
You don't even have basic
three-act structure.

68
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:15,977
Here's a great book.

69
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:17,847
"Nothing But a Structure."

70
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,579
Show us who she is.

71
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,839
We need to be able to relate to her.

72
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,859
Give her a job.

73
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,715
It doesn't matter what job she has.

74
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:28,384
She could be a coffee maker, a barista.

75
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:30,429
Then make her a barista.

76
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,269
I'm a barista.

77
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,883
It's my job.

78
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,307
Okay.

79
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,158
An occupation is a vehicle

80
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,189
to reveal more about her.

81
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,414
Helps us to relate to her.

82
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:43,222
Give her a couple of lines mentioning

83
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:45,999
where she studied and
what her specialty is.

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,289
I studied in Italy.

85
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,179
I can design the form of a latte

86
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,989
to look identical to a face.

87
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,071
She's a barista.

88
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,029
I gave Susan a job so
she'd be more likable.

89
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,040
Oh, but Susan doesn't need a job, right?

90
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,139
I mean, that was your point

91
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,009
that she's a blank canvas
to reflect your audience.

92
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,763
I also caved this week.

93
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,729
I did it again.

94
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,019
I mailed a script off to a contest.

95
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,339
Oh, no, not a contest.

96
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,729
You only fail when you stop trying.

97
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,079
I got the feedback this morning.

98
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,239
There's no solid concept.

99
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,079
Characters are under developed.

100
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,913
Bullshit.

101
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,689
Now we are artists, aren't we?

102
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,999
Be an artist.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,109
Do not sell out.

104
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,339
It is only in the future

105
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,882
that one can write history.

106
00:07:43,883 --> 00:07:45,192
What does that mean?

107
00:07:45,193 --> 00:07:48,069
That means that many
geniuses aren't recognized

108
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,940
until they're dead.

109
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:51,307
Oh like that Harry Potter lady.

110
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:53,459
She's still alive.

111
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,507
I can't wait until I die.

112
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,509
Well, why not?

113
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,179
I have no money, no house, no family.

114
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,434
All I had is an idea

115
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:02,529
that my stories will somehow get made.

116
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,979
The goal is not to live forever,

117
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,063
it's to create something that will.

118
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:10,015
Emotional glasses.

119
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:11,790
Tours, -
Gracias.

120
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,198
Emotional glasses.

121
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,684
Tours, , emotional glasses.

122
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:20,379
Tours, tours, for sale, tours, tours.

123
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,049
This is special, special
glasses for your dreams.

124
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,113
It's free, take it.

125
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,569
What do you see, what do
you watch in your glasses?

126
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,929
Your dreams.

127
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,089
It's for you.

128
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,259
I give you.

129
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,158
Because you are, you are your emotions.

130
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,185
I love the emotional glasses

131
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,928
that let you see your dreams.

132
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:42,949
And you know the guy who sells them,

133
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,277
he's like a vendor philosopher.

134
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,359
For sure, they should hook up.

135
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,379
It's not a hook-up movie.

136
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,769
It's about a woman who's in search

137
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,629
of intimacy in a world that's distant.

138
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,139
Look, why is her world distant?

139
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,479
Because your world is distant.

140
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,499
Trust me.

141
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,289
Let's get you a hook-up tonight

142
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,739
and then tomorrow
morning write your script

143
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,239
and everything's gonna be fixed,

144
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,550
it's gonna be perfect, no more changes.

145
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:07,379
I promise you.

146
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,999
Sorry, is this, um, is this seat taken?

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,250
What seat?

148
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,217
I guess it's taken.

149
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:18,409
I'll be right over here if you need me.

150
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,163
I got cashews and a candle.

151
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:24,513
This is, you're good guys.

152
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,193
He's got cashews and a candle.

153
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,876
You should hook-up with him.

154
00:09:28,877 --> 00:09:30,229
No.

155
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,163
I have a hook-up for you, Jimmy.

156
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,219
I heard he got a divorce.

157
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,499
Maybe you should call him.

158
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,333
Why?

159
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,619
Because he's the only
man you've ever loved

160
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,183
and because you need intimacy.

161
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:46,123
I haven't spoken to Jimmy in 10 years.

162
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,647
Look, go to his house.

163
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,511
Knock on his door.

164
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,255
Remember me?

165
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:26,704
♪ I saw you in the moonlight ♪

166
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:30,287
♪ You were wearing blue ♪

167
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,453
Susan Dorothy Cayden Wilson.

168
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Luis Javier Avila
Gonzales Gonzales Gonzales.

169
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,553
I brought something that you gave to me.

170
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,713
Three girls and a boy.

171
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,433
What about you, any kids?

172
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,210
No kids.

173
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,990
Husband?

174
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,070
No.

175
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,191
Papi.

176
00:11:34,964 --> 00:11:36,131
I should go.

177
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,340
How long are you planning to stay?

178
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,489
I don't know.

179
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,290
You're wearing the hat.

180
00:12:43,617 --> 00:12:45,979
Why is she so
upset that he's married?

181
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,780
Didn't she expect that?

182
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,557
Well, it's not just his marriage.

183
00:12:51,558 --> 00:12:53,529
It's her life.

184
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,989
Her coffee shop failed

185
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,083
and she has no family, no friends.

186
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:59,569
And we know this how?

187
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,015
It's revealed in layers.

188
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:02,018
You need a big actor.

189
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,490
Bryan Alonsio just came off

190
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,969
of Attackinator 8.

191
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,970
He's hot right now.

192
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:07,245
I mean, he was just named sexiest human

193
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,485
on the planet by "Hottie" magazine.

194
00:13:09,486 --> 00:13:12,329
It's a black woman in Mexico.

195
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,029
There's no part for a white man.

196
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,539
You're creative, create a part.

197
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,067
We won't consider it without a star.

198
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,793
Could I have a spot of tea, please.

199
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,373
Curtis.

200
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,456
Susan.

201
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,099
And what is it you do, Susan?

202
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,389
I was a barista.

203
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,739
Was?

204
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,339
Until I lost my shop leaving me

205
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,426
with nothing but nothing.

206
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:57,969
Well, perhaps you'll meet

207
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,863
an impossibly sexy British banker

208
00:13:59,864 --> 00:14:01,463
who will change your life.

209
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,720
Sounds like the perfect
Hollywood love story.

210
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,619
Hey, Jack, what's smokin'?

211
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,079
Me, dude.

212
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,379
So how was the surf?

213
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,200
Ah, tranquilo, man, tranquilo.

214
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,883
The ocean is my god and
the waves are my religion.

215
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:48,258
♪ Believe in' the waves ♪

216
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:52,098
♪ Love the waves ♪

217
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:57,099
♪ TV waves, sound waves ♪

218
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:01,741
♪ Catch a wave ♪

219
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:04,492
♪ Ride the waves ♪

220
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:22,439
Can't get to the phone,

221
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
leave me a message.

222
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Jimmy.

223
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,299
I didn't know if this was your number,

224
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,853
but it is definitely your voice.

225
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,059
I was just thinking it
would be really cool

226
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,533
to call and hear what you've been up to,

227
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,673
but you're probably
married with kids and all.

228
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:49,899
Anyway, I think of you often

229
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,900
and I was just wondering
if you think of me ever.

230
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
Okay, bye.

231
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,673
You know, I thought about you for years.

232
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,990
I still do.

233
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,777
What was the thing you wanted to give me?

234
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:14,324
Nothing.

235
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,053
You haven't changed.

236
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:23,183
I have changed.

237
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,763
I don't think so.

238
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,622
Revisiting a
past love is played out.

239
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,203
The problem is your premise.

240
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:35,029
The problem is my premise?

241
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,399
The premise is great,

242
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,659
but there's too much exposition.

243
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,972
You have to show us more.

244
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:41,806
Show you more?

245
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:44,459
Show us less and more plot twists.

246
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,293
Plot twists.

247
00:16:45,294 --> 00:16:47,009
Too many plot twists.

248
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,930
Make is simpler.

249
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:49,849
If she's so depressed,

250
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,099
we need someone happy, like a best friend.

251
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,039
But she's lonely and has no friends.

252
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,149
Give her a friend.

253
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,983
A friend?

254
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:57,149
- Friend?
- Friend.

255
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,159
She needs a friend.

256
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Friend.

257
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:02,659
I'm so glad you you brought me here,

258
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,759
like I really didn't think

259
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,833
you were gonna even ask me at first

260
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,259
'cause I thought it was something

261
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,729
you kind of wanted to do on your own,

262
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,791
but what I'm gonna do is cheer you up

263
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,429
and I'm gonna add excitement.

264
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,679
You're gonna see.

265
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,512
Thank you.

266
00:17:12,513 --> 00:17:14,541
Salud.

267
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,042
Estamos in Mexico.

268
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,409
You know the only bad thing
about this I would say

269
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,259
is just how fast the time goes.

270
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,328
I don't even know when we got here,

271
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,380
but it feels like we just got here today.

272
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,169
Hola.

273
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,265
Hola Senorita.

274
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,266
Come estas?

275
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:34,270
Muy bien, Senorita.

276
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:35,104
Soy, Jenny.

277
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,249
Jenny, mucho gusto, Christian.

278
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,250
Hola.

279
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:49,931
Muchas gracias.

280
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:52,521
Okay, senorita, tequila?

281
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,859
You really gotta get
over this tragic love story.

282
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,329
I don't have a tragic love story.

283
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,029
It's over, it's done.

284
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,030
Maybe you'll meet somebody else, look.

285
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:09,975
- No thanks.
- No.

286
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:11,143
No, gracias.

287
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:14,883
What was that?

288
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:16,507
I'm gonna see what this is.

289
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:17,484
You're gonna see what it is?

290
00:18:17,485 --> 00:18:19,168
I'm gonna go.

291
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:20,541
Souvenirs, souvenirs.

292
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,601
That's some beautiful shit.

293
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,819
I bought a jar of shit.

294
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,653
You did.

295
00:18:57,653 --> 00:18:58,486
I did.

296
00:18:58,487 --> 00:18:59,629
Life is shit.

297
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,082
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

298
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:48,009
The friend needs a purpose,

299
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,399
that's what the analyst said.

300
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,009
I added a friend like everyone said

301
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,609
and now she needs a purpose.

302
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,839
Now I've got to create a story

303
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,253
so that the audience can be interested.

304
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,209
She's not even part

305
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,089
of the movie you wanted to write.

306
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,279
Don't add her.

307
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,210
Take her out.

308
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:04,439
Mom, I have to.

309
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,499
I have to change it or no one will buy it.

310
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,233
I need to sell something.

311
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,779
Okay, but
give her purpose meaning,

312
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,239
something we all want to root for.

313
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,799
Her purpose
was to have no purpose.

314
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,113
I have no purpose.

315
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,513
I came with you for moral support,

316
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:21,985
but now you're just depressed

317
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:24,599
and I'm just hanging around.

318
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,903
A life without conflicts
is a life not being lived.

319
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,434
I want more.

320
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:34,049
It's driving me crazy.

321
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,977
Well, there you have it.

322
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:36,329
There I have it?

323
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,013
Not having a conflict is
a huge conflict for you.

324
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,063
I'm gonna wander.

325
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,203
Enjoy your depression.

326
00:22:38,094 --> 00:22:40,824
Are you done wandering?

327
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:43,134
Find what you're looking for?

328
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:47,793
It's you I was looking
for and I found you.

329
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,827
I felt I would never see you again.

330
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:58,806
Really?

331
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:00,053
Actually, no.

332
00:23:00,907 --> 00:23:03,445
I always knew I would see you again.

333
00:23:03,446 --> 00:23:07,583
That's why I waited so
long to get married.

334
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,950
How long did you wait?

335
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:15,232
What?

336
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:17,013
- A long time.
- A long time?

337
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:18,014
Yeah.

338
00:23:25,078 --> 00:23:28,319
Take you to some nice place in the island,

339
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,043
but my wife is kind of jealous.

340
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,266
Does she know you used to be mine?

341
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:36,463
Did you mention that?

342
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:44,984
You look beautiful.

343
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:50,903
Are you happy?

344
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,959
How is your love life?

345
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,860
How's work?

346
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:56,539
How is the coffee business?

347
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,603
How's your family?

348
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:02,260
How's your family, hmm?

349
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:06,521
They good?

350
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,979
Have you noticed there's a lot of men

351
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,399
in your script?

352
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,393
Everyone Jenny meets is a man.

353
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:59,679
Not being able to relate to women

354
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,849
is a sure sign of not having had

355
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,869
a great male role model in your childhood.

356
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,587
And the infidelity, clearly there's a lot

357
00:26:09,588 --> 00:26:12,389
of dysfunction in your script.

358
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,269
And what is this infatuation with

359
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,353
a country full of Mexicans?

360
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,869
If you're going to fix

361
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,379
your inability to meet men,

362
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,639
you have to fix Jenny's
inability to meet women.

363
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,473
Why?

364
00:26:28,474 --> 00:26:31,349
Just have her meet a woman.

365
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,789
Try it.

366
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,493
Just as an exercise.

367
00:27:43,158 --> 00:27:44,429
You know it's interesting

368
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,479
that at this point in the script,

369
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,289
that the tone changes to a documentary all

370
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,339
of a sudden.

371
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,679
Is that bad?

372
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,739
Well, you can't mix genres like that.

373
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,309
Life is a mix of genres.

374
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,099
Why can't I reflect that in my movie?

375
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,100
Life is not a mix of
genres, your dysfunction is.

376
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,762
And all the
storylines, who do we root for?

377
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,832
I don't know.

378
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,759
I just wanna tell the story of Susan,

379
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,909
but then Jenny came along

380
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,743
and now we have to care about her.

381
00:28:48,744 --> 00:28:51,363
Could be a sign of pre-schizophrenia.

382
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,689
Look, there are just some
lines a film cannot cross.

383
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,523
Says who?

384
00:28:57,524 --> 00:28:59,019
Says the rules of the art.

385
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,337
True art should have no rules.

386
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:10,949
I'm sorry, I don't speak Spanish.

387
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:11,950
Want a drink?

388
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,299
No, this is my last drink.

389
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,380
Only one, please.

390
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,383
Okay.

391
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:20,383
Perfect.

392
00:29:28,086 --> 00:29:31,285
All righty, here's a drink for you.

393
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:32,606
Only one.
No.

394
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,439
Only one.

395
00:29:37,705 --> 00:29:38,705
Cheers.

396
00:29:41,594 --> 00:29:43,011
Cheers.

397
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:48,209
Definitely need to take out

398
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,665
the scene at the bar with
all the drunk Mexicans.

399
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,668
Yeah?

400
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:54,103
Yeah, it's creepy.

401
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:58,689
Maybe you could throw
in some kids or animals.

402
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,949
Kids and animals?

403
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,693
Your audience needs to
feel comfort, not nightmares.

404
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,699
It's like a den of "Narcos."

405
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,269
I worry I'm gonna be murdered

406
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,563
in my sleep or something.

407
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,079
You're making your audience uncomfortable.

408
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,613
And you wanna feel comfortable?

409
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,853
Hey, there you are.

410
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:24,433
Luis.

411
00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:31,722
Luis.

412
00:32:33,548 --> 00:32:34,548
Luis.

413
00:32:37,493 --> 00:32:38,571
Luis.

414
00:32:38,572 --> 00:32:41,302
No, please, don't let me stop you.

415
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:43,009
You're mad?

416
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,010
You're mad?

417
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,323
You have a wife.

418
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,709
You're right, I have a wife

419
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,052
and I'm going home to her.

420
00:33:01,922 --> 00:33:05,363
No, it's okay, you have a good time.

421
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:06,364

No.

429
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:29,396
I don't.

430
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,859
Look, look, we're both adults, okay.

431
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,039
I don't know what that was all about

432
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,069
with the guy on the motorcycle,

433
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,893
but if I see you tomorrow,

434
00:33:38,828 --> 00:33:41,543
I'll just pretend like
I don't even know you.

435
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,230

I'm researching methods

444
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:37,569
of garbage removal and waste management.

445
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,769
Why?

446
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,760
It's tourism.

447
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,899
It is destroying this island.

448
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,039
And, what, you're gonna save them?

449
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,049
I'm not gonna save them,

450
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,989
but I'm gonna help them.

451
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:49,149
Look, I know you wanna have a problem,

452
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,213
but this is not it. Okay?

453
00:34:52,712 --> 00:34:55,119
It's kind of self-centered
to be so focused

454
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,199
on having something to
struggle about all the time.

455
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,578
- Self-centered?
- Yeah, it is.

456
00:34:58,579 --> 00:34:59,412
I'm self-centered?

457
00:34:59,412 --> 00:35:00,380
Yeah, you need to hear that.

458
00:35:00,381 --> 00:35:02,129
You are, it's very self-centered.

459
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:04,459
Until I became inspired,

460
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,849
this entire trip has revolved

461
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,989
around you and your problems.

462
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,099
You were looking for Luis.

463
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,070
You can't find Luis.

464
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,030
Luis has a family.

465
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:12,141
You lost your coffee shop.

466
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:13,809
You know what, it's getting old.

467
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,229
No, you're getting old.

468
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,809
I didn't even ask you to come here

469
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,019
in the first place.

470
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,020
How about that?

471
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,850
What are you talking about?

472
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:21,969
What are YOU talking about?

473
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,429
I wanted to be alone.

474
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,869
I came because you needed a friend,

475
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,909
I came as your friend.

476
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,362
Yeah, but I didn't ask you to.

477
00:35:27,363 --> 00:35:30,089
Oh, so then why did you invite me.

478
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:30,980
I didn't.

479
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:33,009
So I invited myself?

480
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,603
Apparently, yes.

481
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm sorry.

482
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,329
I came because I thought
you needed a friend,

483
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,479
but if you don't want me along

484
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,999
then I will leave happily, happily.

485
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,429
But just remember,

486
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,194
when your same old
single-minded story gets old,

487
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:54,613
just remember that you
never wanted me along.

488
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,100
Jenny, I'm sorry.

489
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:01,189
Look, don't do this, don't do this.

490
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,023
I am sorry.

491
00:36:02,024 --> 00:36:03,479
Jenny, stop.
Come on.

492
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,664
Jenny, stop, I am sorry, okay.

493
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:09,573
I am a terrible, horrible drunk, okay.

494
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,989
Last night I had a nightmare.

495
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,909
I was a painter in
front of a blank canvas.

496
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,322
Hold on, canvasses are expensive.

497
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:31,072
Investors wanna be sure.

498
00:36:31,073 --> 00:36:34,203
What will we see, how will we feel?

499
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,599
I will first paint a blue line.

500
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,709
It should be a circle.

501
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,309
I will cover it in green and red.

502
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,674
Blue and orange.

503
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:43,629
Using circular brush strokes.

504
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,949
People want squares, not circles.

505
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,109
This can't be real.

506
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,458
What is real?

507
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:50,080
Is the world in which you live in real?

508
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:53,079
A world where you relinquish all control

509
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,579
to people you don't even know.

510
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,901
A reality revolving around

511
00:36:56,902 --> 00:37:01,093
a single non-tangible word.

512
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,265
A word created by a humanity

513
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:07,063
that cannot define it's own existence.

514
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,340
Come on, Zoe, you know the word.

515
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,410
You hate the word, yet
your entire reality hinges

516
00:37:15,411 --> 00:37:17,429
on this word.

517
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,730
Money?

518
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,859
Bingo.

519
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,399
And why do you think that is real?

520
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,859
Because it's what I know.

521
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,229
And now that you know,

522
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,894
it is up to you to define the rules

523
00:37:29,895 --> 00:37:32,719
of your own reality.

524
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,578
That's a beautiful dream Zoe.

525
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:36,602
What does it mean?

526
00:37:36,603 --> 00:37:39,194
If you don't create your reality,

527
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:41,679
your reality will create you.

528
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,309
Yes, the fear of not being... bad,

529
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,609
fear of being bad is... not exceptional.

530
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,443
I think it means

531
00:37:49,444 --> 00:37:50,856
that you need to write your story,

532
00:37:50,857 --> 00:37:53,572
but you know like your story.

533
00:37:53,573 --> 00:37:57,281
But don't let the suits
be in charge of your fate.

534
00:37:57,282 --> 00:37:58,280
Be a real artist.

535
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:01,839
But what if everyone's
right and it's not good?

536
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,240
Bad art is the road to greatness.

537
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,033
You have
made some nice changes.

538
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,359
I still don't like
that documentary part.

539
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,019
I like making the drunk guy American.

540
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,149
It's more comfortable.

541
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,609
The part still won't
attract Bryan Alonsio.

542
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,289
It's definitely not big enough.

543
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,639
But all the men are Mexican.

544
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,479
Then have him play a Mexican.

545
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,177
He will definitely be interested

546
00:38:30,178 --> 00:38:32,289
in the acting challenge.

547
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,276
That is an excellent idea.

548
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:36,299
Does he even speak Spanish?

549
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,399
Nobody wants to read subtitles.

550
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,759
If he has an accent,

551
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,379
it's understood he's speaking Spanish.

552
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,380
Brilliant.

553
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,333
I'm gonna take you to the place

554
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:04,599
in the jungle where I was born.

555
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,179
A very small fishing village.

556
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,452
That's where I was born. I grew up there.

557
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:09,783
Were there snakes and spiders.

558
00:39:11,366 --> 00:39:14,119
Of course, why you think I'm so hard?

559
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,619
You see all these beaches here?

560
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,453
You know Choke?

561
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:17,286
The beverage company?

562
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:18,119
Yes.

563
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,559
They bought everything you see here.

564
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,040
All of the beaches. Todas las playas.

565
00:39:23,131 --> 00:39:24,581
Is your friend gonna be okay?

566
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Hey, Susan, hey, are you okay?

567
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,049
Here, here, you, you'll
feel better in 20 minutes.

568
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,452
You drink this.

569
00:39:38,453 --> 00:39:39,529
He's says you'll feel better

570
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,489
in 20 minutes, drink this.

571
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,480
It's an old family recipe.

572
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:45,259
It's been in my family for generations.

573
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,949
It's an old family recipe.

574
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,869
It's been in his family for generations.

575
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:49,810
My grandmother believed

576
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:51,396
that she could live forever

577
00:39:51,397 --> 00:39:52,629
and you know what?

578
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,956
She's still alive.

579
00:39:53,957 --> 00:39:56,439
It's weird, I can
understand what he was saying.

580
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,559
He has this weird accent

581
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,389
that's very easy to understand for sure.

582
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,560
I no speak English.

583
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,773
He doesn't speak English.

584
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:18,921
Welcome to my island.

585
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:22,699
Yes, it's muy bonito. No?

586
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,141
Muy bonito!

587
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:27,839
There's cocos everywhere.

588
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,980
Come..

589
00:40:33,928 --> 00:40:36,043
Now I am going to take you

590
00:40:36,044 --> 00:40:37,377
to see La llorona.

591
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:43,938
Now, La llorona, is very special.

592
00:40:43,939 --> 00:40:45,869
He says, he's says he's taking us

593
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,077
to see La llorona who's very special.

594
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,995
Yes, yes, she can read your mind.

595
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:57,890
Watch out, the net, step, yes, yes.

596
00:41:00,696 --> 00:41:01,696
Okay.

597
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:11,509
And now La llorona.

598
00:41:13,725 --> 00:41:15,856
We call her La llorona.

599
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:19,441
Porque she feels others' pain.

600
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,852
She says you're
suffering for a boyfriend.

601
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,397
What is she saying, what is she saying?

602
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:41,529
She says there's something

603
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,530
that you have to do.

604
00:41:42,531 --> 00:41:45,495
You know you have to do it, so do it.

605
00:41:49,951 --> 00:41:52,476
If La llorona say you do it, you do it.

606
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,335
Do you know what she's talking about?

607
00:41:55,831 --> 00:41:56,831
Yeah.

608
00:41:57,751 --> 00:41:58,584
Yeah?

609
00:41:58,585 --> 00:42:00,066
I do.

610
00:42:02,306 --> 00:42:05,523
Do it, you know
what she's talking about.

611
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:13,473
All of this is just gonna
stay really clear, I swear.

612
00:42:14,396 --> 00:42:16,619
The people here are nice people.

613
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,509
They don't realize that humans suck.

614
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:22,738
Money comes into it and they
sell their land, their things.

615
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:24,843
And suddenly everybody cares.

616
00:42:24,844 --> 00:42:26,578
You know what I mean?

617
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,088
Luis.

618
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,734
Come on, what are you doing?

619
00:42:31,735 --> 00:42:33,932
He's with his family, let's go.

620
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:36,579
Let's like think about what we can do

621
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,989
to help what we saw today.

622
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,910
I think I should do it now.

623
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:40,161
I'll catch up with you.

624
00:42:40,162 --> 00:42:41,026
All right.

625
00:42:41,027 --> 00:42:42,028
Okay.

626
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:43,050
Take care of yourself.

627
00:42:43,051 --> 00:42:44,793
I'll be okay.

628
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:09,603
So that's your wife?

629
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,123
I chose family.

630
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,283
You chose work.

631
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,659
Can we talk later?

632
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,899
Can you find me?

633
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,073
Tonight? I don't think so.

634
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,223
Just for like five minutes.

635
00:43:31,597 --> 00:43:33,452
By your house on the
corner, I'll meet you there

636
00:43:33,453 --> 00:43:35,823
at midnight, please?

637
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,389
Tomorrow.

638
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,853
Yeah? Midnight.

639
00:43:50,946 --> 00:43:54,806
♪ I saw you in the moonlight ♪

640
00:43:54,807 --> 00:43:58,199
♪ You were wearing blue ♪

641
00:44:18,868 --> 00:44:19,989
Habla Ingles?

642
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,913
Oh, yes, I speak English.

643
00:44:21,914 --> 00:44:25,440
I would love to have a cappuccino.

644
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,235
A cappuccino, yes.

645
00:44:29,236 --> 00:44:30,236
Thank you.

646
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,909
It's a beautiful scene,

647
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,963
but it doesn't propel the story forward.

648
00:44:38,964 --> 00:44:40,772
It's the calm before the storm,

649
00:44:40,773 --> 00:44:43,829
before she meets Luis at midnight.

650
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,269
What about a metaphor?

651
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,699
All good scripts have a metaphor?

652
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,550
Like what?

653
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:50,049
The woman at the cafe.

654
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,560
Maybe she senses Susan's pain

655
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:53,523
and while it seems that Susan is sad

656
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,527
about her failing coffee business.

657
00:44:55,528 --> 00:44:57,129
I was a barista once.

658
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,439
But then I lost everything

659
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,049
and I haven't made a coffee since,

660
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:01,329
not even an instant.

661
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,263
It's really a metaphor for Luis.

662
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:08,750
You know what? Come
with me, come with me.

663
00:45:15,635 --> 00:45:16,478
Come in.

664
00:45:16,479 --> 00:45:19,359
This is for you and you're going

665
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,413
to make your own beautiful cappuccino.

666
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,653
You know if you really love something,

667
00:45:25,654 --> 00:45:27,899
if something really touches you deeply,

668
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,369
you should never let go of it.

669
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,244
Don't run away from it.

670
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:33,109
What if you can't have it anymore,

671
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,696
then you kind of have to let it go?

672
00:45:35,697 --> 00:45:37,762
Even if you don't have
your own coffee shop,

673
00:45:37,763 --> 00:45:39,788
you can still make your
coffee once in a while

674
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:41,078
and enjoy it.

675
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:51,479
The metaphor is a contrived,
played out convention

676
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,903
that has no place in any good movie.

677
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,447
I paid $250 for someone to tell me

678
00:45:58,448 --> 00:46:00,299
that they hate my movie.

679
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,469
And you care about what
this stranger thinks why?

680
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,859
Come on, let's eat lunch.

681
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,439
What did you bring me?

682
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,764
Always healthy stuff, girl,

683
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,529
always healthy stuff.

684
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,919
All right, so they're
gonna meet tonight.

685
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,539
They're gonna have their reunion.

686
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,979
And then what happens?

687
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,447
Do they hook up?

688
00:46:17,448 --> 00:46:19,079
I think they should.

689
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,080
No.

690
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,826
She wants intimacy.

691
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:24,380
Intimacy.

692
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:25,871
And that's not sex?

693
00:46:25,872 --> 00:46:27,679
No, no, she's not looking

694
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,839
to break up a marriage,

695
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,059
she's not after sex.

696
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,766
She's just looking for a closeness

697
00:46:31,767 --> 00:46:33,499
with someone who could genuinely care.

698
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,796
That's holding and talking.

699
00:46:36,797 --> 00:46:39,592
Oh, there's Alex B. White.

700
00:46:39,593 --> 00:46:42,036
Yeah, our firm is doing PR for him.

701
00:46:42,037 --> 00:46:42,870
Really?

702
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:45,639
You know, "Man, Woman,
Love," his new movie.

703
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,223
That movie is terrible.

704
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:48,809
Yeah, it's the highest grossing movie

705
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:49,839
in the year.

706
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,909
Hi, Jennifer, right?

707
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,743
Yes.

708
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:53,629
Hello, sorry do you need something?

709
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,748
Who's your friend?

710
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:56,259
- This is Zoe.
- Hi.

711
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,250
Hi, Zoe.

712
00:46:57,251 --> 00:46:59,596
Congratulations on
your "Man, Woman, Love."

713
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:01,896
- Oh, thank you so much.
- It's doing great, yeah.

714
00:47:01,897 --> 00:47:02,904
But you know Hollywood,

715
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:03,976
it's all about what's next.

716
00:47:03,977 --> 00:47:05,109
What is next?

717
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:06,129
You know my stuff.

718
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:08,789
I'm a sucker for
romance, but with twist.

719
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,199
Zoe has exactly that script.

720
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,033
You do?

721
00:47:12,033 --> 00:47:12,866
I do?

722
00:47:12,867 --> 00:47:14,219
She does and you should read it.

723
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,110
I should read it?

724
00:47:15,111 --> 00:47:16,279
You should read it.

725
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,298
I'd love to read it.

726
00:47:17,299 --> 00:47:18,547
Seriously?

727
00:47:18,548 --> 00:47:20,339
Seriously, I look forward to reading it.

728
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,399
Here's my card.

729
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,280
Email me the script,

730
00:47:22,281 --> 00:47:24,089
then we'll talk about it, okay.

731
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:24,923
Enjoy your lunch.

732
00:47:24,923 --> 00:47:25,756
Nice meeting you.

733
00:47:25,757 --> 00:47:27,959
It's a great script,
you're gonna love it.

734
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,609
You know, he is just a really good guy.

735
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,657
Like salt of the earth good guy.

736
00:47:32,658 --> 00:47:34,276
Hollywood needs more of those guys.

737
00:47:34,277 --> 00:47:35,682
My script is not what he wants.

738
00:47:35,683 --> 00:47:37,525
Of course your script is what he wants.

739
00:47:37,526 --> 00:47:40,140
And now that you've added
that Jenny character

740
00:47:40,141 --> 00:47:41,552
and she's learned all that stuff

741
00:47:41,553 --> 00:47:42,629
about the island and the conflicts,

742
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,076
you have all this potential

743
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:45,199
to add something really great.

744
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,513
Like Erin Brockovitch. She investigates

745
00:47:47,514 --> 00:47:49,059
to find a solution,

746
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,880
but what she finds, she doesn't wanna hear

747
00:48:28,803 --> 00:48:29,931
Hola.

748
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:32,789
Hola, look at you.

749
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:35,479
So you ready to go to the beach?

750
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,013
How can I go to the beach
now that I know the truth?

751
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:40,759
Okay, bye.

752
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,211
Have fun.

753
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,599
Hola, chica.

754
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,433
Hola.

755
00:48:53,434 --> 00:48:54,674
You're fighting a good fight?

756
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,239
Oh, no, not me, my friend, Jenny.

757
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,839
She's very passionate about the island.

758
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,029
Well, we see more of those every year.

759
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:05,599
So you've lived here for a while?

760
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,063
17 years.

761
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:10,479
You would not believe
how incredibly peaceful

762
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,539
and beautiful it was then.

763
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,199
There were no hotels.

764
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,849
Well, there were no turistas.

765
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,309
The world's caught a virus.

766
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:20,689
It's a nasty one and it's spreading.

767
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:24,483
Gotta love those viruses.

768
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,383
Take care.

769
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:29,737
You know, I could've
moved here 10 years ago.

770
00:49:30,808 --> 00:49:34,869
Well, I'm sure you
have a really nice life.

771
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:35,870
Not really.

772
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,625
She's looking for something
to make her happy during

773
00:49:41,626 --> 00:49:44,949
a time when she's not happy.

774
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,699
Alex B. White is gonna read your script.

775
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,749
Aren't you excited?

776
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,583
No.

777
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:52,279
Look, it doesn't
matter if it's a rom-com,

778
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,479
it doesn't matter if it's what he wants,

779
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,713
it's a great movie.

780
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,032
Don't get down on yourself.

781
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,769
But I changed my mind about Jenny.

782
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:01,640
She's a sidekick.

783
00:50:01,641 --> 00:50:03,139
She should be fun and light.

784
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,589
Have her out exploring the island

785
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:05,480
with its music.

786
00:50:05,481 --> 00:50:07,364
Have her always at a party, dancing

787
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:09,795
and Alex B. White is into romance,

788
00:50:09,796 --> 00:50:12,144
so give him double the romance.

789
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:15,889
Susan desperately seeks
intimacy with Luis,

790
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,298
while Jenny experiences
love in many forms.

791
00:50:23,066 --> 00:50:24,066
Hey.

792
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,169
Hola.

793
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:27,259
Hola.

794
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,199
This is the vendor
philosopher that sold me shit.

795
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,970
Well, today's selling love.

796
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,093
Sex.

797
00:50:40,093 --> 00:50:41,093
No.

798
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,119
He says it not sex,
it's love and passion.

799
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,209
So not sex?

800
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,322
No.

801
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,078
Tell me about this guy.

802
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:54,137
Eve.

803
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,429
Hello, Jenny, if you buy my love,

804
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,389
I will hear you, I will
hear what you want.

805
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,473
I will hear what you are
saying and you will be heard.

806
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,039
Because to feel in love is

807
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,869
to feel like someone is listening.

808
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:35,724
I like this.

809
00:51:36,697 --> 00:51:38,899
If you could sell love, I'd buy it.

810
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,355
But you can, look, Nacho.

811
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,646
He's a musician.

812
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:00,389
So basically I'm just gonna feel like

813
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:02,555
a princess for a day.

814
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:11,579
Look, Susan, this is exactly
what you need, El Mudo.

815
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,307
- El Mudo.
- El Mudo.

816
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,650
This guy is universal language.

817
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,242
He's got a point.

818
00:52:54,243 --> 00:52:56,342
He says if you choose to feel the love,

819
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:57,571
then you're gonna feel love

820
00:52:57,572 --> 00:52:58,856
and it will be love.

821
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:11,222
Jenny, please tell me
you didn't fall for that.

822
00:53:11,223 --> 00:53:12,266
I don't know.

823
00:53:12,267 --> 00:53:14,634
The thought of buying
love is kind of exciting.

824
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,017
I wanna redeem my coupon.

825
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:24,209
Yes, I came all the way out here

826
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,247
to redeem my coupon
because my life is a mess

827
00:54:27,248 --> 00:54:28,689
and it doesn't make any sense

828
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,619
and every time I try to make sense of it,

829
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:32,089
all I can think about is a time

830
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,209
when I met a prince

831
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:36,570
and I was his princess and life was good.

832
00:54:46,682 --> 00:54:48,857
I can't be away for three days.

833
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:50,158
It has to be three days.

834
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,509
One is like it never happened.

835
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,449
Two is a tease.

836
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:58,542
Three is a parenthesis.

837
00:54:58,543 --> 00:54:59,968
I remember.

838
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,543
I came all the way out here just because

839
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:10,800
of that little piece of paper

840
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,743
that I've kept all this time.

841
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,603
But I never cheated on Dora.

842
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:22,942
And I never would.

843
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:27,725
Not even with you.

844
00:55:27,726 --> 00:55:29,766
I'm not asking you to leave your wife

845
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:32,023
or your kids or family.

846
00:55:33,424 --> 00:55:35,215
I know you're happy with them.

847
00:55:35,216 --> 00:55:37,197
It's not about the sex at all.

848
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,258
We don't have a future, I know,

849
00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:43,085
but we do have a past.

850
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:46,705
I'm gonna wait for you.

851
00:55:51,088 --> 00:55:53,039
I'm gonna wait for you at that spot

852
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,602
on the beach every day
until I leave on Tuesday.

853
00:55:55,603 --> 00:56:00,070
I'm gonna be there and I hope you'll come.

854
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:16,620

871
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:27,669
How are you doing?

872
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,590
Would you like to come
over here and have a beer?

873
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,509
This is my friend, Banana

874
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:34,673
and I'm Guero.

875
00:57:34,674 --> 00:57:37,260
So come on over.
Hi, Banana.

876
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,229
So what are you
doing out here all by yourself?

877
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:43,209
Just, I've been waiting
for someone, a friend.

878
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,043
Yeah?

879
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,010
Just waiting.

880
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,010
Yep.

881
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:55,131
I know, she doesn't have a Corona.

882
00:57:55,132 --> 00:57:57,153
You want a Sol?

883
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:58,929
Banana, let's take off.

884
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:01,505
Let's go down the beach some more.

885
00:58:01,506 --> 00:58:02,904
Take care.

886
00:58:02,905 --> 00:58:04,929
I have a sandwich.

887
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:05,763
You have a sandwich?

888
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:07,121
What have you got?

889
00:58:07,122 --> 00:58:08,799
She has a sandwich.

890
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,959
Hey, you wanna eat something.

891
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:18,619
So Susan waits for Luis,

892
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,784
but what happened to Jenny?

893
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:21,654
I don't know,
she's not even supposed

894
00:58:21,655 --> 00:58:23,379
to be in this movie.

895
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,854
No, keep her in the movie.

896
00:58:24,855 --> 00:58:27,201
Give her like a hot Latin
guy, we're in Mexico.

897
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:29,219
Like a weekend of love.

898
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,973
Love, not sex?

899
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:31,974
Love.

900
00:58:32,851 --> 00:58:34,427
Like the kind of love

901
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:36,609
that you remember on your deathbed,

902
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,349
like you and Jimmy.

903
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,327
What, so women can have
unrealistic expectations?

904
00:58:42,328 --> 00:58:44,609
And the men will have warped perceptions

905
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,612
of who they think they should be.

906
00:58:46,613 --> 00:58:47,816
Just do it for me.

907
00:58:47,817 --> 00:58:48,650
Do it for those of us

908
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:50,256
who need a new fantasy

909
00:58:50,257 --> 00:58:52,874
because Bryan Alonsio is getting old.

910
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:55,459
So how about a really hot Latin guy

911
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,439
with his shirt always unbuttoned

912
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,849
and always like a little bit shiny

913
00:58:58,850 --> 00:58:59,869
and like those perfect abs

914
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:00,879
and we see some six-packs

915
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,939
and we got that rock hard body,

916
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,289
but just enough, like not too much,

917
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,569
but you know that Latin type

918
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,403
that's kind of like in the middle.

919
00:59:05,403 --> 00:59:06,236
You are too much.

920
00:59:06,236 --> 00:59:07,069
And you know what?

921
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,662
She can buy it from the vendor.

922
00:59:08,663 --> 00:59:10,159
Buy the love.

923
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,761
So there'll be a page in the book

924
00:59:11,762 --> 00:59:13,340
where they're looking at the book

925
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,929
and it's like love,

926
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:17,277
the guy with the biggest
heart on the island.

927
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,071
A shark, are you serious?

928
01:00:19,072 --> 01:00:20,265
It's action.

929
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:22,516
They're all
telling me I need action.

930
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:25,608
No, this is ridiculous.

931
01:00:25,609 --> 01:00:28,612
Go back to your story without the shark.

932
01:00:28,613 --> 01:00:29,837
What happens?

933
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:32,276
Okay, so Susan waits
for Luis every morning

934
01:00:32,277 --> 01:00:33,692
at the deserted hotel.

935
01:00:33,693 --> 01:00:35,547
Right, but Luis doesn't come.

936
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,462
So she meets these friendly locals

937
01:00:37,463 --> 01:00:38,685
who invite her to a party.

938
01:00:38,686 --> 01:00:41,120
We are inviting you
to a party in Yalahou

939
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:42,351
you wanna come?

940
01:00:42,352 --> 01:00:45,553
I can't, I'm waiting for someone.

941
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,899
Who are you waiting for?

942
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:55,332
Nobody, nobody.

943
01:00:57,414 --> 01:00:58,414
Okay.

944
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:03,056
I did it again.

945
01:01:03,057 --> 01:01:06,289
I knew better and I did it again.

946
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:08,359
I sent it out for people to read

947
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,386
and, of course, nobody understands.

948
01:01:10,387 --> 01:01:14,193
There's no such thing as
failure, just feedback.

949
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,629
Alex B. White wants to read my script.

950
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:18,791
Oh, no, don't do it.

951
01:01:18,792 --> 01:01:22,093
It's just, it's so good
and he won't get it

952
01:01:22,094 --> 01:01:23,759
and it's gonna crush you.

953
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,229
It's all right to serve people dinner,

954
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:29,633
but don't put your balls on the plate.

955
01:01:32,687 --> 01:01:34,619
I told him it was a romantic comedy.

956
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,969
You hate romantic comedies,

957
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:37,394
how could you write one?

958
01:01:37,395 --> 01:01:39,079
It's "Nothing But a Structure."

959
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,697
Gunther Lopez Graham?

960
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:43,099
Oh, I love this book.

961
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,839
Love this book.

962
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,843
Zoe, I got it.

963
01:01:47,844 --> 01:01:48,690
Yes.

964
01:01:48,691 --> 01:01:51,800
The movie opens with Susan's
best friend inviting her

965
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:53,825
to his wedding in Mexico,

966
01:01:53,826 --> 01:01:56,119
only she loves him.

967
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,537
Good typical character arc.

968
01:01:58,538 --> 01:02:01,055
So, she arrives in Mexico to attend

969
01:02:01,056 --> 01:02:03,861
the wedding of the man
of her dreams, but then.

970
01:02:03,862 --> 01:02:04,780
Wait.

971
01:02:04,781 --> 01:02:06,429
She gets an idea.

972
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:08,465
Would you be my date for the wedding?

973
01:02:08,466 --> 01:02:10,039
Me no speak English.

974
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,129
So she invites the sexy bellhop

975
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,829
to be her fake wedding date.

976
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,079
And it turns out that the best man had sex

977
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,022
with the wife when they were in college.

978
01:02:18,023 --> 01:02:21,256
So while Susan is in
love with the groom,

979
01:02:21,257 --> 01:02:24,203
the best man is in love with the bride.

980
01:02:24,204 --> 01:02:26,054
You know, Gunther Lopez Graham is doing

981
01:02:26,055 --> 01:02:27,426
a seminar on his book.

982
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:30,086
He guarantees you leave
with a first draft.

983
01:02:30,087 --> 01:02:31,558
- Really?
- Yes.

984
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:34,255
- This is raping my soul.
- Oh, please.

985
01:02:34,256 --> 01:02:36,659
Armando, that's a bit much.

986
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,645
What does that mean?

987
01:02:37,646 --> 01:02:40,249
Before driving a car,
you must first know

988
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,670
where you're going or you run out of gas.

989
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:45,259
That's why I created the 14-story points

990
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,082
of successful screen plays.

991
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,582
The greatest script in the world is

992
01:02:53,957 --> 01:02:55,557
"Nothing But a Structure."

993
01:02:55,558 --> 01:02:57,734
The first thing the audience must know

994
01:02:57,735 --> 01:02:59,699
is your protagonist's profession.

995
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,999
Somebody give me a job.

996
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,449
A barista.

997
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:03,867
Good.

998
01:03:03,868 --> 01:03:05,649
How about a place?

999
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,799
Coffee shop.

1000
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,899
Brilliant.

1001
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:11,399
Story point number two,
bombardment of conflicts.

1002
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,919
By page 10, there should
be three conflicts.

1003
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,800
Can I get a conflict?

1004
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:18,323
She's lonely, single and men suck.

1005
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:21,310
Good.

1006
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:22,143
More.

1007
01:03:22,144 --> 01:03:23,639
Her best friend's getting married

1008
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,219
and he's the love of her life.

1009
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,476
Bravo, more.

1010
01:03:26,477 --> 01:03:28,819
And Bryan Alonsio can play the lead.

1011
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:30,746
Incredible, tell me more.

1012
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:51,319
Story point number four, living a lie.

1013
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:56,089
By 25 pages in, she is
living a full on lie.

1014
01:03:56,090 --> 01:03:57,829
This is my boyfriend, Ricky.

1015
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,339
Confusion sets in

1016
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,806
and the audience begins to get nervous.

1017
01:04:00,807 --> 01:04:02,491
No speak English.

1018
01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:04,049
Oh, cool.

1019
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:09,050
Ricky, I'm so happy
that Susan met a man.

1020
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:14,219
Story point number 6, a fly on wall.

1021
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,719
A fly on a wall.

1022
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,840
At the 30 minute mark,
you must literally put,

1023
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:26,963
Literally! A fly on a wall.

1024
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,167
This is the forbidden moment

1025
01:04:29,168 --> 01:04:31,683
where the audience feels
like they're voyeurs.

1026
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:44,209
I'm bored.

1027
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:46,439
My script doesn't inspire me.

1028
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,590
Your script is great.

1029
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:50,567
You're not bored?

1030
01:04:50,568 --> 01:04:53,773
No, no, but I do have one suggestion.

1031
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:58,803
You should make her a
little bit more accessible.

1032
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:01,330
Accessible?

1033
01:05:02,044 --> 01:05:04,599
An A-list actress would make

1034
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,483
your movie into a blockbuster,

1035
01:05:07,484 --> 01:05:10,783
so get an A-list actress.

1036
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,629
If we black people don't make films

1037
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:20,679
with black people, then who will?

1038
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,419
That's why we have to look to each other

1039
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:25,519
to help each other, to lift each other,

1040
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,190
to support each other,

1041
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:29,689
to employ each other.

1042
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:37,283
That's how black films get made.

1043
01:05:38,256 --> 01:05:39,809
Zoe.

1044
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,629
How's the script?

1045
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,723
I turned Susan white so it'll sell.

1046
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,302
I would like to hang out with you

1047
01:05:47,303 --> 01:05:50,179
some time after the group.

1048
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,083
What do you say, can I take you out?

1049
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,846
So there is an event in WeHo,

1050
01:05:55,847 --> 01:05:56,680
would you like to come?

1051
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:58,893
I don't know, but I have
some photos of my own.

1052
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,360
You wanna see?

1053
01:06:03,036 --> 01:06:05,699
You've been following Ricky?

1054
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,303
I never did like jalapenos.

1055
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,385
Me no speaking English.

1056
01:06:10,386 --> 01:06:11,469
I love you.

1057
01:06:12,423 --> 01:06:13,702
I know.

1058
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:14,703
I love you.

1059
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:17,849
I know.

1060
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,103
Susan has become engaged.

1061
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,070
We would like to invite you
to have a double wedding.

1062
01:06:29,767 --> 01:06:32,166
Things I should have
done or should have said

1063
01:06:32,167 --> 01:06:35,334
or could have done or would have done.

1064
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:40,866
If we women don't represent ourselves

1065
01:06:40,867 --> 01:06:42,299
in a respectful manner,

1066
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,479
then we will continue to be portrayed

1067
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,115
as these hyper sexualized
unrealistically beautiful

1068
01:06:49,116 --> 01:06:51,779
objects of desire.

1069
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,780
We as women filmmakers will
stand for that no more.

1070
01:06:57,152 --> 01:06:58,492
I can't do it.

1071
01:06:58,493 --> 01:06:59,539
I'm writing a script full

1072
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,799
of beautiful, flawless women,

1073
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,029
who makes us normal women hate ourselves.

1074
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,659
Sell your commercial script.

1075
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:07,959
And use that money to make a change

1076
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:08,930
in your next project.

1077
01:07:08,931 --> 01:07:12,059
And the only Mexican
left doesn't speak English

1078
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,819
and wears a sombrero.

1079
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,284
Dang!

1080
01:07:15,285 --> 01:07:19,236
Is that Ricky? That's so weird.

1081
01:07:19,237 --> 01:07:23,269
Oh, honey, what are you doing here?

1082
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:24,529
I play with the band.

1083
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:25,879
You hire me during the day.

1084
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,179
At night I am free.

1085
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:29,456
Ricky and I have a surprise

1086
01:07:29,457 --> 01:07:32,143
for the lovely bride and her groom.

1087
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:48,940
If we vegetarians don't
honor our fellow animals

1088
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,099
and start writing parts for people

1089
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,100
who don't eat meat,

1090
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:59,856
the world will continue
to look at animals not

1091
01:07:59,857 --> 01:08:02,753
as precious living spiritual beings,

1092
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,773
but as tasty morsels.

1093
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:20,614
The one thing I did stay true to is

1094
01:08:20,615 --> 01:08:22,563
no one eats meat in this film.

1095
01:08:23,629 --> 01:08:26,030
Oh, Zoe, your script's gonna sell

1096
01:08:26,031 --> 01:08:28,080
and it's gonna be the
highest grossing movie

1097
01:08:28,081 --> 01:08:29,610
of the century.

1098
01:08:34,513 --> 01:08:37,488
What did you do to deserve me?

1099
01:08:43,313 --> 01:08:47,762
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

1100
01:08:47,763 --> 01:08:48,763
I do.

1101
01:08:56,983 --> 01:08:59,380
Great, well written.

1102
01:08:59,381 --> 01:09:00,849
Structure's super solid,

1103
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:03,287
rich characters, captivating story.

1104
01:09:03,288 --> 01:09:05,707
I can see Bryan Alonsio in the lead

1105
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,269
with Amy Ann Smith.

1106
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:08,103
It's great.

1107
01:09:08,104 --> 01:09:09,350
It's just not for me.

1108
01:09:09,351 --> 01:09:10,352
What?

1109
01:09:10,353 --> 01:09:11,849
I changed everything for you.

1110
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:14,309
Don't change, diversity is in right now.

1111
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:15,759
I mean, you're a black woman writer

1112
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,043
and not one of your characters is black.

1113
01:09:18,044 --> 01:09:19,909
Diversity doesn't mean

1114
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,318
that all your characters have to be black.

1115
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,318
It means diverse points

1116
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,289
of view telling universal narratives.

1117
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:28,529
Well, don't shy away
from black characters.

1118
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:30,939
Urban movies are doing great.

1119
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:32,784
Can I give you another script to read?

1120
01:09:32,785 --> 01:09:34,536
It's about a woman in Mexico.

1121
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:36,459
Does it have black characters?

1122
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:38,959
Yes, the lead woman is black

1123
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,239
and the rest are Mexicans.

1124
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,443
I can't do Mexicans right now.

1125
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,174
Blacks, yes. Mexicans?

1126
01:09:47,175 --> 01:09:48,175
Mm-mm.

1127
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:56,950
I had a dream that one day my black ink

1128
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:02,468
and my white paper would make
beautifully colored movies

1129
01:10:02,469 --> 01:10:03,799
that all people could enjoy.

1130
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:08,800
I had a dream that a
beautiful black woman

1131
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,829
at a bar would take this white man home

1132
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:13,663
and make a beautifully colored baby.

1133
01:10:18,884 --> 01:10:21,109
I had a dream.

1134
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:22,989
Tell me your dream.

1135
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,644
I'm telling you.

1136
01:10:25,528 --> 01:10:27,629
No. Tell me your movie.

1137
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:28,859
It doesn't matter.

1138
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,059
It's not gonna get made.

1139
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:35,645
Tell me anyway. I'll
make it up in my mind.

1140
01:10:37,353 --> 01:10:40,270
Did you ever, you ever
want somebody so bad

1141
01:10:41,273 --> 01:10:43,440
but couldn't because of timing

1142
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:46,691
and it tormented your soul?

1143
01:10:46,692 --> 01:10:49,699
But the fact that the love existed at all

1144
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:50,952
made you thankful?

1145
01:10:53,327 --> 01:10:54,327
Mm-hmm.

1146
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,460
Yep.

1147
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:13,333
Hey, hello, Jimmy.

1148
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,259
Hey, call me back.

1149
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:19,603
I might not be in Los Angeles much longer.

1150
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:23,847
Turns out this writing
thing just didn't pan out.

1151
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,757
Can I see you?

1152
01:11:27,877 --> 01:11:29,495
I don't know.

1153
01:11:29,496 --> 01:11:31,690
I was just thinking maybe, you know,

1154
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,099
maybe we could get together

1155
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,549
and you could hold me like you used to

1156
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:37,957
and I could, um.

1157
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:44,493
Oops, drunk.

1158
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:48,056
So, just call me back

1159
01:11:48,057 --> 01:11:51,163
and I'll be waiting.

1160
01:11:58,466 --> 01:12:00,770
Every morning by the deserted hotel,

1161
01:12:00,771 --> 01:12:01,833
I'll be waiting.

1162
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:08,941
I'm gonna live to be 110,

1163
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:12,603
They tell me they'll extract my DNA.

1164
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,669
Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.

1165
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:59,564
A modern day "Waiting for Godot."

1166
01:12:59,565 --> 01:13:02,499
Yeah, I love the
visuals. It's beautiful.

1167
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,839
If it's good, then why am I a secretary?

1168
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,308
Nothing worth having comes easy.

1169
01:13:07,309 --> 01:13:09,420
The right person just
hasn't read it yet.

1170
01:13:09,421 --> 01:13:13,699
Who's the right person, you? You?

1171
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,769
Apparently the right people
only exist in this room.

1172
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:19,560
Isn't insanity doing the
same thing over and over

1173
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:21,739
and expecting a different result?

1174
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:24,249
But we are writers, we're real writers.

1175
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:27,543
We are more writers than any
staffed union workers bowing

1176
01:13:27,544 --> 01:13:29,329
to the studios.

1177
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:31,399
But we have no audience.

1178
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,468
True art, Zoe, has no audience.

1179
01:13:35,469 --> 01:13:37,079
So you'd all be happy

1180
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,349
if your scripts never got made?

1181
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:40,183
Yes.

1182
01:13:40,184 --> 01:13:41,279
I never thought I'd get one made.

1183
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,229
You're the only ones
who I let read mine.

1184
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,919
But you sit here and complain.

1185
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,209
If we didn't complain,
there wouldn't be tragedy.

1186
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:49,499
We need the tragedy.

1187
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,459
Don't ruin a good today thinking

1188
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,069
about a bad tomorrow.

1189
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:53,903
Mm.

1190
01:13:53,904 --> 01:13:55,129
That's right, Bill,

1191
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:57,244
that's absolutely right.

1192
01:13:57,245 --> 01:13:58,867
Buck up, princess.

1193
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:00,984
Always look on the bright side of life.

1194
01:14:00,985 --> 01:14:02,750
What accent are you doing?

1195
01:14:02,751 --> 01:14:05,290
Yeah, that was British. Are you Turkish?

1196
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:07,722
Guys, art, art is my accent.

1197
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:10,438
What does that even mean?
Where are you actually from?

1198
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:12,436
I'm from Bangor, Maine, all right?

1199
01:14:12,437 --> 01:14:14,662
Oh, you're American,
that's so disappointing.

1200
01:14:14,663 --> 01:14:16,629
You are crazy, you're crazy.

1201
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:18,329
I'm crazy.

1202
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,683
This all is crazy.

1203
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:24,723
So, same time next week?

1204
01:15:08,386 --> 01:15:12,997
And so that rich kid who
spent his summers interning

1205
01:15:12,998 --> 01:15:17,430
at his famous uncle's
talent agency finally became

1206
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,883
the Bryan Alonsio.

1207
01:15:22,193 --> 01:15:24,063
Yes, I know.

1208
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:28,699
To anybody who wants to be me, just do it.

1209
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:29,879
It's not hard.

1210
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,233
Borrow money from your rich grandparents.

1211
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:34,609
Call up your old Harvard roomie

1212
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:36,909
and have him introduce
him to his famous cousin.

1213
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:39,025
Oh, I never thought of that.

1214
01:15:39,026 --> 01:15:42,503
Anyone can do anything.

1215
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:46,197
I did.

1216
01:15:49,689 --> 01:15:50,939
I know, I know.

1217
01:15:54,255 --> 01:15:55,509
There you go.

1218
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,629
Take that, do great things.

1219
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,619
Thank you so much.

1220
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:00,620
Thank you.

1221
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Take care now.

1222
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:14,093
Claude, why don't you go ahead.

1223
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:17,490
Are you okay?

1224
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,379
Anybody can do anything?

1225
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,159
Yeah, totally.

1226
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,644
I can't. And you should stop saying that

1227
01:16:24,645 --> 01:16:26,254
because you don't know what it's like

1228
01:16:26,255 --> 01:16:29,233
to waste your life on
something that never happens.

1229
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:33,859
All I ever wanted was to tell my stories

1230
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:36,939
and have someone say it's a great movie,

1231
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:39,203
let's make it.

1232
01:16:39,204 --> 01:16:41,289
Don't give up, it can still happen.

1233
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:45,209
No, no more dreams.

1234
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:48,369
You know, the thing about dreams is

1235
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:51,903
when you fail, it's not
just your dreams that fail,

1236
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,230
it's your life.

1237
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:57,509
I know.

1238
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:59,839
Um, I know.

1239
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,199
It's a heartless industry.

1240
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:04,899
You don't know.

1241
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,535
You're a success.

1242
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,713
Bryan Alonsio is a success.

1243
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,443
Jake W. Olsen is not.

1244
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,612
Who's Jake W. Olsen?

1245
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:20,653
Um, I am.

1246
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:23,930
I was.

1247
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,369
Back when I thought I could succeed

1248
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:30,089
by being a good actor.

1249
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:31,202
I was rejected, too.

1250
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,093
- Hmm.
- A lot.

1251
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,819
Until I hired a publicist

1252
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:41,283
and started selling
Bryan Alonsio, the brand.

1253
01:17:41,284 --> 01:17:44,069
But your book is a bestseller.

1254
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:47,229
Yeah, but I didn't write that book.

1255
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,380
I haven't even read it.

1256
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,180
It's gross, right?

1257
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:55,929
Look, anything I wanna
be in is gonna get made.

1258
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:57,409
So, tell me about your movie,

1259
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:58,779
is there a part for me?

1260
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:01,563
No, no there's no parts for you.

1261
01:18:02,414 --> 01:18:03,514
You could be an extra.

1262
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,209
An extra.

1263
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:09,209
Nobody ever offers me parts as an extra.

1264
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:11,289
Hey, it's a first.

1265
01:18:11,290 --> 01:18:13,040
I think I'd be really good at it.

1266
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:17,439
Look, what are you doing right now?

1267
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,049
I wanna hear about your movie.

1268
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:20,150
Wanna go have a drink?

1269
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:22,150
Seriously?

1270
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,558
It's on me.

1271
01:18:24,559 --> 01:18:25,949
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1272
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:26,809
Sure.

1273
01:18:26,809 --> 01:18:27,809
All right.

1274
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,759
You really wanna hear about my script.

1275
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,909
Yeah.

1276
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:33,199
- Okay, let's do it.
- Let's go.

1277
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,766
You gotta read this book, though.

1278
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:35,808
I'm kidding.

1279
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:43,623
Susan realizes that after
three days of waiting,

1280
01:18:43,624 --> 01:18:45,769
Luis is not gonna come.

1281
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:47,976
So she goes to the party with the locals.

1282
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:01,567
What are you doing here?

1283
01:19:01,568 --> 01:19:02,759
I'm on a date.

1284
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,039
I paid for love.

1285
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,343
I paid.

1286
01:19:05,344 --> 01:19:07,840
I figured big guy, big love.

1287
01:19:07,841 --> 01:19:11,232
Hola.

1288
01:19:11,233 --> 01:19:13,514
Gracias, mi amor.

1289
01:19:29,077 --> 01:19:30,077
Oh, hey.

1290
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:47,477
I'm glad you're happy.

1291
01:19:49,057 --> 01:19:50,596
I'm very happy, look.

1292
01:19:50,597 --> 01:19:52,259
You look happy.

1293
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:53,349
So you paid for him?

1294
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:54,619
Yeah, I did.

1295
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:56,689
It was amazing, don't make
fun of me, I loved it.

1296
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,097
Because I created something

1297
01:19:58,098 --> 01:20:00,549
and I decided to believe in it

1298
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:02,939
and that's when I realized
if you create something...

1299
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,349
everything is how we see it anyway, right?

1300
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:07,943
But, seriously, it
doesn't matter about Luis.

1301
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:10,666
You can pay for love, too.

1302
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:12,760
Really, it was amazing.

1303
01:20:15,183 --> 01:20:16,783
I'll really think about that.

1304
01:20:16,784 --> 01:20:18,209
I'm gonna think about that.

1305
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,809
There's somebody here for you.

1306
01:20:21,217 --> 01:20:22,217
You ready?

1307
01:20:30,677 --> 01:20:31,677
Vamos.

1308
01:20:39,512 --> 01:20:40,512
Let's go.

1309
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,656
Does your uncle still live on that farm?

1310
01:21:00,657 --> 01:21:02,999
Yep, there's a road there now.

1311
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,619
So you don't have
to go on that tiny plane?

1312
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,343
Nope, you can drive in and out now.

1313
01:21:08,344 --> 01:21:09,468
I think I'll never forget

1314
01:21:09,469 --> 01:21:11,393
that last weekend we spend there.

1315
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:19,010
I was sad because I left
and you didn't come with me.

1316
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,179
You made me leave alone.

1317
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:25,830
I'll never forget your
face looking out the window.

1318
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,367
That plane.

1319
01:21:35,309 --> 01:21:36,476
What are you doing?

1320
01:21:36,477 --> 01:21:38,493
I'm going to get some dinner.

1321
01:21:42,219 --> 01:21:43,673
All right, I'll be waiting.

1322
01:21:44,630 --> 01:21:46,243
I'll be right here.

1323
01:21:48,117 --> 01:21:49,117
Okay, bye.

1324
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:52,619
For a moment, Susan is happy.

1325
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:55,074
For this moment, she is living

1326
01:21:55,075 --> 01:21:57,463
the life that she could have had

1327
01:21:57,464 --> 01:22:00,163
if she had gone back with him to Mexico.

1328
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:06,320
If she had followed her
heart instead of her head.

1329
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,393
If she would have just
gotten on that plane.

1330
01:22:13,752 --> 01:22:14,657
- Come with me.
- What are you doing?

1331
01:22:14,658 --> 01:22:15,660
Come with me.

1332
01:22:15,661 --> 01:22:16,662
I don't have any clothes.

1333
01:22:16,663 --> 01:22:17,878
I'll buy your clothes, come on.

1334
01:22:17,879 --> 01:22:19,564
- No, I can't.
- Come on.

1335
01:22:19,565 --> 01:22:23,297
The life they would have shared,

1336
01:22:23,298 --> 01:22:26,558
the family they would have had.

1337
01:22:29,536 --> 01:22:32,202
Listen to your father.

1338
01:22:45,559 --> 01:22:47,642
Thank you, Mom.

1339
01:22:50,089 --> 01:22:51,261
You didn't fight for me.

1340
01:22:51,262 --> 01:22:52,499
What are you talking about?

1341
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,187
Why didn't you fight for me?

1342
01:22:55,188 --> 01:22:57,671
Why didn't you fight for us?

1343
01:22:57,672 --> 01:22:59,558
I begged you to come with me.

1344
01:22:59,559 --> 01:23:00,393
No, no, you didn't.

1345
01:23:00,394 --> 01:23:02,409
You didn't even try.

1346
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,243
I did try.

1347
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:04,609
No, you didn't.

1348
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:07,359
I couldn't stay in your
lovely welcoming country

1349
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:08,808
without my student visa.

1350
01:23:08,809 --> 01:23:10,009
You could have tried harder.

1351
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:21,063
I pictured you every
day coming to surprise me.

1352
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,923
I woke up every morning
with a broken heart.

1353
01:24:02,443 --> 01:24:07,443
♪ I saw you in the moonlight ♪

1354
01:24:08,483 --> 01:24:13,483
♪ You were wearing blue ♪

1355
01:24:14,286 --> 01:24:18,571
♪ I'm so in love ♪

1356
01:24:18,572 --> 01:24:21,489
♪ In love with you ♪

1357
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:32,039
You want a massage?

1358
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,850
I can give you a massage.

1359
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:36,749
Proper full massage.

1360
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:39,092
With a happy ending?

1361
01:24:40,123 --> 01:24:42,040
I could be convinced.

1362
01:24:49,289 --> 01:24:50,654
Is that a goose?

1363
01:24:50,655 --> 01:24:53,512
I don't know.

1364
01:24:53,513 --> 01:24:54,622
Yeah.

1365
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:56,373
Do you want to?

1366
01:24:56,374 --> 01:24:57,665
Yeah.

1367
01:24:57,666 --> 01:24:58,666
So.

1368
01:25:00,447 --> 01:25:02,727
Should we move to the bed?

1369
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:03,807
Big bed.

1370
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:04,808
Oh.

1371
01:25:19,195 --> 01:25:20,362
I can't do this.

1372
01:25:22,496 --> 01:25:23,732
Do what?

1373
01:25:23,733 --> 01:25:25,983
You're married, remember?

1374
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:30,654
But I love you.

1375
01:25:38,813 --> 01:25:40,202
What's going on?

1376
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:49,823
What's in your mind?

1377
01:26:04,389 --> 01:26:06,139
I'm HIV positive.

1378
01:26:34,368 --> 01:26:35,535
Now you know.

1379
01:26:53,767 --> 01:26:54,767
Come.

1380
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,558
This is big.

1381
01:27:43,559 --> 01:27:45,888
Why wouldn't she reveal that earlier?

1382
01:27:45,889 --> 01:27:48,859
She had no reason to until now.

1383
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,429
Does he leave his wife?

1384
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:51,263
Does he get AIDS?

1385
01:27:51,263 --> 01:27:52,108
HIV, not AIDS.

1386
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:56,369
You can have sex without catching it.

1387
01:27:56,370 --> 01:27:58,718
Do they stay together? The kids?

1388
01:27:58,719 --> 01:27:59,719
So how does it end?

1389
01:28:01,389 --> 01:28:02,669
I don't know.

1390
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:04,159
It doesn't even matter.

1391
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,360
It's not gonna get made.

1392
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:17,216
Bryan, hey, what's up.

1393
01:28:17,217 --> 01:28:19,563
Sammy, I found my next movie.

1394
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,433
Call everyone in tomorrow.

1395
01:28:21,434 --> 01:28:22,557
Let's get this thing green lit.

1396
01:28:22,558 --> 01:28:24,558
Okay, will do.

1397
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:26,480
Tomorrow at noon.

1398
01:28:26,481 --> 01:28:28,919
They're all coming in to hear your pitch.

1399
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:29,753
I'm gonna be on set,

1400
01:28:29,754 --> 01:28:31,637
but I'm pretty sure
that you can handle this

1401
01:28:31,638 --> 01:28:32,649
on your own.

1402
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:34,129
I have pitched that movie

1403
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:36,217
to everyone who has ears.

1404
01:28:36,218 --> 01:28:37,492
They won't buy it.

1405
01:28:37,493 --> 01:28:40,539
At this level, it's
not about a great movie.

1406
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:44,109
It's about Bryan Alonsio's next project.

1407
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:46,493
It can be a jar of shit
and they would buy it.

1408
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,779
Now let's write that part for me.

1409
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:51,149
That part for you?

1410
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:52,963
You said I could be an extra, right?

1411
01:28:54,559 --> 01:28:57,857
Well, it's the ladies' last night out.

1412
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:51,507
Jenny.

1413
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:59,400
Jenny

1414
01:31:34,313 --> 01:31:35,313
Jenny.

1415
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:40,532
Are you okay?

1416
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:46,159
- Yeah, I'm good.
- You are?

1417
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:47,813
I'm really good.

1418
01:31:47,814 --> 01:31:49,399
Look, I'm really not the one

1419
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:52,119
to give any advice on relationships,

1420
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:55,799
but if you love this guy,
you should give it a shot.

1421
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:56,633
You love him?

1422
01:31:56,634 --> 01:31:57,781
Yeah, I do.

1423
01:31:57,782 --> 01:32:01,019
Give it a chance, see what happens.

1424
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:02,010
Don't be a fool.

1425
01:32:02,011 --> 01:32:04,109
I'm not a fool.

1426
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:08,743
Look, the tragic ending was
like part of the package.

1427
01:32:11,306 --> 01:32:12,308
What?

1428
01:32:12,309 --> 01:32:13,839
I paid for the tragic ending.

1429
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:15,229
So this wasn't real?

1430
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,909
No, it was real, it was super real.

1431
01:32:16,910 --> 01:32:17,790
Like everything is real.

1432
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:19,933
Like life is real, like life is not real.

1433
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:21,392
We had this really great time

1434
01:32:21,393 --> 01:32:22,895
and like he showed me amazing things

1435
01:32:22,896 --> 01:32:24,011
and we talked about a lot

1436
01:32:24,012 --> 01:32:25,342
and in the end I was
like if I'm gonna do it,

1437
01:32:25,343 --> 01:32:26,745
I might as well do it-

1438
01:32:26,746 --> 01:32:29,145
- It doesn't make sense to me.

1439
01:32:29,146 --> 01:32:29,978
Who knows?

1440
01:32:29,978 --> 01:32:30,812
I don't know what's gonna happen.

1441
01:32:30,813 --> 01:32:32,029
Maybe he'll visit me,

1442
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:35,653
but for now it is what it is.

1443
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:38,449
Just like you and Luis, right?

1444
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:39,450
How was that?

1445
01:32:41,647 --> 01:32:42,647
To life.

1446
01:32:43,313 --> 01:32:44,146
Salud.

1447
01:32:44,147 --> 01:32:46,659
To doing what we need to do

1448
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:48,763
to survive this life.

1449
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:52,599
To life. To experiences.

1450
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,955
To survival.

1451
01:32:54,956 --> 01:32:55,789
Here, here.

1452
01:32:55,789 --> 01:32:56,675
To money.

1453
01:32:56,676 --> 01:33:00,522
When we met, I knew that
you had something special.

1454
01:33:00,523 --> 01:33:01,619
Thank you.

1455
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:03,669
I know the perfect director for this.

1456
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:05,165
He will wanna do his own rewrite.

1457
01:33:05,166 --> 01:33:06,000
Mm.

1458
01:33:06,001 --> 01:33:07,829
Collin Thompson Mitchell.

1459
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:10,217
Exactly! And he doesn't
allow writers on set,

1460
01:33:10,218 --> 01:33:12,317
but your movie's in great hands.

1461
01:33:12,318 --> 01:33:14,279
To a great movie.

1462
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,109
To doing what you need
to do to survive this life.

1463
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:18,170
Survival.

1464
01:33:24,299 --> 01:33:26,349
Zoe, this is so exciting.

1465
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:28,239
I can't believe you
haven't seen a cut yet.

1466
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,315
What kind of director
doesn't involve the writer?

1467
01:33:31,148 --> 01:33:33,619
Believe. Achieve. Succeed.

1468
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:35,309
Zoe, look, there's your name.

1469
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:43,580
I love you.

1470
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:48,221
I know.

1471
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:50,627
I love you.

1472
01:33:51,487 --> 01:33:52,487
I know.

1473
01:33:55,477 --> 01:33:57,227
I love you.

1474
01:33:58,826 --> 01:33:59,826
I know.

1475
01:34:03,887 --> 01:34:06,643
Ricky, he's just wants to marry you

1476
01:34:06,644 --> 01:34:07,977
for your papers.

1477
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:13,640
Ricky, you just wanna
marry me for my papers.

1478
01:34:13,641 --> 01:34:15,207
You just want to marry me

1479
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:17,638
to make your best friend jealous.

1480
01:34:17,639 --> 01:34:20,441
Actually, I don't
wanna marry you at all.

1481
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:22,659
You will marry me

1482
01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:26,169
and we'll give all the guests

1483
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:28,759
these lovely party favors

1484
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:31,495
to take them back to the states.

1485
01:34:31,496 --> 01:34:33,352
Whoo, oops.

1486
01:34:33,353 --> 01:34:35,144
Is that cocaine?

1487
01:34:35,145 --> 01:34:36,145
Indeed.

1488
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:41,029
If the drugs do not arrive

1489
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:44,673
or you and I do not get
married, I will kill you

1490
01:34:45,534 --> 01:34:47,112
and your family.

1491
01:35:25,757 --> 01:35:27,388
I'm gonna go through my savings

1492
01:35:27,389 --> 01:35:28,679
and put money on credit cards

1493
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:29,808
and I'm just taking this risk

1494
01:35:29,809 --> 01:35:31,463
because now or never right?

1495
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:34,724
So anything you can give

1496
01:35:34,725 --> 01:35:38,009
to help an artist achieve her dream

1497
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:43,010
in an industry that really
is not conducive to art.

1498
01:36:10,742 --> 01:36:11,808
This is Delio.

1499
01:36:11,809 --> 01:36:13,536
I have just asked him if he would play

1500
01:36:13,537 --> 01:36:16,339
my love interest, my lover.

1501
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:20,505
♪ You were wearing blue ♪

1502
01:36:57,443 --> 01:36:58,551
So I'm here with Alvaro

1503
01:36:58,552 --> 01:37:01,986
and he's agreed to be
the taxista in my film.

1504
01:37:01,987 --> 01:37:04,570
I've known Alvaro for 17 years.

1505
01:38:14,067 --> 01:38:18,150
Keep going.

1506
01:38:28,264 --> 01:38:29,308
You know what?

1507
01:38:29,309 --> 01:38:31,698
I feel like we need to shoot here.

1508
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:32,532
I mean, I feel like we need

1509
01:38:32,533 --> 01:38:34,757
to have Jenny talking here.
Okay.

1510
01:38:35,635 --> 01:38:38,112
So who can she be talking to?

1511
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:45,173
Can we just deal with that.

1512
01:38:46,323 --> 01:38:48,968
We'll have to justify my clothes,

1513
01:38:48,969 --> 01:38:51,173
like I change clothes
before every interview.

1514
01:39:44,090 --> 01:39:45,090
Bullshit.

1515
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:47,759
We are artists.

1516
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:51,499
Be an artist, do not sell out.

1517
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:52,556
So I came to Aidan one morning

1518
01:39:52,557 --> 01:39:56,039
and I said, "Today, you and
I and my stuffed animals

1519
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,761
are gonna act out the
entire LA unshot version

1520
01:39:58,762 --> 01:40:00,101
of the movie."

1521
01:40:00,102 --> 01:40:02,346
And Aidan just looked
at me and said, "Okay."

1522
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:08,456
Many geniuses weren't even acknowledged

1523
01:40:08,457 --> 01:40:10,549
until after they were dead.

1524
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:12,293
Like that Harry Potter lady.

1525
01:40:13,933 --> 01:40:15,813
Zoe has a script just like that.

1526
01:40:16,730 --> 01:40:17,680
You do?

1527
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:18,513
I do.

1528
01:40:18,514 --> 01:40:20,958
She does, it's like Erin Brockovitch.

1529
01:40:20,959 --> 01:40:24,413
Anybody can do anything. I did.

1530
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:28,569
We have a team of writers

1531
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:30,529
that we bring on to fix up scripts.

1532
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:34,489
Beside, I already know the
perfect director for him.

1533
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:36,023
Collin Thompson Mitchell.

1534
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:39,689
To a great movie.

1535
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:42,879
To doing what you need
to do to survive this life.

1536
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,246
To survival.
