1
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,888
- So, to get the answer, we
take the number of babies

2
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:02,794
with Down's Syndrome who
test positive divided by

3
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:10,796
the total number of
positives, which is 9.5

4
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:18,838
divided by 9.5 plus 49.5,
equaling 16.1%,

5
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,914
what I trust is a somewhat
counter-intuitive answer,

6
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:29,054
given the high probability
of the test producing

7
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:32,891
a correct result if the baby
has Down's Syndrome and

8
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,928
the relatively low
probability of false positives.

9
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,466
Now, this is an example of
the False Positive Paradox.

10
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:46,138
Any questions? Good.

11
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,508
Now, remember that the
mid-term is next Tuesday.

12
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,744
I will be available in my office
hours today, but please

13
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,247
only stop by if you have
specific questions

14
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:58,450
on specific problems. I will
not be offering an overview

15
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,952
of the past eight
weeks. All right,

16
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:04,990
that will be all for today.

17
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,462
-Hey Claude. How are you?

18
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:47,499
- Who are we playing tonight?
- Tom and Dick.

19
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:52,237
Then the Hendersons.
- Great. That means listening to

20
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,539
Tom clear his throat every
five seconds.

21
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,308
-Mm

22
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,345
hm. Let's take our seats.

23
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,429
- OK, I should be
back around five.

24
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:28,300
Um, leftovers in the
fridge if you get hungry.

25
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,268
-OK, see you later.

26
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,971
- Oh, hey, are you going running
today?

27
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,241
- I don't think so, I'm just
going to read my book. Why?

28
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,244
I was just going to have you
mail a few letters for me.

29
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,314
Never mind, I can mail them.

30
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,382
Have a good day.
- See you later.

31
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:48,520
-Bye sweet girl.

32
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,331
-Hey, ooh.

33
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:37,369
Oh my, oh my, aren't
we getting big?

34
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,675
Auntie Kim's bored with
her book. What do you say

35
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,578
we go for a little jog in
the park, huh? Hm,

36
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,681
how does that sound? Let
Auntie Kim get our jackets,

37
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:53,718
and then we can
be on our way. Yeah? OK.

38
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,042
- Excuse me, miss? Miss? Ah,
is this Pier Point Park?

39
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,346
- Yes, it is.
- Where is the clock tower?

40
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,383
- Clock tower? Um, I'm not aware
of any clock tower in the park.

41
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,119
- How odd, I'm supposed to
meet someone here,

42
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:31,623
that's what she said. See?
- I don't know. I mean

43
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:13,698
Shh. Shh. Sit up. Shh.

44
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:34,552
I'm gonna remove the gag now.

45
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:39,724
Now, we're miles away from
anyone, so it's not gonna

46
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:43,762
do you any good to scream.

47
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,069
- Annie, the baby, where is she?
What have you done with her?

48
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,239
-The baby? Is she not your baby?

49
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,741
- Where is
she? Is she OK?

50
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,244
- I've done nothing to the baby.
I left her in the stroller

51
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:02,714
by the jogging path. Now, I'm
sure she's been found already.

52
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:06,651
I'm sure she's all right.
Now, you referred to her

53
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:10,688
as "the baby," not "my
baby." Is she not yours?

54
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,195
- She's my niece. Who are
you? What do you want with me?

55
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:27,598
- Your niece? How unfortunate. I
was rather hoping she was yours.

56
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:33,545
- Why? What do you
want with me?

57
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,246
- All questions that will
undoubtedly be

58
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:39,284
answered in due time.
Now, let's get you out of this.

59
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,254
You'll be much more comfortable.

60
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:51,256
Here, OK. Here we go. Stay
still. OK, OK. I'm just gonna

61
00:13:53,300 --> 00:14:00,605
Here, OK. Here we go. Stay
still. OK, OK. I'm just gonna

62
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:04,642
put this around your
leg, all right? OK.

63
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:14,745
Here we go. Stay still. I'm not
gonna hurt you. Here we go.

64
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:22,894
There we go. All right now,
let's take these handcuffs off.

65
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,613
Here, OK. OK.

66
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:34,305
There we go.

67
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:42,307
No, no. I don't
want to hurt you,

68
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:47,619
but if you resist,
I may have to.

69
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,361
You must be hungry.
I'll get you some food.

70
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,719
- Oh my God, oh my
God, oh my God.

71
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,737
-I brought you your breakfast.

72
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:10,495
Tell me your name.

73
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,166
-Why are you doing all this?

74
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,569
What do you want with me?

75
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,805
You said I would find out in
due time.

76
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:24,842
- You are to be my nourishing
mother,

77
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,112
my alma mater, if you will.

78
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:33,451
Now, please, eat some of your
breakfast, and we'll have

79
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:37,488
a nice little chat
in the meantime.

80
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,560
-Tell me your name.

81
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,899
-Kim.

82
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,936
And how old are you, Kim?
- 24.

83
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,910
- Now, I noticed an engagement
ring, but no wedding band.

84
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:07,812
Were you to be married soon?
- Yes. In four months.

85
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:17,061
- And what do you do?
- What does it matter?

86
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,030
- I'm just trying to make
conversation,

87
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:23,067
get to know you a little bit, is
all. Do you have a job?

88
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,440
- No.
- Are you a student?

89
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,479
- I Just finished getting my
Master's in English literature.

90
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:40,751
Well, congratulations.
That's wonderful.

91
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,990
And, what were you planning
to do with your degree?

92
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:52,163
- I Thought I might try to
write a novel.

93
00:18:52,831 --> 00:19:00,831
A novel? Excellent. Well here,
here you will have ample time

94
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,845
and few distractions.
I'll have to get you materials.

95
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,882
Now, I know that the
effects of imprisonment

96
00:19:10,884 --> 00:19:14,919
can be psychologically
devastating. But, having a

97
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,490
goal, a project, a
raison d'être

98
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:23,694
as it were, can go a
long way to keeping you healthy.

99
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,637
-I'm not the first, am I?

100
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,676
-What?

101
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,713
- The first woman
you've done this to?

102
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:55,059
- Why do you say that?
- What you just said,

103
00:19:55,061 --> 00:20:00,097
this whole set-up, the
chains, the chamber pot,

104
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:08,099
the hand for turning the light
off. You've done this before.

105
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:18,983
- You are a clever girl.
- What happened to the others?

106
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:23,120
-Other. There is only one other.

107
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,822
- What happened to her?
Where is she?

108
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:29,327
- Look, I'm afraid that you've
hit upon a subject that I

109
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:33,097
don't wish to discuss.
Now, I'm sure that you are

110
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:36,067
fearing the worst, but you
mustn't, OK? You're not

111
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:40,104
her, so please, let's talk
about something else.

112
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,909
Anything else.
- Is she dead?

113
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:59,717
You killed her, didn't you? And
you're gonna kill me too. Why?

114
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,165
Why? Look, look, I don't
know who you are or

115
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,103
how you got me here. Just let
me go. Just let me go,

116
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,371
and I won't say anything.

117
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:17,608
- Please don't get hysterical,
please, please.

118
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,679
I am not going to harm you.

119
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:28,286
You must believe that.

120
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,090
But I can't just let you go.

121
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,297
But someday...

122
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,134
I will let you go.

123
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,107
Why don't you finish
your breakfast.

124
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:58,109
- I'm not hungry.
- Very well then.

125
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:07,185
In that case, I'm gonna
have to ask that you wear this.

126
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:15,700
In that case, I'm gonna
have to ask that you wear this.

127
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:20,271
Now, I hope
that we can dispense with it

128
00:22:20,273 --> 00:22:28,273
in the near future, but
I don't want to be bitten again.

129
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:41,319
Open up, open up.
There you go. Come here.

130
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:50,228
All right, now, I'm not
going to hurt you.

131
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:57,708
I'm gonna have to ask that you
wear the wrist clasps too.

132
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:06,016
All I'm going to do is
massage your breasts.

133
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:14,018
That's it. I'm not going
to hurt you. Come here.

134
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:22,933
That's it. I'm not going
to hurt you. Come here.

135
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:30,935
Shh. There you go. Stand
up. Shh, shh. OK.

136
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:40,979
Shh. There you go. Stand
up. Shh, shh. OK.

137
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,769
I have something I
thought you might like to see.

138
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:42,012
As you can see, the baby was
found.

139
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:47,818
I thought you might
like to know that.

140
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:26,156
-What is this?

141
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:29,627
- Seared foie gras,
with braised fennel and

142
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:33,864
cracked pepper caramel sauce.

143
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:40,437
- Foie gras? That's liver, isn't
it?

144
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:44,508
- Yes. It's a special kind of
goose liver. It's delicious.

145
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,486
-I hate liver. I won't eat it.

146
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:02,059
-Just try it.

147
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,230
- No. Besides, that's
the kind of liver that they

148
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:09,066
have to torture the goose to
get, isn't it?

149
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:13,103
- It's not torture. Just try it.
- No.

150
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,411
- Just have one bite. If you
don't like it, fine.

151
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,150
- It's OK. I won't eat anything
tonight.

152
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:33,924
-All I ask is that you try it.

153
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:56,313
You're not even going to
have one bite?

154
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,969
I'll teach you to eat liver.

155
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:40,024
Tonight I've made lamb chops,
with mushroom risotto.

156
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,542
Butternut squash ravioli
with braised root vegetables.

157
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:02,012
Minestrone soup with
parmesan cheese

158
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:06,050
and fresh French bread.

159
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:21,699
Hungarian goulash with spaetzle.

160
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:46,516
- OK. I get it. I'll try
anything you give me.

161
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:59,764
- Get it? You'll never get it.
My purpose is to train you,

162
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:05,242
not educate you.

163
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,250
-Fuck you.

164
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:18,622
-That's never going to happen.

165
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:55,759
- How do you expect
me to produce milk

166
00:29:56,427 --> 00:30:02,499
if you starve
me? I thought you were

167
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,537
supposed to be some kind
of intellect? It doesn't

168
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,208
seem like you thought this
one through.

169
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,757
- Home-made meatloaf
with mashed potatoes

170
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:04,795
and baby carrots. Stir-fried
vegetables with rice.

171
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:10,801
Tonight we are having
liver. Beef liver, with

172
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:15,672
mushroom medley and a red wine
reduction sauce, for me.

173
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:27,818
And for you

174
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:54,979
Wait.

175
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,028
Well, Liver isn't so bad after
all, I see.

176
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,768
Well, I'm glad that
this little experiment is over.

177
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,574
Maybe now we can go back and eat
meals like civilized people.

178
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:24,067
Quite the little
artist, aren't we now?

179
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,074
I thought you were more the
literary type.

180
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:46,356
I'll have to get you a sketch
pad then. And a washing coat

181
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:25,275
- I've never heard
of induced lactation.

182
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:32,315
Are you sure it's gonna work?
- Induced lactation by

183
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,051
mechanical manipulation is
successful with most

184
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:39,089
women, although there are
no guarantees.

185
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:46,830
- How long is it supposed to
take?

186
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:50,867
-Not long. Two to four weeks.

187
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,175
- You don't have to use
the cuffs and the ball gag

188
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:03,213
anymore, Claude. I'm not
gonna do anything stupid.

189
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:10,987
-I'd like to believe that.

190
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:17,627
- What can I do? Even
if I could harm you,

191
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:21,665
there'd be no point.
I'd die in here.

192
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:37,347
What if it doesn't
what if it doesn't work?

193
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:41,384
- What?
- If you can't induce lactation?

194
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:55,124
There are drugs we can try,
hormones to be more precise,

195
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:59,836
although I'd have to think
about how to obtain them.

196
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:09,813
Of course, pregnancy
would be another option.

197
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,290
-When will you let me go?

198
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:24,327
- I told you to stop
asking me that.

199
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:38,441
- I wish you wouldn't
smoke in here.

200
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:49,185
-I'm sorry. I never asked

201
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:53,223
if the smoke bothered you.
How selfish of me.

202
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,399
Making good use of the crayons,
I see.

203
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:36,901
-Yep.

204
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,943
-Do you mind if I have a look?

205
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,980
-I don't suppose I can stop you.

206
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:56,019
- If you don't want me to look, I
won't.

207
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,230
- No, go ahead. I don't
mind.

208
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,315
-Non-representational I assume.

209
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:29,352
- No, it's representational.
It is the sun,

210
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:36,125
at least my memory of it. I
miss the sun.

211
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:53,369
- I like it. Shall I
hang it up on the wall?

212
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,446
-I don't care.

213
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:58,081
-To brighten up the room a bit.

214
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:02,118
-Whatever.

215
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:47,597
- I suppose I could arrange it so
that you could go outside.

216
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:59,535
So that you could see the
sun again. Would you like that?

217
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,915
-Very much.

218
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:11,554
-Very well then.

219
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:15,652
-Claude!

220
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:25,662
Claude!

221
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:34,604
Claude!

222
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,015
Claude!

223
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:33,489
- I need to take your
temperature.

224
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:38,394
-To know when I've ovulated.

225
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:42,431
-Precisely.

226
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:48,538
-Couldn't get the drugs.

227
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,739
-No.

228
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:53,776
- Or the hormones, to
be more precise.

229
00:46:56,213 --> 00:47:03,352
- 98.6 exactly. Well, we
have our baseline.

230
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:07,390
-Isn't that wonderful.

231
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:38,187
- It's a beautiful day outside
today.

232
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:49,732
Would you like to see
it for yourself?

233
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:51,301
-Yes.

234
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:05,848
-Beautiful day.

235
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:11,921
-I so wanted to see the sun.

236
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:23,766
-We take so much for granted.

237
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:31,574
Strange, how we can never really
appreciate something until

238
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:35,611
we are denied it.

239
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:46,522
I accidentally started a fire.

240
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:52,595
Burned the house down.

241
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:02,939
-Goodnight my dearest.

242
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:06,976
I love you.
- Goodnight mommy.

243
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:44,874
Mommy, mommy! Wake up, mommy!

244
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,110
Mommy, mommy, mommy,

245
00:50:48,112 --> 00:50:52,348
mommy! Mommy, please, wake
up! Mommy, please! C'mon,

246
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:56,952
mommy, please, wake up
mommy! Just please wake up

247
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:00,956
mom! Mom, please wake up!
Please!

248
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:04,994
I couldn't wake her
to get her out.

249
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:09,799
-Who raised you?

250
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:16,839
-My mother.

251
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,610
I could tell you one
thing I've been thinking about

252
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:23,479
quite a bit lately.

253
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:26,649
-What's that?

254
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:34,651
- About getting away. I've been
focusing on this narrow problem,

255
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:39,495
putting so much energy
into it that the bigger picture

256
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:43,532
just gets lost.

257
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:47,203
I think a simpler existence
would be better.

258
00:51:47,205 --> 00:51:49,438
The question is, what to do?

259
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,476
- Exactly.
So, what do you propose to do?

260
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,817
-I'm not sure.

261
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:04,487
- I guess it just
doesn't bother me

262
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:07,857
that the big questions will go
unanswered.

263
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:11,894
- But how do you keep yourself
from asking the questions?

264
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:16,765
- Well, I can think of one pretty
good way.

265
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:21,103
Ralph! Another round of drinks.

266
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,579
- Today's the day. We
need to get this into you.

267
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,186
You can insert the semen
yourself if you wish.

268
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:41,223
I will just observe.

269
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,160
-What if I refuse?

270
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:48,197
Then I will bind you and
do it myself if necessary.

271
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:52,735
I just figured you would rather
do it yourself.

272
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:56,805
All of this so you can have

273
00:52:56,807 --> 00:53:00,943
lactating breasts to suck on,
Claude?

274
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:03,212
It doesn't make
any sense. I'm sure there

275
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:05,648
are women you can pay to
satisfy your fetish.

276
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,283
Look on the web. Hire a
wet-nurse. You don't need

277
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:11,520
to go through all of this.

278
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:21,697
-You think I haven't tried that?

279
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:26,502
-What happened?

280
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:30,539
-I hired a professional that

281
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:34,577
specializes in my fetish,
as you called it.

282
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:43,052
- And that wasn't enough?
Why not?

283
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,623
-It was just different.

284
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,892
-What was different about it?

285
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:53,929
- I can't explain it.
It just was.

286
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:04,640
-What about the baby?

287
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:05,774
-What about it?

288
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:09,178
- What do you intend
to do with it?

289
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,247
-Whatever you like.

290
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:15,351
You can keep it if you'd like.

291
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:18,754
- And raise it in this dungeon?

292
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,055
You really are crazy.

293
00:54:20,057 --> 00:54:21,323
-Then I will drop it off

294
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:24,693
anonymously at a hospital.
It doesn't matter.

295
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:28,731
Now, first things first.

296
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,756
You are so absolutely beautiful.

297
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,230
You're radiant.

298
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:14,336
How can you miss
the sun when you are the sun?

299
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:20,743
You radiate warmth and light.

300
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:25,381
You obliterate the darkness.

301
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:32,921
-You're drunk, Claude.

302
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:37,926
-A bit. But as the saying goes,

303
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:41,463
in vino veritas.

304
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:45,701
- Why have you been drinking so
much?

305
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:52,441
- Because you've been in my
dreams.

306
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:57,379
- So, I don't see the
connection.

307
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:02,718
- It's not good for
you to be in my dreams.

308
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,787
I need to keep you
out of my dreams.

309
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:08,824
- I still don't see why that
makes you drink.

310
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:18,734
- Because when I drink, I'm not
haunted by my dreams.

311
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:27,409
The night passes in silence and
darkness.

312
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:35,350
That's what I need when
I sleep.

313
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,358
And you, as the
light of the day.

314
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:34,076
Good night, and sweet
dreams to you, my love.

315
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:59,968
- Who's a famous mathematician
that starts with an E?

316
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,904
-Euclid.

317
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:04,072
-It's five letters.

318
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:06,074
-Euler.

319
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:07,643
-That starts with an E?

320
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,411
-Yes.

321
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:10,579
-How do you spell it?

322
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:14,616
-E-U-L-E-R.

323
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,991
-Thank you.

324
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,372
- Well, I'm going to
make us lunch.

325
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:40,342
Would you care for
anything in particular?

326
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:44,379
- Yeah. I'm craving pickles
and ice cream.

327
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:49,952
-Pickles and ice cream?

328
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:54,189
-Don't you know what that means?

329
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:56,425
-No.

330
00:59:56,427 --> 01:00:00,262
- It means the turkey baster and
I are going to have a baby.

331
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:04,299
-Really?

332
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:29,257
I got you this.

333
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:33,662
I thought you might like to wear
it for dinner.

334
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:30,152
-How did you know my size?

335
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:34,189
The woman at the store was quite
helpful.

336
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:43,432
-Will you wear it?

337
01:01:43,434 --> 01:01:43,934
-Why?

338
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:56,738
- I don't know. I thought you
would look nice in it.

339
01:01:57,381 --> 01:02:01,416
- I didn't think that
mattered to you.

340
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:12,494
-Will you wear it?

341
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,606
- I'll wear it but on one
condition.

342
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:28,643
-What's that?

343
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:32,280
- I want a mirror, and not
just a small one,

344
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:36,318
but big enough to
see how the dress fits.

345
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:43,091
- I think I can
accommodate that.

346
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:45,513
- I like this wine. What kind
is it?

347
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:50,819
- It is a Ribera del Duero
from Spain.

348
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:54,789
It's made from the
Tempranillo grape.

349
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:58,827
I like it too.

350
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:10,305
-It tastes rather charcolately.

351
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:27,722
-Charcolately.

352
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:35,724
I like that. It is earthy, a
hint of charcoal, a bit of

353
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:41,603
chocolate in the finish.
You are becoming quite the

354
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:45,640
connoisseur.

355
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:49,911
- And to think I didn't even
like wine before.

356
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,350
-To new discoveries.

357
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:10,465
I could live without the wine.

358
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:58,747
- I... I do hope you appreciate
that

359
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:02,784
I've tried to make things
better for you.

360
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,924
I really want this to work out.

361
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:15,264
-This?

362
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:25,940
What "this?"

363
01:07:25,942 --> 01:07:29,978
How could "this" possibly work
out?

364
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:54,102
- Well, your sun pictures no
longer have the

365
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:58,139
"I will kill Claude" message in
them.

366
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:04,012
-You knew.

367
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,817
-I could hardly blame you.

368
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:17,425
But I do hope your
feelings for me have

369
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:25,427
softened, at least a little?

370
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:32,140
-What do you want me to say?

371
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:36,044
True, I don't
want to kill you anymore,

372
01:08:36,046 --> 01:08:40,081
and I don't want you to
kill me.

373
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:45,487
I don't want anyone
to kill anyone.

374
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:54,629
But I can't go on like this
forever.

375
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,665
The only way this
can possibly work out is

376
01:08:57,667 --> 01:09:01,703
if you let me go.

377
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:07,809
I want to see my Tommy again.

378
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:12,847
I want to see my family.

379
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:17,952
I want to have a normal life.

380
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:26,995
- I do wish I had
never taken you.

381
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:32,534
But what can I do now?

382
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:36,004
-I wouldn't talk.

383
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:39,707
I swear.

384
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:42,977
No one would find
out who you are.

385
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:50,979
You say that now,
but I know you too well.

386
01:09:55,058 --> 01:10:03,058
You are a kind-hearted,
intelligent person.

387
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:12,140
I am a monster.
The thought that I might

388
01:10:12,142 --> 01:10:15,910
subject someone else to
what you've been through,

389
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:23,912
or worse, it would gnaw at you.
The guilt would be too much.

390
01:10:25,956 --> 01:10:31,626
Or worse, it would gnaw at you.
The guilt would be too much.

391
01:10:31,628 --> 01:10:35,663
You would tell them everything.

392
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:03,791
Maybe there is one way.

393
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:44,098
-Claude!

394
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:50,272
Claude!

395
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:13,728
There's my boy.

396
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:25,306
Come to mommy, Claude.

397
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:48,262
There's my boy.

398
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:52,300
I knew you'd come to mommy.

399
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:56,204
You've been a good boy, haven't
you, Claude?

400
01:12:56,206 --> 01:13:00,241
-Yes, mommy.

401
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:08,883
-Claude.

402
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,228
-You don't need her anymore.

403
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:38,413
I'm here for you, Claude.

404
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:52,753
No, Claude. Not that.
You know what I need.

405
01:13:53,463 --> 01:13:57,498
-No, no.

406
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:03,371
No.

407
01:14:03,373 --> 01:14:07,408
No, I can't. No, no!

408
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:43,991
Are the bandages OK?

409
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:58,305
Are you comfortable?

410
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:12,319
You're not talking?

411
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:18,392
OK. I don't blame you.

412
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:25,633
But there is a silver
lining here. Now I...

413
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:30,304
I know you may not see it,
but there is hope.

414
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:43,777
You were in my dreams. One of
my bad dreams.

415
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:56,391
And yet, I didn't kill you. I
stopped it. This is good.

416
01:18:58,434 --> 01:19:06,434
And yet, I didn't kill you. I
stopped it. This is good.

417
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:12,246
Is it not? We can move on.

418
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:26,560
There is no reason to believe

419
01:19:26,562 --> 01:19:30,598
that anything like that
will ever happen again.

420
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:36,804
I can... I can stop it.

421
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:41,308
-Let me go. Please, please.

422
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:46,714
Please, please let me go.

423
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:11,305
You think I don't feel trapped?

424
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:23,277
I am the prisoner. I am the one
who can't escape.

425
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:31,325
I'm the one who's dying here.

426
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:07,628
I'm going out of town for a
couple of days.

427
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:12,800
This should hold you over until
I get back.

428
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:17,838
-Where are you going?

429
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,976
- North American Bridge
Championships.

430
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:26,213
- With David?
- Yes, of course with David.

431
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:36,850
- When will you be back?
- We have a flight back on Monday

432
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:38,759
but if we get knocked out of the
tournament,

433
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:42,796
I may come back earlier.

434
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:50,437
I'm gonna fix dinner.

435
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:54,475
Is there anything in particular
you'd like?

436
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:05,419
- Steak. Those T-bones you made
before were very good.

437
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:12,293
- Craving iron? You're not on
your period, are you?

438
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:16,330
- No. I think I'm just craving
steak.

439
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:34,615
Do you think I could eat alone?

440
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:40,854
-I suppose. Why?

441
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:45,759
- I'm just not in the mood for
any conversation tonight.

442
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:49,463
- We could eat in silence. I
don't mind.

443
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:53,500
- Please, Claude. You've been
making me nervous lately, and

444
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:57,538
I would just like to eat in
peace.

445
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:06,840
-Fine. I'll be down later.

446
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:42,876
Give me your plate, please.

447
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:47,514
-Get it yourself.

448
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:53,520
Come on, Kim. I don't want
to play games.

449
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:13,040
Where's the steak knife?

450
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:18,979
Kim, I know you have the knife.

451
01:25:18,981 --> 01:25:23,016
Give it to me, please.

452
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:11,912
-Claude?

453
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:16,183
Claude, are you here?

454
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:32,999
Claude?

455
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:36,704
Claude?

456
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:45,812
- Claude, what's
happening? Are you there?

457
01:29:48,783 --> 01:29:49,283
Claude!

458
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:57,217
-Hey. I made you tea.

459
01:30:57,219 --> 01:31:01,254
-Thank you.

460
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:12,098
- Are you gonna schedule that
appointment?

461
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:26,379
Kim, I don't understand. You
know what he said about certain

462
01:31:26,381 --> 01:31:30,283
psychoses likely being
hereditary.

463
01:31:30,285 --> 01:31:34,321
-I know what everybody said.
