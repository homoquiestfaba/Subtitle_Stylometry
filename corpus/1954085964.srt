summer's gonna be over.

874
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,210
(Lardo) So what?
That always happens.

875
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,150
So, we're all outta
high school, now.

876
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:14,810
And some of us are gonna
go to college, get jobs,

877
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:18,010
and start
doing adult stuff.

878
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,750
Yeah, and shit that we hate.

879
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:23,090
Well look, all I'm
saying is, you know;

880
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,960
things are gonna
be different, now.

881
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:31,460
Man! I hate this shit.

882
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:37,240
Start talking about the future;
getting all high and serious.

883
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,670
Shit.

884
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,940
I don't know what I'm
gonna do in an hour!

885
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,380
Yeah, and that's really fucked.

886
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,080
What are you saying,
Anne? A lot of people,

887
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,820
they stay in Ventura -
keep partying, surfing.

888
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:55,020
People like who? Harry, who,
ya know, gets kids to steal

889
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,650
beer for him? I mean, great
fucking role models, JD.

890
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,530
Well you think we should
buy into this shit?

891
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,620
That we should start
working and wearing pants?

892
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,070
Is that it? Huh?
Buying insurance?

893
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,470
Get a vacuum cleaner and shit?

894
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,730
Yeah?

895
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,170
You really think that this
is all there is to life?

896
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,680
Maybe.

897
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,550
If I thought that, I would
so fucking kill myself.

898
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,110
(Mooney) You don't
have to, you know.

899
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,820
You don't have to
buy a vacuum cleaner.

900
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,230
What choice do you have, Mooney?

901
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,440
We need more beer.

902
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,270
(Lardo) I'll go,

903
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,970
(Anne) Me too.

(Lardo) Are you okay?

905
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,100
Will you help me, Lardo?

906
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,010
Yeah.

907
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,280
Those guys were acting
like such guys, tonight.

908
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,820
Yeah.

some time to kick in, ya know?

912

Careful, dude.

913
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,600
Just thinking about Iris.

914
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:19,410
Ann's goin'to college.
Probably meet some guy.

915
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,570
Iris is moving to New York.

916
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:30,420
How do you guys
do that, anyways?

917
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:31,580
Do what?

918
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,920
Do chicks and all, man?

919
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:39,400
Easy. You just put your
hand here, inside their leg,

920
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,830
and then you
just slide it up.

921
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,340
Slide it up.
It works every time, man.

922
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,630
Feels pretty good.

923
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:53,000
Not your own leg, man.
The chick's.

924
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:05,190
Well, iris's apple wine
works pretty good, too.

925
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,460
It's just like drivin' a car.

926
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,360
What would you do if
you were gonna go on a

927
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,930
long road trip with Lumbie?

928
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,940
Get in, start her
up, and take off!

929
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,410
God, no.
Listen.

930
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,920
Ya gotta...ya gotta
sweet talk her a little.

931
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:44,960
Give her a little
loving, nurturing.

932
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:49,160
You baby her a little.
You check her um, you

933
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:53,260
check her fluids, make sure
there's enough lubrication.

934
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,900
You kick the tires, make
sure your rubber's good.

935
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:01,800
And if you feel
confident, and ready,

936
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,510
you slide in the driver's seat.

937
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,820
You tickle the starter
and you turn her over.

938
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,450
Then you slip it into drive

939
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:17,390
and you gently start
to push her forward.

940
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,230
And then you're on your way.

941
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,460
But that's when you have
to, you have to listen to her,

942
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,400
really start to pay attention.

943
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:33,170
And as she starts to warm up,
her temperature starts to rise,

944
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:37,180
that's when, you know, you
can pump her a little harder,

945
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,640
you know?

946
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,010
And she'll let ya
know when she's ready.

947
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:43,080
She'll start to hum.

948
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:46,210
When she starts to hum you go
pedal to the medal, as hard as

949
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:50,280
you can for as long as you can.
That's, that's when it's good.

950
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,020
That's when it gets, you know,
that's like you're a machine on

951
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,660
an open back road somewhere in
America with nothing but like a

952
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,430
forest or corn field on either
side of you with stars in the

953
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:08,100
sky, and no traffic lights.
There's no coppers, no worries.

954
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:11,670
That's just, that's
as good as it gets.

955
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:16,020
That's-
that's being a man;

956
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:18,720
that's heaven on earth;
that's what that is.

957
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,970
What does all that have
to do with getting women?

it for a long time, uh, Sparky.

or two, you can dole out
a whipping for yourself.

gonna fuckin kill me!

counts. You got two left.

1031

three swings.
He already took one.

1032
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,660
So he's gotta take
the other two.

Three swings; one guy.
