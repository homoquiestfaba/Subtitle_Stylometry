What?

181
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,944
One bathroom. Fun, right?

182
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:10,121
Be my guest.

183
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:17,170
Let me guess. No service.

184
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,498
- What?
- Oh, Jenn, you are a horrible liar.

185
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,208
Okay. I texted him back.

186
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,627
Why are girls so attracted
to such assholes?

187
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:26,588
You're not. Tommy's great.

188
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,006
You are not supposed
to be talking to Sam.

189
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:29,966
That is the whole purpose
of this entire trip.

190
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:32,635
Well, it's not like I have
much of a choice now, is it?

191
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:33,720
Exactly.

192
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,472
How am I gonna check my messages?

193
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:37,807
I have not gone more than
24 hours without Instagram

194
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:40,780
since, like, there was no Instagram.

195
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,353
And I'm copin'.

You knew about this, didn't you?

200
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:52,113
You said no boys, not no phones.

201
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:53,323
I did say no phones.

202
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:56,242
But you didn't say it would
be physically impossible

203
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,702
to use it behind your back.

204
00:12:57,802 --> 00:12:59,329
What is the big deal, you guys?

205
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:00,955

years without cell phones,

What if there's, like,
an emergency or somethin'?

209
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,837
There's, like, a land line.

211
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,883
You guys, you're not gonna miss
your phones. I promise you.

212
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:13,718
Now can we just get changed?

213
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:15,595
I don't wanna get changed.

214
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,738

What are you doing?

220
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:35,281
Someone could see you.

221
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,908
Who? Mrs. Gregorson?

222
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,660
I see, like, two houses here.

223
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,372
If I'm getting anything out of being
stuck in the middle of nowhere,

224
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:45,174
it's a tan without lines.

225

Come on in, bitches.

226
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,467
Well, I guess we can be grateful
she left the bottoms on.

227
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,940
I bet Mrs. Gregorson swims topless.

228
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,403
It's so nice out.

229
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,285

Oh, I'm so comfortable.

Can't Mary do it?

232
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:18,248
You used me.

233
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,285
Stop.

234
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:22,462

00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:37,802
Looks like a beaver dam.

They're so adorable.

240

Yeah, well don't get your hopes up.

241
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:43,349
I'm pretty sure they're nocturnal.

Where'd you learn that? Wikipedia?

243
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,603
I learned it from livin' in Indiana,

244
00:14:46,703 --> 00:14:48,104
which means that you
should know it too.

245
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:50,940
Well, all I know is they're fat
rats with big, stupid-ass teeth.

that should wake 'em up.

while we're walkin' around.

Kinda looks like it.

264

Maybe that's like how they mark
their territory or somethin'.

in the dam, you idiot.

have saved our lives.

than one or two folks at a time.

never be able to use a tampon

336
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,534

get murdered by your daddy

00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:34,891
get raped by my dad.

have your mom die?

I wouldn't do either.

That's so fucking disgusting.

You're sick.

352
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,400
What's the point of
this game anyways?

- You missed.
- I did it by the air, bitch.

362
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:08,925
I'll do it myself.

Y'all can make out
like you did last time.

367
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:19,101
No, that's no fun unless there's
guys around to make jealous.

368
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:20,770
That's bullshit.

369
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,105
You liked it and you know it.

370
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:25,233
Come here, come give me a kiss.

371
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,250

It's your daddy, Jenn.

Yeah, he's come to collect.

Well,

I'm just gonna have
to go and find out.

Hey, serial killers,
we've got three hot babes in here

in a really long time.

You know what, Mary?
You're a real buzzkill.

388
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:23,465
JENN: Don't go out there!

389
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,585
Why are there no streetlights?

390
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:28,421
Because there are no streets.

391
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,973

It was just the wind.

Oh, come on.

It's nice to see you too.

But that wasn't funny.

How did you even get up here?

409
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:07,843
I'm sorry, babe.
Buck talked me into it.

410
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:10,713
Yeah, I had to drag his
ass all the way up here

411
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:11,964
and the whole time he's like,

412
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,717
"Wait, no, wait, Mary said that
we're not supposed to come.

just girl's night.

her vagina all weekend."

Shut up, Buck.

Oh, my God, you guys should
have seen y'all's faces.

417

It was classic.

418
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,778
You were in on this?

care to come inside

and join me,
'cause there's no beer out here.

Magic. No, bedroom window was open.

Hi, Jenn.

428
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,593
What part of "stay away" do
you guys not understand?

429
00:22:57,693 --> 00:23:00,513
The "stay away" part.
I just don't get it.

You're not invited up here.

Hey, come on, come on.

We parked the car down the
road so you wouldn't hear us.

Besides, we missed you guys.

Mary, I haven't had sex in 36 hours.

You know, when your foot's asleep?

437

My dick's asleep.

- Wake that dick up. Baby.
- I will.

- I can't even feel it.
- Mary, please.

Mary, please, my dick's asleep.

443
00:23:24,261 --> 00:23:26,122
Wasn't this weekend for everybody?

444
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:29,596
Yeah, it was until
you fucked it all up.

445
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:32,294
No, I'm sorry.
You guys have to leave.

446
00:23:32,394 --> 00:23:35,131
But, Mary, they just drove
all the way out here.

This is my house and
I make the rules.

Jenn, do not let them
bully you into this.

No, really, maybe it will
force me to, you know,

454
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:54,120
face it head on instead
of running away.

looking for beavers since we got here?

something wrong with it.

Well, you know what we should do?

537
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:04,316
We should capture it and
we'll raise it as our own.

00:45:02,642 --> 00:45:05,086
You think we ought to go over
there and check up on them?

889
00:45:05,186 --> 00:45:08,184
You never did know when
to mind your own business.

890
00:45:09,232 --> 00:45:11,926
And you never did know
when to get up off your ass.

891
00:45:12,026 --> 00:45:13,678
You really want me to go over there

892
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:16,230
and check on a bunch
of college girls?

893
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:19,934
Because you know I might just
have to stay for their party.

894
00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:22,736

- Eww. Pig.

Buck?

897
00:45:42,056 --> 00:45:43,249
How you doing there, man?

898
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:44,375
You hanging with us?

899
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,461
Oh, God.

900
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:47,962
It's okay, buddy. Hey, hey, hey!

901
00:45:48,062 --> 00:45:50,131
Stay with us, stay with us, Buck.

902
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:52,008
Everything's gonna be good, alright?

903
00:45:52,108 --> 00:45:53,551
Oh!

904
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,178
Shit.

905
00:45:55,278 --> 00:45:57,605
- What the fuck?
- Fuck!

906
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:02,894
- Oh, no! Oh, fuck!
- They did this!

907
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,695
Fuck!

908
00:46:05,246 --> 00:46:07,289
Suck a bag of dicks!

909
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,400
Shit. Fuck!

910
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,668
There's no way around this.

911
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:15,080
Look!

912
00:46:15,298 --> 00:46:18,785
Oh, shit. Shit, wait here,
I'm gonna go check it out.

913
00:46:18,885 --> 00:46:20,586
Be careful!

914
00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:23,634
Hello?

915
00:46:25,474 --> 00:46:26,751
There's no one here.

916
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,552
What are you doing?

917
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:33,966
There's guns and one ax.

918
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:35,892
Are you gonna steal them?

919
00:46:36,611 --> 00:46:38,179
Yeah, whatever, we'll borrow 'em.

920
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:40,652
I promise, I'll bring 'em right back.

921
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:42,631
Here.

922
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:44,018
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

923
00:46:44,118 --> 00:46:47,063
- Just take it. Please.
- Should we go back to the cabin?

924
00:46:47,163 --> 00:46:49,786
- No, just you guys.
- What? Wait!

925
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,693
Go get some more guns,
load up the trunk

926
00:46:52,793 --> 00:46:54,028
and get everybody back to the cabin.

927
00:46:54,128 --> 00:46:56,656
Please, get in the car
and turn it around.

928
00:46:56,756 --> 00:46:58,366
Wait. What are you gonna do?

929
00:46:58,466 --> 00:47:00,668
I'm gonna go ahead on
foot and get some help.

930
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:01,863
You're insane, Tommy.

931
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:04,863
Zoe, please just get
in the car and hurry.

00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,051
Zoe?

933
00:47:10,478 --> 00:47:13,306
I'm sorry I never ate your pussy.

934
00:47:14,523 --> 00:47:17,646
I'm gonna go back and
eat all of it one day.

935
00:47:18,653 --> 00:47:20,721
It's okay, baby. We're gonna
get out of here, okay?

936
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:23,615

Looks like you're hemmed in
a little bit. Let's take my truck.

946
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,175
We have to save my boyfriend.

him and get out of here.

Yeah, crazy fucking babies.

What? What happened?

965
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:08,371
You do realize that the
whole point of a beaver

966
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:09,789
is that it fucking chomps wood.

967

to cover the whole house

Scared up the whole damn county.

Beaver fever?

977
00:49:48,928 --> 00:49:52,302
Caused by the Giardia parasite.

Beavers carry it.

How did they get back so fast?

1002
00:51:04,378 --> 00:51:05,905
Maybe they brought help?

1003
00:51:06,005 --> 00:51:07,957
Or something went wrong.

1004
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:12,828
There's someone else.
Wait, is it that hunter guy?

Can't say for certain.
Beavers like to chew on shit,

In class.

You should really try it some time.

- "Beavers are herbivores."
- Great book.

up zombie beavers?

"They live in family
groups or colonies

and will defend their lodge
against other beavers."

1060
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,803
Oh, oh, you think the beavers think
that they're, that we're other beavers?

1061
00:54:49,937 --> 00:54:51,638
The fuck?

1062
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:55,521
"Keen senses of hearing,
smell and touch.

- "They live up to 24 years."
- Just like us.

1068
00:55:15,129 --> 00:55:17,206
it was just,

1069
00:55:17,464 --> 00:55:19,791
it was just one of those things.

1070
00:55:20,426 --> 00:55:22,469

1074
00:55:28,475 --> 00:55:32,429
Once the three of us are
far away from this cabin,

1075
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:33,797
we can sit down like adults

1076
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,191
and we can try to figure out why
you both find me attractive.

1077
00:55:42,656 --> 00:55:45,142
Jenn, you have every
reason to hate me.

1078
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:46,943

1079
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:51,315

we cannot turn against
each other right now.

1082
00:55:56,754 --> 00:55:59,377
That is exactly what the
beavers would want.

1083
00:56:00,841 --> 00:56:02,758

1089

All clear upstairs.

1090
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:47,079
Appears the beavers have left
the premises for the time being.

1091
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:49,051

1092

what's left of her, anyway.

1093

1094
00:56:56,271 --> 00:56:57,972

1095
00:56:58,857 --> 00:57:00,634
No, it's Buck's foot.

1096
00:57:00,734 --> 00:57:03,607
We're keeping it on ice
so we could reattach it.

1097
00:57:04,238 --> 00:57:06,473
That's what we're supposed
to do, right? Keep it on ice?

1098
00:57:06,573 --> 00:57:08,976
Well, not directly on ice.
It kills the tissue.

1099
00:57:09,076 --> 00:57:11,687
Well, shit! Well, what shall I do?
Shall I wrap it in a towel or something?

1100
00:57:11,787 --> 00:57:14,364
Well, I suppose that depends
on when it came off.

1101
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,834
I... I don't know. This afternoon,
maybe four or five hours ago.

1102
00:57:18,794 --> 00:57:22,794
Technically, I guess there's a chance
that they can sew that sucker back on.

1103
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:25,617
We'd have to be at the hospital within
the hour but that ain't gonna happen.

1104
00:57:25,717 --> 00:57:29,011
Might as well just chuck the
damn thing and call it a day.

1105
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:31,874
I'm sorry. Do you want some chicken?

1106
00:57:31,974 --> 00:57:33,917
There's plenty of it in
the fridge over there.

1107
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,378
I don't want any chicken.
We need to go to the hospital now.

1108
00:57:36,478 --> 00:57:39,173
Well, you know as well as I do

1109
00:57:39,273 --> 00:57:42,342
that road's blocked. We sure as
hell can't get through on foot

1110
00:57:42,442 --> 00:57:44,143

1111

With or without
carrying the big fella.

1112
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:53,737
Plus, beavers are generally
more active at night.

1113
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:58,538
So I suggest maybe we hole
up here till the morning,

1114
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,488
then one or two of us
can make a go at it.

1115
