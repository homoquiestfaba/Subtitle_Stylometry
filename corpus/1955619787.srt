1
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,946
(Woman) You have now come
to the end of your second semester.

2
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:11,163
Some of you will remain here
to complete your education.

3
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:13,781
Some of you will go out into the world.

4
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,700
And, as is my custom,

5
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:19,745
I put to you a question
of the utmost importance,

6
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,750
which concerns your spiritual well being.

7
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,005
Do you wish to come to God
and be saved?

8
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:34,683
Those of you who wish to be Christian
and saved will move to my right.

9
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,025
To those of you who remain
and hope to be saved...

10
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,951
you will move to my left.

11
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,247
Have you said your prayers?

12
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,999
Yes.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,594
Though it can't make much
difference to the Creator.

14
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:10,212
Do I understand you correctly?

15
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,759
Do you believe that your Creator is
indifferent to your sins?

16
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,229
That, in His mercy,
He sees you slumber?

17
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,770
No, you misunderstand me.
I've not got <i>so</i> far.

18
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,935
I am not even awakened yet.

19
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,355
And how should I repent?

20
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,982
I am somewhat troubled, to be sure,

21
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,198
but my feelings are all indefinite.

22
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,909
The question is not
how far you have advanced,

23
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,120
but how far you ought to have advanced.

24
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:39,288
Not how you feel,
but how you ought to feel.

25
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,911
I don't feel anything.

26
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,961
I have no sense of my sins.
And how can I?

27
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:51,629
I wish I could feel as others do,
but it is not possible.

28
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,966
A sinner against a Holy God
and under condemnation,

29
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:01,222
and liable every moment to drop
into a burning hopeless eternity,

30
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,183
yet cannot feel, cannot be alarmed,

31
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,903
cannot "flee from the wrath to come".

32
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,570
And the true question is...

33
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,445
Are you in the Ark of Safety?

34
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,665
I fear I am not.

35
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,629
You are alone in your rebellion,
Miss Dickinson.

36
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,625
I fear that you are a no-hoper.

37
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,257
Yes, Miss Lyon.

38
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,588
<i>(Distant chatter)
(Birdsong)</i>

39
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:39,093
<i>(Emily) For each ecstatic instant
We must an anguish pay</i>

40
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:44,515
<i>in keen and quivering ratio
To the ecstasy.</i>

41
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:49,019
<i>For each beloved hour
Sharp pittances of years,</i>

42
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,691
<i>Bitter contested farthings
And coffers heaped with tears.</i>

43
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,069
<i>(Knock at door)</i>

44
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,459
Father. Austin. Vinnie!

45
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:08,044
My happiness would be complete,
if only Mother were with you.

46
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,884
The journey would have been
too fatiguing for her.

47
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:16,551
We have come to take you home, Emily.

48
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:20,098
- We were concerned by your last letter.
- You spoke of being ill.

49
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:23,721
Yes. What is it that
you are suffering from?

50
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,976
- An acute case of evangelism.
- (Church bell <i>rings )</i>

51
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:30,269
- Am I really to go home?
- Yes.

52
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,981
We will go to Amherst, via Boston,

53
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,734
and stay for a short while
with Aunt Elizabeth.

54
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,203
<i>(Emily sighs)</i>

55
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,869
<i>(♪ Bellini, "Ah Non Credea Mirarfi")</i>

56
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,617
I fear you don't approve, Father?

57
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,167
I do not like to see a woman
upon the stage.

58
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:12,955
<i>But she has</i> a gift.

59
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:17,543
A gift is no excuse for a female
to exhibit herself in that way.

60
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:22,840
And what would you have her do?
Perform an act of congress aloud?

61
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,262
That would depend
upon what key it was in.

62
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:28,601
Well, the rest of her programme
is in respectable German.

63
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:31,020
And the Germans
are wonderful in music.

64
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:32,308
That's true.

65
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:36,520
English, thank heaven,
is not a language that can be sung.

66
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,193
But, Aunt Elizabeth,
you love your hymn tunes.

67
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:42,990
Hymns are different. They have
absolutely nothing to do with music.

68
00:06:42,991 --> 00:06:45,487
<i>(Man coughs)</i>

69
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,615
<i>(Laughter)</i>

70
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,584
<i>(Applause)</i>

71
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,334
Ah, the devil in music.

72
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,127
Don't be trite, Emily.

73
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,176
<i>(♪ Schubert, "Nacht und Tréume")</i>

74
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,679
<i>(Rainfall)</i>

75
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,472
Oh, life!

76
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,225
Oh, home!

77
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,644
How wonderful you are!

78
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,986
Emily.

79
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,081
Why are you up so late?

80
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,952
- May I speak with you, Father?
- Of course.

81
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,954
As you may know, I like to write.

82
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,334
Letters, mostly... but sometimes poetry.

83
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,134
Yes.

84
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:29,633
May I have your permission to write
during the night, for quiet's sake?

85
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:34,515
I shall not disrupt
the rest of the household, I promise.

86
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,441
Yes, you may.

87
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,646
It was very considerate of you to ask.

88
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:42,563
It is your house, Father.

89
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,612
But it is our home, Emily.

90
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,122
I... I have one more favour
to ask of you, Father.

91
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,616
What is it?

92
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:58,787
You are, I believe, on cordial terms
with Dr Holland,

93
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,165
<i>the editor of the Springfield Republican.</i>

94
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,466
<i>And the Springfield Republican
publishes poetry.</i>

95
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,379
I'll write to him.

96
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,554
And if he agrees,
you may send him some of your work.

97
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:13,389
<i>(Man) "Dear Miss Dickinson,</i>

98
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,727

100
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,606
<i>"As to the rest of the poetry,

101
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:26,529
<i>"childish, like nursery rhymes.</i>

<i>"Women, I fear, cannot create

105
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,170
<i>(Aunt Elizabeth) Where's Emily?</i>

106
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:45,375
<i>- (Shouts) Emily!
' (sighs)</i>

107
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,674
Come here at once!

108
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,636
Remember, Aunt Elizabeth has
celebrated the Dickinson dynasty

109
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,107
- in 55 stanzas.
- And every one of them dull.

110
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,234
<i>(Sighs)</i>

111
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,148
Aunt Elizabeth!

112
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,904
Oh, at last, Emily.
I was nearly kept waiting.

113
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,867
And what is your opinion of my poem,
Emily?

114
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:19,832
I'm sure your verse is equal
to your talent, Aunt.

115
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,799
If I were clever enough, I should probably
take offense at that dubious compliment.

116
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,960
Oh, but, Aunt, all the best compliments
are dubious.

117
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,305
That's part of their charm.

118
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,967
Did you enjoy my verses, Austin?

119
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:39,064
Very much, Aunt.
They put <i>Paradise</i> Lost to shame.

120
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,350
Your children are far too sophisticated,
Edward.

121
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,519
I'm sure part of me disapproves.

122
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,313
- Disapproval is a heavy thing.
- Oh.

123
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,692
Besides, if I had to choose between
having sophisticated children

124
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,821
and ones that were merely docile,

125
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:56,530
I should choose the former.

126
00:10:56,531 --> 00:11:00,661
- Docility is too much like slavery.
- That sounds like abolitionist talk.

127
00:11:00,662 --> 00:11:04,251
No, it is not. But no Christian
could ever make a case for slavery.

128
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:06,466
<i>Please, let us not discuss this subject.</i>

129
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,252
It is both improper and tiresome.

130
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,880
Not to those who are enslaved.

131
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,722
(Chuckles)I see we have
a Robespierre in our midst.

132
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:17,685
No, not Robespierre.

133
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,929
Charlotte Corday, perhaps.

134
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,525
Edward, they're <i>as</i> bad as you are.

135
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,196
I believe you've had your first poem
published.

136
00:11:32,197 --> 00:11:34,568
Yes.

137
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,617
<i>In the Springfield Republican.</i>

138
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,076
It... it was printed anonymously.

139
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,328
That seems a little eccentric.

140
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,515
But in the circumstances,
probably a good thing.

141
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,343
We can't all be Milton.

142
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,813
Don't pout, Emily. It's unbecoming.

143
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,978
Poems are my solace
for the eternity which surrounds us all.

144
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:09,102
- Who said that?
- I did.

145
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,064
Well, don't. It sounds unchristian.

146
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,608
And where's Vinnie?

147
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,656
Here, Aunt.

148
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,948
<i>(Aunt Elizabeth) And what</i> of <i>you?</i>

149
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,911
Oh, I am like Pilgrim, trying to improve.

150
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,667
A pilgrim should only ever be conscious
of other people's self-improvement.

151
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:32,542
Consciousness of his own is mere vanity.

152
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:37,172
But, Aunt, vanity is such a harmless vice.

153
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,301
It's as shallow as
the people who indulge in it.

154
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,969
No vice is harmless, Vinnie.

155
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,519
Look no further than Babylon for that.

156
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,653
- What of you, Austin?
- Oh, I'm on no pilgrimage at all.

157
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,312
And what of vice?

158
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,649
Surely vice is only virtue in disguise.

159
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,871
And what is your opinion
of your children's moral laxity, Emily?

160
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:03,365
Oh, I prefer to listen and remain silent.

161
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:07,369
That way, a prejudice
doesn't seem like an opinion.

162
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,832
That reply was so Sphinx-like,
I'm none the wiser.

163
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,927
Oh, cherish your ignorance, Aunt.

164
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,929
You never know when you will need it.

165
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,588
Edward!

166
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,924
Your children astound me.

167
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,221
They ought to be sent to their rooms
and pummelled.

168
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:25,472
- Hourly.
- Calm down, Aunt Elizabeth.

169
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:30,523
Have a glass of currant wine.
Turn vice into medicinal pleasure.

170
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:33,562
- Medicinal?
- For your circulation.

171
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,737
There is nothing wrong
with my circulation.

172
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:01,224
<i>(Emily) The heart asks pleasure first,
And then, excuse from pain;</i>

173
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,895
<i>And then, those little anodynes
That deaden suffering;</i>

174
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,977
<i>And then, to go to sleep;</i>

175
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:14,070
<i>And then, if it should be
The will of its Inquisitor,</i>

176
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,524
<i>The liberty to die.</i>

177
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,257
<i>(Clock chimes)</i>

178
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,939
<i>(Clock strikes nine)</i>

179
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,578
<i>(Fire crackling)</i>

180
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,300
<i>(Clock ticking)</i>

181
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,258
(Mother) Would you play something,
Emily?

182
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:02,919
One of the old hymn tunes.

183
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,922
Of course.

184
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,862
<i>(♪ Abide with Me (Eventide))</i>

185
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,575
When I was very young,

186
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:34,168
a young man
who used to go to our church

187
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,167
used to sing that.

188
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,179
He had a lovely voice.

189
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,264
So pure.

190
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,985
He was only 19 when he died.

191
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,900
<i>(Sighs)</i>

192
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,244
he...

193
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,249
There.

194
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,790
<i>(Birdsong)</i>

195
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,583
<i>(Horses' hooves)</i>

196
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,007
<i>(Snorting)</i>

197
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,593
<i>(Neighing)</i>

198
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,767
God keep you well.

199
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,987
When He is ready, He will call me.

200
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,151
I hope you live for a hundred years.

201
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,111
What a repellent idea.

202
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,160
Oh, Aunt, don't say that.

203
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,493
I'm not afraid of death, Emily.

204
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,954
Nor should you be.

205
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,960
If we keep our souls in readiness
for God, there can be no fear.

206
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,881
He will smooth our way.

207
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,226
I shall pray for you all.

208
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,733
And remember, keep atheism at bay.

209
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:33,028
And watch the clock that ticks for us all.

210
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,246
<i>(Carriage door closes)</i>

211
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,239
Tick.

212
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,038
Tock.

213
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,286
Tick.

214
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,836
Oh, you are all impossible!

215
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,880
<i>(Emily) I went to thank her,
But she slept;</i>

216
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,882
<i>Her bed a funnelled stone,</i>

217
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:58,855
<i>With nosegays at the head and foot,
That travellers had thrown,</i>

218
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,726
<i>Who went to thank her;
But she slept.</i>

219
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:08,271
<i>'Twas short to cross the sea</i>

220
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,491
<i>To look upon her like, alive,</i>

221
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,909
<i>But turning back 'twas slow.</i>

222
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,537
You think you might smile, Mr Dickinson?

223
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,959
I am smiling!

224
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,232
<i>(Calls)</i> Emily! Emily!

225
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,611
- <i>(Door</i> opens)
- We have a guest.

226
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,162
This is Miss Vryling Buffam.

227
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,123
It sounds like an anagram, doesn't it?

228
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,839
You see before you a life
blighted by baptism.

229
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,256
Yeah, I hope you brought
to the attention of your parents

230
00:20:55,257 --> 00:20:57,052
their lack of thought in that respect.

231
00:20:57,053 --> 00:21:00,008
I have. It makes them very cross.

232
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,010
But surely they will forgive you.

233
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,890
Ah, but will I forgive them?

234
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:10,810
Weren't you at a ladies' seminary
at Fort Sumter or somewhere?

235
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,910
Mount Holyoke.

236
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:14,406
Yes, I thought it had
a military ring to it.

237
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,107
But that was years ago.

238
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,406
And were your studies <i>as</i> disciplined?

239
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:22,405
Algebra, geometry, the natural sciences.

240
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:26,001
And for the sake of decorum,
ecclesiastical history.

241
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:30,624
I believe all women should have
the same educational advantages as men.

242
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,502
But ecclesiastical history?

243
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,795
It sounds as dreary as Paradise.

244
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,755
We brought her home.

245
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,804
Did you dislike Mount Holyoke so much?

246
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:42,884
She was bullied there.

247
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,933
There's bullying and there's coercion.

248
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:46,721
And which did you suffer?

249
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,565
A unique combination of both.

250
00:21:48,566 --> 00:21:53,770
- It was appalling.
- Yes, but... it puts iron in the soul.

251
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:58,948
But what is the point of that when,
in the end, we are all extinguished?

252
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:02,237
- Do you fear death?
- No.

253
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,030
But I fear Heaven.

254
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,617
I'm afraid it will seem like an anticlimax.

255
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,494
Perfection usually does.

256
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:13,206
- (Laughing)
- And what of Hell?

257
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,751
I'm sure that will be even duller
than Heaven.

258
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,925
That will be the agony.

259
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,269
Will you go with us to church,
Miss Buffam?

260
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,845
Of course not.

261
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,311
Going to church is like going to Boston.

262
00:22:29,312 --> 00:22:32,185
You only enjoy it
after you've gotten home.

263
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:35,108
We are to pray for the repose
of our late pastor's soul.

264
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,648
Doesn't that rather depend
on where it's gone?

265
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,525
<i>(Laughing)</i>

266
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,819
We shall become fast friends.

267
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,864
Of course we shall. I'm irresistible.

268
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,955
<i>- (Giggles)
- Everyone says so.</i>

269
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:51,248
When the new pastor does arrive,
you must point him out to me.

270
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:53,213
So that you, too, may be saved?

271
00:22:53,214 --> 00:22:54,706
No.

272
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,835
So that I will know whom to avoid.

273
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,680
Don't enjoy your praying too much.

274
00:23:05,681 --> 00:23:07,969
It might become habit-forming.

275
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,018
<i>(Birdsong)</i>

276
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:19,606
- Do you come to God, sir?
- We do, sir.

277
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,701
Do you come humbly, sir?

278
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,862
I come as myself, Pastor.

279
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,532
You want to come to Christ <i>as</i> a lawyer?

280
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,165
You need to come <i>as</i> a poor sinner.

281
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,048
Get down on your knees
and let me pray for you.

282
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,299
And then you can pray for yourself.

283
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,522
- And you, Miss Dickinson. What of you?
- What of me, sir?

284
00:23:55,523 --> 00:23:58,019
Will you not kneel
and give yourself to God?

285
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,939
No, sir, I will not kneel.

286
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,944
Though I think that God has
already given Himself to me.

287
00:24:03,945 --> 00:24:07,153
- That was profane.
- It was not meant so, sir.

288
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,324
- Do you guard your soul, Emily?
- As best as I am able, sir.

289
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:13,242
And Hell? What Of Hell?

290
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:17,043
Avoid it if I can. Endure it if I must.

291
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:24,222
- That was irreligious, young lady.
- Then I beg God's pardon for my impiety.

292
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,773
Let us pray for all sinners.

293
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,813
How dare you conduct yourself
in such a manner?

294
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,942
It is both unchristian and unseemly!

295
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:45,984
I will not be forced to piety!

296
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:49,114
- You will do as you are instructed.
- (Sighs)

297
00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:52,583
I know your Christian shore is safer,
Father.

298
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:59,622
And I know I must seem recalcitrant,
but my soul is my own.

299
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,423
Your soul is God's!
You neglect it at your peril.

300
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,966
- Yes, Father.
- And in future,

301
00:25:07,967 --> 00:25:11,219
you will conduct yourself in a manner
that is befitting the station in life

302
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,141
to which it has pleased God
to call you.

303
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,734
Yes, Father.

304
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,785
Goodnight, Emily.

305
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,243
Goodnight, Father.

306
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,755
This plate is dirty.

307
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,266
It is dirty no longer.

308
00:25:57,347 --> 00:26:00,308
I wouldn't have gone that far.

309
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:04,687
I had, Father would have packed me off
to a good military school

310
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:08,649
and Mother would have tearfully
embroidered something.

311
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,570
Ah. The eternal Miss Buffam.

312
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:17,241
Alas, no, sir.
Father Time knocks at my door also.

313
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,535
And what precautions do you take?

314
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,085
I contrive never to be at home
when he calls.

315
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,127
All women should aspire
to that state of readiness.

316
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:30,713
No. Women should only aspire to be
younger than their waistlines.

317
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:35,176
Then the unpleasant topic of age
becomes almost irrelevant.

318
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,521
(Chuckles)
And what should men aspire to?

319
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,306
Tobogganing.

320
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,308
And in warmer weather?

321
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:47,522
Philately. It has all the dangers of sport
without any of the rigour.

322
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:52,151
<i>(Chuckles)Your banter, Miss Buffam,
is, as</i> always, <i>delightful.</i>

323
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:56,999
Take it, Mr Dickinson, as the mere
outpourings of a poor, tormented soul.

324
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,959
Ladies.

325
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:04,920
- Now you go too far.
- We were trying to be ironic.

326
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,055
<i>- (Knock at door)
- Come 'm.</i>

327
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,891
- Will you come to church, Emily?
- No, Father.

328
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,562
- Why will you not come?
- God knows what is in my heart.

329
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,861
He doesn't require me to be in a pew
to remind Him.

330
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:33,782
I hope that remark
isn't as frivolous as it sounds.

331
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,280
Your soul is no trivial matter.

332
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,574
I agree, Father.

333
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:43,205
That's why I'm so meticulous
in guarding its independence.

334
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,800
<i>(Emily) I reckon</i> - <i>when I count out all</i> -

335
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:58,926
<i>First</i> - <i>poets</i> - <i>then the sun</i> -

336
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,181
<i>Then summer - then the Heaven of God</i>

337
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,313
<i>And then</i> - <i>the list is done</i> -

338
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:11,898
<i>But, looking back - the first so seems</i>
- <i>To comprehend the whole</i> -

339
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:17,030
<i>The others look a needless show -
So I write - poets - all -</i>

340
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:21,741
<i>Their summer</i> - <i>lasts a solid year</i> -

341
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:25,995
<i>They can afford a sun
The East - would deem extravagant-</i>

342
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:30,583
<i>And if the further heaven -
Be beautiful as they prepare</i>

343
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,502
<i>For those who worship them</i> -

344
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:38,304
<i>It is too difficult a grace</i>

Yes. And superficiality

363
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,925
Men are supposed to be fearless,

In war, yes. In religion, always.

I don't have a dance card, sir.
I prefer to... improvise.

Did you say something to him
to shock him?

384
00:31:43,198 --> 00:31:46,413
Only that I'd just finished reading
Wuthering Heights.

385
00:31:46,414 --> 00:31:48,280
And he was scandalized.

386
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,491
- Had he read it?
- No.

387
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,621
So I told him that to condemn
a novel he had not read

388
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:55,839
would be like going
to Sodom or Gomorrah

389
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,586
and being disappointed
that neither were Philadelphia.

390
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,346
I hope he had the presence
of mind to laugh.

391
00:32:03,347 --> 00:32:04,797
He didn't.

392
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:09,645
He went very silent and the air became
charged with unspoken profanity.

393
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,013
It was delicious.

394
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:17,190
Now, I must go. Miss Buffam has a tryst.

395
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,939
- That sounds sinful.
- Hm.

396
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:27,820
I was told once, by a clergyman,
that I should repent my sins,

397
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:30,823
otherwise I would be pursued
by the Devil.

398
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:35,411
"Oh, a sort of spiritual Wells Fargo,"
I said.

399
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:38,962
He promptly went silent,
like patience on a monument.

400
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:41,375
Appalled but dumb.

401
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,175
For the lost soul,
there will be no tomorrow.

402
00:32:44,176 --> 00:32:47,339
For the lost soul, today is quite enough.

Oh, I shall miss you if you ever go.

404
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,511
Your honesty is sublime.

405
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:56,182
In the long term,
honesty is not the best policy.

406
00:32:56,183 --> 00:33:00,311
- Is dishonesty?
- I prefer to call it diplomacy.

407
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:03,942
That way, one can turn a tactical defeat
into a victory.

408

- Who proposed that?
- Oh, I don't know.

crossing the Delaware. The wrong way.

00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,602
Fort Sumter has been fired upon.

519
00:41:52,603 --> 00:41:54,595
What does this mean?

520
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,017
It is thought that
the South will secede from the Union.

521
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,107
Then it means civil war.

522
00:42:02,108 --> 00:42:04,730
Does this mean you will be drafted,
Austin?

523
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,529
Almost certainly.

524
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,360
You will remain here.

525
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,705
But, Father, my friends will fight.
I cannot stay at home.

526
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:17,202
I will pay the $500 bond so that
a substitute may fight in your place.

527
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:18,894
What about my honour, sir?

528
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:22,082
Your honour, sir, will
be safe in my hands.

529
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,082
And my conscience, Father?
What of that?

530
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:28,964
It will be best if your conscience
found solace in you doing your filial duty.

531
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:33,681
For those who will die in this civil war,
"filial duty" will seem like cowardice.

532
00:42:33,682 --> 00:42:35,804
No young man of breeding
would make such a remark.

533
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:37,976
No gentleman would provoke it!

534
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,609
<i>- (Sighs deeply)
- Austin.</i>

535
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,106
You are my only son.

536
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,119
I cannot see your life put at risk.

537
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,821
Please, Father, don't make me stay.

538
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,917
You are not to go! I forbid it!

539
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,502
<i>(Sighs)</i>

540
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,755
I will remain here.

541
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:27,896
<i>(Emily) To fight aloud, is very brave -
But gallanter, I know</i>

542
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:32,277
<i>Who charge within the bosom
The Cavalry of Woe</i> -

543
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:37,114
<i>Who win, and nations do not see -</i>

544
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:40,659
<i>Who fall</i> - <i>and none observe</i> -

545
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,086
<i>Whose dying eyes, no Country
Regards with patriot love</i> -

546
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:52,263
<i>We trust, in plumed procession,
For such, the Angels go</i> -

547
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:59,594
<i>Rank after Rank, with even feet -
And Uniforms of snow.</i>

548
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,643
<i>(Gunfire)</i>

549
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,859
<i>(Emily) There is a word
Which bears a sword</i>

550
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,524
<i>Can pierce an armed man.</i>

551
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:17,372
<i>It hurls its barbed syllables,
- And once is mute again.</i>

552
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,283
<i>But where it fell
The saved will tell</i>

553
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,952
<i>On patriotic day,</i>

554
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:27,674
<i>Some epauletted brother
Gave his breath away</i>

555
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:33,262
<i>Wherever runs the breathless sun,
Wherever roams the day,</i>

556
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,221
<i>There is its noiseless onset,</i>

557
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,185
<i>There its victory!</i>

558
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,729
<i>(Austin) We went to Gettysburg
to hear the speeches.</i>

559
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,732
<i>Mr Edward Everett spoke
for nearly two hours.</i>

560
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:54,528
<i>- (Susan) Very rousing.
- (Emily) And the President's speech?</i>

561
00:44:54,529 --> 00:44:56,740
<i>(Austin) Mr Lincoln
was shocking in his brevity.</i>

562
00:44:56,741 --> 00:44:58,951
<i>He spoke for about three minutes.
Not memorable.</i>

563
00:44:58,952 --> 00:45:01,242
<i>(Vinnie) Were there many there
to hear the orations?</i>

564
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:04,995
- <i>(Susan) Some said fifteen thousand.
- (Emily sighs deeply)</i>

565
00:45:04,996 --> 00:45:06,938
<i>(Austin) Most of them
looking for breakfast,</i>

566
00:45:06,963 --> 00:45:08,794
<i>or trying to find
souvenirs of the battle.</i>

567
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:10,757
<i>Macabre.</i>

568
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,677
They say that over
six hundred thousand men have perished.

569
00:45:16,678 --> 00:45:18,882
And for what?

570
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:23,476
To end slavery, which should never have
flourished in this country in the first place.

571
00:45:23,477 --> 00:45:26,268
Miss Buffam has had
too great an influence over you, Emily.

572
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:29,768
If more men were as outspoken <i>as</i>
Miss Buffam, we may not have had a war.

573
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:35,065
How dare you trivialize it in that way?
The conflict was not about gender.

574
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:39,158
Any argument about gender is war,
because that, too, is slavery.

575
00:45:39,159 --> 00:45:43,076
- That's a contemptible thing to say.
- Live as a woman for a week, Austin.

576
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:45,918
You will find it neither
congenial nor trivial.

577
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,552
So you leave tomorrow?

578
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,052
How long will you be gone?

579
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,976
Two months, maybe.

580
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:11,768
Both cases are difficult,
and both are being tried by Judge Lord.

581
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,897
- And you know how fierce he can be.
- (Clock chimes)

582
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,984
- Must you go for such a length of time?
- Yes.

583
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:23,863
A man must make his way in the world.
He can't be merely decorous.

584
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,834
And a woman? What should she do?

585
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,330
Or is she destined
only for decorousness?

586
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:32,798
- <i>Let's not argue.
- (Clock strikes nine)</i>

587
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,631
Not on my last night at home.

588
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,840
I'll write.

589
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,637
- It'll ease my unhappiness.
- But increase mine.

590
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,548
<i>(Door opens)</i>

591
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,847
What are you doing at this hour?

592
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,272
It is my time for writing.

593
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,854
Between three am and morning.

594
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,728
My father allows it.

595
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,772
No husband would.

596
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,491
I came over.

597
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,569
- I thought something was amiss.
- No.

598
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,618
It is the best time,

599
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:51,701
when it feels
as if the whole world is asleep and still.

600
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,249
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

601
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:01,045
Why did you take so long
to consent to marry Austin?

602
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,809
In truth...

603
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,024
the thought of men in
that particular respect...

604
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,028
turned me to stone.

605
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,699
Although Austin is...

606
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,412
very tender...

607
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,461
and yielding to my...

608
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,752
reservations.

609
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:47,554
Is that particular part of married life
so terrible?

610
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,099
I do my duty.

611
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,147
<i>(Sighs)</i>

612
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:01,071
But I have not only gained
a husband,

613
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:06,818
but two sisters also.

614
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,154
Yes.

615
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,156
We will be sisters.

616
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:15,827
And we shall share and read everything.

617
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,954
The Brontés.

618
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,832
George Eliot.

619
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,501
And, Heaven save us, Mrs Gaskell also.

620
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,550
<i>(Both laugh)</i>

621
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,514
And you have your poetry.

622
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,488
But you have a life.

623
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,237
I have a routine.

624
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,331
It is God's one concession
to a no-hoper.

625
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,159
Does nothing give you solace?

626
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,004
For those of us who live minor lives,

627
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,224
and are deprived of...

628
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,188
a particular kind of love,

629
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,522
we know best how to starve.

630
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:33,573
We deceive ourselves, and then others.

631
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,748
It is the worst kind of lie.

632
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,561
But in matters of the soul...

633
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,108
you are rigorous.

634
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:10,363
Rigour is no substitute for happiness.

635
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:18,199
<i>(Pastor) Oh, what a call is this?</i>

636
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,413
<i>The dear ones, whose names are written
in the Lamb's Book of Life,</i>

637
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:27,083
<i>cry "Come, come!"</i>

638
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:32,466
<i>And the church below, Christ's witness
unto the world and the church above,</i>

639
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,176
<i>with the rustling of the white robes,</i>

640
00:51:35,177 --> 00:51:37,802
<i>and the sweeping of the golden harps,</i>

641
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,898
cries "Come, come!"

642
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:48,649
<i>And the angels of Heaven, lo! Rank
above rank, immortal principalities,</i>

643
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:52,734
<i>as they circle the eternal throne.</i>

644
00:51:52,735 --> 00:52:00,620
<i>They have caught up the sound,
and cry "Come, come!"</i>

645
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:06,331
Reverend Wadsworth's sermons
take the breath away!

646
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:09,584
That kind of religious ecstasy
is wonderful,

647
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:11,804
but back in the quiet of one's own room,

648
00:52:11,805 --> 00:52:14,297
it seems <i>as</i> remote as Spitsbergen.

649
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:17,967
Still, he is as handsome
as he is ecstatic.

650
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,763
And he is so clean.
Like a cherub after bathing.

651
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,848
And happily married.

652
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:28,776
(Sighs)Ah, to be betrothed
without the swoon.

653
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,564
But a person may hope.

654
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,035
If you're too quick to hope,
you'll always be disappointed.

655
00:52:35,036 --> 00:52:38,863
And if I am too quick to despair,
what then?

656
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,741
Then you will be too slow to hope.

657
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:45,079
I set too much store by friendships.

658
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,506
When we lose friends to death,
that is the most profound loss.

659
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:57,050
When we lose them to marriage, the grief
is subtler, but just as keenly felt.

660
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:05,688
We cannot keep the world, or life,
at bay, Emily. Neither can we ignore it.

661
00:53:05,689 --> 00:53:10,144
We can do better than that.
We can be vigilant against it.

662
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,318
But when that vigil is over, what then?

663
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:17,902
Eternity. And in that place,
no loss is felt.

664
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,071
But what of the kingdom to come?

665
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:24,794
That may be a gain,
but only after the fact.

666
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:29,628
One day, you may marry.

667
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,168
I think not.

668
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,046
You and Austin are the handsome ones.

669
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,716
I am a kangaroo amongst the beauties.

670
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:44,554
(Chuckles) No! You have
a lovely face and a fine soul.

671
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:49,479
Then let us hope the man who courts me
will have an interest in zoology...

672
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,945
- and all things spiritual.
- (Chuckles)

673
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,941
Let us invite the Reverend Wadsworth
to tea.

674
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,946
<i>And Mrs Wadsworth. (Chuckles)</i>

675
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,449
<i>(sighs deeply)</i> Very well.

676
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:07,290
And you must promise me you'll behave.

677
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,496
I know how provocative you can be.

678
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,545
I will muster all the dignity I can.

679
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,344
That's what I'm afraid of.

680
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:17,884
<i>(Door closes)</i>

681
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,800
Will you take coffee, Mrs Wadsworth?

682
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,511
Er, tea, then?

683
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,516
No, thank you.
Mrs Wadsworth is an abstainer.

684
00:54:28,517 --> 00:54:31,142
I thought abstention was only for alcohol.

685
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:33,521
For me, it extends to tea, also.

686
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:42,653
They say the Chinese drink tea
for remedial purposes.

687
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,783
I'm glad to say that I'm not Chinese.

688
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,955
Some lemonade, then?

689
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,254
Surely God would not
disapprove of lemonade?

690
00:54:55,255 --> 00:55:01,053
Levity and the will of God are, I think,
incompatible. Almost improper.

691
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,810
Just plain water would be pleasant.

692
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,013
Reverend Wadsworth?

693
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,893
Just a cup of hot water for me, thank you.

694
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:58,739
I understand from Vinnie
that you are a poet?

695
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,899
I write verses, yes.

696
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,402
<i>(Reverend Wadsworth)
And what</i> of <i>your contemporaries?</i>

697
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:06,451
Mr Longfellow, for instance.

698
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,704
His genius lies in stating the obvious.

699
00:56:09,705 --> 00:56:14,370
Oh, that is too harsh.
There are many fine things in Hiawatha.

700
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,708
I'm sorry I was cruel.
But, madam, I must say in truth,

701
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:23,306
Hiawatha is but gruel.
Read just one stanza for the proof.

702
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,092
No.

703
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:32,348
Give me something pressed
from truth, and that is poetry.

704
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,892
I suppose you feel the Brontés do that?

705
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,853
Yes. And a few others.

706
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:42,233
(Mrs Wadsworth)What do you find
in all that Yorkshire gloom?

707
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:47,653
The beauty of truth.
The poetry of the known.

708
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,869
But why can't they dwell
on something wholesome?

709
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:54,041
If they wished to be wholesome,
I would imagine they would crochet.

710
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:03,630
Would you like to take a turn
in our garden?

711
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,049
No, thank you.

712
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,051
I find this heat oppressive.

713
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,555
But Charles loves to be out of doors.

714
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,057
I myself prefer the shade.

715
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:19,101
In that case, I will take the liberty

716
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,197
of escorting your husband
around our modest garden.

717
00:57:22,198 --> 00:57:25,659
And my sister
can have you all to herself.

718
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,296
More water?

719
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,759
Thank you for your invitation,
Miss Dickinson.

720
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:58,272
I was very moved by your sermon, sir,
and wanted very much to tell you.

721
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:11,618
This is all I have to give in return.

722
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,221
Please say something.

723
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,850
Does my poetry have any worth?

724
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,189
They are remarkable.

725
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,616
Uncompromising, yes,
but this is wonderful poetry.

726
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,113
How many have been published?

727
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,491
Seven.

728
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,244
Eleven?

729
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,079
I cannot recall.

730
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,624
- And no more?
- And no more.

731
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,667
How can you be so stoic?

732
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:52,093
It's easy to be stoic when no one
wants what you have to offer.

733
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:57,095
There is, I suppose, always posterity.

734
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:01,186
But posterity is as comfortless <i>as</i> God.

735
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,100
That sounds like despair.

736
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,149
No, it's bitterness.

737
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:09,146
Besides...

738
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:12,367
a posthumous reputation
is only for those who, when living,

739
01:00:12,368 --> 01:00:14,327
weren't worth remembering.

740
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,869
Still... Ah!

741
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,706
To be racked by success!

742
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,089
But I would like some approval
before I die.

743
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:36,757
<i>(Emily) If you were coming in the fall,
I'd brush the summer by</i>

744
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:41,184
<i>With half a smile and half a spurn,
As housewives do a fly.</i>

745
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:47,101
<i>If I could see you in</i> a <i>year,
I'd wind the months in balls,</i>

746
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:51,482
<i>And put them each in separate drawers,
Until their time befalls.</i>

747
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:57,236
<i>If only centuries delayed,
Pd count them on my hand,</i>

748
01:00:57,237 --> 01:01:02,283
<i>Subtracting till my fingers dropped
Into Van Diemen's land.</i>

749
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:08,337
If certain, when this life was out,
That yours and mine should be,

750
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:14,923
<i>I'd toss it yonder like</i> a <i>rind,
And taste eternity.</i>

751
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:23,602
But now, all ignorant of the length
Of time's uncertain wing,

752
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:31,363
It goads me, like the goblin bee,
That will not state its sting.

753
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,318
I must have someone
with a sense of humour,

754
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,820
someone who can laugh at the world.

755
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:43,949
Taking life seriously
is the shortest route to disaster.

756
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,076
And have you found such a one?

757
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:48,537
Someone has found me.

758
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:52,208
A Mr Wilder, a Professor of Mathematics.

759
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:56,680
And if he can find comedy
in a vulgar fraction, I'm his.

760
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,842
- But do you love him?
- Love? I cannot say.

761
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:05,973
It's a very beguiling idea.
They even say it exists.

762
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,518
But how will you know?

763
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:15,147
What if you make an error?

764
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,489
If he is a bad choice,
I'll have him killed quietly

765
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:22,786
and tell everyone he died of some sort
of algebraic shock. (Chuckles)

766
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,075
I hope you will be happy.

767
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:31,163
That cannot be guaranteed.
I'll settle for consideration.

768
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:35,292
- That sounds like surrender.
- No, it's practicality.

769
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:39,713
And who knows?
Perhaps love will come in its wake.

770
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:44,260
- Then I can relax into smugness.
- You could never be smug.

771
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:49,479
Life catches you out, Emily. In the end,
we all become the thing we most dread.

772
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,354
Then I will reject the world
and not fulfill that prophecy.

773
01:02:53,355 --> 01:02:56,275
Then you will be making
the greatest of mistakes,

774
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:59,823
for you will deny yourself
what your spirit needs most.

775
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:05,406
- And what is that?
- Truth. And experience.

776
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,160
Otherwise,
your vow will be an act of cowardice.

777
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:11,789
- That was hurtful.
- But honest.

778
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:18,085
Don't resist your vices, Emily.
It is your virtues you should be wary of.

779
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:22,842
Austin once told Aunt Elizabeth that our
virtues are just vices in disguise.

780
01:03:22,843 --> 01:03:24,887
Now, there is a man
with a <i>sense</i> of humour.

781
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:27,262
And does your Mr Wilder possess one?

782
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:31,140
Of a kind.
He proposed to me by letter,

783
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:34,987
so if the marriage is unhappy,
I shall blame the US mail.

784
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,564
Always conform.

785
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:41,692
Keep disobedience secret.

786
01:03:41,693 --> 01:03:46,868
Be outwardly docile, but in your heart,
you can be as revolutionary as you like.

787
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:49,744
- But isn't that hypocrisy?
- Of course it is.

788
01:03:49,745 --> 01:03:52,286
But in America, we cherish it.

789
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:54,913
We think it makes us incorruptible.

790
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,917
You must never confuse
the outer with the inner piety.

791
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,545
Only Episcopalians do that.

792
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:06,467
But I am rebellious
and far from the grace of God.

793
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,846
You are closer to Him
than anyone I know.

794
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:16,187
Always look below the surface, Emily,
but don't be afraid of what you find there.

795
01:04:16,188 --> 01:04:18,905
- Chaos?
- Yes.

796
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,778
Then I shall confront everything.

797
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:29,702
Don't be too radical, Emily.
Radicals don't thrive in this country.

798
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:33,420
- But you are a radical.
- But I'll eventually conform.

799
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:36,335
For the sake of peace or a quiet life.

800
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:41,928
But I know that you will not,
and I envy you your courage.

801
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,719
I suppose you shall carry lovely flowers

802
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:53,269
and have Mr Mendelssohn's
"Wedding March".

803
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:58,227
Flowers, yes. Mendelssohn, no.

804
01:04:58,228 --> 01:05:02,195
Never play happy music at a wedding,
Emily, it's too misleading.

805
01:05:02,196 --> 01:05:06,320
- But you shall be forever gone from us.
- You make it sound like dying.

806
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:08,570
- Isn't it?
- No.

807
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:12,121
And even if it were, you must
force yourself to think otherwise.

808
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,208
America is the only country in the world

809
01:05:15,209 --> 01:05:18,127
that looks upon death
as some kind of personal failure.

810
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,923
May I get you something, Mother?

811
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,972
<i>No, Emily. (sighs)</i>

812
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,099
You've always seemed so sad, Mother.

813
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,439
<i>My fife has passed as if in a dream.</i>

814
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,569
As if I'd never been part of it.

815
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:54,199
After Vinnie was born,

816
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:59,923
a kind of melancholia settled over me
which I mistook for contentment.

817
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:05,091
Were we such a terrible price to pay?

818
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,548
No!

819
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:12,264
I wouldn't be without all three of you.

820
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,727
To have my children about me...

821
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:20,267
there could be no better medicine.

822
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:22,316
<i>(Clock chimes)</i>

823
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:27,609
Sometimes...

824
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,072
at a certain hour...

825
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:39,244
when the sun is low...

826
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,543
the shadows lengthen...

827
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:49,889
(Sobs) I am filled
with such a sense of longing.

828
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:55,770
(Sobs)I feel such a weight on my heart.

829
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:00,891
Oh, how it aches.

830
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:03,065
<i>(Sobs)</i>

831
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:09,107
Oh, my dear.

832
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:12,612
(Sobs) Oh, my dear.

833
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:16,156
There, my lamb. There.

834
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,205
<i>(Weeping)</i>

835
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:20,996
Oh!

836
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,801
Reverend Wadsworth
has sailed for San Francisco.

837
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:39,515
They all go. They all leave.

838
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:41,974
They all desert you.

839
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,478
Do not touch me!

840
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:49,314
I will not be pitied.
It makes me feel repulsive.

841
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,909
You set too much store
by physical beauty, Emily.

842
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:56,154
The only people who can be sanguine
about not being handsome

843
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,453
are those who are beautiful already.

844
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,207
The rest of us have only our envy
to keep us warm.

845
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:06,170
- You have an exquisite nature.
- What's the use of that in this world?

846
01:08:06,171 --> 01:08:09,044
I sometimes think
you are too harsh with yourself.

847
01:08:09,045 --> 01:08:12,754
I have many defects.
There is much to rectify!

848
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:15,224
It is just as punitive
to admit to too many faults

849
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:17,676
as it is to deny too few virtues.

850
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:20,226
The Reverend Wadsworth
is a married man.

851
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,065
This kind of attachment is improper.

852
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:32,566
We can't all possess your smug rectitude.

853
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:33,984
Don't sneer at anyone's morals

854
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:36,033
when your own could do with
some little correction.

855
01:08:36,034 --> 01:08:38,498
By that, I assume
you mean Reverend Wadsworth?

856
01:08:38,499 --> 01:08:40,324
He's married!

857
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:41,827
You should not attach yourself

858
01:08:41,828 --> 01:08:45,205
to someone who is not free
to return that attachment!

859
01:08:45,206 --> 01:08:48,174
You hardly know the man,
except through his sermons.

860
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:53,509
Besides, he and Mrs Wadsworth
are very happy.

861
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:56,265
She has led a blameless life.

862
01:08:56,266 --> 01:09:00,927
She hasn't led a life at all!
She's too inert for that.

863
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:04,853
If docility were love,
we would all live happily ever after.

864
01:09:04,854 --> 01:09:07,601
She's a good wife!

865
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:11,776
And, to be truthful, I have never understood
the attraction of her husband for you.

866
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:15,869
He is hardly a Mr Rochester,
and you are certainly not Jane Eyre!

867
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,668
That was unkind.

868
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,373
I'm sorry, too.

869
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,166
You're not smug.

870
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,420
But I do sermonize.

871
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,224
And I do over-dramatize.

872
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:44,898
But it was news that was...
is hard to bear.

873
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:50,028
Oh, you are a wretched creature!

874
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:54,570
Will you never achieve anything?

875
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,659
<i>(Sobs)</i>

876
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:07,921
<i>(Emily) We outgrow love like other things
And put it in the drawer,</i>

877
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:15,671
<i>Till it an antique fashion shows
Like costumes grandsires wore.</i>

878
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:20,058
(Pastor) May the Lord
make His face shine upon you

879
01:10:20,059 --> 01:10:22,968
and be gracious unto you.

880
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:27,850
May the Lord lift up His countenance
unto you and give you peace.

881
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,167
We wish you
all the happiness in the world.

882
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,040
No tears, Emily.

883
01:10:54,041 --> 01:10:56,089
No tears.

884
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,446
- Will you come?
- No.

885
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,703
Wave her my goodbye.

886
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:39,961
<i>(Emily) The dying need but little, dear -
A glass of water's all,</i>

887
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:43,967
<i>A flower's unobtrusive face
To punctuate the wall,</i>

888
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:50,806
<i>A fan, perhaps, a friend's regret,
And certainly that one</i>

889
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:54,903
<i>No colour in the rainbow
Perceives when you are gone.</i>

890
01:11:55,937 --> 01:12:01,159
<i>Look back on time with kindly eyes,
He doubtless did his best;</i>

891
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:08,371
<i>How softly sinks his trembling sun
In human nature's west!</i>

892
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,580
<i>(Sobbing)</i>

893
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,619

895
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:21,948
<i>(Emily) Of so divine a loss
We enter but the gain,</i>

896
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:28,197
<i>Indemnity for loneliness
That such a bliss has been.</i>

897
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:48,298
<i>If we reach into the silence
then we cannot be afraid,</i>

898
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:52,429
<i>for where there is nothing, there is God.</i>

899
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,575
Emily?

900
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,833
Emily?

901
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:18,834
You must eat.

902
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:22,133
You must come down now.

903
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,963
It's been three days.

904
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:35,346
You are wearing white.

905
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,057
Yes.

906
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:41,982
But we're still in mourning.

907
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:45,940
So am I.

908
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:53,613
Emily? It's Mr Bowles.

909
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,538
He's come to Amherst
specially to see you.

910
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,503
Well, come down, damn you.

911
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,599
I refuse to speak to someone
who's a flight of stairs above me.

912
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:15,385
Forgive me, sir, if I'm frightened.

913
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:18,265
I never see anyone
and I hardly know what to say.

914
01:15:18,266 --> 01:15:22,144
You could say thank you
for my publishing some of your verse.

915
01:15:22,145 --> 01:15:25,898
For that, sir, you have more than
my thanks. You have my gratitude.

916
01:15:25,899 --> 01:15:28,149
But, sir...

917
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,569
you have altered
some of my punctuation.

918
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:36,698
Good Lord. What's a hyphen here
or a semi-colon there?

919
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,742
To many, nothing.

920
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:43,249
But, to me, the alteration of my
punctuation marks is very hard to endure.

921
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,999
Then I apologise.

922
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,630
I was merely trying to make
your meaning clearer to my readers.

923
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:53,724
Clarity is one thing, sir,
obviousness quite another.

924
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:59,810
The only person qualified to interfere
with the poet's work is the poet herself.

925
01:15:59,811 --> 01:16:02,182
From anyone else, it feels like an attack.

926
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:06,352
Miss Dickinson,
this is no way to speak or behave.

927
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:10,574
If you treated a suitor like this,
he would not return.

928
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:15,280
- Are you sure there will be one?
- Of course.

929
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:18,912
Even for someone
as hard to please <i>as</i> yourself.

930
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,619
Well, if he does come,

931
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:27,294
he will have to be as spectacular
as Disraeli and as sincere as Gladstone.

932
01:16:27,295 --> 01:16:29,635
And as upright <i>as</i> George Washington?

933
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:34,423
<i>- George who'?
- (Laughs)</i>

934
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,180
<i>(Birdsong)</i>

935
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:42,982
<i>(Sighs)</i>

936
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:57,538
<i>(Gasping)</i>

937
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:02,501
<i>(Breathing heavily)</i>

938
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,340
<i>(Birdsong)</i>

939
01:17:17,508 --> 01:17:19,008
Emily?

940
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,057
Mr Emmons is coming to see us.

941
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,517
Our beautiful friend?

942
01:17:27,518 --> 01:17:30,021
- Will you come down?
- No.

943
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:34,283
This is discourteous.
Why will you not come down and meet him?

944
01:17:34,284 --> 01:17:38,236
Because he is so beautiful,
and I am not beautiful enough.

945
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:41,411
He's read some of your published poems
and admires them.

946
01:17:41,412 --> 01:17:43,867
Admiration always <i>masks</i> envy.

947
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:45,827
What does envy mask?

948
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:48,707
Oh, that masks admiration.

949
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,794
He may come to the foot of the stairs.

950
01:17:53,878 --> 01:17:56,597
<i>- Miss Dickinson?
- (Emily) Yes.</i>

951
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:01,436
- I cannot see you.
- That, sir, is no matter.

952
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:07,275
(Chuckles) It is the first time
I've conducted a visit in this fashion.

953
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:13,646
It seems unfair that you can see me
but I can only hear you.

954
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:18,323
That can be no hardship, sir,
for I am best heard and not seen.

955
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,365
Er... Will you take a ride
with Vinnie and me?

956
01:18:22,366 --> 01:18:26,743
I do not cross my father's ground
to any house or town.

957
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:29,748
That seems such a shame,
especially in such lovely weather.

958
01:18:29,749 --> 01:18:33,877
The weather will remain lovely
whether I drive through it or not.

959
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:38,969
Then I wish you good day,
Miss Dickinson.

960
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,933
Good day, Mr Emmons.

961
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:48,482
<i>(Emily) He will mount the stairs

962
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,487

Oh, Emily, you should have come -
it was radiant.

993
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:22,752
Yes. And I'm sure you would have
made it even more radiant, Miss Emily.

994
01:23:22,753 --> 01:23:27,215
Ridicule is not the way to
any woman's heart, sir. Least of all mine.

995
01:23:27,216 --> 01:23:28,925
(Mr Emmons)
It was meant sincerely.

996
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:31,470
Or should I judge beauty
by the common standard?

997
01:23:31,471 --> 01:23:36,886
Any standard may be common.
Familiarity, as they say, breeds contempt.

998
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:39,722
Perhaps contempt breeds familiarity.

999
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:42,522
At any rate,
beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

1000
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:47,775
That is no longer true, sir.
For that truism has become a cliché.

1001
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:52,822
Miss Dickinson,
you are just a little too sharp.

1002
01:23:52,823 --> 01:23:55,947
And you, sir, are a little too quick
to play the martyr.

1003
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,542
Then I'll take my leave
before any blood is spilt.

1004
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:02,212
There are wounds which do not bleed,

1005
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:07,918
but which aggrieve nonetheless.

1006
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:13,598
I just assumed that you wanted
to be rid of me. I meant no injury.

1007
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:18,888
Nor did I, sir. I only wish to be honest.

1008
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:25,935
May I call again?

1009
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:29,814
If it gives you no pleasure,
what is the point?

1010
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,489
I had hoped that my company
wouldn't be a burden.

1011
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:35,613
A burden can always be laid down, sir.

1012
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:39,249
You are not required
to be another Sisyphus.

1013
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:48,958
<i>(Door closes)</i>

1014
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:52,429
Oh, Emily, why do you behave like this?

1015
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:57,300
He is a kind man and he was hurt.

1016
01:24:57,301 --> 01:24:59,429
I don't know.

1017
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:03,849
As soon <i>as</i> they get too close,
I feel as if I'm suffocating.

1018
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,813
I long for... something.

1019
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:13,482
But I am afraid of it.

1020
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:18,237
A man may love and then cool,
but it is not that way with me.

1021
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,573
But you cannot be equal to a man.

1022
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:23,703
If I cannot have equality,
then I want nothing of love.

1023
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:27,377
I will not be so confined
that I cannot breathe.

1024
01:25:27,378 --> 01:25:31,208
But a rebellious spirit
invites only retribution.

1025
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:34,295
Then I will be silent in my rebellion,

1026
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:36,845
so that no one will know
what my true feelings are.

1027
01:25:36,846 --> 01:25:41,010
- God will know.
- But I will not be married to God.

1028
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:44,140
But you are His possession
and answerable to Him.

1029
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:49,315
He will know of my struggle
and be merciful.

1030
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:53,986
And if He does not exist,

1031
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:57,619
then I will be eternally free.

Diuretics and laxatives

Well, thank you.
She's taking tea with Mabel.

1145
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:31,603
Ah, Mrs Todd. And her dull narcissism.

1146
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:36,071
You mistake confidence for narcissism,
and womanly reticence for dullness.

1147
01:42:36,072 --> 01:42:38,320
Whatever else can be said of Mrs Todd,

1148
01:42:38,321 --> 01:42:41,034
no one could ever accuse her
of reticence.

1149
01:42:41,035 --> 01:42:43,499
Or does one only
require reticence in a wife?

1150
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:46,711
- My wife is perfectly happy.
- Yes, of course.

1151
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:51,375
I'm sure she sees infidelity,
when accompanied by Schubert,

1152
01:42:51,376 --> 01:42:53,375
as a delightful pastime.

1153
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:55,047
A kind of musical adultery.

1154
01:42:55,048 --> 01:42:57,923
Real artists cannot be confined
by narrow convention.

1155
01:42:57,924 --> 01:43:01,883
Real artists don't deceive themselves
or their public.

1156

When you have any public to speak of,

1157
01:43:03,636 --> 01:43:06,856
I'm sure your reputation
will no doubt be very secure.

1158
01:43:06,857 --> 01:43:09,849
In all this, Susan is the innocent party.

1159
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,393
If you take the trouble to look,

1160
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:13,817
you'd see there is more to that innocence
than meets the eye.

1161
01:43:13,818 --> 01:43:16,189
That is a despicable thing to say!

1162
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:18,158
Oh, stop bickering!

1163
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:28,912
My sympathies are entirely with Susan.

1164
01:43:30,287 --> 01:43:34,582
If she had a liaison with a married man,
how would you respond?

1165
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:37,127
I would not forgive her.

1166
01:43:37,128 --> 01:43:39,462
Yet you "admire" Mrs Todd.

1167
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:43,800
An admirable woman is one thing,
a wife quite another.

1168
01:43:43,801 --> 01:43:47,180
I don't think I've ever been this close
to despising you.

1169
01:43:47,181 --> 01:43:52,559
- Don't lecture me on how to live!
- And don't try to justify your position!

1170
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,858
It is both immoral and vicious.

1171
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:59,901
Susan is a good and intelligent wife.

1172
01:44:00,985 --> 01:44:03,862
Or do you prefer more obvious charms?

1173
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:06,284
By that I assume you mean
Mabel Loomis Todd?

1174
01:44:06,285 --> 01:44:11,663
Mrs Todd, yes. And don't tell me your
intentions toward her are merely fraternal!

1175
01:44:11,664 --> 01:44:14,006
Especially
in that semi-recumbent position!

1176
01:44:14,007 --> 01:44:18,042
Sometimes, Emily,
you are as ugly <i>as</i> your poetry!

1177

1181

She is incapable of making up her mind

1185
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:56,790
You lash out

01:44:56,791 --> 01:45:00,136
Your anger is, I think,
a defense against the world.

How can you go on loving me
when I don't deserve it?

1188
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:17,315
Because you are so easy to love.

1189

Oh, Vinnie.

1195
01:45:50,970 --> 01:45:55,473
Oh, Vinnie, if that is
the extent of your wickedness,

1196
01:45:55,474 --> 01:45:58,184
your sainthood is assured,

1197
01:45:58,185 --> 01:46:00,563
explosions notwithstanding.

1198
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:05,033
Try not to provoke him.

<i>(Sighs)</i>

1200
01:46:39,393 --> 01:46:43,897
Have you read this article
in the Springfield Republican, Emily?

1201
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:45,866
No. Why?

1202
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:49,821
It is by Mr Bowles,
who publishes some of your work.

1203
01:46:49,822 --> 01:46:52,071
And whom you admire, I think.

1204
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:54,240
And who is also married.

1205
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:56,701
What does it say?

1206
01:46:56,702 --> 01:46:59,287
"Why should we write?

1207
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:02,629
"There is another kind of writing,
only too common,

1208
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:05,253
"appealing to the sympathies
of the reader

1209
01:47:05,254 --> 01:47:08,796
"without recommending itself
to its subject.

1210
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:12,051
"It may be called the literature of misery.

1211
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:17,055
"The writers are chiefly women,
gifted women, maybe,

1212
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:19,891
"full of thought and feeling and fancy,

1213
01:47:19,892 --> 01:47:23,112
"but poor, lonely and unhappy.

1214
01:47:23,979 --> 01:47:27,279
"Also, such suffering
is so seldom healthful.

1215
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:30,820
"It may be a valuable discipline
in the end,

1216
01:47:30,821 --> 01:47:36,201
"but for the time being,
it too often clouds, withers, distorts.

1217
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:41,881
"It is so difficult to see objects
distinctly through a mist of tears.

1218
01:47:42,915 --> 01:47:45,088
"The sketch or poem is..."

1219
01:47:47,044 --> 01:47:48,762
That was cruel.

1220
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:53,517
- Life is cruel.
- And cruelty knows no morality.

1221
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:57,017
<i>(insects chirping)</i>

1222
01:48:16,156 --> 01:48:18,700
Are you all right?

1223
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:21,119
Austin was cruel.

1224
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:23,589
He was, I suppose,
defending his position.

1225
01:48:24,873 --> 01:48:27,843
Or should we call it
poetic licentiousness?

1226
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:33,891
I must confess, I cannot understand
his infatuation with her

1227
01:48:34,883 --> 01:48:36,759
when she already has a husband

1228
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:39,764
who should satisfy her
in every aspect of married life.

1229
01:48:42,016 --> 01:48:48,524
They say that with Mr Todd,
it is a venereal case.

1230
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:53,444
- How do you know this?
- There are rumours.

1231
01:48:54,945 --> 01:48:59,532
Perhaps now you can view Mabel
in a more favourable light.

1232
01:48:59,533 --> 01:49:01,581
I doubt that.

1233
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:06,294
Mrs Todd may have her private troubles,

1234
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:10,628
but it is no excuse for
Austin's infidelity.

1235
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:17,467
The brother I once adored has betrayed
Susan in the vilest way imaginable!

1236
01:49:17,468 --> 01:49:19,510
People are not saints, Emily.

1237
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:22,515
You judge too harshly
because you judge too highly.

1238
01:49:22,516 --> 01:49:25,518
Lowering a standard
is the first excuse for every villainy.

1239
01:49:25,519 --> 01:49:29,988
And keeping to one high principle
is the last refuge of the intolerant.

1240
01:49:29,989 --> 01:49:31,903
And what of integrity?

1241
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:36,069
Austin was once fierce
in his defense of it,

1242
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:40,656
and now it seems an encumbrance
to be easily put aside!

1243
01:49:40,657 --> 01:49:44,327
Integrity, if taken too far,
can be equally ruthless.

1244
01:49:44,328 --> 01:49:47,628
- And do I fit into that category?
- Sometimes, yes!

1245
01:50:08,393 --> 01:50:10,361
We're only human, Emily.

1246
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:13,449
Don't pillory us for that.

1247
01:50:21,573 --> 01:50:24,827
You're right. Of course.

1248
01:50:28,247 --> 01:50:30,466
I wish I had your gentle spirit.

1249
01:50:33,585 --> 01:50:35,587
If I castigate Austin,

1250
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:40,309
it is because
my own failings are equally as great.

1251
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,484
We become the very thing we dread,

1252
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:54,656
and I have become embittered.

1253
01:50:57,818 --> 01:51:00,162
Despite your vehemence,

1254
01:51:01,613 --> 01:51:05,834
you have a soul
anyone would be proud of.

1255
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:12,966
Oh, Vinnie. Vinnie.

Eternity by term.</i>
