1
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,657
(dice rattling)

2
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:32,741
Police, Mcbratney, let's
go, you're under arrest.

3
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:36,867
Police my butt, you're
John Gotti from Ozone Park.

4
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,117
Guess you are...

5
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:40,701
(grunting)

6
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:44,535
(gunshots)

7
00:00:48,494 --> 00:00:51,953
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, come on, come on!

8
00:01:28,665 --> 00:01:32,163
Welcome, Johnny,
congratulations.

9
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:33,331
Thank you, Neil.

10
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,581
(coughing)

11
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:39,248
You all right, Neil?

12
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:40,497
(coughing)

13
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,415
I'm okay, I'm okay.

14
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:45,790
You look better, Neil.

15
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,998
I'm gonna beat
this thing, Johnny.

16
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,540
Chemo, they got me on chemo now.

17
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,874
I'm gonna beat it.

18
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:59,583
You got to, Neil,
the family needs you.

19
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:01,458
(crowd murmuring agreement)

20
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:04,623
(laughing) Well, we
better get this thing over

21
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:08,666
before all these goombas fall
over from the BO in here.

22
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:12,210
(laughing)

23
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:20,710
(speaking Italian)

24
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:38,419
Johnny Joseph Gotti Junior,
will you rise.

25
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,504
Woman: State your name.

26
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:46,379
Diane Giacalone.

27
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,672
(speaking Italian)

28
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:59,588
I do.

29
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:04,088
(speaking Italian)

30
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:07,463
I solemnly swear that
I will support and defend

31
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:11,215
the Constitution of the
United States of America.

32
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:14,297
(speaking Italian)

33
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,256
To the family,
always to the family.

34
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:22,090
(speaking Italian)

35
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:24,799
In this time, Paul
Castellano is our leader.

36
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:26,174
May he live forever.

37
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:27,881
All: May he live forever.

38
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:30,340
And his right arm
is Neil Dellacroce.

39
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:31,758
May he live forever.

40
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:33,382
All: May he live forever.

41
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:36,633
Woman: Against all
enemies, foreign and domestic.

42
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:40,758
Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

43
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:43,550
This is the gun I live by.

44
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:47,801
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

45
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:49,593
This is the knife I die by.

46
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:50,926
Woman: So help me God.

47
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,550
So help me God.

48
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:56,176
On my life, and on the
lives of those dear to me.

49
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:59,093
Congratulations, you're
officially an assistant

50
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:00,510
to United States Attorney

51
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:02,678
for the eastern
district of New York.

52
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:07,928
(cheering)

53
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:13,763
I'm so proud of you.

54
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:36,764
Hello, Diane Giacalone
to see Wayne Brooks.

55
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:37,973
He's in court.

56
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,597
Diane: Oh, well, I'm supposed

57
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,306
to start work here today, and--

58
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,348
Beatrice Cantor,
Administrative Assistant.

59
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,097
Your office is out
into the corridor,

60
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,097
fourth door on the right.

61
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,681
Everything you need is in this.

62
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:50,891
With the exception of the
key to the facilities,

63
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:53,097
which hangs right here.

64
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,598
Failure to return the key
after use of the facilities

65
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,890
will result in
loss of privileges.

66
00:04:57,932 --> 00:04:59,556
Welcome to the U.S.
Attorney's Office

67
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,766
of the eastern
district of New York.

68
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:03,557
(phone ringing)

69
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:34,809
(knocking)

70
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:38,061
Hi, I'm Cassie Fielder, your
friendly next door neighbor.

71
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,352
Hi, Diane Giacalone.

72
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:42,352
I think somebody forgot
to clean my office out?

73
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:44,435
Cassie: Afraid not.

74
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,061
You're kidding,
all these cases are--

75
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:51,354
All yours, and, I've
got two more for you.

76
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:53,687
Compliments of Miss Warmth.

77
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,395
(laughing)

78
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,062
What's all this stuff?

79
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,896
Cassie: The usual,
you've got your frauds,

80
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:02,729
bank robberies,
narcotics, gun running,

81
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:05,896
a little of this,
a little of that.

82
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,064
But I'd say at least 40
percent is hijacking.

83
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,399
Man: Here you go.

84
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,318
-Shut it down.
-(brakes squealing)

85
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,026
Shut it down!

86
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:03,401
All right, get out, let's
go, come on, come on!

87
00:07:03,445 --> 00:07:05,776
All right, we could
do this two ways:

88
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,527
you could take a hike
back to the terminal,

89
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,820
have a cup of coffee, and then
in an hour you call the cops

90
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,694
and tell them it
was four black guys.

91
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:13,819
Or, I hit you, then you
walk back to the terminal.

92
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,320
Your choice.

93
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:17,820
You better hit me.

94
00:07:19,654 --> 00:07:21,986
Willie Boy: Hey, Gotti,
you know who we got?

95
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:23,403
This guy first.

96
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:25,071
All right, Willie boy.

97
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:55,406
Man in hat: Diane!

98
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,406
Hey, hey! Long time!

99
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,449
Well, maybe I should
say (speaking Italian).

100
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:03,241
No, Diane is just fine.

101
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:06,283
Ah! (smooching)

102
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:08,699
Oh, so you're a big
time lawyer now?

103
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:12,449
No, not so big time, I'm
working for the government.

104
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,783
-Oh, my.
-(Diane laughing)

105
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,784
You gonna put those
burger bums in jail?

106
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:18,825
If they break
the law, you bet.

107
00:08:18,868 --> 00:08:21,285
If they break the
law, they're scum.

108
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:24,533
Hey, for your Mike,
this John Gotti,

109
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:28,284
he's the big cheese they got
over there now, he's scum.

110
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:29,827
Remember he comes
to me 20 years ago,

111
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,868
with his gang,
The Rockaway, do you remember?

112
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:32,744
Yeah, I remember.

113
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:34,910
-Here.
-Here.

114
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:36,577
Get outta here.

115
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,285
Thanks.

116
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:39,953
This John Gotti, this punk,
he tells me I gotta pay him

117
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:42,368
or my food might get
accidentally crushed

118
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,953
and my windows broken.

119
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:46,744
I tell him, "No".

120
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:53,536
My windows, so then I
gotta say yeah, and I pay.

121
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,370
Hmm.

122
00:08:55,414 --> 00:08:57,205
Put him away.

123
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,204
I'll see you soon, Eddie.

124
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:02,705
You be careful.

125
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:04,370
Bye, Eddie!

126
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:07,371
These bums, these
men of respect?

127
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,912
They don't respect nothing!

128
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:11,580
Gang: Shut up, shut up.

129
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:19,498
I'll crush your
head, I swear to God.

130
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:29,291
Hey, baby, come on, me and you.

131
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,749
(whistling)

132
00:09:47,752 --> 00:09:50,125
Paul: Johnny.

133
00:09:52,877 --> 00:09:55,125
Remember what I told you, huh?

134
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,334
Paulie, I still think you--

135
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,877
Remember what I said.

136
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:11,168
Just calm down, huh?

137
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,335
Neil, I can't operate with
him on my back all the time.

138
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:18,294
Johnny Boy, he is
the head of the family.

139
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:20,461
It was better when Carlo
Gambino ran the family.

140
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:21,711
May he rest in peace.

141
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:24,253
May he rest in peace,
but Carlo himself

142
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:26,546
made Paulie Castellano
head of the family.

143
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:30,378
Johnny Boy, never forget that.

144
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,504
Yeah.

145
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,879
He was Carlo's choice.

146
00:10:33,922 --> 00:10:35,922
Yeah, all right.

147
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:38,171
You calm down, yeah?

148
00:10:38,215 --> 00:10:39,797
Take care.

149
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:51,464
-Gene: Johnny!
-Not now, Gene.

150
00:10:57,216 --> 00:10:59,881
(door slamming)

151
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,633
(glass shattering)

152
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,299
Come on, Johnny, relax.

153
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:10,424
I don't give a damn what
that stupid guinea says!

154
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:13,174
I'm gonna run this
crew any way I want to.

155
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:15,841
Johnny, we're doing
good, it all pays.

156
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,465
Come on, there's
more money in dope

157
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:19,343
than anything else
we do put together.

158
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:21,007
Hey, Big Paulie says--

159
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:23,425
Big Paulie, Big Paulie,
I'm sick of Big Paulie.

160
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:24,759
Johnny.

161
00:11:24,803 --> 00:11:26,507
And I'm telling you right now,

162
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:29,676
we're gettin' involved in the
babania business right now.

163
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,843
What's the matter?

164
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:44,969
Yeah, why's everybody
so serious, huh?

165
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:49,301
(laughing) Come on,
let's go get some clams.

166
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:54,052
♪ (singing in Italian) ♪

167
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:56,845
Yo, Diane, you wanna hurry up?

168
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:59,511
My wrist's fallin'
off down here.

169
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:02,345
Diane: Don't stop,
it'll stick to the pan.

170
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:05,928
-Yeah, yeah.
-She's gonna spoil her rotten.

171
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:07,889
Who, Diane, my sister'll
spoil my daughter?

172
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,805
Yes, Diane. (mumbling)

173
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:11,430
I don't think so,
Ma, please.

174
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:12,722
You know she spoils
that daughter rotten.

175
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,346
Of course she does.

176
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:15,971
Will you get over there
and stir please, Frankie?

177
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:17,723
-If that sticks...
-Go.

178
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:19,221
All right, all right, Ma.

179
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:20,680
...you're gonna ruin the

00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,605
I'll buy you lunch.

357
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:22,980
There's no way.

358
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,689
Well, thanks anyway,
it's not that she was

359
00:21:28,732 --> 00:21:31,021
Mother Teresa's
niece or anything,

360
00:21:31,064 --> 00:21:35,688
just another statistic
from Ozone Park.

361
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:37,690
Sergeant?

362
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:42,022
Ozone Park?

363
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:45,983
Yeah, it's in
Queens, you know it?

364
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:47,941
Oh, yeah.

365
00:21:47,984 --> 00:21:49,565
Bob: So you're from there?

366
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,733
Diane: Saint Mary Gate of
Heaven, the whole shebang.

367
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:54,525
Bob: Except the Bergen.

368
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:58,107
Diane: When I
was in high school,

369
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,024
I watched wise guys like that
actually seduce my friends,

370
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:04,401
made them think that
working for a living

371
00:22:04,444 --> 00:22:06,692
is what suckers did.

372
00:22:06,735 --> 00:22:09,442
Yeah, punks who watch their
fathers workin' all day,

373
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:12,402
and think what a
jerk, yeah, I know.

374
00:22:13,611 --> 00:22:16,191
I had a girlfriend
once say to me,

375
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:21,317
"Any girl who marries an honest
working man is an idiot".

376
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:22,984
So how did you
stay out of all that?

377
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:27,985
I don't know, sometimes I
think it was all a big accident.

378
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:31,110
No, it wasn't an accident,
it was my mother.

379
00:22:31,153 --> 00:22:32,736
She would have kicked my behind.

380
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,111
(laughing)

381
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:39,945
Okay, about Dio,
hijacking's a slam dunk.

382
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:42,987
What makes you think you
can nail him for murder?

383
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,655
I got wits that'll testify.

384
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:48,071
April knew all
about the hijacking,

385
00:22:48,114 --> 00:22:49,736
and she was
threatening to rat him out

386
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,196
for skimming with a
mug named John Gotti,

387
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:54,780
crew chief at The Bergen.

388
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:56,530
On the night she disappeared,

389
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:59,737
I got him draggin'
her out of a bar.

390
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:02,446
I can even put him in her
apartment later that night.

391
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:03,863
So what's the problem?

392
00:23:03,907 --> 00:23:04,822
Bob: The body.

393
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,323
What about it?

394
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:08,573
There isn't one.

395
00:23:08,616 --> 00:23:10,614
When I said she
disappeared, I meant it.

396
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:13,114
Nobody's seen her since
the night of the fight.

397
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:15,572
So she took off, it
happens all the time.

398
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:18,199
If she did, she left
without her clothes,

399
00:23:18,242 --> 00:23:19,866
make-up, and jewelry.

400
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:24,032
Okay, you got a
point, what do you want?

401
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:28,616
I know she's dead, and I
know that slime ball did her,

402
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,907
but my lieutenant won't
let me spend any more time

403
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,741
on the case without
a prosecutor.

404
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:35,534
(Diane sighs)

405
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,950
Dio's a loose cannon,
definitely paranoid, right?

406
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:44,910
Okay, let's get in his face,
make him a little crazier.

407
00:23:44,953 --> 00:23:46,909
Pry him loose.

408
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:50,285
(Bob laughing)

409
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:52,536
I'm in.

410
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,329
Man: Yeah, that's him.

411
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:49,916
(phone ringing)

412
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,415
Diane: (over telephone)Diane Giacalone.

413
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:52,831
Bob: (over telephone)It's Teague,

414
00:24:52,874 --> 00:24:54,957
I found out who
Dio's partner was

415
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,583
in the armored car job.

416
00:24:56,626 --> 00:24:57,789
Diane: Who?

417
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,373
Bob: Heroin
addict named Charlie.

418
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:01,458
Diane: Good
work, let's bust him

419
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,374
and see if he wants to talk.

420
00:25:15,502 --> 00:25:19,044
(Bob laughing)

421
00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:35,128
Jackie: Hey Charlie,
what'd you tell 'em?

422
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,170
Charlie: Hey, Jackie.

423
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:37,793
Jackie: Why'd
they let you go?

424
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,127
Charlie: Hey, look, I
didn't tell them nothin', man,

425
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,795
I swear to God!

426
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,379
(gunshots)

427
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:45,880
(gunshots)

428
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,503
Diane?

429
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:52,045
Charlie here wants to know

430
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:53,878
if you can spare
him a few minutes.

431
00:25:53,922 --> 00:25:57,380
(Diane laughing)

432
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:02,590
(laughing and talking)

433
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,673
Good morning, gentlemen.

434
00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:11,631
All: Good morning.

435
00:26:11,674 --> 00:26:13,215
Diane: I'm glad
you could make it,

436
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:16,507
have a seat, gentlemen,
I'm Diane Giacalone.

437
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,714
Let's see, anybody
missing who matters?

438
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:22,922
(people chuckling)

439
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:27,590
We have the 106th, we have
the 101st, and the 82nd,

440
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:29,716
NYPD is well represented.

441
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,590
We have the DA, hiya Walt.

442
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:36,134
We've got Special Agent
Randolph from the FBI,

443
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,674
glad you could make it.

444
00:26:37,718 --> 00:26:40,425
How about the postal inspectors?

445
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:42,924
Thank you, gentlemen,
thanks for coming.

446
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:48,049
Okay, the idea is to
mount a major case

447
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:51,218
against the members of
the Gambino crime family

448
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:53,718
and their associates.

449
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:58,552
We think, no, I think, that
some of those bad actors

450
00:26:58,595 --> 00:27:02,218
we've come to know and love
around here are not freelancers,

451
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:07,801
but are in fact linked to the
Gambinos through a crew chief

452
00:27:07,845 --> 00:27:10,678
named John Gotti, who hangs out

453
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:15,594
at The Bergen Hunt and
Fish Club on 101st Avenue.

454
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:19,679
In here, you'll find a
list of about 60 names.

455
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:22,845
All bozos in some
way or another,

456
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:25,304
that have been
connected to The Bergen.

457
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:28,180
And what I need from
all of you guys,

458
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:32,429
by next Wednesday, is
every piece of paper

459
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:35,055
on which any of
these names appear.

460
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:37,429
(group murmuring)

461
00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:41,265
I mean everything,
old cases, new cases,

462
00:27:41,308 --> 00:27:43,473
cases that never went anywhere.

463
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:47,390
Surveillance photos,
wire tap ID's.

464
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:51,765
Gossip, rumor,
I'll take anything.

465
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:55,972
Diane, you're talking
about hundreds of hours here.

466
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:59,808
The FBI, excuse
me, maybe I'm talking

467
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:01,682
to the wrong bunch of guys here.

468
00:28:01,726 --> 00:28:03,849
I mean, I thought
you were the guys

469
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,641
who got bent out
of shape every time

470
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,100
some sleazebag walked
because the DA was too lazy

471
00:28:09,142 --> 00:28:10,974
to make the case.

472
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:14,350
I thought you were the
guys who bitched to me

473
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:17,725
about why we try
two-bit hijackers

474
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:21,726
instead of the bigwig
mob guys they work for.

475
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:25,351
I thought you were the guys
who wanted all this crap

476
00:28:25,395 --> 00:28:30,019
we go through every day
to finally mean something,

477
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:32,518
to make a difference.

478
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:36,727
Well, dumb old me,
maybe I've been workin'

479
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,728
the wrong room here.

480
00:28:40,354 --> 00:28:42,020
Diane's right.

481
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:46,686
In the two years
she's been here,

482
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,645
she's busted her butt
for every one of us.

483
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:54,811
She's made cases nobody
else would even touch.

484
00:28:54,854 --> 00:28:59,728
I want you all to know that I
carry only two business cards

485
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:07,647
in my wallet, my cardiologist,
and Diane Giacalone.

486
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:09,939
Thanks, Bob.

487
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:15,857
So, are you with me or not?

488
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,022
John: What do
I gotta do, huh?

489
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:23,023
I warned this Greek
bastard twice now.

490
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,356
I don't know, Johnny, I--

491
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,272
Hey, if you don't
know, who does, huh?

492
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:28,565
I sent you over there
twice to ask you

493
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:30,482
-to shut down his book!
-Johnny, we tried--

494
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:32,149
Shut up!

495
00:29:32,192 --> 00:29:34,525
I wanna hear from you I'll
tell you, you understand?

496
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:37,315
So, what do I gotta do,

497
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,898
spell it out for
the two of you, huh?

498
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:42,358
You go over there, and you
tell that Greek son of a bitch

499
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:45,358
that if he don't shut down
the book in his deli now,

500
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:47,483
I'll see to it that it's
shut down permanently.

501
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:52,026
(glass shattering)

502
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:59,859
I don't want no
book, no nothin',

503
00:29:59,902 --> 00:30:03,486
operated in my neighborhood
except by me and mine.

504
00:30:03,528 --> 00:30:05,986
And that Greek bastard
definitely ain't me,

505
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:07,445
and he ain't mine.

506
00:30:09,361 --> 00:30:11,069
And then Willie Boy,
while you're over there,

507
00:30:11,112 --> 00:30:12,777
you pick up some of thatgood salty white cheese

508
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,446
the guy's got,
I forget the name.

509
00:30:20,238 --> 00:30:22,070
Hey, Sammy the Bull,
what do you say?

510
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:24,030
Hangin' in there, Johnny.

511
00:30:26,363 --> 00:30:28,029
-The family all right?
-Gina's pregnant.

512
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:29,363
Way to go, Sammy the Bull.

513
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:31,321
Yeah. (speaking Italian)

514
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:33,613
Come on, let's take a walk.

515
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:37,780
So, everything all set
with the Florida people?

516
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,071
Yeah.

517
00:30:39,114 --> 00:30:40,488
And the Colombians?

518
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:42,321
Yeah, everything's all set.

519
00:30:42,365 --> 00:30:44,696
So what's wrong?

520
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:47,449
I don't know, John, I'm just
not sure it's the right time.

521
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:49,114
Why not?

522
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:52,531
You know Big Paulie, he
says anybody in the family

523
00:30:52,574 --> 00:30:54,905
gets into drugs, he
orders them dead.

524
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:57,739
I told you, Neil covers
us with Big Paulie, capich ?

525
00:30:57,782 --> 00:30:59,907
Neil's sick, he's got cancer.

526
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,407
What if Neil goes,
then we're naked.

527
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,365
Hey, we're all doin' good,

528
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:08,532
maybe we just keep
our heads down.

529
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,824
The Colombians
keepin' their heads down?

530
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:13,282
The Mulignans, they
keepin' their heads down?

531
00:31:13,325 --> 00:31:17,034
Noriega down in Panama,
he keepin' his head down?

532
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:19,699
Word on the street
is that some bitch

533
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:23,409
in the U.S. Attorney's Office
is out to get you, Johnny.

534
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:24,493
Who?

535
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:28,243
Name's Giacalone.

536
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,492
-Italian?
-Yeah.

537
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:32,576
An Italian broad's
tryin' to burn me?

538
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:35,243
(laughing) What's a
matter with these people?

539
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:36,619
We gotta stick together.

540
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:40,787
Don't worry, Big Paulie'll
take care of her.

541
00:31:46,122 --> 00:31:47,577
What's the matter?

542
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:50,037
I don't know, Big
Paulie's not part of this.

543
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,370
He's not part of this?

544
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,619
You mean this bitch is
comin' after me alone?

545
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,412
You and your crew,
and maybe Neil.

546
00:31:57,455 --> 00:31:58,871
So what the hell did
we send all this money

547
00:31:58,914 --> 00:32:00,245
to Big Paulie for, huh?

548
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:02,828
If it's not to take
care of this crap?

549
00:32:02,872 --> 00:32:05,038
Neil's sick, maybe
Castellano figures--

550
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:06,664
I know what he figures,

551
00:32:06,706 --> 00:32:08,288
he figures he'll leave
me and Neilie out to dry,

552
00:32:08,332 --> 00:32:09,789
that's what he figures.

553
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:11,872
Ah, son of a bitch.

554
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:21,498
♪ ("Silent Night" on piano) ♪

555
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:29,748
And then Mary looked
up and saw the star,

556
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:34,416
and lo, it shone its
light all over the world.

557
00:32:37,001 --> 00:32:40,333

00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:49,250
Announcer: Thank you for
coming to the Ozone Park

559
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:50,999
annual Christmas Party,

560
00:32:51,043 --> 00:32:53,584
sponsored by The Bergen
Hunt and Fish Club.

561
00:32:53,627 --> 00:32:56,458
Everybody have fun
at the bazaar now.

562
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:59,876
Oh, that's beautiful,
you were beautiful.

563
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,959
You did such a good job.

564
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:02,626
The best, the best one.

565
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:03,877
When you said your words.

566
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,251
(laughing)

567
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:06,377
You wanna go win some
teddy bears and stuff?

568
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,544
No?

569
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:09,253
Aw, come on.

570
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:14,085
You know something, this
pitchin' arm here never misses.

571
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:15,169
Please. (laughing)

572
00:33:15,212 --> 00:33:16,878
Easy, slugger.

573
00:33:16,921 --> 00:33:19,920
All right, guys, I'll meet
you back at Mom's, okay?

574
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:20,962
What are you doin'?

575
00:33:21,006 --> 00:33:22,336
It's early.

576
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,169
I know, but I can't really be

577
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:26,754
at this Gotti sponsored
thing, it's not right.

578
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,254
Oh, but I wanted
to introduce you

579
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,462
to Mrs. Carlone and Mrs. Russi.

580
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:33,213
Well, bring them
over for coffee later.

581
00:33:33,256 --> 00:33:35,213
-I love you guys, have fun.
-All right.

582
00:33:35,256 --> 00:33:36,338
You're an angel.

583
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,005
-See ya.
-Bye.

584
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:41,463
She don't look good.

585
00:33:41,507 --> 00:33:44,672
It's the case, she's
workin' too hard.

586
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:47,879
Oh, don't worry, Ma,
she'll be all right.

587
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:50,464
Mmm, from your
lips to God's ears.

588
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:52,297
Yeah, so what do you say?

589
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,672
Do you want me to
win you a teddy bear?

590
00:33:53,716 --> 00:33:55,632
Yes, I want a teddy bear.

591
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:04,507
For the little girl.

592
00:34:07,635 --> 00:34:09,507
No, thank you.

593
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,423
What's the matter, you
think you're too good for him?

594
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,091
Well, let me tell you,
Diane, in this neighborhood

595
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:16,341
Johnny Gotti's a hero.

596
00:34:16,384 --> 00:34:18,966
You don't take nothin',
do you, Miss Giacalone

597
00:34:19,009 --> 00:34:21,341
from the U.S. Attorney's Office.

598
00:34:21,384 --> 00:34:23,550
Miss Giacalone from
Newberry Street.

599
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,218
You shouldn't
be talking to me.

600
00:34:25,261 --> 00:34:27,716
Then don't come to my party.

601
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,718
You're right,
it was a mistake.

602
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:34,802
Everybody takes 'cause
everybody needs, even you do.

603
00:34:34,845 --> 00:34:36,593
Excuse me?

604
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,135
What did you say?

605
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,886
Gluck, as in good luck.

606
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:47,512
(laughing)

607
00:34:49,846 --> 00:34:51,510
Are you aware that
you've got a woman

608
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:54,594
by the name of Diane
Giacalone who's talking about

609
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:58,387
a RICO prosecution
against the Gambinos?

610
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,470
Well, we understand that
she'll need our cooperation,

611
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:05,721
but we think maybe the
idea's a little premature.

612
00:35:05,764 --> 00:35:08,304
Not enough manpower.

613
00:35:08,348 --> 00:35:09,720
Well, you do what
you think is right,

614
00:35:09,763 --> 00:35:13,305
but I'm afraid we won't be
able to be of any help to you.

615
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:15,722
Just wanted to let you know.

616
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,096
Randolph!

617
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,306
Will you step in here
a minute, please?

618
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:26,765
I appreciate you guys
agreeing to stick with me,

619
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:30,974
but I think the job just
got tougher, the FBI is out.

620
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:38,682
Now we can't count on anything
from the bureau, zero, zilch,

621
00:35:38,726 --> 00:35:43,391
any documents, tapes, photos,
we'll have to subpoena

622
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,849
or otherwise arm wrestle for.

623
00:35:45,892 --> 00:35:49,849
And nobody, my boss included,
feels that you can mount

624
00:35:49,892 --> 00:35:53,767
the RICO case without
the FBI, except for me.

625
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,767
I'd like to go ahead,
I'd like to dismantle

626
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,142
The Bergen punk by punk.

627
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:01,976
But I can't do it alone,

628
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:06,641
so I need to know how many of
you are gonna stick around.

629
00:36:06,685 --> 00:36:11,852
Anybody who wants to leave,
look, no hard feelings,

630
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:17,144
I understand, kinda.

631
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:22,269
But, those of you who
are gonna stay, great,

632
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:24,479
and those of you who are not,

633
00:36:25,813 --> 00:36:28,813
you know where the door is.

634
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:37,563
Well, I'm with ya.

635
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:54,440
Thanks.

636
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:06,024
Thank you.

637
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:09,941
All right, let's get going!

638
00:37:09,984 --> 00:37:13,191
(clapping and cheering)

639
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:21,650
I want Willie Boy Johnson
dropped from your indictment.

640
00:37:23,526 --> 00:37:26,066
He's an informant, isn't he?

641
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:28,359
I was going over his rap
sheet the other night,

642
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:31,025
and Willie Boy here's been
arrested for everything

643
00:37:31,069 --> 00:37:32,775
from assault to murder one,

644
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,526
and every kind of dirty business
The Bergen's involved in

645
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:37,775
Willie Boy is a part of.

646
00:37:37,818 --> 00:37:40,068
And he's only been to jail once.

647
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,485
Is he a snitch or isn't he?

648
00:37:44,736 --> 00:37:46,610
Willie Boy Johnson's
been providing high level

649
00:37:46,654 --> 00:37:48,403
information about
the middle management

650
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:50,736
of the Gambino Family for years.

651
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:53,319
(scoffs) But you didn't
feel it was necessary

652
00:37:53,363 --> 00:37:55,112
to inform us of that fact

653
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:57,445
when Diane started
her investigation?

654
00:37:57,488 --> 00:37:59,194
Tell me, if Willie
Boy is such hot spit,

655
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:02,445
how come nobody's prosecuted
The Bergen crowd before?

656
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,779
It's none of your business.

657
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:05,570
I think it is, Ned.

658
00:38:05,613 --> 00:38:09,112
I'll tell you why, the
FBI is more interested

659
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:11,112
in drawing up
organizational charts

660
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,696
than it is
prosecuting criminals.

661
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,988
So rather than blow Willie Boy,

662
00:38:16,031 --> 00:38:19,654
they let John Gotti and his
thugs do whatever they want.

663
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,155
You're entitled to your
opinion, just drop him.

664
00:38:22,198 --> 00:38:24,321
-No.
-You damn well better!

665
00:38:24,365 --> 00:38:27,198
Take it easy, Ned, she
works for me, not you.

666
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,906
I'll tell you something else,

667
00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:32,281
when I indict his crew, we'll
have to inform their lawyers

668
00:38:32,324 --> 00:38:34,447
that we know that
Willie Boy is a snitch.

669
00:38:34,491 --> 00:38:36,197
Are you crazy,
they'll kill him!

670
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,323
We have to reveal any
evidence which could be helpful

671
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:40,366
to the defense, it's the law.

672
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:41,949
All the more
reason to drop him.

673
00:38:41,992 --> 00:38:43,782
I can't, he's everywhere.

674
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:45,574
He's in on every crime.

675
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:49,158
You people gave him the
license to extort, to steal,

676
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,700
to kill, you name it!

677
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:54,283
I want this whole
investigation dropped!

678
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:57,241
Who do you think you are.

679
00:38:57,285 --> 00:38:58,825
Giacalone, if I
weren't a gentleman

680
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,201
I'd punch your lights out.

681
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:02,660
-Try it.
-Diane, get out of here now.

682
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:03,742
What?

683
00:39:03,785 --> 00:39:05,908
I'll take it from here, go on.

684
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:07,742
Do we still have a case?

685
00:39:07,786 --> 00:39:11,285
Diane, beat it, I mean it!

686
00:39:27,747 --> 00:39:29,077
Did you hear that?

687
00:39:29,121 --> 00:39:30,536
Cassie: Part of it.

688
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,246
Damn the nerve.

689
00:39:33,247 --> 00:39:34,954
Cassie: Are you sure?

690
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,246
About what?

691
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,038
Cassie: Willie Boy.

692
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:39,622
What about him?

693
00:39:40,831 --> 00:39:43,829
Well, Truscott is
right, they'll kill him.

694
00:39:43,873 --> 00:39:46,079
Oh, you, too?

695
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:48,330
Oh, Diane, don't
misunderstand me.

696
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:51,412
Well, what shall
I do, kiss his butt?

697
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:53,539
I'm not saying you
should do anything.

698
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:57,496
I'm trying to put away
the scum of the Earth here!

699
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,748
What should I do,
ask them nicey, nicey

700
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:02,456
to testify against each other?

701
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:03,748
Diane, I don't know.

702
00:40:03,791 --> 00:40:06,083
Well what the hell
am I supposed to do?

703
00:40:06,126 --> 00:40:08,581
Nothing, you're right!

704
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:10,916
I'm sorry.

705
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:14,541
Forgive me.

706
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:22,750
What if he refuses to testify,
do you still have a case?

707
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:27,501
I don't know.

708
00:40:28,377 --> 00:40:29,542
Okay.

709
00:40:32,753 --> 00:40:33,501
Okay.

710
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:36,501
(Diane sighing)

711
00:40:42,837 --> 00:40:47,545
(crowd talking)

712
00:40:56,005 --> 00:40:57,462
(chair slamming)

713
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,169
(record scratching)

714
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:10,254
I just got a
call, a phone call,

715
00:41:10,297 --> 00:41:15,338
a very disturbing
phone call, just now.

716
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:19,797
It was Sammy the Bull.

717
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:25,214
And he's worried, 'cause
he thinks I might be

718
00:41:25,257 --> 00:41:26,964
in some kind of trouble.

719
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:33,631
In the old days, he says to me,

720
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:37,090
in the old days if a
member of this club

721
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:39,965
should take a fall for a
nickel, or even a dime,

722
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:42,465
he figures he'll hit the
bricks in three or four,

723
00:41:42,508 --> 00:41:47,007
so he does his time,
and he holds his water.

724
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:52,466
But maybe, if, because
of some new business

725
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:58,007
he does with babange,
he gets say 25.

726
00:41:58,051 --> 00:42:01,091
And Sammy's worried
that this guy's

727
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:03,801
gonna lose bladder
control and take a piss

728
00:42:03,844 --> 00:42:06,468
on all of his friends.

729
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:16,885
Willie Boy, what do you think?

730
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:18,635
About what?

731
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:24,552
You think anybody here
would do a thing like that?

732
00:42:24,595 --> 00:42:27,554
I don't know,
depends on the guy.

733
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:28,636
Really?

734
00:42:31,555 --> 00:42:33,636
It depends on the guy.

735
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,846
You mean there could be
a rat in this very room?

736
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,387
In this very room!

737
00:42:42,347 --> 00:42:45,722
Well, take me, for instance.

738
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:50,429
I would never rat
out a guy, never.

739
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:55,596
No matter how much
I was lookin' at.

740
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:59,598
But that's just me,
how I was brought up,

741
00:43:01,017 --> 00:43:02,473
that's just me.

742
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:07,433
Johnny, you askin'?

743
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:13,807
Johnny: As a for instance.

744
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,766
You have to ask?

745
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:19,642
We're just talkin', right?

746
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:23,766
I've done a lot
of things, Johnny,

747
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,682
a lot of things been done to me,

748
00:43:25,726 --> 00:43:28,766
but I don't piss on my friends.

749
00:43:35,893 --> 00:43:41,393
Word is you've been meeting

750
00:43:41,437 --> 00:43:45,894
with the FBI.

751
00:43:47,896 --> 00:43:49,727
That's a lie.

752
00:44:03,812 --> 00:44:07,061
What is this country
coming to, huh?

753
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:17,689
When you can't
even trust the FBI.

754
00:44:20,647 --> 00:44:25,480
(laughing)

755
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:33,647
I got nothin' to say to
you, not now, not ever,

756
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,440
you wanna talk to
me, call my lawyer!

757
00:44:38,733 --> 00:44:40,398
What do we do now?

758
00:44:41,275 --> 00:44:44,899
I haven't the slightest idea.

759
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:46,940
(phone ringing)

760
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:53,691
Diane Giacalone.

761
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,441
Luke Coslo : Yeah,
this is Luke Coslo

762
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,690
over at the Brooklyn
DA's office.

763
00:44:57,733 --> 00:45:00,441
We just booked a guy for murderwho's lookin' for a deal.

764
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:03,109
He wants to sing his head offabout some mob types in Queens.

765
00:45:03,152 --> 00:45:05,151
What's his name?

766
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:08,650
Argento, Freddy Argento.

767
00:45:08,693 --> 00:45:11,318
Thing is, we got
nothin' to offer him.

768
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:12,777
Hold on.

769
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,567
We called the
Organized Crime Unit,

770
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:17,401
but everyone's gone
home for the weekend.

771
00:45:17,444 --> 00:45:18,818
Ditto for the FBI--

772
00:45:18,861 --> 00:45:20,277
Oh, my God.

773
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,694
-Listen, Lou?-Yeah?

774
00:45:21,737 --> 00:45:25,610
Don't move,
don't let him move,

775
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:28,569
next sound you hear is
me breakin' Mach Two.

776
00:45:28,612 --> 00:45:30,028
Stop lying!

777
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:32,486
I'm not lying,
get out of my face!

778
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:34,987
You don't know John
Gotti from Santa Claus!

779
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,777
John Gotti's one of
the finest men I know.

780
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:40,944
Diane: John Gotti's one
of the finest men you know.

781
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,362
Oh, you heard me.

782
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:44,821
Diane: That's why
you're chompin' at the bit

783
00:45:44,865 --> 00:45:45,947
to rat on him, right?

784
00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:49,321
Will it get me
out of these faster?

785
00:45:49,363 --> 00:45:50,904
If it's the truth.

786
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:52,571
Then let's go.

787
00:45:52,614 --> 00:45:54,861
Diane: You're a real slime
bucket, aren't you, Fred?

788
00:45:54,905 --> 00:45:59,864
Ho! You wanna kill me like
you killed Castigliola,

789
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:01,530
and God knows who else?

790
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:06,071
I'm your only prayer here,
Freddy, and you know it.

791
00:46:06,115 --> 00:46:07,530
Stop calling me names!

792
00:46:07,574 --> 00:46:11,406
You're a murdering,
lying, drug addict punk.

793
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:13,197
You treat me
with some respect!

794
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,074
You give me a reason to
treat you with respect!

795
00:46:18,284 --> 00:46:19,741
Let him go.

796
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:23,283
I can get you John Gotti.

797
00:46:23,326 --> 00:46:26,115
-Prove it.
-(scoffs) What do I get?

798
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,156
Start talking, keep talking,

799
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,075
and if it's the truth,
and it burns Gotti,

800
00:46:32,118 --> 00:46:34,575
you'll get immunity.

801
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:35,908
What, for anything?

802
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:38,534
Diane: For anything you say.

803
00:46:38,577 --> 00:46:40,660
All right, let's go.

804
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:56,285
But you lie to me
once, about anything,

805
00:46:56,328 --> 00:47:01,203
you'll go back in there and
I'll make sure you disappear.

806
00:47:01,246 --> 00:47:03,411
-You got it?
-I got it.

807
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:04,993
Okay.

808
00:47:05,037 --> 00:47:09,119
Okay, geez, you're a real
tough bitch, aren't you?

809
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:11,204
You really know how to
charm a girl, don't you?

810
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:13,037
(scoffs)

811
00:47:19,497 --> 00:47:23,078
This is the testimony
of one Freddy Argento

812
00:47:23,121 --> 00:47:28,081
given of his own free
will on October 9th, 1984.

813
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:31,581
(envelope sliding)

814
00:47:35,415 --> 00:47:38,163
I first met John
Gotti in 1979,

815
00:47:38,207 --> 00:47:42,039
at Clinton Correctional,
Upstate New York.

816
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:44,039
He told me all about
whacking some mick

817
00:47:44,082 --> 00:47:46,665
that had kidnapped
Gambino's nephew.

818
00:47:46,709 --> 00:47:48,457
He told me that him
and two other guys

819
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,623
just walked into this
bar in Staten Island,

820
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:52,207
and whacked this guy
like they was layin' down

821
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,957
a bet at the track.

822
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,581
Me and Johnny got
along pretty good,

823
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:59,582
so when I got out of Attica
I went by The Bergen Club,

824
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:01,958
see that's Johnny's
crew headquarters.

825
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:04,998
He's one of the crew chiefs
for the Gambino Family.

826
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:08,584
The Gambino Family is divided
into several different crews.

827
00:48:08,627 --> 00:48:10,625
Hey, freeze!

828
00:48:10,668 --> 00:48:13,126
Freddy: See, when you
pull a job for the crew,

829
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,874
or in the crew's neighborhood,

830
00:48:14,918 --> 00:48:17,876
you give a cut of the take to
the crew boss out of respect,

831
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,459
that's John Gotti.

832
00:48:20,503 --> 00:48:22,709
He takes a cut, and
then passes most of it

833
00:48:22,752 --> 00:48:25,252
on up to the Under
Boss, Neil Dellacroce.

834
00:48:25,295 --> 00:48:27,627
Neil takes a cut, and
passes the larger share

835
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,585
on up to the Don, Big
Paulie Castellano.

836
00:48:30,629 --> 00:48:33,502
That's the way every crew works.

837
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:38,545
-(television playing)
-(door knocking)

838
00:48:48,298 --> 00:48:49,628
Man at door: Who is it?

839
00:48:49,672 --> 00:48:51,838
Cassie: Diane, it's
Cassie, are you all right?

840
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:54,253
Diane: Yeah, it's
okay, it's my friend.

841
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:58,047
You can let her in, it's okay.

842
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,255
-Hi.
-Hi.

843
00:49:00,298 --> 00:49:02,423
Diane: Come on in.

844
00:49:03,715 --> 00:49:05,882
-How are you?
-Good, how are you doing?

845
00:49:07,216 --> 00:49:08,256
Okay, do you believe this?

846
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,089
I think it's a good idea.

847
00:49:10,133 --> 00:49:11,922
Why, because
they're out on bail?

848
00:49:11,966 --> 00:49:14,214
They were in the
street last week,

849
00:49:14,257 --> 00:49:18,338
and I didn't have the Herb
Brothers in my living room.

850
00:49:18,381 --> 00:49:21,549
Last week Willie Boy didn't
know you blew his cover.

851
00:49:21,593 --> 00:49:24,340
And last week, you
didn't have Argento.

852
00:49:24,383 --> 00:49:26,839
What's he got to do with it?

853
00:49:26,883 --> 00:49:31,716
Diane, with Freddy, for the
first time you've got a shot,

854
00:49:31,759 --> 00:49:33,425
and they know it.

855
00:49:33,468 --> 00:49:34,509
Ahem.

856
00:49:35,218 --> 00:49:36,259
What?

857
00:49:37,009 --> 00:49:38,675
Glass of water?

858
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:41,341
This is not working.

859
00:49:41,385 --> 00:49:45,051
Excuse me, gentlemen, I really
appreciate you coming by,

860
00:49:45,094 --> 00:49:47,675
but, when you gotta
go, you gotta go.

861
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:50,259
-Judge Fisk said--
-I know what Judge Fisk said,

862
00:49:50,302 --> 00:49:53,968
and you can tell him that
I personally threw you out.

863
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:55,510
Judge said you might do that.

864
00:49:55,553 --> 00:49:58,302
And if you did, you
had to sign this.

865
00:49:58,345 --> 00:50:00,968
-What is it?
-It's an affidavit.

866
00:50:01,012 --> 00:50:03,885
Basically it says if we leave
and you get yourself killed,

867
00:50:03,929 --> 00:50:05,011
it's not our fault.

868
00:50:05,054 --> 00:50:06,637
Deal.

869
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:15,678
Okay, thank you, I'm really
sorry about the ball game,

870
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:19,805
it's been swell,
don't come back.

871
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:24,930
Dumb! (laughing)

872
00:50:24,973 --> 00:50:26,846
Tell me about Dolan,
this guy who's gonna

873
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:29,512
be our second chair.

874
00:50:29,556 --> 00:50:32,013
Oh, Hank, young
guy, real smart,

875
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:34,013
terrific legal mind,
you're gonna love him.

876
00:50:34,057 --> 00:50:35,638
Trial experience?

877
00:50:35,681 --> 00:50:39,307
You know, I'm not sure,
but he's a quick study.

878
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,515
Cassandra?

879
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:46,056
This is his first trial?

880
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:49,680
You mean our second chair has
never tried a case before?

881
00:50:49,723 --> 00:50:51,724
-No, but it could be fun.
-Fun?

882
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:53,140
Cassie: I'll
have him up to speed

883
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:54,389
-in no time
-Diane: Fun?

884
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:55,723
-at all.
-Diane: This is not fun!

885
00:50:55,767 --> 00:50:56,974
It seems to me you've
got one big problem,

886
00:50:57,017 --> 00:50:59,307
which is how you
explain to a jury

887
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:02,182
exactly what a RICO
prosecution is.

888
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:06,140
I mean, when you say
conspiracy to conduct

889
00:51:06,183 --> 00:51:08,600
a continuing pattern
of criminal activity,

890
00:51:08,643 --> 00:51:11,600
it sounds like
legalistic gobbledygook.

891
00:51:11,643 --> 00:51:12,891
Hey, Hank?

892
00:51:12,934 --> 00:51:15,392
If you're gonna continue
to be my co-counsel

893
00:51:15,435 --> 00:51:18,642
I'd like to introduce
you to the pronoun we.

894
00:51:18,686 --> 00:51:20,809
Yeah, think
little piggy, Hank.

895
00:51:20,852 --> 00:51:24,226
Sorry, problem we've got.

896
00:51:24,269 --> 00:51:26,059
It's a business, isn't it?

897
00:51:26,102 --> 00:51:28,643
A crime business, we're
going to prosecute them

898
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:30,810
because they're running
a crime business.

899
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:32,893
Cassie: Yeah, that's
good, and it's for profit,

900
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:34,809
but instead of
selling paper clips

901
00:51:34,852 --> 00:51:36,853
they're selling
protection, or hookers,

902
00:51:36,895 --> 00:51:38,143
or stolen property, or--

903
00:51:38,186 --> 00:51:40,062
Right, and when
they murder someone,

904
00:51:40,105 --> 00:51:42,228
it's to eliminate
the competition,

905
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:43,894
get a bigger market share.

906
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:47,811
Yeah, I don't know, it sort
of sanitizes them, doesn't it?

907
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:52,478
No, it cuts through all the
romantic, mysterious crap.

908
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:56,020
The Godfather, The
Capo di Tutti Capi,

909
00:51:56,063 --> 00:51:58,813
Al Pacino looking soulful.

910
00:51:58,856 --> 00:52:02,105
They're not romantic, they're
a bunch of money grubbing

911
00:52:02,148 --> 00:52:05,272
little thugs who are
too dumb to make a buck

912
00:52:05,315 --> 00:52:07,522
without hitting
somebody over the head.

913
00:52:07,565 --> 00:52:09,521
Didn't I tell you,
you'd be working

914
00:52:09,565 --> 00:52:13,314
with a cool, dispassionate
professional.

915
00:52:13,357 --> 00:52:16,688
My name is Giacalone,
and I'm proud of it.

916
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:20,440
I mean, we gave the world
Michelangelo, Da Vinci,

917
00:52:20,483 --> 00:52:24,107
Verdi, Puccini, and it
makes me furious to know

918
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:28,607
that these cases of arrested
development are Italian, ah!

919
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:04,278
(people murmuring)

920
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:23,154
Look, there's Big
Paulie Castellano.

921
00:53:23,198 --> 00:53:25,778
What, am I blind?

922
00:53:25,821 --> 00:53:28,154
Well come on then, we gotta
pay our respects to him.

923
00:53:28,198 --> 00:53:30,279
I'm going in the church,

924
00:53:30,322 --> 00:53:34,154
I came to pay my respects
to Neil, not Castellano.

925
00:53:34,198 --> 00:53:36,988
John, John, where you goin'?

926
00:53:37,031 --> 00:53:38,405
You crazy?

927
00:53:39,198 --> 00:53:43,697
♪ (organ music) ♪

928
00:53:54,742 --> 00:53:56,408
He keeps looking at you.

929
00:53:57,408 --> 00:54:01,698
Sure, he hears footsteps.

930
00:54:01,741 --> 00:54:04,281
Frankie: What are you
talkin' about, footsteps?

931
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,532
I don't like it.

932
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,450
Just do what I
do, look right back.

933
00:54:16,994 --> 00:54:21,116
Think he knows about
the, you know, deals?

934
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,867
Because without Neil, you
know, we're gonna be--

935
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:27,367
Shut up, Frankie, it don't
matter what Big Paulie knows.

936
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,451
Don't matter? (scoffs)

937
00:54:29,494 --> 00:54:31,369
Johnny, what do you? (scoffs)

938
00:54:34,913 --> 00:54:38,744
Oh, my God, Jesus,
Mary, and Joseph.

939
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,083
(gunshots)

940
00:55:27,793 --> 00:55:31,874
(gunshots)

941
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:36,042
He's dead.

942
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,791
Diane: Midtown Manhattan,
for God's sake, rush hour?

943
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:43,333
Nine shopping days
'til Christmas?

944
00:55:43,376 --> 00:55:46,708
What is it, they went
completely nutso.

945
00:55:46,752 --> 00:55:50,542
A week before
Christmas, it's terrible.

946
00:55:50,585 --> 00:55:52,583
You be careful with those thugs.

947
00:55:52,627 --> 00:55:53,626
Arrest them.

948
00:55:53,669 --> 00:55:55,001
I can't.

949
00:55:55,045 --> 00:55:56,668
Only if you think it
could have been Gotti.

950
00:55:56,711 --> 00:55:59,084
-I told you!
-She can't talk about the case.

951
00:55:59,127 --> 00:56:01,127
Come on, can't talk about
the case, please, we're family!

952
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:02,501
Leave her alone!

953
00:56:02,544 --> 00:56:04,586
-Frank: Who asked you?
-Frankie.

954
00:56:04,629 --> 00:56:05,793
You wanna know the truth?

955
00:56:05,836 --> 00:56:08,543
Who cares, it's that
Big Paulie this,

956
00:56:08,587 --> 00:56:10,294
three finger that, the
next guy's gonna be

957
00:56:10,337 --> 00:56:12,335
just like the last guy,
they'll always be a boss,

958
00:56:12,379 --> 00:56:14,003
and they'll always be the mob!

959
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:15,419
You don't know what
you're talking about.

960
00:56:15,462 --> 00:56:17,627
-Come on.
-And even if it were true,

961
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,003
does that mean we
don't do anything?

962
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,545
Frank: Maybe, why bother?

963
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:22,170
Diane: Because
they're an insult!

964
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,504
Frank: An insult to who?

965
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,879
To me, to you, to
Mama, to the girls,

966
00:56:26,922 --> 00:56:30,296
to Eddie the green
grocer, maybe even to God!

967
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:31,422
Jo: Diane, where
are you going?

968
00:56:31,465 --> 00:56:32,671
Diane: Merry Christmas.

969
00:56:32,714 --> 00:56:34,295
Come back and sit down.

970
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:35,671
Frankie, what's the
matter with you.

971
00:56:35,714 --> 00:56:37,379
Why'd you have to
upset her like that.

972
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:39,712
Diane? (sighing)

973
00:56:39,755 --> 00:56:42,340
I make a nice dinner
and look what happens.

974
00:57:12,425 --> 00:57:14,925
(phone beeping)

975
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:17,842
(phone ringing)

976
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,134
-Hello?
-Diane: Ma?

977
00:57:22,177 --> 00:57:24,508
-Yeah?-Did I wake you?

978
00:57:24,551 --> 00:57:26,218
Oh, no, I was
reading, what is it?

979
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:31,802
What Frank said at
dinner, you think it's true?

980
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,760
(sighing)

981
00:57:37,761 --> 00:57:42,843
You know, when I
go to the market,

982
00:57:42,887 --> 00:57:46,012
or the doctor's
office, or the park,

983
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:49,760
I talk to the other women,

984
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:52,219
they tell me about
their daughters,

985
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:57,594
how many grandchildren, how
much money their husbands make,

986
00:57:57,638 --> 00:58:00,179
I say to myself,
because I would never

987
00:58:00,222 --> 00:58:02,220
brag out loud, right?

988
00:58:02,264 --> 00:58:05,847
I say, "All right,

989
00:58:09,264 --> 00:58:13,305
"but my daughter,
she makes a difference".

990
00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:20,264
Did I tell you today
how much I love you?

991
00:58:20,308 --> 00:58:22,516
I love you, Mommy.

992
00:58:24,474 --> 00:58:26,723
I love you too, baby.

993
00:58:27,976 --> 00:58:29,307
Goodnight.

994
00:58:30,017 --> 00:58:32,766
Now keep strong.

995
00:58:35,142 --> 00:58:37,767
(sighing)

996
00:58:51,103 --> 00:58:52,476
(car starting)

997
00:58:59,727 --> 00:59:01,476
Man: Are you okay,
Mr. Gotti, are you all right?

998
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,185
Man 2:
Are you all right, Johnny?

999
00:59:03,229 --> 00:59:05,018
All rise.

1000
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:09,603
Be seated, please.

1001
00:59:13,812 --> 00:59:15,560
After this morning's violence,

1002
00:59:15,603 --> 00:59:18,395
it is evident to me that
the defendants in this case

1003
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:20,143
cannot be left at large.

1004
00:59:20,186 --> 00:59:23,311
I'm therefore revoking the
bail of all seven defendants.

1005
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:25,603
-(crowd talking)
-I object!

1006
00:59:25,646 --> 00:59:26,895
You are depriving
these defendants

1007
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,020
of their Constitutional rights.

1008
00:59:29,063 --> 00:59:31,938
Judge: Overruled, you
will be given 72 hours

1009
00:59:31,981 --> 00:59:33,229
to turn yourselves in at

1010
00:59:33,272 --> 00:59:35,188
the Metropolitan
Correctional Center.

1011
00:59:35,231 --> 00:59:36,896
Defendant's lawyer:
I demand to be heard!

1012
00:59:36,939 --> 00:59:40,771
Judge: In addition, I'm
adjourning these proceedings

1013
00:59:40,814 --> 00:59:44,856
until an anonymous jury can
be (drowned out by people)

1014
00:59:44,899 --> 00:59:46,314
(gavel banging)

1015
00:59:46,357 --> 00:59:47,731
Court adjourned!

1016
00:59:49,982 --> 00:59:53,648
(people talking)

1017
01:00:03,317 --> 01:00:04,439
Mr. Gotti, are you the head

1018
01:00:04,483 --> 01:00:06,482
of the Gambino Family?

1019
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,732
I'm the head of my own
family, my wife and my kids.

1020
01:00:10,775 --> 01:00:12,566
Nothing else.

1021
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,815
(reporters questioning)

1022
01:00:19,692 --> 01:00:23,401
Buy me a juror, I don't care
what it costs, get me one.

1023
01:00:23,444 --> 01:00:26,734
Johnny, I'll try,
but it's not so--

1024
01:00:26,778 --> 01:00:29,568
Don't try, do it.

1025
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:10,196
(car starting)

1026
01:01:20,574 --> 01:01:22,155
Radio announcer: A 49-year-old
unidentified man

1027
01:01:22,198 --> 01:01:23,447
went berserk last night,

1028
01:01:23,491 --> 01:01:25,447
opening fire with
a 12-gauge shotgun

1029
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:27,364
into a crowded
downtown restaurant.

1030
01:01:27,408 --> 01:01:29,696
14 people are dead,
including three children.

1031
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:31,989
Four others suffered
serious injuries.

1032
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:33,990
Police have a
suspect in custody,

1033
01:01:34,033 --> 01:01:35,740
and aren't releasing
any information

1034
01:01:35,783 --> 01:01:38,366
until they conclude
their investigation.

1035
01:01:58,869 --> 01:02:00,868
(tires squealing)

1036
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:16,911
(engine revving)

1037
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,577
(screaming)

1038
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,788
Diane: Oh, God, oh, God.

1039
01:02:29,539 --> 01:02:32,746
(tires squealing)

1040
01:02:39,163 --> 01:02:40,371
(glass shattering)

1041
01:02:40,414 --> 01:02:41,455
Man: Diane, stop, go man, go.

1042
01:02:41,498 --> 01:02:43,496
Diane, are you okay?

1043
01:02:43,539 --> 01:02:45,538
Diane: What's
the matter with you?

1044
01:02:45,581 --> 01:02:47,038
What are you doing?

1045
01:02:47,081 --> 01:02:48,205
Following you.

1046
01:02:48,249 --> 01:02:49,581
Diane: Why?

1047
01:02:49,624 --> 01:02:50,997
Judge's orders.

1048
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,455
Judge's orders?

1049
01:02:52,498 --> 01:02:53,872
You could have killed me!

1050
01:02:53,915 --> 01:02:55,373
What were you thinking?

1051
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:56,622
Hey, we were just trying
to take care of you.

1052
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:58,706
You're crazy, you're stupid!

1053
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:01,373
I'm gonna kill you!

1054
01:03:02,582 --> 01:03:06,748
Okay, think, opening
day in court.

1055
01:03:06,792 --> 01:03:07,832
Okay.

1056
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:10,207
Think like a juror.

1057
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:15,332
Okay, I'm thinking
stupid, naive, uninformed--

1058
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,749
What's the matter with you?

1059
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,916
This is important.

1060
01:03:18,959 --> 01:03:19,958
Okay.

1061
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:22,584
What do you think?

1062
01:03:23,335 --> 01:03:24,917
Uh.

1063
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:25,960
Too flashy.

1064
01:03:26,835 --> 01:03:27,751
Uh.

1065
01:03:28,419 --> 01:03:30,126
Too insincere.

1066
01:03:30,169 --> 01:03:31,418
Eh.

1067
01:03:31,461 --> 01:03:34,502
What, what, stop
with the uhhs!

1068
01:03:34,545 --> 01:03:36,044
Cassie: It's great.

1069
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:37,667
You think so?

1070
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:41,544
Yeah, it says, "I
know what I'm doing.

1071
01:03:41,587 --> 01:03:43,335
I'm not afraid of
these wise guys,

1072
01:03:43,379 --> 01:03:44,960
and you shouldn't be, either".

1073
01:03:45,003 --> 01:03:46,586
-Really?
-Really.

1074
01:03:49,794 --> 01:03:53,503
I hate it, I'm crazy,
I'm in way over my head,

1075
01:03:53,546 --> 01:03:55,669
I don't know what
I was thinking.

1076
01:03:55,713 --> 01:03:56,962
Oh, God.

1077
01:03:57,005 --> 01:03:58,628
You're gonna be fine,
you got a good case!

1078
01:03:58,671 --> 01:04:00,295
You got Argento.

1079
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:02,170
And they'll believe him.

1080
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,670
Why wouldn't they?

1081
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:05,170
Because he's a
murderer, a loan shark,

1082
01:04:05,214 --> 01:04:06,754
an extortionist, a thief.

1083
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:10,130
And you can prove
every syllable he says.

1084
01:04:10,173 --> 01:04:12,213
I can prove.

1085
01:04:12,256 --> 01:04:13,671
Or you wouldn't
put him on the stand.

1086
01:04:13,714 --> 01:04:15,296
-Or I wouldn't, that's right.
-That's right.

1087
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,672
That's right.

1088
01:04:16,715 --> 01:04:17,754
So what are you worried about?

1089
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:20,588
(sighing) Nothing.

1090
01:04:20,631 --> 01:04:22,504
Good, so you're
all set, right?

1091
01:04:22,548 --> 01:04:24,672
Yeah, I'm all set.

1092
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:28,048
I don't like this
dress, I hate it,

1093
01:04:28,091 --> 01:04:29,632
I should have never picked red.

1094
01:04:29,675 --> 01:04:32,505
Dragon ladies wear red.

1095
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:37,423
Bulls go for red,
what was I thinking?

1096
01:04:37,466 --> 01:04:43,131
On May 22nd, 1973,
at 11:00 o'clock at night,

1097
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:47,049
John Gotti and two other
men walked into a bar

1098
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:52,757
in Staten Island, and brutally
executed Jimmy Mcbratney.

1099
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:56,218
John Gotti plead guilty,
and served a prison term

1100
01:04:56,261 --> 01:04:57,674
for this crime.

1101
01:04:57,717 --> 01:05:01,258
So why am I bringing up
a 13 year old killing?

1102
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:03,259
Why isn't it over and done with?

1103
01:05:03,302 --> 01:05:04,968
Because like all
the other crimes

1104
01:05:05,011 --> 01:05:06,883
you are going to hear about,

1105
01:05:06,926 --> 01:05:11,800
the killing of Jimmy Mcbratney
was not an isolated event,

1106
01:05:11,843 --> 01:05:15,968
but part of a 20 year
pattern of criminal activity.

1107
01:05:16,011 --> 01:05:20,968
for a crime business
called the Gambino Family.

1108
01:05:21,011 --> 01:05:24,927
First we'll prove that the
crimes the defendant's committed

1109
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:29,552
were a part of the Gambino
Family crime business.

1110
01:05:29,595 --> 01:05:33,554
Second, we'll show you
surveillance photos

1111
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:36,429
of the defendant's at
their place of business,

1112
01:05:36,472 --> 01:05:38,720
The Bergen Social Club.

1113
01:05:38,764 --> 01:05:44,137
Third, by electronic
wire taps, bugs,

1114
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:49,679
you will hear the defendants
talk of their crimes.

1115
01:05:49,722 --> 01:05:53,805
And finally, by the
testimony of witnesses,

1116
01:05:53,848 --> 01:05:57,388
associates of the
defendants who committed

1117
01:05:57,432 --> 01:05:59,596
their crimes with them.

1118
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:05,598
This woman, the
prosecutor, the lady in red,

1119
01:06:05,641 --> 01:06:08,848
has told you a pack of
lies and half truths.

1120
01:06:08,892 --> 01:06:12,389
The truth is that the
government, with its bugs,

1121
01:06:12,433 --> 01:06:15,056
and wire taps, and
fancy equipment,

1122
01:06:15,099 --> 01:06:18,683
with its informants of nothing
but liars, and murderers,

1123
01:06:18,726 --> 01:06:23,933
and dope dealers, is
prosecuting John Gotti

1124
01:06:23,976 --> 01:06:26,766
because it doesn't like him.

1125
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,891
The government doesn't
like the way he dresses,

1126
01:06:28,934 --> 01:06:31,851
the way he talks on the
phone, or his friends!

1127
01:06:31,894 --> 01:06:34,849
But my God, in this country,
when you indict people

1128
01:06:34,893 --> 01:06:38,435
for their way of life,
there's something wrong!

1129
01:06:40,436 --> 01:06:44,020
This indictment is
rotten to the core.

1130
01:06:45,394 --> 01:06:49,018
If you make a stew with
bad meat, and bad carrots,

1131
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:53,267
and bad potatoes, and you put
on the fancy wine dressings

1132
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:56,978
that the government
does and call it RICO,

1133
01:06:57,021 --> 01:07:03,102
it still stinks, it still
is rancid, it's still rotten,

1134
01:07:03,145 --> 01:07:06,729
it still makes you
retch and vomit.

1135
01:07:08,398 --> 01:07:10,521
But you can stop it!

1136
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:16,730
You can take this indictment
and put it where it belongs.

1137
01:07:18,149 --> 01:07:22,523
(cheering and clapping)

1138
01:07:34,899 --> 01:07:39,899
(people murmuring)

1139
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,900
(car starting)

1140
01:07:57,859 --> 01:07:59,774
Diane: Well,
that was gruesome.

1141
01:07:59,817 --> 01:08:01,984
The judge has got
to get control fast,

1142
01:08:02,027 --> 01:08:03,567
otherwise it's gonna
turn into a street fight,

1143
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:04,734
-and we know...
-Frank: Diane!

1144
01:08:04,777 --> 01:08:06,775
Diane: ...who wins those.

1145
01:08:06,819 --> 01:08:09,900
Diane, do you know a
con named Harvey Sanders?

1146
01:08:09,943 --> 01:08:14,151
Yeah, he was on the inside
with Argento and the others.

1147
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:16,569
We considered using him,
but couldn't cross check

1148
01:08:16,611 --> 01:08:18,402
a single thing that he said.

1149
01:08:18,445 --> 01:08:19,651
But he called from the MCC,

1150
01:08:19,694 --> 01:08:21,777
says he's got
something to trade.

1151
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,069
I have what you might
call a showstopper.

1152
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:31,695
Diane: I'm listening.

1153
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:34,612
I heard Argento say
he's been lying to you.

1154
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:41,194
-You did, huh?
-Mm-hm, about everything.

1155
01:08:41,238 --> 01:08:44,821
See, and I thought I'd give this

1156
01:08:46,197 --> 01:08:51,779
important piece of information
to you, exclusively.

1157
01:08:51,823 --> 01:08:56,822
Not Bennett, or Santangelo,

1158
01:08:56,865 --> 01:08:59,614
or any of those other
defense attorneys.

1159
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:05,739
Well, I'm gonna go
to my office now,

1160
01:09:05,782 --> 01:09:08,864
and I'm gonna write down
everything that was said here,

1161
01:09:08,908 --> 01:09:13,532
and I'm gonna send a copy to
my boss, the U.S. Attorney,

1162
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,823
and to each of the
defendant's lawyers.

1163
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:22,074
That ain't too
smart, Miss Giacalone.

1164
01:09:22,117 --> 01:09:27,491
Isn't it a lot safer to have
me on the inside pissin' out,

1165
01:09:27,534 --> 01:09:30,866
then on the outside pissin' in?

1166
01:09:30,909 --> 01:09:35,450
Mr. Sanders, be a hell
of a lot safer for everyone

1167
01:09:35,494 --> 01:09:38,951
to keep you on
the inside. Period.

1168
01:09:38,994 --> 01:09:41,202
(giggling)

1169
01:09:42,036 --> 01:09:43,909
(balls banging)

1170
01:09:47,453 --> 01:09:51,367
Thing is, it's a put-up job.

1171
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:54,160
That bitch in the red dress,
she's got it in for Johnny,

1172
01:09:54,203 --> 01:09:55,826
has had for years.

1173
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:58,078
Look, I'm not even supposed
to be talkin' to you.

1174
01:09:58,121 --> 01:09:59,493
Hey, you're not doin' nothin'.

1175
01:09:59,537 --> 01:10:02,244
I'm the one doin'
all the talkin', huh?

1176
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:08,745
Anyway, this is the
figure we had in mind.

1177
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:11,621
More or less, give or take.

1178
01:10:11,664 --> 01:10:13,244
I don't know.

1179
01:10:13,287 --> 01:10:18,954
Hey, no pressure, you
don't have to decide now.

1180
01:10:18,997 --> 01:10:21,038
If you think we can do business,

1181
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:26,164
just wear this handkerchief
in your breast pocket.

1182
01:10:28,041 --> 01:10:30,539
It's 100% silk.

1183
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:36,040
You keep it either way.

1184
01:10:49,459 --> 01:10:54,667
(people talking)

1185
01:10:59,334 --> 01:11:00,792
Judge: Please be seated.

1186
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,583
Miss Giacalone, call
your first witness.

1187
01:11:05,627 --> 01:11:08,457
Diane: We call Vince Gritti.

1188
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:10,875
See, Johnny said he wanted
to do Carlo this big favor,

1189
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:13,792
because this Mcbratney
that they whacked

1190
01:11:13,835 --> 01:11:17,917
kidnapped Manny Gambino,
who is Carlo's nephew.

1191
01:11:17,961 --> 01:11:22,293
Diane: We call
Anthony Calabrese.

1192
01:11:22,337 --> 01:11:23,793
So the kid brings the envelope

1193
01:11:23,836 --> 01:11:25,710
to The Bergen like
he's supposed to,

1194
01:11:25,753 --> 01:11:27,293
except there's only
20 big ones in there,

1195
01:11:27,337 --> 01:11:30,377
and Johnny knows they
took 750 off of the truck.

1196
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:33,669
Diane: We call Sergeant
Detective Robert Teague.

1197
01:11:33,712 --> 01:11:36,712
Number three is
defendant Angelo Laforte.

1198
01:11:36,754 --> 01:11:39,336
Number four is John Gotti.

1199
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:42,129
Number five, don't know.

1200
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:45,087
Number six, Gene Gotti.

1201
01:11:45,131 --> 01:11:49,170
Number seven, Defendant
Luther Johnson.

1202
01:11:49,213 --> 01:11:51,796
Number eight, don't know.

1203
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,378
-Number nine, don't know.
-(crowd talking)

1204
01:11:53,421 --> 01:11:56,880
Diane: Your honor, I can
hardly hear my witness testify!

1205
01:11:56,923 --> 01:11:58,339
May we approach the bench?

1206
01:11:58,382 --> 01:12:00,047
No, tell them right here.

1207
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,129
Side bar, Your Honor?

1208
01:12:01,172 --> 01:12:03,672
(people laughing)

1209
01:12:07,965 --> 01:12:10,006
Diane: Your Honor, this
has been going on for weeks,

1210
01:12:10,049 --> 01:12:11,382
it's got to stop.

1211
01:12:11,425 --> 01:12:12,464
What is she talking about?

1212
01:12:12,507 --> 01:12:13,923
You know damn well, the noise.

1213
01:12:13,966 --> 01:12:17,257
Your Honor, I will not be
called a bitch in open court.

1214
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,299
I didn't hear that.

1215
01:12:18,342 --> 01:12:19,799
Well, I heard it.

1216
01:12:19,842 --> 01:12:22,007
Gentlemen, I admonish you.

1217
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,923
Your Honor, please,
in front of the jury.

1218
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:28,217
Miss Giacalone, the jury will
figure out what's going on.

1219
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:32,216
Now gentlemen, cool it!

1220
01:12:33,177 --> 01:12:38,134
(crowd murmuring)

1221
01:12:48,469 --> 01:12:50,509
Mmm, where's mine?

1222
01:12:50,552 --> 01:12:52,218
You didn't order anything.

1223
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,927
I've been ordering the
same thing for five weeks,

1224
01:12:55,969 --> 01:12:57,385
Chinese Chicken Salad.

1225
01:12:57,428 --> 01:13:00,343
But today, you didn't.

1226
01:13:00,387 --> 01:13:02,511
I can take witnesses that lie,

1227
01:13:02,553 --> 01:13:04,302
I can take defendants that die,

1228
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:06,052
but I cannot tolerate
the fact that

1229
01:13:06,095 --> 01:13:08,928
you didn't order me my
Chinese Chicken Salad!

1230
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:10,636
It's unbelievable!

1231
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:17,053
(laughing and talking)

1232
01:13:24,971 --> 01:13:27,179
Diane: He allowed them
to have lunch catered?

1233
01:13:27,223 --> 01:13:29,262
What's the big deal?

1234
01:13:29,306 --> 01:13:31,805
My God, my jury's
gonna think the mob owns

1235
01:13:31,849 --> 01:13:33,428
the building and
everybody in it.

1236
01:13:33,472 --> 01:13:35,638
They'll all be gone by the
time the jury comes back.

1237
01:13:35,681 --> 01:13:37,139
What are you kidding?

1238
01:13:37,182 --> 01:13:40,766
You can smell the garlic
from here to Cleveland.

1239
01:13:44,642 --> 01:13:47,807
(gavel banging)

1240
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,311
(sighing)

1241
01:15:01,064 --> 01:15:03,938
Now Mr. Argento,
you said you were at

1242
01:15:03,981 --> 01:15:08,187
The Bergen Hunt and Fish
Club on an almost daily basis

1243
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:11,898
between 1979 and
the middle of 1981.

1244
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:13,398
Is that correct?

1245
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:15,855
Yeah.

1246
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:18,939
Did you see and hear of
any loan sharking business

1247
01:15:18,982 --> 01:15:21,774
conducted in and
around The Bergen

1248
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:24,941
during that period of time?

1249
01:15:24,984 --> 01:15:26,647
Yeah.

1250
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:29,817
Whom did you see conducting
that loan sharking business?

1251
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:36,858
I seen Johnny, Angelo,
and his brother, Pete.

1252
01:15:36,901 --> 01:15:39,691
Genie and Joey, and
the other Johnny,

1253
01:15:39,734 --> 01:15:42,441
Willie Boy, and Arnold Pacara.

1254
01:15:42,485 --> 01:15:46,277
Indicating the main
defendants, among others.

1255
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,444
Yeah.

1256
01:15:48,528 --> 01:15:52,234
Mr. Argento do you recall
that in May of this year

1257
01:15:52,277 --> 01:15:54,775
you had conversations with me,

1258
01:15:54,819 --> 01:15:58,236
and with Paul Travisio, an
investigator that works with me?

1259
01:15:58,279 --> 01:15:59,860
Yeah, I recall it.

1260
01:16:01,069 --> 01:16:03,861
And in the course of
those conversations,

1261
01:16:05,779 --> 01:16:09,152
do you recall saying
that you were locked in,

1262
01:16:09,196 --> 01:16:13,027
that if you didn't testify
for the government,

1263
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:17,070
then you had a problem being
prosecuted in other cases?

1264
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,778
Angelo: Exactly.

1265
01:16:18,822 --> 01:16:22,819
And, that Miss
Giacalone threatened you,

1266
01:16:22,863 --> 01:16:25,029
threatened you with the RICO.

1267
01:16:25,072 --> 01:16:26,778
Yeah.

1268
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:28,779
Now did you also indicate
to us that the image

1269
01:16:28,823 --> 01:16:31,237
that Miss Giacalone
presents in the courtroom

1270
01:16:31,281 --> 01:16:32,571
has nothing to do with reality.

1271
01:16:32,614 --> 01:16:34,613
Now, in your own
words, not mine,

1272
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,864
and I apologize to the jury,

1273
01:16:38,572 --> 01:16:43,198
I see her outside the
courtroom, and she's a slut!

1274
01:16:43,241 --> 01:16:47,866
(people laughing)

1275
01:16:49,617 --> 01:16:52,323
Did you say that?

1276
01:16:52,367 --> 01:16:53,656
I might have said that, yeah.

1277
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,823
(people laughing)

1278
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:58,491
Defendant's lawyer: I
have no more questions.

1279
01:16:58,534 --> 01:17:01,117
Judge: Court adjourned
until tomorrow morning.

1280
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,950
Judge: All rise.

1281
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:15,409
(crowd cat-calling)

1282
01:17:16,702 --> 01:17:20,367
Don't you touch her, you
keep your hands off her!

1283
01:17:20,411 --> 01:17:24,577
(typewriter clacking)

1284
01:17:40,246 --> 01:17:42,371
Judge: Be seated, please.

1285
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:49,536
Judge: Is the defense ready?

1286
01:17:49,579 --> 01:17:50,579
Defendant's lawyer:
Yes, Your Honor.

1287
01:17:50,622 --> 01:17:53,121
The defense calls
Harvey Sanders.

1288
01:17:56,831 --> 01:17:58,579
(door closing)

1289
01:18:02,456 --> 01:18:03,747
Lawyer: Raise your right hand.

1290
01:18:04,706 --> 01:18:06,830
You see, she told
me it didn't matter

1291
01:18:06,874 --> 01:18:08,913
if I knew him, or
I didn't know him.

1292
01:18:08,957 --> 01:18:10,955
If I lied or if I didn't lie.

1293
01:18:10,998 --> 01:18:13,706
She said that if I
was willing to lie,

1294
01:18:13,749 --> 01:18:15,414
that she would fix
up what I had to say,

1295
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:16,748
and I would work with her,

1296
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:18,456
and she would work
on gettin' me out.

1297
01:18:18,499 --> 01:18:19,288
Defendant's lawyer:
So you did.

1298
01:18:19,332 --> 01:18:21,748
Mm-hmm, yeah, sure.

1299
01:18:21,791 --> 01:18:23,789
Defendant's lawyer:
What happened then?

1300
01:18:23,833 --> 01:18:26,206
Well she went ahead
with the whole deal.

1301
01:18:26,249 --> 01:18:27,915
I mean she wanted
to frame Mr. Gotti

1302
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:30,415
and anybody else
on trial with him.

1303
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:32,831
She said she had
other witnesses,

1304
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,623
she was gonna put me
with them, Argento.

1305
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:38,123
Did you tell her
you knew nothing about

1306
01:18:38,166 --> 01:18:40,666
the predicate act alleged
in this indictment?

1307
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:44,541
Okay, see, well,
what happened is, see,

1308
01:18:44,584 --> 01:18:48,124
I went along with her to
a certain point, okay?

1309
01:18:48,167 --> 01:18:51,791
But actually, her putting me
with Argento did more damage

1310
01:18:51,834 --> 01:18:53,876
to her getting me to go along
with her lies than anything else

1311
01:18:53,919 --> 01:18:57,501
because Argento had already
implicated to me

1312
01:18:57,544 --> 01:19:01,167
that practically everything
he was saying was a lie.

1313
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:04,252
Hmm, she gave me
everything I wanted.

1314
01:19:04,295 --> 01:19:06,750
Ha, I mean, everything.

1315
01:19:06,794 --> 01:19:09,002
She even gave me her
own panties with which

1316
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:12,835
to facilitate myself
with. (giggling)

1317
01:19:12,879 --> 01:19:15,544
When I wanted to
get laid, she said,

1318
01:19:15,587 --> 01:19:18,794
"I couldn't possibly get a
woman in there with you".

1319
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:21,921
So I said, "How about
a police chick?"

1320
01:19:21,963 --> 01:19:27,961
Mmm, and she started
laughin'. (giggling)

1321
01:19:28,005 --> 01:19:30,213
And she reached into the
bottom drawer of her desk,

1322
01:19:30,256 --> 01:19:32,296
and she threw her panties at me.

1323
01:19:32,339 --> 01:19:35,296
(people laughing)

1324
01:19:40,673 --> 01:19:42,588
Defendant's lawyer:
I have no more questions.

1325
01:19:42,632 --> 01:19:46,214
Judge: Does the government
have any cross examination?

1326
01:19:46,258 --> 01:19:48,464
Yes, Your Honor.

1327
01:19:57,883 --> 01:20:00,548
Mr. Sanders, where
did this transfer

1328
01:20:00,591 --> 01:20:02,923
of underwear take place?

1329
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:06,133
You remember, Diane,
it was in your office.

1330
01:20:07,925 --> 01:20:11,217
What kind of desk do
I have, Mr. Sanders?

1331
01:20:13,759 --> 01:20:15,092
A desk.

1332
01:20:17,051 --> 01:20:19,052
Is it metal or wooden?

1333
01:20:19,886 --> 01:20:21,676
I don't remember.

1334
01:20:22,635 --> 01:20:24,592
Diane: And the chair
you were sitting in?

1335
01:20:24,635 --> 01:20:27,051
Was that metal or wooden?

1336
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:29,217
I don't remember.

1337
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:32,634
(people laughing)

1338
01:20:32,677 --> 01:20:36,885
Diane, what is he handing you?

1339
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,844
You gonna ask the
question or what?

1340
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:51,720
I mean, Grandma was slow,
but she was old, ya know?

1341
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:52,929
Let's go.

1342
01:20:54,554 --> 01:20:57,095
How many windows in my office?

1343
01:20:57,139 --> 01:20:58,970
Two.

1344
01:21:00,181 --> 01:21:02,720
One on this wall,
and one on this wall?

1345
01:21:02,764 --> 01:21:04,345
No, two on each
wall, I meant four.

1346
01:21:04,388 --> 01:21:06,014
What are you holding there?

1347
01:21:08,182 --> 01:21:09,972
How many doors in my office?

1348
01:21:10,015 --> 01:21:11,721
One.

1349
01:21:11,764 --> 01:21:15,597
And are my walls painted,
paneled, wallpapered?

1350
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,513
Painted. (laughing)

1351
01:21:17,556 --> 01:21:20,681
Mr. Sanders, would it
surprise you to learn

1352
01:21:20,724 --> 01:21:23,640
that my office is wood paneled.

1353
01:21:23,683 --> 01:21:27,347
No, I remember now.

1354
01:21:27,391 --> 01:21:29,181
Diane: Would it
surprise you to learn

1355
01:21:29,225 --> 01:21:31,474
that I have two doors
in my office and not one

1356
01:21:31,518 --> 01:21:33,181
as you've just said?

1357
01:21:33,224 --> 01:21:37,058
Diane, you're lying to me
now, no office has two doors.

1358
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:39,806
(people murmuring)

1359
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:41,848
Would it surprise
you, Mr. Sanders,

1360
01:21:41,891 --> 01:21:45,558
to learn that I have only
two windows in my office,

1361
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,724
and not four as
you've just said?

1362
01:21:47,768 --> 01:21:49,434
Stop mixing me up.

1363
01:21:50,643 --> 01:21:53,767
Mr. Sanders, were
you ever in my office?

1364
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:55,684
Mr. Sanders: That's where
you threw your panties at me.

1365
01:21:55,727 --> 01:21:58,684
Were you ever in my
office, Mr. Sanders?

1366
01:21:58,728 --> 01:21:59,852
That's where you
threw your panties.

1367
01:21:59,895 --> 01:22:01,184
What floor is it on?

1368
01:22:01,227 --> 01:22:03,392
What does it look
like in the hallways?

1369
01:22:03,435 --> 01:22:06,101
Do you have to turn right
or left to enter my office?

1370
01:22:06,144 --> 01:22:07,351
I don't remember that stuff.

1371
01:22:07,395 --> 01:22:08,935
(people murmuring)

1372
01:22:08,979 --> 01:22:11,310
Is my secretary
a man or a woman?

1373
01:22:11,352 --> 01:22:12,935
Let me see those pictures.

1374
01:22:12,978 --> 01:22:14,560
Is there a kitchen,
is there a library?

1375
01:22:14,604 --> 01:22:17,352
-May I
-(men talking)

1376
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:19,435
look at the pictures, please?

1377
01:22:19,479 --> 01:22:21,061
(men arguing)

1378
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:24,311
No more questions for
this witness, Your Honor.

1379
01:22:24,355 --> 01:22:28,896
(men arguing)

1380
01:22:31,105 --> 01:22:32,395
Judge: Order in the court!

1381
01:22:32,438 --> 01:22:36,854
(men arguing)

1382
01:22:44,481 --> 01:22:45,980
Diane: Ladies and gentlemen,

1383
01:22:46,023 --> 01:22:48,063
the first question to be
addressed is whether or not

1384
01:22:48,106 --> 01:22:50,980
the Gambino Crime Family exists,

1385
01:22:51,023 --> 01:22:53,022
or is it a fantasy?

1386
01:22:53,065 --> 01:22:56,606
That is what Mr. Bennett said
in his opening statement,

1387
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:58,773
that it was a fantasy.

1388
01:22:58,816 --> 01:23:01,064
The evidence, ladies
and gentlemen,

1389
01:23:01,107 --> 01:23:03,690
show that it is not a fantasy,

1390
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:06,107
but a frightening reality.

1391
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:09,065
And you and I have been
here for the past six months

1392
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:14,774
because these men are a part
of the Gambino Crime Family.

1393
01:23:14,817 --> 01:23:17,275
As the judge will instruct you,

1394
01:23:17,317 --> 01:23:19,524
the burden of proof
is on the government,

1395
01:23:19,567 --> 01:23:23,482
and I have taken you through
that proof step by step.

1396
01:23:23,526 --> 01:23:27,151
But what has been the
defense in this case?

1397
01:23:27,194 --> 01:23:28,984
Harvey Sanders?

1398
01:23:29,027 --> 01:23:31,943
Harvey Sanders testified,
among other things,

1399
01:23:33,318 --> 01:23:35,901
that the prosecutors
told him to lie,

1400
01:23:35,945 --> 01:23:38,735
that I told him to lie.

1401
01:23:38,778 --> 01:23:41,403
They've attacked the
credibility of virtually

1402
01:23:41,446 --> 01:23:44,027
every government witness.

1403
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:47,027
You heard Harvey Sanders,

1404
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:49,820
and then you heard all the
government witnesses say

1405
01:23:49,863 --> 01:23:52,403
it was Harvey Sanders who lied.

1406
01:23:52,446 --> 01:23:54,528
Who do you believe?

1407
01:23:54,571 --> 01:23:56,986
Because that was the defense.

1408
01:23:57,030 --> 01:24:01,444
Everyone lied, everyone
was willing to compromise

1409
01:24:01,487 --> 01:24:04,070
their integrity,
not just one person,

1410
01:24:04,114 --> 01:24:06,445
or two people, everyone?

1411
01:24:06,488 --> 01:24:09,320
Yo, can you talk
a little louder?

1412
01:24:09,364 --> 01:24:11,613
We can't hear all the lies
your telling the jury.

1413
01:24:11,657 --> 01:24:14,989
(men laughing)

1414
01:24:17,282 --> 01:24:20,697
Don't worry, honey,
you're doin' just fine.

1415
01:24:22,782 --> 01:24:25,448
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

1416
01:24:25,491 --> 01:24:28,947
you may retire to
consider your verdict.

1417
01:24:47,035 --> 01:24:51,617
(people talking)

1418
01:24:57,202 --> 01:24:59,575
Will you listen to
what I'm telling you?

1419
01:24:59,618 --> 01:25:01,743
Mrs. Fabritzio's son is a judge,

1420
01:25:01,787 --> 01:25:03,368
he said it was
the best summation

1421
01:25:03,411 --> 01:25:06,868
he had heard in 20 years.
A judge!

1422
01:25:06,912 --> 01:25:09,992
If it's the compressor,
I think we should just

1423
01:25:10,035 --> 01:25:14,035
buy you a new refrigerator,
it doesn't pay to fix it.

1424
01:25:14,078 --> 01:25:17,660
(machine whirring)

1425
01:25:17,703 --> 01:25:19,993
You like the white ones
or the pastel ones?

1426
01:25:20,036 --> 01:25:23,328
Personally, I think
the pastels are tacky.

1427
01:25:23,372 --> 01:25:25,036
Is it all right
if I ask you about

1428
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,994
any man you might
be seeing, hmm?

1429
01:25:28,038 --> 01:25:29,786
Also, I think we
should get the one

1430
01:25:29,829 --> 01:25:33,579
with the automatic ice
maker in the front.

1431
01:25:33,623 --> 01:25:35,621
Maybe you could give
me a list of topics

1432
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:37,704
I'm allowed to talk about, huh?

1433
01:25:37,747 --> 01:25:40,662
Major appliances.

1434
01:25:40,706 --> 01:25:42,246
I'm tellin' you,
everybody's so sure

1435
01:25:42,290 --> 01:25:43,913
it's gonna be a conviction,

1436
01:25:43,956 --> 01:25:46,371
I oughta lay two to one just
to get a bet down, ya know?

1437
01:25:46,414 --> 01:25:49,789
But, what are you gonna do?

1438
01:25:51,541 --> 01:25:52,996
It's not about makin' a killin',

1439
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:56,207
it's about supporting
my sis, right?

1440
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:57,541
Right?

1441
01:25:58,666 --> 01:26:02,497
So, tell me, it's
a lock, ain't it?

1442
01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:05,582
It's all locked up, right?

1443
01:26:05,624 --> 01:26:10,999
Okay, okay, just
answer me one question.

1444
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:12,498
How come you keep
your underwears

1445
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,084
in your office drawer?

1446
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:17,832
What's the matter with
you talking like that.

1447
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:20,000
Diane, that was
supposed to be a joke.

1448
01:26:20,043 --> 01:26:21,792
-It's not funny!
-Diane, please.

1449
01:26:21,835 --> 01:26:23,500
Diane: It's not a joke!

1450
01:26:23,543 --> 01:26:25,458
Diane, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, Diane!

1451
01:26:25,501 --> 01:26:29,292
Diane, Diane, Diane,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1452
01:26:29,335 --> 01:26:34,293
(crying) You're my brother,
you're my only brother.

1453
01:26:36,878 --> 01:26:40,919
Those jerks, those
dirty rotten jerks.

1454
01:26:43,044 --> 01:26:44,794
Judge: All rise, please.

1455
01:26:54,587 --> 01:26:56,920
Please be seated.

1456
01:27:06,714 --> 01:27:10,712
Will the defendants
please rise.

1457
01:27:23,383 --> 01:27:25,923
Please read the verdicts.

1458
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:31,214
We the jury, in the case
of defendant John Gotti,

1459
01:27:31,257 --> 01:27:35,964
count one, conspiracy, find
the defendant not guilty.

1460
01:27:36,007 --> 01:27:40,967
(cheering)

1461
01:27:55,801 --> 01:28:00,467
Count two, find the defendant,
John Gotti, not guilty.

1462
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:05,467
(cheering)

1463
01:28:27,096 --> 01:28:28,928
(Diane sighing)

1464
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:41,055
No beer.

1465
01:28:41,723 --> 01:28:45,054
(people murmuring)

1466
01:28:45,096 --> 01:28:48,471
So, somebody was supposed to
buy some beer for this party?

1467
01:28:48,515 --> 01:28:49,845
Oh, that is my fault.

1468
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,638
I was just about to
order some when we heard

1469
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,222
the jury was coming
in, I'm sorry.

1470
01:28:53,266 --> 01:28:54,388
It's okay, I'll do it.

1471
01:28:54,431 --> 01:28:55,180
No, no, sit
down, let me do it.

1472
01:28:55,224 --> 01:28:56,389
I'll do it.

1473
01:28:56,433 --> 01:28:57,555
But I want to.

1474
01:28:57,598 --> 01:29:00,514
It's okay, I'll do it.

1475
01:29:02,932 --> 01:29:05,931
Hey, hey, I got news!

1476
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:07,681
I've had about all
the news I can take

1477
01:29:07,724 --> 01:29:09,264
for one day, thank
you very much.

1478
01:29:09,307 --> 01:29:12,265
Well, it's not really
news, more like gossip.

1479
01:29:12,309 --> 01:29:14,891
But it's all over the building!

1480
01:29:14,934 --> 01:29:16,391
A fix was in.

1481
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,015
Diane: I knew it!

1482
01:29:18,058 --> 01:29:20,767
One of the jurors, one of
the jurors (talking quietly)

1483
01:29:22,393 --> 01:29:23,766
Diane, did you hear that?

1484
01:29:23,809 --> 01:29:25,142
They're saying Gotti
bought a juror.

1485
01:29:25,185 --> 01:29:27,183
Diane, that
explains everything,

1486
01:29:27,226 --> 01:29:29,766
you made a brilliant
case, it was inconceivable

1487
01:29:29,809 --> 01:29:31,851
this jury should
come in not guilty!

1488
01:29:31,894 --> 01:29:33,226
Well, now we know why.

1489
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:33,809
No!

1490
01:29:34,978 --> 01:29:37,642
I don't believe it,
and I won't believe it.

1491
01:29:37,686 --> 01:29:39,350
What are you saying?

1492
01:29:39,394 --> 01:29:42,559
I put seven years in on
this case, seven years.

1493
01:29:42,602 --> 01:29:46,977
Witnesses, depositions,
motions, more motions,

1494
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:50,185
typing transcripts until
two in the morning.

1495
01:29:50,229 --> 01:29:53,602
Fighting, yelling,
begging, pleading.

1496
01:29:53,646 --> 01:29:55,020
Seven years!

1497
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:58,020
But we lost, okay?

1498
01:29:59,396 --> 01:30:03,021
The jury didn't believe
our witnesses, it happens.

1499
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:04,854
It's part of the system.

1500
01:30:06,021 --> 01:30:09,062
And juries come in
wrong all the time.

1501
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:16,106
But if it was fixed?

1502
01:30:18,524 --> 01:30:21,064
If they bought the jury?

1503
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:25,104
Well, we never had a chance.

1504
01:30:25,147 --> 01:30:28,355
Those seven years we put
in was a waste of time--

1505
01:30:28,398 --> 01:30:31,814
David: I don't buy
that, I just don't buy it.

1506
01:30:31,857 --> 01:30:34,980
David, somebody
else'll nail Gotti.

1507
01:30:35,024 --> 01:30:37,897
He's stupid, he's arrogant,
and somebody'll put him away.

1508
01:30:37,941 --> 01:30:39,897
Gotti's not important.

1509
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:44,816
The juror who took the
money, oh, he's important.

1510
01:30:44,860 --> 01:30:47,440
Because he lets Gotti exist,

1511
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:51,649
and he's the one who
brings down the system.

1512
01:30:54,151 --> 01:30:58,358
And that's what this case
was from the very beginning,

1513
01:30:59,692 --> 01:31:03,526
the system versus the street.

1514
01:31:03,569 --> 01:31:06,193
And if they bought the jury,

1515
01:31:10,195 --> 01:31:15,235
the street won, and
the people lost.

1516
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:31,111
Voiceover: In May of 1992,
largely on the testimony

1517
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:34,985
of government witness
Sammy "the Bull" Gravano,

1518
01:31:35,029 --> 01:31:39,611
John Gotti was convicted
of multiple crimes.

1519
01:31:39,655 --> 01:31:41,319
He is currently
serving a life sentence

1520
01:31:41,363 --> 01:31:45,445
in the federal prison
at Marion, Illinois.

1521
01:31:45,489 --> 01:31:48,112
The foreman of the 1987 jury,

1522
01:31:48,155 --> 01:31:51,445
which acquitted him, was
indicted and convicted

1523
01:31:51,489 --> 01:31:55,821
of accepting a
65,000 dollar bribe.

1524
01:31:55,865 --> 01:32:00,572
Harvey Sanders was
found guilty of perjury.

1525
01:32:00,616 --> 01:32:04,322
In 1988, Wilford
"Willie Boy" Johnson,

1526
01:32:04,365 --> 01:32:07,530
the defendantand FBI informant,

1527
01:32:07,574 --> 01:32:12,198
having refused federal
protection, was murdered.

1528
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:15,031
Diane Giacalone moved to thePolitical Corruption Unit

1529
01:32:15,074 --> 01:32:17,823
of the United States
Attorney’s Office.

1530
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:21,949
In 1990, she left
public service.
