1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Subs created by: David Coleman.

2
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:07,854
She's really pissed off.

3
00:00:07,855 --> 00:00:10,795
Panic and confusion.

4
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:14,261
I turned around and whoomp.

5
00:00:14,262 --> 00:00:16,156
Definitely an impact.

6
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:17,723
Had a heart attack and that was it.

7
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:19,931
I see pools of blood.

8
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:21,521
People were quitting on me left and right.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,108
You don't want to walk through the door.

10
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,982
He came behind me, trying to grab my back.

11
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:30,703
They came to watch a boy die.

12
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:35,600
There's something down there.

13
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:38,721
My name is Amy Allan.

14
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,763
A lot of dead people are here.

15
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:42,864
I see dead people..

16
00:00:42,865 --> 00:00:44,399
This is not good.

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,601
I speak to dead people..

18
00:00:46,602 --> 00:00:48,503
He is very pissed off.

19
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:49,871
And they speak to me.

20
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:51,373
The house is angry.

21
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:54,381
But there's only way to know
if my findings are real.

22
00:00:54,382 --> 00:00:56,580
He's killed people.

23
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:57,782
I rely on my partner.

24
00:00:57,783 --> 00:00:59,250
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

25
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,319
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,887
He got shot at his house?

27
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:05,790
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

28
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,358
Aren't you terrified, being here?

29
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,644
It's my job to reveal 'em.

30
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:10,728
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist".

31
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:12,863
But Steve and I never speak..

32
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,799
We never communicate
during an investigation..

33
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,134
Until the very end..

34
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:17,402
It's bad.

35
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:19,470
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

36
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:20,939
I'd like some answers.

37
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,940
Or time to get out.

38
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:48,339
Amy and I remain completely
separate during our investigations.

39
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,544
I gather the facts through research
and interviews with key witnesses.

40
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:55,642
After we're done..

41
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:58,398
We'll meet with our clients to
disclose our findings to them..

42
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,711
And to each other for the first time.

43
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:06,490
I'm just about an hour North of New York
City in a small town called Carmel.

44
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:08,649
I'm on my way to meet
with a guy named Anthony

45
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:12,768
who works Security at a
restaurant called Smalley's Inn.

46
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:14,235
Anthony's a tough guy.

47
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:16,091
I can tell just by the way he talks.

48
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:19,260
But he's so scared about the things
that are happening in the restaurant,

49
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:22,861
he's thinking about quitting.

50
00:02:31,013 --> 00:02:36,527
This restaurant contains a lot of
photographs and personal items.

51
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:38,391
So I have to be careful to remove or cover

52
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:43,132
anything that could
influence Amy's findings.

53
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:46,360
Once the location is cleared.

54
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:49,601
Amy can begin her walk.

55
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,580
I saw..

56
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:18,928
This female.

57
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:22,599
And I've seen her before at home.

58
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,470
It was her and two men..

59
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,351
Surrounding my bed.

60
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:31,993
And they were trying to kill me.

61
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:35,211
Whether I'm at home or
traveling to a location,

62
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:37,779
the dead know I'm coming long before I do.

63
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,206
So sometimes they'll appear
to me days before my walk.

64
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:45,996
And if they feel threatened, they'll
try and stop me any way they can.

65
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:49,036
She was, like, white and transparent.

66
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:52,337
And she really hates me.

67
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:57,962
She's here.

68
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:04,392
She seems to cause..

69
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,841
Death.

70
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:19,959
- Anthony.
- Hey, Steve. How you doing?

71
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,512
Good to meet you.

72
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:23,541
When we spoke on the phone, you
sounded a little concerned.

73
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,544
- Yes.
- Um, what.. What's going on here?

74
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:27,842
A lot of things are happening here.

75
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:30,062
I've seen apparitions.

76
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:32,427
I've seen things getting
pushed off a table.

77
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,841
I have been shoved from behind.

78
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,295
- You're kidding.
- Swear to God.

79
00:04:36,296 --> 00:04:39,598
I hate to say that I'm scared, but, yeah.

80
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:43,755
I grew up in the streets of the Bronx,
and I had a gun pointed at my head..

81
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:45,345
But it's when you can't see the stuff

82
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:46,735
- that it will drive you crazy.
- Yeah.

83
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:50,038
You don't want to walk through
the door to come to work.

84
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,940
I know exactly how Anthony feels.

85
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,976
I've been in a few shootouts myself.

86
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:57,982
But I think if I ever actually saw a
ghost, it'd scare the hell outta me.

87
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,993
All right, so this is
actually hurting your income.

88
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:02,184
Yes. I've cut my hours down, yes.

89
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:04,706
I need to support my wife and three kids.

90
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:08,667
I can't afford to lose this job.

91
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,843
She cries.

92
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,413
Really nasty.

93
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:19,554
She is..

94
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:21,415
What..

95
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,956
People would call a Banshee.

96
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,627
Most people have heard of
Banshees from Irish folklore.

97
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,362
They're actually a kind of omen.

98
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,864
If you hear one, someone you love will die.

99
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:37,185
If you see one, you are going to die.

100
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:40,338
You all right?

101
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:42,624
No.

102
00:05:53,072 --> 00:05:56,451
She's happy causing chaos.

103
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:58,763
She really hates..

104
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:01,284
Living people.

105
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,802
It's really strange.

106
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:08,239
I think she's here.

107
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,220
Where?

108
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,009
Downstairs.

109
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:30,980
This is why I cut.. I cut my hours.

110
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:33,497
- Because of the basement?
- Yeah.

111
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:35,206
All right, can you show me?

112
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:38,267
All right. Let's go.

113
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:40,646
Watch your head.

114
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:42,507
Wow.

115
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,290
All right.

116
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,369
All right. So happened to you down here?

117
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,458
One of the barmaids asked
me to get, uh, some ice.

118
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,213
Okay.

119
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:01,828
And I came down here.

120
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,877
I reached about where the ice machine is..

121
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:06,977
And a woman that was, very like, proper..

122
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,914
Uh, whispered something in my ear.

123
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:11,719
I turned around, and whoomp..

124
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,212
I got tossed.

125
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:14,625
I mean, God, I'm a big guy.

126
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:17,606
Yeah. I mean, I got 210.
You gotta be at least 275, 280, right?

127
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:19,213
Easy, easy.

128
00:07:19,214 --> 00:07:22,745
It threw me Back here. And, um..

129
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:25,874
She walked right by me.

130
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,462
She doesn't make eye contact
or nothing like that..

131
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:31,094
Nothing. Like I'm not even there. Like..
Like she does it every day. Like every..

132
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:35,475
This.. This is where she belongs to go.

133
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:46,075
Mm. I just felt like that kind
of bash-in-the-head thing.

134
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:47,410
Ow.

135
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:51,255
Someone here has caused a
great deal of physical pain.

136
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:54,351
And now I can feel it
running all across my body.

137
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:58,021
And I have this, like, pain, like, whoa.

138
00:07:58,022 --> 00:07:59,822
Ow.

139
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:01,218
(Bleep)

140
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:04,219
Definitely an impact.

141
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:11,193
Describe the way the woman looked.

142
00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:14,476
She was dressed, like, in the 1800s look..
The big puffy dress..

143
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:16,242
- Okay.
- Nice hat.

144
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:17,410
What color was her hair?

145
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:20,057
Blondish, and I could see through her.

146
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:21,559
What'd you do?

147
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,077
I took off like a bat outta hell.

148
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:25,938
Wow.

149
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,734
She's..

150
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:32,423
Up in everybody's (Bleep).

151
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,724
She's really pissed off.

152
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:38,393
And she..

153
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,964
Sees an opening and takes advantage of it.

154
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:45,805
It's like revenge, seek revenge.

155
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:51,252
So what else have you seen down here?

156
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:53,890
I've seen, um, a male apparition.

157
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,082
And the same (Bleep).

158
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,436
I came down here to get some liquor,

159
00:08:57,437 --> 00:09:00,236
and I almost struck..
Like, bumped into him.

160
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:02,942
Like, I thought it was a customer.

161
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,443
Can you describe the guy to me?

162
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,394
Yes, the hat was half on.

163
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:09,415
Curly white hair, jacket.

164
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,331
The ruffles in the shirt.

165
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:14,750
And I'm.. And I'm ready to pop him, I'm
ready, you know, to smash this guy, and..

166
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,949
He went that way.

167
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:19,370
I went after him. Nothing.

168
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:20,537
Gone.

169
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:22,877
And now I know this is theirs.

170
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:24,106
I don't belong down here.

171
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:26,175
- If that happened to me..
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:28,561
I don't know if I could even come
back down in the basement like this.

173
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:29,708
Well, I don't.

174
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,210
And there goes my pay.

175
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:35,711
And there goes putting food on the table.

176
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,878
There's a man in uniform down here.

177
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,939
What kind of uniform?

178
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,448
He's wearing, like, a poufy outfit.

179
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:55,838
With, like, it comes out.

180
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,719
The arms come out.

181
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:02,228
Then a rifle with a, uh..

182
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:04,381
Could cut.. Kill you.

183
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:05,747
Like a knife on the end?

184
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:07,848
Mm-hmm.

185
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:12,851
But I don't feel good about it.

186
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,284
Because he made me feel uncomfortable

187
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,627
when I was walking down the stairs.
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:27,328
He feels like maybe the
basement's his area or something.

189
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:30,872
He follows people. He likes to intimidate.

190
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:33,810
It's all, like, sneak
attacks, though, for him.

191
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:38,551
Sneaky in the dark,
sneaky behind your back.

192
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:46,322
He gives off panic and confusion.

193
00:10:46,323 --> 00:10:48,963
Makes me feel..

194
00:10:50,193 --> 00:10:52,233
Scared.

195
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:04,921
Mm. I just got, like,
this really angry male.

196
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:07,605
He makes me feel..

197
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:09,646
Scared.

198
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:18,215
The vibe he gives off is
this panic and confusion.

199
00:11:20,342 --> 00:11:22,943
He's not confused, but he
kind of puts that out there.

200
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:25,484
You know what I mean? Like..

201
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,945
That feeling.

202
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,441
Very intimidating.
I don't know what his problem is.

203
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:34,150
And I don't know why he's still here..

204
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:37,511
Or even how he got here.

205
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:50,727
Now I understand there's a lot of
strange things going on in this place.

206
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:53,464
Have you experienced anything?

207
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:56,360
I've seen, uh, an apparition at the bar..

208
00:11:56,361 --> 00:11:57,928
A man wearing a suit and a tie.

209
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,484
I couldn't see his face.

210
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,213
There used to be some video
games next to the bar.

211
00:12:02,214 --> 00:12:05,256
When you played the video game,
you'd see another face..

212
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,808
Looking out at you.

213
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,442
And you're just thinking, all
right, someone's looking over

214
00:12:08,443 --> 00:12:10,572
my shoulder and seeing what I'm
doing with this video game.

215
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:13,969
And then you'd take a break,
and that person's not there.

216
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,623
And a lot of times when I tell these
stories, the hair on my arm..

217
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:18,981
I just get goosebumps.

218
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:20,464
I can see 'em.

219
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:24,468
Tony, are you concerned that business
is hurt by any of these stories?

220
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:26,802
- It did scare off a lot of customers.
- Okay.

221
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:30,783
People have got tugged on their
sleeves, pulled on their aprons..

222
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:35,164
Tapped on the shoulder, stuff like that.

223
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:40,052
Oh, what happened?

224
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:43,423
I don't know.
He came behind me and was, like..

225
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:46,664
Trying to grab my back.

226
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:55,927
It feels like this soldier guy..

227
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:58,874
Or Captain, whatever he is.

228
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,605
I don't know, he's hiding.

229
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:02,954
- Hmm.
- Do you know where he went?

230
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:04,755
No.

231
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,546
This angry soldier doesn't
like me wandering around.

232
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:13,027
He's already attacked me once, and
I'm concerned he'll do it again.

233
00:13:13,028 --> 00:13:15,368
Hmm. Weird.

234
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,566
He's just..

235
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,607
Hiding.

236
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,690
People were quitting on me left and right.

237
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:26,724
A girl was getting ice
from the ice machine.

238
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,733
She glanced off into the back
where the liquor cabinet is..

239
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:33,995
And noticed a soldier standing
there, looking at her.

240
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:35,794
So did she describe what she saw?

241
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:40,277
A blue uniform with a yellow stripe
going down the, uh, side of the pants.

242
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,396
So civil war or an.. An..
An older army uniform.

243
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:44,281
Yes.

244
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,010
- The girl quit that night.
- She did?

245
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:47,285
- Yeah.
- Okay.

246
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,565
Did anything like that happen to
anybody else that worked for you?

247
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:52,900
Yeah, I had one waitress, and
she got tormented a lot.

248
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,700
In what way? Anything in particular?

249
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,858
Things getting thrown at her.

250
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:58,839
The ice scoop from the ice machine
was actually thrown at her.

251
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,707
Is she around so I could talk to her?

252
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:03,711
No, no. She's no longer with us.

253
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,267
She died?

254
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:08,723
Yeah. She passed, uh, prematurely..

255
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,417
And by accident.

256
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:14,984
So, Tony, Mr. Smalley, I assume, who the
restaurant's named after, is that..

257
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:18,240
Yeah. He actually purchased
the place in 1852.

258
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:20,241
And how long have you owned this place?

259
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:25,165
Well, it's been in the
family since, uh, 1965.

260
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:28,869
It's clear Anthony and Tony have had
their share of experiences here.

261
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,403
But I need to talk to someone who wouldn't
be influenced by workplace rumors.

262
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,073
So I found a contractor who did
some work in the basement.

263
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:39,334
But was too scared to finish the job.

264
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:47,868
- So you were contracted to do work here?
- Yeah.

265
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:50,704
Now what happened while
you were on the job?

266
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:54,188
The first couple of weeks were fine.
We got a lot of stuff done.

267
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:55,888
After a few more weeks went on,

268
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:00,601
I noticed that, within two or three hours,
I would get sort of a negative feeling..

269
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:04,229
A sadness feeling, sort
of like a depression.

270
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,767
I didn't want to see people
and I would get very tired..

271
00:15:07,768 --> 00:15:10,274
Extremely tired, like, as
if, I worked a whole day.

272
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:13,532
And.. And this, strangely enough, is,
you know, when I would get in the car

273
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:17,452
and leave here, then, you know, within
45 minutes, I'd begin to feel better.

274
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:19,515
- Had you ever felt like that before?
- No.

275
00:15:19,516 --> 00:15:22,912
Are.. Are you starting to feel any of
those feelings now while we're down here?

276
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:25,692
I do feel a little sensation.
I feel tired already.

277
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:28,573
- You do?
- I do.

278
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:33,159
I feel like that soldier guy..

279
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,693
I think he feels like maybe the
basement's his.. His thing.

280
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:42,594
Do you think that he makes himself
known to people in the basement?

281
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:50,435
I think that they might feel
him before they see him.

282
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:55,056
I don't think he really likes to be seen.

283
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,222
They got a problem with
the lights down here.

284
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:02,331
They would just fizzle out and burn up.

285
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:04,701
- You know that that doesn't happen.
- Yeah, that doesn't really happen.

286
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:07,822
Now if a regular bulb explodes, when they..

287
00:16:07,823 --> 00:16:10,143
When they normally burn out,
they make, like, a flash,

288
00:16:10,144 --> 00:16:11,647
- like a camera flash.
- Right.

289
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:14,276
These ones would just, like you..
If you had it on a dimmer.

290
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,204
We're talking, like, two
or three bulbs a night.

291
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:19,325
- A night?
- A night.

292
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:22,088
Anything else strange?

293
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:24,921
I did have a pile of lumber on
the other side of the room.

294
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:28,564
There was about seventy-five
2x4s on the floor over there.

295
00:16:28,565 --> 00:16:32,146
And the first night I started,
they were on that side.

296
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:36,143
The next night I came back, all the 2x4s,
just as neatly stacked as I had 'em..

297
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:39,618
Were on the other side here.

298
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:42,026
Like I was disturbing something.

299
00:16:42,027 --> 00:16:44,486
Jeff, I gotta ask you, what..
What made you stop working here?

300
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:45,936
I couldn't get anything done.

301
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:50,231
I can't continue to do work at a place
where we can't get anything done.

302
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:53,668
And then, uh, depression.
I just wanted to leave and go home.

303
00:16:53,669 --> 00:16:55,555
Now would you normally walk off a job?

304
00:16:55,556 --> 00:17:01,456
That's absolutely not my personality.
I've never walked off a job before.

305
00:17:02,736 --> 00:17:05,662
His favorite place is the basement.

306
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:11,563
And he is very protective of it.
He doesn't like anybody down there.

307
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:14,616
And he moves stuff.

308
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:19,832
This soldier believes it's his job to
guard the basement against any intruders.

309
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,503
And he'll do anything
to protect that space.

310
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:26,067
His technique is to..

311
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:30,045
Is to freak people out in the dark.

312
00:17:30,046 --> 00:17:35,946
It feels very claustrophobic.
Like you can't see your way out to escape.

313
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:57,905
I don't really like being in
the dark here for some reason.

314
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:02,261
Being in the dark here is uncomfortable.

315
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:06,525
And that's odd, because I
don't really care about that.

316
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:08,913
It feels like this..

317
00:18:08,914 --> 00:18:11,629
Soldier guy his, uh..

318
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,659
Technique is to..

319
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,800
Is to freak people out in the dark.

320
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:37,412
Tony told me that the original owner of
the Inn was a guy named James Smalley.

321
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:39,765
So I'm headed over to meet
with a local historian

322
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:44,386
who knows everything about this guy's past.

323
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:55,488
As you know, I'm doing the investigation

324
00:18:55,489 --> 00:18:56,853
- on the Smalley's Inn.
- Mm-hmm.

325
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:59,071
I was talking to the
owner, and, uh, he said

326
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:01,304
the place was originally
owned by James Smalley.

327
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:05,805
James Smalley bought the building in 1852.

328
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,233
And he turned it into an Inn,
a Tavern, and a Restaurant.

329
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:14,536
- Okay.
- And here's a picture of James.

330
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:17,339
By all accounts, he was magnanimous.

331
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,024
He was, uh, outgoing.

332
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,945
People said he would do
anything for anyone.

333
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:27,692
He was quite active in the community..
Uh, town supervisor,

334
00:19:27,693 --> 00:19:30,367
Sheriff, treasurer, assemblyman.

335
00:19:30,368 --> 00:19:33,168
He even recruited soldiers
for the civil war.

336
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,653
Do we know when he died?

337
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:36,875
He died in 1867.

338
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,706
Of what was called a sudden
morning heart attack.

339
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:43,247
In.. In the building itself.

340
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:45,528
Do we know how old he was when he died?

341
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:47,539
He was about 54.

342
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,314
One morning, he woke up.

343
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:53,515
Had a heart attack, and that was it.

344
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,049
I also get this guy.

345
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,972
Um, I don't know if he worked
here or owned the place..

346
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:10,873
Uh, but he was very much in
charge and was here all the time.

347
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,438
And he also is more, like..

348
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:15,878
Residual.

349
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:19,254
The vibe around him was really happy, good,

350
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:22,645
you know, care.. Like, just really awesome.

351
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:25,129
But he died here.

352
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,506
He died here.

353
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:29,507
And how did he die?

354
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:35,647
Oh, I think he had a heart attack.

355
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:38,367
So did James Smalley have a family?

356
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:39,328
Yes.

357
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:43,627
His first wife was named Harriet, and
they had nine children together.

358
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:46,997
Two of them died in infancy.

359
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:49,566
Now do we know what
Harriet passed away from?

360
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:52,303
We don't know, but she died in 1850.

361
00:20:52,304 --> 00:20:56,375
And then he married
Harriet's sister, Emily.

362
00:20:56,376 --> 00:21:00,285
And had an additional six children.

363
00:21:00,286 --> 00:21:03,714
So things must have been
very crowded in the Inn.

364
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:05,492
Yeah. That's, what, 15 kids?

365
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:09,639
Right. Unfortunately, two of
James and Emily's children..

366
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,648
Died very young of diphtheria.

367
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:14,592
Linda, what exactly is diphtheria?

368
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:17,472
It's a disease that's contracted
through contaminated food.

369
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:20,026
It affects the respiratory system.

370
00:21:20,027 --> 00:21:22,926
Similar to what we would
think of with pneumonia..

371
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:26,781
Very difficult to breathe,
affects the nose, the throat.

372
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:31,822
A very painful, slow death
for the two children.

373
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:43,411
It's weird, because I see,
like, people living down here.

374
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:44,608
What do you mean?

375
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:48,389
Like, they all lived down here.

376
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:56,552
Maybe like ten people..

377
00:21:57,675 --> 00:22:00,855
Are sleeping down here.

378
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:12,997
Do you know if they have any
relationship to each other?

379
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,098
Yeah.

380
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,751
It feels like, uh, maybe one family.

381
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,394
Okay.

382
00:22:18,395 --> 00:22:22,204
I do see some people who are sick.

383
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:23,885
What kind of sick?

384
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:26,106
Like flu.

385
00:22:26,894 --> 00:22:29,954
Just like a passing..

386
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:39,115
I think a couple of kids died from it.

387
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,360
Again, just getting this, like, loud..

388
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:57,354
People yelling.

389
00:22:57,355 --> 00:23:00,715
This is a long time ago.

390
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:06,719
It is weird, though, because I
do see, like, pools of blood.

391
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,852
Where?

392
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:10,373
On the floor.

393
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:18,796
The blood on the floor is, like, an
indicator of how many people died here.

394
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:25,709
Linda mentioned James Smalley was
very active in The Civil War.

395
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,213
That caught my attention because
Tony said several people reported

396
00:23:29,214 --> 00:23:33,790
seeing an apparition of a soldier in
an old-fashioned military uniform.

397
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:37,521
I need to find out exactly
what his involvement was.

398
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:42,189
So I'm off to meet with an elected
official who happens to be a war buff.

399
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,090
He promised he could fill me in.

400
00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:54,481
I'm doing an investigation
at the Smalley's Inn,

401
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:58,994
and I learned that James Smalley was
pretty active during The Civil War.

402
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:00,777
Oh, he was extremely
active in The Civil War.

403
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:05,392
He handled the draft rolls, get the
young people from the County to enlist.

404
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:08,164
Okay, so his role was to actually
get men to go off and fight?

405
00:24:08,165 --> 00:24:10,025
Yes.

406
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,105
Did Smalley actually serve in the war?

407
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:16,226
He was too old to serve in the war.

408
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:18,228
So, Richie, did he serve any other way?

409
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:19,548
Oh, yes, he did.

410
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:22,679
He, uh, he actually had a
mortuary underneath the Inn.

411
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,232
Now that was in the basement?

412
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,093
Yes.

413
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:29,234
Soldiers that died of their
wounds in hospitals,

414
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:31,650
who were shipped home for burial.

415
00:24:31,651 --> 00:24:34,644
Were put up temporarily in
his morgue beneath the Inn.

416
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:36,565
Okay.

417
00:24:45,956 --> 00:24:48,992
Mm. Someone's talking
about something medical.

418
00:24:48,993 --> 00:24:50,527
What do you mean?

419
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:52,388
Mm..

420
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,450
I'm seeing tables here..

421
00:24:57,656 --> 00:24:59,403
Like, a long table.

422
00:24:59,404 --> 00:25:03,811
There's a lot of people here, and there's..

423
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:06,212
Oh, my God.

424
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,394
They're bringing in these men.

425
00:25:09,395 --> 00:25:12,678
People are freaking out, and they're..
Been injured.

426
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,977
And, like, someone's digging
a bullet out of somebody.

427
00:25:16,978 --> 00:25:21,118
It's gross and dirty and disgusting.

428
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:25,923
After meeting with Richie,
I wanted to see what other

429
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:29,343
information I could find
out about Smalley's Inn.

430
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:35,244
So I went to the local library to see
what I could uncover in their records.

431
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:41,961
Digging through the archives, I
came across several articles

432
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:45,013
about a convicted murderer
by the name of George Denny.

433
00:25:45,014 --> 00:25:50,914
Who was executed at the Courthouse right
down the street from Smalley's Inn.

434
00:25:53,023 --> 00:25:57,720
It turns out, there's a local author who's
actually writing a book about this case.

435
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,533
I've reached out to him,
and he tells me, there's

436
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:04,454
a lot of weird twists
and turns to the story.

437
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:13,343
So, Vin, I came across an
article, uh, from the 1800s,

438
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:16,451
where this kid, George Denny, got executed.

439
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:18,912
It looks like it was the only
one in Carmel's history.

440
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:21,384
So what were the circumstances
of the homicide? What happened?

441
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:26,195
In October of 1843, an 80-year-old
man named Abraham Wanzer.

442
00:26:26,196 --> 00:26:30,665
Is in his cabin, middle of the
woods, and someone calls him out.

443
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:35,879
When he walks outside, he's shot
point-blank in the chest with a shotgun.

444
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,557
So they arrest 17-year-old George Denny.

445
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,189
Who was virtually a homeless boy.

446
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,130
Bring him here, put him in the
jail behind the Courthouse.

447
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:47,649
They have a trial in November.
Hung jury, let him go.

448
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,156
I had read they had a second trial.

449
00:26:49,157 --> 00:26:51,042
Yeah, then they do a second trial..

450
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:54,869
And in the second trial, the jury said..

451
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,812
Hang him.

452
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:59,112
On the day of the execution.

453
00:26:59,113 --> 00:27:01,693
4,000 people..

454
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:06,233
Came here, here, in front
of this Courthouse.

455
00:27:06,234 --> 00:27:08,953
All night long, wagons came in and out.

456
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:11,091
And it was like a.. A circus.

457
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:15,924
They came from everywhere
to watch a boy die.

458
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,460
So they have him on the
steps of the Courthouse.

459
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:21,627
Then they put the rope around his neck.

460
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:25,757
They take the boy with the
noose around his neck..

461
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:28,327
Led him down the steps..

462
00:27:28,328 --> 00:27:30,777
In front of Smalley's Inn.

463
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:34,441
Then they parade him to the
back where the gallows are.

464
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:37,032
And they execute him.

465
00:27:37,033 --> 00:27:40,994
So, Vin, after his execution,
what happens to the body?

466
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:43,007
There is no grave for this boy.

467
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:45,180
There is no monument of any kind.

468
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:50,401
We're not even sure what
cemetery he might be in.

469
00:27:56,162 --> 00:27:58,385
Amy, who would you like to draw?

470
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,054
Well, I would like to draw a woman.

471
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:03,236
She looks like a Banshee.

472
00:28:03,237 --> 00:28:04,491
Okay.

473
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:07,732
She's very, very thin..

474
00:28:07,874 --> 00:28:10,574
Very thin mouth.

475
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:14,269
Her nose is long and pointy.

476
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:16,908
And the hair?

477
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:20,629
She has long, long white hair.

478
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:25,720
Does she have, um, an
expression on her face?

479
00:28:25,721 --> 00:28:29,081
If anything, kind of sad.

480
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:32,849
Is this who you saw?

481
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:36,792
Yes, it is.

482
00:28:54,581 --> 00:28:57,391
Now that our investigation is finished,

483
00:28:57,392 --> 00:28:59,849
it's time for Amy and me to
present what we've discovered

484
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,570
to the clients and each other.

485
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:07,643
Now these two tough-looking guys
that are sitting in front of you.

486
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:10,884
Have, uh, called us in.

487
00:29:11,027 --> 00:29:13,393
Anthony here works Security
for the restaurant.

488
00:29:13,394 --> 00:29:15,892
- Mm-hmm.
- He's a tough kid, but..

489
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:18,987
He's pretty frightened by some of the
things that have happened to him here.

490
00:29:18,988 --> 00:29:23,177
And he's actually considering quitting
because it's that frightening for him.

491
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,259
Okay.

492
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,894
Tony owns the place.
He's been here for a lot of years.

493
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:32,167
But he's concerned about maybe losing
customers because of what's going on here.

494
00:29:32,168 --> 00:29:38,068
With that, I'm gonna turn it over to
Amy and, uh, hear about her walk.

495
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:48,830
Well, um, there was something I
encountered before the walk.

496
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:53,396
I was at home, and these
three dead people showed up.

497
00:29:53,397 --> 00:29:56,125
And one of 'em was a female.

498
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:58,969
And she was standing beside my bed. And..

499
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,156
They don't want me to continue doing
what I'm doing because I'm, like..

500
00:30:03,157 --> 00:30:06,473
Telling people how to make them go away.

501
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:11,754
I get here, and I do my
opening, and she's there.

502
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:16,851
And she's, like, you know, hates
me and wants me dead and..

503
00:30:16,852 --> 00:30:18,385
So you're saying she's here?

504
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:19,386
Yeah.

505
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:23,273
- Oh, jeez.
- And I'm like, "oh, okay".

506
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:27,752
She hates all living people.
She's pissed off and really depressed.

507
00:30:27,753 --> 00:30:32,913
So she does cry a lot and,
like, moans or wails.

508
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:36,625
And she had long hair..

509
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,446
That looked white.

510
00:30:39,532 --> 00:30:42,492
And I could see through her..

511
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:44,344
Which was really weird.

512
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:48,360
Most people think that the dead usually
show themselves as transparent.

513
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:49,933
But that's actually very rare.

514
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:53,635
To me, they usually appear
as solid as living people.

515
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:58,383
She was showing herself to me
in a very interesting way.

516
00:30:58,384 --> 00:30:59,819
You said it was transparent?

517
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,740
Yeah.

518
00:31:03,608 --> 00:31:06,465
Have you ever heard of a Banshee?

519
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:08,022
I've heard the term.

520
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:11,023
A Banshee is, like..

521
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,710
A Grim Reaper.

522
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,562
Usually in, like, Ireland or Scotland.

523
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:20,121
They wander about..

524
00:31:20,122 --> 00:31:22,412
- Yeah.
- And they scream and they cry.

525
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,711
If somebody sees them..

526
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:28,012
That person's gonna die.

527
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:32,483
If somebody hears them, someone close
to that person is going to die..

528
00:31:32,484 --> 00:31:34,764
Very soon.

529
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,192
Banshee's don't intervene
and cause a person to die.

530
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:43,261
They just, like, are notifying them.

531
00:31:43,262 --> 00:31:47,462
This one is also potentially causing..

532
00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:50,685
Them to die.

533
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,370
And she'll go around the area.
It's not just here.

534
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,958
She's affecting other
locations around here.

535
00:31:56,959 --> 00:32:01,113
So that's great. I could take this
woman to my house with my kids, right?

536
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:03,634
Yes, you can.

537
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:11,199
Um, well, actually, I sketched her.

538
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,180
Yeah, when Amy does a
sketch, I don't see it.

539
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:30,873
Oh, my God.

540
00:32:37,516 --> 00:32:39,050
This is freaking me out.

541
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:41,790
It's not really like a sketch
I've seen you do before.

542
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:44,803
Well, she was transparent.

543
00:32:44,804 --> 00:32:47,384
The woman I saw downstairs..

544
00:32:47,385 --> 00:32:49,772
Was transparent. I could see through her.

545
00:32:49,773 --> 00:32:51,841
Her eyes were just all white.

546
00:32:51,842 --> 00:32:56,222
You're almost, like, describing a witch.

547
00:32:56,784 --> 00:33:00,564
That's a scary looking picture.

548
00:33:06,215 --> 00:33:08,864
What else did you, uh, see on your walk?

549
00:33:08,865 --> 00:33:11,120
I encountered a..

550
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:15,790
Big guy who had dark hair,
and he was really happy.

551
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:19,110
Um, big smile on his face all
the time, really good vibes.

552
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:23,985
And I got that he was
an owner of this place.

553
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:25,305
And he had a heart attack.

554
00:33:25,306 --> 00:33:28,301
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

555
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:29,746
It sounds like..

556
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:32,716
One of the original owners, who this
place is named after, James Smalley.

557
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:36,286
That's how people described the guy.
Everybody liked him.

558
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:39,887
Here's a picture of Smalley.

559
00:33:42,025 --> 00:33:43,994
He died of what they called..

560
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:47,431
A sudden morning heart attack.

561
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:50,868
His first wife died.
He had nine kids with her.

562
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:53,678
He wound up marrying her sister..

563
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,439
A couple of years later and had
another six kids with her.

564
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,109
This is his second wife..

565
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,090
Emily.

566
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:10,890
I heard and seen this lady.

567
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:13,074
You saw her?

568
00:34:13,075 --> 00:34:16,135
I saw her downstairs.

569
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:43,485
This is his second wife..

570
00:34:43,486 --> 00:34:45,466
Emily.

571
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:53,372
Oh.

572
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,963
I've heard and seen this lady.

573
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:01,183
You saw her?

574
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:03,141
I saw her downstairs.

575
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,988
She had a hat on.
You know, very well-dressed.

576
00:35:05,989 --> 00:35:09,576
Beautiful gown like they wore back then.

577
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:14,231
And one of the.. One of the reasons
we're here, he was in the basement..

578
00:35:14,232 --> 00:35:16,556
And he got shoved.

579
00:35:16,557 --> 00:35:19,727
As I'm.. Filling up the ice..

580
00:35:19,728 --> 00:35:22,819
I hear a whisper in my ear.

581
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,680
I got flung like I was..
Like I was nothing.

582
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:29,995
Now why'd you say "oh"
when you saw the photo?

583
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:33,507
Well, I felt, when I saw
this photo, that it was her.

584
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:35,222
It looks like her, though.

585
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:38,366
Looking at her, the mouth,
the nose, the eyes..

586
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:41,564
Even the hair parted down the
middle, for that matter.

587
00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:45,088
I was relieved to see that photo
because that was the woman I saw.

588
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:47,934
And living people can
never become Banshees.

589
00:35:47,935 --> 00:35:50,948
This makes me believe she was
just projecting herself as one.

590
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:54,669
In order to scare people away.

591
00:35:56,616 --> 00:35:59,947
Now moving forward on the walk,
uh, anything else after that?

592
00:35:59,948 --> 00:36:02,828
I saw long tables.

593
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:06,510
Uh, and then I saw three pools of blood.

594
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:10,307
And these men were brought in.
They were bloody, messed up.

595
00:36:10,308 --> 00:36:13,794
The room was disgusting.
I mean, it was dirty, really, really dirty.

596
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:15,019
We were talking about Smalley.

597
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,399
The guy was the Sheriff, you know,
he was on the City Council.

598
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,329
He.. He was also the Coroner.

599
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:24,438
During The Civil War, the
basement acted as the morgue.

600
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:27,629
For the soldiers that were
getting ready for burial.

601
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,430
Oh.

602
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,117
What else did you see?

603
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:36,961
In the, uh, basement..

604
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:41,179
I see this guy, and he's, like, a soldier.

605
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,462
I'm walking back up the stairs..

606
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:46,117
And he pushes me.

607
00:36:46,118 --> 00:36:49,470
And what I felt was his
hands go inside my back,

608
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:52,531
and then he's pushing me, pushing
me, pushing me, pushing me out.

609
00:36:52,532 --> 00:36:54,512
He follows people. He likes to intimidate.

610
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:57,356
It's all, like, sneak
attacks, though, for him.

611
00:36:57,357 --> 00:37:01,111
He gives off panic and confusion.

612
00:37:01,112 --> 00:37:03,155
Makes me feel..

613
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:05,146
Scared.

614
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:09,576
He.. He's really good
at that kind of stuff.

615
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:13,977
There was a.. A.. A waitress.. Who saw..

616
00:37:13,978 --> 00:37:17,854
A soldier standing in the back
room by that liquor cabinet.

617
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:19,819
She was messed with a lot.

618
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,496
The basement area, it's his territory.

619
00:37:23,497 --> 00:37:25,789
You can definitely..

620
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,514
Feel him.

621
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:31,835
Before you have an experience with him.

622
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:37,238
It's funny, because I interviewed a
contractor that was working for Tony.

623
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:40,159
And, uh, who won't come back here.

624
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,930
He's working in the basement,
and the lights would just dim.

625
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:47,274
And just go out four or five times a night.

626
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:49,405
And he's never seen that before.

627
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:53,246
He had 78 pieces of 2x4 lumber.

628
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:55,682
That were literally moved overnight.

629
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:58,239
From one side..

630
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,687
Of the basement to the other side.

631
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:04,907
He knows how to physically
manipulate his surroundings.

632
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,851
Moving plates or..

633
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,912
Or chairs or glasses.

634
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:15,348
This person kind of reminds me of him.

635
00:38:15,655 --> 00:38:19,099
And I don't know how I can't explain that.

636
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,226
He was really big, uh, during
The Civil War, he recruited

637
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:25,524
guys to fight in the war, but
he was too old to serve.

638
00:38:25,525 --> 00:38:27,260
Could he be the guy wearing the uniform?

639
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:29,421
Possibly.

640
00:38:32,107 --> 00:38:36,769
I believe the happy man I encountered was
residual energy from when he was alive.

641
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:42,670
But in death, he showed himself to me as
an angry soldier to protect his property.

642
00:38:43,441 --> 00:38:45,877
So, Amy, you didn't happen to
pick up anything on a hanging?

643
00:38:45,878 --> 00:38:48,393
No hanging, no, no. Not at all.

644
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:51,096
Well, there was this guy, Abraham Wanzer.

645
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:53,310
And he was killed by a
kid named George Denny.

646
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:56,437
George Denny was convicted
and tried of the murder.

647
00:38:56,438 --> 00:38:58,975
Right before they hung him, they
paraded him right in front of here.

648
00:38:58,976 --> 00:39:02,603
There was 4,000 people here
to watch this execution.

649
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:07,212
And they dragged him around with the noose
around his neck, then they hung him.

650
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:10,140
Why do you think you didn't know..
You didn't get the kid that got hung?

651
00:39:10,141 --> 00:39:14,686
So when I walk in, it's like everybody's
talking, there's a lot of images..

652
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:16,928
And so I just try to hone in on..

653
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:20,289
What I feel is important.

654
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:25,278
You just never know what you're gonna get.

655
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,332
No one sensitive,

656
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:31,237
is ever a hundred percent accurate.

657
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:35,618
And if they are, you better wonder why.

658
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,410
Well, Anthony, Tony, the good
news is, you're not crazy.

659
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,226
There's obviously stuff going on here.

660
00:39:42,227 --> 00:39:44,569
The question is, is it
safe for you to be here?

661
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,593
For that, I'm gonna turn
it over to Amy and see

662
00:39:46,594 --> 00:39:51,154
what she thinks about how to resolve this.

663
00:39:55,112 --> 00:39:59,552
She is your first priority to deal with.

664
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:03,544
Honestly, when I saw the photo,
I kinda got a little excited..

665
00:40:03,545 --> 00:40:06,883
Because then I'm like, well,
maybe she's not a real Banshee.

666
00:40:06,884 --> 00:40:09,227
Yeah, well, that's good, because
I'm actually getting nauseous.

667
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:13,263
But it doesn't matter if
she's not a real Banshee.

668
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:15,639
Because she..

669
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,540
Is still doing what she's doing.

670
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:28,328
So the biggest thing.. To take care of in..

671
00:40:28,347 --> 00:40:30,987
Is this person.

672
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,226
And it's not gonna be easy.

673
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:37,208
Be very, very careful.

674
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:40,559
You know, my suggestion
is to find a priest.

675
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,878
And you need a medium at the same time.

676
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:49,948
The medium is basically going
to make contact with..

677
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:51,772
Her.

678
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:54,257
You know, find out what
her issues are, let..

679
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:56,109
Basically, let her vent.

680
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:00,263
And they're both gonna ask her to please..

681
00:41:00,264 --> 00:41:02,244
Leave.

682
00:41:04,794 --> 00:41:09,294
You also have to get rid of the soldier.

683
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:12,824
The priest is gonna do a blessing.

684
00:41:12,825 --> 00:41:17,208
And that's going to help,
with him to leave.

685
00:41:17,209 --> 00:41:18,645
He needs to go.

686
00:41:18,646 --> 00:41:22,152
This is your time.
It's not theirs.

687
00:41:22,153 --> 00:41:26,287
It's time for them to go.
You don't tolerate this.

688
00:41:26,288 --> 00:41:29,400
Well, are you guys gonna
listen to Amy's advice?

689
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:31,102
Absolutely.

690
00:41:31,103 --> 00:41:34,419
What about you? Are you gonna do
the right thing and participate?

691
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,904
Oh, yeah.

692
00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:38,245
Okay, good.

693
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:42,487
The transparent woman who attacked
me is still extremely dangerous.

694
00:41:42,488 --> 00:41:45,223
Anthony and Tony need to follow my advice.

695
00:41:45,224 --> 00:41:47,145
Or she could do a lot of damage.

696
00:41:47,146 --> 00:41:52,246
Not only to the restaurant, but also
to its employees and customers.

697
