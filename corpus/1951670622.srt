00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:02,799
I'm Charles S. Dutton.

1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:05,871
Last summer, I came back here
to Baltimore, Maryland...

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:08,634
to film a story about life on the corner.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,073
I grew up and hung out on a corner
just like this one...

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,509
not too far from here.

5
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:17,105
A corner like thousands of others
across the country.

6
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:21,175
It's a place to go if you wanna be seen,
and to a lot of folks...

7
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,347
it's the information center
of the neighborhood.

8
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,717
You wanna know who got the good drugs...

9
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:30,262
you wanna know who got killed last night,
why, and who did it...

10
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,830
you come here.

11
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,626
The contradiction of it is...

12
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,402
on one hand, the corner pulsates with life.

13
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,738
The energy of human beings
trying to make it to the next day.

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,175
But also, it's a place of death.

15
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,676
Be it the slow death of addiction,
or the suddenness of gunshots.

16
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:55,253
Back when I was hanging out here,
it was bad.

17
00:00:55,355 --> 00:01:00,054
But 30 years ago, Maryland
had only five major penal institutions.

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,021
Today, there are 28...

19
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,559
and more are being planned.

20
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,133
Yet the corners haven't gone away.

21
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,768
There are 100 open-air drug markets
in Baltimore...

22
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,803
thousands in America...

23
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,932
whether the rest of the country
wants to think about them or not.

24
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,441
This film is a true story of men,
women and children...

25
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,016
living in the midst of the drug trade.

26
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,708
Their voices...

27
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,116
are too rarely heard.

28
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,535
Gary, how long have
you been shooting dope?

29
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:54,170
- Hardcore? About four years.
- And you're how old now?

30
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,076
- 34.
- You started kind of late.

31
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,451
I didn't mess with these drugs
for the longest time.

32
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,522
But everyone around says
things were going very well for you.

33
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,420
You worked two full-time jobs.

34
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,358
Yeah, plus a home-development company
I started on the side.

35
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,362
- You drove a Mercedes Benz.
- Things was going good.

36
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,024
So why did you start shooting heroin?

37
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:17,196
I'm gonna get me a cigarette.
I need a cigarette.

38
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,318
- Hey how's it going?
- What's up, man?

39
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,093
A cigarette. You weren't kidding.

40
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,188
Yeah, 25 cent apiece.

41
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,968
It'd be a lot cheaper to buy a pack,
wouldn't it?

42
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,070
Yeah, well, you know...

43
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:56,632
Why buy a whole pack, 'cause you know
I'm gonna end up giving half of them away.

44
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,803
So I just buy only one.

45
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,909
These matches, man.

46
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,882
You know, Koreans own this place now.

47
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,490
Used to be Lendler's.
Jewish man and his brother.

48
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,358
I used to work here.

49
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,523
He gave me a job, like,
sweeping up and things.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,026
As a matter of fact,
this was my first job ever.

51
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,472
I remember Fat Curt.

52
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,670
Hey, you guys talk to Fat Curt yet?

53
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,370
Yeah, I met him.

54
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,471
I remember he and his brother Dennis
used to come in here...

55
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,211
and slide a couple of gin bottles
in their coat pocket...

56
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,479
and then walk out.

57
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,249
One day,
Mr. Lendler sent me there after them.

58
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,324
I'm 9 or 10 years old.

59
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,790
And I walk up to them.

60
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,854
I go, "Mr. Curt, Mr. Dennis...

61
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,559
"Mr. Lendler wants to talk to you
about them bottles that y'all bought."

62
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,365
He looked at me and go,
"Who do you think you're talking to?

63
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:02,498
"Your little ass is as black as mine.
Get your ass off this corner."

64
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,512
I watched this place burn down
during the riots.

65
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,286
But I had jobs. I had good jobs.

66
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,653
I was a supervisor
for Beth Steel down at the Point.

67
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:19,986
You worked hard.

68
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,961
My father came from Carolina, I remember,
weren't nothing but 14 years old.

69
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,199
Landed him a foundry job
the day he came off the bus.

70
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,600
He worked hard every day of his life.
He's still working, driving a cab.

71
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,068
My brothers and sisters,
they're doing just the same.

72
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,868
So what happened, Gary?

73
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,244
- Man, you just don't know.
- Well, tell me.

74
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,745
See, I'm gonna stop, all right. I'll get it right.

75
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,387
Have you ever tried to quit before?

76
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,489
Yeah, I'm gonna get past this. You'll see.

77
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,786
You got another?

78
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,255
No, man.

79
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,499
Hey, look here, man...

80
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,264
I'll talk to y'all later.
We'll do this later, okay?

81
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,202
- I can't talk right now.
- All right.

82
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,502
- Take it easy, Gary.
- All right, man.

83
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:16,042
Pink tabs in the hole!

84
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,353
You think I'm playing with your fucking ass.
I'm saying your shit ain't shit!

85
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,724
I'm fucking tired of New York niggers
taking money for shit...

86
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,797
that don't even get folks out of the gate.

87
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:34,662
You're a lying bitch!
Your ass is high as shit right now!

88
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,133
You think I'm out here
getting niggers high for free?

89
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,830
- Shit ain't free!
- No, I'm gonna get $10 back.

90
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,271
Or I'm gonna find a phone
and call the police.

91
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:46,778
I should take a bat against your head
for even thinking some shit like that.

92
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,439
Do what the fuck
you got to do, motherfucker!

93
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,646
Yo! Where the fuck are you going? Hold up!

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,987
- Hold up!
- I'd bust that bitch in her head.

95
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,521
You ain't shit.

96
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,615
I said, hold up, goddamn it!

97
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,925
Damn, you're a soft motherfucker.

98
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm gonna get you two more pills.

99
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,167
But don't come back with that crying shit...

100
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,332
or I'll whip your ass for sure,
most definitely.

101
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,375
Bitch!

102
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,804
You're crazy, girl.

103
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,046
Ronnie baby.

104
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,584
Damn, man.

105
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,750
You're fierce, girl.

106
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,658
Man, you took that Gee Money for what,
two of them bags?

107
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,254
That nigger knows he's gotta kill me...

108
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,061
or I'm gonna call them
jump-out boys on his ass.

109
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,828
You think that nigger gonna
kill me for two bags?

110
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,505
I think you can always get that shit up.
Fuck Gee Money!

111
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,138
Fuck that boy. Got the shit.

112
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,347
That's right. You know
what you're talking about, girl.

113
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:01,119
I used to live here
with my girlfriend and our son.

114
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,753
Man, I wish we had some coke with it.

115
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,398
We'll get to that later.

116
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,906
- What?
- You ain't hear that?

117
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,681
- Come on.
- Shut your mouth. Someone's downstairs.

118
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,481
Just do the shot, Ronnie!

119
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:35,611
I ain't gonna be fucking with this shit
if someone's coming up to bank our asses.

120
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,852
Shit, it might be the police.

121
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,403
Man, I ain't gonna do shit till you get back.

122
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,789
Nothing but a rat, that's all.

123
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,799
- I knew I heard something.
- Yeah, well.

124
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,012
You know this shit
will make a person paranoid?

125
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:33,808
You know this shit
will make a person paranoid?

126
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,141
You been known to run game on people.

127
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,612
Not on you, I ain't.

128
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,590
You gonna have to learn...

129
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,284
how to trust the people you love a little bit.

130
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,902
I ain't feeling much.

131
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:37,506
Me neither.

132
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,777
This is some shit.

133
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,281
- We got doo-doo here.
- Gee Money ain't about shit.

134
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,215
What're we gonna do?

135
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,619
I can't even pimp
that motherfucker no more.

136
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,925
I even did that.

137
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,460
Then the motherfucker
might really try to beat my ass.

138
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,192
We're gonna figure this shit out.

139
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,709
Shit.

140
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,011
What?

141
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,212
I've gone and left my hat upstairs.

142
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,548
You wanna get it?

143
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,558
You're the one who left it.

144
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,455
So that's how you gonna do me.

145
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,798
- What's up, Gary?
- Hi.

146
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,311
How've you been?

147
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,990
See you later, Mr. Lendler.

148
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,833
- Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Avery.
- Hey, Gary.

149
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,247
<i>It just didn't happen that way</i>

150
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,578
<i>Darlin', it just didn't happen that way</i>

151
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,182
<i>It's all right</i>

152
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,982
<i>It's all right</i>

153
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,736
DeAndre.

154
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,208
Why you ain't at school?

155
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,414
Half day.

156
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,349
Half day?

157
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,718
Yeah.

158
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,326
Hey, love, what's up? I'm looking for you.

159
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,395
What's going on?

160
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:20,370
Charlene's been put out. All her shit is
in the street. Best money in the sofa.

161
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,033
The cushions don't match,
but the rest is like new.

162
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,507
This is my cousin, Tony.

163
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,602
You and him gonna carry that shit down
to the second-hand shop.

164
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:28,941
Where's the sofa right now?

165
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,279
Baby, I gave Scalio a cig to guard it.
Now come on.

166
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:54,164
- That's Scalio.
- Only in America.

167
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:58,209
Only in America, in the ghetto,
can life be so fine.

168
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,606
This is why they hate us.

169
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,776
Goddamn niggers
lazing around in the street.

170
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,446
Shit. My boy.
This is a real good couch right here.

171
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,922
- We've got to go to fucking work!
- Fuck y'all!

172
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,823
Keep driving, man. What're you looking at?

173
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,678
- Hey, Gary.
- Everyone else ate?

174
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,449
Don't fret. I saved you some.

175
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,724
- You get paid today?
- Next Friday.

176
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,088
I got paid today.

177
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:01,130
Mr. Lendler said that, from now on,
I get paid $15 every week.

178
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,823
That's a raise.

179
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,295
Mr. Lendler say I'm the best worker
he's ever seen.

180
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,573
Shit, Maurice.

181
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,108
- What's that?
- Fuck that. No, that ain't right.

182
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,405
Bitch! Everything I bring in here is phat.

183
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,604
That was my turn. That's my hit.

184
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,578
There ain't no water in the tap!

185
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,383
- Say what?
- Ain't no water. Come here!

186
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,088
- Yes, it is.
- It ain't!

187
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,460
Let's go.

188
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,552
You were supposed to pay
that damned water bill.

189
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,132
Now there ain't no goddamned water.

190
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:37,636
Look, when I started this here metal game,
there were only a few people doing this.

191
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,730
Look, when I started this here metal game,
there were only a few people doing this.

192
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,036
There was a time you could find
a vacant property...

193
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,974
or a row house renovation...

194
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,772
You know, go in at night
and rip up all that good plumbing.

195
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,579
It got to the point where the contractors
put plastic plumbing in...

196
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,348
because they know that the metal got legs.

197
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:00,991
And all this metal gets melted
down, up in Pittsburgh, or somewhere.

198
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,394
I don't know who owns this place,
but I bet they got a mansion in the county.

199
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,590
While we're out here hustling.

200
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,965
It's good copper right there.

201
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,865
$18.

202
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,604
$18? Come on, look here, Chief.

203
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,543
I know the value of good metal.
This has got to be at least $25.

204
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,775
You want the $18?

205
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,012
- This ain't even right.
- You don't want the $18.

206
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,958
Yeah, I'll take the $18.

207
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,928
We need two more bills.

208
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,989
I could probably get by with this.

209
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,564
Check it out. There go the engineers.
That's what they call them.

210
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,138
Lord, look at that train.

211
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,469
Moe, you're wearing the city out, man!

212
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:56,275
- So, are you gonna go?
- I'll make it work.

213
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,680
I'll catch you back at the place, all right?

214
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,274
All right, man.

215
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,952
Yo, Blue. Yo, Curt.

216
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,627
My boy, Tony, he went to go cop for me.

217
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:15,700
You tell him to get with them gold star.

218
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,198
- They're right as rain.
- Oh, man, please.

219
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,962
I had a gold star two days ago.
It wasn't much.

220
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,666
That was two days ago. Check out Bread.

221
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,038
Gold stars, yo.

222
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,606
- How'd he do that?
- What, the dope fiend lean?

223
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,215
He ain't falling down.

224
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:38,855
Please. You know gravity don't mean shit
when they toking.

225
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,259
What did you get?

226
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,094
Black and whites.

227
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,195
- Ain't no problem with the $18?
- No.

228
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,905
You had no problem?

229
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,209
No, come on, man.

230
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,813
This house is where I live
with my girl and my son.

231
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,619
It's Victorian, man.

232
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,953
Victorian design. There's a lot of money
in a house like this.

233
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:17,324
It's easy making money.
Making money is always hard.

234
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,693
Okay, like in school.

235
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,358
I went to Mergenthaler High School.
Vocational school.

236
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,995
They taught us how to make a living,
but they didn't teach us how to live.

237
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,569
Money ain't that easy.

238
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,503
You see what I'm saying, man.

239
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:34,005
If you get past the money,
you know what I'm saying...

240
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,910
past these drugs even.

241
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,108
The human mind, we don't even
realize how powerful our minds are.

242
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,119
We don't use nearly any part
of the power that we have.

243
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,954
You see, if you study it scientifically...

244
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,590
if man ever progresses to the point
of using all of his mind...

245
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,090
then all things are possible.

246
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,795
Miracles.

247
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,294
Are you feeling it?

248
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,304
Something.

249
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,569
Not like yesterday, though.

250
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,847
Yesterday was the bomb.

251
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,853
This is where miracles come from.

252
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,088
Man uses all of his mind...

253
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,695
and he'll be able to do all things.

254
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,394
Move mountains,
and live underwater for years at a time.

255
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,334
Fly, even.

256
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,832
You're feeling it.

257
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,509
Better than you thought, Tony.

258
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,921
I remember when I bought this album.

259
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,714
<i>Hi, Gary.</i>

260
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,118
Hi, Fran.

261
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,449
What's going on?

262
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,566
Come over here. I have something for you.

263
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,506
I bet your mother don't know
you be selling this.

264
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,051
It's only weed.

265
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,811
All this time, I'm thinking you're
one of them church-going McCulloughs.

266
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,447
You got some street in you.

267
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:04,188
I'm doing this to get some money together
before I go to college. That's all.

268
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,460
How much I owe you?

269
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,461
Nothing.

270
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,603
Look, I gotta get back to work, all right?

271
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,304
<i>Get on the ground!</i>

272
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,403
Put your hands up, man!

273
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,603
Turn around! You right there, come here!

274
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,703
- What's up?
- Police.

275
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,378
Dang, man.

276
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:30,721
Here comes Ronnie. If she finds out
I didn't let her in on the blast, I'm in trouble.

277
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,881
Ronnie always been a little bit evil.

278
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,083
Gary!

279
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,358
Gary, you up in there?

280
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,759
Get down on your fucking knees!

281
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,767
Why you be with her, Gar?

282
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,504
When it come to coke and dope,
she knows how to make things happen.

283
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,073
I'm telling you.
Your cousin, she got it going on.

284
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,041
If she knows we're up here together,
she gonna find us.

285
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,874
Let's go out in the back, man.
We'll split up. Come on.

286
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,090
Hey, love.

287
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,755
- How're you feeling?
- I'm okay.

288
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,026
You got anything?

289
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,626
People saw you in the window, Gary!

290
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,535
You high.

291
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,406
And you ain't seeing to share it with me.

292
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,377
That's some cold shit. Much as I do for you.

293
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:32,142
- You wrong, honey.
- You high, you shit!

294
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,414
Now you're gonna say
you ain't got nothing left?

295
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,012
Look, I had just a little.

296
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,722
You'd best come up with some.

297
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,457
- I ain't got none.
- Where the fuck are you walking?

298
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,294
I ain't got none!

299
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,493
Get away from me!

300
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,829
You don't do me like that.

301
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,301
All right, you're gonna see.

302
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:15,990
You lying bitch!

303
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,153
I'm saying the sandwich is cold.

304
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,959
You buy half-hour.
You take it hot, now cold!

305
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,193
It was cold when I took the first bite.

306
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,030
Give my money, you chink bitch!

307
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:27,537
Too late, very sorry.

308
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:30,831
Suck this, then!

309
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,343
No!

310
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,447
What the fuck is you looking at?

311
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:48,016
Police come for you right away!

312
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:51,189
Young hoppers today, they're crazy.

313
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,960
It was hot before, now cold.
Not right, what he say.

314
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,331
I'm sorry for all that.
The boy, he just don't know.

315
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,962
He very bad. All the time, very bad.

316
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,475
Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry for all that.

317
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,970
Can I get a single Newport?

318
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,577
35 cents.

319
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,178
That's a little steep, don't you think?

320
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,722
A quarter's bad enough for singles,
now it's 35 cents?

321
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,689
You buy pack? Cheaper.

322
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,328
All I have is a quarter.

323
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,094
Can I get one at the old price?

324
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,494
Sorry, 35 cents.

325
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,244
<i>James from Essex. Hello.</i>

326
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,837
<i>Yeah, I wanna comment</i>
<i>on what that other woman said.</i>

327
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,247
<i>I think all this crap</i>
<i>about slavery and racism...</i>

328
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,081
<i>being responsible for people</i>
<i>that don't work...</i>

329
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,882
<i>I think that's a bunch of crap.</i>

330
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,924
<i>You don't hear Italian people</i>
<i>or Irish people complaining...</i>

331
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,926
<i>and they was treated real bad</i>
<i>when they got to this country.</i>

332
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,223
<i>When are we gonna</i>
<i>stop hearing about racism?</i>

333
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,198
<i>Slavery was more than, like, 100 years ago.</i>

334
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:10,137
<i>There are so many people taking drugs.</i>

335
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,676
<i>They just do that to make us feel sorry.</i>

336
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,183
You were driving late?

337
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,016
- Lot of fares?
- Some.

338
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,486
Driving tomorrow?

339
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:32,891
Every day.

340
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,465
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

341
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,348
Black and whites, man?

342
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,900
Oh, heck.

343
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,116
Gary?

344
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,462
You awake?

345
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,271
Are you all right?

346
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,740
Hi, Ma.

347
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,609
What you need?

348
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,988
Could you run up to the store for me?

349
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,285
They need five pounds of potatoes...

350
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,186
and two boxes of Hamburger Helper
up at the church.

351
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,533
That'll be enough, Gary.

352
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,964
Five pounds of potatoes...

353
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,742
and two boxes of Hamburger Helper?

354
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,343
Okay, Mom.

355
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,047
Nine.

356
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,782
- Lot of bags of bomb today.
- Yeah?

357
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,654
- My men are on their way.
- Oh, yeah?

358
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,204
- Here's your change, Ma.
- Thank you, baby.

359
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,612
- You want me to fix you something to eat?
- No, I gotta go.

360
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,224
Where are you headed at?

361
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,959
Boy, I'm talking to you.

362
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,248
What are you here for?
You barely breathing.

363
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,325
I'm up.

364
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,922
Yeah? Where you get the money?

365
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,091
I made a move or two.

366
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:02,462
- Ma, it won't hold air.
- So what you want me to do?

367
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,607
You're having an asthma attack. You think
a shot of dope gonna do you good?

368
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:09,902
You're having an asthma attack. You think
a shot of dope gonna do you good?

369
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,903
Your brother Stevie around?

370
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,037
He's upstairs.

371
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,876
Why are you always coming down here
to get Stevie to cop for you?

372
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,146
You think he don't get burned?

373
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:26,781
He get burned, everybody get burned.
It's all in the game.

374
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,418
I know.

375
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:34,231
Gary, you shoulda never got
caught up in this shit.

376
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,431
Yeah, all right, Fran.

377
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:42,297
And your son's starting to run wild.
He don't need to be out here, neither.

378
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,972
- What's DeAndre doing?
- What do you think he doing?

379
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:47,840
He's starting to creep out on them corners.

380
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,779
Where'd you think he got money enough
to hand you off $10?

381
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,719
- You can't put a stop to that?
- Gary, that boy's 15.

382
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,490
As much as you and me been messing up,
he feels he ain't got to answer to no one.

383
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,924
He ain't in school?

384
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,330
- Warming up today.
- Hey, Stevie!

385
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,334
- You rolling out?
- In a minute.

386
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,305
Come on up.

387
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:34,921
Coke or dope, what do you need?

388
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,725
Little of both?

389
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,659
I got coke, red-tops.

390
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:40,094
All right.

391
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,389
I'll take four.

392
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,180
He's coming back, right?

393
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,448
Be cool. Ain't nobody
trying to run a game on you.

394
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,298
- Y'all have a nice day.
- Slow up.

395
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,997
I still need some dope to go with that coke.

396
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,803
See that man right there with the cane?
Go see him.

397
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:36,781
Who's got good dope?

398
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,188
Wake up!

399
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,847
Quit playing, Bugsy man.

400
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,095
Now what if I was police or a stick-up boy?

401
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:50,429
You standing here like some no-thinking
motherfucker, with your money all out.

402
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,530
- Yeah, but I'm cool with it.
- No, you're not.

403
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,438
I'm trying to school you in this shit,
and you don't want to know.

404
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,600
I've got re-up soon.

405
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,677
You've got mine, I've got yours.

406
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,349
Not here, fool. What'd I just say?

407
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,313
I'll send Boo down the way.

408
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,685
Are you still working with him?

409
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,194
He's about the dumbest.

410
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:20,425
Boo's cool.

411
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,702
Which one?

412
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,863
Any of them.
That one right there, with the hips.

413
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,770
I got to her already.

414
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,407
You got the one,
but you're ready for the rest?

415
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,344
I'm 16 this summer. My dick stay hard.

416
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:39,143
Andre...

417
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,285
where you been at?

418
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,252
- Working.
- Working how?

419
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:47,615
I'm out here all day, on the clock,
getting it done.

420
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,192
It's a hard life, girl.

421
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,524
You been out here that long, I know
you've got money for the movies.

422
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,121
- I don't know, I might.
- Who got the boy?

423
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,470
- You got the heroin?
- Across the way.

424
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,707
I want to go back down to Harper Park.

425
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,371
And see the one where that man
cuts up all them people?

426
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,277
The scary one?

427
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,543
Yeah, I saw it. It ain't that scary.

428
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:18,084
Come on, Andre!
You done already said we was going.

429
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,553
Whatever.

430
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,093
And you said you're gonna get
some new tennises for me, too.

431
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,693
Damn, girl!

432
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,991
I hate a begging-ass bitch!

433
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,963
- I can't stand no broke-ass man.
- Oh, shit.

434
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,536
All right, I'm gonna holler at you tomorrow.

435
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,771
Whatever.

436
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,978
Tyreeka is fine as I don't know what.

437
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,324
But all she think about is money, man.

438
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:56,956
I'm down to maybe 6.

439
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,325
No, we gotta have more than that still.

440
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,556
7?

441
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:04,197
Man, your count is always late.
What's up with that?

442
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,903
Let me check again.

443
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,775
She about the money? Your girl?

444
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:19,649
She's cool when we're together,
but I just can't tell sometimes.

445
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,945
Want to know if she for real or not?

446
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,954
Next time you're in her house...

447
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,184
- ask her to fix you a sandwich.
- A sandwich?

448
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:32,319
If she throws some dry-ass baloney
between two pieces of bread...

449
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,421
you know she ain't keeping it real.

450
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,194
If she go back there
and puts some lettuce and mayo on...

451
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,735
maybe some chips
and a pickle on the side there...

452
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,000
then she damn sure in love
with your black ass.

453
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,107
- I'm serious.
- Wait.

454
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,269
Chips and a pickle?

455
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,971
I don't like pickles.

456
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,613
- First floor?
- Right.

457
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,877
That's a whole lot easier.

458
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:00,615
Stereo, television, refrigerator,
all that good stuff.

459
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,091
Let's do it.

460
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,423
It's real quiet around here.

461
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:11,295
I think most of these places are vacant.

462
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,848
- Ronnie knew what she was talking about.
- She can make things happen.

463
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,852
You empty the refrigerator.
I'll check out the back room.

464
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,252
Come on, start packing stuff up.

465
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,961
Hey, what's wrong?

466
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:46,864
Nothing.

467
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,971
Come on then!

468
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:55,777
- How much do you think we'll get for this?
- I don't know. $200.

469
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,440
I'll go get that thing.

470
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,998
There's someone across the way.

471
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,699
Oh, yeah?

472
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,006
What's up?

473
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,469
What's up? I see what's up.

474
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,881
Look here.

475
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:35,813
Y'all hook me up,
I won't say nothing about it.

476
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,885
Hook you up?

477
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,219
Yeah, we can do that.

478
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,693
All right. That's it.

479
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,817
Mentality, I don't know...

480
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,292
- What?
- That was the man's neighbor.

481
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,956
Rollers.

482
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,431
You think they're worried about us?

483
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:28,301
Rather snatch up some corner boy
with a few rocks in his pocket.

484
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,237
Less work for them.

485
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,772
It's all in the game, you know?

486
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,572
Where's my change?

487
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:41,743
You ain't got no change.
I bought you two packs before.

488
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,786
- You owe me.
- You're on that bullshit.

489
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,618
- You got that $10 for me, right?
- Yeah, you wait for it.

490
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:47,952
Jump out!

491
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,723
Yes, Lord.

492
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,068
- Boo, what the fuck are you doing?
- Jump out.

493
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,230
You best leave that shit be, now.

494
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,210
I've gotta snatch it now.
It won't be there when they roll out.

495
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,683
Oh, shit.

496
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,352
Everybody up against the wall.

497
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:27,931
Right there, let me see your hands.

498
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,825
DeAndre, get your ass over here.
You going somewhere?

499
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,800
Now, up against there.

500
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,068
What's up, Bob Brown?

501
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,940
You got anything in your pockets?

502
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,608
Little man on a big corner?

503
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,149
- No, I was just passing through.
- Just passing through?

504
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,881
Get going.

505
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,554
Why don't you let your partner search me?

506
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,087
- Is he going?
- No.

507
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,327
He's got a mouth, but he's clean.

508
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:04,993
I even see you looking out a window today,
you're taking a humble.

509
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,162
- You're saying I can't be outside?
- No, not today.

510
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:12,174
- That ain't right.
- You're on my corner! I decide what's right!

511
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,538
Now, get.

512
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,787
Ain't you got better sense
to be talking back to Bob Brown?

513
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,255
He ain't all that.
Where's Hungry? He got my shit.

514
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,918
Wherever he at,
your vials is right along with him...

515
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,257
and they get along right fine, I know that.

516
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,635
I'll beat your ass!

517
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:51,942
You all right?

518
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,150
Where Hungry at?

519
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,247
Where Hungry at?

520
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,088
Who else gonna ask, "Where Hungry at?"

521
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,598
Hey, Bread.

522
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,997
What are you talking about?

523
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,503
Nothing. Don't miss that line.

524
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,368
Who you talking to?

525
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,309
I'm just worried
that the sight of my fine black ass...

526
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,403
might make your hand shake.

527
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,476
Scalio, you're too crazy.

528
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,618
Asses come and asses go.

529
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:32,552
Rita don't never blow a shot,
and you know that.

530
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,222
Long?

531
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,864
Thirty on the hypo.

532
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,235
Going, going...

533
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,806
gone.

534
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,476
- What you got?
- Spider bag.

535
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:07,122
Them spider bags was good yesterday.

536
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,921
Not so good today, I think.

537
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,519
Ain't been no good dope out here
worth a goddamn for 10 years.

538
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:15,564
You got that right.

539
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,763
It's all just chemicals now.

540
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,767
Back in the day,
that shit would drop a nigger.

541
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,838
Yes, Lord.

542
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,406
Now we're down to bullshit.

543
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,866
Tell it, Curt.

544
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,068
We ain't even addicted to drugs.

545
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,072
We addicted to the needle.

546
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,978
Curt's still talking that shit.

547
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,745
Saying dope ain't dope.

548
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:40,084
It ain't dope.

549
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,856
Not no more.

550
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,583
Motherfucker, I'm high right now.

551
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,520
You think you high. Nigger, you ain't shit.

552
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,801
Instead of shooting chemicals,
remembering what good dope was.

553
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,807
I'm about to go
get me some more chemicals...

554
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,899
and do me some real remembering.

555
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,819
I'm saying, you shouldn't cut him in on this.

556
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,657
That man's neighbor, he don't deserve
no blast for doing this kind of dirt.

557
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,321
Man, I agree with you.

558
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:27,165
Would you sell your next-door neighbor out
like that for shot of dope...

559
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,597
The mentality out here...

560
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:35,134
Besides, man, we bring him back a blast,
he still might call the police.

561
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:28,628
Ma, got $10 I could borrow?

562
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,331
No, Gary, I don't.

563
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,362
All right.

564
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,764
If I had it, I'd give it to you.

565
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,358
- I'm looking for Ronnie. Ronnie at home?
- No.

566
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:07,202
- What about Tony?
- He don't live here.

567
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,845
Hey, Bread, have you seen Ronnie?

568
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,743
- Did I see Ronnie?
- Yeah.

569
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,578
She was here.

570
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,043
She ain't here now.

571
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:38,595
- Hey, is Stevie here?
- No, he's gone somewhere.

572
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,901
What about Fran?

573
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:43,506
Her, too.

574
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:47,307
Can I bum one cigarette?

575
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,312
Last one.

576
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,196
Go check that thing.

577
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,701
- I'm looking for your mother.
- I don't know where she at.

578
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,439
Guess I'll be moving along then.

579
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,505
It's coke, but maybe you could trade it
for what you need.

580
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,513
- Even up.
- Three for two.

581
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:05,221
Come on, I need a little coke
to go on top of the dope.

582
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,780
I got the killer weed today
and they're going for straight $10.

583
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:12,953
You want to keep a little coke,
go two-for-one, you still have a red-top left.

584
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:16,464
- Two-for-one's worse than three-for-two.
- Depends on what you need.

585
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,899
Come on, you all, Bob Brown's got a wagon.

586
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,833
Roll-out time.

587
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,132
Got to go.

588
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,417
- Get against the wall.
- I know.

589
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,789
Where you going? Come on.
Trying to run away from me?

590
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:50,400
Let's go.

591
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:56,769
Even up now.

592
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,442
I'm going one-for-one.
All you got to do is pick them up.

593
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,445
Lord have mercy.

594
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,877
- How's your family, Officer Tucker?
- Yeah, whatever, man.

595
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,440
Testers.

596
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,247
- Motherfucker, get off my face!
- My bad.

597
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:51,361
- Man, who gave out testers?
- Found them in the road.

598
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:52,587
You got one?

599
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,624
Got two, motherfucker.

600
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,396
Let me have one.

601
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,767
Come on, I'm going ill, man.

602
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:12,782
Man...

603
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,550
you're looking flat-out rough.

604
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,484
Can't get started.

605
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,747
Man, I can hook you up.

606
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:25,123
I found this spot. They practically
asking you to take their shit.

607
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,695
It's out the county. You up?

608
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:31,031
- I'll need a jumper first though.
- I caught two of them testers.

609
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,692
I can get you out the gate.

610
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,169
Then everything from the store we split.

611
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,602
- What are you boosting?
- Kitchen shit, steam irons.

612
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,143
This one store's been
keeping me well all week.

613
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,312
- What's security at, man?
- Ain't about shit.

614
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,616
Come on.

615
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:48,609
All right.

616
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,258
Is your name Doug?
You be over there at the Dew Drop Inn?

617
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,523
You mean where Fran and Stevie live at?

618
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,064
I think I've seen you there before.
My name's Gary.

619
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,176
Okay, so this is how
we're going to do it, right?

620
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,282
We're going to go in separate.

621
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,313
Then you follow me up the escalator,
where they got the shelf with the irons.

622
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,389
You be the lookout. I'll scoop.

623
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,821
Ain't nothing to it.

624
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,592
Ma...

625
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:32,619
it's Gary.

626
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,059
I'm locked up.

627
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,932
I'm out in the county. They locked me up.

628
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:43,670
I was with a friend...

629
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:47,801
we were coming out the JC Penney,
and these two security guards...

630
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,469
they grabbed us
and said we stole something.

631
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:53,915
No, it's some kind of mistake, Ma.

632
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,851
Will you see if Cardy
can get the money together?

633
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,656
Please, Ma, just see if you can bail me out.

634
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,362
Okay. I'm all right.

635
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,900
You all just get me out of this place.

636
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:36,484
McCullough!

637
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,461
- Come on, the city's taking you.
- The city's taking me?

638
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,728
Assault one.

639
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,028
Assault? I haven't assaulted anyone.

640
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,267
Complainant is a Veronica Boice. Know her?

641
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,843
- Where're they taking me?
- Eagle Street.

642
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:58,881
Come on.

643
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:09,992
Bullpen.

644
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,480
- Phone call, Gary.
- Who is it?

645
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:08,482
Didn't say.

646
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,784
Hey, Fran.

647
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,522
How're you doing?

648
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,651
Gary, there's something you should know.

649
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:29,832
Are you sure?

650
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,675
Officer!

651
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:45,883
Shut the fuck up!

652
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:48,514
You ain't going to no infirmary,
motherfucker.

653
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,156
I guess we need to pick out
some names then?

654
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,897
DeAndre!

655
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,375
I heard you got locked up.

656
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:47,350
Yeah.

657
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,141
The city jail ain't no joke.

658
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,117
I'm leaving that stuff alone.

659
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,988
Know what I'm saying,
don't ask me for anything.

660
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,059
No, please,
I wasn't thinking anything like that.

661
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,524
Hey, R.C., what you got there, man?

662
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,802
We're trying to put the rim back up
on the backboard.

663
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:11,498
We're trying to get it straight and tight,
but we ain't got the right screws.

664
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:13,041
You need washers.

665
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:14,477
Washers?

666
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,170
Yeah, let me see that thing.

667
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:20,773
You have to have this like this
to go right up here.

668
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:23,216
You need washers, or somebody get hurt.

669
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,456
Well, it's up there, anyway.

670
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:29,491
That's cool. Thanks, Mr. McCullough.

671
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,219
No problem. Here, take this.

672
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,023
Get this out of your way.

673
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:41,663
Ball up!

674
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,051
All net.

675
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,452
You got a little something.
But not with me on the case, watch.

676
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:03,048
- What have you got right there?
- What you gonna do?

677
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:06,254
Damn, Dre.

678
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:08,364
Right here.

679
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,626
- 'Cause it's tilted.
- Ain't tilted. Excuses.

680
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:13,035
- Five by one.
- Make it ten.

681
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:17,264
Come on, you know they call me Ambo.
You know I got that asthma.

682
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,969
- All right, five, but you got to win by two.
- Ain't no problem.

683
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:23,602
I'm gonna win by five or six.

684
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,007
Hey, love.

685
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,349
Be right back.

686
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:40,020
- Why you put that charge on me?
- You shouldn't have hit me.

687
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,495
You know I didn't.

688
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:46,666
- You had me locked up for nothing at all.
- You was locked up for boosting anyway.

689
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,633
They took me to Eagle Street
because of your charge.

690
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,402
You should have never
cut me out of that blast.

691
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:55,440
What's yours is mine.

692
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:57,305
Hey, love...

693
00:56:58,615 --> 00:56:59,809
welcome home.

694
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,526
Them spider bags, they're the bomb today.

695
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,035
DeAndre!

696
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,417
Curt...

697
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:37,513
you've been out here
on Monroe and Fayette a long time.

698
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,287
Who're you telling?

699
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:43,453
I've been on this corner since that lamppost
over there was a goddamn twig.

700
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:46,823
I'm a soldier.

701
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:50,664
I guess you've seen
the younger ones coming up.

702
00:57:50,767 --> 00:57:53,998
Seen a lot of people come on the corner
for the first time.

703
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,872
Do you know Gary McCullough?

704
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,073
Yeah, Gary.

705
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:02,135
Gary had it going on.

706
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:05,309
Money, cars, houses.

707
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,809
Used to play the stock market.

708
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:12,947
Gary was making crazy money
before he stumbled.

709
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,114
- Gave lot of it away, too.
- Yeah?

710
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,621
- To who?
- People around the way.

711
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:21,327
Anyone who needed it, really.

712
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,192
Gary was always soft.

713
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,167
Good hearted.

714
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:31,106
Let me ask you something. Why did he fall?

715
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,607
Started fooling around with that pipe.

716
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,509
Gary McCullough started out on crack?

717
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,883
That ready rock
changed the whole game around.

718
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:46,077
Used to be different.

719
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,481
Used to be rules to this shit.

720
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,857
With that rock...

721
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,395
you saw people becoming drug addicts.

722
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,026
Made heroin look like it wasn't shit.

723
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:00,325
It weren't menfolk either.

724
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,665
Had women on the pipe, children, too.

725
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,176
That's when it really started getting bad.

726
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,212
But in Gary's case...

727
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:14,208
what led him to the corner at all,
do you think?

728
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,553
I look at it like he got hurt.

729
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:24,655
He gave so much away,
and so little came back.

730
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:25,728
Hey, now.

731
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,991
You know how it is.
But the world can be that way.

732
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,397
So he's hiding the hurt in the drugs.

733
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,497
He's just like everybody else,
looking for a little love.

734
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,431
Everybody got to have some love.

735
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,038
Is there love in drugs?

736
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,539
Shit!

737
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:50,181
So what is there? I mean, I'm asking.

738
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:52,512
And I'm telling you...

739
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:56,653
every motherfucking dope fiend out here
is chasing after something...

740
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:58,893
and never quite getting there.

741
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,063
So what are you chasing, Curt?

742
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,029
Let me tell you something.

743
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:12,801
When you get that first shot of dope...

744
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:17,473
it's the best motherfucking feeling
in your life.

745
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,873
It's better than sex.

746
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:24,110
And every time after that...

747
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,184
you looking for the first time...

748
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,089
over and over again.

749
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:34,964
And?
