1
00:03:10,735 --> 00:03:12,167
Time!

2
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:14,800
Daddy!

3
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,066
Hey!

4
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,367
Whoo!

5
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,966
So how'd I do?

6
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:26,100
You did good.

7
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:27,000
See?

8
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:29,999
I did great.

9
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,571
I did great.

10
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:33,136
Hello!

11
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,470
Hello!

12
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:36,371
Marianne!

13
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:55,936
Do you think mom will let
me come back next weekend?

14
00:03:55,937 --> 00:03:57,302
I don't know.

15
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,969
Certainly couldn't hurt to ask.

16
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,000
Definitely ask.

17
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:01,569
Definitely ask.

18
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,235
Yeah.

19
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:06,569
Look, look, look.

20
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,502
See that hawk?

21
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:08,935
Mm-hmm.

22
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:09,703
Wow.

23
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:11,103
Isn't that neat?

24
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:18,036
That's beautiful.

25
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:24,969
Do you think you and mom
will ever get back together?

26
00:04:30,235 --> 00:04:33,268
You know something, baby?

27
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:37,001
Mommy and daddy love each
other very, very much.

28
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:41,334
And we love you very, very much.

29
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:42,601
We just have some
things to work out.

30
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:44,268
That's all.

31
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:45,536
Okay?

32
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:59,901
Wow.

33
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:00,000
A ladybug.

34
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,234
A ladybug.

35
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:07,133
You know something?

36
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:10,300
I think we will.

37
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:12,866
In fact, I know we will.

38
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:14,233
We'll be a family
again real soon.

39
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:15,467
You'll see.

40
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:17,201
Okay?

41
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:23,599
Now, we better get
you to school, huh?

42
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Okay, come on.

43
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:30,000
Now, your mom's gonna be
picking you up from school,

44
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:32,166
now, your mom's gonna be
picking you up from school,

45
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,166
- right?
- Yeah.

46
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,333
Okay.

47
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,366
Go to the d.I.

48
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,932
On my knees.

49
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,565
Sergeant north,
don't hurt me, please.

50
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,932
Sergeant north,
don't hurt me, please.

51
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,966
Teach me to fight
and stay alive.

52
00:05:54,033 --> 00:05:56,465
Teach me to fight
and stay alive.

53
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:58,599
I'm still a baby,
too young to die.

54
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:02,598
I'm still a baby,
too young to die.

55
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,198
Left, left.

56
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,365
All right, maggots, my name's
master sergeant John north.

57
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,198
And not only do you have
the pleasure of having me as

58
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,931
your drill sergeant, I
will also double as your

59
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:15,497
hand-to-hand combat
instructor as well.

60
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:17,398
Isn't that peachy?

61
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:21,364
Right!

62
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:22,199
Hoo!

63
00:06:27,193 --> 00:06:29,159
Let me explain something
about hand-to-hand combat,

64
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,999
gentlemen.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,725
Gentlemen.

66
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:32,591
It's not about size.
It's not about strength.

67
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,825
It's not about egos.

68
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:34,992
It's about timing.

69
00:06:34,993 --> 00:06:36,992
It's about distance.

70
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:38,725
Full time march!

71
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:40,425
It's about position.

72
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,558
See how my hand is
controlling his neck?

73
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:44,791
So that I place him
where I want him.

74
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:46,425
I bring him down.

75
00:06:46,426 --> 00:06:47,558
I lock him.

76
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:48,824
Self-infliction.

77
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,124
Left, left, right, left!

78
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,657
I'm gonna tell you right now,

79
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:54,857
it's not about size and strength
in hand-to-hand combat.

80
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:55,824
It's about you and me.

81
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:57,524
We block, parry, and enter.

82
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:58,524
Come back in.

83
00:06:58,525 --> 00:06:59,624
We slice his neck.

84
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,000
Hip position.

85
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:00,691
Hip position.

86
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:01,991
Grab your opponent.

87
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:03,424
Jugular.

88
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:04,424
Back of the skull.

89
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,090
You just crank until
you hear a snap.

90
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,457
It's all about
torque and balance.

91
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,057
War is not a game.

92
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:10,524
It's meant to be played by men,

93
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:11,856
and that's what
I'm gonna make you.

94
00:07:11,857 --> 00:07:14,123
We take our opponent's
right hand, take him,

95
00:07:14,124 --> 00:07:17,424
take him down, roll,
finish our opponent.

96
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:18,490
I'm gonna throw you,

97
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:20,051
and I'm gonna teach you
how to throw me.

98
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:29,691
Not bad.

99
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,356
Hiya, pumpkin.

100
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,456
Hi.

101
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,456
Are we going home?

102
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:40,897
We have to run a
couple of errands.

103
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,622
Why don't you say hi to Hank?

104
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay.

105
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:00,656
Okay.

106
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,689
It's me.

107
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,988
Yeah?

108
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:17,422
Are we there?

109
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:18,954
Middle of bumfuck.

110
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:19,988
Bumfuck nowhere.

111
00:08:19,989 --> 00:08:21,021
Are you with him?

112
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,355
Yeah.

113
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:24,587
Yeah, we're standing
with the man right now.

114
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,688
Can we hurry this up?

115
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:28,056
Sam's waiting for me already.

116
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:31,822
Quick time, halt!

117
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:37,722
Platoon, halt!

118
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:44,820
Order!

119
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:47,054
Halt!

120
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:47,854
Fall out.

121
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:53,654
How do you do it, sarge?

122
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,420
Got the ammo?

123
00:08:59,421 --> 00:08:59,999
Yeah, we set to go.

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,753
Yeah, we set to go.

125
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:01,821
Pay him.

126
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:10,353
We cool.

127
00:09:10,354 --> 00:09:11,553
Good.

128
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:13,520
I'm getting Dexter's
rifles tonight.

129
00:09:13,521 --> 00:09:15,253
Get your ass back to L.A.

130
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:15,920
Right.

131
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:23,419
Got an audience.

132
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,719
Well, then, take care of it.

133
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,686
Yeah.

134
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:29,852
Hi, Hank.

135
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:30,000
Hey, Darlene.

136
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,319
Hey, Darlene.

137
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,352
$10 unleaded.

138
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:33,319
Sure. How you doing today?

139
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,319
Mom?

140
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,352
Great.

141
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:36,385
There you are.

142
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:37,306
What's wrong, marianne?

143
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:43,686
No.

144
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:08,618
Mommy.

145
00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:11,184
Come on, g, let's
get out of here.

146
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:11,865
Watch the door.

147
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:16,217
Holy shit.

148
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:16,950
Marcus!

149
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:20,252
All units, code 12,
11547, cancel.

150
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:33,216
Oh, man, that's all I need.

151
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,250
Do you think you got him?

152
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:35,250
Go look.

153
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,517
Fuck you.

154
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:39,916
We be just fine.

155
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:42,549
Officer down, code 11.

156
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,351
Roger, backup units rolling.

157
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:07,115
Move sooner, move sooner.

158
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:09,282
Rock homer, rock
homer, rock homer.

159
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,216
Okay, you--

160
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:18,615
Should have known better
than to come in here

161
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:20,381
with some howdy-doody
white motherfucker,

162
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:21,648
talk like he run-d.M.C.

163
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,515
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

164
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,581
Keep it up, motherfucker.

165
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:25,548
- What?
- Keep it up.

166
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:26,749
What? Drop my ass then, man.

167
00:11:36,115 --> 00:11:39,281
One victim may be
in cardiac arrest.

168
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,081
Respond to that.

169
00:11:42,082 --> 00:11:43,315
Marianne.

170
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:44,614
I got at least
three gunmen inside.

171
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:45,614
One confirmed dead.

172
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:47,114
One dead or wounded.

173
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:48,214
They got a little girl hostage.

174
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:49,495
They say they're
gonna shoot her.

175
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,714
North!

176
00:11:57,715 --> 00:11:58,847
No, John, no!

177
00:11:58,848 --> 00:11:59,999
John!

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,281
John!

179
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,247
You want me to drop your ass,
you little mother--

180
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:03,380
Yeah, you ain't got the nerve.

181
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:04,280
Drop me, man. Drop me.

182
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:06,213
Hey, hey, hey!

183
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:07,813
Check it out.

184
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,579
All units, all units in
vicinity of willow and cherry,

185
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,613
code 30.

186
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:12,681
Proceed code 3.

187
00:12:21,048 --> 00:12:22,079
Get him out of there.

188
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,079
John, no!

189
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,647
Damn it!

190
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,680
What the fuck?

191
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,779
Hold your fire.

192
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,147
Hold your fire!

193
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:54,646
Daddy!

194
00:12:58,479 --> 00:12:59,999
You must have a death wish, boy.

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,146
You must have a death wish, boy.

196
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,745
Just take--take it easy.

197
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:07,778
The police sent me in
exchange for the girl.

198
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,678
You don't want to
hurt a little girl.

199
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:13,078
What the fuck you know about me?

200
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,145
You want to know something
about me, motherfucker?

201
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:16,111
Watch this.

202
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:16,745
Daddy!

203
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,444
Daddy.

204
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:44,942
Yeah! Yeah!

205
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,009
Yeah, what ride
you want to take?

206
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,609
White horse.

207
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:06,075
Enjoy.

208
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:08,275
Courtesy of uncle Sam.

209
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,608
What the--fucker.

210
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:39,641
Uh-oh.

211
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:53,940
Tsk, tsk.

212
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:56,073
Army's looking for you boys.

213
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:59,639
They seem to think you stole
some high-tech military ordnance

214
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,000
and then went awol.

215
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,007
And then went awol.

216
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:04,207
Today's army, I tell you.

217
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:08,411
Hey, keep it down in there!

218
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:12,178
Now, we are here
for those rare guns.

219
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:18,477
Buddy, this is fucked up.

220
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,544
We got a heavy hitter coming to
pay down for that shit tonight,

221
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,377
and when they
hear what you done,

222
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:27,477
your ass is gonna be grass.

223
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:29,343
That's very good.

224
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:29,999
You follow muhammad ali,
don't you?

225
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,076
You follow muhammad ali,
don't you?

226
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,510
You just don't dance as good.

227
00:16:37,577 --> 00:16:41,442
Now, let me explain
the situation.

228
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:45,409
I have spent the last 36
hours snorting whiskey,

229
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,743
drinking smack, and
shooting cocaine,

230
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:51,242
and visa is breathing down
my neck because my shitty

231
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,142
day job just isn't
paying the bucks.

232
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:58,109
Now, what I want to
know from you is,

233
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,999
where are the guns?

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,309
Where are the guns?

235
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,675
Man, look, we've got no
ammunition for this shit.

236
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:06,643
They're no fucking good to you.

237
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:09,742
Love ya.

238
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:11,110
Mean it.

239
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:21,642
Look into your
heart, soldier boy.

240
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:25,041
The only way you get to live
longer is if you don't tell

241
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,974
me where the guns are.

242
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:28,475
Confused?

243
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:29,999
Well, you see, then
I get to torture you.

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
Well, you see, then
I get to torture you.

245
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:34,974
No?

246
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,641
Citibank doesn't wait.

247
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:38,542
Nor do I.

248
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:44,307
I thought you were
gonna torture him.

249
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:47,073
I don't have time for that shit.

250
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:48,475
Hold this, fella.

251
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:02,008
Tsk, tsk.

252
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:12,374
Voila.

253
00:18:25,374 --> 00:18:27,139
Nobody fucking move!

254
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,373
Keep it the fuck down, man.

255
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,639
I'm trying to sleep!

256
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,000
Looks like you had
a party here tonight.

257
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,641
Looks like you had
a party here tonight.

258
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:36,106
Oh, that's sweet.

259
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:37,373
Give me some of that.

260
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:48,005
Oh, man, that smells good.

261
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:50,971
Is it my imagination, or
does the army spray this

262
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:52,438
shit with perfume
before they ship it?

263
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:56,572
Excuse me, but what do
you think you're doing?

264
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:57,571
I'm stealing this shit.

265
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:59,005
What does it look like?

266
00:18:59,006 --> 00:18:59,999
Well, coincidentally,
that's what it looks like.

267
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,005
Well, coincidentally,
that's what it looks like.

268
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:05,371
The problem is that
I'm stealing it.

269
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:07,404
We were here first.

270
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:08,504
Ooh.

271
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:11,170
Oh, yeah, well, we
called dibs on it.

272
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:14,871
Look, you take the drugs,
and we'll take the guns.

273
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:16,571
Does that sound fair?

274
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,937
Well, I hate to oversimplify,

275
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:22,237
but I got the gun, motherfucker.

276
00:19:22,238 --> 00:19:24,371
That's my point exactly.

277
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,238
You see, you got the
gun, but I got the guns.

278
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:59,203
Well, he's one
resilient son of a bitch.

279
00:19:59,204 --> 00:19:59,999
I'll give him that.

280
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,335
I'll give him that.

281
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,169
Am I in a hospital?

282
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,936
Trauma ward, sergeant.

283
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:09,070
You've been a coma for
the last eight weeks.

284
00:20:10,904 --> 00:20:12,837
What happened to me?

285
00:20:15,503 --> 00:20:17,402
You need to rest.

286
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:22,470
Doctor, according to you, I've
been resting for eight weeks.

287
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:29,999
What's the last
thing you recall?

288
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,568
What's the last
thing you recall?

289
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:33,802
I'm driving home.

290
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:43,334
Nurse.

291
00:20:43,335 --> 00:20:44,368
Darlene.

292
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,301
Nurse, nurse!

293
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:47,168
Nurse!

294
00:20:48,302 --> 00:20:50,067
Nurse!

295
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:51,068
Quick.

296
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:15,467
Dr. Brock, your patient
is ready in radiology.

297
00:21:15,468 --> 00:21:18,933
Can't keep a good man
down, huh, sergeant?

298
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,900
It's good to see you.

299
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:21,966
It's good to see you.

300
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:24,766
Allen,

301
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:29,466
these people
won't tell me anything.

302
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:29,999
They won't even let
me see my little girl.

303
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,933
They won't even let
me see my little girl.

304
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:36,966
John.

305
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:39,833
Allen.

306
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,033
Please, god, Allen.

307
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,467
She's alive, right?

308
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:49,033
Technically.

309
00:22:54,031 --> 00:22:56,663
Which are you,
a lawyer or a cop?

310
00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:59,999
Kid, I am the cop.

311
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,730
Kid, I am the cop.

312
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:04,796
Federal agent Karl savak.

313
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,329
Think you could have taken any
longer getting me out of there?

314
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,795
Fuck you.

315
00:23:10,796 --> 00:23:12,663
You know the song and dance
I had to do

316
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:14,129
for the U.S. attorney?

317
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,929
Piece of shit like you.

318
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,629
I had to pull smoke and
mirrors right out of my ass

319
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,795
just to get them to believe
we needed you to take down

320
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:22,162
Dexter Kane.

321
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:23,762
Oh, I'm sorry.

322
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:25,996
I haven't thanked you properly.

323
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:27,829
Thank you for getting me out,

324
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,862
and fuck you while I'm at it.

325
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:30,000
I wouldn't have been in
there in the first place if

326
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,829
I wouldn't have been in
there in the first place if

327
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,862
I hadn't been looking for
ammunition for guns you

328
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:35,295
couldn't even fucking get.

329
00:23:35,296 --> 00:23:36,295
Yeah?

330
00:23:36,296 --> 00:23:37,295
Yeah.

331
00:23:37,296 --> 00:23:39,128
Well, why do you
think you're out?

332
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:42,061
To find out who ripped you off?

333
00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:44,028
I don't think so.

334
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:46,828
You promised Dexter Kane
guns you couldn't deliver.

335
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:48,594
That's your problem.

336
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:51,229
I ain't in your dog
and pony show no more.

337
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:56,028
I'm just trying to get me a
little money together

338
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:57,729
and slide on down to Mexico.

339
00:24:00,161 --> 00:24:01,595
Keep the change.

340
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:08,927
You're gonna be in my
dog and pony show

341
00:24:08,928 --> 00:24:11,261
until the pony dies, pony.

342
00:24:11,262 --> 00:24:12,660
What do you think this is
monopoly?

343
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:15,894
And you have a
get out of jail free card?

344
00:24:15,895 --> 00:24:19,160
You killed a little girl.

345
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:22,793
Now you'll do what I say, or
you're gonna be blowing your

346
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,627
chunks in the gas chamber.

347
00:24:25,628 --> 00:24:27,660
It's a beautiful day.

348
00:24:27,661 --> 00:24:28,628
Enjoy it.

349
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:44,626
When a child is taken
from us in this useless way,

350
00:24:44,627 --> 00:24:46,526
we cannot understand it.

351
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,059
Our faith is tested.

352
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:52,559
But we must stand strong,
for there is method in madness.

353
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,292
And though we may
long for recourse,

354
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,759
we are taught it is holier
in his eyes to turn the

355
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,192
other cheek,
that we shall not kill,

356
00:24:59,193 --> 00:24:59,999
and that vengeance is his.

357
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,059
And that vengeance is his.

358
00:25:15,526 --> 00:25:16,558
Miss Adams?

359
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,525
Hi.

360
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:18,691
John north.

361
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:19,892
We spoke on the phone.

362
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,958
Oh, yes, have a seat, Mr. north.

363
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:24,491
Thank you.

364
00:25:24,492 --> 00:25:26,157
Now, when we last
spoke, miss Adams,

365
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,625
I had told you that the
federal marshals had

366
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:29,999
transported the prisoner
that killed my family

367
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,625
transported the prisoner
that killed my family

368
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:31,891
down here to L.A.

369
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:33,691
If you remember, you were
gonna find out what was

370
00:25:33,692 --> 00:25:34,758
happening with the case.

371
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,991
Yes.

372
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,191
It turns out the FBI took
immediate custody of the

373
00:25:38,192 --> 00:25:42,491
prisoner, and all information
on the case is sealed.

374
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:43,757
Sealed?

375
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:45,157
What exactly does that mean?

376
00:25:45,158 --> 00:25:46,690
Right.

377
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:50,824
You'll have to talk to
this man, agent Karl savak.

378
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:52,925
He's running control
on the case now.

379
00:25:55,691 --> 00:25:57,490
Psst, mom.

380
00:25:57,491 --> 00:25:58,658
Yeah, come on.

381
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:07,990
Mikey, that's bad.

382
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:09,156
It's true.

383
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:11,123
Yeah, well, you will be
home for dinner, right?

384
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:12,123
Yeah, mom.

385
00:26:12,124 --> 00:26:13,589
Mm-hmm.

386
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,789
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boy, when
you see your mother talking

387
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,123
to someone, you don't ignore
them as if they're not there.

388
00:26:18,124 --> 00:26:21,823
Now, this is sergeant north.
Say hello.

389
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,723
What kind of sergeant are you?

390
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:25,789
I'm in the army, son.

391
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,456
You ever kill anybody?

392
00:26:28,457 --> 00:26:29,689
Michael.

393
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,000
Okay, mom, I'm gone.

394
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:31,489
Okay, mom, I'm gone.

395
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,489
No, you better give me a kiss
before you walk out that door.

396
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,189
Thank you.

397
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,422
Sorry.

398
00:26:37,423 --> 00:26:39,489
No, it's no problem.

399
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,989
Must be tough raising
a kid around here.

400
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,655
I'll be honest
with you, Mr. north.

401
00:26:44,656 --> 00:26:46,089
It's a daily battle.

402
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,688
These streets hold a magnetism
for a boy Mikey's age.

403
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:50,855
He's 12 years old, and he
knows those streets as well

404
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:51,922
as any gang banger.

405
00:26:51,923 --> 00:26:55,522
Well, what about his father?

406
00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:57,388
His father.

407
00:26:57,389 --> 00:26:58,888
Please.

408
00:26:58,889 --> 00:26:59,999
Frankly, he's a
part of the problem.

409
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,455
Frankly, he's a
part of the problem.

410
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:02,954
That's too bad.

411
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,488
Anyway, Mr. north, what
agent savak's interest is in

412
00:27:05,489 --> 00:27:08,421
the man that you're looking
for, you'll have to ask him.

413
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:09,521
Fine.

414
00:27:09,522 --> 00:27:10,842
How do I get a
hold of Karl savak?

415
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:15,854
Sergeant.

416
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:17,821
Agent Carl savak.

417
00:27:17,822 --> 00:27:20,454
Agent tam, agent klark.

418
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:24,854
So how can I help you?

419
00:27:24,855 --> 00:27:28,587
My family was murdered
eight weeks ago

420
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:29,999
in a convenience store, and the
man who did it is currently

421
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,454
in a convenience store, and the
man who did it is currently

422
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:34,686
being held here
under FBI custody.

423
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:37,853
I was also instructed to
contact agent Karl savak,

424
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:40,853
and he would be able to give
me some information about that.

425
00:27:40,854 --> 00:27:41,920
I can't comment.

426
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:43,419
I'm sorry.

427
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,686
Whoa.

428
00:27:44,687 --> 00:27:46,353
Wait a minute.

429
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:47,853
You don't understand something.

430
00:27:47,854 --> 00:27:51,386
See, this is son of a bitch

431
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:55,986
murdered my wife

432
00:27:55,987 --> 00:27:58,720
and my baby girl.

433
00:27:58,721 --> 00:27:59,999
I am not uncompassionate.

434
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,886
I am not uncompassionate.

435
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:07,519
This man is currently
under federal protection.

436
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:15,520
I cannot divulge any information
about him at this time.

437
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:20,452
He's being held under
federal protection.

438
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:22,418
Our job is law enforcement.

439
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:25,418
Sometimes we have to turn a
blind eye to smaller crimes

440
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:27,552
in order to solve the big ones.

441
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:29,999
Did I just hear you call
the murder of my wife

442
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,619
did I just hear you call
the murder of my wife

443
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,452
and child a small crime?

444
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:34,684
Whoa.

445
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:37,518
Whoa, whoa, whoa, time out.

446
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,985
This case is already
very complicated.

447
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:43,551
But when a man such
as Dexter Kane,

448
00:28:43,552 --> 00:28:46,851
an extremely organized
venice drug lord,

449
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,885
starts trying to buy
military ordnance,

450
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:55,917
that's a larger
consideration for us.

451
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:59,999
This son of a bitch is
on the streets, isn't he?

452
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,252
This son of a bitch is
on the streets, isn't he?

453
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:04,351
That's all for today, sergeant.

454
00:29:04,352 --> 00:29:06,750
No, it's not.

455
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:07,951
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

456
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:16,550
You're gonna give me the name
of the man who killed my family.

457
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:19,316
I'd let him go.

458
00:29:19,317 --> 00:29:19,950
Now!

459
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:35,782
You do not want to fuck with me.

460
00:29:35,783 --> 00:29:37,482
Yeah.

461
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:38,783
I do.

462
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:48,315
Blow is dead.

463
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:50,716
Smack coming back in
a big way, Mr. Kane.

464
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:53,582
Now I know your war with the
cops got you shut down on

465
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,616
the streets.

466
00:29:54,617 --> 00:29:56,982
I am the alchemist, Mr. Kane.

467
00:29:56,983 --> 00:29:58,882
You got some blow
you can't unload,

468
00:29:58,883 --> 00:29:59,999
I can turn it around
into smack like that.

469
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,948
I can turn it around
into smack like that.

470
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:04,382
Normally I wouldn't come
and off end you in this way,

471
00:30:04,383 --> 00:30:06,915
but I got to do some traveling,

472
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,236
and I need to make
some fast cash.

473
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:14,581
So where you been the
past couple of months?

474
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:17,882
I was back east, family matter.

475
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:19,681
A family man.

476
00:30:19,682 --> 00:30:22,248
I wouldn't have
pegged you for that.

477
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:24,681
Blood is everything.

478
00:30:24,682 --> 00:30:28,181
I couldn't agree with
you more, Mr. Kane.

479
00:30:28,182 --> 00:30:29,915
But if I could just
get one key--

480
00:30:37,448 --> 00:30:39,448
Motherfucker was down
at the park.

481
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:57,846
Shh.

482
00:30:57,847 --> 00:30:59,613
Shh.

483
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:00,000
Relax.

484
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:02,146
Relax.

485
00:31:02,147 --> 00:31:03,147
Let it go.

486
00:31:09,514 --> 00:31:12,846
I'm sorry. What was that?

487
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:16,546
If I could just get
one trial key, Mr. Kane,

488
00:31:16,547 --> 00:31:19,846
I could turn it around at
2k of heroine in 72 hours.

489
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:40,112
I wouldn't lie about that.

490
00:31:48,246 --> 00:31:49,212
Thank you.

491
00:31:57,478 --> 00:31:59,999
Yo, homey.

492
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,112
Yo, homey.

493
00:32:00,113 --> 00:32:02,211
What size shoe you wear?

494
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,410
None of your
business, that's what.

495
00:32:04,411 --> 00:32:06,410
All right.

496
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:07,245
Fuck you too.

497
00:32:14,512 --> 00:32:16,078
Man, ain't that Ricky?

498
00:32:18,512 --> 00:32:19,611
Nah.

499
00:32:19,612 --> 00:32:22,410
That ain't him.

500
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:24,511
Yeah-huh, that's him.

501
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:25,677
Damn.

502
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:25,275
All right.

503
00:33:25,276 --> 00:33:26,316
I'm gonna give you a shot.

504
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:30,000
Put it away, man.

505
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:31,342
Put it away, man.

506
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:38,007
Now, where you taking
that, little man?

507
00:33:38,008 --> 00:33:39,508
Compton.

508
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:41,107
What bus you taking?

509
00:33:41,108 --> 00:33:42,741
19.

510
00:33:42,742 --> 00:33:44,474
What you trading up for?

511
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:45,974
Smack.

512
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:47,374
Two key.

513
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,241
My main little man.

514
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,741
Take after his daddy.

515
00:33:57,175 --> 00:33:59,007
You like that?

516
00:33:59,008 --> 00:33:59,999
Yeah.

517
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,607
Yeah.

518
00:34:00,608 --> 00:34:02,306
You ever see a dude capped?

519
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,474
Yeah.

520
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,973
You fuck this up,
you gonna get capped.

521
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:14,573
Don't be stopping,
talking to your homies.

522
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,273
Just get your ass
down to Compton.

523
00:34:16,274 --> 00:34:19,606
Well, I need my money now,
all right?

524
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:24,372
You'll get your money when
you get back with the smack.

525
00:34:24,373 --> 00:34:26,173
Man, I said I need it.

526
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:28,106
Well, why do you need it?

527
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,999
Now, I need it now.

528
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,840
Now, I need it now.

529
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:36,405
In that case,

530
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:38,039
let me set you up.

531
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,372
Don't fuck this up.

532
00:34:46,373 --> 00:34:47,939
Yeah.

533
00:35:52,871 --> 00:35:54,171
How about that?

534
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,903
That's it.

535
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:00,000
Can you put that
on a man's neck?

536
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:02,202
Can you put that
on a man's neck?

537
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,603
Yeah, I put that on
a guy's neck before.

538
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:05,903
Whose?

539
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,969
What do you want him for?

540
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,102
I'm gonna give him the
community service award,

541
00:36:13,103 --> 00:36:14,402
all right?

542
00:36:14,403 --> 00:36:16,302
Just tell me who he is.

543
00:36:16,303 --> 00:36:21,368
Well, Marcus is
a friend of ours.

544
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:25,202
So I figure any message
you want to give to him,

545
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:28,369
you can just give to us, man.

546
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:40,068
I really don't think you
want the message I'm gonna

547
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:41,934
give to Marcus.

548
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,869
I think we do.

549
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:47,902
All right.

550
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,033
Did you get the message?

551
00:37:18,034 --> 00:37:19,366
I got it.

552
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,001
Where can I find this Marcus?

553
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,900
Okay, okay!

554
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:29,166
Where can I find--

555
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:29,999
I don't-- I don't know, man.

556
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,466
I don't-- I don't know, man.

557
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:34,032
He--he come in here, a
needle and some teardrops,

558
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:36,032
and he was asking about
some fucking guns and stuff.

559
00:37:36,033 --> 00:37:37,066
That's all I know.

560
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:38,032
I swear.

561
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:39,199
What kind of guns?

562
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,266
They were, like,
I don't know, man.

563
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:43,266
Like, rifles, military stuff.

564
00:37:43,267 --> 00:37:44,266
I don't know.

565
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:46,932
What does a teardrop signify?

566
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:50,033
You get another one added
every time you kill somebody.

567
00:38:00,766 --> 00:38:01,932
Bang.

568
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,765
Pow.

569
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:25,297
Left, left, left, right, left.

570
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:29,130
Left, left, left, right, left.

571
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:29,999
Hi, John. It's me.

572
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,830
Hi, John. It's me.

573
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:32,763
I haven't had any luck
with this Marcus character.

574
00:38:32,764 --> 00:38:34,097
Yeah?

575
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:36,431
Well, agent savak's a
much more interesting story,

576
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:38,397
because even though he's
one of the most decorated

577
00:38:38,398 --> 00:38:39,763
officers they have,

578
00:38:39,764 --> 00:38:41,730
he's under internal affairs
investigation.

579
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:42,797
Yeah, that's no surprise,

580
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:44,363
but what does all that mean,
Allen?

581
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,897
Well, to me, it
looks like he's dirty.

582
00:38:46,898 --> 00:38:49,196
All right, listen,
this is what I got.

583
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:52,697
Marcus is trafficking some sort
of military ordnance down here.

584
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:55,196
If savak's dirty, I got
to think he's tied in with

585
00:38:55,197 --> 00:38:56,630
Marcus on that.

586
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:58,663
I don't know, is there any
way you can find an address

587
00:38:58,664 --> 00:38:59,763
on savak?

588
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:00,000
I'll see what I can do.

589
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:00,730
I'll see what I can do.

590
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:01,930
Thanks, Allen.

591
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,129
Yeah.

592
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,662
I understand you're in
the market for some guns.

593
00:39:17,663 --> 00:39:20,063
Well, you heard wrong.

594
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,229
Who is this?

595
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,963
Well, that's not
really important, is it?

596
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:27,662
What is, though, is what I
got and what you're looking for.

597
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:29,999
Well, like I said,
you--you've got bad information.

598
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,995
Well, like I said,
you--you've got bad information.

599
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,028
Just out of curiosity,

600
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:39,362
who gave you this bad
information?

601
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:41,761
And who gave you my number?

602
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:42,762
Marcus.

603
00:39:47,295 --> 00:39:51,361
I don't have the slightest
idea what you're talking about,

604
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:54,761
but I don't want
to be impolite either,

605
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:56,927
so please continue.

606
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,628
Yeah, I thought so.

607
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,999
Tell you what, I'm gonna be
at Hollywood and vine

608
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,760
tell you what, I'm gonna be
at Hollywood and vine

609
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:02,294
in 15 minutes.

610
00:40:02,295 --> 00:40:03,861
You be there if
you're interested.

611
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:05,261
You can count on me being there

612
00:40:05,262 --> 00:40:07,228
because I will need
to arrest you.

613
00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:10,594
Hey, savak, I'm gonna
want to see some cash now.

614
00:40:10,595 --> 00:40:12,127
I'm talking thick.

615
00:40:12,128 --> 00:40:14,962
Well, how will I
know what you--damn.

616
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:23,027
Seeing is as close
as you're gonna get.

617
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:28,661
Your car, Mr. savak.

618
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:45,126
You packing heat?

619
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:46,726
Uh-uh.

620
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:48,594
Then what good are you?

621
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,960
Let's go see Dexter.

622
00:41:28,725 --> 00:41:29,999
This guy's living
pretty high for a cop.

623
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,640
This guy's living
pretty high for a cop.

624
00:41:47,492 --> 00:41:49,024
Slob.

625
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,999
Pallet 21, mpa-3 rifles
stolen, fort Scott.

626
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,991
Pallet 21, mpa-3 rifles
stolen, fort Scott.

627
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:06,957
Got you.

628
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,490
Look, two months ago, you
came to me and told me about

629
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:12,990
some guns that got jacked
off a military base

630
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,890
and they had hit the streets
and the price was a hundred gs.

631
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:19,423
I gave you 50 g's down.

632
00:42:19,424 --> 00:42:20,690
Where the fuck my guns?

633
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:23,423
Deal went south.

634
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:24,656
Cops.

635
00:42:24,657 --> 00:42:27,622
Look, I want my
money or my guns.

636
00:42:27,623 --> 00:42:29,999
Or you can just
relax and let it go.

637
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,422
Or you can just
relax and let it go.

638
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:34,957
The police got the money too.

639
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:44,689
Look, I may be a cop,
but I'm not stupid.

640
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,622
I said I'd deliver the guns.

641
00:42:49,623 --> 00:42:51,088
And I will.

642
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:53,821
I just need to
talk to my sources.

643
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:55,088
Look around you.

644
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:57,522
Don't you realize the only
way you ever gonna talk

645
00:42:57,523 --> 00:42:59,999
again is through one of them
straight-up psychic bitches?

646
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,021
Again is through one of them
straight-up psychic bitches?

647
00:43:01,022 --> 00:43:03,855
Then I guess I'll be
telling you all how your fat

648
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:06,822
black mama was sucking
my dick in hell.

649
00:43:09,822 --> 00:43:14,454
Look, let's not play
with each other.

650
00:43:14,455 --> 00:43:19,120
I said I would
deliver your guns.

651
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:20,855
And I can.

652
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:29,955
It's just gonna be a little
difficult to do, dead.

653
00:43:35,688 --> 00:43:36,887
Sergeant Williams?

654
00:43:36,888 --> 00:43:38,587
Sergeant north.

655
00:43:38,588 --> 00:43:40,119
I phoned earlier
about pallet 21.

656
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,687
Oh, yeah.

657
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:47,520
Pallet 21's a shipment of
mpa-3 high-velocity rifles.

658
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:48,919
Experimental.

659
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,587
Very nasty piece of ordnance.

660
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:51,620
You said the weapons.

661
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:53,487
What about the ammo?

662
00:43:53,488 --> 00:43:54,520
Affirmative.

663
00:43:54,521 --> 00:43:55,819
Munitions weren't on base.

664
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,619
Typical dispatch fuckup.

665
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,819
Well, if they're a prototype,

666
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,999
the ammo's impossible to find.

667
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,819
The ammo's impossible to find.

668
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,385
Weapon's useless without it.

669
00:44:03,386 --> 00:44:05,686
Maybe that's why a case
of it was stolen up in your

670
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:07,786
neck of the woods
about ten weeks ago.

671
00:44:07,787 --> 00:44:09,919
It was recovered when a
couple of civilians tried to

672
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,085
shoot their way out of a
convenience store up there.

673
00:44:12,086 --> 00:44:13,787
Killed two military dependents.

674
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,819
What's so special
about these weapons?

675
00:44:33,686 --> 00:44:36,719
Sergeant, go ahead.

676
00:44:38,419 --> 00:44:39,786
Fire at will.

677
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,683
That kid Mikey
ain't got here yet.

678
00:45:23,684 --> 00:45:25,283
What you mean he
ain't there yet?

679
00:45:25,284 --> 00:45:26,716
He was supposed
to come on the 19.

680
00:45:26,717 --> 00:45:27,950
He's supposed to
be there by now.

681
00:45:27,951 --> 00:45:29,549
Well, he ain't, and
I ain't gonna sit on

682
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,000
these--much longer.

683
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:30,749
These--much longer.

684
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,683
And that base better not
be cut with no goddamn rat

685
00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:33,816
poison this time.

686
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,516
Yeah, all right,
all right, all right.

687
00:45:35,517 --> 00:45:36,916
Look, just--just--just--he's

688
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:38,449
probably on the
next bus right now.

689
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,783
Just chill and call
me when he gets there.

690
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:41,849
Dexter's pissed.

691
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,950
Yeah.

692
00:45:57,483 --> 00:45:59,999
Man, you ain't carrying
no base for no Dexter.

693
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,382
Man, you ain't carrying
no base for no Dexter.

694
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,682
Yeah, what's that?

695
00:46:01,683 --> 00:46:02,682
Damn.

696
00:46:02,683 --> 00:46:03,950
Here let me touch it.

697
00:46:06,783 --> 00:46:08,515
Yo, man, that's
some dope base, man.

698
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,615
That's a pound man.

699
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:11,348
Yeah, well, check this.

700
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:13,381
Solid.

701
00:46:13,382 --> 00:46:15,482
Cool.

702
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:17,348
Hey, man, what the
fuck you looking at?

703
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:18,681
Chill, chill, he's a cop.
He's a cop.

704
00:46:18,682 --> 00:46:20,415
Look, I don't care
if he's spider-man.

705
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:21,848
I am gonna fuck him up.

706
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:23,181
Yeah, well, just chill.

707
00:46:23,182 --> 00:46:24,747
Well, I got to jam
to practice, man.

708
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:25,747
Later.

709
00:46:25,748 --> 00:46:26,814
Yeah, we'll see you later.

710
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,882
Yeah, later.

711
00:46:45,647 --> 00:46:48,347
Yeah, then he says
it's none of my business.

712
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:49,314
You believe that?

713
00:46:49,315 --> 00:46:50,347
Right.

714
00:46:50,348 --> 00:46:52,347
None too cool.

715
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:54,215
Who's cool?

716
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,779
So this fool, he tried
to fucking b.A. Me and shit.

717
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,513
Blasted him off his
fucking surfboard.

718
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:15,834
The dude was pissing
in his pants.

719
00:47:20,513 --> 00:47:21,813
What the fuck you looking at?

720
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:28,378
I said what the fuck
are you looking at?

721
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:29,999
You chump!

722
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,112
You chump!

723
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,145
Yo, yo, man, yo.

724
00:47:31,146 --> 00:47:32,245
Get lost.

725
00:47:32,246 --> 00:47:34,378
You're dead, little man.

726
00:47:34,379 --> 00:47:35,378
Take it easy now.

727
00:47:35,379 --> 00:47:37,178
I'm not gonna hurt you.

728
00:47:37,179 --> 00:47:41,512
Just want to ask you a
couple of questions now--

729
00:47:41,513 --> 00:47:43,111
Then give it back.

730
00:47:43,112 --> 00:47:44,611
Look, I said take it easy.

731
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,378
Man, I'll fuck you up.

732
00:47:46,379 --> 00:47:47,478
That's my school bag.

733
00:47:47,479 --> 00:47:48,578
Is that right?

734
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:49,659
Well, let's check that out.

735
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:55,511
That's one hell of
a class load, kid.

736
00:47:55,512 --> 00:47:56,592
What's this for, chemistry?

737
00:48:14,445 --> 00:48:16,345
Son of a bitch!

738
00:48:50,376 --> 00:48:51,376
Well, look who's back.

739
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,409
Anyway, you said you'd
give me my bag back.

740
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:06,409
Yeah, sure.

741
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,310
Here you go.

742
00:49:12,443 --> 00:49:14,741
It ain't got everything
that was in it.

743
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:17,242
I know.

744
00:49:17,243 --> 00:49:19,508
How well do you know
the streets, Mikey?

745
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:21,241
I know 'em hard.

746
00:49:21,242 --> 00:49:22,241
So what?

747
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:24,141
You think you
could spread a rumor?

748
00:49:24,142 --> 00:49:25,341
Fast?

749
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:26,408
Yeah.

750
00:49:26,409 --> 00:49:28,007
So?

751
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:29,999
So you want your bag back?

752
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,120
So you want your bag back?

753
00:50:23,474 --> 00:50:24,507
You Mikey?

754
00:50:28,474 --> 00:50:29,999
Maybe.

755
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,039
Maybe.

756
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,439
Let's go. We got to talk.

757
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,072
I can talk fine right here.

758
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:38,605
Word is you're down with
some army dude who's got

759
00:50:38,606 --> 00:50:40,073
some bullets we're looking for.

760
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,338
Well, well.

761
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:50,338
Maybe I'll help you,
and maybe I won't.

762
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:53,172
Or maybe this dude got
something I want too.

763
00:51:27,605 --> 00:51:28,904
Man, you're lucky.

764
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:34,438
That's funny.
I don't feel lucky.

765
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:50,503
My bag.

766
00:51:50,504 --> 00:51:52,470
It's in the trunk of
your car, ain't it?

767
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:54,037
Could be.

768
00:51:55,437 --> 00:51:58,169
Yeah.

769
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,999
Well, anyway, you
know how you, um,

770
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,536
well, anyway, you
know how you, um,

771
00:52:01,537 --> 00:52:05,369
told me to spread the word
about those bullets, right?

772
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:07,037
Yeah.

773
00:52:09,337 --> 00:52:12,570
So some guys came down
to the beach last night.

774
00:52:21,403 --> 00:52:23,569
So do you really
have them bullets?

775
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,935
Nope.

776
00:52:24,936 --> 00:52:27,302
Then why are you making
me say that you did?

777
00:52:27,303 --> 00:52:28,835
To get to the guns.

778
00:52:28,836 --> 00:52:29,999
The guy I'm looking
for is after them.

779
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,235
The guy I'm looking
for is after them.

780
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:34,002
I get there first,
he comes to me.

781
00:52:44,836 --> 00:52:46,001
You sure this is the place?

782
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:49,301
Yeah, this is the place.

783
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:50,435
Wait here.

784
00:53:13,135 --> 00:53:14,333
Don't be a stranger.

785
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:15,334
Come on in.

786
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:27,500
Damn.

787
00:53:27,501 --> 00:53:29,034
What you got in the bag?

788
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:38,432
What do you boys plan
on doing with these guns?

789
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:40,332
Oh, we're gonna take
the town over, brah.

790
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,966
You writing a book?

791
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:45,098
No, I'm closing one.

792
00:53:45,099 --> 00:53:46,900
What the fuck?
This isn't ammunition.

793
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,732
Do something about this.

794
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:53,732
One sec.

795
00:53:59,133 --> 00:53:59,999
911?

796
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,400
911?

797
00:54:00,401 --> 00:54:02,399
I'm at 203 rose street.

798
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,899
I'm gonna need five
ambulances right away.

799
00:54:39,932 --> 00:54:40,931
Damn.

800
00:54:40,932 --> 00:54:42,097
Asshole.

801
00:55:10,697 --> 00:55:11,964
So where you learn all that?

802
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:18,729
Around, different places.

803
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:21,262
Hey, you think you could
teach someone like me?

804
00:55:21,263 --> 00:55:23,728
Yeah, probably.

805
00:55:23,729 --> 00:55:27,062
What would you do with it?

806
00:55:27,063 --> 00:55:28,728
Kick someone's ass.

807
00:55:28,729 --> 00:55:29,999
Then probably not.

808
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,628
Then probably not.

809
00:55:30,629 --> 00:55:33,862
So you just use it on that
kid like yesterday, Mikey.

810
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,962
Nah, I don't need it for him.

811
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:39,628
I'm gonna kill him.

812
00:55:39,629 --> 00:55:41,061
Listen to you, Mikey.

813
00:55:41,062 --> 00:55:43,595
You're 12 years old.

814
00:55:43,596 --> 00:55:45,728
Aren't you worried about jail?

815
00:55:45,729 --> 00:55:47,261
Why should I be
worried about jail?

816
00:55:47,262 --> 00:55:49,761
I ain't old enough.

817
00:55:49,762 --> 00:55:51,522
You got a answer for
everything, don't you?

818
00:55:58,595 --> 00:55:59,961
What's killing him gonna do?

819
00:55:59,962 --> 00:56:00,000
Is it gonna bring your
friend back, Mikey?

820
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:01,828
Is it gonna bring your
friend back, Mikey?

821
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:04,894
It's gonna make me feel good.

822
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:08,327
That's what it's
going to accomplish.

823
00:56:08,328 --> 00:56:09,993
Then forget it.

824
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:11,828
No.

825
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:13,127
Well, why not?

826
00:56:13,128 --> 00:56:14,127
You do it.

827
00:56:14,128 --> 00:56:15,127
No, Mikey.

828
00:56:15,128 --> 00:56:16,194
No.

829
00:56:16,195 --> 00:56:17,594
It's different.

830
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:19,561
You think that's what I'm doing,

831
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:20,827
just kicking ass
just to kick ass?

832
00:56:20,828 --> 00:56:22,227
I don't know what you're doing,

833
00:56:22,228 --> 00:56:23,194
so why don't you tell me?

834
00:56:23,195 --> 00:56:24,155
What are you doing here?

835
00:56:27,128 --> 00:56:28,127
Looking for somebody.

836
00:56:28,128 --> 00:56:29,326
Yeah.

837
00:56:29,327 --> 00:56:29,999
Well, what you gonna
do when you find him?

838
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,640
Well, what you gonna
do when you find him?

839
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,293
That's my business.

840
00:56:39,294 --> 00:56:41,760
All right.

841
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:44,026
Yeah.

842
00:56:44,027 --> 00:56:46,060
Anyway, I need my 25 back.

843
00:56:49,127 --> 00:56:50,859
Nice try.

844
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,159
Look, I ain't gonna
kill nobody, all right?

845
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,559
Then what do you
need the gun for?

846
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,759
To protect myself.

847
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,092
Mikey, I'm watching out for you.

848
00:56:58,093 --> 00:56:59,592
I'll protect you.

849
00:56:59,593 --> 00:57:00,000
Man, you ain't protecting
or watching out for shit.

850
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:02,092
Man, you ain't protecting
or watching out for shit.

851
00:57:02,093 --> 00:57:04,992
I ain't got a gun on the street,

852
00:57:04,993 --> 00:57:08,692
that kid who dropped Ricky,
he gonna drop me too.

853
00:57:08,693 --> 00:57:11,626
And there ain't nothing you
can do to change that, bro.

854
00:57:23,092 --> 00:57:25,891
Look, Mikey, I'm
not your father.

855
00:57:25,892 --> 00:57:29,958
I am not here to run your life
or to judge you.

856
00:57:29,959 --> 00:57:30,000
Yeah.

857
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:30,926
Yeah.

858
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:48,058
Mikey!

859
00:57:56,624 --> 00:57:58,857
All right, all right, come on!

860
00:57:58,858 --> 00:57:59,999
Go, go, go.

861
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,557
Go, go, go.

862
00:58:00,558 --> 00:58:01,723
So who's playing?

863
00:58:01,724 --> 00:58:03,458
D.A. And FBI.

864
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:09,223
Welcome back to the
winning team, pony.

865
00:58:09,224 --> 00:58:10,856
Man, you're
totally fucking nuts.

866
00:58:10,857 --> 00:58:13,223
You know this is a
motherfucking cop convention.

867
00:58:13,224 --> 00:58:15,123
It's playoff week.

868
00:58:15,124 --> 00:58:17,123
D.A.' S got a good team.

869
00:58:17,124 --> 00:58:19,756
Good eye!

870
00:58:19,757 --> 00:58:23,622
So tell me, when am I
meeting that redhead prick

871
00:58:23,623 --> 00:58:25,422
who stole my guns?

872
00:58:25,423 --> 00:58:26,422
You ain't.

873
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:27,523
Red's got Jack.

874
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,589
Are you trying to
fuck me again, pony?

875
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:35,889
No.

876
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:39,489
Just saying Dexter Kane
jacked him up for the guns.

877
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:40,923
Horse shit!

878
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:46,955
If Dexter Kane had jacked
him up for the guns,

879
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:50,721
he wouldn't be saying shit,
because first and foremost,

880
00:58:50,722 --> 00:58:52,056
they'd be dead.

881
00:59:02,055 --> 00:59:03,955
That's what they're saying.

882
00:59:22,855 --> 00:59:24,954
Remember me, asshole?

883
00:59:24,955 --> 00:59:27,987
You jacked my guns in a
crack house a few months ago?

884
00:59:27,988 --> 00:59:29,999
Now, who's got my guns?

885
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,520
Now, who's got my guns?

886
00:59:32,521 --> 00:59:33,488
Suck me!

887
00:59:35,388 --> 00:59:36,621
Really?

888
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:40,387
Some army cat, man.

889
00:59:40,388 --> 00:59:41,620
I don't know.

890
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:43,986
What do you mean some army cat?

891
00:59:43,987 --> 00:59:45,753
What, like, one person?

892
00:59:45,754 --> 00:59:48,053
That's impossible, surely.

893
00:59:48,054 --> 00:59:50,519
I'm telling you,
it was some kid.

894
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,053
Mikey something.

895
00:59:52,054 --> 00:59:53,054
Really?

896
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,999
Now, guess how Webster
defines inferno.

897
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,753
Now, guess how Webster
defines inferno.

898
01:00:00,754 --> 01:00:01,887
Oh! No!

899
01:00:44,452 --> 01:00:45,517
All right, man.

900
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:47,385
Stop sweating me. Come on!

901
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:54,952
We best take this inside.

902
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,550
Don't you fight me.

903
01:01:29,551 --> 01:01:30,000
Don't you dare fight me.

904
01:01:30,001 --> 01:01:30,961
Don't you dare fight me.

905
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:38,516
Savak, man, this ain't cool.

906
01:01:38,517 --> 01:01:41,349
Shut up, and be
glad it's not you.

907
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:42,816
Savak.

908
01:01:42,817 --> 01:01:43,750
Savak!

909
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:55,449
Now, you are gonna set
up a powwow with your army

910
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:59,415
buddy and pronto, you got it?

911
01:01:59,416 --> 01:01:59,999
What the fuck you looking at?

912
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,200
What the fuck you looking at?

913
01:02:04,782 --> 01:02:06,382
- What's up?
- How you doing?

914
01:02:06,383 --> 01:02:07,383
Good.

915
01:02:11,383 --> 01:02:14,648
Mr. north.

916
01:02:14,649 --> 01:02:19,181
What are you doing
sitting on my steps?

917
01:02:19,182 --> 01:02:20,881
You all right?

918
01:02:20,882 --> 01:02:22,214
Yeah.

919
01:02:22,215 --> 01:02:22,749
Sure.

920
01:02:24,649 --> 01:02:28,581
No.

921
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:29,999
I understand, Mr. north.

922
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,040
I understand, Mr. north.

923
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:36,781
I understand what it's like
to live with pain every day.

924
01:02:42,248 --> 01:02:43,513
Do you?

925
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:44,814
Mm-hmm.

926
01:02:44,815 --> 01:02:48,447
My boy acts tough, but he's not.

927
01:02:48,448 --> 01:02:51,380
Last night he came home,

928
01:02:51,381 --> 01:02:54,346
and I knew right away
something had happened.

929
01:02:54,347 --> 01:02:58,280
And I'll never
know exactly what.

930
01:02:58,281 --> 01:02:59,779
Well, the truth of the
matter is, one night,

931
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:00,000
he's not gonna come home.

932
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:02,813
He's not gonna come home.

933
01:03:02,814 --> 01:03:06,146
And I'll never know exactly
what happened then either.

934
01:03:06,147 --> 01:03:08,381
That's what I live
with every day.

935
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:19,712
Come on, now.

936
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,179
Come on.

937
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,312
Come here.

938
01:03:22,313 --> 01:03:23,412
Come in.

939
01:03:23,413 --> 01:03:25,180
Come on. Come on.

940
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,245
You all right?

941
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:36,213
Everything okay?

942
01:03:48,279 --> 01:03:49,112
I guess not.

943
01:03:51,879 --> 01:03:55,245
Look, Mikey, I owe
you an apology.

944
01:03:57,479 --> 01:03:59,999
For getting you involved
in all this stuff.

945
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,078
For getting you involved
in all this stuff.

946
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:02,478
I wasn't thinking
about you, my friend.

947
01:04:02,479 --> 01:04:03,759
I wasn't thinking about anybody.

948
01:04:06,412 --> 01:04:10,377
Except myself.

949
01:04:10,378 --> 01:04:13,577
What I wanted.

950
01:04:13,578 --> 01:04:17,410
I know where that dude is.

951
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:19,510
What dude?

952
01:04:19,511 --> 01:04:21,077
The dude with the
bat on his neck.

953
01:04:26,178 --> 01:04:26,844
Marcus.

954
01:05:03,444 --> 01:05:05,309
I'm looking for a
white man names Marcus.

955
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,009
What's the last
thing you recall?

956
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,475
You must have a death wish, boy.

957
01:05:08,476 --> 01:05:10,009
As long as you're
my little girl,

958
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:12,308
I can lift the whole wide world.

959
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:15,074
This man is currently
under federal protection.

960
01:05:15,075 --> 01:05:17,341
Savak's got to be
tied into this somehow.

961
01:05:17,342 --> 01:05:20,608
Pallet 21's a shipment of
mpa-3 high-velocity rifles.

962
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:22,074
I'm looking for somebody.

963
01:05:22,075 --> 01:05:24,008
He's got a tattoo of
a bat on his neck.

964
01:05:24,009 --> 01:05:25,608
Well, what you gonna
do when you find him?

965
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:27,341
What does a teardrop signify?

966
01:05:27,342 --> 01:05:29,741
You get another one added
every time you kill somebody.

967
01:05:29,742 --> 01:05:30,000
Daddy!

968
01:05:30,001 --> 01:05:30,741
Daddy!

969
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:32,308
John, no!

970
01:05:32,309 --> 01:05:34,342
Daddy.

971
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:48,675
This must be your boy.

972
01:05:52,341 --> 01:05:54,040
All right.

973
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:54,881
He's in the building.

974
01:06:16,707 --> 01:06:17,674
Places.

975
01:06:29,973 --> 01:06:30,000
I don't believe it.

976
01:06:30,001 --> 01:06:32,274
I don't believe it.

977
01:06:47,673 --> 01:06:50,338
I'm gonna count to three.

978
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:55,105
Anyone who wants to can leave.

979
01:06:55,106 --> 01:06:59,999
Anyone who doesn't
is gonna get hurt.

980
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,106
Anyone who doesn't
is gonna get hurt.

981
01:07:00,107 --> 01:07:04,337
What the--who is this fuck?

982
01:07:04,338 --> 01:07:07,304
Where's the guns?

983
01:07:07,305 --> 01:07:10,471
One.

984
01:07:10,472 --> 01:07:11,905
It was you.

985
01:07:11,906 --> 01:07:14,204
You ripped off that
redheaded prick.

986
01:07:14,205 --> 01:07:16,005
Two.

987
01:07:25,105 --> 01:07:27,371
What?

988
01:07:27,372 --> 01:07:28,338
You want him?

989
01:07:35,438 --> 01:07:38,471
You want to kill him?

990
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:56,903
Let's give them some space.

991
01:07:56,904 --> 01:07:57,970
Say what?

992
01:08:08,437 --> 01:08:10,303
You don't even remember, do you?

993
01:08:17,403 --> 01:08:19,003
You killed my wife.

994
01:08:23,536 --> 01:08:26,903
You murdered my child.

995
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:41,102
Say hi to your
wife and kids for me!

996
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:48,101
I'm warning you, motherfucker,

997
01:08:48,102 --> 01:08:49,469
those are cops out there!

998
01:08:59,135 --> 01:08:59,999
Psst.

999
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,901
Psst.

1000
01:09:01,902 --> 01:09:03,035
Fire escape.

1001
01:09:04,268 --> 01:09:05,467
Fire escape.

1002
01:09:05,468 --> 01:09:06,435
Fuck you.

1003
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:38,266
No.

1004
01:09:38,267 --> 01:09:39,266
Come on.

1005
01:09:39,267 --> 01:09:41,232
Don't. Don't.

1006
01:09:41,233 --> 01:09:43,266
No.

1007
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:44,266
Come on.

1008
01:09:44,267 --> 01:09:45,100
Don't.

1009
01:10:00,133 --> 01:10:01,165
Don't.

1010
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:03,332
Mikey, get out of here, now.

1011
01:10:06,699 --> 01:10:08,198
Mikey, I said get out of here.

1012
01:10:08,199 --> 01:10:09,166
Go.

1013
01:10:23,266 --> 01:10:25,232
Well, what you gonna
do when you find him?

1014
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:47,364
Jesus, north.

1015
01:10:47,365 --> 01:10:50,230
That's pathetic.

1016
01:10:50,231 --> 01:10:53,097
Now I got to shoot him
myself at some point.

1017
01:10:53,098 --> 01:10:54,697
What a pain in the ass.

1018
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:03,898
Oh, yeah.

1019
01:11:05,164 --> 01:11:07,363
Oh, yeah.

1020
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:11,663
This is one stone I'm gonna
use to kill a lot of birds.

1021
01:11:12,897 --> 01:11:16,029
Hey, kid, thanks for the help.

1022
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:20,196
I'll see you get put up
for a citizenship award.

1023
01:11:20,197 --> 01:11:22,695
And now, sergeant,

1024
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:26,196
it's time for your
pavlovian response class.

1025
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:40,395
What are you doing?

1026
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:41,961
I'm wasting him.

1027
01:11:41,962 --> 01:11:43,694
Wasting him?

1028
01:11:43,695 --> 01:11:46,162
What are you,
trigger-happy nuts?

1029
01:11:46,163 --> 01:11:50,228
What has he done
to deserve that?

1030
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:53,195
What the hell you talking about?

1031
01:11:53,196 --> 01:11:55,961
You're a menace, you know that?

1032
01:11:55,962 --> 01:11:58,261
Yes, you.

1033
01:11:58,262 --> 01:11:59,999
It's people like you scare me.

1034
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,200
It's people like you scare me.

1035
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:05,161
So what the fuck
we gonna do with him?

1036
01:12:05,162 --> 01:12:07,095
Just put him in the car.

1037
01:12:26,194 --> 01:12:28,093
Well, I've had
some complications,

1038
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,827
but I'll have Mr. Kane's shit.

1039
01:12:29,828 --> 01:12:30,000
I will have it back.

1040
01:12:30,001 --> 01:12:30,960
I will have it back.

1041
01:12:32,628 --> 01:12:33,593
Stop it.

1042
01:12:33,594 --> 01:12:34,793
Please, man.

1043
01:12:34,794 --> 01:12:36,226
My man's gonna have
it back tomorrow.

1044
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:37,260
Just another 24 hours.

1045
01:12:37,261 --> 01:12:38,692
I swear to god, man.

1046
01:12:38,693 --> 01:12:40,293
If I don't have it by then,
you can waste me.

1047
01:12:40,294 --> 01:12:45,093
Stop it, please, man.

1048
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:47,060
Tomorrow come mighty
fast, motherfucker.

1049
01:13:14,226 --> 01:13:16,193
See some identification.

1050
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,992
Luther Kane.

1051
01:13:22,993 --> 01:13:26,158
Any relation to Dexter Kane?

1052
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,491
Yeah, he's my brother.

1053
01:13:27,492 --> 01:13:29,525
But I'm not in that
business, officer.

1054
01:13:29,526 --> 01:13:30,000
I'm an accountant.

1055
01:13:30,001 --> 01:13:31,057
I'm an accountant.

1056
01:13:31,058 --> 01:13:33,258
I'm aware of that, sir.

1057
01:13:33,259 --> 01:13:35,724
Then why did you pull me over?

1058
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:37,525
Well, you see, here's the thing.

1059
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:41,258
It's illegal to drive dead, sir.

1060
01:13:41,259 --> 01:13:42,591
What the fuck?

1061
01:13:57,658 --> 01:13:59,891
Dexter Kane got Marcus.

1062
01:14:03,558 --> 01:14:07,524
Well, I'm sorry, Mikey.

1063
01:14:07,525 --> 01:14:09,556
It's my fault.

1064
01:14:09,557 --> 01:14:13,990
But I'm gonna take that base
back and give it to Dexter Kane.

1065
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,957
You came here to ask
for my help, didn't you?

1066
01:14:18,124 --> 01:14:22,756
They shot my wife.

1067
01:14:22,757 --> 01:14:24,123
He murdered my little girl.

1068
01:14:27,757 --> 01:14:29,999
Yeah.

1069
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,190
Yeah.

1070
01:14:30,191 --> 01:14:31,922
Well, they're
gonna kill me next.

1071
01:14:31,923 --> 01:14:36,089
I won't last the week if I
don't deliver the drugs to Kane.

1072
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:38,522
But now I can see why
you can't help me.

1073
01:14:38,523 --> 01:14:40,090
So just forget it, man.

1074
01:14:43,023 --> 01:14:44,056
Mikey, wait a minute.

1075
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,623
Come here.

1076
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:54,755
They can't hold me here
longer than 24 hours.

1077
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,156
If you wait for me,

1078
01:15:00,055 --> 01:15:02,489
I'll help you.

1079
01:15:05,755 --> 01:15:08,889
1:00, pacific and Washington.

1080
01:15:11,156 --> 01:15:12,922
Okay.

1081
01:15:47,487 --> 01:15:51,753
His brother killed
last night, cops.

1082
01:15:51,754 --> 01:15:54,020
I am truly sorry.

1083
01:15:57,554 --> 01:15:58,920
He's not in the best of moods.

1084
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:07,486
Dexter's rifles
with my condolences.

1085
01:16:12,586 --> 01:16:15,586
Ammunition with my compliments.

1086
01:16:22,019 --> 01:16:25,918
I do believe you
owe me some money.

1087
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:28,885
Now ain't the time, cuz.

1088
01:16:28,886 --> 01:16:29,999
Hey, I'm human.

1089
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,518
Hey, I'm human.

1090
01:16:33,519 --> 01:16:35,684
And I do sympathize.

1091
01:16:35,685 --> 01:16:38,918
But when it comes to
money, I do not relax,

1092
01:16:38,919 --> 01:16:42,018
and I do not let it go.

1093
01:16:42,019 --> 01:16:43,719
50 g's.

1094
01:17:21,451 --> 01:17:23,750
I guess you want
your 50 g's, right?

1095
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:36,616
I hear today's the last
day in the world series.

1096
01:17:36,617 --> 01:17:39,850
You still pitching for the feds
at the big game this afternoon?

1097
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:45,682
I didn't know you
followed baseball.

1098
01:17:45,683 --> 01:17:46,617
I don't.

1099
01:17:56,616 --> 01:17:57,916
Savak.

1100
01:18:01,216 --> 01:18:02,716
Savak.

1101
01:18:28,282 --> 01:18:29,999
They bought it.

1102
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,249
They bought it.

1103
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:32,614
Let's go play some ball.

1104
01:18:32,615 --> 01:18:34,882
This better fucking work.

1105
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:42,480
How do you know Dexter's
gonna take the bait?

1106
01:18:42,481 --> 01:18:46,280
Dexter thinks the police
killed his brother last night.

1107
01:18:46,281 --> 01:18:48,748
He'll take it.

1108
01:18:58,447 --> 01:18:59,846
Let's go, baby.

1109
01:18:59,847 --> 01:19:00,000
Uncle Sam wants you.

1110
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,312
Uncle Sam wants you.

1111
01:19:02,313 --> 01:19:03,880
Huh?

1112
01:19:03,881 --> 01:19:05,312
Wait a minute.

1113
01:19:05,313 --> 01:19:06,613
I was supposed to
be released today.

1114
01:19:06,614 --> 01:19:08,479
Your short-term
memory sucks, sergeant.

1115
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,346
We found heavyweight illegal
arms in your trunk yesterday.

1116
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:13,212
You broke the law.

1117
01:19:13,213 --> 01:19:16,146
The d.A. Thinks that with
fingerprint evidence

1118
01:19:16,147 --> 01:19:19,279
and our impeccable testimony

1119
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,745
that they can
make a case not only for

1120
01:19:20,746 --> 01:19:24,446
possession but for the
intent to distribute.

1121
01:19:24,447 --> 01:19:26,212
Isn't that great?

1122
01:19:26,213 --> 01:19:28,112
You don't understand something.

1123
01:19:28,113 --> 01:19:29,999
I got somebody waiting for me.

1124
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,180
I got somebody waiting for me.

1125
01:19:30,181 --> 01:19:31,712
That's okay.

1126
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:35,412
As long as they don't
mind waiting 20 years.

1127
01:19:35,413 --> 01:19:37,245
15 with time off
for good behavior.

1128
01:19:37,246 --> 01:19:37,846
Come on.

1129
01:20:13,712 --> 01:20:16,277
Told you tomorrow
came mighty quick.

1130
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:17,677
Not so hot to see Mr.
Kane now, are you,

1131
01:20:17,678 --> 01:20:19,177
you motherfucker?

1132
01:20:19,178 --> 01:20:21,244
Look, my man's gonna
show up with the shit.

1133
01:20:21,245 --> 01:20:23,310
He's just running a little late.

1134
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:24,244
He's gonna get here, man.

1135
01:20:24,245 --> 01:20:25,377
Come on.

1136
01:20:25,378 --> 01:20:27,344
Look, you said 2:30.

1137
01:20:27,345 --> 01:20:28,710
If your man ain't
show up by then,

1138
01:20:28,711 --> 01:20:29,999
you can tell it to god
through a plastic bag.

1139
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,476
You can tell it to god
through a plastic bag.

1140
01:20:31,477 --> 01:20:32,643
Let's go.

1141
01:20:32,644 --> 01:20:36,376
Oh, man, I feel a
real need to relieve.

1142
01:20:36,377 --> 01:20:38,811
Come on, there's a
bathroom right there.

1143
01:20:58,309 --> 01:20:59,999
What?

1144
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:00,177
What?

1145
01:21:00,178 --> 01:21:02,308
I got no hands here.

1146
01:21:02,309 --> 01:21:05,142
What, are you nuts?

1147
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:07,142
Come on, man, there
ain't no one around.

1148
01:21:07,143 --> 01:21:09,242
No, no.

1149
01:21:09,243 --> 01:21:11,108
No way.

1150
01:21:11,109 --> 01:21:12,409
Come on, you don't
got to hold it.

1151
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:15,008
You just got to pull it out.

1152
01:21:15,009 --> 01:21:17,175
Use your tie if you
don't want to touch it.

1153
01:21:17,176 --> 01:21:18,276
I trust you.

1154
01:21:29,409 --> 01:21:29,999
Sometimes it snakes
down the right side,

1155
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,374
sometimes it snakes
down the right side,

1156
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:33,775
so just follow it to
the end, roll it out.

1157
01:21:33,776 --> 01:21:35,341
Man, fuck this shit.

1158
01:21:35,342 --> 01:21:38,008
Yeah, on second thought,
it is a two-hand job.

1159
01:21:41,409 --> 01:21:43,509
That was not a bluff, my man.

1160
01:21:49,641 --> 01:21:50,674
What's up?

1161
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:41,205
How you doing, officer?

1162
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,038
Hey.

1163
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:44,005
Whoa!

1164
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:45,005
What are you doing?

1165
01:22:45,006 --> 01:22:46,339
Get back here!

1166
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:48,205
Get that guy!

1167
01:22:48,206 --> 01:22:49,240
God damn it!

1168
01:23:32,638 --> 01:23:35,004
I'm sorry about your
brother, Mr. Kane.

1169
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:04,869
Cops killed Dexter's brother.

1170
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:06,437
Let's kill some cops.

1171
01:24:13,603 --> 01:24:16,103
All right, play ball!

1172
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:38,766
Drop your weapons.
You're under arrest.

1173
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:39,832
What the--

1174
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:41,400
Blanks.

1175
01:25:41,401 --> 01:25:42,400
Move, you die.

1176
01:26:14,099 --> 01:26:15,364
Come on, man.

1177
01:26:15,365 --> 01:26:18,698
Mr. Kane--you can't--you
can't kill me for a lousy

1178
01:26:18,699 --> 01:26:19,699
key of base, man.

1179
01:26:20,866 --> 01:26:22,131
Break something.

1180
01:26:22,132 --> 01:26:23,465
I could understand that.

1181
01:26:26,965 --> 01:26:27,965
Answer it.

1182
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:18,897
Saved by the bell.

1183
01:27:26,096 --> 01:27:27,663
Maybe.

1184
01:27:48,662 --> 01:27:49,629
Damn.

1185
01:27:53,995 --> 01:27:55,028
34.

1186
01:27:58,962 --> 01:27:59,999
34.

1187
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,660
34.

1188
01:28:00,661 --> 01:28:01,660
Roger, 34.

1189
01:28:01,661 --> 01:28:03,361
Go ahead.

1190
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:05,095
Yeah, I need an
address on a Dexter Kane.

1191
01:28:12,862 --> 01:28:16,361
Why would you care whether
this buster lives or dies?

1192
01:28:23,695 --> 01:28:25,060
Rat poison.

1193
01:28:25,061 --> 01:28:27,628
Oh, my god, Mr. Kane, you
got to believe I would never--

1194
01:28:33,294 --> 01:28:34,960
Changed my mind.

1195
01:28:34,961 --> 01:28:36,760
You're dead, motherfucker.

1196
01:28:36,761 --> 01:28:40,627
Not until the fat
lady sings, pony.

1197
01:28:53,026 --> 01:28:55,593
And I'm the fat lady.

1198
01:28:55,594 --> 01:28:56,527
Drop it.

1199
01:29:14,626 --> 01:29:18,291
You're under arrest for the
purchase of illegal firearms

1200
01:29:18,292 --> 01:29:20,625
with intent of
first-degree murder

1201
01:29:20,626 --> 01:29:23,192
of law enforcement officers.

1202
01:29:28,725 --> 01:29:29,999
That was for resisting arrest.

1203
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,492
That was for resisting arrest.

1204
01:29:42,492 --> 01:29:46,758
You know what they say.

1205
01:29:46,759 --> 01:29:49,557
Dead ponies tell no tales.

1206
01:29:49,558 --> 01:29:50,890
Come on, man, savak.

1207
01:29:50,891 --> 01:29:54,190
Or is it

1208
01:29:54,191 --> 01:29:57,057
dead ponies have no tails?

1209
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:57,791
Anyway--

1210
01:30:05,591 --> 01:30:09,490
I'm not really
a kid killer, kid.

1211
01:30:09,491 --> 01:30:13,523
I used to have Marcus
do that sort of thing.

1212
01:30:13,524 --> 01:30:16,490
But unfortunately, he's just
not gonna be very reliable

1213
01:30:16,491 --> 01:30:19,789
from here on out, so don't
take this personally.

1214
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:23,957
It's funny how things
work out, isn't it, savak?

1215
01:30:26,656 --> 01:30:27,790
You're the one.

1216
01:30:33,023 --> 01:30:34,455
You're the one who's responsible

1217
01:30:34,456 --> 01:30:36,756
for my family's death.

1218
01:30:36,757 --> 01:30:39,856
Marcus was just the
gun in your hand.

1219
01:30:39,857 --> 01:30:46,522
Well, soldier, that's a whole
another philosophical debate,

1220
01:30:46,523 --> 01:30:49,455
because you see,
what we have here is

1221
01:30:49,456 --> 01:30:52,021
a Mexican standoff.

1222
01:30:52,022 --> 01:30:53,589
You shoot me.

1223
01:30:58,489 --> 01:30:59,889
I shoot the kid.

1224
01:31:02,589 --> 01:31:05,988
I don't think so, because
once I separate your head

1225
01:31:05,989 --> 01:31:10,488
from your body, you won't be
shooting anybody else again,

1226
01:31:10,489 --> 01:31:11,455
savak.

1227
01:31:16,021 --> 01:31:16,855
Yeah?

1228
01:31:24,588 --> 01:31:25,521
Do it.

1229
01:31:27,788 --> 01:31:28,988
Go ahead.

1230
01:31:40,688 --> 01:31:42,721
Smart soldier.

1231
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:48,453
You see, even Smith and
Wesson doesn't have that

1232
01:31:48,454 --> 01:31:49,454
kind of guarantee.

1233
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:04,852
Touchdown, motherfucker.

1234
01:33:18,917 --> 01:33:21,516
I can smell revenge, John.

1235
01:33:21,517 --> 01:33:24,317
It is John, isn't it?

1236
01:33:24,318 --> 01:33:26,583
You like counting, don't you?

1237
01:33:26,584 --> 01:33:27,816
Yeah.

1238
01:33:27,817 --> 01:33:29,450
Well, now I'm counting, John.

1239
01:33:31,584 --> 01:33:34,750
I'm gonna give you three.

1240
01:33:34,751 --> 01:33:38,816
And if I don't see you,

1241
01:33:38,817 --> 01:33:41,282
I'm gonna blow this kid's
head clean off,

1242
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:43,549
and you know I'll do it.

1243
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:45,517
So come on out
and join me, John.

1244
01:33:47,384 --> 01:33:48,484
One.

1245
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,716
Two!

1246
01:33:54,316 --> 01:33:54,983
Don't push me.

1247
01:33:57,816 --> 01:33:59,716
Two and a half!

1248
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,883
It's on your head, north!

1249
01:34:04,549 --> 01:34:05,750
Three!

1250
01:34:08,818 --> 01:34:10,138
Mikey, come here.

1251
01:34:10,139 --> 01:34:11,606
Give me your hand.

1252
01:34:11,607 --> 01:34:14,242
Now I want you to
get out of here.

1253
01:34:14,243 --> 01:34:15,610
Why aren't you coming, man?

1254
01:34:15,611 --> 01:34:17,113
I said get out of here.

1255
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:26,922
You just couldn't switch
off the life support again,

1256
01:34:26,923 --> 01:34:27,557
could you?

1257
01:34:33,162 --> 01:34:34,130
Could you?

1258
01:34:36,265 --> 01:34:37,400
Son of a bitch!

1259
01:36:40,923 --> 01:36:42,390
Point game.

1260
01:36:42,391 --> 01:36:45,026
When I get 6'6", you ain't
even gonna see no point game.

1261
01:36:45,027 --> 01:36:45,994
All right?

1262
01:36:45,995 --> 01:36:46,995
Give me the ball.

1263
01:36:46,996 --> 01:36:48,396
Let's check.

1264
01:36:48,397 --> 01:36:51,666
All right, I'll
be around for that.

1265
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:54,102
You missing me again?

1266
01:36:54,103 --> 01:36:56,204
Or do I even need to be 6'6"?

1267
01:36:56,205 --> 01:36:57,272
Come on, man.

1268
01:36:57,273 --> 01:36:59,341
Come on. Come on.

1269
01:36:59,342 --> 01:36:59,999
I'm gonna teach you everything.

1270
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,009
I'm gonna teach you everything.

1271
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:03,011
Oh!

1272
01:37:03,012 --> 01:37:04,346
But is it gonna go in?

1273
01:37:04,347 --> 01:37:05,380
Oh, it's good. It's good.

1274
01:37:05,381 --> 01:37:06,648
All right.

1275
01:37:06,649 --> 01:37:08,617
Well, losers out,
'cause it's my ball.

1276
01:37:08,618 --> 01:37:10,285
You got that? You got that?

1277
01:37:10,286 --> 01:37:11,253
Come on.

1278
01:37:11,254 --> 01:37:12,554
Right here.

1279
01:37:12,555 --> 01:37:14,422
There's a lot more games
to be played, brother.

1280
01:37:14,423 --> 01:37:17,126
Lot more games to be played.
