1
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,765
What the hell?

2
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,070
The stagecoach is coming!

3
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,739
The stagecoach is coming!

4
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:08,327
No need to stop.

5
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,166
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!

6
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,422
Hands up!

7
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,427
Howdy.

8
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,372
This is the third time
this month.

9
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,375
You really should give
the depositors a chance...

10
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,410
To build up
their accounts.

11
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,613
Huh?

12
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,720
Good luck.
Hey. I've got a job.

13
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:12,591
What'll it be?

14
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,894
I would really
love a gin and tonic--

15
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,262
slice of lime,
cracked ice.

16
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,969
Whiskey.

17
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,137
Okay, belle.
Okay. All right.

18
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,139
Get out! Get out!

19
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,174
Lemme give you an I.O.U.

20
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,711
I am done working
for I.O.U.S,

21
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,880
and I'm done
working for rocks!

22
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,783
Here...
Here's a refund.

23
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,686
Ohhh...

24
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,424
Zeke.

25
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,975
Why,
Harry Bob Ferguson!

26
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:07,846
Ahh!
What a terrific
surprise.

27
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,848
I must confess,

28
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,350
I've never
considered you to be...

29
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,352
The reader type-- per se.

30
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,621
I need
a big damn book.

31
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,424
A big damn book. Super.
We certainly have a few.

32
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:24,729
But if I might, have you
been more in the market...

33
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,632
For a coffee table,
impress-your-guests thing,

34
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:32,370
or are you leaning towards
a flip-right-through-it-
before-bed number?

35
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,572
Like a chocolate?

36
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,508
Oh. Not another word.

37
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:42,380
I'd like to recommend
one of my very favorite
authors to you--

38
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,615
woman named Jane Austen.

39
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:48,703
This is a writer
of just wonderfully
exquisite prose.

40
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:52,290
And as you see,
it's a big damn book.

41
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,293
Ha ha ha!
Oh,pride and prejudice.

42
00:04:55,362 --> 00:05:00,131
You're going to get more
than a run for your money.

43
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,133
How much?

44
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:06,204
Well, I think $2.00
is a fair price.

45
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:08,740
Really?
Mm-hmm.

46
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,910
How much for
just the pride?

47
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,114
Well, actually,
one does hate
to break up the set.

48
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,752
All right.
I got to test it first.

49
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,255
I beg your pardon?
Aah!

50
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,290
Where is
your outhouse?

51
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,292
It's in back.

52
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,300
What'll it be?

53
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:38,303
Oh, I don't know.
I'm a mess.

54
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,805
What did you
have in mind?

55
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,314
Whiskey.
What a surprise.

56
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,289
This here's
the Ferguson place.

57
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:04,162
Let me help you
down here, ma'am.

58
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:06,264
Watch your step.

59
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,304
Aah!

60
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,573
Son of a bitch!

61
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,909
Arggh!

62
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,011
Are you sure about this?

63
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,013
Quite sure.

64
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:25,516
Well... good-bye.

65
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,253
And good luck.

66
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,623
Good-bye.

67
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,759
Hyah!

68
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:53,311
- Aaah!
- Ohh!

69
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,753
- Ooh!
- Two!

70
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,590
- Whoo!
- Excuse me!

71
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:11,229
Excuse me.
Hello.
Ooh.

72
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,465
- Hello.
- Huh?

73
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,634
Oooh!

74
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,636
Hello.

75
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:22,673
My name
is Lindsey thurlow.

76
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,842
Huh?

77
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,979
The mail-order bride.
Huh huh.

78
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,748
Which one of you
is the groom?

79
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,487
None of US could afford
a bride on his own,

80
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,656
so we all just sort of...
Pitched in.

81
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,726
This is completely
unacceptable.

82
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,030
My contract was signed
by a, uh...

83
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,198
Mr. Clayton Ferguson.

84
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,402
He's in the barn.

85
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:56,074
Thank god.
Ohh! Thank god!

86
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:59,010
Millie, come back,
darlin'!

87
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,746
I was only jokin'!

88
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,783
Women!

89
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,654
They're always
arguing.

90
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,824
Huh huh huh...

91
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,893
Right.

92
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,997
What'll it be--
whiskey.

93
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,341
Hey, Ferguson.
Is it raining?

94
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,312
I thought
we was in drought.

95
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:38,550
Oh.

96
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,918
Oh, god.

97
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,857
You got a problem,
there, mister?

98
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:49,494
Uh, yeah.
These are my cows.

99
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,066
You see?
They say "Phil's cow,"

100
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,103
and, uh, hey, I'm Phil.

101
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:01,606
They were stolen from me
about two nights ago.

102
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,842
Ahh!
You must be mistaken.

103
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:10,848
I bought these cows
last year in...
Dodge.

104
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,085
Of course, you got
a problem with that,

105
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,087
we can settle it
right here.

106
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:20,592
That's life, huh?
I don't much like
being called a...

107
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,195
Cattle rustler.
I don't blame you.

108
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:30,401
Take 10 paces.
Say, I'd love to,
but I can't,

109
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,404
because you know what?
I'm antihandgun.

110
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:36,574
So, uh...
Let's see.

111
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,513
What do you say
we flip for them?

112
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,283
I said take 10 paces,
turn, and start shootin'.

113
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,120
Those are cows!

114
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,323
What am I, crazy?
What have I been thinkin'?

115
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,392
I'm a sheep rancher!

116
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,661
Ha ha ha!

117
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,663
Start walkin'!

118
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:02,683
1... 2...

119
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:06,304
3... 4...

120
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,373
What comes after 4?

121
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,976
4 1/2.

122
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,112
4 1/2... 5...

123
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,250
8, 9--

124
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,423
where the hell
did he go?

125
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:32,664
I can't face
another wounded teller
with a workman's comp claim!

126
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,667
He took the book
to the outhouse...

127
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,169
And used it
as toilet paper!

128
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,772
No more ious,
no more rocks!

129
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,241
What were
we thinking?

130
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,943
Why did we come out here?

131
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,681
Why don't we go back?
What?
What?

132
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,551
Yeah, back east.
Back home.
Back. Come on.

133
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,254
- You're talkin' crazy.
- Am I?

134
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,090
We can't go east.
Why not?

135
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,226
Because.
because it's
against the code.

136
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,730
Exactly.
It's against the code.
What code?

137
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,233
You know what code.
The code of the west.

138
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,770
Oh, the code of the west.

139
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,105
The same code
that says, uh...

140
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,207
"The only good Indian
is a dead Indian."

141
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,576
And "die with your boots on."

142
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:22,881
Wait. I got another one--
"if someone steals
your horse, you hang 'em."

143
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,949
That's some code.

144
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,051
Quite a code.
Let's stay.

145
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,053
Admittedly not
an enlightened ideology.

146
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:32,056
But leaving would be
like giving up.

147
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,926
That's exactly what
it would be, Ben.

148
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,994
So let's just give up.

149
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,931
Let's get a wagon master
and go home.

150
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,834
Let's go east.
What do you say?

151
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,970
I say you're gutless,
yellow-bellied,
eastern sissies!

152
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,441
All you done
since you got here
is whine and complain!

153
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:53,478
Go back and leave the west
to the real men!

154
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:57,482
I could have the books
on the wagon really quickly,

155
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,852
and the cappuccino machine
travels like a dream.

156
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:04,088
Henrietta misses
her family back east.

157
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:07,725
I could take care
of my girls,
settle my ious--

158
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:10,227
wait!

159
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,296
We need a sign.

160
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,899
Sign?
From the lord.

161
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,469
Actually, a sign
would be terrific.

162
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,504
Oh! Oh, that's right.

163
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:30,982
Hey, Zeke, come on.
Really, there's your sign.

164
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,486
When was the last time
it rained here, huh?

165
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:37,689
That's not a sign.
It's just rain.

166
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:51,102
Zeke,
that is a major sign.

167
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,471
It's just the wind, Phil.

168
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,507
Tough room, Phil.

169
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,086
Ooh!

170
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,890
Oh, dear.

171
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,793
- That...
- That's a sign.

172
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,864
What?

173
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:25,803
- Ohh!
- Who's he?

174
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:30,241
Who in the--
stranger?
Smells like whiskey.

175
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,511
Well, he's certainly come
to the right place.

176
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,513
I don't recognize him.

177
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,516
Easy, slick!
You ain't a customer yet!

178
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:42,319
Hands off!
"James h. Harlow."

179
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,957
"Wagon master."

180
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,203
Sure you're not hungry?

181
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:04,042
I don't eat meat...
When I'm drinkin'.

182
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,044
Ha ha ha!

183
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,047
Look, I know he looks
a little unsteady,

184
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,784
but there's
something about him--
something in his eyes.

185
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,287
Those are blood vessels.
The man's a drunk.

186
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,791
It could be pinkeye.
There's a lot going around.

187
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:24,295
Listen, could you go
through that route again
for US, huh?

188
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,297
Follow me.

189
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,073
Gentlemen...

190
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,175
This is the southwest
territories.

191
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,411
We're going to start here.

192
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,513
Here's chimney rock.

193
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,817
Over here's
devil's gate.

194
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,921
No, no, no.
This is--

195
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,991
aah! Aah!

196
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,994
Platte river.
Now I know
where I am.

197
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,830
Can't you just
use a map?

198
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,298
I don't use maps,
Earl.

199
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,367
Ben!

200
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,706
Ben.
Got it all up here...

201
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,010
Where it counts!
Mmm.

202
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,747
That's what
I'm afraid of.
Can we go, Phil?

203
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:18,750
Hold on. Let me
get this straight.

204
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,252
This Dutch oven's
our first campsite.

205
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,255
Right. Right next to
the Pawnee nation.

206
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:28,993
No, that can't be
the Pawnee nation.
They're not that unified.

207
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:32,496
Pawnee'd be more like
this here muffin tin.

208
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,498
We cannot
entrust the lives...

209
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:37,501
Of our families
and friends to this...

210
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,537
Drunken lunatic!

211
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,040
With all due respect.

212
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,910
Respect... taken.

213
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,614
Oh, mister...

214
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,553
I don't blame you
for doubtin' my abilities.

215
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,056
You'd be a fool
not to.

216
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,059
Been a drunk for
the last 20 years.

217
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,830
But I know this land!

218
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,700
I just need a chance.

219
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,702
It ain't about
the money,

220
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,704
I'll leave that
to you.

221
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:14,706
But you folks...

222
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:16,908
You need
a wagon master,

223
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,976
and, well...

224
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,089
I'd like it
to be me.

225
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:35,459
- Well, I guess you're
our man, Harlow.
- What?

226
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,196
Thank you, Jerry.

227
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:40,965
Well, actually, it's...
It's, uh, Phil.

228
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,334
You won't be sorry.

229
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,175
Oh, my!

230
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:54,612
Ladies.

231
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,723
We leave at dawn.

232
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,929
Noonish.

233
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,505
Hey, there--
there he is!

234
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:28,212
- Hey, that looks like
a wagon master to me.
- Whoa!

235
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:39,791
- People ready, Mr. Taylor?
- Yes, sir!

236
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,226
All right.
Mount your wagons!

237
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:45,897
Wagons, ho!

238
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,999
Go on! Go on!

239
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,211
Wagon master.
Yoo-hoo!

240
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,315
Yoo-hoo!

241
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,465
When I say "wagons, ho,"

242
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:25,903
that's the signal
that y'all pull out
and follow me.

243
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,905
You're going
the wrong way.

244
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:31,709
Ben, we never told him
where we were going.

245
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,911
Is this some
guessing game?

246
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,482
No, no, no, no.
We're, uh...
Going, uh, east.

247
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,322
- East?
- Do you have a problem
with that?

248
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,559
I don't know.
Don't seem right.
I've always gone west.

249
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,864
Well, we're going east.
Do you want the job
or not?

250
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,534
Wagons...

251
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,770
East!

252
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,577
Come on!

253
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,901
Bye, Julian!

254
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:52,523
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
If I could have your attention
for a moment, please.

255
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,293
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Now, as you know,

256
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,795
the success of our
transcontinental railroad...

257
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,731
Depends upon the success
of the land rush...

258
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,200
Scheduled
for the 4th of July.

259
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,669
President Grant
has made it clear,

260
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:09,140
if the population isn't
built up in the west,

261
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,110
we don't get any more money
to subsidize our railroad.

262
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,546
Tom, let's hear your report.

263
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,182
People are camped
on top of each other.

264
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,284
To use their terms,

265
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,454
"they're chompin' at the bit
and rarin' to git..."

266
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,556
Ha ha!

267
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:29,560
As soon as they receive
the go-ahead July 4th.

268
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,063
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Mmm!

269
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,065
Before we count
our chickens,

270
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:38,336
listen to this telegram
from a couple agents
out west.

271
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,340
"Have learned
of a wagon train
planning to head east.

272
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,342
"Repeat-- east.

273
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,378
"Five wagons in all.
Possible trend?

274
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,380
Stop--
please advise."

275
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:53,184
Now, gentlemen,
I submit to you,
there goes the west.

276
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,186
Ha ha ha!

277
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,189
I just hope
it's not too late...

278
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,292
To give
Washington back
the $100 million.

279
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,730
Quiet!

280
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,833
Let me see that.

281
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,739
Will you take
that off, already?

282
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,709
I can't believe
my own father's a quitter.

283
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,980
Stop saying that.
Just because a man
decides to quit...

284
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,015
Doesn't make him a--
you know.

285
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:28,018
Well, I guess
it does, doesn't it?

286
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,520
All right, then,
I'm a quitter.

287
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,023
But there's no
shame in quitting.

288
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,525
This country was
founded by quitters--

289
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,528
English quitters,
French quitters,
German quitters.

290
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,531
For your information,
if not for quitters,

291
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,868
no one would
start anything.

292
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,038
And buckle up.

293
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:51,242
Howdy, Phil.
How you doin', Zeke?

294
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,046
- What's that wagon master
fella's name again?
- You mean Harlow.

295
00:21:56,115 --> 00:22:00,417
Yep. Been gnawin' at me
since I set eyes on him.

296
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,753
You don't forget
somebody like that.

297
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,356
Why?
What did he do?

298
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,192
That's the only part
I can't remember.

299
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:11,262
- Something really good...
- Yeah?

300
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,697
- Or really bad.
- Oh.

301
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,699
You must remember
something.

302
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:19,736
It'll come to me.
You can be sure of it.

303
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,807
Maybe not.

304
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:32,549
Howdy, ma'am.
I didn't properly
introduce myself.

305
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:34,551
The name's Harlow.

306
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,987
I'll be
your wagon master.

307
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,689
I'd say
the jury's still out.

308
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:42,359
Pretty quick
to judge a man, aren't you?

309
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:47,497
In my line of work,
it takes no time at all.

310
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:51,268
I'd like to prove you
wrong one day, ma'am.

311
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:54,204
Oh!
my doll!

312
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:57,141
Excuse me, ma'am. Ho!

313
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,321
Yes!

314
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,893
Ohh!

315
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:20,097
- Ohh!
- Oh...

316
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,166
Ma'am.

317
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:28,038
Come on!
Yah!

318
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:42,052
Move it out!
Come on!

319
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:47,557
How many wagons
did we start with, Phil?

320
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,560
Five. Why?
Did we lose one?

321
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,562
Nope.
Gained a couple.

322
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,898
Shoot, we're turning
into a movement.

323
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,034
How do you like that?

324
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,536
I don't like
it one bit.

325
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,538
Fix this.

326
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,540
Not now,
you nincompoop.

327
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,542
Uh, j.P...

328
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,545
You know, they have
just picked up...

329
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,548
A few stragglers--
one or two wagons.

330
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,717
They're clearing out
the deadwood for US.

331
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,719
Deadwood. Yes.

332
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:20,157
I'd like to clear out
some deadwood from
around here.

333
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:24,895
You're dismissed, smedly.
Dismissed--
dismissed, sir?

334
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:29,333
Wait, sir.
I-I've been with
the company 20 years.

335
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:32,269
Not fired,
you sniveling idiot.

336
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,339
Dismissed!
Now, get out!
Oh, yes, of course.

337
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:38,308
- Wait a minute.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:42,812
Take a letter.
I'm just going to
use your pen.

339
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,416
No, you're not.
No, I'm not.

340
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,684
Go ahead.
I'll remember.

341
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:51,688
Address it to
Mr. John Slade...
Mr. John Slade...

342
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:55,192
Somewhere on
the high plains.
John Slade... the high plains.

343
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,494
Dear Mr. Slade...
John Slade, high plains,
Mr. Slade.

344
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:02,566
Something of great
importance requires your
immediate attention.

345
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,768
...immediate attention.
Dear Mr. John...

346
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:29,359
Whoa, whoa!
Easy, Mr. Slade, easy.
Pony express.

347
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:32,296
I got a telegraph
for you.

348
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:48,078
If I could get you
to sign right here.

349
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:01,291
Unusual signature
you have there.

350
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,628
Two more stops,
and I'm done for the day.

351
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,663
Which way is abilene?

352
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,698
That way.

353
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:12,402
Okay. And, uh,
what about Denver?

354
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,904
Ooh!

355
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,907
Dead ahead.

356
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,615
It's been two hours,
for god's sake.

357
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:27,618
Ben, there's a fork
in the road.

358
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:30,120
This is a very
important decision.

359
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:33,123
The man's got to use
all his instincts,

360
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,626
get the lay
of the land,

361
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,628
the angle
of the sun,

362
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,663
the position
of the moon.

363
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:43,300
Which way are we--

364
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,877
Uhh!

365
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,880
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah.

366
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:00,384
So which way
do we go, huh?

367
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,387
That way.
You sure?

368
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,657
I know which way
we're going.

369
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:10,760
Wagons...

370
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:14,531
Ho!
Hyah!

371
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,901
Hyah!

372
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,041
Hyah!
Hyah!

373
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,450
That's enough,
already.

374
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,953
"I know which way
we're going."

375
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,757
It was his first mistake.
It was his first
decision.

376
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,528
Hope there aren't
any more forks
in the road.

377
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:48,031
Hope there ain't
no more forks
in the road.

378
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,201
That's the last time
I listen to you.

379
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,271
Told you
to wake me up.

380
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,589
Are you all right,
miss?

381
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,591
Oh. Yes, I'm fine.

382
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,928
No, you're not.
You're crying.

383
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,733
It's the fergusons.

384
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,002
They're driving me mad.

385
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:30,574
I've been
staving off their advances
since we left prosperity.

386
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,810
Well, you don't
have to stay with them.

387
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,012
You could ride with me.

388
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,315
Thank you.

389
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,317
I couldn't, though!

390
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,853
You don't
owe them anything.
Yes, I do.

391
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,356
My family accepted
money from them...

392
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,858
In exchange
for my hand.

393
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:51,661
Ha ha ha!

394
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,063
We've got a contract.

395
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,065
Well, that's
just not fair.

396
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,635
Oh, boy!
oh, my gosh!

397
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,471
Whoa!
Whoo whoo whoo!

398
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,708
What in the hell
are they doing
over there, anyway?

399
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:09,613
Oh! Well, they're
lighting their farts afire.

400
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:11,615
What else?

401
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,950
You got one, Harry?

402
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,853
Whooo!
ehh!

403
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,241
Ha ha!

404
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,988
Halt! Who goes there?

405
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,825
Just wanted
a cup of coffee.

406
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,861
I ain't never seen
you before.

407
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,667
I'm the new guy.

408
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:10,507
Oh. Sure!
The new guy!
Ha ha ha!

409
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,583
Ahh.

410
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,299
Vultures!

411
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,770
Someone's gonna die!

412
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,339
Honey!

413
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,546
Where the hell's
the river, Harlow?

414
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,949
- We're almost there.
- You've said that
two days ago.

415
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:29,085
It was
a day and a half.

416
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:32,389
My wife's
dying of thirst.
Oh, no. I'm fine.

417
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,291
Look there.

418
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,226
Two sisters.
What?

419
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:41,398
Two sisters.
Sweetwater's on the other side.

420
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:45,535
- Water!
- Yes!

421
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:48,104
Oh!

422
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,682
Yeeha!

423
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,151
Hyah!

424
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,960
Come on, everybody!
Come on!

425
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,467
Oh, no.
Sweetwater, huh?

426
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:21,471
What the heck
is this?

427
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,482
This ought to be good.
Yeah.

428
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,422
River must have
changed course.

429
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:42,325
I guess a lot of things
change in 20 years.

430
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,462
- We trusted you.
- I never trusted him.

431
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,833
- We should string him up.
- I get his boots!

432
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,835
Go find a tree,
junior.

433
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,170
I found the tree
last time.

434
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:58,441
- There ain't trees here.
- I say we Bury him alive.

435
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,879
Go find a shovel.
Give me that.

436
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:07,049
Do something.
Run, Harlow!

437
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,019
Come back here, now.

438
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,356
- Whoa!
- No!

439
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:17,360
Oh!

440
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,397
Water!
Look at that!

441
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,366
- Water!
- How deep is it?

442
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:26,903
Deep!
There's a sand bar
over here.

443
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,805
Yeeow!

444
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,975
Oh, dear.

445
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,951
Let's go!
Keep it moving!

446
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,620
Come on, now!

447
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:47,757
Wagons, ho!

448
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,760
Honey, please keep
two hands on the reins.

449
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,796
Stop telling me
how to drive!

450
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:02,038
- Move!
- Yeeah!

451
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,106
That's it, belle!

452
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,716
- Aah!
- Ha ha ha!

453
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,724
Come on! Come on!

454
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:26,563
Now, you shut up!
I ain't asked you
no questions.

455
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,030
Ow!

456
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:36,238
You stop!
Wait for me!

457
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,511
I'm gonna get you!

458
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,180
We're almost there.

459
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:49,051
I don't believe this!

460
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,062
What are you
looking at?

461
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,635
Come on, now!

462
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,806
You people are crazy.

463
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:12,441
Whoa!

464
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:17,146
Crazy? What do
you mean, crazy?

465
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,148
Because we risked our lives
crossing a river...

466
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,150
Instead of staying
on the other side?

467
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:24,654
Because we have faith
in ourselves?

468
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:28,625
Because we believe in
a wagon master...

469
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:32,896
Who gave US the confidence
to do things we never
thought we could?

470
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:37,233
No. Because most people
use the bridge.

471
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:46,709
"If river crossing
any indication,

472
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,579
"see little reason
to worry. Stop.

473
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,949
"Party seems certain
to self-destruct. Stop.

474
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:56,485
"Will proceed with plan,
however. Stop. Slade."

475
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,155
Little reason
to worry. Ha!

476
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,558
Ha!
It's not his money,
is it?

477
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,226
No, sir.
I want those
defectors eliminated.

478
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,229
If Mr. Bad-man Slade
can't do it,

479
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,833
- I'll find
someone who can!
- Yes, sir.

480
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,871
I'm going
down to Washington
to do some lobbying.

481
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,739
I want that
wagons east movement...

482
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:20,509
Monitored very closely
in my absence.
Yes, sir!

483
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,880
Well, how do I look?
Fat, sir.

484
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:28,184
Rich! Rich, sir!
Fat-- fat with money.

485
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:32,321
Jeremiah's on my side!
You kids
cut it out now!

486
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,324
Jeremiah started it.
"Jeremiah started it"!

487
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:38,061
Stop it!
Hey! Come on!

488
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:41,064
Why'd he have to
come along anyway?

489
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:44,467
- Because he's your brother.
- Are you sure?

490
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:48,337
I'll have your mother
turn this wagon around
right now!

491
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,474
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

492
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,978
I am warning you two.

493
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,380
Dad...
What is it, prudence?

494
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:02,051
I have to go
to the bathroom.

495
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,623
Why didn't you go
at dead horse bend?

496
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:09,358
I didn't
have to go then.

497
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:12,762
Can you hold it till
the devil's skillet?
No!

498
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,665
Whoa!

499
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,477
Turn around!

500
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,062
Wagons, ho!

501
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,465
Buckle up.

502
00:37:49,534 --> 00:37:52,135
Hyah!

503
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,040
Pa?

504
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:59,476
I think
I should have...

505
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:02,412
Gotten off
back there, too.

506
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,483
Mm-hmm.

507
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,688
Ha ha ha!

508
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:33,009
Hey, thanks.

509
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,513
You got a problem, kid?

510
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,015
No! No problem
at all.

511
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:53,530
Thanks.

512
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,538
The map can't be wrong.

513
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:04,541
This ain't the way
to St. Louis.

514
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,543
He knows the way, Ben.

515
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:11,514
The river wasn't where
you thought it would be.
Phil.

516
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:15,017
Well, Harlow, you don't
put much stock in maps,

517
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:19,021
but I think we should trust
the United States army.

518
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:22,024
Why?
maybe it's considered
more reliable...

519
00:39:22,094 --> 00:39:25,161
Than a stack of skillets
and muffin pans.

520
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,965
He got US across
the river, didn't he?

521
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,800
That's right.

522
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,803
The river-- let's talk
about that decision.

523
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:38,508
We should
have strung you up
back at the river.

524
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:41,511
Fine!
You people don't listen
to nothing anyway!

525
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,047
- You're just like the--
- who?

526
00:39:45,117 --> 00:39:47,950
Who, James?
never mind.

527
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,420
Yeah! Never mind!

528
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:54,157
Never mind yourself.
Never mind you.

529
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:56,959
Never mind you!
no! Never mind you!

530
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,995
I don't care!

531
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,464
Wait! Wait!
what?

532
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:04,467
Now I remember.
What?

533
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:07,470
Harlow. James Harlow.
We know his name.

534
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,972
He did something
really, really bad,

535
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,975
like one of those horrible
acts against nature...

536
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,478
That are just seared
into your brain.

537
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:19,282
What was it?
I wish I could
remember!

538
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:23,286
- Zeke!
- But I bet it's
eating away at him,

539
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:25,355
sapping his confidence,

540
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,990
clouding his judgment.

541
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:36,232
I thought it might
be a good idea...

542
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:40,736
If we took a break
from the pressures
of the trail,

543
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:45,341
if we shared
our feelings as men
with other men...

544
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:49,612
In the hopes that if
we got this old business
off our chests,

545
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,715
it might make
our journey easier.

546
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:56,052
Phil, what the hell
are you talking about?

547
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,055
Just share something
personal with the group.

548
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,791
You know,
some defining moment
from your past--

549
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,893
a joyous memory,

550
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,329
a broken dream.

551
00:41:06,398 --> 00:41:08,831
Who'd like to
go first? Harlow?

552
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,638
Why don't you
start first, Phil?
This is your meeting.

553
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,074
Yeah, it's
your meeting,
Phil.

554
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:21,077
I guess I could
start US off.

555
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:26,583
I bet a lot of you guys
don't know that back
in St. Louis,

556
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:30,353
I used to be a surgeon.

557
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:34,424
I used to work
in a field hospital
during the war.

558
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:40,396
It was a nightmare.
We'd work day and night.
We'd never sleep.

559
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:43,099
We would eat
while we operated.

560
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,337
Once, there was this young
soldier I was trying to save.

561
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:49,405
He took a cannonball
to the stomach.

562
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:52,575
Ha ha ha!

563
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:55,878
It was a mess.
You can imagine.

564
00:41:55,947 --> 00:42:00,483
After 18 hours
of surgery, I did it.

565
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:02,652
Of course you did!

566
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:04,721
I never felt
better in my life,

567
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:08,891
- until, just like that,
the patient dies.
- Oh, Phil.

568
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,027
I left a Bologna sandwich
in his lung.

569
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,230
Ha ha ha!

570
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,633
That's enough!

571
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,702
Well, put a shake
in my hand...

572
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:23,072
And made it impossible
to use a scalpel.

573
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:26,476
- I've got a better story.
- Go, Clayton!

574
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,078
Well, go right ahead,
Clayton.

575
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:32,081
I don't know
if any of you fellas...

576
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,418
Remember what
it was like to be 13.

577
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:39,188
You know-- the springtime
of your life...

578
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:42,692
When the grass is greener,
the skies are bluer.

579
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:45,895
You couldn't stop pulling
the wings off butterflies.

580
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:50,500
Just about every time
you got within
100 feet of a female,

581
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,737
put a little pup tent
in your britches.

582
00:42:54,806 --> 00:43:00,242
One day, I'm doing some
chores for old lady Connors.
That old hag.

583
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:05,247
There she is,
napping on her bed
with her teeth in a glass...

584
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:08,250
And her mouth
kind of slung open.

585
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,754
I figure, what the heck.
It's a free country.

586
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:16,526
- Clayton, you can finish
the story the next time.
- This is the best part.

587
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,029
Mary's husband disappeared
for two hours last night.

588
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,032
I saw her wagon rocking
the other night.

589
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,969
Do you think
it was she
or the husband?

590
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:30,306
Oh, please,
that woman--

591
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,053
Ladies, listen...

592
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,491
As long as we're all going
to be on this trip together,

593
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,262
I think it's time we get
some things out in the open.

594
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:58,234
Now, I've heard
the gossiping...

595
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,236
And the whispering,

596
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,206
and if there's something
you want to say,

597
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:07,477
why don't you say it
to my face?

598
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,913
What's it like?

599
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,115
How much money
did you make?

600
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:15,818
How do you
stay awake?

601
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:19,989
- You don't actually
blow, do you?
- Blow what?

602
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,759
Constance!

603
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:28,464
Ladies! Ladies!
Oh, well, I'll tell you
anything you want.

604
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:31,367
Uh, yeah.
You, henrietta.

605
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:33,703
Uh... my husband told me...

606
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:38,007
That the largest penis
ever recorded was 4 1/2 inches.

607
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,142
Is that true?

608
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:47,617
So, Harlow,

609
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,620
you sure there's nothing
you'd like to share
with the group?

610
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:53,989
About what?
Phil, I got one!

611
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,492
About these dogs
that were stuck--

612
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:58,861
Harry Bob,
terrific.

613
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,963
Look here, Harry Bob.

614
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,998
When I was 10 years old,

615
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:06,469
I killed my best friend
Tommy hanley.

616
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:09,639
The folks thought he died
falling out a tree.

617
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,475
The fact of the matter is,

618
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:17,647
I beat him with a club
then drug him in the woods
so's it'd look that way.

619
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,649
Ha ha ha!

620
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,718
I have no idea
why I done it.

621
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:27,590
Ha ha ha!
Thank you, doctor.

622
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:31,293
I feel better already.
We knowed it was you.

623
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:34,163
No, you did not,
neither.
Yeah, we did.

624
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,333
We knew.
No, you did not!

625
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:44,540
Actually, it's very Santa fe,

626
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:48,043
with the conflicting
earth tones
and the primitive motif.

627
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:51,046
But the whole thing's
busy for me.

628
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,349
How about you, Zeke?

629
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,351
What does it mean,
Harlow?

630
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,854
It's sort of
a signpost,

631
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,857
a message to US
from the sioux.

632
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,058
The message is,
uh, what?

633
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:06,562
Well, it means if you can
read this message,

634
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:09,398
you've come too far.

635
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,400
I can't read.

636
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,402
Where have you
led US?

637
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,638
Oh, shut up, Ben.
Really!

638
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:19,942
Harlow's instincts
were right. Following that
stupid map led US here.

639
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:23,145
- Where is here?
- Indian country.

640
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:25,781
- What?
- Indian country!

641
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:30,285
Oh, great.
Just what we need.

642
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,287
Oh!

643
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:35,925
You got to
believe in him.

644
00:46:35,994 --> 00:46:39,896
Quiet down.
Quiet down!

645
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:43,165
I said quiet--

646
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:47,603
The man said
quiet down!

647
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:51,574
- What the hell
was you thinking?
- I'm sorry.

648
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:55,578
All right.
If we're going to survive
in Indian country,

649
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:58,581
we're going to start
thinking like Indians.

650
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,451
First, we'll walk barefoot,
just like the Indians.

651
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,954
I thought Indians
wore moccasins.

652
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:08,357
Well, Ben, we don't have
any moccasins.

653
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,426
Excuse me,
gents.

654
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,763
I actually
brought a pair
for summer wear.

655
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,133
I really think
they'd just be perfect.

656
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,708
Julian will wear moccasins,

657
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:29,978
and the rest of US
will go barefoot.

658
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,456
Next we'll wrap
all the metal riggings...

659
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,458
On our horses and wagons--

660
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,961
anything that rattles in cloth
to muffle the sound.

661
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,967
We'll travel by night
and hide out by day.

662
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:56,305
We'll make camp in an arroyo
so we're hidden from view.

663
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,809
No campfires.
We'll sleep on the ground,
just like the Indians.

664
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:11,420
I'm up. I'm up.
I'm up. I'm up.
I'm up. I'm up.

665
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,489
What is it?

666
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,561
Ahh.

667
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,069
Ahh.

668
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,080
Uh-oh.

669
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,590
Uh... excuse me.

670
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,593
Good morning!

671
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:26,762
Uh, you speakum English?

672
00:49:56,694 --> 00:50:00,962
You've gotten US
in enough trouble.
I'll handle this.

673
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:15,310
You want to shave
a buffalo butt...

674
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:19,147
And dance naked
with a beaver?

675
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:21,149
You speak English.
That's great.

676
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,151
We want to travel east...

677
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,888
To the land
of the rising sun.

678
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:29,658
Skip the euphemisms.
I know which way east is.

679
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:33,995
What did I do?

680
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:54,650
Ha ha ha!

681
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:49,130
I'd like you
to keep it...

682
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,869
As a gift
from me to you
for your help.

683
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,909
Wow! A Colt .45!

684
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:06,048
Whoa!
Aah!

685
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,360
Hyah! Head up!
head up!

686
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:04,273
Damn! Oh!
Ow!

687
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:28,030
Ah-ah-aah!

688
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:44,480
Son of a bitch!

689
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:12,007
Woo! Woo!

690
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:14,076
Woo! Woo! Woo!

691
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:16,078
Woo! Woo!
"More steam."

692
00:55:16,147 --> 00:55:18,680
"I thought I'd tell you.
We ain't got no more fuel.

693
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:20,882
We run out of coal
two hours ago."

694
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:24,920
"You what?"
"I was afraid of what
you'd do to me."

695
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:29,624
"That's all right.
We'll demolish this church
and burn the wood."

696
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:33,828
"No, please.
Whatever you do,
don't harm my church."

697
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,533
"Shut up, preacher,
or I'll set your hat on fire.

698
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:41,670
Ha ha ha!"
uh, sir.

699
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,174
I told you
never to disturb me
at this hour!

700
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:47,176
I am so sorry.

701
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:50,679
We've been getting
some reports that some
of the homesteaders...

702
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:54,516
Are having second thoughts
about the land rush.

703
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:58,019
Apparently the word
about the wagon train
is spreading.

704
00:55:58,089 --> 00:56:00,456
What about
that wagon train, sir?

705
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,924
Slade has not been
very effective.

706
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:05,794
Fortunately,
I have a backup plan.

707
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,796
Ahh!

708
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,466
And they should be
just about there.

709
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:31,186
So what brought you
out west, Julian?

710
00:56:31,255 --> 00:56:35,190
Oh, the men.
I just heard it was
chock-full of them.

711
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:39,194
The men?
Oh, yeah. I get it.

712
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:42,664
I guess men read more books
than women, right?
Y-Yes.

713
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,833
Here you go,
Millie, darlin'.

714
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,440
Ah, that's great.
Thanks.

715
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:56,445
Hell.
Look at you, Julian.

716
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:58,947
What did you see,
a mermaid?

717
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:02,551
Cold water usually does
the opposite to me.

718
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:19,400
Harlow, you've been
so good to me.

719
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:23,271
Just doing
my job, ma'am.

720
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,941
Listen...

721
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,109
I was thinking.

722
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:32,413
Maybe you'd like to come
to my wagon tonight,

723
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:35,416
and we can talk...

724
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,853
Or something.

725
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,425
Ma'am, i--

726
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:48,129
i'd--

727
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,765
did I say
something wrong?

728
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:53,969
No. No, ma'am.
You didn't say anything wrong.

729
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,471
It's just that--
well, you see--

730
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:59,975
fact is, I don't get paid
till St. Louis.

731
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:03,578
As much as I'd like to,

732
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,613
I just can't right now.

733
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:08,116
But I will when I can...

734
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:12,020
When I have
what I don't have now.
What?

735
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:15,390
Well, I didn't mean--

736
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:18,026
as if I'd consider it,

737
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:20,528
you-- you...
You gimpy old drunk!

738
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:23,932
Ma'am?
Ohh!

739
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,703
Ohh!

740
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:33,441
Hmph!

741
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,510
Hyah! Hyah!

742
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,931
Mount up!

743
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,466
Wagons, ho!

744
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,069
No, wait.
I'm Harlow.

745
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:03,371
You were Harlow
last time.

746
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,373
Hey, you know
something?

747
00:59:05,442 --> 00:59:07,375
Whatever we are
to the world,

748
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:09,911
we're heroes to them.

749
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,447
You can be Phil.
No way!

750
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:15,951
I'd rather be
Harry Bob than Phil.

751
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:19,955
Want to be
Harry Bob then?
okay.

752
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,857
Let's go! Come on!

753
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:41,476
Belle.
Harlow.

754
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:44,980
I'd just like to apologize
for the other day.

755
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,983
I don't know why--
oh, no. No. No.

756
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:50,485
Harlow, it's me
that should apologize.

757
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:53,488
I had no cause
to get righteous.

758
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:57,492
It's what I've done
for the past five years.

759
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,495
We've all done things
we're not proud of.

760
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,998
At least
I know I have.

761
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:06,001
I'd just like
to say that, uh...

762
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:09,504
No, no, no.
Harlow, it's okay.

763
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:12,507
Ma'am, I would
like to say it...

764
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:14,509
Because you
deserve it, ma'am.

765
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:18,513
I'd like to say
that I don't
think of you...

766
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:20,515
As just a whore.

767
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,518
Oh, Harlow.
That's so sweet.

768
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:25,520
Thank you, ma'am.

769
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,357
Good evening to you.

770
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,561
Ahh.

771
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:46,307
Oh! Oh!

772
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,443
Constance? Phil?

773
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:51,979
I finally figured out
where I knowed him from!

774
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:53,915
Wait, I want to hear.
Hi, constance.

775
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,950
Hi. Ohh...

776
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,693
This better be good.

777
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:08,263
I met him
back in '46.

778
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:12,267
He was wagon master
for a certain party
going to California.

779
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,537
- What party?
- Damn if I can remember.

780
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,838
Zeke, you're killing me.

781
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:20,141
I keep thinking
of reindeer.

782
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:24,946
Reindeer? You mean,
like dancer and prancer?

783
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,948
Nope.
Name some more.

784
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,016
Uh...
Donner and blitzen.

785
01:01:29,086 --> 01:01:31,018
That's it!
The blitzen party.

786
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:34,622
The donner party?
The donner party?

787
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,325
Oh, yeah. That's it.

788
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:40,328
The worst wagon train
disaster in history,

789
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:43,164
where all those people
froze to death
in the sierras?

790
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:45,166
And those
that survived...

791
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:49,404
Let's just say
they had their friends
for dinner.

792
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:51,473
I hired
the wagon master...

793
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,475
From the donner party.

794
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,477
Huh!

795
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:59,013
If he survived,
do you suppose
he ate--

796
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,317
Zeke! Ben!
I knew it when he said
he didn't eat meat.

797
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,487
Look. Those were
very extreme conditions.

798
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:09,491
Who knows how any one of US
would have survived...

799
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:12,994
All that snow, right?
Right.

800
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,996
Let's keep this
amongst ourselves.

801
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,999
There's no sense
in alarming the others.

802
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,302
I'm alarmed.
There's nothing
to worry about.

803
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:24,239
Unless it snows.
For Christ's sake, Zeke.

804
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:27,142
It's June!
Shh!

805
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,181
Uh! Ohh!

806
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,517
Ohh!

807
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,685
Oh, my.

808
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:45,026
Looks like Christmas
came a little early
this year, Phil.

809
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,028
Jesus!
Must be a...

810
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,664
Must be
a freak storm, huh?

811
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:53,635
Hey.

812
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,870
Hey, Zeke.

813
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,872
I know
what you're thinking.

814
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,907
Stop it! It's crazy!

815
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:02,544
I can't--
I can't believe it!

816
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:04,546
I can't believe--

817
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:06,548
uh! Uh!

818
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:09,050
It's--
it's snowing!

819
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,052
We're marooned!

820
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:13,655
Ben, you're overreacting.

821
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:16,157
Hey, where's he going?

822
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:19,694
How do I know?
Maybe to shoot a little game.

823
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:21,763
Oh, my god!

824
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:26,768
There's no reason
to get crazy.
Harlow's our friend.

825
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:29,771
They were
all friends
at donner pass.

826
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,840
Oh, my go--

827
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:35,476
uh! Get a doctor!

828
01:03:35,546 --> 01:03:37,478
Iam a doctor.

829
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,321
Mmm.

830
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:51,325
Come and get it!
come and get it! Food!

831
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:54,195
Food!
Food!

832
01:03:54,264 --> 01:03:56,698
Get out of my way!

833
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:59,434
The meat will be ready
in one minute.

834
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:03,137
- Where did you get this?
- Harlow!

835
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:08,610
- Oh, how nice.
- - Me and my brother got dibs on the rump.

836
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:13,548
- Where is he?
- - I haven't seen Clayton today, actually.

837
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:15,884
I'm so hungry!

838
01:04:15,953 --> 01:04:19,153
Oh, my go--
don't eat that!

839
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,056
Hmm?
Hmm?

840
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:25,994
- I'm sorry, Clayton.
- You're sorry?

841
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:29,965
Whoever stole my Millie's
going to be really sorry.

842
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,766
Oh, Millie. Super.

843
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:37,371
- Ha!
- this is a very good feast.

844
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,643
Hey, give me some.
Thanks.
Here we go, zekey.

845
01:04:44,514 --> 01:04:46,547
Git!

846
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:48,950
Git!

847
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:10,338
Heh heh heh!

848
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,942
Bring it up now!

849
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,593
Heh heh heh!

850
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,702
Eh... eh...
What?

851
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,224
Ugh!

852
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:09,530
Heh heh heh!
Eek!

853
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,599
Uh! Uh!

854
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:22,744
Hmm!

855
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:28,850
Aah!
Aah!

856
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:34,288
Aah!
Ooh! Uh!

857
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:37,058
Oh!

858
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:39,194
Oh!

859
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:44,099
Aah! Ooh!
Ah! Oh!

860
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:47,301
Git up! Hyah!

861
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,370
Git up!

862
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:56,111
Whoa!

863
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,679
Whoa!
Whoa!

864
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:00,949
Whoa!
whoa!

865
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:12,460
Mister,
you look like you been
blowed from a Cannon...

866
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,629
And landed
on a barrel cactus.

867
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:18,566
The name's Slade.

868
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:20,568
John Slade.

869
01:07:20,637 --> 01:07:24,739
Harlow.
James Harlow.

870
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,845
Slade.
That name sounds
real familiar.

871
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:33,848
Let's not start
that again, Zeke,
huh?

872
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,118
Oh!

873
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:40,621
Ow!

874
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:44,458
1, 2, 3, 4,

875
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,962
5, 6, 7, 8,

876
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:52,466
9, 10, 11, 12.

877
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,469
Aha. Hmm!

878
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,472
Hey.
Hmm!

879
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,641
Oh!

880
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:03,477
Bastard!
Could be.

881
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:06,981
Don't know
if my ma and pa were married.

882
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:10,484
Killed my pa
before I could ask.

883
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,987
Mr. Slade.

884
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:15,990
Uh... hi.

885
01:08:16,059 --> 01:08:17,992
Phil Taylor.

886
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:20,995
Uh...

887
01:08:21,064 --> 01:08:23,131
Pioneer.

888
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:27,135
Listen. Boy...
How did we come
to this, huh?

889
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,137
You're counting
your bullets,

890
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:31,505
and we're, uh,
saying our prayers.

891
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:34,008
This happened
so fast, you know?

892
01:08:34,077 --> 01:08:37,011
Whew! I mean,
what if you, uh...

893
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,513
You took a moment
for yourself,

894
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:42,616
you know,
like a time-out,
if you will?

895
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:44,652
Think about
maybe saying,

896
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:49,490
"hey, I don't want
to plug these guys
in the back of the head."

897
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:52,426
Ha ha ha!

898
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:54,528
Ha ha ha!

899
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:58,365
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

900
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:00,001
Ha ha!

901
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,072
I like you, Phil.

902
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,774
I like you,
too, Slade.

903
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:08,843
Tell you what...

904
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:13,881
I'm going to
shoot you first...

905
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:17,418
And save you
all that, uh...

906
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,420
Painful anticipating.

907
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,623
- Pa!
- okay, stud.

908
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:25,626
Ease the hammer back
nice and slow...

909
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:27,661
And give me the weapon.

910
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:37,671
Julian.

911
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:44,846
That Julian?

912
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,948
Name's Slade.

913
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,983
Oh, super.

914
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:54,622
Spell it out for me
so I can get it right
on your tombstone.

915
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,091
Oh!
Oh!

916
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:22,250
Your move, sissy boy.

917
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:25,352
Sissy boy? Oh, please.
That is so dodge city.

918
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:31,092
You're gonna die slow...
Real slow.

919
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,595
All right.

920
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,144
What was that?

921
01:10:50,213 --> 01:10:53,981
- The warning shot.
- Warning shot.

922
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,251
You think
a warning shot's
going to scare me?

923
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,055
It's lodged
about 6 inches
in your tummy.

924
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,831
Hmm?

925
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:17,671
Wow!

926
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:20,574
You're good.
I know.

927
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:25,012
I hear that
all the time.
Listen, pumpkin,

928
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:28,015
you've got to get yourself
some medical attention.

929
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:30,684
Gunshots have
a tendency to fester.

930
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:34,688
And I'm really sorry
we had to meet this way.

931
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,473
Eh...

932
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:57,845
Son of a gun!

933
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:02,884
Happy Valentine's day.

934
01:12:06,289 --> 01:12:08,289
Yeah!

935
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,432
Hyah!

936
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:24,372
Hyah!

937
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,309
Slice, slice, slice...
And lift.

938
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,973
Hyah! Hyah!

939
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:02,310
Whoa!
Ho, there!

940
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,478
Hup!

941
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,650
Shit!

942
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:13,154
Everybody is going on about
this wagons east movement.

943
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,857
There's rumors
of crop failure and cholera,
rustlers and Indians.

944
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:19,660
They're teetering
on the edge.
We might lose 'em.

945
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:22,663
I'll talk to them.
I tried.
They just won't listen.

946
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,666
Now with Slade dead
and your backup--

947
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,169
whatever happened
to your backup plan?

948
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,872
Who the hell knows?
They're probably dead drunk
in some cow town.

949
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:36,010
No more amateurs.
I'm calling in the cavalry.
Great, great!

950
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,012
Who would
that be, sir?

951
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,514
A group of men
on horseback...

952
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:45,019
Who wear blue uniforms
and yellow scarves
and sabers and guns.

953
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:48,522
Don't you know
who the United States
cavalry is?

954
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:52,026
I thought you were
using a figure
of speech,

955
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:54,095
which, of course,
you're not.

956
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:57,764
Hyah! Hyah!

957
01:13:57,834 --> 01:14:00,367
Hey, it's big snake!

958
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,171
Oh.
Big snake,
what'd you see?

959
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:07,041
Over here.

960
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,543
Well?
Bad news.
Big trouble.

961
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,846
Let's keep that
to ourselves.

962
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:17,718
- So what's news?
- Cavalry's coming.

963
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,486
They come
to stop you.

964
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:23,290
Come to stop US?
That's ridiculous.

965
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:28,929
My hunch is this--
that land rush coming up
on the 4th of July...

966
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:31,999
They don't want US
spoiling their fireworks.

967
01:14:32,068 --> 01:14:35,069
But we're so close
to... St. Louis.

968
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,837
All the more reason
not to chance it.

969
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:45,645
All right.
Listen. Listen.

970
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:47,748
I say we move on.

971
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,951
Who's wagon master here?
We hired you.
We can overrule you.

972
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:55,022
I'm telling ya, I've got
a bad feeling about this.

973
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:58,792
Like when you led
the donner party?

974
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:01,862
The donner party?
hello.

975
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:04,731
I don't get it.
Who are the donners?

976
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,469
Harlow was
the wagon master
for the donner party...

977
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:12,172
Before he became
a vegetarian.

978
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:14,474
Weren't you, Harlow?

979
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:17,577
- Am I right, Phil?
- thanks, Ben.

980
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:22,983
It's a little unfair.
You can't condemn a man
based on Zeke's memory.

981
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:26,553
- What memory?
- Tell them it ain't so,
Harlow.

982
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:30,991
Yeah, tell him.
Tell him.

983
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:43,904
Ohh.
Ohh.

984
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,926
Harlow!

985
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:14,134
Harlow, what's wrong?
Where you going?

986
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:19,706
Harlow!

987
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:24,044
It was so stupid.
You scared everybody.

988
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:26,113
That is enough! Shh!

989
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:30,817
The cavalry.
It's the cavalry.

990
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,686
Oh...

991
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:36,991
I go first. These are
lieutenant bars, mister.

992
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:40,660
What do they want?
what did we do?

993
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:49,136
- Hi, lieutenant.
- Yeah. Hello.

994
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,007
As of 0800 this morning,

995
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:56,010
this assembly has been
officially classified...

996
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:58,979
As a federal insur--

997
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:04,584
rection.

998
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,855
I have orders from
general William h. Larchmont...

999
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:13,027
To instruct you
to either turn back
or face the consequences.

1000
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:16,596
What exactly are
the consequences?

1001
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:20,367
Your standard
u.S. Cavalry massacre.
He can explain.

1002
01:17:20,436 --> 01:17:23,670
You have 24 hours
to decide.

1003
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:27,007
- Is that 24 hours
from right now?
- Uh, yeah.

1004
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:31,111
- What time do you have?
- What time do you have?

1005
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:34,181
- 2:25.
- Well, then, 2:25 it is.

1006
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,283
Uh, have a nice day.

1007
01:17:36,352 --> 01:17:38,352
Nice seeing you again.

1008
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:44,458
Let's move out!
Oh, great.
Nobody's listening.

1009
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:46,460
We'll get killed.

1010
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:50,630
Damn. I should
have said 2:30.
Oh, what's the difference?

1011
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:53,200
At least
they gave US 24.

1012
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:55,936
Ow!

1013
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:59,973
Ooh!
It's my brother.
He's been shot.

1014
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,642
My leg!
My poor little brother.

1015
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,911
Oh, god!
My poor little brother.

1016
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:09,483
What happened, Clayton?
He was biting off
a chaw of tobacco when...

1017
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:12,486
- Yeah?
- I shot him.

1018
01:18:12,555 --> 01:18:14,488
Excuse me?

1019
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:17,791
- It was my tobacco.
- That's a good reason.

1020
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:21,395
Anybody here know
how to remove a bullet?
Honey?

1021
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:25,665
- Phil?
- I can't pick up a scalpel.

1022
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:28,868
- How bad is it?
- Only a flesh wound.

1023
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:30,971
Oh.

1024
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,774
Aren't you going to
help Mr. Ferguson,
daddy?

1025
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:46,153
- Come on. Move him.
- Easy.

1026
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,955
Bring him over
into my wagon.

1027
01:18:49,024 --> 01:18:51,925
We'll need hot water
and plenty of towels.

1028
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:54,661
I was just dropping--

1029
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,663
You done shot me!

1030
01:18:56,732 --> 01:19:01,435
Aah!
what are you doing, doc?

1031
01:19:01,504 --> 01:19:04,438
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel. Mm-hmm.

1032
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:06,440
Here you are.

1033
01:19:06,509 --> 01:19:10,277
Aah!

1034
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:12,946
Aah!

1035
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:15,449
Scissors.

1036
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:17,451
Scissors.

1037
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,288
Aah!
woo!

1038
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:26,960
What's the matter
with you?

1039
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:41,808
I did it.

1040
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:45,412
I got in there,
and I forgot
about all my fears.

1041
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:49,583
It was like old times.
The knife became
an extension of my hand.

1042
01:19:49,652 --> 01:19:52,852
The blood, the tissue--
none of it bothered me.

1043
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:55,355
Dr. Taylor,
I'm proud of you.

1044
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:58,192
Oh. Oh.

1045
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,494
Uh,
so my brother,

1046
01:20:00,563 --> 01:20:03,129
he can walk
again?

1047
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:09,002
Oh, uh...
About that, Clay,
you know,

1048
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:12,005
these flesh wounds
can be pretty tricky.

1049
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:15,509
There are
complications and--
you had to amputate?

1050
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:18,011
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

1051
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,515
The leg is, uh, fine.
A little stiff.

1052
01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:23,517
Now, that's
to be expected.

1053
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:29,022
Well, you know,
actually, Clay, uh...

1054
01:20:29,091 --> 01:20:32,526
The leg is not
the only part that's stiff.

1055
01:20:32,595 --> 01:20:35,529
Actually, his whole body
is kind of, uh--

1056
01:20:35,598 --> 01:20:38,232
well, he's, uh...
He's, uh...

1057
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,335
He's dead.

1058
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:45,472
But he, uh,
he wanted you
to have this, huh?

1059
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:49,109
Oh! My tobacco!

1060
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:51,278
Thanks, doc.

1061
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:58,084
Uh... oh...

1062
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:01,622
Harlow!
Harlow!

1063
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,558
Harlow!

1064
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:08,061
Harlow... uh!

1065
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,063
Sorry, sir.
You were delirious.

1066
01:21:10,132 --> 01:21:12,566
You want to
slap me back?

1067
01:21:12,635 --> 01:21:14,568
You're more
than welcome to.

1068
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:17,571
Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.

1069
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,574
I was dreaming.
Yes, you were.

1070
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:24,077
Did I say anything?
Well, you, uh,
mentioned Harlow.

1071
01:21:24,146 --> 01:21:26,880
Harlow!
You two have some sort
of history together?

1072
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:31,117
No!
Yes, yes, yes.

1073
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,119
Yes, we do.

1074
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:35,989
It was about 20 years ago...

1075
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:38,992
When Harlow
led the donner party,

1076
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,496
and I, rightfully so,
appropriated many
of his horses...

1077
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:47,100
And most of his supplies
for my raid on the Mexicans.

1078
01:21:47,169 --> 01:21:51,638
While his pathetic attempts
at rescue failed, of course,

1079
01:21:51,707 --> 01:21:55,141
I rode on to glory
and became a colonel.

1080
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:59,513
They others froze
and ate each other.
Oh, gee!

1081
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:01,515
Luck of the draw,
lieutenant.

1082
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:04,017
Just the luck
of the draw.

1083
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:07,854
Ooh!

1084
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:10,857
But this is just
the kind of thing...

1085
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:13,860
That the press blows
way out of proportion,

1086
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:19,032
especially in light
of a presidential campaign.

1087
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:21,468
It's--
it's official, sir?

1088
01:22:21,537 --> 01:22:24,538
Yes, lieutenant.

1089
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,541
It's official.

1090
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,543
Damn that Harlow.

1091
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,546
Thought he drank himself
into oblivion years ago.

1092
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:36,049
But no matter.
I'll take care
of him tomorrow.

1093
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:38,051
The secret dies
with him.

1094
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:40,620
No one else knows.
Except for me.

1095
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:44,057
Who told you?
You did, sir.

1096
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:46,893
Very observant,
lieutenant.

1097
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,564
Very observant.

1098
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:53,567
But now I think
you have two choices--

1099
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:58,071
use your head and accept
a plum position
in my cabinet...

1100
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:02,576
Or search for your brains
by the light of a candle.

1101
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,944
Good night,
Mr. President.

1102
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,983
Good night,
Mr. Secretary.

1103
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,921
Are the men in bed?

1104
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:17,591
Well, they were, sir.
I don't know about now.

1105
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:21,595
Good. All right,
lieutenant.
Tuck you in, huh?

1106
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:25,599
Yes, sir.
I think a bedtime story
would be in order.

1107
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:29,569
All right, sir. Just one.
It's very late, sir.

1108
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:33,273
Do you want to hear
Indian Joe meets
the talking rock?

1109
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:37,310
Well, the colonel's favorite
isthe lone pony
on the high plains.

1110
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:39,379
All right.
Lone pony, it is.

1111
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:48,622
Hit me.
Dang. This boy
can drink.

1112
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,625
I need a few more
customers like him.

1113
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:56,129
Say, dusty, you hear
about that wagon train
heading this way?

1114
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:59,098
Yeah. A bunch of whores,
degenerates, and murderers.

1115
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:02,468
There's talk about them
massacring settlers
along the trail--

1116
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:05,706
pillaging and raping
like it's nobody's business.

1117
01:24:05,774 --> 01:24:09,509
They're letting Indians
sleep with their women.

1118
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:11,912
Well, they're
going to get theirs.

1119
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:16,683
There's a rumor that
the seventh cavalry's going
to wipe them out.

1120
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:19,920
They're sending in
their crackerjack
general larchmont...

1121
01:24:19,989 --> 01:24:22,422
To make sure
the job's done.

1122
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:25,425
Let's have one
for the seventh cavalry!

1123
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:28,194
To the good general!

1124
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:42,442
How am I doing?

1125
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:45,946
Well, they're still
behind you.

1126
01:24:46,015 --> 01:24:49,950
You know the last time
I was on a horse?

1127
01:24:50,019 --> 01:24:52,318
At the carrousel
in St. Louis.

1128
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:54,420
And I was thrown.

1129
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:57,190
The cavalry.

1130
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:00,460
Oh, my god.
Whoa!

1131
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:02,696
Circle the wagons!

1132
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:04,965
Git!

1133
01:25:05,034 --> 01:25:08,869
Phil, I got an idea!
Keep those wagons around!

1134
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,705
Hyah!

1135
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:15,976
Phil, you know how white guys
always circle in their wagons?

1136
01:25:16,045 --> 01:25:20,147
Makes it easier
for the cavalry
to go around.

1137
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:22,649
Why don't you
square the wagons?

1138
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:25,986
The cavalry would
have to go in wide circles.

1139
01:25:26,055 --> 01:25:29,056
Square the wagons!
Square the wagons!

1140
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,292
Square the wagons!
Square the wagons,
whities!

1141
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,627
Square the wagons?
I don't get it!

1142
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:45,072
Billy!

1143
01:25:48,077 --> 01:25:49,509
Billy!

1144
01:25:49,578 --> 01:25:52,012
Miss Lindsey,
get back.

1145
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:56,917
I got it!

1146
01:25:56,985 --> 01:26:00,420
So this is what
it looks like in here?

1147
01:26:00,488 --> 01:26:03,023
How do they walk
in these things?

1148
01:26:03,092 --> 01:26:04,624
Big snake!

1149
01:26:08,097 --> 01:26:10,530
What are you doing?
It's filthy.

1150
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:13,867
I'm hiding behind it.
Get over there.

1151
01:26:13,936 --> 01:26:17,838
What do you think
you're doing with that?
Thank you.

1152
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:21,208
All right!
Everybody stay down!

1153
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:26,213
Stay down!
wait for my command to fire!

1154
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,320
And remember...

1155
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:36,322
No matter what happens,

1156
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:41,461
no one but no one can take away
what this trip has meant to US.

1157
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,532
I did it, honey.

1158
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:50,003
I got in there
and forgot my fears.

1159
01:26:50,072 --> 01:26:53,306
Dr. Taylor, I am
very proud of you.

1160
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:03,683
I didn't properly
introduce myself.
The name's Harlow.

1161
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:05,852
I'll be
your wagon master.

1162
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:16,997
Julian, would you mind
scrubbing my back?

1163
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:21,067
Since that bronc threw me,
I can't reach it.

1164
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:01,141
All right,
lieutenant!

1165
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:04,644
Let's sound the attack!
I want my big horn.

1166
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:08,148
Sir, are you sure
we really need
the big horn?

1167
01:28:08,217 --> 01:28:10,150
Of course, you idiot!

1168
01:28:10,219 --> 01:28:14,154
It instills fear in the enemy
and saps their strength...

1169
01:28:14,223 --> 01:28:16,656
And turns their bowels
to jelly.

1170
01:28:16,725 --> 01:28:20,260
Where's my big horn?
Souza!

1171
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:23,429
Yes, sir!
Sound the charge.

1172
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:29,369
Let's kill some people!

1173
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:35,541
- To glory!
- Charge!

1174
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:41,348
Charge!

1175
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:45,952
Damn it.
Honey, is that manual
under the seat?

1176
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:51,892
Go get them,
dad.

1177
01:29:10,379 --> 01:29:12,879
They've squared
the wagons!

1178
01:29:12,948 --> 01:29:15,215
They've what?

1179
01:29:15,284 --> 01:29:19,585
They're not
shooting, lieutenant.
Why aren't they shooting?

1180
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:23,390
Sir, these people
aren't renegades.
They're just settlers.

1181
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:27,560
Fool. That's what
they want you to think.

1182
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,896
Ho!
Ho!

1183
01:29:29,965 --> 01:29:32,032
They're women and children.

1184
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:37,203
They're settlers.
I ain't shooting.

1185
01:29:37,272 --> 01:29:42,008
- Is that Mr. Harlow?
- Where?

1186
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:51,418
It's Harlow!
It's Harlow!

1187
01:29:51,486 --> 01:29:53,453
Harlow.

1188
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:57,223
Harlow.

1189
01:30:02,998 --> 01:30:06,666
Let's go.
Hyah! Come on!

1190
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:11,804
Hyah!

1191
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:18,278
All right!

1192
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:27,887
Hope I'm not
too late to join
your little party.

1193
01:30:27,956 --> 01:30:31,858
Let's forget about
the settlers and shoot him.
Fire when ready.

1194
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:34,461
Easy, boys.
You may get me,

1195
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:38,431
but I'm going to take
your fearless leader
with me.

1196
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,433
What should
we do, sir?

1197
01:30:40,502 --> 01:30:44,704
Do? Uh... uh...

1198
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:48,708
Taylor! Smith!
Have your men form
a human shield around me.

1199
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:52,078
General, sir,
I'm calling you out.

1200
01:30:57,052 --> 01:31:00,453
I've handled tougher men
than you, Harlow.

1201
01:31:00,522 --> 01:31:03,856
Lieutenant, shoot him.

1202
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:06,659
I'd like to, sir,
but I'm afraid
my hands are tied.

1203
01:31:06,728 --> 01:31:10,163
He's called you out
in front of the men.

1204
01:31:10,232 --> 01:31:12,999
It's a, you know,
western thing.

1205
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:16,036
A western thing,
you say?

1206
01:31:16,104 --> 01:31:19,572
General, sir,
I'd like to help you
with your dismount.

1207
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:21,707
Why, thank you, son.

1208
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:42,429
You pack
a pretty fair punch
there, Harlow.

1209
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:47,033
Knock one for me!

1210
01:31:47,102 --> 01:31:51,003
Go, Harlow!
Yeah, that's right!
You heard me!

1211
01:31:51,073 --> 01:31:53,339
Fix his wagon,
Harlow.

1212
01:31:53,408 --> 01:31:55,975
- Aah!
- Aah!

1213
01:32:01,183 --> 01:32:03,483
Good jab.

1214
01:32:06,388 --> 01:32:08,321
Back down on the ground.

1215
01:32:08,390 --> 01:32:10,490
Keep your hands up.

1216
01:32:29,578 --> 01:32:32,011
How long
do these things
usually last?

1217
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,013
How would I know?

1218
01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:36,483
I'm getting
kind of hungry.

1219
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:40,019
Can I go play?
Sure, sweetheart.

1220
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,293
You're losing him,
Harlow!

1221
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:50,997
Where are you going?

1222
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:54,634
Good. Stay down.

1223
01:33:04,279 --> 01:33:06,279
Whoops.

1224
01:33:06,348 --> 01:33:08,448
Aah!

1225
01:33:10,519 --> 01:33:12,718
Would you like
a vanilla wafer?

1226
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:14,854
Here you go.

1227
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:20,293
- I got it!
- Yes!

1228
01:33:20,362 --> 01:33:23,963
Harder!
Push hard!

1229
01:33:36,044 --> 01:33:37,977
Huh?

1230
01:33:43,051 --> 01:33:45,051
Okay.

1231
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:48,854
Get up!

1232
01:34:03,071 --> 01:34:05,205
Yay!

1233
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,943
Over here.
Okay, honey!

1234
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:14,947
Let's go have
some pie!

1235
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:19,952
Harlow!
Yeah!

1236
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:23,456
James aloysius Harlow!

1237
01:34:25,694 --> 01:34:27,960
I knew you'd do it,
buddy!

1238
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:30,730
You have a seat,
you big hero.

1239
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:36,336
Today, we open the bounties
of our glorious land
to the common man!

1240
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:38,338
So look to the west,

1241
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:41,974
for therein lies
your future!

1242
01:34:42,043 --> 01:34:43,976
Wha--?

1243
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:48,615
Where the humble wagon...

1244
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:53,319
- What is it?
- Looks like a wagon train.

1245
01:34:53,388 --> 01:34:55,988
But they're heading east.

1246
01:34:56,057 --> 01:34:59,692
They're going
the wrong way!

1247
01:34:59,761 --> 01:35:04,196
That look good?
My hair look white
to you, son?

1248
01:35:04,266 --> 01:35:06,966
Come see me
when you've got
some mink.

1249
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:11,404
If I get my hands
on that kid
that scalped me...

1250
01:35:11,473 --> 01:35:15,141
Look at this, dad!
Jeremiah,
put that away!

1251
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:19,011
Showed initiative.
He'll make a fine
officer one day.

1252
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:23,182
I'm proud
to be scalped
by a boy like that.

1253
01:35:23,251 --> 01:35:27,186
Listen to me!
Pay no heed
to those fools!

1254
01:35:27,255 --> 01:35:30,323
They're dunderheads!
They're going the wrong way!

1255
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:33,426
You've got
to listen to me!

1256
01:35:33,495 --> 01:35:36,996
Land for the taking!
Your time is now!

1257
01:35:37,064 --> 01:35:39,999
Land rushers,
get ready!

1258
01:35:40,067 --> 01:35:42,168
Not now!

1259
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:45,204
About time. Ah, well.

1260
01:35:45,273 --> 01:35:48,007
Smedly!

1261
01:35:51,513 --> 01:35:53,513
Aah!

1262
01:36:04,359 --> 01:36:06,459
Oh, yeah!

1263
01:36:06,528 --> 01:36:08,961
Ha ha ha!

1264
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:22,975
Should we tell them?
Nah. They wouldn't
listen anyway.

1265
01:36:23,044 --> 01:36:24,977
But who knows?

1266
01:36:25,046 --> 01:36:28,481
Maybe it'll
work out for them.

1267
01:36:30,051 --> 01:36:32,017
Ha ha ha!

1268
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:34,987
Wagons east!

1269
01:36:43,565 --> 01:36:45,998
Harlow.
Evening, gentlemen.

1270
01:36:46,067 --> 01:36:48,033
Evening.

1271
01:36:48,102 --> 01:36:50,536
I'd like
to thank you both...

1272
01:36:50,605 --> 01:36:53,673
For, uh, well,
for believing in me.

1273
01:36:53,742 --> 01:36:56,542
We never doubted you
for a second, Harlow.

1274
01:36:56,611 --> 01:36:59,512
Not once?

1275
01:36:59,581 --> 01:37:03,282
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

1276
01:37:03,351 --> 01:37:05,885
- Oh, the river crossing.
- Yeah.

1277
01:37:05,953 --> 01:37:08,855
And the fork
in the road.

1278
01:37:08,923 --> 01:37:10,857
Oh, yeah.

1279
01:37:10,925 --> 01:37:12,925
The Indian camp.

1280
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:15,561
Uh-huh.
And that whole thing--

1281
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:17,563
I got to get going.

1282
01:37:17,632 --> 01:37:22,101
Come on. Please.
Without you, we wouldn't
even be here.

1283
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:25,104
When I ride into
St. Louis tomorrow,

1284
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:29,108
I'll be thinking
of James h. Harlow--
wagon master supreme.

1285
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:31,611
We'll miss riding
with you, Harlow.

1286
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,180
I appreciate that.
I truly do.
You know what?

1287
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:38,284
I wouldn't mind
seeing you again.

1288
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:40,420
I'd look forward
to that,

1289
01:37:40,488 --> 01:37:43,923
especially since
I haven't been paid yet.

1290
01:37:43,991 --> 01:37:47,427
We haven't--
let's wait
until St. Louis.

1291
01:37:47,495 --> 01:37:49,629
He could still
get lost.

1292
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:01,941
Don't you wish
that, uh...

1293
01:38:02,009 --> 01:38:04,944
That this
would never end.

1294
01:38:05,012 --> 01:38:06,946
Yeah.

1295
01:38:07,014 --> 01:38:09,449
Mmm...

1296
01:38:09,517 --> 01:38:13,453
But, I guess it's--

1297
01:38:13,521 --> 01:38:15,955
yeah. I guess.

1298
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:18,458
It's over. Yeah.

1299
01:38:21,529 --> 01:38:24,964
Unless...
Yeah?

1300
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:26,966
Nah.
Unless?

1301
01:38:27,034 --> 01:38:29,969
No. I'd be wrong.
No, Harlow.

1302
01:38:30,037 --> 01:38:33,973
I think I know
what you're thinking,

1303
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:38,177
and it definitely
wouldn't be wrong.

1304
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:40,980
Really?
You mean...
Yes.

1305
01:38:41,048 --> 01:38:42,782
Yes!

1306
01:38:42,851 --> 01:38:46,986
That we could
go back and start
all over again?

1307
01:38:47,054 --> 01:38:50,523
No. Definitely wrong.

1308
01:38:50,592 --> 01:38:53,993
Or...
Or?

1309
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:57,497
We can hook up
and go north
to Canada.

1310
01:38:57,565 --> 01:39:01,333
I hear
it's warm there
all year round.

1311
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:03,435
Oh, Harlow!

1312
01:39:03,505 --> 01:39:06,906
Oh, Harlow!

1313
01:39:09,143 --> 01:39:12,979
Look. A shooting star.

1314
01:39:13,047 --> 01:39:16,582
Quick. Close your eyes
and make a wish.

1315
01:39:19,487 --> 01:39:21,921
Well, what
did you wish for?

1316
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:26,425
If I tell you,
it won't come true.

1317
01:39:33,701 --> 01:39:37,336
Aah!
quick!

1318
01:39:37,405 --> 01:39:39,972
What was that?
Wow!

1319
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,007
It's Clayton Ferguson.

1320
01:39:42,076 --> 01:39:45,210
Oh, my god!

1321
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:47,346
Talk about
your bad luck.

1322
01:39:47,415 --> 01:39:51,384
What do you figure
the chances of that are?

1323
01:39:52,887 --> 01:39:54,820
Where are you
headed, Julian?

1324
01:39:54,889 --> 01:39:57,289
Well, you're gonna laugh.
I've been talking to
some people.

1325
01:39:57,358 --> 01:40:01,059
They think I may have given up
on the west too soon.

1326
01:40:01,128 --> 01:40:04,062
What could possibly
be out there for you?

1327
01:40:04,131 --> 01:40:06,131
San Francisco.

1328
01:40:07,535 --> 01:40:10,469
Come on!

1329
01:40:22,049 --> 01:40:24,717
So long, my friends!

1330
01:40:24,786 --> 01:40:28,387
Bye-bye!
Remember...

1331
01:40:28,456 --> 01:40:31,156
If you're ever
in my country again,

1332
01:40:31,225 --> 01:40:33,225
I'll have to kill you.

1333
01:40:33,294 --> 01:40:35,394
Ha ha ha!

1334
01:40:36,764 --> 01:40:40,232
I'm serious.

1335
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:55,681
Wagons, ho!
