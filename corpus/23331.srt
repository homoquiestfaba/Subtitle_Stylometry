1
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,523
Great. Gunshots. Perfect.

2
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,357
It's just a backfire.

3
00:01:22,396 --> 00:01:23,590
Like you'd know.

4
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,427
Face it, man. We are Lost.

5
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:27,160
Hold on a second.

6
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,728
We're here.
Where the hell are you?

7
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:32,739
Why don't your bitch ass
Look behind you...

8
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:35,071
and see what's crackin', man?

9
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,108
l got this.

10
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:45,813
Let me see it.

11
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:48,252
"Let me see it"?

12
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,085
Let me see it, man.

13
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:52,785
Show him the fucking money.

14
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:54,293
Show him. Show him.

15
00:01:57,764 --> 00:01:58,924
Where is it?

16
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:00,990
You think I got it
in my pocket, man?

17
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:02,160
Yeah.

18
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:03,499
I can't go get it, man.

19
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:05,300
Y'all might be the po-po.

20
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,498
l ain't no po-po.

21
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:10,442
You got to get it yourself, man.

22
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:13,241
It's around the corner,
down the block...

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,305
by the...
What's that, nigger?

24
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:17,578
Loose brick,
north side of the building.

25
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:20,780
Go, man. Bounce.

26
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,721
Let me go on record, Jason.

27
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:25,452
This is a really bad idea.

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,251
There it is.

29
00:02:34,935 --> 00:02:36,527
Nice.

30
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,062
It's easy as pie...

31
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:41,505
and twice as tasty.

32
00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:45,133
Man, someone's screwing
with my car!

33
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:46,372
Come on.

34
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,710
Come on, in here!

35
00:02:58,258 --> 00:03:00,317
I saw them go in.

36
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,123
This is a waste of fucking time.

37
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:03,356
Come on.

38
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:22,005
Forget it.
There's no way they're in there.

39
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:24,676
Trust me. I've been
working here for 20 years.

40
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,845
There's nobody in there.
Let's go.

41
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,253
Fucking donut shop shuts
in Less than five minutes.

42
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:30,779
All right.

43
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,961
Oh, God damn it!

44
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:45,301
Let's get the hell out of here.

45
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:52,470
Dude, that was close.

46
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:53,877
Yeah.

47
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,814
What the fuck was that?

48
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:30,975
Fuck.

49
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,177
Where'd it go?

50
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:34,652
l don't care.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

51
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:47,026
Go!

52
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,830
Go, go, go! Come on!

53
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:13,454
What the hell was that?

54
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:15,984
Hey, you!
Get away from there!

55
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:18,088
Get!

56
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,792
Dude, Let's get out of here.

57
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,095
I'm right behind you, man.

58
00:05:21,134 --> 00:05:23,534
Oh, man.

59
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,504
Palmer!

60
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:34,675
Somebody help me!

61
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,813
Somebody help!

62
00:05:44,457 --> 00:05:48,621
"For outside are
dogs and sorcerers--"

63
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:54,760
Revelation 22: verse 15.

64
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:42,178
-Hey, check it out.
-Jimmy, over here.

65
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:47,248
Yeah. PLace your bets.

66
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:49,118
What's your number?

67
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:51,385
That must be your birthday, huh?

68
00:06:51,424 --> 00:06:53,051
Get your money right.
Put it in here, baby.

69
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:54,253
Let's get these numbers running.

70
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,355
-You all right?
-Yeah.

71
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,163
This looks Like a damn graveyard
around here, bro.

72
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,432
This neighborhood's
making a comeback.

73
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:19,938
Where the hell has it been?

74
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:22,305
This is the ugliest building
I've ever seen.

75
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:24,776
l don't know.

76
00:09:26,713 --> 00:09:29,477
There's something about
this building.

77
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:32,177
It just drew me.

78
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:33,617
All right,
you know something?

79
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,120
I was planning
on doing this...

80
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:37,315
after I got the place
cleaned up and whatnot...

81
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:41,760
but, like the man says,
carpe diem.

82
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:44,058
What do you think about this,
Little sis?

83
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:46,365
That's us.

84
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,629
"llLbient"?
Whose club is that?

85
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:50,101
Ours.

86
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:51,694
What do you mean, ours?

87
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:53,205
Like I said, ours.

88
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,267
Come on, check it out.

89
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,778
-Ln this?
-Yes.

90
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,852
Patrick,
what are you thinking?

91
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,623
This is prehistoric.

92
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,824
Can you picture it, though?

93
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:20,799
Look, we could have
the bar right here.

94
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,801
Dance floor.

95
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:25,326
-Yo, Bill.
-What?

96
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:27,805
DJ booth, right there.

97
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,468
Anything's possible,
but that's a Lot of work.

98
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:32,910
Oh, Jesus.

99
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:35,244
Tell me that's part of a dog
or something.

100
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,340
Yeah, that's dog.

101
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,010
That's from a cat or something.

102
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:40,917
It's a pretty big cat,
Patrick.

103
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:44,014
Cat, dog, whatever.

104
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:45,888
l got a really great deal
on this place.

105
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:48,052
A really great deal, man.

106
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:49,584
They couldn't give it away.

107
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:53,030
It was dead meat stinking up
their books for 20 years.

108
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,698
Don't do that, Maurice.

109
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,999
Stop playing, man.

110
00:10:58,037 --> 00:10:59,698
Chill.

111
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:02,264
The Last owner on the Lease,
before the bank...

112
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:04,105
was back in '79.

113
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:05,701
Some cat named Jimmy Bones.

114
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:07,212
It's been empty ever since.

115
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:08,372
Jimmy Bones?

116
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:10,541
-You heard of him?
-You haven't?

117
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,777
Not that I can remember.

118
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:14,218
He was a Local Legend
back in the Seventies.

119
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:15,220
Sure.

120
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:16,983
There was a song--

121
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:18,615
Sing it for me, baby. Come on.

122
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:19,955
Let's do this. Ready?

123
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:25,293
This is the story of Jimmy Bones

124
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:28,164
BLack as night and hard as stone

125
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:42,004
Sorry.
Something about a deuce.

126
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:44,608
A switchblade and...

127
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,311
A switchblade and a diamond.

128
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:48,820
Get yourself a couple of dollars
and buy a piece of candy.

129
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:50,254
Say, "Thank you, Uncle Jimmy."

130
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:51,813
Thank you, Uncle Jimmy.

131
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,553
Jimmy Bones.

132
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:57,029
Aw, Maurice. Jimmy Bones.
How bad-ass is that?

133
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:58,724
Jimmy Bones!

134
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:00,062
Patrick, I'm going
to tell you something.

135
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:02,090
I'm sold, baby,
and I'll tell you why.

136
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:03,363
This is what I'm thinking.

137
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:06,395
We could use this whole
Jimmy Bones theme...

138
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:08,737
to make this place off the hook.

139
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,766
Look at this place, man.
It's a dump.

140
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,802
Actually, it'd have
to work to be a dump.

141
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:17,543
Look at the rest of the place
before you tear it down.

142
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,845
l know it's cold.

143
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:20,944
I'll run downstairs,
fire up the furnace...

144
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,750
see if I can warm the joint up
a Little bit...

145
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:24,017
and you'll see.

146
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:26,082
This place has
serious potential, man.

147
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:30,118
Potential to Leave me
seriously injured.

148
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:34,156
I'm gonna check out how to get
the DJ equipment up there.

149
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,394
Who's coming?

150
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,300
Aw, man.

151
00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:47,639
Aw, shit.

152
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:05,863
Am I trippin'?

153
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,208
I'm going this way.

154
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:18,537
Yeah, me, too.

155
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:21,208
No, you won't, buddy.

156
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:22,339
You're going
to follow me upstairs.

157
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,678
Tia, be careful.

158
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:30,519
Oh, shit!

159
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:34,617
Fucking rats.

160
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,737
PLease don't bust,
because I can't afford that.

161
00:14:07,527 --> 00:14:09,154
What's up?

162
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:13,655
Contact paranoia.
Maybe you heard of it.

163
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:17,533
I'm buggin' from hanging
with you all the time.

164
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,401
l tell you, goddamn, man.

165
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:21,463
Well, I got bigger problems.

166
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:24,704
l can't get this joint Lit.
That's drug abuse.

167
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:28,742
Things are nuts down here
without you squawking that up.

168
00:14:30,616 --> 00:14:32,277
Maurice?

169
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:34,813
Bill?

170
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,899
Hey...buddy.

171
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:54,737
How Long you been
Locked in here?

172
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:01,877
Want my burger?

173
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:13,852
Damn, you were hungry.

174
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:30,874
You want us to move in here?

175
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,810
That's the only way we'll get
the place fixed in time.

176
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,073
Yeah, right.

177
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:36,707
And whichever of us
is alive by the end of week...

178
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,411
inherits all
of Vincent Price's cash.

179
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:43,183
You want to play college radio,
high school reunions...

180
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:46,248
and some fooI's club once a week
for the rest of your Lives...

181
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,590
that's cool,
but I think we can do better.

182
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:51,028
l put everything I got
into this...

183
00:15:51,063 --> 00:15:52,963
because I believe
we can make it happen.

184
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:55,058
We move in. We take shifts.

185
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:58,093
Enough with
the motivational speech.

186
00:15:58,137 --> 00:15:59,764

187
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,170

He has a good track record,
so just go with him.

189
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:06,272
Fine. Mars needs
a Little bit of Venus.

190
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:07,836
Lf I'm going to sleep
in a spook house...

more scared than me.

192
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,874
Speaking of which...

193
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,782
Why would you say that
about my sister, man?

194
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:15,787
-Oh, shit.
-Look who I found.

195
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:17,083
What? Tia.

196
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:18,420
That's the nastiest dog
l ever seen.

197
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:20,789
He's not as ugly
as some people I know.

198
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:23,420
Anyway, I'm naming him Bones.

199
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:24,952
Bones?

200
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:27,898
Let's go get the stuff
we need and bring it back.

201
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,400
-Shotgun.
-Shotgun.

202
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,596
-l said it first.
-No, you hear things Late.

203
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,036
By the way...

204
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:34,972
Dad does know about this, right?

205
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:36,770
Are you kidding?

206
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:40,137

208
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:46,275

214
00:16:55,394 --> 00:16:58,795

215
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:00,162
Shoot the dog?

216

218
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:05,226

Tia, put him in the back.

220
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,372
Don't feed that dog!

221
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:12,309
What the hell's wrong

222
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:14,108
Some holes can't be filled...

223
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:15,977
and some hunger
can't be satisfied.

224
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:17,710
Some people need to stagger
their medication.

225
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,651
I'm serious!
He'll only get hungrier.

226
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:22,551

We know that.
We respect that.

309
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,399
That's why we didn't do shit.

310
00:20:56,435 --> 00:21:00,769
You didn't Ginsu them punks
and steal their ride?

311
00:21:00,806 --> 00:21:03,832
Steal their ride.
That's all we did.

00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,036
That's all we did.

313
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:07,443

You're just

Dad is going to kick ass.

329
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,844
He doesn't Like dogs in
the house in the first place.

330

Why'd you Let her bring it in

it's going to take.

359
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:54,314
We can move out of this dump,
hit the big time--

360
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:57,584
big houses,
Legitimate business, the works.

361
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,750
That's your dream, not mine.

362
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,919
l don't ever want
to Leave this street.

363
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,723
Never.

364
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:06,731
Status quo is totally
cool with me, baby.

365
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:08,426
l hear you, Jimmy.
I'm with you, baby.

366
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:09,900
-Be good.
-All right, baby.

367
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,334
l hear you, Jimmy.

368
00:23:15,374 --> 00:23:17,865
You got all the status...

369
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,038
and I ain't got nothin'
but the quo.

370
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,674
Officer SLupovich...

371
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:25,843
aka Loopy Lou.

372
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:27,875
It's not your styLe...

373
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,821
is it, Eddie Mack...

374
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:32,721
killing off
your customers?

375
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:35,090
l ain't killed nobody.

376
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:39,792
You want me to rack 'em up?
PLay a game?

377
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:42,733
Too bad.
No time to play today.

378
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:44,929
Got your tip.

379
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,598
Confiscated the whole stash.

380
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:59,440
That's fair enough...
for the shit.

381
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,853
Don't you think I deserve
something a Little extra...

382
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:05,789
for knocking out
the competition?

383
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:08,657
Shit, you was just doing
your motherfuckin' job.

384
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:11,356
The Last thing you need...

385
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:14,923
is for me to start doing
my fucking job.

386
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:22,172
Give that motherfucker
his money.

387
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:30,477
That's more Like it.

388
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:32,575
That's the cost of
doing business.

389
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:35,678
Maybe you can deduct it
on your taxes.

390
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:37,518
Fuck you.

391
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:41,356
What's up with Jeremiah
selling that building?

392
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:44,257
What?

393
00:24:46,498 --> 00:24:48,864
That's ridiculous, Patrick.

394
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:51,768
So how exactly did crack
get in the ghetto, Pop?

395
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:54,602
By magic?
How did it fly in there?

396
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,438
Like the man said,
we don't own that many planes.

397
00:24:57,476 --> 00:24:59,944
Stop poisoning your mind
with that ghetto paranoia.

398
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:03,209
That's the ways of people
justifying their own failure.

399
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:05,307
No, no, no, Dad.

400
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,783
The man has been Lying to us
for a hundred years.

401
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:08,081
Thank you.

402
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,714
I'm still waiting for
my 40 acres and a mule.

403
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:14,522
You wouldn't know a mule
if one bit you in the ass.

404
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,528
Personally, I don't need a mule.

405
00:25:16,562 --> 00:25:18,189
I've got myself a Lexus.

406
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,357
And nobody gave it to me.

407
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:22,893
PLease, Pops--

408
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:25,733
I'd Like to see the news,
please.

409
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:27,500
...in the strange
disappearance...

410
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,007
of those two State College
fraternity brothers.

411
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:33,011
Now, Patrick, I'm telling--

412
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:34,012
SLick.

413
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:35,343
What is that?
What's that all about?

414
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,644
-Nothin'.
-What were you gonna say?

415
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:39,412
Some terrible shit, Pops.

416
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:40,918
Better watch your mouth, boy.

417
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:45,256
Those boys had no business
messing around down there.

418
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,917
You go places where
you're not meant to be...

419
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,153
and that's what you get.

420
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:49,990
Lsn't that your old hood, Pops?

421
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:51,689
Yes, that's my old hood...

422
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,755
and it took some doing
to get out of there.

423
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,323
You just be glad that I did...

424
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:57,699
so you can start your Life
here instead of down there.

425
00:25:57,736 --> 00:26:00,068
Shouldn't we
maybe be down there?

426
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:01,902
Doing something about it,
making it better?

427
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,373
It can't be done, Patrick!

428
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:06,639
That place has already
died and gone to hell.

429
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,078
Want me to get that, honey?

430
00:26:09,114 --> 00:26:12,606
No, I'll get it.

431
00:26:14,987 --> 00:26:18,013
Al Lupovich.
Long time no see.

432
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:21,753
I'll be just a second, honey.

433
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:25,062
What the fuck do you want?

434
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:27,793
Wanted to visit
with my old pal J-Bird.

435
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:28,800
Don't call me that.

436
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,199
That's quite a brood
you got there.

437
00:26:30,235 --> 00:26:33,068
A regular Rainbow Coalition.

438
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:34,470
What the hell do you want,
Lupovich?

439
00:26:34,506 --> 00:26:37,134
You sold the building.

440
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:38,642
What building?

441
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:41,612
Don't shit a shitter.
Our building!

442
00:26:41,647 --> 00:26:43,945
You were supposed to sit on it,
not sell it.

443
00:26:43,982 --> 00:26:45,108
l didn't sell it.

444
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,414
Somebody bought it,
so somebody sold it.

445
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:49,079
Not my problem.

446
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:50,611
That's a bozo no-no, J-Bird.

447
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:53,090
Even if they find anything,
it's been 20 years.

448
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,025
They could never
trace it back to us.

449
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,359
You better hope not,
'cause it's Like they say...

450
00:26:58,397 --> 00:27:00,490
four can keep a secret
if three are dead.

451
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:02,466
Daddy?

452
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,594
Hey, Tia.
I'm just talking to a friend.

453
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:05,830
I'll be right in.

454
00:27:05,871 --> 00:27:08,237
Nice rack.

455
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:11,436
How old is she?
Does she...you know?

456
00:27:11,476 --> 00:27:12,943
That's my daughter, Lupovich.

457
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:14,946
Get the fuck off my property.

458
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,778
Your daughter.
Nice to see you.

459
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:20,910
You fat bastard.
Son of a bitch.

460
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:25,584
Got it. And twist.

461
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:27,683
l don't know what we're gonna
do with this place, boy.

462
00:27:27,726 --> 00:27:31,594
It's all good.
It's ugly, but it's home.

463
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:46,169
You know that's bad Luck, right?

464
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:48,406
That place is bad Luck.

465
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:49,607
Why's that?

466
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:51,809
l don't know.
It goes way back.

467
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:54,751
Or so my mother says.

468
00:27:54,786 --> 00:27:58,017
What else does your mama say?

469
00:27:58,056 --> 00:28:00,115
You know, nothin' much.

470
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:02,456
Lf I told you,
you'd think she was crazy.

471
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:05,622
And one thing
my mother is not is crazy.

472
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:07,632
OK. So?

473
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:10,032
All right.

474
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:12,002
l can't believe
I'm telling you this.

475
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:15,006
My mother says
that every house is two houses.

476
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,507
Every street, two streets.

477
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,701
Two's good.

478
00:28:17,743 --> 00:28:22,146
There's a whole city,
a whole world...

479
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,344
kind of beside, on top...

480
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,586
just below...

481
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:32,214
the city of the dead.

482
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:35,693
There's this invisible wall...

483
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:37,820
a fabric that keeps
things separate.

484
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:39,023
Lucky thing.

485
00:28:39,064 --> 00:28:43,433
Sure is, but when
something bad happens...

486
00:28:43,468 --> 00:28:47,461
something really bad...

487
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:50,600
the wall breaks, tears.

488
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:52,269
And the dead get out?

489
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:56,076
Or the Living fall in.
Who knows?

490
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:57,672
And you believe it?

491
00:28:57,716 --> 00:29:00,276
Lf I did, do you think...

492
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:03,014
I'd come within
50 yards of your door?

493
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:38,640
Get out!

494
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:46,958
Y'all better stop
messin' around!

495
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:51,659
Go, boy!

496
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:54,221
What the fuck!

497
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:55,995
Freak!

498
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:59,900
What's the matter, bro?

499
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:02,498
Are you spooked?

500
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:07,769
Maybe just a Little,
all right?

501
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:11,373
l know. There is kind of
a strange vibe up in here.

502
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:14,180
Make yourself comfortable
around the circle.

503
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:18,747
We will begin in just a moment.

504
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:28,590
You gonna join us?

505
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:31,568
Can't. Gotta finish
this for school.

506
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:34,094
God gave you the vision.

507
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:37,540
l hate to see you waste it
on painting pretty pictures.

508
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:39,635
You got your vision
and I got mine...

509
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:42,374
and I won't waste mine
Like you did.

510
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:46,911
Sorry, Mama. Maybe next time?

511
00:31:46,952 --> 00:31:48,920
l don't want you to go
to that house anymore...

512
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:52,446
and I want you to stay away
from those kids and that dog.

513
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,754
That dog is a servant of evil.

514
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,522
Ever been inside?

515
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:59,189
Yeah, back in the day.

516
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:01,131
Before it became what it is.

517
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,929
And what's that?

518
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:05,630
It's a bad place...

519
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,070
and a door to worse.

520
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,259
l gots to T.C.B. tonight...

521
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:37,097
so I should be through
about 7:00.

522
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:38,363
Come see me.

523
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:40,769
Can't I get there early
and give you some good Luck?

524
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:42,466
No, baby. You know
l don't need no Luck.

525
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:43,804
I'm just Letting them
have their say...

526
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:45,503
before I tell them no.

527
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:46,942
All right,
Let me see your hands.

528
00:32:46,978 --> 00:32:49,276
Come on,
Let me see your hands.

529
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:51,578
-Come on, baby.
-PLease?

530
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:54,346
All that readin',
advisin', shiny mess...

531
00:32:54,386 --> 00:32:55,614
that was your mama's bag.

532
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:58,521
It was my mama's bag
and her grandmama...

533
00:32:58,556 --> 00:33:00,683
and a Long Line of mamas
before her.

534
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:03,489
Sounds Like Mama needs
a brand-new bag.

535
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:05,758
Let me see your hands.
PLease?

536
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:09,563
Your Left hand is the past...

537
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:12,900
your right hand
is the present and the future.

538
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:16,839
This is your Life Line,
and this--

539
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:24,039
Jimmy, there's a Line across
your Life Line.

540
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:27,142
Must be my clothesline.

541
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:28,482
Maybe my phone Line.

542
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,454
Jimmy, I'm serious!

543
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:33,855
Cancel the meeting.
Don't go. Stay with me.

544
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:35,792
Don't you worry
about nothin', baby.

545
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:39,126
These hands will be
stroking your neck tonight.

546
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:41,189
Jimmy, please!

547
00:33:41,232 --> 00:33:42,859
Pearl, trust me.

548
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,773
Thought you might be
needing some help.

549
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:42,244
Look at this, man.
It Looks Like blood.

550
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:46,223
The floor's throbbing.

551
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,485
Aw, snap.

552
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:48,958
It feels Like a heartbeat.

553
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:51,018
It's just a problem
in the plumbing.

554
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,462
You're probably right...

555
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:55,125
but I'm gonna check it out...

556
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:56,724
and y'all are coming with me.

557
00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:58,292
Come on.

558
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,930
-Whoa!
-Damn!

559
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:03,167
What is this?
Look at this, man!

560
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,039
Maurice,
what you think that is?

561
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:07,442
It's rust. Rust never sleeps.

562
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,844
You call that rust?

563
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,543
Now where does this go, huh?

564
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:14,017
Don't ask me.

565
00:36:14,052 --> 00:36:15,849
Now what?

566
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:20,652
Eat that spinach, boy.

567
00:36:20,692 --> 00:36:23,160
-There you go.
-You got it.

568
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:26,254
I'm not going down there.

569
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:28,492
Go ahead, Tia.
I'm right behind you.

570
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:31,593
Don't get behind me.

571
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:34,964
Just some flies. Come on.

572
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:37,497
What is that smell?

573
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:38,531
What'd you expect, Cynthia?

574
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:39,634
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

575
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:40,837
FLies, there's shit!

576
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,245
Disgusting!

577
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,620
Space that's so perfect
for a recording studio?

578
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,388
Maurice, not now.
Just shut up, man.

579
00:36:56,427 --> 00:36:58,019
He got a point, though.

580
00:36:58,062 --> 00:36:59,927
It'll just take a Little more
work than I thought.

581
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:03,559
Think about it.
Put down a real floor.

582
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,091
Put some dampening
on the wall...

583
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,297
we'll have
totally controlled sound.

584
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:08,805
It'll be perfect.

585
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,741
We'll make our first record
where no one can hear us scream.

586
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:14,404
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

587
00:37:14,445 --> 00:37:16,470
Oh, my God!

588
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:21,712
Oh, shit.

589
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,780
Give me some Light.

590
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:31,360
Hello. Who are you?

591
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:34,331
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

592
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:37,027
I'd Like you to meet
Jimmy Bones.

593
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:38,262
What are you talking about?

594
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:41,932
"This is the story
of Jimmy Bones...

595
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:45,033
"black as night
and hard as stone.

596
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:47,135
"Gold-plated deuce
Like the king of Siam...

597
00:37:47,178 --> 00:37:50,875
"got a switchblade Loose
and a diamond on his hand."

598
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:53,110
There's the switchblade
and the diamond, man.

599
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:54,880
You telling me
this could be him?

600
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:58,480
Damn. It's so fresh.

601
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:00,582
Put that thing down!
What are you doing?

602
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:02,991
You can't take that.
It might be evidence!

603
00:38:03,027 --> 00:38:04,324
Evidence of what?

604
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:07,126
Patrick, doesn't it seem
a Little odd to you...

605
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:09,929
that he'd stab himself
in the chest and bury himself?

606
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:11,458
l agree.

607
00:38:13,271 --> 00:38:15,000
Bones, settle down!

608
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,768
Do something about the dog.

609
00:38:16,808 --> 00:38:19,140
What we have to do
is call the police.

610
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:23,204
For someone so cute,
you're so stupid sometimes.

611
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:25,238
Call the police,
we don't get a permit.

612
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:27,615
We can't just Leave him,
can we?

613
00:38:27,652 --> 00:38:29,017
-Yes, we can.
-What?!

614
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:30,680
He ain't goin' nowhere.

615
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:33,122
We will deal with this
after the weekend.

616
00:38:33,157 --> 00:38:36,285
-Let's go!
-Fuck it, whatever!

617
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:38,761
You put your fingers
all over it!

618
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:40,593
Maurice,
I'll Leave you down here.

619
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:43,157
I'm coming!

620
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:50,000
Cyn?

621
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,235
What?

622
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:52,799
You all right?

623
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:55,108
Yeah.

624
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:57,706
Come on. Let's go.

625
00:38:57,749 --> 00:38:59,148
Patrick, what up?

626
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:01,378
I'm coming.

627
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:03,819
-Come on.
-I'm coming.

628
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:22,998
l guess
he won't be needing this.

629
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,845
Or this.

630
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:12,120
Well, you know
she doesn't want me here.

631
00:40:12,156 --> 00:40:16,354
With you...in this house.

632
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:18,555
Whatever.

633
00:40:18,596 --> 00:40:20,564
It's true.
She doesn't trust you...

634
00:40:20,598 --> 00:40:21,565
and neither do L.

635
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,396
l can handle your mother.

636
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:26,733
-No, you can't.
-Yes, I can.

637
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,170
She will Love me, watch.

638
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:30,299
No, she won't. Trust me.

639
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:33,242
See, but the X-factor
is your daddy.

640
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:35,336
l don't know nothin'
about him.

641
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:37,813
Neither do L.

642
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,317
l never met him.

643
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:44,617
She won't talk about him.
Ever.

644
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:46,953
Wow. I'm sorry.

645
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:50,427
Don't be. It's OK.
I'm not sad about it.

646
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:52,554
It's Life, you know?

647
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:57,091
I've never known him,
so it's totally normal to me.

648
00:41:04,142 --> 00:41:06,337
I'm not doing too well
with this.

649
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:08,709
Yeah, you are.

650
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:07,694
Patrick, stop.

651
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:09,467
What?

652
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:11,532
l can't.

653
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:14,545
All right.

654
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,740
Do you want me to take you home?

655
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:19,841
No. I want to stay
with you guys--

656
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:21,943
No, no, no.

657
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:23,578
You don't have to explain.
l understand.

658
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:26,317
I'll go sleep with the guys.

659
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,688
Thank you.

660
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:30,785
You're welcome.

661
00:42:35,733 --> 00:42:36,722
'Night.

662
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,662
Welcome...

663
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:43,936
my brothers and my sisters.

664
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:47,638
We will begin with our hymn.

665
00:42:56,654 --> 00:43:04,117
The spirit world is
all around us at this moment...

666
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:10,259
and the dearly departed
are here...

667
00:43:10,301 --> 00:43:15,432
among us,
pressing around us.

668
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:40,263
It's OK. You can stay.

669
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:42,391
But no getting fresh.

670
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:48,737
This is nice.

671
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:51,105
There is a spirit among us.

672
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:55,635
Who has just joined our circle?

673
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,547
Lordy, what is that smell?

674
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:06,117
Stop. Patrick, cut it out.

675
00:44:06,157 --> 00:44:08,557
Does someone
want to send a message?

676
00:44:10,194 --> 00:44:14,631
Knock once for yes
and twice for no.

677
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:17,634
Ls it someone in our circle?

678
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,434
Stop.

679
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:22,871
Ls it Miss Lillian?

680
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:25,000
Cut it out.

681
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:27,840
Ls the message
for Miss Abernathy?

682
00:44:27,878 --> 00:44:29,311
Patrick, stop.

683
00:44:29,347 --> 00:44:32,180
Ls the message for me?

684
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:44,688
Patrick, stop! Stop!

685
00:44:57,174 --> 00:45:01,110
No! Jimmy! No!

686
00:45:37,982 --> 00:45:40,610
Patrick, stop!

687
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:48,715
What's wrong?

688
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:52,829
That sounds Like your mom.

689
00:45:57,101 --> 00:45:59,934
Open up this door!

690
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,403
What the hell are you doing?

691
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:03,270
Where's my daughter?
l want to see her now!

692
00:46:03,307 --> 00:46:05,798
You hold on a moment,
I'll go upstairs--

693
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:08,311
Come on out here!
l know she's in there!

694
00:46:08,345 --> 00:46:11,712
Cynthia!
Oh, God! Come on, baby.

695
00:46:11,749 --> 00:46:13,239
It'll be OK.
We're gonna get outta here.

696
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:15,479
Come on.

697
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:18,113
Lf you stay in this house
one more night...

698
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:20,680
you might as well
be sleeping in your grave!

699
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:21,782
Come on.

700
00:46:25,463 --> 00:46:29,092
You certainly have
a way with women, Patrick.

701
00:46:38,442 --> 00:46:41,036
Well, we're in business.

702
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:42,272
What?

703
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:45,749
Where we going?
You know I hate surprises.

704
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:47,683
It's a Little business venture
l made on my own...

705
00:46:47,718 --> 00:46:49,015
l wanted to show you.

706
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:50,611
l think you will approve.

707
00:46:50,654 --> 00:46:52,417
l hope so.

708
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:54,981
l hope so.

709
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:03,098
What are we doing down here?

710
00:47:03,134 --> 00:47:04,431
Like you always said...

711
00:47:04,468 --> 00:47:07,335
we need to Look for
the undervalued.

712
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:09,236
It don't get no more
undervalued than this.

713
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:13,768
Come on, Pop. Just come on.

714
00:47:16,013 --> 00:47:19,540
Bet you didn't know
your company owned this place.

715
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:23,542
l went through a broker,
so you didn't know it was me...

716
00:47:23,587 --> 00:47:25,214
but I couldn't wait
to see your face...

717
00:47:25,256 --> 00:47:28,157
when you saw
how I fixed it up.

718
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:29,955
Look at this.

719
00:47:32,229 --> 00:47:34,356
Son, is this
some kind of sick joke?

720
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:36,457
No! Look, Pop.

721
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,764
You Listen to me, boy.

722
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:40,736
l didn't work
all of my goddamn Life...

723
00:47:40,771 --> 00:47:41,897
to get out of
this neighborhood...

724
00:47:41,939 --> 00:47:43,372
for you to move
right back in it!

725
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:45,432
l thought you'd be proud of me.

726
00:47:45,476 --> 00:47:47,569
I'm just trying
to do what you did--

727
00:47:47,611 --> 00:47:50,671
take nothing and
make something out of it.

728
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:52,909
Nobody will ever
come down here, son.

729
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:56,283
Look at this
fucking neighborhood!

730
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,687
Son...shut it down.

731
00:47:59,723 --> 00:48:02,920
Shut it down.
The company will buy it back.

732
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,225
No. Not this time, Pop.

733
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:10,700
l did this on my own,
and we will open tonight!

734
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:13,828
Bullshit!
That is bullshit!

735
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:16,271
Sell it back!
That is a fucking order!

736
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:18,741
Do you fucking hear me?!

737
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:21,802
Shut it!
You shut it, god damn it!

738
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:24,245
Shut it down
and sell this fucker!

739
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:25,873
Shut it, Patrick--

740
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:36,850
What's goin' on, baby?

741
00:48:57,915 --> 00:48:59,644
Jimmy's into it, man.

742
00:48:59,683 --> 00:49:02,709
That's what I'm saying.
Just wait.

743
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:04,744
Jimmy, what's happening, baby?

744
00:49:04,788 --> 00:49:05,777
Good to see you.

745
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:06,812
You remember Eddie Mack,
don't you?

746
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:08,017
We met.

747
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:12,620
We did the afterschool
b-ball thing at Kenwood.

748
00:49:12,663 --> 00:49:13,891
What it is, homeboy?

749
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:15,330
What it will be.

750
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:18,733
Jimmy, you know
Officer Lupovich, right?

751
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:19,793
I've heard of him.

752
00:49:19,837 --> 00:49:22,965
Man, you got a nice crib here.

753
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:25,498
It's nice to see
a black man doing so well.

754
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:27,635
Everybody's happy.
We do all right.

755
00:49:27,678 --> 00:49:29,669
But things change.

756
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:30,907
You gotta think ahead.

757
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:33,917
Got them Lotteries
all over now, Bonesy.

758
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:38,913
Starting here, too.
Maybe next year.

759
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:41,982
Yeah, Jimmy.
A Lot of our old customers...

760
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:43,653
are getting their new people
across the state Lines...

761
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:45,127
buying those Lotto tickets.

762
00:49:45,162 --> 00:49:47,255
We need to get
on this thing fast.

763
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:50,131
What do anybody want with
them damn Lottery tickets?

764
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,328
What else, youngblood?
Money.

765
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:54,667
No, man.
It ain't the money.

766
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:56,502
It's the high.

767
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,441
The big fat floating
"What if?"

768
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:02,206
Dig, it's way
more profitable, man.

769
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:05,579
Nobody ever wins,
so you never pay out.

770
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:08,346
But a $2 bet is cheaper
than a $20 bag.

771
00:50:08,385 --> 00:50:11,320
l can dig that,
but I'm not talking horse.

772
00:50:11,355 --> 00:50:14,256
I'm talking
a $5 kick in the head...

773
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:16,418
that's a quick ticket
to heaven, man.

774
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,950
And fools keep coming back.

775
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:19,462
All right, baby.

776
00:50:19,496 --> 00:50:22,056
Those fools?

777
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:23,623
They're my people.

778
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:26,329
l can dig that, man,
but it ain't no thing.

779
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:30,864
It's a poor man's freebase.
Check it out.

780
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:42,715
l ain't interested,
and if you gonna sell it...

781
00:50:42,753 --> 00:50:43,981
don't sell it around here.

782
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:45,921
Man, here, just try it.

783
00:50:45,956 --> 00:50:46,923
l said, no, thanks.

784
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:49,289
-Man, try this!
-Hey, Huggybear!

785
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:51,385
l done drove all this way, man!

786
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:53,555
Hey! Back off.

787
00:50:58,235 --> 00:50:59,896
Sit down!

788
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:03,373
That's cool.
I'm copastetic.

789
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:06,137
But it's Like this here, man.

790
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:07,939
It's the wave comin', man.

791
00:51:07,978 --> 00:51:11,914
A big-ass, Krakatoa,
east of Java wave.

792
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:13,917
Either you gonna be on top...

793
00:51:13,951 --> 00:51:16,419
up here in
chocolate heaven...

794
00:51:16,453 --> 00:51:19,513
or you'll get caught up
in the muddy undertow.

795
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:20,784
And that's real.

796
00:51:20,824 --> 00:51:22,086
That's beautiful, baby.

797
00:51:22,126 --> 00:51:25,357
Totally widescreen
sci-fi forward thinking...

798
00:51:25,396 --> 00:51:26,761
and I can dig that...

799
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:28,287
but that's for you and yours.

800
00:51:28,332 --> 00:51:29,799
Me and mines...

801
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,358
we cool as a motherfuckin'
icicle in the freezer.

802
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:35,497
By the way,
your 12 1/2 minutes is up.

803
00:51:35,539 --> 00:51:37,507
Sorry about that, J-Bird.

804
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:38,906
It's never business,
it's always pleasure.

805
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:40,136
It's cool, Jimmy.

806
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:42,839
Did you see this motherfucker?

807
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,869
No, no, no.

808
00:51:43,914 --> 00:51:44,881
Fuck it.

809
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:46,883
-Hey, Jimmy, Look.
-Yeah, baby?

810
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:48,145
Just hear me out
on this one.

811
00:51:48,185 --> 00:51:51,086
Pass up the money train
and jump his ass on the bus.

812
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:52,816
His Loss.

813
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:54,483
Hear me out on this.

814
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:56,755

Everybody just be cool.

Be cool, man.

822
00:52:08,772 --> 00:52:12,765
Jimmy, man, just hear it out.

823
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:14,505
Just hear out the deal.

824
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:16,445
l don't need to hear no deal.

825
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,607
l don't need no new partners...

826
00:52:18,649 --> 00:52:20,412

00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:22,385
and I damn sure don't need
this cracker's...

828
00:52:22,419 --> 00:52:24,080

Just try it. That's all.

830
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:28,517
You heard the man.

831
00:52:29,793 --> 00:52:31,488
Try it.

832
00:52:41,371 --> 00:52:43,362
All right, baby, that's good.

833
00:52:43,407 --> 00:52:45,466
Heat it up!

834
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:49,505

835
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:53,607
Just Let it kick in, baby.

Everybody Leaves a print.

852
00:53:46,036 --> 00:53:48,334
We hang together,
or we hang separately.

853
00:53:48,372 --> 00:53:51,603
Now cut him and cut him good.

854
00:53:58,048 --> 00:54:01,950
What it is, homeboy.

855
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:04,647
What it will be, nigger.

856
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:11,627
Now you.

I'm sorry, brother.

860
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:22,705
Since we was grasshoppers.

861
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:26,937
Like you said.
Every man for himself, baby.

862
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:35,809
Hey, Shaft, it's your turn.

863
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:43,048
Hey, don't even think about it.

864
00:54:43,093 --> 00:54:45,061
Man, hurry up!

865
00:54:53,303 --> 00:54:57,239
OK, mama, it's your turn.

866
00:54:57,274 --> 00:55:00,971
l won't do it.

867
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:05,038
Either you cut him...

868
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:07,016
or die with him.

Come on, move!
Get him out of here.

873
00:55:39,483 --> 00:55:42,475

Damn!

875
00:56:58,528 --> 00:57:00,359
Does your mama know
that you're here?

876
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:04,865
What my mama don't know
won't hurt her.

Yo, bro!

01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:59,478
is that what
you really wanna know?

1066
01:17:59,521 --> 01:18:01,284
How the fuck I got in here?

1067
01:18:01,323 --> 01:18:02,551
Oh, my God, Jimmy.

1068
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:03,751
Dad!

1069
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:10,728
What the hell
are you guys doing?

1070
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:11,926
Somebody please tell me--

1071
01:18:30,519 --> 01:18:32,316
Yeah, right.

1072
01:18:32,354 --> 01:18:33,981
It makes me feel better.

1073
01:18:35,891 --> 01:18:37,859
Where are you going?
l just called 911.

1074
01:18:37,893 --> 01:18:40,623
Then we really gotta go,
'cause I can't explain this.

1075
01:18:40,662 --> 01:18:42,562
I'll be back,
hopefully with Dad.

1076
01:18:42,598 --> 01:18:43,997
-We're coming with you.
-No, you're not.

1077
01:18:44,033 --> 01:18:45,898
You gotta stay with Mom !

1078
01:18:51,373 --> 01:18:54,672
Jesus fucking Christ,
what is this place? Oh, my God!

1079
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:56,109
Shut the fuck up.

1080
01:18:56,145 --> 01:18:58,841
You two bitches were just meat.

1081
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:01,611
You never had any idea smarter
than getting yourselves...

1082
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:03,447
a Little bit more.

1083
01:19:03,485 --> 01:19:07,148
But my brother J-Bird, here,
this nigger was smart.

1084
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:08,588
He didn't just want more.

1085
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:11,593
He wanted more
with compound interest.

1086
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:13,458
Come on, Jimmy. PLease, man.

1087
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:15,929
-Get Lou.
-Get him.

1088
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:17,955
Get that fucker.

1089
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,661
Bye, Loopy Lou!

1090
01:19:25,207 --> 01:19:28,370
-It's the blood.
-What, Mama?

1091
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:29,570
Remember when I told you
that a person...

1092
01:19:29,611 --> 01:19:32,011
has more than two parts,
they have three?

1093
01:19:32,047 --> 01:19:33,571
Body, soul, and spirit?

1094
01:19:33,615 --> 01:19:35,446
The spirit
Lives in the blood...

1095
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:37,611
and the spirit keeps
the body and soul together...

1096
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:40,747
and sometimes
the spirit Lives on.

1097
01:19:40,789 --> 01:19:43,485
Jimmy's blood
must still be in that building.

1098
01:19:49,898 --> 01:19:52,025
Let's go.

1099
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:56,094
Look here, Jimmy.
l got $20,000 saved up, buried.

1100
01:19:56,138 --> 01:19:58,038
Don't nobody know
where it is but me.

1101
01:19:58,073 --> 01:19:59,506
You can have half of it.

1102
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:01,634
All right.
You can have it all, man.

1103
01:20:01,677 --> 01:20:03,008
Come on, man.

1104
01:20:03,045 --> 01:20:04,444
l really don't--

1105
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,449
Jimmy! Jimmy!
Come on, man, Jimmy!

1106
01:20:11,854 --> 01:20:14,846
And now, J-Bird, my brother...

1107
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:17,484
it's time for you
to collect your interest.

1108
01:20:17,526 --> 01:20:18,686
This is it.

1109
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:24,555
We found that skeleton
right down here.

1110
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:31,499
All right, it was here.
Right here!

1111
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:33,132
-What'd he have on?
-Nothin'.

1112
01:20:33,175 --> 01:20:35,143
No, wait,
there was a green rag.

1113
01:20:35,177 --> 01:20:37,202
My god, my dress.

1114
01:20:37,246 --> 01:20:39,237
My bloody dress.
We gotta burn it.

1115
01:20:39,281 --> 01:20:41,476
We gotta close the door.
Find my dress!

1116
01:20:41,517 --> 01:20:42,848
The blood on the dress
is keeping him alive!

1117
01:20:42,885 --> 01:20:45,683
-l couldn't find anything!
-Look for it!

1118
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:47,712
You was my main man.

1119
01:20:47,756 --> 01:20:50,350
Since we was grasshoppers.

1120
01:20:50,392 --> 01:20:52,383
l always Looked after you.

1121
01:20:52,427 --> 01:20:56,693
You had a piece
of everything I had.

1122
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:58,996
l didn't want
a piece of yours, Jimmy.

1123
01:21:00,435 --> 01:21:01,766
l wanted my own.

1124
01:21:01,803 --> 01:21:04,033
And fuck everybody else, huh?

1125
01:21:09,678 --> 01:21:12,875
God damn, Jimmy!
Think about it, Jimmy.

1126
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:15,179
Lf it had happened to you...

1127
01:21:15,217 --> 01:21:17,412
you would've done
the same goddamn thing, man.

1128
01:21:17,452 --> 01:21:18,680
Nah, brother.

1129
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,416
l wouldn't have done
any manner of what you did.

1130
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:42,501
It's a trip, ain't it?

1131
01:21:42,544 --> 01:21:45,342
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

1132
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:47,507
-Baby, you OK?
-She's all right.

1133
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:51,542
-Be careful!
-Oh, hell, no!

1134
01:21:51,587 --> 01:21:53,418
Bill, slow down! Be careful.

1135
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:55,150
Don't get hurt. Be careful.

1136
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:18,378
Oh, shit.

1137
01:22:24,286 --> 01:22:25,446
Watch your step.

1138
01:22:30,392 --> 01:22:31,586
Stay back.

1139
01:22:40,435 --> 01:22:42,630
Come back!

1140
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:44,434
Find Jeremiah!

1141
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:48,499
Mama, come back!

1142
01:22:51,947 --> 01:22:54,575
Tell me, Jimmy.
What will it take, huh?

1143
01:22:54,616 --> 01:22:58,108
What do you want?
Just tell me, Jimmy!

1144
01:22:58,153 --> 01:23:00,053
Oh, man, that's easy.

1145
01:23:00,088 --> 01:23:01,988
Think you can give me
my Life back?

1146
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:03,651
Can you swing that, brother?

1147
01:23:03,692 --> 01:23:05,455
You know I can't do that!

1148
01:23:05,494 --> 01:23:07,155
You're fuckin' dead!

1149
01:23:12,134 --> 01:23:15,535
Dog eat dog, brother.
Dog eat dog.

1150
01:23:35,123 --> 01:23:37,114
-We can climb out.
-Where?

1151
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:39,855
Anywhere but here.
Come on, man. Let's go.

1152
01:24:11,893 --> 01:24:13,155
Turn around, baby.

1153
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:19,758
You know I always Loved you
in this dress.

1154
01:24:37,285 --> 01:24:39,219
Oh, damn.

1155
01:24:39,254 --> 01:24:41,347
Come on, give me your hand.

1156
01:24:43,425 --> 01:24:45,723
Look out. You cool?
All right.

1157
01:24:49,931 --> 01:24:51,262
Did he create all this?

1158
01:24:51,299 --> 01:24:55,201
No, but he's a part of it.

1159
01:24:55,237 --> 01:24:59,640
This is...
the city of the dead.

1160
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:07,381
We just have to remember
what was here and follow it.

1161
01:25:07,416 --> 01:25:09,680
Those stairs should take us
to the second floor.

1162
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:23,764
Didn't I tell you, baby?

1163
01:25:23,799 --> 01:25:27,200
Didn't I tell you I'd be
strokin' your neck tonight?

1164
01:25:27,235 --> 01:25:30,261
l took out my revenge
'cause I had to.

1165
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:34,071
Now stay here with me--
forever.

1166
01:25:37,345 --> 01:25:39,245
OK, where do we go now?

1167
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:42,307
Oh, not now.

1168
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,443
Come on!

1169
01:25:47,155 --> 01:25:48,588
Oh, my God.

1170
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:57,127
Bro, where you goin'?

1171
01:25:57,165 --> 01:25:59,258
-Maurice, where you goin'?
-Bill, wait!

1172
01:25:59,301 --> 01:26:00,962
That's not Maurice.

1173
01:26:06,041 --> 01:26:08,100
Where you goin', man?

1174
01:26:13,014 --> 01:26:14,311
Where the hell you at?

1175
01:26:30,265 --> 01:26:31,664
He's gone.

1176
01:26:37,305 --> 01:26:39,136
This way.

1177
01:26:39,174 --> 01:26:43,076
Cynthia, wait.
l gotta find Bill.

1178
01:26:48,283 --> 01:26:50,080
Welcome home, baby girl.

1179
01:26:56,725 --> 01:26:59,353
Cynthia, no. Wait.

1180
01:26:59,394 --> 01:27:01,555
Cyn, wait!

1181
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:24,510
Help me, Patrick, please!

1182
01:27:24,553 --> 01:27:26,111

1183
01:27:26,154 --> 01:27:30,181
PLease, Patrick.

1184
01:27:30,225 --> 01:27:31,692
Oh, no, Dad.

Help me, Patrick!

Help me, Patrick!

1188
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:51,275

1189
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:16,398
Surprise, nigger.

1190

Die!

1191
01:28:23,812 --> 01:28:25,905
Die, motherfucker, die!

1192
01:28:25,947 --> 01:28:27,744
Stop it!

1193
01:28:32,253 --> 01:28:34,517
Stop it, please!

1194
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:43,888
Daddy, Let him go!

1195
01:28:47,469 --> 01:28:49,300
Daddy, stop!

1196
01:28:53,975 --> 01:28:55,499

-All right, we have to jump!

01:29:49,831 --> 01:29:51,731
We have to! Now!

Dog eat dog.
