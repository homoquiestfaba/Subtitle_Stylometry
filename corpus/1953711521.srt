4
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:20,815
That seem to me not the men
King Edward to be.

5
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:28,286
Pirates.

6
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,729
Sir, the men of the king's following us.

7
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:41,463
Maybe half a day behind us.
- We'll have to hurry.

8
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:45,235
I know we do not have time for.
This is not our fight.

9
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:49,300
Those people would return us directly
for the price on our head stands.

10
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,713
You can not blame them because
the king spread nothing but lies about us.

11
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:58,954
If we have thus interfere
We do not guarantee a safe passage more.

12
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:02,961
Then we are never in our refuge
in Scotland.

13
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:04,825
These people are innocent.

14
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:10,804
But the soldiers of the king.
If we slow down they get us for sure.

15
00:05:13,307 --> 00:05:15,333
We must honor our code.

16
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:19,743
If people are in danger,
we must protect them.

17
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,548
Who's coming with me?
- I.

18
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:26,010
You can count on me.

19
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:31,089
I never doubted
my sword ...

20
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,285
countless times to pull
on the shores of distant lands.

21
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:38,330
But mark my words.
The world has turned against us.

22
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:42,998
From the edict of the king
that our order it illegal.

23
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:48,504
This act will give us the same reward
bring as all the other from the past.

24
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:52,971
It will sorrow and destruction
about us calling.

25
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:57,406
I have no problem with that.
So be it.

26
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:05,957
It has not destroyed us, Sigmund.
We are still Fri

27
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:10,529
And we're still together.
Be thankful for.

28
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:12,861
There is no time to lose.

29
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:17,696
Gerald, stay here and look forward
to the warriors of the king.

30
00:06:18,372 --> 00:06:21,568
And the rest ...
Attacks!

31
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:46,522
Becka, get behind me.
Go to your mother.

32
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:19,556
I am sorry
It looked pretty nasty.

33
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:39,709
All the pirates are dead.

34
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,909
And all the villagers are still there.

35
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:46,913
That is not true. They take,
the orphan girl, included.

36
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:51,253
My sister swore order
to protect her.

37
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:56,558
We will need a boat.

38
00:14:02,403 --> 00:14:04,768
Why is it anchored?

39
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:08,839
Where are the pirates?
There is no one on deck.

40
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:12,876
Maybe they're all dead.

41
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:19,210
That we come to know soon enough.
Watch.

42
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:23,320
It could be an ambush.

43
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:58,516
There is nobody on board.

44
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,995
It's good. We'll get you out of here.
- No.

45
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:05,413
It is good girl.
You're safe.

46
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:08,494
I've done something terrible.
- What did you say?

47
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:10,995
You are knights, right?
Soldiers?

48
00:16:11,532 --> 00:16:14,063
Course.
- Then I have you all killed.

49
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:17,135
We're still here, girl.
- Let her explain.

50
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:22,308
I could do nothing else. I thought
there for me no one would come.

51
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:23,966
That all hope was lost.

52
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:29,812
I spoke the curse of Anathol out.

53
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:37,521
All those on board this ship
come and have shed blood ...

54
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,722
are tied to the strength of Anathol
to change in a ...

55
00:16:52,306 --> 00:16:54,637
Stay back.
Protect the girl.

56
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:20,791
And that should have killed.

57
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:25,526
Are you telling me that ...
- Was one of them.

58
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,194
The pirates.

59
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:32,197
You have all the pirates in those samples
changed?

60
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:34,365
Yes.

61
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:37,808
Why are we still not changed?

62
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:41,945
Why not?
- I still have no wings, do you?

63
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:45,850
Why can not we change?
- I do not know.

64
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:47,983
But I do know the curse.

65
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:54,991
All those on board, and blood
have shed into a Gargoyle.

66
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,832
He is changing.
- From this ship.

67
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:08,902
Put him down.

68
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:12,774
Watch his head.

69
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,342
Hold him.

70
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:25,382
Forward.
- You have to help him.

71
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:28,520
I'm sorry, I can not.
- Damn, witch, why not?

72
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:32,220
I just learn how to pronounce the curse,
not know how to undo it.

73
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:35,792
Is there anyone in this town
that can undo the curse?

74
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:48,911
He's gone mad.
- Protect the girl.

75
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:23,859
I told you that it would not
expire if we would enter the village.

76
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:36,670
We need context.

77
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:54,532
Get some context.

78
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:00,563
It's good.
Gerald.

79
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:04,967
He's gone mad.

80
00:23:08,815 --> 00:23:12,846
That's not a man. This is an appearance,
risen from the dead.

81
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:35,974
Even an appearance can not function
without a head.

82
00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:41,403
And what kind of black magic is this?

83
00:23:44,317 --> 00:23:46,615
That girl.
She said something.

84
00:23:47,821 --> 00:23:54,015
It was a curse. One that anger
would generate all of those who are slain.

85
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:56,921
The pirates.

86
00:23:57,063 --> 00:23:59,954
They will rise from the dead.
- In the village.

87
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:18,970
Stay behind me.

88
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:55,252
Where did you get this spell?

89
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:28,183
Where did you get that?

90
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:35,959
You must tell them.
- Of a terrible place.

91
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:38,795
A magician.

92
00:29:39,005 --> 00:29:42,065
An evil lord, which
a land far to the north reigns.

93
00:29:49,148 --> 00:29:51,445
Which wizard?

94
00:29:52,518 --> 00:29:57,478
I can not say his name.
- You must tell them.

95
00:29:58,057 --> 00:29:59,921
He will find me.

96
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:03,561
They say that if you say his name,
he will find you.

97
00:30:06,332 --> 00:30:13,968
Nobody will find you here.
Who is the magician?

98
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,974
I can not say his name.
- You must tell them.

99
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:20,938
He is known as the black dragon.

100
00:30:33,693 --> 00:30:37,060
Why is he not 'Snowball'
or something?

101
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:39,990
That does not sound very impressive,
do you?

102
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,201
Maybe we need you
a nickname, 'Sick mind.

103
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,966
State something here that can help us?

104
00:30:57,717 --> 00:31:01,912
The curse can only be broken
by death.

105
00:31:03,055 --> 00:31:04,979
Let me see that.

106
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:15,833
You're lucky.
There are pictures in.

107
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:20,282
The little witch.
What have they done to us?

108
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:30,110
When we are cursed,
why do not we change?

109
00:31:32,452 --> 00:31:34,477
The curse is a seed of pure evil.

110
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:42,088
If it is located in a bad host,
will grow rapidly.

111
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:49,196
But if it is a good man,
will have difficulty.

112
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:52,961
But in all cases, the outcome
same.

113
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:57,607
Friend or foe,
strong or weak ...

114
00:31:57,643 --> 00:32:00,769
they will all abomination
changing.

115
00:32:00,813 --> 00:32:06,478
This is the curse.
- So why the pirates changed so quickly.

116
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,115
The more bad you are,
the faster you change.

117
00:32:11,657 --> 00:32:16,823
For you, maybe. There must be
a way to undo this.

118
00:32:16,858 --> 00:32:20,822
That goes beyond our power.
- How much time do we have?

119
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,347
That depends on what happens in each
of you guys. The amount of evil.

120
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:29,571
There is no harm in me.

121
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:33,942
That was in Constantinople removed.
Cost me quite a bit too.

122
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,108
And it was not that easy too.
They have the ...

123
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,970
I hope for your sake that's true.

124
00:32:40,052 --> 00:32:44,064
I for one am not going
to wait until I get wings.

125
00:32:45,191 --> 00:32:49,117
Do any of you two person
which can help us to remove the curse?

126
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:54,886
Someone who knows the ancient arts, perhaps?

127
00:32:55,768 --> 00:32:58,366
A druid?

128
00:32:58,671 --> 00:33:01,821
Maybe I know someone
who can help you.

129
00:34:51,784 --> 00:34:56,720
Where did you learn to fight?
- My whole nation can fight.

130
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:00,638
I grew up on a small island
in the northern sea.

131
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,629
We were often attacked
by the Saxons, the Normans.

132
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:08,937
After generations of fighting
Intrusion ...

133
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:11,809
fighting is in our blood.

134
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:16,172
We had to learn to fight
to defend ourselves.

135
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:21,010
A real paradise. I do not
why you would want to leave.

136
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,546
That looks like your homeland, Sigmund.
Only friendly.

137
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:53,402
This is Cavalre?
- Yes.

138
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:56,750
I can not go.

139
00:35:57,283 --> 00:36:01,646
Why not?
- I can not enter this place.

140
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:11,975
Bryce, stay here with the girl.

141
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:38,950
There were only nine.
Now she was only three.

142
00:36:39,592 --> 00:36:44,666
What happened to the others?
- They were arrested by the king ...

143
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:46,860
because she practiced black magic.

144
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:50,764
Some say they are stuck
in the Tower of London.

145
00:36:51,303 --> 00:36:52,792
Why would he do that?

146
00:36:53,638 --> 00:36:56,503
They were soothsayers.
Oracles.

147
00:36:56,908 --> 00:37:00,869
They know the old ways.
- Witches.

148
00:37:01,947 --> 00:37:05,906
They may not seem powerful,
but do not underestimate them.

149
00:37:06,484 --> 00:37:09,709
They could you, in a moment,
change in a small animal.

150
00:37:09,854 --> 00:37:13,487
What do you mean, a little beast?
Is such a thing be?

151
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:16,193
Maybe they change us
into a frog or something.

152
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:19,293
For some of us would
an improvement.

153
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:46,813
Lady.

154
00:38:10,715 --> 00:38:15,950
These men are soldiers,
but not of the king.

155
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:21,316
That's right.

156
00:38:22,794 --> 00:38:27,128
You have been to all countries
and now you are not there.

157
00:38:30,802 --> 00:38:35,739
Those who have protected you,
have to leave you now.

158
00:38:36,274 --> 00:38:37,797
There is something else.

159
00:38:41,046 --> 00:38:44,504
You are bewitched by
verachterlijke magic.

160
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:49,778
They are good.

161
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:56,791
Can you help them?
- There is only one way ...

162
00:38:57,262 --> 00:39:00,390
to remove this curse.

163
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:05,765
I told them.
Is there perhaps another way?

164
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,629
I can not promise that this is true ...

165
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:14,878
but those words
of this curse has written ...

166
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,680
he may perhaps break.
- The black dragon.

167
00:39:20,852 --> 00:39:25,154
We must do something.
- There is one thing that we can try.

168
00:39:26,524 --> 00:39:30,988
Continue.
- But you will suffer the consequences.

169
00:39:32,197 --> 00:39:38,467
There is an old saying that I ... we
can use to remove evil.

170
00:39:39,404 --> 00:39:45,434
But there is a chance that spell
not all will work well.

171
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,039
I will do it.

172
00:39:58,323 --> 00:40:00,713
But how do I know it worked?

173
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:07,121
If it worked,
you are still alive.

174
00:40:09,835 --> 00:40:11,802
No.
- He changes.

175
00:40:16,441 --> 00:40:18,465
Do something.

176
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:24,439
You will see your magic
not use me.

177
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:28,340
I would not change
in any of these samples.

178
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:34,720
Stay away from me.

179
00:42:01,012 --> 00:42:02,706
Is he cured?

180
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:08,375
No.
The magic is too strong.

181
00:42:09,354 --> 00:42:11,321
It's too deep.

182
00:42:13,524 --> 00:42:16,754
It's too deep for me.
I can not break the curse.

183
00:42:48,293 --> 00:42:50,387
There will be taken over by another one.

184
00:43:30,268 --> 00:43:34,329
This is the second of us who changed
almost three.

185
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,736
It starts with a purpose.

186
00:43:40,845 --> 00:43:42,705
But where they fly away?

187
00:43:43,414 --> 00:43:46,474
They are called to him.
Their master.

188
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:52,750
Then we will look for their master.
The owner of this book.

189
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:59,753
That black dragon.
And they will bring us going.

190
00:43:59,897 --> 00:44:01,791
She's just a child.

191
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:04,527
She is strong enough to ship
with pirates to overcome.

192
00:44:07,638 --> 00:44:14,176
The samples will fly to the north.
They feel that it is their master.

193
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:18,345
Once they feel angry,
they will go to him. The black dragon.

194
00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:20,510
Great is that.

195
00:44:20,685 --> 00:44:26,490
A true sporting prey that gargoyles.
One I hit with three arrows.

196
00:44:27,225 --> 00:44:29,117
The delayed disagree.

197
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,251
It takes more than that
to make a killing.

198
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,462
And you're the expert in this field?

199
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:39,200
Do you have already slain?
I do.

200
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:43,601
Long ago, their species
my village.

201
00:44:44,242 --> 00:44:47,640
You must pierce their heart or
their heads chopped off. That's the only way.

202
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:54,581
So, then let's finish the
gargoyles to you and we can leave.

203
00:44:54,685 --> 00:44:58,654
I'm with you, but not
because the gargoyles.

204
00:44:58,689 --> 00:45:05,223
But in order to protect the girl
- A "lady" is enough on this trip.

205
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:08,297
I did not ask permission.

206
00:45:08,332 --> 00:45:12,793
What if you change all
and there is no one to protect her?

207
00:45:14,038 --> 00:45:18,133
Take as is,
I'm with you.

208
00:45:21,112 --> 00:45:26,609
Then it's settled.
We go to the realm of the black dragon.

209
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:58,572
I want to know more about the black dragon.

210
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:03,246
He came to my village
when I was a kid.

211
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:06,117
The people worshiped him
because he could heal the sick.

212
00:46:06,357 --> 00:46:08,891
He healed the lame
with his magic powders.

213
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,688
They wanted him to stay,
so they gave him land.

214
00:46:12,096 --> 00:46:14,027
But his help was a ruse.

215
00:46:14,198 --> 00:46:17,799
He was looking for a particular stone
which would give him more power.

216
00:46:18,002 --> 00:46:22,638
What does that stone then?
- It gives the wearer incredible power.

217
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,805
Power, immortality.
That says it anyway.

218
00:46:27,011 --> 00:46:29,742
Why do they call him the black dragon?

219
00:46:30,448 --> 00:46:33,508
When my people their yoke bore
and rebelled ...

220
00:46:33,684 --> 00:46:36,278
he used the stone
order to summon dragons.

221
00:46:36,387 --> 00:46:39,351
There were seven.
Larger than those gargoyles.

222
00:46:39,457 --> 00:46:44,258
But there is also a huge dragon.
- The black dragon.

223
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:48,292
Yes. It is said that the wizard itself
the black dragon changes.

224
00:46:48,366 --> 00:46:50,664
But anyone who has seen it,
has ever lived to tell.

225
00:46:50,835 --> 00:46:54,202
With the seven dragons and the black dragon
He has my people enslaved.

226
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:58,206
They dig day and night looking
to the stone.

227
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:01,334
Is that the book Grim Noire
of the wizard?

228
00:47:03,514 --> 00:47:07,614
Yes.
- And you stole it?

229
00:47:11,389 --> 00:47:15,421
Yes.
- That was very brave.

230
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:20,792
I thought that without that book
his dragons could not verify.

231
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,561
And, did he?

232
00:47:25,703 --> 00:47:27,730
I was wrong.

233
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:31,604
He used them to my village
to attack.

234
00:47:32,477 --> 00:47:36,032
Destroy everything.

235
00:47:36,548 --> 00:47:39,933
We have previously fought with wizards.

236
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:44,587
They can be very annoying.

237
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:49,085
You will see that they are a defense,
which comes about by the spell.

238
00:47:49,694 --> 00:47:52,060
But ultimately,
are just men.

239
00:47:53,197 --> 00:47:56,189
Men who may be slain,
like all other men.

240
00:48:21,892 --> 00:48:26,325
Sorry, but we can tonight
no fire.

241
00:48:26,464 --> 00:48:29,758
I know, it would attract too much attention.

242
00:48:30,635 --> 00:48:33,103
I fear that someone following us.

243
00:48:36,173 --> 00:48:38,198
I do not know how this will work.

244
00:48:40,444 --> 00:48:42,469
How can there be a way out of here?

245
00:48:43,748 --> 00:48:45,511
Stay believe, Sigmund.

246
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:46,947
Believe?
- Yes.

247
00:48:47,118 --> 00:48:50,009
It was our belief that our
brought into this mess.

248
00:48:51,822 --> 00:48:53,255
We are left in the lurch.

249
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:59,421
We are still together?
We fight yet still together?

250
00:48:59,597 --> 00:49:03,289
I trust that woman.
Look at her.

251
00:49:05,936 --> 00:49:08,632
They will probably cut our throats
while we are sleeping.

252
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:16,886
You look tired, my friend.
Why do not you get some sleep?

253
00:49:18,249 --> 00:49:20,980
I say, let the book return
to the wizard.

254
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:24,380
And him more strength? Really.

255
00:49:24,989 --> 00:49:27,219
Following amendment to remove the curse.

256
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:29,392
Are you crazy? No.

257
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:32,151
He will assume
and he will help us all.

258
00:49:32,363 --> 00:49:35,560
We will not return the book.

259
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:55,946
You're a monk.

260
00:49:58,122 --> 00:50:00,478
Well, that was me.

261
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:09,385
Officially we disbanded.

262
00:50:09,567 --> 00:50:13,122
Can you be a monk without water.

263
00:50:14,204 --> 00:50:15,933
He believes not.

264
00:50:19,646 --> 00:50:25,347
But, you never wanted a woman,
a family?

265
00:50:32,122 --> 00:50:34,818
I've never thought about it.

266
00:50:45,736 --> 00:50:48,637
Sorry, I did not mean to offend.

267
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,133
You have not offended me.

268
00:50:53,744 --> 00:50:56,961
I must go now.

269
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:00,573
I must tell you something.

270
00:51:02,152 --> 00:51:04,799
I can read the old songs.

271
00:51:05,956 --> 00:51:09,050
Read the inscription in the book,
and I make undo the curse.

272
00:51:11,128 --> 00:51:13,528
Do not worry, I will not do it.

273
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:19,068
I fear that evil
my men overwhelmed.

274
00:51:21,972 --> 00:51:26,007
Even if they do not change,
growing evil in them.

275
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:31,147
If one of them discovered that ...

276
00:51:31,315 --> 00:51:33,545
Then I will stop them.
- Me too.

277
00:51:35,252 --> 00:51:40,385
But if something happens to me,
I can not protect the girl.

278
00:51:42,326 --> 00:51:46,957
You must leave us.
Take the girl tonight.

279
00:51:48,098 --> 00:51:53,029
I see no good end to all this.
- Me neither.

280
00:51:53,503 --> 00:51:58,770
Stay away from me.

281
00:52:08,285 --> 00:52:11,648
Kill me!
- No!

282
00:52:12,456 --> 00:52:14,720
I would have you both in two heels.

283
00:52:15,058 --> 00:52:17,754
You witch. You did this to us.

284
00:52:17,961 --> 00:52:19,758
You have to pay for.

285
00:52:20,564 --> 00:52:22,589
One move and you're dead.

286
00:52:24,835 --> 00:52:26,268
Sigmund.

287
00:52:27,237 --> 00:52:28,864
Put down your sword.

288
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,937
Was not it you who said that if you change,
you immediately is slain?

289
00:52:34,978 --> 00:52:38,046
Kill me.
- He still has not changed.

290
00:52:38,248 --> 00:52:40,216
Brethren, we must remain strong.

291
00:52:41,218 --> 00:52:45,786
We are brothers in arms.
This curse has blinded you.

292
00:52:49,026 --> 00:52:50,721
Put down your sword.

293
00:52:54,131 --> 00:52:59,232
No, it's you who does not see it.
This will solve everything.

294
00:52:59,936 --> 00:53:01,403
Do not.

295
00:53:05,308 --> 00:53:08,513
You, you shot me.

296
00:53:16,153 --> 00:53:18,679
Do not force me to do it.
- Go away.

297
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:24,827
You think you're better than everyone.

298
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:26,896
Not all ...

299
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,930
but better than you.

300
00:53:29,866 --> 00:53:35,070
I do not want to turn into one of those things.
- You do not.

301
00:54:41,304 --> 00:54:44,701
Take.
- Stay with him.

302
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:40,208
This will hurt.

303
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,765
Protect the girl.
- We will, together.

304
00:58:02,205 --> 00:58:04,738
I do not think so.

305
00:59:31,027 --> 00:59:33,518
Thank you.

306
01:00:05,094 --> 01:00:08,792
We must apparently a dragon hunt.
- Yes.

307
01:00:09,566 --> 01:00:11,864
I do not think the boy can travel.

308
01:00:14,504 --> 01:00:17,165
I'm with you.

309
01:00:43,566 --> 01:00:45,397
We can not go.

310
01:00:45,969 --> 01:00:47,903
Not in this area.

311
01:00:48,438 --> 01:00:50,998
We will the rest of the way to walk.

312
01:01:34,187 --> 01:01:36,420
Attacks!

313
01:02:59,135 --> 01:03:01,899
We will not go on this ground save.

314
01:03:02,105 --> 01:03:05,704
I'll get them.
- How can you, in that state?

315
01:03:05,842 --> 01:03:07,366
I can do it.

316
01:03:07,543 --> 01:03:10,936
I see myself still not save
to those mountains.

317
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:17,051
Please give this to take,
if you find her.

318
01:03:19,722 --> 01:03:22,046
Course.
- You can tell her ...

319
01:03:22,692 --> 01:03:26,624
that if I ever see her,
I've left the order.

320
01:03:26,829 --> 01:03:30,721
They will understand what I mean.
- Okay.

321
01:05:29,552 --> 01:05:31,850
It seems they look for saltpetre.

322
01:05:32,521 --> 01:05:35,953
What is that?
- It is the weapon of the Mongols.

323
01:05:49,305 --> 01:05:53,675
What brings you to Cataradreus?
- Who's in charge of this camp?

324
01:06:04,387 --> 01:06:10,055
These travelers want to talk to you.
-Please, take a drink.

325
01:06:29,545 --> 01:06:36,118
What bring two knights and a ...
to our glorious kingdom?

326
01:06:38,154 --> 01:06:41,180
I have long dreamed about the fall
of the black dragon.

327
01:06:41,824 --> 01:06:46,724
You have three fighters.
- You have your men.

328
01:06:46,896 --> 01:06:49,889
We will fight.
I will lead them.

329
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:52,191
I can not imagine the punishment
this village are honored ...

330
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:55,236
if we fortress on the mountain attacks.

331
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:57,939
So you would rather be a slave of the magician?

332
01:06:59,008 --> 01:07:01,576
Do not talk to me about compromises.

333
01:07:01,677 --> 01:07:05,044
You know nothing of the good people who used
tried to defeat the dragon and died.

334
01:07:06,949 --> 01:07:09,042
You can not imagine his strength.

335
01:07:09,752 --> 01:07:11,777
He crushed us.

336
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:16,648
Take it was one of your people, right?
- Please.

337
01:07:17,793 --> 01:07:19,988
They brought us the greatest misery.

338
01:07:20,162 --> 01:07:23,622
She was the favorite of the wizard.
His disciple.

339
01:07:24,267 --> 01:07:27,765
When they departed,
she left us.

340
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:30,163
And hell came down on us.

341
01:07:30,573 --> 01:07:32,837
If it is held by him,
then so be it.

342
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,535
You can not beat the wizard.

343
01:07:37,313 --> 01:07:39,838
He has seven dragons at his disposal.

344
01:07:40,516 --> 01:07:44,917
The eighth, the black dragon,
which will destroy us all.

345
01:07:45,655 --> 01:07:48,681
You might have something here,
to fight against the dragon.

346
01:07:49,492 --> 01:07:52,907
Like what?
- The substance they dig.

347
01:07:53,529 --> 01:07:56,657
All material found
must add to the wizard.

348
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:02,726
Then you will not fight.
- No.

349
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:07,326
You're wrong.

350
01:08:13,616 --> 01:08:16,585
I can not allow you
the fortress on the hill to attack.

351
01:08:16,786 --> 01:08:20,222
If you do, the anger of the magician
this village portion.

352
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:33,058
For those who do not want to die,
now is the time to go.

353
01:08:34,437 --> 01:08:40,068
The rest of you, get your gun,
because your time has come.

354
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:44,233
There are only three of you,
Look at us, what you gonna do?

355
01:09:38,934 --> 01:09:40,697
We need a diversion.

356
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:45,473
I Mongols who Weapons yet.

357
01:09:46,175 --> 01:09:48,040
What do you need?

358
01:09:49,945 --> 01:09:52,424
Some salt, Peter.

359
01:09:54,216 --> 01:09:55,808
Leave that to me.

360
01:10:33,154 --> 01:10:35,998
Thank you.

361
01:12:08,317 --> 01:12:11,479
This may be bloody.

362
01:12:12,054 --> 01:12:18,088
I beg you, let's fight with pride.
If you still can.

363
01:12:21,163 --> 01:12:23,790
Can I?

364
01:12:27,069 --> 01:12:30,185
And this is nothing personal.

365
01:12:30,606 --> 01:12:33,903
I wanted to let you know.

366
01:12:39,982 --> 01:12:43,189
If someone attacks me with a gun ...

367
01:12:52,361 --> 01:12:56,885
I simply kill.

368
01:13:12,748 --> 01:13:16,113
What is that?
- A hand grenade.

369
01:13:16,352 --> 01:13:19,810
I have 16 horses exchanged
for this beauty, with a Mongol.

370
01:13:30,732 --> 01:13:32,427
Come on, hurry up.

371
01:13:33,737 --> 01:13:37,002
This will be a bigger explosion.

372
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:41,500
Now we have to run, come on.

373
01:14:17,246 --> 01:14:20,046
There goes the seventh.
We'll never get there?

374
01:14:20,182 --> 01:14:22,771
There is another input.

375
01:15:12,835 --> 01:15:15,796
There she is.
- Please.

376
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:17,371
Hello.

377
01:15:18,073 --> 01:15:21,503
Do not worry, it'll be fine.
We'll pick you up.

378
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:23,637
How do we get her out?

379
01:15:24,446 --> 01:15:26,676
That's a very good question.

380
01:15:26,882 --> 01:15:30,613
But a better question would be,
how did you get here ...

381
01:15:31,353 --> 01:15:33,344
alive.
- Show yourself.

382
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:38,119
Why would I do that?

383
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:41,556
If you like to see,
only evil intentions.

384
01:15:41,596 --> 01:15:46,064
We just want the girl.
- I think you want something different, or not?

385
01:15:46,268 --> 01:15:51,160
You want them to break the curse,
which they have called you.

386
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:55,572
At this time I want to kill you
and move on.

387
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:59,044
Give it your best shot.

388
01:16:02,217 --> 01:16:04,181
An appearance.

389
01:16:04,219 --> 01:16:07,453
Maybe it's a manifestation
someone in another place.

390
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:10,018
Do not you want to know how you
can cure yourself?

391
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:11,888
It's very simple.

392
01:16:12,027 --> 01:16:18,057
If you read the book carefully, is all
you should do "kill the girl."

393
01:16:19,268 --> 01:16:22,740
And you will be free from the curse.

394
01:16:23,038 --> 01:16:28,711
Is that true?
- Yes.

395
01:16:28,911 --> 01:16:33,023
You should choose
or you want to change your destiny.

396
01:16:33,123 --> 01:16:38,611
Kill me, I deserve to die.
- Can you hear it, they will die.

397
01:16:38,687 --> 01:16:40,748
You must do it.

398
01:16:42,057 --> 01:16:47,587
The wizard is near. His form of magic
can not be done from afar.

399
01:16:50,499 --> 01:16:53,250
Follow me.

400
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:56,233
The puzzle is now together.

401
01:16:56,371 --> 01:16:59,033
The reason the people to nitric
the graves.

402
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:02,177
I am sure that the same substance is
what is the elixir of life should be.

403
01:17:02,778 --> 01:17:06,312
The magician is, physically speaking, I think,
in poor health.

404
01:17:06,448 --> 01:17:09,409
We look for him and then we kill him.

405
01:17:09,818 --> 01:17:14,278
If you leave this room,
then you will die.

406
01:17:15,824 --> 01:17:21,026
We will all die once.
But today it's your turn to die.

407
01:17:21,496 --> 01:17:27,359
Our destiny beyond the thousand deaths,
will defeat us. As you move forward.

408
01:17:33,675 --> 01:17:38,513
You will never break your curse,
if you murder me.

409
01:17:38,714 --> 01:17:42,214
I am the only one who has the key.

410
01:17:45,053 --> 01:17:49,352
You can not kill me.
I am immortal.

411
01:17:50,692 --> 01:17:55,717
My mind does not exist,
inside said reservoir.

412
01:17:56,265 --> 01:17:58,162
I guess we'll find out.

413
01:18:05,107 --> 01:18:06,699
Do it!

414
01:18:18,987 --> 01:18:20,682
Where is the wizard go?

415
01:18:20,756 --> 01:18:24,986
He can materialize our body, which goes
not fast, and often can not be done.

416
01:18:25,193 --> 01:18:28,929
We gotta get her out of there.
- I have an idea.

417
01:18:29,864 --> 01:18:32,287
Lie down in the cage.

418
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:16,678
Come, do not worry.

419
01:19:16,812 --> 01:19:19,720
Hold on tight and do not look down.

420
01:19:21,283 --> 01:19:23,886
Come on, that's good.

421
01:19:26,521 --> 01:19:30,150
It's all right, come on.
Quickly, we have not much time.

422
01:19:31,827 --> 01:19:34,438
That's it.

423
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:53,844
It's all right, lady.
I got you.

424
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,387
Where is Maldwyn?

425
01:20:00,187 --> 01:20:02,781
I am sorry
- No.

426
01:20:13,435 --> 01:20:14,459
Go!

427
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:45,630
What is that?
- Old-fashioned Chinese Medicine.

428
01:20:45,934 --> 01:20:48,530
This works best.
Cover your ears.

429
01:21:22,504 --> 01:21:24,955
Go.

430
01:21:40,956 --> 01:21:43,359
Maldwyn.

431
01:21:45,427 --> 01:21:49,332
Come on.
- No, Maldwyn.

432
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:00,107
Go.

433
01:22:04,646 --> 01:22:07,852
Maldwyn.
- Come on.

434
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:12,299
Stop fighting, now.

435
01:22:47,222 --> 01:22:49,724
This way.

436
01:22:53,961 --> 01:22:56,234
Come on.

437
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:09,531
We can not cover.
- There must be something we can do.

438
01:23:10,545 --> 01:23:13,844
The saltpeter.
We lure him back to the mine.

439
01:23:14,216 --> 01:23:18,118
I go along.
- No, stay here and protect the people.

440
01:23:29,097 --> 01:23:32,225
Come on, beast.

441
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:56,882
Give me the book. That he wants.
It will distract him.

442
01:24:04,699 --> 01:24:08,132
Come on.
Here it is.

443
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:50,663
Thank you.

444
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:33,918
I had the strangest dream ever.
- Me too.

445
01:27:41,549 --> 01:27:44,282
My brother.

446
01:27:49,657 --> 01:27:52,148
I found you nice in a form
of a Gargoyle.

447
01:27:52,427 --> 01:27:55,261
Large, tough beast that you were.

448
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:12,642
