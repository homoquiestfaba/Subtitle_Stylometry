1
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:18,934
Not Bad.

2
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,036
You were not so bad yourself

3
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:25,475
Max Vatan.

4
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:27,479
Marianne Beausejour.

5
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:33,702
Heard a lot bout you
around the circuit.

6
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,158
I have heard a lot
about you

7
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:39,341
Keep going straight.
I'll tell when to turn.

8
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,225
You in Dieppe for a while?

9
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:47,582
A husband would offer his wife a cigarette
before lighting his own.

10
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:49,440
Turn right here.

11
00:09:51,745 --> 00:09:52,745
Thank You.

12
00:09:58,193 --> 00:10:00,917
What went wrong in Paris?
Your entire circuit was taken out.

13
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:06,815
I never discuss non-relevant
operational information with anyone.

14
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:08,638
I'll try to stay relevant then.

15
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:10,224
That would be appreciated.

16
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:11,745
Do they trust you?

17
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:17,244
Two months ago, I got promoted
to the embassy liaison department.

18
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,753
I deal with the German legation everyday.

19
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:21,658
But do they trust you?

20
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,119
How did it look?

21
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,277
They seem to like you.

22
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:30,493
And I like them.

23
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:32,879
I keep the emotions real.

24
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:34,671
That's why it works.

25
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:37,558
Don't slow down.

26
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,573
This is how you drive in Casablanca.

27
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:19,934
We won't be in the apartment much.

28
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:22,402
I have to go out there and sell you.

29
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:25,985
We'll have to be careful.

30
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,899
I've told everyone my
husband is from Paris.

31
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:30,970
And?

32
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:33,191
<i>And...</i>

33
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:35,432
<i>your french is good...</i>

34
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,539
<i>but your Parisian accent
is terrible</i>

35
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,139
Oh..

36
00:11:49,235 --> 00:11:50,924
So then you are in trouble.

37
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,441
That was pure Quebec.

38
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,287
<i>with French Moroccans
you might be okay, but..</i>

39
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:01,990
<i>You have to be careful in front of real
Parisians until the party.</i>

40
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,107
Party's in 10 days.
Is my invitation gonna be a problem?

41
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:08,628
<i>Now that you're here</i>

42
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:12,027
<i>I am going to set up a
meeting with Herr Hobar.</i>

43
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,629
And then its up to you.

44
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:18,899
Can you stand 10 days
in this tiny little place...

45
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:20,380
<i>Le Quebeqois?</i>

46
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:22,758
Its not so bad.

47
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:25,020
Water is hot, sometimes.

48
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,916
I'll take the couch.

49
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,379
Actually you'll sleep on the roof.

50
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:31,139
It's cooler...

51
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,345
And in Casablanca,the roof
is where the husbands go...

52
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:36,640
after they've made love to their wives.

53
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:08,482
The neighbours will find it
curious if I don't

54
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:10,585
come to visit you
on your first night.

55
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:16,120
I told madame Torgenot,
and madame Petit all about you.

56
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:18,756
They'll be very excited.

57
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:22,253
They'll guess that the
sex is already over.

58
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,177
And it was great by the way.

59
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:31,238
<i>Then...</i>

60
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:33,427
You went to the roof.

61
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,038
I missed you...

62
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,341
...because I've been sleeping alone
for so many months.

63
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,234
So I came up to tell you I love you.

64
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,942
You're very thorough.

65
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:48,840
That's why I am still alive.

66
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,073
Now we should talk.

67
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:52,940
And laugh.

68
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,461
We're married.
Why would we laugh?

69
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,912
Kiss me.

70
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:16,312
Now Talk.

71
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:18,245
Tell me..

72
00:14:18,783 --> 00:14:20,818
...what you'll do after the war.

73
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:25,125
I don't know
what I'll do after the war

74
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:30,825
Look!

75
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:34,360
The lovely madam Petit
in apartment 7.

76
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:37,998
She's married to a
German tank captain.

77
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:39,778
And she's watching us.

78
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:43,852
So we should talk...
And laugh.

79
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:48,942
Okay.

80
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:52,911
After the war,
I'm buying a ranch.

81
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:54,786
With horses.

82
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:56,838
A ranch?

83
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,150
You mean like in the movies?

84
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,508
Cowboys?
Bang bang!?

85
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,910
Yeah.

86
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:09,486
Are you just saying this to
say something or is it real?

87
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:12,701
Umm its real. Its a...

88
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:14,802
...ranch on a prairie.

89
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,269
<i>outside a place called
Medicine Hat.</i>

90
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:21,884
Now I know you're joking.

91
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:26,851
You think you'll ever get there?

92
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:31,937
Well..

93
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:35,597
I guess that's not the
point of Medicine Hat, huh?

94
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:37,251
No.

95
00:15:40,588 --> 00:15:43,120
Ok. That wasn't so hard was it?

96
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,460
Now this is the part where
I tell you <i>I Love You</i>...

97
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,883
...and leave you to count the stars.

98
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:53,485
Or whatever it is men do on their rooftops.

99
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:55,565
Je t´aime.

100
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:57,581
Je t´aime aussi.

101
00:15:59,297 --> 00:16:00,758
Now kiss me again.

102
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,850
<i>Bon nuit.</i>

103
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:56,255
You can come in now.

104
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,579
You are somewhat
formal and reserved.

105
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:11,840
But you like expensive clothes.

106
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,730
And yours shoes are
always polished.

107
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:20,567
We told everyone you're
quite a serious Catholic.

108
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,148
At least you can smell
like a Parisian!

109
00:17:33,644 --> 00:17:35,346
I'll leave you to choose.

110
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,697
Before I left London, Guy Sangster
asked me to say thank you.

111
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:51,609
We flew Lizzies together.

112
00:17:52,191 --> 00:17:55,429
Remember Guy?
You got him out of Dieppe in '41.

113
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,672
Ok: what did he say about me?

114
00:18:01,268 --> 00:18:02,682
He said you were beautiful.

115
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:04,798
And good.

116
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:10,409
Being good at this kind of work
is not very beautiful.

117
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:18,415
You look okay.

118
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:19,893
Let's go.

119
00:23:27,827 --> 00:23:29,347
What went wrong in Paris?

120
00:23:31,704 --> 00:23:34,532
V-Section left us hanging out to dry.

121
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:37,513
How did you get away?

122
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:39,807
I ran.

123
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:44,707
And ran.
Kept on running.

124
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:03,561
Madame Petit.
Lurking in the window.

125
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:40,596
This Herr Hobar we're meeting tomorrow:
What can you tell me about him?

126
00:24:41,824 --> 00:24:43,671
He is the ambassador's liaison.

127
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:46,015
A high ranking party member
from Cologne.

128
00:24:46,607 --> 00:24:48,588
He likes golf and gambling.

129
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:50,826
He is our final hurdle.

130
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:54,155
You have 2 seconds.

131
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:56,203
Go.

132
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:27,528
The guns will be taped
under the champagne table.

133
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:31,046
The ambassador arrives at
precisely 8.30

134
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,272
If he's late?

135
00:25:33,986 --> 00:25:36,523
He's German.
He'll be on time.

136
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,211
How come you don't know 'Stens?

137
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,752
I do know 'Stens.

138
00:25:43,318 --> 00:25:46,133
I didn't see you set
the travel safety.

139
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:48,964
You'll be okay to use
a 'Sten on the night though?

140
00:25:50,487 --> 00:25:53,128
I would be okay if I had
to use cutlery!

141
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:02,200
Diversion attack will happen
5 minutes later, at 8.35

142
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:06,307
Then everything will be in
God's hands

143
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:07,698
Good.

144
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:10,586
Hopefully he'll know
how to work the safety.

145
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:23,844
Its hot.

146
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:01,147
What are you doin?

147
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:03,984
Testing you...

148
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:06,541
...The way you tested me.

149
00:27:08,482 --> 00:27:10,703
I know youre armed with
an weapon Mr. Vatan..

150
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,126
I'm just checking your
safety catch is engaged.

151
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,362
There!

152
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,556
We had our first fight.

153
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,054
Now we're okay again, yes?

154
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:28,729
Marianne...

155
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,038
We both know people who
fucked each other.

156
00:27:32,061 --> 00:27:34,085
Then they fucked up &
now they're fucking dead.

157
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,019
Wow. That's a lot of fucks.

158
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:40,721
Ask your goddamn partners.

159
00:27:51,954 --> 00:27:53,554
Actually Max...

160
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:59,551
...the mistakes people make in
these situations isn't fucking.

161
00:28:00,118 --> 00:28:01,932
It's feeling.

162
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,980
Oh, my husband's trying to cut down..

163
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:07,132
..he says the war makes everyone
smoke too much.

164
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:09,811
I've only heard good things
about him round town.

165
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,141
Good things.

166
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:13,777
Sit down please.

167
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:20,539
Your husband doesn't speak English?

168
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:22,449
Err, only a Little.

169
00:30:33,577 --> 00:30:35,405
He doesn't seem to want to come.

170
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:42,057
There's a stupid Poker game
in the Rue Valence

171
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,288
Ya I see.
(laughs)

172
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:52,059
So your husband plays Poker?

173
00:30:52,438 --> 00:30:53,777
Oh: he's obsessed.

174
00:30:53,992 --> 00:30:55,772
As am I...
As am I.

175
00:30:56,165 --> 00:30:58,556
And now we cut.
High card wins.

176
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:01,134
Wins what?

177
00:31:01,358 --> 00:31:03,705
If his card is higher than mine,
he can go to his poker game.

178
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:06,200
If its lower, he <i>must</i> come to the party.

179
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,471
This is too absurd!

180
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:35,939
Mining?

181
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,846
Yes

182
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,984
He works with Phosphate, right?

183
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,536
That's right.

184
00:32:45,451 --> 00:32:47,990
One more thing.
Boring. Procedure.

185
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:50,202
For new names on the list...

186
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:40,919
See you both Tomorrow.

187
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,997
So it's in the cards.

188
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:49,800
We get our chance to make history.

189
00:33:58,742 --> 00:34:00,259
Couldn't sleep.

190
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:08,009
I won't let you down, <i>Quebequois</i>.

191
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:11,018
I know.

192
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:19,492
Let's get outta here.
Let's go watch the sunrise.

193
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,760
What are our odds?

194
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:31,413
Surviving?

195
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:33,177
60/40...

196
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:35,137
...against.

197
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:38,217
Both of us, I don't know.

198
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,516
So tell me about Medicine Hat.

199
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:52,606
Pretty green. Rolling hills.
Clean water.

200
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:56,492
Just a place I go when things get dark.

201
00:34:58,302 --> 00:34:59,391
You?

202
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,907
You have a place?

203
00:35:03,278 --> 00:35:05,106
When the war is over...

204
00:35:06,101 --> 00:35:07,974
..it won't matter where I am.

205
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:20,460
We should be going.

206
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:52,010
If we're dead tomorrow...

207
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:58,260
...no one would know.

208
00:38:01,775 --> 00:38:02,963
The guns?

209
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,445
Gone.

210
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:09,132
Merci, <i>Le Quebequois</i>.

211
00:38:10,472 --> 00:38:12,117
I'm from Ontario.

212
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:38,719
Move!

213
00:42:31,106 --> 00:42:32,418
No one's following us.

214
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:41,344
We are alive, Max!
We are both alive.

215
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:45,764
Come with me to London.

216
00:42:50,666 --> 00:42:52,454
Come with me to London & be my wife.

217
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,090
George?

218
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:36,922
Salute me, Frenchman!

219
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:39,865
- Go to hell!
- This is hell: it's an office.

220
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:43,940
I heard an unspeakable rumor
about you being in love.

221
00:43:44,532 --> 00:43:46,572
Oh! Gotta go, George.
Buy me a drink later.

222
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:49,369
Max! You appear to be walking on air!
..It's revolting!

223
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,293
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

224
00:43:51,724 --> 00:43:54,510
- You said Frank wanted to see me?
- Yes, straight away.

225
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,295
Max please remember you are
in the land of YES SIR, NO SIR

226
00:43:59,668 --> 00:44:02,103
- Don't throw anything or hit anyone.
- Got it.

227
00:44:05,257 --> 00:44:06,692
He's ready to see you.

228
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,306
Frank.

229
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:21,327
They said you had news?

230
00:44:22,215 --> 00:44:27,070
Yes yes I have news, Wing Commander.
Regarding Marianne Beausejour.

231
00:44:27,605 --> 00:44:29,548
It's been three fucking weeks.

232
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,606
"SIR."

233
00:44:34,163 --> 00:44:35,806
"It's been three fucking weeks SIR".

234
00:44:36,581 --> 00:44:38,336
It's been three fucking weeks SIR.

235
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:42,719
after the thorough vetting procedure
carried out by...

236
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,543
...V-Section in Gibraltar

237
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:49,356
Marianne Beausejour...

238
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:53,108
has been approved
for passage to England.

239
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:00,737
That'll be all, Wing Commander.

240
00:45:02,815 --> 00:45:03,994
Max?

241
00:45:05,188 --> 00:45:06,773
You're a bloody fool.

242
00:45:07,307 --> 00:45:08,628
Yes Sir.
Thank you Sir.

243
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:12,072
Marriages made in the field
never work.

244
00:45:13,056 --> 00:45:14,463
You're absolutely right, Sir.

245
00:45:15,025 --> 00:45:16,889
You're invited to the wedding
by the way.

246
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:26,255
- That's it. Careful, Mac!
- Hold on.

247
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:27,969
Here we go. Come on.

248
00:45:28,505 --> 00:45:31,157
That's it.
Come on in Darlings.

249
00:45:37,518 --> 00:45:40,452
Don't ask me why that's true.
What the hell have we here?

250
00:45:40,974 --> 00:45:44,623
You know. Here's a fun fact:
Only thing in London not rationed...

251
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:46,016
...Champagne!

252
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,597
Champagne and Sex.

253
00:45:47,905 --> 00:45:50,798
My God, Max.
Your sister is obsessed.

254
00:45:51,213 --> 00:45:52,759
Yes, Isn't it wonderful?

255
00:45:53,164 --> 00:45:56,489
To my <i>formerly</i> perma-frosted Brother...

256
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,664
Thawed at last!
By love.

257
00:46:00,146 --> 00:46:02,074
That's rather poetic.

258
00:46:03,217 --> 00:46:05,543
Oh, for Goodness sake!

259
00:46:09,815 --> 00:46:12,018
Honestly: I'll miss the Blitz.

260
00:46:12,954 --> 00:46:15,655
I will. No one cares,
who does what to whom.

261
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,934
So we should be drinking the war!
And freedom.

262
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:21,610
- To war!
- To freedom!

263
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,652
Marianne, I would offer
you my congratulations...

264
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,443
But I've known Max a long time.
I'll just wish you good luck.

265
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:36,561
No no no! <i>Now</i> my brother's just
an ordinary man. Flying a desk...

266
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,762
...in some boring office.

267
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:42,568
A talented boy like Max won't be
behind a desk with Frank for long.

268
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,777
Our Spooky friends from V-section?
They will come calling...

269
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:48,380
Just when you least expect it.

270
00:46:57,211 --> 00:46:59,972
You entirely okay,
Madam Vatan?

271
00:47:01,856 --> 00:47:02,898
Entirely.

272
00:47:10,353 --> 00:47:12,144
Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!

273
00:47:12,445 --> 00:47:14,126
Get up! Get Outside!

274
00:47:17,775 --> 00:47:20,865
(screams) Quickly!
Quickly!

275
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:34,028
I'll need that trolly.
Help me.

276
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:35,940
Get this up, now.

277
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,009
Get her on it - away from the wall.
Come on!

278
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:42,137
Help me someone.

279
00:47:42,704 --> 00:47:45,467
That's it!

280
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,476
Get me some light over here now!

281
00:47:55,193 --> 00:47:56,253
Very close.

282
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:58,248
Good girl. Good girl.

283
00:48:01,516 --> 00:48:03,643
Pant for me.
Girl?

284
00:48:15,681 --> 00:48:16,681
<i>C´est moi!</i>

285
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:20,193
This is really me!
As I am before God.

286
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,838
It's a Girl.

287
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:51,612
There!
A celebration!

288
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:55,387
- For What?
- Your 1st weekend off in 57 days.

289
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:57,233
I counted.

290
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,521
- Are the eggs from the hens?
- From <i>our</i> hens.

291
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:05,358
Ah! So they <i>were</i> a good investment, hmm?

292
00:51:06,126 --> 00:51:07,291
Weren't they?

293
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:08,818
Max...

294
00:51:09,673 --> 00:51:11,844
...let's go to the heath
and pick mushrooms?

295
00:51:13,567 --> 00:51:16,077
Tomorrow I want to serve
Stroganoff at a party.

296
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,023
What Party?

297
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:23,313
Now darling, I've got lots of new friends
who are dying to meet you.

298
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:25,148
You'll like them.

299
00:51:25,677 --> 00:51:29,068
They're refugees. Intellectuals.
Bohemians.

300
00:51:29,543 --> 00:51:31,922
Hampsted is full of interesting people.

301
00:51:37,217 --> 00:51:38,608
Poor Max.

302
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:43,588
In Casablanca we pretended you hated parties
<i>et Voila</i>! It's True.

303
00:51:49,021 --> 00:51:52,021
- What's the new nanny's name again?
- Miss Sinclair. Sinclair.

304
00:51:52,954 --> 00:51:54,835
Hello, Miss. Sinclair.

305
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,846
Max has 3 days off.
Isn't that great?

306
00:51:58,217 --> 00:51:59,539
She just woke up.

307
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:02,092
We won't be long.
Just gonna pick some mushrooms.

308
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:03,840
Oh.. take your time.

309
00:52:04,771 --> 00:52:06,523
It's always my Pleasure.

310
00:52:23,588 --> 00:52:25,367
I have to go and get Anna.

311
00:52:29,427 --> 00:52:33,777
Just once! You can ignore it.
Just once.

312
00:52:38,733 --> 00:52:40,119
Hampstead 235.

313
00:52:46,657 --> 00:52:49,181
Sure. 15:00.
I'll be there.

314
00:52:51,775 --> 00:52:53,545
When will you be back?

315
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,018
You know I don't know.

316
00:52:56,525 --> 00:52:59,132
What the hell is it that's so important?

317
00:53:00,461 --> 00:53:01,916
Liberating your country.

318
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:06,963
Then you must go.

319
00:53:17,076 --> 00:53:18,117
Morning, Margaret.

320
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,721
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Afternoon.

321
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,398
George is in your office.

322
00:53:22,996 --> 00:53:25,043
But you said to meet you in the mess?

323
00:53:25,597 --> 00:53:28,186
Oh.. I lied.
It isn't me you here to see.

324
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,273
- Oh: do you?...
- No.

325
00:53:30,835 --> 00:53:34,018
No. V-section want to speak to you.

326
00:53:34,766 --> 00:53:36,077
Why didn't they call me?

327
00:53:36,454 --> 00:53:39,641
V-Section don't ever say what they mean
and they never mean what they say...

328
00:53:39,934 --> 00:53:42,101
...and they never say anything on the phone.

329
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:46,206
Look, I told you they'd come
for you eventually didn't I, Max?

330
00:53:47,106 --> 00:53:48,516
Such a clever boy.

331
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:52,820
Well, I suppose, I ought to congratulate you
on your promotion.

332
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:55,423
Since you seem to know so much,
what is the position?

333
00:53:55,923 --> 00:53:58,025
Oh gosh. Way way above
my security level, old man.

334
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:00,436
I'm just the messenger-boy.

335
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:56,875
- Wing commander.
- Frank.

336
00:54:58,168 --> 00:54:59,369
Have a seat.

337
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:11,278
We haven't been introduced.

338
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:18,396
OK: Frank whatever the job is,
I dont want it.

339
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:20,998
I'm perfectly happy to stay with you.

340
00:55:21,675 --> 00:55:22,675
Max...

341
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:26,599
I'm afraid this really isn't
what you think it is.

342
00:55:27,369 --> 00:55:28,398
And...

343
00:55:28,768 --> 00:55:29,768
Well...

344
00:55:30,155 --> 00:55:33,168
There's no easy way to say
what we're about to say.

345
00:55:34,226 --> 00:55:37,596
We believe your wife is a German spy.

346
00:55:45,172 --> 00:55:47,702
OK, wait. Wait.

347
00:55:49,688 --> 00:55:51,483
Seriously, Frank.
Who is this?

348
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:53,603
I'm a Rat-catcher.

349
00:55:53,815 --> 00:55:57,298
I also out rank you
So you can call <i>me</i> "SIR".

350
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:01,865
You have to listen to him MAX.
He outranks both of us.

351
00:56:02,335 --> 00:56:06,851
Now over the past 7 days, V-section
has intercepted coded messages...

352
00:56:07,184 --> 00:56:10,599
..being sent from London to Berlin
on the WT transceiver.

353
00:56:10,987 --> 00:56:13,853
We haven't traced the signal
to an address yet. But it's coming...

354
00:56:14,105 --> 00:56:18,061
..from the Highgate region
of North London, and the Information...

355
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:22,728
..concerns the activity of SOE Circuits in France.

356
00:56:23,436 --> 00:56:26,331
In one transcript, the agent
refers to his sourc as...

357
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:29,746
.."Fraulein". So It's a woman.

358
00:56:31,773 --> 00:56:34,985
Ok, ok. Frank? Can we speak alone
for a Moment?

359
00:56:35,313 --> 00:56:36,762
Wing Commander Vatan?

360
00:56:36,963 --> 00:56:40,277
Do you ever speak to
your wife about your work?

361
00:56:41,527 --> 00:56:42,527
Okay. Uh..

362
00:56:43,762 --> 00:56:46,021
Sir, before this thing gets
out of hand...

363
00:56:46,547 --> 00:56:48,041
...May I speak?

364
00:56:48,652 --> 00:56:50,001
Hmm? May I speak?

365
00:56:50,585 --> 00:56:52,197
- Yes.
- Yes?

366
00:56:53,498 --> 00:56:55,697
My wife is Marianne Beausejour.

367
00:56:56,552 --> 00:57:00,425
Marianne Beausejour ran the most
effective resistance circuit in Paris..

368
00:57:00,954 --> 00:57:04,581
Until V-Section fucked it up
for her in '41.

369
00:57:06,365 --> 00:57:07,833
We met in Casablanca.

370
00:57:08,427 --> 00:57:12,606
Where together we assassinated
the German ambassador.

371
00:57:15,795 --> 00:57:17,710
She's the mother of my child.

372
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:20,487
She gave birth to my child
for Christ sake.

373
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:23,990
This is a translated transcript of
an interrogation of a German...

374
00:57:24,288 --> 00:57:26,132
..Abhewr officer captured in Tobruk.

375
00:57:26,347 --> 00:57:30,344
Amongst many other things,
he claims Marianne Beausejour...

376
00:57:30,628 --> 00:57:33,641
was arrested and
executed in May 1941...

377
00:57:33,862 --> 00:57:36,101
when rest of her circuit was
captured in Paris.

378
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:37,778
Marianne Beausejour's identity...

379
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,922
was then given to a German agent
of similar build and colouring,

380
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,865
she was flown to Casablanca,where
no one knew the real Marianne.

381
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:52,028
And it was subsequently discovered
that the German ambassador...

382
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:55,869
who you assassinated in Casablanca,
was a dissident.

383
00:57:56,226 --> 00:57:58,791
Hitler wanted him killed.

384
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,559
This is insane.

385
00:58:02,817 --> 00:58:06,601
All the information
in the intercepted communications...

386
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,692
had crossed <i>your</i> desk.

387
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:12,505
Yes, <i>everything</i> crosses my fucking desk.

388
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:16,304
Max, this is now
an operational mission.

389
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,637
If Marianne is indeed a German spy...

390
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:22,998
- My wife is not a spy!
- If she is...

391
00:58:23,478 --> 00:58:26,300
we need to keep her in
place for 72 hours...

392
00:58:26,788 --> 00:58:30,706
so that we can identify her handler
and clean out the rest of her circuit.

393
00:58:36,545 --> 00:58:37,545
No.

394
00:58:54,755 --> 00:58:57,480
Now we have got that out of the way,
perhaps we could discuss...

395
00:58:57,746 --> 00:59:01,610
the operational details of the
next 72 hours?

396
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:07,885
So this is gonna be a standard
Blue Dye procedure, Blue dye eing...

397
00:59:08,226 --> 00:59:09,795
I know what blue dye is.

398
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,351
Tonight...

399
00:59:11,556 --> 00:59:14,793
You will receive a telephone call
at exactly 23.07.

400
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:16,342
Repeat the time Wing Commander.

401
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,606
23:07, Sir.

402
00:59:19,907 --> 00:59:22,947
You will take the call and you will write down
a message somewhere your wife can read it.

403
00:59:23,213 --> 00:59:25,101
It will be false information,
only you will have it.

404
00:59:25,373 --> 00:59:29,005
But it will appear to be of a high grade.
So she will have to pass it on quickly.

405
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,771
By midday on Monday...

406
00:59:31,161 --> 00:59:35,251
our agents will have decoded
enemy traffic from the weekend.

407
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:37,942
So if the false information...

408
00:59:38,315 --> 00:59:42,550
is among the batches sent
from London, we shall know for sure.

409
00:59:43,054 --> 00:59:47,264
If you are right Max, the information
won't appear on the transcripts and...

410
00:59:47,682 --> 00:59:49,644
all this will be forgotten.

411
00:59:52,206 --> 00:59:56,047
But if it is proven that your
wife <i>is</i> a spy...

412
01:00:01,271 --> 01:00:05,476
Routine procedures in cases
of intimate betrayal...

413
01:00:05,804 --> 01:00:07,572
will apply.

414
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,586
You will execute her with your
own hands...

415
01:00:10,882 --> 01:00:14,005
and if we discover that
you are an accomplice in any way...

416
01:00:14,414 --> 01:00:19,188
You will be hanged for high treason
Wing Commander Vatan. Do you understand?

417
01:00:24,193 --> 01:00:27,273
He needs to confirm that he understands...

418
01:00:27,853 --> 01:00:29,202
Routine procedures-

419
01:00:29,443 --> 01:00:31,898
He understand the procedure, damn it.

420
01:00:33,753 --> 01:00:34,831
Good.

421
01:00:35,943 --> 01:00:38,378
Max it is vital you do nothing differently.

422
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:40,097
You are not to investigate.

423
01:00:40,297 --> 01:00:43,184
Or take matters into your own
hands, do you understand?

424
01:00:48,842 --> 01:00:50,351
Sir, I uh...

425
01:00:51,268 --> 01:00:52,751
I apologize for...

426
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:55,501
behaving unprofessionally just then.

427
01:00:57,476 --> 01:01:00,974
But I know, for a fact,
you'll be proven wrong.

428
01:01:04,054 --> 01:01:08,213
Now Wing Commander, you will go home
and carry on as if nothing's happened.

429
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:12,028
You are dismissed.

430
01:02:02,644 --> 01:02:04,934
You were ages.

431
01:02:06,596 --> 01:02:09,742
You know how it is.
Once you get in, you can't get out.

432
01:02:17,007 --> 01:02:19,304
Young pilot needed a pep-talk.

433
01:02:19,706 --> 01:02:21,873
And I got dragged into a briefing.

434
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:24,186
Hey!

435
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:27,393
What happened to my kiss?

436
01:02:32,586 --> 01:02:34,192
How's the Princess?

437
01:02:34,492 --> 01:02:35,807
Sleeping.

438
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:45,592
Well the big news is
I definitely have the weekend off.

439
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:49,561
Until the Phone rings.

440
01:02:49,762 --> 01:02:50,838
Nope.

441
01:02:51,139 --> 01:02:53,228
Definitely free the whole weekend.

442
01:03:12,742 --> 01:03:14,172
So...

443
01:03:17,952 --> 01:03:20,527
The party is on?

444
01:03:23,451 --> 01:03:25,317
Yeah, the party's on.

445
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:46,108
I'll need to get some
drinks for tomorrow night.

446
01:04:46,811 --> 01:04:48,869
Mm-hmm. I'll pick some up in the morning.

447
01:04:59,385 --> 01:05:01,121
It's like they're watching us.

448
01:05:05,398 --> 01:05:08,780
Honey give me my arm.

449
01:05:11,465 --> 01:05:13,336
Hampstead 235.

450
01:05:13,934 --> 01:05:16,206
Wing Commander Vatan.

451
01:05:16,407 --> 01:05:18,309
- Honey Do you have a pen?
- No.

452
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:21,849
Mm-hmm.

453
01:05:51,608 --> 01:05:53,751
Yeah, I got it.
I'll dispatch in the morning.

454
01:06:04,626 --> 01:06:09,407
Don't think I'm going to let you sleep,
Mr. Vatan.

455
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:54,548
<i>I keep the emotions real.</i>

456
01:06:56,353 --> 01:06:57,920
<i>That's why it works.</i>

457
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,574
Come back to bed.

458
01:07:57,793 --> 01:07:59,512
<i>It'll be okay.</i>

459
01:08:01,532 --> 01:08:03,932
<i>It'll be okay coz its not true.<i>

460
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:38,434
Honey?

461
01:08:38,735 --> 01:08:40,206
You're in uniform.

462
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:42,877
Yeah I'm gonna pop by the base
and pick up some whiskey.

463
01:08:43,179 --> 01:08:45,627
There's 50 cases of the good stuff
stashed in diplomatic hanger.

464
01:08:45,728 --> 01:08:46,728
They won't miss a few.

465
01:08:46,829 --> 01:08:48,829
Why not just go to the shop?

466
01:08:49,231 --> 01:08:51,354
Nothing but the best for your intellectuals.

467
01:08:54,341 --> 01:08:56,822
I'll meet you at the pub, after
& we'll pick up the beer.

468
01:08:58,533 --> 01:08:59,862
Of course.

469
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:49,301
- Hi.
- Max!

470
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:53,095
What the hell brings you here?

471
01:09:53,396 --> 01:09:56,798
I just dropped by to invite
you both to a party tonight.

472
01:09:57,154 --> 01:09:58,277
Why didn't you just phone?

473
01:10:00,761 --> 01:10:03,059
Max, you look like you did...

474
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:05,390
the day that you burned the barn down.

475
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:09,689
Marianne's cooking.
Why don't you come by?

476
01:10:14,661 --> 01:10:18,438
Oh actually, Max?
Tonight might not be possible.

477
01:10:19,262 --> 01:10:22,239
Max, Max I heard that
you were in V-Section.

478
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,617
If they're offering you some
kind of suicide mission,

479
01:10:24,817 --> 01:10:26,501
you can say no to them.
You know that.

480
01:10:26,702 --> 01:10:27,953
You hardly have anything on.

481
01:10:28,154 --> 01:10:30,363
What's happened Max?

482
01:10:32,627 --> 01:10:34,902
They are running a
Blue dye on Marianne.

483
01:10:37,016 --> 01:10:38,702
Oh my GOD.

484
01:10:39,604 --> 01:10:41,039
But it isn't true.

485
01:10:41,341 --> 01:10:42,890
And I will prove it.

486
01:10:44,775 --> 01:10:46,759
I'd like you there tonight.

487
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:16,873
Excuse me. Where can I find
Group captain Guy Sangster?

488
01:11:16,948 --> 01:11:18,809
He's in the chapel, sir.

489
01:11:34,271 --> 01:11:35,618
Hello, Guy.

490
01:11:38,516 --> 01:11:41,182
Wing Commander Vatan.

491
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:45,778
What do you want from me, Max?

492
01:11:46,179 --> 01:11:49,978
I'm finished. You people just
threw me away.

493
01:11:53,313 --> 01:11:54,954
I need your help.

494
01:11:58,487 --> 01:12:01,024
- I have a question.
- Yeah?

495
01:12:02,497 --> 01:12:03,881
Tough.

496
01:12:10,474 --> 01:12:12,324
I'm trusting you to tell no one
about-

497
01:12:12,527 --> 01:12:13,627
Fuck You!

498
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:17,347
I've been left here to fucking rot, Max!

499
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:23,576
You told me you were smuggled out
of France by Marianne Beausejour.

500
01:12:23,877 --> 01:12:25,690
Dieppe. 1941.

501
01:12:26,503 --> 01:12:28,042
Is this her?

502
01:12:29,582 --> 01:12:32,927
Why are you asking me
about your wife?

503
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:35,550
Guy, please, is this her?

504
01:12:36,777 --> 01:12:38,637
Ah, they didn't tell you.

505
01:12:41,213 --> 01:12:42,492
Max.

506
01:12:42,887 --> 01:12:44,914
My right eye has been shot out...

507
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:48,484
and my left retina is detached.

508
01:12:50,246 --> 01:12:52,940
All I can see is...

509
01:12:53,618 --> 01:12:55,161
A white...

510
01:12:55,563 --> 01:12:56,753
shape..

511
01:12:57,055 --> 01:12:58,186
Fuck.

512
01:12:59,417 --> 01:13:02,358
Well you know Max
If you had not sent me into a...

513
01:13:02,559 --> 01:13:05,603
strip. Covered in fucking
German Triple-A!

514
01:13:08,478 --> 01:13:12,268
My own son screamed when he saw me.

515
01:13:15,889 --> 01:13:17,710
I'm sorry Guy.

516
01:13:22,426 --> 01:13:23,475
Max?

517
01:13:24,895 --> 01:13:26,439
Delamare.

518
01:13:28,372 --> 01:13:31,958
Delamare is still operational in Dieppe.

519
01:13:38,949 --> 01:13:40,800
Hampstead 235.

520
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:44,182
Hi honey. I'm at the strip.

521
01:13:44,384 --> 01:13:47,474
They're asking people to give blood
after the raid, so I'm gonna be another hour.

522
01:13:47,574 --> 01:13:49,479
So, meet you at the pub after?

523
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,863
<i>Yes, I'll ask Mrs. Sinclair to
look after Anna.</i>

524
01:13:51,965 --> 01:13:54,511
- Ok, I love you. I'll see you there.
- Love you.

525
01:14:36,662 --> 01:14:38,212
Squad. Attention.

526
01:14:38,412 --> 01:14:40,771
Put two cases of scotch from
the officers crate in my car.

527
01:14:40,971 --> 01:14:42,172
Keep a bottle for yourself.

528
01:14:42,574 --> 01:14:44,801
- Whose flying Dieppe tonight?
- Hunter, Sir.

529
01:14:45,203 --> 01:14:47,414
- Where can I find Him?
- Try the shithouse, sir.

530
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:04,916
At ease.

531
01:15:06,132 --> 01:15:07,399
Sorry, sir.

532
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,002
Something I've eaten.

533
01:15:09,203 --> 01:15:10,844
These will settle your stomach.

534
01:15:11,746 --> 01:15:14,171
I'm going to save the amphetamines
until takeoff.

535
01:15:14,372 --> 01:15:16,381
Then the Barbituates when
I get back.

536
01:15:17,457 --> 01:15:18,952
If I get back.

537
01:15:21,984 --> 01:15:25,904
There's an operative in Dieppe.
His name is Paul Delamare. Do you know him?

538
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:28,900
No. This is my first time.

539
01:15:29,203 --> 01:15:30,599
First time to Dieppe?

540
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:34,244
First time behind enemy lines
ever, Sir.

541
01:15:37,378 --> 01:15:41,407
Paul Delamare runs the landing sites
You can't miss him. He only has one arm.

542
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:43,944
He usally have a few,
but he's ok.

543
01:15:44,246 --> 01:15:45,529
I want you to give him this.

544
01:15:45,729 --> 01:15:48,023
Give it only to him.
Only to the man with one arm.

545
01:15:49,881 --> 01:15:52,921
Tell him you need an answer.
A simple oui or no.

546
01:15:53,021 --> 01:15:54,023
Yes Sir.

547
01:15:55,474 --> 01:15:58,573
Wait for my call in the telegraph office.
I'll call you at midnight.

548
01:16:01,159 --> 01:16:02,769
This is classified.

549
01:16:03,369 --> 01:16:05,899
- No one must know, you understand?
- Yes, Sir.

550
01:16:06,301 --> 01:16:07,710
It's very important.

551
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:10,657
You can count on me, Sir.

552
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,020
The fields in Dieppe are
lined by Poplar trees.

553
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:16,072
They are invisible if
there's no moon, so...

554
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:19,222
- climb quickly.
- I know. I've been Briefed.

555
01:16:20,318 --> 01:16:21,639
Good.

556
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:24,735
Who are you thinking bout?

557
01:16:27,427 --> 01:16:28,826
My mother.

558
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:30,226
Don't...

559
01:16:30,467 --> 01:16:32,159
Think about your Father.

560
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:34,456
He's proud of you.

561
01:16:40,251 --> 01:16:41,533
Yes, Sir.

562
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,188
- I'm Sorry. Go ahead.
- Thank You.

563
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:32,113
Hey Billy. Two Brandies.

564
01:17:35,493 --> 01:17:36,766
Sorry.

565
01:17:39,609 --> 01:17:41,296
I've ordered three crates of bitter.

566
01:17:41,398 --> 01:17:44,003
Hazel? Filty pipe smoke.

567
01:17:46,943 --> 01:17:48,304
Thank You.

568
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:50,826
Did you get the whiskey?

569
01:17:51,027 --> 01:17:53,287
I did. Churchill's own.

570
01:17:55,702 --> 01:17:59,751
A husband would offer his wife
a cigarette before lighting his own.

571
01:18:09,305 --> 01:18:11,273
You did give blood!

572
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:13,948
Good.

573
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:18,266
I though perhaps you were
with your mistress.

574
01:18:18,967 --> 01:18:22,125
It would explain why you were
different with me last night.

575
01:18:23,007 --> 01:18:24,448
Different?

576
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:26,743
In bed.

577
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,619
It felt different.

578
01:18:37,556 --> 01:18:39,101
Good.

579
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:54,011
'Scuse me?

580
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:58,286
Me and my mates would really like
to see you two ladies kiss each other!

581
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,412
Max! This.. splendid.

582
01:19:24,757 --> 01:19:26,175
Marianne!

583
01:19:26,576 --> 01:19:29,067
Wonderful party. Brilliant!

584
01:19:30,417 --> 01:19:32,067
Getting enough to drink?

585
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:33,875
Very funny old man.

586
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:39,882
Hey! Excuse me? We have a garden for that
Take it outside. Please.

587
01:19:43,963 --> 01:19:46,899
Okay.
You two. Outside, Outside.

588
01:19:51,261 --> 01:19:53,737
My people are behaving so badly.

589
01:19:54,137 --> 01:19:57,851
I thought they would eat something,
Not just drink and have sex.

590
01:19:58,854 --> 01:20:02,552
Half of them I don't even know.
I think word's spread on Homestead.

591
01:20:02,854 --> 01:20:05,190
<i>C'est londres. C'est la guerre.</i>

592
01:20:09,275 --> 01:20:13,101
Would you go check no one
is actually fucking in Anna's room?

593
01:20:13,403 --> 01:20:14,404
Sure.

594
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:29,792
Max! Max, Max!

595
01:20:31,546 --> 01:20:32,962
Sorry.

596
01:20:35,802 --> 01:20:37,536
Listen.

597
01:20:37,622 --> 01:20:40,698
I have been briefed that you're operational but...

598
01:20:41,099 --> 01:20:43,817
I haven't been told
<i>why</i> you're operational.

599
01:20:44,115 --> 01:20:47,578
Now I thought as a friend I would just...

600
01:20:47,878 --> 01:20:50,046
give you a word of warning.

601
01:20:51,252 --> 01:20:55,154
If the job V-Section are offering you
is the one everyone's talking about...

602
01:20:55,668 --> 01:20:59,675
Max: if they want you to run the
resistance in France on D-day...

603
01:21:00,311 --> 01:21:02,412
You should know they
wouldn't just call you in

604
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:04,956
for a job interview,
they will test you somehow.

605
01:21:05,809 --> 01:21:07,104
Test?

606
01:21:07,467 --> 01:21:08,467
How?

607
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:11,064
Way way above my security clearance, Old Man.
But just..

608
01:21:12,189 --> 01:21:15,301
If I were you?
Tell em to stick their Job.

609
01:21:22,068 --> 01:21:23,269
Careful, Margaret.

610
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:40,033
Max.

611
01:21:40,467 --> 01:21:42,228
I was able to make it after all.

612
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:43,730
Frank!

613
01:21:43,931 --> 01:21:45,752
I didn't expect you.

614
01:21:46,304 --> 01:21:49,036
Please, introduce a little
sobriety to the affair.

615
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:53,132
I wasn't planning on doing anything of the sort.
Large Whiskey and soda, if you please.

616
01:21:53,333 --> 01:21:56,351
Would you get it honey?
Frank has his work face on.

617
01:21:57,115 --> 01:21:58,935
You keep chickens don't you?

618
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:01,814
Frank, you know too much.

619
01:22:02,015 --> 01:22:04,136
Show me your chickens, Max.

620
01:22:20,414 --> 01:22:23,609
You willfully and blatantly
disobeyed orders.

621
01:22:23,911 --> 01:22:27,011
First you visit Guy Sangster,
and burst half his bloody stitches-

622
01:22:27,313 --> 01:22:29,715
Frank, if it was your wife,
would you trust V-Section?

623
01:22:30,015 --> 01:22:33,682
Adam Hunter's Lysander was shot
to pieces three hours ago.

624
01:22:33,885 --> 01:22:35,896
on the ground.with him in it!

625
01:22:36,097 --> 01:22:37,734
He's dead!

626
01:22:38,511 --> 01:22:42,876
Because he stayed to long waiting for
an answer to an question from a drunk!

627
01:22:43,176 --> 01:22:45,381
Frank, tell me...

628
01:22:46,181 --> 01:22:48,555
- Is this a game?
- A game?

629
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:49,858
Game.

630
01:22:50,059 --> 01:22:51,296
A test.

631
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:59,506
I was just saying to Max: He's taken
to office life like a... duck to water.

632
01:23:01,172 --> 01:23:02,804
I wouldn't know.

633
01:23:03,005 --> 01:23:04,484
I hardly see him.

634
01:23:05,161 --> 01:23:07,104
Come on, Honey. Let's dance.

635
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:19,359
Frank brought you bad news?

636
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,875
Another boy dead.

637
01:23:26,264 --> 01:23:28,724
Something more than that, I think.

638
01:23:30,175 --> 01:23:34,427
I asked Bridget there was something
wrong with you. She said you were fine.

639
01:23:36,148 --> 01:23:38,680
But she's not trained to lie
like you and me.

640
01:23:44,194 --> 01:23:46,998
We've had a setback. I can't talk about it.

641
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:55,337
I think something's
burning in the oven.

642
01:23:55,537 --> 01:23:57,684
It could be the Stroganoff.

643
01:24:12,939 --> 01:24:14,738
Stand down, Flight Lieutenant.

644
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,860
- Margaret?
- Sir.

645
01:24:17,662 --> 01:24:20,837
- Is the Dieppe job still on tomorrow?
- Believe it is, Sir.

646
01:24:21,238 --> 01:24:23,921
- Forecast?
- Clear skies sir.

647
01:24:51,877 --> 01:24:52,881
Hey.

648
01:24:54,421 --> 01:24:56,917
The man with the pipe. Who is he?

649
01:24:57,118 --> 01:25:00,756
Oh his name is Lombard.
He has a jewelery shop on the high street.

650
01:25:01,059 --> 01:25:03,743
He was trying to sell me
a diamond brooch.

651
01:25:04,045 --> 01:25:06,185
But I told him we're broke.

652
01:25:08,494 --> 01:25:10,591
Hey! Where are you going?

653
01:25:11,092 --> 01:25:12,092
- Max!
- Marianne...

654
01:25:12,269 --> 01:25:14,426
- I really need to speak to you.
- Geoffrey, you're too drunk.

655
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:23,948
hey.

656
01:25:27,261 --> 01:25:29,487
Ah! The wife changed her mind.

657
01:25:29,961 --> 01:25:31,890
You mean about the earnings?

658
01:25:32,922 --> 01:25:35,756
No no no!
I was trying to sell her a Brooch.

659
01:25:36,157 --> 01:25:39,541
I do have some beautiful earrings.
I can offer you a very good price.

660
01:25:39,942 --> 01:25:40,945
Max.

661
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:45,716
Its okay Mr. Lombard.
We really are broke.

662
01:25:47,831 --> 01:25:49,260
Good night.

663
01:25:49,461 --> 01:25:50,747
Good night.

664
01:26:08,698 --> 01:26:10,658
I have to get Anna.

665
01:26:20,802 --> 01:26:23,970
I didn't hear a siren.
Where were the sirens?

666
01:26:25,738 --> 01:26:29,842
Now they sound.
They're like bloody ARP: always 2 steps behind.

667
01:26:30,243 --> 01:26:32,474
(Anxious crowd)

668
01:26:40,582 --> 01:26:42,500
They're targeting
the East End again.

669
01:26:45,478 --> 01:26:47,395
We should be alright here.

670
01:26:48,197 --> 01:26:50,349
Max, no more.

671
01:26:51,243 --> 01:26:52,644
Please?

672
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:55,818
By Monday morning, well...

673
01:26:56,019 --> 01:26:57,532
we'll know for sure.

674
01:26:59,524 --> 01:27:01,585
Try and get some rest.

675
01:27:03,537 --> 01:27:04,537
Frank?

676
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:05,931
It's not a game.

677
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,212
Even if it is...

678
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:15,219
V-Section wouldn't tell you.
Would they?

679
01:27:18,832 --> 01:27:20,667
They wouldn't tell you Frank.

680
01:27:27,478 --> 01:27:28,478
Look!

681
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,800
We got one!
Yes!...

682
01:27:54,804 --> 01:27:57,788
He's coming right towards us!
Everyone take cover!

683
01:28:01,238 --> 01:28:02,648
I'll take her!

684
01:28:06,886 --> 01:28:07,886
Max!

685
01:28:34,987 --> 01:28:36,688
- Will you get rid of everyone?
- Yeah.

686
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:46,141
Max?

687
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:51,976
Tomorrow we'll have
a whole day with Anna.

688
01:28:54,677 --> 01:28:56,327
Let's forget the war.

689
01:28:58,827 --> 01:29:00,970
Let's make the best day ever.

690
01:29:03,052 --> 01:29:04,052
Yeah.

691
01:29:05,748 --> 01:29:07,274
I'd like that.

692
01:30:23,747 --> 01:30:26,088
Who'll Jump First?

693
01:30:28,417 --> 01:30:30,930
I've lit a fire.
Come sit with us.

694
01:30:31,434 --> 01:30:32,471
This one?

695
01:31:05,953 --> 01:31:07,439
Flight Lieutenant!

696
01:31:08,006 --> 01:31:10,966
I have good news.
You have the night off.

697
01:31:11,167 --> 01:31:12,259
Yes sir.

698
01:35:26,967 --> 01:35:29,457
Look. Look closely.

699
01:35:29,623 --> 01:35:32,074
Is the women in this photograph
Marianne Beausejour?

700
01:35:32,252 --> 01:35:33,252
Who?

701
01:35:33,921 --> 01:35:35,671
Marianne Beausejour!

702
01:35:40,355 --> 01:35:42,030
Look is it her?

703
01:35:43,324 --> 01:35:46,489
- Give me the Bottle!
- Yes or No? then you get a drink.

704
01:35:46,690 --> 01:35:48,453
Marianne Beausejour?

705
01:35:52,141 --> 01:35:53,324
Look!

706
01:35:56,329 --> 01:35:59,252
- Yes?
- Yes! It's her.

707
01:35:59,263 --> 01:36:02,080
- Now let me have a drink.
- Look again. Are you sure?

708
01:36:02,182 --> 01:36:03,666
Fuck you!

709
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:05,925
Look!
Look!

710
01:36:06,126 --> 01:36:10,338
- She looked the same.
- Yes? She laughs a lot. Brown hair.

711
01:36:10,365 --> 01:36:13,005
- And she has brown eyes, yes?
- Right. Brown eyes.

712
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:16,873
- I said blue eyes! Goddamnit, blue eyes!
- Right! I meant blue.

713
01:36:16,984 --> 01:36:19,703
- Don't fuck with me Delamare!
- I made a mistake.

714
01:36:19,704 --> 01:36:22,372
- Look!
- She has blue eyes.

715
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:25,807
I know Sure.

716
01:36:26,551 --> 01:36:29,986
She is the life of the party.

717
01:36:30,269 --> 01:36:31,627
Go on.

718
01:36:32,093 --> 01:36:33,957
And she paints.

719
01:36:34,060 --> 01:36:36,480
Paints. Yes. She paints what?

720
01:36:36,782 --> 01:36:39,629
Wonderful watercolors

721
01:36:40,546 --> 01:36:42,046
That's right.

722
01:36:42,047 --> 01:36:44,706
Give me the bottle.

723
01:36:46,850 --> 01:36:50,912
And she plays the
piano like a goddess.

724
01:36:52,244 --> 01:36:53,882
Piano?

725
01:37:31,662 --> 01:37:33,466
I remember Marianne.

726
01:37:34,963 --> 01:37:37,032
I remember when I met her.

727
01:37:38,231 --> 01:37:41,231
It was in a cafe,
in Dordogne.

728
01:37:41,975 --> 01:37:45,078
The place was full
of German soldiers.

729
01:37:47,953 --> 01:37:50,087
There was a piano.

730
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:52,765
She went to it...

731
01:37:53,065 --> 01:37:54,858
and played "La Marseillaise"...

732
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:58,319
in front of all those Germans!

733
01:38:21,618 --> 01:38:22,672
Oye, Pierre!

734
01:38:23,675 --> 01:38:25,302
Lucky Strike?

735
01:40:48,773 --> 01:40:49,992
Marianne...

736
01:40:51,863 --> 01:40:54,018
I need you to come with me

737
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:00,729
Drop off Anna and come with
me now, please

738
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:10,238
What the hell are you doing?

739
01:41:28,452 --> 01:41:29,761
Marianne...

740
01:41:34,024 --> 01:41:36,351
I want you to play the piano for me.

741
01:41:37,939 --> 01:41:39,712
You want what?

742
01:41:41,402 --> 01:41:44,556
Why on earth would you want me
to play the piano?

743
01:41:46,837 --> 01:41:49,655
I want you to play the piano
because I love you.

744
01:41:52,485 --> 01:41:54,859
What are you talking about?

745
01:41:55,161 --> 01:41:57,831
You haven't slept. Let's go home.

746
01:42:06,146 --> 01:42:08,720
I want you to play "La Marseillaise".

747
01:42:12,523 --> 01:42:15,784
Now you've asked me
some strange things.

748
01:42:16,086 --> 01:42:17,262
Play.

749
01:42:27,949 --> 01:42:29,261
Marianne Beausejour...

750
01:42:29,462 --> 01:42:31,520
played "La Marseillaise.

751
01:42:32,021 --> 01:42:34,929
In a cafe full of Germans in '41.

752
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,149
I want you to play it for me.

753
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:12,796
I know the story.

754
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:17,542
She was a very brave women.

755
01:43:23,055 --> 01:43:25,680
I thought they wouldn't find me here.

756
01:43:25,881 --> 01:43:27,386
But they did.

757
01:43:27,787 --> 01:43:29,875
They threatened Anna.

758
01:43:30,176 --> 01:43:33,162
And I'm...
I am so sorry.

759
01:43:35,608 --> 01:43:37,122
I am so sorry.

760
01:43:40,154 --> 01:43:41,713
Did you send it?

761
01:43:43,528 --> 01:43:45,689
The message! Did you send it?

762
01:43:48,873 --> 01:43:50,415
Yes.

763
01:43:59,592 --> 01:44:01,577
I am sorry.

764
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:07,337
I need to know...

765
01:44:07,738 --> 01:44:09,238
Is this real?

766
01:44:10,648 --> 01:44:11,962
Do you love me?

767
01:44:13,298 --> 01:44:15,425
I love you. I love you.

768
01:44:16,301 --> 01:44:19,341
I've loved you since Casablanca.

769
01:44:27,609 --> 01:44:30,389
OK, listen to me.
This is how it'll be.

770
01:44:31,042 --> 01:44:33,185
There is a Medicine Hat in...

771
01:44:33,387 --> 01:44:35,877
Switzerland or Peru
or wherever the hell.

772
01:44:36,078 --> 01:44:37,586
We won't make it.

773
01:44:37,773 --> 01:44:41,841
If we stay one more hour,
V-Section's gonna order me to kill you.

774
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:45,037
And when I refuse,
they're gonna shoot us both.

775
01:44:45,439 --> 01:44:46,887
You understand?

776
01:44:48,373 --> 01:44:49,393
We go now.

777
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:55,582
We have to get Anna.

778
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,721
Where is Marianne?

779
01:45:12,412 --> 01:45:14,672
You use my child as collateral?

780
01:45:16,875 --> 01:45:20,662
You've done far worse,
Wing commander Vatan.

781
01:45:21,064 --> 01:45:22,810
Who else is watching us?

782
01:45:23,112 --> 01:45:26,738
<i>Icn bin einen agent des Reiches.</i>

783
01:45:28,838 --> 01:45:30,338
I would only give you my na-

784
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:34,985
(baby cries)

785
01:45:35,185 --> 01:45:36,785
Come here sweetheart.

786
01:48:11,534 --> 01:48:14,242
Very good, Sir.
You are free to pass.

787
01:48:59,707 --> 01:49:00,893
Wait here.

788
01:50:46,337 --> 01:50:47,882
It's over, Max!

789
01:50:51,171 --> 01:50:54,445
The Blue Dye came back positive..
But you already know that, don't you?

790
01:50:54,765 --> 01:50:55,765
Frank, wait!

791
01:50:56,389 --> 01:50:58,595
Wait! Let me explain!

792
01:50:58,895 --> 01:51:01,439
- The circuit's been cleaned.
- Max Vatan!

793
01:51:01,942 --> 01:51:04,065
In the name is His Majesty,
King George VI...

794
01:51:04,266 --> 01:51:05,668
The had her boxed in, Frank!

795
01:51:05,869 --> 01:51:07,319
I charge you with High Treason!

796
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,644
No! Please!

797
01:51:08,845 --> 01:51:12,734
For aiding and abetting a German
spy known as Marianne Beausejour.

798
01:51:12,935 --> 01:51:16,417
She had no choice!
They would have killed us all.

799
01:51:16,618 --> 01:51:19,159
Max! You lost your mind
to the German spy!

800
01:51:19,261 --> 01:51:22,569
I won't let you do this Frank.
I've done my duty. I cleaned the circuit.

801
01:51:22,770 --> 01:51:24,444
They had valuable information Damn You!

802
01:51:24,645 --> 01:51:26,734
We had no choice!
They threatened Anna!

803
01:51:26,935 --> 01:51:28,706
If you want to get
away from this...

804
01:51:30,021 --> 01:51:31,970
- Then do what needs to be done.
- We had no choice!

805
01:51:32,171 --> 01:51:35,712
She had no choice! They had her boxed in!
They would have killed us all!

806
01:51:36,014 --> 01:51:37,567
The section won't care!

807
01:51:37,768 --> 01:51:39,161
They threatened Anna!

808
01:51:39,362 --> 01:51:41,994
For your child's sake
don't throw your life away!

809
01:51:42,195 --> 01:51:45,494
We did our duty Just walk away.
Walk away Frank

810
01:51:45,695 --> 01:51:46,698
Max.

811
01:51:59,046 --> 01:52:00,493
I love you.

812
01:52:03,395 --> 01:52:05,421
Take good care of her.

813
01:53:18,717 --> 01:53:20,097
Stand Down!

814
01:53:22,273 --> 01:53:23,913
Wing commander Vatan executed...

815
01:53:24,115 --> 01:53:26,533
the enemy agent with his
own hand.

816
01:53:29,073 --> 01:53:31,108
That is how you'll report it.

817
01:53:32,466 --> 01:53:34,015
That is an order.

818
01:54:16,755 --> 01:54:19,565
<i>My dearest, darling Anna.</i>

819
01:54:26,311 --> 01:54:29,529
<i>I'm writing this on a
Sunday night in London.</i>

820
01:54:32,722 --> 01:54:34,742
<i>If you're reading this...</i>

821
01:54:35,042 --> 01:54:37,067
<i>then you barely knew me.</i>

822
01:54:37,668 --> 01:54:39,837
<i>And may have no memory of who I am.</i>

823
01:54:42,041 --> 01:54:43,980
I am your Mother.

824
01:54:45,509 --> 01:54:48,498
<i>You were born in an Air raid
in the middle of a war</i>

825
01:54:49,618 --> 01:54:52,326
<i>To two people who
loved each other.</i>

826
01:54:55,547 --> 01:54:58,514
<i>Our year together in the house in
Hampsted has been the...</i>

827
01:54:58,716 --> 01:55:00,921
<i>happiest time of my life.</i>

828
01:55:07,811 --> 01:55:10,213
Today you took your first steps.

829
01:55:14,698 --> 01:55:17,475
<i>I am so grateful that I saw
you walk for the 1st time</i>

830
01:55:17,777 --> 01:55:19,832
with your father by my side.

831
01:55:23,532 --> 01:55:25,162
Max, My love...

832
01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:29,148
<i>you are my world.</i>

833
01:55:35,104 --> 01:55:38,082
I hope you will be able to forgive me.

834
01:55:40,033 --> 01:55:42,576
I hope you make it to Medicine Hat.

835
01:55:46,997 --> 01:55:49,244
<i>I have a picture of it in my mind...</i>

836
01:55:50,381 --> 01:55:53,203
<i>and I pray Anna's eyes will see it.</i>

837
01:55:57,212 --> 01:55:59,228
<i>My beautiful daughter...</i>

838
01:56:00,788 --> 01:56:03,112
I love you with all my heart.

839
01:56:06,869 --> 01:56:09,462
<i>I hope you will live your life in peace.</i>

840
01:56:11,814 --> 01:56:16,354
<i>I rest - knowing your father
will take good care of you.</i>

841
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,835
<i>And I remain Your Loving Mother,</i>

842
01:56:26,247 --> 01:56:27,804
<i>Marianne Vatan.</i>
