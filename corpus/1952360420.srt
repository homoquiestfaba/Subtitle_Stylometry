1
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:24,982
To be a great writer, You have
to observe people... carefully.

2
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:27,301
Some might even call it spying.

3
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:31,222
You watch your subjects, Eavesdrop
on their conversations,

4
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:34,108
And it's acceptable because you're a writer.

5
00:00:34,142 --> 00:00:36,310
It's your job to document the truth,

6
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:39,196
No matter how silly the truth might be.

7
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:45,152
Most of the people I watch have secrets.

8
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:47,872
It's up to a writer to reveal those secrets,

9
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:53,327
And someday I, Harriet m.
Welch, Will be a world famous writer.

10
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:11,278
Oh, so that's how you do that?

11
00:01:20,155 --> 00:01:21,422
What is that?

12
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,107
What is what?

13
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:24,992
I said, what is that?

14
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:27,495
I always have a tomato sandwich,

15
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:29,580
And this isn't a tomato sandwich.

16
00:01:29,614 --> 00:01:30,581
Yes it is.

17
00:01:30,615 --> 00:01:31,916
No it's not.

18
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,918
Golly, your help here, please?

19
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,287
"You can fool some of the
people All of the time..."

20
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:38,439
"And all of the people some of the time..."

21
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,840
"But you can't fool all of the people..."

22
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,543
"All of the time." Abraham Lincoln!

23
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:46,413
My nanny since forever, And
the only person in the world

24
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:48,482
Who even remotely understands me.

25
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:52,787
This is my version Of your
mundane tomato sandwich.

26
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:57,525
My mother's in-house food guru
Slash personal trainer...

27
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,426
And my sworn adversary.

28
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,361
I won't eat this.

29
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:08,502
Thank you.

30
00:02:08,537 --> 00:02:11,405
You have the food appreciation of a two-year-old!

31
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:14,041
How was your route?

32
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:15,376
I got some good material.

33
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,827
I'll tell you about it when we're alone.

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,781
I am so glad mid-term break is over.

35
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:25,452
Hmm.

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,269
Ever since I can remember, I have
watched the people around me

37
00:02:42,303 --> 00:02:44,171
And written down my findings.

38
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,307
I've observed a lot over the years,

39
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:48,475
Faithfully and secretly recording everything

40
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:50,444
In my beloved notebooks.

41
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:53,814
But this term, I've decided to
finally share my observations

42
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:57,334
With the public, When I win the
role of official class blogger

43
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:59,887
For our school blog.

44
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:02,256
Private property of...

45
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:07,828
Lights out, Harriet.

46
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:13,601
?

47
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:18,639
In an average everyday school,
In an average everyday town...

48
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:22,476
Average everyday students Live
their average everyday lives...

49
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,211
Except one.

50
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,479
Come in, Jake Jones.

51
00:03:25,513 --> 00:03:26,697
On my way!

52
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:28,866
Skander hill is Jake Jones

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,986
In the international smash hit, "spy teen!"

54
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,038
High school honour student by day...

55
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:35,689
International secret agent by night.

56
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:39,460
I spy with my little eye...

57
00:03:39,494 --> 00:03:43,364
And in this special karaoke DVD edition of "spy teen,"

Own the karaoke edition DVD and blu ray now!

63
00:03:58,313 --> 00:04:01,148
Skander hill is yet another prime example

64
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:04,985
Of society's downfall towards lowbrow commercialism.

65
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:08,322
The little finks contract for months

66
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:11,575
And now he's got a whole list of new ridiculous demands.

67
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,244
The only thing my father loves more than his job

68
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,964
Is complaining about his job.

69
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:19,083
He produces movies for a living,

70
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:20,701
But he acts like he's trying to uncover

71
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:22,436
The mysteries of Stonehenge.

72
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:25,589
No he's not.

73
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,474
No you're not, dear.

74
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:28,642
My mother.

75
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:29,944
You'd think from all the texting

76
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,781
That she ran a multinational
corporation, But she doesn't.

77
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,250
She just sits on a lot of boards.

78
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:37,685
Well, with any luck,

79
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:42,456
We'll find out today if he'll sign or not, so...

80
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,974
Oh, here it comes.

81
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:45,309
You can tell the rant's gonna be bad

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,761
When his eye starts twitching like that.

83
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:50,481
A grapefruit shaped like a bird?

84
00:04:50,532 --> 00:04:54,435
I mean... Do I have to
subsist on this until lunch?

85
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,203
Tomato, right? Just tomato?

86
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:57,237
Yes.

87
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:01,125
Chef and I are trying to introduce

88
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:04,378
A more advanced gastronomy to this family.

89
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:05,746
If I find out this bread is imported

90
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,247
From anywhere other than the corner deli,

91
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,416
I'm gonna be seriously ticked off!

92
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:15,489
Harriet, 1; chef, 0.

93
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:18,158
Hey!

94
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:19,326
Oh hey.

95
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,844
So... where's golly?

96
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:21,862
At home.

97
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:24,848
Mix? You don't mix. You never mix.

98
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,066
You hate to mix.

99
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:30,004
This is Janie, One of my two
best friends in the world.

100
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,972
She's a total "eco-geek."

101
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,159
Last year, she strapped herself to the cafeteria garbage can

102
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:38,145
In protest of the school's overuse of styrofoam.

103
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:40,447
Well, for me, the new term is all about change.

104
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:41,949
New possibilities.

105
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,952
At basketball tryouts.

106
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:47,621
This is my other best friend, Simon,

107
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:49,289
But everyone calls him sport.

108
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:51,992
Can you imagine?

109
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,662
Your nickname is sport and you can't play sports.

110
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,468
Converting corn husks into fuel

111
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:04,271
And winning the Nobel Prize in chemistry.

112
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:05,556
And you, Harriet?

113
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:08,776
I am 100 percent focused On
becoming the new class blogger.

114
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,110
This term it shall be mine.

115
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:12,112
Oh yes, it will be mine.

116
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:13,714
Sure.

117
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,850
And, uh... How exactly do
you plan on overthrowing

118
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:22,856
Yeah. The whole thing's about how popular you are

119
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:24,458
And fyi, we're not.

120
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,995
Well, up until now, Popularity's
equaled dictatorship.

121
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,214
And last time I checked, We
lived in a glorious democracy

122
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:31,999
And my voice will be heard.

123
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,636
Oh, there he is again.

124
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,890
Skander hill - teen idol and a huge nemesis.

125
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:42,209
Right up there with chef, cauliflower,

126
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:45,145
And the entire "spy teen" musical franchise.

127
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,048
You have the new "spy teen" cell phone skin?

128
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:48,849
Jealous!

129
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,284
Yeah! Amazing!

130
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:51,452
Did you hear?

131
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:54,388
Skander and his spy teen co-star are officially an item!

132
00:06:56,424 --> 00:06:58,992
As if you have a chance, Beth Ellen.

133
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,461
Anyways, they're so cute together.

134
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:01,462
They're adorable.

135
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:02,946
Yeah, totally.

136
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:07,284
What, Harriet?

137
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:08,869
Marion Hawthorne -

138
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:12,206
The reigning class blogger and my supreme nemesis.

139
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,759
Of course she loves Skander hill.

140
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,010
He's an idiot.

141
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:18,212
He's hot.

142
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:20,597
Not! A spy who sings and dances?

143
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,249
Yeah, 'cause that's plausible!

144
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:26,019
He's a complete fink! Totally vomit-inducing!

145
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:29,456
All right.

146
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:30,891
There's one last order of business

147
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:34,862
That I know some of you have been waiting for.

148
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,163
The class blog.

149
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,167
Now, the blog is your forum.

150
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:43,337
It is completely confidential.

151
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:46,707
Only Westview school students can read it

152
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:49,076
Using their school password.

153
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:54,882
We need to assign a new class blogger this term.

154
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,917
So, let's have nominations, please.

155
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:59,052
I nominate Marion Hawthorne.

156
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,090
I second it.

157
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:09,096
I nominate Harriet Welch.

158
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,298
I second it.

159
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:13,734
All right. In the interest of democracy,

160
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,303
We're going to try something different this term.

161
00:08:18,506 --> 00:08:22,776
Marion...
And Harriet will share the job.

162
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,379
You will both write blogs and at the end of the month,

163
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:26,980
We'll take a vote.

164
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:28,782
Now whomever the class thinks

165
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:33,086
Has managed to get the most student
participation And discussion

166
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:36,456
Will win the coveted title of official class blogger

167
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:38,559
For the rest of the year.

168
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:42,846
Harriet, 1; Marion, 0.

169
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:49,052
Okay. You and Marion are in head-to-head competition.

170
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:50,337
What're you gonna write about?

171
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,722
I have some ideas.

172
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:53,190
I've been documenting my observations

173
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:54,691
On the human condition in my notebooks

174
00:08:54,726 --> 00:08:56,543
Since I could hold a pencil.

175
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,445
Right. The notebooks.

176
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:00,981
The notebook you never let anyone touch let alone read.

177
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:03,016
So, why the sudden need to share?

178
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,453
For my brilliant prose.

179
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:10,490
What?! Already?!

180
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:14,928
"Thoughts on the first day of a new term.

181
00:09:14,963 --> 00:09:16,863
We're so lucky to have ms. Elson as our teacher.

182
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:18,048
She's awesome."

183
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:19,049
What a kiss-up!

184
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,435
And you're surprised because...?

185
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:23,253
My blogs aren't gonna be about school.

186
00:09:23,304 --> 00:09:25,372
They're going to reveal truths about human nature,

187
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:26,807
Be thought-provoking.

188
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:30,761
Okay, people, You could be witnessing
environmental history here.

189
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:44,324
Um...

190
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,957
You guys better, uh, go.

191
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,344
Yes, Janie might save the earth...

192
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,713
If she doesn't blow it up first.

193
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:07,714
My heart is melting.

194
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:09,749
?'

195
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:11,385
One night is all we got.

196
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:12,886
And there's no time to stop.

197
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,121
We think about the "should we".

198
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,222
Or "should we not"

199
00:10:15,256 --> 00:10:18,091
And I know that you got a man.

200
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:20,927
But I'm here so put me in your plans...

201
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:22,896
Hey, coop.

202
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:27,534
Uh... he had somewhere else to go.

203
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:33,040
Strawberry banana smoothie with a slice of pineapple.

204
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:35,125
Thank you.

205
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,377
It's Harriet! Come, sit.

206
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:40,514
You should totally start hanging out with us.

207
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,666
You want me to hang out with you?

208
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:44,251
Of course, silly.

209
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:47,521
Being the class blogger has its perks, you know.

210
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:49,639
Oh! I am so sorry!

211
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:51,091
Just give it to me, I can clean it.

212
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,676
What do you write in here?

213
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:53,460
No-no-no-no-no!

214
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:55,145
Ladies.

215
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,101
Nanny saves the day!

216
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:03,020
I can't believe she still has a nanny!

217
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:05,105
How old is she? Like five?

218
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:07,607
How did you know I was here?

219
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:09,343
Oh, come on, Harriet.

220
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,945
Your routine isn't that hard to crack.

221
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:13,580
You might wanna mix it up a bit!

222
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:14,614
I mix.

223
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:19,853
So, am I looking at the new class blogger?

224
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:21,538
Sort of.

225
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:22,989
Good for you!

226
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,993
A literary outlet is a wonderful thing.

227
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:30,330
"By words the mind is winged."

228
00:11:30,365 --> 00:11:31,732
Aristophanes.

229
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:32,699
Very good.

230
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:44,945
I think you're too old to care about what other people say.

231
00:11:44,979 --> 00:11:45,946
I don't!

232
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,649
I don't care what they say
about me, or you, Or us.

233
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:52,185
But maybe as I get older We
can just change the "nanny"

234
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,322
To "guardian" or "manager,"

235
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:56,556
Or "bodyguard."

236
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:01,094
Oh, Harriet.

237
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:04,714
You know, there'll come a time in the not-too-distant future

238
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:08,368
When you'll realize that you don't need me anymore.

239
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:11,888
And that's when we'll both know
That it's time for me to go.

240
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:13,440
Well, that time isn't now.

241
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:22,649
It's on! The deal is done!

242
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:32,459
What deal?

243
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:34,494
The star has agreed to my terms.

244
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,396
Terms for what?

245
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:37,697
That's fabulous!

246
00:12:37,731 --> 00:12:39,499
I told you it would all work out.

247
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:40,867
What would work out?!

248
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:43,003
They're coming over tonight to sign the contracts.

249
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,112
Harriet, don't ask anymore questions.

250
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,215
And you, don't spill the beans.

251
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,891
All will be revealed soon!

252
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,277
How is it that I've lived my entire life with my parents?

253
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:09,062
And still know nothing about them?

254
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:10,864
And you wanna know the scariest thing of all?

255
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:12,265
They don't know me either!

256
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,202
Well, does anyone ever truly know anyone?

257
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:17,404
I know you, don't I?

258
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:18,705
Do you?

259
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:22,309
Who's here?

260
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,010
A surprise. Come on.

261
00:13:27,582 --> 00:13:28,832
Harriet!

262
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:31,485
What's the big deal?

263
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,323
Well, for someone your age,
This is a very big deal.

264
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:40,560
You know salamander helm, right?

265
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:43,864
Skander Hill?!

266
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:46,516
Exactly!

267
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:50,803
The sequel."

268
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:54,658
It has. It has.

269
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:55,692
And let me tell you, guys,

270
00:13:55,743 --> 00:13:58,111
I am looking forward to making this picture

271
00:13:58,145 --> 00:13:59,446
A total home run! Huh?!

272
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:01,381
Ugh...

273
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,036
I never thought of Harriet as the shy type.

274
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,988
It must be puppy love.

275
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:11,658
I'll show you out.

276
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:13,426
What a hoot!

277
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,017
How could they do this to me?

278
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:21,902
Why'd they have to let him in?

279
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:23,136
Why'd he have to show up at my door

280
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,021
With his perfectly tousled hair?

281
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:28,475
Ugh. We need to disinfect the vestibule immediately.

282
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,977
"I just experienced a home invasion -

283
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:33,313
Skander hill in my front hall,

284
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:36,182
Fashionably scruffy, aloofly bored."

285
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:41,187
That's pretty good, Harriet. You really got him.

286
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:43,957
Harriet?

287
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:56,169
Oh! Harriet?!

288
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:58,338
Don't sneak up like that.

289
00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:00,874
Dad, you can't do it.

290
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:05,245
Oh, okay, yes, I know they're
bad for me, but I like them.

291
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,764
No, not that.

292
00:15:07,815 --> 00:15:09,449
Then what? What can't I do?

293
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:11,318
"Spy teen the sequel."

294
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,720
Isn't time for you to be in bed?

295
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:15,822
Dad, you've got to understand that if you do this film,

296
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:17,890
It'll be the single most humiliating thing

297
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:20,727
That could possibly happen
to me In my entire lifetime.

298
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:22,929
Really? Wow.

299
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,666
I would've thought you'd have been thrilled about this.

300
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:29,502
This the biggest teen franchise in the world.

301
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,404
It's garbage.

302
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:35,375
Well, it's business. My business, my dear Harriet,

303
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,577
And I need this contract, badly.

304
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:40,280
I know, but it's just- Yeah,
can you please go to bed?

305
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,881
It's late.

306
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,216
These really are bad for you.

307
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,584
Harriet, I need those!

308
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:47,954
It's completely humiliating

309
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,190
That my dad has anything to do with "spy teen."

310
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:53,026
Promise me on your souls that you will not tell anybody!

311
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,528
So my mom saw your mom at the manicurist yesterday

312
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:57,764
And my mom told me that your mom told her

313
00:15:57,798 --> 00:16:00,233
That your dad is producing the new Skander hill movie.

314
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,568
Is that true?

315
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,171
Your dad is producing "spy teen the sequel"?

316
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,623
That is so cool!

317
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:07,741
Is that true?

318
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:10,410
Or...
Is it just a big fat lie?

319
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:11,578
Well.

320
00:16:11,612 --> 00:16:13,963
Nice to see you girls working together.

321
00:16:13,998 --> 00:16:16,449
I assume you're discussing the blog.

322
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:18,518
Harriet, when are you posting?

323
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:21,321
Now's your chance to show us what you've got.

324
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,325
Your masterpiece.

325
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,161
You think you know people, but you really don't.

326
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,796
Like this artist I know;

327
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,901
While some use paint and canvas,
His medium of choice is the con.

328
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:37,470
He's managed to convince this unsuspecting model

329
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:38,738
That she's his muse.

330
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:42,792
And in turn, She supports
his art with a lot of cash.

331
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:46,379
If that isn't bad enough...
He's fooled other models, too.

332
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:49,199
Who knows how many victims he's got out there?

333
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,018
The only kind of artist who does something like this...

334
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,353
Is a scam artist.

335
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,821
My muse!

336
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:01,261
Just another observation about
life from me, Harriet m. Welch.

337
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,045
Two hits, no comments.

338
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,982
Hmm... Well, maybe
nobody's reading today.

339
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:28,388
What? 25 hits for this drivel?!

340
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,390
Ugh!

341
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:40,083
Nice blog, Harriet.

342
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:46,089
There are people in this world who shouldn't have pets,

343
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,576
Especially those who care more
about image Than substance.

344
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,244
Doggy day nursery makes a point of personally speaking

345
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,412
To every applicant.

346
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,848
We only accept the best.

347
00:17:54,882 --> 00:17:57,650
I believe I will be submitting my recommendation.

348
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,252
You won't regret it. Mitzy is-

349
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:02,856
Wet.

350
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,026
Take Tiffany and Preston, Their
darling offspring has four legs,

351
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,529
A walnut-sized brain, and a perfect pedigree,

352
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:13,249
But that doesn't mean it's potty trained.

353
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:17,837
Just another observation about
life from me, Harriet m. Welch.

354
00:18:25,346 --> 00:18:28,782
Yes! 30 hits and comments!

355
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:33,553
Who are these people anyway?

356
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:34,587
Bo-ring!

357
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:38,191
Harriet's all talk and no show.

358
00:18:38,225 --> 00:18:40,643
Marion!

359
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:41,895
This is brutal.

360
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,446
I thought I would've gotten them with that last one.

361
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:46,299
I mean, tiffany and Preston are classic!

362
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,600
You didn't read it?

363
00:18:47,635 --> 00:18:48,902
Oh, we read it.

364
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:51,437
But it was kinda boring.

365
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:53,873
Ah, Harriet.

366
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:59,445
I've received some feedback
From some members of the class.

367
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,481
Perhaps you're a little overwhelmed.

368
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,616
Maybe Marion should take the reins for a while.

369
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:06,118
After all, she has so much
more experience With the blog.

370
00:19:06,136 --> 00:19:07,220
No. please, Ms. Elson.

371
00:19:07,254 --> 00:19:08,922
I'm just getting the hang of it.

372
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:11,457
Okay, but remember, make it involving,

373
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,693
Spark conversation! All right?

374
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:15,428
That's what it's all about.

375
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:22,068
Did you hear about Arron?

376
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:23,870
I can't even believe he did that.

377
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:27,190
To Marion.

378
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:29,108
The destined and true class blogger!

379
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:30,026
To Marion.

380
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,947
See? I give up.

381
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:35,248
Well, you can't.

382
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:37,584
Because the Harriet m. Welch that I know is not a quitter,

383
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:39,986
Nor would I allow her to be one.

384
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:42,154
Look, maybe you just need to rethink.

385
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:44,224
I mean, maybe these people that you write about

386
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:47,343
Are important to you, But
not to everyone else.

387
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:49,529
But you said writers write about what they know;

388
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,714
I know everything there is to know about these people.

389
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:54,000
And you also said, and I quote,

390
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:59,706
And have no public, Than write for
the public and have no self."

391
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,442
So maybe the key is to write about what you know,

392
00:20:02,476 --> 00:20:07,113
But write about things That other
people can relate to as well.

393
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:10,750
Beat her at her own game.

394
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:12,869
What are the kids at school interested in?

395
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:13,903
Mediocrity.

396
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,424
I'm an individual in a world of followers.

397
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,543
Hey, Harriet. Golly.

398
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:22,862
Hey, coop. what's up?

399
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,130
Don't ask.

400
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:26,165
I lost another babysitter.

401
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:28,718
Oh...
Couldn't cope with four kids.

402
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:36,926
But remember, I have offered to help you anytime you need.

403
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:40,263
Well, did you give any thought to my idea?

404
00:20:41,348 --> 00:20:42,348
Not yet.

405
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,019
Hey! I got a new shipment in!

406
00:20:46,053 --> 00:20:48,388
You might be interested, Harriet.

407
00:20:48,422 --> 00:20:49,923
Hot off the presses!

408
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,826
The kids really love this Skander
fellow, Especially the girls.

409
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,962
They can't get enough of him.

410
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:58,498
I swear, his name is what I hear all day long.

411
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,283
Skander, Skander, Skander!

412
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,970
Skander, Skander, Skander!

413
00:21:07,174 --> 00:21:10,109
Have you ever experienced a home invasion?

414
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,377
I have.

415
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:16,482
Skander hill, standing in my
front hall, Live and in person,

416
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:19,819
With his perfectly tousled hair,
Looking fashionably scruffy

417
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:25,191
In his signature untucked shirt,
Ratty old jacket and sunglasses.

418
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:30,696
All studied, all practiced, All
of the above equals fake fink.

419
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:32,565
Just my opinion.

420
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,534
Come on, come on, come on.

421
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:10,836
70 hits?! Yes!

422
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,608
I can't believe you met him!

423
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:16,642
Yeah, I can't believe it!

424
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:18,410
I didn't exactly...
What'd he say?

425
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:25,584
He's kind of a fink. Did you not read my entry?

426
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,419
Harriet, you're hilarious!

427
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:29,722
Yeah, totally hilarious.

428
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:31,824
All right, people, sit down, please.

429
00:22:31,858 --> 00:22:33,175
Thank you.

430
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:36,712
Harriet, I see your blog entry has gotten quite a reaction.

431
00:22:36,763 --> 00:22:39,831
Love to see so much class discussion!

432
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:44,370
Are you claiming you know Skander hill personally?

433
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,640
It is a writer's prerogative to embellish the truth

434
00:22:47,674 --> 00:22:49,675
When he or she sees fit, right?

435
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:51,843
My father is producing his movie, isn't he?

436
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:53,812
Of course I know Skander hill.

437
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:58,367
Why did I even say that?

438
00:22:58,401 --> 00:22:59,618
I don't know him.

439
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:01,587
I can barely stand the sight of him without gagging.

440
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,710
To writing about the people on my route.

441
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:11,863
What?

442
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,769
Uh, Harriet, as your friends...
We wouldn't advise that.

443
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:18,370
If you want to beat Marion,

444
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:21,573
You should keep writing about Skander.

445
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:24,393
Keep talking.

446
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:27,646
All these girls can blab on and on about is Skander hill

447
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:29,348
And how amazing and perfect is,

448
00:23:29,382 --> 00:23:30,849
But you can expose him for the fool

449
00:23:30,883 --> 00:23:33,085
He is guaranteed to be in real life.

450
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,790
Write about Skander hill...
A completely uncensored expose.

451
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,627
I could burst Marion And her
disciples' Skander bubble

452
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:43,445
And keep the blog all to myself.

453
00:23:43,496 --> 00:23:44,296
It's a win-win.

454
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,166
You've got to get all the
dirt And secrets you can.

455
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,201
Yeah! And we can help.

456
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:50,636
No.

457
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,670
I work alone.

458
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:00,929
From horrible Marion Hawthorne.

459
00:24:00,964 --> 00:24:03,582
Oh. And how're you gonna manage that?

460
00:24:03,616 --> 00:24:04,850
I took your advice.

461
00:24:04,884 --> 00:24:07,119
Found some common ground.

462
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:10,773
Those "pennies for the poor" people

463
00:24:10,807 --> 00:24:13,308
Are so selfish with their time.

464
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,197
Uh, mom? Can I talk to you?

465
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:23,435
I'll be outside... stretching!

466
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:26,321
Be right with you.

467
00:24:27,323 --> 00:24:29,074
Yes, Harriet?

468
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:31,777
Can you talk daddy into letting
me Go to work with him tomorrow?

469
00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:35,314
I know it's a Saturday, But
they're still shooting, right?

470
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:41,320
Well, daddy's always so busy.

471
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,688
I never get to see him.

472
00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:44,006
And don't they say that one of the keys

473
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:46,091
To successful childhood development

474
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:50,629
Is the presence of a strong paternal figurehead?

475
00:24:54,317 --> 00:24:57,603
And sport and his dad play basketball.

476
00:24:57,637 --> 00:25:00,105
I really think my self-esteem is suffering.

477
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:03,742
Oh, honey.

478
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:06,512
I will talk to your father.

479
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:16,021
I think someone has a crush on chandler hilt.

480
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:17,489
Skander hill?

481
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:18,690
Exactly.

482
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,728
Hmm.

483
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:26,799
Come to the set?

484
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,834
No, she can't come to the set.

485
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:30,068
Why not?

486
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:35,240
Plus, you know, Skander is insane about his privacy.

487
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:36,725
I don't want to mess anything up.

488
00:25:36,776 --> 00:25:38,644
Roger, this is the first time

489
00:25:38,678 --> 00:25:41,613
That Harriet has shown any interest in your job.

490
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:44,650
You should bend over backwards to make it happen.

491
00:25:44,684 --> 00:25:45,818
The bottom line is,

492
00:25:45,852 --> 00:25:48,353
You don't spend enough time with your daughter.

493
00:25:48,388 --> 00:25:51,857
Well, that's not true. I spend tons of time!

494
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,409
All I know is that father/daughter bonding time

495
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,262
Is an important key to a child's development.

496
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:01,433
But you're at an office all day.

497
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:03,135
Okay! Fine!

498
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:04,837
Fine, you win.

499
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:07,706
And, you know, maybe... maybe you're right.

500
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,892
Maybe it'd be good to, you know,

501
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:12,744
Let her see what dear old dad does for a living.

502
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,780
Exactly. So, it's settled.

503
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:16,782
The three of you will go tomorrow morning!

504
00:26:16,816 --> 00:26:18,851
Three?

505
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:20,686
Obviously, golly will go along.

506
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,323
Oh, obviously. Yes, obviously.

507
00:26:26,776 --> 00:26:28,443
Really good, yeah.

508
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:31,163
Well, I should know more tomorrow, coop.

509
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:34,433
No, I won't keep you in suspense.

510
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:13,071
Okay, Harriet.

511
00:27:15,491 --> 00:27:16,575
I will take you there.

512
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:18,160
Okay. But you gotta promise me

513
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:19,461
You're gonna stay in the background.

514
00:27:19,495 --> 00:27:20,329
Yeah, of course.

515
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,213
Okay?

516
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:22,447
Mr. Welch! Hey, hi!

517
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:23,548
So glad you're here!

518
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:24,650
There's a big problem in props.

519
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,834
They need you right away.

520
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,219
Well, can't someone else deal with it?

521
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:28,453
We need someone down here, stat!

522
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:30,005
The master just malfunctioned.

523
00:27:30,056 --> 00:27:31,506
Tell roger to get over here now!

524
00:27:33,393 --> 00:27:35,661
Duty calls. Uh... tim?

525
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,428
Yeah.

526
00:27:36,462 --> 00:27:37,796
This is my daughter, Harriet.

527
00:27:37,814 --> 00:27:39,181
Hi. Nice to meet you.

528
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:40,849
And this is her nanny, golly.

529
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,017
Hey.

530
00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:43,602
Now, I need you to take them to set,

531
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:46,355
But you know how Skander hates visitors, correct?

532
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:48,774
Mm-hm. yes? We know this? All right, so please stay low.

533
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:49,908
You got it, boss!

534
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,277
Wanna go?

535
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:53,295
Yeah.

536
00:27:54,514 --> 00:27:55,847
So, the boss' daughter, huh?

537
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,266
You must be pretty proud of your dad!

538
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,752
You know I have such mad respect for him,

539
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:02,754
And you can tell him I said that.

540
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:03,822
Hey, um...

541
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:05,791
Oh, okay.

542
00:28:05,825 --> 00:28:07,426
Yeah, we make movies in here.

543
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,944
Cool.

544
00:28:10,496 --> 00:28:11,746
Harriet?

545
00:28:11,797 --> 00:28:12,797
You coming?

546
00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:22,807
So, you saw the first movie, right?

547
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:24,426
No I haven't, actually.

548
00:28:24,477 --> 00:28:26,611
No? Wow. Okay.

549
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:29,514
Well, this sequel's gonna blow it out of the water!

550
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:30,599
Oh yeah.

551
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,383
At the end of the original "spy teen," Jake Jones,

552
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:33,752
As played by the brilliant Skander hill,

553
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:35,604
Successfully exposed his high school's principal

554
00:28:35,655 --> 00:28:37,939
As a double agent And found
true love with Lisa Lidell

555
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,691
A.k.a. poppy Malone.

556
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:42,277
In the sequel, the entire cast goes a senior trip to Europe!

557
00:28:42,328 --> 00:28:43,695
But the minute Skander thinks he's free

558
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:44,696
To enjoy time with his friends,

559
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,165
The ISB - the international spy bureau - call.

560
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,867
They need his help again!

561
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:51,253
So now he's gotta choose Between
having fun with his posse

562
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:53,038
Or his sworn duty to protect our country,

563
00:28:53,072 --> 00:28:56,291
All while keeping his spy identity a secret!

564
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:58,426
Michelle! Can I get a hand over here, please?

565
00:28:58,461 --> 00:29:00,578
How incredibly uncredible.

566
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:04,082
Five, six, seven, eight!

567
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,935
It's funny how you can look at life.

568
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:09,137
As memories caught in time.

569
00:29:11,891 --> 00:29:14,726
Frozen like a statue...
Agh!

570
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,094
Stop the music!

571
00:29:16,112 --> 00:29:17,162
Here we go again.

572
00:29:17,196 --> 00:29:18,613
Skander, I had my words right!

573
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:21,333
Yeah, but it doesn't really help
When your dance is way off!

574
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:22,968
It was not!

575
00:29:23,002 --> 00:29:25,120
And when, miracle of miracles, you do get the steps right...

576
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:27,105
Oh, um, you really shouldn't be doing that.

577
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:29,457
Everything you see or hear is totally confidential.

578
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:31,843
So, maybe let's put it away. Okay?

579
00:29:31,877 --> 00:29:33,511
It's clearly one or the other with you, isn't it?

580
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:34,946
You might wanna cross "multi-talented"

581
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:36,298
Off the resume.

582
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:39,818
Well, maybe if someone wasn't drowning me in spit,

583
00:29:39,852 --> 00:29:41,503
I'd be able to focus!

584
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:44,923
That's what they're for, right?

585
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:46,291
Work out the little kinks.

586
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:48,593
Now remember, this is a happy moment.

587
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:53,982
The art, the culture, the museums, right?

588
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:55,834
Let's take it from the chorus.

589
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:00,438
Playback!

590
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:06,911
It's funny how you can look at life

591
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:10,715
As memories caught in time, in time, in time...

592
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:17,289
Frozen like a statue in the museum of your mind

593
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:21,259
I've collected all the artifacts...

594
00:30:22,962 --> 00:30:24,963
Will somebody fix this?!

595
00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:27,299
I'm not ripping it, you are!

596
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,867
I'm here for you, children!

597
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:30,018
Steven will make it better!

598
00:30:30,052 --> 00:30:31,336
Here we go again!

599
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,605
You know, I am so glad I broke up with you.

600
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:36,107
Uh, really, don't do that!

601
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:40,345
Harriet.

602
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,813
Golly!

603
00:30:41,847 --> 00:30:43,198
I'm not even touching your arm, Skander!

604
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:44,532
This is so ridiculous!

605
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:45,950
Yeah, hide it like you're singing.

606
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:48,053
Will you please get her off of me!

607
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,454
Just don't rip the fabric.

608
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:51,423
These are designer labels.

609
00:30:51,457 --> 00:30:53,575
It's right- Skander, keep your hands to yourself!

610
00:30:53,626 --> 00:30:55,877
It's not intentional, believe me!

611
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:58,046
All right, clear the set!

612
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,898
We should probably leave.

613
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,920
Oh, tim!

614
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:13,445
Stop it!

615
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,398
Who are these people?

616
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:17,782
Will you get them outta here?!

617
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:19,184
Have I no privacy on set?!

618
00:31:19,218 --> 00:31:20,268
This is ridiculous!

619
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,319
Have you fixed this yet?

620
00:31:21,354 --> 00:31:22,620
Let's go, guys!

621
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,458
Everyone out! If you don't need to be here, let's go!

622
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:28,860
And what happened? These are statues,

623
00:31:28,894 --> 00:31:30,228
They're not supposed to move, people.

624
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:32,097
Who's fired?!

625
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:35,200
During my one-on-one time with Skander on set today,

626
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:37,702
I witnessed something beyond belief.

627
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:39,371
And while it pains me to know

628
00:31:39,405 --> 00:31:41,606
That certain fanatic skandroids will be crushed

629
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:47,345
I feel it is my journalistic duty to tell the truth.

630
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,347
And the truth is that the fairy-tale love story

631
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:53,218
Of spy teen's co-stars does not
end In happily ever after.

632
00:31:53,252 --> 00:31:56,587
In fact, it ends in insults and all-out hatred.

633
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:59,190
Will you please get her off of me?!

634
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:03,278
Oh, golly! I didn't see you there!

635
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,766
"If you do not tell the truth about yourself," Harriet,

636
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,368
"You can't tell it about others."

637
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:12,120
Virginia woolf.

638
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:13,772
Well, wait.

639
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,808
What is that supposed to mean?

640
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:24,466
The entry was brilliant.

641
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,917
That's all there is to it.

642
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:29,888
You have single-handedly Taken
down a Hollywood power couple.

643
00:32:29,922 --> 00:32:31,923
Prepare for the moaning and sobbing.

644
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:35,176
Are they really breaking up?

645
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:36,828
Yeah! Crushing, isn't it?

646
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:38,146
Does that mean I still have a chance?

647
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,097
Yeah, does it?

648
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:40,965
Skander is single?

649
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:42,233
This is amazing!

650
00:32:45,371 --> 00:32:48,139
I can't believe you were on set.

651
00:32:48,157 --> 00:32:49,524
What did he look like? What was he wearing?

652
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:53,044
What did he look like? What was he wearing?

653
00:32:55,164 --> 00:32:57,081
I think we created a monster.

654
00:32:59,051 --> 00:33:00,385
Harriet, you are just the coolest!

655
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:01,486
I am?

656
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,321
So, did they really yell at each other like that?

657
00:33:03,355 --> 00:33:04,622
Tell us everything!

658
00:33:04,657 --> 00:33:07,258
Everything!

659
00:33:07,293 --> 00:33:09,494
J-just excuse me for a second.

660
00:33:09,528 --> 00:33:14,799
And I don't wanna put any pressure on you, but...
Think about it.

661
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,868
I know your family has to come first.

662
00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:18,703
His family comes first?

663
00:33:18,737 --> 00:33:20,004
What about mine?

664
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,774
Like I said, consider it.

665
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:24,809
I will.

666
00:33:24,844 --> 00:33:26,511
Whoa!

667
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:33,017
Must follow.

668
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:36,488
So...
When are you going back to set?

669
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:37,989
You know more than the tabloids do!

670
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:39,891
I can't wait for your next blog.

671
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:42,627
Can you post some pictures?

672
00:33:44,547 --> 00:33:45,797
My dad's the producer.

673
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:48,967
I can go visit Skander on set anytime I want.

674
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:50,835
The set is closed.

675
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,337
It is locked down.

676
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:55,056
Something happened yesterday - who knows what it was -

677
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,876
But that little twit Skander went ballistic.

678
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:03,214
Then I had his agent in my office
all day Unhinged completely.

679
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,482
Couple of real finks, let me tell ya.

680
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:06,050
And now, it is closed.

681
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:10,655
There are no reporters allowed,
There's no visitors allowed.

682
00:34:12,575 --> 00:34:17,929
Father/daughter bonding thing is gonna have to go on hold.

683
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,200
What's gonna happen to the blog?

684
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:23,902
Marion's gonna win!

685
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,503
There's gotta be something.

686
00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:26,604
We can help.

687
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,573
No, I told you, I work alone.

688
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:32,377
Clearly that didn't work too well.

689
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:34,679
I've got an idea!

690
00:34:34,713 --> 00:34:36,297
I'll call you back.

691
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:04,676
Bingo!

692
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:39,344
What is she up to?

693
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:56,544
Just wanted to make sure things are working.

694
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:58,296
Watches are synchronized.

695
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:06,337
Bingo. Right on time.

696
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:10,441
Let's go.

697
00:36:31,897 --> 00:36:33,381
Go.

698
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:41,139
What now?

699
00:36:41,173 --> 00:36:43,041
Get in the elevator when he does.

700
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,343
Okay, what about- Harriet?

701
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:46,978
Harriet?!

702
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:48,980
Let's go.

703
00:36:49,014 --> 00:36:54,885
?

704
00:36:57,906 --> 00:37:00,258
I have an appointment.

705
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:07,115
Thank you.

706
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:21,312
Don't let them see you.

707
00:37:21,346 --> 00:37:22,313
Whoa!

708
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:26,467
Ugh...

709
00:37:39,198 --> 00:37:41,399
Ugh! Who designed this thing? I hate it!

710
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,134
I'm not winning.

711
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:44,202
You're doing great, kiddo.

712
00:37:53,746 --> 00:37:56,080
Steven, right? Stevahn. In.

713
00:37:56,115 --> 00:37:57,782
I really need to get back to the gym.

714
00:37:57,816 --> 00:38:00,551
I barely made it down the hall with this crazy rack.

715
00:38:05,624 --> 00:38:07,225
Is that the new "spy teen" video game?

716
00:38:07,259 --> 00:38:08,359
I love it!

717
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:09,477
Yeah, it's insane.

718
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:12,730
Oh, perfect. Get her! Get her!

719
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:14,332
Okay, showtime.

720
00:38:14,366 --> 00:38:17,635
The clothes for the big finale scene are to die for!

721
00:38:17,653 --> 00:38:20,271
So you can thank me now Because
I know you're gonna love them!

722
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:22,073
Take a look at these puppies.

723
00:38:26,945 --> 00:38:28,212
Don't you love them?

724
00:38:29,214 --> 00:38:31,365
You are gonna be able to sing and dance your heart out

725
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:33,251
In any one of these.

726
00:38:33,285 --> 00:38:37,288
Now, I know it's gonna be hard to choose, but...
This one's fine.

727
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:40,157
Oh, good choice. Good choice.

728
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:42,426
I always knew you had an eye.

729
00:38:43,428 --> 00:38:46,030
But I didn't know he had a tattoo!

730
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:47,064
Shhhh.

731
00:38:51,436 --> 00:38:52,970
It's a birthmark.

732
00:38:53,005 --> 00:38:54,605
Oh, and it's in the shape of a heart!

733
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,507
It's adorable.

734
00:38:56,525 --> 00:38:58,242
I've never seen it on screen before!

735
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:00,144
That's because they always cover it with makeup.

736
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:02,947
I can't imagine why.

737
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,552
I think this is the one. What do you think, sol?

738
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:08,719
You got it, baby.

739
00:39:08,754 --> 00:39:10,021
And boy was that was tough.

740
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,125
Making the world a more beautiful place

741
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,694
One mind-blowing ensemble at a time.

742
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,299
What?

743
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,934
What was what?

744
00:39:22,968 --> 00:39:24,068
There was a sound from over here.

745
00:39:24,102 --> 00:39:26,304
What sound? No, hey, take it easy, buddy.

746
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:27,471
Let's hit the gym, huh?

747
00:39:27,506 --> 00:39:28,773
What? Why? Why?

748
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:30,474
Do you think I need to work out?

749
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:31,509
No.

750
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,311
You're a regular adonis, kiddo.

751
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:34,345
Who?

752
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:37,415
What movie was he in?

753
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,083
Never mind. You just need to work off some nerves.

754
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:41,102
Backs, bis, tris - the whole deal.

755
00:39:41,153 --> 00:39:42,153
You, walk with us.

756
00:39:42,187 --> 00:39:43,888
Yeah.

757
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:45,389
We'll hit the steam. Right?

758
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:46,908
Have a fruit plate and some yogurt.

759
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:04,809
We're making the world a more beautiful place

760
00:40:04,843 --> 00:40:06,961
One no-name t-shirt at a time.

761
00:40:08,914 --> 00:40:11,382
I gotta get my shades and cap.

762
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:14,819
We'll get them afterwards, okay?

763
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:19,607
I'm sorry. I need them, okay?

764
00:40:19,641 --> 00:40:20,958
I don't go anywhere without them.

765
00:40:20,993 --> 00:40:22,426
It's all good, babe.

766
00:40:22,444 --> 00:40:23,978
Okay, so... what were you saying?

767
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:25,696
Why did they say I was a lightweight?

768
00:40:25,731 --> 00:40:27,632
They did not say lightweight... exactly.

769
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,133
But I totally nailed the audition!

770
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,434
I know. But it's the director,

771
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,770
He just wants to go a different direction.

772
00:40:32,804 --> 00:40:33,838
You know what it is, sol?

773
00:40:33,872 --> 00:40:35,306
It's those stupid spy movies.

774
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,774
What director's ever gonna take me seriously?

775
00:40:36,808 --> 00:40:38,376
You can play me on a video game!

776
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,461
You never should've signed me up for the sequel.

777
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:41,746
I am gonna be spy boy

778
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,981
Until my career's completely down the toilet.

779
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,314
Mission accomplished.

780
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:03,501
I was hanging out with Skander
today At his hotel room.

781
00:41:03,535 --> 00:41:06,570
Turns out Mr. Perfect is not so perfect.

782
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:10,041
Take a look at this disgusting birthmark right on his...

783
00:41:10,075 --> 00:41:12,109
Now don't get carried away like those finks

784
00:41:12,144 --> 00:41:14,845
Who write for the tabloids.

785
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,647
Where were you last night?

786
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,249
I heard you come in.

787
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:21,352
What were you doing up so late?

788
00:41:23,922 --> 00:41:27,959
Harriet, I do have a life outside these walls, you know.

789
00:41:42,107 --> 00:41:44,875
It's so cute! It totally looks like a heart!

790
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,343
It totally does!

791
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:48,779
I didn't think it was possible
For me to love him even more,

792
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:50,314
But I so do!

793
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:55,186
I am both amazed and
appalled At human nature.

794
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,421
These people are sub-human.

795
00:41:58,407 --> 00:41:59,189
Harriet.

796
00:41:59,207 --> 00:42:00,875
Your blog entry was great today.

797
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,326
Love the pictures.

798
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,411
Uh... thanks.

799
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:11,469
I haven't read hers yet. But thanks, Rachel.

800
00:42:11,503 --> 00:42:13,379
I just got the new karaoke DVD

801
00:42:17,976 --> 00:42:19,260
To play it tonight.

802
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:20,244
You want to come?

803
00:42:20,278 --> 00:42:21,412
Me?

804
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,614
Uh... sure.

805
00:42:24,616 --> 00:42:25,599
Yeah.

806
00:42:26,618 --> 00:42:29,387
Well, if you're such good friends with Skander,

807
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,821
Why don't you bring him to the party?

808
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:32,256
I'd die.

809
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:40,331
Love your blog.

810
00:42:44,202 --> 00:42:46,170
You're going?

811
00:42:46,204 --> 00:42:48,072
I have to infiltrate enemy territory;

812
00:42:48,106 --> 00:42:50,508
That's the only reason I said yes.

813
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:51,542
Sure.

814
00:43:03,388 --> 00:43:07,725
A lie, a lie, a lie.

815
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:10,795
I spy...
So this is what it's like

816
00:43:13,565 --> 00:43:17,735
It's surreal...
And really, really pink.

817
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:21,172
Oh... lie

818
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:25,276
Uh, no, no. that's okay.

819
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:27,444
Come on, it's so easy. Just follow the bouncing ball.

820
00:43:27,462 --> 00:43:29,380
I'll just leave the singing to Skander.

821
00:43:29,414 --> 00:43:30,681
Do you really think he's coming?

822
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:31,966
He didn't say no.

823
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,618
Oh wait, maybe this is him.

824
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,554
Hello? Oh hey, Skander.

825
00:43:42,928 --> 00:43:45,846
Oh my gosh, oh my god!

826
00:43:47,732 --> 00:43:50,234
So just play it cool, okay?

827
00:44:03,365 --> 00:44:04,815
Oh my gosh... he's totally in there!

828
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,167
Can you see him?

829
00:44:07,452 --> 00:44:08,252
There he is!

830
00:44:09,504 --> 00:44:10,921
Let me see.

831
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:14,391
Are they still looking?

832
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:15,392
Yup.

833
00:44:15,427 --> 00:44:17,595
Don't let them see you! I think it's working.

834
00:44:20,031 --> 00:44:21,098
Then I want you to stick your arm out

835
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:22,833
And wave at the window. Got it?

836
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:23,968
This is so ridiculous.

837
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:26,470
Just shut up and hug me!

838
00:44:27,472 --> 00:44:28,472
Now wave.

839
00:44:32,243 --> 00:44:34,845
She's so lucky!

840
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:50,379
Sorry, Skander's too tired from rehearsal to come in.

841
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:51,480
Convenient.

842
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:53,281
I'm sorry?

843
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:58,253
Why would Skander hill take
a cab When he has a driver?

844
00:44:58,271 --> 00:45:01,390
He likes to travel... incognito.

845
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:05,727
If you know Skander hill, I dare
you to bring something to school

846
00:45:05,762 --> 00:45:06,928
That belongs to him.

847
00:45:06,963 --> 00:45:08,029
Well, this...

848
00:45:09,065 --> 00:45:10,932
Is his water bottle.

849
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:13,168
His lips have touched it.

850
00:45:13,202 --> 00:45:15,070
I swear.

851
00:45:15,104 --> 00:45:16,655
That could belong to anyone.

852
00:45:16,706 --> 00:45:17,989
Don't be such a Debbie downer.

853
00:45:19,608 --> 00:45:20,459
No, I can't sing.

854
00:45:20,493 --> 00:45:21,276
Of course you can.

855
00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:22,544
No, really, I can't.

856
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:33,288
Gotta be strong I spy
with my little eye.

857
00:45:33,306 --> 00:45:36,024
A lie, a lie, a lie.

858
00:45:38,728 --> 00:45:45,667
I try to be the good guy
Yeah, I try, I try, I try.

859
00:45:50,857 --> 00:45:51,907
But it's Saturday.

860
00:45:51,941 --> 00:45:53,642
We always go to the park on Saturday.

861
00:45:53,676 --> 00:45:55,360
I'm sorry, I have to bail.

862
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:56,311
Why?

863
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:57,679
I have a reconnaissance mission.

864
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:01,032
Marion Hawthorne still refuses to believe I know Skander.

865
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:02,083
You don't.

866
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:04,920
I know, but I have a fake reputation to uphold.

867
00:46:04,954 --> 00:46:06,588
And I hate it, but giving up my personal life

868
00:46:06,622 --> 00:46:08,423
Is just one of the sacrifices I have to make.

869
00:46:08,458 --> 00:46:09,758
Oh, sacrifice, huh?

870
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:11,793
A party with the "cool crowd" is a sacrifice?

871
00:46:11,827 --> 00:46:14,496
Oh, it was beyond torture.

872
00:46:23,706 --> 00:46:24,906
I'll see you guys later.

873
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:42,090
?

874
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:06,047
Mysterious appointments, Late
night excursions, And coop...

875
00:47:06,065 --> 00:47:09,184
All the talking with coop about his proposal.

876
00:47:12,922 --> 00:47:17,325
?

877
00:48:14,216 --> 00:48:15,283
Housekeeping!

878
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,140
On the pillow this time!

879
00:48:39,175 --> 00:48:40,442
Oh, and speaking of pillows,

880
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:42,811
I've asked for an extra one about a million times now.

881
00:48:42,845 --> 00:48:44,679
Any sign of that, yet?

882
00:48:45,998 --> 00:48:48,416
Ja! Pillow is gut, ja!

883
00:48:49,785 --> 00:48:52,487
Danke schein! bonne nuit!

884
00:48:52,521 --> 00:48:53,555
Gung hay fat choy!

885
00:48:55,858 --> 00:48:57,125
Hey!

886
00:48:57,159 --> 00:48:58,159
Wait.

887
00:49:04,634 --> 00:49:05,867
You have his autograph?!

888
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,802
How do you know it's his autograph?

889
00:49:07,836 --> 00:49:09,938
Hello? It matches the one on my poster.

890
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:11,706
Then it's easy to forge.

891
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,608
Oh, come on!

892
00:49:13,643 --> 00:49:16,611
It's a fake, Harriet, Just like you.

893
00:49:16,646 --> 00:49:17,946
Don't listen to her, Harriet.

894
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,047
We believe you.

895
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,783
We absolutely live for your blog.

896
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,912
The only thing worse than being Marion Hawthorne,

897
00:49:33,963 --> 00:49:36,097
Is wanting to be Marion Hawthorne.

898
00:50:06,662 --> 00:50:08,029
Ungh!

899
00:50:08,063 --> 00:50:10,999
Headquarters, this is Jake Jones...

900
00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:19,641
Cut! Cut! What is happening?

901
00:50:19,675 --> 00:50:20,675
Ah ha!

902
00:50:21,794 --> 00:50:22,811
Hi.

903
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:28,082
Five, six, seven, eight.

904
00:50:32,054 --> 00:50:34,139
Six, seven, eight.

905
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,524
Five...

906
00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:41,096
Oh no!

907
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,209
Of course you are, you're hot.

908
00:50:59,615 --> 00:51:02,050
Happy and proud that you're finally getting into this part

909
00:51:02,084 --> 00:51:03,017
And taking it seriously.

910
00:51:03,052 --> 00:51:04,886
I knew you'd come around.

911
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,589
That is the magic of method acting.

912
00:51:12,344 --> 00:51:13,361
Yeah. wow me.

913
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,432
What do you mean you're his assistant?

914
00:51:17,466 --> 00:51:19,467
I don't have time to talk to assistants!

915
00:51:19,485 --> 00:51:23,188
You get him on the line, you get him on the line now.

916
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:24,239
Assistants...

917
00:52:04,446 --> 00:52:05,446
Okay...

918
00:52:06,232 --> 00:52:07,849
Okay, what do I do?

919
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,785
I mean, the guy has no life.

920
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,820
All he does is work.

921
00:52:11,854 --> 00:52:14,405
If I wasn't having so much fun,
I'd actually feel sorry for him.

922
00:52:14,456 --> 00:52:16,658
And the entry hits are off the chart.

923
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,694
Everyone's reading mine.

924
00:52:21,797 --> 00:52:22,864
What's wrong?

925
00:52:25,918 --> 00:52:27,752
Sport and I have discussed this.

926
00:52:27,803 --> 00:52:29,103
Discussed what?

927
00:52:29,138 --> 00:52:30,221
You.

928
00:52:30,256 --> 00:52:32,574
We're starting to question your loyalties.

929
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:33,474
You've changed.

930
00:52:33,509 --> 00:52:34,509
Excuse me?

931
00:52:34,543 --> 00:52:36,227
You fraternize with the enemy

932
00:52:38,013 --> 00:52:39,213
It's gross.

933
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:41,316
All you do is hang out with Marion and her clones

934
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:43,318
And slobber on and on about Skander.

935
00:52:43,352 --> 00:52:44,552
It's like you're obsessed with him!

936
00:52:44,587 --> 00:52:47,055
You're just as bad as all the other skandroids.

937
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:49,624
Our friendship's completely and totally compromised!

938
00:52:49,658 --> 00:52:52,026
You're just jealous because my blog's popular.

939
00:52:52,061 --> 00:52:53,194
I'm popular!

940
00:53:00,736 --> 00:53:01,836
Okay, do it. Go!

941
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:05,423
Writing for the blog And bringing
down an undeserving teen idol.

942
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:07,575
What are you doing? Pointless experiments?!

943
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:08,676
And how 'bout you?

944
00:53:08,711 --> 00:53:10,645
Reading about a sport you stink at?!

945
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:12,046
You're both such fakes and finks!

946
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,414
Get out! Gladly!

947
00:53:19,722 --> 00:53:20,889
Oh! Oh! Oh no!

948
00:53:21,473 --> 00:53:22,140
Ohhh no!

949
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,665
I don't care what you think!

950
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:32,066
Okay.

951
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,068
And yesterday someone tried to blow me up!

952
00:53:34,102 --> 00:53:35,236
What?! Yeah!

953
00:53:35,271 --> 00:53:38,206
So someone needs to start caring about this... fast!

954
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,992
And someone needs to start caring about me!

955
00:53:41,043 --> 00:53:43,778
Oh, Skander, of course we care.

956
00:53:43,796 --> 00:53:44,963
The entire crew cares.

957
00:53:44,997 --> 00:53:46,147
Everybody cares, baby.

958
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:49,250
And you know, we also care about getting this film done.

959
00:53:49,285 --> 00:53:51,118
So what do you say?

960
00:53:51,136 --> 00:53:52,470
Tough spy time?

961
00:53:52,504 --> 00:53:55,723
Okay, Skander, this is your big song.

962
00:53:55,758 --> 00:53:57,458
All right? I want you to bring it home.

963
00:53:59,144 --> 00:54:00,061
'cause she feels she can't trust you,

964
00:54:00,095 --> 00:54:02,530
But you can't tell her the truth
About your secret agent status.

965
00:54:02,564 --> 00:54:04,299
So you're frustrated, really frustrated.

966
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,299
You with me?

967
00:54:05,317 --> 00:54:06,801
Yeah. More than you know.

968
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:07,902
Amazing!

969
00:54:07,937 --> 00:54:12,106
I really want to feel that frustration, okay?

970
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,975
You're angry, you're tense...

971
00:54:13,993 --> 00:54:17,495
The frustration should just be oozing out of every pore.

972
00:54:20,582 --> 00:54:23,685
And...
Action!

973
00:54:30,426 --> 00:54:32,343
Sorry, Skander!

974
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:33,378
What?!

975
00:54:39,385 --> 00:54:41,335
You were awesome out there, kiddo! Awesome!

976
00:54:41,353 --> 00:54:42,854
Looking good, Skander.

977
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:44,222
I'm serious about this.

978
00:54:44,273 --> 00:54:45,974
Oh, and it shows, my friend.

979
00:54:46,008 --> 00:54:47,742
You have really been delivering.

980
00:54:50,279 --> 00:54:51,312
You have to do something.

981
00:54:51,346 --> 00:54:52,530
Put the police on it if you have to!

982
00:54:52,564 --> 00:54:55,283
Okay, let's just take a step back here.

983
00:54:55,317 --> 00:54:57,385
Let's... let's breathe deeply.

984
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,988
You're not listening to me!

985
00:55:00,022 --> 00:55:02,824
Will somebody listen to me?!

986
00:55:02,858 --> 00:55:04,876
Geez, Skander, this whole prima donna act

987
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:07,962
Is getting kinda old, don't you think?

988
00:55:07,997 --> 00:55:10,031
And speaking of thinking,

989
00:55:10,049 --> 00:55:13,051
You might wanna think about laying off the carbs.

990
00:55:13,085 --> 00:55:14,085
Ugh!

991
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,337
Well, poppy,

992
00:55:16,371 --> 00:55:19,140
Maybe you should think about laying off the bad acting.

993
00:55:26,048 --> 00:55:26,981
I didn't mean to.

994
00:55:27,016 --> 00:55:28,349
No, it was me.

995
00:55:28,383 --> 00:55:29,934
It was him. What were you thinking?

996
00:55:34,189 --> 00:55:36,491
Okay, that's the way you wanna play?

997
00:55:36,525 --> 00:55:38,225
Then let's play.

998
00:55:39,227 --> 00:55:41,228
Ohhh!

999
00:55:47,736 --> 00:55:48,703
Agh!

1000
00:56:11,593 --> 00:56:12,593
Enough!

1001
00:56:13,695 --> 00:56:14,695
Enough!

1002
00:56:20,235 --> 00:56:22,954
So that's all he did, start a food fight?

1003
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:25,640
No, no, no. the guy is unhinged.

1004
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,158
I mean now he's going on about

1005
00:56:31,997 --> 00:56:34,332
Anyway, sol says he's method acting,

1006
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:37,001
But no-no-no-no-no-no, let me tell you,

1007
00:56:37,052 --> 00:56:39,720
This guy has completely lost it.

1008
00:56:41,306 --> 00:56:45,660
And now... Now he says he's
not gonna go out anymore.

1009
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,528
No, no. no public appearances.

1010
00:56:47,563 --> 00:56:50,098
He's only gonna go to the closed set.

1011
00:56:50,132 --> 00:56:51,566
Oh man.

1012
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,035
Thank goodness we don't have anymore locations to shoot.

1013
00:56:54,069 --> 00:56:55,470
So he's not going anywhere?

1014
00:56:55,504 --> 00:56:57,855
He's only shooting in the studio?

1015
00:56:57,906 --> 00:56:59,841
How am I supposed to...

1016
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,312
To what, sweetie?

1017
00:57:04,346 --> 00:57:05,780
Where's golly going?

1018
00:57:05,814 --> 00:57:07,281
She must have plans.

1019
00:57:07,316 --> 00:57:10,751
She can't be your nanny 24/7, Harriet.

1020
00:57:10,786 --> 00:57:13,521
You've barely touched your dinner!

1021
00:57:15,023 --> 00:57:19,460
I remember when I had my first
crush, I couldn't eat either.

1022
00:57:19,495 --> 00:57:22,880
I'm afraid our darling daughter
Has it bad for skylar hole.

1023
00:57:23,882 --> 00:57:25,166
Skander hill?

1024
00:57:25,184 --> 00:57:26,184
Exactly.

1025
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:53,861
I've spent so much time following strangers,

1026
00:57:53,879 --> 00:57:56,197
Writing about their lives.

1027
00:57:56,231 --> 00:58:00,885
What if all this time I've been
watching the wrong people?

1028
00:58:00,919 --> 00:58:02,369
Oh, hey, coop! How ya doing?

1029
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:04,205
Maybe I should've been learning more about the people

1030
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:05,806
I think I know the most.

1031
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:08,009
Hey! How are ya?

1032
00:58:10,896 --> 00:58:12,897
Good? Yeah? Okay.

1033
00:58:13,899 --> 00:58:14,899
Harriet?

1034
00:58:24,493 --> 00:58:25,760
Harriet!

1035
00:58:26,445 --> 00:58:27,862
Harriet, stop!

1036
00:58:27,896 --> 00:58:29,063
What were you doing there?

1037
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:31,132
It's none of your business.

1038
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:33,367
I can't even imagine why you were spying on me

1039
00:58:33,402 --> 00:58:34,435
In the first place!

1040
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,736
Me of all people!

1041
00:58:37,873 --> 00:58:39,473
Are the ones with all the secrets.

1042
00:58:39,508 --> 00:58:41,375
Don't be so melodramatic.

1043
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:42,843
So what were you doing there?

1044
00:58:42,878 --> 00:58:44,378
Are you gonna be coop's new nanny?

1045
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:47,582
Then answer the question.

1046
00:58:47,616 --> 00:58:49,016
What were you doing with coop?

1047
00:58:49,051 --> 00:58:51,152
I've seen you two together everywhere.

1048
00:58:51,186 --> 00:58:52,253
What?

1049
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,921
I've seen you hugging at book scoop,

1050
00:58:53,956 --> 00:58:57,258
Talking on the telephone, and now you're at his house?

1051
00:58:57,292 --> 00:58:58,793
What's going on?!

1052
00:59:00,395 --> 00:59:02,563
Is coop your boyfriend?

1053
00:59:03,565 --> 00:59:05,800
No, Harriet. Now this is going too far.

1054
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:06,951
Well, then what?!

1055
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:12,073
We tell each other everything!

1056
00:59:13,325 --> 00:59:16,744
I didn't want to tell you this way.

1057
00:59:19,164 --> 00:59:22,483
You've clearly given me no choice.

1058
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:26,287
Harriet, I...
I'm leaving.

1059
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,690
What?

1060
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,360
I'm leaving.

1061
00:59:32,394 --> 00:59:35,563
How can you even think about leaving?

1062
00:59:35,597 --> 00:59:36,797
And for coop?!

1063
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:40,368
I...

1064
00:59:41,353 --> 00:59:43,604
I'm buying book scoop.

1065
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:45,239
You're what?!

1066
00:59:46,842 --> 00:59:49,143
You can't do this! You can't leave!

1067
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:50,278
I won't let you!

1068
00:59:50,312 --> 00:59:51,045
Harriet, don't.

1069
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:52,213
Golly's leaving.

1070
00:59:55,367 --> 00:59:58,386
Vi... I didn't want you
to find out this way.

1071
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,887
I can explain.

1072
00:59:59,921 --> 01:00:03,024
Just like that, you're up and leaving?

1073
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:06,927
How inconsiderate.

1074
01:00:06,962 --> 01:00:09,030
How...? Roger!

1075
01:00:10,832 --> 01:00:12,233
But you are leaving?

1076
01:00:12,267 --> 01:00:13,968
Golly is.

1077
01:00:14,002 --> 01:00:15,386
Roger, I can explain.

1078
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:16,671
Without a word of warning.

1079
01:00:16,705 --> 01:00:18,205
With no thought to us at all.

1080
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,473
I can't believe it!

1081
01:00:21,026 --> 01:00:23,778
How do you expect us to manage?

1082
01:00:23,812 --> 01:00:25,880
Vi... vi, breathe, breathe!

1083
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:26,914
Vi...

1084
01:00:27,816 --> 01:00:28,983
Harriet!

1085
01:01:06,888 --> 01:01:10,124
All right, you say you know Skander hill personally

1086
01:01:10,158 --> 01:01:12,159
And you're not just making everything up

1087
01:01:12,193 --> 01:01:13,961
From your silly little head.

1088
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:17,865
For you to prove it once and for all, right?

1089
01:01:17,899 --> 01:01:18,983
Sound fair?

1090
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:20,734
And how do you suppose I do that, Marion,

1091
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:22,970
To your satisfaction, huh?

1092
01:01:23,004 --> 01:01:24,038
You'll figure it out.

1093
01:01:26,374 --> 01:01:29,510
Your blogs have been nothing but one big lie.

1094
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,393
I'm worried about her.

1095
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,462
She's taking the whole golly thing really hard.

1096
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:52,766
I know, I know, And I wish I could
think about that right now.

1097
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:53,967
Well, somebody has to.

1098
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:57,471
Well, then...
You worry about it for both of us.

1099
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,073
We've got the biggest production number

1100
01:01:59,107 --> 01:02:00,641
Of the entire movie tomorrow.

1101
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,277
A huge singing and dancing extravaganza.

1102
01:02:03,311 --> 01:02:05,212
I've got to cope with an unravelling male lead

1103
01:02:05,246 --> 01:02:07,548
And a hundred crazy teenage extras.

1104
01:02:07,582 --> 01:02:09,416
What am I gonna do?

1105
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,415
What're you doing here?

1106
01:02:41,449 --> 01:02:42,382
You should be in holding.

1107
01:02:42,417 --> 01:02:44,251
I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't be here,

1108
01:02:44,285 --> 01:02:47,621
But jail, it seems a little...
No, the extras holding area...

1109
01:02:47,655 --> 01:02:49,223
Where all the dancers are?

1110
01:02:49,257 --> 01:02:50,257
Come on.

1111
01:03:00,134 --> 01:03:01,351
All right, positions!

1112
01:03:02,353 --> 01:03:03,637
Let's try and make this work, people!

1113
01:03:03,671 --> 01:03:07,341
A little more concentration would be nice.

1114
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:08,992
Let's get a little focus here, people!

1115
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:13,146
Cue playback!

1116
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:18,752
And...
Action!

1117
01:03:18,787 --> 01:03:19,987
Let's hit the road.

1118
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:23,624
Now don't you know we're gonna move ahead.

1119
01:03:23,658 --> 01:03:25,993
Let's hit the road it's time to go.

1120
01:03:26,027 --> 01:03:28,428
Are you hearing just what I said?

1121
01:03:28,463 --> 01:03:30,798
Let's hit the road now don't you know.

1122
01:03:30,832 --> 01:03:33,166
We gonna, gonna move ahead.

1123
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,552
Let's hit the road it's time to go.

1124
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:38,222
Are you hearing just what I said?

1125
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:40,607
All aboard let's get it together.

1126
01:03:40,642 --> 01:03:42,810
It's time to play it smart.

1127
01:03:42,844 --> 01:03:44,561
Even though we're leaving here.

1128
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,647
We'll never be apart.

1129
01:03:47,649 --> 01:03:48,816
Our trip was fun.

1130
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:52,619
We learned a lot about each other and ourselves.

1131
01:03:52,654 --> 01:03:55,355
And now we know that friendship rules.

1132
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:57,491
That's a lesson we wanna take.

1133
01:03:57,525 --> 01:03:59,860
We're saying goodbye.

1134
01:03:59,894 --> 01:04:02,329
But it's hello to the future.

1135
01:04:02,363 --> 01:04:07,000
Oh who knows what's waiting around the next bend.

1136
01:04:07,034 --> 01:04:09,469
We're saying goodbye.

1137
01:04:09,504 --> 01:04:11,371
But it's hello to the future.

1138
01:04:12,373 --> 01:04:14,508
The future is ours and it's all about.

1139
01:04:14,542 --> 01:04:16,593
It's all about friends.

1140
01:04:17,612 --> 01:04:19,229
Cut! Everybody now?

1141
01:04:19,264 --> 01:04:20,430
What's going on here?

1142
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:21,481
Would someone please answer that question?

1143
01:04:21,516 --> 01:04:24,284
You...
I know you!

1144
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,435
Skander, hi.

1145
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,120
I've actually been wanting to introduce myself.

1146
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,606
My father's- you're that creepy
kid that's bee???????????????

1147
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:32,459
Who are you, huh? And what do you want?

1148
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:35,228
I am so sick and tired of crazy
fans Thinking they know me,

1149
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,581
That they're in love with me,
That they can't live without me!

1150
01:04:37,615 --> 01:04:40,400
I hate it!
I hate them, And you!

1151
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,969
You think you can know everything about someone

1152
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,503
Just by following them around!

1153
01:04:43,538 --> 01:04:47,374
You don't know me! You don't know anything!

1154
01:04:48,409 --> 01:04:50,377
What're you doing?

1155
01:04:50,411 --> 01:04:51,628
Get this off of me!

1156
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,514
Will someone get her?! Get her!

1157
01:04:54,549 --> 01:04:55,599
Security!

1158
01:04:55,633 --> 01:04:58,018
We pay you for a reason, don't we?

1159
01:04:58,052 --> 01:04:59,052
What is this?

1160
01:05:10,565 --> 01:05:14,100
Harriet m.
Welch, I have been frantic!

1161
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:15,452
Where have you been?

1162
01:05:15,486 --> 01:05:17,821
Why didn't you answer your cell phone?

1163
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:20,040
What're you wearing?

1164
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,628
I found this in your room.

1165
01:05:24,662 --> 01:05:26,546
It's Skander hill's schedule, isn't it?

1166
01:05:27,749 --> 01:05:30,617
The one time she gets his name right.

1167
01:05:30,652 --> 01:05:33,337
Harriet, Are you obsessed
with this young man?

1168
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,354
No!

1169
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,956
Well, I think you are.

1170
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:39,092
Perhaps so obsessed You're even
shutting out your friends.

1171
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,179
At a "huts for the homeless" event today

1172
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:45,933
And she said you girls aren't even talking.

1173
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:48,201
I thought it was a harmless little crush,

1174
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:52,039
But this is taking it way too far, Harriet.

1175
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,191
Now, as your mother I know you, and-

1176
01:05:56,611 --> 01:05:59,112
You don't know anything!

1177
01:06:00,615 --> 01:06:01,531
Harriet!

1178
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:28,358
Hey, guys. Look, I just want to...

1179
01:06:40,254 --> 01:06:43,724
I told you she couldn't deliver.

1180
01:06:43,758 --> 01:06:46,927
Because it's all a big lie.

1181
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,795
She's a big lie.

1182
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,952
Why're you doing this to me?

1183
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,855
I'm not doing it to you, Harriet.

1184
01:07:14,889 --> 01:07:18,959
I've always dreamt of owning my own book store.

1185
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:21,094
Since when? You never told me.

1186
01:07:21,129 --> 01:07:23,997
People are allowed to have secrets, Harriet.

1187
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,601
Even best friends.

1188
01:07:27,635 --> 01:07:28,618
You said that you wouldn't leave

1189
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,236
Until we both knew it was time for you to go.

1190
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:32,506
Well, I found out for myself that I didn't need you!

1191
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:34,124
Harriet, I...

1192
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,852
Looking at this family tree

1193
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,857
The branches wearing thin.

1194
01:07:55,096 --> 01:08:00,100
And when the drifting shows its face.

1195
01:08:01,319 --> 01:08:04,270
That's when the mending shall begin.

1196
01:08:07,842 --> 01:08:10,644
We will grieve in parted ways.

1197
01:08:11,646 --> 01:08:13,413
But I do need you.

1198
01:08:14,415 --> 01:08:17,918
And without a goodbye.

1199
01:08:20,288 --> 01:08:24,341
And we may send a card to show we care.

1200
01:08:27,294 --> 01:08:30,347
That's just another way to cry.

1201
01:08:32,366 --> 01:08:34,801
So hang on brother now.

1202
01:08:35,803 --> 01:08:38,004
Hang on sister now.

1203
01:08:39,006 --> 01:08:41,108
We're all okay.

1204
01:08:42,977 --> 01:08:44,578
No I say.

1205
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,747
Hang on brother now.

1206
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:50,917
Hang on sister now.

1207
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,487
We're all okay.

1208
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,100
You.... I know you!

1209
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,841
I am so sick and tired of crazy fans

1210
01:09:14,876 --> 01:09:16,509
Thinking they know me, that they're in love with me,

1211
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,777
That they can't live without me!

1212
01:09:17,812 --> 01:09:19,179
I hate it! I hate them!

1213
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:36,930
You...
I know you...

1214
01:09:38,099 --> 01:09:39,332
I don't believe this!

1215
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,092
The sequel"

1216
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,810
Leaked on the internet.

1217
01:09:50,845 --> 01:09:53,780
Devastated skandroids from around the world react.

1218
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:57,234
Could this spell the end Of
this former heartthrobs career?

1219
01:09:57,268 --> 01:09:58,818
What is happening?

1220
01:10:00,188 --> 01:10:02,272
Why doesn't someone answer that?

1221
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:03,690
I haven't had time to even dress!

1222
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:08,828
I will never, never forgive
golly For abandoning us!

1223
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,781
I am so sick and tired of crazy fans

1224
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:13,533
Thinking they know me, that they're in love with me,

1225
01:10:13,568 --> 01:10:15,435
That they can't live without me! I hate it!

1226
01:10:15,469 --> 01:10:16,453
No, Skander!

1227
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:25,045
Marion!

1228
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:27,113
I know you...
No, no, no!

1229
01:10:30,484 --> 01:10:31,201
Yes?

1230
01:10:31,252 --> 01:10:32,953
Oh!

1231
01:10:32,987 --> 01:10:34,004
Where's roger?!

1232
01:10:34,038 --> 01:10:35,005
Come on.

1233
01:10:38,793 --> 01:10:39,793
Smile.

1234
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:45,799
Marion, how could you do it?

1235
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:48,602
It was meant for the blog, not the entire world!

1236
01:10:48,636 --> 01:10:51,104
Well, that's why you posted it in the first place, right?

1237
01:10:51,138 --> 01:10:54,274
To make all us Skander fans feel
like idiots For liking him.

1238
01:10:54,308 --> 01:10:57,277
I was just giving you a little added boost.

1239
01:10:57,311 --> 01:10:58,845
You should be thanking me.

1240
01:10:58,863 --> 01:11:01,181
But it wasn't his fault! I...

1241
01:11:02,183 --> 01:11:03,183
You what?

1242
01:11:04,752 --> 01:11:09,239
I... I'm bored with
this conversation.

1243
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,327
You're responsible, Welch! Do you hear me?!

1244
01:11:14,361 --> 01:11:15,929
Sol, calm down. Calm down, calm down.

1245
01:11:15,963 --> 01:11:17,547
You promised my client top-notch security

1246
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:20,400
And yet somehow this girl gets onto a closed set.

1247
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:22,235
As an extra, no less!

1248
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:23,470
You're the producer.

1249
01:11:23,504 --> 01:11:25,071
How could this leak out, huh?

1250
01:11:25,106 --> 01:11:27,307
I... I didn't even
mean what I said.

1251
01:11:27,341 --> 01:11:28,275
I love you, babe,

1252
01:11:32,046 --> 01:11:34,180
Okay? Okay, there's gotta be a solution to this.

1253
01:11:34,215 --> 01:11:37,517
So why don't we go to my office,
We'll look at the rushes.

1254
01:11:37,551 --> 01:11:39,219
If it was one of the extras, we'll find her.

1255
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:42,022
Okay? Okay.

1256
01:11:42,056 --> 01:11:44,691
Okay, so this extra, she followed you?

1257
01:11:44,725 --> 01:11:45,692
She tried to blow you up?

1258
01:11:45,726 --> 01:11:46,793
What? What? What?

1259
01:11:46,827 --> 01:11:49,529
I already told you, She
was in my hotel room,

1260
01:11:49,563 --> 01:11:52,666
She was at the park, the restaurant...
She's everywhere I go.

1261
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:54,034
I can't believe you didn't take Skander seriously

1262
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:54,934
On this one, roger.

1263
01:11:54,969 --> 01:11:58,179
Not to worry, sol, I am gonna
get to the bottom of this.

1264
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,806
I promise you, We're gonna
find out who this kid is.

1265
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,807
You'd better.

1266
01:12:02,476 --> 01:12:04,043
Don't think he doesn't have other offers.

1267
01:12:07,248 --> 01:12:08,164
Anything?

1268
01:12:08,215 --> 01:12:11,751
Now don't you know We're gonna...
gonna move ahead.

1269
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:13,119
Let's hit the road...

1270
01:12:23,063 --> 01:12:24,030
Where did you get that picture?

1271
01:12:24,064 --> 01:12:26,032
Oh, uh...
How do you know her?

1272
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:32,522
Roger... Skander, look...
What is going on here?

1273
01:12:32,573 --> 01:12:36,409
How could you know her?
No... Kid, hey, hey!

1274
01:12:38,195 --> 01:12:39,879
It's her!

1275
01:12:39,914 --> 01:12:40,813
What?

1276
01:12:40,848 --> 01:12:43,283
It's her! Roger, talk. Explain.

1277
01:12:44,285 --> 01:12:49,122
Skander hill, meet Harriet Welch...
My daughter.

1278
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:52,125
Oh, I am done! This movie is done!

1279
01:12:53,894 --> 01:12:54,827
We're gonna work it all out.

1280
01:12:54,862 --> 01:12:56,296
Guys! Guys?!

1281
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,714
Expect a call from our lawyers, roger!

1282
01:12:57,765 --> 01:12:58,831
No, sol, no lawyers!

1283
01:12:58,849 --> 01:13:00,934
Sol? Skander?!

1284
01:13:00,968 --> 01:13:02,835
What is going on?

1285
01:13:05,005 --> 01:13:06,339
We need to talk.

1286
01:13:08,108 --> 01:13:09,342
Why?!

1287
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,061
Is your mother right? Are you obsessed with this guy?

1288
01:13:13,714 --> 01:13:17,183
But nobody else seemed to see
it, So I tried to show them.

1289
01:13:17,217 --> 01:13:19,819
Harriet! I mean even the most overpaid,

1290
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:21,571
Egotistical little fink in the world

1291
01:13:21,622 --> 01:13:23,706
Still deserves his own privacy.

1292
01:13:23,741 --> 01:13:24,540
What got into you?

1293
01:13:24,575 --> 01:13:25,892
I never meant it to go this far.

1294
01:13:25,926 --> 01:13:28,578
Marion's the one who posted it all over the internet.

1295
01:13:28,629 --> 01:13:30,396
I just did it for the blog. Just the blog.

1296
01:13:30,431 --> 01:13:31,464
What blog?

1297
01:13:35,469 --> 01:13:37,236
At least I was.

1298
01:13:37,271 --> 01:13:39,038
You are?

1299
01:13:39,073 --> 01:13:41,174
Well, you never told me that.

1300
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:43,209
Well, you never asked.

1301
01:13:46,730 --> 01:13:47,780
You!

1302
01:13:50,891 --> 01:13:52,157
We need to talk!

1303
01:13:52,192 --> 01:13:54,860
I think I left something running in the kitchen.

1304
01:13:54,895 --> 01:13:55,694
Vi.

1305
01:13:55,729 --> 01:13:56,896
What was I paying you for?

1306
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:59,632
While my daughter was hanging around hotel rooms

1307
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:01,934
With scooter heel.

1308
01:14:01,968 --> 01:14:03,702
Skander hill?

1309
01:14:03,737 --> 01:14:05,571
Exactly!

1310
01:14:05,605 --> 01:14:07,773
Following him all over the city.

1311
01:14:08,775 --> 01:14:12,278
You were hired to take care of
Harriet And this is what happens?

1312
01:14:12,312 --> 01:14:15,247
Do you call that doing your job?

1313
01:14:15,282 --> 01:14:18,183
All of this happened on your watch, golly!

1314
01:14:18,218 --> 01:14:21,487
It happened on your watch too, Mrs. Welch.

1315
01:14:37,671 --> 01:14:39,838
These are good, Harriet.

1316
01:14:39,873 --> 01:14:41,974
These are better than half the scripts I read.

1317
01:14:42,008 --> 01:14:44,143
Really? Thanks.

1318
01:14:44,177 --> 01:14:47,713
Yeah, but... this thing with Skander...

1319
01:14:47,747 --> 01:14:53,452
I mean this thing has, ugh...
It has caused a lot of problems.

1320
01:14:54,554 --> 01:14:55,621
I know.

1321
01:14:55,655 --> 01:14:56,855
And I want to fix it, honestly.

1322
01:14:56,890 --> 01:14:58,924
If there's anything I can do to just...

1323
01:14:58,959 --> 01:15:04,196
I just... at this point, I...
I just don't think there is.

1324
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:06,665
Then it's all my fault.

1325
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:09,335
I'm sorry, dad. I really am.

1326
01:15:09,369 --> 01:15:10,903
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

1327
01:15:10,937 --> 01:15:12,771
It's gonna be...

1328
01:15:13,607 --> 01:15:14,440
It's gonna be fine.

1329
01:15:14,474 --> 01:15:15,741
I just gotta make some phone calls.

1330
01:15:15,775 --> 01:15:17,109
Excuse me.

1331
01:15:32,926 --> 01:15:34,827
I used to like to write.

1332
01:15:39,132 --> 01:15:43,335
"Fill your paper with the breathings of your heart."

1333
01:15:44,337 --> 01:15:45,804
William Wordsworth.

1334
01:15:48,942 --> 01:15:50,976
What's wrong?

1335
01:15:51,011 --> 01:15:52,778
Golly.

1336
01:15:52,812 --> 01:15:55,748
She used to do that, you know, with the quotes.

1337
01:15:55,782 --> 01:15:58,250
Oh, honey, I know you miss her.

1338
01:15:58,284 --> 01:15:59,885
I'm so sorry.

1339
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:03,022
But I want you to know...

1340
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:08,293
I'm no golly.

1341
01:16:11,031 --> 01:16:13,032
But I am your mom

1342
01:16:14,601 --> 01:16:15,834
And I love you.

1343
01:16:16,836 --> 01:16:20,773
And we are gonna get through
this together, Okay?

1344
01:16:21,675 --> 01:16:22,675
Okay.

1345
01:17:03,249 --> 01:17:06,919
I'm, uh, surprised to see you here.

1346
01:17:06,953 --> 01:17:08,554
It's Tuesday.

1347
01:17:09,856 --> 01:17:12,858
Look, Harriet, I know you're
angry with me for leaving,

1348
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:17,563
But I couldn't pass up this opportunity.

1349
01:17:17,597 --> 01:17:20,766
And despite what you might think,

1350
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,435
You really don't need me anymore.

1351
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:25,370
You're all grown up.

1352
01:17:25,405 --> 01:17:27,039
Obviously not.

1353
01:17:27,073 --> 01:17:30,275
Well, you're getting there,

1354
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:34,113
And I think we both know what you need to do.

1355
01:17:36,349 --> 01:17:38,784
Okay, so, I have to ask.

1356
01:17:38,818 --> 01:17:42,654
Why would you, Harriet m.
Welch, Seeker of truth in all things,

1357
01:17:42,689 --> 01:17:44,857
Go to such lengths to keep the myth

1358
01:17:44,891 --> 01:17:48,360
Of this so-called Skander friendship alive?

1359
01:17:49,362 --> 01:17:51,897
I mean, did you really infiltrate the set

1360
01:17:51,931 --> 01:17:54,500
And dance in one of those big production numbers?

1361
01:17:54,534 --> 01:17:54,824
Yeah.

1362
01:17:55,535 --> 01:17:57,860
Oh, Harriet, you can't dance!

1363
01:17:57,938 --> 01:17:58,492
I know.

1364
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:04,201
I have a woman who enjoys herself very much

1365
01:18:04,692 --> 01:18:07,005
Sometimes I lose, sometimes I win.

1366
01:18:07,692 --> 01:18:08,963
Do you know who said that?

1367
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:10,173
I don't know.

1368
01:18:12,392 --> 01:18:15,110
The second greatest spy in the world.

1369
01:18:20,586 --> 01:18:22,981
-Aww, I missed you.  -I missed you, too.

1370
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:33,709
Hey, guys.

1371
01:18:34,092 --> 01:18:35,492
Why aren't you out there?

1372
01:18:41,046 --> 01:18:42,736
They haven't put me in yet, OK?

1373
01:18:42,736 --> 01:18:43,736
They probably won't.

1374
01:18:44,863 --> 01:18:46,652
Besides, what do you care?

1375
01:18:48,025 --> 01:18:51,820
Ok, I get it. I was an idiot. I am sorry.

1376
01:18:51,821 --> 01:18:54,283
I guess I got sucked into the whole being popular thing.

1377
01:18:55,292 --> 01:18:56,556
Hmph, that's an understatement.

1378
01:18:57,192 --> 01:18:59,573
Look, I don't even know who I became.

1379
01:18:59,773 --> 01:19:02,909
But whoever she was, she wasn't a good friend.

1380
01:19:03,378 --> 01:19:05,112
No, she wasn't.

1381
01:19:08,383 --> 01:19:10,317
All right, we forgive you.

1382
01:19:10,352 --> 01:19:11,131
Right, sport?

1383
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:18,317
Okay, now that that's out of the way,

1384
01:19:18,351 --> 01:19:21,320
You have got to give us all the
gory details About set that day.

1385
01:19:21,354 --> 01:19:24,289
I mean, how cool is it that you got Skander hill

1386
01:19:24,324 --> 01:19:25,757
To completely lose his marbles?!

1387
01:19:26,926 --> 01:19:29,328
Yeah, if cool means ruining your father's career,

1388
01:19:29,362 --> 01:19:31,563
Bringing a movie star to the brink of insanity,

1389
01:19:31,597 --> 01:19:33,999
And losing a blog you've been coveting your whole life,

1390
01:19:34,033 --> 01:19:36,034
Than yeah... it was pretty cool.

1391
01:19:36,069 --> 01:19:37,736
You really think you lost the blog?

1392
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:38,837
How could I not?

1393
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:42,040
Marion's reign of evil lives. ugh...

1394
01:19:42,075 --> 01:19:44,743
And now I have to go apologize to Skander.

1395
01:19:44,777 --> 01:19:46,144
My dad asked me to.

1396
01:19:46,179 --> 01:19:47,913
And the worst part of it is, I know he's right.

1397
01:19:47,947 --> 01:19:49,614
You're up, sport.

1398
01:19:49,649 --> 01:19:51,283
You're in! Let me see what you got!

1399
01:19:51,317 --> 01:19:53,752
Go!

1400
01:19:58,891 --> 01:20:01,360
I built my soul on rock and roll.

1401
01:20:01,394 --> 01:20:04,363
Then someone told me the kids don't rock no more.

1402
01:20:04,397 --> 01:20:05,964
Oh!

1403
01:20:05,999 --> 01:20:07,966
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1404
01:20:08,001 --> 01:20:09,234
It's time to win.

1405
01:20:09,268 --> 01:20:11,536
I built my soul on rock and roll.

1406
01:20:11,571 --> 01:20:13,572
Come on, sport! You can do it!

1407
01:20:14,807 --> 01:20:16,341
Oh!

1408
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:17,743
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1409
01:20:17,777 --> 01:20:20,245
Keep it up for me, keep it, keep it up for me.

1410
01:20:20,279 --> 01:20:22,481
Keep it up for me, keep it, keep it up for me.

1411
01:20:22,515 --> 01:20:24,049
Oh!

1412
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:25,784
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1413
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:27,819
Woo! Go sport!

1414
01:20:33,993 --> 01:20:38,764
Skander...
I'm truly, very seriously sorry

1415
01:20:42,035 --> 01:20:46,038
I never meant to make you crazy,
Or to hurt your career.

1416
01:20:46,072 --> 01:20:48,440
I'm just begging you, from the bottom of my heart,

1417
01:20:48,474 --> 01:20:50,208
Please finish the film.

1418
01:20:52,545 --> 01:20:56,581
Okay, um...
I'll tell you what.

1419
01:20:56,616 --> 01:20:58,450
I'll continue with the movie,

1420
01:20:58,484 --> 01:21:01,186
But only if you stop writing that blog of yours.

1421
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:02,254
Stop writing?

1422
01:21:02,288 --> 01:21:03,522
Yup.

1423
01:21:03,556 --> 01:21:04,556
I...

1424
01:21:06,826 --> 01:21:09,227
Skander, 1; Harriet, 0.

1425
01:21:10,696 --> 01:21:12,197
Well?

1426
01:21:12,231 --> 01:21:15,300
Okay...
It's a deal.

1427
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:17,702
No. no, no it isn't!

1428
01:21:17,737 --> 01:21:20,939
Harriet...
You're a writer.

1429
01:21:22,809 --> 01:21:24,242
It's what you do.

1430
01:21:24,277 --> 01:21:26,478
You're darn good at it.

1431
01:21:26,512 --> 01:21:29,014
No one should ever, ever be able to tell you otherwise.

1432
01:21:30,983 --> 01:21:32,384
Not anyone.

1433
01:21:36,722 --> 01:21:38,323
I... I can't allow it.

1434
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:55,511
Wow, Roger, you know. That's really admirable of you.

1435
01:21:56,014 --> 01:21:58,886
Such a sweet moment. Truly and..

1436
01:22:00,775 --> 01:22:02,022
I quit.

1437
01:22:04,123 --> 01:22:04,946
Nice, Roger.

1438
01:22:06,174 --> 01:22:07,155
Yeah.

1439
01:22:07,986 --> 01:22:09,998
Dad, I am not gonna let you lose this movie

1440
01:22:10,323 --> 01:22:14,144
No, it's fine. Harriet. There are other movie stars. Harriet.

1441
01:22:14,145 --> 01:22:14,921
They are coming out again.

1442
01:22:14,921 --> 01:22:15,921
Skander, Skander, over here.

1443
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:17,960
See, she does know him.

1444
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:19,560
She was telling the truth the whole time.

1445
01:22:19,823 --> 01:22:22,261
It's only because her father's the producer.

1446
01:22:22,323 --> 01:22:26,162
You still can't convince me that Harriet is best friends with Skander Hill

1447
01:22:38,073 --> 01:22:39,340
That was the director.

1448
01:22:39,374 --> 01:22:40,541
They saw the video.

1449
01:22:43,044 --> 01:22:44,645
No! They loved it!

1450
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:46,680
They didn't think you had that much anger in you.

1451
01:22:46,715 --> 01:22:49,683
The director, he had a change of heart.

1452
01:22:49,718 --> 01:22:52,252
You're perfect for the role!

1453
01:22:52,287 --> 01:22:54,188
Yeah!

1454
01:22:54,222 --> 01:22:56,557
This next movie's gonna change your life!

1455
01:23:06,601 --> 01:23:07,768
We did it!

1456
01:23:07,802 --> 01:23:08,802
"We?"

1457
01:23:08,837 --> 01:23:11,038
Well yeah! This is all because of you!

1458
01:23:11,072 --> 01:23:12,406
Amazing!

1459
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:17,244
And, roger, we're back on track.

1460
01:23:17,278 --> 01:23:18,646
Thanks, man. Okay.

1461
01:23:39,467 --> 01:23:40,834
William Shakespeare.

1462
01:23:42,103 --> 01:23:44,438
Skander! Hey, buddy! Skander!

1463
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:58,919
We were supposed to have our
vote today On the class blog.

1464
01:23:59,554 --> 01:24:03,924
But in light of recent events,
There's been a change of plans.

1465
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:06,894
I've decided there will be no class blog this year.

1466
01:24:06,928 --> 01:24:08,929
Frankly, I see no other choice.

1467
01:24:08,963 --> 01:24:10,664
Ms. Elson, that's so unfair!

1468
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:16,904
Marion, You violated the privacy
of the Westview school blog

1469
01:24:16,938 --> 01:24:20,607
By posting entries publicly on the internet.

1470
01:24:20,642 --> 01:24:22,810
Do you honestly think I could hand this over to you?

1471
01:24:22,844 --> 01:24:24,445
In good conscience?

1472
01:24:28,349 --> 01:24:29,183
Ms. Elson?

1473
01:24:29,217 --> 01:24:30,217
Yes.

1474
01:24:32,287 --> 01:24:36,056
I'd still like to vote for Harriet...
If that's all right.

1475
01:24:36,091 --> 01:24:38,192
Shut it, Beth Ellen! No one cares!

1476
01:24:38,226 --> 01:24:39,226
Well I do!

1477
01:24:41,396 --> 01:24:42,396
So there!

1478
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:50,204
And I second it!

1479
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,240
And I definitely third it!

1480
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:13,494
Well, in the interest of democracy...

1481
01:25:13,528 --> 01:25:16,663
Harriet, it looks like you've got yourself a blog.

1482
01:25:25,262 --> 01:25:27,604
Golly said, "If you do not tell the truth about yourself,

1483
01:25:27,862 --> 01:25:29,671
You can't tell it about others."

1484
