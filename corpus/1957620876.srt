00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,766
-Hello I'm Toby, I'm
your next door neighbor.

3
00:02:24,866 --> 00:02:25,600
-Hi.

4
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,833
Oh, that goes in the Asian room.

5
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:30,233
Yes.

6
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,466
Oh, I like your magic ring.

7
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:32,300
-Oh thanks.

8
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,833
Well, welcome to
the neighborhood.

9
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:33,700
-Thank you.

10
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,800
-Oh boy, it's here.

11
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:07,933
-All right, found it!

12
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,666
-Is that it?

13
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:11,966
-I think so.

14
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,866
Ah, locked.

15
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,966
-We'll never find the key.

16
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:19,233
-I suppose not.

17
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:22,500
Hey, I got an idea.

18
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,366
All right, bottom
of the ninth, bases

19
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:28,733
loaded, fastball
down the middle.

20
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,700
Yes.

21
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,766
Once more, once more.

22
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:33,400
All right.

23
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,933
Yes.

24
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:36,566
Here we go.

25
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,200
Home run.

26
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,866
Why is Aunt Violet
making such a big stink

27
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,866
about me living with you?

28
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:44,733
-Eh, I don't know.

29
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,000
In the two years since
your mom has died

30
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,066
aunt Violet has run out
of people to pester.

31
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:49,766
It's just our turn.

32
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:51,533
-It seems weird.

33
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:53,500
-Yeah, try to be nice.

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,500
She means well, all right?

35
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,566
Wait a second, wait a second.

36
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:00,700
Yes.

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,666
-Mom's will?

38
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:02,800
-You betcha.

39
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,466
All right.

40
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:10,200
My son Tobias shall remain withhis stepfather, Chet Emerson,

41
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,600
in the eventuality
of-- case closed.

42
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,433
-Yeah!

43
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:22,700
I'm starved, can I get pizza?

44
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,533
-I'm going to make lunch.

45
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,766
-Dad please no,
don't cook, please.

46
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:31,933
-All right, all right, allright, I get the point.

47
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:32,866
Here.

48
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:33,766
Be back by 12:30?

49
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:34,566
-Gotcha.

50
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,400
-Miss you.

51
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,933
-What do you think?

52
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:52,200
I sure hope this settles it.

53
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,866
I don't want to leave dad.

54
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:58,133
Aunt Violet does
have a cool house.

55
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:00,633
Remember all those Christmaspresents last year?

56
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,433
[barking]

57
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,166
That was cool.

58
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:07,133
Come on, let's go
get some pizza.

59
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,466
Hi Aunt Violet.

60
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:36,766
-Hello darling.

61
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:39,366
I happened to be in the area soI thought I'd drop by and see

62
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,433
how my favorite
nephew is fairing.

63
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:49,000
-Dad and I found
the-- how's Gramps?

64
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,733
-Hanging on.

65
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:51,600
Are you getting enough to eat?

66
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,833
-Yeah, Lucky and I werejust going to grab a slice.

67
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,400
-Oh, here's a littlesomething to help you out.

68
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,400
-Cool.

69
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,833
-The custody hearing
is coming up you know.

70
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,033
-Yeah.

71
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:05,533
-Who knows, maybe you can
come and live with me.

72
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,466
[barking]

73
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:09,233
Of course we'd have
to get to you a new

74
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,600
haircut and some
clothes from Zebo's.

75
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,566
Anyway, run along,
go have your pizza.

76
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,933
And be thinking of
the hundreds of gifts

77
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,466
you'll be receiving
for Christmas.

78
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:21,666
-Oh boy.

79
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,066
-Come give your
aunt Violet a kiss.

80
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,733
Tuesday, complained of
no food in the house,

81
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:36,966
had to give him
money to subsist.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Bartholomew, it's not fair.

83
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,533
I'm the rightful heir.

84
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:49,100
It's inconceivable that mynephew is the last Stanton man

85
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,933
and stands to inherit myfather's enormous fortune.

86
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:58,033
But not if I can help it.

87
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:01,766
-You don't want to live with
aunt Violet, do you boy?

88
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:03,966
[barking]

89
00:07:04,066 --> 00:07:06,866
You and me both.

90
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:08,300
-Hey punk.

91
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,033
Get over here.

92
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,000
-What?

93
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,033
-Get over here.

94
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,733
Don't go walking around
this neighborhood

95
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,900
talking to your dog.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,300
It's going to make theneighborhood look whacked,

97
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,100
which is eventually going
to make us look whack.

98
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Yeah, you don't
want that do you?

99
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,733
-Are these things defective?

100
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:30,133
-You're defective.

101
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:31,800
-Hey.

102
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,000
-You know what, now you did it.

[barking]

104
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,600
You know, that
flea picnic of your

105
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,300
ain't going to be
around here forever.

106
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,733
-Yeah he is.

107
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,366
Adios loser.

108
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:46,133
[barking]

109
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,166
-Hey Vito.

110
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,033
-Hey Tony.

111
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,133
Enjoy, my friend.

112
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:04,766
Oh, is lucky.

113
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:05,866
Here we go.

114
00:08:05,966 --> 00:08:08,033
This is especially for you.

115
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,100
-Thanks Vito.

116
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,100
-Ah, I take care of my friend.

117
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:21,966
Hey and say hello
to your pop for me.

118
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:22,566
-Hey.

119
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,666
-Give me the money.

120
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:25,933
I know you got it in there.

121
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:26,800
I know you got it.

122
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,733
Give me the money.

123
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,066
-Let me go.

124
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,000
-Give it up, give it up.

125
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,866
-Let me go!

126
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:37,433
-Excuse me boys.

127
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:43,966
-Who's that?

128
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,000
-I don't know, but
she looks loaded.

129
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,333
Come on.

130
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:52,933
-12:30, encountered twoslacker hoodlums in the park.

131
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,500
Look dumb enough for the job.

132
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:03,366
Are you two interested
in making some money?

133
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,166
-Money?

134
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:06,066
I remember the stuff.

135
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:06,900
-Shut up.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,100
Doing what?

137
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,600
-Slightly dangerous, and itinvolves brains and brawn,

138
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,766
and you have to keepyour mouth shut about it.

139
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:17,866
-Well that's no problem.

140
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm the brains and the brawn.

141
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,466
And, well he's my associate.

142
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,100
-I resent that.

143
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,600
-Do you know who Toby Emerson?

144
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,733
-What that little dweeb
that talks to his dog?

145
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,300
-I want you to
confiscate something

146
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,733
from his house for me.

147
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,133
-No problem, we love break-ins.

148
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:40,000
-No break-in.

149
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,266
Just walk in.

150
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,933
Don't you want to know whatit is I want you to steal?

151
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,766
-A big screen TV?

152
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:51,500
-No.

153
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,900
A small grey file box.

154
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,333
A hundred now, a hundred later.

155
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,666
And don't screw it up.

156
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:21,433
-Smile honey, smile.

157
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,500
Come on, there, good.

158
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
That's it, nice.

159
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,833
-Oh come on, honey,
that's enough.

160
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,866
Give me the camera.

161
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:33,933
Give me, give me the,
give me the camera.

162
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,133
-Those were the days, huh.

163
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:41,566
-Mom, we love you.

164
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,566
We love you.

165
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,300
-It's not healthy watching
that tape over and over.

166
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,066
-Hi dad.

167
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,466
-Let's not wear
out that tape, OK?

168
00:10:53,566 --> 00:10:54,833
-I know.

169
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:58,066
I'm just thinking about mom.

170
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,700
-Hey, uh, we got to come upwith a new show at the station.

171
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,766
Got any ideas?

172
00:11:01,866 --> 00:11:02,500
-Yeah.

173
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,700
The Toby and Lucky Magic Hour.

174
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,433
-Not bad, but we got to appeal
to the late night crowd.

175
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:10,733
Oh, late night.

176
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,566
Speaking of which, I
got to go out tonight.

177
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,933
Jill's going to come by.

178
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:20,066
-I thought we were going tothe fake wrestling match?

179
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,600
-Sorry pal.

180
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,866
I got to interview one
on the prospective hosts

181
00:11:23,966 --> 00:11:25,566
for the new show.

182
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:26,366
-I understand.

183
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,466
-Hi it's Chet Emerson,
is Jill there please?

184
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,466
Hello?

185
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:49,966
Um, you can have it.

186
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:52,800
It hasn't worked in years but--

187
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,333
I just, I just couldn't bearto let this go to the dump.

188
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,633
I mean this, is LeBeau lamp.

189
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:01,700
He's a very famous designer.

190
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,666
I'm an interior designer myself.

191
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:04,666
-Jill.

192
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,433
Sorry.

193
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:06,233
-It's OK.

194
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,766
-Cheerleading practice?

195
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,633
OK, thanks.

196
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:14,533
Baby sitters, they're reallyhard to come by these days.

197
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:18,966
Hi, Chet, I manage the
local cable station.

198
00:12:19,066 --> 00:12:20,800
-I'm Phoebe.

199
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,166
I believe I met your son, Toby?

200
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:24,300
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

201
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,100
-Yeah.

202
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,833
-You're the new neighbor?

203
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:31,266
-Yes I am.

204
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:32,600
Yes.

205
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,700
I think Herman and I
will it here very much.

206
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,700
-Herman, I haven't
seen him around.

207
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,300
-Well that's because
he stays in mostly.

208
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,433
You know, I'll babysit foryou, since you're in a bind.

209
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,466
-Really?

210
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you sure it's not
too much of a problem?

211
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,033
-Yeah.

212
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:51,066
No, I mean no.

213
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,733
I meant no, it's not
a problem at all.

214
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,600
Toby seems really sweet.

215
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,833
-Oh, great, um, could youcome over, at say, uh, six?

216
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,566
-Sure.

217
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,200
Oh.

218
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,433
-Emergency at the station.

219
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:07,866
You're a lifesaver.

220
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:08,833
Thanks.

221
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,600
-Yeah.

222
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,733
I'm--

223
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,533
-Um.

224
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:30,733
[barking]

225
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:34,033
-Now sir, I will bet
you a dog biscuit

226
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,866
that I'll pick the
card that you chose.

227
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,000
[barking]

228
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
-That isn't it, is it?

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,133
[barking]

230
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,000
-Give me a break, I
just got this trick.

231
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,566
If only I could read Chinese.

232
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,833
Let me try that again.

233
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:55,733
-Hey Tobes.

234
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,633
-Yeah dad.

235
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,566
-You know Phoebe,
our new neighbor?

236
00:13:58,666 --> 00:13:59,766
-Yeah, she's cool.

237
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:01,833
-She is and she's going to
be watching you tonight.

238
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:02,700
I've got to go.

239
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,300
There's an emergency
at the station.

240
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,366
You know Sam's outside.

241
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:07,433
Why don't you go
out and shoot hoops?

242
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:08,333
Um, yeah.

243
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:11,800
Here's some pizza dough.

244
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,600
Love you buddy.

245
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,566
And love you too.

246
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,566
[barking]

247
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,066
-Love you.

248
00:14:31,166 --> 00:14:33,033
[barking]

249
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:35,033
[doorbell]

250
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:36,533
-Uh, I'm coming.

251
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:41,200
Oh, hi Chet.

252
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,433
-Hi Phoebe, I have to
leave a little early.

253
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,200
Is that OK?

254
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,133
-Sure.

255
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:46,433
-And Herman won't mind?

256
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:49,566
-No, I don't think it'll
ruffle his feathers any.

257
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,366
-Uh, Toby and Sam areshooting hoops out front.

258
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:54,100
What?

259
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,366
-It's, uh, a little crooked.

260
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,766
There.

261
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:04,433
-Thanks.

262
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:05,233
-Welcome.

263
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,566
-See the new neighbor?

264
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,133
-Yeah, she's
watching me tonight.

265
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:21,800
-Toby, I'll be over
in a little while.

266
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,533
-OK.

267
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,866
She's cuter than Jill.

268
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,933
-Don't you think she's
a little old for you?

269
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:30,600
-Yeah but not for my dad.

270
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,533
-Now you're thinking.

271
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:36,633
-The ten of clubs?

272
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:37,666
-Whoa!

273
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:39,033
Pretty good, huh Luck?

274
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,566
[barking]

275
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,700
-Nothing to it.

276
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
-You have to show me.

277
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,000
-OK.

278
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,733
After somebody's picked
a card, you very gently

279
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,033
bend the bottom corner of it.

280
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,500
And look for the bent
card and you've got it.

281
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,200
-Phoebe you're the bomb!

282
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,066
[barking]

283
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,766
[doorbell]

284
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,666
-Pizza, Pizza!

285
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:03,900
I'll get the drinks.

286
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,900
-Hey small fry.

287
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,833
$10.35.

288
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:13,000
-You didn't spit on it, did you?

289
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,566
-Thought you liked it
with everything on it.

290
00:16:18,433 --> 00:16:19,566
Short a buck.

291
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,400
-Hey!

292
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,166
Nice try pizza jerk.

293
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:25,900
-Go in there and get a
tip from your father.

294
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,433
-That was almost funny, ha ha.

295
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,800
He's isn't here.

296
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,200
-Really?

297
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,033
You don't say.

298
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:35,433
[barking]

299
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:36,400
-Later.

300
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,333
-See ya, wouldn't want to be ya.

301
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,133
Loser.

302
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,966
I've heard such wonderful
things about you Chet.

303
00:16:54,066 --> 00:16:55,300
Professionally of course.

304
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,400
-I'm fatter.

305
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,300
I mean, flattered that
you asked me to dinner

306
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,733
to pitch your idea.

307
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:07,500
-Well my brother said you neededa late night show, pronto.

308
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,800
-Lane's your brother.

309
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,466
Well, I'll have to remind
myself to thank him

310
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,600
for setting up this
little meeting.

311
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,800
He also said you're a dancer ?

312
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,033
Modern ballet?

313
00:17:19,133 --> 00:17:20,833
-Oh, no.

314
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:24,533
Wanda would have nothingto do with formal dancing.

315
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:27,433
Wanda's too much of
a free spirit who

316
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:33,233
has to explode across thestage in a fireball of passion.

317
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,933
I call the show, Wanda's
Dance Fusion Hour.

318
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:40,866
I talk about my life indance, have guest appearances,

319
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:46,300
and perhaps, do a newdance routine every night.

320
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,833
-Where is it that you dance?

321
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:52,633
-At the Chunky
Chicken off the 215.

322
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:56,366
-So my friend, is
this a blind date?

323
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,866
Or have you just gone blind?

324
00:17:58,966 --> 00:17:59,666
-Business.

325
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:01,200
Just business.

326
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,866
-Oh, thank God.

327
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:05,800
-Can you hurry up with somemore of that free bread, senor?

328
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,000
-Oh, certainly.

329
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,066
Just let me go and
call the bakery.

330
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:20,000
-Goodnight sleepy head.

331
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,366
-Will you show me
how to walk the aces?

332
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:22,966
-Sure.

333
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,866
We can do it tomorrow.

334
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:28,600
Oh my gosh, I forgot
to feed Herman.

335
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,633
Oh well, he's probably
asleep by now anyway.

336
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:31,900
-Who's Herman?

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,533
-He lives with me.

338
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:34,466
-Oh really.

339
00:18:34,566 --> 00:18:38,233
-He thinks he's the
love of my life.

340
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,700
Good night, sweet dreams.

341
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,733
-Toby come in.

342
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,100
Over Toby.

343
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,000
-What's she like?

344
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,833
-Pretty cool.

345
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:51,733
But she's living with
some guy named Herman.

346
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:52,633
-Bummer.

347
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:53,866
I've never seen him.

348
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,366
-He probably works thenight shifts or something.

349
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:57,666
Toby out.

350
00:18:57,766 --> 00:18:58,366
-Sam out.

351
00:18:58,466 --> 00:18:59,266
And Toby?

352
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:01,166
-Yeah?

353
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:01,900
-Cheer up.

354
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,500
-She would've beenperfect for dad, perfect.

355
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:20,400
-Even if my idea
doesn't work out,

356
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,766
I hope we can remain
close friends.

357
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:27,800
It was a very special evening.

358
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,700
-I, uh, I never
thought you would

359
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,500
really dance on our table.

360
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,966
-Never double dare Wanda.

361
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:40,733
Would you like to come in fora deluxe private performance?

362
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:43,433
-No thanks, I'm still digesting.

363
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,266
You know the
breakdown of enzymes

364
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:48,500
is a very important
metabolic process.

365
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,333
-I'm a night creature Chet.

366
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:55,433
-Wanda I'm sorry, I don't thinkthis is going to work out.

367
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:56,633
-Fine.

368
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:58,166
You know, I don't need a show.

369
00:19:58,266 --> 00:20:02,266
My two shifts at theChicken satisfies that need.

370
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,566

We're going to take
you to the doctor.

414
00:22:50,266 --> 00:22:51,933
Maybe they'll put a cast on you.

415
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:53,500

of what they look like?

00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:09,300
Are you the mother?

420
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,266
-No I'm just babysitting.

421
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:13,966
-Please don't die.

422
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:17,233

00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:24,166
I'm sorry.

426
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,300
-Toby.

427
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,800
Hey, come on son.

428
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,133
It's going to be OK.

429
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:21,566
-I was just driving, andthese, these kids ran out

430
00:24:21,666 --> 00:24:23,633
in front of me, and Ididn't, I didn't see the dog

431
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:25,933
and I just hit him, hit him.

432
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:28,800
-So all they got was
a small grey file box?

433
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,600
-Yes.

434
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:37,666
-Well, considering what
they didn't get it,

435
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:40,600
could've been worse.

436
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,033
-Isn't that evidence?

437
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,433
-Oh, yeah.

438
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:48,900
-Look officer, his mother's
will is in that box.

439
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,133
I've got a custody hearingin a couple of days.

440
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:53,066
Without the will,
his aunt may get

441
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,133
temporary or permanent custody.

442
00:24:55,233 --> 00:24:56,433
-Well the door
doesn't look jimmied.

443
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:57,433
Was it locked?

444
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:58,933
-Yes.

445
00:24:59,033 --> 00:24:59,733
I believe so.

446
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,866
I'm not exactly sure
if I locked the door.

447
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,633
-Well I've looked
over the whole house,

448
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:14,100
and unless they had a key,I don't know they got in.

449
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:25,333
-Oh, what a rush.

450
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:27,833
-Yeah but you had to
make so much noise.

451
00:25:27,933 --> 00:25:29,166
We could've had all the stuff.

452
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:32,533
The camcorder, the TV.

453
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:33,466
I can't believe you.

454
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:37,033
And that dog ripped
my favorite jeans.

455
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,633
-We got another hundred coming.

456
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:42,100
That's all that counts.

457
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,700
-Come on we've
better bury that box.

458
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:55,733
-Hello Chet.

459
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:56,533
-Hello Violet.

460
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:00,133
-How's Toby?

461
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:01,666
I heard about what
happened last night.

462
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:03,933
-I think he's pretty upset.

463
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:09,300
-Are you raising that
boy or torturing him?

464
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,466
-Your sarcasm is
not appreciated.

465
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:13,700
-You know this
isn't going to look

466
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,633
well at the custody hearing.

467
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:18,233
What did that bandit's
make off with?

468
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:22,500
-Oh, in addition
to the-- actually,

469
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,233
it's none of your business.

470
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,133
-Really?

471
00:26:26,233 --> 00:26:27,200
-Really.

472
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,733
-Well I only stopped
by to comfort the boy.

473
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,500
I suppose I can come
back another time.

474
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:40,766
-Toby are there?

475
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:43,166
It's breakfast time.

476
00:26:43,266 --> 00:26:45,800
Come in Toby, are you awake?

477
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,833
Come on Toby, pick up.

478
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,633
I know you're there.

479
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:51,333
Are you home?

480
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,000
-Yeah.

481
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,433
I don't ever want
to get out of bed.

482
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,566
-I know.

483
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,066
I'm sorry about Lucky.

484
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:03,700
-I lost my best
friend, except for you.

485
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,566
Now I think I'm going
to lose my dad too.

486
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,300
-What?

487
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,000
-My mother's will was
in that stolen box.

488
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,600
My dad needs it to
keep custody of me.

489
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,833
-Oh boy.

490
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,533
We've better get pizza and talk.

491
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:21,200
-Here you go, he he.

492
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,500
Toby, I, I hear
about last night.

493
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,133
I'm so sorry.

494
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:27,666
Poor, poor Lucky.

495
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:29,700
I have my mother say a novena.

496
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,433
That's a little, uh, prayer.

497
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:36,000
Anyway, the uh, the pepperoni
pizza is on the house.

498
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,966
-Thanks Vito.

499
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,100
I hope the cops find that box.

500
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,800
-Well, what wouldsomeone do with this box?

501
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,600
-I don't know.

502
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,033
-Sell it?

503
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:47,333
-Nah.

504
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,633
It's just an old tin box witha bunch of legal papers in in.

505
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:53,766
-Looks like we've got to
find out who broke in.

506
00:27:53,866 --> 00:27:55,500
Is something else bugging you?

507
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,166
-It's dad.

508
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:57,833
He needs to meet someone.

509
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:01,133
Since mom died he hasn't doneanything except take care of me

510
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:02,133
and Lucky.

511
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:06,100
-Excuse me, but
uh, I like you dad,

512
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,000
but uh, I think he
could use a lot of help

513
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,833
in the female department,if you know what I mean.

514
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:11,933
-I know.

515
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:14,966
But if he found someoneit'd be a lot more likely

516
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:16,700
he'd be able to keep me.

517
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,766
-Hmm.

518
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:22,200
You know, I think I got an idea.

519
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,233
-Ma'am, I can't wait sixmonths for a copy of the will,

520
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,566
without it I'm a sitting duck.

521
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:31,966
I'm a widowed,
working stepfather,

And she's rich.

524

550
00:30:47,966 --> 00:30:48,633
-John.

551
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:49,433
-I'm Terry.

552
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:52,733
And this is "Pasta Talk."

553
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:55,533
Today we're going to talkabout our two favorite pastas.

554
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:58,800
One, penne, and two, rotelle.

555
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,866
-Dear Mr. Emerson, my
lizard Spanky and I--

556
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:07,433
-Oh no, that's not
what rotelle is.

557
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,733
-What are you talking about?-Rotelle isn't long and twisty.

558
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,233
Rotelle is round.

559
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,433
-No they're little,spiral, the spiral things.

560
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:17,733
-No, no, that a bow
tie or that's a twist.

561
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:23,266
-OK you're-- rotelle is round!

562
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:24,066
Get him off of me.

563
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:30,800
-Though I'm writing from jail--

564
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:48,066
-Oh my gosh.

565
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:58,366
Dad.

566
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,833
Lucky?

567
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,166
This can't be happening.

568
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:18,433
You got to tell me
what's going on boy,

569
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:21,033
because you're scaring
the heck out me.

570
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,900
-Uh, I really don't know either.

571
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,233
-You talk.

572
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,900
I must be dreaming.

573
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,500
-Hmm, this is the welcome I get?

574
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,533
Hey, who's your best buddy?

575
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:31,233
Look at me, I'm back.

576
00:32:35,366 --> 00:32:37,300
Well, not completely back.

577
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,166
-You're a ghost dog, cool.

578
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:40,733
-Hmm, I guess I am.

579
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,800
-Did it hurt when
the car hit you?

580
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,000
-You know it's funny,
I didn't feel a thing.

581
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,766
But I sure was glad you werethere to help me crossover.

582
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:48,966
-How come you're back?

583
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:51,466
-I've been sent
back to help you.

584
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:53,566
-Hey, you can help
me find the file box.

585
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:56,400
-You said it Sparky,
it's payback time.

586
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:02,866
Oops, sorry.

587
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:03,900
-It's OK.

588
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,266
Some magic trick, huh?

589
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:08,133
-Yeah.

590
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,633
I'm glad you're here Lucky.

591
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,133
-Poor kid.

592
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:16,200
Maybe he would be better
off with someone else.

593
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,433
Toby!

594
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,233
Breakfast.

595
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,666
-Good morning dad, we're here.

596
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:29,733
-Morning.

597
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:30,633
Eggs?

598
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:32,100
-Dad.

599
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,733
-You like eggs.

600
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:34,533
-Look.

601
00:33:39,433 --> 00:33:41,633
-You want your
eggs on the floor?

602
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:43,700
-Lucky's back.

603
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,900
-He's what?

604
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,366
-He's a ghost dog.

605
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:48,200
I know it seems
weird, but Lucky's

606
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,533
going to help us find the will.

607
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,633
-Sure, why not.

608
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,933
You know, uh, we could use
all the help we can get.

609
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,133
-I'm not visible
to everyone Toby.

610
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,166
-Really?

611
00:33:57,266 --> 00:34:00,366
-Remember, I was sent
here to help you.

612
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:03,100
-Hey, uh, Tobe.

613
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,566
Why don't we keep Lucky
our little secret, OK?

614
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,133
-You could really see Lucky?

615
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:08,933
-Yeah.

616
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,000
Hi Lucky.

617
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,233
-Go, go, go, go, go.

618
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,033
-OK.

619
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:17,566
OK.

620
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:18,300
I'm with you.

621
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,200
-Point to him.

622
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,533
-Hey, ha, there he is.

623
00:34:25,633 --> 00:34:26,900
Oh, good Lucky.

624
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,300
Kisses, kisses.

625
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,433
Oh, Lucky, your breath is bad.

626
00:34:30,533 --> 00:34:33,500
-Brother, I don't think so.

627
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,833
-Dad, I was just kidding.

628
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:40,200
-Son, it's OK to miss Lucky.

629
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,033
-Let's go back to the
scene of the accident.

630
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:47,233
We might find something.

631
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,533
-Now that using your head.

632
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:49,333
-Hey look!

633
00:34:52,366 --> 00:34:55,200
-Hey, I bit that out of thepants of one of the burglars.

634
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,133
-Our first clue!

635
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:59,566
-Oh boy, we're on
the right track now.

636
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:02,266
-Now we just have to find thepants that this came from.

637
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:03,866
Let's get at it.

638
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:05,100
-Toby?

639
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,466
-Look what I found?

640
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:07,700
-Are you all right?

641
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,300
-I'm better than all right.

642
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,933
I got a major clue andLucky's back-- I mean, oops.

643
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:15,800
-You were talking to Lucky?

644
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,633
-You definitely don't
see Lucky right there?

645
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:21,766
-Definitely not.

646
00:35:21,866 --> 00:35:23,433
-Good, because he's not there.

647
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:25,400
-No, but you think he's there.

648
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,400
-I'm just so used to himbeing there that I forgot.

649
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,766
-Are you sick or something?

650
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,900
-I'll catch up to you later, OK?

651
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,700
-Sure.

652
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,533
Whatever.

653
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,966
-Yep, this is the spot.

654
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:43,333
Hmm, I don't see any clues.

655
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,666
-They took off into
the woods over there.

656
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:48,266
Come on.

657
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:50,233
-Oh, boy, this is great!

658
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:51,500
-Lucky, slow down.

659
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,900
-Ah, come on, it's beenawhile since I've done this.

660
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,300
Woo hoo hoo!

661
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,233
Hee hee.

662
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,533
-They might have dropped it.

663
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:04,233
Keep your eyes peeled.

664
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,366
-Why would they
go into the woods?

665
00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:07,166
-I don't know.

666
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,100
-Hey, look!

667
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,033
That must be the
burglars hideout.

668
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:16,066
-Ha, my dog house
is nicer than that.

669
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:24,000
You think they were here?

670
00:36:27,166 --> 00:36:29,433
-I'd say so.

671
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:32,400
Maybe there's a hidden
compartment somewhere.

672
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,866
Can't you see through
walls and stuff?

673
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:36,566
-Ha, what am I, Superman?

674
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:40,300
-Crooks always have
a hiding place.

675
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,033
-Hmm, I wonder where theyhid their vacuum cleaner.

676
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:45,500
-Maybe not.

677
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,633
-Hey check it out.

678
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:47,266
-What is it?

679
00:36:47,366 --> 00:36:48,433
-Their stash hold.

680
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:51,400
I think they found the file box.

681
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,433
Bogus.

682
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:53,766
-At least we know
the crooks are local.

683
00:36:53,866 --> 00:36:55,100
And by the looks
of this place, it

684
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,466
seems like they come
around here quite a bit.

685
00:36:57,566 --> 00:36:58,300
-Let's tell officer Nelson.

686
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,300
-No, no.

687
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,300
If we attract a lot of
attention the crooks

688
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,300
probably won't come back.

689
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,633
-Yeah.

690
00:37:03,733 --> 00:37:06,333
We should keep an eye on thisplace and see who shows up.

691
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:10,100
Come on I have to work onmy plans to stay with dad.

692
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,266
-Hi, my name is Greta
and I read your ad.

693
00:37:13,366 --> 00:37:15,300
I'm am in my 30's also.

694
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,333
My friends tell
me I'm attractive

695
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:20,766
and I love little boys andchocolate chip cookies.

696
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:25,500
Call me at 555-7801.

697
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,800
-Should I call?

698
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,433
-I don't think this is the wayyour dad wants to meet women.

699
00:37:30,533 --> 00:37:32,033
-Probably not, but I
got to do something.

700
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:41,266
Hi, Greta, this is Chet.

701
00:37:41,366 --> 00:37:42,866
-Oh boy, I can't watch this.

702
00:37:42,966 --> 00:37:44,766
-Yes, you read my ad?

703
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,300
Yes, I'm free tonight.

704
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,433
Hold please.

705
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:54,966
How is dad going to meet herwithout knowing what we're up?

706
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:59,666
-You didn't think this
out too well, did you?

707
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:02,666
-Would you like to meet my sonand maybe have a little dinner?

708
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:03,466
Seven.

709
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:04,300
OK.

710
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,500
We live at 2564 Terrace Court.

711
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,400
Goodbye.

712
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,433
-How are you going
to pull this one off?

713
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:16,300
-I'll think of something.

714
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,900
Dad, I'm really sorry,
you're going to kill me.

715
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,466
I forgot tonight was
parent, teacher night.

716
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,466
-You in trouble?

717
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:24,900
-Pretty deep.

718
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,300
-Don't give me any lip, mutt.

719
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
-I bet you pardon son?

720
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,133
-Hip, my teacher's really hip.

721
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:32,866
You'll like her.

722
00:38:32,966 --> 00:38:35,433
It's just a standard meeting.

723
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,466
-Boy, this kid can
think on his feet.

724
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,766
-OK, what time do I
have to be at school?

725
00:38:39,866 --> 00:38:42,000
-Actually, they're
starting a new thing

726
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,666
where the parent
and the teacher go

727
00:38:43,766 --> 00:38:45,500
to a restaurant or something.

728
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,433
Get dressed up.

729
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:49,100
It's like a date practically.

730
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,700
-Date?

731
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,500
Did you bring home a note?

732
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,633
-Lost it.

733
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,233
-Fast again.

734
00:38:56,333 --> 00:39:01,000
-I'm going to call school,something doesn't sound right.

735
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,033
-It's four o'clock,
they're closed.

736
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,966
And that means you only havethree hours to get ready.

737
00:39:06,066 --> 00:39:06,800
-OK.

738
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:12,033
-There we go.

739
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:15,066
She's really cute, and
she's single by the way.

740
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:17,200
Don't feel like you have
to talk about me at all.

741
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,766
-What an adorable little boy.

742
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,300
I bet you like chocolate
chip cookies, ja?

743
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,100
-Ja.

744
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:33,633
-Oh, shall we go, it's 7:05.

745
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:35,400
-Sure, let's uh, hit the road.

746
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,400
-I'm doomed.

747
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:46,566
[laughing]

748
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:48,700
-Two gold medals.

749
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,833
-I was East Germany's greatest
female hammer thrower.

750
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,466
-It's hard to believe.

751
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:55,266
-Not really.

752
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,800
-So how's Toby doing at school?

753
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,033
-You're asking me?

754
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:01,966
-Yes.

755
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:02,800
-Toby?

756
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,533
Fine I suppose.

757
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:09,133
You are keeping up for him
to do his homework, ja?

758
00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:11,400
-Ja!

759
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,266
Having any trouble at school?

760
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:14,066
-What?

761
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:14,966
-With your kids?

762
00:40:15,066 --> 00:40:17,400
Sometimes they can be unruly.

763
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,066
-I wouldn't know.

764
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,400
I'm childless.

765
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,466
-You're what?

766
00:40:22,566 --> 00:40:25,333
-But it doesn't
have to be that way.

767
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,233
-Hey Vito, how's the date going?

768
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,466
-She ordered raw
meat for dinner,

769
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:39,233
how do you think it's going?

770
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:42,666
Kid, why did you make
a move without me?

771
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:44,233
Your dad, he don't
look too happy.

772
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:50,533
-I love touching-- ah, teaching.

773
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:53,300
Despite the bruises.

774
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,766
-Really?

775
00:40:54,866 --> 00:40:56,666
-A few scratches unavoidable.

776
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:59,166
One time, I had a
student in a hammerlock.

777
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,166
She flipped me, and
accidentally scratched

778
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:04,433
me underneath my
drazen flippsen.

779
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:06,900
-Jeez.

780
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,700
But, Toby's doing well?

781
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,933
-Oh, your son?

782
00:41:10,033 --> 00:41:11,000
-Yeah.

783
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,366
Loves chocolate chip
cookies, about yea high.

784
00:41:14,466 --> 00:41:16,766
-He's not enrolled.

785
00:41:16,866 --> 00:41:17,866
-That little turkey.

786
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:20,566
-He can't, it's impossible.

787
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:23,300
-But I help him
with his homework?

788
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,733
-Mr. Emerson, I am a womanself-defense instructor.

789
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,633
-Would you like somethingstiff from the bar, sir?

790
00:41:34,733 --> 00:41:35,966
-Personal ads?

791
00:41:36,066 --> 00:41:39,500
For crying out loud Toby, Ican handle my own love life.

792
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,666
-Told you dude.

793
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:41,966
-Let's see here.

794
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,500
Must love 12-year-old boys andbaking chocolate chip cookies?

795
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,700
-You like chocolate
chip cookies too.

796
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,633
-Yes I do.

797
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:52,566
But that's not the point.

798
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:54,800
You lied and embarrassed me,and that weird Nazi woman.

799
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,466
Now I don't know what the
appropriate punishment's

800
00:41:57,566 --> 00:41:58,066
going to be.

801
00:41:58,166 --> 00:41:58,766
-But dad.

802
00:41:58,866 --> 00:41:59,900
-Don't make him angrier.

803
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,066
You might get off light.

804
00:42:01,166 --> 00:42:03,066
-Don't make me angrier.

805
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,733
Now go to your room.

806
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:06,500
-Relax, he'll cool off
and see the whole thing

807
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,133
with a sense of humor.

808
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:09,333
Let's talk about our next move.

809
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:19,133
Uh oh, mayday.

810
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:22,900
I don't like the looks of this.

811
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,300
-Over here, there's definitelyno decoration whatsoever.

812
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,266
There's a lint
ball in the corner.

813
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:27,600
It needs a woman's touch.

814
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,833
-What's going on?

815
00:42:28,933 --> 00:42:30,400
-Can't be good.

816
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,666
-Hi aunt Violet .

817
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:32,500
-Toby!

818
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,666
Darling.

819
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:35,166
-Isn't dad here?

820
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:37,633
-Well, he left this note onthe door, had to go to work,

821
00:42:37,733 --> 00:42:40,066
something about going toPhoebe's, whoever she is.

822
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:43,600
-That's OK, he's
been really busy.

823
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,866
It's cool though.

824
00:42:44,966 --> 00:42:46,700
I have a key to get in.

825
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,000
-Do you often stay home alone?

826
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,133
-Just for about an hour afterschool until my dad gets home.

827
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:52,200
-The truth darling.

828
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,266
-It Is.

829
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:54,600
Who are you.

830
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,933
-I'm Peter Abelino.

831
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:58,466
I'm your guardian ad litem,I've been appointed by the court

832
00:42:58,566 --> 00:43:00,233
to write a report that
will recommend who

833
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:01,833
should retain
custody of you Toby.

834
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:04,966
When's the last time
you had a hot meal?

835
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:07,866
-Uh, jeez, let me see.

836
00:43:07,966 --> 00:43:09,333
-Don't answer that.

837
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:12,933
Hey, the cavalry's coming.

838
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:15,866
-It was this morning, oatmeal.

839
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:19,233
Good for the colon.

840
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,800
Hi, Phoebe.

841
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,100
I'll be taking
care of Toby today.

842
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,300
You ready for a healthy,
nutritious lunch?

843
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,066
I'll just take that.

844
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:29,833
And thank you, goodbye.

845
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:32,100
His next hot meal's
getting cold.

846
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,266
-Excuse me, Miss.

847
00:43:33,366 --> 00:43:36,433
-Nice to have met you.

848
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:38,966
-Looks like the boy's
well watched, ma'am.

849
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:41,266
-I've never seen her
before in my life.

850
00:43:41,366 --> 00:43:43,033
-She lives next door.

851
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:44,100
Convenient.

852
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,833
Saw the boy as soon
as he walked up, good.

853
00:43:47,933 --> 00:43:49,966
-Would you stop with that.

854
00:43:50,066 --> 00:43:51,333
The father's not
fit for custody,

855
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:52,866
I'm the blood relative.

856
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:54,300
He's only the step-father.

857
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,733
-That will be taken
into consideration

858
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,400
in the court ma'am.

859
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,200
-You read the policereport, they were robbed.

860
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,000
Who knows what thatdeadbeat dad is involved in.

861
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,133
-I'll put it all
in my report Ms.

862
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:12,466
-Mr. Abelino, or
may I say, Peter.

863
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:16,300
I hope you'll be fair andimpartial in your findings.

864
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,333
And I would most certainlymake it worth your while

865
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:24,966
if you would keep asympathetic eye open for me.

866
00:44:25,066 --> 00:44:27,433
-Why, a, of course, Violet.

867
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,933
-As soon as I saw that cardrive up with exempt plates,

868
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:36,033
I knew they was trouble.

869
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:42,100
-Don't need it anymore chief.

870
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,600
Besides I wouldn't be
able to taste it anyway.

871
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,233
-Oh yeah, I forgot.

872
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,400
-Forgot what?

873
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,866
-Uh, nothing.

874
00:44:50,966 --> 00:44:53,433
What was that guy
doing with Aunt Violet.

875
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:55,533
-Was probably checking
up on your dad.

876
00:44:55,633 --> 00:44:56,600
-She means well.

877
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,900
She's just getting
batty in her old age.

878
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,433
-I'm not so sure.

879
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,666
Hey, I got something for you.

880
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:08,366
Hold on a second,
let me find it.

881
00:45:08,466 --> 00:45:10,733
Yeah, there we go.

882
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,766
This is the Whitman
Book of Magic.

883
00:45:13,866 --> 00:45:15,933
My dad gave it to
me when I was a kid,

884
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:18,233
and I want you to have it.

885
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:20,266
-Really?

886
00:45:20,366 --> 00:45:21,200
Excellent!

887
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,600
-Go ahead, it's yours.

888
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,900
-Thanks Phoebe.

889
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,500
I better run, I got
a lot of work to do.

890
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,766
Come on Lucky.

891
00:45:29,866 --> 00:45:32,833
-What did you just call me?

892
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:36,366
-I feel lucky to have
you as my friend.

893
00:45:36,466 --> 00:45:40,933
-That's, that's sweet Toby.

894
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:43,066
-We got to speed up
the investigation.

895
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:43,966
We're running out of time.

896
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:44,733
-You said it.

897
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:47,500
I hate those guys in suits.

898
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,600
-Would you look at that?

899
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,533
Kid's warped.

900
00:45:49,633 --> 00:45:51,500
-What's a guardian ad litem?

901
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,000
-I think it's a cross betweena lawyer and a baby sister.

902
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,366
-Hey twinkle toes, come here.

903
00:45:56,466 --> 00:45:58,566
-Not again.

904
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:00,700
-I thought we had conversation.

905
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,033
-What, I'm busy.

906
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:04,266
-I thought you didn't wantthe hood to get a bad rep.

907
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:05,266
-I don't.

908
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:06,733
I live here too you know.

909
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:09,600
-Then why you walking aroundhere talking to your dead dog.

910
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,066
-If you're going to
talk to something dead,

911
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:14,966
at least talk to
Abraham Lincoln.

912
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:16,533
-Ha, ha, this
guy's really funny.

913
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:19,833
-Aren't you two late for apolice lineup or something?

914
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:22,000
-You know what, I hope youhave all day, because we're

915
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,700
about to make your
life miserable.

916
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,466
-Hey Tobe, look at his pants.

917
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:28,466
Look, look!

918
00:46:28,566 --> 00:46:30,466
-You two broke into my house.

919
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:31,933
I can prove it.

920
00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:34,066
Lucky tore this off
the burglar pants.

921
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,200
-I ripped that on my bike chain.

922
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,900
-I want the file box back.

923
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,933
-You know, why don't
you go pull a rabbit out

924
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,100
of a hat or something.

925
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,100
-I got an idea.

926
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,166
Let's remind them
I'm still here.

927
00:46:46,266 --> 00:46:48,300
You get my drift?

928
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,800
-I'm putting a curse
of Lucky on you.

929
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,100
-Ooh that's scary Peewee.

930
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,766
-Until I get the file boxback, the curse of Lucky

931
00:46:56,866 --> 00:46:59,966
will remain on both of you.

932
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:01,000
A demonstration.

933
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:01,833
-Whoa.

934
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,933
-An ordinary baseball.

935
00:47:13,033 --> 00:47:14,500
Go play.

936
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,166
-And away we go.

937
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,300
-Go Lucky, go.

938
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,300
-Woo hoo!

939
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,133
Yeah.

940
00:47:29,066 --> 00:47:32,733
-Watch out, I'm coming through.

941
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:33,566
-Yeah.

942
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:34,600
-How does he?

943
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,533
What is it?

944
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:37,433
-How did?

945
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:39,700
-Look out, here comes.

946
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,500
Hello.

947
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,333
-What is that?

948
00:47:42,433 --> 00:47:43,166
-Wee!

949
00:47:47,233 --> 00:47:48,500
Coming at you pal.

950
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,433
-Hey what's going on?

951
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,666
-Here we go, up,
up, up, up, up, up.

952
00:47:52,766 --> 00:47:53,566
Wee!

953
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:54,800
-What's that?

954
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,533
-It's a baseball, it's
coming at us, run!

955
00:47:57,633 --> 00:47:58,933
-Here I come.

956
00:47:59,033 --> 00:48:02,233
Watch out kids, I'm
swinging right by.

957
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,700
-Mommy.

958
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,933
-What's going on?

959
00:48:07,033 --> 00:48:09,233
-Oh, boy, it's going to
be great, here we go.

960
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,033
The knuckle ball
for the knucklehead.

961
00:48:17,866 --> 00:48:18,933
-Think gentlemen.

962
00:48:19,033 --> 00:48:20,300
That was just a demo.

963
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,733
I want the file box back
in two days or else.

964
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,766
-I think they got the message.

965
00:48:31,866 --> 00:48:33,200
Way to go ghost dog.

966
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,366
I've been waiting to
see that for years.

967
00:48:35,466 --> 00:48:36,133
-Yeah me too.

968
00:48:36,233 --> 00:48:37,433
Ever since I was
little and Larry

969
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:39,300
put a laxative in my puppy chow.

970
00:48:43,766 --> 00:48:45,533
-There you go.

971
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:46,500
Herman.

972
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,033
-That's Herman?

973
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:54,033
-Hey Toby.

974
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:54,733
He sure is.

975
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:55,966
He's my brother's.

976
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,100
I'm taking care of him
while he's on vacation.

977
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,266
-Herman's a bird?

978
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:01,033
-He's an African Grey.

979
00:49:01,133 --> 00:49:02,433
-That's fantastic!

980
00:49:02,533 --> 00:49:03,800
-You like African Greys?

981
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,233
-African, Australian, Italian!

982
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,800
I love them all!

983
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:08,600
See you Phoebe.

984
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,533
-OK.

985
00:49:13,633 --> 00:49:15,400
-I don't care if
Herman is a cockatoo,

986
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,266
I'm not going to ask Phoebe out.

987
00:49:17,366 --> 00:49:18,166
-Why not dad.

988
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:19,866
She's cool.

989
00:49:19,966 --> 00:49:21,866
-Well, I'm sure she's
busy with her business.

990
00:49:21,966 --> 00:49:23,500
-She said she liked you dad.

991
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,800
-She did?

992
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,800
-She did?

993
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,533
-Yeah.

994
00:49:27,633 --> 00:49:30,300
-Well I'm busy with the
psychic healer show.

995
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,033
And besides remember thelast time you fixed me up?

996
00:49:33,133 --> 00:49:34,366
-Come on Dad.

997
00:49:34,466 --> 00:49:37,466
You can't stay busy forever.

998
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:38,766
-I'm busy Toby.

999
00:49:43,366 --> 00:49:44,066
-Sure dad.

1000
00:50:10,866 --> 00:50:11,566
-Shh.

1001
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:30,333
SAM [VOICEOVER]:
Dearest Chester.

1002
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:31,600
TOBY [VOICEOVER]: Hiya, Phoebe.

1003
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,233
SAM [VOICEOVER]: It
would be the fulfillment

1004
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,200
of my innermost desire--

1005
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,333
TOBY [VOICEOVER]:
You want to grab

1006
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,666
some lunch with
me this afternoon?

1007
00:50:37,766 --> 00:50:38,900
SAM [VOICEOVER]: --if
you would luncheon

1008
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,466
with me this afternoon.

1009
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:41,600
TOBY [VOICEOVER]: Chet.

1010
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,666
SAM [VOICEOVER]: Phoebe.

1011
00:50:42,766 --> 00:50:44,000
-Short notice.

1012
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:44,933
-Wow.

1013
00:50:45,033 --> 00:50:46,733
-Bold.

1014
00:50:46,833 --> 00:50:48,900
I like that.

1015
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,166
I'd love to!

1016
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:52,966
-Me too.

1017
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:54,100
Uh, 2 o'clock OK?

1018
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:54,900
-Perfect.

1019
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,333
-Don't tell me thatwasn't a major slam dunk.

1020
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:11,700
-They'll have a great time.

1021
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,166
-Ha, I'll admit,
even I'm impressed.

1022
00:51:15,266 --> 00:51:16,266
-Oh no.

1023
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:17,100
-What?

1024
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,166
-Fly in the ointment.

1025
00:51:18,266 --> 00:51:19,566
-Who's going to pay?

1026
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,766
Each one thought they
asked each other out.

1027
00:51:21,866 --> 00:51:24,000
-What do we do?

1028
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,700
-Don't look at me.

1029
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,933
-Hello Vito.

1030
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:29,533
-Hey Toby, hey,
how are you doing?

1031
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:30,566
-Fine.

1032
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,933
There's a major problem
and I need your help.

1033
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:34,166
-Ah, don't worry.

1034
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:36,000
I think we can
work something out.

1035
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,566
-OK.

1036
00:51:37,666 --> 00:51:38,400
Yes!

1037
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,700
How did I get myself
into this mess.

1038
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,833
-They're here.

1039
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:54,166
And for your sake I hopethey don't order champagne.

1040
00:51:54,266 --> 00:51:55,933
-Oh boy.

1041
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,233
-Ah, buongiorno Mr. Everson.

1042
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,600
Como esta?

1043
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:05,500
Oh, the most discerning
palette in the valley.

1044
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,300
Oh, madam.

1045
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:10,766
Come with me, come here.

1046
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:14,833
Ah, this is the best
seat in the house.

1047
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:16,200
-Oops.

1048
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,000
-Hey--

1049
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:17,833
-Yes?

1050
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:21,400
-No.

1051
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:29,100
-Man, that was close.

1052
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,133
-Here you go.

1053
00:52:30,233 --> 00:52:33,733
We have some good
specials today.

1054
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:37,366
You got yourself a
cute one today, ah?

1055
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:41,666
By the way, the manager hasinformed me that today's meal

1056
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:47,566
is complementary due toyour recent successful liver

1057
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:48,400
transplant.

1058
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:56,433
-Great service here.

1059
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,466
-Mamma mia, there's a
lot of people out there.

1060
00:53:04,566 --> 00:53:06,033
Keep going, keep going.

1061
00:53:10,066 --> 00:53:11,600
-Progress report.

1062
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,166
-Well?

1063
00:53:12,266 --> 00:53:13,000
-Not so good.

1064
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,466
No one's really saying anything.

1065
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,800
-Are they smiling at least.

1066
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,333
They're not miserable are they?

1067
00:53:17,433 --> 00:53:18,933
-Hey it could be worse.

1068
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:20,000
-We've got to help.

1069
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,466
Give him some
ideas or something.

1070
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:29,666
-Aha.

1071
00:53:29,766 --> 00:53:30,933
I've got it.

1072
00:53:31,033 --> 00:53:34,033
I need you to get the chalkboard with the specials on it.

1073
00:53:34,133 --> 00:53:35,433
-I hope you know
what you're doing.

1074
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:58,333
-Nice weather we're having.

1075
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:00,033
-Yes, it's sunny.

1076
00:54:00,133 --> 00:54:00,766
It's warm.

1077
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,800
-It's nice, it's uh,
really, really nice.

1078
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,866
-Yes, it is a really nice day.

1079
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,066
-Give me some ideas.

1080
00:54:15,166 --> 00:54:16,133
-Hey don't look at me.

1081
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:17,200
I'm a dog.

1082
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,066
-I don't know what
adults talk about.

1083
00:54:19,166 --> 00:54:20,166
-Property taxes?

1084
00:54:20,266 --> 00:54:22,700
-Funny, ha ha.

1085
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,866
-I hate this job.

1086
00:54:24,966 --> 00:54:26,833
-Why don't you go out there
and see what you can do?

1087
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:27,633
-Okey dokey.

1088
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:33,433
-Excuse me sir, what do youand your wife talk about?

1089
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:36,166
-About the ever-widening
socioeconomic chasm

1090
00:54:36,266 --> 00:54:38,000
that exists between the
classes in this country.

1091
00:54:40,966 --> 00:54:42,700
-Could you say that again?

1092
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,000
-I'll take care of this.

1093
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,966
You want it done right,you've got to do it yourself.

1094
00:54:46,066 --> 00:54:47,200
Oh, nice shoes.

1095
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,700
There they are.

1096
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,833
OK, here goes nothing.

1097
00:54:54,933 --> 00:54:55,666
One for you.

1098
00:54:58,333 --> 00:54:59,066
-Excuse me.

1099
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,200
-And one for you.

1100
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,866
-There it is, I've beenlooking everywhere for it.

1101
00:55:12,966 --> 00:55:13,866
What are you doing with
the daily special board?

1102
00:55:13,966 --> 00:55:15,733
-Give this to dad.

1103
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:18,333
I wrote a whole bunch ofadult stuff here to help him.

1104
00:55:18,433 --> 00:55:19,300
-Ah you're crazy.

1105
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,766
They already ordered.

1106
00:55:21,866 --> 00:55:24,833
Wait a minute, I
know what to say.

1107
00:55:24,933 --> 00:55:26,300
-I fixed everything.

1108
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,900
Operation footsy now in effect.

1109
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,800
-Lucky, get over to
Larry and Harry's

1110
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,766
while I take care
of things here.

1111
00:55:31,866 --> 00:55:33,100
Keep the curse alive.

1112
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,666
-Gotcha.

1113
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:37,833
Oh boy, those slackerswon't know what hit them.

1114
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:38,666
I'm out of here.

1115
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,666
-The desert menu.

1116
00:55:44,766 --> 00:55:46,666
-We're not really
ready yet Vito.

1117
00:55:46,766 --> 00:55:50,100
-Yes you are.

1118
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:51,866
-Would you like some
social chasm for desert?

1119
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,666
-No thank you.

1120
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:10,400
-You know he probably did itwith strings or something.

1121
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,500
Like mirrors.

1122
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,433
-He didn't have time to
arrange all that stuff.

1123
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:15,666
He didn't even know he wasgoing to see us in the park.

1124
00:56:15,766 --> 00:56:18,666
-Well, there's no suchstuff as curses, and magic.

1125
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:19,733
-Oh, really.

1126
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,933
-I mean, give me a break.

1127
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:23,566
That's the kind of thing
they only have like in,

1128
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:25,300
Africa of something.

1129
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,000
-Ha ha, we'll see about that.

1130
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,033
-Well I'm not leaving this houseuntil that curse wears off.

1131
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:30,600
-Well that's because
you're a chicken.

1132
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,133
-The plug came out.

1133
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:42,766
The curse.

1134
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,300
Look, the curse, it's here.

1135
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:03,133
-Alright who else some of me?

1136
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:05,433
Come get some.

1137
00:57:05,533 --> 00:57:06,333
Ah!

1138
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:13,666
-So, how'd it go yesterday dad?

1139
00:57:13,766 --> 00:57:15,200
-Not great.

1140
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,866
-You didn't like her?

1141
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,300
-I didn't know what to say.

1142
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,233
Neither one of us is
the talkative type.

1143
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:22,766
-See, you have
something in common.

1144
00:57:22,866 --> 00:57:25,133
-Well, it wasn't that bad.

1145
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,433
I don't know, I'm just, shy.

1146
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:29,700
-You should ask
her out for dinner.

1147
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,500
-Are you kidding?

1148
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,400
-Dad you can't give up on her.

1149
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,700
You said you liked her.

1150
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,333
She asked you out once,
now it's your turn.

1151
00:57:36,433 --> 00:57:38,400
-Yeah, but why
here at the house?

1152
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,166
-You'll feel more
comfortable here.

1153
00:57:41,266 --> 00:57:43,033
-I'm not comfortable on dates.

1154
00:57:43,133 --> 00:57:44,200
That's the problem.

1155
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,300
-Come on dad.

1156
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,766
Give her one more chance.

1157
00:57:46,866 --> 00:57:48,466
Please, please.

1158
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,000
-OK.

1159
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,666
-Thanks dad.

1160
00:57:56,766 --> 00:57:58,166
-Got to run.

1161
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,400
Don't forget to call Phoebe.

1162
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:20,566
-Why do I have to carry it?

1163
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:22,066
-Because you're adopted.

1164
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,200
-I'm telling mom you said that.

1165
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,066
-What are they doing?

1166
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:29,133
-Looks like they're moving in.

1167
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:31,033
-Hey genius, in here.

1168
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:39,133
-I'm back.

1169
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:40,833
What I miss?

1170
00:58:40,933 --> 00:58:42,466
-Check it out.

1171
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:43,566
-What?

1172
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:46,533
-Nothing.

1173
00:58:46,633 --> 00:58:47,333
-My pleasure.

1174
00:58:50,533 --> 00:58:53,800
I'm going after the bad guys.

1175
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,566
-How long are we going
to stay out here?

1176
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:58,333
-As long as it takes for
that curse to wear off.

1177
00:58:58,433 --> 00:59:00,033
-Well how long is that?

1178
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:01,800
-How should I know?

1179
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,800
Just chill and enjoy
the spoils of victory.

1180
00:59:22,666 --> 00:59:24,100
-Hey Toby, they're
just hiding out,

1181
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,900
hoping the curse will wear off.

1182
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,700
-They're probably hidingout, waiting for the curse

1183
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,133
to wear off.

1184
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:29,100
-Curse?

1185
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,366
-I'll explain later.

1186
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:31,900
We got them right
where we want them.

1187
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,666
-You can say that again.

1188
00:59:33,766 --> 00:59:36,700
-Remember the Halloweenspecial my dad did last year?

1189
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,033
I think I know how to putall that stuff to good use.

1190
00:59:39,133 --> 00:59:40,066
-Awesome.

1191
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:42,666
-But first, I have
a party to throw.

1192
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:58,033
-Phoebe, it's Chet.

1193
00:59:58,133 --> 01:00:00,100
Hi.

1194
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,166
I was just wondering whether
you'd like to come over

1195
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:05,866
to my place tomorrow for brunch?

1196
01:00:05,966 --> 01:00:07,733
You would?

1197
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,333
Great.

1198
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:10,200
Bye.

1199
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:15,366
Yes!

1200
01:00:15,466 --> 01:00:16,200
Yes!

1201
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,400
-Come on dad, come on.

1202
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,266
-Toby what is the big deal?

1203
01:00:21,366 --> 01:00:22,066
Whoa.

1204
01:00:22,166 --> 01:00:24,833
-What do you think dad?

1205
01:00:24,933 --> 01:00:27,600
-Hey, it's nice.

1206
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,033
I just hope I can live
up to all you hard work.

1207
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:33,466
-I have an idea that might help.

1208
01:00:33,566 --> 01:00:35,500
I'll be peaking in
from the stairs.

1209
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,866
If things go slowly,I'll give you some ideas.

1210
01:00:38,966 --> 01:00:42,466
Like topics to talk about.

1211
01:00:42,566 --> 01:00:46,766
-Um, Tobes, you're
um, 12 years old.

1212
01:00:46,866 --> 01:00:49,833
What makes you think you
know what to talk about?

1213
01:00:49,933 --> 01:00:53,566
-Two heads are better than one.

1214
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:55,000
-Yeah, I suppose.

1215
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,233
It couldn't be any worsethan the last time, right?

1216
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,100
-Dad, just turn around.

1217
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:58,933
-OK.

1218
01:01:06,666 --> 01:01:09,033
Ah, ah.

1219
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:10,033
I can't believe this.

1220
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:10,866
-Time to go dad.

1221
01:01:10,966 --> 01:01:14,500
-All right let me
get my coat on.

1222
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,566
All right.

1223
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:18,133
Yeah.

1224
01:01:18,233 --> 01:01:19,633
-Go get her Tiger.

1225
01:01:19,733 --> 01:01:21,300
-All right.

1226
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,100
Thanks.

1227
01:01:26,233 --> 01:01:26,933
-Good luck.

1228
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:41,233
[doorbell]

1229
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:42,033
-Coming.

1230
01:01:46,066 --> 01:01:47,466
Hi.

1231
01:01:47,566 --> 01:01:48,466
-Hello.

1232
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:51,100
-Oh your tie's crooked.

1233
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,166
-These are for you.

1234
01:01:52,266 --> 01:01:53,200
Um, hungry?

1235
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,000
-Yeah.

1236
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:12,700
-Welcome my friends.

1237
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,466
-Vito.

1238
01:02:13,566 --> 01:02:15,100
-Come in please.

1239
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,766
Me and the kid, we
got it worked out.

1240
01:02:17,866 --> 01:02:19,066
Yes, come on.

1241
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,033
Yes, please, come right in.

1242
01:02:26,133 --> 01:02:28,166
-Wow.

1243
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,933
-Over here, please.

1244
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:32,800
The best seat in the house, yes.

1245
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:36,433
Here, sit down, please.

1246
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:39,266
Well, brunch will
be served soon.

1247
01:02:39,366 --> 01:02:46,533
But first, oh, the tantalizingmagic of Toby the terrific.

1248
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:51,566
-Good afternoon.

1249
01:02:51,666 --> 01:02:54,433
[applause]

1250
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:00,166
-For you madam.

1251
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:01,000
-Thank you.

1252
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:01,900
-Not bad.

1253
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,533
-For my next trick.

1254
01:03:03,633 --> 01:03:05,866
I will need a member from
the audience to assist.

1255
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,166
You sir, pick a card, any card.

1256
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,666
Now, place the card
back in the deck.

1257
01:03:18,766 --> 01:03:19,966
Come to Vegas often?

1258
01:03:20,066 --> 01:03:22,000
Ha, ha, ha.

1259
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,366
-Every once in awhile.

1260
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,266
-Is this your card?

1261
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:25,966
-Hey, very good!

1262
01:03:26,066 --> 01:03:26,833
-Thank you.

1263
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:27,533
Thank you very much.

1264
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:28,666
-When did you learn that?

1265
01:03:28,766 --> 01:03:29,700

Are you ready?

1282
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:13,766
Here it is.

1283
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:14,866
Ha ha.

1284
01:04:14,966 --> 01:04:18,866
Oh for my specialty,
fettuccine alla vita.

1285
01:04:21,533 --> 01:04:22,233
-Thanks Vito.

1286
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,700
-Testing, testing.

1287
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,500

1288
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:37,100

1289
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,700
-The food?

1290
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,233
-This fettuccine is loud.

1291
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:45,633
Whoa, big flavor.

1292
01:04:45,733 --> 01:04:47,600

Yes it knock your socks off, eh?

1294
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:52,400
So good.

1295
01:04:52,500 --> 01:05:00,633
-You know, uh, Vito, uh,the fettuccine is up here,

1296
01:05:00,733 --> 01:05:07,533
and I really hope your
salad gets really low.

1297
01:05:07,633 --> 01:05:08,333
-Sorry dad.

1298
01:05:12,133 --> 01:05:12,833
-Sorry I'm late.

1299
01:05:12,933 --> 01:05:15,066
My mom made me clean my room.

1300
01:05:15,166 --> 01:05:16,633
How are they doing?

1301
01:05:16,733 --> 01:05:19,533
-They got their mouths full.

1302
01:05:19,633 --> 01:05:22,933
-Have you fixed up
the old lamp yet?

1303
01:05:23,033 --> 01:05:23,733
-Almost.

1304
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,833
-I'll go check on our
burglarizing brothers.

1305
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:37,266
-Any suggestions?

1306
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:38,300
-My mom likes it when my dadcompliments on her earrings.

1307
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,700
-Dad, compliment
her on her earrings.

1308
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,400
-You have beautiful earrings.

1309
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,333
-Really?

1310
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,066
-The earrings that you
wore the other day.

1311
01:05:57,166 --> 01:06:00,833
Now, those were beautiful.

1312
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:01,700
-Thank you.

1313
01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:05,866
-Sorry dad.

1314
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:08,233
Give me another idea.

1315
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:11,433
Her hair kind of looks
like a swirling tornado.

1316
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:12,400
Hey dad, say her--

1317
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,100
-She wont' like being
told that her hair

1318
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,033
looks like a swirling tornado.

1319
01:06:17,133 --> 01:06:18,733
Shoes are a big thing.

1320
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,600
You guys never notice them.

1321
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,966
-Dad, say something
nice about her shoes.

1322
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,533
-I like your shoes.

1323
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:31,600
-You do?

1324
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,666
I didn't think you noticed them.

1325
01:06:34,766 --> 01:06:36,566
-Good call.

1326
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:38,666
-They're plastic.

1327
01:06:38,766 --> 01:06:40,166
-Well they look
like real leather.

1328
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:45,033
-How do you expect
to keep them talking?

1329
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:47,666
You can't be around everytime they're together.

1330
01:06:47,766 --> 01:06:50,000
-Hopefully they'll find outthey have something in common

1331
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:53,633
and really hit it off.

1332
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:54,600

-Hey Toby, they're
still in the hideout.

the ends of the Earth.

1407
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,633
There's no escape.

1408
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,066
-Run!

1412
01:11:22,033 --> 01:11:24,766
Yeah, ha, ha, ha.

-Beats me.

1421
01:11:46,866 --> 01:11:48,900
At least they admitted
they stole it.

1422
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,266
That's something.

1423
01:11:50,366 --> 01:11:52,933

01:11:53,033 --> 01:11:55,233

-Spaghetti.

1441
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,966

01:12:34,566 --> 01:12:35,800
You have the right
to remain silent.

1445
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:37,433
Anything you say
can and will be used

1446
01:12:37,533 --> 01:12:38,500
against you in a court of law.

1447
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,400
Did they confess?

1448
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,800
-I got it all right here.

1449
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,000
-Where's the file box?

1450
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,066
And whose the lady you
were talking about?

1451
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:46,300
-I don't remember.

1452
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,833
Maybe I got amnesia.

1453
01:12:47,933 --> 01:12:49,633
-Is that contagious?

1454
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:51,733
-Ah, shut up you dork.

1455
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:53,633
-Don't worry Toby, I'll
get it out of them.

1456
01:12:53,733 --> 01:12:55,666
Come on, in the car.

1457
01:12:58,666 --> 01:12:59,400
-Mess.

1458
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,400
-Come on.

1459
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,100
-Hey, check it out.

1460
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,066
-Thank you.

1461
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:09,866
-Um.

1462
01:13:13,933 --> 01:13:16,266
-Looks like things worked out.

1463
01:13:16,366 --> 01:13:18,300
-I don't know.

1464
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,466
Dad said the custodyhearing should be a cinch.

1465
01:13:21,566 --> 01:13:25,866
But it'd be a lot better
if we had my mom's will.

1466
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:27,600
-Things will work out.

1467
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,066
-Hope so.

1468
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:31,566
Well, thanks for your help.

1469
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:33,766
-See you tomorrow.

1470
01:13:33,866 --> 01:13:35,700
-What a wild day.

1471
01:13:39,233 --> 01:13:41,733
-I think she likes you, Romeo.

1472
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:42,200
-Nah, come on.

1473
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,333
-I really do.

1474
01:13:43,433 --> 01:13:46,066
I think there's a greatfuture here with you two.

1475
01:13:46,166 --> 01:13:47,833
Come on she lives
right down the street.

1476
01:13:47,933 --> 01:13:50,000
-All right, knock it off.

1477
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,833
-Tobe, come on, we'll be
late for the court date.

1478
01:14:07,933 --> 01:14:09,200
-I'm coming, I'm coming.

1479
01:14:16,933 --> 01:14:17,633
-Hey pal, you OK?

1480
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,800
Don't be nervous.

1481
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:26,833
Even without the will, we
got a real strong case.

1482
01:14:26,933 --> 01:14:31,000
Violet, all she has is thefact that she's your aunt.

1483
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,866
That's it.

1484
01:14:33,966 --> 01:14:34,833
Come on.

1485
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:42,800
Let's take a look at you.

1486
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:43,866
You look good.

1487
01:14:55,466 --> 01:14:56,933
-Chet, I wanted to
catch you before you

1488
01:14:57,033 --> 01:14:59,000
went all the way downtown.

1489
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:02,633
It turns out, I had best willand testament all this time.

1490
01:15:02,733 --> 01:15:03,566
I thought you had it.

1491
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:06,766
How inconvenient, so sorry.

1492
01:15:06,866 --> 01:15:08,700
Hello Tobias, darling.

1493
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,866
-What about the hearing?

1494
01:15:09,966 --> 01:15:12,300
-Mr. Emerson, with thediscovery of your wife's will,

1495
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,233
the court feels thatperhaps you should secure

1496
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:17,200
legal representationbefore the custody hearing.

1497
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:18,866
I've come here today
to offer the chance

1498
01:15:18,966 --> 01:15:21,766
to do just that bypostponing the court date.

1499
01:15:21,866 --> 01:15:23,000
-Who are you?

1500
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,200
-I'm Peter Abelino,
Toby's guardian ad

1501
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,633
litem appointed by Judge Sayers.

1502
01:15:27,733 --> 01:15:29,766
You were notified by mail.

1503
01:15:29,866 --> 01:15:31,066
-Uh, yeah.

1504
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:33,600
-My evaluation of the child'scurrent living conditions

1505
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,433
will be reviewed by judge
Sayers and considered

1506
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:38,966
as a recommendation as towhat's best for the boy.

1507
01:15:39,066 --> 01:15:41,400
-I have the will.

1508
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,200
I mean I did have it.

1509
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,600
It was stolen.

1510
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:44,966
-Yeah, I saw it.

1511
01:15:45,066 --> 01:15:46,533
-Well, why don't we
all save a lot of time

1512
01:15:46,633 --> 01:15:48,133
and consider the matter settled.

1513
01:15:48,233 --> 01:15:50,133
Beth's will is very clearabout her last wishes.

1514
01:15:50,233 --> 01:15:51,933
What do you think Peter?

1515
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:54,866
-Under the circumstances,
I say that's an option,

1516
01:15:54,966 --> 01:15:56,833
that is if Mr. Emerson agrees.

1517
01:15:56,933 --> 01:15:57,733
-This can't be right.

1518
01:15:57,833 --> 01:15:59,333
-What dad?

1519
01:15:59,433 --> 01:16:02,400
-It says that your mom wantedyou to live with aunt Violet.

1520
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,100
-Isn't that wonderful darling?

1521
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,166
-It's a forgery.

1522
01:16:07,266 --> 01:16:09,066
-Oh Chet, don't be so dramatic.

1523
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:11,000
-I don't know what to
tell you Mr. Emerson.

1524
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,233
This will give Ms. Stump thelegal right to take the child.

1525
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,166
Now if you plan on
contesting the will,

1526
01:16:16,266 --> 01:16:18,933
the boy will be placed in afoster home until such time

1527
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:21,900
as a hearing can bescheduled in civil court.

1528
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,900
-Foster home?

1529
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,033
-Go fetch your things
Tobias, darling.

1530
01:16:25,133 --> 01:16:25,900
-Dad?

1531
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,066
-You miserable, meddling--

1532
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:30,033
-Don't raise your
voice to a lady.

1533
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:37,400
-Uh oh.

1534
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:39,133
The lady.

1535
01:16:39,233 --> 01:16:40,466
-I told you I had the will.

1536
01:16:40,566 --> 01:16:41,266
It was stolen.

1537
01:16:41,366 --> 01:16:41,900
And come to think of it--

1538
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,366
-Lady, the lady.

1539
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:44,766
Harry said he gave
it to the lady.

1540
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:46,833
-you're involvement ofthis whole stinking thing.

1541
01:16:46,933 --> 01:16:49,600
-Well, until you find
your mysterious will,

1542
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:53,233
I'm entitled to legal
custody of Toby.

1543
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:54,766
-I want to talk to my lawyer.

1544
01:16:54,866 --> 01:16:56,233
-Under the
circumstances, I'd say

1545
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:57,833
that's a good thing to do sir.

1546
01:16:57,933 --> 01:17:00,333
-Here you are darling.

1547
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:02,000
-Of course, she has it.

1548
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,833
-We got to get it back.

1549
01:17:03,933 --> 01:17:04,866
-Don't bother flea bag.

1550
01:17:04,966 --> 01:17:05,933
She doesn't have it.

1551
01:17:06,033 --> 01:17:07,233
She told those
ruffians to bury it

1552
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:08,866
in the woods, where
nobody would find it.

1553
01:17:08,966 --> 01:17:09,766
Ha!

1554
01:17:09,866 --> 01:17:10,366
[barking]

1555
01:17:10,466 --> 01:17:11,666
-What is it?

1556
01:17:11,766 --> 01:17:15,466
-That little dirt-bag says it'sburied somewhere in the woods.

1557
01:17:15,566 --> 01:17:17,566
-The hiding place in the floor.

1558
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:18,633
-We already checked.

1559
01:17:18,733 --> 01:17:20,366
The file box was kept
in the garage, right?

1560
01:17:20,466 --> 01:17:21,166
-Yeah.

1561
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:22,300
-I'll be right back.

1562
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,533
I've got some sniffing to do.

1563
01:17:24,633 --> 01:17:26,533
-Come here Tobias.

1564
01:17:26,633 --> 01:17:28,633
-Where is it, where
is it, where is it?

1565
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:29,833
It's here, it's here, it's here.

1566
01:17:29,933 --> 01:17:32,733
Come on, come on.

1567
01:17:32,833 --> 01:17:34,233
-Europe will be in
just a few hours.

1568
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:35,033
Pack light.

1569
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:36,200
-I don't want to go.

1570
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,133
-I know, change isn't easy.

1571
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:40,266
But you can write postcardsto all of your little friends

1572
01:17:40,366 --> 01:17:42,566
and they'll be so jealous.

1573
01:17:42,666 --> 01:17:44,833
We'll have to hire
a tutor of course.

1574
01:17:44,933 --> 01:17:50,533
-I'd like to go toEurope, but not with you.

1575
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:51,733
-Just for that
crack, we're going

1576
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,733
to spend an extra
day at the louvre.

1577
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:57,866
-I got the scent,
I got the scent,

1578
01:17:57,966 --> 01:18:00,600
oh boy have I got the scent.

1579
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,500
-No please, don't
put me on hold.

1580
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,166
No, no.

1581
01:18:04,266 --> 01:18:05,666
-Oh nix, nix, Chet.

1582
01:18:05,766 --> 01:18:06,500
Our plane leaves in two hours.

1583
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,133
-I want to see my dad.

1584
01:18:08,233 --> 01:18:10,266
-Give me five minutes, please.

1585
01:18:10,366 --> 01:18:11,566
-You're going to
have to let go son.

1586
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:12,633
-No.

1587
01:18:12,733 --> 01:18:15,066
-Hang in there
Toby, I'll save you.

1588
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:18,066
-Hurry Lucky.

1589
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:18,866
Hurry.

1590
01:18:22,033 --> 01:18:23,466
-Nose don't fail me now.

1591
01:18:28,233 --> 01:18:31,133
-You're not leaving
here with my son.

1592
01:18:31,233 --> 01:18:33,733
-Sir this is only going tobe used against you in court.

1593
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:35,666
-Don't touch me!

1594
01:18:35,766 --> 01:18:37,400
-Now look, either you let
her leave with the child

1595
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,433
or you file a motion to contestthe authenticity of the will.

1596
01:18:40,533 --> 01:18:41,900
Now you think about
what you're doing.

1597
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,500
-I know exactly what I'm doing.

1598
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,333
A son should be with
his father, period.

1599
01:18:46,433 --> 01:18:47,933
-Step-father.

1600
01:18:48,033 --> 01:18:51,433
Your father's histrionicswill aid us greatly in court.

1601
01:18:51,533 --> 01:18:53,466
-Aunt Violet, you suck.

1602
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,566
-Hold it right there!

1603
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:58,933
-What?

1604
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:02,100
-Don't you run
over me, you witch.

1605
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:02,766
-Phoebe.

1606
01:19:02,866 --> 01:19:03,800
-He's not going anywhere.

1607
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,733
He's staying right
here where he belongs.

1608
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:08,933
-You tell her Phoebs.

1609
01:19:09,033 --> 01:19:10,366
-Why don't you do something?

1610
01:19:10,466 --> 01:19:11,833
-I am sorry sir, but
I am going to have

1611
01:19:11,933 --> 01:19:14,266
to call the policeunless you let her leave.

1612
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:15,600
-Call them.

1613
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,066
I'd like to tell them
that you're letting

1614
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:20,166
a woman with a phony legaldocument take off with my son.

1615
01:19:20,266 --> 01:19:22,733
-Hey, what's going on?

1616
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:25,300
Toby?

1617
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:30,966
-Dispatch, send a black andwhite to 2564 Terrace Court.

1618
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:32,533
-Where is it?

1619
01:19:32,633 --> 01:19:33,700
Where is it?

1620
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,133
Oh, I know it's
around here somewhere.

1621
01:19:36,233 --> 01:19:36,866
Come on.

1622
01:19:36,966 --> 01:19:37,633
Come on.

1623
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,566
-Mr. Emerson, what
seems to be the problem?

1624
01:19:43,666 --> 01:19:44,866
-She's trying to take Toby.

1625
01:19:44,966 --> 01:19:47,100
-Officer, this is the mother'slast will and testament which

1626
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,300
states that she wants hersister here to have custody.

1627
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,900
-Let's take a look.

1628
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,233
-I think I got it.

1629
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:54,200
I think I got it.

1630
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:55,833
Jackpot.

1631
01:19:55,933 --> 01:19:58,566
-Everything seems to be
in order Mr. Emerson.

1632
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,966
I'm going to have ask you tostep away from the vehicle.

1633
01:20:01,066 --> 01:20:02,166
-Over my dead body.

1634
01:20:02,266 --> 01:20:03,533
-Mine too.

1635
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:04,666
-I'm not moving.

1636
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:07,000
-Make that three dead bodies.

1637
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,533
-You're scratching my car.

1638
01:20:08,633 --> 01:20:09,800
-Ma'am would you step
away from the car?

1639
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,366
-Not on your life, copper.

1640
01:20:12,466 --> 01:20:14,600
-I don't want to
have to use these.

1641
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:17,433
-This is it, this is
it, oh boy, this is it.

1642
01:20:17,533 --> 01:20:19,000
-I don't want it to get ugly.

1643
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:20,300
-It already is ugly.

1644
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,666
-Hang in there dad.

1645
01:20:23,766 --> 01:20:28,000
-Oh, tasty, but
totally bad timing.

1646
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,333
OK, let's try over here.

1647
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:34,900
Got it!

1648
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,600
Come on, come on, come on.

1649
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:37,600
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1650
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:38,966
I'm close, I'm close.

1651
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:40,000
I'm feeling metal.

1652
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:43,866
-Don't let go.

1653
01:20:43,966 --> 01:20:45,300
-Come on dad.

1654
01:20:48,733 --> 01:20:50,800
-Dig, dig, dig, dig.

1655
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,066
Bingo.

1656
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,933
Hope I'm not too late.

1657
01:21:03,033 --> 01:21:03,933
-Mr. Emerson.

1658
01:21:07,133 --> 01:21:07,833
-Look.

1659
01:21:14,733 --> 01:21:16,533
-Do you see what I see?

1660
01:21:22,266 --> 01:21:26,466
-The file box!

1661
01:21:26,566 --> 01:21:28,633
-I can't believe it.

1662
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:30,100
-Closer.

1663
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,833
-Oh, good heavens.

1664
01:21:32,933 --> 01:21:33,900
-Closer.

1665
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:34,700
Closer.

1666
01:21:37,733 --> 01:21:40,300
-What is that?

1667
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,600
-The canine has landed Houston.

1668
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:43,300
-That's it!

1669
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,000
That's the stolen file box.

1670
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,800
-Made if just in time.

1671
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:49,433
-Like Jordan with
a three-pointer.

1672
01:21:49,533 --> 01:21:50,700
Hurry, take it over there.

1673
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:58,700
-Toby, I can't give away
any of my trade secrets.

1674
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,533
-Here.

1675
01:22:01,633 --> 01:22:02,800
-Hold on ma'am.

1676
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,600
-This is the will.

1677
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:06,533
The real will.

1678
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:08,200
Let's see, right here.

1679
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,566
My wife said, Toby issupposed to stay with me.

1680
01:22:11,666 --> 01:22:14,333
-Officer this is
obviously a last ditch

1681
01:22:14,433 --> 01:22:16,966
attempt to gain custody
by hook or by crook.

1682
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:17,866
-May I have a look at that?

1683
01:22:26,966 --> 01:22:29,033
-This is an excellent forgery.

1684
01:22:31,766 --> 01:22:33,433
-It appears that a
miscarriage of justice

1685
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:34,533
has been narrowly averted.

1686
01:22:37,133 --> 01:22:39,566
I apologize Mr. Emerson.

1687
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:42,400
I don't think the state needs topursue this matter any further.

1688
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,033
-Cool!

1689
01:22:45,133 --> 01:22:46,266
-Oh, you moron!

1690
01:22:46,366 --> 01:22:47,533
You promised!

1691
01:22:47,633 --> 01:22:51,433
-I promised to be fair andimpartial Violet -- Ms. Stump.

1692
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:53,733
-Well just my luck I
find the one government

1693
01:22:53,833 --> 01:22:56,433
official who cares
about justice.

1694
01:22:56,533 --> 01:22:57,800
This isn't over.

1695
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,466
-Oh this may be over.

1696
01:22:59,566 --> 01:23:01,433
Are you Violet Stanton Stump?

1697
01:23:01,533 --> 01:23:02,766
-Yes, of course.

1698
01:23:02,866 --> 01:23:06,000
-I just came from the homeof Larry and Harry Duzimsky.

1699
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,900
And they told me that
you paid them to break

1700
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,366
into the Emerson's house andsteal one grey tin file box.

1701
01:23:11,466 --> 01:23:12,166
-Nonsense.

1702
01:23:12,266 --> 01:23:13,866
-I knew it.

1703
01:23:13,966 --> 01:23:16,466
-Put your hands behind yourback, you're under arrest.

1704
01:23:16,566 --> 01:23:17,766
-Oh, Impossible.

1705
01:23:17,866 --> 01:23:20,400
-I don't think so.

1706
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,266
-Violet, how could you do this?

1707
01:23:22,366 --> 01:23:25,400
-My father left all hismoney to the little dolt.

1708
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,400
It should've been mine.

1709
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:29,866
Mine!

1710
01:23:29,966 --> 01:23:30,633
You're just a kid.

1711
01:23:30,733 --> 01:23:32,666
What are going to spend it on?

1712
01:23:32,766 --> 01:23:33,266
Candy?

1713
01:23:33,366 --> 01:23:34,133
Toys?

1714
01:23:34,233 --> 01:23:35,000
Huh?

1715
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,300
Ah, my hair!

1716
01:23:39,033 --> 01:23:41,333
-Well, I'll be
heading off too folks.

1717
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:43,766
I'm sorry for any
inconvenience, but I

1718
01:23:43,866 --> 01:23:47,266
think things turned outjust the way they meant to.

1719
01:23:47,366 --> 01:23:49,100
-We won!

1720
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:49,966
-Yes.

1721
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:51,333
We sure did son.

1722
01:23:51,433 --> 01:23:54,100
We sure did.

1723
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,933
-So what do you think,
should we take callers?

1724
01:23:56,033 --> 01:23:57,300
-Yes.

1725
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:01,066
I want to help people with theirspecific decorating problems.

1726
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:02,166
-Ha, ha, ha.

1727
01:24:02,266 --> 01:24:05,266
Martha Stewart, move over.

1728
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:08,266
-Phoebe, congratulations onyour new late night show.

1729
01:24:08,366 --> 01:24:11,266
-Thank you sweetie.

1730
01:24:11,366 --> 01:24:12,933
-What?

1731
01:24:13,033 --> 01:24:15,133
-Go on, get ready.

1732
01:24:15,233 --> 01:24:17,366
And hurry up, we're going
to La Casona for dinner.

1733
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,700
-Can't wait to tell
Vito what happened.

1734
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:25,033
What a wild day.

1735
01:24:25,133 --> 01:24:26,066
-Toby.

1736
01:24:26,166 --> 01:24:27,333
-Yeah Luck?

1737
01:24:27,433 --> 01:24:29,166
-I'm not going to
La Casona tonight.

1738
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:33,400
-Why not?

1739
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,066
It's time for me to go back.

1740
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:36,666
My work is done.

1741
01:24:36,766 --> 01:24:38,533
No, you're not leaving twice.

1742
01:24:38,633 --> 01:24:40,200
This isn't fair.

1743
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,266
-I know.

1744
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:44,333
But there's nothing
we can do about it.

1745
01:24:44,433 --> 01:24:45,700
So long pal.

1746
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,600
-Not yet.

1747
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,333
Before you go, do
you think I can

1748
01:24:52,433 --> 01:24:55,166
hold you just one last time?

1749
01:24:55,266 --> 01:24:57,300
-I think that might be possible.

1750
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,100
Just once.

1751
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,000
Don't be sad Toby.

1752
01:25:06,366 --> 01:25:09,400
Remember, even if
you can't see me,

1753

-I'll miss you pal.

1755
01:25:15,033 --> 01:25:17,033
-Goodbye Toby.

1756
01:25:17,133 --> 01:25:19,400
Thanks for being my best friend.

1757
01:25:33,966 --> 01:25:36,000
You're the coolest.

1758
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,466
-Bye Lucky, you're the coolest.

-Dad what's going on?

01:26:09,766 --> 01:26:11,800
-And guess what I found?

1766
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,666
-What is it?

1767
01:26:13,766 --> 01:26:14,600
-Open it.

1768
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,566
