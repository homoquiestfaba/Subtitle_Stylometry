00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,267
       (film roll effect)       

2
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:17,016
           ( music )            

3
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,159
    ( police siren blaring )    

4
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,015
 Shirin: Good morning, Marvin.  

5
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:58,717
Officer: Good morning, and it's 
    Officer Henderson, Miss.    

6
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,652
   License and registration,    
            please.             

7
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,287
             Okay.              

8
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,257
       I know it's here.        
             Um...              

9
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:10,362
 Uh, did you lose your license  
and registration again, Shirin? 

10
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:13,132
          No, no, no.           
       It's in my purse.        

11
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:15,701
 It's got to be here somewhere. 

12
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,303
     Was I speeding again?      

13
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,907
    Oh, no. No, you weren't     
    speeding, not this time.    

14
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,209
-But let me ask you a question. 
            -Uh-huh.            

15
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,212
  Does that big red sign mean   
  anything to you back there?   

16
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,849
  Now look, we don't want any   
   accidents out here, do we?   

17
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,851
    I forgot to stop again,     
           didn't I?            

18
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:33,886
            Uh-huh.             

19
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,787
           I'm sorry.           

20
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,826
    How's the writing going?    

21
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,728
     Well, I'm still gonna      
     write you this ticket.     

22
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,730
            I know.             

23
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:48,400
     It's just...well, the      
        writing's so...         

24
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:52,271
             Go on.             

25
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,439
      Different, you know?      

26
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,875
   Definitely has potential.    

27
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,510
           Potential?           

28
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,279
  I gave you the ninth draft.   

29
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,613
          I know that.          

30
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,549
  It's really, you know, raw.   

31
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,751
You know,<i> fresh</i> is what I mean. 

32
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:10,622
 But, I thought we agreed that  
 Harry can't just kill his wife 

33
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,858
     because he's unhappy.      

34
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,496
     Well, maybe Harry...he     
   does need to do something.   

35
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,798
         You know what?         
       Maybe he kills her       

36
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,567
 then he tries to kill himself, 

37
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,237
      but through some way      
      he survives somehow.      

38
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,838
 Or maybe he just lets her go.  

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,574
         Yeah. Maybe he         
       just lets her go.        

40
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,610
       That'd be...maybe        
      he just lets her go.      

41
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,583
   Maybe he just lets her...    
   get the hell out of here.    

42
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,818
           ( laughs )           

43
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:46,391
           ( music )            

44
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,532
           -Hi Janet!           
              -Hi.              

45
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,538
              Hi.               

46
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,845
     ...have until tonight.     

47
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,414
        Then, you'll be         
    hearing from my lawyers.    

48
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,688
    I've read all the books.    

49
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,857
      You've read them all      
          in one week?          

50
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,259
            Uh-huh.             

51
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,527
      And I wrote a review      
        on each of them,        

52
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,830
       although only one        
       was worth reading.       

53
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:26,765
 The rest were the usual fluff. 

54
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,401
     You say that like it's     
          a bad thing.          

55
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,643
      <i> In The Storm</i> is the      
    new Rachel Harson novel.    

56
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:41,546
    I'm sure it'll be a best    
seller too, but I don't get it. 

57
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:43,682
        Have some kabob.        

58
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:44,750
      You've lost weight.       

59
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,886
 ( speaking foreign language )  

60
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,923
    I have an offer for you.    

61
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,892
  We'll have the wedding here,  

62
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:58,030
        a big wedding, a        
       beautiful wedding.       

63
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:03,669
    In return, you will do a    
   big feature on Ms. Harson.   

64
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,775
    And we'll put it on the     
   cover of the online issue    

65
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:14,746
     as well as three pages     
   in the print publication.    

66
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:15,981
            Uh-huh.             

67
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,016
     You've been asking to      
     write feature stories.     

68
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,618
      Here's your chance.       

69
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,522
 Rachel Harson,<i> The Real Story.</i> 

70
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,591
 Darling, go and interview her. 

71
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:31,830
   Write classy stuff, and I    
promise we won't change a word. 

72
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,334
      You know she doesn't      
        give interviews.        

73
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,035
  She hasn't met my daughter.   

74
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,440
             Right.             

75
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,609
            Shirin!             

76
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,745
           My dress!            

77
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:47,946
            Shirin!             

78
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:52,751
           ( music )            

79
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,753
           Oh, shoot!           

80
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,022
              Oh.               

81
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,024
      Is that beer coming?      

82
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:00,525
        Shirin: Coming!         

83
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,760
           Thank you.           

84
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:03,795
      Hey, Vicky, it's me.      

85
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,765
    Um, I have an emergency.    

86
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,034
     No, not another fire.      

87
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,570
   Um, do you have any beer?    

88
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,743
           ( music )            

89
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,383
       Vicky: Hello boys.       

90
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,085
             Hello.             

91
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,920
           Hi Vicky.            

92
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:38,029
 ( speaking foreign language )  

93
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,498
      Who is this blondie?      

94
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,600
       Take it easy, man.       
       That's a patient.        

95
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,102
        She's a patient?        

96
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,603
     Yeah. I wouldn't mind      
   giving her a filling, huh?   

97
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,438
     I would love to adjust     
         her tailbone.          

98
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,906
   Chick, chick, chick, pow.    

99
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,941
   You're not even a doctor.    
     You're a chiropractor.     

100
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,510
  That's a glorified masseuse.  

101
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,578
       I make people walk       
     with beautiful forms.      

102
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,546
        What do you do?         

103
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,014
   Fill up their phenomenals?   

104
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,549
       Thank you so much.       

105
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,850
           Of course.           

106
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:02,421
       Oh, how romantic.        

107
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,624
     After all these years,     
 Mike still sends you flowers.  

108
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:09,127
  American men never do that.   

109
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,563
             Here.              

110
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,864
       Thanks, beautiful.       

111
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,501
             Ba ba!             

112
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,070
        Tastes so good!         

113
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,875
              Ooh!              

114
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,745
          ( laughing )          

115
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,560
      Mike is so adorable.      

116
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:44,563
         He did such a          
      great job on these.       

117
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,097
     You should feel them.      

118
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,767
     -Oh, oh. No. I'm good.     
         -Are you sure?         

119
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,503
             -Yeah.             
          -Okay. Okay.          

120
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:55,974
    The tall one...the other    
    doctor...is he married?     

121
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,543
              No.               
       He's not married.        

122
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:02,214
I'm Iranian. I got a chandelier 
       in my car hanging,       

123
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:03,849
 just chandelier just hanging.  

124
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,884
   Tone it down, man. You're    
   a little creepy right now.   

125
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:09,054
   I want to be married too!    
          I love her!           

126
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:12,090
     I could look at her...     
    one of her hair all day     

127
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,894
and just wonder why did it wave 
like this instead of like that? 

128
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:17,596
   What are you reading now?    

129
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:18,730
              Hmm?              

130
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,632
         Oh, it's a new         
      Rachel Harson novel.      

131
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,868
     Oh, she has a new one?     

132
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,736
      Yeah,<i> In The Storm.</i>       

133
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,238
    That's an advanced copy.

       It's her best yet.       

136
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,177
   Once I'm done reading it,    
    I'll let you borrow it,

        some more beer.         

138
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,680
        Forget the beer.        

139

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,450
         Oh, thank you.         

258
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,253
              Uh.               

259
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,989
          Where is he?          

260
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,024
      I'm gonna kill him!       

261
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,058
     I don't know how this      
    happened, Mike. I swear.    

262
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,461
      What am I gonna do?       

263
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,430
  Mom: I had a call from Rick   
     Davidson this morning.     

264
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,432
      Shirin had a little       
       too much to drink        

265
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,768
      so she asked Rick to      
     give her a lift home.      

266
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,536
 And ended up in bed with him?  

267
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:49,374
           Oh my God!           
 ( speaking foreign language )  

268
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:51,409
             -Here.             
          -Thank you.           

269
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,379
    Dr. June, you'll be very    
         happy to know          

270
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:57,148
       that as soon as he       
 brought her back to his hotel, 

271
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,585
        he went straight        
   to his boyfriend, Trevor.    

272
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:06,357
      You should never let      
      her drink in public!      

273
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,658
           Calm down.           

274
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,427
           Thank you.           

275
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:18,569
           ( music )            

276
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,811
         Helen: Uh, oh.         

277
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,281
         Ha. I knew it.         

278
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,186
 Sweetheart, that's a red hair. 

279
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:39,791
Do you see any other red-headed 
  Asians walking around here?   

280
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,735
Uh, major health code violation.

281
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,021
      I'm not eating this.      

282
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,306
     Helen, I need to talk      
     to you about something     
       kind of important.       

283
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,546
      I just found out my       
     mother is really sick.     

284
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,816
           I'm sorry.           

285
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,651
        That's terrible.        

286
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:10,154
  They don't think she's gonna  
 make it to her next birthday.  

287
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:16,461
       I need more wine.        

288
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,597
          It's empty.           

289
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,607
      Can I have...are you      
       gonna eat... that?       

290
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,709
           -Go ahead.           
          -Yeah? Okay.          

291
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,111
           Thank you.           

292
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,179
    Broccoli, the long ones.    

293
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:38,382
It's like a combination between 
    asparagus and broccoli.     

294
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,753
       These are so good.       
          ( slurping )          

295
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,789
         -Thanks, babe.         
          -All right.           

296
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,527
       Please be careful        
     and don't drive fast.      

297
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,162
            Oh, dad.            

298
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:53,398
    She couldn't drive fast     
     even if she wanted to.     

299
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,633
     I can't believe you'd      
    rather drive seven hours    
     in this piece of junk      

300
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,586
       instead of taking        
       a one hour flight.       

301
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:01,538
    You know I hate to fly,     
   and please don't call Zuzu   
        a piece of junk.        

302
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,308
    You know I don't want to    
   put my first car to sleep.   

303
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,211
        The keys are in         
      the ignition honey.       

304
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,679
            Oh yeah.            
         ( starts car )         

305
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,348
   And you got the GPS, too?    

306
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,584
      Uh, yep, and I have       
      this just as backup.      

307
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,819
       Where's your ring?       

308
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,289
        Oh, uh, I'm sure        
    it'll pop up somewhere.     

309
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,490
           Oh my God.           
          You lost it?          

310
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,892
     How could you lose...?     
           Oh my God.           

311
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,445
   Do you know how long that    
   ring's been in my family?    

312
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:26,196
   Since my great-great-great   
 grandmother five generations!  

313
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,669
  Dr. June...Dr. June...don't   
 let your blood pressure go up. 

314
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,671
       I didn't lose it.        

315
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,373
     I just can't find it.      

316
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,308
      She didn't lose it.       

317
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,444
          She lost it!          

318
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,579
     No. She can't find it.     
       That's different.        

319
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,814
   Mike: What if she lost it?   
     What's the difference?     

320
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,650
        No, no, no, no.         

321
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:48,486
      She didn't lose it.       
    She just can't find it.     

322
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,354
    But it's the same thing!    
          She lost it!          

323
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,722
          No, no, no.           
    It's not the same thing.    

324
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,191
    She just can't find it.     

325
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:54,926
      ( foreign language )      

326
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,863
          She lost it.          

327
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,800
           ( music )            

328
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,674
   Ooh, there she goes again.   

329
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,676
         Start the car!         
         Start the car!         

330
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,544
         ( starts car )         

331
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,413
       ( tires screech )        

332
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,649
           ( sirens )           

333
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,385
      Officer Washington:       
         You know what?         

334
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,787
      Let me handle this.       

335
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,327
Good morning, Officer Henderson.

336
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,494
       It's coffee, okay?       

337
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,264
       It's coffee and I        
    spilled it chasing you!     

338
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,499
        I stopped at the        
      stop sign, didn't I?      

339
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,867
           No, ma'am.           
      No, you didn't stop.      

340
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:40,238
        You didn't stop         
       at the stop sign.        

341
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,883
   I sent your manuscript to    
    an agent friend of mine.    

342
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:00,891
         You know what?         

343
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,361
       My new partner is        
 sitting back in the car there. 

344
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,529
 It's not gonna work this time. 

345
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,031
              Oh.               

346
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:11,302
   That's all right. No, oh.    
       I know the number.       

347
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,308
             O six.             
        Let me tell ya.         

348
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,013
     Are you leaving town?      

349
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:23,414
           Yes, sir.            

350
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,316
Are you leaving for a long time?

351
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:26,984
           -Yes, sir.           
             -Good!             

352
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:34,992
       Officer Henderson,       
     have you thought about     
     changing that ending?      

353
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,461
       ( officer sighs )        

354
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,834
Well, I thought about, you know,
      when he kills her...      

355
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,836
    I thought maybe I'd make    
     that a dream sequence.     

356
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:47,538
              Oh.               

357
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,775
      Dream sequences are       
  kind of a movie thing. So...  

358
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,514
         I don't know.          

359
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:59,583
        You let me think        
      about it, all right?      

360
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,819
          Promise me.           

361
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,056
       If you stay off my       
    street for a few weeks,     

362
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:07,458
      I'm not gonna write       
      you a ticket, okay?       

363
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,960
           I promise.           
            Promise.            

364
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,996
         -You promise?          
           -Promise.            

365
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,398
      'Cause I don't want       
      to see you anymore.       

366
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:18,002
       Thank you, Marvin.       

367
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:21,038
         ( starts car )         

368
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:29,647
           ( music )            

369
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:43,127
            Driving,           
    Singing on the highway     

370
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,966
    Starin' at the skyline    

371
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,469
      Floating in space       

372
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,674
          Hey there           

373
00:22:56,676 --> 00:23:00,544
    Scoot a little closer     

374
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:04,382
 What's your favorite color?  

375
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,751
        Posies in May         

376
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:13,157
    So lovely on my pillow    

377
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,628
 Spinning webs with rainbows  

378
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,665
  Sending telegrams to Mars   

379
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:23,501
         ( thundering )         

380
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:25,169
         Just my luck.          

381
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,477

     to drown in the ocean?     

386
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,020
        There's no left.

00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,894
            Sunday

397
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,558

400
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,162
          Rachel: Yes?          
        May I help you?         

401
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,064
              Hi.               
    Yeah, my car broke down.    

402
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,565
     Can I use your phone?      

403
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,133
            Oh sure.            
          Come on in.           

404
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,702
           Thank you.           

405
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:06,537
              Oh.               

406
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:08,772
        I locked myself         
         out of my car.         

407
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,825
              Oh.               

408
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:12,877
    You better wipe yourself    
 off before you get pneumonia.  

409
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,081
      Clearly, that's not       
     gonna work so I'll get     
      you a bigger towel.       

410
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,782
            Thanks.             

411
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,920
             Here.              

412
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,590
          -Thank you.           
      -Oh, you're welcome.      

413
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:30,160
    Oh. You know, why don't     
    you make the call later.    

414
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,695
        Come on with me.        

415
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:36,567
     Yeah, just follow me.      
          That's good.          

416
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:48,012
          Come on in.           
        Sit by the fire.        

417
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,147
  I don't want to bother you.   

418
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,149
     If you could just give     
    me a number for a taxi,     

419
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:55,953
       I'll go to a hotel       
      and find somebody to      
      help me with my car?      

420
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,955
        You're not from         
     around here, are you?      

421
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,157
              No.               
          Los Angeles.          

422
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,927
   Because the closest hotel    
    is about 20 miles away,     

423
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,930
      no one is gonna come      
   out here in this weather.    

424
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:07,565
       Stay here tonight.       

425
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,800
      You can take care of      
   everything in the morning.   

426
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,769
        Oh, that is way         
       too much trouble.        

427
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:15,306
     No. Shh. I don't want      
       to hear about it.        

428
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:16,907
       Please, sit down.        

429
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,277
            Well...             

430
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,280
     I don't know. I really     
     shouldn't be drinking.     

431
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:27,217
   You know, if you have just   
    one keeps you very warm.    

432
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,621
             Okay.              

433
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,024
         There you go.          

434
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,859
            Thanks.             

435
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,661
        You're welcome.         

436
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,234
     So, what are you doing     
          around here?          

437
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:45,369
             Work.              

438
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:46,770
       I'm a journalist.        

439
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,138
      You're a journalist?      

440
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,741
 Well, not really a journalist. 

441
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:53,377
       I'm more of a book       
    reviewer for a magazine.    

442
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:55,079
    I'm looking for someone.    

443
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:57,915
        She's an author.        
   Her name is Rachel Harson.   

444
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,017
              Hmm.              

445
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,922
         May I ask why?         

446
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:08,993
Uh, I'm writing a story on her, 

447
00:27:08,995 --> 00:27:12,096
    although I'm pretty sure    
     she won't talk to me.      

448
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:14,865
        She seems like a        
    pretty difficult woman.     

449
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,403
  You know, that's funny. I've  
heard the same thing about her. 

450
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:27,077
       What magazine did        
     you say you wrote for?     

451
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,979
           BH Style.            

452
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,147
     Have you heard of it?      

453
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:33,917
     No, but I'm...I'm not      
       a magazine person.       

454
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,786
    I'm sure it's very nice.    

455
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:39,757
Uh, truth is, it's my first big 
 assignment so I'm a little...  

456
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,325
       So you're nervous?       

457
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,661
        Yeah ( laughs )         

458
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,964
      Let's not talk about      
     work anymore tonight.      

459
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,899
         You're tired.          
      You need your rest.       

460
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,701
      Take that with you.       

461
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,202
             Okay.              

462
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:53,837
       You're very kind.        

463
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,073
   Oh, you have found me out.   

464
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:07,751
         ( door opens )         

465
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,188
     This is my son's room.     

466
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,758
Well, at least it was his room. 

467
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,004
       Oh, he's so cute!        

468
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,006
        Yes, he is cute.        

469
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:51,962
             Okay.              

470
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,868
         I'm so sorry.          

471
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,837
  I didn't even recognize you.  

472
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,039
         Why would you?         
       See that picture?        

473
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:04,108
         That was taken         
         30 years ago.          

474
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:08,145
        Anyway, you need        
       to get your sleep.       

475
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,315
          Good night.           

476
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:13,417
          Good night.           

477
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,036
           ( music )            

478
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,118
          ( coughing )          

479
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:02,933
      ( distant talking )       

480
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,441
         -The emotion.          
             -Yes!              

481
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:12,976
      -So go to Kailee's.       
             -Okay.             

482
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,578
     I got a flat of little     
         teeny flowers.         

483
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,346
    Will: That reminds me...    

484
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:19,349
 Rachel: I want to put it back  
     there near the stones.     

485
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,718
      Just bring 'em back.      

486
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,086
      Everything's looking      
      so raggedy, and I've      
   been out there every day.    

487
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,557
        Hi, Mrs. Harson.        
        ( hoarse voice )        

488
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,358
            Oh, hi.             

489
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,093
              No.               

490
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:33,463
      No, not...not...no,       
     not you again. Uh-uh.      

491
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,932
        Rachel: You two         
        know each other?        

492
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,884
     Will: Yeah, I'm sorry.     

493
00:30:36,885 --> 00:30:38,835
    I don't want to be rude,    
     but we don't want any      
    journalists in my house.    

494
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,504
     I...I don't know what      
     you're talking about.      

495
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,273
    Don't strain your voice.    

496
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,041
  You know, this is my house.   
   She's a guest in my house.   

497
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:45,609
   Mom, she is a journalist.    
   You know what that means?    

498
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,144
          She told me           
      she's a book critic.      

499
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:48,612
            -Really?            
        -You know? Yes.         

500
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:49,880
 Will: Can I talk to you alone  
         for a second.          

501
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:51,715
         Wait a minute!         
         Just sit down.         

502
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:53,549
    First of all, I'm gonna     
    take Shirin and put her     
     back into the bedroom.     

503
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,252
         Go on, honey.          

504
00:30:56,488 --> 00:31:00,524
 You are really embarrassing me 
     in front of my guest!      

505
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,426
            Really?             

506
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,327
      Shirin...how do you       
      even know her name?       

507
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,997
        Why is she here?        

508
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,905
    She is not feeling well.    

509
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:16,240
    I think she has a little    
     bit of a temperature,      

510
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:19,142
   so she might have to stay    
        a night or two.         

511
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,544
     Another night or two?      

512
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:24,448
      I don't want to talk      
    anymore about it, okay?     

513
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,116
           Thank you.           

514
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,590
     She's cute, isn't she?     

515
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,129
    She thinks you're cute.     

516
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:45,569
  Here. Take that perfect tray  
          and be nice.          

517
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,404
          Yes, ma'am.           

518
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,985
     I'm sorry to intrude.      

519
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:04,554
          -I'll leave.          
            -No, no.            

520
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,924
        I'm...I'm sorry.        

521
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,927
     I, um, you know...what     
      happened back there.      

522
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,195
     Let's see if I can...      

523
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,498
   Man, you know, I knew that   
     was gonna happen too.      

524
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,466
          -I'm sorry.           
          -It's okay.           

525
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,635
       It's kind of been        
       one of those days.       

526
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,671
              Oh.               

527
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:24,791
           I'm sorry.           

528
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:27,009
    I'll, um...I'll get you     
    some more orange juice.     

529
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:28,979
        -I'll get you...        
            -Oh, no.            

530
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:30,681
           ( coughs )           

531
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:32,516
      Shirin: Sorry again.      

532
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,086
 Where have I seen you before?  

533
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:39,690
  Um, I think...I think we met  
  at a...at a party one time.   

534
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:43,093
   Please, sit down. I don't    
  want you to ruin your voice.  

535
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,462
            -Thanks.            
             -Yeah.             

536
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:47,965
           Um, great.           

537
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:50,367
            Thanks.             

538
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,369
             Yeah.              

539
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:55,038
           Happy boy.           

540
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,276
         Huh? Oh. Yeah.         

541
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,512
  I don't know why my mom has   
            that...             

542
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:09,319
    Yeah, I wasn't quite as     
happy as...as I looked here, but
             uh...              

543
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:13,223
      but I was an amazing      
   chess player, so you know?   

544
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,225
  A bit of a loner, you know?   

545
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:21,732
             Zuzu.              

546
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,166
              Huh?              
      What'd you call me?       

547
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,268
         Zuzu. My car.          

548
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,269
              Oh.               

549
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,105
      You dropped a grape.      

550
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:30,307
       Five second rule.        
    You can still eat that.     

551
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:31,875
           Thank you.           

552
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,442
      Yeah, I noticed that      
    you got the blue beetle.    

553
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,511
             Yeah.              

554
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,779
    I used to have a beetle.    

555
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:38,615
      Um, it was my first       
           car, so...           

556
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:40,217
           Thank you.           

557
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:42,085
      ( car horn honking )      

558
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:47,324
   Oh, um, I got to take off.   

559
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:48,358
             Okay.              

560
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,293
        Yeah, but um...         

561
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:53,463
         -Thanks again.         
      -Yeah. Feel better.       

562
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:55,232
         Take it easy.          

563
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,542
      ( car horn honking )      

564
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,712
       Please, tell your        
      friend not to honk.       

565
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,180
     Her name's Helen, mom.     

566
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:11,681
       It's been that way       
        for seven years.        

567
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,051
      I'll tell her. Bye.       

568
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:37,174
       ( phone ringing )        

569
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,408
           Answer it!           

570
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,277
      I'm too hysterical!       

571
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:53,623
             Hello?             

572
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,327
              Yes.              

573
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,831
          Is she okay?          

574
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,702
      Thank you. Thank you      
     very much for calling.     

575
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:07,504
            Goodbye.            

576
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:10,440
             Well?              

577
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:14,344
          She is fine.          

578
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,513
    That was Rachel Harson.     

579
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:19,182
         Rachel Harson?         

580
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,717
            Herself?            

581
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,552
        Shirin is sick.         

582
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:25,288
     She has a high fever.      

583
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,890
             Great.             

584
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,159
             Great?             

585
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:31,128
   Are you out of your mind.    

586
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,263
       Don't you get it?        

587
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,899
It's Rachel Harson, the writer. 

588
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,801
          She got her.          

589
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,270
      That's my daughter.       

590
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:43,573
 Rachel: "Harson's latest work  
    is a literary sensation     

591
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:46,743
      combining a magical       
  illumination of the ordinary  

592
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,445
    with exquisite lyricism     

593
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,680
      laced with elegance       
        and compassion.         

594
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:54,417
      A tragic love story       
      which brings to mind      
   the best of Annie Poole."    

595
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:58,722
       Oh, hey, the best        
    she gives it four stars.    

596
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:01,258
          ( laughing )          

597
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,894
        Hey, you're not         
   supposed to be out of bed.   

598
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:06,363
      Oh, I'm feeling much      
       better, thank you.       

599
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,732
      Let me get a chair.       

600
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:10,901
     Yes, you have to eat!      

601
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:13,737
            -Thanks.            
             -Yeah.             

602
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:14,938
    You want some meatloaf?     

603
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,373
             Yeah.              

604
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:18,575
         Some meatloaf.         

605
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:24,381
            -Thanks.            
            -Uh-huh.            

606
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,483
      Um, I almost forgot.      

607
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,919
   You, uh...you left these.    

608
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:33,757
   Oh. Thank you. Thank you.    
   I'm always losing things.    

609
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,692
         I'm hopeless.          

610
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,626
    No, you are not, and I'm    
   gonna tell you why missy.    

611
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:38,862
           See this?            

612
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,431
    We just read the review.    

613
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:42,866
   You're a fantastic writer.   

614
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,668
     William, tell her how      
          good she is.          

615
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,769
          You're good.          

616
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,337
          ( laughing )          

617
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,838
  Where did you go to school?   

618
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,974
         Uh, Oxford for         
     undergrad and then...      

619
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:52,876
            -Oxford.            
         -Columbia Law.         

620
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,444
         Columbia Law?          

621
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,279
Now, I'm learning how to write. 

622
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,781
    Hey, don't be so modest.    

623
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,950
  You are a very good writer.   

624
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,652
       Oh, that means so        
     much coming from you.      

625
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,721
           Thank you.           
           ( laughs )           

626
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,656
       Do you write, too?       

627
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,658
            Um, me?             

628
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,627
        No, I, um...why?        

629
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,296
         Uh, your room.         
        All those books.        

630
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:14,965
      Oh, that's my fault.      

631
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:16,633
       See, I used to be        
       an English teacher       

632
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:19,002
     so I made him read all     
     the books that I love.     

633
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:19,869
      And it was horrible.      

634
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,705
          It was not!           

635
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,641
 Yeah. I didn't think a teenage 
boy would read all the classics,

636
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:26,476
      especially the ones       
       written by women.        

637
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,445
    He's a very unusual man.    

638
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:31,748
    Elizabeth Bishop is one     
     of my favorite poets.      

639
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,351
I hope you don't mind, but I was
 going through your collection  

640
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:39,022
  of poetry in your room, and   
loved the notes in the margins. 

641
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,891
      This is not like the      
      big city, you know.       

642
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,760
        He had a lot of         
    problems as a teenager.     

643
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,795
    -I don't mean problems.     
        -It was boring.         

644
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,865
    I know...not for me but,    
     you know, for William.     

645
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,001
              Hmm.              

646
00:37:58,477 --> 00:38:00,443
       Rachel: Good huh?        

647
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,047
  I'd love to get the recipe.   

648
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:08,318
Oh, well I just put it together.
It's his recipe. He is the chef.

649
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:11,488
   Oh, you know, my father's    
  the chef in our house, too.   

650
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,557
            -Really?            
          -Um, shoot.           

651
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:16,826
  -You know what? I got to...   
    -You got to go to work?     

652
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:20,630
       Yeah. Um, you guys       
          enjoy. Okay?          

653
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,766
           And uh...            

654
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:24,801
          -I love you.          
          -I love you.          

655
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,837
         And um, yeah.          

656
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,839
          -Good night.          
          -Good night.          

657
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,445
             Here.              

658
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:37,013
       Have some veggies.       

659
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,551
   Then we'll have some tea.    

660
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,721
     He's so good looking.      

661
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:50,660
        He lives in that        
   lighthouse down the road.    

662
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:55,865
      When the weather is       
     really, really stormy,     

663
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:59,002
he listens to the radio in case 
      somebody needs help.      

664
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,507
          Interesting.          

665
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,847
 His father died 12 years ago.  

666
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:14,351
      In a horrible storm.      

667
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:20,857
    The Coast Guard couldn't    
       pick up the signal       
    because it was too weak,    

668
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:28,098
   and William left New York,   
        moved back here         

669
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,067
  and bought a whole bunch of   
   high tech radio equipment,   

670
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:40,877
    and he sits there and he    
     listens to the radio.      

671
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,880
      And he can hear even      
      the weakest signal.       

672
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:47,684
         I am so sorry.         

673
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:50,887
         I had no idea.         

674
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,396
       Oh, just like the        
  character from<i> In The Storm.</i>  

675
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:03,933
         I suppose I'm          
 revealing some family secrets. 

676
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,102
            Oh, no.             

677
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:08,738
        I am definitely         
       off duty tonight.        

678
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,141
         No, you write.         
    You write what you want.    

679
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:12,642
      You write the truth.      

680
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,644
     I don't have a problem     
           with that.           

681
00:40:16,148 --> 00:40:19,048
       And I wish William       
    would just stop hiding.     

682
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:24,487
       ( phone ringing )        

683
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,956
       Oh, I'm...I'm sure       
        that's for you.         

684
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,125
   -Do you mind answering it?   
             -Okay.

689
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,974
          Yeah, yeah.           
   I'm feeling a lot better.    

690
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,776
     Uh, I have to go now.      

691
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,778
    I'll call you tomorrow.

           -Morning!            
              -Hi.              

700
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,519
     So, I, uh, stopped by      
    the store this morning.     

701
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,621
I got cinnamon hazelnut coffee. 
         We're all set.         

702
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:33,690
   Honey, you didn't have to    
    go to all that trouble.     

703
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:35,859
           It's fine.           

704
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:37,193
      You look like you're      
        feeling better.         

705
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,995
          Yeah. I am.           
            Thanks.             

706
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,730
             Good.              

707
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,833
    You know what, William?     

708
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:47,937
   Why don't you take Shirin    
    out for a lovely drive?     

709
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:49,672
      Oh no. I have to...       

710
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,241
       I have to get back       
         to L.A. so...          

711
00:41:51,243 --> 00:41:53,076
             Yeah.              
       It's a long drive.       

712
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,611
             Yeah.              

713
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:56,880
        Honey, she came         
      all the way up here,      

714
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:59,849
   now don't you want to see    
  how beautiful everything is?  

715
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,652
      What a good idea to       
   get out and get some air!    

716
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:04,421
       <i> What a great idea!</i>      

717
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:06,189
  Mom, there's not... there's   
    not much to see. Really.    

718
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,208
  What are you talking about?   

719
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:10,226
   She's all the way up here,   
   and you're not gonna show    
          her around?           

720
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:14,264
    Honey, wait 'til you see    
  the beauty of the landscape   
        and the flowers.        

721
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:16,566
     So what do you think?      
          A good idea?          

722
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,268
          Okay. Good.           

723
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:25,542
           ( music )            

724
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:53,903
     Shirin: Wow. I see why     
 Rachel's work is so inspired.  

725
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:57,707
      This is magnificent.      

726
00:42:57,709 --> 00:43:00,810
    This is the main setting    
for<i> Under Blue Skies,</i> isn't it? 

727
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,679
             Yeah.              

728
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:09,285
      So what do you want       
        to write about?         

729
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:13,122
     Oh come on. You got a      
   novel in there, don't ya?    

730
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:16,726
    What makes you say that?    

731
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:19,228
     Maybe it helps that I      
  have a writer in the family.  

732
00:43:24,002 --> 00:43:25,635
       So why'd you stop?       

733
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:28,805
    Who says I ever started?    

734
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:31,808
            Really?             

735
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:40,149
     Okay, I've written 600     
  pages, but I haven't touched  
    it in nearly two years.     

736
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:43,686
           -Why not?            
   -Fear of failure probably.   

737
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:47,924
What if no one wants to read it?
       What if it's bad?        

738
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:50,193
    Just write another one.     

739
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:53,329
      Easy for you to say.      

740
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:58,368
    I need to move somewhere    
    peaceful so I can write.    

741
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,236
     Definitely old enough      
     to go out on your own.     

742
00:44:03,074 --> 00:44:04,273
       How did you know I       
     live with my parents?      

743
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:05,808
           I guessed.           
           I'm sorry.           

744
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,312
       I, um, the way you       
      were dressed and uh,      

745
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:12,215
        your mannerisms.        
           It was...            

746
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,851
   Well, just so you know, I    
 didn't have much of an income  

747
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:16,986
       after I graduated        
      so I had no choice.       

748
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,956
       -I just decided...       
     -Yeah, I...I'm sorry.      

749
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:23,693
 That was none of my business.  

750
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:37,006
           ( music )            

751
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:15,912
       You are so lucky.        

752
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,481
    Yeah, it's not too bad.     

753
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:25,088
 So, Mr. Adventure, why do you  
  still live with your mother?  

754
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:29,125
   I don't live with my mom.    

755
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:30,426
      I live next to her.       

756
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:31,494
             Right.             

757
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:34,197
   Like...right next to her.    

758
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:37,167
           ( laughs )           

759
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:40,136
  Next to her, and if you must  
know, the truth is is that, um, 

760
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:43,005
   I live next to her because   
        she's not well.         

761
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:47,009
              Oh.               

762
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,078
           I'm sorry.           

763
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:51,648
     Perhaps you're right.      

764
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:53,816
        Maybe I miss her        
   cooking just a little bit.   

765
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:58,454
       Anything else you        
        want to pick on.        

766
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:02,492
 Well, I mean, since you asked. 

767
00:46:02,494 --> 00:46:04,360
       You should really        
     get some new clothes.      

768
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:06,062
   You don't dress very well.   

769
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:08,064
  Now, you're gonna go there?   

770
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:12,869
All right. At least I don't look
like a dentist assistant, so... 

771
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:14,804
      A dentist assistant,      
            really?             

772
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:17,173
            -Uh-huh.            
 -'Cause this is your sweater.  

773
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,776
     And you wear it well.      

774
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:24,413
            Thanks.             

775
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,523
           ( music )            

776
00:47:03,054 --> 00:47:07,290
       ( waves crashing )       

777
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:29,045
  Rachel: William has created   
     his own little world,      

778
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:32,248
      and Helen is one of       
     the few people in it.      

779
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,218
     He doesn't really meet     
          new people.           

780
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,487
         How long have          
      they been together?       

781
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:43,259
       Oh, I'd say about        
   seven years give or take.    

782
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:47,129
   You see, when he came back   
         from New York,         

783
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:50,266
  his spirits were really low.  

784
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:54,570
 He was drinking too much, and  
he knew Helen from high school. 

785
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,306
      She was the manager       
       of the local bar,        

786
00:47:57,308 --> 00:47:59,609
which was his favorite hangout. 

787
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:01,944
She was really a good influence.

788
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:06,949
  She was his friend, kind of   
   brought him back to life.    

789
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:10,119
              Hmm.              

790
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:12,255
              So?               

791
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:16,225
    What about you? I mean,     
    do you have a boyfriend?    

792
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,127
          Are you...?           

793
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:20,196
     I'm actually engaged.      

794
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,432
        I lost my ring.         

795
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,368
         I'm an idiot.          

796
00:48:26,037 --> 00:48:27,637
        His name's Mike.        

797
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:31,240
    Our families have known     
 each other since we were kids. 

798
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:33,910
  Now, he's a plastic surgeon.  

799
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,013
        Really nice guy.        

800
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,682
    My mom really loves him.    

801
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,918
    I'm very happy for you.     

802
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:44,520
            Thanks.             

803
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,958
      Okay, I'm gonna pry.      

804
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,028
      Why are you writing       
         for BH Style?          

805
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,596
           ( laughs )           

806
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,932
   Because my mom's the owner   

807
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:01,070
   and because I'm a coward.    

808
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:06,108
  I think you're very special.  

809
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,212
            Thanks.             

810
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:13,716
    Let me get some coffee.     
 I don't know if you want any.  

811
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,387
              Ugh!              

812
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:21,257
            Rachel?             

813
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:22,558
            Rachel?             

814
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,026
              Oh.               

815
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:30,199
     You know, I was always     
     afraid that something      
     like this would happen     

816
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:32,001
    when I wasn't with her.     

817
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:39,342
        I'm grateful you        
      were there for her.       

818
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:43,112
       You can't be there       
         all the time.          

819
00:49:47,118 --> 00:49:49,318
   I'm glad I was there too.    

820
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:55,524
          ( coughing )          

821
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,666
   I didn't know you smoked.    

822
00:50:04,736 --> 00:50:06,535
            I don't.            

823
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,206
          ( coughing )          

824
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:14,076
         Give me that.          

825
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:19,081
        It's a hospital.        

826
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:30,426
        ( ocean waves )         

827
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:32,745
           You know,            

828
00:50:32,746 --> 00:50:35,063
    the dialogue in Rachel's    
   novels feel so authentic.    

829
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:38,801
        She must rely on        
       your help, right?        

830
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,571
         Next question.         

831
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:46,375
           I'm sorry.           
     I didn't mean to pry.      

832
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:50,312
    It's just Rachel really     
      knows how to capture      
     this place, you know?      

833
00:50:50,748 --> 00:50:53,482
     The sea, the villages      
   where the fishermen live.    

834
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:58,120
      She has such strong       
   insight into the pain her    
     characters are feeling     

835
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:03,159
 and yet there's such optimism  
  and romance in her writing.   

836
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:06,195
    I'm sure she'll be happy    
     to hear your analysis.     

837
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:12,201
   You, on the other hand, I    
  can't quite figure you out.   

838
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:19,475
I mean, if Rachel bases all her 
   characters on real people,   

839
00:51:19,477 --> 00:51:21,577
      where do you fit in?      

840
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:26,215
       You're James, from       
         <i> In the Storm.</i>         

841
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:28,417
      Absolutely not. No.       
           ( laughs )           

842
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,619
     There's no way Rachel      
      bases a sailor on me      

843
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:33,656
  because I put one foot into   
   a boat, and I turn green.    

844
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:36,325
             Yeah.              

845
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:39,195
         And my father,         
      on the other hand...      

846
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,266
   that guy was a fisherman.    

847
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,570
        So Rachel wrote         
        about your dad.         

848
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:49,538
         I don't know.          
             Maybe.             

849
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,110
    I mean, can you imagine,    

850
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:56,545
  I had to grow up in this...   
       this fishing town.       

851
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,714
        My father's this        
        great fisherman,        

852
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:02,885
     and I get sea sick the     
 minute I... I step in a boat.  

853
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:08,724
       It was a disaster.       

854
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,761
     I think you turned out     
           all right.           

855
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,402
       Will you come sit        
          next to me?           

856
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:26,775
   You just seem so far away.   

857
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,550
            Please?             

858
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,356
    I don't bite, you know.     
          I'm just...           

859
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:49,231
          So, William,          
   where did we meet before?    

860
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:50,900
          What party?           

861
00:52:50,902 --> 00:52:55,171
 Most guys don't greet me with, 
    "Oh no, not you again."     

862
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:59,275
      Yeah, it was a...it       
     was like a month ago.      

863
00:52:59,277 --> 00:53:03,245
    Some fancy Persian party    
  in a Beverly Hills mansion.   

864
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:08,284
    Darling, I promised Roya    
    that we're going to have    
 grandchildren before too long, 

865
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:10,252
    and you're not going to     
    disappoint us, are you?     

866
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:11,587
        I'll do my best.        

867
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:13,255
         Don't keep on          
      touching your hair.       

868
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:17,593
            Oh yeah.            
       My mother's party.       

869
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:19,862
       I had way too much       
      to drink that night.      

870
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,630
        Uh, yes you did.        

871
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:24,433
  I don't know why my mom buys  
  all these dreadful paintings  

872
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:26,802
    when they're such great     
        artists in L.A.         

873
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,805
     -Couldn't agree more.      
            -Uh-huh.            

874
00:53:30,308 --> 00:53:34,376
I'm Sylvia Nelson, the purveyor 
     of second rate dribble     

875
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,912
you tore apart in your magazine.

876
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:39,448
          Uh, oh gosh.          

877
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,850
   Did I do something stupid?   

878
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:43,352
              No.               

879
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:45,688
    I mean, yeah, you really    
     were wobbly. But uh...     

880
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:48,624
       I'm glad you found       
     something to look at.      

881
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,292
        -This is Shirin.        
     -Pleasure to meet you.     

882
00:53:50,294 --> 00:53:51,427
             Great.             

883
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,728
       She's pretty cute.       

884
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,898
        Oh, well I was a        
     human rights attorney,     

885
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,967
 and I...I gave it up to write. 

886
00:53:57,969 --> 00:53:59,935
     She's a book reviewer      
       for the magazine.        

887
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:02,471
           -This one?           
            -Uh-huh.            

888
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:04,940
And a big fan of Rachel Harson. 

889
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:08,544
    You are a terrible liar.    

890
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:09,745
    You're just like my dad.    

891
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,614
       Your left eyebrow        
     goes up when you lie.      

892
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,533
       What do you mean?        

893
00:54:13,534 --> 00:54:15,451
    Yeah. Look, you're doing    
      it again. Right now.      

894
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,653
      Doing it right now.       
             Silly.             

895
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:23,292
           Uh, great.           

896
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:26,362
           Excuse me,           
       but what about me?       

897
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:28,430
              -Uh.              
     -Since yours is full.      

898
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:32,668
  I think we just established   
   that you can't handle your   
         alcohol, so...         

899
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:35,771
           Whatever.            

900
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:40,342
        ( pours drink )         

901
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,417
        To new friends.         

902
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,721
     To loveless marriage.      

903
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:55,457
              Wow.              

904
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,426
         I mean, sorry.         

905
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:02,031
 There is nothing worse then a  
relationship that's convenient, 

906
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:06,402
    comfortable and boring.     

907
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:07,936
             Right?             

908
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,006
      I'll drink to that.       

909
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:20,449
  Man, so what's our problem?   

910
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,487
         I don't know,          

911
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:29,558
  but I do know you don't need  
        anymore of that.        

912
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,094
       No, I do not need        
        anymore of that.        

913
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:33,862
           ( laughs )           

914
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:38,934
  I told my fianc about you.   

915
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,704
      He asked me why I'm       
     so interested in a guy     

916
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,973
       who lives off his        
        mother's income,        

917
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:47,876
      sits around playing       
    with his radios all day.    

918
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,946
    Sounds like a smart guy.    

919
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,049
       I'd listen to him        
         if I were you.         

920
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:56,885
        I'm not stupid.         

921
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:04,927
 It's this the reporter in you  
 trying to get more out of me.  

922
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:06,128
           Oh my God.           

923
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:09,465
       Will you stop with       
     all the reporter crap?     

924
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:15,037
          Look at me.           

925
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,842
    You always avoid looking    
   at me directly in the eye.   

926
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,845
        No, I'm looking         
       at you right now.        

927
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:26,448
        No, you're not.         

928
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,818
          Look at me.           

929
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:44,500
        ( music swells )        

930
00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:05,454
       ( phone ringing )        

931
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,461
             Mike?              

932
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:14,797
<i>Shirin, is everything all right?</i>

933
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:16,432
         <i> I'm on my way.</i>        

934
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:18,100
 That...that's not a good idea. 

935
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,068
             <i> What?</i>             

936
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:22,504
<i>I'm having trouble hearing you!</i> 

937
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:24,706
          <i> Don't worry.</i>         
  <i> Everything is taken care of.</i> 

938
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,075
     <i> AAA will tow your car</i>     
          <i> back to L.A.</i>         

939
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:28,944
      <i> I'll be there within</i>     
      <i> an hour and then...</i>      

940
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:31,447
       That's definitely        
        not a good idea.        

941
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,015
             <i> What?</i>             

942
00:57:33,017 --> 00:57:34,082
         <i> Are you okay?</i>         

943
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,018
        Yeah, I'm fine.         

944
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,953
   Will you stop rushing me?    
   You always do that to me.    

945
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:40,456
    <i> Shirin, what's going on?</i>   

946
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:41,723
            Nothing.            

947
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,526
       I'm just having a        
       really tough day.        

948
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:46,562
     It's really busy here.     

949
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:47,863
  Can you just come tomorrow?   

950
00:57:47,865 --> 00:57:49,231
             <i> What?</i>             

951
00:57:49,233 --> 00:57:50,866
   <i> No, I can't come tomorrow.</i>  

952
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:52,518
     <i> I'm already on my way.</i>    

953
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:54,169
      Just meet me at the       
     local hospital, okay?      

954
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:56,638
         <i> What hospital?</i>        

955
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:58,941
 <i> Sweetheart, what's the matter?</i>

956
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:02,778
              Oh.               

957
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,731
              -Hi.              
              -Hi.              

958
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:25,567
        -Sorry I'm late.        
        -Late for what?         

959
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,903
    I'm not going anywhere.     

960
00:58:27,905 --> 00:58:29,204
       These are for you.       

961
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:31,073
              Oh.               

962
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:33,509
         Wild flowers.          

963
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:35,978
      They're my favorite.      
   William picks them for me.   

964
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:38,280
  I had a feeling about that.   

965
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:40,048
     You look a lot better.     

966
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,518
       Compared to what?        

967
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,019
        Did I scare ya?         

968
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,154
         Yeah. You did.         

969
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:52,628
    You look...I don't know,    
  different, beautiful, rosy.   

970
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,230
  Your cheeks are all a flush.  

971
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:58,000
      It must've been the       
     rush to get over here.     

972
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:01,036
        My fianc, Mike,        
    is coming to pick me up,    

973
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,072
   so I came to say goodbye.    

974
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:05,541
            Goodbye?            

975
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:06,875
    How about the interview?    

976
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,211
     Oh no. You don't worry     
      about the interview.      

977
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:11,580
    Please, just concentrate    
       on getting better.       

978
00:59:11,582 --> 00:59:13,882
       You saved my life.       

979
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:17,286
  I want to do the interview.   

980
00:59:17,288 --> 00:59:18,987
             I do.              

981
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:21,590
 Write down your questions and  
  put 'em on a piece of paper.  

982
00:59:21,592 --> 00:59:25,260
    Give 'em to William, and    
    he's my right hand man.     

983
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:27,112
         It'll be fine.         

984
00:59:27,113 --> 00:59:28,963
      -Rachel, I don't...       
     -Do not argue with me.     

985
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:30,899
     It's a losing battle.      

986
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,101
    I thought you knew that.    

987
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,140
   Thank you for everything.    

988
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:40,208
       I'm gonna be fine.       

989
00:59:41,712 --> 00:59:43,979
       I wish I had some        
    coffee and some cookies.    

990
00:59:43,981 --> 00:59:45,714
         You know what?         
         Get me a vase          

991
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:47,816
      from that nurse that      
       has that mustache.       

992
00:59:47,818 --> 00:59:49,651
          ( laughing )          

993
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:51,853
  Don't tell her it's for me.   
      She doesn't like me.      

994
00:59:51,855 --> 00:59:53,188
      -Oh gosh. All right.      
             -Okay?             

995
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,057
       -I...I'll get her.       
             -Okay.             

996
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,692
             Okay.              

997
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:59,094
            Bye-bye.            

998
01:00:05,836 --> 01:00:07,703
        I'm looking for         
       Ms. Rachel Harson.       

999
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:08,971
          One second.           

1000
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:16,612
    Yes, uh, room 241 to the    
 left and the immediate right.  

1001
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:18,246
           Thank you.           

1002
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:28,957
              Hi.               

1003
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,663
             What?              
       What do you want?        

1004
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:39,001
       No, I just...okay.       

1005
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:49,811
          ( giggles )           

1006
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:00,889
           ( typing )           

1007
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:16,805
           ( typing )           

1008
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:24,746
   You write on a typewriter?   

1009
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,016
    What are you doing here?    

1010
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,718
     I came to say goodbye.     

1011
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:32,387
              Oh.               

1012
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,091
        ( ocean waves )         

1013
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:38,160
     It's pretty, isn't it?     

1014
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:44,650
  You should see it at night.   

1015
01:01:44,651 --> 01:01:46,835
 if the skies are clear you can 
   see every star in the sky.   

1016
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:56,478
   I don't know what to say.    

1017
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,280
You don't have to say anything. 

1018
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,949
             I, um,             

1019
01:02:02,352 --> 01:02:04,786
      I...I want...I want       
       to say something.        

1020
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:08,757
   Ever since I met you, I...   
        ( cell ringing )        

1021
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,297
        It's my fianc.         

1022
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:18,433
     Yeah, of course it is.     

1023
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:22,471
    He's probably trying to     
     make sure he gets you      
     to the church on time.     

1024
01:02:23,107 --> 01:02:26,742
   -Always in a hurry, so...    
  -I would be to if I was him.  

1025
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,316
     What are you writing?      

1026
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:39,488
   Um, this is, uh...this is    
    my mother's manuscript.     

1027
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,857
      I'm pretty much her       
      official typer now.       

1028
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:43,325
       Can I take a peak?       

1029
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:44,993
        Can I trust you?        

1030
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,895
       You already have.        

1031
01:02:59,977 --> 01:03:01,843
   It's her most recent work.   

1032
01:03:02,846 --> 01:03:04,479
        It's beautiful.         

1033
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:07,516
        ( cell ringing )        

1034
01:03:07,518 --> 01:03:10,352
              Oh.               

1035
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:12,487
      I really have to go.      

1036
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:14,256
             Yeah.              

1037
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:23,431
    I'm glad you liked this.    

1038
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:41,216
     You have something you     
    want to give me, right?     

1039
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:46,521
 Here, um, it's not why I came. 

1040
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:48,924
         No, of course.         

1041
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:54,529
         I know there's         
    something going on here.    

1042
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,033
I just don't know what it is... 

1043
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:01,169
              yet.              

1044
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:04,072
            Goodbye.            

1045
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:06,308
           ( music )            

1046
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:08,343
              Bye.              

1047
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:24,960
       ( Persian music )        

1048
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:46,541
     ( sentimental music )      

1049
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:25,380
         This is crazy!         

1050
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:28,516
You're moving into the apartment
   of somebody you just met.    

1051
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:30,385
    You don't even know her!    

1052
01:06:30,387 --> 01:06:32,320
 What if she's a serial killer! 

1053
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,123
    Mom, you need to relax.     
      We've been Skyping.       

1054
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,391
         It's all fine.         

1055
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:38,193
            Skyping?            

1056
01:06:38,195 --> 01:06:40,195
      That's not talking.       

1057
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:43,031
      Nader, do something.      

1058
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:45,600
         What can I do?         

1059
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:51,573
        My head is fine.        
         Give me a hug.         

1060
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:54,309
              Bye.              

1061
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,750
I should've done this years ago.

1062
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:04,452
         ( starts car )         

1063
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:08,423
      Did you see the way       
        she was dressed?        

1064
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:12,494
       She gave away all        
     her beautiful clothes.     

1065
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:16,164
       What have we done        
        to deserve this?        

1066
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:21,302
       Thank you so much.       

1067
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:23,204
     Girl: You're welcome.      
  We'll see you in six months.  

1068
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,706
             Yeah.              

1069
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,574
   Have a good time you guys.   

1070
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,478
       You have a simple        
       exciting concept.        

1071
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,783
    For a novel, that's not     
    enough, but for a movie,    

1072
01:07:34,785 --> 01:07:37,152
     it could be just what      
       the studios want.        

1073
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,087
         High concept.          

1074
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:41,222
   Ooh, that's what I've got?   

1075
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,091
         High concept?          

1076
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:47,662
         I got concept.         

1077
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:50,398
         High concept.          

1078
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:57,072
 Uh, is something bugging you?  

1079
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:01,142
   You want to talk about it?   

1080
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,345
You know I got nieces your age. 

1081
01:08:07,384 --> 01:08:11,086
      I'm getting married       
       to a very nice guy       

1082
01:08:11,822 --> 01:08:14,255
       who I've been with       
     for a very long time,      

1083
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,326
     but I met someone new.     

1084
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:19,694
            Um-hmm.             

1085
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:22,297
            Uh-huh.             

1086
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:27,702
         The first one,         
        very successful,        

1087
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:33,775
      and the second one,       
    married but not so rich.    

1088
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:35,810
            Kind of.            

1089
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:38,746
  I mean, he's got a long term  
       girlfriend, so...        

1090
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:41,182
     I knew it. I knew it.      
         You know why?          

1091
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:44,152
 'Cause we police officers got  
  a good sense of psychology.   

1092
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:46,354
  So what do I do, Dr. Freud?   

1093
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:47,689
        What do you do?         

1094
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:50,825
Hell, you just run off with me! 
           ( laughs )           

1095
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:52,460
            Marvin.             

1096
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:53,628
             Okay.              

1097
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,829
   Only if you let me drive.    

1098
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:56,397
          Oh, hell no.          

1099
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:58,299
     Not the way you drive.     
          Deal's off.           

1100
01:08:58,301 --> 01:08:59,834
             Uh-uh.             

1101
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:01,903
     That ain't happening.      

1102
01:09:01,905 --> 01:09:04,405
   Maybe I need more courage.   

1103
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,510
       Well, hell, let's        
       drink to courage.        

1104
01:09:12,516 --> 01:09:14,816
     And to all the writers     
         in the world.          

1105
01:09:15,418 --> 01:09:19,821
           ( music )            
    You said you're leaving,   
            Today              

1106
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:26,828
   Dale: You know, in all the   
 years I known ya, I never seen 
     you looking like this.     

1107
01:09:27,197 --> 01:09:29,764
    Everything okay between,    
       uh, you and Helen?       

1108
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:32,867
            No shit.            

1109
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:35,336
       I thought you two        
    were gonna get married.     

1110
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,840
              Ahh.              

1111
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:41,676
   You got another one, huh?    

1112
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:45,413
    I do, and she's getting     
   married to somebody else.    

1113
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,215
         Is she pretty?         

1114
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:50,351
   Oh, Dale, she's gorgeous.    

1115
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:55,957
You know? She's... she's pretty,
       and she's clumsy.        

1116
01:09:56,593 --> 01:09:59,527
        Wow. Sounds like        
    you're really into her.     

1117
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,629
     She live around here?      

1118
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:03,431
              No.               

1119
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:04,766
         That's tough.          

1120
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:07,602
         Hold onto her.         

1121
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:09,403
  This one sounds like the one  
you don't want to let slip away.

1122
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:11,773
           Bye boys.

 I wasn't expecting you today.  

1131
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:10,265
    Rachel died last night.     

1132
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:13,434
     Darling, I'm so sorry.     

1133
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:20,675
      Why are you smiling?      

1134
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:23,878
      Do you think the son      
  will give you an exclusive?   

1135
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:29,651
    I'll send a photographer    
           with you.            

1136
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:32,453
    Mom, put the phone down!    
              Mom?              

1137
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:37,492
   This is a private funeral.   
           No press.

01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,627
         No television.         
            Nothing.            

1139
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:44,932
  I'm invited, and I'm going.   

1140
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:02,917
 I'll get a driver to take you. 

1141
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:06,621
 No. You don't get it, do you?  
     I don't want a camera!     

1142
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:08,790
  And I definitely don't want   
   one of your photographers    

1143
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:10,458
      posing as a driver!

        <i> gonna get there?</i>       

1145
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:14,996
          Don't worry.          

1146
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:16,931
       I'm Sasha Kapalov        

1147

          from Russia.          

1148
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:21,369
      I take care of you.       

1149
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:26,007
    This is homemade vodka.     

1150
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:27,642
           You relax.           

1151
01:12:27,644 --> 01:12:29,677
    You don't feel a thing.     

1152
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,046
         I don't drink.         

1153
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:34,415
           You don't?           

1154
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:36,851
    I can't hold my liquor.     

1155
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:38,920
       I hold it for you.       

1156

        Don't be silly.         

1157
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:42,824
     Everybody drinks, huh?     

1158
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:44,926
          No, thanks.           

1159
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:46,994
             Okay.

       Thanks for coming.       

1168

    I almost didn't make it.    

1169
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:27,802
Um, I tried to get here sooner. 
       I'm really sorry.        

1170
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:31,506
        Don't apologize.

 She's a friend of the family.  

1177

       Nice to meet you.        

1178
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,803
Well, it was great to meet you. 

1179
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:03,771
             Yeah.              

1180
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,640
           Likewise.            

1181
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:09,444
       If you don't mind,       
   I'm gonna spend some time    
     with Rachel by myself.

1184
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:49,917
         Yes! Aha! See?         
  You can't beat me, brother!

          Come on now!          

1187
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:53,621
  Don't make me nervous, baby!  

1188
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:55,156
         You know that          
    position makes me crazy.    

1189
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:57,058
        -You can do it!         
          -All right.           

1190
01:14:57,060 --> 01:14:58,559
       See what you got.        

1191
01:14:58,561 --> 01:14:59,694
            Shirin?             

1192
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:00,995
             Yeah?              

1193

     -Shirin? What is this?     

1194
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:08,202
         What is this?          
         What was that?         

1195
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:10,238
    Next time, I get Vicky.     

1196
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,573
      You get Shirin, huh?      

1197
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,143
              -Ya!              
            -Shirin?            

1198
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:17,645
          ( laughing )          

1199
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:18,212
             Whew!              

1200
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:19,547
            Shirin!             

1201
01:15:19,549 --> 01:15:21,782
           I'm sorry!           
     I'm sorry! I'm trying!     

1202
01:15:21,784 --> 01:15:24,785
       Game, set, match.

1204

           Let's go.            
         ( starts car )

         the stop sign.         

1206
01:15:34,764 --> 01:15:35,963
         No, it didn't.         

1207
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:37,615
          Yes, it did.          

1208
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,266
   No, it didn't. Not today.    
         Didn't happen.         

1209
01:15:39,269 --> 01:15:42,870
      Trust me. Trust me.       
       It didn't happen.        

1210
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:44,939
          -Well, what?          
      -You didn't see it.       

1211
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:48,276
           Hey, Dad.            

1212
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:52,613
Shirin, what are you doing here?

1213
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:55,550
       Uh, I just thought       
    I'd stop by and say hi.     

1214
01:15:55,852 --> 01:15:57,919
        You play tennis?        

1215
01:15:57,921 --> 01:15:59,754
        You hate tennis.        

1216
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:01,956
Yeah, I know, and it was really 
   hot out, and Vicky and Ed    

1217
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:03,925
 kept smashing the ball at me,  
       and I kept missing       

1218
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:05,760
'cause I'm really uncoordinated.
    You know that about me,     

1219
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:07,795
   and look, I'm just really    
trying to make everybody happy, 

1220
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:11,032
 but I can't. So, I don't know  
      what the...I just...      

1221
01:16:11,034 --> 01:16:14,669
      Please sit down and       
    tell me what's going on.    

1222
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,643
     Why did you marry mom?     

1223
01:16:22,879 --> 01:16:24,779
   What's the matter, Shirin?   

1224
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:28,950
   I just know you're unhappy   
 every time you're around her.  

1225
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:33,621
        I don't want to         
     make the same mistake.     

1226
01:16:33,623 --> 01:16:35,089
           So don't.            

1227
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:38,859
    The truth is that you do    
    not need a lot in life.     

1228
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:41,996
     Find the man you love.     

1229
01:16:42,365 --> 01:16:45,766
     But you never answered     
          my question.          

1230
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,368
     Why did you marry mom?     

1231
01:16:49,005 --> 01:16:50,871
           Back home,           

1232
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:58,112
      your mom was in love      
  with a rich Iranian surgeon.  

1233
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:02,016
  In fact, when he got engaged  
       with someone else,       

1234
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:04,919
 she wanted to get rearranged.  

1235
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:08,923
     So, what does she do?      

1236
01:17:10,093 --> 01:17:13,260
      She proposes to her       
       college professor.       

1237
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:15,096
              Me.               

1238
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:19,033
       Your mother was an       
       excellent student,       

1239
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:22,103
        beautiful, rich,        
        the whole thing.        

1240
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:25,940
 Of course, I couldn't believe  
  my luck, and I said, "yes."   

1241
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:31,345
 Before I knew it, you arrived. 

1242
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:35,149
           ( music )            

1243
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,418
 So I was part of the mistake.  

1244
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:40,755
        No, no, no, no.         

1245
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:48,429
       You were the most        
        wonderful thing         

1246
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:50,965
     that could ever happen     
          in my life.           

1247
01:17:56,039 --> 01:18:01,175
    The only thing that I'm     
    sure I have done right.     

1248
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:16,891
           ( music )

 I hate leaving voice messages. 

1255
01:18:48,458 --> 01:18:51,926
     Um, but I have so much     
     I want to say to you.      

1256
01:18:51,928 --> 01:18:56,764

         for my present         

1257
01:18:56,766 --> 01:18:58,833
  but mostly for trusting me.

 This is a brand new outfit...  

1262
01:19:12,315 --> 01:19:14,882
          Never mind.           
        We need to talk.        

1263

              Mom.              

1266
01:19:18,955 --> 01:19:20,454
 Darling, don't make that face. 

1267
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:22,790
            Tell me.            
        What's going on?        

1268
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:28,262
       Well, um, I think        
      you should know that      

1269
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,231
        I've decided not        
         to marry Mike.         

1270
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:35,169
 Do you have any idea how many  
women would give their right arm

1271
01:19:35,171 --> 01:19:37,171
       to marry Dr. June?       

1272
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:40,307
           I'm sorry.           
  I can't go through with it.   

1273
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:52,553
       Okay. What is it?        
         Another woman?         

1274
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:55,556
 So, he had a little adventure. 

1275
01:19:55,558 --> 01:19:58,159
            Come on.            
     He had a little fling.     

1276
01:19:58,161 --> 01:20:00,294
      Let's be a big girl.      

1277
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:04,565
     Actually, it's nothing     
           like that.           

1278
01:20:04,567 --> 01:20:06,534
      I'm just not in love      
           with him.            

1279
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,502
      -You don't love him?      
  -No, that's not what I said.  

1280
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:11,071
          I love him.           
   I'm not in love with him.    

1281
01:20:11,073 --> 01:20:13,507
  This isn't a romantic novel.  

1282
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:15,176
     It's a legal contract.     

1283
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:17,178
    You're getting married.     

1284
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,547
    How many couples do you     
 know that got married for love 

1285
01:20:19,549 --> 01:20:21,582
     and are now divorced?      

1286
01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:24,985
   I'm in love with William,    
      Rachel Harson's son.      

1287
01:20:25,822 --> 01:20:26,954
             What?              

1288
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:35,029
    That nut case who stares    
     at the stars and plays     
    with his radio all night    

1289
01:20:35,031 --> 01:20:37,431
  is in love with my daughter?  

1290
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:39,567
      Unfortunately, he's       
  involved with someone else.   

1291
01:20:39,569 --> 01:20:41,168
      So, I'm out of luck.      

1292
01:20:43,906 --> 01:20:45,506
  My daughter has gone cuckoo.  

1293
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:50,845
            Uh, hi.             
      Sorry to bother you.      

1294
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:52,346
  Uh, I'm here to see Shirin.   

1295
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,448
        ( phone beeps )         

1296
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,150
              Yes?              

1297
01:20:57,987 --> 01:20:59,553
              Who?              

1298
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:01,155
            Really?             

1299
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:02,623
           On my way.           

1300
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:07,528
   I have to go to a meeting.   

1301
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:11,498
     Not a word about this,     
promise me my dear, to anybody. 

1302
01:21:12,635 --> 01:21:16,003
          Fine. Fine.           
     I won't say anything.      

1303
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,607
  I'm Shirin's mother, Maryam.  

1304
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,042
 Hi, I'm...I'm William Harson.  

1305
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:25,312
     I, uh, didn't have an      
      appointment, but I'm      
      here to see Shirin.       

1306
01:21:25,314 --> 01:21:26,413
     It's kind of personal.     

1307
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:27,948
         I'm so sorry,          
        she's not here,         

1308
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:30,017
          but I would           
    love to speak with you.     

1309
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:31,552
  Would you join me for lunch?  

1310
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:33,654
           Uh, yeah.            

1311
01:21:38,327 --> 01:21:40,327
        Maryam: You have        
      to forget about her.      

1312
01:21:41,998 --> 01:21:43,464
            I can't.            

1313
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:47,368
       Ma'am, I'm in love       
      with your daughter.       

1314
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:49,503
    She is a married woman.     

1315
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,073
          She's what?           

1316
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:55,175
  She went through with this?   

1317
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:58,545
At the last minute, I agreed to 
drop the plans for a big wedding

1318
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:01,482
because she was in such a hurry.

1319
01:22:01,484 --> 01:22:03,984
      Can you believe it?       

1320
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:05,619
       She went to Vegas.       

1321
01:22:07,123 --> 01:22:09,356
        No, I...I can't.        

1322
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:11,225
 She got married in Las Vegas?  

1323
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:16,196
 On a bridge over a canal, one  
 of the most beautiful hotels.  

1324
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,632
        She got married         
       in a mall casino?        

1325
01:22:18,634 --> 01:22:21,268
        I thought it was        
         very romantic.         

1326
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,470
           In Vegas?            

1327
01:22:23,472 --> 01:22:25,105
            And fun.            

1328
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:27,308
            Really?             

1329
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:30,044
 Please, have some more kabob.  

1330
01:22:30,046 --> 01:22:32,313
   I'm sorry to be the bearer   
          of bad news,          

1331
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:34,448
       but a handsome man       
           like you,            

1332
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,952
   well surely you'll have no   
 trouble finding someone else.  

1333
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:39,653
             Yeah.              

1334
01:22:39,989 --> 01:22:42,056
   Shirin told me everything.   

1335
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,460
      What do you mean she      
      told you everything?      

1336
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,495
          Everything.           

1337
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:52,967
         So...you know?         

1338
01:22:52,969 --> 01:22:55,402
         I was shocked,         
         but you know,          

1339
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:59,540
     mothers and daughters,     
          no secrets.           

1340
01:23:00,343 --> 01:23:03,544
    If the public finds out     
    about this, I'm ruined.     

1341
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:05,346
    Do you understand that?     

1342
01:23:05,348 --> 01:23:07,448
  You have to understand that   
we didn't...we didn't plan this.

1343
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:09,367
           You know?            

1344
01:23:09,368 --> 01:23:11,285
 It just...it started off as a  
   joke and then we...we just   
  kind of went with it, and...  

1345
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:13,354
       You call something       
       like this a joke?        

1346
01:23:13,356 --> 01:23:15,322
         We never meant         
       to deceive anyone.       

1347
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,590
         I promise you.         

1348
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:18,192
      But you did deceive.      

1349
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:21,328
       I should've never        
        trusted Shirin.         

1350
01:23:23,232 --> 01:23:25,299
        You're not gonna        
     publish this, are you?     

1351
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:27,468
       I want to be fair.       

1352
01:23:29,472 --> 01:23:34,141
   Will you tell me your side   
          of the story          

1353
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:37,678
   and please have some more    
         <i> Ghormeh sabzi.</i>        

1354
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:50,657
       ( knock on door )        

1355
01:23:51,594 --> 01:23:53,627
              -Hi.              
             -Hey.              

1356
01:23:53,629 --> 01:23:56,163
  Forgot your keys again, huh?  

1357
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:58,532
      You look very wild.       
 Where did you get that dress?  

1358
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,204
        This is for you.        

1359
01:24:06,575 --> 01:24:08,442
  What are you talking about?   
   Come on. Let's go inside.    

1360
01:24:08,444 --> 01:24:13,347
      No. I can't do this.      
  I can't...I can't marry you.  

1361
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:17,317
       What do you mean,        
      you can't marry me?       

1362
01:24:18,654 --> 01:24:20,788
     It's another guy, huh?     

1363
01:24:21,524 --> 01:24:23,791
     It's that guy from the     
  lighthouse, that hippy kid?   

1364
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:28,529
     Shirin, how could you?     

1365
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:32,499
     Mike, you're the type      
     of guy who almost any      
   woman would love to have.    

1366
01:24:34,703 --> 01:24:38,072
      Right, but not you.       

1367
01:24:44,146 --> 01:24:46,146
           I'm sorry.           

1368
01:24:46,148 --> 01:24:47,281
         I have to go.          

1369
01:24:47,283 --> 01:24:48,849
            Uh-huh.             

1370
01:24:51,454 --> 01:24:53,320
           ( sighs )            

1371
01:24:54,457 --> 01:24:56,490
 Will: Give my friend a drink,  
            please.             

1372
01:24:56,826 --> 01:24:58,692
     Girl: You have a name?     

1373
01:24:58,694 --> 01:25:04,565
          Yeah. Yeah.           
 I can't remember it right now. 

1374
01:25:04,567 --> 01:25:06,400
 I never heard that one before. 
         That's funny.          

1375
01:25:06,402 --> 01:25:07,501
              Hmm.              

1376
01:25:07,503 --> 01:25:10,704
  It is funny, and it's true.   

1377
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:17,277
  Sometimes, I go by William,   
     and then other times,      

1378
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,547
        I go by Rachel.         

1379
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:22,816
 I'd prefer to call you Rachel. 

1380
01:25:22,818 --> 01:25:26,120
          ( meowing )           
          ( laughing )          

1381
01:25:27,656 --> 01:25:29,156
            Naughty.            

1382
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:30,624
            Um-hmm.             

1383
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:33,594
      Most people want to       
   call me Rachel these days.   

1384
01:25:33,596 --> 01:25:35,463
             Yeah?              

1385
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,331
    Why don't you come to my    
  place and tell me about it?   

1386
01:25:38,701 --> 01:25:40,567
      She isn't worth it.       

1387
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:48,542
    If you only knew, but I     
    tell you what I will do.    

1388
01:25:49,278 --> 01:25:52,246
     I will drive you home.     

1389
01:25:53,215 --> 01:25:54,481
         Sure you will.         

1390
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:57,518
   You dumped Mike for this?    

1391
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:02,756
         Naughty night?         
         What the hell?         

1392
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,660
    There must be some kind     
          of mistake.           

1393
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:08,795
  Only in your choice of men.   

1394
01:26:08,797 --> 01:26:10,864
           Revolting.           

1395
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:16,937
      This isn't like him.      

1396
01:26:17,473 --> 01:26:20,707
          Which part?           
    Picking up sleazy bimbos    

1397
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:23,644
       or driving through       
      storefront windows?       

1398
01:26:24,313 --> 01:26:27,748
    ( television playing  )     

1399
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:45,432
    Bev, I'll call you back.    

1400
01:26:45,634 --> 01:26:47,501
       You are a monster!       

1401
01:26:47,503 --> 01:26:49,403
          -Sweetheart.          
      -Don't call me that!      

1402
01:26:49,405 --> 01:26:52,339
  I'm resigning, and I demand   
you publish a letter of apology!

1403
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:54,374
      I was just about to       
      say congratulations.      

1404
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:56,777
     You're not even giving     
          me a chance!          

1405
01:26:57,413 --> 01:26:59,513
     How could you do this      
     to your own daughter?      

1406
01:26:59,515 --> 01:27:00,847
      Calm down, darling.       

1407
01:27:00,849 --> 01:27:02,683
  I thought you'd be thrilled.  

1408
01:27:02,685 --> 01:27:03,984
           Thrilled?            

1409
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:05,252
            Please.             

1410
01:27:05,254 --> 01:27:06,920
        Let's not be too        
        theatrical here.        

1411
01:27:06,922 --> 01:27:09,256
  After all, this is BH Style.  

1412
01:27:09,258 --> 01:27:11,525
         We do our best         
       to get the truth.        

1413
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:13,961
      We're not just about      
      fashion and gossip.       

1414
01:27:13,963 --> 01:27:15,429
            No, no.             

1415
01:27:15,431 --> 01:27:17,564
 We're about selling magazines. 

1416
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,817
           Whatever.            

1417
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,935
      The fact is, I made       
     him confess his sins,      

1418
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:24,871
     and I was kind enough      
    to give you the credit.     

1419
01:27:24,873 --> 01:27:28,742
  You spent days at their home  
  and came back empty-handed.   

1420
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:31,311
     He told me everything      
         in 20 minutes.         

1421
01:27:33,249 --> 01:27:34,615
  What are you talking about?   

1422
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:38,919
   He came by, asked to have    
 lunch and told me everything.  

1423
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:41,588
      I don't believe you.      

1424
01:27:41,857 --> 01:27:43,590
 He wanted this to be a secret. 

1425
01:27:52,534 --> 01:27:54,835
<i>I never meant to deceive anyone.</i>

1426
01:27:54,837 --> 01:27:59,273
   <i> After I published my first</i>  
    <i> novel in New York which</i>    
      <i> was a huge disaster,</i>     

1427
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:02,609
    <i> I went home and I wrote</i>    
      Before The Morning.       

1428
01:28:02,878 --> 01:28:04,544
       <i> My mother, Rachel,</i>      
         <i> she loved it,</i>         

1429
01:28:04,546 --> 01:28:06,580
      <i> and she wanted me to</i>     
     <i> send it to publishers,</i>    

1430
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:08,615
   <i> but I only agreed to do it</i>  
   <i> if she put her name on it.</i>  

1431
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,851
          <i> So, we did.</i>          

1432
01:28:10,853 --> 01:28:12,953
       <i> So, my mom's book</i>       
       <i> became a huge hit.</i>      

1433
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:14,621
      <i> I couldn't go back,</i>      

1434
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:17,691
    <i> and then I became Rachel</i>   
      <i> Harson, the author.</i>      

1435
01:28:20,062 --> 01:28:22,696
    I told you he was crazy,    

1436
01:28:22,698 --> 01:28:27,501
       mentally unstable,       
       self-destructive.        

1437
01:28:27,503 --> 01:28:29,770
      Lots of writers are.      

1438
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:31,705
            So sad.             

1439
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:41,048
      Uh, hello, William?       

1440
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,817
 I don't know what's going on?  

1441
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,519
  I've called you five times.   

1442
01:28:45,521 --> 01:28:47,387
      Please call me back.      

1443
01:28:47,389 --> 01:28:49,389
 There's so much I want to say. 

1444
01:28:49,391 --> 01:28:52,559
    I...I read the article.     

1445
01:28:53,062 --> 01:28:55,362
     I...I'm so sorry if I      
      hurt you in any way.      

1446
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:57,998
  I...I don't know why you're   
  not responding to my calls.   

1447
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,701
    Can you please call me?     

1448
01:29:01,637 --> 01:29:03,737
          I miss you.           

1449
01:29:04,073 --> 01:29:06,073
      ( knocking on door )      

1450
01:29:11,347 --> 01:29:11,978
           Who is it?           

1451
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:14,448
      ( knocking on door )      

1452
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:21,555
              -Hi.              
              -Hi.              

1453
01:29:24,026 --> 01:29:25,692
         Can I come in          
        just one minute?        

1454
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,728
          -Yeah, yeah.          
            -Thanks.            

1455
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:32,966
     What happened to you?      

1456
01:29:32,968 --> 01:29:34,434
       I thought it would       
      be more your style.       

1457
01:29:34,436 --> 01:29:36,903
    I thought you'd like it.    
        You know, hippy.        

1458
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,539
       It's interesting.        

1459
01:29:40,576 --> 01:29:45,078
      Shirin, ever since I      
    met you, I fell in love.    

1460
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,714
        I can't look at         
        any other woman.        

1461
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,883
     Please, take me back.      

1462
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:52,519
   I'll do whatever it takes.   

1463
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:54,821
       No more boob jobs.       
        Just nose jobs.         

1464
01:29:57,459 --> 01:29:58,492
              I...              

1465
01:29:58,494 --> 01:30:01,461
   Shirin, let's get married.   

1466
01:30:03,599 --> 01:30:04,831
       Mike, I...I can't.       

1467
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,767
       Wait, wait, wait.        

1468
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:07,968
            Hold on.            

1469
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:09,736
     Let me show you this.      
         Look at this.          

1470
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,471
   -Mike, what are you doing?   
     -You're gonna like it.     

1471
01:30:11,473 --> 01:30:13,640
             -Mike?             
   -No, you're gonna like it.   

1472
01:30:13,642 --> 01:30:16,877
     You're gonna like it.      
         Hold on. Huh?          

1473
01:30:16,879 --> 01:30:19,880
          ( laughing )          

1474
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:22,816
            Come on!            

1475
01:30:22,818 --> 01:30:24,151
          Smiley face.          

1476
01:30:24,153 --> 01:30:25,786
   You can't say no to that.    

1477
01:30:25,788 --> 01:30:27,754
         You're crazy.          

1478
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:30,891
    Put your pants back on.     

1479
01:30:33,829 --> 01:30:36,730
    It was Ben's idea, but I    
    mean, it worked, right?     

1480
01:30:36,732 --> 01:30:38,532
         It is working.         

1481
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,100
       Oh. I missed you.        

1482
01:30:40,102 --> 01:30:43,103
      ( Foreign language )      

1483
01:30:46,842 --> 01:30:48,542
        Congratulations.        

1484
01:30:51,814 --> 01:30:54,548
   Excuse me, officer, uh...    
          any problem?          

1485
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:56,149
          Oh, no sir.           
            No sir.             

1486
01:30:56,151 --> 01:30:59,519
 I'm a friend of Shirin, and I  
just, I couldn't get off today, 

1487
01:30:59,521 --> 01:31:00,821
      and I just wanted to      
     stop by and say hello.     

1488
01:31:00,823 --> 01:31:02,522
         Oh, of course.         

1489
01:31:02,524 --> 01:31:03,957
        You're welcome.         

1490
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,627
    Shrin told me about you.    
  The promising writer, right?  

1491
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:11,465
  Oh. I'm working on it, sir.   
    I'm still working on it.    

1492
01:31:11,467 --> 01:31:13,200
       Please, please go        
      have some champagne.      

1493
01:31:13,202 --> 01:31:16,770
  Thank you, but I'm still on   
 duty, and I really shouldn't.  

1494
01:31:16,772 --> 01:31:18,505
            Come on.            
      It's only champagne.      

1495
01:31:18,507 --> 01:31:22,642
   Besides, how often does my   
   daughter get married, huh?   

1496
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:23,977
          ( laughing )          

1497
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:25,512
       ( speaking Farsi )       

1498
01:31:25,514 --> 01:31:27,013
      I am speaking Farsi.      

1499
01:31:27,015 --> 01:31:28,248
       ( speaking Farsi )       

1500
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:30,250
  Whoa, you speak Farsi, too.   

1501
01:31:30,252 --> 01:31:32,252
          ( laughing )          

1502
01:31:34,556 --> 01:31:39,159
           ( music )            

1503
01:32:03,752 --> 01:32:05,785
        You look great.         

1504
01:32:09,091 --> 01:32:11,291
    Will: Please, just sell     
    the house at any price.     

1505
01:32:11,293 --> 01:32:15,195
      I really feel sorry       
      about what happened.      

1506
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:16,997
           Thank you.           

1507
01:32:16,999 --> 01:32:18,665
         I know people          
      are angry with you,       

1508
01:32:18,667 --> 01:32:21,001
     but it doesn't really      
      make any difference,      

1509
01:32:21,003 --> 01:32:24,271
  and your novels have brought  
     me so much happiness.      

1510
01:32:24,273 --> 01:32:26,273
        It means a lot.         

1511
01:32:26,808 --> 01:32:28,608
     I hope you write more.     

1512
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:32,579
I mean, I don't know if you know
  how much they mean to people  

1513
01:32:32,581 --> 01:32:35,549
    who still haven't found     
     that special someone.      

1514
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:39,619
           It's okay.           

1515
01:32:40,656 --> 01:32:44,758
        I can't help it,        
      but I have to quote       

1516
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:51,731
      a poem from the very      
  famous Persian poet, Hafez.   

1517
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:57,571
          Who said...           
      ( foreign language)       

1518
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:04,744
     Don't worry. He always     
      gives big speeches,       

1519
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:07,347
    plus I'm still expecting    
     more important people.     

1520
01:33:09,718 --> 01:33:11,017
      ( foreign language )      

1521
01:33:16,858 --> 01:33:18,224
    Aren't you proud of me?     

1522
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:21,328
             Sure.              

1523
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:23,263
     Any particular reason?     

1524
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:26,633
   Silly girl almost left the   
 doctor for that crazy writer.  

1525
01:33:27,803 --> 01:33:29,636
          I saved her.          

1526
01:33:38,313 --> 01:33:41,247
  Maryam, what have you done?   

1527
01:33:41,249 --> 01:33:43,300
       What do you mean?        

1528
01:33:43,301 --> 01:33:45,352
     You heard me. What did     
  you do to save the marriage?  

1529
01:33:45,354 --> 01:33:47,687
            Nothing.            
     He came to see Shirin.     

1530
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:50,323
      I took him to lunch       
       and made him talk.       

1531
01:33:50,325 --> 01:33:52,826
   Trust me, it wasn't easy.    

1532
01:33:54,096 --> 01:33:56,162
        What did you do?        

1533
01:33:57,032 --> 01:33:59,065
        Hi, how are you?        

1534
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:07,941
 You didn't really think Shirin 
could write that story, did you?

1535
01:34:08,343 --> 01:34:11,745
   All's well that ends well.   
         Right darling?         

1536
01:34:16,218 --> 01:34:19,352
     Let me translate this      
   poem for American friends.   

1537
01:34:19,354 --> 01:34:22,055
 That means I have never heard  

1538
01:34:22,057 --> 01:34:28,328
  a better and more beautiful   
 sound than the sound of love.  

1539
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:31,798
        Excuse me, sir.         
    Is everything all right?    

1540
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:37,070
      As a matter of fact,      
         sir, it isn't.         

1541
01:34:37,072 --> 01:34:38,972
        We need to talk.        

1542
01:34:38,974 --> 01:34:40,440
             Okay.              

1543
01:34:47,049 --> 01:34:49,082
      There's not gonna be      
          another one.          

1544
01:34:50,318 --> 01:34:53,753
     <i> Man on phone: What are</i>    
       <i> you gonna do now?</i>       

1545
01:34:54,322 --> 01:34:56,222
  I think I'm gonna disappear.  

1546
01:34:58,827 --> 01:35:03,763
       Mike, do you take        
           this woman           

1547
01:35:05,967 --> 01:35:08,268
        as your lawfully        
          wedded wife?          

1548
01:35:10,138 --> 01:35:11,237
             I do.              

1549
01:35:14,142 --> 01:35:20,313
        Shirin, Shirin,         
      do you take this man      

1550
01:35:21,783 --> 01:35:25,018
        as your lawfully        
    wedded husband for life?    

1551
01:35:32,494 --> 01:35:38,965
    Shirin, would you commit    
  yourself to this man, Mike,   

1552
01:35:38,967 --> 01:35:41,801
   and remain faithful to him   
   for the rest of your life?   

1553
01:35:45,173 --> 01:35:51,878
    Shirin, would you commit    
      yourself to this man      

1554
01:35:52,948 --> 01:35:57,016
    and stay faithful to him    
   for the rest of your life?   

1555
01:36:02,457 --> 01:36:04,390
       Excuse me, please.       
       Excuse me, please.       

1556
01:36:04,392 --> 01:36:05,859
          Stand back.           
           Excuse me.           

1557
01:36:05,861 --> 01:36:07,193
       Excuse me, please!       
           Excuse me!           

1558
01:36:07,195 --> 01:36:08,895
          -Excuse me!           
 -What's the hell is going on?  

1559
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:10,230
        Excuse me, sir.         
           Excuse me!           

1560
01:36:10,232 --> 01:36:13,399
 Uh, you, you're under arrest.  

1561
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:15,301
  -What are you talking about?  
      -She's under arrest!      

1562
01:36:15,303 --> 01:36:16,836
           -For what?           
      -You can't do this!       

1563
01:36:16,838 --> 01:36:18,505
         I can do this!         
     I'm a police officer!      

1564
01:36:18,507 --> 01:36:20,206
You can't come here and do that!

1565
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:23,309
She has 300 outstanding tickets,
 and she's under arrest! Ma'am. 

1566
01:36:23,311 --> 01:36:24,978
     You can't do that now.     
       This is a wedding!       

1567
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,479
        No, no, no! Sir!        

1568
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:29,783
     Stop it! Ma'am, you're     
  under arrest. Come with me.   

1569
01:36:29,785 --> 01:36:30,984
      Mike, do something!       

1570
01:36:30,986 --> 01:36:32,485
  Ma'am, come with me, please!  

1571
01:36:32,487 --> 01:36:33,920
       That's not right!        

1572
01:36:34,790 --> 01:36:36,489
      Uh, I have a lawyer!      

1573
01:36:36,491 --> 01:36:38,224
     Jose, I got a lawyer.      
             Jose!              

1574
01:36:38,226 --> 01:36:40,126
           Step back!           
  Would you please step back!   

1575
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:41,394
       Step back, please!       

1576
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:43,930
       Please step back!        

1577
01:36:43,932 --> 01:36:45,865
     Mike: Call the police!     
   Call the police! Dial 911.   

1578
01:36:45,867 --> 01:36:46,900
      Where are you going?      

1579
01:36:46,902 --> 01:36:48,802
         You can't her!         
        This is a party!        

1580
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:51,137
        Call the police!        

1581
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:54,808
     ( indiscreet chatter )     

1582
01:36:55,177 --> 01:36:57,343
            Stop it!            

1583
01:36:59,281 --> 01:37:01,447
   Would you mind telling me    
   what the hell is going on?   

1584
01:37:01,449 --> 01:37:04,083
Well, first of all, I'm probably
  gonna lose my job over this,  

1585
01:37:04,085 --> 01:37:06,452
but a writer has to be fearless,
     you know what I mean?      

1586
01:37:06,454 --> 01:37:08,087
That's what you said, isn't it? 

1587
01:37:08,089 --> 01:37:11,891
     I'm pretty sure I was      
 talking about writing, Marvin. 

1588
01:37:11,893 --> 01:37:15,094
     Well, your dad told me     
    exactly what's happened.    

1589
01:37:15,096 --> 01:37:17,096
      Do you know William       
       came to visit you,       

1590
01:37:17,098 --> 01:37:20,967
but your mother persuaded him to
 go to lunch with her instead?  

1591
01:37:20,969 --> 01:37:23,336
        She told William        
     that you betrayed him.     

1592
01:37:23,471 --> 01:37:25,438
    -This is discrimination!    
        -Discrimination!        

1593
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,906
      It's discrimination!      

1594
01:37:26,908 --> 01:37:30,443
Now, it seems like he loves you.

1595
01:37:30,445 --> 01:37:32,345
        Do you love him?        

1596
01:37:35,383 --> 01:37:37,884
    It's up to you, Shirin.     

1597
01:37:38,353 --> 01:37:40,119
             Uh...              

1598
01:37:41,923 --> 01:37:43,056
     Mom: I'm warning you!      

1599
01:37:43,058 --> 01:37:45,291
  My lawyers will destroy you!  

1600
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:51,130
     For once in your life,     
        mother, shut up!        

1601
01:37:51,132 --> 01:37:53,233
         ( crowd oh's )         

1602
01:37:54,169 --> 01:37:56,135
            Well...             

1603
01:37:56,137 --> 01:37:58,238
      Nader, do something!      

1604
01:37:58,607 --> 01:37:59,973
    What are we waiting for?    

1605
01:37:59,975 --> 01:38:01,441
          Let's do it!

1607
01:38:58,934 --> 01:39:00,967
  I didn't write that article.  

1608
01:39:01,536 --> 01:39:03,469
   I had to tell you myself.    

1609
01:39:03,471 --> 01:39:05,271
    My mom tricked us both.     

1610
01:39:07,309 --> 01:39:12,612
      You didn't come all       
      the way up here just      
    to tell me that, did ya?    

1611
01:39:17,018 --> 01:39:18,618
       God, look at you.        

1612
01:39:21,156 --> 01:39:23,156
        You never looked        
        more beautiful.         

1613
01:39:33,034 --> 01:39:35,969
       I'm gonna say what       
 you're supposed to say to me.  

1614
01:39:36,404 --> 01:39:38,304
          I love you.           

1615
01:39:39,107 --> 01:39:41,007
       Will you marry me?

              Yes.              

1618
01:40:14,676 --> 01:40:19,545
  Shirin, do you take this man  
 as your lawful wedded husband? 

1619
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:23,049
             I do.              

1620
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:25,751
      As of this moment, I      
pronounce you husband and wife.
