00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,150
I don't have anything
stuck in my teeth, do I?

3
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,220
Let me see. Nope, all clear.

4
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,356
Honey, you look so handsome.

5
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,317
She's going to have a great
time with you tonight.

6
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:26,892
You'll see.

7
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,333
Oh, and I want a
picture of you two.

8
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:30,162
- Mom, no.
- Oh, come on, please.

9
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,163
Just one.

10
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,699
Okay, uh, but you promised

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,401
you'd let me walk to
the door by myself.

12
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,436
I know, I know. I'll be
right here in the car.

13
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,372
- Okay.
- Waiting. Okay.

14
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,807
Hi, Annie.

15
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,776
Harold, you're so dressed up.

16
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,813
Are you trying to
make me look bad?

17
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,815
That was a joke.

18
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:25,551
This is for you.

19
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,855
Thanks. It's beautiful.

20
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,790
So are you ready to go?

21
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,927
Yeah, I told everybody to meet
us out in front of the gym.

22
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,096
Uh, everybody?

23
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:40,866
I invited a bunch of
friends to come with us.

24
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,335
I thought it'd be fun if
we went as a big group.

25
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,437
Don't you think?

26
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,206
Yeah.

27
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,447
Okay, you two. Move in together.

28
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:50,506
Move in.

29
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:56,849
Smile, Harold.

30
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,155
So the software we
set you up with

31
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,790
will issue all of your invoices.

32
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,191
It keeps everything organized,

33
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,193
so when tax time
comes, it's a snap.

34
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,163
Saves time for me
and money for you.

35
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:14,199
Um, where do I enter
that information?

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,634
Right, Claire has volunteered

37
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,135
to be my billing department.

38
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:19,204
Well, I can walk you
through it if you want.

39
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,672
You just have to
remember to enter

40
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:21,940
all your setup expenses

41
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,509
because they're all deductible.

42
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,544
Will do. Thank you.

43
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,279
Sure.

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,914
These are beautiful.

45
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,516
Are they all the
same photographer?

46
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,751
Uh, yes. They are.

47
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,419
Actually, it's me.

48
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,022
Really?

49
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,783
Well, listen. We really
appreciate your help.

50
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:40,158
- Thank you, Harold.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,293
Yes.

52
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,895
Uh, Steve and I were thinking,

53
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,096
we're having a party next
Saturday for Megan's birthday.

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,066
I'm a big girl. I'm turning six.

55
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,268
Oh, wow.

56
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,969
And we're just having
some friends over,

57
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,539
but we'd love you to join
us if you're not busy.

58
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,173
Yeah, thanks. I'll drop by.

59
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,442
Great. Great.

60
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,177
Um, my sister Annie is in town,

61
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,713
you two were in the same
high-school class together,

62
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,748
weren't you?

63
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,552
Yeah. Yeah, I remember Annie.

64
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,754
Um, how is she doing?

65
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,156
You can find out for yourself.

66
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:12,724
Uh, Saturday. 2:00.

67
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,596
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks again.

68
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes, yes.

69
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,368
I'll talk to him
about it right now.

70
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,370
And then I'll put
her name and number

71
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,173
right in front our boy,
and I'll watch him score.

72
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,374
Bye, hon.

73
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,243
- Who's going to score?
- You are.

74
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,811
So when's our next
round of golf?

75
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,713
Do you really think we
should keep playing?

76
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,448
We have to be the
worst golfers ever.

77
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,117
We quit by the sixth
hole or lunchtime,

78
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,285
whichever comes first.

79
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,488
We should come up with
a new sport like...

80
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,357
Miniature golf or bowling.

81
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,491
Ooh, bowling. I like bowling.

82
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:53,066
Guess who just walked in?

83
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,503
And she saw me.

84
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,405
You should go talk to her.

85
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,608
This isn't the first time
that she smiled at you.

86
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,610
- She likes you.
- I don't think so.

87
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,612
See, there you go, hiding
under a rock again.

88
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,113
Look, you know as well as I do,

89
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,749
every time I ask a woman
out, it ends in disaster.

90
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,351
Thank you.

91
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,453
Why do you think that is?

92
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,355
I don't know.

93
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,257
But it's always the same
whether I'm set up by friends,

94
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:22,361
or internet dating, or
matchmaking services.

95
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,395
Nothing works.

96
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,963
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

97
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,698
Maybe it's not the
meeting-people part

98
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,933
that you have a problem with.

99
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,735
Let's be honest.

100
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,004
Socializing is not
your strong point.

101
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:35,807
Yeah, the whole thing
is just so frustrating.

102
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,944
Have you ever heard
of a dating coach?

103
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,479
A what?

104
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,580
A dating coach.

105
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,615
Denise and I saw it on
TV the other night.

106
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,618
They're kind of like a
private teacher you hire

107
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,719
to teach you how to date.

108
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,521
Dating coach.

109
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,490
Is there really such a thing?

110
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,624
Yeah.

111
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,993
And I found someone
in the city for you.

112
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,862
She's got a bunch of clients,

113
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,064
and a lot of people
are trying it.

114
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,932
Willy, come on.

115
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,936
I mean, this is
just embarrassing.

116
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,141
I couldn't do it. It's...
it's too weird.

117
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:22,387
So I've never been to a
dating coach before.

118
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,956
My friend Willy, the
guy who called,

119
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,225
thought you might be
able to help me out.

120
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,560
Well, that's why I'm here.

121
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,595
To help people stop
making mistakes

122
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:34,566
in the modern dating world and
attract their perfect mate.

123
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,701
Oh, great.

124
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,737
Um, how do we get started?

125
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,841
Well, what we need to
do is schedule you

126
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,478
for a series of intensive
one-on-one sessions.

127
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,548
During this time, I
am going to mold you.

128
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,118
I'm going to teach you
the skills you will use

129
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:57,389
to attract and hold onto
that special someone.

130
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,525
Wow. How many
sessions do we have?

131
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,295
Well, we have a number of
packages to choose from.

132
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,665
I recommend you go with
our Diamond package.

133
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,635
It's the longest and
most intensive.

134
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,804
Wow, it's expensive.

135
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,639
Cost should be no
obstacle when it comes

136
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,641
to your future
happiness, Harold.

137
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,143
And don't worry,

138
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,680
we have payment plans and
accept all major credit cards.

139
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:26,718
And just a little paperwork
for you to sign.

140
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,088
I think, um, I just...

141
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:35,294
I should take some time
to think this over.

142
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,449
You made it.

143
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,184
Hey, here you go.
Thanks for having me.

144
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,620
Oh, this is so sweet.

145
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:05,191
Come on in. Everyone's
through here.

146
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,960
Smile, Harold.

147
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,301
Annie, look who's here.

148
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,537
Harold, you remember Annie?

149
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,473
Sure. Hi.

150
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,143
Hi. Hi.

151
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,179
It's so great to see you again

152
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,613
after all these years.

153
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,215
Yeah.

154
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,383
Harold...

155
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,384
- White.
- White.

156
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,785
Of course.

157
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,821
How have you been?

158
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,990
Fine, thanks. How have you been?

159
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,325
Ah. Ah, you know.

160
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,928
Living the high life,
hanging in there.

161
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,362
All that good stuff.

162
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:47,633
Yeah.

163
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,503
So can I get you a
drink or something?

164
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:55,006
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Okay.

165
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,611
And then after college,

166
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,581
I move the whopping-hours
drive away to the city.

167
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,182
I've always loved the city.

168
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,518
And then I started
my own business.

169
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,853
I'm an event planner,

170
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,187
like, I put parties together.

171
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,890
You know, decorating
everything and organizing.

172
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,593
- Did you do all of this?
- Yeah, I did.

173
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,295
It's amazing what you can do
with some scraps of fabric

174
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,831
and, you know, a hot glue
gun and some colored paper.

175
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,467
Wow. You're really talented.

176
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,802
Thank you.

177
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:28,039
Although it's been a
really tough line of work

178
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,107
to break into.

179
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,243
Anyway, enough about me.
What about you?

180
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,279
Claire said you're helping
Steve set up his body shop?

181
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,981
Uh, yeah.

182
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,515
I'm sorry. And what
is it you do again?

183
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:41,519
I run my own accounting firm
and do some consulting.

184
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,855
- Small business, mostly.
- Yeah.

185
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,223
I'm also a photographer,

186
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,984
but that's really just
on the side, you know.

187
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:49,676
No, that's great. Good for you.

188
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,064
You know, on the
way over here...

189
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,334
I was thinking about
that dance we went to.

190
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,770
What... what dance is this?

191
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:03,241
In freshmen year of high
school, homecoming.

192
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,311
I couldn't drive, so
my mother took us.

193
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,380
Do you remember?

194
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,749
She took that picture
of us together.

195
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,351
Of course.

196
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,954
Yeah. Oh, right.

197
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,357
We had such a good time.
Didn't we?

198
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,926
Yeah.

199
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,129
Yeah.

200
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:29,801
Good night, birthday girl.

201
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,706
Sweet dreams.

202
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,086
She went out like a light.

203
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,855
Thank you for everything.

204
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,325
The party looked fantastic.

205
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,927
Everybody said so.

206
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,164
So I talked to your friend
Harold like you asked me to.

207
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,965
I was just worried he'd
be left alone all day.

208
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:02,367
He's a nice guy, right?

209
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,403
Eh, kind of blah, but
yeah, he's nice.

210
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,439
You promise you aren't
trying to set me up, right?

211
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,840
No.

212
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:13,244
Besides, you're going out
with that Brad or Brian...

213
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,312
Brady.

214
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,982
And no, that was
like, five guys ago.

215
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:18,616
So who are you dating this week?

216
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,185
Uh, well, no one yet,

217
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,254
but hey, at least I've worked my
ways through the "B" s, right?

218
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:25,857
- Mm.
- No, I'm actually...

219
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:31,062
I just got a lot on
my plate right now.

220
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,098
Speaking of which,

221
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:37,002
I kind of need to
ask you a favor.

222
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,871
Remember how I said I'd be ready
to move out of here next week?

223
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,239
Yeah.

224
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,343
Well, turns out, um,
trying to find a job

225
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,179
and a place to live in the
city, it's been really tough.

226
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,082
Everything is so expensive.

227
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,318
And I'm wondering how you'd feel

228
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,721
if I could just stay for
a little bit longer.

229
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:57,722
Please.

230
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,392
Oh, Annie,

231
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,826
you've been here
for four months.

232
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,894
Yeah.

233
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,696
Time flies when
you're having fun?

234
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,831
What happened to getting a job?

235
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,366
I've been looking all over.

236
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,069
There's no openings for
event planners anywhere.

237
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,350
Why don't you do something else?

238
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:14,271
You know, just for a little
while, pay the bills.

239
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:18,176
Oh, uh, yeah. Sure, um,

240
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,845
I'll just... I'll get a day job.

241
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,747
Okay.

242
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,682
And in the meantime, I
can baby-sit Megan,

243
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,652
and I-I can do your decorating,

244
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,621
and I'll even do your windows.

245
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,190
You know, you need a backup plan

246
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,726
for this career of yours.

247
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:39,965
Annie, you're not a kid anymore.

248
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,180
Well, hello, stranger.

249
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,714
It's been a while, huh?

250
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,416
Let me guess, table
for one, right?

251
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,417
Please.

252
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,152
Follow me.

253
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,587
Here, sire.

254
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,090
And okay, so the specials today

255
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,292
are meatloaf and roast chicken.

256
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,927
If I were you,

257
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,596
I'd go with the roast chicken.

258
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,730
Thank you.

259
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,732
Someone will be right with you.

260
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,570
Here's your menu right here.

261
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,307
You gotta be kidding me.

262
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:23,708
Hi.

263
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,143
You work here?

264
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,645
Yeah. Sure do.

265
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,081
Just started here today.

266
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,717
And I gotta say, so
far, not so good.

267
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:37,021
My car broke down this morning
on my first day of work,

268
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,056
wouldn't you know?

269
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,357
Thank you.

270
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,193
That's... that's tough.
Sorry to hear that.

271
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,328
Thank you.

272
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,863
And now my shift
ends in an hour,

273
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,765
and I have no way
of getting home.

274
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,000
Do you believe this?

275
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,170
This is my crazy life.
Hi, welcome.

276
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,306
There's no one who
can pick you up?

277
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,707
No, you know, Steve's
working late,

278
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:58,977
and Claire's with
Megan somewhere,

279
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:00,011
but it's fine.

280
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,379
You know, something
will work out.

281
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,748
It's... it literally
cannot get any worse.

282
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,229
You know, I am not
going to say that.

283
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:06,784
That's bad karma.

284
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,119
I'm just going to
take that back.

285
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,121
Uh...

286
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,523
What can I get you to drink?

287
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,391
- Uh, coffee, please.
- Coming right up.

288
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,059
You know, if...

289
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,227
You really need a ride home,

290
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,296
I can take you.

291
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,764
Thank you.

292
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,734
Harold, that's very...
That's very sweet of you.

293
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,503
But I just... I couldn't
ask you to do that.

294
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,405
Right.

295
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,776
Could I?

296
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,222
Thank you.

297
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,392
Someone's girlfriend
trained them well.

298
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,727
I don't have a girlfriend.

299
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,896
Not really good at that.

300
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,598
Come on, you can't be that bad.

301
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,734
I'm so bad, my best
friend had to get me

302
00:13:56,735 --> 00:14:00,438
to see a... Specialist.

303
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,841
Specialist for...

304
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,944
A dating coach.

305
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,546
Really?

306
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,583
A dating coach? How did that go?

307
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,751
Uh, it was a disaster.

308
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,421
She was more interested
in making a sale.

309
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,624
Kind of made me feel
like a lost cause.

310
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,861
Nobody's a lost cause, Harold.

311
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,899
I should get going.

312
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,468
Okay.

313
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,137
Well, thanks again for the ride.

314
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,206
Sure.

315
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,908
I'll see you later, okay?

316
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:39,211
Okay.

317
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,583
How'd you get home?

318
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,885
Harold dropped me off.

319
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,021
Poor guy.

320
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,257
And I thought I had problems.

321
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,291
Ugh.

322
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,761
What a day.

323
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,796
If I were into bubble baths,

324
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,765
this would be the
time to take one.

325
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:03,134
Do you have a minute?

326
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,869
Okay, look, I know I
need to pay Steven back

327
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,137
for fixing and towing my car,

328
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,438
and I will have the money to him

329
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,440
right after I get
my next paycheck.

330
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,009
And the one after that...

331
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,644
And the one after that.

332
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,345
Why don't you sit down?

333
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,481
Aw.

334
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:20,151
- Is this about my dirty room?
- No.

335
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,819
- My dishes in the sink?
- No.

336
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,260
Borrowing your dress
without asking?

337
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:24,656
No.

338
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,492
That's all I know about.
What have you got on me?

339
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:31,929
Annie, your staying here...

340
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,299
I don't think it's a
good idea anymore.

341
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,600
What?

342
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,835
I've been giving this
a lot of thought,

343
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:41,239
and frankly, I feel like I'm
helping you escape reality.

344
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,174
Of course not.

345
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,609
I escape reality all on my own.

346
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,610
Pew.

347
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,279
Sorry.

348
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,447
Claire. Look, I'm sorry.

349
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,916
I know I'm a pain,
but I promise you,

350
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:53,251
this is not going to be forever.

351
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,687
I just need to buy myself
a little bit of time.

352
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,622
Sometimes things don't work out

353
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,390
the way we want them to.

354
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,926
It's not always about
getting a free ride.

355
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,928
What's that supposed to mean?

356
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,898
At some point, we all
have to grow up.

357
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,135
You need to move out and
get your own place.

358
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,406
Even your own family
won't bail you out?

359
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,742
So much for "blood is
thicker than water," right?

00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,438
It's not what anyone else sees.

540
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:36,340
Trust me.

541
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,976
How do we do that?

542
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,246
By bringing out the best in you.

543
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,748
Of course, that means
our first lesson

544
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,789
is going to take a few more
sessions than I thought.

545
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:48,285
Mm-hmm.

546
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:49,887
And uh,

547
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,957
how much more is that
going to cost me?

548
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,363
You know what,
it's on the house.

549
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:03,534
Yeah, let's just call it
some free, extra credit.

550
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,203
I am committed to this cause,

551
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,939
and we are in this together.

552
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,574
Yeah?

553
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,177

You've got ten more.

557
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,831
What's one thing you like
about the way you look?

558

Go.

559
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,113
I don't know.

560
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,881
Think. Come on, think.

561
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,250
Your smile... You've
got a great smile.

562
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,651
All those years of
braces paid off.

563
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:56,353
Say it. "I've got
a great smile."

564
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,354

You didn't think it'd
be easy, did you?

570
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:19,310
Maybe not easy, but
not this hard.

571
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,179
I know. I mean,
he's cute, right?

572
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,647
He has potential.

573
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,282
I hope so.

574
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,917
Well, you know, I like him.

575
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:31,589
He's a good tipper, and his
hair smells like detergent.

576
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,844
- Okay, careful.
- Whoa.

577
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,379
- Aah...
- Whoa.

578
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,282
Oh!

579
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,400
Now say, "I look good."

580
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,534
I look good.

581
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:54,205
All right.

582
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,046
All right, tell me five things
you like about yourself.

583
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,714
Go.

584
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,383
- Uh, I'm loyal.
- Uh-huh.

585

Considerate, hard worker,

586
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,954
and I like getting
into better shape

587
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,223
now that the soreness
is wearing off.

588
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,992
That's four.

589
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,094
You're going to make
me say it, aren't you?

590
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,862
Come on, let's hear it.

591
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,132
And I've got a nice smile.

592
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:23,600
Better.

593
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,370
Good. Let's go.

594
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,409
Ah, you kidding me?

595
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,079
Sorry I'm late.

596
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,914
Don't worry, you
haven't missed much.

597
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:41,385
I can't putt to save my life.

598
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,620
What happened?

599
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:46,557
Oh, I ran into traffic
on the way over.

600
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,991
No, no. Not that.

601
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,594
I mean, your look and...
And your clothes.

602
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,929
And everything.

603
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,365
I started working
with a dating coach.

604
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,801
Why, is that...
Does it look okay?

605
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:58,869
Dude,

606
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,237
women are going to
be all over you.

607
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,638
Really?

608
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,241
I told you a dating coach
was the way to go.

609
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,510
That place I suggested...
It worked.

610
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,413
No, uh, I found someone
else actually.

611
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,647
I don't know who they are,

612
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,516
but they definitely know
what they're doing.

613
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,422
And they teach golf too.

614
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,824
You know, her
name's Annie Hayes.

615
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,493
I actually went to
high school with her.

616
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,894
And she's a dating coach.

617
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,663
No, she's a party planner
working as a waitress.

618
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,966
It's, um, kind of
hard to explain.

619
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,901
Basically, she needed a job.

620
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,769
Okay, how well do
you know this lady?

621
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,138
Um, not all that well.

622
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,807
We went a high-school
dance together.

623
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,076
It was a long time ago.

624
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,978
Okay, let me see if
I've got this straight.

625
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,280
You hired someone
from high school,

626
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,015
a woman you barely even know

627
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,316
to teach you how to date,

628
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,037
and she's someone who
normally plans parties

629
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:48,886
for a living?

630
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,555
Yeah.

631
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,858

you've noticed girls

645
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,042
you've wanted to ask out.

646
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:46,777
Uh, there's this woman

647
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,812
I always see at the coffee shop

00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:49,947
my friend and I go to,

649
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,016
but I've never actually met her.

650
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,885
Hmm.

651
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,654
All right, you need to learn
how to break the ice.

652
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:02,759
Start a conversation with
someone you don't know.

653
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,661
I'm just going to
warn you right now,

654
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,964
I'm, uh, awful at this.

655
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:08,045
Okay, don't worry about it.

656
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:09,533
It... it just takes practice.

657
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,635
I'm going to give
you a few pointers.

658
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:15,505
Okay, don't use
cheesy pickup lines.

659
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,908
Just don't do it. It
always goes over badly.

660
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:18,909
Right.

661
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,912
And mostly just be yourself.

662
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,214
What do you mean?

663
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,516
Oh, wow. Uh, okay.

664
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,019
Well, when you see someone
you want to meet,

665
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,955
you just go up to them, and
you say something like,

666
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,924
"hi, I'm Harold.

667
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,805
I wanted to introduce myself.
What's your name?"

668
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:36,893
It's that easy.

669
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:39,029
Easy? It's not easy for me.

670
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,431
Hmm...

671
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,668
Okay, see that blonde
at the end of the bar?

672
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,970
That's potential
date number one.

673
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:50,941
Batter up.

674
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,576
Come on.

675
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,645
Yeah. You can do it.

676
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:56,714
Take a sip. All right.

677
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,924
Hi. I'm Harold.

678
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:09,245
Uh, I wanted to
introduce myself.

679
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:10,460
What's your name?

680
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:13,563
I'm Amy.

681
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,598
Well, it's um...

682
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,966
Nice to meet you, Amy.

683
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:20,570
You too.

684
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,453
Oh, my god.

685
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,659
What was that?

686
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,329
Harold, I didn't think I
needed to tell you this,

687
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,397
but after the introduction,

688
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,366
you got to follow it
up with something.

689
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,768
You know, "you look
great tonight."

690
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,236
Do you come here often?"

691
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,371
You make some conversation.

692
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,273
And then of course,
you ask her out.

693
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,709
So remember, it's
one, two, three.

694
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,377
You introduce yourself.

695
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,712
You make some conversation.

696
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,746
You ask her out.

697
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,147
Got it?

698
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,616
I told you, I'm not
very good at this.

699
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,918
Confidence.

700
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,120
You'll get there.

701
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:14,224
Um, I do think that maybe
we need to throw in

702
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,793
a little more extra credit.

703
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:21,499
Yeah.

704
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:28,405
Now, say something to her,
but be sincere about it.

705
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:33,510
Show her you've really paid
attention to her, yeah?

706
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,047
How about...

707
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:42,386
You have beautiful eyes.

708
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,021
Good.

709
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:49,260
That... that felt real.

710
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:54,464
How are you guys this morning?

711
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:55,799
Well. You?

712
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,701
Are you going to be here
for dinner tonight?

713
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,002
Nope. Working late.

714
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,537
I thought you worked
the day shift.

715
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,905
For job number one.

716
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,708
- There's a job number two?
- Long story.

717
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,443
Do you need help
finding a place?

718
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,612
Uh, no, thank you. I
can do it myself.

719
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,947
I got to go.

720
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,350
I bet she hasn't even
started looking.

721
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:17,154
So why is it so important that
Annie move out right now?

722
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,115
Don't you think you're being
a little hard on her?

723
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,858
Steve, she can't just have
a free ride all the time.

724
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,260
I don't get it.

725
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,261
You're more than willing
to help me set my shop up.

726
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:26,702
Why are you so tough
on your sister?

727
00:34:26,726 --> 00:34:29,699
I'm not. You don't understand.

728
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,668
You sure it's not payback time?

729
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:33,003
For what?

730
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,739
For resenting her for being
the baby of the family

731
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,509
while you had to be the more
responsible older sister?

732
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,511
It's not that at all.

733
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,414
Really?

734
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,016
All right.

735
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,286
Think about it.

736
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:55,792
Annie, I'd like to introduce
you to Willy Taylor.

737
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,894
Willy, this is Annie
Hayes, my dating coach.

738
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:58,962
Hi.

739
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,163
Nice to meet you.

740
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,724
I got to say, you're
doing a bang-up job

741
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:02,632
with my friend here.

742
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:04,601
Ah, he's doing a great
job all on his own.

743
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,571
I'm just here for moral support.

744
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,975
So when do we expect
our target to show up?

745
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:22,352
- Is that her?
- Right on time.

746
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:26,089
I can do this, I can do this.

747
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,758
- I can do this, right?
- Of course you can.

748
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,461
Just remember what
we worked on, okay?

749
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,822
You know what you're
going to say,

750
00:35:32,846 --> 00:35:37,200
so just relax.

751
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:38,902
Now make your move.

752
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,370
It's time to shine.

753
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,605
All right.

754
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:47,544
All right, here I go.

755
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,417
Hi.

756
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,521
Hi.

757
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:58,622
Are you okay?

758
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,390
I just wanted to
introduce myself.

759
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,425
I'm Harold. Harold White.

760
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,895
Julie. Julie Owens.

761
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,564
Nice to meet you.

762
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,799
I've seen you here before.

763
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,736
I've seen you too. I
love the new haircut.

764
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:15,939
And that color... It
looks great on you.

765
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,541
Oh, thanks.

766
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,810
Yeah, you always look
so, um, stylish.

767
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:25,115
Thank you.

768
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,218
So, um, what did you order?

769
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:32,622
I usually kind of play it safe and...
plain old coffee.

770
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,225
I've tried almost everything.

771
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,560
I like to switch it up.

772
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:38,728
Keeps things interesting.

773
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,230
Well, I like that.

774
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:44,968
Sounds, um, adventurous.

775
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,603
Listen.

776
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,804
Hmm?

777
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,306
Do you want to get
together sometime?

778
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:52,409
Yeah. I'd love that.

779
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,477
My number's on the back.
Call me.

780
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,948
Nice meeting you, Harold.

781
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,183
Yeah, it's nice meeting you...

782
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,553
Julie.

783
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,459
That looked promising.

784
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,696
So what happened?

785
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,664
Oh, nice!

786
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,932
Whoo!

787
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,168
You scored. I knew
you could do it.

788
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,638
I got to call Denise.
She's going to go crazy.

789
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,474
You just went from
being on the bench

790
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,576
to being the star quarterback.

791
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,844
Never thought I'd see the day.

792
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,947
Yeah. You and me both.

793
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:45,695
My advice is to make plans
to meet Julie for drinks.

794
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:47,731
It's great because
it's a public place,

795
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,366
and she'll feel more comfortable

796
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,734
since she doesn't
really know you.

797
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,236
Also, it's a short
time commitment,

798
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:56,406
so if things go south, you
don't have to stay long.

799
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,308
That's a good idea.

800
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,676
This also means

801
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:04,247
you get to advance
to the next level.

802
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,484
Time to tackle the
art of conversation.

803
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,754
Another one of my weak points.

804
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,489
Okay, let's start
with the basics.

805
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,457
Listening and asking questions.

806
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,892
They go hand in hand.

807
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,394
When you ask a question,

808
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,829
it automatically gives
you more to talk about.

809
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,198
And when a man
listens to a woman

810
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:25,201
and remembers what she says,

811
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:29,639
in the world of
relationships, it's golden.

812
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,574
Trust me on this.

813
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,543
Got it.

814
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,478
Okay, so Kim here is
going to play your date.

815
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,280
Oh. I'm good at dating.

816
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:38,348
Good.

817
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,450
Now, let's say you
guys just met,

818
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,085
- you sat down at the bar.
- Okay.

819
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,287
You got your drinks,

820
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,423
and now it's time
to start talking.

821
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,524
Okay.

822
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,392
So Harold, you start things off.

823
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:53,763
Um...

824
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,166
Hi. Uh...

825
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,569
What are your... What
are your career goals?

826
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,037
Career goals?

827
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,139
Suddenly, I'm, like,
at a job interview

828
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,700
with the inquisition.
I don't want to...

829
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:05,909
Yeah, I'm sorry.

830
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,711
Harold, not so
formal, all right?

831
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,246
Try for something a
little more relaxed.

832
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,248
Okay. Right, right. Um...

833
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,918
Right.

834
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:19,689
You, um, you look nice tonight.

835
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,225
Oh, thank you, Harold.

836
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,394
I don't even have any makeup on.
Just the lip gloss.

837
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,130
I just came from the gym.
Thank you.

838
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,032
Uh, what do you do for a living?

839
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,567
Oh, I am an actress. Yeah.

840
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:34,904
Well, um, I'm a waitress by
day and actress by night.

841
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,007
All right, well, right now, I'm
a waitress by day and night,

842
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,276
but I'm auditioning and
getting lots of call-backs,

843
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,946
thank you for asking.

844
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,115
Uh, what do you
like to do for fun?

845
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,151
Oh, for fun? Good question.

846
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,720
I, um, I collect teeth.
Different animals' teeth.

847
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,022
You know, they've already
passed on, and I love teeth.

848
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:56,259
And I raise iguanas,
which I love.

849
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,360
Mm-hmm.

850
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,395
I make, uh, art out
of pie filling,

851
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:00,797
which is fun.

852
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,433
And um, I'm a wench.
I love jousting.

853
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:08,371
I have... I'm the champion
jouster at the medieval fair.

854
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,140
No judgment.

855
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,909
Um, it's not going to be
this hard with Julie.

856
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,910
Cheers.

857
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,747
Oh, cheers.

858
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,884
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

859
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,087
So, um, what do you
do for a living?

860
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,022
I'm a sales rep in real estate.

861
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,624
I've been doing it
almost ten years now,

862
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,658
and I love it.

863
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,560
That's interesting.

864
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:33,196
And how did you get
into that line of work?

865
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,964
A friend of my dad's
is in the business.

866
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,800
It's what I always
wanted to get into,

867
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,102
so after college, I went
and worked with him.

868
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,770
That's great.

869
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,207
And, um, what do you
like to do for fun?

870
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,109
Oh, where to start?

871
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,077
I love traveling,
which I do a lot of.

872
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,680
I just got back from
Brazil, which was amazing.

873
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,918
Love fashion, love movies.
Do you like movies?

874
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,519
Yeah, sure.

875
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,589
What about horror flicks?
I love monster movies.

876
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,525
Yeah, I don't get to
see too many of them,

877
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:03,593
but you know.

878
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,727
Well, hey, you know.

879
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:06,796
Something just opened
downtown at that theater.

880
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,532
It looks really scary.
We should go see it.

881
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,035
Ooh, doesn't look
too scary, does it?

882
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,570
Well, I hope it's scary.

883
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,704
Rah!

884
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:28,151
So we're going to a
movie Friday night.

885
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,254
Hey. Good stuff.

886
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,590
Look at you, racking
up those dates.

887
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,091
How did the conversation go?

888
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,359
Pretty good, I think.

889
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,695
It doesn't take much
to get her talking.

890
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:43,566
She's really, uh, open about
the things she likes to do.

891
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:44,901
Good.

892
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:48,438
Okay, so now it's time
for you to do the same.

893
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,174
Which brings us to our
next order of business.

894
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,509
If you really want to
get close to somebody,

895
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,245
you need to start sharing.

896
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,113
You mean, like, talking
about my background,

897
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,948
that kind of thing?

898
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,317
Well, yeah, but more than that.

899
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,986
You know, getting
close to somebody

900
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,823
means talking about the
things that matter to you.

901
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,858
Like, what are you
passionate about?

902
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,628
What do you love?
What moves you?

903
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:14,330
Those are the things you
want to share with her.

904
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,900
Okay, but, uh...

905
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,268
Yeah? But what?

906
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,937
No, I'm just...

907
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,773
I'm afraid I might
disappoint, you know?

908
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:27,277
I think I might be
kind of boring.

909
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:31,614
Harold, that is so not true.

910
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:35,051
The right person is going to
love you for who you are.

911
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,152
Trust me.

912
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,088
There's just one problem though.

913
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:40,057
What?

914
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,058
Who are you?

915
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,827
I mean, I know you have
great taste in music,

916
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:49,233
but what are you
passionate about?

917
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:52,902
You took all these photographs?

918
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,437
Yup.

919
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,806
Printed them, too.

920
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:59,575
I had no idea.

921
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:01,010
There's something so exciting

922
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:04,614
to me about preserving
a perfect moment,

923
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,849
you know, to hang onto
something beautiful

924
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:12,221
that never fades nor goes away.

925
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:13,723
Does that sound corny?

926
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,159
No. Not at all.

927
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,560
I just...

928
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,830
I wouldn't have guessed you
for the creative type.

929
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,503
You just keep on getting
more and more interesting.

930
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:32,208
Mmm. It's delicious.

931
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:33,177
Really?

932
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:34,498
Well, I tried to
make it healthy.

933
00:43:34,499 --> 00:43:35,467
You sure it's good?

934
00:43:35,468 --> 00:43:36,713
It's incredible.

935
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:40,683
Harold, I had no idea you
were such a good cook.

936
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,185
- Well.
- Okay.

937
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:45,221
All of this plays
into your favor.

938
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,824
Let's recap, shall we?

939
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,426
All right, you like
candlelit dinners.

940
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:51,527
Uh-huh.

941
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,262
- Gorgeous photographs.
- Yeah.

942
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,031
Your favorite movie
is Casablanca,

943
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,872
and we're not even counting
the love songs yet.

944
00:43:56,896 --> 00:43:57,800
Need I go on?

945
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:02,605
Oh, um, does that
seem a little bland?

946
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,041
No way.

947
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:09,145
Harold, you're like this
old-fashioned romantic.

948
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,482
Most women think guys
like you are extinct.

949
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,883
Or never existed.

950
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,319
You know, at least
outside a romance novel.

951
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,287
You think so?

952
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,522
Oh, I know so.

953
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:22,125
Harold, for your next date,

954
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:25,194
I want you to share
this side of yourself.

955
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:28,131
Tell her about something
you love doing,

956
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,800
and do something with
her that's romantic.

957
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,803
I promise you, you're
not going to regret it.

958
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:34,837
All right.

959
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,507
- Okay?
- Okay.

960
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,242
- Plenty more of that.
- Mmm.

961
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,543
Good.

962
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:44,614
I loved that part when
he popped up behind her

963
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:46,282
with that big knife.

964
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:47,917
How freaky was that?

965
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:50,453
I, um, closed my eyes
through that part.

966
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,214
And then the chase scene
through the woods...

967
00:44:52,238 --> 00:44:53,356
Wasn't that scary?

968
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,159
Actually, I closed my eyes
through that part too.

969
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,528
I think I'm going to have
nightmares all week.

970
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,829
Yeah, me too.

971
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,564
It was great, wasn't it?

972
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:02,832
Yeah.

973
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,753
They have really good
double chocolate cake here.

974
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:05,902
Do you like chocolate?

975
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,537
Love it, I'm addicted.

976
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,407
Well, we could share
a piece if you want.

977
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:14,344
How could I refuse?

978
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,582
Thanks for the movie.

979
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,085
Thank you for dessert.

980
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,954
Look, I really had fun tonight.

981
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,989
Me too.

982
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,560
You're a great guy, Harold.

983
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:36,632
Good night.

984
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,969
Good night.

985
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,947
Okay, so two fries, two burgers.

986
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:53,483
Cheese on yours, no cheese.

987
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:55,124
You want fries, you
want mashed potatoes.

988
00:45:55,148 --> 00:45:56,586
Do you want coleslaw too or...

989
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,588
- Yeah, we'll do some coleslaw.
- Great, you're here.

990
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,856
I need to talk to
you for a second.

991
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,190
I... uh, Harold, what
are you doing here?

992
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,751
- I thought you had a date.
- No, I did.

993
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:04,260
- Can I just see you?
- Sure.

994
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,195
Sorry, excuse us.

995
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,830
- Is everything okay?
- Better than okay.

996
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,231
I had to come by
and say thank you.

997
00:46:09,255 --> 00:46:11,467
You were so right about
everything you taught me.

998
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,136
Being myself and
asking questions

999
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,704
and just sharing who I am.

1000
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,545
I did exactly what you
told me, and it was like

1001
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:17,707
we were really connecting.

1002
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,576
Do you know she even
kissed me good night?

1003
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,777
- That's so great.
- I know.

1004
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:22,979
I just... I feel different.

1005
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,281
Everything is gonna be
different from now on

1006
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,016
all because of you.

1007
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:29,285
Ah, thank you.

1008
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,553
Yeah.

1009
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:31,721
So we're still on for
Wednesday, right?

1010
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,055
- Yeah, for sure.
- Okay.

1011
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,957
Good, so... I'll see you then.

1012
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,192
- Okay, I'll see you.
- Bye.

1013
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,894
And... and great work.

1014
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,796
Really great.

1015
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:44,333
Wow.

1016
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:45,969
Wow.

1017
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,307
Denise, if you don't
hear from me by noon,

1018
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,109
I want you to call a paramedic.

1019
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,510
Bye, sweetheart.

1020
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:55,912
This is all your
fault, you know?

1021
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,613
- What is?
- This.

1022
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,081
Making me do all this.

1023
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,883
Ever since you
started working out,

1024
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,351
all I've been
hearing at home is,

1025
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:04,787
"why don't you get in
shape like Harold is?"

1026
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,155
And "why don't you ask Harold
to bring you with him"

1027
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,423
the next time he works out?"

1028
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:08,904
Yeah, but it feels
great, doesn't it?

1029
00:47:08,928 --> 00:47:11,627
Great? This isn't great.

1030
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,896
Great is sitting at
home on my couch,

1031
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,364
watching the game,
drinking beers,

1032
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:16,566
and eating chips.

1033
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,007
Come on, we got to
keep up the pace,

1034
00:47:18,008 --> 00:47:19,341
we only got another mile to go.

1035
00:47:19,342 --> 00:47:22,004
What? Shoot me now.

1036
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,973
You know, I was
thinking about maybe

1037
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:26,042
trying to cook for Julie.

1038
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:28,277
Maybe a candlelight
dinner or something.

1039
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,779
Who are you?

1040
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,315
Preparing candlelight dinners?

1041
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,450
I definitely don't
recognize you anymore.

1042
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,751
I don't recognize me either.

1043
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:39,522
I got to tell you, feels great.

1044
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,390
This isn't great.

1045
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:44,060
I've never seen Harold
like that before.

1046
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,429
He's, like, this whole new man.

1047
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,030
I almost didn't
recognize the guy.

1048
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,699
I know, from what
I've seen, like,

1049
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,100
you've done a great
transformation.

1050
00:47:51,124 --> 00:47:53,102
It's like you have a
gift for this, really.

1051
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,570
I mean, if word gets out, like,

1052
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,472
you could be famous,
really, you really could.

1053
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,153
You could have, like,
your face on the side

1054
00:47:58,177 --> 00:48:01,944
of, like, bus benches
or a reality show...

1055
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,014
If they offer you a series, can
I please, please play you?

1056
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:07,116
It almost sounded like

1057
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:09,585
he didn't need me
anymore though.

1058
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,220
But that... That can't be right.

1059
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,321
Right?

1060
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,390
He needs me, he needs me.

1061
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,826
For sure.

1062
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:19,462
Are you more worried about
losing your dating coach gig

1063
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:22,398
or the fact that this guy
is now off the market?

1064
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,800
What do you mean?

1065
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,769
You like him, don't you?

1066
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,371
- I... of course not.
- Yes.

1067
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,439
That is crazy, no.

1068
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,774
- You do.
- I do not.

1069
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,215
Your mouth just had
a little quiver.

1070
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:34,877
It never... Has never done that.

1071
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:38,114
No, it's professional, we're
working together, that's it.

1072
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,315
- Really?
- Really.

1073
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:40,416
- Really?
- Yes.

1074
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,620
All right, just checking.

1075
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,523
Although I have to say,
since you've worked on him,

1076
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,092
he has gotten kind of hot.

1077
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,261
I'm just saying.

1078
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,698
♪ Annie and Harold,
sitting in a tree ♪

1079
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:58,568
♪ K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪

1080
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,344
Try this.

1081
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:11,148
What is it?

1082
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:18,187
It's delicious.

1083
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,323
- Pineapple.
- Pomegranate.

1084
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:23,326
- And raspberry.
- And coconut.

1085
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,496
So tell me, what am
I learning today?

1086
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:31,334
Well, I was thinking,
you're at that stage

1087
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,736
where it's not super serious,

1088
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,738
but you want it to go that way.

1089
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,207
So now might be a
good time for you

1090
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,710
to do something nice for her

1091
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,012
or make her feel special.

1092
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:45,581
I love that. What do
you have in mind?

1093
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:48,351
All right, well, forget
expensive, all right?

1094
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,186
It shouldn't be
anything too big.

1095
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,188
You don't want to scare her off.

1096
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:54,357
So I don't know,
just something small

1097
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:57,059
to show her you really care.

1098
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,829
Oh, you know what?
I have an idea.

1099
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,430
- You do?
- Yeah.

1100
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:03,031
See, Julie's always
talking about wanting

1101
00:50:03,055 --> 00:50:04,200
to spend time in the city.

1102
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:06,235
I could take her somewhere
nice for dinner.

1103
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:07,837
Unless you think
that's too much.

1104
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,272
No, no, that could work.

1105
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,108
Gotta think about where
I could take her.

1106
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,411
It's gotta be really romantic.

1107
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,847
I could... I could probably
recommend a place.

1108
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,348
Oh, great, let me
know what it is.

1109
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,417
I'll make reservations.

1110
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,053
You know, I actually...

1111
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:26,856
I haven't been there in so long.

1112
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,992
I'm thinking, maybe we should
go there first and check it out

1113
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:32,862
just to make sure
it's the right spot.

1114
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,732
Yeah, that sounds great.

1115
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,640
♪ ♪

1116
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,409
I'm thinking, before dinner,

1117
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,577
you guys could go for
a nice, long walk,

1118
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,046
watch the sun set.

1119
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,983
I like that idea, it's,
um, it's romantic.

1120
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,985
And good for the appetite.

1121
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,453
You know, this place is perfect.

1122
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,288
Julie's gonna love it.

1123
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,689
I'm suddenly wondering
why I don't

1124
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,291
come into the city more often.

1125
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,026
Harold... I can't believe

1126
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,195
I just heard you say that.

1127
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,197
That doesn't sound like
the Harold I know.

1128
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:11,100
Well, that's thanks to you.

1129
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,102
- Oh, before I forget.
- Yeah.

1130
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:16,006
Here is your last payment.

1131
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:27,183
So... that homecoming
dance we went to...

1132
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,684
Yeah.

1133
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:32,254
We danced together.

1134
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,289
No.

1135
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,658
No?

1136
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:38,228
Are you sure?

1137
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,266
You invited a bunch
of your friends

1138
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,668
to meet us at the dance.

1139
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:50,339
I didn't really fit
in with that group.

1140
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,941
When I finally got the nerve up

1141
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:56,111
to ask you to dance,
I was too late.

1142
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:58,714
Matt Schneider had
gotten to you first.

1143
00:52:07,157 --> 00:52:10,059
Couldn't get up the
courage to ask you again.

1144
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,127
Matt Schneider?

1145
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:14,631
You remember that?

1146
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,770
Kind of thing tends
to stay with you.

1147
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,610
Sometimes longer than
people think it should.

1148
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:31,113
That's not why you
remember the dance, is it?

1149
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,283
I didn't make you
feel that way, did I?

1150
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:42,091
I'm really sorry, I...

1151
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:46,028
I promise you, I... I
never meant to do that.

1152
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:50,766
I was 15, it was just me
trying to have a good time.

1153
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,701
Yeah.

1154
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,872
It wasn't supposed to
make you feel bad.

1155
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,910
Well, hey, if it makes
you feel any better,

1156
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:05,147
you're doing a lot better
in life than I am.

1157
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:10,619
I have no career and
no relationship.

1158
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,988
Come on, Annie.

1159
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,149
I mean, you're the prettiest
girl from our high school.

1160
00:53:15,173 --> 00:53:19,528
I know you're gonna
meet somebody.

1161
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,196
I've seen your work.

1162
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:25,134
It's only a matter of time
before somebody hires you.

1163
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:28,637
You just have to
believe in yourself.

1164
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:31,707
I know I do.

1165
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,176
Wait a second.

1166
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:37,780
Did you just give
me my own advice?

1167
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:38,781
I think you did.

1168
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:41,717
Yeah.

1169
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,987
Very good.

1170
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,557
What about Billie Holiday?

1171
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,758
Oh, I love it.

1172
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,427
Have you heard her
version of Misty?

1173
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,595
Amazing.

1174
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:53,956
Although first place
for that song

1175
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,264
still belongs to Johnny Mathis.

1176
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,399
What about Tony Bennett?

1177
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,169
Classic. Definitely
in my top ten.

1178
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,570
Uh-huh.

1179
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,706
Do you like Dean Martin?

1180
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,774
You're Nobody Till
Somebody Loves You.

1181
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,910
Mm, it's one of my favorites.

1182
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,913
You know, some people
would say we're sappy

1183
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,949
or born in the wrong era for
listening to that kind of music.

1184
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,751
Who cares?

1185
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,019
It's the best stuff on earth.

1186
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,288
I know.

1187
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,557
This... This could very well be

1188
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,525
my first choice for the song.

1189
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:25,260
The song?

1190
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:28,430
Yeah, you know, the one
that becomes our song

1191
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,434
when you find the
right somebody.

1192
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,171
When you share a
song with somebody.

1193
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,640
Mm-hmm.

1194
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:41,244
Oh, I've always liked
that idea too.

1195
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,594
Did you just get in?

1196
00:54:58,595 --> 00:54:59,728
Yeah.

1197
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:02,297
Just a little while ago.

1198
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:05,634
Been putting in some
late nights, you...

1199
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,905
You look tired.

1200
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:11,607
Annie?

1201
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:12,975
Hmm?

1202
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,410
Are you okay?

1203
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,211
Yeah.

1204
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,281
Okay, don't stay up too late.

1205
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,953
Listen, I wanted to tell you...

1206
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:33,262
I know I haven't been the
best sister in the world.

1207
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:38,667
Moving in here and not
really pulling my weight.

1208
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,270
I just... Things haven't really

1209
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:45,507
worked out the way that I
wanted them to, you know?

1210
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:49,511
I never thought life
would be this hard.

1211
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:53,382
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1212
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:56,618
I just wanted you to know that.

1213
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,887
Thanks.

1214
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:01,824
And I also wanted to tell you

1215
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,860
what a great job I
think you're doing,

1216
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:09,498
being a great mom and
having a great family.

1217
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:14,470
You've got a lot to be proud of.

1218
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,407
I appreciate that.

1219
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,411
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

1220
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:24,113
Good night.

1221
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:27,183
Good night.

1222
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:52,175
Annie, yeah, it's open, come in.

1223
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:59,148
- Hi.
- Hey.

1224
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,517
Oh, wow.

1225
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:02,785
These are new, aren't they?

1226
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,788
Yeah. What do you think?

1227
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,856
I think they're amazing.

1228
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,458
They belong in a museum.

1229
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:10,592
Really?

1230
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,196
Oh, yeah.

1231
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,199
Wow.

1232
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,201
Man, this is beautiful.

1233
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,471
Thanks.

1234
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:28,043
Uh, are you ready
to get started?

1235
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,580
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

1236
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:35,250
So today we're gonna work on

1237
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,886
one of the most important
parts of dating.

1238
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:41,156
Getting close,
becoming intimate,

1239
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:43,625
you know, getting to first base.

1240
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,127
Yeah.

1241
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:49,398
This could be the most important
lesson in dating ever.

1242
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,767
Agreed.

1243
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:55,804
So how do you recommend
I make a move?

1244
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,940
Well, first of all,

1245
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,576
wait until you guys
are close together.

1246
00:58:00,577 --> 00:58:01,777
Uh-huh.

1247
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,078
After you've been talking awhile

1248
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:08,050
or when you're saying good
night at the end of the date.

1249
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:12,654
So, um, like this?

1250
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,390
Yeah, good.

1251
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:19,428
Now, the most important thing
is to be natural about it.

1252
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:22,097
You know, don't do the old "guy
gotta stretch my arm" routine.

1253
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,899
Stay away from tacky.

1254
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,434
Yep.

1255
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:28,837
And...

1256
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,373
And use your eyes.

1257
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,442
- My eyes.
- Mm-hmm.

1258
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,079
Look at a girl when
she's talking to you.

1259
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,315
And if she's looking
at you the same way,

1260
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:43,253
she's giving you
the green light.

1261
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,423
Like this?

1262
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,793
Mm-hmm.

1263
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,963
Then what?

1264
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:59,135
And then you just
lean in slowly.

1265
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,640
Yeah.

1266
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,977
And then you just...

1267
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,194
How was that?

1268
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,830
It was great.

1269
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:33,435
I mean, I mean, you
did all right.

1270
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,204
How do... How do
you feel about it?

1271
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,372
Okay.

1272
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:38,674
Just okay?

1273
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,375
Well, shouldn't I feel okay?

1274
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,778
No, no, you should be okay.

1275
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,446
Definitely be okay.

1276
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:46,748
Um, I'm just thinking
though that we should

1277
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,217
probably run through
this a few more times.

1278
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:52,054
Just to make sure you're
comfortable with everything.

1279
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,556
Yeah, I mean,
that's a good idea.

1280
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:57,192
- Sure.
- Good.

1281
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:00,429
So...

1282
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,366
I'm ready whenever you are.

1283
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:09,571
Um, so you were
pretty quiet tonight.

1284
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:11,974
What do you think
of the restaurant?

1285
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:14,042
It's nice.

1286
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,713
I just wish we could have
done more, you know?

1287
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:22,384
Seen a show or maybe
check out some clubs.

1288
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:26,588
There's just so much
to do in the city.

1289
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:30,226
Well, um, maybe next time.

1290
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,998
Can I get your chair?

1291
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:38,500
It was nice though.
Thanks, Harold.

1292
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:39,768
Sure.

1293
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:43,372
You know, um...

1294
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,173
People say I'm not
such a bad cook.

1295
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:49,478
Maybe next time we can
have dinner at my house.

1296
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,814
That sounds good.

1297
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,125
Whoo, closing time.

1298
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,594
Here we go.

1299
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:06,762
Hello?

1300
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:08,397
- Hmm?
- Anybody there?

1301
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,832
You've been in a daze all night

1302
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,435
with that, like, gooey
look on your face.

1303
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,871
You okay?

1304
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,175
Who is he, and does
he have a friend

1305
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,977
that looks like Ben Affleck?

1306
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:27,949
No, I'm just thinking
about Harold.

1307
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,653
You know, he's just not who
I thought he was at all.

1308
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:34,322
I mean, he's this
amazing photographer.

1309
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:39,594
And he's smart and
romantic and...

1310
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:41,463
And it's funny, like,
all this time,

1311
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,765
I just thought he was a nobody.

1312
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:47,035
That makes me a horrible
person, doesn't it?

1313
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,371
Nope, Annie, it
makes you someone

1314
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,474
who obviously has the
hots for this guy.

1315
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,744
Kim, he's dating someone.

1316
01:01:55,745 --> 01:02:00,916
And she's beautiful and
successful, and I'm...

1317
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:04,286
You're beautiful,
and you love him.

1318
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,554
Just admit it.

1319
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,156
I cannot like him. He's taken.

1320
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,925
And that was not my point.

1321
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,259
What was your point?

1322
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,762
I don't know, I just...

1323
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:16,565
I didn't realize what
a great guy he is.

1324
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:21,636
All right, whatever you say.

1325
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:23,472
I'm out of here.

1326
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:31,880
Whatever you're cooking
smells incredible.

1327
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:34,149
We're gonna be ready to
eat in about ten minutes.

1328
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,152
My special Risotto.

1329
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:38,487
Harold, you don't happen to know

1330
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:39,855
any event planners, do you?

1331
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,496
A good friend of mine
is putting together

1332
01:02:41,497 --> 01:02:42,657
a big fundraiser in the city.

1333
01:02:42,681 --> 01:02:43,792
Are you serious?

1334
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:46,394
- She said they're desperate.
- I know someone great.

1335
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:48,163
She and I went to
high school together.

1336
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,364
Can you get me her number?

1337
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:51,633
Yeah, of course, no problem.

1338
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:52,801
Thank you.

1339
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,903
So where are we going tonight?

1340
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:57,305
Uh, what do you mean?

1341
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:00,308
You mentioned dancing.

1342
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,029
Oh, right, yeah, no, I
thought we'd pick out

1343
01:03:02,030 --> 01:03:04,031
some records from my
collection and dance here.

1344
01:03:04,032 --> 01:03:05,180
I got lots of Sinatra.

1345
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:07,282
You like Sinatra?

1346
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,050
I guess I misunderstood.

1347
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:11,486
I thought you meant we'd be
going out for the dancing part.

1348
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,756
No, I just kind of planned
a quiet evening in.

1349
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:17,760
What do you think?

1350
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,263
Anything I can do to
change your mind?

1351
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:24,199
I'm not really into
the old stuff.

1352
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,670
It reminds me of what
my parents listened to.

1353
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:31,540
Sure, yeah, okay.

1354
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,608
Great.

1355
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:35,329
There's a new bar that
just opened downtown

1356
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,279
I've been dying to check it out.

1357
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,114
I heard they have a great band.

1358
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:41,984
I'll see what time
the show starts.

1359
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:52,027
Megan, here is a hot chocolate
with whipped cream.

1360
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,095
Thank you.

1361
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,231
And a coffee for
you, young lady.

1362
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,399
Harold.

1363
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,600
You're not gonna believe this.

1364
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:00,468
- I... I got the job.
- Whoa.

1365
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,738
I am officially employed
as a party planner.

1366
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,974
And it's in the city.

1367
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,410
You're welcome.

1368
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,579
Thank you for this too.

1369
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:14,749
So, um, how did your date go?

1370
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,319
Did slow dancing sweep
her off her feet?

1371
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,554
Not exactly.

1372
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:22,791
She, uh, really wasn't up
for a quiet evening in.

1373
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,926
She always wants to go out

1374
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:27,162
and do something...

1375
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,231
Something fast and furious.

1376
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:32,100
Ah, well, believe it or not,

1377
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:34,135
this is actually a good thing.

1378
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,905
You're starting to see
each other's differences.

1379
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:39,341
Which brings us to
our next topic.

1380
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:41,610
The subject of give and take.

1381
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,946
Compromise is essential to
making any relationship work.

1382
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:48,350
So what do you suggest I do?

1383
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,951
Well, since you gave
on the dancing bit,

1384
01:04:49,975 --> 01:04:51,553
I say switch it around.

1385
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,888
Invite her to do something
you really want to do.

1386
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,824
- You think?
- Yeah.

1387
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:59,461
If you want to be someone,
you find ways to compromise.

1388
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:03,798
And who wouldn't want to
spend time with you, Harold?

1389
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:05,200
I think that's the nicest thing

1390
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:08,803
anybody's ever said to me.

1391
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,005
Hold still for a second.

1392
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:12,073
No.

1393
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,808
No, stop.

1394
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:17,379
No way, I never pass
up a beautiful photo.

1395
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,513
Okay, that's enough.

1396
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:19,681
That's good, that's good.

1397
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,082
You know what, I'm taking photos

1398
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,151
out by the lake tomorrow,
you want to come along?

1399
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:24,519
Why?

1400
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,791
No reason, I just...
I like your company.

1401
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:31,293
Okay.

1402
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:33,662
I'll pick you up at 5:00 then.

1403
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,431
Wait, in the morning?

1404
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,835
Whew.

1405
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:43,038
Do you always get up this
early to take pictures?

1406
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,506
Well, I have to.

1407
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,808
The light is perfect
this time of day.

1408
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:48,510
It's magic hour, you know?

1409
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,312
Magic hour?

1410
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:55,550
Yeah, um, well, it's
soft, you know?

1411
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:58,920
Everything has this
nice, beautiful...

1412
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:01,456
Like, a golden look about it.

1413
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,758
It only happens at
sunrise and sunset.

1414
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:04,993
Mm.

1415
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,161
You want to take a look?

1416
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:08,530
- Go ahead.
- Yeah.

1417
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,332
Oh, wow.

1418
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,501
That's pretty.

1419
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:18,807
I feel free out here, you know?

1420
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,975
- Does that sound weird?
- No, not at all.

1421
01:06:20,976 --> 01:06:23,378
I love being out here this
time of day, it's like...

1422
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:27,182
Well, it's like the whole
world is just waking up.

1423
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,884
Yeah.

1424
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:33,421
So this event I'm planning...

1425
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:36,691
It's a fundraiser to
preserve our parks.

1426
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:37,792
Well, that's a great cause.

1427
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:39,227
It is, yeah.

1428
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:41,563
And what I'm thinking
is we could feature

1429
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,465
your gorgeous landscapes.

1430
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:46,368
No, come on, think about it.

1431
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,104
You know, photos everywhere
of what we're trying to save?

1432
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:53,641
And you'd get some free
advertising out of it.

1433
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,610
You interested?

1434
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:56,778
- Are you kidding?
- No.

1435
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:59,013
Yeah, of course I'm in.
How great.

1436
01:06:59,014 --> 01:07:01,684
All right.

1437
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,655
I love this.

1438
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:10,558
We definitely have
to use this one.

1439
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,193
Oh, are you sure
it's good enough?

1440
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:13,561
Absolutely.

1441
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:15,163
It's beautiful.

1442
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:17,232
Don't question my good taste.

1443
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:19,868
Sorry, my mistake.

1444
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,337
You can really see that
look of magic hour

1445
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:26,374
you were talking about.

1446
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,744
Somebody was paying attention.

1447
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,747
It's like, um...

1448
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:35,984
A picture out of a fairy
tale or something,

1449
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:39,455
where it's all soft and glowing.

1450
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:42,857
- Come here.
- What?

1451
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,659
- Come here.
- Why?

1452
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:49,664
You mean...?

1453
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:50,799
- No.
- Please?

1454
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,000
No, no.

1455
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,521
Julie doesn't like
this kind of music.

1456
01:07:53,545 --> 01:07:56,471
I don't have anybody
to dance with.

1457
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:59,774
And Matt Schneider isn't around
to steal you away from me.

1458
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,415
I can't believe you're
guilt-tripping me.

1459
01:08:01,439 --> 01:08:02,877
Mm-hmm.

1460
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,718
You're never gonna let
me forget that, are you?

1461
01:08:04,742 --> 01:08:06,014
Probably not.

1462
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,917
Come on, dance with me.

1463
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,820
♪ What went wrong ♪

1464
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:14,556
Well, I guess I do owe you one.

1465
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:15,890
♪ ♪

1466
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:20,629
♪ We lost each other
in every way ♪

1467
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:28,570
♪ Sometimes we're blinded,
don't you know? ♪

1468
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:32,474
So after that dance
we went to...

1469
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,108
Mm-hmm.

1470
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:37,445
You dropped me off and
walked me to the door

1471
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:40,682
and kissed me good night.

1472
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,517
No.

1473
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:44,619
- No?
- No.

1474
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:49,090
Um, you sat in the front
seat with my mother.

1475
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:52,393
When we dropped you off,
you waved good-bye.

1476
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:55,597
And that was it.

1477
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:59,100
I think that was the last
time we spoke in high school.

1478
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:03,905
♪ Suspecting all along ♪

1479
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:07,008
♪ That something was so wrong ♪

1480
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:11,746
Are you sure you didn't
walk me to the door?

1481
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:15,183
Yes.

1482
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:17,485
♪ But the memories ♪

1483
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,723
♪ They won't let me ♪

1484
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:27,162
♪ I've got a bad case,
don't you know? ♪

1485
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,501
So you and Denise should have
a good refund this year.

1486
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:36,671
Just increase the deductions
on your paychecks.

1487
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,139
You got it.

1488
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,242
Hey, how are things
going with Julie?

1489
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,877
Oh, they're going great.

1490
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:44,345
Good.

1491
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:46,247
Hey, what are you working on?

1492
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:47,815
A new landscape?

1493
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:50,419
No, it's just a
work in progress...

1494
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:55,189
Ah, pictures of people.

1495
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:58,059
The man is breaking new ground.

1496
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:01,930
This isn't Julie.

1497
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:05,600
Does somebody have a
crush on his coach?

1498
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,769
- I don't.
- Mm-hmm.

1499
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:09,771
You should go work on
your taxes, don't you...

1500
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,213
And to celebrate...

1501
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:21,115
- Whoa.
- Ta-da!

1502
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,217
Uh, what is that?

1503
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:25,119
Uh, I don't know, it
was all we had left

1504
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,222
when I closed up last night.

1505
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:29,557
Banana cream, I think.

1506
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,159
Not bad.

1507
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,794
And what's the candle for?

1508
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:34,162
Well, I wanted to
add some flair.

1509
01:10:34,163 --> 01:10:36,598
I know it's a birthday
candle, but who cares?

1510
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,167
We're celebrating
your graduation.

1511
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:41,103
Go, blow it out.

1512
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,727
There's still one more
lesson though, right?

1513
01:10:46,751 --> 01:10:49,287
True, but first a toast.

1514
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:55,383
It's official,
you're a heartthrob.

1515
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:01,623
And one of the
nicest guys I know.

1516
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,525
I hope Julie knows how
lucky she is to have you.

1517
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:09,063
But most of all, here's
to your happiness

1518
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:12,133
because you deserve it.

1519
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,701
Do I get to say a few words?

1520
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:16,037
By all means.

1521
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:18,172
A toast, back to you.

1522
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,842
I learned from the best.

1523
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,310
And I also got to
spend a lot time

1524
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:25,747
with the prettiest
girl in high school,

1525
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,650
who I always had a crush on.

1526
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,551
You did?

1527
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:34,422
I did.

1528
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:37,558
Huh.

1529
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:41,896
Okay, final lesson.

1530
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:45,667
And this is probably the
most important thing

1531
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:47,201
I will ever teach you.

1532
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:49,370
I call it my golden rule.

1533
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,205
Okay.

1534
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,540
There's not a lot to it.

1535
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:55,276
It's just something you
should always remember.

1536
01:11:55,277 --> 01:12:00,615
When in doubt, trust your gut.

1537
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,517
Follow your heart.

1538
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:07,589
And always, always be honest...

1539
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:13,495
With yourself and with
the person you're with.

1540
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,946
Oh, uh... Aah!

1541
01:12:33,348 --> 01:12:35,583
It's so wet and muddy.

1542
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:38,986
Are we there yet?

1543
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:47,562
Here it is.

1544
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:49,497
This is it?

1545
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,566
There's not, like, a
beach or something?

1546
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:54,470
No, I told you it was a
little more rustic than that.

1547
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:58,873
Oh, great, my shoes are ruined.

1548
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:01,242
I just bought them.

1549
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:05,113
Are you almost finished?

1550
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,248
Have you taken everything
you need to take?

1551
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,450
The light isn't
really what I want.

1552
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:12,086
This was supposed to be
an early morning trip.

1553
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:14,388
Well, the party ran
late last night.

1554
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:16,069
I didn't get to bed
till 2:00 this morning.

1555
01:13:16,093 --> 01:13:18,528
I overslept.

1556
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:21,129
What's wrong?

1557
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:23,531
Nothing, just not gonna
get anything I can use.

1558
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:27,769
Great, does that mean
we can leave now?

1559
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:29,337
Yeah.

1560
01:13:29,338 --> 01:13:31,373
Okay.

1561
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,028
You just have the best
laugh in the world.

1562
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,364
Aww.

1563
01:13:56,365 --> 01:13:57,532
- I gotta get going.
- Yeah.

1564
01:13:57,533 --> 01:13:59,467
Thank you so much
for stopping in.

1565
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:00,668
It was great to see you, Matt.

1566
01:14:00,692 --> 01:14:01,769
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

1567
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,738
- Bye.
- You're the best, Annie.

1568
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,107
She is the best.

1569
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,775
Nice to meet you, handsome Matt.

1570
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:11,013
Take care.

1571
01:14:17,986 --> 01:14:21,689
- Kim.
- Oh, yeah.

1572
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,124
Is that guy's name Matt?

1573
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,126
Yeah, yeah, that's Matt.

1574
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,461
Did you get his last name?

1575
01:14:27,462 --> 01:14:29,330
I forget his last name.

1576
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,766
He's a high-school
friend of Annie's.

1577
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:33,000
Is it Matt Schneider?

1578
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:36,637
Yes, Matt Schneider.

1579
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:39,273
You okay?

1580
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,441
Hey, Harold.

1581
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:43,311
Hi, I didn't know you were here.

1582
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,846
Why didn't you say hi?

1583
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:48,816
Uh, you were busy. I
didn't want to interrupt.

1584
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:51,519
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, you okay?

1585
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,489
Yeah.

1586
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:59,994
Um, I found an
apartment in the city.

1587
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,163
I'm gonna be moving there.

1588
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,264
When?

1589
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:05,299
Pretty much right away.

1590
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:09,370
Mm. Well...

1591
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:14,041
Great it's all coming
together for you.

1592
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:17,778
Seems like all your dreams
are coming true, huh?

1593
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:20,348
Yeah.

1594
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:25,019
I owe you big-time, Harold.

1595
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:30,458
It's Julie.

1596
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:34,061
Oh, take it, yeah.

1597
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:37,431
Hello.

1598
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,634
Okay.

1599
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,335
I'll see you then.

1600
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:44,273
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

1601
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:52,179
Um, I just wanted to...

1602
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,415
What?

1603
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:59,353
I just was gonna
say, um, thank you

1604
01:15:59,354 --> 01:16:02,224
for helping me get that job.

1605
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:07,329
You deserve it.

1606
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:26,814
How was your last shift?

1607
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:28,482
Great.

1608
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:31,052
Sounds like it.

1609
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:33,921
I'm moving out tomorrow.

1610
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,157
I thought you were
leaving on Saturday.

1611
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:39,160
No, my apartment's
ready in the city,

1612
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:43,030
and there's no reason
for me to stay.

1613
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:45,766
The sooner, the better, right?

1614
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,536
You could stay if you want.

1615
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:50,705
What?

1616
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,146
I thought you wanted
me to move out.

1617
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:54,075
Wasn't that the whole point?

1618
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:57,545
No, I...

1619
01:16:57,546 --> 01:17:00,614
It's... it's really hard to
stand out in this family

1620
01:17:00,615 --> 01:17:02,783
when the kid sister is you.

1621
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,418
What?

1622
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:06,887
I guess I've always
resented that.

1623
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:10,791
Uh, have you been drinking?

1624
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:15,196
Because if not, maybe now's
not a bad time to start.

1625
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:18,532
I'm serious. You
were the baby...

1626
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,693
The pretty one that got to
go out and have a good time.

1627
01:17:20,694 --> 01:17:22,228
But I had to make
a good example,

1628
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:24,271
so I just did what I was told.

1629
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:27,174
Okay, first of all, you're nuts.

1630
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:29,410
Second of all, I was
the one who couldn't

1631
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:31,412
measure up to you.

1632
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:32,646
Do you know how
many times I heard,

1633
01:17:32,647 --> 01:17:34,115
"why can't you be
more like Claire?"

1634
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:35,349
When we were growing up?

1635
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,918
- No, you did not.
- I did so.

1636
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,688
Mom and dad worshipped
you, and you know it.

1637
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:43,524
- I don't think so.
- Well, I know so.

1638
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:44,792
And I'm right.

1639
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:47,596
You're wrong, forever
and infinity, so there.

1640
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:54,068
I am so proud of you.
You are so brave.

1641
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:57,405
Going out there and
living your dreams.

1642
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:00,609
Doing all the things I never
had the courage to do.

1643
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:07,248
And I think you are a
huge success in life.

1644
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:10,718
Having a home, a family,

1645
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:14,055
all the things that
really matter.

1646
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:17,091
So we both want
what the other has.

1647
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:20,027
We're quite the pair.

1648
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:23,664
I guess so.

1649
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:27,568
I'm really sorry for making
things hard for you.

1650
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:30,271
I'm sorry too.

1651
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:33,574
I really look up to you.
I always have.

1652
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:36,044
I want you to know that.

1653
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:41,916
Will you teach me how not
to be a loser in life?

1654
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:44,085
Baby, you are not a loser.

1655
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:47,521
You're brilliant at
everything you do.

1656
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:51,892
And I want you know, I have
always thought that about you.

1657
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,060
Really?

1658
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,831
Yes, really.

1659
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:03,404
What's wrong?

1660
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:07,842
Nothing, nothing.

1661
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:10,812
Just the man of my
dreams is already taken.

1662
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,661
- Hi.
- Hi.

1663
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,864
Thanks for coming.

1664
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:31,799
Do you want to get something?

1665
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,069
No, no, I'm fine.

1666
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,371
Julie, there's something
I wanted to t...

1667
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:40,107
Before you do, there's
something I need to say first.

1668
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,375
- This can't wait, I...
- No.

1669
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:44,078
Really, please.

1670
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:48,048
I've been thinking about
a lot of things...

1671
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:49,950
About us.

1672
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:54,755
And I just think that we're
two very different people,

1673
01:19:54,756 --> 01:19:58,792
which is why I think we should
stop seeing each other.

1674
01:19:58,793 --> 01:20:01,595
Are you saying you don't
want to see my anymore?

1675
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:04,031
I hope you understand.

1676
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:06,300
I think it's for the best.

1677
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,135
No, that's great.

1678
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,070
I mean, it's not
great, I'm just...

1679
01:20:10,071 --> 01:20:14,675
I'm glad that we're
on the same page.

1680
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:18,245
I guess so.

1681
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:22,650
Look, Julie, I want to thank
you for being honest.

1682
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,587
Because I really think
that's the best way.

1683
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:28,757
Yeah.

1684
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:33,561
You take care.

1685
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,997
Good-bye, Harold.

1686
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:48,042
Take that picture, and put
it in the corner over there.

1687
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:51,212
Thank you.

1688
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:52,313
Are you the Annie Hayes

1689
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:54,548
responsible for putting
all this together?

1690
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:56,717
Um, that depends,
do you like it?

1691
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,118
I love it.

1692
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:01,322
- Then I'm Annie Hayes.
- And I'm Malcolm Winters.

1693
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:02,423
Hi.

1694
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:04,992
This is amazing.

1695
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:07,194
My hobby is photography.

1696
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,597
But whoever did these
is a true artist.

1697
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:11,332
His name's Harold White.

1698
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:15,169
Listen, my company's having
its Diamond Jubilee.

1699
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,072
I'd like to talk to you
about it, here's my card.

1700
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:20,674
Give my office a call next
week and set something up.

1701
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:23,711
I will, thank you.

1702
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,379
That's great.

1703
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,747
You're staying for the party?

1704
01:21:26,748 --> 01:21:28,048
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

1705
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:30,484
And I can introduce you to
my photographer friend.

1706
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,853
I love his work. See you later.

1707
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:35,390
Okay.

1708
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:38,025
Great job.

1709
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:40,428
Thank you.

1710
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,072
Harold, why aren't
you in the city?

1711
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:54,375
Doesn't the party start at 7:00?

1712
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:55,976
I just wanted to leave
this for Annie.

1713
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,777
For you to give her the
next time you see her.

1714
01:21:57,801 --> 01:22:00,537
Can I see?

1715
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:05,953
Mommy, look, it's me and Annie.

1716
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:08,055
I also, um, wrote a letter

1717
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:10,958
explaining to Annie why I
wouldn't be there tonight.

1718
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:14,028
I don't understand why you're
not going to the party.

1719
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:16,764
You got Annie the job, your
photos are on display.

1720
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,165
Well, there's only so many times

1721
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:21,935
I can let myself be
rejected by Annie.

1722
01:22:21,936 --> 01:22:23,972
What are you talking about?

1723
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:29,943
I had a bad experience a
bunch of a years ago.

1724
01:22:29,944 --> 01:22:31,879
Annie and Matt Schneider
were a big part of it,

1725
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,014
and I don't want to go
through that again.

1726
01:22:34,015 --> 01:22:37,184
I'm sorry, I'm...
I'm confused here.

1727
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:40,155
Me too.

1728
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:45,025
Matt Schneider
really likes Annie.

1729
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:48,562
She seems to like him too.

1730
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,365
You really don't get it.

1731
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:54,568
Annie likes you.

1732
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:57,805
Annie told mommy that you
were the man of her dreams.

1733
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,441
She did? She said that?

1734
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:01,542
Those were her exact words,

1735
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:05,045
except she thought
you were taken.

1736
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,515
You can still make it.

1737
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:16,457
Before I turn the evening
over to dancing,

1738
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,826
I'd like to thank our donors.

1739
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:25,432
For all of you who have been
admiring the impressive

1740
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:27,534
images around the room,
I'd like to introduce

1741
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:29,470
the photographer.

1742
01:23:29,471 --> 01:23:31,673
Is Harold White in the room?

1743
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:39,481
Mr. White?

1744
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:47,721
Hi, I'm Harold.

1745
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:50,524
Mr. White has offered to
donate all the proceeds

1746
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:52,526
from the sale of his photographs

1747
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:55,195
to help us save our parklands.

1748
01:23:57,365 --> 01:24:01,001
Thank you, sir.

1749
01:24:01,002 --> 01:24:02,669
Thank you, everyone.

1750
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:06,273
Uh, I need to thank
someone special.

1751
01:24:06,274 --> 01:24:10,644
She's the person who put
this whole party together.

1752
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:13,247
She's a woman of many talents.

1753
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:17,317
And, uh, I'm living
proof of that.

1754
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:19,019
Her name is Annie Hayes.

1755
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:27,227
Annie and I knew each other
a little in high school,

1756
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,930
but recently, I've
had the chance

1757
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:33,801
to get to know her much better.

1758
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:36,403
She's taught me a
lot about who I am,

1759
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:38,873
who I want to be.

1760
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,344
I don't know how I'm ever

1761
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:47,048
gonna thank her for everything.

1762
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:54,488
Annie, I like my life so
much more with you in it.

1763
01:24:54,489 --> 01:24:57,392
I'd like to keep it that way.

1764
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,498
Oh, and, uh, I agree with you.

1765
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:06,300
I think this would make
an excellent choice

1766
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:09,938
for the song.

1767
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:27,354
♪ I wanna be loved ♪

1768
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:31,124
♪ With inspiration ♪

1769
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:34,728
♪ I wanna be loved ♪

1770
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:36,964
