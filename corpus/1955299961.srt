1
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,056
The burning question today
on "Halla Bol" is...

2
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,631
The future of Pro Take-Down
in India.

3
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,002
Pro Take-Down - call it
"mixed martial arts"

4
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,202
Or free style wrestling.

5
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,943
The debate has raged for
3 months now...

6
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:11,272
is this tournament a losing
battle in India or not?

7
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:15,049
Hard to say how much money
is at stake.

8
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:19,513
But one thing is certain that
the losses will be huge.

9
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,851
The crowds gave a cold shoulder
to Pro Take-Down.

10
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,255
It means that Aakash Oberoi
- son of the Ex-President...

11
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,464
of the Olympic committee,
Mr Gyan Singh Oberoi...

12
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,395
who imported this cricket-league
like idea to India...

13
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,796
has suffered a major setback.

14
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:36,235
A board meeting is in progress.
A decision is awaited.

15
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,941
It's been proven that...

16
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,338
the only game that counts
in India is cricket.

17
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,774
Indian fans have smacked down
this wrestling league...

18
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,982
and it's safe to say that
this sports franchise...

19
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,149
has seen its last days.

20
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,587
I'm sorry for your losses...

21
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,160
and I take full responsibility.

22
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,898
I know Pro Take-Down
was my brainchild...

23
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,165
but each one of you believed in it.

24
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,463
I didn't sell you fast food.

25
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:14,605
You knew this sport is among the
world's top 5 money-spinners.

26
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,612
I still believe in it.

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,307
All I am saying is...
give me six more months.

28
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:20,907
I'll compensate you all.

29
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,451
Don't make this a personal
ego issue, Aakash.

30
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,016
We know the format is ﬂawed.

31
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,454
But don't know why.

32
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,718
No! I don't agree with you.

33
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,227
What can you do in 6 months that
you couldn't do in 2 years?

34
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,728
Maybe you're right.

35
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,101
I know we've lost our money.

36
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,505
The stadiums are empty.

37
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,434
If we shut down the franchise...

38
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,169
the remaining sponsors will
disappear. We'll be in dire straits.

39
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,038
And I won't let that happen.

40
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,943
All I'm saying is give me
one last chance.

41
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,149
Mr Patel, trust me.

42
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,655
I won't let you down.

43
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,295
Once again Aakash Oberoi has
managed to dodge the press.

44
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,663
He did not take any questions
from the media.

45
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,893
Does his silence mean the
end of Pro Take-Down?

46
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,807
We'll only know that in 6 months.

47
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,842
How long have you got?

48
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,943
6 months.

49
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,153
Dad, I'm sorry for all the losses.

50
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,856
You were right.

51
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,519
This sport has no future in India.

52
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,562
There is a future...
but you don't see it.

53
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:48,064
You know what a big hit
this sport is abroad...

54
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,441
the foreigners love it.

55
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,765
We aren't them, Aakash.

56
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,206
That's a problem with your
generation, son.

57
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,740
You think everything imported
is cool.

58
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,411
Meaning?

59
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,119
There's a future for this sport here.

60
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,192
But not how the foreigners want it.

61
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:16,031
You see, India is a land of values,
relationships and its roots.

62
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:23,103
If an Indian wrestler pins a
foreigner down in that ring...

63
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:27,808
the crowds will ﬂood these
empty stands.

64
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,709
Are you serious?

65
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,279
Do you think an Indian wrestler...

66
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,075
can last a single round against
these 7-foot foreign giants?

67
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,420
Sultan.

68
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,991
I have seen him fight, Aakash.

69
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,822
His strength is from within.

70
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,566
That strength is an inspiration.

71
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,767
Winning is not his whim but a habit.

72
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,100
Pulverizing opponents is not
his habit but a talent.

73
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,336
His eyes have spark.
His arms are like rocks.

74
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,318
One of his tackles equals
ten of others.

75
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:13,289
Haryana Sports Festival sponsored
by Astral Pipes...

76
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,288
welcomes you all to this mega
wrestling bout.

77
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,529
In the grand finale...

78
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,630
The lion, the soul,
the pride of Haryana...

79
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,537
Sultan Ali Khan...

80
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,709
will face 10 wrestlers inside
the 50-yard mud pit...

81
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,604
and aim to reach the green ﬂag.

82
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,246
Can he break this record?

83
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,212
We are here to see this feat.

84
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,916
If he wins the title...

85
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:47,682
the Wrestling Federation will
present Sultan an Escort's tractor

86
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,827
See those women, Varun?

87
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,587
I guess they have sacrificed
their daily soaps...

88
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,662
to catch a glimpse of
Sultan's heroics.

89
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,268
You are the son of the soil

90
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,907
You are the son of the soil

91
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,407
Between the realms of
heaven and earth

92
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,812
Lingers your magnificent soul

93
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,921
O Sultan

94
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,412
And here comes Sultan...

95
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,616
the pride, the sun of
Haryana - Sultan!

96
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,166
You are the son of the soil

97
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:06,494
Mr Gyan, mark my words

98
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,634
He's the only wrestler in India...

99
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,205
worthy of winning an Olympic medal.

100
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,669
O Sultan

101
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,581
That's another wrestler down!

102
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,249
Another bites the dust!

103
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,063
Sultan is snapping these wrestlers
like matchsticks!

104
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,673
Another one down!

105
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,958
Great scenes here!
Women are on their feet!

106
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,891
Sultan is on his way
in making history.

107
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,793
He sure will.

108
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:29,076
Shammi, this guy will be
a handful for Sultan.

109
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,656
Sultan, stay down.
Or I'll break you!

110
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,432
Sultan's special tackle. He won't
get up any time soon.

111
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:52,666
Glory to Sultan!
He's created history.

112
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:58,142
The lion, the pride,
the soul of Haryana...

113
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,383
Sultan Ali Khan!

114
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,683
He is the champion!

115
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,457
<i>The winner of the Escort's tractor.</i>

116
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,360
And winner of 15kgs of Paras
clarified butter.

117
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:17,327
Look at the ladies dancing.
He's won them over too.

118
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:23,101
Aakash, if you get him
inside this ring...

119
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,038
trust me...

120
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,478
all of India will chant
just one name...

121
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,413
Sultan! Sultan!

122
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,859
"If you burn daughters?
How will your sons find wives?"

123
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,236
Like that sage, that mystic

124
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,444
The one lost in himself

125
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,808
A king as lost as Alexander

126
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,948
The one lost in himself

127
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,157
Oh... she'll show up in style

128
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,484
Oh... she'll tempt with a smile

129
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,630
Oh... she'll enchant with guile

130
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,561
Hear the wheels turn
of our entwined lives

131
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,731
Like the heartbeat of a drum

132
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:36,079
Hear the wheel turn
of our bittersweet life

133
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,839
Like the heartbeat of a drum

134
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,322
Like a moody wave, it falls
and rises

135
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,717
No smoke, no fire,
yet how it singes

136
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,358
Oh yes!

137
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,901
"Buroli Village - 10 km."

138
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,110
Mercurial like mercury

139
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,275
Silken or velvety

140
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,478
Or quicksand that's deep

141
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,546
This slice of life

142
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,682
This reluctant recluse

143
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,919
The one lost in himself

144
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,147
Playing a warrior by day

145
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,290
The one lost in himself

146
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,309
Got your salary?

147
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,479
Yes, sir. They are waiting for you.

148
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,484
- Good morning...
- Good morning, sir.

149
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,996
Sign here. Add the date here.

150
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,272
Father's name here.

151
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,113
- Is Sultan Ali Khan here?
- He's inside.

152
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,707
Your job will get done today.

153
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,849
Sir, how long will you keep filling
this with 10s and 20s?

154
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,124
These won't do for you.

155
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,084
It will work, Rajbeer.

156
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,889
It will take time, but it'll work
for sure.

157
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,823
Thanks.

158
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,396
Dad, is his name really
Sultan Ali Khan?

159
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:15,804
From the Water Department?

160
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,804
He's out of shape... all ﬂab.

161
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,009
No good for us.

162
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,836
I saw some local wrestling
clubs on the way...

163
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,341
I could find a younger
wrestler there.

164
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,513
Oh, come on! Not that again.

165
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,218
Call Mr Sultan. This has become
a running joke.

166
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,818
Dad, one second. Hold on.

167
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,388
You are the son of the soil

168
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,635
Between the realms of
heaven and earth

169
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,735
Lingers your magnificent soul

170
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,002
O Sultan

171
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,506
Go.

172
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,050
Dad, you were right.

173
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:12,585
Excuse me...

174
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,027
Sultan?

175
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:15,729
Yes?

176
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,299
How is Mr Gyan doing?

177
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,066
He's fine.

178
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,530
You look like your old man.

179
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,432
Thanks for the offer.

180
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,640
But I've given up wrestling.

181
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,307
Quote a price, I'll get you
a good deal.

182
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,550
Don't even try.

183
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,211
I hate that ring.

184
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:38,955
Give my regards to Mr Gyan.

185
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,621
Name your price. Go on.

186
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,151
I'll swing things around,
adjust to your needs.

187
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,306
If you weren't Gyan's son...

188
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:02,036
I would've swung you around,
adjusted you for keeps.

189
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,915
Your father is a good man.

190
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,382
We don't accept this pass.

191
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,857
Neither your pass nor
your staff permit.

192
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,689
Go find another bus.

193
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:26,267
Govind, the old man doesn't
have the ticket money.

194
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,798
Who doesn't?

195
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,103
What happened, sir?

196
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,076
Got it.

197
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,304
This man is beyond buying tickets.
He's had it rough.

198
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,840
Get him in the bus.

199
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,615
Listen... be careful.

200
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,444
He's weak. He might collapse.

201
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,711
Big trouble.

202
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,080
Excuse me, Govind?

203
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,149
Yes.

204
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,924
Aakash Oberoi.

205
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,327
- Where are you from?
- Delhi.

206
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,728
A friend of Sultan's?

207
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:55,723
Yes.

208
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:59,833
I want to talk about Sultan.
Spare two minutes?

209
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,398
Please step over there.

210
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,104
Take charge.

211
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,406
The offer is great, Mr Aakash.

212
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,278
- A chair?
- I'm good.

213
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,237
It's impossible.

214
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,416
Sultan will never return to the ring.

215
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:14,747
Why?

216
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:17,847
It's a long story.

217
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,118
The most famous love story
in our hometown.

218
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,969
You see, Sultan's love
wounds run deep.

219
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,773
No blood. No scars.

220
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,911
Whether you speak to me or not

221
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,020
Whether you refuse to accept
the love in my eyes

222
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,685
Whatever you do, never say:
O crazy one

223
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,591
Don't see me again.
Don't take my name

224
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:07,362
Your love is my only faith,
my oneness

225
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,169
Bid me and I will surrender to You,
O Bulleh Shah

226
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:19,005
I lose myself

227
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,617
I lose myself in a trance
to seek the one I love

228
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,185
I follow your path, O Bulleh Shah

229
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,629
I lose myself in a trance
to seek the one I love

230
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,799
Without thought of myself,
Bulleh Shah

231
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,033
You are my breath,
my only strength

232
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:54,348
Some ties are strengthened
by separation

233
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:05,855
Ever thirsty to see the beloved

234
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,296
Ladies and gentlemen.

235
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,590
On the auspicious harvest
festival of Baisakhi...

236
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,966
Buroli village will witness a
kite-ﬂying competition finale.

237
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:19,709
Here's Rakesh with the blue kite
and Rehmat with the red.

238
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:26,508
Govind, are you sure this dish
is robust?

239
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,051
Will it withstand a storm?

240
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,786
Don't worry, Uncle.

241
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,115
Our brand and deeds are famous
across all Buruli.

242
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:40,520
Hey Sultan, I hope we can get
Fashion TV?

243
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,262
Uncle, I'm impressed.

244
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,832
Your body antenna is ageing but you
still want young racy channels.

245
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,106
Looks like you're having
magic medicine.

246
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,134
Try cold water. It's calming.

247
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,304
How are you, Sultan?

248
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:56,341
Titu.

249
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:59,211
- Govind, hope all is well?
- Yes.

250
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,076
- I hear you're getting married.
- But you're not invited.

251
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,256
Who do you think will win
the kite contest?

252
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,549
Rakesh.

253
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,383
Sure?

254
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,286
Want a bet?

255
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:15,361
Bet instead on the guy who'll
claim the loose kite.

256
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,730
What is it?

257
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,401
Scared?

258
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,206
My brother once told me...

259
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:27,202
there's no one better than
Sultan in all of Rewari...

260
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,603
when it comes to claiming kites.

261
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:30,844
So?

262
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,206
Age catching up?

263
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,381
Bones rattling, eh?

264
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,248
Titu, we are done with these
petty things...

265
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,420
we're into serious territory now.

266
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,182
Fine. Let's bet, Titu.

267
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:48,224
If Sultan catches the laser's
kite within three minutes...

268
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,091
you'll ride a donkey with a
blackened face through the village.

269
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:53,466
OK?

270
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,863
Agreed.

271
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,232
Rehmat's red kite snaps!

272
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:58,806
Come on, Sultan!

273
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,735
What the hell?

274
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,512
You broke my dish.
Where are you running?

275
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,312
What the hell are you doing?

276
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,713
I'm here for Jeelu. Come on, Jeelu.

277
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,565
- Q for?
- Queen.

278
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,460
- R for?
- Rat.

279
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,707
- S for?
- Sultan!

280
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,531
Dimwit. Look where you're going.

281
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,266
What the hell! First you
slip under my bike...

282
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,527
then you manhandle me.

283
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,201
What are you staring at?

284
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,208
I'll pop your eyes out.

285
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,339
Sleaze bags like you have given
India a bad name.

286
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,408
What happened, sister?

287
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,273
How dare you touch me?
Are you with him?

288
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,638
Is this your gang?

289
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,913
- Let's go.
- Get lost!

290
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,120
You make it tough for girls to go
out. Broke my helmet too.

291
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,618
Why are you bullying the buys?

292
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,346
Shut up!

293
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,752
Hurry! Titu will get the kite.

294
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,159
Titu, brother.

295
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,458
I think I should gift you a free
cable connection.

296
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:43,898
Forget that. Who will ride the
donkey with a blackened face?

297
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,380
Your Dad.

298
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,594
Salaam, grandma.

299
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:10,195
Salaam, my dear child.

300
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,462
The apple of my eye.
Sultan, how are you?

301
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,998
I greeted you too. At least
acknowledge it, Mr Shareif.

302
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,572
Mother, hear how sharp
his tongue is now?

303
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,209
What's he saying?

304
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,883
You're pushing 30 and still
so immature.

305
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,854
Squabbling over kites with
kids half your age.

306
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,487
Squandered all my hard earned
savings on your cable TV business.

307
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:40,461
To show what? Fashion TV?

308
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:41,557
Shameless!

309
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,857
Give me a break, Shareif.

310
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,462
As if my cataract operation
wasn't bad enough.

311
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:52,865
Now you're after this poor boy
like some bull.

312
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,869
I warn you.

313
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,510
Some day he'll burn this house down.

314
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,681
Grandma, I found you
a daughter-in-law.

315
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:02,849
Oh, where?

316
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,212
He's nuts.

317
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,452
In the middle of the town square...

318
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:12,018
a girl beat me to a pulp.

319
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,890
But when I set eyes on her,
I knew...

320
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,297
I could spend a lifetime with her.

321
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,103
You're really nuts.

322
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:22,470
What now?

323
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:28,837
Son, if you have the right
feeling about this...

324
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:32,305
then no point delaying.

325
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:35,616
Just walk up to her and tell
her honestly.

326
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:41,620
I love you and I want to marry you.

327
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:43,458
- Are you sure?
- Of course!

328
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:48,958
Take this piece of string and
tie it at the holy shrine.

329
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:54,402
Your wishes will come true.
Go now.

330
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,634
It looks like a wedding.

331
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,513
Look, sister-in-law.

332
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,379
We were delayed by a day.
And she was married.

333
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,417
Who took the ceremonial tray?

334
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,247
Listen, get the tray.

335
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,685
Saved by a whisker, Govind.

336
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,187
Or I would've eloped with
another man's bride.

337
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:22,787
Sweets!

338
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,395
What are you doing?

339
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,407
Are those your feet?

340
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:37,175
Which ones?

341
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,244
The ones I just saw.

342
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:44,043
They're not feet, madam...
but fine like Taj Mahal marble.

343
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:48,989
You must sell tickets for
people to see them.

344
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,056
You must know what this is.

345
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,826
A hammer, not a palm.

346
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:55,155
One slap and your teeth will
pop out.

347
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,659
Don't act smart.

348
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:59,526
No, listen. My name is
Sultan Ali Khan.

349
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,496
Owner of Mehbooba & Mehbooba
Dish TV. Full Fashion TV.

350
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,199
Don't throttle English.
It's beyond you.

351
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:10,544
I think English is a short cut
to a girl's heart.

352
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,179
A simple I love you lands
you a kiss.

353
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,684
Do you know what they call the
likes of you in English?

354
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,523
Shit guy.

355
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,696
Shit guy! Sounds great.

356
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,663
Great!

357
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,861
What did she say?

358
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,802
She called me a shit guy,
dipped in honey.

359
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,831
Let's follow her.

360
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,216
She's gone inside, damn it.

361
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,423
Know whose marriage party this is?

362
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,991
Titu's! Meaning, our party.

363
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,997
This is the land of rebels
and bravehearts.

364
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,013
Aunty, enough spoons
and percussions.

365
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,814
That's done. Time for the DJ.

366
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,324
What do you call a girl you like
in English?

367
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,896
I have an English-speaking friend.

368
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:39,098
On the phone all day with
his girlfriend.

369
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:43,198
Baby, have you eaten?
Baby, have you bathed?

370
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,836
Hey Mr DJ. Play me my song.

371
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,641
Baby, what do you like?

372
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,544
Turn the bass up!

373
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:53,339
Turn the bass up. Want me
to shout you?

374
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,281
That means... my baby
loves the bass.

375
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,822
The dazzling dame
has upped her game

376
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:08,462
The lads around are ﬂoured
to the ground

377
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,562
She's cool. She's wise.
She's got the spice

378
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,632
Comes across like a boss

379
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,435
Smitten strung men
wilt to yes-men

380
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,378
Her eyes mesmerise like poetry

381
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,810
My eyes can hardly read a word

382
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,484
Before I knew it...

383
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:35,655
...she stole my heart away

384
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:43,391
She brushed me aside
and told the DJ

385
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,097
Pick one my friend
- a beat or bullet

386
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,303
Because Baby loves to
groove on bass

387
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,309
Baby loves to groove

388
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:03,409
When she grooves I like her moves

389
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,630
Oh my poor little poodle

390
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,803
Don't believe make-believe

391
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,801
Let me draw your attention

392
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,631
To my gang of 16 gals

393
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,666
Many come, many go

394
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,672
Many drop dead at my feet

395
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,446
Luring me with love songs

396
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,249
Because Baby loves to
groove on bass

397
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,709
You have me spellbound

398
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,710
My heart is your captive

399
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,814
All I see is you

400
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,677
I have forgotten the world

401
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,815
You chase me shamelessly

402
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,918
You seem quite stubborn

403
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,714
You may think you're cool

404
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,449
But you're just a fool

405
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,521
I love your face turning
red in rage

406
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,122
Baby loves to groove on bass

407
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,445
The girl wants to dance

408
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,076
The boy wants to romance

409
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,447
He shouts out to the DJ

410
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,174
Don't you take a chance

411
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,681
Put your hand up and dance

412
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,717
She's a modern girl

413
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,854
You mess with my Baby

414
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,751
And there'll be problems

415
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,753
She burns you like fire

416
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:54,725
Flames your desires

417
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:56,794
A high fashion diva

418
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,795
A spark of a livewire

419
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:01,137
I am crazy about you

420
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,235
My heart's crushing
under your heels

421
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,270
You tap them on the dance ﬂoor

422
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,510
As you move to the groove

423
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,874
She likes her music booming loud

424
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,884
Baby loves to groove

425
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:58,051
I'm your shit guy!

426
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:02,991
Shit guy.

427
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,400
Sultan...

428
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,674
Brother! Sultan.

429
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,266
Here.

430
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,609
Here's the English-to-Hindi,
Hindi-to-English dictionary.

431
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,348
I discovered the meaning
of shit guy.

432
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,313
And it means?

433
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,453
Shit means faeces.

434
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,850
And guy means a boy.

435
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,463
Literal translation is
"faeces boy."

436
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,965
Means latrine.

437
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,697
That sounds like a foul insult.

438
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,074
Doesn't sound like it. It is.

439
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:49,772
Govind.

440
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,648
I have been called a swine,
a scoundrel...

441
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:00,319
but no one's ever called me faeces.

442
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,988
This is a serious insult.

443
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,989
It's seriously insulting.

444
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,131
The lady deserves a fitting reply.

445
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,100
I know her name. It's Aarfa.

446
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,664
Aarfa.

447
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:23,112
She's Barkat's daughter,
from the wrestling club.

448
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,044
- A wrestler's daughter.
- She's here somewhere.

449
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,943
Now starts a deadly contest.

450
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,344
The winner will be awarded...

451
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,623
15 kilos of Paras clarified butter...

452
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,490
gifted by the Rickshaw Union
chief Mr Yaseen.

453
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,491
This special contest will see...

454
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:48,227
the local champion Bagga pitted
against the lioness of Buroli...

455
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:51,533
daughter of strongman
Barkat... Aarfa!

456
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,746
Well done!

457
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,414
Push him!

458
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:02,445
Get him!

459
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,249
Aarfa, tackle him!

460
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,388
She's just returned from Delhi.

461
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:10,052
Speaks good English...

462
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,123
and is a state wrestling champ.

463
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,487
She and her father dream of
winning Olympic gold.

464
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,798
Flip him over!

465
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,661
What a girl...

466
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,695
I'm willing to be a shit guy
for her sake.

467
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,367
Even a pee-guy.

468
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,642
I don't care. She's the only one
I'll marry.

469
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:39,454
It's a great plan...
but how will you do it?

470
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:40,685
My dear man...

471
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,856
just like doctors marry doctors...

472
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,492
engineers marry engineers...

473
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:49,524
only a wrestler completes
another wrestler.

474
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,499
Meaning?

475
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,461
What it means is...

476
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,301
I will wrestle for her.

477
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,073
What they call in English,
a wrestler.

478
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,177
That's a defining move.

479
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,541
Bagga is down!

480
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,183
The lioness of Buroli
is the champion!

481
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:17,923
Bravo!

482
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,194
Madam, autograph, please.

483
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,468
You are a terrific fighter. You
made mince-meat of Bagga.

484
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:28,734
You stalking me?

485
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,200
What were you saying?
"Baby loves bass?"

486
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,270
One kick on your base will
knock sense into you.

487
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,044
Madam, I want to clear the air.

488
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,542
I'm a straightforward guy.
I speak from the heart.

489
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,046
I've fallen in love with you.

490
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,378
I want to marry you and
once we're married...

491
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,316
I'd like to call you Aarfa baby.

492
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,853
Ok. So you are a Romeo?

493
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:52,827
But you know...

494
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,657
I've decided to marry a wrestler.
And you're not one.

495
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,761
Madam, exactly 5 minutes
ago I decided...

496
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,594
to become a wrestler like you.

497
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,902
And fight in the same soil as you.

498
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,267
Listen, Romeo-Wrestler.

499
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,000
Stop these miserable attempts
and get out.

500
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,907
Dad's wrestlers will make
mince-meat out of you.

501
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,649
You'll be counting broken
bones all your life.

502
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,942
Madam, are you trying to scare me?

503
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:20,081
I'll see you in the morning
at Barkat brother's...

504
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,516
Barkat uncle's club.

505
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,528
I'd like to see if bones break
or heart's unite.

506
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:31,822
And Madam...

507
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,661
I'm not a shit guy.

508
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:35,832
Yes, Daage.

509
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,262
Go for the jugular.
The scissors move.

510
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,871
Nonsense!

511
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,642
You'll never win the championship
this way.

512
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,208
You have 10 days.

513
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:45,378
Go again.

514
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,478
Excuse me, sir.

515
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,112
How can I help you?

516
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,386
Sir, the thing is, I want to
learn wrestling.

517
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:56,291
What do you know about wrestling?

518
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,561
Sir, what's there to know?
It's simple.

519
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,793
Grab your opponent, slam him
down. Pin him to the ground.

520
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,229
Forget it, it's not for you.

521
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,969
A large beefy man wearing
a tiny piece of cloth?

522
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,201
Have some shame.

523
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,305
Sir, I promised my father...

524
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,806
I'd win a medal for India
in the Olympics.

525
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:19,146
A gold medal.

526
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,542
What they call in English, gold?

527
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:25,017
I'll stand like Shah Rukh Khan
in golden sunﬂower fields...

528
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:27,289
with my welcoming arms open wide.

529
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,225
Sir, don't make fun of
Shah Rukh Khan.

530
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:33,818
I really like him.

531
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,423
When he looks into a girl's eyes...

532
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,032
even a blind girl falls for him.

533
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,430
Are you here to wrestle or romance?

534
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,769
Sir, I believe whatever you do...

535
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:48,605
it should have some romance.

536
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,513
You're witty. What's your name?

537
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,410
Played any other sport?

538
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,780
Yes. No one claims a loose
kite faster than me...

539
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,786
in all of Rewari district.

540
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,684
Shame. There's no kite contest
in the Olympics.

541
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,087
Sir, claiming kites is not easy.

542
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,561
If you don't believe me, let's bet.

543
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,367
I challenge three of your finest men.

544
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,967
If they catch me, you won't
see me again.

545
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,533
But if I win...

546
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,600
you'll make me your disciple.

547
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,776
And teach me this tackle.

548
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,778
Sorry.

549
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:26,746
I accept.

550
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,647
Pawan, Yasin, Rakesh.
Get into the pit.

551
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,613
Let's see how fast he is.

552
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:32,852
Come on.

553
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:36,187
Okay.

554
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,255
Ready?

555
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:40,624
Start!

556
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:58,100
Sir, help me. I don't want
to die a bachelor!

557
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,216
You've confirmed my belief
in the theory of evolution.

558
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,778
Man did come from the apes.

559
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,857
Tomorrow 6 am. See you at the arena.

560
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:17,925
Yes, sir.

561
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,205
Oh damn, two ambulances?

562
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,212
What happened, Pawan?

563
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,015
Has Barkat sir passed on?

564
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,309
Are you crazy?

565
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,947
We'll pop it before he does.

566
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,849
That's just his blood donation camp.

567
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:50,682
Aarfa madam organizes it annually.

568
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,959
We don't have a blood bank
in our village.

569
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,854
Go and donate some blood. You'll
get oranges and bananas.

570
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:57,830
Will I donate blood?

571
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,595
I guess I will.

572
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,067
She's not my wife yet, but she's
sucking my blood already.

573
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,600
What a girl!

574
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:08,404
Are you checking everyone's vitals?

575
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,371
Yes.

576
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,441
Oh, you're here.

577
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,271
Good. Lie down.

578
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,842
I have never donated blood.

579
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,047
I feel weak.

580
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:21,083
Nonsense. Sister, check
his blood group.

581
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:24,652
A fit guy like you can easily
donate 2-3 units of blood.

582
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:27,656
Can I hold your hand?

583
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:28,689
Let go.

584
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:32,696
Let go of my hand.

585
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,535
Madam, it's not what
you're thinking.

586
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,429
He is O-negative.

587
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,539
O-negative?

588
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:45,107
Do you know only 1% of all people
in Asia have this blood group?

589
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:46,004
So?

590
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,683
Yours is a rare blood group.
Not easy to find.

591
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,010
I am a rare breed for sure.

592
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,818
No need checking me out.

593
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,352
I would've told you myself.

594
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,056
You'll find the passion
of lover Ranjha in me.

595
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:01,623
Ghalib's poetry.

596
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,590
Kumar Sands sad songs.

597
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,761
And you'll find affection too.

598
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,366
What they call in English, love...

599
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,834
the love I'm dying to give you.

600
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,307
You said you would marry a wrestler.

601
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,643
I'm a wrestler now, so marry me.

602
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:17,379
Listen.

603
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:21,242
I believe emotions weaken
a person's resolve.

604
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,516
My father and I have a dream,
to win an Olympic medal.

605
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,181
I cannot jeopardize that dream.

606
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:34,127
Want to be friends?

607
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,793
Want some sugarcane juice?

608
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,794
I need your blood first.

609
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,195
Sister, he's ready.

610
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,675
You're old enough now.

611
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,815
Why aren't you married?

612
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,711
I really want to...

613
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,847
but haven't found that spark
in anyone yet.

614
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,223
Tell me something.

615
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:09,258
How come a pretty girl like you
became a wrestler?

616
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,597
Why?

617
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,791
Do girl wrestlers have horns
on their heads?

618
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,365
I didn't mean that.

619
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,766
What I'm saying is...

620
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:21,134
sports like wrestling have been
for men in our society.

621
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:22,967
- Girls are usually...
- Usually what?

622
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,110
Born to be tied to a pillar,
like cattle?

623
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,511
I started wrestling to change
that idea.

624
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,246
You know why I fight men
in the arena?

625
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:35,414
Because your society keeps...

626
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,249
women caged behind veils
from birth to death.

627
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,329
Your society doesn't get
this simple fact...

628
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,156
if you kill daughters, how will
your sons find brides?

629
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,902
Even my father wanted a son.

630
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:49,864
He wanted him to be a wrestler.

631
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,835
Who was born? Me.

632
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,636
My mother passed away
soon after I was born.

633
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,277
But my father, he's a caring man.

634
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,739
He brought me up like a son,
sent me to a Delhi college.

635
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:03,713
Nurtured my dreams like his own.

636
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,185
I could've stayed in Delhi...

637
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:07,912
but I returned to my roots.

638
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,058
Just watch! The day I win a medal...

639
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,559
all Haryana will be known for
its Aarfa.

640
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:16,264
So watch out!

641
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,393
Keep your manhood tucked away.

642
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:21,563
Times are changing.

643
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,436
Daughters are on the move.

644
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:26,907
They'll slam you down so hard,
you'll have no idea what hit you.

645
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:29,435
Why are you smiling?

646
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,608
You remind me of Rani Laxmibai
of Jhansi.

647
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,814
You're modern from the outside.

648
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,041
A simple Indian girl on the inside.

649
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:38,886
I'm touched.

650
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:40,685
Here.

651
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:42,454
Cheers!

652
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,453
My heart was like...

653
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,620
...a dish antenna

654
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,856
The joys of a free channel...

655
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:23,093
...was a distant dream

656
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,224
My wires were entangled

657
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,427
Signals were weak

658
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,732
Haryana to me

659
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,797
Was stranger than Argentina

660
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:37,404
You gave my wavering heart
a brand new direction

661
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:44,042
In the silver screen of my eyes,
I see your reﬂection

662
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:48,516
Makes me wonder. You and I,
what a connection

663
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:54,924
Stung by bolts, 440 volts...
that's your feather touch

664
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,047
I'm up all night,
glued to my television

665
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:53,182
I learn love ballads just for you

666
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:57,048
Just you... only you

667
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,956
Tell me how and tell me what...

668
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:04,295
...do you think of me

669
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:08,867
Me. Just me, only me

670
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:18,212
You are my ration card,
you are my very ration

671
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:25,017
For your beauty, O princess,
I give sermon upon sermon

672
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:29,185
Makes me wonder. You and I,
what a connection

673
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:40,330
Stung by bolts, 440 volts...
that's your feather touch

674
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,187
Let me introduce you to my friends.

675
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:09,696
That guy in a blue denim shirt
is Govind.

676
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,932
That's Kukku. Gattu is behind
that beard.

677
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,600
Please sit.

678
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:18,564
What will you have, sister-in-law?

679
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,274
Chow mein and milkshake
are their specialties.

680
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:21,407
Let's order that.

681
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:22,472
Sister-in-law?

682
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,571
His girlfriend is our sister-in-law.

683
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,307
He's the first to have a girlfriend.
We're proud of him.

684
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,875
What the hell?

685
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,849
Told them I'm your girlfriend?

686
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:33,850
No.

687
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:35,849
Yes.

688
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,855
So what's wrong if I said it?

689
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,295
I'm leaving.

690
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:45,124
Aarfa! Wait, listen.

691
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:46,859
What are you doing?

692
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,926
You told them I'm your girlfriend?

693
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,806
Sorry, but if I did say it...

694
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,075
What's so wrong?

695
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:08,288
It's not just them. All the town
knows we have a thing going.

696
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,358
If you ride with me on
my bike all day...

697
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,758
holding me tight...

698
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:16,424
we do breakfast, lunches,
dinners, you joke with me.

699
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,630
We often touch. People see us
and wonder.

700
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:23,230
Is she actually his sister
or his girlfriend?

701
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,109
I'm a friend! That's it!

702
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:33,078
You know what? You won't
understand me. It's my fault.

703
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,813
Shouldn't be friends with
an illiterate like you.

704
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,115
What were you thinking?

705
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,353
You think I'd fall in love with you?

706
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,448
Look at you and look at me.

707
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,585
What have we in common?

708
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:45,352
I'm a state champion.

709
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,558
I have a dream, a goal, a purpose.

710
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,530
What are you? A clown...

711
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,563
who amuses everyone with his
dimwitted nonsense!

712
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,627
Who is worthy of love?

713
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:57,936
Someone you respect.

714
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:01,675
Someone who has something special
that you don't have.

715
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,439
You have no purpose in life.

716
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:05,940
Any ambitions?

717
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:08,538
Trying to woo girls.

718
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:10,182
Don't call me sister-in-law!

719
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,491
Sultan, you're back.

720
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:26,426
Come, eat.

721
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,772
What's wrong with him?

722
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,678
It's about a girl, isn't it?

723
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,344
Don't make this an excuse to reach
for alcohol and drugs.

724
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,952
No suicide stunts either.

725
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:20,380
I'm not a kid.

726
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,586
She's humiliated me.

727
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:29,258
Son, listen to me.

728
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,890
There's a woman behind
every successful man.

729
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,432
And there's a woman behind
every failure too.

730
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,907
But no one stands by a failure.

731
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:46,013
Sometimes it's necessary to be
humiliated to earn respect.

732
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,017
You need to work, Sultan.

733
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,251
Work very hard...

734
00:51:53,677 --> 00:51:56,055
then the world will respect you.

735
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,619
You're overweight, how will you
wrestle now?

736
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:08,496
Sir, is this the selection for
the state championship?

737
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:09,836
That's right.

738
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:12,369
I want to compete, please
fill in my form.

739
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:16,401
Are you out of your mind?
Is this a joke?

740
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,201
Pass me that file.

741
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:23,240
I am not kidding. I want to fight.

742
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,778
Please fill in my form.

743
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,714
It's what? 8 days since you joined?

744
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:29,852
You'll contest in the state
championship?

745
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:31,254
Yes.

746
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,891
Have you any idea how many years
of practice...

747
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,996
it takes for someone to reach
that level?

748
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:42,232
- Don't waste my time.
- Who's competing from your club?

749
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,630
Yaseen, Rakesh, Foga. Why?

750
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:50,010
If I pin them all down, will
you fill in my form?

751
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,538
You're nuts.

752
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:54,674
You're kidding?

753
00:52:57,607 --> 00:52:58,745
You'll pin them down?

754
00:52:59,209 --> 00:52:59,914
Yes.

755
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:01,282
When?

756
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:03,120
Right now, sir.

757
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,558
Stop it. Let go.

758
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:46,633
Satisfied now?

759
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:49,165
Do you want to get all your
bones crushed?

760
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,067
My father says that...

761
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:57,073
farmers and wrestlers have one
thing in common - their soil.

762
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:02,015
Today I fought to know my stature.

763
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,644
In a month I will fight on the
same soil again...

764
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,788
to raise my stature.

765
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:15,156
This state championship
belongs to Sultan.

766
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,552
When destiny opposes you

767
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,523
Then write your own destiny

768
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,268
Write your own destiny

769
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:28,994
Reach for the sky

770
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,966
Dive into the deepest ocean

771
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,265
Shout out loud

772
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,136
Stop him if you dare

773
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,070
Shackle him if you have the guts

774
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,749
Today he slays his fears right here

775
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,919
You are the son of the soil

776
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,289
Between the realms of
heaven and earth

777
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,357
Lingers your magnificent soul

778
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,054
O Sultan

779
00:56:12,335 --> 00:56:13,245
He slowed down.

780
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,779
Come, Sachin, your turn.

781
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,650
Sir, my friend Sultan.
I told you about him.

782
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:22,348
Take him in your club.
It'll really help.

783
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,491
This is good for puthhi tackle.

784
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,021
Very good, Sultan.

785
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,587
Once more, dhobi.

786
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:29,319
That's a dhobi tackle.

787
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,130
Look closely. Remember it.

788
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,509
Show me a saaltu tackle.

789
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,043
Great! Well done!

790
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,176
He lives within your soul

791
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:47,840
He watches over you

792
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:49,947
Again...

793
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,413
That tackle is worth 5 points.

794
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,676
A neck breaker.

795
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:59,691
It's time to be what you are, Sultan

796
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,592
Pull him down. Good!

797
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,799
That's how wrestlers fall at
your feet.

798
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,860
Reach for the sky

799
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,866
Dive into the deepest ocean

800
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,466
Shout out loud

801
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:18,776
You are the son of the soil

802
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,211
Between the realms of
heaven and earth

803
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:25,577
Lingers your magnificent soul,
O Sultan

804
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:28,788
Reach for the sky

805
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,989
Dive into the deepest ocean

806
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,587
Shout out loud

807
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,897
Stop him if you dare

808
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:38,632
Shackle him if you have the guts

809
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,667
Today he slays his fears right here

810
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:40,058
Sir, kindly fill in my form.
Remember I told you...

811
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:44,262
that the state championship
belongs to Sultan.

812
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:55,238
"State Championship, Faridabad.
2 months later."

813
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,237
The lioness of Buroli
has marched...

814
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:03,245
into her second straight
state championship finals.

815
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:04,550
Push her!

816
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,015
The way Aarfa is wrestling!

817
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,254
Her opponent Shanti Devi
seems clueless.

818
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,021
This girl has shown great promise.
She may well be...

819
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:15,853
an Olympic medal winner.

820
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:17,925
She's tiring. Make your move!

821
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,359
And she throws her down!

822
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:26,035
Haryana's lioness is now
a two-time state champion.

823
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,981
This is Sultan. He is up against
last year's champion Sangwaan.

824
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,911
A tough challenger.

825
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:45,984
He swings his arms around his
neck, he's going down!

826
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:47,491
Brilliant!

827
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:54,833
Sultan has him down for
the second time.

828
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,904
The unknown rookie Sultan...

829
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,842
has created terror in the arena.

830
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:08,640
Looks like his final move.

831
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:12,445
Yes! We have a new champion.

832
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:16,684
Sultan Ali Khan, the new
sensation of Haryana!

833
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,631
Master, he's done the unthinkable.

834
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,968
He's challenged a man twice
his weight.

835
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,228
The Wrestling Federation is
in a panic.

836
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,244
Have you lost your mind?

837
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,851
Do you know the consequences?

838
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,955
Only 3 months since you started...

839
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,022
now you'll challenge a man
twice your weight?

840
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:56,292
The Federation is in panic.

841
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,491
If you lose this bout, they will
blacklist you for life.

842
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,130
You'll become a laughing stock.

843
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,105
What's really going on?

844
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:09,809
What's really going on?

845
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:13,505
I doubt if I can explain. I doubt
you'll understand.

846
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:18,513
All I know is...

847
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:24,822
No one can defeat you unless
you defeat yourself.

848
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:28,354
Master, the federation officials
are asking for you.

849
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,667
Why so stubborn, Sultan?

850
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,736
You probably know...

851
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:45,635
I was in love with a girl.

852
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:51,951
But I could not express
myself properly.

853
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:57,750
She wondered how a clown
could ever be in love.

854
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,696
She hurt me deeply.

855
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,131
I was broken.

856
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:11,302
So this fight is neither
to win her back...

857
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:13,801
nor to defeat that wrestler.

858
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,242
This fight is with myself.

859
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,237
To define my stature.

860
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,812
No one has attempted this before.

861
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:26,016
Mr Shammi, what do you think
of this challenge?

862
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,514
Durgesh, I have a feeling...

863
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,449
Sultan will either make history
or become history himself.

864
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:46,767
Don't finish him off quickly.
He has challenged you.

865
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:50,845
Drag him more than hurt him.

866
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,865
Devrath clinches another 2 points.

867
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:58,677
One is a Dara Singh, and the
other a Dharmendra.

868
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:00,512
You have the upper hand.

869
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:03,113
Grab him and finish him off.
Understand?

870
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,459
Sultan, crush him!

871
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,133
Sultan, crush him!

872
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:32,669
Electrifying energy in the stands,
all cheering for Sultan.

873
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,473
Sultan, crush him!

874
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,494
Most wrestlers don't get up
after that move.

875
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:56,232
I told you, Durgesh. History
will be rewritten today.

876
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,697
It has been rewritten.

877
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:02,575
Mr Shammi, a star is born today.

878
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:26,697
Congrats!

879
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:28,057
Sorry, Sultan.

880
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:34,435
Sorry for what? Look around you.

881
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,339
Today Sultan is Sultan
because of you.

882
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:43,082
Will you marry me?

883
01:06:24,046 --> 01:06:27,493
Do you accept Sultan Ali Khan,
son of Mr Shareif, as your husband?

884
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:28,388
I accept.

885
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:33,999
Do you accept Aarfa, daughter
of Barkat Ali, as your wife?

886
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,928
- What shall I say, Grandma?
- Go on, say you accept.

887
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,103
Priest saab, I accept.

888
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,115
I'm no gossip

889
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,320
A bluff artist, not me

890
01:06:57,613 --> 01:06:59,320
For a few years now

891
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:01,456
I've been hooked on to you

892
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,858
You're my life, I swear it's true

893
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:11,199
I'm no gossip

894
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,701
Mincing words, not me

895
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:15,838
Sometimes I throw tantrums

896
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:17,973
But I'm good when I'm with you

897
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,213
You're my life, I swear it's true

898
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:28,482
Never uttered before

899
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:30,517
Words woven in love

900
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,085
Desires double each day

901
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:42,466
Is this my dream or
my heart's voice?

902
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:50,673
Say the words and my dreams
will take ﬂight

903
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:11,693
I'm no gossip

904
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:13,762
Mincing my words, not me

905
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,832
Sometimes I throw tantrums

906
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,967
But I'm good when I'm with you

907
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:23,207
You're my life, I swear it's true

908
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,305
How do you feel after
winning a medal?

909
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:32,218
I'd like to thank my father,
her father...

910
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,250
my coach, my grandma.

911
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:36,490
Sultan, he's asking how you feel?

912
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:42,156
Very happy, proud.
Long live Mother India!

913
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,256
Take me with you

914
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:48,030
To your castle in the air

915
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:52,066
I promise you, my love

916
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:56,141
I'll always walk by your side

917
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,614
Each morning

918
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,379
I'll wake you with a smile

919
01:09:06,342 --> 01:09:12,088
Each evening, you'll lure me
with whispers of love

920
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,894
I'm head over heels in love

921
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:19,990
I want to dance for joy

922
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:22,065
I say goodbye to reason

923
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:24,233
I turn into a child again

924
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,304
You're my life, I swear it's true

925
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,511
Never uttered before

926
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,515
Words woven in love

927
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:39,517
Desires double each day

928
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:48,488
Is this my dream or
my heart's voice

929
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:56,501
Say the words and my dreams
will take ﬂight

930
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,933
Today the Federation announces
the names of the wrestlers...

931
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:05,939
who have qualified for
2012 Olympics.

932
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,307
74 kg. Sultan.

933
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:10,648
55 kg. Aarfa.

934
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,894
Sweets to celebrate!

935
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,031
What?

936
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,295
My wife has collapsed and you
want sweets?

937
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,761
Which one?

938
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,039
Motichoor, besan or til?

939
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,572
You're going to be a father.

940
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:54,559
Sultan is going to be a father!

941
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,044
What have you done?

942
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:16,449
You should've been careful.

943
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:23,547
Years of work, your
lifelong dream...

944
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,115
amounts to nothing now.

945
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:29,287
Will you compete like this?

946
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,697
I won a gold, Dad.

947
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:35,230
See.

948
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:38,733
He's celebrating over there. Look.

949
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,704
He's my gold.

950
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:47,512
Just wait.

951
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:53,450
Your Barkat Wrestling Club will
win a gold medal.

952
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:58,657
He'll live your dream.

953
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,265
We'll train him together.

954
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:34,056
Why don't you eat? You've been
training so hard.

955
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,227
- No, you eat first.
- I ate.

956
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,862
You eat or I'll splash this
on you! Shall I?

957
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:41,427
Go for bagaldoop tackle.

958
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,636
Good... push him down.

959
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,104
Roll.

960
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:46,901
Good.

961
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:48,502
You're crazy. Have some water.

962
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:53,777
You must win an Olympic gold.

963
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:59,381
This match is between
Sultan Ali Khan from India...

964
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,314
and Aaron Levi from Greece.

965
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:09,853
I think the baby is about
to come out.

966
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:10,789
Hush!

967
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:12,997
Aaron makes another smart move.

968
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:15,734
Another 3 points. This looks
like the end.

969
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:17,502
- Sultan!
- Crush him!

970
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:24,540
Wow!

971
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,542
Sultan finishes this match in
one single move!

972
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:31,047
He has won by a fall.
This man is charismatic.

973
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:34,244
The Indian lion roars again.

974
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:38,021
- Sultan has...
- Crushed him!

975
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:04,849
Flair Writo meter, the longest
writing pen in the world.

976
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:06,843
Write your own destiny.

977
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:08,251
Cut. Got it.

978
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:11,715
Videocon d2h, an umbrella
of happiness.

979
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,095
The taste of life with Paras.

980
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,493
Cut. One more, please.

981
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:18,992
I'm a wrestler, not an actor.

982
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:20,431
I'm done, Mr Director.

983
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:23,461
The village head called.

984
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,638
Aren't you fighting at the
Haryana Sports Festival?

985
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:27,530
Sir, he's lost his mind.

986
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:30,640
He doesn't get it. Sultan
no longer fights in mud pits.

987
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:32,806
But we send a wrestler
from our club...

988
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,409
to the championship every year.

989
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,081
Send Pawan. He'll win.
It's his league.

990
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,213
Ladies and gentlemen.

991
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:46,492
Sultan Ali Khan has brought
fame to Rewari...

992
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,863
by winning an Olympic gold medal.

993
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:54,326
By virtue of that feat...

994
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:57,002
the government has announced
an honorary post for him...

995
01:14:57,326 --> 01:15:00,068
at the Waterworks Department.

996
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,838
I will now request Mr Sultan...

997
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:08,103
to unveil his statue at this
Sports College...

998
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:10,212
and honour his hometown.

999
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,916
Sultan, one photo.

1000
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:22,122
The wrestler pose!

1001
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:27,294
How does it feel winning
an Olympic medal?

1002
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,260
Better ask the medal.

1003
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:34,006
I haven't won the medal,
it has won me.

1004
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,706
No one has won this title
before you.

1005
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,808
There wasn't a Sultan
before me either.

1006
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:44,643
So what's next?

1007
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,952
Next week I leave for Turkey for
the World Championship.

1008
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:52,290
When I've won that, I'll be called
Sultan, King of the Ring.

1009
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:54,456
Can no one defeat you?

1010
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:58,354
Only one man can defeat Sultan...
Sultan himself.

1011
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,760
Confidence or arrogance?

1012
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:05,397
My success doesn't please you?

1013
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:10,706
I will answer you with the
World Champion title.

1014
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,837
Thank you. Let's go, sir.

1015
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:21,052
Mr Sultan, you seem annoyed
with me.

1016
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,651
I am a big fan. Photo, please?

1017
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:28,351
I think success has gone to
your head.

1018
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:33,428
Perhaps it has. But yours
will show on your face.

1019
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:40,000
At the Sports College press
conference today...

1020
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:41,501
popular wrestler Sultan...

1021
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:44,267
lost his temper and slapped
a journalist.

1022
01:16:44,733 --> 01:16:47,043
After winning Olympic gold, it
seems that success...

1023
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:49,009
has gone to his head.

1024
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:51,008
At the press meet...

1025
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:53,276
he answered questions rudely.

1026
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:55,746
What rubbish are you watching?

1027
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:57,882
Spoil my baby's mind.

1028
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,828
Come, let's have dinner.

1029
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:05,831
You know what the minister said...

1030
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:08,234
you are a gift to the state.

1031
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:12,334
They've made a 7-foot statue
of me at the Sports College.

1032
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:14,739
I look like a star.

1033
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:17,472
Sultan, my nine months are over.

1034
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:18,709
Really?

1035
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:23,245
So, what do you think?
A girl or a boy?

1036
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:25,748
Why?

1037
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,085
What do you want?

1038
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:29,580
Not want...

1039
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:31,753
I know it's a boy.

1040
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,454
I've thought of a name.

1041
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,555
With so much violence in the
world these days...

1042
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,794
I thought of calling him
Aman, peace.

1043
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:44,736
When he smiles, he'll make
everyone smile.

1044
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:45,835
Here, eat.

1045
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:52,176
But what's the doctor say?
When is it due?

1046
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:54,040
Anytime next week.

1047
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:55,178
Really?

1048
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:56,612
That's great.

1049
01:17:57,272 --> 01:18:01,345
We'll celebrate my World Champion
title and his birth.

1050
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:06,154
If I win, Haryana will be known
for its Sultan.

1051
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:10,886
Sultan, don't go.

1052
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,028
Where?

1053
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:14,161
World Championship.

1054
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:17,501
The doctor said it's anytime
next week.

1055
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:20,935
I need you here.

1056
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:22,330
Silly girl.

1057
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:26,677
The doctors don't know
this is Sultan's baby.

1058
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:29,374
You know that I have
a rare blood group.

1059
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:31,750
Our baby has a rare blood group.

1060
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,284
Remember how I won you over
through wrestling?

1061
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:38,351
Our child will come into the world,
strong like a wrestler.

1062
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:41,125
And when he is born...

1063
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,555
his father will be crowned
the World Champion.

1064
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:45,162
Sultan, wait.

1065
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:50,236
I'm glad you're following
your dream...

1066
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:54,340
But I fear you'll get far ahead
and leave us behind.

1067
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:59,307
I too had a dream of winning
Olympic gold...

1068
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:03,775
but I sacrificed that dream
for our happiness.

1069
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:09,089
There's a thin line between
pride and arrogance.

1070
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:13,552
I wanted you to earn respect...

1071
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:15,722
but you're on an ego trip.

1072
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:19,155
Now you're talking like
the rest of them.

1073
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:25,362
When I was a nobody...

1074
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,403
even you deserted me.

1075
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,206
I've struggled hard for my success.

1076
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:39,384
And you're with me because of it.

1077
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:42,511
And this thing you talk about...

1078
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:45,052
What do they call it in English?

1079
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:46,988
Arrogance?

1080
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:50,921
It's self-confidence.

1081
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,958
Now I'm done.

1082
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:06,909
Very good, Sultan! Grab his neck.

1083
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,274
Go for it!

1084
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,428
Get a good grip.

1085
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,971
Go for a dhobi tackle.

1086
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:43,942
Vijender?

1087
01:21:06,161 --> 01:21:08,368
And here comes the suplex!

1088
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,765
The famous Sultan slam!

1089
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,237
Reza down on the ground!

1090
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:19,416
Sultan Ali Khan from India is the
new World Wrestling Champion!

1091
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:21,845
The king of the ring!

1092
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,468
So, a boy or a girl?

1093
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:39,634
- It's a boy!
- I knew it.

1094
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:40,869
Come soon.

1095
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:42,271
It's a boy!

1096
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:43,675
Congratulations, Sultan.

1097
01:21:57,312 --> 01:21:59,622
Wow! Where is she?

1098
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:04,829
Aarfa?

1099
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:11,929
Congratulations!

1100
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:14,970
World Champion Sultan.

1101
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:19,403
King of the Ring, finally!

1102
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:26,509
You're a rare breed, right?

1103
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:29,645
Your son was no different.

1104
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,850
Seriously, he wasn't.

1105
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:38,958
He had the same blood group
as you. O-negative.

1106
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:43,165
But sadly, he was not
as strong as you.

1107
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,503
He did not have enough blood.

1108
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:49,136
But he had great courage.

1109
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:51,934
He fought for 18 hours.

1110
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,574
We asked all the villagers.

1111
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:00,177
But couldn't find his blood type.

1112
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,516
By the time Govind got to Rewari...

1113
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,786
your Aman who fought for his life...

1114
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:14,766
lost and left us.

1115
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,366
You went chasing your dream...

1116
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:27,611
and left us far behind.

1117
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:31,911
You won, Sultan.

1118
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:34,886
We lost.

1119
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:43,557
That departed soul has driven
a wedge between us...

1120
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,695
that I can never overcome.

1121
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:51,160
Go away, Sultan.

1122
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:56,103
And if possible never show
your face to me again.

1123
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:29,397
"Aman Blood Bank."

1124
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:11,137
I didn't talk to him for 6 months.

1125
01:26:11,699 --> 01:26:14,475
If I saw him coming down
the street, I'd vanish.

1126
01:26:14,936 --> 01:26:17,746
When I heard about his grandma,
I went to see him.

1127
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:19,913
He wept like a baby.

1128
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:24,557
His father died soon after.

1129
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,618
He is very lonely.

1130
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:29,760
And Aarfa?

1131
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:33,932
She lives with her father and
looks after the wrestling club.

1132
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,266
She hasn't spoken to Sultan
in years.

1133
01:26:36,758 --> 01:26:39,830
Every day he sits by the shrine
in the hope...

1134
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,675
that one day, she'd pass by
and feel sorry for him.

1135
01:26:42,964 --> 01:26:44,841
Maybe even forgive him.

1136
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,976
But she walks passed him
as a stranger would.

1137
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:51,147
What will Sultan do now?

1138
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:52,543
What can he do?

1139
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:55,345
When he was wrestling,
he fought inside the ring.

1140
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:57,020
Now he fights outside it.

1141
01:26:58,446 --> 01:26:59,550
He has only one desire...

1142
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:02,284
to somehow open a blood bank
in the village.

1143
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,494
To prevent the tragedy that
befell him.

1144
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:09,728
He knows that Aarfa will never
forgive him.

1145
01:27:10,491 --> 01:27:14,029
He wants to make it happen.
So maybe he'll forgive himself.

1146
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:16,771
He's saved money for years.

1147
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,879
Mr Aakash, you seem a good man.

1148
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:26,610
So I'll tell you something.

1149
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:31,046
Your offer is very good,
but he's a simple man.

1150
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:34,590
You can offer him a deal,
but he may not agree.

1151
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,196
But touch his heart...

1152
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:40,326
he'd climb the Himalayan
mountains for you.

1153
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:45,164
Thank you very much.

1154
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:51,876
Dad, I want to go to the market.

1155
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,646
Bittu, the shops would have shut.

1156
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,546
Get ready then. We'll go.

1157
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,481
Mr Sultan, how are you?

1158
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:02,283
- Did you have tea?
- Yes.

1159
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:03,419
Sit.

1160
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:05,722
What can I do for you?

1161
01:28:06,014 --> 01:28:08,153
The permit for the blood bank.

1162
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:10,324
Your job will be done.

1163
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:13,165
Your file has gone to the Ministry.

1164
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:15,159
It takes time.

1165
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:18,260
You've said that for years,
Minister.

1166
01:28:19,093 --> 01:28:20,629
I've won glory for the country...

1167
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,539
made our state famous.

1168
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:24,601
Can't the government do this
much for me?

1169
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:26,606
Dad, I'm ready, when will we go?

1170
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:29,909
Got it. Come out.

1171
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:31,649
We'll go in 2 minutes.

1172
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:35,812
Sultan, why are you hell-bent
on embarrassing me?

1173
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:38,351
Please be patient, your job
will be done.

1174
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,523
Stay in touch. Jai Hind.

1175
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:42,527
Let's leave.

1176
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:52,236
Sultan, please listen to me.

1177
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:57,532
Did you get the permission?

1178
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,368
Want me to hit you?

1179
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,644
I know why you stopped wrestling.

1180
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:06,613
Anyone in your shoes would've
done the same.

1181
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,182
How much have you saved?

1182
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:12,920
235,000

1183
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:15,023
Even a lifetime of savings...

1184
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:17,156
won't build you four walls.

1185
01:29:17,552 --> 01:29:20,431
My Dad told me that Sultan was
born to be a wrestler.

1186
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:24,325
I'm a businessman. I came
to make a deal with you.

1187
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:27,104
But hearing your story, I believe
you belong in that ring.

1188
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:32,835
Wrestling took everything from you,
maybe it can bring it all back.

1189
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:35,873
You wrestle with life everyday.

1190
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:38,678
So wrestle where it matters.

1191
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,446
My card.

1192
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:51,260
Call me.

1193
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:54,759
Well done, Prem.

1194
01:29:55,356 --> 01:29:57,427
Tackle him! Come on.

1195
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:01,230
Get up! Well done, Prem.

1196
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:03,907
Pull him! Get up, Prem.

1197
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:08,175
You are the son of the soil

1198
01:30:16,944 --> 01:30:18,946
Between the realms of
heaven and earth

1199
01:30:19,313 --> 01:30:20,951
Lingers your magnificent soul

1200
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,393
O Sultan

1201
01:30:27,955 --> 01:30:29,195
How much have you collected?

1202
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:36,007
My Dad told me that Sultan was
born to be a wrestler.

1203
01:30:36,464 --> 01:30:39,035
Wrestling took everything from you,
maybe it can bring it all back.

1204
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:29,857
My sins are terrible.

1205
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:34,128
I know you'll never forgive me.

1206
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:39,905
In spite of that, I believe that
you still...

1207
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:46,109
love me.

1208
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,081
Wrestling made me.

1209
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:54,779
And broke me.

1210
01:31:56,477 --> 01:31:57,285
Listen.

1211
01:31:58,045 --> 01:32:02,152
A wrestler's true worth is not in
the ring, but in the game of life.

1212
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:06,161
When it pulls you down...

1213
01:32:07,922 --> 01:32:09,026
you rise again...

1214
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:15,607
against all odds and face life
and win it back.

1215
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,145
That's all I have to say.

1216
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:25,450
I'm returning to the place...

1217
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:27,585
where we...

1218
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:32,150
lost everything.

1219
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:37,055
But this time, I'm fighting for
my respect.

1220
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:41,828
Yours, mine...

1221
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:46,531
and the little one we lost.

1222
01:32:49,597 --> 01:32:50,701
Take care of yourself.

1223
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:55,274
And if possible...

1224
01:32:58,306 --> 01:33:00,047
tie a string for me too.

1225
01:33:02,977 --> 01:33:04,684
If you don't see me again...

1226
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:08,559
forgive my mistakes.

1227
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:16,763
Our love may be incomplete

1228
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:19,197
But my heart is free of remorse

1229
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,665
Do we have the world or
has it ended?

1230
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:24,239
What's left of it still lives in hope

1231
01:33:29,003 --> 01:33:31,449
That hope never leaves my side

1232
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:34,044
It lingers at Your threshold

1233
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,582
For the one whose ﬂight is
unending

1234
01:33:36,877 --> 01:33:39,824
Like a bird, my heart still
yearns to ﬂy

1235
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:43,823
If You forgave me

1236
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:46,028
I would be freed

1237
01:33:51,559 --> 01:33:55,507
Bid me and I will surrender to You,
O Bulleh Shah.

1238
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:02,009
I lose myself in a trance to
seek the one I love

1239
01:34:02,336 --> 01:34:05,510
I follow your path, O Bulleh Shah

1240
01:34:08,075 --> 01:34:11,921
I lose myself in a trance to
seek the one I love

1241
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:15,456
Without thought of myself,
O Bulleh Shah

1242
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:22,591
You are my breath, my only strength

1243
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:32,106
You may or may not think of me

1244
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:37,138
But You are in every part of me

1245
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:41,814
I cherish Your anger

1246
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:46,856
Your secrets are the reason
for my defeat

1247
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:50,151
Bro, take care of yourself.

1248
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:53,688
Hey wrestler.

1249
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:56,933
Go, crush them.

1250
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:02,205
Bid me and I will surrender to You,
O Bulleh Shah

1251
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:38,275
Sir, there's someone to see you.

1252
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:40,837
Happy to see you.

1253
01:35:41,469 --> 01:35:42,846
That was quick?

1254
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:44,807
My grandma would say...

1255
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:49,449
A deal that feels right must
be sealed at once.

1256
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:51,752
That's wonderful. Welcome.

1257
01:36:06,393 --> 01:36:07,201
He'll fight?

1258
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:09,306
Where did you find him, Aakash?

1259
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:11,534
- He won an Olympic gold.
- He's out of shape.

1260
01:36:11,866 --> 01:36:13,368
- Former World Wrestling Champ.
- With a paunch!

1261
01:36:13,634 --> 01:36:14,942
You nuts?

1262
01:36:15,169 --> 01:36:17,649
OK, he was a World Champ,
but how long ago?

1263
01:36:18,005 --> 01:36:19,985
If Kapil Dev bowled in
T20 cricket...

1264
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:21,377
what would happen?

1265
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:23,212
It's a young man's sport, Aakash.

1266
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:25,181
These wrestlers are under 24.

1267
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,353
And you find a run-down 40 plus
local wrestler?

1268
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:32,454
This is not mud pit wrestling,
but a free style sport.

1269
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:34,958
- You're right.
- Listen to me.

1270
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:39,099
The speed, the technique, the format,
it's so different. Can he adapt?

1271
01:36:39,426 --> 01:36:40,996
Mr Patel, you're right.

1272
01:36:41,328 --> 01:36:42,329
But he will fight.

1273
01:36:42,596 --> 01:36:44,473
We have 3 months. We'll train him.

1274
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:49,078
What about a sponsor?

1275
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:53,648
You know we don't let a wrestler
in the ring without a sponsor.

1276
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:57,512
Just look at him. Who would
ever sponsor him?

1277
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:02,961
Do you see how fit they are?

1278
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:05,228
Very fit, Allah's kind.

1279
01:37:05,786 --> 01:37:08,289
Even I had a physique like
this once.

1280
01:37:09,557 --> 01:37:10,399
Had?

1281
01:37:12,359 --> 01:37:14,032
You should tuck your tummy in.

1282
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:19,768
We are being watched from above.

1283
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:22,036
CCTV?

1284
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:27,810
Come. Let's find you a sponsor.

1285
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:34,856
John W Henry, owner of
Liverpool Football Club.

1286
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:37,259
Shah Rukh Khan,
Kolkata Knight Riders.

1287
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:39,129
Preity Zinta.

1288
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,059
And your buddy, the
Pro Take-Down owner.

1289
01:37:42,423 --> 01:37:43,959
You're a big shot now.

1290
01:37:44,625 --> 01:37:46,969
Remember how we would eat
street food on these lanes?

1291
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:49,363
I hear Pro Take-Down didn't
work in India.

1292
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:52,574
You had really bad press.
Are you shutting shop?

1293
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:54,273
That's why I'm here.

1294
01:37:54,568 --> 01:37:57,549
This time I am getting my
wrestler in the ring.

1295
01:37:58,038 --> 01:37:59,984
I'm sorry, but I can't fight.

1296
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:02,514
Who asked you to fight?
He'll fight, Sultan.

1297
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:05,654
Kukreja Pressure cookers
must sponsor us.

1298
01:38:06,413 --> 01:38:07,414
Sponsor you?

1299
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:09,453
You know my Dad?

1300
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:13,562
The biggest miser in the world!

1301
01:38:14,188 --> 01:38:15,997
He is glued to his money.

1302
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:19,131
Sponsor you? Impossible!

1303
01:38:20,194 --> 01:38:23,403
How long will you think like
a small-time shopkeeper?

1304
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:25,075
Think big.

1305
01:38:25,466 --> 01:38:28,845
Who has heard of that pressure
cooker beyond Lajpat Nagar?

1306
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:31,883
Just think. Your logo on
Sultan's jersey.

1307
01:38:32,406 --> 01:38:33,544
The world will see it.

1308
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:35,184
Free advertising.

1309
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:36,782
You'll go far.

1310
01:38:38,412 --> 01:38:39,584
You'll feature in this magazine.

1311
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:50,962
Sultan, get into shape.
You look weak.

1312
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:54,363
Tell you what. Take my cooker,
boil your chicken.

1313
01:38:54,728 --> 01:38:55,900
It's delicious.

1314
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:00,109
- Done deal?
- Done, man!

1315
01:39:00,501 --> 01:39:01,809
- Love you, bro!
- Love you too.

1316
01:39:17,818 --> 01:39:18,922
What's this?

1317
01:39:20,387 --> 01:39:21,832
That's what you'll learn.

1318
01:39:22,156 --> 01:39:24,659
You crazy?

1319
01:39:25,926 --> 01:39:28,133
All I know is Indian wrestling...

1320
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,332
fought in mud pits.

1321
01:39:30,998 --> 01:39:32,739
This is a whole new sport.

1322
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:36,773
It has judo, boxing, karate,
punches, kicks, slaps.

1323
01:39:37,705 --> 01:39:38,581
Everything!

1324
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:40,410
What were you thinking?

1325
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:42,854
Earning 1 million a fight is
no cakewalk.

1326
01:39:43,177 --> 01:39:46,021
Listen to me. I want to earn money...

1327
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:48,524
but I am no Superman.

1328
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,426
You cannot learn this in six weeks.

1329
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:53,798
No one can.

1330
01:39:54,188 --> 01:39:55,667
- Sure, you can.
- How?

1331
01:39:56,023 --> 01:39:57,468
What's the most important thing
in wrestling?

1332
01:39:57,725 --> 01:39:58,430
Tackles.

1333
01:39:58,659 --> 01:39:59,899
- You know tackles.
- Did.

1334
01:40:00,127 --> 01:40:01,868
- How many weeks do you need?
- Six.

1335
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:04,070
That's it! Let's train.

1336
01:40:05,566 --> 01:40:06,135
Come on!

1337
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:07,936
Bloody businessman!

1338
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:09,140
Let's go.

1339
01:40:14,041 --> 01:40:15,042
Old Delhi.

1340
01:40:16,043 --> 01:40:17,021
The real Delhi.

1341
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:22,620
What you can't find anywhere,
you'll find here.

1342
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:32,027
There's a 25-year old institute
of martial arts here.

1343
01:40:32,726 --> 01:40:35,832
It has produced sportsmen
who have represented India.

1344
01:40:38,799 --> 01:40:41,439
A boy left for London from
here 8 years ago...

1345
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:45,716
and became a legend that
no one could match.

1346
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,748
So many locks?

1347
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:50,286
What treasure is he hiding?

1348
01:41:00,187 --> 01:41:03,134
He was once the best fighter at
London Underground wrestling.

1349
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:05,795
But they accused him of doping.

1350
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,962
He never got out of that mess.

1351
01:41:10,497 --> 01:41:11,601
He got deported.

1352
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:13,370
And returned to Old Delhi.

1353
01:41:14,435 --> 01:41:16,437
To the same place where it
all began.

1354
01:41:17,137 --> 01:41:18,241
He gave up fighting.

1355
01:41:18,839 --> 01:41:20,443
But it didn't give up on him.

1356
01:41:21,275 --> 01:41:24,779
Now he trains others to become
the best athletes.

1357
01:41:25,345 --> 01:41:26,949
Because he knows he is the best.

1358
01:41:27,381 --> 01:41:29,156
He's Fateh Singh.

1359
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:39,170
Olympic medalist.

1360
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:42,872
World Champion.

1361
01:41:43,997 --> 01:41:45,169
His child died.

1362
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:47,837
His wife left him.

1363
01:41:51,338 --> 01:41:52,646
Sad story.

1364
01:41:58,846 --> 01:42:01,053
Want me to cry?

1365
01:42:06,753 --> 01:42:07,857
I can't train him.

1366
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:09,963
Fateh, please. He's the best
we've got.

1367
01:42:12,926 --> 01:42:13,597
The best?

1368
01:42:16,363 --> 01:42:17,842
Just look at him.

1369
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:22,245
He is a tired, worn out loser.

1370
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:27,379
Someone who has buried
himself in grief.

1371
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:29,177
Killed himself.

1372
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:33,383
I don't train dead people.

1373
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:37,193
Trust me! Just train him.
I am confident.

1374
01:42:38,418 --> 01:42:39,795
Confident or over confident?

1375
01:42:51,598 --> 01:42:53,407
I'll give it a shot, just for you.

1376
01:42:57,838 --> 01:42:59,613
Show me what you've got.

1377
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:03,684
Tomorrow morning, 10am.

1378
01:43:11,885 --> 01:43:13,887
Sultan, dead person.

1379
01:43:18,058 --> 01:43:21,870
Sultan. Olympic gold medalist.

1380
01:43:26,934 --> 01:43:28,208
World champion.

1381
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:31,140
Dead person.

1382
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:03,697
Did he cry all night?

1383
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:38,004
You're wasting your time.

1384
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:40,377
He's down and out.

1385
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:46,216
He'll get killed in that ring.

1386
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,841
I gave up wrestling...

1387
01:46:19,773 --> 01:46:21,343
but I never gave up fighting.

1388
01:46:23,043 --> 01:46:23,987
I am alive.

1389
01:46:28,782 --> 01:46:29,988
What do they say in English?

1390
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:32,157
Alive and kicking!

1391
01:46:34,454 --> 01:46:35,159
OK?

1392
01:46:39,593 --> 01:46:40,367
Master.

1393
01:46:48,535 --> 01:46:50,310
- Isn't he a Jat?
- Hardcore.

1394
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:54,984
Let's do it.

1395
01:47:02,716 --> 01:47:03,592
Come on!

1396
01:47:03,884 --> 01:47:04,760
Is that it?

1397
01:47:05,685 --> 01:47:06,288
Come on!

1398
01:47:09,489 --> 01:47:10,399
What?

1399
01:47:10,891 --> 01:47:12,700
Is that all you've got?

1400
01:47:21,701 --> 01:47:23,442
You're rusted like these old cars.

1401
01:47:24,404 --> 01:47:26,406
Only the shell is left.
The engine's gone.

1402
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:28,013
You're a wrestler, right?

1403
01:47:28,608 --> 01:47:30,815
Your strength is in your lower body.

1404
01:47:32,045 --> 01:47:32,750
Put it down.

1405
01:47:33,313 --> 01:47:35,589
This sport is a chutney of all
martial arts.

1406
01:47:36,116 --> 01:47:39,859
In your wrestling technique,
let's begin by fighting low.

1407
01:47:41,822 --> 01:47:44,769
No movement, use your core
strength. Balance.

1408
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:47,033
It's better if your weight
is immobile.

1409
01:47:47,727 --> 01:47:48,603
Come on, push!

1410
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:50,940
What happened, Mr Champion?

1411
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:53,444
You'll start all over.

1412
01:47:57,804 --> 01:47:58,874
Come on, pull!

1413
01:48:00,407 --> 01:48:01,010
Come on!

1414
01:48:05,078 --> 01:48:06,989
What are you staring at?
Want to hit me?

1415
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:09,961
They'll hit you harder in the ring.

1416
01:48:10,517 --> 01:48:11,689
If you want to beat them...

1417
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:14,788
then you must become
an indestructible bull.

1418
01:48:15,422 --> 01:48:17,402
An unbreakable bull!

1419
01:48:18,024 --> 01:48:20,766
You may get hit 10 times,
but you'll hit only once.

1420
01:48:21,294 --> 01:48:23,797
That one blow should have
the power of ten.

1421
01:48:26,233 --> 01:48:27,177
Move.

1422
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:29,743
It won't work.

1423
01:48:30,237 --> 01:48:32,979
Get faster or you won't survive
a single round.

1424
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:36,953
Govind.

1425
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:39,957
Why waste my time?

1426
01:48:40,447 --> 01:48:41,619
Not a waste.

1427
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:44,428
A loose kite gives energy
to the man like lightning.

1428
01:48:44,918 --> 01:48:46,420
He'll outrun a speeding train.

1429
01:48:46,753 --> 01:48:47,629
Idiots!

1430
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:51,065
He has a fiery temperament.

1431
01:48:54,594 --> 01:48:55,732
Pull!

1432
01:48:56,263 --> 01:48:57,765
There, it's loose.

1433
01:48:59,633 --> 01:49:00,941
There, behind the shrine.

1434
01:49:02,602 --> 01:49:03,376
A kite.

1435
01:49:04,004 --> 01:49:05,312
Now watch the spectacle.

1436
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:07,241
Reach for the sky

1437
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:09,214
Dive into the deepest ocean

1438
01:49:09,476 --> 01:49:11,979
Shout out loud

1439
01:49:13,847 --> 01:49:15,190
Stop him if you dare

1440
01:49:15,482 --> 01:49:17,223
Shackle him if you have the guts

1441
01:49:17,551 --> 01:49:19,724
Today he slays his fears right here

1442
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:27,397
You must figure out the opponent's
fight style.

1443
01:49:28,028 --> 01:49:31,976
Store it in your mind's hard disk.

1444
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:35,710
Marcus, the deadliest fighter of
the championship.

1445
01:49:36,803 --> 01:49:38,544
Pray that you don't see him
in the ring.

1446
01:49:40,273 --> 01:49:45,586
There's a saying, "Don't take
a ﬂying arrow in your buttock."

1447
01:49:47,581 --> 01:49:49,458
- Taken.
- Then get up!

1448
01:49:54,120 --> 01:49:55,963
Use your back foot strength.

1449
01:49:57,424 --> 01:49:59,461
Elbow, knee, punch!

1450
01:50:01,528 --> 01:50:04,600
Fire, water, wind is
what you are within

1451
01:50:05,498 --> 01:50:08,570
You burn, you earn,
with courage on the chin

1452
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:10,972
You are a mountain

1453
01:50:11,438 --> 01:50:13,179
And its very grain

1454
01:50:13,506 --> 01:50:17,181
You choose what you want to be

1455
01:50:17,477 --> 01:50:19,218
Tears and sweat

1456
01:50:19,479 --> 01:50:21,117
Are only water

1457
01:50:21,514 --> 01:50:24,290
But have the power to repel
the storm

1458
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:34,397
Shit!

1459
01:50:36,162 --> 01:50:37,106
Just missed!

1460
01:50:39,165 --> 01:50:40,803
The deadliest trick of the sport:

1461
01:50:41,067 --> 01:50:42,569
choke and lock.

1462
01:50:43,136 --> 01:50:46,015
You can improve your capacity.
We'll train you.

1463
01:50:46,606 --> 01:50:48,085
But... tap out, guys.

1464
01:50:48,408 --> 01:50:51,321
If you can't take it, then tap out.
Submission, over!

1465
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:52,020
OK?

1466
01:50:54,214 --> 01:50:55,056
Breathe.

1467
01:51:05,291 --> 01:51:06,861
Good lung capacity?

1468
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:13,136
He's passed out. He doesn't
give up easily.

1469
01:51:13,433 --> 01:51:14,605
Get water!

1470
01:51:15,268 --> 01:51:16,576
He's ready to die.

1471
01:51:24,577 --> 01:51:26,147
Sultan, slip, duck!

1472
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:10,663
You are the son of the soil

1473
01:52:20,934 --> 01:52:22,572
Between the realms of
heaven and earth

1474
01:52:23,203 --> 01:52:24,944
Lingers your magnificent soul

1475
01:52:27,073 --> 01:52:28,381
O Sultan

1476
01:52:32,812 --> 01:52:34,052
That's my boy!

1477
01:52:38,151 --> 01:52:39,687
That's it!

1478
01:52:40,453 --> 01:52:42,831
Abhiraj, National Judo Champion.

1479
01:52:45,692 --> 01:52:49,162
Sawinder Singh, International
boxing champion.

1480
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:54,739
Francis, International
Taekwondo gold medalist.

1481
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:01,017
All from this club.

1482
01:53:03,176 --> 01:53:06,350
Here, put a lock with your name.

1483
01:53:11,785 --> 01:53:15,062
Sultan, everyone thinks that
a hero is someone who wins...

1484
01:53:17,524 --> 01:53:21,973
but I believe a real hero is
one who loses.

1485
01:53:25,298 --> 01:53:28,438
Because he alone knows
the value of victory.

1486
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:36,545
I see a bit of myself in you,
Sultan.

1487
01:53:37,877 --> 01:53:40,790
You too have lost the most
precious thing in your life...

1488
01:53:43,082 --> 01:53:44,026
your family.

1489
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:52,163
I've trained you to fight athletes...

1490
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:56,641
but your fight is bigger than
this championship.

1491
01:53:59,299 --> 01:54:01,745
Because you'll fight yourself,
Sultan.

1492
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:06,540
Don't let yourself down.

1493
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:11,352
I'm sorry. I won't be there
with you...

1494
01:54:14,113 --> 01:54:18,493
because I know you'll die in that
ring, but you won't accept defeat.

1495
01:54:22,488 --> 01:54:23,694
I cannot bear to see that.

1496
01:54:34,601 --> 01:54:36,603
Don't give my gym a bad name.

1497
01:54:46,646 --> 01:54:49,320
Hi, this is Shibani reporting
live for Aaj Tak News...

1498
01:54:49,549 --> 01:54:51,460
from the National Stadium, New Delhi.

1499
01:54:51,985 --> 01:54:55,262
The hot topic for today is the
third season of Pro Take-Down.

1500
01:54:55,822 --> 01:54:59,167
The last two seasons were
a washout for investors.

1501
01:54:59,425 --> 01:55:02,770
This season will decide the
future of this sport in India.

1502
01:55:03,696 --> 01:55:06,700
The 3rd season starts in two days.

1503
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:09,137
There's great excitement.

1504
01:55:09,602 --> 01:55:12,378
You can see Tyron Woodley behind me.

1505
01:55:12,672 --> 01:55:16,210
The American owned by the
Chinese tycoon Joseph Ma.

1506
01:55:16,476 --> 01:55:19,514
And here comes the defending
champion of Pro Take-Down.

1507
01:55:19,779 --> 01:55:23,420
Marcus from Britain, owned by
British businessman James Caulfield.

1508
01:55:23,716 --> 01:55:26,697
Behind him is the capoeira
fighting machine Marrese.

1509
01:55:26,986 --> 01:55:31,935
Brazilian Marrese is owned by the
Russian tycoon Victor Galitski.

1510
01:55:32,525 --> 01:55:34,436
And the special attraction
of the season...

1511
01:55:34,894 --> 01:55:37,374
is franchise owner Aakash Singh's
decision to field...

1512
01:55:37,597 --> 01:55:40,771
his own wrestler in this championship.

1513
01:55:41,134 --> 01:55:45,344
What makes this more exciting is
that his wrestler is an Indian!

1514
01:55:45,738 --> 01:55:49,948
He will be the first Indian to
battle inside that ring.

1515
01:55:50,410 --> 01:55:53,118
And the name of the wrestler
is... Sultan.

1516
01:55:53,413 --> 01:55:56,519
An Olympic gold medalist and
a World Wrestling Champion.

1517
01:55:56,816 --> 01:55:57,988
This is a first.

1518
01:56:02,722 --> 01:56:06,101
It's the first time that the
Championship belt and fighters...

1519
01:56:06,392 --> 01:56:08,736
are being showcased in such
a big way.

1520
01:56:09,095 --> 01:56:11,974
As we can see, none of these
fighters are holding back...

1521
01:56:12,298 --> 01:56:15,939
as they gear up for what will be
an incredibly fierce competition.

1522
01:56:22,775 --> 01:56:24,482
Hello, everyone. My name
is Meiyang Chang.

1523
01:56:24,711 --> 01:56:26,190
And I am Kubra Sait.

1524
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:29,222
We welcome you to the press
conference of the first fight.

1525
01:56:29,515 --> 01:56:32,621
Right here at the third season of
Force Motors Pro Take-Down.

1526
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:34,154
Thank you, Kubra.

1527
01:56:34,487 --> 01:56:37,331
Without wasting time, I'll open
the house for questions.

1528
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:39,226
Aakash, why did it take 3 years...

1529
01:56:39,492 --> 01:56:41,494
to ask an Indian wrestler
to contest?

1530
01:56:41,794 --> 01:56:42,898
I made a mistake.

1531
01:56:44,197 --> 01:56:47,701
My father told me that India
is its soil...

1532
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:50,374
and when I looked at this soil,
I found Sultan.

1533
01:56:50,903 --> 01:56:52,541
Our very own son of the soil.

1534
01:56:53,139 --> 01:56:54,846
I think he's the best.

1535
01:56:55,241 --> 01:56:56,242
Let the madness begin.

1536
01:56:56,509 --> 01:56:58,921
Sultan, where were you all
these years?

1537
01:56:59,178 --> 01:57:02,057
Why did you stop after winning the
World Champion title?

1538
01:57:02,515 --> 01:57:04,722
I had problems.

1539
01:57:06,452 --> 01:57:07,726
Personal family problems.

1540
01:57:08,087 --> 01:57:09,566
What do you say in English?

1541
01:57:10,923 --> 01:57:13,164
Family problem.

1542
01:57:14,193 --> 01:57:17,936
We've heard your wife doesn't live
with you. Are you divorced?

1543
01:57:18,197 --> 01:57:19,608
No personal questions.

1544
01:57:23,536 --> 01:57:24,981
For us, there's no divorce.

1545
01:57:25,571 --> 01:57:27,710
We fight, we argue.

1546
01:57:28,708 --> 01:57:32,212
The more we love, the more we fight.

1547
01:57:32,879 --> 01:57:34,381
Don't you quarrel with your wife?

1548
01:57:36,482 --> 01:57:41,556
I believe that wives are born
to get into fights.

1549
01:57:41,954 --> 01:57:43,092
They're born fighters.

1550
01:57:43,322 --> 01:57:45,598
And your wife is a wrestler, right?

1551
01:57:47,326 --> 01:57:49,067
That's why she's hotheaded.

1552
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:56,373
You are the media, you are
very powerful.

1553
01:57:56,903 --> 01:57:58,405
You slammed me the last time.

1554
01:57:58,905 --> 01:58:00,248
Why don't you try and persuade her?

1555
01:58:00,473 --> 01:58:01,884
Maybe she'd listen to you.

1556
01:58:06,379 --> 01:58:08,188
So you think you can win this
championship?

1557
01:58:08,448 --> 01:58:09,552
- I don't know
- No!

1558
01:58:10,383 --> 01:58:11,384
Not a chance.

1559
01:58:11,851 --> 01:58:14,161
Because tomorrow, it's you and me.

1560
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:17,997
I'm gonna break every single bone
in your body.

1561
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:22,096
I'll pack it up and send it
to your wife.

1562
01:58:27,533 --> 01:58:28,773
He seems miffed.

1563
01:58:31,337 --> 01:58:33,840
Would you like to answer him
in English?

1564
01:58:42,548 --> 01:58:44,357
I'll answer question in ring.

1565
01:58:45,084 --> 01:58:45,824
See you.

1566
01:58:46,519 --> 01:58:49,090
Sultan! The name on everyone's lips.

1567
01:58:49,422 --> 01:58:52,960
He spoke openly today about
his wife.

1568
01:58:53,593 --> 01:58:55,163
It has been so long, Aarfa.

1569
01:58:55,995 --> 01:58:58,236
Even God forgives one mistake.

1570
01:59:03,703 --> 01:59:07,446
We hear your wife doesn't live
with you. Are you divorced?

1571
01:59:38,404 --> 01:59:39,781
I'm recording a video.

1572
01:59:43,342 --> 01:59:45,822
Say yes... Aarfa's pranks?

1573
01:59:46,179 --> 01:59:47,089
I accept.

1574
01:59:47,346 --> 01:59:49,121
Aarfa's youth?

1575
01:59:51,384 --> 01:59:52,192
I accept.

1576
01:59:52,451 --> 01:59:53,589
Aarfa's fury?

1577
01:59:55,955 --> 01:59:57,025
I accept.

1578
01:59:58,124 --> 01:59:59,967
Aarfa's old age?

1579
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,637
See this great state champion...

1580
02:00:09,969 --> 02:00:12,176
who dozed off on his wedding night?

1581
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:15,710
Loser.

1582
02:00:24,150 --> 02:00:25,424
So here we are...

1583
02:00:25,785 --> 02:00:27,526
the day we've all been waiting for.

1584
02:00:27,787 --> 02:00:30,768
The opening match of
Pro Take-Down wrestling.

1585
02:00:31,023 --> 02:00:34,197
24 fighters will fight it out
over 25 days...

1586
02:00:34,427 --> 02:00:36,634
where every match is a knock out.

1587
02:00:36,929 --> 02:00:39,671
And the champion will walk
away with 50 million.

1588
02:00:39,966 --> 02:00:42,572
Where the last two seasons have
failed miserably.

1589
02:00:42,802 --> 02:00:45,282
But the franchise is now
suddenly buzzing.

1590
02:00:45,538 --> 02:00:48,485
And the reason for that
is clearly, Sultan.

1591
02:00:48,941 --> 02:00:51,888
As you can see behind me excited
fans are scrambling in.

1592
02:00:52,178 --> 02:00:55,751
Today we expect the stadium
to be packed to capacity.

1593
02:00:56,782 --> 02:00:59,228
Here's presenting the capoeira
champion.

1594
02:00:59,585 --> 02:01:02,589
The merciless marauder, Marrese!

1595
02:01:06,592 --> 02:01:08,367
Oh my God, just look at this man.

1596
02:01:08,694 --> 02:01:12,437
He has real style and real vigour.

1597
02:01:12,765 --> 02:01:16,144
He has passion and of course this
acrobatic ﬂuidity.

1598
02:01:16,535 --> 02:01:19,345
His confidence is his
greatest weapon.

1599
02:01:20,139 --> 02:01:24,849
It seems the entire stadium has
just one name on their lips...

1600
02:01:25,244 --> 02:01:28,157
and that is, the merciless Marrese.

1601
02:01:53,873 --> 02:01:56,149
Bro, it's us next.

1602
02:01:59,745 --> 02:02:00,746
I'll wait outside.

1603
02:02:01,213 --> 02:02:05,093
We've seen a variety of fighting
styles in the last two seasons.

1604
02:02:05,484 --> 02:02:07,896
We've seen many exciting fighters...

1605
02:02:08,321 --> 02:02:11,791
but what was missing was a
homegrown hero.

1606
02:02:12,124 --> 02:02:15,003
Now we've got the answer
to that question.

1607
02:02:15,294 --> 02:02:17,604
We've got with us, a
World Wrestling Champion.

1608
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:19,537
Go for saaltu tackle.

1609
02:02:38,084 --> 02:02:43,830
Once called the lion, the soul, the
pride of Haryana, Sultan Ali Khan.

1610
02:02:46,425 --> 02:02:48,837
Look! Sultan has our pressure
cooker on his back.

1611
02:02:49,228 --> 02:02:51,037
Come on, Sultan!

1612
02:02:57,203 --> 02:02:59,615
Kubra, we gave him a bigger
build up.

1613
02:02:59,872 --> 02:03:03,081
He looks in great shape.
Come on, Sultan.

1614
02:03:03,676 --> 02:03:05,553
What's that?

1615
02:03:08,114 --> 02:03:12,563
I think that's what they call
global warming.

1616
02:03:15,221 --> 02:03:17,292
You know what I'm really curious
about in this match, Kubra...

1617
02:03:17,590 --> 02:03:21,970
how a local mud pit wrestler
survives this ring...

1618
02:03:22,194 --> 02:03:25,573
against a more agile and
younger fighter.

1619
02:03:25,931 --> 02:03:27,376
Well, that would be
an interesting watch...

1620
02:03:27,633 --> 02:03:33,174
because we're yet to see such
contrasting styles in this ring.

1621
02:03:33,506 --> 02:03:36,817
Indian wrestling in one corner...
capoeira on the other.

1622
02:03:57,396 --> 02:03:58,272
Fighters.

1623
02:04:01,167 --> 02:04:01,770
Touch gloves.

1624
02:04:03,936 --> 02:04:04,676
Corner.

1625
02:04:06,305 --> 02:04:06,976
Ready?

1626
02:04:08,474 --> 02:04:09,145
Ready?

1627
02:04:10,709 --> 02:04:11,278
Fight!

1628
02:04:13,913 --> 02:04:15,893
The beginning of the first fight
of the 3rd season.

1629
02:04:16,148 --> 02:04:18,150
Look, Kubra. Sultan moves like a...

1630
02:04:18,517 --> 02:04:21,088
local wrestler in an MMA ring.

1631
02:04:21,387 --> 02:04:23,765
This will be an exciting bout, Kubra.

1632
02:04:34,934 --> 02:04:37,005
Let's see what Marrese's
next move is going to be.

1633
02:04:37,403 --> 02:04:40,577
He's toying with Sultan right now.

1634
02:04:48,113 --> 02:04:49,251
Mind his punches!

1635
02:04:50,616 --> 02:04:51,424
And his kicks.

1636
02:04:52,985 --> 02:04:54,020
Come on, Marrese!

1637
02:04:58,924 --> 02:05:00,733
Oh no! He leaps like an ape.

1638
02:05:01,093 --> 02:05:02,367
I'll loose my money, Tiny!

1639
02:05:02,595 --> 02:05:04,597
Wait, Dad. The bout isn't over.

1640
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:06,466
Come on, Sultan!

1641
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:13,149
Simran, come here.

1642
02:05:14,173 --> 02:05:16,175
What are you doing? Focus!

1643
02:05:16,675 --> 02:05:19,519
Use your head. Drink some water.

1644
02:05:19,879 --> 02:05:22,291
This won't be easy for him...

1645
02:05:22,748 --> 02:05:25,490
as capoeira seems to be a very
unpredictable martial art.

1646
02:05:25,784 --> 02:05:28,390
Just as lost as we are,
so must be Sultan.

1647
02:05:41,166 --> 02:05:43,510
Here comes the snake move
from the capoeira king.

1648
02:05:44,103 --> 02:05:45,605
That would've really hurt!

1649
02:05:57,783 --> 02:05:58,625
Come on Sultan!

1650
02:06:26,912 --> 02:06:29,324
I think the entire audience is
screaming for Marrese.

1651
02:06:29,615 --> 02:06:31,117
Sultan does not stand a
chance tonight.

1652
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:34,121
Looking at this, this round will
be a very short one.

1653
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:38,190
Very good!

1654
02:06:38,624 --> 02:06:39,830
Pull away!

1655
02:06:44,229 --> 02:06:45,299
The fool has choked him!

1656
02:06:45,564 --> 02:06:47,942
Doesn't look like...
here comes the lock.

1657
02:06:48,367 --> 02:06:50,074
Sultan, keep breathing!

1658
02:06:50,302 --> 02:06:51,440
There comes the choke.

1659
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:57,343
10 more seconds to go. Will he
survive this round?

1660
02:07:01,046 --> 02:07:02,252
Oh God! Please stay on!

1661
02:07:03,716 --> 02:07:04,717
Five seconds!

1662
02:07:13,726 --> 02:07:14,363
Three.

1663
02:07:22,935 --> 02:07:24,505
Pull out!

1664
02:07:26,905 --> 02:07:27,781
And he's made it!

1665
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:30,746
A narrow escape for Sultan
in round one.

1666
02:07:32,711 --> 02:07:33,416
Good.

1667
02:07:35,114 --> 02:07:35,785
Yes!

1668
02:07:41,186 --> 02:07:42,494
Very good!

1669
02:07:43,155 --> 02:07:44,395
You're saved, Tiny!

1670
02:07:46,692 --> 02:07:47,568
Sultan bro...

1671
02:07:49,361 --> 02:07:50,772
That's our corner.

1672
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:52,108
- Stool?
- What?

1673
02:07:52,331 --> 02:07:53,241
The stool?

1674
02:07:54,233 --> 02:07:55,439
No time. Just squat here.

1675
02:07:57,169 --> 02:07:59,775
He's a damn acrobatic fighter.

1676
02:08:02,641 --> 02:08:04,518
I can't figure it out.

1677
02:08:05,144 --> 02:08:07,556
Is this the gorilla or the
chimpanzee style?

1678
02:08:07,846 --> 02:08:11,726
Don't care about his style, all
I care is that you are Sultan.

1679
02:08:12,117 --> 02:08:15,792
Don't be hotheaded. Stay cool.

1680
02:08:51,223 --> 02:08:51,963
Fight!

1681
02:09:01,734 --> 02:09:04,237
Well, Kubra, Sultan survived
the first round somehow.

1682
02:09:04,536 --> 02:09:06,914
Doubt if he'll last this round.

1683
02:09:16,682 --> 02:09:18,662
Wow! What was that?

1684
02:09:28,494 --> 02:09:29,131
What was that?

1685
02:09:29,528 --> 02:09:31,371
Sultan's walking off.

1686
02:09:31,697 --> 02:09:32,767
Where is he going?

1687
02:09:33,298 --> 02:09:34,174
Where's he going?

1688
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:36,079
The fight's not over yet.

1689
02:09:36,668 --> 02:09:38,170
That's a Sultan special.

1690
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:40,675
The fighter will not get up again.

1691
02:09:46,245 --> 02:09:48,816
The referee has signaled, the
match is over by a knockout!

1692
02:09:49,148 --> 02:09:50,320
This calls for a replay.

1693
02:10:03,595 --> 02:10:05,506
Chang, this is what I'll call...

1694
02:10:05,798 --> 02:10:08,244
a modern day Indian dhobi tackle.

1695
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:10,546
- I have a name for this...
- What?

1696
02:10:10,803 --> 02:10:13,215
This is a Sultan slam!

1697
02:10:19,178 --> 02:10:20,248
Bloody bull!

1698
02:10:49,174 --> 02:10:50,175
Sultan...

1699
02:10:51,543 --> 02:10:52,385
It's 3am.

1700
02:10:53,212 --> 02:10:54,885
You fought like a true
champion today.

1701
02:10:55,247 --> 02:10:56,225
Get some sleep.

1702
02:10:57,916 --> 02:11:01,659
What can I do, Aakash?
I can't sleep at night.

1703
02:11:04,957 --> 02:11:07,460
Do you know something?
When I accompanied you here...

1704
02:11:08,193 --> 02:11:10,400
I thought a loser is backing a loser.

1705
02:11:13,498 --> 02:11:14,602
You taught me something.

1706
02:11:15,701 --> 02:11:16,509
What?

1707
02:11:17,169 --> 02:11:18,648
Never to accept defeat in life.

1708
02:11:20,305 --> 02:11:21,511
To never give up.

1709
02:11:22,908 --> 02:11:27,186
This sport, the franchise, was just
business for me.

1710
02:11:29,581 --> 02:11:35,327
But now I want to see respect in my
father's eyes for me.

1711
02:11:36,288 --> 02:11:38,063
You're an emotional guy.

1712
02:11:39,258 --> 02:11:40,669
You gave me another reason to fight.

1713
02:11:42,127 --> 02:11:42,935
Good night.

1714
02:11:44,696 --> 02:11:47,302
After the fantastic and exciting
first fight...

1715
02:11:47,633 --> 02:11:50,443
we're seeing a much faster and
more confident Sultan.

1716
02:11:50,736 --> 02:11:54,206
Who's hammering his new opponent
in his local Indian style.

1717
02:11:54,539 --> 02:11:55,540
- Isn't it, Kubra?
- Absolutely!

1718
02:11:55,707 --> 02:11:57,050
He seems unstoppable.

1719
02:11:57,309 --> 02:11:58,447
The punches don't stop.

1720
02:11:58,677 --> 02:11:59,883
Flip him over!

1721
02:12:00,746 --> 02:12:01,850
Zane is down!

1722
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:07,257
That's a lock... here comes a choke!

1723
02:12:07,619 --> 02:12:09,189
And Zane taps out!

1724
02:12:10,188 --> 02:12:12,464
Yes! I told you.
Sultan is a champion.

1725
02:12:12,758 --> 02:12:13,828
Excuse me.

1726
02:12:14,426 --> 02:12:16,565
Do you have the Sultan
pressure cooker?

1727
02:12:18,163 --> 02:12:20,040
How many shall I pack?

1728
02:12:20,299 --> 02:12:21,972
When he defeats an opponent...

1729
02:12:22,234 --> 02:12:24,111
he folds his hands to ask
forgiveness.

1730
02:12:24,403 --> 02:12:27,850
That's what's going to make him
a poster boy of our country.

1731
02:12:32,044 --> 02:12:33,421
- Good evening madam.
- Good evening.

1732
02:12:33,645 --> 02:12:35,852
I have a son, Rakesh. He's 5.

1733
02:12:36,248 --> 02:12:38,888
He woke up this morning
and told me...

1734
02:12:39,217 --> 02:12:40,525
I want to change my name
to Sultan.

1735
02:12:40,686 --> 02:12:41,892
When I asked him why...

1736
02:12:42,187 --> 02:12:45,100
He said: "Papa, all these film
stars are fake."

1737
02:12:45,490 --> 02:12:48,699
"Sultan is the real hero. I want to
grow up to be like him."

1738
02:12:49,027 --> 02:12:51,098
Madam, he made a sketch for you.

1739
02:12:56,068 --> 02:12:58,548
"Please forgive me."

1740
02:13:14,319 --> 02:13:15,127
Thanks.

1741
02:13:15,387 --> 02:13:17,367
- Would you like something?
- I'm fine.

1742
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:28,405
Wait there.

1743
02:13:32,904 --> 02:13:35,111
- What are you doing?
- Having my dinner.

1744
02:13:35,507 --> 02:13:37,851
Forget that. Get dressed right now.

1745
02:13:38,377 --> 02:13:39,287
Let's Party!

1746
02:13:40,712 --> 02:13:41,656
Your wedding party?

1747
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:44,690
It's not my wedding. It's my
birthday party.

1748
02:13:45,851 --> 02:13:46,693
Wow!

1749
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:50,427
Congratulations. It's wonderful!

1750
02:13:50,789 --> 02:13:52,928
A boring congrats won't do.

1751
02:13:53,258 --> 02:13:55,704
There'll be girls. We'll party.
Let's go.

1752
02:13:55,994 --> 02:13:57,837
- Forget it.
- Seriously?

1753
02:13:59,331 --> 02:14:00,366
I don't believe this guy.

1754
02:14:01,099 --> 02:14:03,136
OK, I won't go either.

1755
02:14:03,602 --> 02:14:05,878
I'll pass out sitting here.

1756
02:14:06,238 --> 02:14:08,616
- Stop behaving like a kid.
- I'm not being a kid.

1757
02:14:10,042 --> 02:14:11,749
You're like a brother, that's why
I asked.

1758
02:14:12,277 --> 02:14:13,255
You're like family.

1759
02:14:14,212 --> 02:14:16,214
We don't party without family.

1760
02:14:17,015 --> 02:14:18,221
OK. TV it is.

1761
02:14:19,217 --> 02:14:20,287
Melodrama.

1762
02:14:22,621 --> 02:14:24,567
There's a saying in my village...

1763
02:14:25,357 --> 02:14:27,633
I'll say it in English.

1764
02:14:30,195 --> 02:14:33,802
"Don't teach a father how to
make babies."

1765
02:14:37,302 --> 02:14:38,007
Let's go.

1766
02:14:38,303 --> 02:14:41,250
Happy birthday to you!

1767
02:14:55,687 --> 02:14:59,328
No, thanks. I only like getting
drunk on love.

1768
02:14:59,858 --> 02:15:01,804
You're so cute.

1769
02:15:02,227 --> 02:15:04,002
Please leave your wife and marry me.

1770
02:15:04,329 --> 02:15:07,776
You know my wife is very special.

1771
02:15:08,200 --> 02:15:12,444
She left you years ago. Everything
has an expiry date.

1772
02:15:16,208 --> 02:15:21,055
For us, love lasts way beyond
expiry dates.

1773
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:24,857
So, what does your wife have
that we don't?

1774
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:28,024
No, madam. You're all great.

1775
02:15:29,020 --> 02:15:30,556
But she's something else.

1776
02:15:31,056 --> 02:15:32,797
What do they say in English?

1777
02:15:33,758 --> 02:15:35,396
- Feel.
- Yes, feel.

1778
02:15:36,361 --> 02:15:41,242
It's something about her
that can only be felt.

1779
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:17,473
Not those angelic eyes

1780
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:20,340
Nor that luminous face

1781
02:16:21,740 --> 02:16:23,617
Nor those words of love

1782
02:16:24,476 --> 02:16:26,353
Nor that sheer beauty

1783
02:16:26,678 --> 02:16:31,593
I roamed the world,
there is none like you

1784
02:16:37,556 --> 02:16:39,263
Not that intoxicating smile

1785
02:16:40,458 --> 02:16:42,096
Not the sensuous fragrance

1786
02:16:43,261 --> 02:16:45,104
Not her playful demeanor

1787
02:16:46,231 --> 02:16:48,074
Not her innocent mistakes

1788
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:51,479
Stay just the way you are

1789
02:16:52,771 --> 02:16:57,516
I roamed the world,
there is none like you

1790
02:17:47,692 --> 02:17:52,664
You're the first sprout
of a summer rain

1791
02:17:53,365 --> 02:17:58,508
Like the pink blush of winter cheeks

1792
02:18:05,010 --> 02:18:09,925
The tranquility of nights,
the purity of dawn

1793
02:18:10,815 --> 02:18:15,264
I cradle you in the warmth
of my heart

1794
02:18:15,820 --> 02:18:17,959
Somewhere she burns like a ﬂame

1795
02:18:18,723 --> 02:18:20,828
She is a blessing of raindrops

1796
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:23,799
Sometimes she says yes

1797
02:18:24,529 --> 02:18:26,338
The delights of her free spirit

1798
02:18:26,898 --> 02:18:29,879
Stay just the way you are

1799
02:18:31,069 --> 02:18:35,677
I roamed the world,
there is none like you

1800
02:19:06,805 --> 02:19:10,719
Sultan, the wrestler known for
his unique moves in the ring...

1801
02:19:11,009 --> 02:19:13,421
is now gaining popularity for
something most unusual.

1802
02:19:13,712 --> 02:19:17,854
A romantic song sung by him 'Jag
Ghoomeya' is breaking the Internet.

1803
02:19:18,350 --> 02:19:22,730
His fans have a new name
for him, Romeo-Wrestler!

1804
02:19:23,154 --> 02:19:28,069
With kindness of fortune
and feats of valour

1805
02:19:28,793 --> 02:19:33,071
Riding the waves of joy and sorrow

1806
02:19:34,599 --> 02:19:36,738
I will keep you with me

1807
02:19:40,438 --> 02:19:44,887
I will keep you with me, forever

1808
02:19:46,177 --> 02:19:50,683
In the world of my dreams and hopes

1809
02:19:51,249 --> 02:19:52,853
I feel your presence around me

1810
02:19:54,152 --> 02:19:55,790
No one believes it, but I know

1811
02:19:57,088 --> 02:19:59,591
You know even after the day I'm gone

1812
02:19:59,891 --> 02:20:01,666
I will be by your side

1813
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:05,241
Do just as you promised

1814
02:20:06,564 --> 02:20:11,309
I roamed the world,
there is none like you

1815
02:20:29,421 --> 02:20:33,836
In Pro Take-Down 2nd semi-final,
it's Sultan vs Tyron.

1816
02:20:34,526 --> 02:20:38,872
And Tyron has an unbroken record
of winning in the 2nd round.

1817
02:21:04,355 --> 02:21:05,026
Fight!

1818
02:21:06,357 --> 02:21:09,770
Very exciting match today as
a wrestler fights a wrestler.

1819
02:21:10,061 --> 02:21:11,836
Kubra, this match will not only
be interesting...

1820
02:21:12,096 --> 02:21:15,475
but entertaining too. Just look
at that swagger from Tyron.

1821
02:21:15,700 --> 02:21:18,476
It's almost an invitation:
"Show me what you've got."

1822
02:21:19,003 --> 02:21:21,643
That's because Tyron has been
a former wrestler.

1823
02:21:31,649 --> 02:21:33,492
It's the local dhobi slam...

1824
02:21:33,852 --> 02:21:35,229
Sultan's style statement!

1825
02:21:51,936 --> 02:21:52,812
Come on bro. Buck up!

1826
02:21:53,037 --> 02:21:54,710
That is when Sultan strikes.

1827
02:21:55,106 --> 02:21:57,950
Both have the same style,
this could be interesting...

1828
02:22:30,675 --> 02:22:32,916
Oh my God! That's not what
we were expecting...

1829
02:22:33,244 --> 02:22:36,384
those are some punches and kicks
mixed with wrestling.

1830
02:22:36,714 --> 02:22:38,591
Seems Sultan is very shaky
at the moment.

1831
02:22:45,924 --> 02:22:47,494
He's coming heavy on Sultan.

1832
02:22:47,725 --> 02:22:49,727
Sultan, you are getting
hammered today.

1833
02:23:24,696 --> 02:23:26,107
Sultan is down, here comes, Tyron!

1834
02:23:27,899 --> 02:23:29,173
Saved by the bell.

1835
02:23:29,667 --> 02:23:31,578
This is not good.

1836
02:23:32,570 --> 02:23:35,779
This man is a crowd favourite.
He is my favourite.

1837
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:40,179
Seeing someone come down
to the cage is not good.

1838
02:23:40,645 --> 02:23:41,623
What happened?

1839
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:43,622
Old age.

1840
02:23:44,282 --> 02:23:45,886
- Did you hear the sound?
- Of what?

1841
02:23:47,118 --> 02:23:48,529
The fool crushed my rib cage.

1842
02:23:51,522 --> 02:23:53,524
I won't let you fight.
I'll throw in the towel...

1843
02:23:53,825 --> 02:23:54,599
Shush!

1844
02:23:55,126 --> 02:23:57,037
Should I give up my cause?

1845
02:23:57,662 --> 02:24:00,040
Be a loser again?
Give up once again?

1846
02:24:00,465 --> 02:24:02,445
I know you won't give up.

1847
02:24:02,767 --> 02:24:05,077
You won't give up, but he'll
kill you.

1848
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:10,644
My life is in Rewari...

1849
02:24:12,610 --> 02:24:14,021
and I'm here just for her.

1850
02:24:19,851 --> 02:24:21,023
See you later, bro.

1851
02:24:22,453 --> 02:24:23,830
Slam this guy!

1852
02:24:25,523 --> 02:24:28,868
Here we are. The 2nd round
of the second big semi-final.

1853
02:24:29,193 --> 02:24:30,365
Sultan still looks shaky.

1854
02:24:30,561 --> 02:24:32,234
- What happened?
- A rib cage fracture.

1855
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:34,041
Stop the fight!

1856
02:24:34,365 --> 02:24:35,901
I tried. He won't listen.

1857
02:24:37,602 --> 02:24:38,307
Fight!

1858
02:24:44,175 --> 02:24:46,917
Sultan seems hurt in his rib cage...

1859
02:24:47,245 --> 02:24:49,657
and Tyron is taking full
advantage of that.

1860
02:24:50,648 --> 02:24:54,323
It seems, Tyron will keep his record
of winning in the 2nd round.

1861
02:25:18,976 --> 02:25:20,546
That's a powerful slam from Tyron.

1862
02:25:21,279 --> 02:25:24,556
Sultan is down. It doesn't
look like he'll get up.

1863
02:25:24,849 --> 02:25:25,452
Get up!

1864
02:25:25,717 --> 02:25:28,288
Tyron moving behind, adjusting
his shoulder.

1865
02:25:28,686 --> 02:25:30,461
I think this hasn't worked for Tyron.

1866
02:25:48,639 --> 02:25:50,482
Sultan brother, don't lose hope.

1867
02:26:35,553 --> 02:26:36,827
Get away!

1868
02:26:41,159 --> 02:26:42,502
Get up!

1869
02:26:54,305 --> 02:26:56,785
Sultan just dodged that!
Beautifully done!

1870
02:26:57,074 --> 02:26:58,917
Is this the rise of the wrestler?

1871
02:27:06,117 --> 02:27:08,188
Sultan, crush him.

1872
02:27:08,519 --> 02:27:09,759
Come on Sultan!

1873
02:27:15,193 --> 02:27:16,968
Sultan, crush him!

1874
02:27:17,461 --> 02:27:20,067
Everyone is still cheering for Sultan,
they're hoping for the best.

1875
02:27:23,201 --> 02:27:25,681
Sultan, crush him!

1876
02:27:45,089 --> 02:27:45,999
Crush him!

1877
02:28:01,806 --> 02:28:04,116
That is the end of Tyron,
in this very cage...

1878
02:28:04,375 --> 02:28:06,582
of Force Motors presents
Pro Take-Down.

1879
02:28:06,844 --> 02:28:07,652
That's my boy!

1880
02:28:08,512 --> 02:28:09,923
Tyron doesn't seem to be moving.

1881
02:28:10,448 --> 02:28:12,428
And with that it truly means...

1882
02:28:12,683 --> 02:28:15,186
that our Indian homegrown
Romeo-Wrestler...

1883
02:28:15,519 --> 02:28:19,365
...has made it to the finals of
Force Motors Pro Take-Down!

1884
02:28:51,589 --> 02:28:53,694
This is Govind from Delhi.

1885
02:28:54,258 --> 02:28:57,239
He's hurt really bad.
He's in hospital.

1886
02:28:57,695 --> 02:29:01,108
I'll book your ticket and pick you
up from the bus depot.

1887
02:29:03,167 --> 02:29:06,740
The drama does not stop
at Pro Take-Down.

1888
02:29:07,171 --> 02:29:08,809
As you can see...

1889
02:29:09,206 --> 02:29:13,313
thousands of fans are here to wish
their hero Sultan a speedy recovery.

1890
02:29:13,611 --> 02:29:14,817
They want him back in the ring.

1891
02:29:15,146 --> 02:29:17,422
Sultan defeated Tyron in the
semis yesterday...

1892
02:29:19,717 --> 02:29:20,695
Aakash.

1893
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:23,094
Yes, sir.

1894
02:29:23,354 --> 02:29:24,526
What have you decided?

1895
02:29:25,523 --> 02:29:28,561
Sir, what's there to decide?
I tried, but he won't listen.

1896
02:29:29,360 --> 02:29:31,704
- He'll partake in the finals.
- Put some logic in his head.

1897
02:29:31,929 --> 02:29:32,930
- I've tried.
- Aakash...

1898
02:29:33,297 --> 02:29:35,834
he is out of danger but
he's still critical.

1899
02:29:38,536 --> 02:29:41,176
If he enters that ring, he won't
come out alive.

1900
02:29:45,810 --> 02:29:49,952
That's Aakash.
Aakash, this is Aarfa.

1901
02:30:24,582 --> 02:30:25,652
Got your bones broken?

1902
02:30:27,985 --> 02:30:31,228
I didn't get them broken,
the fool broke them.

1903
02:30:32,590 --> 02:30:35,537
Sit down. The bones will mend.

1904
02:30:40,531 --> 02:30:42,238
What are you proving, Sultan?

1905
02:30:42,666 --> 02:30:44,646
That you really love me?

1906
02:30:45,836 --> 02:30:47,247
Now that you're here...

1907
02:30:48,472 --> 02:30:50,713
let's talk things through.

1908
02:30:54,211 --> 02:30:55,781
Are you still angry with me?

1909
02:30:58,716 --> 02:31:00,923
You never saw it from my eyes.

1910
02:31:02,086 --> 02:31:07,195
Who did I take up wrestling for?
Why did I become a wrestler?

1911
02:31:08,359 --> 02:31:10,669
In whose eyes did I want to see
respect for me?

1912
02:31:17,001 --> 02:31:18,207
Whose son was Aman?

1913
02:31:21,238 --> 02:31:22,273
Only yours?

1914
02:31:26,444 --> 02:31:27,684
Was he not my blood too?

1915
02:31:29,613 --> 02:31:33,720
Aarfa, did a father not lose
his son?

1916
02:31:39,890 --> 02:31:42,268
At times pain can heal deeper hurt.

1917
02:31:45,096 --> 02:31:46,632
What did you think?

1918
02:31:47,932 --> 02:31:49,912
It was only you who came to
the shrine?

1919
02:31:51,969 --> 02:31:56,884
Did you care why I was there
every day?

1920
02:31:58,242 --> 02:31:59,186
Why?

1921
02:32:01,345 --> 02:32:02,949
Just to see your face.

1922
02:32:05,316 --> 02:32:10,425
For years our relationship hinged
on this terrible pain.

1923
02:32:11,922 --> 02:32:16,393
People can lose hope when suffering
pain. But not us, why?

1924
02:32:19,196 --> 02:32:21,073
Because my love for you is true.

1925
02:32:21,665 --> 02:32:23,269
Just as your innocence is genuine.

1926
02:32:27,571 --> 02:32:32,350
I know that I have hurt you
over the years.

1927
02:32:35,246 --> 02:32:37,522
You did not deserve that.

1928
02:32:39,683 --> 02:32:41,219
But if I may tell you...

1929
02:32:43,053 --> 02:32:45,761
A mother's wound runs deeper
than a father's.

1930
02:32:58,903 --> 02:32:59,711
Sorry.

1931
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:13,595
Do you know everyone says that
if you stepped into that ring...

1932
02:33:13,851 --> 02:33:15,421
you won't come out alive?

1933
02:33:17,955 --> 02:33:18,797
I know.

1934
02:33:19,423 --> 02:33:22,267
But they do not know Sultan's
true nature.

1935
02:33:23,894 --> 02:33:27,774
I know that if you give up today...

1936
02:33:29,166 --> 02:33:30,975
you may live...

1937
02:33:32,002 --> 02:33:35,415
but your inner being will die.
Gone forever.

1938
02:33:36,340 --> 02:33:38,377
- You know it. Right?
- Yes.

1939
02:33:39,443 --> 02:33:40,581
So go.

1940
02:33:41,679 --> 02:33:43,659
And finish what you started.

1941
02:33:45,816 --> 02:33:47,352
And promise me this.

1942
02:33:48,586 --> 02:33:53,797
Wrestler to wrestler, man to wife.

1943
02:33:56,894 --> 02:33:58,373
You'll come back alive.

1944
02:34:01,265 --> 02:34:04,371
We are sportspersons.
We don't give up.

1945
02:34:10,608 --> 02:34:11,746
Yes, teacher.

1946
02:34:15,613 --> 02:34:17,217
- Easy.
- Come.

1947
02:34:18,249 --> 02:34:20,058
Your fans are waiting outside.

1948
02:34:20,784 --> 02:34:22,195
Let them see you.

1949
02:35:08,899 --> 02:35:11,106
Today this ring will witness a clash
of titans: Sultan vs Marcus.

1950
02:35:11,368 --> 02:35:13,609
The deadliest fighter.

1951
02:35:13,971 --> 02:35:15,609
In fact, history knows...

1952
02:35:15,839 --> 02:35:20,447
that he's sent three contenders
out of this ring on stretchers.

1953
02:35:28,519 --> 02:35:29,429
Listen.

1954
02:35:31,121 --> 02:35:33,032
Don't let that bother you.

1955
02:35:47,304 --> 02:35:48,214
Come.

1956
02:35:50,507 --> 02:35:51,542
Come back soon.

1957
02:35:55,045 --> 02:35:56,115
For that frown?

1958
02:35:59,083 --> 02:36:00,118
Smile, just once.

1959
02:36:09,793 --> 02:36:12,967
Challenging Marcus is Sultan.
A man with suspected fractures.

1960
02:36:13,497 --> 02:36:15,738
It's not a match, it's suicide.

1961
02:36:16,200 --> 02:36:17,304
I'd have to agree.

1962
02:36:17,568 --> 02:36:20,640
We know full well what the
outcome will be.

1963
02:36:20,938 --> 02:36:22,975
But I think it's time for us
to salute this guy.

1964
02:36:23,307 --> 02:36:26,413
Chang, we'll watch the bout
with our microphones down.

1965
02:36:26,777 --> 02:36:29,018
- As true Sultan fans.
- As fans.

1966
02:36:32,649 --> 02:36:35,687
Why the long face?
Melodramatic nonsense.

1967
02:36:37,721 --> 02:36:40,531
Aakash brother, tell me something.

1968
02:36:41,425 --> 02:36:43,132
With all my grappling
and jostling...

1969
02:36:43,494 --> 02:36:46,941
I hope you've made enough
money for the blood bank?

1970
02:36:47,998 --> 02:36:48,999
- Yes.
- Good.

1971
02:36:50,801 --> 02:36:51,905
We've come far then.

1972
02:36:53,704 --> 02:36:57,311
What they call in English,
the underdog?

1973
02:37:11,288 --> 02:37:11,925
Come on!

1974
02:37:14,591 --> 02:37:15,729
Last fight.

1975
02:37:16,527 --> 02:37:20,407
You are the son of the soil

1976
02:37:20,998 --> 02:37:23,000
Between the realms of
heaven and earth

1977
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:25,109
Lingers your magnificent soul

1978
02:37:27,204 --> 02:37:28,376
O Sultan

1979
02:38:25,863 --> 02:38:26,773
Touch gloves.

1980
02:38:30,300 --> 02:38:31,108
Corner.

1981
02:38:32,736 --> 02:38:33,908
Fighter ready?

1982
02:38:34,571 --> 02:38:35,413
Ready?

1983
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:37,248
Fight!

1984
02:39:17,981 --> 02:39:20,791
Govind. Stay in touch with Aarfa.

1985
02:39:53,216 --> 02:39:54,058
Just finish him.

1986
02:39:54,318 --> 02:39:55,194
Yes, I will.

1987
02:41:45,228 --> 02:41:46,104
Yes!

1988
02:41:48,699 --> 02:41:49,609
Sultan, come on!

1989
02:42:08,785 --> 02:42:11,425
Your fight is bigger than this
championship.

1990
02:42:11,855 --> 02:42:14,426
Because you'll fight yourself,
Sultan.

1991
02:42:16,827 --> 02:42:21,139
To earn respect you must also
face humiliation.

1992
02:42:23,633 --> 02:42:25,670
I asked you to earn respect,
Sultan.

1993
02:42:26,470 --> 02:42:28,541
All you did was inﬂate your ego?

1994
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:32,417
Can no one defeat you?

1995
02:42:33,643 --> 02:42:37,090
Only one man can defeat Sultan...
Sultan himself.

1996
02:42:39,549 --> 02:42:40,220
Come.

1997
02:43:03,774 --> 02:43:05,048
Brilliant, Sultan.

1998
02:43:06,510 --> 02:43:07,215
Get him.

1999
02:43:11,982 --> 02:43:13,962
I learned three things that day.

2000
02:43:14,718 --> 02:43:16,220
Wrestling is not a sport.

2001
02:43:16,553 --> 02:43:20,797
It's about fighting what lies within.

2002
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:30,671
Second.

2003
02:43:31,935 --> 02:43:34,745
A true wrestler is not one
who wins medals.

2004
02:43:35,372 --> 02:43:39,582
But one who fights the game
of life and wins.

2005
02:43:43,213 --> 02:43:44,055
You mad-man!

2006
02:43:44,447 --> 02:43:45,221
Yes!

2007
02:43:53,623 --> 02:43:56,069
Come on, Sultan. Bravo!

2008
02:43:56,626 --> 02:43:58,367
Bravo Sultan!

2009
02:43:58,895 --> 02:44:00,033
And finally.

2010
02:44:01,164 --> 02:44:02,939
No one can defeat you...

2011
02:44:06,603 --> 02:44:08,605
until you let yourself be defeated.

2012
02:45:35,592 --> 02:45:36,662
Sultan!

2013
02:45:45,035 --> 02:45:47,208
Not those angelic eyes

2014
02:45:48,004 --> 02:45:50,280
Nor that luminous face

2015
02:45:51,207 --> 02:45:53,209
Nor those words of love

2016
02:45:54,277 --> 02:45:56,154
Nor that sheer beauty

2017
02:45:56,579 --> 02:46:01,426
I roamed the world,
there is none like you

2018
02:46:15,899 --> 02:46:18,436
"Aman Blood Bank."

2019
02:46:39,255 --> 02:46:40,256
I am proud of you, son.

2020
02:46:43,860 --> 02:46:44,770
Well done!

2021
02:46:51,968 --> 02:46:53,879
Master, you need more speed.

2022
02:46:55,739 --> 02:46:57,275
What they say in English...

2023
02:46:58,241 --> 02:47:00,619
I don't want to be trained
by a dead person!

2024
02:47:02,078 --> 02:47:02,954
Here.

2025
02:47:03,613 --> 02:47:05,524
It's for your gym.

2026
02:47:07,417 --> 02:47:08,555
Close shave.

2027
02:47:09,219 --> 02:47:10,596
Very close, master.

2028
02:47:15,392 --> 02:47:17,497
Aarfa. The lioness of Haryana...

2029
02:47:18,061 --> 02:47:21,599
returning to the State
Championship after 8 long years.

2030
02:47:22,165 --> 02:47:25,510
Following in her footsteps...

2031
02:47:25,835 --> 02:47:28,611
is her life companion,
Sultan Ali Khan.

2032
02:47:36,012 --> 02:47:36,922
Doctor?

2033
02:47:37,614 --> 02:47:38,558
Aarfa?

2034
02:47:39,416 --> 02:47:40,952
Hurry! I'm so worried.

2035
02:47:41,518 --> 02:47:43,020
Call for sweets!

2036
02:47:53,596 --> 02:47:55,872
What do you want? A girl or a boy?

2037
02:47:57,534 --> 02:48:00,378
Pull out a girl for me.

2038
02:48:09,379 --> 02:48:11,381
How do you feel after
all this success?

2039
02:48:11,748 --> 02:48:14,160
What do you think? Look at
my face, it's glowing.

2040
02:48:14,484 --> 02:48:17,488
It's been 5 years since we saw
Sultan in the ring...

2041
02:48:17,754 --> 02:48:19,290
will we see him next season?

2042
02:48:19,622 --> 02:48:22,694
He's a wrestler. Wherever he is,
he'll be fighting.
