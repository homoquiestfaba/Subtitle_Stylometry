00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:16,484
(dramatic music)

3
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,966
(alarm ringing)

4
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:00,728
- [Guard] Section A.

5
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:01,561
Section B.

6
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:03,282
Section C.

7
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,133
Get up!

8
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,366
Get up!

9
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:10,199
Up yours!

10
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:14,108
Get up!

11
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:16,292
Get up!

12
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:05,743
- Woo, Zelda!
- Zelda!

13
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:10,577
- [Zelda] Shut up!

14
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:17,479
- All right, Zelda, welcome back.

15
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,479
- Hey, baby.

16
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,303
- [Guard] I hope you stay out
of solitary this time, Zelda.

17
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:28,720
Wash up, you got two minutes.

18
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,442
(inmates chattering)

19
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:14,299
- Hey.

20
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:20,002
- Sorry, I didn't see you there.

21
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:21,523
- Get that broom away from me

22
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:24,440
before I stick it down your throat.

23
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,775
- Watch your fuckin' hands.

24
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,860
(dramatic music)

25
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:04,256
- Hi, Sarah.

26
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:08,073
What are you reading, dear?

27
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:08,981
- It's called a book.

28
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,503
And it doesn't have any pictures in it,

29
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:13,193
so you wouldn't be interested.

30
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:15,991
- There's something I
want to talk to you about.

31
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:17,623
- I'm not interested.

32
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:19,790
- Oh, I think you will be.

33
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,155
Where is it?

34
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:34,512
- Damn, you're always cheating.

35
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:47,342
(inmates cheering)

36
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:13,379
Tell me where.

37
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:19,182
Hold her down, damn it.

38
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:21,015
- Cut her, Z, cut her!

39
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:23,668
- [Zelda] Tell me where is, Sarah,

40
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:26,442
or I'll cut you like a turkey.

41
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:29,659
I'm gonna make you my little girl, Sarah.

42
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:32,992
Don't be afraid, Sarah, you may like it.

43
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,366
- Move!

44
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:39,587
Move!

45
00:06:57,912 --> 00:06:58,745
Shit.

46
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:12,179
- Break it up!

47
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:13,012
Break it up!

48
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:13,845
Guards!

49
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:16,052
That is enough!

50
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:18,473
Stop it, that is enough!

51
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:19,766
Break it up!

52
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:22,016
Break it up, that's enough!

53
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:25,633
That is enough, break it up!

54
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:26,466
Where's Zelda?

55
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:28,248
- I haven't seen her.

56
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,081
- Shit.

57
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:30,998
- All right, that's it.

58
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,683
- Get her, Dot.

59
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,013
Get her.

60
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:42,080
My girls will take you out--
- Break it up!

61
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,960
Break it up!
- So fast.

62
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,710
- Break it up, Zelda.

63
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,161
All right, who started it?

64
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:49,367
- She did it.

65
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,555
Bitch started hitting on me for no reason.

66
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:52,429
- I did not.
- Shut up!

67
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:53,512
- Get that crazy bitch away from me.

68
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:54,446
- Shut up.

69
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:56,251
Sarah, who started it?

70
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:59,584
- I don't care, put 'em all in solitary.

71
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:01,670
- Good idea.

72
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,087
Let's go, move it!
- You slut.

73
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:10,765
- Come on, move it.

74
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:11,598
Here.

75
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:14,111
You, there.

76
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,160
Get over there.

77
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,131
Move it, Dot.

78
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:29,874
Quit foolin' around and
get in the cell there.

79
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:31,114
- I hate you, Tina.

80
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:33,054
- Oh shut up, Zelda.

81
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:33,887
- [Zelda] Bitch.

82
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:35,150
- Get in the cell, Peters.

83
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,025
- Look, they were trying to kill Sarah.

84
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:37,107
- Yeah, I've heard it before.

85
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:39,236
Get in the cell.

86
00:08:39,236 --> 00:08:40,302
- They had a knife.

87
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:43,435
- Look, Peters, I don't
like troublemakers.

88
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:45,794
- I'm not--
- Shut up and sit down!

89
00:08:45,794 --> 00:08:47,162
And if you're a real good girl,

90
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:50,245
I might let you out in a week or two.

91
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:00,230
- [Zelda] You're a bitch.

92
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:11,162
- Sarah, you okay?

93
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:19,724
What happened out there?

94
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:20,557
- Nothing.

95
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,756
(dramatic music)

96
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:09,855
(knocking)

97
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:11,438
- [Inmate] Cell 17.

98
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:17,535
(knocking)

99
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:22,108
- What?

100
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:36,732
(knocking)

101
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:37,565
Cell 17.

102
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:42,747
- [Inmate] Shit.

103
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:48,908
(knocking)

104
00:10:50,836 --> 00:10:51,802
- What?

105
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:54,052
- [Inmate] Message for you.

106
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,152
- Warden says you got
yourself a new roommate.

107
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:39,187
Peters, I don't know why,

108
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:41,750
but the warden thinks
you're something special.

109
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,583
Well, I don't.

110
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,419
And while you're on my cell block,

111
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:46,952
you do exactly as I say, you got that?

112
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:47,785
- Yeah.

113
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,830
- Good luck.

114
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:13,620
- You're welcome, by the way.

115
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,060
- For what?

116
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,278
- For saving your ass
out there this afternoon.

117
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,528
- Yeah, thanks.

118
00:12:22,995 --> 00:12:25,546
- They would've killed you, you know that.

119
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:26,975
- They weren't going to kill me.

120
00:12:26,975 --> 00:12:29,549
- Oh yeah, what makes you so sure?

121
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,382
- All they wanted was.

122
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,283
Forget it.

123
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:50,122
If it makes you feel any better, thanks.

124
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,350
- Go to sleep.

125
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:26,620
- [Guard] All right, let's go!

126
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,453
Move it!

127
00:13:30,441 --> 00:13:32,730
- What are you so happy about?

128
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,535
- I'm having a visitor today.

129
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:35,653
- Yeah?

130
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:37,096
- Yeah.

131
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:38,346
Conjugal visit.

132
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:42,493
I can't wait, it's been so long for me.

133
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:44,302
So how 'bout you?

134
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:45,577
- No conjugal visits for me.

135
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:47,242
I'm not married.

136
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:48,829
- Well, you get to have
visitors at least, don't you?

137
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:49,923
- No.

138
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:50,756
- Come on.

139
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,460
You mean to tell me that
you don't have a boyfriend

140
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,189
or anybody who comes and visits you?

141
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:00,356
- Don't you know anything?

142
00:14:02,382 --> 00:14:04,602
My boyfriend Carlos, well, he'd rather--

143
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:05,821
(whistling)

144
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:09,126
- [Wincott] All right, inspection.

145
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:10,625
- Wincott's daily inspection.

146
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,708
Just be cool.

147
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,856
- Someone's been sneaking
drugs into my cell block.

148
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,773
Which one of you sluts has it been?

149
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:22,514
Turn around, Peters.

150
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:24,431
Hands against the wall.

151
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,304
You know the routine.

152
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,971
Come on, spread 'em.

153
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,603
- Hey!

154
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:42,103
- Leave her alone.

155
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:45,331
- What did you say?

156
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:46,581
- You're not searching for anything.

157
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:47,606
Leave her alone.

158
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:49,317
- Maybe you're right.

159
00:14:49,317 --> 00:14:51,077
If someone's been sneaking drugs in here,

160
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:53,757
maybe it's you I should be interested in.

161
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:56,924
Maybe you're the one I need to search.

162
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,450
All right, Peters, I'm done with you.

163
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,950
You, come with me.

164
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:10,106
(dramatic music)

165
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:14,580
You should know what I want.

166
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,258
The same thing Zelda was after.

167
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:19,675
- What are you talking about?

168
00:15:20,668 --> 00:15:23,335
- Are you playing games with me?

169
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:30,367
You know what I'm looking for.

170
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:33,617
- I don't know what you're looking for.

171
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,273
- Then let this be a warning to you.

172
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,606
Get out of here.

173
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,543
Fuck!

174
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,580
- Are you okay?

175
00:16:05,168 --> 00:16:08,169
- I thought I warned you,
no more illegal searches.

176
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,895
- Look, Tina, drugs are getting in here,

177
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:10,815
but not on my shift.

178
00:16:10,815 --> 00:16:12,271
On yours.
- That's bullshit!

179
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,992
I am sick of you and your
disgusting little searches.

180
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:18,575
- Screw you, get out of my way.

181
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,949
My arm, you're breaking my arm.

182
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:25,515
- If I wanted to break it, you'd
have heard it snap already.

183
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:28,369
Now, lay off the prisoners,
especially Sarah.

184
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:30,063
You got that?

185
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:32,018
- And if I don't?

186
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:34,402
All right, all right, understood.

187
00:16:34,402 --> 00:16:35,652
Just let me go.

188
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,175
- Are we clear now?

189
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:41,646
- Everything's gotta be by
the book with you, Lamb,

190
00:16:41,646 --> 00:16:43,246
doesn't it?
- That's right.

191
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:45,413
That way nobody gets hurt.

192
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:21,135
- Follow me please.

193
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:22,745
This your first conjugal visit?

194
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:24,301
- [Jerry] Um, yes.

195
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:25,678
- [Guard] Well, these are the rules.

196
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,700
You and then prisoner
you're visiting are confined

197
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,749
to the room at all times.

198
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,261
There are guards stationed outside,

199
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:33,631
so don't try anything stupid.

200
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:37,182
If you have an emergency
of any kind, just call out.

201
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:39,355
If you wish to leave, call out.

202
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:40,794
If we hear anything suspicious,

203
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,177
we will come in for inspection.

204
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,430
If we hear any fighting,
violence, or anything

205
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,432
out of the ordinary, again, we
will come in for inspection.

206
00:17:49,432 --> 00:17:50,935
Is this understood?

207
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:52,685
- [Jerry] Yeah, yeah.

208
00:17:58,305 --> 00:17:59,967
- Your wife will be here in a minute.

209
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:00,800
- Yeah.

210
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:15,778
Hi.

211
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:17,368
- Hi.

212
00:18:17,368 --> 00:18:19,949
- So what do you think, huh?

213
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:21,440
Danielle.

214
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,470
Damn it, what are you doing?

215
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,940
- [Danielle] Take off your clothes.

216
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,773
- What?

217
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,715
- Take off your clothes.

218
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:29,548
- Why?

219
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:30,514
- Take off your clothes.

220
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:31,551
Get under the covers.

221
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,859
If they were lookin' in on us,

222
00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:34,452
you gotta make this look good for me.

223
00:18:34,452 --> 00:18:36,827
- Are you tellin' me they're
gonna be watching us?

224
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:38,564
- They might be watching us right now.

225
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:39,921
Come on.

226
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:42,622
Listen, Jerry, I been in this
hell hole for two months.

227
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,034
You know what that means?

228
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:46,000
You're on my turf right now.

229
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,405
So you wanna talk?

230
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:49,438
Fine, we'll talk, but you know what?

231
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:50,816
You damn sure better look
like you're screwin' the hell

232
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:51,649
out of me.

233
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:56,118
Hurry up.

234
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,637
- Just give me a minute.

235
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:00,720
Hey, they were a Christmas gift, okay?

236
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,970
(laughing)

237
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:08,450
- I don't want to.

238
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,283
- What's wrong?

239
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:10,259
What'd I do?

240
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,567
- What'd you do?

241
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,640
It take you so long to
come here to visit me.

242
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,124
I mean, six months?

243
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:17,624
You could come two months ago.

244
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,529
(breathing heavily)

245
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,397
(moaning)

246
00:19:46,113 --> 00:19:48,363
(laughing)

247
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,861
- Hey, what about Sarah?

248
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:04,423
- Well, I think I've got her
under control at this point.

249
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:11,383
- I can't believe we're doing this.

250
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:14,686
- You know what?

251
00:20:14,686 --> 00:20:17,436
Wait a minute, let me get on top.

252
00:20:23,031 --> 00:20:24,198
In the covers.

253
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:26,880
Okay, all right.

254
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:34,076
- Listen, we don't have
much time left on this deal.

255
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:38,464
- I know, but I gotta
win her trust completely.

256
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:40,922
But believe me, I can get it.

257
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:42,839
- She goes in two days.

258
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:50,161
- Then pull some strings
and send me with her.

259
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:50,994
- Maybe.

260
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,137
- [Tina] Come on.

261
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:12,331
- Good morning.

262
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:13,164
- Morning.

263
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,552
All right, how was it?

264
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:21,858
- What do you think?

265
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:25,108
- I guess you married him for a reason.

266
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:28,931
- Do you want to know a little secret?

267
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:30,014
- Yeah, sure.

268
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:34,016
- He's not really my husband.

269
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,883
- Get out of here.

270
00:21:35,883 --> 00:21:37,884
The prison thinks that you're married?

271
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:39,103
- Yeah.

272
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:41,020
My husband is a forger.

273
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:45,622
I mean, he does like credit
cards, IDs, green cards,

274
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:47,705
wedding certificates, you name it.

275
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:51,496
Boy, we used to pull some scams together.

276
00:21:51,496 --> 00:21:54,416
I mean, just small-time stuff, but still.

277
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:58,507
That's what landed me in
here, so I don't know.

278
00:21:58,507 --> 00:22:00,520
Lucky bastard, he's still
out there free though.

279
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,902
I just hope he's not scammin'
on me with another dame

280
00:22:04,902 --> 00:22:07,319
on the side or, well, anyway.

281
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,705
So how about you?

282
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,533
I mean you mentioned that you
had a boyfriend the other day.

283
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,735
What's up with you and him?

284
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:19,046
- You don't know who I am, do you?

285
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,013
- Just another little
Kewpie doll in here I guess.

286
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:24,596
- My boyfriend was Carlos Vega.

287
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,457
He's a drug dealer, big time.

288
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:32,540
(laughing)

289
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,598
- You shacked up with a drug dealer?

290
00:22:35,598 --> 00:22:38,000
- What's so funny about that?

291
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,583
- I don't know.

292
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:40,815
I just expected you to be

293
00:22:40,815 --> 00:22:44,238
like living with your
poetry teacher or something.

294
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,504
(laughing)

295
00:22:46,504 --> 00:22:49,745
- I guess I'm not the
typical drug dealer's whore.

296
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,578
- No, that you're not.

297
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,999
- Well, you know how it goes sometimes.

298
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,422
When I was 16, I ran away from home.

299
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:04,512
And like a lot of other
girls, by the time I realized

300
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:06,908
it was a mistake, I couldn't go back.

301
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:10,446
And then I met Carlos at this party.

302
00:23:10,446 --> 00:23:12,102
I needed some money and a place to stay,

303
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:14,248
and he offered me both.

304
00:23:14,248 --> 00:23:17,915
I knew how he made his
money, but I took it.

305
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:22,245
- So then what happened?

306
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:25,292
- Well, I finally came
to my senses, and I left.

307
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:27,455
Believe me, it wasn't easy.

308
00:23:27,455 --> 00:23:30,622
- But then how did you end up in here?

309
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,942
- I shot a man.

310
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:37,359
He tried to rape me.

311
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,362
I was hiding out from Carlos,
and there was this man.

312
00:23:40,362 --> 00:23:44,889
I don't know who he was,
but I think Carlos sent him.

313
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:47,503
- So is Carlos trying to kill you?

314
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:48,608
- Not exactly.

315
00:23:48,608 --> 00:23:51,642
I have something he wants back really bad.

316
00:23:51,642 --> 00:23:53,735
- Why don't you just give it back to him

317
00:23:53,735 --> 00:23:55,140
and maybe he'd leave you alone.

318
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,002
- It's my insurance.

319
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:59,335
Without it, he'd have already killed me.

320
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,640
- I'm really beginning to
wonder about you, Peters.

321
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,057
You did it again.

322
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:12,171
Looks like you're gonna have
some company when we transfer

323
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:14,217
you tomorrow, Sarah.

324
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:17,495
- Danielle, you're coming with me?

325
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:19,600
- Good behavior.

326
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,808
I don't belong in this joint anyway.

327
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:26,797
- I can tell it's gonna be
a real cozy ride tomorrow.

328
00:24:26,797 --> 00:24:27,630
Get your stuff ready.

329
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,213
We leave in the morning, early.

330
00:24:34,808 --> 00:24:37,141
- Geez, what is her problem?

331
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:46,080
- What are you doin'?

332
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,652
Where are you taking me?

333
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,816
I'm being transferred tomorrow.

334
00:24:48,816 --> 00:24:50,622
It's already been approved.

335
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:51,909
- Not quite.

336
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:55,961
I'm not so sure that you're fit
for a transfer at this time.

337
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,878
- What are you talking about?

338
00:24:57,878 --> 00:25:00,633
You don't have the
authority to keep me here.

339
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,133
- The doctor does.

340
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:07,067
You got something you wanna tell me maybe?

341
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:12,202
You are a stubborn
little bitch, aren't you?

342
00:25:12,202 --> 00:25:15,702
We'll just see what the doctor has to say.

343
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,621
Doctor, this is the prisoner

344
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:25,750
who needs evaluation for transfer.

345
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,027
As I told you, she was
in a fight the other day

346
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,016
and was hurt and hasn't been well.

347
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:33,017
She was beaten badly by another prisoner.

348
00:25:33,017 --> 00:25:36,267
She's unfit for transfer in my opinion.

349
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,297
- Sarah Sands, is that right?

350
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:46,001
Sarah, your past medical
history looks good.

351
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:48,451
But you understand, Sarah,
we can't transfer you

352
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:51,519
without being certain
about your condition.

353
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,398
It's something the state
stipulates for its own protection.

354
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:56,188
- I feel fine, Doctor.

355
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:59,521
I wasn't injured in the fight, I'm fine.

356
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:05,475
- All right, Sarah, go
ahead, get undressed please.

357
00:26:15,435 --> 00:26:17,685
Turn around, Sarah, please.

358
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,607
All right, Sarah, I don't see
any bruises or any indication

359
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:29,319
that she's been beaten
severely like you said.

360
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:36,389
- All right, get the hell out of here.

361
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:49,339
(dramatic music)

362
00:26:59,522 --> 00:27:00,441
- Hold it.

363
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:02,274
Okay, come on forward.

364
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:09,379
Stay on the yellow line.

365
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:14,520
Come on, Peters, don't hold it up.

366
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,748
- Name and number.

367
00:27:18,748 --> 00:27:20,498
- Sarah Sands, 54776.

368
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:26,491
- Name and number.

369
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,400
Name and number!

370
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,483
- Danielle Peters, 12513.

371
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:39,594
- [Guard] Name and number.

372
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:41,677
- Margaret Murphy, 02215.

373
00:27:44,354 --> 00:27:46,162
(laughing)

374
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:47,162
- All right.

375
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:02,713
- Hey, so what the hell is this thing

376
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:05,963
that Carlos wants back from you so bad?

377
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:10,522
Oh, come on.

378
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:11,565
I mean, it's been buggin' me ever since

379
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:13,815
you mentioned it yesterday.

380
00:29:15,661 --> 00:29:17,960
What the hell is it?

381
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,169
- It's a little black book

382
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:22,640
filled with numbers and codes, that's all.

383
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,999
It's somethin' that could put an end

384
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:26,746
to Carlos' underworld dealings.

385
00:29:26,746 --> 00:29:30,631
- Oh, so that's why he
wants it back so bad.

386
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:32,880
- That's why, as long
as I have it somewhere,

387
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,339
he won't dare kill me.

388
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,503
Without it I'd be dead already.

389
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:37,962
- What makes you so sure?

390
00:29:37,962 --> 00:29:39,826
- I'm still here aren't I?

391
00:29:39,826 --> 00:29:41,493
- Well, that's true.

392
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,753
Well, why don't you just
go to the police with it?

393
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:47,007
- Are you crazy?

394
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:50,150
They can't protect me from Carlos.

395
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,813
- Well, I hope you got that
thing well-hidden, girl.

396
00:29:53,813 --> 00:29:57,146
- I do, and I have a really good memory.

397
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,060
(dramatic music)

398
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:15,262
- Hey, Chauffeur, come
on, aren't we there yet?

399
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:21,262
- [Tina] Cool it, Maggie, you're
on the second stop anyway.

400
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:02,154
- Hey, hey, stop!

401
00:31:03,218 --> 00:31:04,051
Stop!

402
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:06,843
Stop!

403
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:07,902
Stop!

404
00:31:07,902 --> 00:31:09,718
Come on, I've been in a car accident.

405
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:11,028
My friends are hurt, come on.

406
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:12,526
- We're not police officers.
- No, come on, please come on.

407
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:13,482
We've been in a car accident.

408
00:31:13,482 --> 00:31:15,595
- Look, we're not--
- Hey, hang on, hang on.

409
00:31:15,595 --> 00:31:16,428
I'll check it out.

410
00:31:16,428 --> 00:31:18,352
Why don't you call in
our position and better

411
00:31:18,352 --> 00:31:20,040
call an ambulance too.
- All right, don't worry.

412
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,207
Look, I don't wanna hear
a peep out of any of you.

413
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:32,866
This is Department of
Corrections vehicle number 00941.

414
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:35,215
- Hey, this one's got
a pulse, she's alive.

415
00:31:35,215 --> 00:31:36,736
- Come in, come in.

416
00:31:36,736 --> 00:31:39,376
(gunshot banging)
(screaming)

417
00:31:39,376 --> 00:31:41,323
(gunshot banging)

418
00:31:41,323 --> 00:31:43,849
- [Danielle] Get down.

419
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:44,682
- Hey.

420
00:31:44,682 --> 00:31:47,599
(gunshot banging)

421
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:52,154
(gunshots banging)

422
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,045
- [Danielle] Oh my gosh, get down.

423
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:56,600
- Rhodes, you all right?

424
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,561
- Yeah.
- Don't you dare

425
00:31:57,561 --> 00:31:58,746
get near that engine, bitch.

426
00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:00,507
I'll just waste all of ya
in there, and I mean it.

427
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:02,635
You wouldn't want that, would ya?

428
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:05,347
Come on, lady, you're a sittin' duck here.

429
00:32:05,347 --> 00:32:07,301
Just give us Sarah,
and we'll be all right.

430
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,134
Come on, let's be friends.

431
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,154
Let's talk about it, okay?

432
00:32:10,154 --> 00:32:12,384
Hey, you wasted my best gal.

433
00:32:12,384 --> 00:32:15,557
Now, I am willing to forgive and forget.

434
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:16,390
- Right.

435
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,385
- [Slash] Give us Sarah,

436
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:19,169
and you can go on your merry way.

437
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:21,188
- Hey, man, I ain't got nothin'
to do with it, all right?

438
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:22,200
She's right here.

439
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,432
She's right here, and I will help you.

440
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:27,792
(gunshot banging)
(screaming)

441
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:30,146
Oh man, I'm sorry about that.

442
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,026
I just couldn't resist.

443
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:32,620
I hate loudmouths.

444
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,383
Hope we can still be friends, huh?

445
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:39,751
Quit fuckin' around and
give us Sarah, I mean it.

446
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:40,948
- I can't do that.

447
00:32:40,948 --> 00:32:41,781
- Why can't you do it?

448
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:45,281
Are you afraid you're gonna lose your job?

449
00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:52,729
You guys are late.

450
00:32:55,946 --> 00:32:59,529
- [Man] Sorry, Slash,
we had some problems.

451
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,605
- Listen, lady, I got party guests here,

452
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:06,489
and you're in a whole heap of trouble.

453
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:07,548
- Go.
- I suggest--

454
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:10,686
(gunshots banging)
(dramatic music)

455
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:12,048
- Damn it.

456
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:14,106
(gunshots banging)

457
00:33:14,106 --> 00:33:16,273
Come on, let's go get 'em.

458
00:33:36,966 --> 00:33:40,031
(gunshot banging)
(tires screeching)

459
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:42,137
That bitch hit my tire.

460
00:33:42,137 --> 00:33:42,976
Well, don't just stand there.

461
00:33:42,976 --> 00:33:45,226
Go get some help, you dick.

462
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,058
- [Danielle] Come on, Jesus,
won't this thing go any faster?

463
00:33:50,058 --> 00:33:53,416
- [Tina] I'm trying, I'm trying.

464
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,476
Something's wrong.

465
00:33:55,476 --> 00:33:56,309
Shit.

466
00:33:57,242 --> 00:34:00,397
We're gonna have to go on foot, come on.

467
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:02,420
- Come on, Sarah, let's go.

468
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,075
Sarah?

469
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:04,908
No!

470
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:07,857
- She's dead.

471
00:34:07,857 --> 00:34:09,815
Come on, Peters.

472
00:34:09,815 --> 00:34:12,071
Come on, gotta leave her.

473
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:13,154
- Let me out!

474
00:34:17,608 --> 00:34:19,271
- Come on.

475
00:34:19,271 --> 00:34:20,733
Quick, down here.

476
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:23,483
(dramatic music)

477
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,183
Hold it, gimme the gun.

478
00:34:28,183 --> 00:34:29,928
- What are you talking about?

479
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:31,645
- I don't know who you are, Peters.

480
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:33,844
I'm not taking any chances now.

481
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:35,350
- Tina, I'm a federal agent.

482
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,507
Special Agent Danielle
Peters with the FBI.

483
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:38,434
- Oh, FBI my ass.

484
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:40,586
Gimme the gun, unless you
want your little friends

485
00:34:40,586 --> 00:34:43,164
back there to catch up to us.

486
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:43,997
- Here.

487
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:49,051
(gunshot banging)
(screaming)

488
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:50,446
Jesus Christ!

489
00:34:50,446 --> 00:34:51,941
Why don't you just try using the key?

490
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:54,004
- Because I don't have the
key, it's back in the van.

491
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:55,582
Now, start running, you out front.

492
00:34:55,582 --> 00:34:56,415
Move it.

493
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:04,360
- God, this is bullshit.

494
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,777
Fuckin' bullshit.

495
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,671
- [Man] Hey, Slash, you better see this.

496
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:09,732
- [Slash] What is it?

497
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,083
- [Man] It's Sarah, she's dead.

498
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,862
- Stupid bitch!

499
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:14,695
Goddamn!

500
00:35:23,794 --> 00:35:24,627
- Halt.

501
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:27,592
Turn around, slowly.

502
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:32,684
Hold out your arms.

503
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:41,816
Now, cuff yourself to my wrist.

504
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:45,631
It's to make sure you
don't try anything funny.

505
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:48,131
- Tina, this is not necessary.

506
00:35:49,253 --> 00:35:50,416
- That was the key.

507
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:53,386
So if you're thinking of going
anywhere without me, don't.

508
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:55,580
- Tina, I am not a convict.

509
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,421
I am a federal agent working
undercover, all right?

510
00:35:58,421 --> 00:35:59,608
- Right.

511
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:01,572
- I was assigned to keep an eye on Sarah,

512
00:36:01,572 --> 00:36:03,655
to find out what she
knows, and to protect her.

513
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:04,832
- Well, it doesn't look like you did

514
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:06,350
such a great job then, does it?

515
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,243
- Well, doesn't look like
you did either, did you?

516
00:36:09,243 --> 00:36:12,329
- You are my prisoner,
Peters, so start walking.

517
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:13,666
Move it.

518
00:36:13,666 --> 00:36:14,499
- Fine.

519
00:36:18,438 --> 00:36:20,855
- Hello, can anybody hear me?

520
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:25,303
- Tina, we are in the
middle of a deserted road.

521
00:36:25,303 --> 00:36:27,499
Do you really think
anybody's gonna hear you?

522
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:28,812
- Just stuff it, Peters.

523
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:29,645
This way.

524
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:33,037
- Hang on.

525
00:36:33,037 --> 00:36:35,713
Hang on, I got an itch.

526
00:36:35,713 --> 00:36:36,671
- Are you finished?

527
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:37,968
- Yes, I'm finished.

528
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:38,923
- I had to handcuff myself

529
00:36:38,923 --> 00:36:42,435
to the biggest mouth in the prison.

530
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:43,839
- Hey, look, there's a telephone.

531
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,422
Let me make a call.

532
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:48,517
- Why would I let you do that?

533
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:50,221
- I'll call the bureau.

534
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:51,199
They'll send a car out,

535
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,556
and it'll be the proof
that you need, okay?

536
00:36:52,556 --> 00:36:54,786
- You just don't give up, do you Peters?

537
00:36:54,786 --> 00:36:58,041
- Tina, this is a federal investigation.

538
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:58,995
And you know what?

539
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:00,618
If you don't let me make a call,

540
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,308
I'll see to it that you're
sharing a cell with Zelda

541
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:06,504
by tonight for interfering
in a federal investigation!

542
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:07,587
You got that?

543
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,308
- Okay, one call, but
I'm watching you, Peters.

544
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:14,436
- Come on.

545
00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:16,353
- Slow down.
- Speed up.

546
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,863
Okay, now if I can just
remember my calling card number.

547
00:37:26,863 --> 00:37:27,819
Damn.

548
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:29,037
Do you have a quarter?

549
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:31,175
- Do I look like a bank to you?

550
00:37:31,175 --> 00:37:32,470
- No.

551
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,672
Fine.

552
00:37:33,672 --> 00:37:35,247
- What are you doing?

553
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:36,307
- I'm getting some change.

554
00:37:36,307 --> 00:37:37,711
- You are not breaking
into that phone booth

555
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:40,595
while you are handcuffed to me, Peters.

556
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,022
- Fine, you're right.

557
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:44,355
What have I, God, I'm sorry.

558
00:37:45,853 --> 00:37:48,226
- I told you not to do that.

559
00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:49,059
- Change.

560
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:57,209
(lively string music)

561
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,440
- [Photographer] Hey.

562
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,773
Yeah, that's it.

563
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,713
Yeah, I like that.

564
00:38:07,713 --> 00:38:08,546
Cool.

565
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:30,925
- [Woman] Carlos, what do you think?

566
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:33,623
- Turn around.

567
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,662
Roberto (speaking in foreign language).

568
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:41,700
Gimme some stills right way.

569
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,587
That's beautiful, baby, beautiful.

570
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:44,932
Exactly what I want.

571
00:38:44,932 --> 00:38:46,477
We'll have dinner tonight.

572
00:38:46,477 --> 00:38:48,031
- [Woman] Thank you, Carlos.

573
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:50,089
- Goddamn it, be careful with that fabric.

574
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:53,002
- [Woman] Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Vega.

575
00:38:53,002 --> 00:38:55,739
- I apologize, I shouldn't
yell at you like that.

576
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:57,383
That fabric's for my show this weekend.

577
00:38:57,383 --> 00:38:59,550
Please be careful with it.

578
00:39:07,123 --> 00:39:09,733
- Carlos, it didn't happen.

579
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:11,655
Slash is in the back.

580
00:39:11,655 --> 00:39:12,738
- Goddamn it.

581
00:39:27,335 --> 00:39:29,598
(speaking in foreign language)

582
00:39:29,598 --> 00:39:30,848
- Yeah, Carlos.

583
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:08,833
- What the fuck is this?

584
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,373
Did I tell you to use these colors, huh?

585
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:12,858
Did I tell you to use these colors?

586
00:40:12,858 --> 00:40:14,147
- No, Mr. Vega, no.

587
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:18,621
(speaking in foreign language)

588
00:40:18,621 --> 00:40:19,454
- Slash.

589
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:30,868
I heard about the ambush.

590
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:33,368
Very messy, Slash, very messy.

591
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,067
- Oh man, Carlos, I did
everything just the way you said.

592
00:40:39,067 --> 00:40:40,035
I went in there.

593
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:42,702
It was so clean, man, I'm sorry.

594
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:44,993
Sarah's dead.

595
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,312
- Well then, I hope you found out

596
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:49,329
where she hid the code book.

597
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:50,287
- See that's the thing--

598
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:51,316
(sharp smacking)

599
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:53,034
- The feds are closing in on me,

600
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,914
and you come in here with
that kinda fucking news?

601
00:40:56,914 --> 00:41:01,420
I'm very disappointed in you,
Slash, very disappointed.

602
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,027
- Oh, Carlos man, I did everything right.

603
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,213
Everything just the way you said.

604
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,640
It wasn't me, it was this girl.

605
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,473
She came out of nowhere.

606
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:08,605
She started shootin'.

607
00:41:08,605 --> 00:41:10,469
She ain't no regular prisoner, Carlos.

608
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,815
She ain't no regular prisoner.

609
00:41:12,815 --> 00:41:14,789
Just gimme one more shot,
man, I know I can get her.

610
00:41:14,789 --> 00:41:15,872
I know I can.

611
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:21,533
- You know, Slash, I've
always loved this country.

612
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:22,901
My work.

613
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:23,734
My women.

614
00:41:24,684 --> 00:41:27,411
But if this bitch turns out to be a fed,

615
00:41:27,411 --> 00:41:29,974
I'm gonna have to leave.

616
00:41:29,974 --> 00:41:32,034
- I'm sorry, man, just
give me one more shot.

617
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:33,011
I can do it.

618
00:41:33,011 --> 00:41:35,011
I'll make it real clean.

619
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:38,886
- Wait for me outside, Slash.

620
00:41:38,886 --> 00:41:41,114
- Oh, come on, I'll just
go in just a couple--

621
00:41:41,114 --> 00:41:42,670
- Outside.

622
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,587
- Yeah, man, it's cool.

623
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:58,073
- (speaking in foreign language) phone.

624
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,114
(phone ringing)

625
00:42:08,114 --> 00:42:08,947
- [Man] Hello?

626
00:42:08,947 --> 00:42:10,388
- Yeah, it's me.

627
00:42:10,388 --> 00:42:11,493
- [Man] Si, senor Vega.

628
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:14,621
- I want you find out about a woman.

629
00:42:14,621 --> 00:42:18,574
Where she lives, who she
lives with, everything.

630
00:42:18,574 --> 00:42:22,565
I don't care what it costs,
what you gotta go, just do it.

631
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:25,709
Do it now, right now, yesterday.

632
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,542
- [Man] Si, senor.

633
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:27,375
(speaking in foreign language)

634
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:28,208
Si.

635
00:42:29,957 --> 00:42:30,947
- [Tina] Stupid flies.

636
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:31,780
- Hey, there's the car.

637
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,639
Come on, let's go.

638
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,431
- Help me stand up.

639
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:36,264
Thank you.

640
00:42:36,264 --> 00:42:37,097
- Ow!

641
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,391
- [Agent] FBI, don't shoot.

642
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:44,597
- All right, get out of the car.

643
00:42:44,597 --> 00:42:45,430
Slowly.

644
00:42:48,772 --> 00:42:51,845
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

645
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:53,845
Now, let me see some ID.

646
00:42:57,972 --> 00:43:00,555
- There, are you satisfied now?

647
00:43:02,898 --> 00:43:04,403
- Maybe.

648
00:43:04,403 --> 00:43:06,638
- Oh God, come on.

649
00:43:06,638 --> 00:43:08,119
- I'll go along with it for now.

650
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,869
- Shut up and get in.

651
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:14,957
Let's go.

652
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,987
- Can we go get some ice cream?

653
00:43:27,987 --> 00:43:30,777
- No, Jessica, you know we
can't because it's getting late

654
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,167
and you're going to have dinner soon.

655
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:36,169
And besides, your mom wouldn't like it.

656
00:43:36,169 --> 00:43:38,377
(screaming)

657
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:39,960
- Mary!

658
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,793
Mary!

659
00:43:42,168 --> 00:43:43,001
Mary!

660
00:44:16,455 --> 00:44:17,288
(knocking)

661
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:18,121
- Come in.

662
00:44:23,214 --> 00:44:25,938
- Tina, this is my field
supervisor Jerry Cooper.

663
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:27,271
- Glad to meet you, Tina.

664
00:44:27,271 --> 00:44:28,386
- Nice to meet you.

665
00:44:28,386 --> 00:44:30,636
- Have a seat, both of you.

666
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:37,280
Thanks John and Rich.

667
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,599
Got some bad news, Danielle

668
00:44:46,104 --> 00:44:50,187
A few hours ago, someone
kidnapped your daughter.

669
00:44:51,971 --> 00:44:52,981
There were two men.

670
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,236
We don't know who they were,

671
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:58,709
but we think they may have
been hired by Carlos Vega.

672
00:44:58,709 --> 00:44:59,542
- But why?

673
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:00,375
I mean.

674
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:05,117
- If it was Vega, he
probably thinks you found out

675
00:45:05,117 --> 00:45:07,358
where Sarah hid that code book,

676
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:09,777
in which case he's probably using Jessica

677
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:12,444
to try to negotiate his freedom.

678
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,596
I'm really sorry Danielle.

679
00:45:16,596 --> 00:45:19,329
We're doing absolutely
everything that we can.

680
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:20,416
- What about Mary?

681
00:45:20,416 --> 00:45:22,083
I mean, is she okay?

682
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:27,374
- Yeah, she's fine, she just
got roughed up a little bit.

683
00:45:31,305 --> 00:45:32,728
- If that son of a bitch
hurts Jessica, I'll kill--

684
00:45:32,728 --> 00:45:37,135
- Listen, Dani, you can't
be irresponsible right now.

685
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:38,251
At present, we don't even know

686
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:40,874
if it was Vega who took Jessica.

687
00:45:40,874 --> 00:45:43,624
Sit down, pull yourself together.

688
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:46,444
Listen, you're okay.

689
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:49,611
I've gotta ask you a couple questions.

690
00:45:51,203 --> 00:45:53,035
We've been busy since
the time you called in.

691
00:45:53,035 --> 00:45:56,242
We recovered the prison van
along with Sarah's body.

692
00:45:56,242 --> 00:45:58,600
We analyzed she's
possessed that we know of,

693
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,061
both in and outside the prison.

694
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:03,209
Her clothes, her books, everything.

695
00:46:03,209 --> 00:46:05,178
And we came up empty.

696
00:46:05,178 --> 00:46:07,251
We've got no clue right now where she hid

697
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:09,127
that damn code book.

698
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:10,551
We're right back at square one.

699
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:13,723
We've got nothing on Carlos Vega.

700
00:46:13,723 --> 00:46:17,541
So I've gotta ask you, is
there anything you can tell us

701
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:21,179
that can give us a lead
on that damn code book?

702
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:23,628
- She just told me that,
in addition to hiding it,

703
00:46:23,628 --> 00:46:25,461
that she memorized it.

704
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:29,860
- That doesn't do us any
good right now, does it?

705
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,748
- Excuse me.

706
00:46:30,748 --> 00:46:34,915
I mean, if you don't mind my
asking, what is this code book?

707
00:46:39,303 --> 00:46:43,470
- Vega is, Vega's a drug
dealer that we've been after,

708
00:46:44,524 --> 00:46:46,941
and Sarah was his girlfriend.

709
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,780
And when she felt that
her life was in danger,

710
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,826
she stole the code book.

711
00:46:53,826 --> 00:46:56,346
It has all of his money laundering

712
00:46:56,346 --> 00:46:59,117
and his drug contacts in it.

713
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:02,834
- So that's what you were after then.

714
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:03,667
- Yeah.

715
00:47:05,243 --> 00:47:09,729
- Listen, why don't you go on
home and try to get some rest?

716
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:14,212
I'll keep you informed
if anything develops.

717
00:47:14,212 --> 00:47:18,665
- Wait a minute, you're
taking me off the case?

718
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:21,078
- I'm sorry, Danielle, you know the rules.

719
00:47:21,078 --> 00:47:23,561
I can't have an agent
be personally involved.

720
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:26,966
- We're talking about my daughter here.

721
00:47:26,966 --> 00:47:29,576
She is kidnapped because of me,

722
00:47:29,576 --> 00:47:33,245
and you expect me to just
go home and sit and wait

723
00:47:33,245 --> 00:47:35,211
while you keep me informed?

724
00:47:35,211 --> 00:47:38,044
I'm sorry, Jerry, I can't do that.

725
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:41,999
- Listen, I'll have
somebody drive you home.

726
00:47:41,999 --> 00:47:44,219
- I'll go--
- Don't bother.

727
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:46,302
I've got my own car here.

728
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,947
- Tina, you haven't
been properly debriefed.

729
00:47:53,056 --> 00:47:54,681
I'm gonna have to trust you not to repeat

730
00:47:54,681 --> 00:47:56,153
anything you've heard here.

731
00:47:56,153 --> 00:47:58,320
Not a word, not to anyone.

732
00:47:59,738 --> 00:48:01,491
- That's what I like about the government,

733
00:48:01,491 --> 00:48:03,574
all those little secrets.

734
00:48:19,049 --> 00:48:20,474
God.

735
00:48:20,474 --> 00:48:22,350
I really love your car.

736
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,593
How fast this thing go anyway?

737
00:48:24,593 --> 00:48:25,446
- It does okay.

738
00:48:25,446 --> 00:48:26,607
Just don't try pegging the needles.

739
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:27,768
I just paid it off, all right?

740
00:48:27,768 --> 00:48:29,491
- Don't worry.

741
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:30,472
- You sure you don't wanna
come in for some coffee?

742
00:48:30,472 --> 00:48:32,885
- No, it's been a long day.

743
00:48:32,885 --> 00:48:33,842
I have a friend who lives close by.

744
00:48:33,842 --> 00:48:36,074
She'll let me crash there.

745
00:48:36,074 --> 00:48:37,784
- All right, just bring
it back in the morning.

746
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:39,451
- Okay, don't worry.

747
00:48:41,455 --> 00:48:44,372
You sure you're gonna be all right?

748
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:50,209
- Nothing that a hot shower
won't kill for the time being.

749
00:48:50,209 --> 00:48:51,292
- Good night.

750
00:50:06,868 --> 00:50:08,368
- I'm sorry, Jess.

751
00:51:07,331 --> 00:51:09,414
(crying)

752
00:51:53,427 --> 00:51:56,438
(dramatic music)

753
00:51:56,438 --> 00:52:00,530
- So at last we meet
up close and personal,

754
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,113
Miss Federal Agent.

755
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,602
- What do you want?

756
00:52:04,602 --> 00:52:07,362
(laughing)

757
00:52:07,362 --> 00:52:11,529
- Such a silly question,
but to the point I guess.

758
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:16,437
Carlos wanted me to tell you, oh yeah,

759
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:21,274
he's got your little girl.

760
00:52:22,663 --> 00:52:23,717
- Sit down!

761
00:52:23,717 --> 00:52:26,353
- Temper, temper, you don't
wanna lose your head over this,

762
00:52:26,353 --> 00:52:27,308
now do ya?

763
00:52:27,308 --> 00:52:29,965
Leave your little girl an orphan?

764
00:52:29,965 --> 00:52:31,953
I don't think so.

765
00:52:31,953 --> 00:52:33,323
- If he hurts Jessica,

766
00:52:33,323 --> 00:52:36,265
he can bet I will personally see him dead.

767
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:39,015
- Relax, your kid's gonna be okay

768
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:42,475
for as long as you cooperate.

769
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:46,638
- Well, if he's worried about
his precious little code book,

770
00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:48,914
just tell him he needn't be.

771
00:52:48,914 --> 00:52:49,996
Sarah didn't tell me anything

772
00:52:49,996 --> 00:52:53,467
before you so stupidly killed her.

773
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:57,784
- Yeah, we got a problem
there because no matter what

774
00:52:57,784 --> 00:53:01,284
you tell us, how are we gonna believe you?

775
00:53:02,675 --> 00:53:04,258
So here's the deal.

776
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:09,899
If you or your federal agents
come anywhere near Carlos,

777
00:53:09,899 --> 00:53:11,689
you just might find
that little kid of yours

778
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,739
just kinda floatin' upside
down in a swimmin' pool.

779
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:18,475
So I would convince your
friends just to lay off Carlos

780
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:20,017
for a little while.

781
00:53:20,017 --> 00:53:23,120
Give him two weeks, and he
can get out of the country.

782
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,287
And when he feels good and
safe, you'll get your kid back.

783
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:33,589
- Yeah, and how can I be sure
he'll do what he says, huh?

784
00:53:34,727 --> 00:53:36,394
- You got his word.

785
00:53:36,394 --> 00:53:39,432
See, we're holdin' all the cards.

786
00:53:39,432 --> 00:53:41,778
Carlos wanted me to
make sure that you knew

787
00:53:41,778 --> 00:53:46,468
that the only reason that you
and your little girl are alive

788
00:53:46,468 --> 00:53:48,483
is 'cause you're gonna cooperate with us.

789
00:53:48,483 --> 00:53:49,316
- Never!

790
00:53:50,664 --> 00:53:53,414
(sharp smacking)

791
00:53:55,517 --> 00:53:59,336
- You know, personally, I
would love to see you dead.

792
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,302
I would love to kill you.

793
00:54:01,302 --> 00:54:05,064
But Carlos, he kinda
wants you and Freddie here

794
00:54:05,064 --> 00:54:09,064
to kinda get to know each
other a little better.

795
00:54:10,076 --> 00:54:10,909
Fuck.

796
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:19,186
- Not so fast.

797
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:31,575
What do we do with the body?

798
00:54:31,575 --> 00:54:34,427
- [Danielle] I'll call a
friend, he'll take care of it.

799
00:54:34,427 --> 00:54:36,107
- Oh God, I look terrible.

800
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:36,940
Go ahead and sit.

801
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,970
You got antiseptic in here?

802
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:41,803
- Yeah, so how'd you
learn to fight like that?

803
00:54:43,095 --> 00:54:46,758
- To protect myself
from prisoners like you.

804
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:48,152
- I'm really glad you came back.

805
00:54:48,152 --> 00:54:51,289
- Yeah, I didn't think you
should be alone tonight.

806
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,703
This might hurt a little.

807
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:54,071
It's not too bad.

808
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:56,670
- Tina, I'm going after Carlos
Vega, and I need your help.

809
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:00,073
- Uh uh, you heard your
boss, you're off the case.

810
00:55:00,073 --> 00:55:03,374
- He's got my daughter,
what am I supposed to do?

811
00:55:03,374 --> 00:55:04,846
The bureau is never gonna get Carlos.

812
00:55:04,846 --> 00:55:06,468
Hell, he'll be out of the country before

813
00:55:06,468 --> 00:55:07,985
they even figure out
what they can pin him on.

814
00:55:07,985 --> 00:55:10,283
- Danielle, I'm just a prison guard.

815
00:55:10,283 --> 00:55:12,770
I'm not trained for this kinda stuff.

816
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:15,093
- Well, what about Jessie, huh?

817
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:17,242
I'm sorry, I really don't
think that Carlos Vega

818
00:55:17,242 --> 00:55:19,697
is taking Jessica out for
ice cream in the park.

819
00:55:19,697 --> 00:55:21,399
- The FBI's gonna handle it.

820
00:55:21,399 --> 00:55:22,985
- The FBI?

821
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:25,214
They're all tied up in
their procedures and rules.

822
00:55:25,214 --> 00:55:29,207
They're never gonna be
able to act fast enough.

823
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:32,094
- Look, Danielle, come on,
I'd rally like to help you,

824
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:34,417
but I mean just the two of us?

825
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:35,312
It's crazy.

826
00:55:35,312 --> 00:55:37,738
First, okay, we'd have to
break every law in the book

827
00:55:37,738 --> 00:55:39,130
to get to Carlos.

828
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:42,421
And second, minor detail
here, we'll get killed.

829
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:43,254
And if we don't get killed,

830
00:55:43,254 --> 00:55:46,159
we'll get locked up at the very least.

831
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:49,493
- Look, Carlos Vega is
a cold-blooded killer,

832
00:55:49,493 --> 00:55:52,424
a ruthless convict, and
the man has to be stopped.

833
00:55:52,424 --> 00:55:53,257
Hello?

834
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:56,139
Hasn't what has happened
in the last 24 hours

835
00:55:56,139 --> 00:55:57,972
convinced you of that?

836
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,734
Tina, I gotta get Jessie back.

837
00:56:05,816 --> 00:56:08,899
- Can I at least have a shower first?

838
00:56:18,592 --> 00:56:21,167
- Okay, this will just take a second.

839
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:22,764
I gotta bypass this logon and password

840
00:56:22,764 --> 00:56:24,799
so they won't find out I'm in the file.

841
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:25,632
- I don't know.

842
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,949
I'm not so sure we should be doing this.

843
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:29,242
- Tina, just trust me.

844
00:56:29,242 --> 00:56:30,659
- Well, hurry up.

845
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:35,215
- [Danielle] There I'm in.

846
00:56:35,215 --> 00:56:36,398
- That's Carlos Vega?

847
00:56:36,398 --> 00:56:37,606
- Mhm.

848
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:39,593
- Why's he look familiar?

849
00:56:39,593 --> 00:56:42,379
- You know, Carlos Vega,
the fashion designer.

850
00:56:42,379 --> 00:56:44,731
- You're kidding me, you mean the Vega?

851
00:56:44,731 --> 00:56:46,592
God, he does some great stuff.

852
00:56:46,592 --> 00:56:47,652
Wish I could afford it.

853
00:56:47,652 --> 00:56:49,102
- Yeah, me too.

854
00:56:49,102 --> 00:56:51,552
He used this business as a front.

855
00:56:51,552 --> 00:56:54,174
As far as we can tell, the
business is totally legit,

856
00:56:54,174 --> 00:56:56,364
which makes it a great cover
for all his drug dealings.

857
00:56:56,364 --> 00:56:57,781
- No, wait, wait.

858
00:56:59,389 --> 00:57:01,567
Looks like Jerry's investigation
has narrowed it down

859
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:05,429
to two locations that they
think Carlos is holding Jessie.

860
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:08,625
One's his mansion, and the
other is this warehouse

861
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,317
he's got under an assumed name.

862
00:57:11,317 --> 00:57:15,112
- Hm, his mansion's like a fortress.

863
00:57:15,112 --> 00:57:17,073
Heaven knows he'd be
guarding it more heavily now.

864
00:57:17,073 --> 00:57:18,162
- [Tina] Yeah.

865
00:57:18,162 --> 00:57:21,079
- What about this warehouse though?

866
00:57:21,947 --> 00:57:25,137
You think Jessie might be in there?

867
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:26,054
- Could be.

868
00:57:45,314 --> 00:57:47,677
- Well, that's the warehouse.

869
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:50,728
We should probably go
in on foot from here.

870
00:57:50,728 --> 00:57:52,294
- Looks quiet.

871
00:57:52,294 --> 00:57:53,627
- Yeah, it does.

872
00:58:02,824 --> 00:58:03,657
Get down.

873
00:58:12,016 --> 00:58:15,016
All right, now you know what to do, right?

874
00:58:15,016 --> 00:58:15,849
- Yeah.

875
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:21,971
- You okay?

876
00:58:21,971 --> 00:58:24,042
- I'm fine, let's just do it.

877
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,485
- Excuse me.

878
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:27,323
Look, this is gonna be real easy.

879
00:58:27,323 --> 00:58:29,293
All we're gonna do is go
in and take a look around.

880
00:58:29,293 --> 00:58:30,931
I'll take the lead, but I'm
countin' on you to cover me

881
00:58:30,931 --> 00:58:32,076
if the shit starts flying.

882
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:34,269
- Oh, that's comforting.

883
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:35,102
- Come on.

884
00:58:54,203 --> 00:58:56,053
- I doubt if he'd just
leave the door open for us,

885
00:58:56,053 --> 00:58:56,886
do you think?

886
00:58:56,886 --> 00:58:59,304
I mean, if he was trying
to hide something.

887
00:58:59,304 --> 00:59:01,846
- Maybe that's exactly what
he wants us to think though.

888
00:59:01,846 --> 00:59:03,346
Come on, let's go.

889
00:59:25,326 --> 00:59:26,326
- I'm sorry.

890
00:59:28,956 --> 00:59:30,361
All right.

891
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:31,194
- Geez.

892
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:36,616
- It's almost too quiet.

893
00:59:37,868 --> 00:59:39,205
- I know.

894
00:59:39,205 --> 00:59:40,705
Come on, let's go.

895
01:00:01,411 --> 01:00:02,927
All right, you stay here.

896
01:00:02,927 --> 01:00:04,162
I'm gonna go inside and check it out.

897
01:00:04,162 --> 01:00:05,245
- Be careful.

898
01:01:09,303 --> 01:01:10,581
- Psst.

899
01:01:10,581 --> 01:01:11,709
Shh.

900
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,134
- Don't do that.

901
01:01:13,134 --> 01:01:14,634
- I'm sorry.
- God.

902
01:01:16,175 --> 01:01:17,152
- Nobody's in here.

903
01:01:17,152 --> 01:01:20,040
Just some guy and a girl gettin' it on.

904
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:24,207
- I think we should leave
and give them some privacy.

905
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,104
- I can't believe there's nothing.

906
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:35,509
- I guess that means we're
breaking and entering

907
01:01:35,509 --> 01:01:36,589
his mansion next?

908
01:01:36,589 --> 01:01:37,508
- You bet your sweet ass.

909
01:01:37,508 --> 01:01:41,175
- Drop your guns, put
your hands in the air!

910
01:01:42,042 --> 01:01:43,625
Come on, do it now.

911
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:52,429
- Look, maybe we can
work something out, huh?

912
01:01:52,429 --> 01:01:53,683
I'm serious, you guys.

913
01:01:53,683 --> 01:01:57,402
Look, we do something for
you, you do something for us.

914
01:01:57,402 --> 01:01:58,619
- You know what, Tina?

915
01:01:58,619 --> 01:01:59,782
I'm sorry, look at these guys.

916
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:00,887
They don't look like the kinda guys that

917
01:02:00,887 --> 01:02:01,829
that's gonna work with.

918
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:03,017
- Danielle, would you just?

919
01:02:03,017 --> 01:02:04,556
I'm trying to work something out here.

920
01:02:04,556 --> 01:02:07,723
(dramatic rock music)

921
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:33,083
- Hold it right there, nobody move!

922
01:02:36,457 --> 01:02:38,113
This time you're over the line.

923
01:02:38,113 --> 01:02:39,839
You almost killed two of my men.

924
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,584
- Well, they should've
identified themselves.

925
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:45,026
- Don't you open your
mouth, I'm not finished.

926
01:02:45,026 --> 01:02:46,289
You completely ignored the fact

927
01:02:46,289 --> 01:02:48,566
that I've taken you off this case.

928
01:02:48,566 --> 01:02:50,913
Not to mention Tina, who
you've now got investigating

929
01:02:50,913 --> 01:02:52,878
in a top-level federal investigation

930
01:02:52,878 --> 01:02:55,446
with no security clearance of any kind.

931
01:02:55,446 --> 01:02:57,100
Did you even think of the
danger you're putting her in?

932
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,196
- Hey, it was my choice.

933
01:02:58,196 --> 01:02:59,610
I was acting on my own.

934
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:00,621
- Oh, were you?

935
01:03:00,621 --> 01:03:01,977
Well, you're not an agent.

936
01:03:01,977 --> 01:03:04,600
You don't act on your
own in a federal case.

937
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,016
- Well, I do.

938
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:08,763
When it comes to my daughter's
life, not you, or the bureau,

939
01:03:08,763 --> 01:03:11,285
or anybody else is gonna
stand in the way of that.

940
01:03:11,285 --> 01:03:13,420
- Really, were you thinking
of your daughter's safety

941
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,579
or you just thinking about your own guilt?

942
01:03:15,579 --> 01:03:18,157
Don't fuck up this case
just because you feel guilty

943
01:03:18,157 --> 01:03:19,896
about putting Jessica in danger.

944
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:21,563
It's not your fault.

945
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:23,947
Now, sit down.

946
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:32,635
Despite what you think, we
have been doing all we can.

947
01:03:32,635 --> 01:03:36,398
We've been surveying Carlos'
mansion and the warehouse.

948
01:03:36,398 --> 01:03:38,466
You could've really screwed
things up at the warehouse,

949
01:03:38,466 --> 01:03:42,133
but I don't think his
men saw what happened.

950
01:03:43,185 --> 01:03:45,550
Now, I can't help but think
that you have some information

951
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,055
you're withholding from me.

952
01:03:47,055 --> 01:03:49,138
Has Carlos contacted you?

953
01:03:50,207 --> 01:03:53,040
Has he threatened to hurt Jessica?

954
01:03:55,028 --> 01:03:55,861
- No.

955
01:03:58,926 --> 01:04:01,489
- If you have any proof
that he's holding her,

956
01:04:01,489 --> 01:04:03,867
I can get a search warrant in two hours.

957
01:04:03,867 --> 01:04:05,722
- Oh, come on, jerry.

958
01:04:05,722 --> 01:04:07,791
You know as well as I do that Carlos Vega

959
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:09,528
would know about a search
warrant before the ink

960
01:04:09,528 --> 01:04:11,963
even had a chance to dry.

961
01:04:11,963 --> 01:04:14,296
- You have any better ideas?

962
01:04:16,472 --> 01:04:18,703
Listen, Danielle, I've
been after Carlos Vega

963
01:04:18,703 --> 01:04:20,465
for a long time.

964
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:22,510
I want him bad.

965
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:25,939
Now, with Jessica being kidnapped.

966
01:04:25,939 --> 01:04:28,076
But I can't just bust in there.

967
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:31,938
We have to do this right or
we're never gonna hold him.

968
01:04:31,938 --> 01:04:33,886
- I know, Jerry.

969
01:04:33,886 --> 01:04:37,386
- Do you have any proof that he's got her?

970
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,488
- No.

971
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,211
- I have no choice but to suspend you.

972
01:04:45,211 --> 01:04:46,672
- No!
- What?

973
01:04:46,672 --> 01:04:48,339
- And Tina this is not your business.

974
01:04:48,339 --> 01:04:50,172
I suggest you go home.

975
01:05:05,726 --> 01:05:06,696
- Hey, do you mind?

976
01:05:06,696 --> 01:05:08,010
- Oh no, go ahead.

977
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:09,260
- I'm starving.

978
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:13,753
Is your boss always such a fun guy?

979
01:05:13,753 --> 01:05:16,072
- You know, as much as I hate to admit it,

980
01:05:16,072 --> 01:05:18,659
he was right about one thing.

981
01:05:18,659 --> 01:05:21,213
I was totally out of line
asking for your help on this.

982
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:23,878
- Oh, don't be ridiculous, Danielle.

983
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,997
- No, I'm serious, I had no
right to get you involved.

984
01:05:26,997 --> 01:05:28,440
- Will you give me a little credit?

985
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,023
It was my decision.

986
01:05:31,831 --> 01:05:32,664
- Thanks.

987
01:05:32,664 --> 01:05:34,081
- You're welcome.

988
01:05:37,786 --> 01:05:40,696
You are still going after him, aren't you?

989
01:05:40,696 --> 01:05:42,557
- I don't think I have
much choice, now do I?

990
01:05:42,557 --> 01:05:44,557
- Uh uh, so count me in.

991
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:50,578
- No, I cannot ask you
for your help on this.

992
01:05:50,578 --> 01:05:51,646
It'll be too dangerous.

993
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:52,935
- Well, you're not asking me, are you?

994
01:05:52,935 --> 01:05:54,774
I'm telling you, you need me.

995
01:05:54,774 --> 01:05:58,231
- And I'm telling you no,
it'll be too dangerous.

996
01:05:58,231 --> 01:05:59,717
- Will you give me a little credit?

997
01:05:59,717 --> 01:06:03,022
I'm a prison guard, I can handle myself.

998
01:06:03,022 --> 01:06:05,204
Besides, I think I sort of have a knack

999
01:06:05,204 --> 01:06:07,204
for this job, don't you?

1000
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,416
- All right, partner.

1001
01:06:15,647 --> 01:06:16,666
- Partner.

1002
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:20,083
(funky electronic music)

1003
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:07,543
- Excuse me, Jennifer,
you have a phone call.

1004
01:07:07,543 --> 01:07:08,543
- Thank you.

1005
01:07:09,452 --> 01:07:10,285
Hello?

1006
01:07:10,285 --> 01:07:11,408
- Jennifer?

1007
01:07:11,408 --> 01:07:13,075
Hi, Danielle Peters.

1008
01:07:14,526 --> 01:07:16,491
- Oh, Danielle, hi.

1009
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:19,241
- Listen, I'm in a bit of a bind.

1010
01:07:20,155 --> 01:07:21,574
I kinda need to see you.

1011
01:07:21,574 --> 01:07:23,827
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

1012
01:07:23,827 --> 01:07:26,035
- All right, I'll see you then.

1013
01:07:26,035 --> 01:07:27,368
- Okay, bye bye.

1014
01:07:29,785 --> 01:07:32,035
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1015
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:38,127
(doorbell ringing)

1016
01:07:38,127 --> 01:07:40,377
- Hi, Jennifer, come on in.

1017
01:07:41,414 --> 01:07:44,694
Tina, may I introduce to
you Jennifer Springer,

1018
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:47,790
probably one of the most
sought after Paris models.

1019
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:48,623
- I know.

1020
01:07:48,623 --> 01:07:49,635
Hi, I'm Tina Lamb.

1021
01:07:49,635 --> 01:07:50,468
- Hi, Tina.

1022
01:07:50,468 --> 01:07:51,648
- God, you're even prettier in person.

1023
01:07:51,648 --> 01:07:52,481
I hate you.

1024
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:53,314
- Stop.

1025
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,058
- You know, I'm really
sorry to have to drag you in

1026
01:07:56,058 --> 01:07:57,179
to all this, Jen.

1027
01:07:57,179 --> 01:07:58,755
- No problem, trust me.

1028
01:07:58,755 --> 01:08:01,162
I want to do all I can
to help you Danielle.

1029
01:08:01,162 --> 01:08:03,159
- Jennifer's not only
a high fashion model,

1030
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:04,585
but she also works for several

1031
01:08:04,585 --> 01:08:06,567
European secret service
agencies on occasion.

1032
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:07,400
- [Tina] Really?

1033
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,473
- And I guess it was,
what, a couple of years ago

1034
01:08:09,473 --> 01:08:10,655
we worked together on a case?

1035
01:08:10,655 --> 01:08:11,588
- Right, yeah.

1036
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:13,771
- And, at one point, it
got pretty hairy and--

1037
01:08:13,771 --> 01:08:16,581
- And basically she saved my ass.

1038
01:08:16,581 --> 01:08:17,414
- Geez.

1039
01:08:17,414 --> 01:08:19,922
- I don't know that it
was nearly as exciting

1040
01:08:19,922 --> 01:08:22,270
or half as heroic as
she makes it out to be.

1041
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:24,520
- Hey, it was a close call.

1042
01:08:25,409 --> 01:08:27,139
So here I am.

1043
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:28,633
Let's get down to business.

1044
01:08:28,633 --> 01:08:30,497
What's the plan, boss?

1045
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:33,497
- Well, I'm positive that
Carlos has got Jessie

1046
01:08:33,497 --> 01:08:34,878
somewhere in his mansion.

1047
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:37,331
And he's got a fashion
show coming up on Sunday.

1048
01:08:37,331 --> 01:08:40,149
That's in two days, so
we don't have much time.

1049
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:42,942
My guess is, as soon as
that fashion show's over,

1050
01:08:42,942 --> 01:08:45,437
he's gonna try and leave the
country and take Jess wit him.

1051
01:08:45,437 --> 01:08:47,441
- Right, so we have to
do something before then.

1052
01:08:47,441 --> 01:08:49,497
We're planning tomorrow night.

1053
01:08:49,497 --> 01:08:52,246
- Oh, his mansion's a really weird place.

1054
01:08:52,246 --> 01:08:55,313
I mean, for his safety, he's
built his own fashion business

1055
01:08:55,313 --> 01:08:58,498
including his garment
factory in his back yard.

1056
01:08:58,498 --> 01:09:00,187
- Security's really tight
around there, though,

1057
01:09:00,187 --> 01:09:02,904
but he's real quirky about
it in that he relies more

1058
01:09:02,904 --> 01:09:07,180
on armed guards and less
on electronic surveillance.

1059
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,836
- We may be able to use
that to our advantage then.

1060
01:09:09,836 --> 01:09:10,669
- Bingo.

1061
01:09:10,669 --> 01:09:13,411
- I do know a little bit about his habits.

1062
01:09:13,411 --> 01:09:16,919
I know that he always prepares
for his shows at his mansion.

1063
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:18,941
That means the models
always go there first

1064
01:09:18,941 --> 01:09:21,278
for the rehearsals and preparations.

1065
01:09:21,278 --> 01:09:23,440
Then he wraps up and
ships out to the show.

1066
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,273
- Exactly.

1067
01:09:24,273 --> 01:09:26,682
So Saturday night the place
should be teeming with models,

1068
01:09:26,682 --> 01:09:28,376
and that's our opportunity to get in.

1069
01:09:28,376 --> 01:09:29,209
- [Jennifer] Right.

1070
01:09:29,209 --> 01:09:31,278
- And that's where we need you, Jen.

1071
01:09:31,278 --> 01:09:34,278
- Wait a second, what about the FBI?

1072
01:09:35,835 --> 01:09:37,367
Good old Jer is probably
gonna have his men

1073
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:38,828
covering the mansion, won't he?

1074
01:09:38,828 --> 01:09:42,230
- Well, we'll just have to
hope that we find Jessica

1075
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:44,092
before they find us.

1076
01:09:44,092 --> 01:09:44,925
- Right.

1077
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:48,050
- Let's give it a shot.

1078
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:50,800
(dramatic music)

1079
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:14,384
- Good evening, ladies.

1080
01:10:14,384 --> 01:10:15,765
- Hi, guys, how's it goin'?

1081
01:10:15,765 --> 01:10:17,264
- Fine, thank you.

1082
01:10:17,264 --> 01:10:19,143
Listen, we had a little
bit of a problem with a

1083
01:10:19,143 --> 01:10:22,524
bomb scare earlier, so we're
having to check everybody in.

1084
01:10:22,524 --> 01:10:26,137
I know it's a hassle, but
I hope you don't mind.

1085
01:10:26,137 --> 01:10:27,717
- Well, we're very late already,

1086
01:10:27,717 --> 01:10:29,317
so I hope it doesn't take long.

1087
01:10:29,317 --> 01:10:31,248
- No, it should just take a minute.

1088
01:10:31,248 --> 01:10:34,091
- [Guard] Would you ladies
step out of the car please?

1089
01:10:34,091 --> 01:10:35,008
- Oh, yeah.

1090
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:41,713
- Put your hands on the car.

1091
01:10:41,713 --> 01:10:44,130
I'm sorry about this, really.

1092
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,147
All right, I'll need your names.

1093
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:55,531
- Jennifer Springer.

1094
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:58,173
- Oh yeah, I've seen your work.

1095
01:10:58,173 --> 01:10:59,499
- Oh, have you?
- Yeah.

1096
01:10:59,499 --> 01:11:00,749
- That's great.

1097
01:11:01,797 --> 01:11:04,022
(clearing throat)

1098
01:11:04,022 --> 01:11:06,931
Oh, this is Laurie, she
does my hair and makeup.

1099
01:11:06,931 --> 01:11:07,877
- Hi.

1100
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:08,710
- Hi.

1101
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:14,691
Oh, it's just makeup and stuff, it's okay.

1102
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:17,038
- It seems we have a problem here.

1103
01:11:17,038 --> 01:11:18,647
Your names aren't on the list.

1104
01:11:18,647 --> 01:11:19,843
- [Jennifer] You've got to be kidding me.

1105
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:20,676
- No.

1106
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:21,938
- I cannot believe this.

1107
01:11:21,938 --> 01:11:23,730
My agent just called me a few hours ago

1108
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,445
and told me to drop everything.

1109
01:11:25,445 --> 01:11:28,134
I got here as soon as
I could, and now this?

1110
01:11:28,134 --> 01:11:29,470
- Jen, do you mean to tell me that we came

1111
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:31,158
all the way over here for nothing?

1112
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:32,848
- Look, I can call in,
we can clear this up.

1113
01:11:32,848 --> 01:11:34,575
- Look, I'm sure they
just didn't get a chance

1114
01:11:34,575 --> 01:11:36,162
to put my name on the list yet.

1115
01:11:36,162 --> 01:11:37,461
I mean, can't you just let us through?

1116
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:39,675
You know who I am.

1117
01:11:39,675 --> 01:11:40,853
- No.

1118
01:11:40,853 --> 01:11:43,453
Are you girls trying to keep
me from calling this in?

1119
01:11:43,453 --> 01:11:45,776
- No, we're late for
rehearsal already, all right?

1120
01:11:45,776 --> 01:11:48,229
You know how Carlos is about this.

1121
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:50,979
(dramatic music)

1122
01:11:56,472 --> 01:11:57,976
- [Danielle] Way to go, Rambo.

1123
01:11:57,976 --> 01:11:59,566
- Hey, you guys were in trouble.

1124
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:00,402
I had to do something.

1125
01:12:00,402 --> 01:12:02,081
- [Danielle] Well, I know,
but what about the plan?

1126
01:12:02,081 --> 01:12:03,106
You think they're not gonna realize

1127
01:12:03,106 --> 01:12:04,407
these two guys are missing?

1128
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,027
- Yeah, and the feds
would spot what's happened

1129
01:12:06,027 --> 01:12:07,419
if they haven't already.

1130
01:12:07,419 --> 01:12:08,506
Do we abort?

1131
01:12:08,506 --> 01:12:11,555
- No, we're not gonna get another chance.

1132
01:12:11,555 --> 01:12:12,555
Think, Dani.

1133
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:15,388
Jennifer, you go in with me.

1134
01:12:15,388 --> 01:12:16,382
Go around back.

1135
01:12:16,382 --> 01:12:17,632
- Okay.

1136
01:12:17,632 --> 01:12:19,396
- Hey, you could say thank you.

1137
01:12:19,396 --> 01:12:20,229
- Thanks.

1138
01:12:35,878 --> 01:12:39,295
(funky electronic music)

1139
01:12:46,942 --> 01:12:48,275
Jennifer.
- Yeah?

1140
01:12:49,541 --> 01:12:51,753
- Talk about money.

1141
01:12:51,753 --> 01:12:53,362
God, this place is huge.

1142
01:12:53,362 --> 01:12:55,612
- Yeah, I know, I told you.

1143
01:12:59,468 --> 01:13:01,296
- Tina's gonna go check out the warehouse.

1144
01:13:01,296 --> 01:13:02,666
We should see him at the garment factory.

1145
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,131
- Oh, all right.

1146
01:13:04,131 --> 01:13:04,964
- Come on.

1147
01:13:06,241 --> 01:13:07,908
You go first.
- Okay.

1148
01:13:33,478 --> 01:13:34,510
- This place is really huge.

1149
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,914
We got a lot of ground to cover, kiddo.

1150
01:13:35,914 --> 01:13:36,747
- Yeah.

1151
01:13:38,256 --> 01:13:41,552
You think Jessica's over there?

1152
01:13:41,552 --> 01:13:42,968
- I don't know, we'll check it out.

1153
01:13:42,968 --> 01:13:44,135
- Yeah, right.

1154
01:14:05,378 --> 01:14:06,336
- Hi.

1155
01:14:06,336 --> 01:14:07,169
- Hi.

1156
01:14:14,675 --> 01:14:15,508
Hi.

1157
01:14:18,786 --> 01:14:20,703
- So now what do we do?

1158
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:24,624
- I think I'm gonna go
take a look around, okay?

1159
01:14:24,624 --> 01:14:25,457
- Okay.

1160
01:15:41,117 --> 01:15:42,909
- [Woman] This is the dress and
shoes that you'll be wearing

1161
01:15:42,909 --> 01:15:45,130
this evening, if you'd like
to go and slip those on.

1162
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:45,963
- Thank you.

1163
01:15:45,963 --> 01:15:46,796
- Thanks.

1164
01:16:37,543 --> 01:16:38,616
- Nothin'.

1165
01:16:38,616 --> 01:16:40,533
- So now what do we do?

1166
01:16:41,385 --> 01:16:45,135
- I don't know, I guess
we just keep lookin'.

1167
01:16:59,232 --> 01:17:03,399
- So (laughing) we meet
again, pretty lady.

1168
01:17:07,643 --> 01:17:11,001
- Mr. Vega, I redid the
turquoise low-cut evening gown.

1169
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,501
- That's fine, fine, terrific.

1170
01:17:16,969 --> 01:17:18,552
- Sign this please.

1171
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,281
- That dress, it's just beautiful.

1172
01:17:24,281 --> 01:17:25,114
Beautiful on you.

1173
01:17:25,114 --> 01:17:26,948
- Well, of course, Carlos.

1174
01:17:26,948 --> 01:17:28,459
It's one of your creations.

1175
01:17:28,459 --> 01:17:29,292
- Have we met?

1176
01:17:29,292 --> 01:17:30,842
You look awfully familiar.

1177
01:17:30,842 --> 01:17:33,118
- Yes, we were introduced
a couple of years ago

1178
01:17:33,118 --> 01:17:34,210
at another show.

1179
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:36,209
I'm Jennifer Springer.

1180
01:17:36,209 --> 01:17:37,662
- Ah, Jennifer Springer, of course.

1181
01:17:37,662 --> 01:17:38,495
I know the name.

1182
01:17:38,495 --> 01:17:39,912
Glad to have you.

1183
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:46,670
Now that we've been
introduced, who might this be?

1184
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:50,913
- This is my personal makeup
and hair stylist, Laurie.

1185
01:17:50,913 --> 01:17:54,527
- Well, don't let me keep you then.

1186
01:17:54,527 --> 01:17:55,694
- Yes, Carlos.

1187
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:25,120
- Excuse me, ladies.

1188
01:18:26,008 --> 01:18:27,687
I was just wondering if I might ask

1189
01:18:27,687 --> 01:18:30,219
your opinion on something.

1190
01:18:30,219 --> 01:18:32,105
Well, actually it's more of a question

1191
01:18:32,105 --> 01:18:34,448
rather than an opinion.

1192
01:18:34,448 --> 01:18:36,705
You see, I was just wondering
whether or not you've had

1193
01:18:36,705 --> 01:18:38,872
any luck finding your kid.

1194
01:18:41,718 --> 01:18:43,968
- You sorry son of a bitch.

1195
01:18:44,813 --> 01:18:47,146
- I'm waiting for an answer.

1196
01:18:50,027 --> 01:18:51,277
- Where is she?

1197
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:00,083
I can walk by myself.

1198
01:19:14,072 --> 01:19:15,342
So what'd you do with Tina?

1199
01:19:15,342 --> 01:19:16,261
(speaking in foreign language)

1200
01:19:16,261 --> 01:19:17,323
Tina.

1201
01:19:17,323 --> 01:19:20,356
- Ah, your pesky little friend.

1202
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:24,523
Not to worry, we're gonna
visit with her right now.

1203
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:32,533
- [Woman] They need you
upstairs to approve the dresses.

1204
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:36,031
- I don't give a fuck about
no damn dresses right now.

1205
01:19:36,031 --> 01:19:38,318
Can't you see the feds
are closin' in on me?

1206
01:19:38,318 --> 01:19:41,158
You just get Roberto
Carangelo on the phone.

1207
01:19:41,158 --> 01:19:43,329
Tell him to transfer my
money to the Swiss accounts,

1208
01:19:43,329 --> 01:19:44,837
and tell him I said every last cent

1209
01:19:44,837 --> 01:19:46,448
or I'll have Rosario blow his head off.

1210
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,281
Go ahead.

1211
01:19:47,281 --> 01:19:48,745
- [Woman] Yes, Carlos.

1212
01:19:48,745 --> 01:19:51,495
- Ladies, your friend is waiting.

1213
01:19:56,632 --> 01:19:58,090
- Oh, it's party time.

1214
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,007
Sit, bitch.

1215
01:20:13,694 --> 01:20:16,334
- Did you ladies actually
think you could come

1216
01:20:16,334 --> 01:20:20,501
into my house, La Casa de
Carlos Vega, and fuck with me?

1217
01:20:25,724 --> 01:20:28,983
Now, I thought we had an
understanding, you and me.

1218
01:20:28,983 --> 01:20:31,983
You know, I'm okay, your kid's okay.

1219
01:20:34,721 --> 01:20:37,221
So with that in mind, tell me,

1220
01:20:39,654 --> 01:20:42,288
why did the feds send you in here?

1221
01:20:42,288 --> 01:20:45,038
I mean, what is it they're up to?

1222
01:20:45,968 --> 01:20:48,385
- They're not up to anything.

1223
01:20:49,923 --> 01:20:52,914
We came in here on our own.

1224
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:55,200
Look, I want my daughter back.

1225
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:59,560
You just give me my daughter
and let my friends go,

1226
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:03,217
you can do whatever you want with me.

1227
01:21:03,217 --> 01:21:05,170
- And then what?

1228
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:08,608
The feds are gonna let me
just waltz out of here?

1229
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,100
Is that what you're telling me?

1230
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,761
- Sarah never told me anything

1231
01:21:11,761 --> 01:21:14,912
about your stupid little code book.

1232
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,098
The feds don't have anything on you.

1233
01:21:17,098 --> 01:21:20,265
- Oh, so then I should let you all go.

1234
01:21:24,099 --> 01:21:27,766
Well, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1235
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:31,382
Slash, what do you think?

1236
01:21:31,382 --> 01:21:32,574
- I don't know.

1237
01:21:32,574 --> 01:21:36,657
Little Miss Federal Agent
hasn't been too nice to me.

1238
01:21:36,657 --> 01:21:38,163
I wouldn't trust her.

1239
01:21:38,163 --> 01:21:38,996
- Si, si.

1240
01:21:41,514 --> 01:21:42,931
Doradio, go play.

1241
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:49,281
- Hey!
- Take your hands off me!

1242
01:21:49,281 --> 01:21:50,834
- [Slash] Sit down, sit.

1243
01:21:50,834 --> 01:21:52,181
- Just let her go!
- Sit.

1244
01:21:52,181 --> 01:21:54,292
- Look, why are you doing this, huh?

1245
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:56,033
What do you want from us?

1246
01:21:56,033 --> 01:21:57,767
- Why don't you just tell us what the feds

1247
01:21:57,767 --> 01:21:59,135
are up to outside, okay?

1248
01:21:59,135 --> 01:22:01,319
- We came in here on our own.

1249
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:03,619
They've taken me off the case.

1250
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:06,163
- Yeah, well, why don't you
tell us what you do know?

1251
01:22:06,163 --> 01:22:07,887
I mean, just think of
what you're doin' to that

1252
01:22:07,887 --> 01:22:11,036
poor friend of yours, not
to mention what you're doin'

1253
01:22:11,036 --> 01:22:14,358
to that poor little daughter of yours.

1254
01:22:14,358 --> 01:22:17,525
- Jesus Christ, I don't know anything.

1255
01:22:18,913 --> 01:22:21,592
- Just listen to her, she's
telling you the truth.

1256
01:22:21,592 --> 01:22:23,052
- They don't have your code book,

1257
01:22:23,052 --> 01:22:25,696
and I don't know what
they're planning, all right?

1258
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:29,192
- Okay, ladies, let's
cut the fuckin' bullshit.

1259
01:22:29,192 --> 01:22:31,008
Slash?
- Yeah.

1260
01:22:31,008 --> 01:22:34,008
- Let's take them for a little walk.

1261
01:22:35,676 --> 01:22:37,343
- Come on, Princess.

1262
01:22:38,563 --> 01:22:39,396
Come on.

1263
01:22:53,053 --> 01:22:57,313
Come on, smile at all
the party guests outside.

1264
01:22:57,313 --> 01:22:59,851
Smile real pretty at all the party guests,

1265
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:01,135
my lovely little ladies.

1266
01:23:01,135 --> 01:23:03,434
Smile, come on, smile.

1267
01:23:03,434 --> 01:23:05,643
Look at all them, they're models, hun.

1268
01:23:05,643 --> 01:23:07,398
You could be pretty too,
but you ain't gonna be.

1269
01:23:07,398 --> 01:23:09,558
Not after I'm done with ya.

1270
01:23:09,558 --> 01:23:12,611
Hey, you haven't seen my
knife tricks, have you?

1271
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:15,114
Too bad, babe, it's my specialty.

1272
01:23:15,114 --> 01:23:15,947
- Really?

1273
01:23:15,947 --> 01:23:20,677
I thought your specialty was
being Carlos' pet bulldog.

1274
01:23:20,677 --> 01:23:21,510
- Bitch.

1275
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:22,599
(gunshots banging)

1276
01:23:22,599 --> 01:23:24,762
(screaming)

1277
01:23:24,762 --> 01:23:26,527
- Get out of here.
- Get down, get down.

1278
01:23:26,527 --> 01:23:29,444
(gunshots banging)

1279
01:23:31,815 --> 01:23:34,036
- [Agent] This is the FBI,
put down your weapons.

1280
01:23:34,036 --> 01:23:36,078
I repeat, this is the FBI.

1281
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:38,347
You are surrounded.

1282
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:41,264
(gunshots banging)

1283
01:23:55,082 --> 01:23:57,840
- Come on, bitch, come on.

1284
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,772
Come on, you think you got it?

1285
01:23:58,772 --> 01:24:00,661
You come to me, bitch.

1286
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,911
(shouting)

1287
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,083
(coughing)

1288
01:24:15,731 --> 01:24:17,503
- Hows about this?

1289
01:24:17,503 --> 01:24:19,420
Take 'em off right now.

1290
01:24:27,352 --> 01:24:29,602
(coughing)

1291
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:53,100
- FBI!
- FBI!

1292
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,148
- Drop your weapons!

1293
01:24:54,148 --> 01:24:54,981
Drop em!

1294
01:25:03,769 --> 01:25:04,602
- Nice.

1295
01:25:04,602 --> 01:25:05,647
- Freeze, you ugly fuck!

1296
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:06,754
Drop your piece.

1297
01:25:06,754 --> 01:25:07,587
Drop it!

1298
01:25:17,653 --> 01:25:20,986
- Bring me a casualty report right away.

1299
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:26,031
- Let her go.

1300
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:27,468
Let her go.

1301
01:25:27,468 --> 01:25:29,444
Let her go.
- Mommy, Mommy.

1302
01:25:29,444 --> 01:25:34,274
- Congratulations, Miss FBI,
you made it to the bonus round.

1303
01:25:34,274 --> 01:25:35,724
Now, how do they say it?

1304
01:25:35,724 --> 01:25:38,725
I could kill her now or
I could kill her later.

1305
01:25:38,725 --> 01:25:39,668
You decide.

1306
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:41,335
Ow!
- Come on, Jess.

1307
01:25:52,071 --> 01:25:53,118
You know what?

1308
01:25:53,118 --> 01:25:56,035
You picked the wrong kid to kidnap.

1309
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:00,442
- Dani!

1310
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:05,240
He's not worth it.

1311
01:26:07,358 --> 01:26:08,191
Come on.

1312
01:26:09,804 --> 01:26:12,481
- [Jerry] Back off, Dani.

1313
01:26:12,481 --> 01:26:14,845
- Come on.
- Get this dirt out of here.

1314
01:26:14,845 --> 01:26:17,095
Don't leave until I say so.

1315
01:26:19,859 --> 01:26:23,135
(crying)
- You're okay.

1316
01:26:23,135 --> 01:26:23,968
- Jessie.

1317
01:26:26,058 --> 01:26:27,975
- Jessie, are you okay?

1318
01:26:30,598 --> 01:26:31,431
Jennifer.

1319
01:26:32,894 --> 01:26:34,434
Jennifer.

1320
01:26:34,434 --> 01:26:35,302
- [Jennifer] Is everybody all right?

1321
01:26:35,302 --> 01:26:37,476
- [Tina] Jennifer.

1322
01:26:37,476 --> 01:26:38,309
- Oh Jen.

1323
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:46,734
Oh Jerry, thanks for comin' in after us.

1324
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:48,549
- You didn't leave me
much choice, did you,

1325
01:26:48,549 --> 01:26:51,161
after the way y'all
busted in to this place.

1326
01:26:51,161 --> 01:26:53,994
Hey, I'm just glad Jessica's okay.

1327
01:26:54,934 --> 01:26:57,083
- I'm just sorry you didn't get Carlos.

1328
01:26:57,083 --> 01:27:01,278
- I don't think we're gonna
have any problem holding him.

1329
01:27:01,278 --> 01:27:02,929
- The code book?
- That's it.

1330
01:27:02,929 --> 01:27:03,887
- Oh my God.

1331
01:27:03,887 --> 01:27:06,434
- But, I mean, how did you get it?

1332
01:27:06,434 --> 01:27:07,267
- Sarah.

1333
01:27:08,681 --> 01:27:09,899
You know, she had a tattoo

1334
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:11,831
of a small, black rose on her thigh.

1335
01:27:11,831 --> 01:27:13,251
At first, I didn't think anything about it

1336
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:16,081
because most inmates have
tattoos of some kind.

1337
01:27:16,081 --> 01:27:19,129
But it kept bugging, so
I did some rechecking.

1338
01:27:19,129 --> 01:27:22,013
Turns out she has an aunt, lives in Texas.

1339
01:27:22,013 --> 01:27:23,611
She's the only member
of her family that Sarah

1340
01:27:23,611 --> 01:27:25,884
stayed in touch with after
she ran away from home.

1341
01:27:25,884 --> 01:27:29,719
This aunt began growing
black roses some years ago.

1342
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:32,116
She's actually quite well known for 'em.

1343
01:27:32,116 --> 01:27:33,745
There's no such thing
as a true black rose,

1344
01:27:33,745 --> 01:27:36,685
so anything that even comes
close is considered very rare.

1345
01:27:36,685 --> 01:27:39,967
And this aunt sent Sarah
black roses on her birthday,

1346
01:27:39,967 --> 01:27:42,005
telling her how rare she was.

1347
01:27:42,005 --> 01:27:43,580
And we found out that's where
she'd sent the code book

1348
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:45,249
in case anything happened to her.

1349
01:27:45,249 --> 01:27:48,940
- Well, she was definitely a rare breed.

1350
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:52,670
- Looks like she told you what
you wanted to know after all.

1351
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:53,629
- Yeah.

1352
01:27:53,629 --> 01:27:55,485
- I also did some checking on you, Tina.

1353
01:27:55,485 --> 01:27:56,318
- What?

1354
01:27:56,318 --> 01:27:58,299
- Had to make sure you
weren't a plant by Vega.

1355
01:27:58,299 --> 01:27:59,164
- Jerry.

1356
01:27:59,164 --> 01:28:00,997
- Oh, give me a break.

1357
01:28:02,149 --> 01:28:03,936
- Well, I found out that you've applied

1358
01:28:03,936 --> 01:28:06,376
to the bureau a couple of times.

1359
01:28:06,376 --> 01:28:07,713
- You know about that?

1360
01:28:07,713 --> 01:28:09,904
- Yeah, you may not know
this, but I can make sure

1361
01:28:09,904 --> 01:28:14,071
appointments go through for
specially qualified applicants.

1362
01:28:15,565 --> 01:28:17,328
- I told you I had a knack for this stuff.

1363
01:28:17,328 --> 01:28:19,168
(laughing)

1364
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:21,225
- Yeah, and I need all the
help I can get keeping an eye

1365
01:28:21,225 --> 01:28:22,417
on a particular agent.

1366
01:28:22,417 --> 01:28:24,217
- I know what you mean.
- Hey!

1367
01:28:24,217 --> 01:28:26,802
- Danielle, do you have any
idea the kind of trouble

1368
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:30,507
an agent that was on, say,
suspension would be in

1369
01:28:30,507 --> 01:28:31,875
if they were involved
in the kind of activity

1370
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:33,152
goin' on here tonight?

1371
01:28:33,152 --> 01:28:37,145
Fortunately, your suspension's
going to begin after you come

1372
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:41,147
back to the office and do all
the paperwork on this case.

1373
01:28:41,147 --> 01:28:45,314
I think two weeks with Jessica
should be about enough.

1374
01:28:47,783 --> 01:28:49,044
- Come on, Jess.

1375
01:28:49,044 --> 01:28:51,176
Oh, Jerry, can it be three?

1376
01:28:51,176 --> 01:28:53,638
- God, don't push it.

1377
01:28:53,638 --> 01:28:55,004
Don't push it, Peters.

1378
01:28:55,004 --> 01:28:57,864
Come on, let's get out of here.

1379
01:28:57,864 --> 01:28:59,570
- I was wrong, you are a fun guy.

1380
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:01,830
- [Jerry] Oh, shut up.

1381
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:02,711
- [Danielle] Come on, sweetie.

1382
01:29:02,711 --> 01:29:06,210
- [Jerry] Let's let the
lab guys have this place.

1383
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:08,960
(dramatic music)

1384
01:32:07,899 --> 01:32:10,732
