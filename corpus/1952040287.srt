2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,880
In Loving Memory of
Brandon Michael Mulvihill

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,850
and
Collin James Cole

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,380
We begin the story
on a dark and cold night...

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
...night...

6
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,050
In the middle of no where...
out in the woods...

7
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,760
...woods...

8
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:56,620
...in those woods, an old man was experimenting
in the dark arts...

9
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,140
...dark arts...

10
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,200
dark arts?

11
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,210
yeah, witchcraft and stuff

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,170
wait... I though a witch was a chick

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:11,050
the old man would spend years by himself experimenting
on corpses that he dug up at the local graveyard

14
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,890
some say...!!!

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,910
that he would begin to build an army of the
undead to take over and rule the world...

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,280
...the world...

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,300
but something went terribly wrong...

18
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,180
the corpses overwhelmed him
and consumed his flesh

19
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,200
[moaning]

20
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,170
dude... stop ruining the story

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
sorry

22
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,250
after killing their master
they would wait for years for their next victim

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,490
knock it off

24
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:46,370
after having nowhere to go
the corpses would return to the earth in which they came

25
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,970
they would bury themselves in the ground
in these very woods

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,550
can you hear them?

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,310
can you hear them underneath us right now?

28
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,400
[MOANING]

29
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,270
dude, stop with the lame moan!

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,000
that wasn’t me

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,000
[screaming]

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,760
whatcha reading Ed?

33
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,650
ahh it is 58.27 on the ecto wave length

34
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,180
what is that a class five?

35
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,370
no, barely a class four

36
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,780
Let’s book this ghost da-no!

37
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,100
It’s “let’s book ’em, Danno!”

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,630
you stupid commie
where are you from, Fakestain?

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,860
Move!

40
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:11,350
Right there fella.
For you, the war is over.

41
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,330
Alright kids this is the part where
you shield your eyes

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,140
I’m closing the trap in three... two... one...

43
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,650
How did you guys get here so fast?

44
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,790
We were on the neighborhood
when we picked up on this phantasm signal.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,780
What’s this?

46
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,300
Give me that.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You ain’t 21 are ya?

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
um, ahehem... yeah dude

49
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,540
Yeah right.
Pavel!

50
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,280
nice!

51
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,100
Ed
looks like you’re driving

52
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,090
shouldn’t you kids be at home studying?

53
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,400
dude, it is Saturday

54
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,370
you know, you really shouldn’t drink alcohol

55
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,860
Studies have shown that alcohol leads to a decrease
in brain function.

56
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,060
drugs are bad too

57
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,800
and... drunk driving and... abortion is...
...well I don’t really have an opinion on that

58
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,230
who are you guys?

59
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,840
We’re the Ghostbusters.

60
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:40,570
RETURN OF THE
GHOSTBUSTERS

61
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,260
 If there’s something strange 
 in your neighborhood 

62
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,090
 Who ya gonna call? 

63
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,040
 GHOSTBUSTERS 

64
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,600
 If there’s something weird 
 and it don’t look good 

65
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,400
 Who ya gonna call? 

66
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,360
 GHOSTBUSTERS 

67
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,700
 I ain’t afraid of no ghosts 

68
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,410
Who are you going to call indeed?

69
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,500
the Denver Ghostbusters

70
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,110
those paranormal eliminators
who protect the safety of ‘Joe Public’

71
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,430
Ed Spengler,
nephew of ghostbusting great Egon Spengler

72
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,390
team leader, scientist and television star

73
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,000
Pavel Karnov
trained by the best after the fall of the iron curtain

74
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:14,990
I like what I do

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,370
Neil Anderson
ladies man, and self proclaimed bad ass

76
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,860
excuse me, are you guys worried that you’re
gonna put yourselves out of a job?

77
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,450
out of a job?
are you crazy man?

78
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,280
as long as people keep dying
there will always be ghosts

79
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,720
what about the activists
that are rallying around the rights of ghosts?

80
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,250
look

81
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,720
I am a real busy guy

82
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,360
would you like an autograph or something?

83
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,670
the Ghostbusters arrived in Denver three
years ago, and defeated Freddy Krueger...

84
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,450
How come channel 4 gets all the sensations?

85
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,320
these guys are a joke man

86
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,870
they’re better than anything you two
have turned in in the past week

87
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,950
our story last night was great
I mean

88
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,860
the firemen prevailed, the kitten was rescued
and...

89
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,910
shut up

90
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,110
it was a story of hope

91
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
April, I thought you
were better than this

92
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,210
channel 4 is getting all the news

93
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,980
I just hope the advertisers
don’t find out about it and pull out

94
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,660
you know...
we need something good

95
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,820
like these Ghostbusters
are a hot item right now

96
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,450
Ghostbusters?

97
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,300
oh... ok... so...
I’m better than stories about
kittens trapped in trees

98
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,760
but I’m not quiet good
enough for real news

99
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,760
April, I know you’re bitter
about the anchor position

100
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,320
but I need you in the field

101
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,160
this is embarrassing chief
I need a real story

102
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,910
now...

103
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,880
there are these Egyptian
artifacts coming into town

104
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,460
Frederic’s team is on this

105
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,740
they’ve got an interview set up with
Dr. Konstantin

106
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,920
he’s the chief archaeologist

107
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,380
Frederic’s pieces are so flat

108
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,520
come on
put me on this one chief

109
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,990
Yeah!!!
give us a chance

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,650
I tell you what...
if you can get an appointment
with the Ghostbusters

111
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,040
Then I’ll give you a follow up
interview with Dr. Konstantin

112
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,940
Just like you let me have that
anchor position right chief

113
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,150
April

114
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,030
Let’s just take it

115
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,400
if we get a hold of the
Ghostbusters by tomorrow then

116
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,270
we could have the production in post
by tomorrow afternoon

117
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,590
mmm... in time for
the evening news...

118
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,150
now that would be good
competition for channel 4

119
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,650
Mr. Jenks, I really don’t think
that this is a good story

120
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,710
I don’t wanna take it

121
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,120
you should be thanking
me for what I give you

122
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,970
Now just take it,
go and do your job

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
[computer beep] Uh Oh!

124
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,460
good morning sunshine

125
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,140
you know how Ed always compares
a human brain to a sponge

126
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,350
yeah yeah

127
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,340
with the soaking up
information and stuff

128
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,350
yeah

129
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,840
it feels like somebody used
my brain to clean a toilet

130
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,790
and then tried to ring it out

131
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,480
big night
last night?

132
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,010
yeah
I hit it pretty hard with a friend

133
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,000
Pavel?

134
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,550
Jack Daniels

135
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,760
where are the guys anyway?

136
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,150
Ed’s TV show they are
taping this afternoon

137
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,290
No, those punks don’t get a day off
if they get a day off I get a day off

138
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
look

139
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,860
hold down my calls, cuz once
my ass hits that couch

140
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,180
I’m not getting up until dinner time

141
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,440
Quantum Leap reruns all day

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
[phone ringing]

143
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,080
I AM NOT HERE

144
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,200
Good Morning
Denver Ghostbusters

145
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,620
I am sorry
none of them are available

146
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,960
no ma’am
I... OK... hold on

147
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,580
Neil she wants to talk to you

148
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,390
give me the phone

149
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,970
hi ma’am
how you doing?

150
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,700
yeah great

151
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,920
look, we are pretty
booked up over here

152
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,480
swimming in specters and such
let me see if we’ve got any openings

153
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,440
you’re gonna regret it

154
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,530
it’s looking like the last Wednesday of
the month is the earliest

155
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,820
so I think I’m gonna pass
you back off to my secretary here

156
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,280
You go ahead and give her your number
we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.

157
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,120
thanks a bunch for calling

158
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,620
I’m sorry about that ma’am.
I’ll have ’em call you back.

159
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:09,720
yeah, and your number was...
ok... and your name was...

160
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,810
APRIL HUNTER

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,530
APRIL HUNTER!!!
APRIL HUNTER!!!

162
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,790
channel 8 news April Hunter?
the hot chick?

163
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,840
You said you weren’t interested.

164
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,180
the hot chick...
what she want? she want an interview?

165
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,260
she want me?

166
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,730
She wanted to meet the Ghostbusters.
I told her you’ll call her back.

167
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,080
did you get her number?

168
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,110
Yes, off course I got her number.
It’s right here.

169
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,600
alright! alright!
call her back, tell her I can
meet her this afternoon ok?

170
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,260
but Ed and Pavel are
taping this afternoon

171
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,290
Who cares, they’ve
got their own lime light.

172
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,930
It’s time for me
to get a piece, alright.

173
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,790
Besides, don’t you think I’m professional
enough to handle one little interview?

174
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,940
 It’s Ed Spengler. 

175
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,130
 He’s the science nerd. 

176
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,640
greetings and welcome to the show

177
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,790
I’m Ed Spengler, the science nerd,
and this is my esteemed colleague:

178
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,810
Pavel Karnov.

179
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,770
Now today we’ll be putting the finishing
touches on the neutron accelerator.

180
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,160
For those of you joined us at home,
don’t forget proper protection.

181
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,420
good point Pavel

182
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:20,060
That’s why I recommend a level 4
radiation suit, complete with 2, not 1,

183
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,230
but 2 layers of lead paneling,

184
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,600
a heart monitor, and a gamma ray tuned
built in Geiger counter.

185
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,940
But since we don’t have any of that
we’ll use safety goggles,

186
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,820
and rubber gloves, which can be
purchased at your local hardware store.

187
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,750
This is good opportunity to support
local business, not corporate whores.

188
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,860
now... Pavel we need to speak
kindly about our sponsors

189
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,380
Once this miniature reactor is finished
we’ll be able to generate

190
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,200
an energy field by converting
hydrogen into helium.

191
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,520
woo, it sounds very dangerous

192
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,530
it is

193
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,910
that’s why we have
the sub-atomic housing set

194
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,460
to counter the intense
gravitational field and heat

195
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,240
that’ll be generated by the process

196
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,950
for those of you following along at home
don’t forget your sub-atomic house?

197
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,170
ok, you see here, we got
the standard proton pack

198
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,330
ok, we got... little knobs here to adjust
stream length

199
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,640
and stream intensity

200
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,630
I don’t know what that does

201
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,530
uhm... yes, that’s very interesting
but could we perhaps get some footage of
you firing it for the story?

202
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,050
in here?

203
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,580
why not?
you’re professional aren’t you?

204
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,390
well...

205
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,410
yeah...

206
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,430
yeah...

207
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,500
damn straight I am a professional
we can do that, sure why not

208
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,510
alright Gallagher get this

209
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,090
I’m on it

210
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,330
you guys are gonna
wanna step back a little

211
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,800
there we go

212
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,880
a little further

213
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,360
yeah...ok.
are you guys ready?

214
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,560
oh yeah

215
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,070
alright let’s go ahead
and switch this thing on

216
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,270
alright

217
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,560
I’ll give you guys a little show
here we go!

218
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,660
ok...

219
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,060
ok.. uhm...

220
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,700
hum...

221
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,230
ah... yeah...

222
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,280
see I am a professional
you see that

223
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,350
the ceiling is now on fire

224
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,090
and I’m not worried

225
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,640
maybe you should

226
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,660
yeah
absolutely

227
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,600
hold this

228
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,860
that about does it for the
fundamental particle chamber

229
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,980
we should now be able to
positively and negatively charge

230
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,690
electrons at a rate similar to
that found in small stars

231
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,020
like Gary Coleman or would he
be considered a small has-been?

232
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,520
What you talkin’ ’bout Pavel?

233
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,370
this here is the protection grid
for the ecto containment unit

234
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,040
it’s been upgraded from the old system
and it is now all digital

235
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,580
So you keep people’s souls
in a computer.

236
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,480
well.. yeah...
I gue... yeah

237
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,310
that’s right
actually... uhm...

238
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,850
let me just show you
if you...

239
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,010
go right here...

240
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,530
just... just a second
it’s ok uhm...

241
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,590
well... well it’s... uhm
it’s fine it does this all the time

242
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,830
we should step back

243
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,660
coming back in 30 seconds

244
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:59,000
 [music?] 

245
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,180
hello

246
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,130
ED!!!

247
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,130
quick you’ve gotta get back here man
the containment unit is trying to

248
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,950
p...p..perjurate

249
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,430
what?

250
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,550
what did you do?

251
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,610
I don’t know I was just
clicking on somethin...

252
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,220
is that an alarm
I hear in the background?

253
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,590
maybe

254
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,120
yes

255
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,140
alright, I’ll be there in
six and a half minutes

256
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,840
Pavel you’re gonna
have to take over

257
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,860
what?
what should I do?

258
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,200
it’ll be easy, just
talk to the camera

259
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,330
there is only a few minutes
left to the show anyway

260
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,200
ok

261
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,560
Do not touch anything!

262
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,830
hey where the hell are you going?

263
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,890
I got to stop the containment unit
from purging

264
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,310
can’t you just wait
there is ten minutes left to the show

265
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:45,410
in ten minutes half the city
will be vaporized

266
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,150
besides I’ve got Pavel
covering for me

267
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,770
so we’ve been at this for a few years now
so that’s pretty good

268
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,550
the boys back in Manhattan
they get sued all the time

269
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,050
we’ve been lucky
we’ve avoided that issue

270
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,500
so I had this dream last night right
more like a nightmare

271
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,720
I was trapped in these movies
and I couldn’t get out

272
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,000
does that ever happen?

273
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,720
what?

274
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,770
you’re 30 seconds late man

275
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,310
I got held out coming
out of the studio

276
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,450
Neil, I’ve told you a million times do not mess
around with the containment unit

277
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,440
especially the protection grid

278
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,670
will you relax man?
it’s for a news story

279
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,710
I figured we could use the publicity

280
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,120
Hi, I’m April Hunter
from channel 8 news.

281
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,860
Ed Spengler, paranormal
elimination and investigation

282
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,010
so...

283
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,230
I suppose you’re curious as
how the containment unit works

284
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,970
actually yes I am curious

285
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,910
well, it’s pretty basic really
we are all made up of atoms

286
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,330
which are basically electrical particles
vibrating and bouncing around

287
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,990
now the law of conservation states
that energy cannot be created or destroyed

288
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,110
so when a person dies, their
life energy disperses throughout the galaxy

289
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,570
to heaven or hell or whatever
it is you believe in

290
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,020
but sometimes for whatever reasons
some of that energy sticks around and

291
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,700
uhm, that’s what keeps us in business

292
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,320
harvesting souls

293
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,150
electrical anomalies
Miss Hunter

294
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,850
psychokinetic energy

295
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,690
and with the encoder I built
we can convert those ghosts into a signal

296
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,120
and from there it’s a snap
to store ’em in the computer

297
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,170
provided Pavel hasn’t crammed
the memory full of porn

298
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
like I said

299
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,230
it’s simply erratic residual energy
left over when a person dies

300
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,290
we’re not talkin’ Dante’s
inferno here

301
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,010
and who are you to decide
the fate of humanity’s souls?

302
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,490
first off, we bust
‘bad ghosts’

303
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,790
and frankly, ‘goblins’ have killed
in the past making it quiet serious

304
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,440
my colleague is right

305
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,900
our clients call us when
they have a problem

306
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,770
if our work wasn’t satisfactory
then we wouldn’t get paid

307
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,290
so what it really comes
down to IS your money

308
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,040
look, don’t make me
your “straw man”

309
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,680
we’re scientists here

310
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,170
well...
I’m a scientist

311
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,000
I’m sorry, I’m just trying to be
the objective reporter here

312
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,010
get the facts straight

313
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,260
well then get this straight

314
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,860
around here people
consider us heroes

315
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,490
we help people in this town
and we do damn fine work

316
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,210
believe we have
everything we need

317
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,380
that’s it

318
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,060
bye

319
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,140
hey

320
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,160
wait a second

321
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,170
wait up

322
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,530
I cannot wait to see the
footage on this guys

323
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,480
I think this is gonna
make a great story

324
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,970
I think it went really
well in there

325
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,510
well, you’re in luck
hopefully it’ll air tonight

326
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,570
very very cool

327
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,640
very cool

328
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,050
you know what, you never
thanked me to saving your life in there

329
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,880
he saved my life

330
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,290
you know if I recall correctly
it was uhm... Mr. Spengler

331
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,710
that turned off the containment
system before it went critical

332
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,510
if anything you almost
ended my life

333
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,640
come on

334
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,870
ouch!

335
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,240
hey wait a minute

336
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,760
wait wait wait wait

337
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,640
how about I make it up
to you over dinner?

338
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,610
dinner?

339
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,610
- Shut up!!!
- Shut up!!!

340
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,510
I gotta a 12 pack with
your name on it

341
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,410
I’d love to, I really would but I uhm..
I gotta another interview to do

342
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,380
yeah but, is he a celebrity?
I mean... come on

343
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,820
yeah he is
I’m sure you’ve heard of him

344
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,370
Klaus Konstantin
he’s been in the news quite a lot

345
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,610
yeah, rings a bell

346
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,510
so what?
you date all your assignments?

347
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,080
no, just the ones
that aren’t jerks

348
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,810
come on

349
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,230
we’re here on location near
the ancient Egyptian city

350
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,750
of Cinépolis where
Dr. Klaus Konstantin

351
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,960
and his team have made a
remarkable discover

352
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,370
tell us about it professor

353
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,850
well sir, it would appear that
what we have discovered

354
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,030
is in fact the amulet of
Anubis

355
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,340
and what is...
what is that?

356
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,050
the amulet of Anubis is
an ancient talisman

357
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,470
fabled to carry the powers
of Anubis

358
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,340
the most ancient guardian of
the under world

359
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,980
according to ancient
Egyptian beliefs

360
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,660
sounds very... old

361
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,480
Ed, how many times are we
gonna watch this tape?

362
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,610
I’m very worried
about this story Neil

363
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,500
all right let’s hear it

364
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,470
well, I’ve been researching this amulet
that Konstantin has recovered

365
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,680
Anubis is an incredibly ancient god,
the god of the underworld according
to ancient Egyptian myth

366
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:36,860
He was responsible of escorting souls
through the after life to their final judgment.

367
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:41,070
He was also responsible for
feeding souls of sinners to Ammit...

368
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,830
the eater of the dead.

369
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,080
so, what?
no heaven?

370
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:45,990
no anything

371
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,810
being fed to Ammit meant the soul would vanish
into an oblivion with no further hope of existence

372
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,520
so Konstantin can eat souls
with this amulet thingy

373
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,530
well... sort of

374
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,090
if he figured out how to decipher it
he can open up a gateway
to an alternate dimension

375
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,080
the after life or Hall of Two Truths according
to ancient Egyptian mythology

376
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,120
Pavel, you’re just in time, Ed is
making another apocalypse prediction

377
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,130
and we’re going to be studying the find
in my lab in Denver later this week

378
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,760
Professor Konstantin!

379
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,330
what?
you know him?

380
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,000
I’ll tell you what, you stay here and
day dream about Konstantin all you want.

381
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,030
I’m hit’n the bar

382
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,340
you down?

383
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,350
you buying?

384
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
you driving?

385
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,350
it’s a deal comrade
let’s drink

386
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,360
let’s do it

387
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,120
if this talisman actually carries
the powers of Anubis

388
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,770
I’ll be interested in
finding ways to harness ’em

389
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,740
perhaps as a weapon

390
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,960
for the good of
mankind of course

391
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,780
what are you up to professor?

392
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,050
here’s the crate you
asked for professor

393
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,450
excellent

394
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,770
thank you

395
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,750
the amulet of Anubis

396
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:12,080
something I’ve been searching
for my entire professional life

397
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,000
where are the the rest of the
crates from the expedition?

398
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,690
they’re on their way
to the museum

399
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,210
well I’ll need some time
with this one

400
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,740
I’ll bring it back tomorrow

401
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,370
personally

402
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:32,170
alright
whatever you say sir

403
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,890
oh...

404
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,860
ahhh
sir?

405
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,260
I don’t know if this is something
you’d be interested or not

406
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,380
but a couple of us are gonna go
down to Chuck E. Cheese

407
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,260
a little later on try to pick up some MILFS

408
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,370
some what?

409
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,600
yeah, you know there’s lots of them that
hang out there for some reason

410
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,770
mechanical puppets or something
I don’t know

411
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,890
but I didn’t really wanna tell you,
they just asked me to ask you so...

412
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,380
you wanna do it or not?

413
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,460
some other time perhaps

414
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,060
I have a later engagement

415
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,380
wow
with a woman?

416
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,120
%$^&*@! of course with a woman

417
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,150
a nice beautiful reporter woman

418
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,280
is it so hard to believe
that a man...

419
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,090
that a man like me

420
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,390
can find love

421
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,150
no...

422
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
no!!!

423
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,050
I mean yeah but
it’s not because your crippled

424
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,640
alright it’s because
you’re not very good looking

425
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,720
and...
don’t take that the wrong way

426
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,250
you know you’re not very good looking
just look in the mirror, goddamn it

427
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,300
quiet

428
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,650
I’ll see you tomorrow

429
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:38,420
alright, stay and fondle your
little amulet or whatever

430
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:41,250
have a good time without me

431
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:51,190
so Pavel, tell me what you know
about professor bubble boy

432
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,130
I just don’t think he is a
nice fellow, that’s all

433
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,510
hey look, we’re on
television 8

434
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:05,210
ahh... for Christ’s sakes
can somebody change the channel in here?

435
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,620
I don’t wanna see her

436
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,970
hey, I know what’s up
you’re sweet on this reporter girl aren’t you?

437
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,640
what?
no way man! argh

438
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,190
no... no...

439
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,810
well...

440
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
sort of

441
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,130
yeah...

442
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,630
definitely

443
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,680
why don’t you just ask her out?

444
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,540
what the hell do you know
about women anyway?

445
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:38,610
women just like
confidence, watch this

446
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,860
hello lady

447
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,680
I know someone who
wants to beat your ass

448
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,230
oh yeah?! who?

449
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,410

450
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,150
you’re cute

451
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,300
see

452
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,900
you gotta be shitting me man
it’s the worst line I’ve ever heard

453
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,640
ah geez! Are these crack pots at it again.

454
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,200
what was that chief?

455
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,860
these Ghostbuster freaks,
they’re crack pots

456
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,240
idiots like them give the
country a bad name

457
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,400
you know what I think,

458
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,000
I think your mouth makes
this country look bad

459
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,550
makes it smell bad too

460
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,190
hum

461
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,490
what do we get here?
piss?

462
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,500
is this your beverage of choice
at this fine establishment?

463
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,510
you smart mouth

464
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,780
hey! you’re better watch
what you say to me

465
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,730
Stupid face!

466
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,150
I say whatever I want
sausage tits

467
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,200
no you won’t
sausage face

468
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,110
why don’t you uh, stop...

469
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,000
repeating my insults and adding
the word face to ’em, you moron?

470
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,570
hey, relax comrades, OK?

471
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,620
hey, blow it out your ass
your communist pig

472
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,630
hey!

473
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,810
what’s up?

474
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,390
Bring it on you butt hole!

475
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,530
what’s that thing
you’re working on?

476
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,960
well... by using miniature
micro fusion reactions

477
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:15,310
it creates quantum leaps in atoms
forming super charged electron particles

478
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:21,980
this in turn causes the protons to be held together
at 10,000 times the force in a standard proton pack

479
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,610
sounds complicated

480
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,170
elementary really

481
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,570
it’s a prototype of a
new pack I’m working on

482
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,250
I call it the neutrino pack

483
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,270
[phone ringing]

484
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,140
Ghostbusters

485
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,800
hi Annie, it’s Neil

486
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,140
IT’S NEIL

487
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,720
Hello

488
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,800
hey Ed

489
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,570
can you come
pick me and Pavel up?

490
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,620
what? you guys
can’t walk home?

491
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:50,320
not without posting bail

492
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,620
alright, I guess I’ll have to
TiVO American Idol

493
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,350
that interview...
that was a lot of fun

494
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,900
that was a lot of presence

495
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,940
thank you very much

496
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,920
I had a wonderful time
tonight April

497
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,480
that’s great

498
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,500
well... uhm...
this is my place

499
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,780
April it’s lovely

500
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,390
April

501
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,150
darling

502
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,900
you’ve been addressing
me as mister all night

503
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,790
Please call me Klaus

504
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,230
Mr. Konstantin

505
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,300
KLAUS: What is it?

506
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,680
I like you a lot
I enjoy your company greatly

507
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:35,330
I just had to do an interview
and that’s all that I really...

508
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,970
Just one moment please

509
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,950
hello

510
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,810
good evening Mr. Konstantin

511
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,070
can this not wait until morning?

512
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,850
the rest of the board wanted
me to call as soon as possible

513
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,520
what information does
the Congrie have to send?

514
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,760
they’re pulling funding
for you project Klaus

515
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,530
What!!! You can’t do this

516
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,750
I’ve only begun deciphering the...

517
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,250
the board feels the company has already
lost enough money on this project

518
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,860
they’re not seeing the
results you promised

519
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,910
I said the damned amulet
would take time to decipher

520
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,050
you’re not being fair

521
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,130
we have a dead line to meet
we’re going to go with another project

522
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,780
you back stabbers!

523
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,780
we had a deal

524
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,670
Lab Rat Enterprises produces weapons
for military use, Mr. Konstantin

525
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,810
you’re talking about some sort of ‘god stone’
that consumes the souls of the living

526
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,570
yes!...

527
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,490
and what greater weapon is there!?

528
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,580
an offer is on the table
that we can’t refuse

529
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,080
goodbye

530
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,720
sons of bitches

531
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,870
you said the amulet was for
educational purposes

532
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,670
you said that it was for
the good of mankind

533
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,400
it shows what
the hell you know

534
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:42,620
There isn’t enough money in education to pay
for a Greyhound ticket to Wichita.

535
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,250
you’re two face jerk

536
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,220
listen here you little tootsie roll

537
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,990
I’m a scientist,
we don’t work for free

538
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,180
live with it

539
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,550
you are just trying to
make a quick buck

540
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,180
and it’s disgusting,
you are disgusting

541
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,400
and what do you know? hum?
what do you know?

542
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,500
you’re just a media whore probably
sleeping you’re way to the top

543
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,900
and the only reason you’ve got this job
is because you’re so young and pretty

544
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,970
argh!

545
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,300
how dare you strike me,
I’m a powerful scholar!

546
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,080
I’ll have you, I’m a powerf... arhh
sweet harvesty!

547
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,550
Jesus!
ED

548
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,300
you look like hell

549
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,550
late night

550
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,720
so... did the ratings come in?

551
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,120
yeahhh

552
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,960
that’s what I wanna
talk to you about

553
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,630
did we get the new time slot?

554
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,450
look Ed, don’t get me wrong,
I like you, we all like you

555
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,870
we think you do a good show,
but it’s just...

556
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,620
you don’t really connect with
our younger audience

557
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,970
this is a science show

558
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,990
kids aren’t gonna be interested in this unless
it has some overrated actor playing
pranks on other celebrities

559
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,800
or pimping someone’s ride

560
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,550
this is an educational show, doesn’t the
government pay for part of this?

561
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,730
yeah...

562
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
but...

563
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,980
we also lost three advertisers last week

564
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,480
so you’re canceling the show

565
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,910
no no no no no

566
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,200
definitely not

567
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,400
so what’s the problem then
do you want me to be funnier?

568
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,630
we’re replacing you

569
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,700
what?

570
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,390
we need someone who can
connect with the kids,
someone cooler

571
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,150
someone street smart

572
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,560
someone...

573
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,690
jive!

574
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,090
like who?

575
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,620
I’m not interrupting anything,
am I Robert?

576
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,160
Levar, come on in
I like you to meet Ed Spengler

577
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,800
oh... alright, nice to meet you,
I heard so much about you

578
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,620
you’re a Ghostbuster,
[chuckling] right?

579
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,160
how are things?

580
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,800
uhm... couldn’t be better

581
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:47,200
sorry I have to meet you like this
but... hey... I’m sure you’ll get by

582
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,810
you’re soul harvesting
business is doing good

583
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,610
what is it with that term?

584
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,510
what else are you
supposed to call it?

585
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,110
the same thing we’ve always called it,
busting ghosts

586
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,530
now look Rob, I’ve been hosting
this show for six months

587
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,960
I’ve got two PhDs,
he’s not qualified

588
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,760
actually I have a PhD and I’m
working on my second

589
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,410
come on he’s like fifteen

590
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,370
actually he’s the youngest ever to
receive a PhD from Cornell

591
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,730
he’s like the black Doogie Howser

592
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,120
thank you, and I’ve written a
New York Times best seller

593
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,480
give me a break, anybody who’s
been published is on that list

594
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,680
Dr. Phil is on that list
for a diet book.

595
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,530
a diet book!

596
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,490
well... let’s just say he’s
not exactly in shape himself

597
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,850
I know this is tough to grasp
look Ed, Like I said, we like you

598
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,000
we’ll keep you in mind
for other shows

599
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:54,310
hey, and why don’t you use your ‘talents’ to
benefit mankind instead of enslaving its afterlife?

600
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,310
maybe I’ll save a soul for you

601
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,310
seems like you could use one

602
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:08,270
ser setam shamzoozoo nerhuntai
umpatcha

603
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,810
nah furie shahm shahvin

604
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:17,640
Ammit sudin je Klaus Konstantin

605
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:25,530
miri hi ni pertet

606
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:30,660
I request the power and accept the burden

607
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:35,040
Anubis, god of the two halls

608
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,610
I request the power and accept the burden

609
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,730
damn it

610
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,270
what’s wrong here?
I did everything

611
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,470
I deciphered the language

612
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,070
of course

613
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,290
I need to power the amulet

614
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,240
and the only way to do that
is with a celestial sacrifice

615
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,510
of course

616
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,890
a human soul

617
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,100
not something I can pick
up at the super market

618
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,360
or Seven Eleven

619
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,120
and how long can I contain
it for as long as I need it

620
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,490
...trap the ghosts then we can store ’em in this
containment facility as long as necessary

621
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,650
actually, indefinitely if need be

622
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,970
Ghostbusters

623
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,190
there, now that’s news

624
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,620
April your ratings are up

625
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,500
hardly, I mean that story was nothing

626
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,130
all we had to do was point the camera and
that idiot blabbermouth did the rest

627
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,580
they were cool though

628
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,710
yeah... so what’s next chief?
something a little bit more exciting?

629
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,840
next? this is a gold mine,
people can’t get enough of this stuff

630
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,000
I want you to go back to these folks

631
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,950
back?

632
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,050
hell yes

633
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,960
this is a gold mine

634
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,800
I wanna week long exposé

635
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,680
I want to show the city what is like
to be a Ghostbuster for a week

636
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,690
no! no no no no

637
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,800
you sent Frederic to Egypt you made Adam anchor
what do they have that I don’t?

638
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,390
April, you’ll get your chance yet

639
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,450
now just do your job,
go out there, dig up some dirt

640
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,870
so this is all about
making them look bad?

641
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,290
no, it’s about business

642
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,440
this isn’t right

643
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:32,290
- It’s not about right or wrong it’s...
- I just don’t like the idea of making them look bad

644
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,310
hell...

645
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,590
April, I’m trying to do you a favor, this is good stuff,
I want you to be out there I want you to...

646
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:45,940
ok April, if you do this for me, I’ll make
you anchor by the end of the month

647
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,350
anchor... wow...
I just...

648
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,240
now go, go do your job ok?

649
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,790
and show some enthusiasm, will you?

650
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,030
oh, I’m enthused

651
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,740
greetings

652
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,070
oh...hello!
may I help you?

653
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,830
yes, I’m here to see the Ghostbusters

654
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,940
ok... well they’re on a case right now
would you like to make an appointment?

655
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,010
yes, what’d you have at the earliest?

656
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,630
well... ah... let’s see here,
they’re pretty busy

657
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,620
it looks like

658
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,170
the first available would be next Thursday

659
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:33,520
ssssssssssleeeeep

660
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,900
it’s beautiful

661
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,750
he hey! buddy!

662
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,020

663
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,800
change?

664
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:09,080
yeah! you know nickels, dimes, quarters...
you know, anything like that would be great

665
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,940
oh god! you’re repulsive

666
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,270
I’m not picky so...

667
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,070
why you ask a man in crippled,
a cripple man for change!?

668
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,300
why don’t we see what this thing is?

669
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,640
I have seen one of those,
is there money in there?

670
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,720
you should be the first to find out

671
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,320
disgusting man

672
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,620
I have your pathetic soul

673
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,090
my first one

674
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,200
hahahaha

675
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,000
[chanting]

676
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:59,310
with this offering, I accept the gift and the
burden of some of your great power

677
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,660
hahahaha...

678
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,800
Ha Hahahaha!...

679
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:40,000
hoh, oh Hahahahaha!

680
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha...

681
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,560
wo, wo, wo, whoa

682
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,150
let me try the new pack this time

683
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,040
I don’t think so I still to test a bit

684
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,380
come on man, why do
you getta have all the fun?

685
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:11,450
look, I’m taking a big enough risk by bringing it
here already with all the press coverage we’ve been getting

686
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,660
that’s such a BS
you know what?

687
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,450
just let me try the new pack,
I mean what’s the worst that could happen?

688
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:21,870
look, this is not a piece of equipment to toy with
if it goes critical it could detonate a 60 gigaton explosion

689
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,220
or worse

690
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,850
collapse on to its self creating matter so
dense that it becomes a black hole

691
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,740
why is it that every time we get a new piece
of equipment, you dive into the science talk?

692
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,160
all I wanna do is try out the new pack
and I don’t see what the big deal is

693
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,270
come on Ed, just let him try it

694
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,250
even Pavel!, come on man

695
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,810
alright, alright
I just want you to take it seriously

696
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,810
I take everything seriously, you know that

697
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,470
serious is my middle name

698
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,370
thank god you guys are here

699
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,080
how many are there?

700
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:55,140
uhm, more than one for sure... uhm
this isn’t too much trouble, is it?

701
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,600
only for your bank account pal

702
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:00,500
I’m sorry, there is a “no smoking” in here

703
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,410
thanks

704
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,550
my P.K.E. integrated cellphone
seems to be malfunctioning

705
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,010
what’s the matter?
you ran out of minutes there, jack ass?

706
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,220
It definitely is a strong signal

707
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,280
Pavel!
use your ecto motion tracker

708
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,310
right

709
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:38,010
I’ve got something here

710
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,020
multiple signals, front and behind

711
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,060
what? where man?
I don’t see anything

712
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,210
look sharp people

713
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,430
they’re closing

714
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,370
there

715
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,390
good evening

716
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:24,700
please forgive me for my intrusion
I promise to be brief

717
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,910
yes

718
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,700
damn it, you go that way, I’ll go this way

719
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,490
you could just told me, gee

720
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,030
Neil, you wait here

721
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:13,930
hello, channel 8?

722
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,740
you might wanna send someone down
to the Mayan Theater

723
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,230
quickly

724
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,210
the Ghostbusters are
attacking the staff

725
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,880
noooo, the Ghostbusters

726
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:28,780
no the Ghostbusters,
they’re attacking t...

727
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,770
Ghostbusters

728
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,180
they’re taking their
god damned souls

729
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,360
Ed, we might have something here

730
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,620
what is it?

731
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,970
a whole bunch of ectoplasm

732
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,830
yeah, I’ve got some in here as well

733
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,790
yeah, there’s a lot here

734
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,800
on the ceiling

735
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:26,630
well, what’s a lot?
we’ve seen loads of this stuff before

736
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,310
it’s... bubbling?

737
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,060
is that a question or an observation?

738
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,240
goddamn I’m good

739
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,270
Neil,
quick turn down the electron flow

740
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,470
where?

741
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,580
You IDIOT!

742
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,590
what happened?

743
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,040
You just completely destroyed a SOUL!

744
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,500
- destroyed?- I told you to turn it DOWN!

745
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,230
I don’t know how to work
this goddamned thing

746
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,070
Can you comprehend the implications
of what you just did?

747
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,260
You just completely obliterated a soul!

748
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:27,130
well, it was bad right?

749
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,550
ED!

750
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,460
Ed come on!

751
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:42,410
an unknown source has claimed that
the Ghostbusters are responsible for putting
the employees of this theater into comas

752
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,390
however...

753
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,470
comas?

754
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,660
one of our packs malfunctioned
and destroyed a ghost

755
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,980
so the Ghostbusters are
now murdering spirits

756
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,610
wait a second, that was an accident

757
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,830
April, what the hell are you doing?

758
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,210
I’m doing my job, just like you

759
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,200
Do you know anything about these comas?

760
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,640
look, I don’t know what the hell went on out here.

761
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:10,760
That was the scene downtown tonight
when the Ghostbusters started attacking innocent people.

762
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Uh, the new pack wasn’t thoroughly tested, and it
somehow malfunctioned, and a soul was destroyed.

763
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,400
It was my fault really. I just
should have tested it more thoroughly.

764
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:27,100
Ed Spengler, leader of the Denver Ghostbusters,
also built the machine that destroyed the ghost.

765
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:31,100
Ed and team have been under scrutiny,
questioning the ethics behind what they do.

766
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,800
And tonight’s instant has caught the
attention of the federal government,

767
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:40,800
Who will reportedly seek to pass legislation on
“ghostbusting”, as well as dealings with the afterlife.

768
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,700
Get that [beep] camera out of my face!

769
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,700
A cease and desist has already been
ordered on the Denver Ghostbusters.

770
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:53,200
As more coma victims continue
to pile up across the city.

771
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,500
April

772
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:02,200
What’s the deal wh..Why are
you trying to make us look bad.

773
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:05,000
It’s nothing personnel Neil, it’s just the news.

774
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,300
Yeah, it’s just bad news.

775
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah well, bad news is the only type of news that sells OK.

776
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:15,300
People don’t like hearing about happy stories

777
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:22,000
They like hearing about stories that make their
miserable little lives seem a little bit better.

778
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,500
What really happened in there Neil?

779
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:33,500
I don’t know. We came down here. It was a routine bust.
come outside, and this

780
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,500
Everybody thinks we’re...

781
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,760
bad.

782
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:39,500
I don’t think that you’re that bad.

783
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,900
Then why do the story?

784
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:48,000
I don’t... I don’t kn... my boss, he just
thinks that this will help my career and I jus...

785
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,300
Alright... alright.

786
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,000
Why don’t we just...

787
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,100
Why don’t we talk about it over...

788
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
dinner.

789
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
What do we want?...
GHOST RIGHTS!!

790
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:04,100
When do we want it?...
NOW!!

791
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,000
What do we want?...
GHOST RIGHTS!!

792
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,800
When do we want it?...
NOW!!

793
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
[Indistinct]

794
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:25,000
[yelling]

795
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,300
Hey!

796
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,400
You awake?

797
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:55,700
Oh... uh, I must’ve dosed off.

798
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:57,990
You better go home and get some sleep.

799
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Yeah.

800
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,530
Hey!... where are you going?

801
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,730
Ahh.. Can it MacGyver! I don’t
need anymore of your crap.

802
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,730
I’m taking April to dinner.

803
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,060
Oh, oh, hurts dunn’t!

804
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,900
Ohhh!

805
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,000
[Ding]

806
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
[Thunder]

807
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,930
What, no Jaguar?

808
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,100
It’s in the shop.

809
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,000
Oh, OK, thanks.

810
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
[Thunder]

811
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,000
Sparks in the air tonight.

812
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,400
Dropping off or picking up?

813
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:48,860
Um, neither...

814
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:52,300
Uh, good evening ma’am, this is uh, Agent J.

815
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:55,260
I’m Agent K. We’d like to ask you a few questions.

816
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,660
We found this man behind your establishment.

817
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,200
Did anybody see or hear anything this evening?

818
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:10,000
No, I was playing video games all night, and earlier
I was watching ‘Batman and Robin’, and then before...

819
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,800
I’m not looking for an alibi tonight ma’am.
I’m just look’n to ask ya a few questions.

820
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:19,260
Wait, ‘Batman and Robin’? The television
show or the crappy George Clooney movie?

821
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:21,500
I didn’t think it was that bad!

822
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:26,060
Oh please... all the cool, icy, chill, freeze, analogies.

823
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:29,000
My god, the bat suit had nipples on it!

824
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:33,200
Ok... First of all, we need to get this man to a hospital.

825
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:34,300
Second!...

826
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:37,500
Any movie with Uma Thurman
in it is ok in my book man.

827
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:45,600
We’re gonna need an ambulance at 7345
South Seventeenth Street. I got a 10-20...

828
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,500
I got a 10-Fif...

829
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:53,000
What’s the code for comatose?

830
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,500
I got a coma guy!

831
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
This is very strange.

832
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,150
I’m getting a zero-point-zero reading on the P.K.E. Meter

833
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,470
What does that mean?

834
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,280
The P.K.E. Meter detects even the
slightest amount of psycho kinetic energy.

835
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:13,930
Every living soul on the planet
emits at least some signal.

836
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,000
This man...

837
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,500
He has no soul.

838
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,000
What is he, a politician?

839
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:25,000
No, it appears that someone or
some...thing has stolen this man’s soul.

840
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,790
I’d like to get him inside, I could do a few tests.

841
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,090
No can do doc, we got the
ambulance on the way right now.

842
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,500
This guy appears to be in the same condition
that the other were at the Mayan Theatre.

843
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,650
Are they alright? I haven’t heard anything.

844
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,800
They’re all down at St. Mary’s

845
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:42,000
- They’re still alive but...
- Sleep’n it off like this guy.

846
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,830
I’m afraid this doesn’t look to good for your company sir.

847
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,000
I swear, I had nothing to do with this.

848
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,600
If I can get him inside, I could run a
few tests and I can figure all of this out

849
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,100
Murderers!

850
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,500
Mess’n with ghosts isn’t good enough,
now you have to mess with the living.

851
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,820
Wait right here.

852
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,150
So, should we take the body inside?

853
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,160
Yep.

854
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,400
Hey well, I had a great time tonight.

855
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:26,670
I did too. We should get together and do it again sometime.

856
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,570
Definitely, only I pick the place next time. Ok?

857
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,850
- What, no fish tacos?
- No, no fish tacos! [Laughing]

858
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:34,850
Those were good!

859
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:40,830
Yeah, I’m thinking something a little
bit more authentic. Italian maybe... candles?

860
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah, we can do that.

861
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,500
But hey, I’m tired, I’m gonna get to bed.

862
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,100
Yeah I...

863
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,800
I got stuff to do too, so.

864
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,740
Ok

865
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,000
- night
- good night

866
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,300
Oh, hey, drive careful

867
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:02,800
Hey, it’s me!

868
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,800
Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about.

869
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,000
Bye

870
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,600
Hey I saw that you pussy.
Too lame to go in for the kiss?

871
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
I..I’m not lame!

872
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,000
Yeah, whatever. Bet you haven’t been laid in years.

873
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,100
NEIL: kiss my sack!

874
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,500
You don’t wait long to get back on the wagon, do you?

875
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,500
How the hell did you get in here?

876
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,300
The window was open.

877
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,600
I’m calling the cops.

878
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:40,300
I’ve decided to give you one last chance...

879
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,000
To join me!

880
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,500
Your legs...

881
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,420
Lying about secret weapon contracts is one thing...

882
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:54,200
Pretending to be in a wheelchair is just desp...

883
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,570
I am offering you one last chance to be my QUEEN!

884
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,700
Forget it! Get out of here, you freak!

885
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,900
Alright...

886
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
But first there’s something I’d like to show you.

887
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,000
How the hell did you get that!

888
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,900
I’m calling the police.

889
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,100
They cannot help you.

890
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:18,000
No!...No!... NO!...NO!

891
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,620
Hey, what’s going on in here?

892
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,000
Miss Hunter, you ok?

893
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:24,000
I’m fine! He was just leaving!

894
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,300
Good day

895
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:27,900
Sorry for interrupting, it sounded
like something was going on in here.

896
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
No, everything’s fine now thank you.

897
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:36,100
Can you please make sure that that gentleman
finds his way out of the building completely.

898
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,500
Will do.

899
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,000
Hey! You!

900
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,700
Sir, I’m gonna hafta ask you to leave the building.

901
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,700
I don’t know what the problem is!?
I was just trying to show her something.

902
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:54,500
I don’t think she’ll wanna see anything you’ve gotta show her.

903
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,110
Well then perhaps, you’d like to see.

904
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,000
Hey, good morning boys.

905
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,000
April! What are doing here?

906
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,100
Good morning lady. I’m making blintza

907
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:10,000
Yeah, you wanna stay for breakfast?

908
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,450
Sure.

909
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,600
And this morning my superintendent
was unconscious in the hallway.

910
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:37,800
It’s strange, Konstantin is walking now too.

911
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:40,600
So, your saying that Konstantin has one of our traps?

912
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:42,140
That’s what it looked like, yes.

913
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:44,690
If Konstantin has one of our traps he
may be able to figure out how to use...

914
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:50,000
Wait wait wait. Ya know, I heard that if you look into
that thing while it’s closing it can make you impotent.

915
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,500
What, like you can’t go when you need to?

916
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:53,600
That’s incontinence.

917
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,000
I think you get that too.

918
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:57,000
- Is that true?
- Ask Ed.

919
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,100
Ed, are you impotent?

920
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,600
Dr. Stantz’s theory is that the
eyes are a window into the soul.

921
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,000
Therefore if a living person were to
look into the trap, as it was closing,...

922
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:09,500
It could steal their life
essence, rendering that person...

923
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,000
What! A flesh craving zombie Ed?

924
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,950
In a comatose state.

925
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:14,950
Pavel?

926
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,960
What!?

927
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:19,900
Do you think that Konstantin would ever
intentionally steal a person’s soul?

928
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:23,050
Wait a minute, why the hell would he know?

929
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,600
I think he would do anything to unlock his amulet.

930
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,210
I knew it!

931
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,800
I knew you knew more than than
you wanted me to know you knew.

932
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,400
What do you know?

933
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,000
Pavel is a former student of Konstantin’s

934
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,900
What the hell is going on here Pavel?

935
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:38,000
Are you working for him?

936
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:41,550
So what, Ed gets to know about your past,
and you keep it a secret from me?

937
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,860
I didn’t think it was big deal.

938
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:46,020
Big deal!? This guy’s stealing
souls, for Christ’s sake.

939
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,800
And as far as I’m concerned, you’re an accomplice.

940
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,500
And you! You son of a bitch,
you coulda clued me in on this.

941
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,000
- Please, calm down.
- No! This is bullshit!

942
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,200
I take enough of Ed’s crap,
i don’t need it from you too.

943
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:59,260
Neil, there are more important things
going on here than you and your ego.

944
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:01,600
Ego!...
you think I have an ego.

945
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:03,800
Why don’t we ask her,
do I have an ego?

946
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,600
Well...a...it’s...just

947
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:12,000
Oh that’s just great! I guess I’ll
take me and my ego and get outa here.

No it’s not you fault.

951
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:25,300
Along with the city revoking our business,
now, I’ve driven Neil away.

952
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,500
Did the bureaucrats take all of your equipment?

953
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,000
Well, we still have the neutrino pack and a couple of traps...

954
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,400
And I’m very thankful that for now they
haven’t touched the containment unit.

So let me get this straight.

964
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:23,220
Some madman, with the powers of
the underworld has summoned...

965
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,000
Some thing!

966
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:27,800
That’s gonna devour every soul on the planet.

But this... this is not gonna happen in Denver.

971

This doesn’t really happen anywhere, mayor.

972
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,810
And soon it could be everywhere.

973

976
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:50,800
First we need to evacuate this area of the city.

977
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:55,600
The psycho kinetic readings for these coordinates are
off the charts. If we could isolate the threat here...

978
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,000
Done, what else do you need.

979
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,500

Look kid, if it’s all the same to you, I’d really
just prefer not to be bothered right now. Ok?

I...

988
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,450
I had a fight with some friends, is all.

989
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,500
My father says that fighting builds character.

Well, I havta go. We’re leaving the city.

downtown Denver, a “soul-nado” if you will.

Denver at this point has been evacuated,
the mayor has sent out another warning...

01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Alright, closing trap.

1107
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,600
What!

1108
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:37,550
No, this can’t be!?

1109
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,000
NO! Those souls are MINE!

1110
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,000
MINE!!!

1111
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
[Growling]

1112
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:05,100
Ha! It’s too late!

1113
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,000
The portal cannot be stopped!

1114
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,900
[Roaring!]

1115
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,500
Blastage!

1116
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,700
Now Lavar!

1117
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:24,200
Here goes nothing.

1118
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,700
Go full stream

1119
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,000
It’s hopeless!

1120
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,000
[Roaring]

1121
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,900
Bad dog!
No Biscuit

1122
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,000
[screaming]

1123
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,000
Don’t let him get into the portal!

1124
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,400
There’s enough energy in that
alternate dimension to fuel his amulet.

1125
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:30,400
If he gains enough power,
he’ll be able to keep it open permanently.

1126
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:33,500
eh no. This never ends, so what do we do?

1127
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,400
Ed!

1128
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:37,700
Let me think a second!

1129
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:39,500
Ed, there’s something wrong with this thing!

1130
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:42,000
Oh No! The pack’s gone critical, it’s overloading!

1131
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:43,600
What the hell does that mean?

1132
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:47,800
The sub-atomic housing is overheated. The matter
is beginning to collapse into the antimatter.

1133
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:49,300
That’s BAD, right?!

1134
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:50,900
For THIS dimension.

1135
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,600
yes

1136
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,300
Yes!

1137
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:59,300
YES!!

1138
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:01,200
Unlimited Power!

1139
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,500
Unlimited Power!

1140
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,500
[screaming]

1141
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,500
YES!

1142
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,000
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters!

1143
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,400
Dy-no-mite!

1144
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,000
oh... Oh, this better be on YouTube tomorrow!

1145
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,100
It looks like the world will keep it’s souls after all.

1146
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,900
atta girl!
Oh she’s goood!

1147
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,400
I knew you’d be back Neil.

1148
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
well...

1149
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,100
I guess I couldn’t let you steal my limelight, could I!

1150
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,000
ahh..

1151
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:05,000
Oh! God! yeah

1152
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:07,700
Hug, precisely what I was thinking.
alright

1153
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:11,800
Hell no!

1154
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:12,820
no

1155
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,790
Good work Lavar!

1156
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,800
Thanks, Ed. You know, I was wrong about you.

1157
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,900
Pavel, I’m really glad you’re one of the good guys.

1158
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,600
Hey man! What do you think happened to Konstantin?

1159
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,700
Well...

1160
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:35,200
He’s Toast!

1161
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,200
There is still no sign of the Ghostbusters
who hours ago entered the strange building.

1162
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,500
and we have still not...
Here they come now.

1163
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,800
What was it like in there?

1164
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:51,060
Well I gotta tell ya...
that... was a close one!

1165
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:55,600
uh, The threat has been eliminated. all we havta
do is return these souls to their rightful owners.

1166
01:14:55,610 --> 01:15:01,600
I’m gonna do a special on my show of
how Lavar Gorden almost died... twice.

1167
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:04,400
I think I will go to Disneyland.
Hi Mother.

1168
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,420
Were there any human casualties?

1169
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,500
uh, the cripple.

1170
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,600
Nobody cares about him.

1171
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:18,630
Ya know, What’s important is that we get
these souls back to their rightful owners.

1172
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:24,400
and Ed here, is gonna describe the
device that’s gonna do, just that.

1173
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,300
oh um...

1174
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:33,900
yeah I created a device that uh captures psycho
kinetic energy and polarizes it so that uh...

1175
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:38,400
you can use the electromagnetic
aura that is a residual, um, result tu...

1176
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,600
[sigh] I’m just bullshitting...
can you edit this out later?

1177
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,600
Ed, we’re live.

1178
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,400
uh um, as I was saying psycho kinet...

1179
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:51,500
What are your feelings now that you’ve come out OK?

1180
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:55,560
You know what, that’s... that’s...
that’s enough OK.

1181
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:58,600
There’s no feelings...
and there’s no more pictures.

1182
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,700
We’re going home, we’re tired.
Guys we’re outa here.

1183
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,800
I will call you...
maybe...

1184
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:09,800
Thought we were getting to be their friends.

1185
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,000
And the day is once again
saved by the Ghostbusters.

1186
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:18,000
I’m April Hunter from Channel 8 News, reminding you...

1187
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:19,800
Don’t be afraid of no ghosts!

1188
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:26,100
Clean up crews will be working around the clock,
cleaning up the rubble from last night’s epic battle.

1189
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:30,000
Turns out that the Ghostbusters
were ALWAYS on our side...

1190
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:33,600
as I pointed out months ago...
or weeks...

1191
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:36,300
Depending on what type of calendar you use.

1192
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:39,800
Welcome back to “Science of the Universe”.
