1
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,212
L.A. La La land?

2
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:21,405
Are you going to go all Hollywood on us?

3
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,539
C- ment ponds, movie stars.

4
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,674
Don't forget to write.

5
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,875
He already did forget to write.

6
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,055
The neighborhood's not going to
be the same without you guys.

7
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,363
Eesh.

8
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,231
Okay.

9
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,363
So, let's do it then, right?

10
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,228
Right.

11
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,803
Okay.

12
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,745
We made it.

13
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,548
So this is it.

14
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,384
Oh, Kevin.

15
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,260
Hello, home.

16
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,330
This place could use an open window or two.

17
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,137
Kevin...?

18
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,575
Oh, Christ.

19
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,514
Did Joe and Miranda vaporize or something?

20
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,390
We have our work cut out for us.

21
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,886
You ready to finally see
what we bought in the flesh?

22
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,898
Yeah. I'm curious to see
how much their photos lied.

23
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,002
Ta Da!

24
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,805
Wow.

25
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,708
Wow. Am I dreaming?

26
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,810
Instant house.

27
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,473
Their running out of time really worked out for us.

28
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,616
I'd say so.

29
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,882
Hi.

30
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,287
Hello. I'm Kevin.

31
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,755
Kevin, great to meet you.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

32
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:18,685
Rachel.

33
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:19,755
Nolan.

34
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:20,416
Oh yeah... Okay.

35
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,757
I've got your phone number. Miranda
gave it to me along with some others.

36
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,864
Rlght. So, let me help.

37
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,030
Thanks. We could use it.

38
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,794
No problem.

39
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,137
I'm going to clean the refrigerator.

40
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,341
You can thank me later.

41
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,715
Oh you can put that against the side wall.

42
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,950
There's still a bunch of Joe
and Miranda's stuff in here.

43
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,687
Right.

44
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,425
These are dishes. Just put them here for now?

45
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,391
That's fine.

46
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,595
Neighbors.

47
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,764
Yah.

48
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:01,791
Hey.

49
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,868
Hey. I'm Julian. This is Alex.

50
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,164
Hi

51
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,964
We're here to move you in.

52
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,238
Great.

53
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,271
Have a beer.

54
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:12,408
Thanks.

55
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,611
It's really nice to meet you guys.

56
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,180
Well, the neighborhood's just curious
to see who's taken over the house.

57
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,153
I'm going to put this out on the deck.

58
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,487
Do you have any ice?

59
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,490
No. The refrigerator wasn't even on.

60
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,593
Rachel's cleaning it right now.

61
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,992
Come on in.

62
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,428
Rachel...

63
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,599
Meet some more neighbors.

64
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,002
Oh... hi.

65
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,204
Hey. Don't worry.

66
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,507
Thanks.

67
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,296
No chemicals.

68
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,992
Excuse me?

69
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,201
No chemicals.

70
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,370
It's not good for the ground.

71
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,865
Oh no. This is just warm water and soap.

72
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,578
Gotta get it working.

73
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,331
Who are you?

74
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:44,199
I'm Fred. I'm here to fix the hot tub.

75
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,497
Oh.

76
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,870
It should have been ready when you got here.

77
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,448
Thlngs happened too fast.

78
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,659
It'll all be working by the time you need it.

79
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:59,074
They were fun for a whlle.
Joe was always kind of Into the God thlng...

80
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:02,779
but... when they decided to become
missionaries - Yeah, that surprised us.

81
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,814
Didn't Joe say his parents were missionaries?

82
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,751
All I know Is that we'd been looking for a place
for - God-what...

83
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,655
six months?

84
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,853
And when I saw the ad for this
place, I figured it had to be a scam.

85
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,061
Yeah, we both thought it was a scam.

86
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:23,368
No scam, just Miranda and Joe deciding to move to the
Philippines, teach people modern farming techniques.

87
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,331
Well...

88
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,530
here's to Joe and Miranda and their noble ways.

89
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,572
May they never want their house or their stuff back.

90
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,306
Beause they ain't gonna get it.

91
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,878
Here, here.

92
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,850
So, Nolan, what do you teach?

93
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,986
Sound design and film history.

94
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,916
I also have a little post studio at the house.

95
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,588
So, all of you guys are in
the business in some way?

96
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,783
Pretty much. You know, it's an L.A. thing.

97
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,190
You'll be sick of it before you know it.

98
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,124
Who else in the neighborhood?

99
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,199
Well, let's see...

100
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,826
Lionel, Jeff and Marie on the
other side work for the studio.

101
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,197
Miranda also gave us our
neighbor Andrew's number.

102
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,140
Oh, yeah, Andrew.

103
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,235
Uh oh, that doesn't sound good.

104
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,879
No, Andrew is...

105
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:13,283
He's an actor, and he really screwed up on
a show that we had recommended him for.

106
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,621
It was embarrassing and it was a mess.

107
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,756
We don't invite him to parties anymore.

108
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,895
Julian, can you pass me another beer?

109
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,230
Guys, excuse me.

110
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,298
You okay?

111
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,436
Yeah. I just, believe it or
not, am getting a little chilly.

112
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,236
I'm going to go find a sweater.

113
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,201
Good luck.

114
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,241
I'll need it.

115
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,844
Where do I know her from?

116
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,382
That could be one of a couple places.

117
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,651
She used to be the Zoom girl...

118
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,143
Also plenty of makeup ads.

119
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,054
Oh right. We have a star in our midst.

120
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:57,286
Well, she's retired now. She's
going to give writing a shot.

121
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,830
What about you?

122
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,092
I wrote copy for a small newspaper back east.

123
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:07,662
We were both just really frustrated with the
way things were going so we figured, Hey...

124
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,775
Why not give the west coast a chance?

125
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:14,375
So here we are. Both ready write
the great American screenplay.

126
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,250
There's not too many people
like us in this town, are there?

127
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,285
No.

128
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,238
Somebody must have gotten
shanked in the bathroom.

129
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,564
I guess so.

130
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,576
El Paso...

131
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,545
You alright?

132
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,581
I...

133
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,518
Yeah, yeah.

134
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,287
You didn't find a sweater?

135
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,558
No.

136
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,428
Julian, can you hand me a beer?

137
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,908
Hello?

138
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,409
Hey, what's up?

139
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,449
Yeah, you're the first to call.

140
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,552
It's Rose.

141
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,588
Hl, Rose.

142
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,690
Yes, yes.

143
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,193
It is so beautiful. You would not believe it.

144
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,363
It's great.

145
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,330
I can't wait to get in it.

146
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,381
Rose...

147
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,519
I'm seeing them again.

148
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:20,153
No, I dld not tell Kevin. You know I can't.

149
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:24,227
I promised a fresh start
when we came to California.

150
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,428
Hey.

151
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,965
I'm Rachel, your new neighbor.

152
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,800
I'm Andrew.

153
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,369
Yeah, I kinda figured that.

154
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,796
Why?

155
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:10,103
Oh, cause I was told that I had a
neighbor named Andrew and...

156
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,043
I guessed you were Andrew-seeing
as you came out of the house.

157
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,114
My boyfriend's name is Kevin. He's inside.

158
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,750
Joe and Miranda...

159
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,014
gone?

160
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,288
Yeah, they're in the Philippines now.

161
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,657
We're your new neighbors.

162
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,893
Philippines?

163
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,788
Yeah... You know, the whole
religious missionary thing?

164
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,165
Didn't you ever hang out with them?

165
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,930
They never struck me as religious.

166
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,606
Is that your boyfriend I've seen around?

167
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,039
Yeah, Kevin. He's inside writing.

168
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,545
He's not a producer?

169
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,714
Kevin? Oh no.

170
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,917
He's a writer.

171
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,131
I have to get going.

172
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:10,233
If you have any partles, or if you hear
of any partles,

173
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,963
please let me know.

174
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,299
Okay.

175
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,232
Parties on the hill are cool.

176
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,902
Good to go to them. Important, you know?

177
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,511
I can meet your boyfriend, Kevin.

178
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,448
Oh, and if you need my headshot for
anythlng, let me know.

179
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,623
I just got new ones made.

180
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,976
Welcome to Sllver Lake.

181
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,369
Edendale.

182
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,472
Many of Hollywood's first studios
were built right in the area you live.

183
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,368
I'm busted.

184
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,872
I thought you were writing. I was jealous.

185
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,303
Nothing to be jealous about, I'm afraid.

186
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,255
So, I met our neighbor, Andrew.

187
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,715
Oh yeah?

188
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,760
What's he like?

189
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,428
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

190
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,689
Huh.

191
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,537
Hello?

192
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,773
Oh yeah, hold on...

193
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,909
Bill.

194
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,177
Hey, Blll.

195
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,314
We're great.

196
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,377
We're just starting to feel settled in.

197
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:12,016
Hold on just a second, okay,
I'm going to switch phones.

198
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,461
Hang up for me please?

199
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,207
Kevin?

200
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,569
Uh huh?

201
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,643
You need a shave?

202
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,113
Beats trying to write.

203
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,950
That was Bill.

204
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,185
I know who that was.

205
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,881
He wanted to know if I'm avallable for ajob.

206
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,024
What did you tell him?

207
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,427
I told him that I'd talk it over with you.

208
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:27,765
What is he thinking?

209
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:32,130
He asked how things were
going and I told him fine.

210
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,972
He's trying to do us a favor,
best way he knows how.

211
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,804
By driving you crazy. Nice guy.

212
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,574
It's five days and five thousand dollars.

213
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,652
The point of moving out here was to
get away from that, do you remember?

214
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:57,126
Do you remember saying new life when we
moved to California, do you remember that?

215
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,531
Kevin, I am fine now.

216
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,756
- And besides it's just a little tiny shoot.

217
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,994
No crazy locations, no strangers.

218
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,106
It'sjust a dumb catalog.

219
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,169
Where?

220
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,674
Boston.

221
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,114
Fine, if you want to take it, take it.

222
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,450
This will be the last one, okay. I promise.

223
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:27,189
It's your mental health remember, not mine.

224
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,652
You mad?

225
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,081
No. No, I'm not.

226
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,526
I was...

227
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,062
a teeny bit annoyed.

228
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,432
Then I got over it.

229
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,269
When I cut myself.

230
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,907
You know what they say, right?

231
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,810
Don't shave angry.

232
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,945
Is that what they say?

233
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,508
Yeah.

234
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,647
Well, how about after dinner,

235
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:33,547
we go and break in that hot tub?

236
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,592
Now that sounds like a really good idea.

237
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,295
To hot tubs.

238
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:53,442
Oh, yeah.

239
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,807
Rachel, come on. The water's perfect.

240
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:01,609
Wait. Let me get a picture of the big moment.

241
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,854
I'm blind. I'm blind.

242
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:21,029
Oh, yeah.

243
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,307
If the folks back east could see us now.

244
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,313
I love L.A.

245
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,620
Not much not to love, is there?

246
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,956
I'm not ever leaving.

247
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,296
I have got the life.

248
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,699
Yeah, you do.

249
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,796
Is the water hot enough for you?

250
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,059
It's fine.

251
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,104
Are you sure?
Cause I can make it hotter, if you llke.

252
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,168
No, it's fine.

253
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,467
No, I can...

254
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,476
It's fine!

255
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,647
Help, Help.

256
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,716
I'm drowning.

257
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:14,016
Hey... What's going on back there?

258
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,422
I have no idea what you're talking about.

259
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,858
I think this hot water is giving you ideas.

260
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,863
Yeah, what kind of ideas is that?

261
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,935
What the... What dld you see?

262
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,638
Careful.

263
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,743
Was it an animal maybe?

264
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,946
They wouldn't want to come in here.

265
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,614
The water, the bubbles. It would scare them.

266
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,013
It wasn't an animal.

267
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,112
What then?

268
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,613
A crazed killer?

269
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,221
Stop it.

270
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,413
It could be.

271
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,458
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

272
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:23,694
My hero.

273
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,276
Geez.

274
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,974
Julian?

275
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,277
Hl, Rachel.

276
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,185
Are you alright?

277
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,519
I heard crying. Is Andrew okay?

278
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,327
He has had some problems.

279
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,063
Well, Is he all right?

280
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,933
He'll be fine.

281
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,669
What happened to him?

282
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,562
Nothing. He was just very
upset about some things.

283
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,413
I'll tell him you were here.

284
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,815
Thanks.

285
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,608
Oh my god!

286
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,606
Quiet.

287
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,278
I thlnk the waterwas dralnlng slowly,
so keep an eye on it.

288
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,713
Aye, aye, Captaln.

289
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,841
Do you know where my purse is?

290
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,517
It's the living room.

291
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:37,384
Can you check to see if my ID's in
there? And my... flight... the tickets...

292
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,390
Rachel...

293
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,921
Put your clothes on.

294
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,892
Close your suitcase.

295
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,656
Everything is cool.

296
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,898
Okay.

297
00:27:58,977 --> 00:27:59,841
Ready?

298
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,172
Ready.

299
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,891
Andrew?

300
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,049
Hello.

301
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,223
Hello.

302
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,702
All by myself.

303
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,606
So, it was five o'clock In the mornlng...

304
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,337
and we were all waitlng In thls van
for everyone to show up...

305
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,546
and thls one model doesn't show
up for an hour.

306
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:40,013
- And then the photographer comes
in right behind her-two hours.

307
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,486
It was amazing.

308
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:46,622
God, you would think the traffic
wouldn't be so heavy right now.

309
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:51,125
So, by the time we got to the location,
we were four hours behind schedule.

310
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:53,630
and from there, it was downhill.

311
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,500
It was... horrible.

312
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,870
Glad to be back?

313
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,905
Yeah.

314
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,006
So, you experienced an earthquake?

315
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,144
Yeah.

316
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,576
So?

317
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,147
It was... exhilarating.

318
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:22,257
Frankly, I don't think I need to be
experiencing that kind of exhilaration.

319
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,792
Yeah, well if you'd been there
you wouldn't feel that way.

320
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,865
It was incredible.

321
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,869
Okay.

322
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,073
I like your hair like this.

323
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,609
Thank you.

324
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,081
I quit smoking.

325
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,376
Really?

326
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:51,445
Yeah, so if I get a little short tempered
with you, blame it on that. Okay?

327
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,757
I'm really glad that you quit.

328
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,589
Just, try not to be too mean to me, okay?

329
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:24,284
Home sweet home. Boy, it's good to be back.

330
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:29,793
Andrew's moving?

331
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:33,090
Yeah. Actually he's moved already.

332
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,596
Really?

333
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,068
Yup. Gone.

334
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,039
Kind of strange, isn't it?

335
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:44,174
Yeah. Did he say why?

336
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,535
Oh, I started working out.

337
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,054
Kevin? Where's the food?

338
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:35,254
I'm sorta watching what I eat.

339
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,198
Welcome home, baby. We missed you.

340
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,382
I can hear your chewing in my head.

341
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,558
Stop it.

342
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,660
I am going to take a shower before I drop.

343
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:16,828
A shower, shower-to get this day
old airplane-sweat and dirt off me.

344
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,871
I knew that would get you.

345
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,305
What are you doing?

346
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:35,075
Hey, Pardner. You a good guy or a bad guy?

347
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,342
Miss, Miss...

348
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,615
I'm looking for Mr. Garbutt, Frank Garbutt.

349
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,780
Frank Garbutt? I don't know him.

350
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,860
You don't know? That's the Edendale hill?

351
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:24,652
That's Edendale.

352
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,892
There's no need to make hills that steep.

353
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,693
The road doesn't need to be that steep.

354
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,732
The studlo's around here.
I know it's around here.

355
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,763
I'm sorry. Who are you looking for?

356
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,244
I was on that hill.

357
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:45,042
Garbutt, Eddie Habert, Sid Jordon, Selig.

358
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,684
None of these names mean anything to you?

359
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,978
Heads of the fuckin' studlo.

360
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,487
Tom. Tom was there.

361
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,624
You're "in" one day, and you're "out" the next.

362
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,327
It's a tough town, a tough town.

363
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,025
I gotta go.

364
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:02,858
You're beautiful. Beautiful people.

365
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,831
You tell Tom, the next tlme you see hlm,
that I got away.

366
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,267
Okay.

367
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,226
You bitch.

368
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,669
Bitch. You can't do this to me.

369
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,764
You can't just take my life
and my furniture, you bitch.

370
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,139
You see the same people on the
way up as on the way down.

371
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:17,777
It's who you know in this town. You
wanna be so fucking Hollywood!

372
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,438
Hello?

373
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:54,044
Hey, Nolan. How's it going?

374
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:56,746
Well it's good to be back...

375
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,075
A party?

376
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,081
When?

377
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:02,547
Hold on just a second.

378
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,884
Are we available for a party at Nolan's tonight?

379
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,157
Absolutely.

380
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,893
Yeah, that would be great.

381
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:12,729
Alright.

382
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,860
Okay.

383
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,397
Bye.

384
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,092
This should be fun.

385
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,136
Excellent.

386
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,068
We have been invited to our first hill party.

387
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,821
I hate you.

388
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,887
No one ever said it was going to be easy.

389
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,996
I really hate you.

390
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,102
Well I'm going to do some gardening.

391
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:56,568
If I can't be a decent writer, maybe I can
at a little Miss Beaver Cleever gardener.

392
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,245
Do you hate me because I can't write?

393
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,414
It'll come.

394
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,412
The writing or the hate?

395
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,572
Think you're so great.

396
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,640
You're just a stupid bimbo model.

397
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,533
You're not even a real actress.

398
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,508
So what do you know?

399
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:40,114
If you wrote about what you know
it'd be a god damn pamphlet.

400
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,411
Did he say who was going to be there?

401
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,889
No, but I'm guessing that
Alex and Julian will be there.

402
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,494
Why? You got any Ideas?

403
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,225
No.

404
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,634
Probably will be industry people though.

405
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,436
How long until you're ready?

406
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,504
Ah, just a mlnute.

407
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,303
Hey -

408
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,410
I found something that I think you might like.

409
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,048
I found it in the garden.

410
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,083
It looks like a...

411
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,719
are you okay?

412
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,255
You found this.

413
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:57,352
That is the nicest thing.

414
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,456
It's just an old hunk of metal.

415
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,235
God, Rachel,

416
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,204
You're the best.

417
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,429
Nice night.

418
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,671
Hey. Hi. Come in.

419
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,740
Nolan.

420
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,934
You made it.

421
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,377
Yeah, but traffic was a bitch.

422
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:54,016
They llve up the hlll...
In Joe and Mlranda's old place.

423
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,143
Hi.

424
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,346
The booze is in the kitchen.

425
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,659
Cheers.

426
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,085
To the hill.

427
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:20,540
I try to tell them that it's as important to get good sound on location
as it is to get a good picture, but people don't seem to listen.

428
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:24,944
I set it up with them, but they dldn't respond
the way I hoped they would.

429
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,416
That's Ed.

430
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,551
He's a producer.

431
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,687
He's a really good friend of
mine. You should meet him.

432
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,889
This is great.

433
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,685
How's the screenplay?

434
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:40,128
It's good. Very good, In fact.
Dld I tell you about it?

435
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,198
I don't know, did you?

436
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:46,725
I didn't think so, but-oh well.

437
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,370
We know pretty much everything
that happens on the hill.

438
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,242
Yeah, I guess so.

439
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,877
You have to take care of the hill.

440
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,011
Take care of the hill?

441
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:04,885
Yeah. All the roots from the trees,
the plants, the pipes, the plumbing.

442
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:08,982
It all combines, connects -
like a circulatory system.

443
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:10,457
A ha.

444
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:14,622
When something happens, you have
to take care of it fast. Call Dr. Fred.

445
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,730
Yeah, he fixed our hot tub.

446
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,566
Then you know. He keeps
everybody in good shape.

447
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,506
Do you want me to take this out for you?

448
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,734
Uh huh.

449
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:27,706
Hey.

450
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,372
Ed, I have someone I want you to meet.

451
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,278
Okay.

452
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,906
This is Kevin. He lives up the hill.

453
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,007
Edward Habert, good to meet you.

454
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:35,949
Nice to meet you.

455
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:37,850
He's written something I think
you really want to take a look at.

456
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:38,785
Really?

457
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:39,980
I don't know that it's quite ready yet.

458
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,957
I mean, I know it's not ready yet.

459
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,551
I'm only halfway through the first draft,
let alone any kind of rewrite.

460
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:49,029
Don't be modest. You said you're
were looking for a western, right?

461
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,656
I did, I did.

462
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,593
About time for our comeback, wouldn't you say?

463
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,605
A classic western like the old days.

464
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,907
How did you know that I'm writing a wes-

465
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:01,274
Anytime you're ready, Kevin.
How about Wednesday?

466
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,780
Jesus.

467
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:10,949
Yeah, I gota welcome to Sllver Lake pamphlet where
itactually boasted thatthls Is where Hollywood started.

468
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:15,253
Yeah. It's true, this entire hill
was part of Tom Mix's ranch.

469
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,760
Oh, I think I know who he is.

470
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,193
He was big.

471
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,854
At one point he was the highest
paid movie star around.

472
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:26,698
He made like fifteen thousand
dollars a week-in Nineteen fifteen.

473
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,035
Back when fifteen grand a week
meant somethlng.

474
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:35,373
Yeah, all of them in this square mile
or two. Mixville right on this hill.

475
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:38,539
What at tlme.
It was really llke the Wlld West then.

476
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,650
And the studio heads played right into it.

477
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:45,845
One story of how four of them tried to hang
some contract player...

478
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:49,984
...who had screwed up an entlre day's
shootlng with some less than deslrable actlng.

479
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,061
Wow, that's the good old days, huh?

480
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:56,562
I'm sure that the studio publicist
made up the entire story, but -

481
00:48:56,633 --> 00:49:01,661
it gave them a reputation as bad asses
and the nickname, the four horsemen.

482
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,104
Tom Mix on the other hand -

483
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:07,200
He was your classic-squeaky
clean, cowboy image.

484
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:11,839
Kids' role model-don't drink, don't smoke,
eat your vegetables sort of thlng.

485
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,442
He signed autographs by the carloads.

486
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,677
There are still things on the hill
which hint to the Mixville era.

487
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,755
There's still some rubble on Lionel's
property that was part of the stables.

488
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,027
Honey, show Nolan what I found.

489
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,135
Wow.

490
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,968
Found it in the backyard-in the ground.

491
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,366
Pretty great, huh?

492
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,438
So, what happened to him?

493
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:40,838
Tom Mix?

494
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:46,208
Well, when sound came along, Westerns sortoffell
outoffavor, and he wentto dolng wild westshows.

495
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:50,643
Later, the studio four, the four
horsemen, got back together.

496
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,451
Tom Mix had written a Western, and they
were golng to make it.

497
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,525
A return to the glory days.

498
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:00,422
Well, on hls way back from Arizona,
he was driving a bit too fast.

499
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:07,534
Supposedly the accldent itselfwasn't so bad, but the
flylng suitcase that clocked hlm In the back of the neck...

500
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:11,500
End of Tom Mix, end of an era.

501
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:13,302
He's buried in Glendale.

502
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:17,005
The gully where he died is
named after him, and this hill...

503
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:22,208
Well, every so often this hill
coughs up a bit of his life.

504
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,151
It's an era that nobody remembers anymore -

505
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:32,752
except when I teach it in my film history
class or drink and talk about it at parties.

506
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,465
It's interesting.

507
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,067
So, what are you doing now?

508
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,026
Trying to write.

509
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:43,834
I just did a job back east,
but I'm really trying to write.

510
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,464
How's it going?

511
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:49,011
So far, not so good-whlch has really
got me worried.

512
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,844
Don't worry.

513
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,882
Things will work themselves out.

514
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,351
People who live on the hill do good work.

515
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,588
Geez, well I hope I'm worthy.

516
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:04,352
With Joe and Miranda, with the
whole kid thing... you know...

517
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,462
I thought they became missionaries?

518
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,721
Yeah, that and the kid.

519
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,762
He was never really part of anythlng
on the hlll.

520
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:18,869
But, we have big hopes for you though.

521
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,144
Guys, I'm leaving.
I just wanted to say good nlght.

522
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:24,177
You, call me.

523
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,542
I will. Nice to meet you.

524
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,583
Nice to meet you.

525
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:29,751
Hey, Edward?

526
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:30,615
Yeah?

527
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,688
I think there might be a vacancy.

528
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:36,182
Well I'll look into it. Good night.

529
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,861
Andrew's place?

530
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,463
Gotta move our people in, right?

531
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,103
That was cool.

532
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,200
God, thls hlll Is exhlllratlng.

533
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,279
I'm beat.

534
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:58,314
Wasn't that great?

535
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,383
All those cool people.

536
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,549
Kevin?

537
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,344
What?

538
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,686
How come that guy Edward
wants to talk to you so bad?

539
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:11,221
I mean, it's not llke anyone knows
or has read your stuff yet.

540
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,691
What are you talking about?
Julian recommended me.

541
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,591
Yeah, but if he's an important
producer, like they say he is,

542
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:21,530
why is he so hot to work with you
if he hasn't even read word one?

543
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,041
What? Are you jealous?

544
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:28,574
No, god no, I'm just curious.

545
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,746
I guess he really trusts Julian's opinion.

546
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,541
Yeah. But how does Julian
know if you're any good?

547
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,810
Don't get pissy.

548
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:38,651
I'm not being pissy. I'm just asking.
It's seems a little weird if you ask me.

549
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:43,115
Jesus Christl
Can't you ever not be susplclous?

550
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,953
That is how this town works.

551
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:48,097
It's about who you know.

552
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,100
You could be illiterate for all they know.

553
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,995
Yeah but I'm not. I am a fucking good writer.

554
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,140
Don't you try and bring me down, you bitch.

555
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,332
You were supposed to be on my side.

556
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,778
Kevin?

557
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,244
What?

558
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,282
You are scaring me.

559
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,648
Shut up.

560
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,686
There's nothing to be scared about.

561
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,582
Just don't say jealous, stupid things.

562
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,948
Good morning. How are you?

563
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:49,452
Okay, I guess.

564
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:07,476
You were a real asshole last night.

565
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:11,212
What? Oh. That was nothing.

566
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:17,452
What do you mean that was nothing? That
was not nothing. That was something.

567
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,156
Oh. Sorry.

568
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,610
Oh, come on.

569
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:01,453
Rachel...

570
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,395
Kevin?

571
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,964
Yeah?

572
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:45,167
What exactly happened to Andrew?

573
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,539
He moved.

574
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,742
I thought you said he lost it or had a
nervous breakdown or something?

575
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:55,907
I did?

576
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:56,909
Yeah.

577
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:00,275
No. He moved.

578
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:02,981
Are you sure?

579
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,186
Yes.

580
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,417
How do you know?

581
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,890
Hls car Is stlll there.
Hls stuff Is stlll In the house.

582
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,156
It just doesn't seem right.

583
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,703
You're imagining things.

584
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,672
He told me he was moving.

585
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,175
Said he didn't like living in L.A. anymore.

586
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:28,305
He told you he was moving?

587
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,208
Yes.

588
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:30,412
When?

589
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,415
When you were away.

590
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:38,154
Well then how come his stuff is still here?

591
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,519
Why are you asking so many questions?

592
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:45,127
It's really none of your business.

593
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:49,324
- And I don't have every single answer.

594
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:55,934
Maybe if you spent less time worrying about the
neighbors, and more time worrying about your writing -

595
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:59,770
- You might actually get something done.

596
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,632
What?

597
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:28,893
I'm going out. Do you need anything?

598
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:32,741
No.

599
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:16,416
Fuck you, Kevin. Maybe when you're nlcer,
I'll glve it back to you.

600
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:44,347
Oh great, Rachel. Why don't you just
bring the whole garden in with you?

601
00:59:44,382 --> 00:59:46,315
Good thing you're not a cat burglar.

602
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,543
Right to the scene of the...

603
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:09,701
Get a hold of yourself. You are an adult.
You can handle your own imagination.

604
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,274
You'rejust a little stressed out.

605
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,676
Just breath. In and out.

606
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,218
Just relax.

607
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,215
There you go.

608
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:28,290
It's okay.

609
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:31,918
Just relax. You just need to relax.

610
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:52,843
You are a freak, Rachel. Stupid
freak, freaking yourself out.

611
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,206
Stupid freak.

612
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,379
You have got to relax.

613
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,115
Don't let it happen.

614
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:26,766
What is wrong with you?

615
01:03:40,183 --> 01:03:42,151
Hello?

616
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:46,822
Who's here?

617
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,828
Nobody.

618
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,466
Who are you talking to?

619
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:00,600
Nobody.

620
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,838
Oh, but I heard you talking to someone.

621
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,702
What happened?

622
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:14,245
You dropped like a bag of flour
the minute I walked in the door.

623
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,320
Oh, God.

624
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:21,485
You had that hot tub way too hot.

625
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,692
How long were you in there?

626
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,159
God, I'm still in the buff.

627
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,593
Uh Huh.

628
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:32,863
You were pretty dehydrated, overheated.

629
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:35,768
You okay?

630
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:37,873
You want to see a doctor?

631
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:39,942
No. I'm fine.

632
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:44,146
I need to get dressed.

633
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:46,577
Oh God, Rachel.

634
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:48,617
That is so dangerous.

635
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,219
You can boil your brain that way.

636
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:54,156
You hungry?

637
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,258
How about I go get some takeout.

638
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,027
Okay.

639
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:04,766
I've got some news to tell you.

640
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,466
About what?

641
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:09,571
I'll tell you when I get back.

642
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,969
I also got a video you mlght get a kick out of.

643
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,567
What?

644
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,612
You'll see.

645
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:22,249
Okay. I'll be right back.

646
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,212
Who are you?

647
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,783
Dinner's here.

648
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,586
Who are you?

649
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,727
Okay.

650
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:23,591
What-are you talking about?

651
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,402
The cowboy...

652
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,906
Tom Mix.

653
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,341
What about him?

654
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,448
You need to eat.

655
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,184
Kevin...

656
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:50,392
Something happened to you.

657
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,827
It's this house, the hill.

658
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:57,025
I know I'm not crazy, I'm not imagining this.

659
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:01,733
Please, please leave with me and you'll see.

660
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,165
Back to the east coast?

661
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:13,977
To hell with that.

662
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,051
I told you, I'm not leaving.

663
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,951
I love it here.

664
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,989
I belong here.

665
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:23,991
I have found my place.

666
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:30,527
No, Kevin. It has found you.

667
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:08,937
Rose? It's me.

668
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:16,242
Everything. Everything is wrong.

669
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:18,880
The house is wrong.

670
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,949
Kevin is wrong.

671
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:24,548
This fucking hill is wrong.

672
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:28,120
Can you please come?

673
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:31,418
I have no friends here.

674
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,435
Don't you even want to know
what my news was?

675
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,513
What's your news?

676
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,583
I met with Edward today -

677
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,819
- And he loved the script.

678
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:02,052
Said it should have been made years ago.

679
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:05,654
He's golng to get it green-lit
as soon as posslble.

680
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:08,129
This all happened today?

681
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:11,427
It happens fast when it happens.

682
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,896
Good for you, Kevin.

683
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,061
I guess you're what this town likes.

684
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,608
Rose is helping me move.

685
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,410
She's coming the day after tomorrow.

686
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:32,187
Don't you have anything to say?

687
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,292
Good bye.

688
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:06,949
After I got back from thatjob,
he was different.

689
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:11,417
He quit smoking, he was writing non stop.

690
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,358
Those seem like good things.

691
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:15,453
But there are other things.

692
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:19,590
Hls mannerisms. The way he talks.
He's different.

693
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,598
He's mean.

694
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,408
It's the house.

695
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:28,910
It's the hill. Everybody on the hill is...

696
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:35,274
Rose, they're all in on it together.

697
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:40,182
I don't thlnk it was a mlstake that
we moved here.

698
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:43,553
And the thing is that if you
don't fit in, they exclude you.

699
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,927
They excluded Andrew, our nelghbor,
and now he's gone.

700
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:48,463
Gone?

701
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:51,965
And now they want me out. So, I'm leaving.

702
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,504
They have plans.

703
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:02,105
I know it sounds like I'm crazy, but
I'm not. You have to believe that.

704
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:04,370
I'm your sister.

705
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,715
It comes with the job description.

706
01:13:07,816 --> 01:13:10,717
I'm here to do whatever you want me to do.

707
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,021
Thanks, Rose.

708
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,382
Yeah.

709
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,475
He's not home.

710
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:35,610
So now what?

711
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,113
I don't know.

712
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:42,615
Do you mlnd if I sit down? New York
tlme Is kinda catchlng up with me.

713
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,144
Oh yeah. Do you want to sit out on the deck?

714
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,390
Yeah.

715
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,499
You sure you want to give this all up?

716
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:10,177
All I want Is the stuffthat I came here with.
He can have everythlng we gotwhen we got here.

717
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,439
Is he going to pay you for it?

718
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:13,208
I don't care.

719
01:14:13,482 --> 01:14:15,450
I just gotta get out.

720
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,687
Hello, Rose.

721
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,121
Kevin, hl.

722
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:25,627
How are you?

723
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,996
Okay. You?

724
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:31,299
Okay, I guess,

725
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,868
considering the circumstances.

726
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:41,266
Well, I'm going to be in the
office if you need anything.

727
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,281
Thanks.

728
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:54,280
Okay, your clothes, the computer,
whatever... You're going to need boxes.

729
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:58,021
I know. I gotta go get some.

730
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,592
Maybe you could start laying
my clothes out on the bed.

731
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,636
Sure. Yeah.

732
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:10,831
You need anything?

733
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:12,938
No, honey. I'm okay.

734
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:15,043
Rose, thanks again.

735
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,078
Sure.

736
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:27,755
Hey.

737
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:32,961
Kevin, what happened?

738
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,925
Why are you guys breaking
up? You're so good together.

739
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,633
I thought so too.

740
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:43,497
She really surprised me when she
just suddenly said she was leaving.

741
01:15:44,907 --> 01:15:46,875
Nothing else?

742
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:52,669
She's been acting kind of
strange for the past few months,

743
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:59,613
but I just chalked that up to
moving, relocating to a new place.

744
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:07,924
God, it's killing me that she's leaving.

745
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:13,761
I don't know. To be perfectly honest with you...

746
01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:16,437
I'm concerned about her.

747
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:20,141
I think she's got something deeper going on.

748
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:24,445
You might be right.

749
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,444
Oh, Kevin.

750
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:33,246
I'm so sorry that thls Is happenlng, but I'm not
supposed to be taking sldes, except her slde.

751
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:38,753
Don't-don't take sides.

752
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:44,690
I guess you're just going to have
to look at me as the bad guy.

753
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:49,268
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry about all thls.

754
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,406
Yeah, me too.

755
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,541
You poor thing.

756
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,137
Where's Rose?

757
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,504
She said something about going out for a walk.

758
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:32,380
I thought she'd be back by now.

759
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,543
She's not.

760
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,142
Huh.

761
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:38,820
Did you check outside?

762
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:41,889
She loves it out there.

763
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:45,821
She's not outside.

764
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,760
I guess she dldn't get back
from herwalk then.

765
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:51,991
Excuse me.

766
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:56,736
I'm going to a meeting with
Edward and somebody from Fox.

767
01:17:57,773 --> 01:18:01,539
If everythlng goes the way he thlnks it will...

768
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:04,168
You could be readlng about me In
tomorrow's Variety.

769
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:09,481
I'm not going to be reading Variety
tomorrow or any other god damn day.

770
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,654
I am moving. You do realize that, don't you?

771
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,856
Sure.

772
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:18,548
I think you're basically
stupid, and I don't give a shit.

773
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:22,420
But yes... I am aware.

774
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:27,966
Fuck you, you self-absorbed
Hollywood wannabe.

775
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:34,475
Hello?

776
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,413
It's for you.

777
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:43,709
Hello?

778
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:46,754
Edward... Great to hear from you.

779
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:52,425
Yes, yes.
I'm on my way out the door right now.

780
01:18:53,962 --> 01:19:00,060
Uh huh. Okay. I will see you soon...
at Nolan's.

781
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,705
Ciao.

782
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,542
You're going to Nolan's?

783
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:11,903
Yeah. The big movie premiere.

784
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:13,838
What?

785
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:17,610
You are no longer part of this hill, as I recall.

786
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,458
Well, I'm off.

787
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:28,329
Don't wait up.

788
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:32,800
You Fuck!

789
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:34,969
You FUCK!

790
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:01,187
Shut up... Shut up!

791
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:21,648
I'm so sorry about all thls.

792
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:24,778
Rose?

793
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:32,054
Rose?

794
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:34,421
911, what is your -

795
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,129
To the hill.

796
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:31,996
This entire hill was part of Tom Mix's ranch.

797
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,964
Abouttime forourcomeback, wouldn'tyou say?

798
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:36,270
I was on that hill.

799
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:38,406
Return to the glory days.

800
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,010
You need to move along.

801
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:04,592
I feel sorry for that woman.

802
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:07,161
Been around here for years, I hear.

803
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:10,293
It's a terrible thing.

804
01:26:10,532 --> 01:26:12,500
Terrible, terrible thing.

805
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:14,730
Yeah.

806
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:18,869
Well you have to wonder how
they get that way, I mean...

807
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,208
It's a tough town.

808
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,506
Rachel...
