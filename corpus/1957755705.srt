1
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,388
<i>We can't control
what happens in our lives.</i>

2
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,692
<i>We can only control
how we respond to it.</i>

3
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,863
<i>And while nothing
could've prepared me</i>

4
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:30,243
<i>for how I felt when we found out</i>

5
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,499
<i>my dad had dementia at age 58,</i>

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,134
<i>my dad's struggle
brought my family</i>

7
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,435
<i>even closer together.</i>

8
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,849
<i>Those we love
with Alzheimer's or dementia</i>

9
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,374
<i>might not remember us.</i>

10
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,644
<i>However,
we can always remember them.</i>

11
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>This is my dad's story.</i>

12
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:47,447
<i>This is my family's story.</i>

13
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:20,615
Hey, Mom.

14
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,250
Yeah, hey,
is Dad coming to pick me up?

15
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,587
Well, how long ago did he leave?

16
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:30,157
Okay, here he is.
Okay. I'll see you soon.

17
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:37,665
- What's going on?
- Not much.

18
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,872
Heard UNO has
a big game this weekend.

19
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,308
Yup, they've been
pretty good this year.

20
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,746
- Oh, we should try to go.
- Maybe.

21
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,321
Everything okay, Dad?

22
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,156
It's fine.

23
00:03:01,816 --> 00:03:03,017
Hi, honey!

24
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,787
- Hi!
- Mama! Hi, how are you?

25
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,858
- Ah, how was the flight?
- It was smooth, Mom. Thanks.

26
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,426
Oh, great.
I'm so glad.

27
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,138
Yeah. Yeah, I love the paint.
When'd you do this?

28
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:16,864
- Oh, a while ago.
- I painted.

29
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:19,934
Paul, um, we're gonna eat soon.

30
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,803
Why don't you go watch some TV?

31
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:23,336
- I'll be in the den.
- 'Kay.

32
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,141
Why don't you settle in?

33
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,475
- Okay.
- And we'll talk later.

34
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,443
- Okay?
- Okay. Sounds good. All right.

35
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:30,745
Oh, you look so great,

36
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,321
- you're so handsome.
- Ah, thanks, Mom.

37
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,957
It's so good to be here.
Let me grab this.

38
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,348
- Okay. Sure.
- Excuse me.

39
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,919
My big, strong boy!

40
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,426
<i>For the most
part, he's been held</i>

41
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,896
<i>in check in the series so far,
just two for nine.</i>

42
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:23,931
Artie.

43
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,301
Morning!

44
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,438
Artie. Wake up, dude!

45
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,674
Hey!
Aren't you happy to see me?

46
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:35,475
Hmm? Yeah.
It's great to see you, bud.

47
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,078
I mean,
you never call or anything.

48
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,679
It's heartbreaking.

49
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,548
- Phone works both ways, bro.
- Yeah.

50
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,415
- You know what? You and me.
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:43,861
We're gonna have
a little chat later.

52
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,253
- Okay.
- Yes!

53
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:48,488
Yes, yes, yes, yes,

54
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,958
yes, yes, yes, yes...

55
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,560
Dad, what are you doing?

56
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,228
You don't even like these teams.

57
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,532
It's what he does now.

58
00:04:58,766 --> 00:04:59,766
Since when?

59
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,569
I don't know, past six months.

60
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,781
Okay, and what's going on
with the yard?

61
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,606
Ah, he just
doesn't care anymore.

62
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:07,942
What about you?

63
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,877
Hmm? Dude, I'm tired.

64
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:14,182
Okay. Hey, Dad.

65
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,359
You wanna
clean up the yard this weekend?

66
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,652
Get it all straightened up?

67
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,429
Hey, Dad.

68
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,370
I'm gonna take Stella
for a walk, you wanna go?

69
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,001
- Okay.
- All right. Let's go.

70
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,937
- Stella. Come. Come.
- Come on.

71
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:45,780
- Nice day.
- Yup.

72
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,684
Oh, wow, a lot of memories
in that truck.

73
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:52,452
That's my pride and joy
right there.

74
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:53,955
Too bad it doesn't run.

75
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,691
- Been tinkering with it.
- Oh, yeah?

76
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,726
Maybe we can get it runnin'.

77
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,672
These are beautiful.

78
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:13,774
It's a Knock Out rose.

79
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:15,610
Rosa Radrazz.

80
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,746
Let's go home.

81
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,752
Mama!

82
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,655
Should've heard Dad.

83
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,155
He knew, like,
every scientific name

84
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,658
of all the flowers
on the street.

85
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:34,562
I just got a call.

86
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:36,764
Yeah?

87
00:06:38,266 --> 00:06:39,934
Your dad got fired.

88
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:41,636
Fired?

89
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,438
For what reason?

90
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,578
For the golf cart incident.

91
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,780
You're kidding me. He...

92
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,616
Mom, he's given
his whole life to university.

93
00:06:57,652 --> 00:06:59,654
They could have prosecuted him.

94
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:03,190
Okay, okay. Here.
Let me take this, Mom.

95
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,493
It's okay.
I got it, I got it.

96
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,734
What was he doing
driving a cart anyway?

97
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:19,540
He was... working
on the grounds crew.

98
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,377
How did he go
from running the biology lab

99
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,879
to the grounds crew?

100
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,148
It happened several months ago.

101
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,183
Mom...

102
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,819
You gotta tell me these things.

103
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,156
I didn't want to worry you.

104
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,857
Well... Okay.

105
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,226
So, what does Tony
say about all this?

106
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,296
Tony doesn't know about it.

107
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:46,767
I... I... I don't want
to bother him.

108
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:51,572
He and Marilyn are going
through a lot together.

109
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,209
The doctor told her that

110
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,812
he doesn't know
if she can get pregnant.

111
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:01,515
Ma, that's horrible.

112
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:07,355
Mom, hey,
everything's gonna be fine.

113
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:08,990
- All right?
- I hope so.

114
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:10,963
Did you take Dad
to see Dr. Michaels?

115
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,492
Of course I did.

116
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,261
We had a follow-up appointment

117
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:17,198
but he was
too stubborn to go back.

118
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:21,068
Ooh, sounds like
Mom's cookin' up a storm!

119
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,737
Hey!

120
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:26,207
- There he is! Ah, man.
- Tony. Oh, brother.

121
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,309
What're you doin' here?
What? You miss me?

122
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,278
Or you just come home
for Mom's famous meatloaf, huh?

123
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,557
You already know the answer,
man, Mom's famous meatloaf.

124
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,682
- Come on.
- Of course.

125
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:35,616
Yeah, my famous meatloaf.

126
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:36,716
Mom, it's the best

127
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,119
and you know it, all right?

128
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,887
And I will fly
2,000 miles any day for it.

129
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,565
And the only reason? 'Cause
I get to eat it with you.

130
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:43,190
You want the biggest piece,
don't you?

131
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,369
- Of course I... yeah, of cours...
- Hey, hey, ho, whoa, whoa.

132
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:46,827
Thought I was your favorite son.

133
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,672
- You wish, big guy.
- Oh, yeah? Do I? Do I? Do I?

134
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,364
- Do I?
- Been eating too much meatloaf!

135
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,400
You look great, man.

136
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,702
Bless us, oh, Lord,
for these thy gifts

137
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:56,505
we are about to receive
from thy bounty.

138
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,106
In Christ's name,
our Lord, amen.

139
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,975
Amen.

140
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,212
Mom, I gotta say, the potatoes

141
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,947
- look a little lumpy.
- Ah!

142
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,617
Maybe if you mashed 'em,
they'd be perfect, Artie.

143
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,786
Hey, Artie.

144
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,788
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

145
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,023
I want to be just like you.

146
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,925
Ha-ha, funny guy.

147
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:20,127
You know,
you really need to start

148
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,595
chipping in around here.

149
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,692
You know what?
I think I've lost my appetite.

150
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:27,978
- So, excuse me.
- Artie. Artie!

151
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,370
Artie, come on.
Get back here.

152
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,005
Let... Let him go.
Let him go.

153
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,307
He's got a lot
of figuring out to do.

154
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,710
Well,
he better figure it out fast.

155
00:09:36,811 --> 00:09:38,312
Mom, what's going on with him?

156
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:40,281
He just...

157
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:41,550
He hasn't been himself

158
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:42,983
since he dropped out of college.

159
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:45,119
Maybe he should
go back to school.

160
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,021
I mean,
it beats laying around here,

161
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,289
sleeping all day.

162
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,157
Plus, he might meet a nice girl.

163
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,327
That's how I met Dad,
40 years ago.

164
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,497
Paul, where are you going?

165
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,733
- I'm going to go to the garage.
- No, no, no, honey.

166
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:01,702
Honey, sit down,
have dinner with us.

167
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,471
It's Jesse's first night home.

168
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:04,939
I'm gonna go work on the truck.

169
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,244
Has... Has he done
much work on the truck?

170
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,247
No. Not really.

171
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,883
He just...

172
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,153
sits out there and listens
to the radio or...

173
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,255
the game.

174
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,358
That old heap
ain't ever going to run. Ha.

175
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,726
You know what?

176
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,294
I'm going to go talk to him.

177
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:32,066
Hey, whatever happened
to family dinner?

178
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,234
Mm.

179
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:35,870
Maybe he can help.

180
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,006
Maybe.

181
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,008
So...

182
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,077
how ya feeling, honey?

183
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,113
I'm okay.

184
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,115
The doctor's gonna
run more tests.

185
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,584
Yeah.

186
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:50,951
Oh.

187
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:53,721
- It's in God's hands.
- Yeah.

188
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,763
<i>The ball's in one strike.</i>

189
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,534
<i>Fouled away...</i>

190
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:06,800
Hey, Dad.

191
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:08,969
- Brought you some pie.
- Thanks.

192
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,240
Since when do you care about
the Irish?

193
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,609
Hmm.

194
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,319
Well, I'm German
and your mother's Italian.

195
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,546
Huh?

196
00:11:17,646 --> 00:11:19,280
Uh, hey, Dad,
can I get 20 bucks?

197
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,353
What're you doin'?
Dad's unemployed.

198
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,164
What? No "thank you"?

199
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,708
Well, if I'd known
it was comin' from you,

200
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:39,772
I would've asked for a 50.

201
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,368
Oh, really? Okay.

202
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,274
Little worried about you, Dad.

203
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,544
I'm fine.

204
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,154
Mom said you missed
your follow-up

205
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,447
- with Dr. Michaels and...
- I'm fine.

206
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,450
Okay, well, you still gotta
go in for your follow-up.

207
00:11:57,218 --> 00:11:58,485
I'm fine.

208
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,523
Okay. All right.

209
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:02,691
Mm.

210
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,035
I'm gonna go back in
and finish eating, okay?

211
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,860
- Okay.
- All right.

212
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:09,564
Hey, what do you say we clean
up that messy yard tomorrow?

213
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,071
I'm fine.

214
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,479
<i>The ball
hit hard to the left side.</i>

215
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:29,383
<i>Right at the third baseman
and that'll end the inning...</i>

216
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,656
Dad, you gotta
break the sticks down.

217
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,023
Yup!

218
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,705
Dad, come on, we gotta
keep the process movin'.

219
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:42,272
I trim the branches,
you break 'em down.

220
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,364
Okay.

221
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,035
Dad, do you wanna switch?

222
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,647
Do you wanna trim
and I'll break 'em down?

223
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:50,971
No, that's okay.

224
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,281
Dad, Dad, where you goin'?

225
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,083
- Inside.
- Apparently.

226
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:06,153
What happened
to workin' on the yard?

227
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:09,691
I told you, man, he's...
He's been like this for months.

228
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,967
Yeah,
but it doesn't make any sense.

229
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,359
He loves working on the yard.

230
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,994
Well, now he doesn't.

231
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,214
Now you're the only one
who likes to work on the yard.

232
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:19,333
Okay, so tell me,
why'd you drop out of college?

233
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,736
You know what?

234
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,315
Just wasn't really
feeling it anymore.

235
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,441
Come on.

236
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:31,513
Artie.

237
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,448
I moved back up here
to help out with Dad, okay?

238
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,527
Mom's strong
and nobody would tell her

239
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:38,385
that she needs help,
but I know that she does.

240
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,422
I can go to college
any other time.

241
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:44,091
Right now, I need to be here
to help her.

242
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,261
You know what?

243
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:49,081
It's too early in the morning
for this crap.

244
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,365
Uh, your condo
doesn't have a garden, right?

245
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,334
So, you can...
You probably miss it.

246
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:02,476
Aha! Bubs!
There he is.

247
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,246
We're gonna
head over to the bar, but...

248
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,617
Um, I'm gonna
tell him to forget it.

249
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,985
- No, no.
- Yeah.

250
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:14,154
No, you go.
You have fun.

251
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,890
Just tell Bubs
no drinking and driving.

252
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,426
If you need to take
a taxi home, you take a taxi.

253
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,496
You go.
Have... Have a good time.

254
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:25,065
All right.

255
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,468
- Hey. I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.

256
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,471
Don't come home too late
because I'll just, you know...

257
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:33,273
- 'Cause you'll be worried.
- I'll be worried.

258
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,174
Yeah.

259
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,210
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.

260
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,488
Toast to our boy, Jesse.

261
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,525
Movin' up in the big city.

262
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,794
I never thought you were gonna
come back this way, man.

263
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,228
- Big timer.
- Oh, what?

264
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:56,196
And stay away from this dump?

265
00:14:57,965 --> 00:15:00,234
Oh, easy, easy, hotshot. Right?

266
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,546
- There's no place like home.
- You're right. I'm playin'.

267
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,438
You stickin' around
for a while this time?

268
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,340
Yeah. Few days.

269
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,842
And then I gotta
head back to L.A.

270
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,243
Girlfriend's waiting for me.

271
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:11,245
Oh, it must be so hard
to be away

272
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,913
from your supermodel girlfriend.

273
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,516
You know, I just...

274
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,985
Speakin' of girlfriends.

275
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,158
- Can we get two beers?
- You got it.

276
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:26,561
Hey, make it three, Steve,
and I got them.

277
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:27,995
Okay, Jesse.

278
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,600
- Look, I'm sorry.
- What's your problem?

279
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,967
No excuse.

280
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,104
Yeah, exactly.
At least you're being honest.

281
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,440
Here you go.
$7.50, Jesse.

282
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:41,108
And good to see you
back in town.

283
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,608
Thanks, Steve.
It's good to be home.

284
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:44,512
Oh, yeah, how is the big city,
by the way?

285
00:15:44,612 --> 00:15:46,648
Los Angeles.
Is it cool?

286
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:48,015
Yeah, it's good.

287
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,651
- Yeah?
- Just workin' a lot.

288
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,185
You seeing anybody?

289
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:55,155
- Yeah, I'm seeing somebody.
- Awesome.

290
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,591
I heard.
She's a model?

291
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,227
Something like that.

292
00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:03,197
So, what's going on
with your dad?

293
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:05,132
Is... Is he okay?

294
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:06,935
I mean, yeah,
he's okay, I guess.

295
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,302
So, why'd he get fired?

296
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:10,471
Well, he just wasn't keeping up

297
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:11,573
with his tasks at work

298
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:12,753
and just hasn't been acting

299
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,742
- like himself lately.
- Mm.

300
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,111
So, how's work
at the kindergarten?

301
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,013
I work now at the, um,

302
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,784
Waterford, uh,
Communities of Lincoln.

303
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:23,960
Waterford Communities
of Lincoln.

304
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,085
Yup.

305
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,362
It's like a senior citizen home?

306
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,790
No, we refer to it as a, um...

307
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,825
It's like
a memory care facility.

308
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:33,369
All right, look,
I don't want to keep you from...

309
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:35,162
You're not keeping me.
It's all good.

310
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:36,698
Hey, hey.

311
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,200
Can we get a coffee
and talk sometime?

312
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,537
Nah, I'm good.

313
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:44,606
- Thank you, though.
- Wait.

314
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:45,773
We can't be friends?

315
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,610
I mean, you're the one
that left, Jesse.

316
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:56,518
I don't know.

317
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,119
I just don't get
how you could let her go.

318
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,355
She's... She's a keeper, man.

319
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:03,390
Yeah, she seems mad still, huh?

320
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,092
Come on, dude.

321
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,628
You just up and left.

322
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:08,404
- I mean, can you blame me?
- Yeah.

323
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,397
Major job in the big city.

324
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:14,101
Jesse, there are a million jobs.

325
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,537
There's only one April.

326
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:18,238
You hurt her, man.

327
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,374
I didn't mean to.

328
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,443
Let's talk about something else.

329
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,656
Like, for instance,
I have a family of six

330
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,915
and I have one pizza.

331
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,575
It's only you,
your mom and your sister.

332
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:31,084
- You have two.
- Well, it's not rocket science.

333
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,587
One's for me and Mom and...

334
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:35,757
Well, you've seen my sister.

335
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:36,925
Hey, don't tip the box.

336
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,392
She's picky about the cheese.

337
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,167
Go say hi to Mom and Dad for me.

338
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:49,102
I will.
Thanks for picking me up.

339
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,762
- Give me a shout tomorrow.
- All right.

340
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,814
Here you go, honey.

341
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,842
Hey, Mom.
Everything okay?

342
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,209
I got it.

343
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:21,288
If you need me, I'm here.

344
00:20:36,204 --> 00:20:38,506
Art, will you please tell Jesse

345
00:20:38,606 --> 00:20:40,541
- to come down and eat?
- Yeah, Mom.

346
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,512
Jesse! Come down and eat.
Lunch is ready!

347
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,323
Jess, lunch is ready.

348
00:20:57,725 --> 00:20:59,459
Thanks for joining us.

349
00:21:15,777 --> 00:21:16,878
Paul, honey.

350
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:19,412
We're waiting for you.

351
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,282
Okay.

352
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:24,451
Okay.

353
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:41,502
Honey, just...

354
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:43,805
say the prayer,

355
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,706
so we can eat.

356
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:51,546
Bless us, oh Lord,

357
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:54,515
for thy gifts we are about
to receive from thy bounty.

358
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:58,085
- In Jesus Christ's name, amen.
- Amen.

359
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:00,688
Thank you, God.

360
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:02,690
Good and kind.

361
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:04,792
Thank you for our home

362
00:22:05,793 --> 00:22:06,861
and food.

363
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:09,329
Amen.

364
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:10,965
Amen.

365
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:14,969
Haven't heard
that one in a while.

366
00:22:16,304 --> 00:22:17,572
My dad used to say it.

367
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,406
That's right.

368
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:21,008
Here, Ma.
You want salad?

369
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:23,010
No, no, no.
No, thanks.

370
00:22:25,146 --> 00:22:26,346
You okay?

371
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:27,782
Yes, yes, I'm fine, I'm just...

372
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:31,986
just a little overwhelmed,
that's all.

373
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:34,689
Hey, Artie,
can't you offer, you know,

374
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:36,791
- to help Mom out?
- Chill out, bro. I'm tired.

375
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:38,659
- You're tired, all right, huh?
- Stop it.

376
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,329
- Stop it.
- Sorry, Mom.

377
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:44,232
But, you know, he can...
He can offer to help.

378
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:46,267
I mean, he's not a baby anymore.

379
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,711
You know,
why don't you just relax?

380
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:49,146
- Why don't you relax?
- Will you stop?

381
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,038
- Stop it, stop it!
- I'm sick of him.

382
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:52,707
Stop it.

383
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:55,810
It's just... come on.

384
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,713
Let's just have a nice,
peaceful lunch.

385
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:00,314
- All right?
- Sorry.

386
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,121
So, Dad, how's work?

387
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:09,456
Jesse.

388
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:13,694
- Fine. Yours?
- Will you let your father eat?

389
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:16,396
- No, Mom.
- Hey!

390
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:18,398
What's your problem, huh?

391
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,444
I know you drove
the maintenance cart home

392
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,037
and they fired you
from your job.

393
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:27,375
But you never told anyone
why you really got fired, Dad.

394
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,476
- He was confused.
- Confused?

395
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:30,945
Maybe it's the booze and the pot

396
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:33,413
- that's got him confused.
- Wha... What?

397
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:36,851
What in the Lord's name
are you talking about now?

398
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:39,921
I found a stash of hard liquor
and a pot pipe in Dad's truck.

399
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:42,590
Oh! I don't believe that!

400
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,457
I don't believe it either.

401
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:45,838
What are you picking on Dad for?

402
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,194
I found it in his truck.

403
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,428
Yup.

404
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,830
For somebody who's never here,

405
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:51,208
you're pretty quick
to point the finger.

406
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:52,432
Oh, like you're ever around?

407
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:54,001
- Look who's talking.
- Hey!

408
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,646
Me and Marilyn are going
through a lot right now, okay?

409
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,950
Why don't you mind
your business?

410
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:58,940
Enough! Enough!
No. Paul, wait.

411
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,241
Sit down. Paul.

412
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:02,576
Sit down, please.
Please, Paul.

413
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:04,111
Please, sweetheart.

414
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:07,915
Whatever you want to say,
we're here for you.

415
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:09,216
We want to hear it.

416
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:13,087
Just... explain to me
what Jesse found

417
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:14,622
- in the garage.
- No!

418
00:24:15,756 --> 00:24:16,791
No!

419
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:19,760
Paul,
don't just walk away from us!

420
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,729
It's mine.

421
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:25,633
What?

422
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,868
You serious?

423
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:30,604
I'm sorry.
It's... It's not a big deal.

424
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,173
It's not a big deal?

425
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:35,109
It is a big deal, mister!

426
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:36,377
<i>It's so much...</i>

427
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,012
You weren't raised this way!

428
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,448
I will not...

429
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:42,350
...Have drugs in my house!

430
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,551
Do you understand me?

431
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:46,654
You know,

432
00:24:46,754 --> 00:24:48,589
that's why you're so lazy
and quit college.

433
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:49,929
- I'm not lazy.
- Yeah, you are.

434
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:51,359
- I'm not lazy!
- Yeah, you are!

435
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:52,760
I'm not lazy. Okay?

436
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,371
You don't know
what you're talking about.

437
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:55,930
I'm doing more
around here than ever,

438
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,531
since you two
don't live here anymore.

439
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:58,709
So, don't sit there and pretend

440
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:00,101
that you know what's going on!

441
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,039
<i>All right!</i>

442
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,209
Yes!

443
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:10,144
<i>- An automobile.
- An automobile?</i>

444
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:11,812
<i>Yeah!
That's what we need.</i>

445
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:13,147
<i>I think that's good.</i>

446
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:14,315
<i>Auto!</i>

447
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:19,353
<i>TV!</i>

448
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:32,600
Ah!

449
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,207
Hey, Dad.

450
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:42,176
Thought I heard someone
out here.

451
00:25:42,743 --> 00:25:44,011
Yeah, it's me.

452
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:49,183
You know what you're doin'?

453
00:25:49,984 --> 00:25:50,984
Kinda.

454
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:53,766
Just thought it'd be kind of
cool to get it running again.

455
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,223
It'll never stop running.

456
00:25:56,824 --> 00:25:58,535
Well, you just need
to check the carburetor,

457
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,828
the spark plugs and the oil.

458
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:04,031
- Wow. You remember all that?
- Sure do.

459
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,412
Which way you wanna go?

460
00:26:18,513 --> 00:26:19,647
Ah, let's just head home.

461
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:21,615
Jeez,
there's all this construction,

462
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:22,817
all these road blocks.

463
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:25,352
Yeah.
It snows all the time.

464
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:28,622
Dad, it's not even winter yet.

465
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,239
Hey, Dad.

466
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:47,842
- This way.
- Okay.

467
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:55,783
Dad didn't know the way home.

468
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:00,321
I know.

469
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:05,259
Well, we'll just see
what the doctor says next week.

470
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:08,496
He can't leave the house alone.

471
00:27:08,597 --> 00:27:10,097
And he can't be driving either.

472
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:17,404
Sometimes
I just feel like I'm...

473
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,442
I'm staring at the man

474
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:24,278
I've been married to
my whole life.

475
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,115
But he's not here.

476
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:31,819
He's right in front of me.

477
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:35,422
Just...

478
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:38,659
I keep waiting for him to...

479
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:41,829
snap out of it.

480
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:45,866
For things
to go back to being normal.

481
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:50,004
Sometimes he's okay.

482
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,907
Sometimes he isn't.

483
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:04,051
You okay?

484
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:10,124
We're just worried
about you, Dad.

485
00:28:12,393 --> 00:28:13,595
I'm fine.

486
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:15,963
Something isn't right, Paul.

487
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,738
Okay.

488
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:33,682
Liv, hey.

489
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:36,483
Listen,
I... I can't make it to Vegas.

490
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:37,652
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

491
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,197
Things are just getting
a little crazy around here.

492
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:41,221
<i>Jesse...</i>

493
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:42,756
And I gotta stick around for...

494
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:44,124
<i>You don't have time for me.</i>

495
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,392
<i>You never really have.</i>

496
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:48,062
Liv? Liv?

497
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:18,317
You guys need anything
from inside?

498
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,994
Oh, no,
we're good, honey. Thank you.

499
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:30,639
What's so funny?

500
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:31,972
Uncle Walter just...

501
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:33,407
He ain't cuttin' it
on the grill.

502
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:35,476
Oh, so what?
You're an executive chef now?

503
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:36,711
No.

504
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,845
Hey, Allison.

505
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:39,681
Could you bring me the mustard?

506
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,215
- Sure.
- Please? Thanks.

507
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:44,294
- I mean, look at this thing.
- Yeah, I know.

508
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:46,120
How can you mess
a hot dog up, right?

509
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:49,356
- Here you go.
- Thanks, cuz.

510
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:54,028
Wow. She's getting big.

511
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:55,996
And beautiful, man.
Poor Uncle Walter.

512
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,464
Man, he's got his hands full.

513
00:29:57,565 --> 00:30:00,134
Yeah, that's why
I'm secretly praying for a boy.

514
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:02,369
So, what do the doctors say?

515
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:04,872
It's 50-50.

516
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:06,307
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

517
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:08,375
So, what's going on
with you and Liv?

518
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:09,943
Oh, she hung up on me

519
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:11,722
when I told her I was staying
for the block party.

520
00:30:11,746 --> 00:30:13,648
- Yeah.
- Ugh, that's a tough one.

521
00:30:14,014 --> 00:30:15,684
Oh, yeah.

522
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:19,887
Mom?

523
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,456
Mom, hey.
You're not eating.

524
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:25,091
Oh.

525
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:26,661
I'm not hungry.

526
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:28,162
I'm... I'm... I have no appetite.

527
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:30,297
I'm just...
I'm okay. I'm fine.

528
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,468
Have you guys seen Lisa?

529
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:36,337
She was just here a minute ago.

530
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:38,506
She was just playing
Cards of Death.

531
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:41,676
Maybe she's in the house.

532
00:30:41,776 --> 00:30:43,277
I don't know.
Art. Art.

533
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,846
Is Lisa in the house with Dad?

534
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:47,081
No. Why? What's up?

535
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,550
We can't find Dad or Lisa.

536
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:50,752
Okay, I'll, uh,
check across the street.

537
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:52,286
Okay.
All right, hold on.

538
00:30:52,386 --> 00:30:53,954
Uncle Walter,
you and Aunt Joanne,

539
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:55,465
Allison, you guys go
around this way, okay?

540
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:57,100
Tony, stay here with Mom
in case they come back.

541
00:30:57,124 --> 00:30:58,992
- I'm gonna head around back.
- Okay.

542
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:03,631
- What's going on?
- Can't find Dad.

543
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:08,969
Jesse!

544
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:14,542
You cannot tell me what to do!

545
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:17,311
We found Lisa!
Your... Your dad's over there.

546
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:20,981
You can't tell me what to do!

547
00:31:22,483 --> 00:31:25,386
- You can't tell me what to do!
- Dad!

548
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,655
I called an ambulance.

549
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:29,289
No, no, no, no.
Please, why? He's fine.

550
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,760
Look, he walked
in our house unannounced.

551
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,995
He said he lives here,
acted disoriented.

552
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:36,430
And he got agitated,

553
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,251
- so I called the ambulance.
- Okay. No, no.

554
00:31:38,298 --> 00:31:39,868
No need for ambulance.
Okay? Please.

555
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:41,311
My... My dad, he just...
Lately, he just... he just

556
00:31:41,335 --> 00:31:43,135
- gets confused, all right?
- Con... confused?

557
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:44,603
Look,
I'll call them back right now,

558
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,574
but I think there's
something wrong with him.

559
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:48,710
What do you mean I'm confused?

560
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,712
Everything's fine, okay?

561
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:51,979
We're just gonna go home.

562
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,014
Everybody's there.
All right?

563
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,017
Come on.

564
00:31:57,652 --> 00:31:59,554
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

565
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:01,589
I'm really sorry.

566
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:11,533
Hey.

567
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:13,868
Hey. You didn't tell me

568
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:15,044
you were
coming home this morning.

569
00:32:15,068 --> 00:32:16,146
Well, I didn't get a chance

570
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,471
to after you hung up on me.

571
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:21,810
Come here.

572
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:24,244
Liv, come on, don't stay mad.

573
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,481
I am sorry about Vegas.

574
00:32:27,582 --> 00:32:28,982
I will make it up to you.

575
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:32,085
You know,
my family needs me, too.

576
00:32:33,253 --> 00:32:35,389
I... I gotta get to work.

577
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:46,099
Hey. Good morning, Jesse!
How was your trip?

578
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,069
It was really great, thanks.
Is Mr. Stewart busy...

579
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:50,705
Is that Jesse?
Come on in, son.

580
00:32:51,238 --> 00:32:53,207
Hey, can I get you
a coffee or a water?

581
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,876
- Uh, water's fine, thanks.
- Okay.

582
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,544
Helen,
I'll take a water, too, please.

583
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:57,846
Okay, you've got it.

584
00:32:57,946 --> 00:32:59,647
I was just gonna
call you into my office.

585
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:02,584
You must have... Well, what...
What do they call that there?

586
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:04,719
- Um...
- Uh, ESP.

587
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:08,523
That's it. Yeah, ESP.

588
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:10,224
So, how's it going?
How's your dad?

589
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:12,192
Uh, thanks for asking.

590
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:14,103
We'll find out what's going on
after his doctor's appointment.

591
00:33:14,127 --> 00:33:15,462
Well, son,

592
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:18,265
prepare for the worst
and hope for the best.

593
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:22,145
- Thanks, Helen. Uh...
- Joe, you're welcome.

594
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,471
- Hold my calls, please.
- Okay, Joe.

595
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:28,877
I'm okay, Mr. Stewart.

596
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:30,210
Please.

597
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,213
My dad was Mr. Stewart.
Call me Joe.

598
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:36,993
Well, this whole thing
with my dad has been tough.

599
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,887
It's put a strain
on my relationship

600
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:40,187
with my girlfriend, too.

601
00:33:40,287 --> 00:33:41,956
Yeah.
Women will guilt you.

602
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:45,092
Look, you take
as much time as you need.

603
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:47,194
Oh, I wanted to thank you

604
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:48,338
for giving me
a couple extra days off

605
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:49,697
to be with my family.

606
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:51,298
Son, family's first.

607
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,333
And I want to thank you

608
00:33:53,433 --> 00:33:55,003
for coming up
with a marketing strategy

609
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:58,540
that sold 42,000 units
in less than 42 days.

610
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:02,442
- Really?
- Yep.

611
00:34:02,544 --> 00:34:04,646
Where did you ever
come up with the idea

612
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:06,179
to do a bobblehead doll?

613
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,048
Oh, well, when I was a kid,

614
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:10,117
my dad would take us
to all the games at UNO.

615
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:12,520
They had a Bobblehead night
and we collected them.

616
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:15,322
I mean,
we never missed a game, Mr...

617
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,324
Joe.

618
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:19,293
Well, it was genius.

619
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:20,929
I remember when I was a kid,

620
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:22,630
my dad took me
to a World Series game

621
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,800
and I got a Roberto Clemente
bobblehead doll.

622
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,301
It meant the world to me.

623
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:29,971
I like a man that
brings passion to his job.

624
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:32,472
I sense
a decent raise next quarter.

625
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:47,855
Great.

626
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,325
Now, would you mind
if I tested your memory?

627
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,362
- Okay.
- Okay.

628
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:57,741
Could you repeat
these three words after me?

629
00:34:57,765 --> 00:35:00,835
- Okay.
- Apple, table, penny.

630
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,403
Apple, table, penny.

631
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:06,173
Do you know what month it is?

632
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:08,676
It... It's August.

633
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:13,389
Now, Paul,
remember those three words

634
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:15,049
- from a minute ago?
- Yes.

635
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,552
Great, can you repeat them
again, please?

636
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:31,231
Okay.

637
00:35:31,331 --> 00:35:32,634
Do you know what year it is?

638
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:36,203
No.

639
00:35:40,273 --> 00:35:41,843
How about who the president is?

640
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:43,578
Bill Clinton.

641
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:48,750
How old are you, Paul?

642
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,318
Um, 51.

643
00:35:58,793 --> 00:35:59,861
Okay.

644
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:02,530
You know, just one last thing
I need from you.

645
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:04,699
I want you to draw
a clock for me.

646
00:36:05,298 --> 00:36:06,500
Can you do that?

647
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:08,603
- Sure. Of course.
- Great.

648
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:11,238
Here you go.

649
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:27,789
Okay.

650
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:32,225
All right.
Thank you, Paul.

651
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:38,800
I'm gonna need
to go over these tests.

652
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Mm.

653
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,301
I'm gonna refer you for some

654
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,302
more memory tests
and also to our specialist,

655
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:43,571
Dr. McFadden.

656
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:45,139
You may need to have a PET scan.

657
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:52,580
Hi, Paul!

658
00:36:53,981 --> 00:36:55,282
Please just lay down here.

659
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,884
Yeah, have a seat right here.

660
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,922
You're gonna want to make sure

661
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:02,166
your head is in the right place.

662
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,457
Perfect!

663
00:37:04,192 --> 00:37:05,459
All right.

664
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,128
Now, I'm gonna put
these velcro straps

665
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:10,464
around your arms
during our scout of your brain.

666
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:12,900
'Cause I can't have you
movin' around on me.

667
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:15,670
And I will be blindfolding you.

668
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,838
Wha... Why?

669
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:19,439
There is a very bright laser

670
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,109
that triggers
rapid eye movements

671
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:23,911
and that causes brain activity
that could hurt the test.

672
00:37:25,345 --> 00:37:27,347
I'm gonna be in that
computer room right there.

673
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:33,588
Perfect.

674
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:37,390
Hang in there, Paul.
I'll be right back.

675
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,618
Paul, Paul, Paul, Paul.

676
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:05,253
You're not supposed
to leave the room.

677
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:06,554
What's wrong? What's wrong?

678
00:38:06,654 --> 00:38:08,656
He got up before
we could finish the scan.

679
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:11,391
Oh. Paul.

680
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:14,796
- You have to go back in there.
- No.

681
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:16,964
Why? Why?

682
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:22,904
- Why?
- I'm scared.

683
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:25,807
Honey.

684
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:27,340
It's okay.

685
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,510
I know... I know this is hard.

686
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,344
I want to go home.
I just want to go home.

687
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:32,880
I know you're scared.

688
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:35,950
But we have to do this.

689
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:43,791
Okay.

690
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,226
- Okay.
- Okay.

691
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:47,028
Come on.
I'll go in there with you.

692
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:56,137
So, based
on these initial test results,

693
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:57,514
it looks like
we're dealing with some

694
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:59,140
dementia and memory loss,

695
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,143
which is uncommon
for a 58-year-old.

696
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,613
But once we get the PET scan
results back next week,

697
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:07,248
we can, uh,

698
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:09,217
start to move forward,

699
00:39:09,317 --> 00:39:12,520
evaluate, monitor the extent
of the cerebral deterioration.

700
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:15,388
And allow for a full diagnosis.

701
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,457
Dementia?

702
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,227
Yes.

703
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:20,647
I'm gonna
give you some literature

704
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:22,215
that'll help
your family deal with this

705
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:24,031
and suggest
some local support groups.

706
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:29,136
Um, can he, uh... So, can he...
Can he still drive?

707
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,039
It's probably best he doesn't.

708
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,406
You say he's been getting lost.

709
00:39:33,507 --> 00:39:34,775
I'm a good driver.

710
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:36,510
Oh.

711
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:38,813
You're a great driver, Paul.

712
00:39:40,081 --> 00:39:41,282
For the most part,

713
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,793
you're in perfect health,
Mr. Reeves.

714
00:39:42,817 --> 00:39:43,885
But, um,

715
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:45,629
there's no doubt
you've been having

716
00:39:45,653 --> 00:39:47,054
some trouble with your memory.

717
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:48,421
I have good memory.

718
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,160
Does he know
anything is wrong with him?

719
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:55,596
Why don't you ask him?

720
00:39:58,532 --> 00:39:59,800
Hey, Dad.

721
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:02,503
Do you realize
you have dementia?

722
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:04,605
No.

723
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:07,108
Dr. McFadden says you do.

724
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:10,044
Dad,

725
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:11,746
do you remember who we are?

726
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:14,382
Yep.

727
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:16,416
Okay, um,

728
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:19,086
who... who's present here,
Dad, right now?

729
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:23,724
Art, Anne, Tony and...

730
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:37,738
I'm... I'm your son.

731
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:41,642
Jesse. That's Jesse.

732
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:47,315
Okay, uh, I'm gonna
write the prescription

733
00:40:47,415 --> 00:40:48,625
and... and get you that list...

734
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:49,917
That's it?

735
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:51,662
I thought you were a specialist.

736
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:52,829
- I... I thought...
- Jesse, take it easy.

737
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:53,988
Hold on.

738
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:57,959
Let me ask you a question,
doctor, how old are you?

739
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,227
I'm 37.

740
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:02,129
Okay.

741
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:03,273
So, what experience do you have

742
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,732
with this disease to tell us

743
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:06,901
that my dad has dementia?

744
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:12,606
My grandfather
died from dementia.

745
00:41:12,707 --> 00:41:13,908
That's what inspired me

746
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:15,843
to study
memory loss and brain disease.

747
00:41:17,044 --> 00:41:20,381
Look, I... I... I know
you're upset.

748
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,583
I felt exactly the same way.

749
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:25,353
You're not alone.

750
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:29,123
There's over five million
Americans with this disease.

751
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:33,227
I'm sorry.

752
00:41:34,428 --> 00:41:35,763
It's okay.

753
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:39,600
Just... It's... It's like
we're losing him

754
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,801
right in front of our eyes.

755
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:44,271
It's one of the
cruel tragedies of dementia.

756
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:49,276
It's like you have to lose
the person you love twice.

757
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:53,381
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

758
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:56,851
Good.
It's good. It's good.

759
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:50,905
Hey!

760
00:42:57,912 --> 00:42:59,346
You gonna run it yet?

761
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:01,649
Uh, I'm hopin'
those new spark plugs

762
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,184
will do the trick.

763
00:43:15,396 --> 00:43:16,697
No. Just stop it!

764
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,299
Just stop.
You're floodin' it.

765
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:27,174
A'right,
try it again with no gas!

766
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:32,613
Yes. Ha!

767
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:35,616
What'd you do?

768
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:37,184
Ah...

769
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:39,487
I just adjusted the carburetor.

770
00:43:39,588 --> 00:43:41,122
You had it
running a little rich.

771
00:43:41,956 --> 00:43:43,757
Ah, it's my pride and joy.

772
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:46,093
I remember
when I bought this thing.

773
00:43:47,562 --> 00:43:48,829
Used to be red.

774
00:43:50,364 --> 00:43:51,866
Paid $200 for it.

775
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:53,834
Two hundred, really?

776
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:56,137
Yup.

777
00:43:56,237 --> 00:43:58,172
May 10th, 1973.

778
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:02,643
How did you remember that date?

779
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:09,083
Fir... First time
I told your mom I loved her.

780
00:44:13,522 --> 00:44:16,157
So, just leave her idle.

781
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:20,127
Let her warm up.
You can take her for a spin.

782
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:21,395
All right.

783
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,168
So, I was thinking.

784
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:29,403
How'd you like to go fishing?

785
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,907
We could take the truck.

786
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:36,977
- Up to the Snowies?
- Yeah.

787
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:41,015
Huh. We'd need a mechanic.

788
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:43,984
Nah, I got you.

789
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:48,222
Okay.

790
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,494
Hello? Hey!

791
00:44:53,595 --> 00:44:54,929
<i>Hey.
How's your dad?</i>

792
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,633
Uh, not so good.

793
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:00,602
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

794
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:03,837
<i>I need to talk to you about
something important and...</i>

795
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:06,073
<i>And what?</i>

796
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:09,810
Jesse, your family
needs you and I understand.

797
00:45:10,211 --> 00:45:11,580
But so do I.

798
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,760
<i>You don't have time for me.</i>

799
00:45:12,846 --> 00:45:14,448
<i>You never really have.</i>

800
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:16,193
<i>I don't want to sound selfish,
but I'm moving out.</i>

801
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:17,818
Can we talk about this, please?

802
00:45:18,653 --> 00:45:19,820
It's best we both move on.

803
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,488
Come on,
don't do this to me, Liv.

804
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:22,870
You know what I'm goin' through.

805
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:24,659
I hope everything
works out with your dad.

806
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:30,231
Take care.

807
00:45:43,545 --> 00:45:44,878
You okay?

808
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:48,048
Yeah.
Fine, Mom.

809
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:06,267
Let me help you with that.

810
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:09,504
No.

811
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:11,272
No.

812
00:46:11,372 --> 00:46:12,707
My palm's been itching.

813
00:46:12,806 --> 00:46:14,475
I know
money's coming soon. Um...

814
00:46:16,176 --> 00:46:19,446
Okay, but in the meantime,
let me help you with that.

815
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:21,915
Mm-mm.
I have faith.

816
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:24,785
God will provide. No.

817
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:27,221
- Okay.
- But thank you.

818
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,189
- All right.
- Yeah.

819
00:46:30,692 --> 00:46:32,860
Or something else.

820
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,862
Dad and I were just talking.

821
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:36,765
And if it's all right with you,

822
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:38,032
I want to take him fishing

823
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:40,267
for a couple days
up to the Snowies.

824
00:46:41,536 --> 00:46:43,470
Um, hmm.

825
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:45,005
I know, I know.

826
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,907
I know everything going on.

827
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:48,207
But he hasn't been in a while.

828
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:50,244
Be good for him to get some air.

829
00:46:50,878 --> 00:46:52,318
Get out of the city
for a little bit.

830
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:54,582
We'll take Stella.
Get out of your hair.

831
00:46:58,385 --> 00:47:00,220
- Will you think about it?
- Maybe. Maybe.

832
00:47:00,321 --> 00:47:01,322
Okay.

833
00:47:01,422 --> 00:47:02,700
Let me just
give it some thought.

834
00:47:02,724 --> 00:47:04,391
Okay. All right.

835
00:47:11,766 --> 00:47:12,833
What's up, man?

836
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:14,536
"What's up?"
No phone call?

837
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:16,403
I'm sorry, man.

838
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:18,405
You want to go get a drink?

839
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:22,544
Um, it's not
really a good night, man.

840
00:47:22,644 --> 00:47:24,311
There's a lot going on.

841
00:47:24,746 --> 00:47:25,946
I mean, you know I'm here

842
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:27,915
if you ever need
to talk to anybody.

843
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:29,617
I know, thanks.

844
00:47:32,721 --> 00:47:36,890
Hey, um, guess who's
on her porch reading right now?

845
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:38,392
Oh, yeah?

846
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,495
I'll leave you alone, bro.

847
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,441
Hey, I'll call you
tomorrow, all right?

848
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:45,567
Make sure you do.

849
00:48:05,152 --> 00:48:06,887
Hey.
What ya readin'?

850
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:10,859
A book.

851
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,493
Welcome back.

852
00:48:12,594 --> 00:48:14,061
No place like home.

853
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:16,897
That thing still runs?

854
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:18,432
I know, right?

855
00:48:19,768 --> 00:48:21,068
Can I sit down?

856
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,070
Yeah.

857
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,114
Surprised to see you out here.

858
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:36,350
Oh, really?
At my house?

859
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:42,156
I wanted to talk to you.

860
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:48,530
I didn't mean
to leave you hanging.

861
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,069
So, you didn't mean
to leave me hanging?

862
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,471
You just left me hanging.

863
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,441
The money's good.
What do you want me to say?

864
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:01,609
Money's good?

865
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:03,377
'Cause last time I heard,

866
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:06,614
um, you could have had
a great job in Omaha,

867
00:49:06,714 --> 00:49:07,849
making that kind of money.

868
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,283
I mean, UNO wanted to hire you

869
00:49:09,383 --> 00:49:11,786
for, like,
their sales marketing team

870
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:13,555
for the exact
same amount of money.

871
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:15,088
Well, maybe I wanted

872
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:17,029
to experience something
outside of Omaha, okay?

873
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:20,695
That was your lesson.

874
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:24,298
Well, I'm gonna
go have some tea.

875
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:31,405
Do you want tea?

876
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,434
Good morning.

877
00:50:39,841 --> 00:50:40,909
Morning.

878
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,076
Looks like your tea's cold.

879
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:47,414
There's coffee in the pot.

880
00:50:48,917 --> 00:50:50,018
Wow. I'm sorry.

881
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:51,451
I... I guess with the flight

882
00:50:51,553 --> 00:50:52,963
and just everything
going on with my dad,

883
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:55,623
I just... it took a toll on me.

884
00:50:58,492 --> 00:51:01,128
Well, your phone
has been ringing like crazy.

885
00:51:01,996 --> 00:51:03,731
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

886
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,065
It's okay.

887
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:07,167
Um, I actually
have to get going.

888
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:09,202
Gonna be late for work.

889
00:51:10,103 --> 00:51:13,041
Uh, is it cool for you
to let yourself out?

890
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,108
- Yeah. It's okay with you?
- Mm-hmm.

891
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,645
- Okay.
- Just lock the bottom.

892
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:19,514
I remember.

893
00:51:20,014 --> 00:51:21,415
Thanks for letting me crash.

894
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:23,350
Of course.

895
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:25,061
All right,
well, have a good day.

896
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,420
Okay.
Have a good day at work.

897
00:51:26,521 --> 00:51:28,155
All right. Thank you.

898
00:51:42,837 --> 00:51:44,005
Morning.

899
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:45,172
You could've called.

900
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:46,473
I know.
I'm sorry.

901
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:48,342
Well, I... I don't like it.

902
00:51:48,776 --> 00:51:50,044
You call me next time.

903
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,211
Deal.

904
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:53,548
So, where you been all nigh?

905
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:57,451
Uh, I mean, I was wiped.
I just fell asleep at April's.

906
00:51:58,151 --> 00:52:00,454
Not like that, Mom, but yeah.

907
00:52:00,855 --> 00:52:03,891
Okay. I'm gonna go shower.
I'll see you in a bit.

908
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:20,575
Hey. What's up?

909
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,745
Heard you were gonna
take dad fishing.

910
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:25,546
Yeah, just for the weekend.

911
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:28,116
Did you check the weather?

912
00:52:28,215 --> 00:52:30,585
Clear skies.
I got the tents just in case.

913
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:33,153
You think
it's a good idea to take him?

914
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:34,589
Yeah. Why not?

915
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:36,924
Because he can
barely remember who you are.

916
00:52:37,025 --> 00:52:38,191
That's why.

917
00:52:38,593 --> 00:52:40,513
Well, he remembered
how to get the truck running.

918
00:52:41,696 --> 00:52:44,164
Yeah, well,
I don't think it's a good idea.

919
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:46,500
Okay.

920
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,336
What do you mean, "Okay"?
That's it? "Okay"?

921
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:52,640
He loves it up there, Tony.
You know that.

922
00:52:54,609 --> 00:52:56,410
Are you sure you can handle it?

923
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:58,913
I am sure.

924
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:01,481
I don't know.

925
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:06,286
Hey.

926
00:53:07,254 --> 00:53:08,656
Mom deserves a break.

927
00:53:09,157 --> 00:53:10,424
True.

928
00:53:11,258 --> 00:53:13,528
Well, think this old
heap's gonna make it?

929
00:53:13,628 --> 00:53:15,997
This old heap is what Dad used
to pick us up from school in.

930
00:53:16,097 --> 00:53:18,198
- You remember that?
- Yeah, I do.

931
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:20,400
And we used to fight
over the window seat.

932
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,469
Exactly. Yeah.

933
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,105
She's runnin' like a champ.

934
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:26,507
Don't worry about it.
Hey, we'll be fine.

935
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:28,976
Keep your eye on him, huh?

936
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:55,903
What the heck are you doing?

937
00:53:58,139 --> 00:53:59,272
Stella, huh?

938
00:53:59,372 --> 00:54:00,675
What do you think of this, huh?

939
00:54:00,775 --> 00:54:01,876
Yeah!

940
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,178
Hey, there's a stockyard.

941
00:54:04,277 --> 00:54:05,613
Do you want to get some food?

942
00:54:06,147 --> 00:54:07,414
Yep.

943
00:54:36,043 --> 00:54:37,178
Hey, guys.

944
00:54:37,612 --> 00:54:39,580
- I'm Jolene.
- Hey, Jolene.

945
00:54:40,248 --> 00:54:42,817
Uh, burger with everything.

946
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:44,018
Great.

947
00:54:49,657 --> 00:54:51,324
- Dad, what do you want to eat?
- Burger.

948
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:52,960
How would you like it cooked?

949
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,695
- Medium.
- With everything?

950
00:54:57,364 --> 00:54:58,942
Hey, Dad, what do you want
on your burger?

951
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:00,635
Oh, no mustard.

952
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:02,036
You always want mustard.

953
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:03,136
I don't want mustard.

954
00:55:04,005 --> 00:55:05,125
He always gets mustard, I...

955
00:55:05,173 --> 00:55:07,008
Do you want mustard?

956
00:55:07,742 --> 00:55:08,643
Yeah.

957
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:09,977
Okay.
We'll get you mustard.

958
00:55:10,077 --> 00:55:11,846
I don't want any mustard!

959
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:14,982
Fine.

960
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:16,584
No mustard, please.

961
00:55:16,684 --> 00:55:20,588
Okay, great.
Two burgers, one no mustard.

962
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:23,423
- Thank you.
- Be right up.

963
00:55:25,827 --> 00:55:28,095
- Hey, she's cute, huh, Dad?
- Yeah.

964
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,207
Hey, that was
a little embarrassing

965
00:55:30,231 --> 00:55:31,232
with the mustard, though.

966
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:32,600
Yeah.

967
00:55:33,466 --> 00:55:34,769
He's sure agreeable.

968
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,505
Can you get that?

969
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,609
Pick that up.

970
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:44,411
Don't touch that!

971
00:55:45,313 --> 00:55:47,215
Dad.

972
00:55:47,315 --> 00:55:50,017
Wow. I'm real...
I'm so sorry.

973
00:55:50,918 --> 00:55:51,919
I'm sorry.

974
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,688
Shou... Shouldn't touch that.

975
00:55:54,288 --> 00:55:55,790
Dad, what are you doing?

976
00:55:56,157 --> 00:55:57,325
That's someone else's kid.

977
00:55:57,457 --> 00:55:58,960
- Yup.
- All right...

978
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,095
- Stop saying yep.
- Two burgers.

979
00:56:01,996 --> 00:56:03,998
- One, no mustard.
- Wow. That was fast.

980
00:56:04,098 --> 00:56:05,398
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

981
00:56:06,267 --> 00:56:07,635
Looks great, huh?

982
00:56:08,236 --> 00:56:09,502
Where's my mustard?

983
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,822
We're almost there.

984
00:56:29,456 --> 00:56:30,858
Think we'll catch anything?

985
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:36,831
Always do.

986
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:38,465
No, you always do.

987
00:56:41,335 --> 00:56:42,670
It's a four-count rhythm.

988
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:46,841
Ten, two o'clock,
10, two o'clock.

989
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:49,152
Yeah, I mean,
that's what you always tell me

990
00:56:49,176 --> 00:56:50,578
but I can never figure it out.

991
00:56:56,517 --> 00:56:57,919
You try too hard.

992
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,088
Maybe.

993
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:16,304
Ten and two, 10, two...

994
00:57:16,404 --> 00:57:17,672
Ah!

995
00:57:18,572 --> 00:57:20,608
You need to relax
and not try so hard.

996
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:23,177
You might catch a fish.

997
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,081
It's looking good.

998
00:57:38,993 --> 00:57:40,061
Boom!

999
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:41,429
Hey, hey, hey!

1000
00:57:41,529 --> 00:57:43,230
Ah, you got one!

1001
00:57:50,438 --> 00:57:51,505
One second.

1002
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:53,174
There's dinner right there.

1003
00:57:59,347 --> 00:58:00,614
This is nice.

1004
00:58:01,449 --> 00:58:02,683
Yep.

1005
00:58:03,517 --> 00:58:05,286
Church of the great outdoors.

1006
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:08,332
Yeah, I can remember
being eight years old,

1007
00:58:08,356 --> 00:58:09,657
coming here for the first time.

1008
00:58:13,694 --> 00:58:15,930
You... You remember
when Art fell in the river?

1009
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:18,933
You remember that?

1010
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:24,071
He sunk like a stone.

1011
00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:26,240
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

1012
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,976
Yeah, and you just
jumped in straight after him.

1013
00:58:29,477 --> 00:58:31,912
No hesitation.
No thinking, no fear.

1014
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,253
No option.

1015
00:58:42,456 --> 00:58:43,758
Guess not.

1016
00:58:46,927 --> 00:58:48,629
But not everyone's like you.

1017
00:58:51,832 --> 00:58:53,300
That's why I love you, Dad.

1018
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,148
So...

1019
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,052
what do you think
about what Dr. McFadden said?

1020
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:16,857
Nothing.

1021
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:19,927
Dementia's
a pretty serious thing.

1022
00:59:24,198 --> 00:59:25,199
I'm fine.

1023
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:26,434
Dad.

1024
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:29,136
You're not fine.
You need help.

1025
00:59:30,805 --> 00:59:32,039
I don't need help.

1026
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,707
Okay.
You don't need help?

1027
00:59:33,808 --> 00:59:35,876
Okay. Everything's fine.

1028
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:39,780
It's just hard on Mom.

1029
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:43,217
She's fine.

1030
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:46,120
Yeah, she's strong...

1031
00:59:47,888 --> 00:59:49,857
but everything falls on her now.

1032
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,662
Come on, Stella.

1033
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:56,697
Stella.

1034
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:01,235
Come on, bed, bed.

1035
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,094
Dad?

1036
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:31,899
Dad.

1037
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:35,970
Dad?

1038
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:03,565
All right, everybody,

1039
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:05,064
we're gonna break
into three groups.

1040
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:07,101
We're gonna walk down
the bank of the river

1041
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:08,869
for about a mile
in each direction.

1042
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:10,680
Then we'll circle back here
and meet in one hour,

1043
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:13,040
at which point we should have
some air support from Albany.

1044
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,576
I've got
two deputies rounding up

1045
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:15,852
more volunteers
to come in and help.

1046
01:01:15,876 --> 01:01:16,953
They should be out here by then.

1047
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:18,679
- Great.
- We'll find him.

1048
01:01:18,779 --> 01:01:21,248
The highest probability's
in this area right here.

1049
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:23,851
If he's not,
we'll move on to stage two.

1050
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:25,319
Copy.

1051
01:01:25,419 --> 01:01:27,087
I just want to say thank you,

1052
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:29,023
you know, everyone,
f... for helping us out.

1053
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:32,159
Yeah. That's what we do.
Let's move out, everybody.

1054
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:40,334
Dad!

1055
01:01:40,434 --> 01:01:41,902
Mr. Reeves!

1056
01:01:48,108 --> 01:01:49,276
Dad!

1057
01:01:51,478 --> 01:01:53,380
Dad! Hello!

1058
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:55,816
Dad.

1059
01:01:56,651 --> 01:01:58,252
Mr. Reeves!

1060
01:02:03,324 --> 01:02:04,792
Dad!

1061
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:07,461
Mr. Reeves!

1062
01:02:09,698 --> 01:02:10,965
- Sir?
- Yes?

1063
01:02:11,065 --> 01:02:12,733
How much more ground
is there to cover?

1064
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,836
Well, we've pretty much gone
as far north as possible.

1065
01:02:15,936 --> 01:02:17,771
So, we'll swing back around here

1066
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:19,273
and head back to camp.

1067
01:02:29,783 --> 01:02:31,118
Mr. Reeves!

1068
01:02:31,218 --> 01:02:33,320
Stella, where's Dad?
She wants to go this way.

1069
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,522
Let's go.

1070
01:02:35,122 --> 01:02:36,190
Dad!

1071
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:38,292
Mr. Reeves!

1072
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:44,365
Dad?

1073
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:46,433
Dad!

1074
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:49,436
You're okay!

1075
01:02:49,537 --> 01:02:50,538
Yup.

1076
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:51,639
Dad, we've been searching

1077
01:02:51,673 --> 01:02:52,940
all over for you.

1078
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:56,977
Hey, you can't
just walk off like that.

1079
01:02:57,344 --> 01:02:58,613
Are you okay, sir?

1080
01:02:58,713 --> 01:02:59,980
I'm fine.

1081
01:03:02,016 --> 01:03:04,084
- Hey.
- Can we go for a walk?

1082
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:06,554
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can we go for a walk?

1083
01:03:08,422 --> 01:03:09,990
Stella, let's walk.

1084
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:15,229
Come on.

1085
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:19,233
We found him.
Call it off.

1086
01:03:30,612 --> 01:03:31,879
There you go.

1087
01:03:35,149 --> 01:03:37,951
Hey, guys.
How's it goin'?

1088
01:03:39,053 --> 01:03:40,689
Uh, it's been a rough morning,

1089
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:42,022
but we're doing okay.

1090
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:44,892
I know what you mean.
Uh, let me get you some menus.

1091
01:03:44,992 --> 01:03:46,393
No, I think
we know what we want.

1092
01:03:48,295 --> 01:03:49,363
Two burgers,

1093
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:51,498
mustard on the side
just in case?

1094
01:03:52,099 --> 01:03:53,334
Dad, that sound good to you?

1095
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:54,669
No mustard.

1096
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:56,212
Okay, it'll be
on the side just in case.

1097
01:03:56,236 --> 01:03:58,405
- I don't want mustard.
- Okay.

1098
01:03:58,506 --> 01:03:59,741
I'll take two burgers

1099
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,510
with two mustards
on the side just in case.

1100
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:03,877
Great.

1101
01:04:08,382 --> 01:04:10,184
Dad, you really
scared me out there.

1102
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:12,353
- Yup.
- Yeah.

1103
01:04:12,453 --> 01:04:14,556
Dad, you can't do that.
We worry about you.

1104
01:04:16,758 --> 01:04:18,636
I think we should start going
to dementia support groups

1105
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:19,893
when we get back.

1106
01:04:19,993 --> 01:04:21,513
- I'm fine.
- No, Dad, you're not fine!

1107
01:04:21,563 --> 01:04:22,807
You just disappeared on me,
and we had to call in

1108
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:24,031
the rescue team to find you.

1109
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:26,166
Dad, sit down,
sit down, what are you doing?

1110
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:27,702
Dad, we just ordered food.

1111
01:04:27,802 --> 01:04:28,902
- Sit down, Dad!
- No!

1112
01:04:29,002 --> 01:04:30,904
We just ordered food!
Dad!

1113
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:34,475
Dad, what're you...

1114
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:36,877
Dad, that's not our car!

1115
01:04:36,977 --> 01:04:38,212
I'm going home!

1116
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:39,590
Okay, Dad,
but our truck's over here.

1117
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:40,782
No!

1118
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,449
Dad, Stella's waiting for us.

1119
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:45,185
Dad.

1120
01:04:46,721 --> 01:04:48,088
Okay. Come on.

1121
01:04:48,188 --> 01:04:49,323
Come on.

1122
01:04:50,157 --> 01:04:51,802
- Where are we going?
- Dad, we're going home.

1123
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:53,193
Okay.

1124
01:05:05,406 --> 01:05:06,940
Hey! Hey!

1125
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:11,111
Thanks. Sorry about that.

1126
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:13,380
It's okay.

1127
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:20,954
I'll get you some change.

1128
01:05:21,054 --> 01:05:22,423
No, don't worry about it.

1129
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:25,993
Here, Dad, hold that, okay?

1130
01:05:29,864 --> 01:05:31,733
- What'd you get?
- Two burgers.

1131
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:34,001
- With mustard?
- Yeah, with mustard.

1132
01:05:42,677 --> 01:05:44,178
Come on.

1133
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:45,446
Come on.

1134
01:05:45,547 --> 01:05:47,615
Start! Come on!

1135
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:51,686
Stop.
You'll flood it.

1136
01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:52,887
What are we gonna do, then?

1137
01:05:52,986 --> 01:05:54,321
Hold this.

1138
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:07,434
Try it now!

1139
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:12,540
See?

1140
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:16,678
Stella.

1141
01:06:17,745 --> 01:06:19,079
You got your sunglasses on?

1142
01:06:20,447 --> 01:06:22,049
Yeah, I got my sunglasses on.

1143
01:06:22,149 --> 01:06:23,718
Okay, let's go home!

1144
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:40,568
What happened up there, Jesse?

1145
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:43,103
Mom, he was catching fish.
He was happy.

1146
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:45,673
Things were goin' great
and he just wandered off...

1147
01:06:45,773 --> 01:06:47,074
He can't take care of himself.

1148
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:48,877
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine!

1149
01:06:48,977 --> 01:06:50,220
You can't take care of yourself.

1150
01:06:50,244 --> 01:06:52,012
You could've died out there!

1151
01:07:01,656 --> 01:07:03,457
I didn't know it was that bad.

1152
01:07:04,157 --> 01:07:05,560
It's my fault.

1153
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,196
He's gotten a lot worse

1154
01:07:09,296 --> 01:07:11,164
in the months you've been gone.

1155
01:07:11,933 --> 01:07:13,433
I see it now.

1156
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:18,740
I just want to protect him.

1157
01:07:20,942 --> 01:07:22,010
Paul.

1158
01:07:22,844 --> 01:07:26,014
As we suspected, you're dealing
with a pretty advanced case

1159
01:07:26,113 --> 01:07:27,815
of frontotemporal dementia.

1160
01:07:28,816 --> 01:07:29,984
And what that means

1161
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:33,320
is your memory
is deteriorating rapidly.

1162
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,323
You have atrophy in
the frontal lobes of your brain

1163
01:07:36,423 --> 01:07:40,260
and it's causing memory loss
and behavioral changes.

1164
01:07:41,763 --> 01:07:42,830
We understand.

1165
01:07:47,669 --> 01:07:48,970
Dementia is progressive.

1166
01:07:49,069 --> 01:07:51,104
It's... It's fatal.
There's no cure.

1167
01:07:51,606 --> 01:07:52,472
Fatal?

1168
01:07:52,574 --> 01:07:54,241
The good news is

1169
01:07:54,341 --> 01:07:56,945
there's none of the common
co-occurring illnesses.

1170
01:07:57,045 --> 01:08:00,014
No diabetes,
no heart disease, no cancer.

1171
01:08:00,113 --> 01:08:01,481
How's it fatal, then?

1172
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:05,687
Well, in the latter stages
there is brain cell depletion,

1173
01:08:05,787 --> 01:08:07,822
which leads to a loss
of basic functions

1174
01:08:07,922 --> 01:08:11,025
like swallowing, causing
respiratory complications

1175
01:08:11,124 --> 01:08:12,994
and often developing
into pneumonia.

1176
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:14,194
So, what can we do?

1177
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:16,774
Well, let's get Paul
started on those medications

1178
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:21,268
and get him to exercise
and have a lot of family time.

1179
01:08:21,769 --> 01:08:23,538
Make sure he's eating
the foods that he likes

1180
01:08:23,638 --> 01:08:26,708
and doing puzzles
and showing him a lot of photos

1181
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:28,208
of family and friends.

1182
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:31,613
Really, just keep loving him.

1183
01:08:33,915 --> 01:08:35,248
How long does he have?

1184
01:08:36,751 --> 01:08:39,353
The disease tends
to run a ten-year cycle.

1185
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:41,455
He's roughly halfway through it.

1186
01:08:43,357 --> 01:08:46,126
Is it hereditary?

1187
01:08:46,794 --> 01:08:48,362
Well, Anne mentioned

1188
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:51,498
that Paul's grandfather and
mother both had the disease.

1189
01:08:53,534 --> 01:08:55,302
So... So, what are you saying?

1190
01:08:56,537 --> 01:08:59,941
With Paul being the third
consecutive generation,

1191
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,309
the three of you
have about a 50% chance

1192
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:04,144
of developing what your dad has.

1193
01:09:14,055 --> 01:09:15,155
So, how about your kids?

1194
01:09:15,255 --> 01:09:16,591
They doing good?

1195
01:09:16,691 --> 01:09:18,258
Oh, yeah, man.
They're doing great.

1196
01:09:18,358 --> 01:09:19,737
My parents come over
all the time, you know?

1197
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:22,329
So, I... I've never
seen them so happy.

1198
01:09:23,731 --> 01:09:24,832
That's awesome.

1199
01:09:26,634 --> 01:09:28,244
Yeah, my little cousins,
Allison and Lisa,

1200
01:09:28,268 --> 01:09:30,203
they never got
to know their grandparents.

1201
01:09:31,304 --> 01:09:32,540
Yeah, that's too bad.

1202
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:36,309
I wish my dad would get
to be a grandpa. Um...

1203
01:09:37,377 --> 01:09:38,846
You know, Tony and Marilyn,

1204
01:09:38,946 --> 01:09:41,214
they're trying but
there's complications, and...

1205
01:09:43,117 --> 01:09:46,286
It bothers me...
that he might not get to...

1206
01:09:46,386 --> 01:09:49,891
That my kids someday will, um,

1207
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:52,093
never get to know this strong,

1208
01:09:52,225 --> 01:09:54,194
intelligent, amazing guy

1209
01:09:54,294 --> 01:09:55,654
that they would
call their grandpa.

1210
01:09:56,296 --> 01:09:57,765
Come on, Jess.

1211
01:09:58,298 --> 01:10:00,034
Your kids would just
get to know your dad

1212
01:10:00,134 --> 01:10:01,636
a different way, that's all.

1213
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:07,742
Here's to your dad.
To Paul.

1214
01:10:07,842 --> 01:10:08,910
Paul.

1215
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:14,782
Hey, sugar.
You want to dance?

1216
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:16,617
- No, thank you.
- C'mon!

1217
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:18,285
- Stop.
- C'mon!

1218
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:20,220
Get your hands off me.
Thanks.

1219
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,463
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

1220
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:32,499
- I'm good, how are you?
- Good.

1221
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:35,335
Uh, listen,

1222
01:10:35,435 --> 01:10:37,304
I've been thinking
about you a lot

1223
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:39,650
and I didn't get a chance
to tell you the other night

1224
01:10:39,674 --> 01:10:42,442
at your house,
before I passed out...

1225
01:10:44,178 --> 01:10:45,479
I really miss you.

1226
01:10:50,151 --> 01:10:51,652
Yeah, well, I really miss you.

1227
01:10:55,556 --> 01:10:56,924
I was thinking a lot about...

1228
01:10:57,024 --> 01:10:58,059
You know, about your dad

1229
01:10:58,159 --> 01:10:59,560
and what's going on, and, um...

1230
01:11:00,661 --> 01:11:02,262
You know, people with dementia

1231
01:11:02,362 --> 01:11:04,264
might not remember us, but...

1232
01:11:05,533 --> 01:11:07,400
we can always remember them.

1233
01:11:11,706 --> 01:11:13,241
I have something
in my car for you.

1234
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:14,842
I forgot.
I'll be right back.

1235
01:11:14,942 --> 01:11:16,010
All right.

1236
01:11:20,114 --> 01:11:21,414
Did you touch my butt?

1237
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,289
- Hey, you know that guy?
- No.

1238
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:31,491
No, he's drunk.

1239
01:11:31,592 --> 01:11:32,894
Well, he should apologize.

1240
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:35,062
No. Just forget it.
He's really drunk.

1241
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:37,532
Hey, man.

1242
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:38,876
Think you owe
this girl an apology.

1243
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:39,967
For what?

1244
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:42,103
For grabbin' her ass.

1245
01:11:42,203 --> 01:11:43,346
Yeah, whatever, man.
She loved it.

1246
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:44,906
Yeah, you wish.

1247
01:11:45,372 --> 01:11:48,109
Jesse, just let it go.
Let it go.

1248
01:11:48,676 --> 01:11:51,546
Look, I'm gonna give you
one last chance to apologize.

1249
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:53,214
What are you gonna do?

1250
01:11:53,313 --> 01:11:54,916
Guys, come on.

1251
01:11:59,554 --> 01:12:01,889
Get off! Why don't
you grab her again, huh?

1252
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,057
Calm down.

1253
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:04,258
I think you broke my nose.

1254
01:12:04,357 --> 01:12:05,560
You grabbed my butt!

1255
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,360
You're lucky
that's all he broke.

1256
01:12:17,605 --> 01:12:19,140
Got your sunglasses on?

1257
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,909
Yeah.
I got 'em right here.

1258
01:12:27,615 --> 01:12:28,916
Love you, too, Dad.

1259
01:12:37,692 --> 01:12:40,061
So, you're getting
into bar fights now, huh?

1260
01:12:40,161 --> 01:12:41,262
That wasn't my fault.

1261
01:12:41,629 --> 01:12:42,840
I don't care whose fault it was.

1262
01:12:42,864 --> 01:12:44,765
Come on.
You know better than that.

1263
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:46,901
You're right.

1264
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:49,369
Hey, Artie!

1265
01:12:49,469 --> 01:12:50,738
Yo!

1266
01:12:53,674 --> 01:12:55,219
Look, April's been
callin' you all night.

1267
01:12:55,243 --> 01:12:56,476
She couldn't get a hold of you

1268
01:12:56,577 --> 01:12:59,412
so she came by
and she brought this.

1269
01:12:59,513 --> 01:13:00,915
Let me know what you guys think.

1270
01:13:07,855 --> 01:13:09,323
You're here
more than anyone, bro.

1271
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:10,725
What do you think?

1272
01:13:11,893 --> 01:13:15,162
Uh, you know,
I think it's... it's mom's call.

1273
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:17,832
Agreed.

1274
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,034
Okay, I gotta go.

1275
01:13:20,134 --> 01:13:21,903
Uh, I'll see you guys later.

1276
01:13:22,003 --> 01:13:23,170
Hey, Art.

1277
01:13:23,537 --> 01:13:24,872
Nice job.

1278
01:13:37,852 --> 01:13:39,153
Hey, Mom, you got a minute?

1279
01:13:40,554 --> 01:13:42,523
Sure.
What's going on?

1280
01:13:45,393 --> 01:13:48,663
Have you ever thought about an
assisted care facility for Dad?

1281
01:13:51,832 --> 01:13:54,101
I've thought about it.
It's not an option.

1282
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,138
Why not?

1283
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,510
Because he's my husband.

1284
01:14:04,578 --> 01:14:06,948
I married him
for better or worse.

1285
01:14:08,983 --> 01:14:11,152
And he doesn't belong
anywhere but home.

1286
01:14:13,254 --> 01:14:15,323
Well, it looks like
I'm gonna have the freedom

1287
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,857
to be around a lot more.

1288
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,161
What do you mean?

1289
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:22,330
What about work?

1290
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:24,832
I spoke to Mr. Stewart.
And he can relate.

1291
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:26,734
Family first.

1292
01:14:26,834 --> 01:14:29,837
That's a blessing.

1293
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:34,008
We'll weather this together.

1294
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:50,257
Hey, Dad.

1295
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:52,093
Those are meerkats.

1296
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:53,860
Sure are.

1297
01:14:53,894 --> 01:14:56,897
These are meerkats.

1298
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:02,036
Dad.

1299
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:08,275
I love you, Dad.

1300
01:15:13,481 --> 01:15:14,849
That's all right.

1301
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:28,129
Mom.

1302
01:15:31,132 --> 01:15:32,366
This is your grandson,

1303
01:15:32,466 --> 01:15:33,934
William Edward.

1304
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:35,102
Oh.

1305
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:39,040
Oh...

1306
01:15:44,011 --> 01:15:46,113
Look what you did,
got something right.

1307
01:15:47,848 --> 01:15:48,949
Oh.

1308
01:15:57,425 --> 01:15:58,692
Paul.

1309
01:16:00,394 --> 01:16:03,030
This is your grandson, Will.

1310
01:16:03,931 --> 01:16:05,733
Do you want to... Do you want
to hold him?

1311
01:16:43,737 --> 01:16:45,739
<i>What do you think about that?</i>

1312
01:16:55,983 --> 01:16:57,651
<i>It's like an old hat, huh?</i>

1313
01:17:05,693 --> 01:17:07,161
<i>Dad!</i>

1314
01:17:07,261 --> 01:17:09,096
<i>What do you think
of your grandson, Will?</i>

1315
01:17:11,899 --> 01:17:13,501
<i>He's pretty sweet, isn't he?</i>

1316
01:17:13,602 --> 01:17:14,869
<i>Yeah.</i>
