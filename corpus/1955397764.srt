00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:08,039
Hello.

2
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,741
Merry christmas.

3
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:11,910
Merry christmas!

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:12,911
Merry christmas.

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:13,845
Oh, you too.

6
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,080
Hi!

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,081
Merry christmas!

8
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,717
Good morning!

9
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:21,420
Merry christmas.

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,954
Merry christmas.

11
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:23,889
Hi, stell!

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,390
Hey!

13
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:26,658
Hello.

14
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,093
Wow, that's quite a haul
you've got there.

15
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,061
Well, that time of year.

16
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:31,563
White flour, cinnamon,
molasses,

17
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,231
Brown sugar, gumdrops...

18
00:00:33,332 --> 00:00:34,966
You know, emily,

19
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:36,334
You can buy a kit
to make these things.

20
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,869
You don't have to make one
from scratch every year.

21
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,839
A pre-Fab gingerbread house?

22
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,873
Stell, please!

23
00:00:41,974 --> 00:00:43,275
My daughter would disown me.

24
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,743
Merry christmas.

25
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,345
Merry christmas.

26
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:51,450
Hi, mrs. Spengler!

27
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,417
Hi, guys!

28
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:54,286
Look!

29
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:58,356
Whoa!

30
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,091
You need a bigger hill.

31
00:01:59,585 --> 00:02:02,187
Got my christmas present
from aunt miriam today,

32
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,488
A crate of pineapples.

33
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:04,956
I got grapefruit.

34
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:07,092
Well, at least
she switched it up this year.

35
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,227
Why does that woman
do that?

36
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:10,729
She lives
in wisconsin.

37
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,430
Maybe she thinks
the cheese will melt.

38
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,765
Who knows?

39
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:19,905
So, you make
any sort of decision

40
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:20,906
About the company or what?

41
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,141
I don't know, charles.

42
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:24,075
It's a nice deal.

43
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:25,243
They upped their offer.

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,446
I think you should take it.

45
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,915
Uh, no offense,

46
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,749
But you're the last person
i'm coming to

47
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,383
For business advice.

48
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,652
That's probably wise.

49
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,920
How's the book?

50
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:35,820
Final rewrite.
I've missed two deadlines.

51
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:36,788
Publisher's not happy.

52
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:37,656
Writer's block?

53
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,590
Big time.

54
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,691
What's the problem?

55
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,293
I don't know,
it-It's finished,

56
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,527
It's just not right,

57
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:43,662
And i've got to fix it
over the break,

58
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,564
As soon as i finish
grading finals.

59
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,299
If i only knew what
was wrong with it.

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,233
Maybe you should
go away.

61
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,267
Where?

62
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:50,669
I don't know, somewhere quiet.

63
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,170
No distractions.

64
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,341
Yeah.

65
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,943
Yeah, that might be a good idea.

66
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,711
Yeah, get
a little work done,

67
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,580
Not have to
deal with christmas.

68
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,515
You shouldn't tell anybody
where you're going...

69
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:04,849
Especially your publisher.

70
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,685
You should go on
one of those house swap sites.

71
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,820
No, no, i'll just
get a hotel.

72
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,255
No, you can't write
in a hotel.

73
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:14,025
You pace too much.
You need room.

74
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:14,993
You're probably right.

75
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,194
I usually am.

76
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,430
Wait, what are you
going to do for christmas?

77
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,497
Same thing i'd do
if you were here.

78
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,465
Chinese food and the celtics.

79
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,267
And pineapples.

80
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,668
I hate pineapple.
Wanna trade?

81
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:24,603
No, i hate
pineapple.

82
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:28,506
I feel kind of bad leaving you.

83
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,441
Hey, you've got work to do.

84
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,742
So do i.

85
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:31,910
We're not a very
sentimental family, are we?

86
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:35,480
I've noticed that.

87
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,523
Yeah, santa gets there
after dessert,

88
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:49,728
And then he distributes
the keychains, that's right.

89
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,063
Oh, he will be sober this year.

90
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:54,099
No, i promise.

91
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,100
What dancing elves?

92
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,702
No, no, no.

93
00:03:57,803 --> 00:04:00,071
No, no, no, no. I've got
the invoice right here.

94
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:02,407
It doesn't say anything
about dancing elves.

95
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,209
Yeah, well, it's all listed.

96
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,644
I can resend it...

97
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:13,418
Hello?

98
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,887
No. I-I am so sorry.

99
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:18,023
No, it's not you,
it-It's my, uh...

100
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,692
My ex-Husband.

101
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,727
Okay, out of which orifice

102
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,096
Do you suggest i start pulling
dancing elves?

103
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:26,998
Hello?

104
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,406
Hey.

105
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,573
Hey.

106
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,441
Can you give this
to todd for me?

107
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,642
Thanks.

108
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:39,010
Whatcha doing?

109
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:40,612
Looking for a quiet
place to study.

110
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:41,613
What are you doing?

111
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,915
Just the opposite,
actually.

112
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,317
So, have you
told your mom yet?

113
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,987
Not yet.

114
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,622
Are you sure
you want to do this?

115
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:51,823
Yes.

116
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,957
Because you make it
seem like

117
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,159
She's gonna go
all operatic on you.

118
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,794
Christmas and everything.

119
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,262
Look, it's not
her fault.

120
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,963
The first couple christmases
without dad were tough,

121
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,498
I understand that,

122
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:02,333
But, jason, i've never,
not once, been away.

123
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,636
It's home or school.

124
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,804
Yeah.

125
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:06,938
I've never even had
a spring break

126
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,139
Because she's alone,
but this year,

127
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,174
I'm doin' it.

128
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:11,076
Sometimes, i swear

129
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,277
She still thinks
i'm in second grade.

130
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,079
She calls me, like,
five times a day.

131
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,914
I've seen you call her,
like, 10 times a day.

132
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:16,848
So...

133
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:17,916
That's different.

134
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:18,783
It's the same.

135
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:22,220
See?

136
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,722
Perfect timing.

137
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,724
I'll call her later.

138
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,624
Well, study up.

139
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:27,559
I'll catch you later.

140
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,493
All right.

141
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:29,427
Okay, bye.

142
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,102
Are you avoiding me?

143
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:37,969
<i>No, just busy.</i>

144
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,105
<i>Did you get my email?</i>

145
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,239
Yes.

146
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,907
And thank you,

147
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:43,808
But i'm not interested in
an "over 40s singles" event.

148
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:44,843
Oh, it sounds like fun.

149
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,578
Come on, just take a chance.

150
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,479
<i>Heather...</i>

151
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,681
I just don't feel...

152
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,883
"Single," okay?

153
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:55,520
Look, i know
it's tough, mom, but...

154
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,322
How long's it gonna take?

155
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,125
I wish i knew, honey.

156
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,559
So, did you book your flight?

157
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,261
<i>Mom, i'm totally
stressed out here,</i>

158
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,963
<i>And making a cross-Country
flight for a couple of days...</i>

159
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,965
It just doesn't make
any sense.

160
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,835
This is not just
any couple of days, honey,

161
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:11,936
It's christmas!

162
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:14,773
I know
it's christmas, but...

163
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,076
I know what this is about.

164
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,244
This is because
i didn't get you

165
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,113
That pony you wanted,
isn't it?

166
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,248
Mom...

167
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,849
You've got a million
friends out there.

168
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,251
Somebody will
invite you to dinner.

169
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,953
You know i bought everything
for the gingerbread house.

170
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,022
I'm 21, mom.

171
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,858
I got a new copy
of<i>it's a wonderful life</i>.

172
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,327
Look, i'm there
every break.

173
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:37,695
Just this one time,

174
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,197
Let me do something
on my own?

175
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,099
Let me have a life.

176
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,100
Please?

177
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,668
So...

178
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:47,472
What exactly will you be having
for christmas dinner, hmm?

179
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,941
A microwave burrito?

180
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,043
<i>I'm just going to
stay here and relax.</i>

181
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,111
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

182
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,879
<i>Okay.</i>

183
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,682
<i>You do what you feel
you</i> have<i> to do.</i>

184
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:58,883
It's just this one year, mom.

185
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,685
I get it.

186
00:07:00,786 --> 00:07:02,520
I'll talk to you later.

187
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:04,455
Good night.

188
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,830
Well, i told her.

189
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:14,299
Hey...

190
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,266
I told her.

191
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:16,234
Yeah?

192
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,202
How'd she take it?

193
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,939
With a large dose
of guilt.

194
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:24,409
Did you tell her
you were going with me?

195
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,944
Uh, not exactly.

196
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,346
You gotta stand up
for yourself, heather.

197
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,181
I know.

198
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,250
Hey, do me a favor?

199
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,586
Yes...

200
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:35,520
Leave this thing at home?

201
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,555
All right.

202
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,162
Hello?

203
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,797
I didn't wake you, did i?

204
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,498
<i>Hey! No, i'm still
at the office.</i>

205
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,568
You wouldn't happen to know
any dancing elves, would you?

206
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,502
<i>Afraid not.</i>

207
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:52,737
Hey, what's the matter?

208
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:55,573
Heather's not coming home
for christmas.

209
00:07:55,674 --> 00:07:57,408
<i>Oh, you scared me.</i>

210
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:58,543
<i>I thought it was
something serious.</i>

211
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,544
It is serious.

212
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,247
Emily, she is 21 years old.

213
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:03,915
<i>I'm aware of that.</i>

214
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,350
You sure? 'Cause sometimes,
i'm not so sure.

215
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,684
You weren't planning on

216
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:07,652
Making a gingerbread house
with her,

217
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,520
<i>Were you?</i>

218
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,557
I was... just surprised.

219
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,260
<i>Oh, honey, she's just
got her own life.</i>

220
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:17,395
Okay, that's exactly
what she said.

221
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,530
<i>You're not coaching
her, are you?</i>

222
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,399
You and i have had
this conversation before.

223
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,167
You know,
you're the one friend

224
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,536
That i thought would understand.

225
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,272
Can't you just...

226
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:28,873
At least fake
a little sympathy?

227
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:29,974
I'm sorry.

228
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,709
I'm just,

229
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,212
I am a little stressed out,
you know, with the holidays.

230
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,280
Ugh...

231
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,748
<i>I'll talk
to you later.</i>

232
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,682
Hey, are you okay?

233
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,816
Yeah.

234
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,418
I'm fine.

235
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,719
Good night.

236
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,621
<i>Good night.</i>

237
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,305
Yes...

238
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,233
"dear emily,

239
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,435
"Saw your ad.
House looks great.

240
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,337
The dates work out
perfectly for me."

241
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,945
"dear charles,

242
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:42,914
"Thanks for responding
so promptly.

243
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,582
"I think you'll find
the house itself

244
00:09:44,683 --> 00:09:46,150
"Very comfortable.

245
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:48,119
"There is a small studio
in the backyard

246
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,356
That might be very good
for a writing place.

247
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,957
"my condo
is centrally located,

248
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,258
"And since the students
will be on break,

249
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,127
"This end of town
should be quite peaceful,

250
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,831
Otherwise it can get
a little rowdy on the weekends."

251
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,833
"your references
have been glowing...

252
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,803
"Hope you have been able
to contact some of mine.

"I've been
a second grade teacher

"For almost 20 years,

255
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,575
So i'm really not in the habit
of throwing wild parties."

256
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,377
"i have
overnighted a key to you.

257

"I will email directions
on the burglar alarm.

259
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:17,782
Just punch in the code,
and you should be fine."

00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,184
"no burglar alarm

263
00:10:23,655 --> 00:10:25,123
Nobody in south woodbourne
locks the door."

"you don't lock the doors?

265
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,362
"Wow, i thought
that only happened in movies.

266
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:32,930
"Old movies.

00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,699
"Well, i'm glad
this worked out.

I hope your daughter
enjoys her surprise."

"Best of luck with your book."

273
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:04,662
Hi. This is faith kerrigan.

274
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,931
I need to book
a round-Trip ticket to seattle,

275
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,966
Coming home
the day after christmas.

276
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,868
Oh, and i need a rental car.

277
00:11:10,969 --> 00:11:13,137
No, no, i don't need a hotel.

278
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:16,107
I'm going to go surprise
an old friend.

279
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,577
Mom's calling.

280
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,245
We got a plane
to catch.

281
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:23,147
Now.

282
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,757
<i>hey, ray.</i>

283
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,759
<i>It's me,
the unsentimental brother.</i>

284
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,394
<i>Your cell phone's off again.</i>

285
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,362
<i>Look, i hope you get this.</i>

286
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,430
<i>I took your advice.</i>

287
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:40,631
<i>I'm at the airport now.</i>

288
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:41,566
<i>I'm getting
away from everything,</i>

289
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,134
<i>Especially christmas.</i>

290
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,536
<i>I'll call you in a few days.</i>

291
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,357
I'm in whoville.

292
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,725
Santa?

293
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,372
I should've done
more research.

294
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:03,848
Hmm...

295
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,085
Well...

296
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,520
We'll have to do something
about this.

297
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,412
Why did we even bother to fly?

298
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,047
We could've just taken
a stagecoach.

299
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,150
The pool's out back.

300
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,253
Come check it out.

301
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,823
Mom?

302
00:13:45,924 --> 00:13:47,558
<i>Surprise.
I'm here.</i>

303
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:48,593
What?

304
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:49,961
I'm here.

305
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,195
<i>Here where?</i>

306
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:52,163
Boston.

307
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,398
Boston?

308
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,434
Well, i-I'm not there!

309
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,435
Where are you?

310
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,637
W-Well...

311
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,105
I'm kind of in phoenix.

312
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,140
Phoenix!

313
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:06,043
Why are you in phoenix?

314
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,681
Can i help you?

315
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:12,116
I'm sarah. This is joey.

316
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:13,618
He doesn't talk to strangers.

317
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,453
That's a very good habit.

318
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:16,487
Maybe you should try it.

319
00:14:16,588 --> 00:14:18,055
Nice to meet you.

320
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:20,625
Mrs. Spengler told us
to keep an eye on you

321
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,393
In case you need anything.

322
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,794
Oh.

323
00:14:23,895 --> 00:14:26,597
Well, that's very nice,
but i'm fine, thank you,

324
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:27,999
And i'm busy.

325
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,101
Very busy, so...

326
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,269
Good talk.

327
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,009
Wanna build a snowman?

328
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,243
Not today, thanks.

329
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,045
Does that mean you might
want to tomorrow?

330
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,813
Probably not.

331
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:43,948
Probably never.

332
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,884
Thank you.

333
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:53,157
I don't want to...

334
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:54,692
Hello!

335
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,061
Emily asked me to look in
and see if you needed anything.

336
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:58,496
I brought some cookies.

337
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,364
Some...

338
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,366
Come on.

339
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:14,679
Oh, cookies.

340
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,613
- How nice.
- merry christmas.

341
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,814
Right, thank you.

342
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:18,883
Merry...

343
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,518
Christmas.

344
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,231
You do know
i flew across the country.

345
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,299
<i>You should have
told me.</i>

346
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:38,536
Then it wouldn't have been
a surprise.

347
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,471
<i>I hate surprises.</i>

348
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,740
Well, if you'd been
honest with me...

349
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:43,908
Okay, mom, i'm sorry.

350
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,311
I just, i didn't want
a ton of guilt.

351
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:49,146
Heather,
it's christmas!

352
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,815
And i wanted to do
something different.

353
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,018
Just this one year,
something on my own.

354
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:57,488
okay...

355
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,522
Can't you just
go home?

356
00:15:58,623 --> 00:15:59,890
What home?

357
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,192
I did a house-Swap thing

358
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,728
With a professor
named charles johnson.

359
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,062
Charles johnson,
i know him.

360
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,198
We just read his book
in american lit. Class.

361
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,667
Yes, well, i think
his interior decorator

362
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,403
Worked in a mental hospital,
or something,

363
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,704
But i'll cope.

364
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:15,873
Where are you
in phoenix anyway?

365
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,642
<i>Jason's grandparents
lent us their house.</i>

366
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,711
<i>It's very... nice.</i>

367
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,279
Jason.

368
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,382
That's the young man
you've been seeing, right?

369
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,284
<i>yes</i>.

370
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,185
Ah.

371
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:30,755
Okay.

372
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:31,956
Don't start.

373
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,758
<i>I'm not starting
anything.</i>

374
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:34,859
<i>I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

375
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,993
Bye.

376
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,628
<i>I'll talk to you
later, mom. Bye.</i>

377
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,932
Christmas...

378
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:50,708
Hello?

379
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,243
<i>Hello, sir.
Is this ray johnson?</i>

380
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,844
Yes.

381
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:56,280
<i>An alarm has been triggered
at 123 west cordova.</i>

382
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:57,982
<i>An officer
is on the way.</i>

383
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,450
Um... okay, uh.

384
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,285
I-I'll be there in five minutes.

385
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,205
Okay...Oh. Oh...

386
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,377
Uh... ms. Kerrigan,
i'm afraid there's a problem.

387
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:27,478
Your driver's license
expired in november.

388
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,047
What?
You're kidding?

389
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:31,582
Sorry. I'm afraid

390
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,184
We can't rent you a car
without a valid license.

391
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,685
Oh, come on,
can't you just, you know,

392
00:17:34,786 --> 00:17:35,820
Overlook
this little technicality?

393
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:36,754
I mean, i know how to drive.

394
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,123
I'm sure you do.

395
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,292
Okay, then, so can you just
let this one slide through?

396
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,660
I'm sorry.

397
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:43,527
No one will rent you a car
without a valid license.

398
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:45,329
Okay. Okay, look,

399
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,363
This is the problem.

400
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,331
I have to get to a town

401
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:49,333
That's 150 miles from here.

402
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:50,234
There's nothing
that i can do.

403
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,936
I'm sorry.

404
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:53,003
Can i help you

405
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:54,905
Over here, please?

406
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,074
Yes...

407
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,019
I-I understand,

408
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,587
I'm asking you
to make an exception.

409
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:44,922
Look, i will send you

410
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,123
A photocopy
of my driver's license

411
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:47,525
Once i renew it.
Please...

412
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,026
We're looking for a place
called big elk lake.

413
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,227
Do you have any maps?

414
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:51,262
Hey, guys.

415
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,097
I can tell you
how to get there.

416
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,098
Great.

417
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:55,132
As a matter of fact,

418
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,834
I was just on my way to a town

419
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:57,902
That's about
20 miles from there.

420
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,136
Tell you what,

421
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:00,638
How would you like
a free tank of gas?

422
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:06,844
Are you mr. Johnson?

423
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,879
Uh, yes. Yes, i am.

424
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,681
My, um,

425
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,483
My brother's out of town,
so they called me.

426
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,751
Up on the sixth floor.

427
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:23,961
Freeze!

428
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:28,032
An intruder was reported
at these premises.

429
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,634
Identify yourself.

430
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:31,869
No, no, no,
i'm not an intruder.

431
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,704
I'm a tenant.

432
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:34,672
I'll prove it.

433
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:44,348
We're "santa and friends'

434
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:45,182
Musical north pole
extravaganza."

435
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:46,317
Friends?

436
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,985
The other guy
got a commercial.

437
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,019
Oh, great.

438
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,853
We do 12 malls in three days.

439
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,255
Hey, do you dance?

440
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,656
Three years tap, two ballet.

441
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:53,924
I went to juilliard.

442
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:55,426
Okay, you know what,
you need to call me,

443
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,760
Because i may have
work for you next year.

444
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,530
Cool, thanks.

445
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,999
We're all set.

446
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,534
Okay, see?

447
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,635
Here are the emails.

448
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:08,038
And, uh,
these are the keys

449
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:09,940
That he sent me.

450
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,109
Well, i just, uh,

451
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,378
Spoke with my brother,
and he confirms everything.

452
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,247
Well, good night, then.

453
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,816
I'm sorry to have
startled you, mrs. Spengler.

454
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,050
No problem.

455
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:21,118
Just doing your job.

456
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,089
Good night.

457
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,394
I am very, very sorry.

458
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,528
Your own brother
didn't tell you?

459
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,130
No, i told him
not to tell anybody.

460
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,732
I didn't think
that included me.

461
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,901
Well, no harm done.

462
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,303
Well, that's
very understanding of you.

463
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,839
Most people wouldn't be...

464
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:48,412
Did you, uh...

465
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,580
Did you decorate?

466
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,914
Oh, yeah.

467
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,416
A couple of things.

468
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:53,684
I can leave them here
for your brother

469
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,119
If he wants.

470
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,186
Oh, no.

471
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:57,588
I don't think
that's a good idea.

472
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,392
Charles isn't especially into
christmas stuff.

473
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,527
Oh.

474
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,996
I didn't know that.

475
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:34,591
Again, i-I want to apologize.

476
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,061
Oh, please...

477
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,595
It was an adventure.

478
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:39,663
I have a story to tell

479
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:40,998
The folks back home.

480
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,767
It's good to see it that way,
i guess.

481
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,369
Um, can i ask you a question

482
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,570
Before you go?

483
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:47,504
Sure.

484
00:21:49,507 --> 00:21:51,175
Do you know how to
turn on the television?

485
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,610
Are you sure she won't mind
us using her bathroom?

486
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,112
Are you kidding?

487
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,346
Knowing emily she'll
send you home with cookies.

488
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,219
That's funny,
she never locks the door.

489
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:04,688
You know what,
don't worry about it.

490
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:05,656
There's a key around back.

491
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,524
I will be right back.

492
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,170
What is it with this place?

493
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:22,406
Emily!

494
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,674
Hey!

495
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,476
who are you?

496
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,977
Where is emily?

497
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:28,846
emily...
d-Daughter...Boston...

498
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:29,780
Emily's in daughter
with her boston...

499
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:31,915
Hey, leave her alone!

500
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:32,783
I can break
this door down!

501
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,018
I'm fine, i'm fine!

502
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
Now i got a violent elf.

503
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,121
That's good...

504
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,689
What are you doing here?

505
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,991
What am i... What are...
I-I'm supposed to be here!

506
00:22:41,092 --> 00:22:42,059
I'm supposed to be here.

507
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,427
Emily's in mine,
and i'm in hers.

508
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,228
That didn't come out right.

509
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,162
A house swap...

510
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,463
We're doing a house swap!

511
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:48,799
Okay.

512
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,469
gosh...

513
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,971
Who are you?
Wait, don't let those...

514
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,606
Hey, you okay, faith?

515
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,007
He giving you trouble?

516
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:58,208
Back off, elf!

517
00:22:58,309 --> 00:22:59,143
Back off...

518
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,477
Everybody settle down!

519
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:01,879
I can explain everything.

520
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,013
If you guys are going to
rob the place,

521
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:05,115
Could you start with
the decorations?

522
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,049
It's around the corner

523
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,251
To your right.

524
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,820
Come on, chop chop.

525
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,424
Where are santa
and the elf going?

526
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,459
Who are you?
What is going on here?

527
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,727
They need to use the bathroom,

528
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:17,761
And then i am going to make them

529
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:19,263
A cup of coffee
for the road,

530
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:20,564
And you don't
have to worry,

531
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,933
Because i know
where everything is.

532
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,968
i'm sorry.

533
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:26,069
I am faith kerrigan.

534
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,706
Charles... johnson.

535
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,643
Nutcracker...

536
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,077
Okay, charles.

537
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:35,045
So, what do you like to go by,

538
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:36,446
Chuck? Charlie?

539
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,549
Charles.

540
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,850
Hmm, one of those.

541
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,652
Okay, i won't be a minute.

542
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,653
Do you want
a cup of coffee?

543
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,189
No... What? No!

544
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:52,896
So you came
across the country,

545
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:54,331
And she's in phoenix?

546
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,299
Yeah.

547
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,867
I wanted to surprise her.

548
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,102
Didn't quite
work out, though.

549
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,940
Okay, i wrote
it all down.

550
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,775
This is the tv.

551
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:05,876
You press
these two buttons.

552
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,878
This is the dvd,

553
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,581
And this is the stereo.

554
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,249
Maybe i'll just read.

555
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,052
And this
is the fireplace.

556
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,987
Whoa.

557
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:19,690
We do things
the old-Fashioned way

558
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,691
Back home.

559
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,059
We use matches.

560
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,061
I won't be
needing this.

561
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,062
Oh, okay.

562
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,496
Do you need anything else?

563
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,498
No, that's it.
Thanks.

564
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,800
Okay, well,
i left my card,

565
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,201
In case you have
any questions

566
00:24:31,302 --> 00:24:32,636
Or need anything.

567
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:33,670
"Tech-Sec."

568
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:35,439
What's that?

569
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,007
That's my company.

570
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,542
Software protection
and security.

571
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,510
Mm. Sounds mysterious.

572
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,815
Actually, it's, uh,
very technical

573
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:45,983
And a little dull.

574
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,284
Well, at least
it sounds exciting.

575
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,652
That's something.

576
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:55,893
Do...

577
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,362
Do you, uh, know anyone here?

578
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:00,330
Oh. No.

579
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:02,099
Just...

580
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,333
Adrift.

581
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:07,337
Well, uh,

582
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:09,940
Tell you what...

583
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,074
Would you...

584
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,277
Why don't..?

585
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,646
Why don't you let me

586
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,980
Take you out for dinner
tomorrow night?

587
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:18,782
Dinner?

588
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,817
Yeah. Yeah, and i could write
down some places for you to go,

589
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:21,985
Local tourist stuff?

590
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:23,553
Unless you have plans...

591
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:24,922
No, no.

592
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,090
No plans.

593
00:25:27,191 --> 00:25:28,425
Dinner then.

594
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,194
Dinner then.

595
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,329
7:00?

596
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,297
7:00.

597
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,331
See you then.

598
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,900
Sure.

599
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:41,872
dinner...

600
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:49,646
Let me get this
straight,

601
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:50,847
You just
hopped on a plane,

602
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:51,949
Drove out here
to the middle of nowhere,

603
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,650
To surprise your friend?

604
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:55,419
Yes...

605
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,286
Well, surprise.

606
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,488
She's not here.

607
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:03,193
Ah! Ah!

608
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:04,628
Ooh, you okay?

609
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:06,830
Yeah, i'm fine.

610
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:07,898
Oh, she made you cookies.

611
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,801
Yeah, everyone in this
burg made me cookies.

612
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,336
Do you mind?
I am starving.

613
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,872
No, go right ahead,
please help yourself.

614
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,574
She makes
<i>the</i> best cookies.

615
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:18,608
Well, good for her.

616
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,744
So...

617
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:21,945
What are we going to do
about this?

618
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:23,580
I think
you should try a cookie.

619
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:24,548
No, i...

620
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:25,449
No, thank you.

621
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,783
I-I'm fine.

622
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:29,453
So, what...
what are your plans? Are you...

623
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:30,354
Tea's in the tin.

624
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,455
Above the stove.

625
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:34,658
I could take you to a hotel.

626
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,060
There is no hotel
in south woodbourne.

627
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:38,462
What about
north woodbourne?

628
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,664
There is no
north woodbourne.

629
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,698
Then why do they call this
south woodbourne?

630
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,033
Listen,

631
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,534
Just let me crash
in heather's room tonight.

632
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:45,969
I will take a bus
back to seattle tomorrow.

633
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,571
Cups are on the right.

634
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,639
No, my right,
my right.

635
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:50,974
In the cupboard.

636
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:53,377
So you're saying... stay here?

637
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,745
Yeah, just till tomorrow.

638
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,279
okay...

639
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,348
Yeah, here's the thing.

640
00:26:58,449 --> 00:26:59,349
I'm a writer.

641
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,584
Oh.

642
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,651
And i'm here
to write, okay?

643
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,553
So i'm on
a very strict deadline,

644
00:27:03,654 --> 00:27:04,855
And i need to work.

645
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,156
Mm.

646
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,057
What do you write?

647
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,258
Well, it's...

648
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,060
It-It's not...

649
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,963
I'm rewriting my novel,

650
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,966
If you must know,
miss nosey-Parker, so what i'm...

651
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,634
- Anything i've heard of?
- Probably not.

652
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:19,736
I'm trying to tell you
i cannot have any distractions.

653
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:20,570
What distractions?

654
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:21,938
I'm going to bed,

655
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,306
And then i'm going to
get up in the morning,

656
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,608
Come downstairs,
have a cup of coffee...

657
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:26,610
Your water's boiling,
by the way...

658
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,111
And get on a bus.

659
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:38,188
I just don't think
it's a very good idea.

660
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,158
So...

661
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,092
Are you afraid of me?

662
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,627
No, i'm not...

663
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,694
Because you know
you<i> can</i> lock your door.

664
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:45,829
That's not
what i'm worried about.

665
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,330
Then what are you
worried about?

666
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,298
I'm not... Who said
i was worried about anything?

667
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,633
You just did just now.

668
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,802
No, i... Fine.

669
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,370
Look, i am not
gonna murder you

670
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:54,438
In the middle
of the night

671
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,439
And steal
your cookies, okay?

672
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,406
I didn't think
that you were.

673
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:57,207
Then what is
the problem?

674
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,208
There is no problem!

675
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,343
Good.
Then i'm staying.

676
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:05,949
Seriously, these cookies
are so delicious.

677
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:12,689
One night?

678
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,690
One night.

679
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:14,658
Then the first bus.

680
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:15,592
First bus.

681
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,260
Fine.

682
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:19,529
Close the drapes
and turn out the lights.

683
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,464
Night-Night.

684
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,499
Nighty...

685
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,907
He doesn't deserve
these cookies.

686
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:33,710
You're kidding me?

687
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,745
Oh... i don't believe this.

688
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:37,114
<i>I wanted to
surprise you.</i>

689
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:40,650
Okay, new year's resolution
right now...

690
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:42,519
No more surprises.

691
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,588
They're just not
working out for us this year.

692
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,655
Yeah, tell me
about it.

693
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:48,125
This charles guy
is a total jerk.

694
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,261
Yeah, well, his brother
seems very nice.

695
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,496
You met him?

696
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:53,897
Yup.

697
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,532
In fact,

698
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,634
He's taking me
to dinner tonight.

699
00:28:57,735 --> 00:28:59,136
Dinner?

700
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,604
What, like, a date?

701
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:01,905
Like a real date?

702
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,106
I don't know about that.

703
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:04,074
I think
he just feels guilty

704
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:05,342
For almost
having me arrested.

705
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,244
What?

706
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,845
Long story.

707
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:10,914
Listen, i have to go.

708
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,249
hemingway approaches.

709
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,754
Hey.

710
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:19,422
Hey.

711
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:24,194
Oh.

712
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,963
I'll give you a ride.

713
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,265
No, really, it's fine.
I know the way.

714
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,233
I can spare
five minutes.

715
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:34,204
Do you need a hand?

716
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,105
I-I can help.

717
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,439
No, i'm fine.

718
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,618
I think i figured it out.

719
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,487
What bothers me
about the house,

720
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,989
Besides, like,
the skulls on the wall.

721
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,391
Yeah, what's that?

722
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,027
Well, there's
no christmas tree.

723
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,495
We have to have
a christmas tree!

724
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,130
why is that?

725
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,566
Well, because it's
christmas, that's why.

726
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,201
Yeah, but
we're in the desert.

727
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,702
I mean, i guess we could

728
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:07,871
Decorate a cactus
or something.

729
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,841
Aw... please?

730
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,176
all right,

731
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:14,578
I'll get you
a little one.

732
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,953
Okay, so i'll, uh,

733
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,154
I'll just leave it
right by the door here.

734
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,121
Okay, great.
Thanks.

735
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,489
Right.

736
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:29,326
Okay. Good.
Have a nice trip.

737
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:30,961
You too.

738
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:34,764
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me!

739
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:37,767
Charles!

740
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,608
What's up?

741
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:45,842
There's only
one bus a week to seattle.

742
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:47,143
Is that right?

743
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,411
And is that today?

744
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:50,046
No, not until
thursday.

745
00:30:50,147 --> 00:30:51,915
Christmas.

746
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:52,882
Oh.

747
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:53,950
That...

748
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:54,985
That would...

749
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:55,919
That's tough.

750
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,120
Tough break,
tough break.

751
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,355
What are you going to do?

752
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,756
Let's go back to emily's
and discuss it.

753
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,291
What?

754
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,592
Discuss...

755
00:31:02,693 --> 00:31:03,994
Emily's?

756
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:06,263
Charles, can you
open this, please?

757
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,799
Are you sure?

758
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,668
Okay, uh-Huh.

759
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,170
All right, thank you.

760
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,772
Well?

761
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:19,242
All four inns within 50 miles
are booked for the holidays.

762
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:20,243
I don't believe this.

763
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:22,345
Hey, i know!

764
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:23,980
Lookit, you drive me
to seattle

765
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:25,248
And i will pay you for the gas.

766
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:27,751
300-Mile round trip,
let me think about that.

767
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,486
No thanks, i have to work!

768
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:30,920
What do you suggest i do?

769
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,389
Mm, hitchhike?

770
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,690
Oh, come on,
this is just until christmas.

771
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,392
Which is an eternity...

772
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,861
That's it,
i'm buying a gun.

773
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,095
No, you know what,
i am gonna take care of this.

774
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:40,363
Those kids are trouble.

775
00:31:40,464 --> 00:31:41,531
Those kids are...

776
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:42,532
Hey, guys!

777
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:43,633
I'm sarah.

778
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:44,868
This is joey.

779
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,569
He doesn't talk to strangers.

780
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:47,837
okay...

781
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:49,039
Nice to meet you,
sarah and joey.

782
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,273
I'm faith.

783
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:51,675
Wanna build
a snowman?

784
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:52,676
You know what,

785
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:53,643
That sounds like
a ton of fun.

786
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:54,678
I would love to.

787
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,112
Is the grouchy man inside?

788
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:57,447
Does he want to help?

789
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,717
One second,
i'll be right back, okay?

790
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,423
Okay, so they're not
going to bother you again today

791
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:07,691
Because i promised to help
with a snowman.

792
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:08,692
Good.

793
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,093
And sarah mentioned

794
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:10,894
You were kind of
grouchy yesterday.

795
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:11,961
I wasn't grouchy.

796
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,229
I think you probably were.

797
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,864
I think i probably wasn't.

798
00:32:14,965 --> 00:32:16,232
I think you were.
Anyway, look,

799
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,867
I'm going to run interference
with the neighbors.

800
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:19,736
No one will interrupt you,
including myself.

801
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:20,603
You will not even know

802
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,871
That i'm here.

803
00:32:21,972 --> 00:32:23,039
So, go.

804
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,973
Write.

805
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,308
You go.

806
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:26,242
- No, you go.
- No, you go.

807
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,210
I am gonna go.

808
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,311
So am i.

809
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:29,546
- Fine.
- Fine.

810
00:33:12,022 --> 00:33:15,392
Laying tomorrow night!

811
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,860
What's that?

812
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,095
You've never seen
<i>it's a wonderful life</i>?

813
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:20,196
With jimmy stewart
and the angel, and...

814
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:21,698
No.

815
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,932
It's a great movie.

816
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:24,167
Mom and i watch it
every year.

817
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,735
Yeah, but mom is not here.

818
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:26,970
Remember?

819
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,471
Oops.

820
00:33:28,572 --> 00:33:29,973
Old habits.

821
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,441
Hey.

822
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,444
I'm glad we did this.

823
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,279
Yeah, me too.

824
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,551
Whoo!

825
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,420
Hey, jase! Hey, heather!

826
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,355
I thought you guys
were in las vegas. Hey.

827
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,024
Yeah, we got asked to leave.

828
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,125
You got asked
to leave<i> las vegas</i>?

829
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:50,293
Long story.

830
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:51,661
So phoenix is, like,
two hours away.

831
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:52,896
We thought
we'd surprise you guys.

832
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,164
Right.

833
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,698
Uh, how did you find us?

834
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,666
It's your grandparents'
place, dude.

835
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:57,700
The same last name.

836
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,803
We looked it up in phone book.

837
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,538
Come here.
Come here.

838
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,407
dude, i don't know
if this is such a good idea.

839
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:05,842
I sort of promised heather

840
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,377
That we would hang out
together over...

841
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,278
Dude, dude...

842
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,146
Look what i brought.

843
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,951
Come on.

844
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,123
It's only for
a couple days, right?

845
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,825
You spent how much?

846
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,593
<i>It was a christmas
present to myself.</i>

847
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,962
Yeah, but you're not even sure
if this is an actual date.

848
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,464
I know.

849
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,866
But i just looked at
the women around here,

850
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:30,800
And i felt...

851
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:32,168
Frumpy.

852
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:33,570
<i>Oh, yeah, and
how do you look now?</i>

853
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,572
I look kind of...

854
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:36,940
Different.

855
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,875
Good different
or bad different?

856
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,043
Good different.

857
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,211
<i>Good.</i>

858
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,645
oh, he's here.

859
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:43,279
<i>Gotta go.</i>

860
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,714
Okay, have fun.

861
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:22,919
- Hi...
- Hi.

862
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,887
You look great.

863
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,154
Oh...

864
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,122
Thank you.

865
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:27,524
You ready?

866
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,491
Sure.

867
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:29,792
Okay.

868
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:44,641
I thought you said

869
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:45,708
You weren't
going to interrupt...

870
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,444
...Me.

871
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,459
You know, this is
the first time

872
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,661
In my entire life

873
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,063
I'm not spending christmas
in south woodbourne.

874
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:08,364
Every christmas?

875
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:09,332
Yeah, every one.

876
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:10,867
I was raised there.

877
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,969
Went to college nearby.

878
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,537
Married frank.

879
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:16,439
I teach in
the same classroom

880
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,575
Where i was a student
in second grade.

881
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,310
Well, what's it like
being someplace else?

882
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:21,945
A little... weird.

883
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,049
My last christmas,
i was in...

884
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,116
Messina.

885
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:28,318
sicily?

886
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,285
Mm-Hmm.

887
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,389
The piazza del duomo
with the fountain,

888
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:34,991
And the san ranieri lighthouse,

889
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:35,959
Did you see that?

890
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,594
Afraid not.

891
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,595
When were you there?

892
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,163
Oh, i've
never been there.

893
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:42,498
I mean...

894
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,767
I like to read about places.

895
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:47,537
See, frank and i...

896
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,739
Down the road when we retired...

897
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,441
Talked about, you know,

898
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,977
Visiting all the places that
i had only seen pictures of,

899
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,180
And we had it all planned, too.

900
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,082
And then...

901
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:00,283
You know, frank...

902
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:03,753
One phone call...

903
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,890
Your entire life...

904
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:12,462
All those plans...

905
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,730
Things change.

906
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,166
Last few christmases
must have been tough.

907
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:23,106
Yes.

908
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,173
They were.

909
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:26,943
So...

910
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:30,480
How did you spend
christmas growing up?

911
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,648
Well, um, actually,

912
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,484
Christmas wasn't a big deal
for us.

913
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,552
We moved around a lot...

914
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,221
A lot...

915
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,690
And sometimes, we didn't even
have a christmas tree.

916
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:42,992
What? You're kidding.

917
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:44,560
No.

918
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:45,862
That's terrible.

919
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:46,929
We got over it.

920
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,931
Wow, i don't know,

921
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,334
I have trouble
even picturing christmas

922
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,102
Without the whole thing.

923
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:56,572
I mean, stockings,

924
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,107
The tree.

925
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,843
Cookies laid out for santa,

926
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:03,646
Although frank used to say,
"santa would prefer a beer."

927
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,151
But i mean, no tree?

928
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,454
I mean, for little kids,
that's pretty...

929
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:18,828
It's none of my business.

930
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,663
I'm just a traditionalist,

931
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:21,964
I guess.

932
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,132
That's not a problem.

933
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,935
Sorry.

934
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:27,003
It's heather.

935
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,606
I'll call her back.

936
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,311
She's not answering.

937
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:36,813
I don't know,
maybe she's busy.

938
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,381
Come on, jase,
busy doing what?

939
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:41,884
Here's to charles.

940
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:42,919
Mm!

941
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,001
Hey.

942
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,369
There's another plate
of cookies

943
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,270
And fruitcake
on the table for you.

944
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:03,439
That's terrible.

945
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,841
I didn't hear anybody come by.

946
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,609
I intercepted them
on the lawn.

947
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,377
Ah-Hah, well,
thank you for that.

948
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,979
And thank you for the snack,
but you didn't have to do that.

949
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,048
Ah, i gotta earn my keep.

950
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,583
Just be the doorman,
that's all i ask.

951
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,418
Hey, listen, do you happen
to know of a restaurant in town

952
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,986
Where i wouldn't be besieged
by happy people

953
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:18,087
Wishing me "merry christmas?"

954
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:19,722
Do you have
a problem with that?

955
00:39:19,823 --> 00:39:21,023
Yeah, kind of.

956
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,125
Total strangers
waving at me on the street.

957
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,559
"Merry christmas!"
It's not normal.

958
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,527
Look, you don't have to
go for dinner.

959
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:25,261
I made a chicken.

960
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,031
A chicken?

961
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,234
Oh, now, look,
i wouldn't want to...

962
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,168
I wouldn't want to
burden you...

963
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,369
A whole chicken.

964
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,403
Oh.

965
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,505
It's probably
a little bit dry.

966
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,106
I am a terrible cook.

967
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:38,541
But i also made salad.

968
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,043
That way, you can, you know,
work and eat if you want.

969
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,512
Well, i...

970
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,283
Is that your aftershave?

971
00:39:48,685 --> 00:39:49,552
Yes.

972
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:50,953
Hmm.

973
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:51,988
It's not bad.

974
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,295
Whenever i have a serious
decision to make,

975
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:02,098
I make a list
of the pros and the cons.

976
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,466
Selling your business

977
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,369
Sounds like a pretty full
"pro" column to me.

978
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,970
No cons.

979
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:09,472
I wish it were
that simple.

980
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,108
What's complicating it?

981
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,209
You'll consult.

982
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,977
The rest of
the time is yours.

983
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:16,045
Well, that's
what i'm scared of.

984
00:40:16,146 --> 00:40:17,947
What will i do
with that time?

985
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,316
What would you
want to do?

986
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,552
You know what,

987
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:23,719
I never really
thought about it.

988
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:25,621
You should try.

989
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:26,689
Go back to some of
those places

990
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,291
You've already been to,

991
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,259
And see something besides
the corporate center,

992
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,494
Or the gym.

993
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,362
That's easy
for you to say.

994
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:36,399
Emily, you have
summers off.

995
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,633
You read these books
about places.

996
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:39,669
You should hop on a plane
and see them.

997
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,170
I don't know...

998
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:42,572
What's stopping you?

999
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,774
There's heather.

1000
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,876
She's 21.

1001
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,078
And, well...

1002
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,749
Okay, maybe i'm scared.

1003
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,185
Scared of what?

1004
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,922
I'm not sure.

1005
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:01,824
You know what i think?

1006
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:04,060
I think you should
go have some fun.

1007
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,729
Take a chance,
go on an adventure.

1008
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,531
Hah! This from a man

1009
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,399
Who was in india
four times

1010
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,502
Before he left his hotel
and saw the taj mahal.

1011
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,972
Ah, you know what,
i'm going to go back,

1012
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,907
I'm going to
play the tourist.

1013
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,041
You know,
there's no rush.

1014
00:41:19,142 --> 00:41:21,277
There's plenty
of time for it.

1015
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,516
That's what frank
used to say.

1016
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:28,451
Ah, look.

1017
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,286
Isn't that pretty?

1018
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,822
Yes, you are.

1019
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,702
Charles...

1020
00:41:46,803 --> 00:41:48,738
Mm?

1021
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,907
Would you mind
a little suggestion?

1022
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:54,644
About what?

1023
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:55,778
Well, i hope
you don't mind,

1024
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:58,614
But i read
your first few chapters.

1025
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:00,650
What?

1026
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,351
They were just laying out.

1027
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:03,686
you... they... they were just...

1028
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,354
"They were just laying out"?

1029
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:06,656
If i left
my wallet out,

1030
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,591
Would you- Would you
rifle through that, too?

1031
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,959
Well, i didn't think
it was top secret.

1032
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,594
It's a work-In-Progress.

1033
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,562
Which is why i have
some thoughts that may help.

1034
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:14,864
Okay?

1035
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:17,133
What are you...

1036
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:18,734
Ha, ha, ha! Ho!

1037
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:20,336
I didn't want to ruin
your pages.

1038
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,104
Unbelievable.

1039
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:23,673
I really like the story.

1040
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:24,974
Oh, thank you.

1041
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,442
I do, i'm totally
caught up.

1042
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:27,410
It's just...

1043
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,845
Just what?

1044
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:30,813
Samantha.

1045
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:32,381
The girlfriend.

1046
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:33,382
What about samantha
the girlfriend?

1047
00:42:33,483 --> 00:42:35,418
She is a total witch.

1048
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,485
Please feel free
to respell that if you want.

1049
00:42:36,586 --> 00:42:37,520
Bi...

1050
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:39,021
She's the antagonist!

1051
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:40,389
Yeah, but she's evil.

1052
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,390
I keep expecting her
to kick a puppy

1053
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:42,525
Or foreclose
on an orphanage.

1054
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,960
Unbelievable...

1055
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:44,994
You know, and-
And if edward is in love

1056
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,195
With a woman like that,

1057
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:47,296
It just makes him
look like an idiot.

1058
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:48,931
Well, maybe
that's what i want!

1059
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:50,299
A witch
and an idiot?

1060
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,767
Okay, you know what,
who are you?

1061
00:42:51,868 --> 00:42:53,069
Do you have a job?
How do you make a living?

1062
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,737
Yes, i do.
I'm in corporate event planning,

1063
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:55,771
Mm-Hmm, mm-Hmm.

1064
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:57,206
It's very fulfilling.

1065
00:42:57,307 --> 00:42:58,140
I want to be challenged.
I am looking for a change...

1066
00:42:58,241 --> 00:42:59,542
Yeah, don't care.
Know why?

1067
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,443
You're not a writer...
I'm a writer!

1068
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:01,544
Yes, but i am a reader,

1069
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,979
And if i bought this book

1070
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,280
I would have thrown it out
after the third chapter

1071
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:06,282
Because, clearly,
the author

1072
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,350
Does not understand women...

1073
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,417
Well, who does?

1074
00:43:08,518 --> 00:43:09,418
Oh, excuse me?

1075
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:10,786
Okay, you know what,

1076
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:12,755
That is exactly the attitude
that all men have...

1077
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:13,723
"All men!"

1078
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:14,590
O-Kay, "all men".

1079
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:16,025
Great.

1080
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,059
Now i know
what i'm dealing with, okay.

1081
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,127
Excuse me?

1082
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,495
- You heard me.
- Excuse me?

1083
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:20,863
I'd love to see
your notes on some shakespeare.

1084
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:23,199
Yeah, macbeth,
"oh, yeah, william,

1085
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,734
"The wife's
a bit nasty, isn't she?

1086
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,936
Could she please not suggest
any more murders?"

1087
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,571
Oh, that is so ridiculous.

1088
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,872
You know that is
not what i meant.

1089
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:32,808
Samantha is exactly the way
i want her, okay?

1090
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:33,776
And your prejudiced,
gender-Specific

1091
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:34,710
Female views aside,

1092
00:43:34,811 --> 00:43:36,379
Let me inform you

1093
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,847
That she happens to be based on
someone that i know.

1094
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,215
No.

1095
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,416
No, she's based on
someone you hate.

1096
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:41,283
Oh!

1097
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:42,385
Big difference.

1098
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:43,719
Yeah, okay, you know what,

1099
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,321
I am under a very serious,
<i>very</i>serious,

1100
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:46,288
Gun-At-My-Head deadline here,

1101
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,390
And the last thing i need

1102
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,657
Are some thoughts
and notes

1103
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,092
From some non-Writing,
man-Loathing,

1104
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:51,327
Corporate event party planner!

1105
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:55,031
Thank you for dinner!

1106
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,432
You're welcome!

1107
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:32,802
Um, i have a question for you.

1108
00:44:32,903 --> 00:44:33,769
Sure.

1109
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:34,737
Dinner tonight...

1110
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,206
Did you ask me out

1111
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,475
Because you felt guilty
about almost having me arrested?

1112
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:43,446
Well, uh, yeah.

1113
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:47,383
Honest man.

1114
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,352
I thought if i was nice,
you wouldn't sue me or anything.

1115
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,388
Well, you can relax.

1116
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:53,489
I'm not going to sue you.

1117
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,257
It was nice
meeting you.

1118
00:44:55,358 --> 00:44:56,525
I had a lovely evening.

1119
00:44:56,626 --> 00:44:57,526
Thanks.

1120
00:44:57,627 --> 00:44:59,495
You're quite welcome.

1121
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,498
Bye.

1122
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,685
Now that we got
the lawsuit out of the way,

1123
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,687
Are you busy tomorrow?

1124
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,924
Well, i'm glad
it was a real date

1125
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:29,892
After all the money you spent.

1126
00:45:31,094 --> 00:45:31,961
At first,
i was scared to death,

1127
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,762
But then...

1128
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:34,964
I don't know, i just...

1129
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,932
He was just easy to talk to.

1130
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:39,135
<i>He's pleasant,</i>

1131
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,136
<i>Intelligent...</i>

1132
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,006
Very good-Looking.

1133
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:45,574
How's the brother?

1134
00:45:45,675 --> 00:45:47,543
Opposite in every way.

1135
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:48,644
Well, i mean,
except for the looks.

1136
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,446
You know, he's not bad
to look at.

1137
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:52,648
Plus, he smells good.

1138
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:55,117
What, you were
sniffing him?

1139
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:56,385
So are you going to
go out again?

1140
00:45:56,486 --> 00:45:59,221
Yup. Tomorrow.

1141
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:01,023
I'm not sure what
we're doing yet, but...

1142
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:02,992
Emily...

1143
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,193
Can you believe,

1144
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,794
He didn't even have
a christmas tree

1145
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,863
When he was younger.

1146
00:46:07,964 --> 00:46:09,331
Emily, i...

1147
00:46:09,432 --> 00:46:11,500
And you know, i know it was
just one dinner, but...

1148
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:14,904
I just felt so...
comfortable with him.

1149
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:15,738
Good. Emily...

1150
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:16,805
I know, i know,

1151
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,673
I'm running on
at the mouth.

1152
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,542
No, it's not that.

1153
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:23,179
Can i give you
a piece of advice?

1154
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,613
What?

1155
00:46:24,714 --> 00:46:25,614
Listen,
i am really glad

1156
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:27,116
That you're having
a good time,

1157
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:29,351
I just want you to
protect yourself,

1158
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:32,087
Because you're not going
to be there very long.

1159
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,189
You're coming home soon.

1160
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,123
You know,
don't forget that.

1161
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:35,191
I won't.

1162
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,859
Good.

1163
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,860
Bye.

1164
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:38,928
Bye.

1165
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,162
<i>So, what do you
know about her?</i>

1166
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,763
Her references were good.

1167
00:47:14,864 --> 00:47:15,864
No criminal record

1168
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:16,932
If that's what
you're wondering.

1169
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:18,200
<i>What's her place like?</i>

1170
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:19,635
Like a hallmark store
without the cards.

1171
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:20,603
What do you care?

1172
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:21,570
I'm just curious.

1173
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:22,638
No, something's
going on.

1174
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:23,572
You sound weird.
What's going on?

1175
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:24,640
Nothing is going on.

1176
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:25,841
It's just, uh,

1177
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:28,077
We had dinner,
and she's nice.

1178
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,578
Everyone in this
town is nice.

1179
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:30,946
There must be
something in the water.

1180
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:32,781
She's different,
i guess, uh...

1181
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:34,283
Most of the women i meet,

1182
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,552
They're mbas with a dagger
between their teeth.

1183
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:37,753
That sounds like
her friend.

1184
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:38,754
How's that going?

1185
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,122
On the plus side,

1186
00:47:40,223 --> 00:47:41,090
She's good at
running interference.

1187
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,024
And on the down side?

1188
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,392
Everything else.

1189
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:44,326
Is she attractive?

1190
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:45,661
She's obnoxious.

1191
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,096
Pushiest woman
i ever met...

1192
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,430
Has an opinion
on absolutely everything...

1193
00:47:48,531 --> 00:47:49,598
In an obnoxious, pushy,
opinionated sort of way,

1194
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:52,034
She's... okay, i guess.

1195
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:54,770
Now you're the one
who's sounding weird.

1196
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,005
I don't sound weird.
You sound weird.

1197
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,006
Gotta go.

1198
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:57,973
What? Ray!

1199
00:47:58,074 --> 00:47:58,974
Hey.

1200
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:01,277
Hello.

1201
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,678
I hope you're wearing
comfortable shoes.

1202
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:05,080
So, what do you
want to see first?

1203
00:48:05,181 --> 00:48:06,982
Everything.

1204
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:09,551
All right.

1205
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,855
 if i was
a snowflake falling 

1206
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,658
 i would follow you

1207
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,260
 the world so loud
a big great cloud 

1208
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:22,164
 but we would drift
right through 

1209
00:48:22,265 --> 00:48:25,100
 i would settle
on your shoulder 

1210
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:27,936
 to see how it felt

1211
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:31,006
 listen to you
singing softly 

1212
00:48:31,107 --> 00:48:34,343
 till i'd finally melt

1213
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:39,114
 come on
and string the lights up 

1214
00:48:39,215 --> 00:48:40,883
 come on outside

1215
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:44,820
 let's go and sing
our promise 

1216
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,789
 raise our voices up

1217
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,057
See, now, boston is

1218
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:50,492
One of the finest dining
cities in the country.

1219
00:48:50,593 --> 00:48:52,695
I felt like a hot dog.

1220
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,263
Well, we could
go someplace warm

1221
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,331
And eat it if you want.

1222
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,231
No, no, i'm fine.

1223
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,399
I love it out here.

1224
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,500
I hope this
touristy thing

1225
00:48:58,601 --> 00:48:59,568
Isn't boring you.

1226
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:00,736
No, no, actually,

1227
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,705
I haven't been
to most of these places.

1228
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:04,239
How long
have you lived here?

1229
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:05,607
20 years.

1230
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:09,311
And you haven't been
the least bit curious?

1231
00:49:09,412 --> 00:49:11,280
Well, you know,
look, it's what happens

1232
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,015
When you live someplace.

1233
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,149
It is a known fact

1234
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,951
That most people
who live in new york

1235
00:49:16,052 --> 00:49:19,154
Have never been to the top
of the empire state building.

1236
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:20,789
Well, that is,

1237
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,858
Until relatives come to
visit them from out of town.

1238
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:23,826
What are you
looking for?

1239
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,060
A tissue?

1240
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:26,695
Why didn't you
say something?

1241
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:31,834
Let's see what i have
in my handy-Dandy bag here...

1242
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,238
So, uh,

1243
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:38,574
If i were a tourist
in south woodbourne,

1244
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,075
Where would you take me?

1245
00:49:40,176 --> 00:49:41,310
Uh, north woodbourne?

1246
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,945
Oh, there is no
north woodbourne.

1247
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,480
Then why do they call it

1248
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,014
South woodbourne?

1249
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,050
I don't know,
it never really came up.

1250
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,285
We'd go hiking in the mountains.

1251
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:53,122
Canoeing definitely.

1252
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:54,656
Berry-Picking in the summer,

1253
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,059
Apple-Picking in the fall.

1254
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,594
Oh, and christmas...

1255
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:00,696
It's huge there.

1256
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:01,864
Christmas...

1257
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:05,234
The concerts,
the parties, it's...

1258
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,202
You miss it, huh?

1259
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:09,037
Yeah.

1260
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,472
A bit.

1261
00:50:10,573 --> 00:50:11,640
Oh, here you go.

1262
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:14,576
Thanks.

1263
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:16,011
So, it's...

1264
00:50:16,112 --> 00:50:17,780
That's quite an inventory
you have there.

1265
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,716
Well, what can i say,
i'm a second grade teacher.

1266
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:23,118
You'd be amazed
at what i have in this bag.

1267
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:24,787
Oh, wait.

1268
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,622
Check this one out.

1269
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:27,623
Oh.

1270
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:28,690
Boys favorite.

1271
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:29,558
That's fantastic.

1272
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,913
I didn't want to bother you.

1273
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,283
Here's the review.

1274
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:12,701
Hmm.

1275
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,103
Yay. I'm so glad
we get to watch this together.

1276
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:21,009
Okay, maybe
i don't want to know,

1277
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,911
But how did you
get rid of your friends?

1278
00:51:23,012 --> 00:51:24,980
I gave them
two-For-One-Coupons

1279
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,683
To a bar with a christmas
wet t-Shirt contest.

1280
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,451
Ugh, sounds festive.

1281
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,421
Okay, i really hope
you like this,

1282
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,323
'Cause mom and i watch it
every year, without fail,

1283
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,657
And we turn off
all the lights

1284
00:51:35,758 --> 00:51:36,692
Except for
the christmas tree,

1285
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,427
And have popcorn
and cocoa...

1286
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,662
Hey, um, heather?

1287
00:51:40,763 --> 00:51:42,064
Mm-Hmm?

1288
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:43,632
Do you
want to go home?

1289
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:45,601
No.

1290
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:47,970
'Cause, like,
for the last few weeks,

1291
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,438
You've been talking about

1292
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,240
How you wanted to get away
from your mom for christmas,

1293
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:52,641
But ever since we got here...

1294
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,110
It'd be one thing
if she stayed home,

1295
00:51:55,211 --> 00:51:57,212
But she's all alone
in a strange city.

1296
00:51:57,313 --> 00:51:59,081
I just...

1297
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:00,148
I understand
if you want to go back.

1298
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,453
I don't want to go back.

1299
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,355
Okay.

1300
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,659
Yay!

1301
00:52:13,162 --> 00:52:14,196
Wait, it's
black and white?

1302
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,465
You'll get over it.

1303
00:52:24,073 --> 00:52:25,807
That beginning
is so much better.

1304
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,175
Thank you.

1305
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,110
And i'm not just
being nice.

1306
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,545
I really mean it.

1307
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,746
Trust me, that never
entered my thinking.

1308
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:33,749
When we meet
samantha now,

1309
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,052
She's smart, and interesting,
and so much more complex.

1310
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,320
Thank you.

1311
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,321
I would've thought
a woman wrote it.

1312
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:40,289
What?

1313
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,957
Oh, that's a compliment.

1314
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:43,258
Well, excuse me
for missing it.

1315
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,226
Is white okay?
Because i have a red...

1316
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,460
What does that mean,

1317
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,962
"I would've thought
a woman wrote it"?

1318
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:48,263
Oh, come on, charles,
most men do not know

1319
00:52:48,364 --> 00:52:49,231
How to write
strong female characters.

1320
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,666
Is that right?

1321
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,067
Yeah, it is right.

1322
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,235
You guys don't know
how to deal with this stuff.

1323
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,503
You either see women
as sex objects

1324
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:55,671
Or mother figures.

1325
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:56,905
Whatever you say, mom.

1326
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:57,839
Okay, see, that's
what i'm talking about.

1327
00:52:57,941 --> 00:52:58,974
Total immaturity...

1328
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,309
I love the way
you generalize.

1329
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,243
You just group us
all together, right?

1330
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,144
If you don't believe me,

1331
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:03,445
I speak from experience.

1332
00:53:03,546 --> 00:53:04,479
Yes, i know, and that's
why you hate men...

1333
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:05,681
I don't hate men!
I love men.

1334
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,350
I just don't like them
all the time.

1335
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,318
Yeah, good talk.

1336
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:10,485
I gotta work.

1337
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,220
Did my notes help?

1338
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,423
Because you did a complete 180,
and the book is better.

1339
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,324
Is that a coincidence?

1340
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:16,692
I don't think so.

1341
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:17,659
I think
my notes helped,

1342
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,328
Didn't they?

1343
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,431
Yes...

1344
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,599
are those the new pages?

1345
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:27,769
Yes.

1346
00:53:28,671 --> 00:53:30,606
I'll get back to you
when i'm finished.

1347
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:36,645
What just...

1348
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,762
Hi.

1349
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,163
Hey, good morning.

1350
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,731
So, what's on
the agenda today?

1351
00:54:29,832 --> 00:54:32,567
Actually, i have a little
favor to ask you.

1352
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,469
Sure.

1353
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,173
Yeah, yeah. All right.

1354
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,976
Gotta go. Bye-Bye.

1355
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,377
Sorry.

1356
00:54:42,478 --> 00:54:43,979
The business?

1357
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,280
Yeah, yeah.

1358
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:46,515
They're a little anxious.

1359
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,883
End of the fiscal year.

1360
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:48,984
So, you find one you like?

1361
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,019
Oh, i found mine
10 minutes ago.

1362
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,020
I'm just wandering.

1363
00:54:52,121 --> 00:54:54,256
A little homesick,
i guess.

1364
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,158
Every year, my father and i,

1365
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,459
We'd go out to the woods,

1366
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,594
He'd cut down a fresh tree.

1367
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,596
Your childhood was something
out of norman rockwell,

1368
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:02,564
Wasn't it?

1369
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:03,999
yep.

1370
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,101
And then when heather
was a little girl,

1371
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:08,837
Frank decided he was going to
continue on with the tradition.

1372
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,272
So, they got to the woods,

1373
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,808
And he starts to
saw down the tree,

1374
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:13,775
She begins to cry.

1375
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:14,976
Aw.

1376
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:16,578
She thought he was
hurting the tree.

1377
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:17,813
From then on,

1378
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,916
We just picked one out,
had it delivered.

1379
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,259
I don't see a lot of
writing going on.

1380
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,861
Well, i'm thinking.

1381
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:33,829
You blocked?

1382
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:34,863
No, i'm not blocked.

1383
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:35,897
I'm thinking.

1384
00:55:35,998 --> 00:55:37,265
You look
a little blocked.

1385
00:55:37,366 --> 00:55:38,366
Okay, i don't look blocked
because i'm not blocked,

1386
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,668
And how does one
look blocked anyway?

1387
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,302
I just understand
being blocked.

1388
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,903
Okay, i'm not blocked.

1389
00:55:42,004 --> 00:55:42,738
I'm going to tell you what
i do when i'm blocked.

1390
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:43,739
I'm not blocked...

1391
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,973
Sometimes, i will be doing,

1392
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:46,475
Like, five events
for the same client,

1393
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:47,976
So i want to do something
different, right,

1394
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:49,544
And i get
completely stumped.

1395
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:50,645
The worst thing i can do

1396
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:51,780
Is walk around my office
thinking,

1397
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:53,081
So i go out.

1398
00:55:53,182 --> 00:55:53,782
I go to the gym,
or i go shopping,

1399
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,383
Or you know, whatever.

1400
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:56,952
Just to get
my mind off it,

1401
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:58,120
And then bang!

1402
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,454
A great new idea happens.

1403
00:55:59,555 --> 00:56:00,989
Trust me, you should try it.

1404
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:01,890
Just go, do something
to get your mind off it.

1405
00:56:02,925 --> 00:56:03,992
That's it.

1406
00:56:04,093 --> 00:56:04,993
I'm going to buy
that gun.

1407
00:56:05,094 --> 00:56:06,628
- No...
- It's those kids...

1408
00:56:06,729 --> 00:56:07,429
I'm on it, i'm on it.

1409
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,434
Merry christmas!

1410
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,069
She forgot to cancel

1411
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,670
The christmas tree delivery.

1412
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:17,038
No...

1413
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:17,839
Know what, i think we should put
it in the corner.

1414
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:18,874
No.

1415
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,442
I beg your pardon?

1416
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,743
I'm not having
a christmas tree in this house.

1417
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:22,744
Oh, no, do you have allergies?

1418
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:23,678
I don't have allergies.

1419
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,013
Is this a religious thing?

1420
00:56:25,114 --> 00:56:26,381
It's not
a religious thing, okay?

1421
00:56:26,482 --> 00:56:28,416
What on earth do you have
against christmas trees?

1422
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,785
Okay, look, blondie,

1423
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,286
I'm not debating it
with you, okay?

1424
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,788
I-I'm the landlord here.

1425
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,656
I have a contract,
all right?

1426
00:56:34,757 --> 00:56:36,324
You're the-The-The interloper.

1427
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:37,292
I prefer "guest."

1428
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,593
Okay, you know what,

1429
00:56:38,694 --> 00:56:39,494
Let me just move
your christmas tree.

1430
00:56:39,595 --> 00:56:40,562
Excuse me, thank you.

1431
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:41,563
Okay? Ow.

1432
00:56:43,132 --> 00:56:44,399
Ow.

1433
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,734
It's prickly.

1434
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:46,902
Ow.

1435
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,904
It's really
spiky...

1436
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:54,342
There.

1437
00:56:54,443 --> 00:56:55,310
Finished.

1438
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,145
Crude,

1439
00:56:57,246 --> 00:56:59,748
But economical.

1440
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,850
Hmm?

1441
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,385
Trust me,

1442
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:05,253
This is much easier
with grown-Up scissors.

1443
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:07,489
One week before christmas,

1444
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,191
Seven-Year-Olds
are bouncing off the walls.

1445
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:12,961
You have to do something
to keep them active.

1446
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,763
Show me
a second grade teacher

1447
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:17,165
Who can't decorate a tree
for under $3.00,

1448
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:19,167
And i'll show you
an amateur.

1449
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,071
What?
What's so funny?

1450
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:25,373
You.

1451
00:57:25,474 --> 00:57:26,341
Oh?

1452
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:27,342
In a good way.

1453
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:30,078
In a good way.

1454
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:31,279
So, how do you manage...

1455
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,682
Just hook it
on that branch,

1456
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,284
And just wrap it around.

1457
00:57:36,385 --> 00:57:38,620
Funny how?

1458
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:42,424
Well, look, you got to
understand that, well,

1459
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,693
Christmas has always been
just another day.

1460
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,862
I haven't decorated
a tree since...

1461
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,431
Since i was
a little kid,

1462
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:50,599
And that was
at an aunt's house.

1463
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,666
Most christmases,

1464
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:53,602
I'm in a hotel
or something.

1465
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:55,103
For a couple years,

1466
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:57,005
Charles and i got together
with his fiancee,

1467
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,306
And we'd do
a family sort of...

1468
00:57:58,407 --> 00:57:59,307
Charles was engaged?

1469
00:57:59,408 --> 00:58:00,842
Yeah, for a couple years.

1470
00:58:00,943 --> 00:58:03,245
It didn't work out,
but it was fun for a while.

1471
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,780
Turkey, presents,
the whole nine yards,

1472
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,082
But after they broke up,

1473
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:08,450
It sort of went back

1474
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:10,485
To the way
it's always been.

1475
00:58:10,586 --> 00:58:12,354
Basketball and chinese food?

1476
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:13,321
Right.

1477
00:58:13,422 --> 00:58:15,824
But this year...

1478
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,460
I don't know, it's weird.

1479
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:22,197
For the first time
in i don't know how long,

1480
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,566
It feels like christmas.

1481
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,294
Okay. Start
your engines.

1482
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:55,196
one, two, three!

1483
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,503
Nice one!

1484
00:59:03,005 --> 00:59:04,172
Blocked, huh?

1485
00:59:04,273 --> 00:59:06,841
yeah.

1486
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:11,479
Let me have
one of them saucers.

1487
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,881
Okay, he's there.
Give it your best shot.

1488
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:17,319
What are you...

1489
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,620
Oh, do you want a shot
at the champ?

1490
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,288
Go ahead, go ahead,

1491
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:21,389
Go on, try it.

1492
00:59:21,490 --> 00:59:22,791
Ugh! That's right,

1493
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:23,992
I come from a long line of...

1494
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,193
Mowing down children
with snowball...

1495
00:59:25,294 --> 00:59:26,394
Come on, do your worst...

1496
00:59:27,496 --> 00:59:28,730
Okay.

1497
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,031
All right,
small humans, you'll see.

1498
00:59:30,132 --> 00:59:30,999
You'll get yours.

1499
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,200
This arm is registered

1500
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:34,869
With the american
snowball association.

1501
00:59:36,238 --> 00:59:37,405
Hey! Whoa!

1502
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:39,574
Ugh!

1503
00:59:45,314 --> 00:59:47,315
That's it.

1504
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:50,852
Yes, yes, yes!

1505
00:59:50,953 --> 00:59:51,786
Yes!

1506
00:59:51,887 --> 00:59:54,089
What's wrong with<i>him</i>?

1507
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,357
He is a writer.

1508
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:58,994
So tell me something.

1509
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,528
Sure.

1510
01:00:00,629 --> 01:00:02,097
How have you
managed it?

1511
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,332
Managed what?

1512
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:06,634
Well, successful
businessman.

1513
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:07,802
Very bright.

1514
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:10,538
Pleasant company.

1515
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:13,274
All those things,

1516
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,910
And you don't mind
doing dishes.

1517
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,212
How did you manage to avoid...

1518
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,346
Marriage?

1519
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:20,081
Mm-Hmm.

1520
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:20,915
I know it's
none of my business.

1521
01:00:21,017 --> 01:00:23,184
I'm just curious.

1522
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:24,285
Oh, no, it's okay.

1523
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,721
It's an old cliche.

1524
01:00:26,822 --> 01:00:28,423
Married to
the business.

1525
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:29,657
I didn't think i was
trying to avoid it.

1526
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:33,895
There has been, well, say,
a woman i liked.

1527
01:00:33,996 --> 01:00:35,397
And then, bang,

1528
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:37,432
I got to go to asia
for a couple of months.

1529
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,300
It's not exactly conducive

1530
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,169
To sustaining
a relationship.

1531
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,470
Well, if you liked her,

1532
01:00:42,571 --> 01:00:44,072
Why didn't you just
take her with you?

1533
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,845
Well, maybe...

1534
01:00:50,946 --> 01:00:53,848
I didn't like her
as much as i thought.

1535
01:01:00,756 --> 01:01:02,791
Sorry.

1536
01:01:04,593 --> 01:01:05,493
Heather?

1537
01:01:05,594 --> 01:01:06,461
<i>Hi, mom.</i>

1538
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:07,629
Hi, honey, listen,

1539
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,097
I'm going to have to
call you back.

1540
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:10,065
I'm a little busy right now.

1541
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,433
<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

1542
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:18,039
Okay, something
is really wrong.

1543
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,278
Okay, look...

1544
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,982
Listen, i got to
slow down, um...

1545
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:28,917
You okay?

1546
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:31,352
Yeah, i am...

1547
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:34,255
I just...

1548
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:36,291
I'm leaving
in a couple of days.

1549
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:38,059
Wish you weren't.

1550
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,661
Well...

1551
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,162
I am.

1552
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,567
Is that all
that's bothering you?

1553
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:48,136
Yeah.

1554
01:01:49,738 --> 01:01:51,906
No.

1555
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,944
Okay, look, this is
going to sound really crazy,

1556
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,513
But, um...

1557
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:02,050
I feel a little guilty.

1558
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:03,785
Makes no sense, right?

1559
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:11,426
Frank's been gone
for almost three years now.

1560
01:02:13,095 --> 01:02:14,329
But it's still very tough

1561
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:18,166
To get over
something like that.

1562
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:19,901
I mean, sure, we got
on each other's nerves...

1563
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:21,870
That's marriage, you know,

1564
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:24,973
But, um...

1565
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,841
For the most part,
it was really great,

1566
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:31,412
And we were
very lucky,

1567
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:34,482
And christmas was just...

1568
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,651
Well, it was special.

1569
01:02:39,588 --> 01:02:40,889
I'm sorry

1570
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:42,624
I'm so...

1571
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:45,126
I don't know.

1572
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:51,866
Ray, meeting you...

1573
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:53,768
I just wasn't
expecting this.

1574
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:55,036
I should be at home

1575
01:02:55,137 --> 01:02:57,705
Decorating gingerbread
houses right now...

1576
01:02:57,806 --> 01:02:58,673
And here you are.

1577
01:02:58,774 --> 01:02:59,674
Yeah.

1578
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,345
I'm a little...

1579
01:03:04,446 --> 01:03:07,048
I'm a little confused.

1580
01:03:07,149 --> 01:03:08,583
A<i>little</i>confused,
what am i saying?

1581
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:09,951
I'm<i>very</i>confused.

1582
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:11,252
Hey...

1583
01:03:11,353 --> 01:03:13,087
Emily,

1584
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:14,122
I wish i could say

1585
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:15,957
That...

1586
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:17,192
I know how you're feeling,

1587
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,726
But i can't.

1588
01:03:18,827 --> 01:03:20,962
I've never felt like that
about anybody before.

1589
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:23,097
Well, you should try,

1590
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:24,532
Because you're really
missin' out

1591
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:26,100
On somethin' special.

1592
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:28,403
What i'm trying to say,
emily, is that...

1593
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:32,273
Well, i think i'm starting
to feel that way right now.

1594
01:03:37,112 --> 01:03:38,580
I should go.

1595
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:39,447
I'm so sorry.

1596
01:03:39,548 --> 01:03:41,282
Don't be.

1597
01:03:41,383 --> 01:03:43,151
I'll, uh, see you tomorrow?

1598
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:46,354
I hope so.

1599
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:58,733
Okay, okay, calm down.

1600
01:03:58,834 --> 01:03:59,701
<i>I can't calm down.</i>

1601
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:00,635
<i>I feel...</i>

1602
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:01,903
I feel i...

1603
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:03,037
I don't know how i feel,

1604
01:04:03,138 --> 01:04:04,372
Like i'm a teenager
or something.

1605
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,340
Did you get lucky?

1606
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,141
No. Stop that.

1607
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,176
Okay...
Oh, hold for a sec.

1608
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:09,310
I have another call.
Hello?

1609
01:04:09,411 --> 01:04:10,311
Hey, faith.
It's heather.

1610
01:04:10,412 --> 01:04:11,379
Have you talked to mom?

1611
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,447
Hey, heather.
Hold for a sec.

1612
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:13,681
Okay, it's heather.

1613
01:04:13,782 --> 01:04:15,083
She wants to know
if i've talked to you.

1614
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,217
Okay, tell her no.

1615
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:17,352
And-And tell her
i'm fine.

1616
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:18,219
Okay.

1617
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,420
Hey, heather...

1618
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:20,822
Oh, you know what,
hold for a sec.

1619
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:21,689
Okay, which is it?
"No" or "i'm fine?"

1620
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:22,790
I'm fine!

1621
01:04:22,891 --> 01:04:23,992
Okay, you know,
i really hate

1622
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:25,827
Being caught
in the middle like this.

1623
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:27,829
Okay, just
tell her i'm fine.

1624
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:28,796
I gotta go. I'll
talk to you later.

1625
01:04:28,897 --> 01:04:29,964
Okay, bye.

1626
01:04:30,065 --> 01:04:31,299
Hi, heather.

1627
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,433
You know...
You know what, honey,

1628
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:33,368
I'm going to call you
right back.

1629
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,470
Hey.

1630
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,105
You.

1631
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,506
If you are stalking me,
i'm going to call the cops.

1632
01:04:38,607 --> 01:04:40,975
ha... ha, ha.

1633
01:04:41,076 --> 01:04:42,377
Lookit,

1634
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:43,578
No post-Its.

1635
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,914
Well, isn't that
better than a pulitzer.

1636
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:49,717
I am dying to know
how it ends.

1637
01:04:49,818 --> 01:04:50,752
He doesn't kill her
painfully, does he?

1638
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,820
Well...

1639
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:54,122
Painfully...

1640
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,590
No, that's the first draft.

1641
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,026
Listen, can we just
call a truce

1642
01:04:58,127 --> 01:04:59,527
For tonight?

1643
01:04:59,628 --> 01:05:00,728
Why don't you
come and join me?

1644
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:08,469
I was actually
very happy living here.

1645
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:09,637
You know, i thought it would be

1646
01:05:09,738 --> 01:05:12,974
A great place
to raise a family.

1647
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:14,208
Then, one day, my husband
came home

1648
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,877
And said that we were moving,

1649
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:17,245
And he...

1650
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:21,683
He just took me
to this strange city,

1651
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:23,217
And three months later,
he walked out.

1652
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:26,921
Men, huh?

1653
01:05:27,022 --> 01:05:29,457
Yeah.

1654
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:30,591
So, i want to know,

1655
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:31,492
Is, um, samantha

1656
01:05:31,593 --> 01:05:33,328
Based on your fiancee?

1657
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:34,996
How do you...

1658
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,030
We said we weren't going to...

1659
01:05:36,131 --> 01:05:37,265
How do you know
about that?

1660
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,434
Ray told emily,
and then emily told me.

1661
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:40,802
Unbelievable.

1662
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:42,036
You know, i think

1663
01:05:42,137 --> 01:05:42,904
There's something
going on with those two.

1664
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:43,805
What have you heard?

1665
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:44,672
I've just heard things.

1666
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:45,340
What have you heard?

1667
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,574
Nothing specific,

1668
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:47,542
But ray...

1669
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:48,676
Ray's normally...

1670
01:05:48,777 --> 01:05:49,644
He's a...

1671
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,347
Very serious.

1672
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,481
But now he's...

1673
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:54,949
Now he sounds like...

1674
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:56,317
He sounds like...

1675
01:05:56,418 --> 01:05:57,485
I don't know
what he sounds like,

1676
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:59,087
But he doesn't sound like ray.

1677
01:05:59,188 --> 01:05:59,887
Okay, you know what,
that is the same with emily.

1678
01:06:01,256 --> 01:06:02,190
This is weird.

1679
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:03,024
I know, right?

1680
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,025
Yeah...

1681
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:06,828
You are avoiding

1682
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:07,795
The subject.

1683
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:08,996
I want to know,

1684
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:10,064
Is samantha based on
your fiancee?

1685
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:11,032
Yes!

1686
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,100
Yes...

1687
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,868
Samantha is based on
my fiancee...

1688
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:15,236
My<i> ex</i>- Fiancee.

1689
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:17,605
And you used her
in "long weekend," too, right?

1690
01:06:17,706 --> 01:06:19,574
How do you know about "long..."

1691
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:20,541
I-I ordered
a couple of your novels

1692
01:06:20,642 --> 01:06:21,542
The other night.

1693
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:23,578
Really?

1694
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:24,612
Really.

1695
01:06:24,713 --> 01:06:27,115
Well... thank you.

1696
01:06:27,216 --> 01:06:28,583
It's a beautiful book.

1697
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,786
Was that when
you guys first met?

1698
01:06:33,455 --> 01:06:35,623
Your honeymoon phase?

1699
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:37,458
Yeah. I guess.

1700
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,797
Honeymoon phase...

1701
01:06:47,302 --> 01:06:48,936
I think they want us to leave.

1702
01:06:49,037 --> 01:06:50,004
Okay.

1703
01:06:54,743 --> 01:06:56,677
Will you finish
the book on time?

1704
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:58,346
Maybe tomorrow.

1705
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,248
Ah, i can't wait
to buy one.

1706
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,249
Oh, i can
send you a copy.

1707
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,183
Autographed?

1708
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:03,317
Of course.

1709
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:04,385
And i want something
personal, too.

1710
01:07:04,486 --> 01:07:05,653
None of this
"best wishes" stuff.

1711
01:07:05,754 --> 01:07:06,821
You know, i'd like to
impress my friends.

1712
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:11,192
Well, i'll see
what i can do.

1713
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:15,163
Look, i have to...
I have to tell you,

1714
01:07:15,264 --> 01:07:18,433
You have been
extremely helpful,

1715
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,934
And i don't mean
just answering doors.

1716
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:22,670
Well, it's
a good story, charles.

1717
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:24,138
You just had to soften samantha,

1718
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:25,807
That's all.

1719
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:28,042
That wasn't easy.

1720
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:34,015
How long has it been
since you guys broke up?

1721
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,983
It'll be two years
tomorrow night.

1722
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:39,220
Tomorrow night is
christmas eve.

1723
01:07:43,158 --> 01:07:44,325
Oh.

1724
01:07:44,426 --> 01:07:46,894
Yeah, i...

1725
01:07:48,997 --> 01:07:50,431
I came home,

1726
01:07:50,532 --> 01:07:53,701
And i saw her
decorating the tree,

1727
01:07:53,802 --> 01:07:54,869
And i thought,
"well, that's odd

1728
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,204
Because we've already
decorated the tree,"

1729
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,239
Then i realized she was
un-Decorating the tree.

1730
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,274
She was moving out

1731
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:04,712
And taking all
the decorations with her.

1732
01:08:04,813 --> 01:08:06,781
She left me some tinsel.

1733
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:09,717
Not the good kind either,
the cheap stringy stuff.

1734
01:08:09,818 --> 01:08:11,552
Ah...

1735
01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:14,822
So is this why
you hate christmas?

1736
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:17,058
I don't hate
christmas, faith.

1737
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:20,394
I just don't want to be
reminded of...

1738
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:23,197
Things.

1739
01:08:23,298 --> 01:08:24,999
That's all.

1740
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,301
That is the problem
with the holidays.

1741
01:08:27,402 --> 01:08:29,170
The good stuff
is always

1742
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,339
So much better
than it really is,

1743
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,942
And the depressing stuff
is always so much worse.

1744
01:08:35,043 --> 01:08:37,845
Well, maybe it'll
get good one day soon.

1745
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:51,192
Hey.

1746
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,994
We've got a flight
this afternoon.

1747
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,296
What do you mean?

1748
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:56,998
Well, you are miserable
without your mom,

1749
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:59,867
And i can't stand
seeing you miserable, so...

1750
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:02,169
Jase, you don't have to.

1751
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:03,804
I mean, it makes no sense
for both of us to go.

1752
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:04,805
You can stay.

1753
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:07,942
I'm not staying here
without you.

1754
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:09,176
Okay?

1755
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:10,177
So just, uh,
don't give me a hard time

1756
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,613
About this one.

1757
01:09:12,714 --> 01:09:14,649
I still can't
figure you out.

1758
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,450
What?

1759
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:17,518
Well, one minute,

1760
01:09:17,619 --> 01:09:19,353
You're this total
fratboy clown,

1761
01:09:19,454 --> 01:09:20,655
And then the next,

1762
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:23,357
You do something
really sweet, and...

1763
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:25,526
Okay, i'll say it,
mature.

1764
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:27,929
Oh, "mature."

1765
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,463
Well, uh...

1766
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,299
Just don't expect it
all the time.

1767
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,833
Please.

1768
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:38,873
Let's get packing.

1769
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:40,107
Okay.

1770
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:45,746
Hello!

1771
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:51,652
Hey...

1772
01:09:51,753 --> 01:09:52,753
Hey, where were you?

1773
01:09:52,854 --> 01:09:54,388
I went to get stuff
for dinner,

1774
01:09:54,489 --> 01:09:56,123
And i figured
you being from boston,

1775
01:09:56,224 --> 01:09:58,459
You might find this
kind of traditional.

1776
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:02,997
Finished?

1777
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:03,965
Finished.

1778
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:05,566
Finished!

1779
01:10:07,035 --> 01:10:08,970
Whoo-Hoo!

1780
01:10:12,674 --> 01:10:15,042
Lobster...

1781
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,650
Ah, perfect.

1782
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:24,785
Champagne.

1783
01:10:24,886 --> 01:10:26,487
It's like
we're at a wedding.

1784
01:10:26,588 --> 01:10:29,590
Well, we are celebrating,
but not just christmas.

1785
01:10:29,691 --> 01:10:30,725
I made a big
decision today.

1786
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:31,692
Oh?

1787
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:34,428
I am selling my company.

1788
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,298
What made you decide that?

1789
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,399
Well, i decided

1790
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,834
I can't be scared
about the future.

1791
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:40,968
I've played it safe
my whole life.

1792
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:41,936
I'm going to take a chance,

1793
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,771
And if i get bored,

1794
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:44,739
I'll find
something else to do,

1795
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,906
And, in the meantime,

1796
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:47,174
I'm going to have some fun.

1797
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:50,211
Well, that sound like
an excellent idea.

1798
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:53,881
Oh, you want to see
your present?

1799
01:10:53,982 --> 01:10:55,616
Wait, you didn't have to
get me anything.

1800
01:10:55,717 --> 01:10:56,784
Why do people always say that?

1801
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:58,786
Of course, i had to
get you something.

1802
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:00,287
No, but, see,
i didn't get you anything.

1803
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:01,622
I-I went to look
a couple of times,

1804
01:11:01,723 --> 01:11:02,957
But i...

1805
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:04,959
Do you want to see
your present?

1806
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:06,794
No.

1807
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:09,130
Not until christmas.

1808
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,232
After midnight.

1809
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,166
Okay.

1810
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,136
You sure?

1811
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:16,537
Mm-Hmm.

1812
01:11:16,638 --> 01:11:17,805
All right.

1813
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,674
Doubly sure?

1814
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:20,841
Very sure.

1815
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,377
She paid the delivery, so...

1816
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,813
Yeah, right.

1817
01:12:01,616 --> 01:12:03,084
Okay, well, the decorations
are under the stairs.

1818
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:04,318
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

1819
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:17,131
One hour
until christmas.

1820
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:44,058
Mom!

1821
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,793
Surprise!

1822
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:46,961
Honey!

1823
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:48,863
How did you get in here?

1824
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:50,231
The door was open.

1825
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,567
Hey, uh...

1826
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,837
You must be heather.

1827
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:05,679
Ray, i am so sorry.

1828
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:08,149
No, emily, your daughter
came across the country

1829
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,817
To be with you.

1830
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,185
I'd say
you're a very lucky woman.

1831
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:14,221
I know, i know, it's just...

1832
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:16,624
It wasn't exactly
what i had planned.

1833
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:17,992
Well, maybe it's for the best.

1834
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,161
What do you mean?

1835
01:13:21,596 --> 01:13:24,598
Your life is 3,000 miles
away from here,

1836
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:25,533
And you're leaving
in a couple of days.

1837
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:26,467
Maybe it's better

1838
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:27,635
If we don't make things

1839
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,003
Any more complicated
than they are.

1840
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,373
Yeah. Maybe...

1841
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:34,308
Maybe you're right.

1842
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:36,977
But...

1843
01:13:37,078 --> 01:13:38,212
That doesn't mean
you couldn't spend tomorrow...

1844
01:13:38,313 --> 01:13:40,948
I'd... feel funny.

1845
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,516
You should
spend christmas

1846
01:13:42,617 --> 01:13:45,786
With your daughter.

1847
01:13:45,887 --> 01:13:46,720
Your gift.

1848
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,128
Ray...

1849
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:55,763
They're beautiful.

1850
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:58,699
I left the receipt in there

1851
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,900
In case you want to
exchange them...

1852
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:02,703
No, i don't want to
exchange them.

1853
01:14:02,804 --> 01:14:03,737
I love them.

1854
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,474
I just still feel kind of bad
that i didn't get you anything.

1855
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:08,709
Hey, emily,

1856
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:11,946
You gave me
the best christmas i've had

1857
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,715
In a very, very long time.

1858
01:14:14,816 --> 01:14:16,851
Thank you.

1859
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:32,233
I can't believe
it's finished.

1860
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,801
You just had to work
on her character.

1861
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,436
Everything else
was good.

1862
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:37,371
I've been banging my head
against the wall for months.

1863
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:39,940
You just needed
a fresh set of eyes.

1864
01:14:40,041 --> 01:14:40,941
Yup.

1865
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:41,909
Female eyes.

1866
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,344
To female eyes...

1867
01:14:45,247 --> 01:14:46,847
Whoa.

1868
01:14:46,948 --> 01:14:48,482
no, i... yup.

1869
01:14:54,956 --> 01:14:57,591
Look, faith... I...

1870
01:14:57,692 --> 01:14:58,559
What?

1871
01:14:58,660 --> 01:14:59,660
I don't know.

1872
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,596
I mean...

1873
01:15:02,697 --> 01:15:05,799
This is kind of...

1874
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:06,867
We're...

1875
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:10,237
You leave tomorrow,
and...

1876
01:15:10,338 --> 01:15:11,205
And...

1877
01:15:11,306 --> 01:15:14,341
I don't know.

1878
01:15:14,442 --> 01:15:16,310
Well, look, okay, here we are...

1879
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:18,345
Right?

1880
01:15:18,446 --> 01:15:20,347
I mean, we're sharing
this big house together,

1881
01:15:20,448 --> 01:15:23,384
And-And i just don't want to
make you feel...

1882
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:24,952
Uncomfortable.

1883
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:30,724
Charles?

1884
01:15:30,825 --> 01:15:32,059
Yeah?

1885
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,961
I think you should just
go ahead and kiss me.

1886
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,030
I agree.

1887
01:16:00,388 --> 01:16:02,423
Hey.

1888
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:04,458
Why didn't you wake me?

1889
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:06,827
Honey, you did
all that traveling yesterday.

1890
01:16:06,928 --> 01:16:08,162
I thought
you'd want to sleep in.

1891
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:10,197
I always help
with the christmas pancakes.

1892
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:13,968
Pancakes, um...

1893
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,236
No griddle.

1894
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:18,172
I have cereal,
though,

1895
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:19,807
And fruit.

1896
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:21,141
You love fruit.

1897
01:16:21,242 --> 01:16:22,676
Huh?

1898
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:39,293
Morning.

1899
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:40,928
Good morning.

1900
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,264
Why didn't you wake me?

1901
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:45,566
Oh, i...

1902
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,801
Well, i wanted...
i wanted to surprise you.

1903
01:16:47,902 --> 01:16:48,802
I'm, uh...

1904
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:51,205
I'm making...

1905
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:52,506
I'm attempting
to make you breakfast.

1906
01:16:54,442 --> 01:16:56,643
Well, you better make it to go
'cause i have a bus to catch.

1907
01:17:00,548 --> 01:17:01,548
Did you forget?

1908
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:05,552
Yeah.

1909
01:17:05,653 --> 01:17:09,156
I guess i did.

1910
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:15,195
Okay, well, um...

1911
01:17:16,464 --> 01:17:18,599
So...

1912
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:19,633
Right.

1913
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:22,202
Your bus.

1914
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,303
Uh...

1915
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:24,738
Would you...
Do you want to...

1916
01:17:24,839 --> 01:17:26,673
Are you sure can't stay,
have a few...

1917
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:28,809
No, i-I think
i'd better just go.

1918
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:35,716
Okay. Right, yeah.

1919
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:36,917
I'll get my keys.

1920
01:17:37,018 --> 01:17:39,520
I will get my bag.

1921
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,691
I can't believe
you brought these.

1922
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:46,560
Creature of habit.

1923
01:17:46,661 --> 01:17:47,895
Ooh, i have pictures
of the christmas we made these

1924
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,696
On my phone.

1925
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:50,597
I scanned all the old
christmas pictures

1926
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:51,732
I gave you a disk, right?

1927
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:52,733
Yeah.

1928
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:53,934
Wait till you see these.

1929
01:17:54,035 --> 01:17:55,169
I was looking at them
the other day.

1930
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,738
Yeah, i saw them back home.

1931
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:59,306
I love this picture.

1932
01:17:59,407 --> 01:18:01,208
And i remember when we took it,
you me and dad...

1933
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,176
Honey...

1934
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,378
Honey, i...

1935
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,246
I don't want to
look at them right now.

1936
01:18:06,347 --> 01:18:08,315
Oh, mom...

1937
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:09,683
I'm sorry, i didn't mean
to upset you.

1938
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:12,319
No, no, no, no, no,
you didn't.

1939
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,488
I love that you look at them.

1940
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:19,059
It's important that...

1941
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,394
It's important not to forget.

1942
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:23,130
These last few days

1943
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,532
Have made me realize

1944
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:29,069
That as nice as it was,

1945
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:31,939
It's just never going to
be the same again,

1946
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,708
And when i look at
those pictures, honey...

1947
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:38,712
I just feel alone.

1948
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:42,583
Maybe this whole
crazy christmas thing

1949
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,251
Has been good for me, huh?

1950
01:18:46,087 --> 01:18:49,556
It's made me accept
that things change,

1951
01:18:49,657 --> 01:18:54,061
And that i may have been
holding onto my past

1952
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:55,796
A little too much.

1953
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:58,198
So...

1954
01:18:58,299 --> 01:19:00,601
It's time to take a chance.

1955
01:19:06,674 --> 01:19:08,675
Looks like you have
your choice of seats.

1956
01:19:08,776 --> 01:19:11,044
Yeah, i guess it's not
a very big travel day.

1957
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:13,013
I guess not.

1958
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:17,351
Faith?

1959
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,453
Mm-Hmm.

1960
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:21,321
Thank you.

1961
01:19:21,422 --> 01:19:22,322
No problem.

1962
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:27,394
Just don't forget
to send me a copy, okay?

1963
01:19:27,495 --> 01:19:29,630
Absolutely not.

1964
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:32,366
Okay.

1965
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:04,264
Hey, excuse me?

1966
01:20:04,365 --> 01:20:06,366
Open up.

1967
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:09,336
Faith...

1968
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:10,771
Charles, what are you doing?

1969
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:11,738
You don't really
want to spend christmas

1970
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:12,806
On a bus, do you?

1971
01:20:12,907 --> 01:20:13,907
Of course not.

1972
01:20:14,008 --> 01:20:15,242
They why are you
getting on one?

1973
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:16,643
Because i...

1974
01:20:16,744 --> 01:20:17,978
I thought you wanted me to.

1975
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,146
No, i don't want you to.

1976
01:20:20,748 --> 01:20:21,915
Well, then, why didn't you
say something?

1977
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,217
I was waiting
for you to say something.

1978
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:24,651
Well, i-I didn't
really think

1979
01:20:24,752 --> 01:20:25,686
That it was my place
to say something.

1980
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:27,254
May i say something?

1981
01:20:27,355 --> 01:20:29,957
I'd really like to
get home for christmas.

1982
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:49,142
Mom.

1983
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,577
You know what i want
for christmas,

1984
01:20:50,678 --> 01:20:51,945
More than anything else?

1985
01:20:52,046 --> 01:20:53,046
You're not angling
for that pony, are you?

1986
01:20:53,147 --> 01:20:54,114
Because i can't get
a pony...

1987
01:20:54,215 --> 01:20:55,749
No.

1988
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:56,950
What i want...

1989
01:20:57,051 --> 01:20:59,620
Is for you to get dressed up.

1990
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,021
I want you to put on
those earrings ray gave you,

1991
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:03,690
I want you
to look fabulous,

1992
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:04,958
And then...

1993
01:21:05,059 --> 01:21:06,026
I want you to go his place
for dinner.

1994
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,030
No.

1995
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:13,000
Why not?

1996
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:15,769
Well, because it's christmas.

1997
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:17,504
Yeah, and this one christmas,

1998
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:18,972
We're going to do
something different.

1999
01:21:19,073 --> 01:21:21,308
Heather, i am not leaving you
alone for christmas.

2000
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:23,677
Okay.

2001
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:25,479
Then how about this...

2002
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:39,593
...to lie on the floor

2003
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:45,465
 by the light
of the christmas tree 

2004
01:21:45,566 --> 01:21:47,501
 and do you remember...

2005
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:49,569
Hey.

2006
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,605
It just isn't christmas
without a tree.

2007
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:53,540
How right you are.

2008
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:54,841
And we brought chinese food. -
"We?"

2009
01:21:54,942 --> 01:21:56,743
Mm-Hmm.

2010
01:21:56,844 --> 01:21:57,778
This is jason.

2011
01:21:58,813 --> 01:21:59,813
Well, hey, come on in!

2012
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:04,418
Merry christmas.

2013
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:05,419
Merry christmas.

2014
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,054
I got the tree.

2015
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:08,522
Got it?

2016
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:09,389
Merry christmas.

2017
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:10,924
Merry christmas.

2018
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:15,696
merry christmas

2019
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:26,373
 making angels
in the snow 

2020
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:30,410
 sun goes down
and the streetlights... 

2021
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:31,778
 begin to glow

2022
01:22:31,879 --> 01:22:32,979
Hey!

2023
01:22:33,081 --> 01:22:34,548
Hi, guys!

2024
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:35,482
Merry christmas.

2025
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,551
Merry christmas.

2026
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:38,552
We made it.

2027
01:22:38,653 --> 01:22:39,553
How are you
feeling?

2028
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:40,754
I feel good.

2029
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:41,755
The baby's been
kicking up a storm.

2030
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:44,958
Let me look at it.

2031
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:46,393
See, i told you

2032
01:22:46,494 --> 01:22:47,661
We wouldn't be
in the house 30 seconds,

2033
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:48,729
And she'd have
her hand on my stomach.

2034
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:51,565
- Hey...
- Merry christmas.

2035
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:53,100
- Merry christmas!
- Merry christmas.

2036
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,436
I was decorating the tree
if you can believe it.

2037
01:22:56,537 --> 01:22:57,904
I kind of
can't believe it.

2038
01:22:58,005 --> 01:22:59,740
Doesn't really
run in the family...

2039
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:10,984
 do you remember...

2040
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:14,521
 do you remember
remember... 

2041
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:17,691
 how it used to be?
