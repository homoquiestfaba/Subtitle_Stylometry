You definitely pulled the slide?

[dramatic music]

363
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,810
Mom.

364
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:18,546
Hey, don't go back there.

365
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,284
Mom, what are you doing?

366
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:25,987
I'm burning your father's crap.

367
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:31,859
No, Mom, that's,
that's Dad's stuff.

368
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:33,260
Callie, stop it, it's done.

369
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:34,696
No, you have no
right to do this.

370
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:37,965
I'm not looking at
this obsession anymore.

371
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:39,167
It's sick.

372
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,669
You know what, you're sick, Mom.

373
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:45,205
Dad was right about all of it.

374
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:50,310
What is this?

375
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:53,581
This is what you've been doing?

376
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:56,984
Why you've been
hiding away? Reading?

377
00:37:00,154 --> 00:37:01,388
Mom, don't.

378
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:03,124
I can't do this
anymore, I can't.

379
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:05,793
Cal, stop it.

380
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:09,496
[Cal] No, no, no!

381
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,867
Listen, we have
to move on, okay?

382
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,870
-This is how.
-Get away from me.

383
00:37:18,438 --> 00:37:20,240

394
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:07,889
I made dinner. Are you hungry?

Callie, what the
hell are you doing?

405
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:58,232
Are you running
away from home now?

406
00:39:58,266 --> 00:39:59,499
That's where we're at?

407
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:01,269
No, I was looking for someone.

408
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:02,570
Just stop, stop.

Look, if you're mad, be mad.

00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:05,506
Don't do this.

411
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:08,509
I'm sorry for before, okay?

412
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:11,746
Well, maybe I'm
sick of sorry, Mom.

413
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:14,414
Sick of spending my whole
life worried about you,

414
00:40:14,447 --> 00:40:18,986
about how you feel, whether
you're gonna lose it or not,

415
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:22,623
while you just do what you want.

416
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:25,026
-That's not fair.
-No?

417
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:27,361
Well, first you sell the house.

418
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:30,064
His favorite place in
the whole wide world

419
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:32,333
and then you burn his work,

420
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:35,169
and the only thing that
could maybe bring him back.

421
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:38,973
Oh God, Cal.

422
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:40,975
Cal, I'm so sorry
that I hurt you,

423
00:40:41,008 --> 00:40:43,110
but he's not coming back, okay.

424
00:40:43,144 --> 00:40:45,913
I hate it as much as
you do, but he is gone.

425
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:47,848
He's gone, he's gone.

426
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,287
Maybe Aunt Meg was right.

427
00:40:55,056 --> 00:40:56,891
Maybe I shouldn't live with you.

Don't scream.

433
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,394
I even left my ax at home.

434
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:14,869
How?

435
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:17,038
I saw it in the fire.

436
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:19,940
Fire doesn't hurt it.
Nothing does.

437
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:22,343
So what you said in the
barn was true about my dad?

438
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:23,577
He's alive?

439
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:25,079
Yeah.

440
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:27,048
He's the only one who might
know how to destroy it.

441
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:29,383
It's why I wanna find him,

442
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:31,485
but I'll need your
help to do it.

443
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:33,522
What do you say?

444
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:40,661
This will be dangerous, Callie.

445
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:46,834
Callie, you need to know that.

446
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:48,235
I'm not scared.

447
00:42:50,071 --> 00:42:52,173
Well, you should be.

448
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:54,141
The Reek killed
everyone I loved.

449
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:56,777
Including Lewis from my world.

450
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:58,412
I'm lucky to be alive.

451
00:42:58,446 --> 00:43:01,482

453
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,141
[Lewis] Hey!

454
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:30,678
Lewis knew I was in danger.

455
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:32,446
So he lured the
Reek away from me.

456
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:41,355
[soft dramatic music]

457
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,995
Lewis!

458
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:51,332
<i>Lewis saved our</i>
<i>world from the Reek.</i>

459
00:43:51,365 --> 00:43:53,033
<i>He sent it back through</i>
<i>the veil for now,</i>

460
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:56,437
so if the Reek gets through
your world will fall,

461
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:58,439
like mine did.

462
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,040
[Rae] Callie, Callie,
open the door.

463
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:01,408
You have to go.

464
00:44:01,442 --> 00:44:02,843
Maybe we should tell
her, she could help us.

465
00:44:02,877 --> 00:44:03,978
No, no, you clearly
don't know my mom.

466
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:05,379
-You have to go.
-Callie.

467
00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:07,214
I'll meet you in the
barn in 20 minutes, okay?

468
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:08,716
Callie, open this door,

469
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:10,519
open this door, right now.

470
00:44:24,698 --> 00:44:27,935
I heard, I heard
someone and you,

471
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:29,571
I heard a voice.

472
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:31,805
I was on the phone.

473
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,108
No, don't do that to me, Callie.

474
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:35,644
I heard two voices.

475
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:39,079
One was you.

476
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:40,848
The other one was a boy.

477
00:44:40,881 --> 00:44:42,116
I heard it.

478
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:45,252
It was just me, Mom.

479
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,421
I'm sorry.

480
00:45:41,543 --> 00:45:44,646
So which world do
we look at first?

481
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:46,080
We're not looking.

482
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:48,315
We're going, set it to four.

483
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:50,585
Going? I, I thought you
said it was dangerous.

484
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:54,154
Well, we can't bring him
back by looking, can we?

485
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:55,724
And the whole time you
look the veil stays open,

486
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:57,825
which lets the Reek in.

487
00:45:57,858 --> 00:45:58,826
This way is safer.

488
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,160
Now point it at me.

489
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:02,496
So, so how does this
veil thing work anyway?

490
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:05,432
If the veil is opened too
many times, it collapses.

491
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,572
What happened to
not being scared.

492
00:46:10,605 --> 00:46:11,673
I have questions.

493
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:13,007
Then I'll explain
when we get there.

494
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,342
Just take my hand.

495
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:16,844
If we're not touching
when you click,

496
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:18,379
then you'll just
push me through.

497
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:20,447
This way we both go, okay?

498
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:23,183
Just stay by me.

499
00:46:24,051 --> 00:46:25,452
We need each other now.

500
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:28,856
Fine.

501
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:30,291
But you stay by me.

[veil creaking]

505
00:46:52,379 --> 00:46:56,150
[Rae] It's not real,
pull it together.

506
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:09,631
[soft suspenseful
music continues]

507
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,803
[Cal] Whoa, why is
it so foggy here?

508
00:47:16,203 --> 00:47:17,871
[Drew] It doesn't
make any sense.

509
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,076
You definitely pulled the slide?

510
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:23,344
Yes.

511
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,149
[Drew] And we're definitely
in world four, right?

512
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:30,685
Yes.

513
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:32,052
That can't be right.

514
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:35,422
It's just, it looks
like world five did

515
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:36,658
after the veil fell.

516
00:47:36,691 --> 00:47:37,759
Well, it's a shame

517
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:39,126
I don't know what that is.

518
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:41,495
Think of it like a wall
between the worlds.

519
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:44,498
It's like the only barrier
that's keeping the Reek out.

520
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:50,471
So the way it works, the
scope tears the veil.

521
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:53,641
That's how you see or
move between places.

522
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:55,710
But do that too
much and it falls.

523
00:47:56,778 --> 00:47:58,412
Like it did in my world.

524
00:47:58,445 --> 00:47:59,880
And then what happens?

525
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:01,649
There's no barrier.

526
00:48:01,683 --> 00:48:03,785
The Reek comes in
and everything dies.

527
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,658
[Cal] So a version of your
family will be inside here?

528
00:48:10,692 --> 00:48:13,595
Hopefully, let's find
out if we're too late.

[Cal] Drew, is that your mom?

534

[Drew] No, my real mom,

535
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:51,391
she died in world five.

536
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:05,305
What is it? Is it Callie?

537
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:07,007
She's fine.

538
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,409
It's me, I'm sick.

[soft suspenseful music]

541
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,421
We have to go.

542
00:50:21,455 --> 00:50:23,457
[Cal] No, we have
to look for my dad.

543
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:25,527
The veil's gone, there
won't be anything left here.

544
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,861
No, you don't know my dad.

545
00:50:26,895 --> 00:50:28,295
He's smart, Drew,
he'll be hiding.

546
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:31,331
Where? Look at this place.

547
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:32,432
I'm sorry.

548
00:50:32,466 --> 00:50:34,234
No, don't do that.

549
00:50:34,268 --> 00:50:35,435
He may be here.

550
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:37,005
Okay, you don't know.

551
00:50:37,906 --> 00:50:39,273
[floor creaks]

552
00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:42,476
Callie, set the scope.

[Reek shrieks]

555
00:50:56,189 --> 00:50:57,692
Run!

[dramatic suspenseful music]

00:51:08,502 --> 00:51:10,304
[door clicks]

[Cal whimpering]

561
00:51:18,378 --> 00:51:20,882
Help me, please, help me.

562
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:23,551
Help me, please.

563
00:51:24,953 --> 00:51:26,253
Take my hand.

564
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:27,956
Come on, just take it.

565
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:29,222
Callie, take my hand.

566
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:30,424

-Come on.

[Cal panting]

569
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:50,444
Where to next?

570
00:51:52,614 --> 00:51:54,616
[Drew] So we know he is
not here in world one

571
00:51:54,649 --> 00:51:56,684
and we know he
wasn't in world four.

572
00:51:56,718 --> 00:51:59,087
Drew, you don't
understand, he's smart.

573
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,420
He might be hiding.

574
00:52:00,454 --> 00:52:02,456
And you don't understand.

575
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:03,992
Smart doesn't matter
against that thing.

576
00:52:04,025 --> 00:52:05,793
It can be anywhere.

577
00:52:05,827 --> 00:52:07,427
Okay, well, then,
then we go to two.

578
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:08,428
He might be there.

579
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:10,732
And so might the Reek.

580
00:52:10,765 --> 00:52:13,266
-Then we go to five.
-He's not there.

581
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,169
Lewis told me that he was
gonna send him somewhere safe

582
00:52:16,203 --> 00:52:17,972
just until we fix things.

583
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:24,979
What do you mean, he told you?

584
00:52:25,013 --> 00:52:28,215
[tense ominous music]

585
00:52:30,518 --> 00:52:34,221
Callie?
Cal?

586
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:37,625
[Drew] <i>Lewis told me</i>
<i>that one day the scope,</i>

587
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:40,160
<i>it just appeared</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

588
00:52:40,193 --> 00:52:44,231
[tense ominous music continues]

00:53:08,656 --> 00:53:12,894
[tense ominous music continues]

590
00:53:20,935 --> 00:53:22,570
That's the thing that hurt you?

591
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:25,006
[Lewis] Yeah, I
call it the Reek.

592
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:27,842
-[Drew] How did it find you?
-[Lewis] I don't know.

593
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:30,310
<i>I was just starting to</i>
<i>explore with the scope.</i>

594
00:53:31,913 --> 00:53:34,381
-It's pretty neat, huh?
-[Cal] Oh, my God, Dad.

595
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:35,883
[Lewis] <i>It's powerful, Drew.</i>

596
00:53:35,917 --> 00:53:37,885
<i>Each world is so different.</i>

597
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:44,625
<i>Each version of me,</i>
<i>of Callie, the house.</i>

598
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:48,963
<i>Were so similar,</i>
<i>but so different.</i>

599
00:53:48,996 --> 00:53:53,835
<i>You know, the only thing</i>
<i>that I wouldn't change?</i>

600
00:53:54,702 --> 00:53:56,336
<i>I was so distracted,</i>

601
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,506
<i>I didn't realize the Reek</i>
<i>had come through the veil.</i>

602
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:00,007
<i>Not until it attacked me.</i>

603
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,978
[Reek growls]

604
00:54:04,011 --> 00:54:05,213
Ah!

605
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:15,790
[knuckles rapping]

606
00:54:15,823 --> 00:54:18,960
[Rae] Lewis, Lewis?

607
00:54:20,393 --> 00:54:23,363
[Lewis groaning]

608
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,602
Lewis, open the door.

609
00:54:27,635 --> 00:54:28,669
[Lewis] Just a minute.

610
00:54:28,703 --> 00:54:30,671
[knuckles rapping]

611
00:54:30,705 --> 00:54:33,340
[Rae] Drew's here.

612
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:34,609
[Lewis] Send him in.

613
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:41,015
Is it from one of
the other worlds?

614
00:54:41,048 --> 00:54:43,518
No, there's a space
between the worlds.

615
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:45,787
I think that's where it lives.

616
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,722
So there's more
than one of them.

617
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:50,258
I don't know.

618
00:54:50,323 --> 00:54:52,026
The real question is,

619
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:53,426
what if there's other
things out there

620
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,762
just waiting to get in.

621
00:54:57,632 --> 00:55:00,201
Now, you can't tell
anyone about this.

622
00:55:00,234 --> 00:55:03,571
[dramatic music]

623
00:55:03,604 --> 00:55:05,773
[Drew] <i>Even though</i>
<i>he knew the risk,</i>

624
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:07,875
<i>he became obsessed with it.</i>

625
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:14,816
<i>I warned Lewis that using</i>
<i>the scope could be dangerous,</i>

626
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:21,088
<i>but he didn't stop</i>
<i>and world five fell.</i>

627
00:55:21,122 --> 00:55:24,859
<i> We had to escape, and the only</i>
<i>person Lewis felt could help</i>

628
00:55:24,892 --> 00:55:28,361
<i>was your dad here in world one.</i>

629
00:55:28,395 --> 00:55:32,200
<i>He spiraled, Callie, his</i>
<i>research in quantum physics,</i>

630
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:33,935
<i>he knew he shouldn't</i>
<i>jump through the barrier</i>

631
00:55:33,968 --> 00:55:36,804
<i>between our worlds,</i>
<i>but he was desperate.</i>

632
00:55:39,874 --> 00:55:41,809
[Lewis] So what happened to you?

633
00:55:41,843 --> 00:55:44,912
It was Lewis, Lewis
from my world.

634
00:55:44,946 --> 00:55:46,446
He used the scope too much.

635
00:55:46,479 --> 00:55:48,850
He broke the veil, and the veil,

636
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:51,418
it's the only thing
protecting us.

637
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:52,687
So this thing, the stereoscope,

638
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,522
it breaks the barriers
between worlds?

639
00:55:54,555 --> 00:55:56,991
Yeah, but we're
still not sure how.

640
00:55:58,192 --> 00:56:01,329
I told him to stop,
but he wouldn't.

641
00:56:01,361 --> 00:56:02,697
That's when the Reek came.

642
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:04,665
The Reek?

643
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:06,033
Yeah, that's what
we're calling it,

644
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:08,035
but we need to get him
to stop using the scope

645
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:09,737
or the veil will fall
and we'll all die.

646
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:12,039
[Lewis] Drew, that's enough.

647
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:14,642
[Drew] <i>I didn't realize</i>
<i>what Lewis was about to do.</i>

648
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:17,477
Lewis, I'm gonna send
you somewhere safe.

649
00:56:17,511 --> 00:56:19,513
We'll come find you, I promise

650
00:56:19,547 --> 00:56:21,015
-No!
-Lewis!

651
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:24,585
I had no choice, Drew.

652
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:25,853
Now, Callie and Rae
will be here soon.

653
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:29,123
It's just until I
fix this, I promise.

654
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:34,962
So that's how you
know he's alive?

655
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:36,197
Because you stood there

656
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,665
while he sent my dad
away to be killed.

657
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:39,166
Lewis said that your
dad would be safe

658
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,668
and he said that
we'd go get him.

659
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:43,070
Yeah, I saw how
safe that world was.

660
00:56:45,606 --> 00:56:47,541
You know, if he's
dead, it's on you.

661
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:49,409
-I didn't.
-Stop.

662
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:52,914
I'll do it, I swear.

663
00:56:52,947 --> 00:56:55,082
I'll send you back to five.

664
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:56,918
Stay the hell away from me.

665
00:57:00,021 --> 00:57:01,289
Callie!

666
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:09,397
I know you don't like me.

667
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,335
I love that kid
more than anything.

668
00:57:15,636 --> 00:57:17,371
You know why I believe that?

669
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:20,675
Because you called me.

670
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:24,578
Oh Jesus, Meghan, you won.

671
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:26,314
You can stop patronizing me.

672
00:57:27,848 --> 00:57:29,250
I'll go get her.

673
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:37,158
Cal, I need to talk a second.

674
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:47,335
[knuckles rapping]

675
00:58:01,916 --> 00:58:05,152
[suspenseful music]

676
00:58:29,276 --> 00:58:31,245
Callie, Callie!

677
00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:32,346
Rae, what is it?

678
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:38,386
Baby, oh, thank God.

679
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:44,759
Callie, whatever
happened, you're bleeding.

680
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:46,394
No, it doesn't matter.

681
00:58:46,427 --> 00:58:49,296
It's Dad, he's alive.

682
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,698
He's not dead.

683
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:52,133
What, what are
you talking about?

684
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,168
He's alive in a different world

685
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:55,870
and I can prove it with this.

686
00:59:02,576 --> 00:59:04,478
Okay, I'll prove it to you.

687
00:59:04,513 --> 00:59:06,047
You gotta be careful
because when you put it in,

688
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,415
the Reek can come through.

689
00:59:08,783 --> 00:59:10,418
No, no, no, no, no.

690
00:59:10,451 --> 00:59:14,355
No, I must have
dropped it when I fell.

691
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:17,258
Cal, Cal, Cal.

692
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:19,560
I think it's time
we had a talk, okay?

693
00:59:22,363 --> 00:59:24,131
Come on, let's go.

694
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:25,766
[Cal] Drew said
he could help us.

695
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,301
We should be out there looking.

696
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:30,071
-Dad is in danger.
-Callie, stop.

697
00:59:30,104 --> 00:59:31,772
Do you hear how you sound?

698
00:59:31,806 --> 00:59:35,576
Monsters, a boy
from another world?

699
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:36,944
Your arm looks terrible, Jesus.

700
00:59:36,977 --> 00:59:40,147
-No, I'm fine.
-No, you are not.

701
00:59:40,181 --> 00:59:42,183
And your mom and
I think it's time

702
00:59:42,216 --> 00:59:43,951
that you come live with me.

703
00:59:49,457 --> 00:59:53,694
No, no, no, I don't.

704
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:56,565
Callie, that thing you saw,

705
00:59:58,165 --> 01:00:02,169
did it have horns
and those teeth?

706
01:00:03,404 --> 01:00:04,438
You saw it too.

707
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,642
Do I need to remind
you why I'm here?

708
01:00:08,676 --> 01:00:09,743
Your mom was hallucinating.

709
01:00:09,777 --> 01:00:12,346
No, she's not.

710
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:14,081
Mom, I should have,
I should have told you.

711
01:00:14,115 --> 01:00:16,183
Callie, you're
unwell and I am not

712
01:00:16,217 --> 01:00:17,818
going to leave you
here with this woman.

713
01:00:17,852 --> 01:00:19,019
Come on, okay?

714
01:00:19,053 --> 01:00:22,056
-Now, let's go.
-Wait.

715
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:24,425
I'm not going anywhere
with you, Aunt Meg.

716
01:00:26,561 --> 01:00:27,628
You should go.

717
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,803
Okay, but your father
wouldn't want you

718
01:00:35,836 --> 01:00:37,171
to go through this.

719
01:00:37,204 --> 01:00:39,608
I am doing this for you, Callie.

720
01:00:41,008 --> 01:00:42,309
I'm sorry.

721
01:00:51,018 --> 01:00:53,854
Mom, I should have asked.

722
01:00:53,888 --> 01:00:55,156
I should have said something.

723
01:00:55,189 --> 01:00:57,291
No, it's, it's okay.

724
01:00:59,594 --> 01:01:01,028
Let's go find your dad.

725
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:04,064
What'd you say?

726
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:16,043
Cal, have you seen
the flashlights?

727
01:01:16,076 --> 01:01:18,513
[Cal] Yeah, let me see
if I can find them.

728

[suspenseful music continues]

733
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,827
Oh God.

734
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,095
-Sorry.
-Callie.

735
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:09,664
I found the flashlights.

736
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:17,304
[Rae] So tell me about
this monster, what.

737
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:18,405
Callie.

738
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:24,945
I'm not the bad guy, I swear.

739
01:02:24,979 --> 01:02:26,413
I don't care what you say.

740
01:02:27,448 --> 01:02:28,916
I don't need you anymore.

741
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:31,352
No, you're gonna
have a hard time

742
01:02:31,385 --> 01:02:33,220
jumping worlds without this.

743
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,424
Hey, Mrs. Thomas.

744
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:44,431
Is that what we needed, Cal?

745
01:02:44,465 --> 01:02:45,966
If you're gonna go
up against the Reek,

746
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,736
you need all the
help you can get.

747
01:02:50,304 --> 01:02:52,439
[Rae] Why should we trust you?

748
01:02:52,473 --> 01:02:54,341
I messed up.

749
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,277
Just promise me that
once we find your dad,

750
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,480
we bury the scope, okay?

751
01:03:01,549 --> 01:03:03,317
Here, take this.

752
01:03:10,057 --> 01:03:13,494
We're not even, not yet.

753
01:03:17,264 --> 01:03:21,736
Callie, can we trust this kid?

754
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:24,305
He came back, I mean,
he didn't have to.

755
01:03:25,205 --> 01:03:27,207
He knows about this stuff.

756
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:29,376
We'll just keep an eye on him.

757
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:31,445
No, no, I'll keep an eye on him.

758
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:33,380
-You're staying here.
-What? No way.

759
01:03:33,414 --> 01:03:35,349
Listen, if something
happened to you

760
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:37,585
I would never forgive myself.

761
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,690
Right back at you, Mom.

762
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:45,794
And besides, like Dad said,

763
01:03:45,826 --> 01:03:49,163
the strongest shape in the
universe has three sides, right?

764
01:04:00,941 --> 01:04:02,376
This will help.

765
01:04:05,446 --> 01:04:07,314
Maybe try this instead.

766
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:13,287
What, we just show up?

767
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,589
Say we're from another world

768
01:04:14,622 --> 01:04:16,256
and ask them if they've
seen my husband?

769
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:17,659
Pretty much.

770
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:19,927
And either we find him
or a version of him

771
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,962
that might know how to help.

772
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:25,332
A version of him, oh God.

773
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:27,201
Come on, Mom, you can do this.

774
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:29,771
Ready?

775
01:04:32,674 --> 01:04:34,208
We have to touch.

776
01:04:34,241 --> 01:04:35,510
I'm not being creepy.

777
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:39,581
Fine.

778
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:42,282
And Drew, if anything
happens to her,

779
01:04:42,316 --> 01:04:43,585
I'll kill you myself.

780
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:47,121
Yes, ma'am.

781
01:04:47,154 --> 01:04:49,990
All right Callie,
set it for world two.

782
01:04:50,023 --> 01:04:51,358
All right, ready?

[eerie music]

784
01:05:07,374 --> 01:05:09,343
[Rae] This is the veil thing?

785
01:05:13,882 --> 01:05:17,317
Yeah, that's how it
looked where I lived

786
01:05:17,351 --> 01:05:18,586
just before it fell.

787
01:05:19,353 --> 01:05:20,688
Is that bad?

788
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:22,791
It just means we don't
have time to waste.

789
01:05:24,158 --> 01:05:25,926
[Drew] Come on.

790
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:28,763

797
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:05,927
Dad?

798
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,294
-Lewis.
-Dad.

799
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:08,563
Is that really you?

800
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:10,798
Cal?

801
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,100
What's going on here?

802
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:18,472
[Drew] Lewis, we're
gonna need your help.

[suspenseful music]

804
01:07:30,552 --> 01:07:32,520
It gets less weird, trust me.

805
01:07:39,293 --> 01:07:42,229
This is really real, isn't it?

806
01:07:42,262 --> 01:07:44,732
And as real as the thing
that's been hunting us,
thanks to you, it seems.

807
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:46,133
Well, I'm sorry, we didn't know.

808
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:47,902
[Rae] They were just
trying to find her father.

809
01:07:47,936 --> 01:07:49,469
They didn't know
that using the scope

810
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:53,041
would let that thing
in here, so sorry.

811
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:54,374
That's okay, I'm sorry

812
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:56,778
we haven't seen your husband.
He's not here.

813
01:07:56,811 --> 01:07:59,212
Well, then maybe you
guys can all come with us

814
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:01,248
and we can go look together.

815
01:08:01,281 --> 01:08:02,416
I have a better idea.

816
01:08:02,449 --> 01:08:04,117
I've got something
that might help.

817
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:06,854
Y'all sit tight, I'll go get it.

818
01:08:12,794 --> 01:08:13,895
What do you mean you can help?

819
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:17,632
It's fine, I'm
taking care of it.

820
01:08:17,665 --> 01:08:19,466
I just think that they didn't
know what's happening to us.

Maybe, now they planning

822
01:08:21,703 --> 01:08:24,137
on using that thing
even more, hm?

823
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:26,574
No, not if I can help it.

824
01:08:27,909 --> 01:08:29,577
So how do you think
you're gonna go find him?

825
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:31,713
Well, we go look?

826
01:08:31,746 --> 01:08:33,347
I mean, unless your
dad can help us.

827
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,616
No, no, no, no, no.

828
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:37,150
Give me the device
or I'll take it.

829
01:08:37,184 --> 01:08:38,218
I'm not gonna let my family die

830
01:08:38,251 --> 01:08:40,220
so yours can live, no, sorry.

831
01:08:40,253 --> 01:08:41,355
Give it to me.

832
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:43,925
Slide it across the floor.

-I said give it to me.
-Don't you hurt her.

834
01:08:46,393 --> 01:08:48,563
And move again and
I'll pull this trigger.

835
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:51,431
Give it to me.

836
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,067
Slide it across the floor.

And move, move.

Lewis, stop, don't do this.

839
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,281
Dad, how could you do that?

840
01:09:08,315 --> 01:09:09,483
We stay, we die, Cal.

841
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:11,919
Now, how's this thing work?

842
01:09:11,953 --> 01:09:16,490
Lewis, please, you don't
wanna do that, Lewis.

01:13:56,436 --> 01:13:57,470
[Rae] Go.

896
01:14:03,878 --> 01:14:06,781
[Reek growling]

897
01:14:07,782 --> 01:14:08,849
-[Reek shrieks]
-Hey!

898
01:14:08,883 --> 01:14:11,419
[rifle bangs]

899
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:19,894
[wind whooshing]

900
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:31,939
Rae?

901
01:14:31,973 --> 01:14:35,409
[somber music]

902
01:14:35,443 --> 01:14:36,978
Rae.

903
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:41,282
Dad?

904
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:48,923
-Are you okay?
-Dad!

905
01:14:48,956 --> 01:14:51,926
[Lewis] Oh, Callie,
it's really you.

906
01:14:51,959 --> 01:14:53,461
What are you doing here?

907
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:56,564
How did you find me?

908
01:14:56,597 --> 01:14:58,232
Callie figured it out.

909
01:15:01,702 --> 01:15:03,270
Okay, we have to get outta here.

910
01:15:03,304 --> 01:15:05,106
Okay, we're gonna go
inside and get the scope.

911
01:15:05,139 --> 01:15:07,074
No, that thing is
in there, waiting.

912
01:15:07,108 --> 01:15:09,276
We have to find a place to
hide and come up with a plan.

913
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:10,644
Come on, come on.

914
01:15:10,678 --> 01:15:13,014
Hey, we only get
one shot at this.

915
01:15:13,047 --> 01:15:15,483
Trust me, trust me.

916
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:22,223
Come on.

917
01:15:29,263 --> 01:15:32,333
Without the stereoscope,
I was stuck.

918
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:34,435
But that thing can't kill
me if it can't find me.

919
01:15:35,436 --> 01:15:38,239
[dramatic music]

920
01:15:43,444 --> 01:15:47,214
Now, let's figure out how
to get us all outta here.

921
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:52,553
[solemn music]

922
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:08,537
I can't believe
you're both here.

923
01:16:10,704 --> 01:16:11,939
You're telling me.

924
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:18,412
She kept pushing even
when I pushed back.

925
01:16:21,148 --> 01:16:22,450
And that is great.

926
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,653
And she gets that from her mom.

927
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:29,490
I hate to say it, but...

928
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,862
Mom's been a mess without you.

929
01:16:34,895 --> 01:16:37,031
Are you kidding me,
you saved my life.

930
01:16:39,967 --> 01:16:41,402
You're a badass.

931
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,910
It's okay.

932
01:16:49,944 --> 01:16:52,581
[solemn music]

933
01:16:56,951 --> 01:16:58,185
It's okay.

934
01:17:07,895 --> 01:17:09,296
Now from what I
could figure out,

935
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:11,632
there's a space between
the worlds, a dark plane.

936
01:17:11,665 --> 01:17:14,502
This is where the Reek lives.

937
01:17:14,536 --> 01:17:16,103
Okay, so if it likes
to dark so much

938
01:17:16,137 --> 01:17:17,905
and bullets can't kill
it then maybe fire can.

939
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:19,406
No, nothing can, Cal,

940
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,876
blades, fire, nothing
hurts it, I've tried.

941
01:17:21,909 --> 01:17:23,077
Which means we don't
try to kill it.

942
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:24,513
All right, we get
the stereoscope,

943
01:17:24,546 --> 01:17:26,447
we get home and we never
use that thing again.

944
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,684
Now, we won't kill it, but it
won't be able to get to us.

945
01:17:30,718 --> 01:17:32,153
Okay, that's fine with me.

946
01:17:32,186 --> 01:17:34,989
We've got to get moving
before it gets dark again.

947
01:17:35,923 --> 01:17:38,726
-Rae, Rae.
-[Rae gasps]

948
01:17:38,759 --> 01:17:42,496
It's okay, it's okay.

949
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,501
It's time.

950
01:17:47,536 --> 01:17:52,673
-You ready to do this?
-Yeah, yeah.

951
01:17:52,706 --> 01:17:54,308
Okay, I'll distract the Reek,

952
01:17:54,341 --> 01:17:57,344
you find the scope
and we meet back here,

953
01:17:57,378 --> 01:17:59,680
but we've got to move fast.

954
01:17:59,713 --> 01:18:02,651
As long as we stick to the
plan, we will make it, okay?

955
01:18:03,552 --> 01:18:04,752
Let's go home.

956
01:18:13,928 --> 01:18:17,264
[wind chimes clinking]

957
01:18:47,895 --> 01:18:51,600

Hey! Hey!

961
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,818
Go girls!

962
01:19:15,389 --> 01:19:17,324
[Cal] Come on, Mom,
we have to find the scope.

963
01:19:19,059 --> 01:19:20,528
[Rae] You look over there.

964
01:19:21,996 --> 01:19:25,232
[suspenseful music]

965
01:19:37,712 --> 01:19:39,146
Keep looking.

967
01:19:53,127 --> 01:19:55,730
What, come on, where are you?

968
01:19:58,566 --> 01:19:59,634
Oh, no.

969
01:20:01,302 --> 01:20:03,304
[Cal] The scope's not here.

970
01:20:05,906 --> 01:20:07,174
Maybe it got moved.

971
01:20:10,277 --> 01:20:13,715
-[Cal screams]
-What is it?

972
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:17,318
[Cal] Okay, I'm sorry.

973
01:20:20,254 --> 01:20:21,488
Cal! Cal.

[Reek groaning]

975
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:26,260
Do it now, do it now, Cal.

976
01:20:26,293 --> 01:20:28,429
[Cal] Setting it for world one.

977
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:37,539
Go, Dad'll be waiting.

978
01:20:41,275 --> 01:20:43,177
[knuckles rapping]

979
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:45,913
[Meg] Rae, you're
scaring me, let me in.

980
01:20:45,946 --> 01:20:47,716
[Cal] It's Aunt Meg.

981
01:20:47,749 --> 01:20:49,483
Oh God, not her.

982
01:20:49,517 --> 01:20:50,951
[Meg] Rae.

983
01:20:50,984 --> 01:20:54,221
Sorry, Cal, we just can't
deal with this right now.

984
01:20:54,254 --> 01:20:56,223
-Then we go around her.
-[Meg] Let me in.

985
01:20:56,256 --> 01:20:59,093

jump through world two.

Come on.

Hi, I need police dispatched
to me immediately.

1002
01:22:09,531 --> 01:22:11,465
My sister-in-law is mentally ill

1003

and my niece is locked
inside her house

1004

Everyone okay?
Whoa, that's my girls.
