00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,310
[Dib] <i>I used to look up at space</i>

2
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,356
<i>with hope and wonder
in my eyes.</i>

3
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,735
<i>Until space looked back.</i>

4
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,279
<i>Invader Zim,</i>

5
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:33,283
<i>evil,
alien soldier of the Irken Empire</i>

6
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,369
<i>sent by his diabolical masters,</i>

7
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,079
<i>the Almighty Tallest,</i>

8
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,539
<i>to infiltrate Earth</i>

9
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,833
<i>and prepare it for
the coming invasion.</i>

10
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,295
<i>Disguised as one of us,</i>

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,422
<i>he moved into my neighborhood,</i>

12
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,007
<i>he went to my school,</i>

13
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,802
<i>and with the help
of his vile mechanical servants,</i>

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,722
<i>plotted to destroy
everything we have,</i>

15
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,016
<i>- everything we are.</i>
- [helicopter whirring]

16
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,726
- [crowd shouting]
<i>- And then...</i>

17
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,311
<i>he vanished.</i>

18
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,189
<i>My name is Dib Membrane.</i>

19
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,816
I'm 12 years old.

20
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,986
<i>And I'm all that stands
between Zim</i>

21
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,989
<i>and the annihilation
of our world.</i>

22
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,236
[Professor Membrane reading]

23
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:23,249
Prepare your starving,
gurgling child-bellies

24
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,752
for the awesome eventuality

25
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,587
of dinner!

26
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,298
[groaning]

27
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,258
[oven dings]

28
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,684
Foodio 3000 hopes you love
what I have made.

29
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,895
Also, what is love?

30
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,481
Looks great, Dad.
I'm gonna eat that food.

31
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,000
[Professor Membrane]
Hold up now, daughter!

32
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,818
Isn't it time your brother joined us?

33
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,820
Oh, man, no.

34
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,405
Since Zim vanished,
Dib's been in his room for,

35
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,157
like, a million years.

36
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,284
I hardly recognize him anymore.

37
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,163
He just sits there in that chair
getting grosser...

38
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,290
smellier.

39
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,227
[Professor Membrane] He sure does,

40
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,211
but try to be
more understanding.

41
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,880
Dib's finally letting go
of his silly obsession

42
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,382
with aliens and ghosts

43
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,718
and all his other
non-scientific nonsense.

44
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,720
And it's not easy for him.

45
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,808
Imagine if you stopped believing in,
oh, video games.

46
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,476
Don't even joke about that, Dad.

47
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,894
[Foodio 3000 humming]

48
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,355
[Professor Membrane]
Honey, letting go of silly ideas

49
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,815
is just part of growing up.

50
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,233
Why, as a child,

51
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,694
I thought sharks were my friends.

52
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,656
[in ominous voice] I know better now.

53
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,199
[robotic arm whirs]

54
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,885
[in normal voice]
So, try to be more supportive.

55
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,161
He's your brother, after all.

56
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,872
Okay, Dad.

57
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,456
[grumbles]

58
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,848
[floorboards creaking]

[suit chirping]

60
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,406
Hey, Dib!
Dad says come to dinner!

61
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,866
[grunts]

62
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,117
[wind whooshing]

63
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,747
[Dib] You know
I can't leave my post, Gaz.

64
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,749
Just shove the food in here.

65
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,167
Where's the shoving stick?

66
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,753
I can't shove without
the shoving stick.

67
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,631
[Dib] Zim's still out there, Gaz,
so I have to wait

68
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,257
and watch.

69
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,968
No one else will.
They could never see the truth.

70
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,720
Why, though? Brainwashing?

71
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,055
Mind control?

72
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,225
[whispering] Brain-erasing ghosts?

73
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,561
Nobody believes me now,
but I'll make them see.

74
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,730
I'll expose Zim to the world,

75
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,941
and open humanity's eyes

76
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,819
to the danger they were in all along.
[chuckles]

77
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,949
Even Dad, world-famous
man of science will say,

78
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,784
[in strange accent]
"I believe you, Dib.

79
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,078
I'm sorry I ever doubted you."

80
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,789
That's the worst
Dad impression ever,

81
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,833
but, Dib, let it go.

82
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,753
Zim's been gone a long time,

83
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,090
and as far as you know,
he might just be gone for good.

84
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:23,012
I'd be willing to bet
that Zim will never, ever...

85
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,138
Oh, wait, there he is.

86
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,307
[Dib screeches] It's Zim!

87
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,686
He's back!
And he's doing stretches!

88
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,209
Nobody stretches like that
unless they're warming up for evil!

89
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,816
This is it! The... [grunts]

90
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,194
moment I've been...
[grunts and crashes]

91
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,988
waiting for!

92
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,114
[Gaz] What are you doing?

93
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,826
[groans] Gotta get to Zim!

94
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,662
Dib, no. Look at you.

95
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,540
The world's not ready to see
what you've become.

96
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,874
You're hideous!

97
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,128
The smell!

98
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,880
[Dib] The world... [grunts]

99
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,465
needs me!

100
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,776
- Take a bath first!
- [suit alarm blaring]

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,884
Take... [gags]

102
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,095
Take a bath!

103
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,223
No!

104
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,745
[thunder crackles]

105
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,046
[chair creaking]

106
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,019
Zim!

107
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:40,399
Yes, it is I, and... Hmm?

108
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,883
- Oh, wait, sorry.
- [flies buzzing]

109
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,611
You'll have to move along,
hideous goblin.

110
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,572
I'm posing dramatically
for when the Dib shows up.

111
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,533
- I am Dib.
- What?

112
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,202
- Ugh, ugh, ugh! Ugh!
- But...

113
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,388
- Give me a sec here.
- [stammers] We know each other.

114
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,455
[clears throat]

115
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,417
- [thunder claps]
- I've been expecting you, Dib!

116
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,545
I can tell.

117
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,463
You set up sprinklers
and everything.

118
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,549
[thunder crackling on radio]

119
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,136
- [gurgles]
- You can't prove anything!

120
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,388
- Anyhow, I...
- Where have you been, Zim?

121
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,306
I've been monitoring
your house, the school,

122
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,975
that taco place
you love so much.

123
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,476
No, no.
GIR loves that place.

124
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,727
I think it's dirty.

125
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,688
- [GIR] I ate a baby there.
- He did.

126
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,315
What have you been up to, Zim?

127
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,236
Phase one
of my evil plan, human.

128
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,155
Phase one.

129
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,908
[laughs maniacally]

130
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,420
[GIR giggles]

131
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,804
Computer! Laugh with me!

132
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,389
[Computer] I don't want to.

133
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,977
[chuckling softly]

134
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,772
- [sighs]
- [device beeps]

135
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,774
You've been in your house

136
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,527
sitting in the toilet all this time?

137
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,280
- Yes.
- Like, the whole time?

138
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,363
That's right.

139
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,033
Did you have to sit in the toilet?

140
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:17,163
Do not try to understand
the ways of my people, Dib!

141
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,834
From the moment
my mission began

142
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,587
on this horrible planet,
you've been there,

143
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,380
haunting my every move

144
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,633
like a squak
in my shmoopsquizz.

145
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,676
- A what in your huh?
- Uh-huh!

146
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,971
And while the rest of your kind
were easily fooled,

147
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,932
you were able to see through

148
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,267
my brilliant disguise.

149
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,355
[stammers] Martha!

150
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,732
- [screeches] Eh?
- The neighbor boy's an alien!

151
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,444
[stammers] Never mind, Martha.

152
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,738
- He's normal.
- Okay.

153
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,324
I knew if I vanished
for long enough,

154
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,243
you'd just watch and wait,

155
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,745
your neglected body
growing smelly

156
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,497
- and useless.
- [Dib whimpering]

157
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,793
But that was only Phase One
of my evil plan.

158
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,128
Well, keep watching, Dookie-Dib.

159
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,631
Watch helplessly as I begin...

160
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,592
Phase Two!

161
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,761
[chainsaw whirring]

162
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,721
- Hah!
- No!

163
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,765
I'm switching people's mail around.

164
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,935
That's illegal. No!

165
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,853
I'm reading
someone's newspaper.

166
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,898
I don't pay for a subscription. [laughs]

167
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,193
Nobody reads newspapers anymore,
but, no, stop!

168
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,404
Minimoose, get in on this mayhem!

169
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,738
[Minimoose squeaks]

170
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,993
That's my mom's pizza sticker.

171
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,371
She is crazy for pizza.

172
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,892
Hey, what... what are you...
Hey, that... that's...

173
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,167
Hey, don't... Wait.

174
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,420
Don't! Don't!

175
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,088
Don't!

176
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,758
[panicked stammering]

177
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,471
[squeaks]

178
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,681
Excellent.

179
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,184
Me! Me!
Let me do one.

180
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,191
I launched that pug into space.

181
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,295
- I thought you liked that pig.
- [car alarm goes off]

182
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,196
- Why I do that?
- What's the matter, human?

183
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,656
Why aren't you stopping me?

184
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,783
Can't fight back.

185
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,702
Sat too long.

186
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,121
Chair fused to butt.

187
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,540
More chair than man now.

188
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,543
Humans are such fragile, goopy things.

189
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,795
No Irken would ever
become a chair.

190
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,964
Wait! Was that Phase Two?

191
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,799
Of course it was!

192
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,968
Probably. Uh...

193
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,303
You know what?
Now I'm not sure.

194
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,972
Either way,
you're helpless to stop me,

195
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,390
Chair-Dib.

196
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,642
So long!

197
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,393

202
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,420
Excellent work, me.

203
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,675
All is going according to plan,
but there's still much to do, GIR.

204
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,136
Yes, sir! [shouts]

[Computer groans] What?

212
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,569
Open a connection with
the Almighty Tallest,

You see, GIR, The Tallest...

216
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,386
[Computer] Now calling The Tallest!

217
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,370
[groans loudly]

218
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,456
The Tallest
haven't heard from me,

219
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,459
their greatest
and most incredible invader,

220
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,253
in a very long time.

221
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,096
- They'll be sick with worry.

[muzak playing]

223
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,002
Hey, remember Invader Zim?

224
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,004
- Who?
- Zim.

225
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,213
Tiny?

226
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,299
Screamed a lot?

227
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,301
The guy that sends us the donuts?

228
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,472
No, that's Invader Jim.
He's great.

229
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,558
Oh, wait. Zim.

230
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:50,603
- We hate him!
- Yeah, that's him. [chuckles]

231
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,396
Remember the time
we lied and told him

232
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,400
we were sending him on
a secret mission to Earth,

233
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,835
but really we were just getting
rid of him because he's awful?

234
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,737
[laughs] Yeah. We're hilarious.

235
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,240
[comms officer] My Tallest,
there's an incoming transmission.

236
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,326
Yep, life's been pretty great

237
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,244
ever since
Zim vanished for good.

238
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,705
Anyhow, send that transmission through.

239
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,916
I wonder who it could ever be.

00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:39,527

Oh, no.

I really can't remember
what Phase Two is.

00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,724
I must have sat in that toilet too long.

<i>No, thank you.

269
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:33,455
Hmm, besides reminding me
how cool I look and sound,

270
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,957

You do? Good work, GIR! Tell me.

You gonna order a million pizzas,

276

and then I gotta roll around
in them pizzas,

277
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:56,520

about how I turn into a giant pizza.

This isn't the time

359
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,437
how far The Tallest are
from Earth.

360
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,064
[Computer] Zooming out.
Zooming out.

361
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,859
Zooming out.
Zooming out.

362
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,486
Zooming out.
Zooming out.

363
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,155
- Hurry it up.
- Zooming out.

364
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,990
- Zooming out.
<i>- Vámonos!</i>

365
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,867
I must begin Phase Two

366
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,870
before Dib gets back into
annoying fighting shape.

367
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,747
[Computer] Zooming out.
Zooming out.

368

Zooming out.
Zooming out.

369
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,960
Hmm, I'm sure it's there,

370
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,838
- somewhere.
- Zooming out.

[grunting]

375
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,991
I was in bad shape,
then I got too in shape,

376
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,808
now I'm back to normal shape.

377
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,518
[shouts]

378
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,771
[grunting loudly]

379
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,956
- [cat yowls]
- [game beeping]

380
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,625
Oh, man, Dib, not the coat.

381
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,460
It makes me look mysterious.

382
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,212
Now, step aside.

383
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,130
I've got a Zim to stop.

384
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,384
[Professor Membrane humming]

385
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,802
All right, test children.

386
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,971
These bracelets are just prototypes,

387
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:07,432
so try not to breathe or think
while the energy field is...

388
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,434
- [Dib grunts]
- What? Oh.

389
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,062
Behold, my boy child!

390
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,897
I can't remember the last time

391
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,400
I saw you this excited
about science.

392
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,483
Huh?

393
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,362
My new
Peace Day edition Membracelet.

394
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,699
Tomorrow at my big keynote event,

395
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,742
I reveal it to the world.

396
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,244
And when Peace Day comes,

397
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,413
the children of the Earth
will hold hands and...

398
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,622
Wait a minute.

399
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,582
The alien-hunting briefcase?

400
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,042
Oh, son.

401
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,128
Not this nonsense again.

402
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,840
Dad, trying to save the Earth
from Zim's alien evil

403
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,717
is not nonsense.

404
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,928
Without me, there might not be
an Earth to hold hands around.

405
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,889
- [children groaning]
- Son, there are no aliens.

406
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,643
I've tried to be patient with
your unscientific interests...

407
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,329
- [children shouting]
- ...bigfeets, ghosts,

408
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,688
vampire-bees...

409
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,481
You saw those sting marks,

410
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,608
and you know I eat
a lot of honey now.

411
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,695
Well, as a man of science,
I need proof,

412
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,196
and I just haven't seen...

413
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,657
Proof? Proof?

414
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,158
[door clattering]

415
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,286
How do you need
more proof than this?

416
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,497
Everything I've collected from
my countless battles with Zim,

417
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,083
from my daring travels
into the unknown things

418
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,961
your science has closed its eyes to.

419
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,172
It makes it very difficult
to get to the lawnmower.

420
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,592
That's Tak's ship,
an alien spaceship

421
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,261
I captured from
one of Zim's alien enemies.

422
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,597
Shouldn't spaceships fly?

423
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,849
It will, as soon
as it lets me fix it.

424
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:34,394
- [metal clangs]
- [Tak's ship] Dib, your face is stupid.

425
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,605
[Professor Membrane]
It's a fine, fake spaceship

426
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,023
you've built there, son, but...

427
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,649
Fake? It's not...

428
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,360
Dad, nobody believes me,

429
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,404
so I'm used to defending
our world on my own,

430
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,865
but I wish, just once,

431
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,366
you'd have my back.

432
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,081
Wishing isn't very scientific, son.

433
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,918
[angry grunting]

434
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,383
[insect buzzes]

435
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,512
[hisses]

436
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,432
[Dib] This ends today, Zim!

437
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:16,561
I'm ready for
everything you got!

438
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,729
[door creaks]

I worry about
that boy so much.

You want some nachos?

Uh, no, thank you.

Hey, keep it down out here.

464
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:17,289
I'm trying to be miserable
in my cheesy cocoon of misery.

465

What's going on in here?

466

- What's all this junk?
- [metallic clattering]

467
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,461
Yeah, they're all experiments

468

that I was hoping would be
Phase Two of my plan.

469
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,759
[Dib] Is that supposed to be my dad?

Oh, hello, son!

471
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,888
Yeah.

472
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,764
I figured he could replace

your actual dad.

474
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,436

- It ruined the illusion!
- [bowl clatters]

I don't love pudding.
What's that smell?

[blows raspberry]

[device chirps]

486

[Zim] This is the flight path
of the Irken Armada.

00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,096
And there,

shmillions of light years
away from that path

489
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,144
is Earth.

490
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,855
Do you see what this means, human?

491
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,900
That your leaders only fly
in a straight line?

492
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,361
The Tallest aren't coming!

493
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,698
- So, you really give up?
- [whimpering]

the new Membracelet tomorrow.

The whole world'll be watching.

00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,382
If I could somehow take control
of Dad's keynote stream,

515
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,884
I can expose a real alien, you,

You just might still

What do you say?

525
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,084
[Zim] Fine. I don't care.

00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,719
- [aliens] Aww!
- [Professor Membrane] I didn't want to

1067
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,912
interrupt your lovely, imaginary speech.

1068
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:04,995
Imaginary?

1069
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,541
Well, the last thing
I remember was something

1070
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,959
hitting me on the head

1071
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,962
and starting
this incredible hallucination.

1072
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,965
No, this is all really happening.

1073
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,175
Zim used your bracelets
to teleport the Earth

1074
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,802
to another part
of the universe!

1075
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,136
Do you know how?

1076
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,680
[alien] Uh, he's not gonna know how.

1077
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,200
[Professor Membrane] Son, the Membracelet
is just for running apps

1078
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,602
and world peace,
but, oh, theoretically...

1079
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,272
- [aliens gasp]
- ...one could use it to, say,

1080
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,567
create a galactic star gate of sorts, yes.

1081
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,361
What?

1082
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:39,656
That's crazy, yo.

1083
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,074
[aliens gasp]

1084
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,826
Well, we knew it was possible,

1085
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:46,329
but only with the addition
of a purely theoretical

1086
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:51,251
alien horror blob energized
by a purely theoretical

1087
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,420
- tiny purple space moose.
- [aliens chuckling]

1088
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,880
But all those things don't exist,

1089
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,631
so we didn't worry about it.

1090
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,799
Minimoose!

1091
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,176
Dad, if you had that purple space moose,

1092
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,740
could you use it
to teleport the Earth

1093
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,054
back where it belongs?

1094
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,931
Theoretically, mmm-hmm.

1095
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,933
Too bad we're in prison.

1096
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,604
[Tak's ship whirs and whooshes]

1097
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,606
[Tak's ship]
Three human butts is too many,

1098
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,024
so I brought this.

1099
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,442
Hop in.

1100
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,402
[Professor Membrane] This is all so real!

1101
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,195
- Not a hallucination.
- [Gaz] Shotgun!

1102
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,279

[door hisses]

1104
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,492
- [aliens cheering]
- [alien] See you later!

1105
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,621
Only enough room in there
for you guys, I guess.

1106
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,831
[ship whooshes]

1107
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,750
[aliens] Yay!

1108
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,711
[Tak's ship] Hang on
to your disgusting butts!

1109
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,296
What's with you and butts?

1110
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,633
[screams]

1111
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,804
[laughs maniacally]
Okay, okay.

1112
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,389
Okay, enough running and screaming.

1113
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,891
Let's mix it up a bit.

1114
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,518
Maybe bow down before me or something.

1115
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,104
- [buildings creaking]
- [screams]

1116
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,856
[people scream]

1117
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,400
Hmm, leaping is good.

1118
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,487
[ship whooshes]

1119
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,698
[Professor Membrane]
Well, that was very convincing.

1120
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,867
Because it's real, Dad!

1121
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,787
[Professor Membrane] How could
anything that horrifying be real?

1122
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,456
[Florpus Hole crackling]

1123
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,753

[chuckles]

1125
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,507
Dad, the Earth's minutes away
from being destroyed!

1126
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,841
Why are you laughing?

1127
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,653
[Professor Membrane]
Minimoose is a funny name.

1128
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,928
[Tak's ship grunts]

1129
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,699
[Tak's ship] Normally, I'd say
"Don't touch me,"

1130
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,433
but maybe a little help?

1131
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,732

- [Tak's ship] This isn't good.

1139
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,265
Gaz!

[sips]

1145
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:28,366
I truly believe
I'm falling to a hideous death!

1146
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,785
Hang on, Dad!

1147
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,746
Don't let go!

1148
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,832
[Professor Membrane] Don't worry.
None of this is real.

1149
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:38,626
- I'll prove everything to you.
- [cat meows]

1150
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,420
Just hang on!

1151
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,590
You'll be proud of me!

1152
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,926
[Professor Membrane] Son,
you don't have to prove anything.

1153
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,763
I'm always proud of you.

1154
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,852
Dad!

1155
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,605
[Zim] I did it, GIR.

1156
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:02,776
The humans cower in fear
before my superior Irken might,

1157
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,486
and just in time.

1158
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:06,446

[screams]

1170
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,403
Zim, that moose is the only thing

1171
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,031
that can save Earth
from your Florpus!

1172
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,991
[grunts] Get your own moose, human!

1173
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,785
- This one's mine!
- [squeaks]

1174

[Zim] You're ugly when you lie, Dib!

1180
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,480
[Dib] I'm not lying!

1181
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,566

- No!

[Zim] I liked you better
when you were a chair!

1189
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:58,433
And I liked you better
when you were a toilet!

01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,435
[Professor Membrane]
I'm very confused right now.

1243
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,605
[Zim] So, it has been revealed.

1244
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,775
You've discovered the clone
is not actually

1245
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,403
your real father!

1246
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,199
You told me he wasn't my real father.

1247
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,200
Pudding break over.

1248
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,003
[Professor Membrane]
Oh, this feels so real!

1249
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,287
- We need that moose, Dad!
- [crashes in distance]

1250
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,165
[laughs] Nothing's uglier
than moose jealousy, Dib.

1251
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,584
Ooh, what the... Where did...

1252
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,668
[Tak's ship grunts]

1253
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,047
[Tak's ship] Yours is the worst...

1254
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:02,260
[glitching] butt of them...
butt of them all, Zim.

1255
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,886
Dib!

1256
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,349
Do you still have
that ham I gave you?

1257
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,059
Of course!

1258
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,270
The ham!

1259
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,858
[narrator] <i>See?
There's that ham again.</i>

1260
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:27,994
Ham!

1261
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:29,954
[grunts weakly]

1262
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,500
[Professor Membrane]
Great work, honey, but...

1263
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,793
[squeaks]

1264
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:37,837
Oops.

1265
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,424
Honey, fighting doodn't solve anything.

1266
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,509
Also, I found this little moose thing.

1267
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,136
Look at it. Isn't it funny?

1268
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,053
[squeaks]

1269
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,347
I command you
to return the moose

1270
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,100
and destroy
the Membrane family!

1271
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,437
But... they my family.

1272
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,773
And that guy,

1273
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,484
it's like looking into a mirror.

1274
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:01,003
[Professor Membrane]
Oh, I don't know about...

1275
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,654
[grunts angrily]
I should've known you'd fail me!

1276
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,657
You couldn't even learn
to make pudding the right way.

1277
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:12,038
Hey! You leave Clembrane alone!

1278
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,122
Yeah!

1279
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,750
[in British accent]
It's the best pudding I've ever had

1280
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,794
in my life.

1281
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,891
Excellent. Now, just...

1282
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,643
[grunting]

1283
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,020
- No!
- [squeals]

1284
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:38,356
[Florpus Hole crackling]

1285
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:41,651
[gasps] It's happening!

1286
01:03:41,734 --> 01:03:44,070
Use the moose!

1287
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:46,697
[Professor Membrane] Uh, right.
Use the moose.

1288
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,741
Um, okay.

1289
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:52,370
Everyone, hold hands again.

1290
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,374
[Gaz in normal accent] Yeah!
Your lives depend on it!

1291
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,876
Okay! Hold my hand.

1292
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,128
No way! Be serious!

1293
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:04,465
Now, come on, everyone. Faster!

1294
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,302
I did my best.

1295
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,304
It's no use, Dib.

1296
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:11,597
You've lost.

1297
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:15,726
The Irken Armada is already here.

1298
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,813
Forward cannons now at full power.

1299
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,901
[Professor Membrane] Almost have it.

1300
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,280
Dad, hurry!

1301
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,783
We're entering the Florpus!

1302
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,786
[all screaming]

1303
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,961
[Zim] Zim has won!

1304
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,885
No pressure, Dad,

1305
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,887
but... [screams]

1306
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,558
[Professor Membrane] Cut me some slack!
This is my first moose!

1307
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,143
Relax.

1308
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,704
[in distorted voice]
It's just realities colliding

1309
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,062
like my computer said.

1310
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:03,733
[in distorted voice] And tearing
Earth apart, you moron!

1311
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:06,235
[planet crackles and explodes]

1312
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,363
[all screaming]

1313
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,827
[Professor Membrane] Hmm, um...

1314
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,711
[Professor Membrane] Um, um, uh, eh. Oh.

1315
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,421
[screaming continues]

1316
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,566
[Professor Membrane stammering]
Uh, there...

1317
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,133
[stammers] Oh, no.

1318
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,637
[all barking]

1319
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,516
[grunts and screams]

1320
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:40,770
[Professor Membrane] I've got it!

1321
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:42,313
[Minimoose beeps]

1322
01:05:58,245 --> 01:06:01,290
[all screaming]

1323
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,921
My Tallest, the Earth...

1324
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:08,422
It's gone.

1325
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,092
That's great news.

1326
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:13,886
- Crisis averted.
- Hurray!

1327
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,055
Now we don't have to turn.

1328
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:20,059
[comms officer] Sirs, there's still
the horrifying space hole

1329
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,352
straight ahead.

1330
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,979
[Almighty Tallest Purple]
Why are you so negative?

1331
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,650
[The Tallest] Yay!
Whoo-hoo!

1332
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,014
- [Almighty Tallest Purple] Yeah...
- [electricity buzzes]

1333
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:43,207
[Professor Membrane] Now,
prepare your eating faces

1334
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,793
for incalculable nutrition!

1335
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:48,254
[Foodio 3000 hollers and dings]

1336
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:51,424
Good work, Foodio.

1337
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:53,175
Thank you, Gazlene.

1338
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,470
I hope you can taste
the love simulation I made it with.

1339
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:59,274
- [heavy footsteps approach]
- [Clembrane] Just one final ingwedient.

1340
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:06,147
[laughs] Family and pudding
and science and wobots and stuff.

1341
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:09,525
- So, does he live here now or what?
- [Gaz grunts]

1342
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,402
[Professor Membrane]
I'm still very confused.

1343
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,487
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

1344
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,448
[laughing]

1345
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:20,327
Enjoying your losers' meal,
eh, Dib?

1346
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:23,164
"Losers"? Your plan failed.

1347
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,666
Did it, Dib? Did it?

1348
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,252
What if I told you
my plan all along

1349
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:32,256
was to steal
this whatever-it-is?

1350
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:34,091
Phase Two.
It was Phase Two all along.

1351
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,969
Is that the ceramic clown puppy
from our living room?

1352
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,055
Who's laughing now, Dib?

1353
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:40,973
[laughs maniacally]

1354
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,894
I am, see? [laughing]

1355
01:07:44,977 --> 01:07:46,371
[Professor Membrane] Why didn't you invite

1356
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:49,065
your little green friend
in for dinner, son?

1357
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,775
Dad, that was Zim,

1358
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:53,319
the alien who almost destroyed
the world, remember?

1359
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:56,447
[Professor Membrane]
Son, of course I remember.

1360
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,076
I remember
getting hit on the head

1361
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,953
and dreaming up
all that crazy stuff.

1362
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,370
What?

1363
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,124
What's happening?
Is everything over?

1364
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,835
Yes, GIR, I'm just waiting for The Tallest

1365
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,547
to answer this call so I can
tell them all about my success.

1366
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,175
Did we win?
Did we win?

1367
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,053
Did we win?
Did we win?

1368
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,846
Did we win?
Did we win?

1369

Did we win?
Did we win?

Did we win?
Did we win?

1371

- [inhales]
- [screams] Did we win?

1372
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:33,109
Of course. Zim always wins...

No thanks to you
working with the enemy.

- [Minimoose squeaks]
- Heh, good one, Minimoose.

- I can't stay mad at you.
- [screen buzzes]

1379
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:48,707
Ah, here we go.

1380
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,918
My Tallest,
I am pleased to report

1381
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:55,464
my plan was a success and I now
have Dib's puppy clown thing,

1382
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,716
which was my plan all along.

1383
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,052
Does this please you?

1384
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,764
[both screaming]

1385
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,483
That sounded like a yes to me.

1386
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,485
[explosion]

1387
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,949
Yay! I missed you so much!
