Jack, it's Eddie.

51
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,178
All right, tick
tock, wakey wakey.

52
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,322
- Oh, Eddie, what the
hell are you doing, man?

53
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,858
- What do you mean
what am I doing?

54
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:13,293
It's almost 1:00 PM,
you lazy ass. Get up.

55
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,796
- All right, all right.

56
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:15,763
Give me a break, man. I
was working till 3:00 AM.

57
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:17,464
- Oh really?

58
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,900
Because I heard you were out
with Diane Connell last night.

59
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,333
By the way, she left early

60
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,769
because you were your
usual charming self.

61
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,871
She said you spent most
of your time talking

62
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:25,640
about your usual
Armageddon world theories.

63
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:26,841
Real nice job there, Chief.

64
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:27,642
- How do you even
know about that date?

65
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,242
- Well, she's a
cousin of a friend,

66
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,511
of my girlfriend's
second cousin, stupid.

67
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:31,546
You don't think I know?

68
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,880
- I know you know. You're
something else, man.

69
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:34,549
- Hey, uh, where's your uniform?

70
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:35,750
- I don't know. Why do you care?

71
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,652
- What do you mean
what do I care?

72
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,252
I told you I would pick you up.

73
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,789
Bro, we're playing
Pub Meisters today.

74
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:43,490
- Pub Meisters, is that today?

75
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:44,992
- Do not, do not tell me
you forgot. That's funny.

76
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:46,527
- I didn't forget.
I didn't forget.

77
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:47,595
- Okay.

78
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:48,696
- But I'm not going today,

79
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,764
so good luck getting that
done without me, Champ.

80
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:50,698
- No.

81
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,265
No no no, not today, okay.

82
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,871
Jersey, shoes, pants.

83
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:57,805
Oh my God.

84
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:58,840
- What?

85
00:03:58,873 --> 00:03:59,640
- It's your underwear.

86
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:00,808
- Yeah.

87
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:02,043
- Bro, I can smell
that from here.

88
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,644
I don't even wanna
look at it, Bro.

89
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:05,747
I don't even wanna
look at it, Bro.

90
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,647
Are you, are you kidding me?

91
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,315
- It's stuck.

92
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,784
It's stuck, it's hanging
on a picture now.

93
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,018
- No, it's stuck
all right. Help!

94
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,821
Somebody call the fire
department hazmat team,

95
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:15,857
because nobody
should touch that.

96
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,893
Bro, I gotta wash my hands.
I gotta amputate, Bro.

97
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:20,828
Oh my God, help. 911.

98
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:25,566
Oh, disgusting.

99
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,969
I do not care about
any other game,

100
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,103
but this one you cannot miss.

101
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:31,706
Besides, you're our complete
offense, and last I knew

102
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,440
you need at least one
goal to win a game.

103
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,976
So, you're there.

104
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,944
Also, you better have
another pair of underwater

105
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:37,845
or you're running to the field.

106
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,514
You're not riding in my car.

107
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,650
- All right, all right, I'm
coming, okay. See you out there.

108
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:43,885
- You're dead, no,
you're walking.

109
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:44,952
- Let's go.

110
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,695
Yes!

111
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:02,603
Nice.

112
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,945
Come on, come on,
let's go. Let's go!

113
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,782
- Come on, ref, that was a foul!

114
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:15,683
- Yes, Jack!

115
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,020
Yeah!

116
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,690
- Ref, are you crazy?

117
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:28,996
- What, you kidding me?

118
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,532
Six to nothing,
slaughter rule, baby.

119
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:33,901
Still undefeated. Have a
good weekend, you guys.

120
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:34,902
- See ya.

121
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,871
- Okay, so, what are you
gonna do for Labor Day?

122
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,438
- I don't know yet, man.

123
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,472
- I'm serious, though.

124
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:40,741
If you don't have any
plans, come out to the lake

125
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,076
for the cookout.

126
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,010
We'd be happy to have you.

127
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:43,845
- Yeah.

128
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,478
- You could bring
a date with you.

129
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,681
I don't know if Diane
Connell will really

130
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,015
return your call
ever again, but ...

131
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,116
- You're funny.

132
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,084
Give me a second, yeah?

133
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,319
- Yeah.

134
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:58,491
- Hey, Sofia.

135
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:01,028
- How was the game?

136
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:03,531
- Good, we won. How you been?

137
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,732
- Good.

138
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,802
- Yeah, like okay
good or real good or?

139
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:11,906
Yeah.

140
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,774
Eddie invited me to his
aunt's place at the lake

141
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,710
for Labor Day and, I don't know,

142
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:17,812
you loved his aunt, remember?

143
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,080
Think you wanna go with me?

144
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:20,380
- I don't think so, Jack.

145
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,517
We agreed, remember?

146
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,352
- Yeah.

147
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,053
- Ready?

148
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:27,588
- Yeah.

149
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:28,723
- Good game out there.

150
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,994
- Give me one second, okay?

151
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:38,933
- So you're with that guy now?

152
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,467
- He's just an old friend.

153
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,170
Jack.

154
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,507
I really do hope you
find your happiness.

155
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,209
- Sure.

156
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,543
- Let's get outta here.

157
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,021
- What was that about?

158
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:01,454
- Looks like we're moving on.

159
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,126
- I need a drink.

160
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,029
Whoa whoa, I'm done. I'll
vomit if I have another.

161
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:08,996
- Vomit then. We'll take two.

162
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,131
- You're not listening. Please.

163
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,166
- Please.
- Oh thank you.

164
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,200
- This is a double.

165
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:14,235
- Estrovia.

166
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,503
- What are you doing?

167
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:16,504
What does that mean?

168
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,073
- It means we're moving on.

169
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,007
- What?

170
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,242
- Who gives a shit?

171
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,643
- Estrovia means
who gives a shit?

172
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:24,645
- I mean who gives a shit?

173
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:25,513
- Okay.

174
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:28,516
- That's a smoke show.

175
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,553
Hey, how are we?

176
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,523
Yeah, so my buddy and I, McLovin
down there, we got a bet.

177
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,560
Was that a weird look or
a smile that you gave me?

178
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,928
- You mean like this?

179
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,196
- Yeah, that's the one.

180
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,931
- That's definitely
my weird look.

181
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,498
- That's good because that
would a really weird smile,

182
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,167
if it was.

183
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:48,836
You actually have a
pretty great smile.

184
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:49,704
- Thank you.

185
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,206
- What's your name?

186
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,508
- Sarah, from Chicago.

187
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:55,409
- So how long you here for?

188
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:56,911
- Oh, we're actually
leaving right now.

189
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:57,845
It was nice to meet you.

190
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:58,946
- Oh, yeah. Nice to meet you.

191
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,147
Can I get your number?

192
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:02,950
- Yeah, I don't meet guys at
bars, especially drunk guys.

193
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,051
- You're drunk? I'm not drunk.

194
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:06,587
- Yeah, right, okay. Well
then tell me one thing.

195
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,888
- Hm?

196
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,090
- What's my name?

197
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:10,024
- Your name?

198
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,626
- Mm-hm.

199
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,260
Can't remember?

200
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:14,628
- No, I know it. I know.

201
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,232
- All right, I'll tell you
what, if you can guess my name

202
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,700
then you can go
back to the hotel

203
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:21,635
with me and all
my friends' party.

204
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,671
Can you say hot tub?

205
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,639
- Hot tub, huh?

206
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:30,611
Your name is Chicago Sharon.

207
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,847
Wendy, Janet, Susan?

208
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,183
Oh, let's go with
the hot tub, Sahara.

209
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:39,286
- Yeah, that's it, Sahara.
Where'd you come up with that?

210
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,055
- Oh, you know, like the desert.

211
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:43,324
We have to get moving.
Can I get your number?

212
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,558
- All right, give me your phone.

213
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:45,226
- Yeah?

214
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:47,995
You won't regret it.

215
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,099
- Yeah, I better not.

216
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:53,701
- Text me when the tub is hot.

217
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,569
- Mm-hm.

218
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:56,404
- Okay, see you later.

219
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:59,040
- What's up, Wood?
What's up, Wood?

220
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,175
What's up, Joe? Like that?

221
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,711
- Wow, wow. How'd it go, Romeo?

222
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,179
- You saw the look.

223
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,615
She said she'd text me
when the hot but was warm.

224
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,949
- Which look was
that specifically?

225
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:12,153
- You gotta be kidding
me. When'd she get here?

226
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,320
- When you went outside.

227
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:14,155
- Cool.

228
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:15,089
- Jack, don't.

229
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:16,991
- Hey, Sofe, how are you?

230
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:17,925
- Jack, please,
I'm with friends.

231
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,160
- That's cool.

232
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:21,195
I, I know that you said
no earlier about going

233
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,863
to the lake with me,
but I think you want to

234
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:24,632
and I just wanted
to ask you what time

235
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:25,766
you wanted me to pick you up at.

236
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,334
- Jack, just leave.

237
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:28,636
- Or?

238
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,137
- Everything okay here?

239
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:32,106
- Yeah, everything's okay.
I'm just talking with Sofia.

240
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,874
But I did have a
question for you.

241
00:09:35,276 --> 00:09:38,012
Is it true what they say about
guys who drive Maseratis?

242
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:39,814
- What is that?

243
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,649
- That they lack in other areas.

244
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,652
- You can kiss my ass.

245
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,654
- Well I would hate
to mess up your hair.

246
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:47,822
- Hey, hey, hey!

247
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,025
- Sofia, I just wanna
have a conversation.

248
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:52,626
I just wanna have a
conversation with you!

249
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,795
- Sorry about that.
- Joe, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

250
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,601
- Why did you hang
out with that guy?

251
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,137
- Since star
Eric Douglas got injured,

252
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,207
Georgia just can't seem
to score any goals.

253
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,808
- Come on, O'Brien,
you gotta shoot that yourself.

254
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:09,243
- Any
easier for Georgia.

255
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,912
Their next match day is against
reigning champs Carolina,

256
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:15,783
led by the Davis clan,
legendary coach Harrison Davis,

257
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,719
and his son, his all-star
goalie, Sam Davis.

258
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,087
- Hi, Jack,
this is Sally.

259
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,288
I was just checking
again if you got

260
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:22,389
my message about tonight.

261
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:25,226
It would really mean a lot
to everyone if you came.

262
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,393
Please call me.

263
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,165
- Dammit.

264
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,920
- I can't eat
another bite of this cake.

265
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,455
- Oh, I
think you can try.

266
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,422
- All right, I'll try.

267
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:57,191
- If you put your mind
to it. Look at that.

268
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,692
- Absolutely.
- I know you can do it.

269
00:10:58,726 --> 00:10:59,894
- There you go.

270
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:00,761
- Delicious.

271
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,129
- I asked for
chocolate, but I--

272
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:03,831
- My body says no,
but my mind says yes.

273
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:04,899
- She does that.

274
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,471
- Jack, you made it.

275
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:12,306
I'll open the gate,
meet you out front.

276
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,974
- Great, yeah,
I'll see you there.

277
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,422
- Get outta here.

278
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,424
- Dad, we've got
another surprise.

279
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:33,727
- Sally, please, no
more surprises, please.

280
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:34,461
- She's gone.

281
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:35,396
- Do you know what it is?

282
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,265
- Hey.
- Hey, Sally.

283
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:39,501
- Sorry, am I late?

284
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:40,935
- No no no, of course
not, you're perfect.

285
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,836
Look who I found.

286
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,904
- There he is.

287
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,039
- Wow.

288
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,974
- What's going on, man?
- Hey, Buddy.

289
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,742
- How's it going, man?
- Wow.

290
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:49,944
- Took you long
enough, you good?

291
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,212
- How are you, man?

292
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:53,047
- Good, good. Been a
while, what's up, man?

293
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,448
- How are you? I don't care.

294
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,183
- Hello, Jack.

295
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:57,818
- Father.

296
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,353
- This is my fiancee, Joan.

297
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,387
- Nice to meet you.

298
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:01,922
- Joan. Yeah, you too.

299
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:03,958
- You must be so
hungry after that long ride.

300
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:04,892
Do you want some cake?

301
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,360
- I'm good.

302
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,028
You know, I'll actually do some
coffee if you guys have it.

303
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,030
- So, Dad, Joan been
taking you to these

304
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,265
breath work classes
or something?

305
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,866
You blew those candles
out like a champ.

306
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,536
- Thank you, yes.

307
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,071
I did do a good job, if
I must say so myself.

308
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,305
- Oh yeah.

309
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:19,940
- Care to let us know
what you wished for?

310
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:21,408
- Well, you know
I can't do that,

311
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:24,245
but I bet you can all
guess what it was.

312
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,514
- Would it have anything to do

313
00:12:26,548 --> 00:12:28,816
with a record fifth
championship trophy?

314
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,050
Maybe.

315
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:31,185
- That means another one
for you if it happens.

316
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,953
- A chip off the
old block, right?

317
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:36,357
- Oh that's right, Sam,
congratulations, MVP.

318
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,224
- Thank you, thank you.

319
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,428
First unanimous ever,
which is pretty good,

320
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:43,030
if I may say so myself.

321
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,568
I got the good
genes, right, Sis?

322
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:48,936
- You know, let's face it.
We should all be grateful.

323
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,939
It's been a really good year
for this family, for the team.

324
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:52,973
Sam.

325
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,876
I was on the phone with
the governor yesterday,

326
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,211
and he wants you, Sally, to fill

327
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,246
the vacancy of
Representative Hillest.

328
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,347
- Oh my God, Dad.

329
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:02,349
- Congratulations.

330
00:13:02,383 --> 00:13:03,984
- Thank you!

331
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:05,185
- Congrats.

332
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:06,487
- Oh my God.
I've gotta call Raymond.

333
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,322
- Yeah, yeah.
- I'll be right back.

334
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:14,061
- Well, it's getting
a little late for me.

335
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:16,964
- Everybody, I've
gotta get going.

336
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,866
Little Billy isn't feeling well.

337
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:19,967
- Aw.

338
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,169
- Sounds like Daddy just
fed him too much ice cream.

339
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,003
Happy birthday.

340
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:24,872
- It
was quite a night.

341
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,040
- I am so excited about
the governor's appointment.

342
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:27,041
- Yes.
- Thank you.

343
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,543
- Of course, Babe.

344
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:31,945
- Goodbye, Sweetie. It
was great seeing you.

345
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,080
I've got a work-related
case in Atlanta.

346
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,382
I'm gonna call you. We're
gonna get together, okay?

347
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,017
- Sounds great. It
was nice seeing you.

348
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,252
And congrats again.

349
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,254
- I think I'm gonna hit
the road too, follow you out.

350
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,122
Dad, happy birthday.

351
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:43,223
- Thanks, Paul.

352
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,125
- I'll see you at
the game in Atlanta, right?

353
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:45,959
- Sure.

354
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,361
- Hey, Joan,
thank you again.

355
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,029
- You know what,
I'll walk you out.

356
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,398
It was really nice meeting
you. See you tomorrow?

357
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:52,232
- Night.

358
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,434
- Great.

359
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,969
Oh, Sam, can you help
me with something?

360
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:58,573
- With what?

361
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:17,559
- Come on inside. I
wanna show you something.

362
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,127
Take a seat.

363
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,231
It's good to see you, Jack.

364
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:27,000
Look, I know how difficult
things have been for you.

365
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:30,505
I want you to have this.
I found it in the safe.

366
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,875
I think Mom would
want you to have this.

367
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,044
- Thanks.

368
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,078
- Jack, I'd like to say that--

369
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,581
- Did you see the Georgia
game the other day?

370
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,150
- Yeah. Not much of a game, huh?

371
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,418
- Yeah, Georgia looks
like they're gonna be

372
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,286
in big trouble after
they lost Eric Douglas.

373
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,122
- I doubt they can
win without him.

374
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:49,022
Look, I'd like to talk
to you about something.

375
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,291
- Not now, please.

376
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:54,562
Maybe we can just say that
I came over to see my family

377
00:14:54,596 --> 00:14:56,330
and it happened to
be your birthday.

378
00:14:57,364 --> 00:14:59,567
- May I ask you one question?

379
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,434
- Sure.

380
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,070
- Are you happy?

381
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:06,273
- Am I happy?

382
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:11,646
What do you care? Think
it's a little late for that?

383
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,113
- That's not fair.

384
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:15,182
- Sure it is. Why are we
always pretending, huh?

385
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,316
The truth hurts, doesn't it,

386
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,184
Mr. Always Tell It Like It Is?

387
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,086
- All right, look,
just hear me out.

388
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,121
I told you that you and I
would be able to move on

389
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:23,323
once you worked on your
temper, your anger.

390
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:26,193
If you can honestly
tell me that you have,

391
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,696
then I think we should
move on to the next step.

392
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,164
Are you doing any better?

393
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,132
- Probably not much.

394
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,434
- Still taking your meds?

395
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,703
- No.

396
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:37,438
Everything they've recommended

397
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,574
makes it worse, actually.

398
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:44,011
- Sorry to hear that.

399
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,212
- Mm.

400
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,213
- You know, you could
pick up the phone,

401
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:47,582
maybe call, talk
once in a while.

402
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,521
- You know the night that
Mom died, I made a promise

403
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:55,757
to her that I would talk to you

404
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,725
and I would tell you
how I really felt?

405
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,993
I made that promise
about three years ago.

406
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:02,162
- What would you have said?

407
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:06,099
- How come you never
believed in me?

408
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,301
- What?

409
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,504
- You knew that it was my dream
always just to play soccer.

410
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:11,673
You know, play for
you. Father and son.

411
00:16:11,706 --> 00:16:13,708
But then you would tell me
to aim for smaller schools

412
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,342
because you knew that
I wasn't good enough

413
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,412
to play Division One,
definitely not in the pros.

414
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,414
But I ended up on your team,
and you cut me in front

415
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,049
of the whole world
without giving me a chance

416
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,585
to prove myself, and
then you tell a reporter

417
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:25,486
that you knew Sam had
the stuff of champions.

418
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,120
You know what that's like?

419
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,690
That's like going, Hey,
world, the great and powerful

420
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:30,424
Harrison Davis believes
that his youngest son

421
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,226
isn't worth a goddam thing.

422
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:34,562
- I swore I'd never
tell you this.

423
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:38,065
No Division One
school wanted you.

424
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:44,338
I drafted you onto my team
because nobody else would.

425
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,305
I never meant to tell you,

426
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,207
but you asked, so there it is.

427
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,743
- There it is, I'm a favor?

428
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,310
You never even gave me a chance.

429
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,245
- I did give you a chance.

430
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:52,412
- You knew that it was my dream.

431
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:54,181
Bullshit, two exhibition
games, with half the real team

432
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:58,118
playing, that meant
nothing, you know that.

433
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,554
You won't say it, will you?

434
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:02,422
Come on, Dad.

435
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,760
Come on. Tell it
like it is, right?

436
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,362
You never thought that I
was good enough, did you?

437
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,532
- The team didn't think
you were a fit for them.

438
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:12,567
It was becoming a problem
I couldn't ignore.

439
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,536
- A problem you couldn't ignore?

440
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,537
- I didn't mean it like that.

441
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,470
- The hell you didn't.

442
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,407
That's what
you think of me.

443
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,110
Your loser son Jack, rough
around the edges, dropout,

444
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,646
didn't inherit his father's
hall-of-fame talent.

445
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:25,580
- That's not true.

446
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:27,682
- I knew I shouldn't
have come here.

447
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:29,483
- Jack, don't go, please.

448
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:31,385
- You know, I can't wait to
get outta here. You know why?

449
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,387
Because as soon as I cross
into the great state of Georgia

450
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,789
I get to take a
nice, big breath.

451
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:36,390
- What good'll it
to you to leave now?

452
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,559
We can talk about this.

453
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:39,493
I don't want things
to go on like this.

454
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:41,228
- Well, you probably
shoulda thought about that

455
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:41,863
a long time ago, uh?

456
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,798
- Jack. Dammit!

457
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,592
- Yes, ladies and
gentlemen, this is it.

458
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,760
For the championship, Jack
Davis trying to do something

459
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:15,295
that he'll never be
able to do, score a goal

460
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:18,432
on his older brother and
future hall-of-fame goalie,

461
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:19,634
Sam Davis.

462
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,502
- Come on, boys, dinnertime!

463
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:22,904
Right now, it's gonna get cold.

464
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:24,639
- Just a second, Mom.
We'll be right there.

465
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:26,741
- Don't give me that we'll
be right there, Mom, stuff.

466
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:29,309
- But, Mom, this is for
the world championship.

467
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:30,812
- Yeah.

468
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:36,116
- Okay, since it's for
the world championship.

469
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:39,787
- You'll never get one past me.

470
00:18:46,828 --> 00:18:49,931
- Remember, Jack, visualize.

471
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:51,298
Visualize.

472
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:58,205
- This is it, soccer
fans, for all or nothing.

473
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:00,742
Here we go.

474
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,579
What a save! Let's go!

475
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:07,515
Not in my house,
not in my house!

476
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:09,751
Never in my house. Let's go!

477
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,269
- Leave! I have a gun!

478
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:13,313
I have a gun, and I've
called the police!

479
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,883
- When'd you get
a gun? It's me, Jack.

480
00:20:15,917 --> 00:20:19,520
- Oh my God. Jack, you
scared the shit outta me.

481
00:20:19,554 --> 00:20:21,488
And I don't care drunk you
are, you have to leave now.

482
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:22,890
- Were you actually
gonna shoot me?

483
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:24,959
- No, idiot, I was
threatening to shoot a burglar

484
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:26,527
until I found out it was you.

485
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:27,461
Now leave.

486
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:28,730
- No, I haven't been drinking.

487
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:30,598
Okay, I just came from
my family dinner and,

488
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:31,532
I did what you
always told me to do.

489
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:33,467
I told my dad how I felt.

490
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:35,536
- You spoke with your father?

491
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,739
- Big surprise,
it didn't go well.

492
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:39,473
- You can't just show
up here like this.

493
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:40,908
- I know, I know. I'm sorry.

494
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:42,944
I just, I had
nowhere else to go.

495
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,514
- You know what?

496
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:47,849
You can stay on
the couch tonight.

497
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:50,785
- Thanks, okay, I didn't
know who else to turn to.

498
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:53,353
Eddie's great, but not
with this sort of thing.

499
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:53,988
- I understand.

500
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:04,699
- You know, it actually felt
pretty good, telling him.

501
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,502
Does that sound strange?

502
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:10,037
- No, not at all. What'd he say?

503
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:11,005
- Mostly the same.

504
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:14,509
Except he admitted that
he had no faith in me,

505
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:16,376
and then he blamed
it on the team.

506
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:17,612
That's about when I left.

507
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,847
- Good for you.
I'm proud of you.

508
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:21,849
It took guts to do what you did.

509
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:24,018
And I'm sure you'll sort
it out in the morning.

510
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:25,385
- Yeah.

511
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,486
- I'll get you some blankets.

512
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:27,989
- Thanks.

513
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:30,525
You know, I'm probably good
with this one right here.

514
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:42,870
Oh.

515
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:45,573
And, sorry I surprised
you like this.

516
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:48,341
- No need to apologize. We'll
talk in the morning, okay?

517
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,844
- Yeah.

518
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:52,880
You know, I've always been
jealous of you and your family?

519
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:55,482
Three brothers, two
sisters, a mom and dad and,

520
00:21:57,018 --> 00:21:58,886
I don't think I ever
saw anyone do anything

521
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,823
bad to each other or do anything
but love each other really.

522
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:03,524
How real was that?

523
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:04,759
- It was very real.

524
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,627
I know it's unusual,
but even as kids,

525
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,896
we were all for one
and one for all.

526
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,965
Our parents really
instilled in us

527
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,499
that family was everything.

528
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,102
We had so little, but
we really had so much.

529
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:17,505
I was very lucky.

530
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:20,007
- Wow.

531
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,044
Yeah, my family, we competed
for pretty much everything.

532
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:26,013
And not only the attention
of Dad but also with every

533
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:28,983
stranger who wanted a piece
of him and his fame too.

534
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:32,019
We just had to look
out for ourselves.

535
00:22:32,053 --> 00:22:33,554
I guess that's way
different than you.

536
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:36,123
Seems like we had so much
but really so little.

537
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:38,092
- I know.

538
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:41,461
Good night.

539
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:45,733
- Night.

540
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,609
- Jack, come on.
It's time to wake up.

541
00:22:57,144 --> 00:22:58,880
- What time is it?

542
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:01,048
- It's time for you
to go to school.

543
00:23:01,082 --> 00:23:02,049
- What?

544
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,017
- You heard me.

545
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,185
You always promised to
check out my school,

546
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:05,052
but you never did.

547
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:08,055
Well, I decided that
today is the day.

548
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:09,924
- As much as I'd like
to, I think I have

549
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,893
a temperature today,
Miss Portales.

550
00:23:11,926 --> 00:23:12,827
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, very funny.

551
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,028
- Isn't today Labor Day?

552
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,163
- There might not be classes,
but there's still rehearsals

553
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:18,933
for the performance at the
fall assembly this week.

554
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,169
- Was your friend
around last night?

555
00:23:22,203 --> 00:23:23,137
- Just get dressed.

556
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:27,742
- Yes, ma'am.

557
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:32,079
- The Thai Bar, I haven't
been here in a minute.

558
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,080
- You want coffee?

559
00:23:33,114 --> 00:23:34,447
- No, I'm good, thanks.

560
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,449
You know what,
actually I'll for a

561
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:38,986
caramel macchiatto?

562
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,822
- Whipped cream and
an extra shot still?

563
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:43,124
- Is there another way?

564
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:45,126
- Guess not.
All right, I'll be back.

565
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:46,459
- Thanks, Sofe.

566
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:00,808
- Okay.

567
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:03,476
And here you go.

568
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:04,612
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

569
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,479
- You got a call from someone.

570
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:10,518
- I'll call him back later.

571
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,421
Ah, I love this song.

572
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:15,890
You know, I haven't given up.

573
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:19,560
- Really? I haven't either.

574
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:20,828
You know, I was actually
just thinking about this

575
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:23,097
that I think we're both
in a much better place--

576
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,634
- No, Silly, on my music.

577
00:24:27,802 --> 00:24:30,705
I just completed
my very first demo.

578
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:31,572
- That's great.

579
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:33,674
Can I hear it?

580
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:34,508
- No.

581
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:35,576
- What do you mean no?

582
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,544
- You might not like it.

583
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:37,411
- What are you talking about?

584
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:38,879
I've always liked
what you've done.

585
00:24:38,913 --> 00:24:40,081
Come on, email the
file to me, Sofe.

586
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:42,249
- No, they haven't even
finished mixing it.

587
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:45,086
They'll hopefully finish mixing,
they said, next week, so.

588
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,821
- Oh yeah, they'll
mix it next week?

589
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:47,888
Don't lie to me.

590
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:49,123
- I'm not lying to you.

591
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,558
- You are lying to me.
You always do that.

592
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:51,625
You blink like that
when you're lying.

593
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,027
- I do not blink.

594
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,562
- You do blink.

595
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:56,530
- With
the morning sports.

596
00:24:56,564 --> 00:24:58,566
The word is, Coach Briana
Scurry of the Georgia Wild

597
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,268
soccer team could be fired
if the team doesn't win

598
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:03,004
one of the two remaining games--

599
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:05,606
- It's a bummer because
she's a great coach.

600
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:08,275
You know, she used to be
an assistant for my dad.

601
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:10,544
- Wait wait wait, you
know Coach Scurry?

602
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:13,214
- A bit, yeah.

603
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,783
- Well why don't you talk
to her, get a tryout?

604
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:16,851
I mean, you heard
what they said.

605
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:17,985
They desperately need a striker.

606
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,320
- For the Wild?

607
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,089
- You're a striker, right?

608
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:24,759
- Yeah, but in a podunk
industrial league. It's nuts.

609
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:27,028
- Come on, I bet you're
better than that old guy

610
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:28,562
who's way past his prime.

611
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:29,964
- Sofe, look, nobody will
even give me a tryout

612
00:25:29,997 --> 00:25:31,198
after what my dad did to me.

613
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:33,200
Okay, Coach Scurry will
just think I'm crazy.

614
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:35,169
- You haven't changed, one bit.

615
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,370
- No, I have changed.

616
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:38,172
I just, I don't wanna put the
coach in a awkward position.

617
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,807
Okay, especially after
knowing my father for so long.

618
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,943
- Why don't you think you could
play great for Coach Scurry?

619
00:25:42,977 --> 00:25:45,179
When will you stop
worrying about what

620
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:46,647
other people think about you

621
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,282
or the expectations
they have of you?

622
00:25:48,315 --> 00:25:49,417
Especially your family.

623
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,685
It's the same argument we
have over and over again,

624
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:53,054
Jack, and I'm tired of it.

625
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:54,688
- You too, Sofe, huh?

626
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:57,625
- That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

627
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:59,627
Quit playing the
victim all the time.

628
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,729
It got super tiring
when we were together,

629
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,898
and it's still real old now.

630
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:19,146
- Good morning, everyone.

631
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,315
- Good
morning, Miss Portales!

632
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:24,118
- Everyone, this
is my friend Jack.

633
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:26,787
Jack, whenever we have a new
guest, we like to introduce

634
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:29,757
ourselves in our own
very special way.

635
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,724

636
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,626

really? Is this the '90s?

dinner? I can't today.

685
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:24,338
- That's none of your business.

686
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:27,908
- Hey.
- Hello, hey.

687
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:30,512
- No, I'm not running late.

688
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:33,347
I told you, it's not
fair to ask me that.

689
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,915
I'm here.

690
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:36,417
Okay, bye.

691
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,452
- Hey, I just wanted to
say thanks, for everything.

692
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:40,421
Thanks for letting
me stay last night.

693
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:43,324
- You're welcome. It'll
all work out, believe me.

694
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:46,126
I'm glad you finally said
something to your father.

695
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,994
- Yeah.

696
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,863
I'll see you.

697
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:54,735
Hey, Sofe. Let me buy
you lunch sometime, huh?

698
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,006
- Could you handle
us being just friends?

699
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,144
I'll make you a deal.

700
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:05,779
- Yeah, what's that?

701
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:08,315
- If you go see Coach
Scurry and ask for a tryout,

702
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,151
I'll buy you dinner
at O'Nesta's.

703
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:14,855
- O'Nesta's, that's our
spot. Are you being serious?

704
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:17,024
- Do I look like
I'm bullshitting?

705
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:18,859
- All right, you
throw in your demo

706
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:19,994
and you got yourself a deal.

707
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:23,030
- No no, no no no, I told
you. It's being worked on.

708
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,164
- I'll think about it.

709
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,403
- So, are
you mad at Sally?

710
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:30,804
- Why
would I be mad at her?

711
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:32,373
- For inviting Jack
without talking to you.

712
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:35,543
- Oh, she was just
trying to help.

713
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:36,377
I love her for that.

714
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,244
- Hm.

715
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:41,215
- I talked to Paul
a little while ago.

716
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,550
He says Jack's doing fine.

717
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:44,084
He's gonna have dinner
with him in Atlanta

718
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,320
when the team's
playing next week.

719
00:29:46,353 --> 00:29:47,888
- I wish I could help more.

720
00:29:48,623 --> 00:29:50,190
- I wouldn't recommend that.

721
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:52,059
Jack was pretty
close to his mom,

722
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:54,161
probably closer than
all the other kids.

723
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:55,996
- What about you?

724
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,033
- Oh, we got along
great when he was a kid.

725
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:02,269
Then when his mom got
sick, he just got angry.

726
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:05,540
Mostly at me, I think.

727
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:07,174
- What about the other kids?

728
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:11,478
- Well they were all
affected in their own way,

729
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:13,213
but not like Jack.

730
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:17,184
Unlike Sam and Sally, Jack
just bottled it all up inside.

731
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:19,119
- And Paul?

732
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,459
- Well, Paul, he was some kid.

733
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:28,228
He just took it all in stride,
even tried to help Jack.

734
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:31,131
Sam and Sally, they're A types.

735
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,535
Sam was actually
pretty hard on Jack.

736
00:30:33,568 --> 00:30:35,102
And then finally
Jack figured out

737
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:36,437
his mom was not gonna make it.

738
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:39,507
It got really bad.

739
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:43,210
Add to that the fact
that he couldn't get

740
00:30:43,243 --> 00:30:45,613
past the practice
squad on my team.

741
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:48,148
I guess that just proved
to be too much for him.

742
00:30:49,584 --> 00:30:51,952
- Well, looking back,
do you think you could

743
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:53,253
have kept him on the team?

744
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:55,122
- It was the toughest
decision I ever made.

745
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:56,256
But my father told me

746
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:59,093
that when you're making
decisions, especially about

747
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:02,162
the players, the
team comes first,

748
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,198
no matter what the emotions are.

749
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:07,468
- Oh, honey, that musta
been really difficult.

750
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:13,874
So, are you gonna call Jack?

751
00:31:15,376 --> 00:31:18,245
- Oh, I guess I'll give it
a couple of days.

752
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:20,481
I'll call him after he
has dinner with Paul.

753
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:22,483
- Good plan.

754
00:31:28,623 --> 00:31:30,457
- Reigning
champions Carolina cruising

755
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:34,194
four goals up late as Georgia,
looking to get on the board.

756
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:36,564
Nelson strikes, easy
save for Sam Davis.

757
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:38,031
- Nice hands, nice hands.

758
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:40,568
- Oh, typical Davis.

759
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:43,303
Look at him taunting
the Georgia crowd.

760
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:46,306
- Some may call this
confidence; others arrogant.

761
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,341
- Come on, boo!

762
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:50,944
Look at him, man. My brother's
such a freaking hotdog.

763
00:31:50,978 --> 00:31:51,979
They're up by five goals
and you woulda thought

764
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:53,180
he just won the game.

765
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:55,517
- It's funny because I kinda
hear like a little jealousy.

766
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,518
- No.

767
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:58,185
- Like a tiny baby.

768
00:31:58,218 --> 00:31:59,319
You know for a hotdog,
he's kinda good.

769
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:01,455
Musta been pretty
hard trying to follow

770
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:02,557
in his footsteps, huh?

771
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:05,426
- Yeah, you don't wanna know.

772
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:09,430
- Did your dad ever talk to
you about playing for him?

773
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:11,031
- Want another beer, Eddie?

774
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,233
You're good?

775
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,067
- I'm good.

776
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,436
- Yeah, me too.

777
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:17,438
- It's crazy, you know.

778
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:20,441
Your brother is
Sam Fricking Davis,

779
00:32:20,474 --> 00:32:22,610
and your dad is Harrison
Davis, you know,

780
00:32:22,644 --> 00:32:24,344
and you been keeping
this on the DL?

781
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:25,613
- Yeah.

782
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:26,548
Yeah, no, thanks for
not talking about it

783
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:28,215
around a big group of fans.

784
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:31,018
- Did you guys
know that this ...

785
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:33,688
- Yeah, I'm gonna head
out. I'm gonna head out.

786
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:36,524
I'm meeting up with
Paul for dinner tonight,

787
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:38,358
and I'm putting
in a shift later.

788
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:40,060
This game's a blowout.
I'll hit you later, yeah?

789
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:41,328
- All right.

790
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,297
- Thanks again for
the tickets, man.

791
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,364
- Anytime.

792
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,334
Aw, come on!

793
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:59,313
- Oh, I'm not on duty.

794
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:00,648
- Hey, are you available?

795
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:03,317
- No, I'm sorry, I'm off
duty. Sorry about that.

796
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,385
Yep, get the door.

797
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,191
- Hey.
- Jack.

798
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:12,025
- How are you?

799
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,126
- Good, good to see ya.

800
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,061
- Good to see you.

801
00:33:14,094 --> 00:33:15,095
- You see Dad? He just left.

802
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:16,230
- Why is he here?

803
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:17,732
- The whole team's staying here.

804
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:19,433
- Can we go somewhere else then?

805
00:33:19,466 --> 00:33:20,267
- No.

806
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,468
- No, seriously, if
they're all here,

807
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:22,402
I don't wanna eat here.

808
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:23,805
- Come on, sit. Don't
worry, it'll be fine.

809
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,640
Sit, sit, sit. You end
up going to the game?

810
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:27,107
- Yeah.

811
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,275
- So why didn't you
use the ticket I left?

812
00:33:28,308 --> 00:33:29,544
- Because I went
with my friend Eddie.

813
00:33:29,577 --> 00:33:30,578
He's got season tickets.

814
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:32,279
- Sir?

815
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:33,447
- Hey, could I get a club
soda with lime, please?

816
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,516
- Oh, come on, I'm
leaving in the morning.

817
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:35,449
- I know.

818
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:36,416
- Be right back.

819
00:33:37,284 --> 00:33:39,052
- So let's have a
good time tonight.

820
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:40,220
- Well I gotta get up
early. I got bills to pay.

821
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:41,455
- Okay, well,
don't give me that.

822
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:43,223
Do you know how much money is
in that trust fund of yours?

823
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:44,491
- I don't care.

824
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:45,560
- You know Dad told
me he's letting you

825
00:33:45,593 --> 00:33:46,761
have access to some of it now?

826
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:49,396
- It's cool, but I
don't want any of it.

827
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:50,230
- Okay, what are
you talking about?

828
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:51,265
- You know the guy.

829
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:52,734
If I take something,
then I owe him something.

830
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:53,735
I'm not gonna owe
that guy anything.

831
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,168
- Okay, that's not the case.

832
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:56,370
You're not gonna
owe him anything.

833
00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:57,572
What, you'd rather
drive a taxi? Come on.

834
00:33:57,605 --> 00:33:58,773
- No, I don't
wanna drive a taxi,

835
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:01,074
but I have to do it to pay rent.

836
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:02,844
- You have always been one
of the most stubborn people

837
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:05,078
that I know, you know that?

838
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:06,246
- Thanks.

839
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,447
- Yeah, you're
welcome. Thank you.

840
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:08,415
- You're welcome.

841
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:10,585
- Oh God.

842
00:34:10,618 --> 00:34:11,418
- What?

843
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:13,287
- The self-anointed
king has arrived.

844
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,422
- Hey, here we go.
Hey, good to see ya.

845
00:34:15,455 --> 00:34:17,592
- Dude, this is exactly why I
didn't wanna sit down and eat.

846
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:18,560
- Just take it easy.

847
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:20,360
There's nothing we can
do at this point, okay.

848
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:22,564
- I don't get it, man.

849
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:24,264
What, one doesn't
satisfy him anymore?

850
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:25,700
- No, he needs at least
three to satisfy that ego.

851
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,301
- I'll be damned.

852
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,804
Ladies, it's my two
brothers, Humpty and Dumpty,

853
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:32,239
sitting all by themselves.

854
00:34:32,272 --> 00:34:35,442
This is Tawny, Patty and ...

855
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:36,376
- Bridget.

856
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,111
- Bridget, is her name.

857
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:40,180
- Yeah, that's real classy, Sam.

858
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:41,549
- What are you doing here, Jack?

859
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,317
- I live here, Sam.

860
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,484
- Oh, that's right.

861
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,353
You know, I was kinda hoping
maybe you would take us all

862
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:47,622
on a ride in that Ferrari
you been driving around.

863
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:48,523
- He has a Ferrari?

864
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:49,891
- No, he doesn't.

865
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:53,661
He just likes driving real
fast, don't you, Buddy?

866
00:34:53,695 --> 00:34:57,497
I will see you all later.
Hopefully much later!

867
00:34:58,398 --> 00:34:59,801
- Good one.

868
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:04,839
- Woo.

869
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:06,306
- How does he not bother you?

870
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,208
- I never said he
doesn't bother me.

871
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:09,677
Okay, it's just nothing
compared to you.

872
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:10,912
- Why?

873
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:12,412
- Because you feed into
his always hungry ego

874
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:13,347
by letting him know
that he gets to you.

875
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,782
- It's because I can't help it.

876
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,483
- You kinda can.

877
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:19,554
Also, take into account that
I am the brain of the family,

878
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:20,788
with no athletic ability,

879
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:23,156
so I'm not the one
competing with him.

880
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,892
- I just think if I look
back at it, there's probably

881
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:26,561
some stuff that I
woulda done differently.

882
00:35:26,594 --> 00:35:27,494
- Like what?

883
00:35:27,528 --> 00:35:29,296
- Stood up for myself.

884
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:30,531
Even knowing that he
probably woulda beat

885
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:32,265
the living shit
outta me, I just,

886
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,568
I think it would made a
big difference, you know?

887
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:34,769
- Is it too late now?

888
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:36,403
- I'll take a swing
if you'll back me up.

889
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:38,573
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

890
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:41,241
- You moron, that's a club soda.

891
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:42,744
- I was gonna say,
that's a club.

892
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:44,946
You know, with his
tolerance, he'll have a buzz.

893
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:46,648
Oh God.

894
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:51,485
You remember what Sam
would always tell me

895
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,720
when we were kids?

896
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:53,721
- No, what?

897
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:55,757
- That there was no way
that I could be a Davis,

898
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,326
because I didn't have one
iota of athletic ability,

899
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,595
like the two of you guys do.

900
00:36:00,628 --> 00:36:02,362
I was probably the son
of that weird mailman

901
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:03,798
we used to have, remember him?

902
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:04,766
- The guy with the big calves?

903
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:06,634
- The big calves, that
guy Craig or something.

904
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:07,902
- Yeah yeah yeah, Craig.

905
00:36:07,935 --> 00:36:09,804
That's funny, though, I
actually agree with Sam

906
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:12,439
because you guys have the
exact same noses.

907
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,743
- Oh, okay, now
he's a funny guy.

908
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:18,245
- No, I'm just playing, but
they were pretty similar.

909
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:24,652
You know, sometimes I like to
imagine that Mom's somewhere

910
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:26,754
listening to us
and laughing along.

911
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,691
- You got that right.

912
00:36:34,762 --> 00:36:37,230
- All right, don't
forget your basics.

913
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:38,800
Two touch, let's go back.

914
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,233
- Two or one, Eddie?

915
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:43,571
- Two. Hey, hey, the
cones, the cones.

916
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:45,606
- I'll hand this
one to you, Eddie.

917
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:48,743
Okay, yeah, and on that note,
that's enough for today.

918
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:50,477
Yeah, that's enough.

919
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:54,247
All right, okay. Hey,
good work today, you guys.

920
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:56,884
- We, we're headed to the bar?

921
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:58,485
- Oh please.

922
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:00,722
Please.

923
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:02,890
Hey, I'll see you
guys at the bar.

924
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:03,925
- Yeah.
- We'll see you, man.

925
00:37:04,926 --> 00:37:06,728
- Drinks on this guy.

926
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:13,835
- Look at
that, our spot's open.

927
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:15,536
- Bada bing.

928
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,773
Wait, the Wild are switching
Wayne Fuller to a striker.

929
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:19,607
- Fuller?

930
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,274
- Bro, this is not good.

931
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:22,810
- Wayne Fuller?

932
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:24,846
- My grandmother can play
better offense. Is it bad?

933
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:27,548
Okay, I need a refund on my
season tickets. Help, help.

934
00:37:27,582 --> 00:37:29,617
- I don't blame you. Sounds
like they're desperate.

935
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,753
- Oh man.

936
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:32,587
Refund.

937
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,788
- Hey, what time is it?

938
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:34,789
- It is time for
you to get a watch.

939
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:36,323
- No, seriously.

940
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:37,592
- It's 4:30.

941
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:40,460
- Yeah, I gotta go somewhere.

942
00:37:40,494 --> 00:37:41,929
- Where you gotta go?

943
00:37:41,963 --> 00:37:43,030
- Yeah, I'll be back for happy
hour. I'll tell you later.

944
00:37:43,064 --> 00:37:43,998
- Who is she?

945
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:44,832
- I gotta go.

946
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:46,968
- Okay, I'm out,
I'm out. Good luck.

947
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:48,636
- I'll see you in a bit, dude.

948
00:37:48,669 --> 00:37:49,504
- See ya, Buddy.

949
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:11,959
- Come on.

950
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:16,664
Come on now. No, no.

951
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,343
- Welcome back.

952
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:31,913
I hope you don't mind
if I do something

953
00:38:31,946 --> 00:38:35,382
a bit different today,
introduce you to someone.

954
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:39,020
Remember this name,
Sofia Portales.

955
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:42,089
I've received many demos over
the years and rarely play one,

956
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:44,892
but I think this is
something very special.

957
00:38:44,926 --> 00:38:48,963

Please.

Thanks.

983
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:15,042
- Can I help you?

984
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:16,711
- Yeah, I need to
see Coach Scurry.

985
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:17,578
- We close at five.

986
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:18,913
- Is she in there?

987
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:20,681
- Do you have an appointment?

988
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:22,149
- No.

989
00:41:22,183 --> 00:41:23,284
- Well, I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to have an appointment.

990
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:25,920
- Please, this is
really important.

991
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:27,121
- What's your name?

992
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,223
- Jack Davis. Coach
Scurry already knows me.

993
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:31,092
- Louise, I have
a Jack David here.

994
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,259
- Davis.

995
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:33,294
- Jack Davis?
- Sorry, Jack Davis.

996
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,261
- Jack Davis.

997
00:41:34,295 --> 00:41:35,563
- Who is he?

998
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:40,634
- Mr. Davis, you're gonna
have to make an appointment.

999
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:42,903
- Yeah, okay, well,
when can I see her then?

1000
00:41:42,937 --> 00:41:44,271
- It'll be have to be
sometime next week.

1001
00:41:44,305 --> 00:41:45,573
- I don't have until next week.

1002
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:46,640
Okay, just tell Coach Scurry

1003
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:47,775
that I found her
missing striker.

1004
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:49,310
- What did you say?

1005
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:50,611
- Yeah, let her know I found
the striker that you need.

1006
00:41:50,644 --> 00:41:52,113
Okay, I'm serious,
it'll be worth it.

1007
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:55,549
- Okay. Be right back.

1008
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:03,557
Good news, coach Scurry
will see you now.

1009
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:04,658
- Oh, thanks. Hey.

1010
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:07,762
- Hey, Jack, it's been so
long. It's good to see you.

1011
00:42:07,795 --> 00:42:08,963
- Good to see you too, Coach.

1012
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:10,664
- So, how's the family?

1013
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:12,666
I see your dad and Sam
when we play each other,

1014
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,602
but we don't really
get a chance to talk.

1015
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:16,937
- Family's, uh, doing well.

1016
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:18,672
- Great, glad to hear it.

1017
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:20,608
So what's this about
finding the striker

1018
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:21,776
the whole world knows we need?

1019
00:42:21,809 --> 00:42:23,611
- Yeah, I know you're really
busy, but just hear me out

1020
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:26,013
before you toss me
outta here, okay?

1021
00:42:26,047 --> 00:42:28,215
- Does your dad even know
you're here trying to help me?

1022
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:30,017
They beat the crap
out of us last week.

1023
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:33,254
- Yeah, he doesn't need
to know about this.

1024
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:36,223
Okay, I know that
this can sound crazy,

1025
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:38,359
but I can be the striker
that you're looking for.

1026
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,894
I know it.

1027
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:42,329
- You can be the striker? You?

1028
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:46,600
- Yes, Coach, me.

1029
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:47,802
- Jack, when's the
last time you played?

1030
00:42:47,835 --> 00:42:50,838
- I play all the time. It's
just mostly industrial league.

1031
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,007
- Like I said,
when's the last time

1032
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,675
you played pro-level soccer?

1033
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,746
- Three years ago,
when my dad cut me.

1034
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:01,816
- Come on, Jack, you
gotta give me a break.

1035
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:03,184
Your family and
I, we go way back,

1036
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:04,652
but this just doesn't work.

1037
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:05,619
You haven't played
in three years

1038
00:43:05,653 --> 00:43:07,288
since your own father cut you.

1039
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,756
Not to mention that
temper you have.

1040
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:09,990
- I've worked on my temper,

1041
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:12,226
and my touch is as
good as it's ever been.

1042
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,361
Look, do what you need to
do, but I'm definitely better

1043
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:16,831
than any striker you've had
since Douglas got injured.

1044
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:18,732
- Your talent has
never been the issue.

1045
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:19,534
You lack self-confidence.

1046
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:21,102
You've never
believed in yourself.

1047
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:23,137
- I walked in here and
told you that I'm your man.

1048
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,739
I'm pretty sure that confidence
isn't the issue right now.

1049
00:43:25,773 --> 00:43:28,242
- Well I gotta give you credit
for that, but you gotta--

1050
00:43:29,977 --> 00:43:31,378
- Mr.
White on Line One.

1051
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:32,780
- Thank you.

1052
00:43:32,813 --> 00:43:34,215
Jack, I'm sorry, I
got a lot on my plate.

1053
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:35,349
I really have to take this call.

1054
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:36,350
- Just give me a workout.

1055
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:38,652
- You're really putting
me in a tight spot here.

1056
00:43:38,686 --> 00:43:41,055
- I know. I won't embarrass you.

1057
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:43,824
Okay, I promise, just all
I'm asking for is a shot.

1058
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,962
- I'll tell you what.

1059
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:50,231
I'll give you a few minutes
at training tomorrow.

1060
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:52,032
No special treatment.

1061
00:43:52,066 --> 00:43:54,001
You better prove me wrong,
or everyone's gonna think

1062
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:56,737
I flipped, and maybe I have.

1063
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,205
- You won't regret it, Coach.

1064
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,375
- Maybe I already do.
Are you even in shape?

1065
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:02,176
- You'll see.

1066
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:03,377
- All right.

1067
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:16,223
- Thanks.

1068
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:18,826
- Jack Davis, right?

1069
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:21,729
From the first family of
North American soccer.

1070
00:44:21,762 --> 00:44:24,398
- That's a good one.
Nice to meet you.

1071
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:26,700
- What are you doing here?

1072
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:27,368
- Okay.

1073
00:44:28,802 --> 00:44:29,904
I'm training with
the team today.

1074
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:31,805
- You're just training,
really? That's a little weird.

1075
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,942
Nothing to do with you joining
the team, though, right?

1076
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:36,443
- Nah, of course not.

1077
00:44:36,477 --> 00:44:38,879
- Yeah good, because I'm not
a fan of the Davis family.

1078
00:44:38,913 --> 00:44:41,415
Known your brother a long
while. I can't stand him.

1079
00:44:41,448 --> 00:44:43,317
Or your pops, who cut
me for no good reason.

1080
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,953
- Check that out.
Makes two of us then.

1081
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:46,987
Because he cut me too.

1082
00:44:47,021 --> 00:44:47,855
- Yeah I know.

1083
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:49,056
- Who doesn't?

1084
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:50,291
- Listen, man, I'm gonna
do everything I can

1085
00:44:50,324 --> 00:44:51,825
to keep you off this team.

1086
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:54,862
We may need a striker,
but the Davis family

1087
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:56,797
and the stench
that goes with it,

1088
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,332
it's the last thing
my team needs.

1089
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:01,735
- We'll see you on
the field, Keep.

1090
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:15,182
- Who's this guy?

1091
00:45:15,216 --> 00:45:16,984
- This is Jack
Davis, Coach Davis' son.

1092
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:17,918
- Coach
Davis from Charlotte?

1093
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:19,153
- The Coach Davis, yes.

1094
00:45:19,186 --> 00:45:21,021
We're gonna give him
a try. He came in.

1095
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:23,457
Figured let's have a go. We
have trouble scoring goals.

1096
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,858
So we'll give him a chance.

1097
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:25,793
- He's that good, huh?

1098
00:45:25,826 --> 00:45:26,727
- I hope so. I hope he is.

1099
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,295
He's got a good hit.
He has decent speed.

1100
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:29,496
- All right, I'll
go check him out.

1101
00:45:29,531 --> 00:45:31,232
- All right, thanks, Coach.

1102
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:32,866
- Jack Davis.
- Coach.

1103
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,034
- Assistant Coach
Creekmore, nice to meet you.

1104
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:34,969
- Nice to meet you.

1105
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:35,970
- You ready for this today?

1106
00:45:36,003 --> 00:45:37,204
- Hope so.

1107
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:38,540
- All right, we're
gonna get you set up

1108
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:39,473
on those balls over there.

1109
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:41,242
Need to do some
measurements of your kicks,

1110
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:42,476
see what kinda shape you're in,

1111
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,111
get you in some of
these drills too, okay?

1112
00:45:44,144 --> 00:45:46,280
- Cool.
- I want you to try to
kick all these balls

1113
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:47,881
in the goal without stopping.

1114
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,551
Between each shot,
backpedal around the cone,

1115
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:50,918
on to the next ball.

1116
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:51,919
I'll tell you when to start.

1117
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:52,786
- Cool.

1118
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:56,090
- Go.

1119
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:00,995
Around the cone.

1120
00:46:03,598 --> 00:46:06,100
All the way around
the cone, hustle up.

1121
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:11,872
I need it harder.

1122
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,008
Hustle up, hustle up.

1123
00:46:15,276 --> 00:46:16,977
One more, come on.

1124
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:20,948
Hey, Jack, need you
to start running laps.

1125
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:22,316
Not gonna tell you how
long you have to run,

1126
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,084
but if you don't maintain
a six-minute mile,

1127
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:26,120
then any chances you
might have are done.

1128
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:27,354
- Okay.

1129
00:46:27,388 --> 00:46:29,056
- Just get ready
to go on my mark.

1130
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:29,923
Set.

1131
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:32,192
Go.

1132
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:47,408
Hustle up.

1133
00:46:51,178 --> 00:46:52,012
Good.

1134
00:46:53,314 --> 00:46:56,183
Good, 11:55, 56.

1135
00:46:56,216 --> 00:46:57,418
Barely made it, Davis.

1136
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:59,153
Hustle up, back to
the balls, let's go.

1137
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:00,187
- Shots?

1138
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,021
- Shots.

1139
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:01,989
- All right, Goalie.

1140
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,325
- You sure about that?
You need a little break?

1141
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:07,494
You mean like that? Come
on, I'll give you a freebie.

1142
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:09,263
Oh, that's cute.

1143
00:47:09,296 --> 00:47:10,431
So you wanna hit the other side,

1144
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:11,398
or are you just gonna
keep going left?

1145
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:13,100
Ooh, I'm sorry.

1146
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:14,101
You gonna put some power
behind that kick or what?

1147
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:14,968
I mean, come on.

1148
00:47:16,604 --> 00:47:18,305
- Yo, I missed your name.
What is it, Douche Bag, right?

1149
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:19,139
What's up?

1150
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:20,307
- What you say to me?

1151
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:23,545
- Back off, back off!

1152
00:47:23,578 --> 00:47:25,446
Back in goal,
Dennis, back in goal!

1153
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:26,380
Listen up, listen up!

1154
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:27,314
Hey, you wanna make this team?

1155
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:28,982
- I got you. I got you, Coach.

1156
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:30,250
- All right, back to the
cones. Drilling and agility.

1157
00:47:30,284 --> 00:47:32,920
Touch all cones, down
and back, down and back.

1158
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:33,588
Faster.

1159
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:36,924
Now sprint. Sprint!

1160
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:39,460
Back, down and back.

1161
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:41,495
All cones, let's go, sprint!

1162
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:44,431
- Jack, you're up, let's go.

1163
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:45,600
- Come on, you're in!

1164
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:47,067
Hustle up, Davis.

1165
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:49,103
Play on, let's go!

1166
00:47:56,343 --> 00:47:58,613
Jack, you're offsides!
What's going on?

1167
00:47:58,646 --> 00:48:01,281
Come on. All right, we
don't play stupid here!

1168
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:04,151
All right, guys, corner
kicks. Let's go, corner kicks!

1169
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:08,188
- Nice play, Messi.

1170
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:09,289
- Guys, guys, come on, we
have to be able to score

1171
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:12,025
on these set pieces, let's go!

1172
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:13,927
Left side, left side now!

1173
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:18,298
All right, that's more like it.

1174
00:48:18,332 --> 00:48:20,167
Sprints, over
here, wind sprints.

1175
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,235
Jack, come on.

1176
00:48:22,302 --> 00:48:24,706
All right, you didn't
embarrass yourself or me.

1177
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:26,373
The coaches and I are
gonna have a conversation

1178
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:28,342
about you tonight, and
we'll let you know.

1179
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,109
- Thanks for the chance, Coach.

1180
00:48:29,143 --> 00:48:30,177
- I can't guarantee
you anything.

1181
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,044
- Got it.

1182
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:31,713
- All right, off you go.

1183
00:48:31,746 --> 00:48:32,580
- See ya.

1184
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:36,551
- Let's go, guys!

1185
00:48:39,721 --> 00:48:41,054
- I don't know, I
just completely whiffed

1186
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,289
on the first header.

1187
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:43,424
- But you made the one
right after, right?

1188
00:48:43,457 --> 00:48:45,426
- I don't know. I don't
know what Scurry's thinking.

1189
00:48:45,459 --> 00:48:46,694
I mean, I don't know if
she's gonna call me or--

1190
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:49,296
- I think you're
worrying too much.

1191
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:52,299
No matter what happens,
I'm really proud of you.

1192
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,502
- I mean, I owe so much
of it to you, right?

1193
00:48:54,536 --> 00:48:55,737
Can you believe it was your song

1194
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:56,937
that was playing when
I was freaking out?

1195
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,508
- But you're the one who did
it. That's what's important.

1196
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:03,043
- Yeah. Your song?

1197
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:03,678
- Yes.

1198
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:07,314
- Did you write that
after we broke up?

1199
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:08,750
- Yeah.

1200
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:10,284
Are you okay with that?

1201
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:13,353
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
I think it's so good.

1202
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:14,254
I know you hate when I say it,

1203
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:15,690
but I think you're
gonna be really big.

1204
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:17,291
- Thanks.

1205
00:49:17,324 --> 00:49:18,325
- Yeah.

1206
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:19,661
- Means a lot to me.

1207
00:49:19,694 --> 00:49:21,361
- So how are your students?

1208
00:49:21,395 --> 00:49:25,032
- They're great. They did so
well at their school assembly.

1209
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:26,701
And they've been
asking about you.

1210
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:28,302
- Oh, must be the rapping.

1211
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:32,607
- I'd be down to come
around and see them again.

1212
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,043
- I think that
could be arranged.

1213
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:37,377
- Yeah?

1214
00:49:37,411 --> 00:49:38,412
Cool.

1215
00:49:41,683 --> 00:49:43,183
Oh shoot. Um.

1216
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:47,689
Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
take this real quick.

1217
00:49:47,722 --> 00:49:49,591
I'll be right back, quick.

1218
00:49:49,624 --> 00:49:50,424
- Good luck.

1219
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:51,626
- Hey.

1220
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:52,560
- Hey,
Jack, this is Coach.

1221
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:53,795
I have a decision for you.

1222
00:49:53,828 --> 00:49:55,462
- Oh, hi, Coach,
how are you doing?

1223
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:56,764
- After a long deliberation
with the other coaches,

1224
00:49:56,798 --> 00:49:59,634
we've seen that the long
layoff has affected you.

1225
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:15,617
- Hey, it's okay. You did it,
and I'm proud of you anyways.

1226
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:19,687
No!

1227
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:20,722
- Yeah.

1228
00:50:20,755 --> 00:50:22,657
- Yes?
- Yeah.

1229
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,225
- She said yes! She said yes!

1230
00:50:28,763 --> 00:50:32,099
- Yeah, woo! She said yes!

1231
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:35,235
- No, no no no, it's not that.

1232
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,470
I'm sorry.

1233
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:40,374
- Yeah,
sorry about that.

1234
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:45,513
Oh my God, cheers, cheers.

1235
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:49,449
- Late here in the
second half, as expected,

1236
00:50:49,483 --> 00:50:52,185
a low-scoring match between
Chicago and Georgia.

1237
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,420
It's Chicago, the home side,

1238
00:50:53,453 --> 00:50:55,122
that leads by a goal to nothing.

1239
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:56,423
- And here in the Windy City

1240
00:50:56,456 --> 00:50:59,561
the Wild looking to
catch a second wind.

1241
00:50:59,594 --> 00:51:01,663
- Come on, boys, here we
go! Keep the ball, keep it!

1242
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:06,433
- And another
misplaced pass by the Wild.

1243
00:51:06,466 --> 00:51:07,869
- And you can
see the frustration

1244
00:51:07,902 --> 00:51:09,871
in their body language.

1245
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:11,606
- A strike
from distance now.

1246
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:14,776
Oh, it's a good save. Really
good stuff by Dennis Brady.

1247
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:16,678
Georgia relying on
their goalkeeper

1248
00:51:16,711 --> 00:51:18,613
as they build outta
the back, and what can

1249
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:20,380
Briana Scurry's team offer?

1250
00:51:22,316 --> 00:51:24,318
- Find him wide! Find him wide!

1251
00:51:24,351 --> 00:51:25,185
Nice.

1252
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:28,823
- Better buildup
play from the Wild.

1253
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:31,659
The ball, to the feet of
Florin, onto his right boot.

1254
00:51:31,693 --> 00:51:33,360
Blazes it!

1255
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:35,830
- Ooh, looks like
his age and knee surgeries

1256
00:51:35,863 --> 00:51:37,699
are beginning to take a toll.

1257
00:51:37,732 --> 00:51:41,803
- Come on, come on, be on
the end to end, let's go!

1258
00:51:41,836 --> 00:51:43,638
- Coach? Hey, put me in.

1259
00:51:43,671 --> 00:51:45,272
Coach, I can get us the goal.

1260
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:46,708
- What the hell are you
doing? Get back on the bench.

1261
00:51:46,741 --> 00:51:48,108
- I can get us the goal we need.

1262
00:51:49,844 --> 00:51:51,579
- Coach will tell you when
to get up, you got it?

1263
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:52,880
- Yeah.

1264
00:51:52,914 --> 00:51:55,349
- Chicago's defense
has prevented Georgia

1265
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:57,317
from getting out
of their own half.

1266
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:58,920
- After a perfect
start to the season,

1267
00:51:58,953 --> 00:52:01,789
winning seven straight games,
the goals have dried up

1268
00:52:01,823 --> 00:52:03,625
since losing striker
Eric Douglas.

1269
00:52:03,658 --> 00:52:05,927
Now a fourth straight
loss for the Wild.

1270
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,261
Next week, it'll be
Dallas visiting Georgia,

1271
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:09,697
and the winner of
that match will go on

1272
00:52:09,731 --> 00:52:11,599
to play in the
championship game.

1273
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:16,771
- After the chance I took
with you, that, really?

1274
00:52:16,804 --> 00:52:18,372
Don't say another word to me.

1275
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:21,208
I should cut you right
now, with a game left,

1276
00:52:21,241 --> 00:52:22,476
but you know what?

1277
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,177
I'm not gonna do that,
because I don't wanna

1278
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:26,413
embarrass your father,
or your family.

1279
00:52:28,683 --> 00:52:30,685
- It has gotta be so frustrating

1280
00:52:30,718 --> 00:52:33,554
when you just can't
mount any offense.

1281
00:52:33,588 --> 00:52:35,523
- Georgia's scoring
woes continue.

1282
00:52:35,556 --> 00:52:37,859
Another loss for the
Wild and now they cannot

1283
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:39,627
afford another slipup.

1284
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:42,229
Let's head back to studio
for post-match analysis.

1285
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,647
- Welcome.

1286
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:00,480
- Hey, everyone.

1287
00:53:00,515 --> 00:53:01,783
- Hello.
- Hey.

1288
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:03,618
- Jack, do you really
play for the Wild now?

1289
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:06,386
- I sure do. That's a nice
jersey, looks good on you.

1290
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:10,223
- All right, everyone,
that's it for today.

1291
00:53:10,892 --> 00:53:12,593
- Hey, what's his name?

1292
00:53:12,627 --> 00:53:13,695
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

1293
00:53:13,728 --> 00:53:15,897
- Hey, Jerry, would you wanna go

1294
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,932
to the next Georgia Wild game?

1295
00:53:17,965 --> 00:53:18,766
- For real?

1296
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,801
- For real.

1297
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:21,536
- Of course.

1298
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:22,469
- Awesome.

1299
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:23,805
- Guys, guess where I'm going!

1300
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:24,672
- Oh, I hope that's all right

1301
00:53:24,706 --> 00:53:26,541
that I invited him
to the next game.

1302
00:53:26,574 --> 00:53:28,509
- Of
course, he'll love it.

1303
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:30,578
- Yeah, I figured it better
be this game, you know.

1304
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:31,813
I could have a
whole playing career

1305
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:32,947
where I never get off the bench.

1306
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,982
- Hey, I thought you agreed
to stop talking like that.

1307
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:36,684
- I know.

1308
00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:38,019
And I just, you know how
bad I want an opportunity

1309
00:53:38,052 --> 00:53:40,688
to get out there, you
know, prove myself.

1310
00:53:40,722 --> 00:53:42,023
- I know.

1311
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:43,024
- Should we get outta here?

1312
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:43,858
- Yeah.

1313
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:45,358
- Good day?

1314
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:45,993
- Yes.

1315
00:53:46,027 --> 00:53:47,360
- Yeah?

1316
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:48,328
- Yeah, it was good.

1317
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:49,897
Not any rapping this time.

1318
00:53:49,931 --> 00:53:50,765
- No rapping.

1319
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:01,475
- Oh, and William
Ford misses again.

1320
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:02,677
- Coach Creekmore?

1321
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,611
- Yeah, Coach.

1322
00:54:03,644 --> 00:54:04,846
- I've seen enough of this.

1323
00:54:04,879 --> 00:54:05,780
Might as well see if
Davis can do anything.

1324
00:54:05,813 --> 00:54:06,748
- Got it. Davis, off the bench.

1325
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:08,716
Start warming up, right
now. Let's go, hustle.

1326
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,918
- Let's go, Wild,
let's go, intensity!

1327
00:54:12,854 --> 00:54:14,655
- Jerry, look,
Jack's warming up.

1328
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:16,591
I hope this means
he's going to go in.

1329
00:54:17,992 --> 00:54:18,893
- Jack, come here.

1330
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,765
You're going in for Florin
at striker. Look at me.

1331
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:25,566
This is your time to
show what you can do.

1332
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,868
We just need one goal.

1333
00:54:26,901 --> 00:54:29,369
Now get in there and
do it, all right?

1334
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:30,004
- Yes, Coach.

1335
00:54:30,037 --> 00:54:31,506
- All right.

1336
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,373
Here we go, Wild, here we go!

1337
00:54:33,406 --> 00:54:34,407
- Enough is enough

1338
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:35,843
for head coach Briana Scurry.

1339
00:54:35,877 --> 00:54:38,012
Substitution for
the Georgia Wild.

1340
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:40,447
Jack Davis, a
late-season signing

1341
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,784
set to enter for
the veteran Florin.

1342
00:54:42,817 --> 00:54:45,953
With the season on the
line, can Davis be the key?

1343
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:57,330
- As Davis comes
on for his Wild debut,

1344
00:54:57,364 --> 00:55:01,434
remember, this is also
his professional debut.

1345
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:02,837
- He needs
an instant impact

1346
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,740
with Georgia trailing
by a goal to nothing.

1347
00:55:05,773 --> 00:55:07,909
It's Davis now
combining beautifully.

1348
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:10,545
Georgia on the hunt
for that equalizer.

1349
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:13,346
The ball now, to the
feet of Jack Davis.

1350
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,550
In on goal, brought
down edge of the area.

1351
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:18,085
- Free kick, Georgia.
- Come on!

1352
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,720
- Back off!
- Stop it, no, no no no.

1353
00:55:19,754 --> 00:55:22,056
- Newcomer
Davis is giving Georgia

1354
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:23,825
the spark they need.

1355
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:25,126
- Nice, Jack, way
to keep your head.

1356
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:27,528
Let's go, let's go, Wild!

1357
00:55:27,562 --> 00:55:29,964
- Yellow card for
Dallas defender Blake.

1358
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:33,400
Georgia need a goal, and this,
a prime-time opportunity.

1359
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:36,571
Davis takes his place
inside the danger area.

1360
00:55:36,604 --> 00:55:38,973
Diego Sanchez over
the ball for Georgia

1361
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:40,641
as Lynn sets his wall.

1362
00:55:40,675 --> 00:55:42,577
Sanchez delivers. Davis, goal!

1363
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,046
- Yeah!

1364
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:45,847
- Yes!

1365
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:49,650
- Georgia has
tied the game at one

1366
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:53,754
on a goal by Jack Davis,
and look at the Wild fans!

1367
00:55:53,788 --> 00:55:56,057
They are going crazy!

1368
00:55:58,059 --> 00:55:59,861
- Georgia on
the attack once more.

1369
00:55:59,894 --> 00:56:02,930
Beautiful ball, Jack Davis
delivers for Garcia, oh!

1370
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:08,169
How the tide has turned.

1371
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:10,071
Georgia playing brilliantly now.

1372
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:12,940
- Come on, Jack.

1373
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:13,875
- Come on.

1374
00:56:13,908 --> 00:56:14,842
- Pass to the
onrushing Jack Davis.

1375
00:56:14,876 --> 00:56:17,979
The cross is a good one,
Garcia with the shot!

1376
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:22,516
- Yeah, woo!

1377
00:56:26,486 --> 00:56:27,822
Here we go, woo!

1378
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,892
- And there goes
the full-time whistle.

1379
00:56:30,925 --> 00:56:33,628
Late drama that
sees Georgia advance

1380
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:35,630
to the championship game.

1381
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,802
What an amazing ending
to a great game.

1382
00:56:41,836 --> 00:56:44,071
Davis brought a tremendous
amount of energy

1383
00:56:44,105 --> 00:56:45,806
with him into the game.

1384
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,908
- You're
absolutely right, Dave,

1385
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:49,176
and this is exactly what
the Wild have been missing.

1386
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,978
And talk about a
phenomenal way to advance

1387
00:56:51,012 --> 00:56:53,080
while also winning
the South Division.

1388
00:56:53,114 --> 00:56:55,216
Their attack was on
fire, far superior

1389
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:57,184
to anything we've
seen all season,

1390
00:56:57,218 --> 00:56:59,153
hitting the target 21 times.

1391
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,956
Now let's head north to
Boston, where the Big Blue

1392
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:04,525
are hosting the Preying
Mantis of Carolina.

1393
00:57:04,558 --> 00:57:07,128
- What a year, huh?
What a month, man.

1394
00:57:07,161 --> 00:57:08,796
- Unbelievable.

1395
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:10,131
- Yeah, I owe a lot of
this success to you, man.

1396
00:57:10,164 --> 00:57:11,165
- What?

1397
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:12,099
- I do. I do.

1398
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:13,000
- Come on, what did I do?

1399
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:14,535
- I don't know if I
could ever tell you.

1400
00:57:14,568 --> 00:57:15,468
- Hey, you know what?
Forget about it.

1401
00:57:15,503 --> 00:57:16,737
- Stop.

1402
00:57:16,771 --> 00:57:19,206
No, never, man, thank
you, though. To you.

1403
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,041
- To Boston.

1404
00:57:20,074 --> 00:57:21,175
- Boston, why Boston?

1405
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:23,811
- Well yeah, with our win
and if Boston doesn't lose

1406
00:57:23,844 --> 00:57:26,047
to Carolina by more than
two goals, you know,

1407
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,581
you don't have play
your father's team.

1408
00:57:27,615 --> 00:57:28,883
- Cool.

1409
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:30,584
- Hey, you don't
wanna play your father

1410
00:57:30,618 --> 00:57:32,253
and brother for the league
championship, do you?

1411
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:33,955
- I don't care who we play.

1412
00:57:35,122 --> 00:57:36,257
- Just saying.

1413
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:39,260
- Mm, bring them on. What?

1414
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:40,561
- Look who it is.

1415
00:57:42,263 --> 00:57:43,531
- Jesus.

1416
00:57:43,564 --> 00:57:44,165
- Cool, man, just be cool.

1417
00:57:44,198 --> 00:57:45,132
- I'm good.

1418
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,968
- Congratulations
on your success, Jack.

1419
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:48,836
- You really mean that?

1420
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:50,538
- Of course.

1421
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:53,641
Oh, and I, and I also wanna
introduce you to someone.

1422
00:57:53,674 --> 00:57:55,242
Jack, meet my friend Mike.

1423
00:57:55,276 --> 00:57:56,277
- What's up, Mike?

1424
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,611
- Big Wild fan.

1425
00:57:57,645 --> 00:57:58,546
- Yeah.

1426
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:00,247
- You really do know Greg?

1427
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:03,517
- Yeah, yeah, Greg and
I are good friends.

1428
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:04,151
- Wow.

1429
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,787
Can I get a pic?

1430
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:09,223
- Yeah, sure. Sure, yeah.

1431
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:10,191
How about all three of us?

1432
00:58:10,224 --> 00:58:11,625
You want me to hop into
the middle? All right.

1433
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:13,761
- Okay, ready?

1434
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:16,597
Everybody say Wild!

1435
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:17,231
- Wild.

1436
00:58:17,264 --> 00:58:19,000
- Yeah.

1437
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:20,935
Look at you, big shot.

1438
00:58:22,903 --> 00:58:25,106
- He just pinched my ass.

1439
00:58:25,139 --> 00:58:25,940
- Greg?

1440
00:58:25,973 --> 00:58:27,575
- I'm serious, guys.

1441
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:31,312
I must be crazy. I
think he pinched my ass.

1442
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:33,614
- I tried to tell you
we were just friends.

1443
00:58:33,647 --> 00:58:34,882
- No, you didn't.

1444
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:38,119
- Yes, I did. Mike
is his boyfriend.

1445
00:58:38,152 --> 00:58:40,154
He probably did that
to get even with you

1446
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:41,088
after everything
you've done to him.

1447
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:43,791
- Yeah, no, well he got me back.

1448
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:46,727
- Hey, hey, hey. Final.

1449
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:47,661
- Uh-oh.

1450
00:58:47,695 --> 00:58:49,764
- Carolina six, Boston three.

1451
00:58:50,931 --> 00:58:52,199
It's gonna be an
interesting week.

1452
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:54,301
- What does that mean?

1453
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:57,104
- It means we got a date
with my dad and Sam.

1454
00:58:57,138 --> 00:58:58,773
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1455
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:00,007
- You gonna be okay with that?

1456
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:03,144
- Of course. No no, I
couldn't be happier.

1457
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:04,812
- Cheers to that, Buddy.

1458
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:06,714
Aint nothing but a thing.

1459
00:59:06,747 --> 00:59:07,848
- Couldn't be happier.

1460
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:23,697
- Jack,
this is your father.

1461
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:25,933
Look, I need to talk
to you. Please call me.

1462
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,801
- Ah!

1463
01:00:00,835 --> 01:00:01,869
- Dammit, Jack, that
is at least twice

1464
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:03,704
you've missed that today,
what is your problem?

1465
01:00:03,737 --> 01:00:04,605
- Sorry, Coach, I got it.

1466
01:00:04,638 --> 01:00:06,240
- Hey, sorry's not
gonna cut it, all right.

1467
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:08,843
If you don't focus right now,
you're gonna find yourself

1468
01:00:08,876 --> 01:00:10,711
on the end of that bench,
and you know I'll do it!

1469
01:00:10,744 --> 01:00:12,346
All right, let's go, let's go!

1470
01:00:14,348 --> 01:00:15,883
- Good job today, Dado.

1471
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,151
Tell Mateo hi for me, huh?

1472
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:18,652
- Any predictions
on the game, Sam?

1473
01:00:18,686 --> 01:00:19,320
- Predictions?

1474
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:22,256
Yeah, I like our odds, and
that's an understatement.

1475
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:24,091
- Does that mean you
guarantee a victory?

1476
01:00:24,125 --> 01:00:25,259
- You got that right.

1477
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:26,760
- This must be a special
occasion, though,

1478
01:00:26,794 --> 01:00:28,162
playing against your brother.

1479
01:00:28,195 --> 01:00:29,096
- I'd say it is.

1480
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,264
- Any special advice for him

1481
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:32,666
since this is his first
championship game?

1482
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,869
- If he's smart, he won't
try to put one past me.

1483
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:36,036
- Have
you talked to him?

1484
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,305
- I did. I left him a message,
and this is what it said.

1485
01:00:38,339 --> 01:00:40,741
If we don't win, I will
walk down Peachtree Street

1486
01:00:40,774 --> 01:00:43,777
wearing my brother's
jersey in a pink tutu.

1487
01:00:43,811 --> 01:00:46,347
All right, hey thank y'all.
Excuse me, thank you.

1488
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,882
- Thank you so much.

1489
01:00:47,915 --> 01:00:49,350
- Oh, hey, you know what?
And I'll shave my legs.

1490
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:50,317
Quote that.

1491
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:51,152
- We're gonna hold you to it.

1492
01:00:51,185 --> 01:00:52,119
- Jack Davis style.

1493
01:00:55,189 --> 01:00:56,857
- What the hell are you doing?

1494
01:00:57,925 --> 01:00:58,859
Hm?

1495
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:01,762
Use your brain. You are
embarrassing yourself.

1496
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:03,330
And your family.

1497
01:01:04,899 --> 01:01:05,733
Cut the crap!

1498
01:01:20,247 --> 01:01:21,448
- Hey, hey.

1499
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:22,316
- Hey.

1500
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:26,720
- Hey, hey, hey,
our favorite spot.

1501
01:01:26,754 --> 01:01:27,321
- Yeah.

1502
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:28,389
- Always loved it here.

1503
01:01:29,823 --> 01:01:30,858
Ooh.

1504
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,295
- So, how was practice?

1505
01:01:34,328 --> 01:01:35,930
- Good, it's good.

1506
01:01:35,963 --> 01:01:38,098
We're just two days away
from the big game now.

1507
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:41,402
- Jack, you've been
acting so nervous lately.

1508
01:01:42,236 --> 01:01:43,871
Is it the game?

1509
01:01:43,904 --> 01:01:44,738
- Have I?

1510
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:47,509
No. No, I'm good,
don't worry about me.

1511
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:49,977
- I love you more than anyone
else in the whole world,

1512
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,346
but I do worry about you.

1513
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:53,914
- Wait, what's the matter?

1514
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:55,883
- Nothing.

1515
01:01:56,984 --> 01:01:57,985
I ...

1516
01:01:58,953 --> 01:02:01,789
Anyway, I think
you'll agree with me

1517
01:02:01,822 --> 01:02:03,991
that the people who
care about you the most

1518
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:05,326
just want what's best for you.

1519
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,795
- Sofe, why are you
saying all this now?

1520
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:08,462
- No reason.

1521
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:10,831
- No, you're making me
feel a little weird.

1522
01:02:10,864 --> 01:02:11,932
- Never mind.

1523
01:02:11,966 --> 01:02:14,502
It's, it's, it's nothing, okay.

1524
01:02:14,536 --> 01:02:18,772
Okay, before we eat, there's
something I wanna show you.

1525
01:02:18,806 --> 01:02:19,440
- Okay.

1526
01:02:21,509 --> 01:02:23,310
Wait a second, wait a second.

1527
01:02:23,344 --> 01:02:26,480
Before you play
anything actually,

1528
01:02:26,514 --> 01:02:29,250
there's something that
I wanted to tell you.

1529
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:32,052
You know that I love you

1530
01:02:32,086 --> 01:02:34,321
and I care about you more
than anything, right?

1531
01:02:34,355 --> 01:02:35,189
- Of course.

1532
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,525
- Okay.

1533
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:38,392
- Oh my God.

1534
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:44,031
- I believe that
everyone gets one person,

1535
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:46,200
right, who's meant
for them forever and,

1536
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:49,036
I've known for so long that,

1537
01:02:50,137 --> 01:02:52,206
for me, you were that person.

1538
01:02:53,608 --> 01:02:57,111
- Oh my God.
Jack, I'm in shock.

1539
01:02:57,144 --> 01:02:58,479
- I know, I know.

1540
01:02:58,513 --> 01:03:02,116
Look, I promise to love
you more than anything.

1541
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:04,318
Will you marry me?

1542
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:08,856
- Oh my God.

1543
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:11,191
- It fits perfectly.
- It's so beautiful.

1544
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:13,160
- So, will you?

1545
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:16,531
- Yes.

1546
01:03:16,564 --> 01:03:17,398
- Yeah? Yeah.

1547
01:03:20,434 --> 01:03:21,503
She said yes!

1548
01:03:22,936 --> 01:03:26,974
- Yes, but, Jack, you've
made incredible progress

1549
01:03:27,007 --> 01:03:29,076
and I'm so proud of
you, but we both know

1550
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:32,614
that there's still a lot
that we have to work on

1551
01:03:32,647 --> 01:03:34,481
before this marriage thing.

1552
01:03:34,516 --> 01:03:36,150
- Yeah, no, I
know, and I promise

1553
01:03:36,183 --> 01:03:38,018
that I will do
whatever it takes.

1554
01:03:39,286 --> 01:03:43,123
- This is the perfect time to
show you what I wanted to do.

1555
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:44,559
- Yeah.

1556
01:03:44,592 --> 01:03:47,494
- So, our song.

1557
01:03:49,997 --> 01:03:53,200
I know how much you always
loved when I sing in Spanish.

1558
01:05:02,436 --> 01:05:03,937
- What the hell?

1559
01:05:05,607 --> 01:05:08,475
- Jack, okay, don't get
upset. It was my idea.

1560
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,310
- Look, Jack, I
have to talk to you.

1561
01:05:10,344 --> 01:05:11,478
- Wait, you did this?

1562
01:05:11,513 --> 01:05:12,413
- Don't blame
Sofia. I called her.

1563
01:05:12,446 --> 01:05:13,648
I said I had to talk to you.

1564
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:15,048
- No, after what you
said at the house,

1565
01:05:15,082 --> 01:05:16,250
there's nothing
more to talk about.

1566
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:17,451
- Jack, you can't
continue on like this.

1567
01:05:17,484 --> 01:05:19,353
- I can't even my own engagement
without you screwing it up.

1568
01:05:19,386 --> 01:05:20,555
What's wrong with you?

1569
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:22,557
- Just take a walk
with me. Just a walk.

1570
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:24,091
- And how could you be
a part of this, huh?

1571
01:05:24,124 --> 01:05:24,726
Thought I could trust you.

1572
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:25,959
- That's not fair!

1573
01:05:29,296 --> 01:05:31,131
- Thanks for trying, Sofia.

1574
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:33,133
- Sorry.

1575
01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:49,517
- Hey, man, is this Wally?

1576
01:05:49,551 --> 01:05:51,185
Yeah, no, it's JD.

1577
01:05:51,218 --> 01:05:52,386
I didn't know if this was
still a good number, you know.

1578
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:53,287
I know. It's been a while, huh?

1579
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,289
You saw the game.
That's really cool, man.

1580
01:05:55,322 --> 01:05:57,725
You know, I was wondering
if I could get together

1581
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,727
with you, you know, run
it back like old times.

1582
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:03,096
Sure, uh, I can
head over right now.

1583
01:06:30,592 --> 01:06:31,693
- Who is it?

1584
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,429
- Hey, do you know if this
is still Wally's spot?

1585
01:06:35,462 --> 01:06:38,165
- Wally who?

1586
01:06:38,198 --> 01:06:40,200
- I don't know.

1587
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:41,536
- You don't know my last name?

1588
01:06:43,337 --> 01:06:46,741
JD, man,
it's me, Wally, man.

1589
01:06:46,774 --> 01:06:48,408
Look, check it out!

1590
01:06:48,442 --> 01:06:49,677
- Oh wow.

1591
01:06:49,711 --> 01:06:51,144
- Yeah, it's the long
hair, do you like it?

1592
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:53,313
Come on in, come on in.
You don't recognize me?

1593
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:54,516
- No, I did.

1594
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:57,217
- Oh man, it's the long
hair and the beard.

1595
01:06:57,251 --> 01:06:58,620
You hate it, don't you?

1596
01:06:58,653 --> 01:07:00,487
- No, it's, it's different.

1597
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:04,792
- Man, you know who likes
it? The ladies.

1598
01:07:06,293 --> 01:07:08,462
This place is like
crawling with women.

1599
01:07:08,495 --> 01:07:10,430
Well, Tuesday nights mostly,

1600
01:07:10,464 --> 01:07:14,134
but that's when we have
free hallucinogens night.

1601
01:07:14,167 --> 01:07:15,435
I'm just kidding. I
don't touch the stuff.

1602
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:17,471
What do you think
about the place, man?

1603
01:07:17,505 --> 01:07:20,374
- It's, it's cool.

1604
01:07:20,407 --> 01:07:21,509
- Yeah, I did some redecorating.

1605
01:07:21,543 --> 01:07:24,411
Check out my new art, man.
I've been taking classes.

1606
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:27,481
- Yeah yeah, I haven't
been here in a while.

1607
01:07:27,515 --> 01:07:29,617
- It's been like
two, three years.

1608
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:31,653
I thought you didn't
love me anymore.

1609
01:07:31,686 --> 01:07:34,488
You wamt the old stuff
or something new?

1610
01:07:34,522 --> 01:07:36,456
- No, the old stuff.

1611
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:39,426
- Here's your old stuff.
Here's something new.

1612
01:07:40,662 --> 01:07:44,431
That makes you feel like
you can fly, to the moon.

1613
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:52,339
What you, what you
bring a friend?

1614
01:07:52,372 --> 01:07:53,575
- No.

1615
01:07:53,608 --> 01:07:56,276
- Okay, I'm sure it's
nobody. Hold on to this.

1616
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:57,277
- I actually gotta get going.

1617
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,680
- Yep, yep, yep.

1618
01:08:00,648 --> 01:08:02,115
Oh no!

1619
01:08:02,149 --> 01:08:03,551
- What's up? What's up?

1620
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:06,386
- It's the cops!
Shut the door, run!

1621
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:11,378
- Jack, it's
me. I hope you're okay.

1622
01:10:11,411 --> 01:10:13,548
I'm just really
confused right now.

1623
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:16,651
I was just trying to make
things better. You know that.

1624
01:10:16,684 --> 01:10:20,855
You and me can't go on like
this. Good luck tomorrow.

Yeah, like, it's a long
story, Eddie, all right.

1636
01:11:51,478 --> 01:11:52,914
- So breaking news
that's just come in.

1637
01:11:52,947 --> 01:11:55,950
Our sources telling us that
legendary coach Harrison Davis

1638
01:11:55,983 --> 01:11:57,718
is set to announce
that he'll retire

1639
01:11:57,752 --> 01:11:59,419
at the end of the season.

1640
01:11:59,452 --> 01:12:01,789
- Hey, Eddie, give me a
second. I'll call you back.

1641
01:12:01,823 --> 01:12:02,957
- I'll make this brief.

1642
01:12:04,091 --> 01:12:06,426
I am hereby announcing my
retirement as head coach.

1643
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:08,996
Effective immediately
after tomorrow

1644
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:11,599
night's championship game.

1645
01:12:11,632 --> 01:12:14,101
I'd like to thank
my friends, family,

1646
01:12:15,536 --> 01:12:19,574
and all the fans, on
both sides of the pond,

1647
01:12:19,607 --> 01:12:21,542
for their support
throughout the years.

1648
01:12:24,879 --> 01:12:25,880
It's been something.

1649
01:12:26,981 --> 01:12:28,916
I will not answer any
questions regarding this matter

1650
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,450
until after the game tomorrow.

1651
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:34,121
- Well, the rumors were true.

1652
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:37,091
Legendary coach Harrison
Davis has announced

1653
01:12:37,124 --> 01:12:39,594
this will be his last season.

1654
01:12:39,627 --> 01:12:40,995
What a career.

1655
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:44,031
Winning the World Cup, a
hall-of-fame professional player

1656
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:46,399
in England, and then in the US.

1657
01:12:46,433 --> 01:12:48,870
A coach in England,
and then in the US.

1658
01:12:48,903 --> 01:12:51,072
He became the majority
owner of the Carolina team.

1659
01:12:51,105 --> 01:12:55,509
What a life in soccer,
the last 17 seasons

1660
01:12:55,543 --> 01:12:57,044
with this Carolina franchise.

1661
01:12:57,078 --> 01:12:58,512
- That's right,
Dave, it certainly will be

1662
01:12:58,546 --> 01:13:00,480
interesting to see how
it affects the team.

1663
01:13:00,514 --> 01:13:04,051
And remember, he's coaching
one son against his other son.

1664
01:13:04,085 --> 01:13:07,188
It's gonna be much more
than a regular game.

1665
01:13:26,107 --> 01:13:29,577
- Hey, um, I could really
use a friend right now.

1666
01:13:30,978 --> 01:13:34,181
Yeah, I'm at that park
behind the stadium.

1667
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:36,951
I'll see you.

1668
01:13:45,492 --> 01:13:46,527
- Yo.

1669
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:49,764
What's going on?

1670
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,568
- I can't go in there, man.

1671
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,539
- What do you mean
you can't go in there?

1672
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:02,209
- I don't know. I,
I don't think I can.

1673
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:05,980
- What's going on?

1674
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:08,481
- I don't know, man.

1675
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:12,485
I keep having these
like episodes where I,

1676
01:14:13,521 --> 01:14:14,355
I can't do anything.

1677
01:14:14,388 --> 01:14:16,190
I feel like I'm
drowning, and then ...

1678
01:14:17,992 --> 01:14:20,227
It's just terrifying,
man, because I don't know

1679
01:14:20,261 --> 01:14:23,030
when they're gonna come or
how long they're gonna last.

1680
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,169
It's just too much now, man.

1681
01:14:28,202 --> 01:14:30,905
Everything, it's too much.

1682
01:14:30,938 --> 01:14:32,239
- What's everything, the game?

1683
01:14:32,273 --> 01:14:33,975
- Everything.

1684
01:14:34,008 --> 01:14:38,212
Everything, Sofia, my father,
the game, my career, my dream.

1685
01:14:38,245 --> 01:14:39,613
Literally everything.

1686
01:14:40,581 --> 01:14:41,615
- Okay.

1687
01:14:44,118 --> 01:14:45,553
Can you try something for me?

1688
01:14:47,788 --> 01:14:49,123
Where are we right now?

1689
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:52,693
- Park.

1690
01:14:53,794 --> 01:14:54,695
- We're in a park.

1691
01:14:56,297 --> 01:14:59,834
Your father's not here.
The team's not here.

1692
01:14:59,867 --> 01:15:04,038
The game's not even here. We're
just sitting here talking.

1693
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:08,676
Win or no win, you are
still my best friend.

1694
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:10,311
- Yeah, but it matters if I win.

1695
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:11,178
- To who?

1696
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,881
- Everyone.

1697
01:15:13,914 --> 01:15:15,683
- We been doing the
same stuff for years.

1698
01:15:18,285 --> 01:15:20,287
And the only people
it matters to is us.

1699
01:15:21,756 --> 01:15:24,658
You could be selling T-shirts
in Tahiti, man. I don't care.

1700
01:15:24,692 --> 01:15:26,327
The only thing that you
have to do right now

1701
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:29,630
is go in there and play
a game, if you want to.

1702
01:15:30,798 --> 01:15:32,767
The only reason
you've gotten this far

1703
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,101
is because you wanted to.

1704
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:36,203
I didn't do any of
this. This is all you.

1705
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,675
If you don't go in there,

1706
01:15:41,709 --> 01:15:43,677
I'll have to go in there
and try and play for you.

1707
01:15:43,711 --> 01:15:45,613
And I don't think I'll
do as good of a job.

1708
01:15:51,185 --> 01:15:53,020
I'll see you in there.

1709
01:15:54,655 --> 01:15:55,289
If you don't,

1710
01:15:57,324 --> 01:15:59,660
you'll regret it for
the rest of your life.

1711
01:16:01,796 --> 01:16:04,265
You'll hear me
from the first row.

1712
01:16:09,737 --> 01:16:11,372
- Kevin Egan
alongside Dave Cohen.

1713
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:13,741
We're set to go for
the championship game

1714
01:16:13,774 --> 01:16:15,709
between Georgia and Carolina.

1715
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,711
And, Dave, safe to
say we've never really

1716
01:16:17,745 --> 01:16:18,979
seen a storyline like this one.

1717
01:16:19,013 --> 01:16:20,781
- Absolutely, Kevin, in
fact, they're dubbing

1718
01:16:20,815 --> 01:16:23,017
this one the Family Feud.

1719
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,853
Carolina, with owner
coach Harrison Davis,

1720
01:16:25,886 --> 01:16:28,923
goalie Sam Davis, as
Carolina goes for a record

1721
01:16:28,956 --> 01:16:30,624
fifth championship.

1722
01:16:30,658 --> 01:16:33,027
And they'll have to beat
the other son, Jack Davis,

1723
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,130
a star striker and a
late-season signing for Georgia,

1724
01:16:36,163 --> 01:16:37,631
who will hope to try
and take the Wild

1725
01:16:37,665 --> 01:16:39,900
to their first-ever
championship victory.

1726
01:16:39,934 --> 01:16:43,070
The wait is over, as we kick
off the championship game.

1727
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:46,240
Now Davis with an early touch.

1728
01:16:46,273 --> 01:16:48,776
And he's not really
moving, Dave.

1729
01:16:48,809 --> 01:16:50,244
- Yeah, he
looks listless.

1730
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:53,247
He might be having some kind
of issue, and now he goes down.

1731
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:59,053
- Jack, what the hell's
going on? Let's go!

1732
01:17:04,692 --> 01:17:05,793
- Good news for Georgia.

1733
01:17:05,826 --> 01:17:07,828
Jack Davis is back on his feet.

1734
01:17:07,862 --> 01:17:10,231
- Yeah, and only in
his second game, he's become

1735
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:14,001
a critical cog in the
Wild's revitalized offense.

1736
01:17:14,034 --> 01:17:15,769
- Certainly
helping them combine here

1737
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:17,905
as Georgia go on the attack.

1738
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:21,142
Up against the reigning
champions in Carolina.

1739
01:17:21,175 --> 01:17:23,944
Can Briana Scurry's
team cause the upset?

1740
01:17:23,978 --> 01:17:27,715
Sam Davis watching on. The
ball pushed wide for Mendy.

1741
01:17:27,748 --> 01:17:29,316
Mendy delivers beautifully,

1742
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,118
for Jack Davis with the header!

1743
01:17:31,152 --> 01:17:33,787
Into the grateful palms
of his brother Sam.

1744
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:35,890
- Just like old
times, Jack.

1745
01:17:36,957 --> 01:17:38,292
Just like old times.

1746
01:17:41,028 --> 01:17:43,230
Jack, Jack.

1747
01:17:43,264 --> 01:17:44,431
- Hey, we made it.

1748
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,001
How's he doing?

1749
01:17:48,135 --> 01:17:48,969
- Okay.

1750
01:17:50,037 --> 01:17:50,871
- Woo!

1751
01:17:52,773 --> 01:17:54,875
- Closing stages
of this first half.

1752
01:17:54,909 --> 01:17:56,877
Georgia surprisingly brilliant

1753
01:17:56,911 --> 01:17:58,846
here in this championship game

1754
01:17:58,879 --> 01:18:01,115
against the champions, Carolina.

1755
01:18:01,148 --> 01:18:02,816
On the attack they go again,

1756
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,885
with the instrumental
Jack Davis.

1757
01:18:04,919 --> 01:18:05,819
- Go left, go left, cover!

1758
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:07,388
- Chance for Davis!

1759
01:18:07,421 --> 01:18:09,456
Once more his brother
standing in his way.

1760
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:12,026
- All right, Jack, all right,
next time, Jack, next time!

1761
01:18:15,396 --> 01:18:18,799
- How are you so bad?
We have the same genes.

1762
01:18:21,503 --> 01:18:23,270
- Watch the
gap in the middle.

1763
01:18:23,304 --> 01:18:25,806
- The first goal yet
to be scored as Carolina ...

1764
01:18:25,839 --> 01:18:27,908
- In middle, in the middle.
-  - Go on the attack through Luis Rojas.

1765
01:18:27,942 --> 01:18:29,076
- Come on.

1766
01:18:29,109 --> 01:18:30,512
- He meanders
his way through.

1767
01:18:30,545 --> 01:18:32,279
A little shimmy and a
shake. Rojas with the goal!

1768
01:18:34,014 --> 01:18:36,884
Against the run of play,
Carolina have scored!

1769
01:18:36,917 --> 01:18:39,954
- Oh, Kevin, this is
gonna be so demoralizing.

1770
01:18:39,987 --> 01:18:43,924
The Georgia Wild has played
so well, above expectations,

1771
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:46,961
only to give up a goal
late in this first half.

1772
01:18:48,429 --> 01:18:50,965
- This now a
huge test of character

1773
01:18:50,998 --> 01:18:52,866
for this Georgia Wild side.

1774
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:55,035
Can they find a way back into it

1775
01:18:55,069 --> 01:18:58,372
against Harrison Davis and
the champions from Carolina?

1776
01:19:11,986 --> 01:19:14,154
- Anybody feel like putting
a ball in the net tonight?

1777
01:19:14,188 --> 01:19:15,956
Hm?

1778
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:18,292
How about we score a couple
goals, maybe one goal?

1779
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:21,028
Jack, can you not let
that asshole brother

1780
01:19:21,061 --> 01:19:22,296
of yours get in your head?

1781
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:24,398
- Hey, leave him alone.
He's the entire offense.

1782
01:19:24,431 --> 01:19:25,533
We're all out there trying.

1783
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:26,934
- I see that we're trying,
but it's not good enough.

1784
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:27,535
It's not cutting it.

1785
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,477
- We're down by a goal, and
we're fighting each other?

1786
01:19:37,845 --> 01:19:39,880
Rolling over and dying
is exactly what everyone

1787
01:19:39,913 --> 01:19:42,116
in that other locker
room expects you to do.

1788
01:19:43,083 --> 01:19:45,286
As far as I see it,
you have two choices.

1789
01:19:46,487 --> 01:19:49,456
You can either accept
losing and the labels

1790
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,125
that other people put on you,

1791
01:19:52,459 --> 01:19:55,062
or you can take your
destiny in your own hands

1792
01:19:55,095 --> 01:19:56,030
and get to work.

1793
01:19:58,999 --> 01:20:03,137
You have 45 minutes to show
everyone what you're made of,

1794
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,973
to leave it all out
there on the battlefield,

1795
01:20:06,006 --> 01:20:08,208
for yourselves and each other.

1796
01:20:11,278 --> 01:20:13,981
Now tell me, what's it gonna be?

1797
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:20,321
Are you warriors?

1798
01:20:20,354 --> 01:20:21,155
- Yeah.

1799
01:20:21,188 --> 01:20:22,956
- Bring it in, come on!

1800
01:20:24,124 --> 01:20:26,293
- Get in, get in.

1801
01:20:27,194 --> 01:20:28,295
- Who are we?

1802
01:20:28,329 --> 01:20:31,031
- Wild, Wild, Wild, Wild!

1803
01:20:31,065 --> 01:20:32,132
- Wild, let's go!

1804
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:34,001
- Come on, boys,
let's go! Let's go!

1805
01:20:38,205 --> 01:20:39,139
- Can we do this?

1806
01:20:39,173 --> 01:20:40,207
- Yeah.

1807
01:20:47,348 --> 01:20:49,216
- Aren't you in the
wrong locker room?

1808
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:52,319
- I'm not here as a coach.
I'm here as a father.

1809
01:20:52,353 --> 01:20:54,188
Have you got any
idea how hard it is

1810
01:20:54,221 --> 01:20:56,490
to watch what's going
on out on the field?

1811
01:20:56,524 --> 01:20:57,925
- What are you talking about?

1812
01:20:57,958 --> 01:20:58,992
As long as we don't score,

1813
01:20:59,026 --> 01:21:00,361
you get that record
championship you always wanted.

1814
01:21:00,394 --> 01:21:01,995
- A father whose
son is suffering.

1815
01:21:02,029 --> 01:21:03,130
Trust me, I'm suffering
as much as you are

1816
01:21:03,163 --> 01:21:04,532
just watching it.

1817
01:21:04,566 --> 01:21:06,266
Screw the fifth championship,
if it comes to that.

1818
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,901
- Screw the fifth
championship, really?

1819
01:21:07,935 --> 01:21:09,069
- You're damn straight!

1820
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:12,306
- Are you really done?

1821
01:21:13,575 --> 01:21:14,408
- Yeah.

1822
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,211
Yeah, I'm done.

1823
01:21:17,244 --> 01:21:18,546
I tried to call you before
it came out in the press.

1824
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:20,280
- I know. I saw the messages.

1825
01:21:21,683 --> 01:21:24,318
I figured it was a stunt, that
you'd never stop coaching.

1826
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:26,353
- Me too.

1827
01:21:27,722 --> 01:21:29,223
- So then why are you quitting?

1828
01:21:31,626 --> 01:21:32,426
Dad, is,

1829
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,295
is something wrong?

1830
01:21:35,329 --> 01:21:36,397
- Yes there is.

1831
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,932
That's the other thing I
wanted to tell you before.

1832
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:41,201
I've been diagnosed with MS.

1833
01:21:43,103 --> 01:21:43,937
- What?

1834
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:47,074
Like multiple sclerosis?

1835
01:21:47,107 --> 01:21:49,511
- It's a process that's
gonna take some time.

1836
01:21:49,544 --> 01:21:50,978
So no more coaching.

1837
01:21:53,113 --> 01:21:55,249
- Dad, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

1838
01:21:55,282 --> 01:21:56,950
- It's okay. It's all right.

1839
01:21:58,118 --> 01:21:59,987
I'll deal with
things as they come.

1840
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:00,622
Listen up.

1841
01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:03,357
This is your time now, Son.

1842
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:06,226
You really deserve it.

1843
01:22:07,361 --> 01:22:08,328
- Jack,
Coach needs you.

1844
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:10,030
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

1845
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:13,333
- That makes two of us.

1846
01:22:21,341 --> 01:22:22,142
Yeah.

1847
01:22:22,176 --> 01:22:23,010
- Yeah.

1848
01:22:36,457 --> 01:22:38,125
- Deep into
the second half,

1849
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:40,260
Georgia looking
for that equalizer.

1850
01:22:40,294 --> 01:22:42,362
It's Carolina leading by one.

1851
01:22:42,396 --> 01:22:44,666
Wave after wave of
Georgia attacks.

1852
01:22:44,699 --> 01:22:47,434
Here they go with Jack
Davis with the cross.

1853
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:48,536
- Watch Jack right
there, watch it!

1854
01:22:48,570 --> 01:22:50,337
- Sam Davis just
marshaling that back line,

1855
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:53,240
but the ball falls
now for Liam O'Brien!

1856
01:22:53,273 --> 01:22:55,209
The game is level!

1857
01:22:55,242 --> 01:22:57,077
- Oh, we talked
about the curious letdown

1858
01:22:57,110 --> 01:23:00,615
right before halftime,
but now we're all even!

1859
01:23:00,648 --> 01:23:02,617
It is anybody's game.

1860
01:23:04,519 --> 01:23:06,220
- Oh my God, they got one.

1861
01:23:07,321 --> 01:23:08,255
- The
match level at one.

1862
01:23:08,288 --> 01:23:10,324
Georgia possessing brilliantly.

1863
01:23:10,357 --> 01:23:12,326
And, Dave, look at
Carolina, the champions,

1864
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:14,428
sitting so deep defensively.

1865
01:23:14,461 --> 01:23:17,532
- Kevin, Georgia's
pressure has been relentless.

1866
01:23:17,565 --> 01:23:19,601
- Credit to Briana
Scurry and her team,

1867
01:23:19,634 --> 01:23:22,236
now looking to carve out
that big opportunity.

1868
01:23:22,269 --> 01:23:24,304
Davis high and
wide, nowhere close.

1869
01:23:24,338 --> 01:23:26,741
- All right, Jack, all right,
next time, Jack, next time!

1870
01:23:28,342 --> 01:23:30,444
- Final few
seconds of stoppage time.

1871
01:23:30,477 --> 01:23:32,479
Is there one more
attack from Georgia?

1872
01:23:32,514 --> 01:23:33,447
- Go back, go back!

1873
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,415
- Jack Davis,
inside the penalty area,

1874
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:36,518
thrown to the ground.

1875
01:23:36,551 --> 01:23:38,553
Knocked down by his brother Sam.

1876
01:23:38,586 --> 01:23:40,254
- Ref.

1877
01:23:40,287 --> 01:23:41,623
- And the referee
has a big decision to make.

1878
01:23:41,656 --> 01:23:43,056
- Come on, Ref! That's a PK!

1879
01:23:43,090 --> 01:23:44,491
- Georgia
wants a penalty.

1880
01:23:45,425 --> 01:23:47,394
And the referee
wants another look,

1881
01:23:47,427 --> 01:23:48,796
so he'll head to his monitor.

1882
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:50,532
- It'll be okay.
Don't worry about it.

1883
01:23:50,565 --> 01:23:51,733
Don't worry about it.

1884
01:23:51,766 --> 01:23:53,333
- What an
ending to this match.

1885
01:23:54,468 --> 01:23:57,437
Sam Davis is confident
he did nothing wrong.

1886
01:23:59,607 --> 01:24:01,441
Jack Davis wants a penalty.

1887
01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:06,380
What will the decision be?

1888
01:24:09,684 --> 01:24:10,450
- Are you kidding me right now?

1889
01:24:10,484 --> 01:24:11,619
Are you blind?

1890
01:24:11,653 --> 01:24:12,452
- Penalty!

1891
01:24:12,486 --> 01:24:13,621
- Are you blind?

1892
01:24:13,655 --> 01:24:15,122
- Whoa, a penalty
kick is coming up.

1893
01:24:15,155 --> 01:24:16,123
Now the question is ...

1894
01:24:16,156 --> 01:24:17,391
- Are you kidding me?

1895
01:24:17,424 --> 01:24:19,092
- Who takes it
for the Georgia Wild?

1896
01:24:19,126 --> 01:24:21,029
- No, you know that please.

1897
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:24,799
Okay, okay, that's fine.

1898
01:24:24,832 --> 01:24:26,601
- Sam Davis in goal,

1899
01:24:26,634 --> 01:24:29,804
and it looks like his brother
Jack will get the opportunity.

1900
01:24:29,837 --> 01:24:31,639
We told you at the outset ...

1901
01:24:31,673 --> 01:24:32,574
- Here we go.

1902
01:24:32,607 --> 01:24:33,641
- We've dubbed
this the Family Feud.

1903
01:24:33,675 --> 01:24:34,474
- Come on, Jack.

1904
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:36,276
- Yes, come on.

1905
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,713
- Now, 12
yards separating Sam
Davis and Jack Davis.

1906
01:24:38,746 --> 01:24:41,649
The penalty kick
could decide this.

1907
01:24:43,518 --> 01:24:47,287
How can coach Harrison
Davis bear to watch

1908
01:24:47,321 --> 01:24:52,326
his sons Sam and Jack
in this decisive moment?

1909
01:24:53,595 --> 01:24:55,295
- And Coach Davis
removing the iconic cap

1910
01:24:55,329 --> 01:24:59,266
worn by his father,
also a legendary
coach, Harrison Senior.

1911
01:24:59,299 --> 01:25:02,670
He's worn it every match
since his father's passing,

1912
01:25:02,704 --> 01:25:05,607
and is this the final
walk for Coach Davis?

1913
01:25:09,409 --> 01:25:10,310
- Coach.
- Coach.

1914
01:25:17,719 --> 01:25:19,419
- All right, guys,
here we go! Go!

1915
01:25:29,363 --> 01:25:30,565
- So here we go.

1916
01:25:30,598 --> 01:25:32,734
What an ending to this
championship match.

1917
01:25:32,767 --> 01:25:35,770
Brother versus
brother from 12 yards,

1918
01:25:35,803 --> 01:25:38,706
and every other play
will jockey for position

1919
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,775
in case this ball stays in play.

1920
01:25:40,808 --> 01:25:44,679
Jack Davis, this his first
professional penalty kick.

1921
01:25:44,712 --> 01:25:47,715
And you know, you just
know, these two brothers

1922
01:25:47,749 --> 01:25:50,283
have been in this
position before.

1923
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:51,451
- Look at me.

1924
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:53,921
- Come on,
boys, dinnertime.

1925
01:25:53,955 --> 01:25:55,723
Right now, it's gonna get cold.

1926
01:25:55,757 --> 01:25:57,491
- Just a second, Mom,
we'll be right there.

1927
01:25:57,525 --> 01:25:59,594
- Don't give me that we'll
be right there, Mom, stuff.

1928
01:25:59,627 --> 01:26:02,764
- But, Mom, this is for
the world championship.

1929
01:26:02,797 --> 01:26:05,700
- Okay, since it's for
the world championship.

1930
01:26:05,733 --> 01:26:08,636
- You'll never get one past me.

1931
01:26:16,711 --> 01:26:18,913
- Remember, Jack, visualize.

1932
01:27:29,851 --> 01:27:32,920
- Goal!
Jack Davis scores!

1933
01:27:32,954 --> 01:27:35,355
With that, Georgia Wild have won

1934
01:27:35,388 --> 01:27:37,324
their first-ever championship.

1935
01:27:37,357 --> 01:27:38,960
- I've seen
a lotta game winners

1936
01:27:38,993 --> 01:27:40,661
but never one like this!

1937
01:27:40,695 --> 01:27:43,765
The goalie saved it, it
deflected off the post,

1938
01:27:43,798 --> 01:27:47,334
ricocheted back to Jack
Davis for the game winner!

1939
01:27:47,367 --> 01:27:49,604
- What a goal
and what a match!

1940
01:27:49,637 --> 01:27:50,905
An instant classic.

1941
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:55,877
- Did you see it, Dad?

1942
01:27:56,744 --> 01:27:57,979
- Let's go, let's go! Yes!

1943
01:27:58,012 --> 01:28:00,480
- Oh my God!

1944
01:28:00,515 --> 01:28:03,316
- Yeah, well, I guess it was
just Jack's turn this time.

1945
01:28:13,995 --> 01:28:15,029
- You hear it?

1946
01:28:16,097 --> 01:28:18,900
You picked a hell of a
night to get one past me.

1947
01:28:18,933 --> 01:28:21,769
- Yeah, well, better late
than never. We good, man?

1948
01:28:25,106 --> 01:28:25,907
- Yeah, I'm good.

1949
01:28:30,678 --> 01:28:32,547
How's it feel to be a champion?

1950
01:28:34,015 --> 01:28:36,416
- I don't know, man.
It's still settling in.

1951
01:28:37,852 --> 01:28:40,054
Sure as hell beats being
a champion of frustration.

1952
01:28:43,024 --> 01:28:44,659
You know, I can't wait to
kick your ass next season.

1953
01:28:44,692 --> 01:28:46,527
- Ha ha, I look forward to it.

1954
01:28:48,996 --> 01:28:49,797
- Where did that come from, man?

1955
01:28:49,831 --> 01:28:51,933
What, you laid him
out without me?

1956
01:28:51,966 --> 01:28:53,400
- I was waiting for backup.

1957
01:28:53,433 --> 01:28:54,969
- You didn't need it, man.

1958
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:56,604
Come here, dude.

1959
01:28:56,637 --> 01:28:58,039
- Thank you, man. Thank you.

1960
01:28:58,072 --> 01:28:59,472
- Yeah, go have fun, come on.

1961
01:29:11,552 --> 01:29:13,588
- Holy shit, can you believe it?

1962
01:29:13,621 --> 01:29:15,957
- The best, craziest
decision I've ever made.

1963
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:17,091
- Thanks, Coach.

1964
01:29:17,124 --> 01:29:18,726
- My pleasure. You were awesome.

1965
01:29:20,528 --> 01:29:21,329
Yeah!

1966
01:29:22,263 --> 01:29:24,031
- Incredible game!
Dude, that was awesome!

1967
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:28,002
- You did it.

1968
01:29:28,035 --> 01:29:29,036
- We did it.

1969
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:30,104
- No, you did it.

1970
01:29:30,137 --> 01:29:31,572
Remember this.

1971
01:29:31,606 --> 01:29:33,908
Oh my God! Are you
kid, look at this!

1972
01:30:09,677 --> 01:30:11,212
- Oh.

1973
01:30:11,245 --> 01:30:12,680
- I'm so proud of you.

1974
01:30:12,713 --> 01:30:14,081
