It won't take off, will it?

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,953
Don't worry,

17
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,672
not while I'm around.

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,556
Now what?

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,830
Take hold of the joystick.

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,552
- This thing here?
- See how it moves.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,478
This is how we turn left,

22
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,352
and right...

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,797
Look at the wings.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,155
This is how we dive.

25
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,919
And this...

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,472
What's it doing?

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,756
Hey! It's...

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,554
This is how we climb, Hanichka.

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,553
- Aren't we going too high?
- All the way

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,716
to heaven.

31
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,594
Slama,

32
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,428
is that all you've done today?

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,790
He's not well, Sir.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,752
Come with me.

35
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,230
Sit down and write:

36
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,831
"Dear Family,

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,958
comma,

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,034
Do not send me any more food parcels

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,159
as I am not doing my job properly."

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,830
Sign it!

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,633
Sir, let him be.
He has a fever.

42
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,990
Mind your own business, Machaty!

43
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,078
Back to your place!

44
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,232
Back to your place!

45
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,515
Franta...

46
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,471
Back to your places!

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,673
During World war II
hundreds of Czechoslovak pilots
fought with the British against the Nazis.

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,712
After the War the Communists seized
power in Czechoslovakia

49
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,673
and jailed the pilots who had
returned home.

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,837
They feared these heroes would
once again fight for freedom.

51
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,590
Mirov Prison, Czechoslovakia, 1950

52
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,311
What's your name?

53
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,153
Franta Slama.

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,716
Vilda Houf, sign painter.

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,278
In here for my appendix.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,750
Look!

57
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,440
Locked up for stealing State property!

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,994
Some pots of paint.
Why are you here?

59
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,957
Pneumonia.

60
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,432
I mean, why did they lock you up?

61
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,319
I flew for the RAF. In England.

62
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,155
I see!

63
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,396
Let there be no mistake.

64
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,835
This is a forced-labour camp.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,993
You are educated men
so you know what it means.

66
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,948
Our "amnesty" cart.

67
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,635
It has only one route -
to the cemetery and back.

68
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,271
The only amnesty
you're ever going to know...

69
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,473
Lie on your side.
Better than on your back.

70
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,275
- Did you see that?
- What?

71
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,916
- The tattoo on his arm.
- He's an SS man.

72
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,599
You're kidding!

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,718
They're in the kitchen too.

74
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,990
You're in here with SS men?

75
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,758
So are you.

76
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,474
But I didn't fight against them.

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,919
There you go.

78
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,716
I did.

79
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,192
Olomouc Airfield,
Czechoslovakia, 1939

80
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,429
You know how you fly,
Voytishek?

81
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,990
- A bit wild?
- No.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,956
- Too much throttle?
- No.

83
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,435
I give up.

84
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,671
Like a natural.

85
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,711
Really?

86
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,759
Where's my dog?
Anyone seen my dog?

87
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,677
Shshe rrran tto the hhangar.

88
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,951
Of course, Gregora's stuffing her
with salami again.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,513
Give me the hangar.

90
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,835
Line your pants gents.
Tomorrow you're flying solo.

91
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,791
<i>- Hangar.
- You got my dog there?</i>

92
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,871
<i>- Yes, Sir.
- Put her on the phone.</i>

93
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,399
<i>What? On the phone?</i>

94
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,351
That's what I said.

95
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,670
Take a look, gentlemen.

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,753
Barcha, come here!

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,592
She's on the line.

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,792
<i>Barcha! Where
did I tell you to wait?</i>

99
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,669
That's all,

100
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,199
gentlemen.

101
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,311
Dismissed.
The show's over.

102
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,838
Barcha... Good girl...

103
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,955
Ssh.

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,312
My Papa!

105
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,475
Barcha. Her Papa!

106
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,470
<i>Silence! Adolf Hitler speaks.</i>

107
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,319
You're the one
we've been waiting for, bastard!

108
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,714
Not you!

109
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,192
<i>Germany has become</i>

110
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,879
<i>and always will remain Greater Germany.</i>

111
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,315
<i>This will be guaranteed by the
entire German people,</i>

112
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,796
<i>from East to West and now from the South
all the way here to Berlin, Heil!</i>

113
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,873
Quiet!

114
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,833
- You know what my mother said?
- What?

115
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,550
I'll end up marrying Kanka.

116
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,069
That lollipop-man down there?

117
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,717
- He'll be completely bald soon.
- But he's set his sights on me.

118
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,599
And you think I haven't?

119
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,874
Quiet! My parents!

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,353
- Think they don't know?
- Know what?

121
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,119
- That we're in love.
- Of course they know,

122
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,517
but not that
I let you love me so... deeply!

123
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,279
What's that?

124
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,873
- That's him.
- Who?

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,479
Kanka, of course.

126
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,559
He serenades me every night
to touch my heart.

127
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,679
Hanichka.

128
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm coming, Papa.
Just a minute!

129
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,869
Hanichka, please open the door!

130
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,189
Papa...

131
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,790
- Good evening.
- Captain!!

132
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,389
Mr. Pechar, let me explain...

133
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,517
They're repeating it over and over.

134
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,633
<i>At six a.m. On March fifteenth</i>

135
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,991
<i>the Armed Forces of the German Reich</i>

136
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,795
<i>will begin occupying our country.</i>

137
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,109
<i>Any resistance will be met</i>

138
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,719
<i>with brutal retaliation.</i>

139
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,632
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,428
Cry all you want. Who wouldn't?

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,639
<i>All units will be disarmed.</i>

142
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,719
<i>No aircraft, military or civilian,</i>

143
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,237
<i>are to leave their bases.</i>

144
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,949
Turn it off!

145
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,396
Cut the engine!

146
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,912
I'm taking it to Poland.
We can't let them have it!

147
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,237
Pilot Officer,
switch off your engine now!

148
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,074
Didn't you hear the order?

149
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,832
Yes, but I didn't like it.

150
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,554
Nobody's asked your opinion.
Get out!

151
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,311
Why d'you think the others
aren't taking off?

152
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,032
Because it's suicide

153
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,639
in this weather!

154
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,189
You'll crash into the first hill!

155
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,753
I know.

156
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,039
Everything
is conspiring against us.

157
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,115
England, France, the weather,

158
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,917
even my back,

159
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,712
everything.

160
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,908
We should tell our men
the Poles will need pilots,

161
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,036
ground crews too,

162
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,595
because Poland is next in line.

163
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,828
Nothing official.

164
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,476
Volunteers.

165
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,554
Preferably,

166
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,114
single men.

167
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,718
They're here.

168
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,509
Slama, please take over.
I can't move.

169
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,234
Let's call it an order.

170
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,311
Yes Sir.

171
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,198
Good morning gentlemen.
Ober-Lieutenant Hesse!

172
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,999
It's my duty
to take over this airfield.

173
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,351
Our commanding officer,
Wing-Commander Skokan

174
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,390
is physically indisposed.

175
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,476
I'm in charge.

176
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,392
Lieutenant Slama.

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,233
This whole army seems
"physically indisposed".

178
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,672
What a lovely map!

179
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,950
So, yesterday we were here.

180
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,868
We had a good look
at your famous defences.

181
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,398
Abandoned without a shot?

182
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,430
As a soldier, I can't understand it.

183
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,876
Sir, kindly do your duty

184
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,508
and respect the honour of soldiers

185
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,870
who have been forced to do theirs.

186
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,788
Keep your shirt on.
Just a little joke.

187
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,717
Now, I'd like to see the planes.

188
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,512
Gentlemen!

189
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,475
The keys, please.

190
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,398
All right boys, let's go.

191
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,592
I can imagine how you must feel.

192
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,956
A German officer would put
a bullet in his head.

193
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,955
But you are...
a little different,

194
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,712
aren't you?

195
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,837
Pilot Officer Voytishek!

196
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,874
I've got a spare seat.

197
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,838
Thank you,
but I'll stick with the boys.

198
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,953
You're taking it too personally.

199
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,675
How else! I felt like throwing up
in the hangar.

200
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,552
We carried out an order.

201
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,033
Now we can go home,
take off our uniforms,

202
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,668
and take it personally.

203
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,916
How long will it take you to pack?

204
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,192
Me?

205
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,912
No time at all.

206
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,515
Don't forget to brush out her ears.

207
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,638
Thistles get stuck in there.

208
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,232
She'll be grateful.

209
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,673
And in winter ice forms
on these hairs between her pads.

210
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,270
They hurt her,
so you have to cut them out.

211
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,111
But I'll be back well before then.

212
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,199
She'll listen to me?

213
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,949
Of course.
She knows you're a part of me.

214
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,029
What's this?

215
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,755
In case you come back at night
and the house is locked.

216
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,478
Thank you.

217
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,039
You don't have any documents on
you? In case we're searched?

218
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,479
No, Mr Slama.

219
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,033
Good.

220
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,509
And call me Franta.

221
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,471
And you can call me Karel.

222
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,749
I know.

223
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,758
I don't know how to put it...

224
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,348
Sir, I mean Franta...

225
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:15,271
but I do have some documents
I'd like to take with me.

226
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,159
What are they?

227
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,398
No, forget it, I'll get rid of them.
You'd only laugh at me.

228
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,272
No, I won't. Promise.

229
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,879
Let's see them.

230
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,433
Horses?

231
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,996
That's only camouflage.
There's worse.

232
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,036
She's my only girl.

233
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,958
I'd rather not part with her.

234
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,718
Your only girl?

235
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,956
- Then you should keep her.
- Thanks.

236
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,708
Sir,

237
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,876
I mean Franta! Look!

238
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,633
Oh God!

239
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,076
Barcha, you mustn't do this.

240
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,553
Go home.

241
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,111
Go home!

242
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,076
Back to Hanichka.

243
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,753
Go home!

244
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,949
Go or I'll hit you!

245
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,597
What's she doing?

246
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,517
She keeps turning around
but she is going back.

247
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,752
England, 1940

248
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,872
I can't see shit.

249
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,479
Shut up!

250
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,797
We're pedalling like maniacs.

251
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,309
This is stupid. I'm knackered!

252
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,112
- Bbehind yyou!
- Break left!

253
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,593
You bastards.
Why don't you let us fly!

254
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,232
- What's he saying?
- Get up. We're doing it again.

255
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,276
No! To hell with this!
It's not what I came here for!

256
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,677
On your bikes!

257
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,957
Out of my way.

258
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,392
What'd he say?

259
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,268
He says you're Myrtvy.

260
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,234
Thanks.
Mmay I kkeep her?

261
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,438
One week.

262
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,278
It means le... lend, stupid.

263
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,719
Shut it!

264
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,798
Open your mouth wider!

265
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,638
No language! Just madness.

266
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,555
Stop fooling about, Karel.

267
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,991
Ladies!

268
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,673
Excuse me,

269
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,996
a fortnight without
just isn't healthy.

270
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,798
<i>A little well
in an open field...</i>

271
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,151
I'm trying to do your mmouth,
so shut it!

272
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,270
Why ddon't we go
to the bbeach sometime.

273
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,551
- I've nnever sswum in the sea.
- It's freezing.

274
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,319
Just to dip our tttoes.

275
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,999
Hey. Look!

276
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,674
What d'you think he's saying?

277
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,954
He's trying to land them.

278
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,115
- I'd just get a slap in the face.
- You mustn't frighten them.

279
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,598
Machaty begins by asking the way.
Say, to the Officers' Mess.

280
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,395
But doesn't he know
where it is?

281
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,033
It's a device.

282
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,948
Women like to help you
when you're in trouble when...

283
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,195
they don't feel threatened.
It's how you break the ice.

284
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,231
Did Machaty tell you that?

285
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,113
It's common knowledge.

286
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:19,990
Great!

287
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,714
I guess English
is important after all.

288
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,350
There's no resemblance.

289
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,476
You jjust shut up Deadman.

290
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,478
Wwith your nname
you don't bbelong in a plane

291
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,636
bbut a ccoffin.

292
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,119
This supposed to be me?

293
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,629
Yes, I'd like you to have it.

294
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,236
Grinning like an idiot for this!

295
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,709
It's only good to scare kids!

296
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,598
What did he say?

297
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,148
Monkey catching.

298
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,431
Us? Makes sense. We've done
just about everything else.

299
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,350
Lift up your shirt.

300
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,549
Were you in France,
when we invaded?

301
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,076
- Yes.
- And what did you think?

302
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,237
- How you moved! Breathtaking.
- Don't breathe.

303
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,757
Blitzkrieg.

304
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,878
A short and sweet war.

305
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,110
Take a deep breath.

306
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,391
It was hard to be a German
and not be proud.

307
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,871
You can breathe now.

308
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,992
<i>The English returned
from their missions</i>

309
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,356
<i>with empty magazines,</i>

310
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,397
<i>and all we could do was</i>

311
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,028
<i>circle the airfield, target-shooting.</i>

312
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,550
Three months later...

313
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,756
Llend me another to do the ttits.

314
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,829
This one?

315
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,918
No, I need her.

316
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,917
<i>A little well, made of stone,</i>

317
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,517
<i>in an open field stands alone...</i>

318
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,234
<i>And its water is...</i>

319
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,232
That's us you idiots!

320
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,835
Finally!

321
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,358
Show yourselves, bastards!

322
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,709
Tthere they are! Two o'clock low!

323
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,869
Oh shit!

324
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,990
<i>Boys, don't jump the gun.</i>

325
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,114
<i>Fire only when they're
squarely in your sights.</i>

326
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,835
Shit!

327
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,037
Boys! Messerschmitts!
A whole swarm of them!

328
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,516
Tom Tom, on your tail!

329
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,272
<i>I can see him.</i>

330
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,948
But he's glued to my arse.

331
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,436
Boys, notice how I don't stutter
when I'm shit-scared?

332
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,311
Tom Tom can't bail out!

333
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,877
<i>- Two, Roger.
- Three, Roger.</i>

334
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,197
Move yourself, bastard!

335
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,070
<i>Blue two! Dive to sea level!</i>

336
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,439
I can't hear you.

337
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,710
<i>Dive to sea level.</i>

338
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,070
<i>Too little fuel to follow you!</i>

339
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,159
What?

340
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,511
Bedrich, we're not fighting
anymore, it's beddy-byes now.

341
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,749
The Germans are also beddy-byes,
they've stopped firing.

342
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,311
Even Hitler is beddy-byes
with Eva Braun.

343
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,069
Lying on your heart is no good,
it can give you nightmares.

344
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,637
Look at Sysel,
sleeping nicely on his back.

345
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,755
Good old Moravian pig...

346
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,312
- We have different things in mind.
- What do you mean?

347
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,351
I want... you know what...

348
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,040
and she just wants to teach me
English.

349
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,195
She says after the war... for the
other.

350
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,512
The one next to her doesn't look
as if she'd need to wait for peace.

351
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,875
She's more than I could handle.

352
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,440
- And her?
- She's Machaty's.

353
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,756
She's your date?

354
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,598
You said it!

355
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,319
It's amazing...

356
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,830
how calm they are.

357
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,916
And that'll be Hitler's downfall.

358
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,952
Because he's a hot-head
like our Voytishek.

359
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,032
Me a hot-head?
Just you wait!

360
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,350
<i>You know what's crossed my mind?</i>

361
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,310
<i>What?</i>

362
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,318
<i>Maybe I'm not handling her right.</i>

363
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,515
<i>We go for long walks.
She doesn't stop talking.</i>

364
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,116
<i>Of course we kiss but...</i>

365
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,910
<i>D'you think she expects me
to pounce on her?</i>

366
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,793
<i>I wouldn't know,
but shut up for now, okay?</i>

367
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,672
<i>But think about it, will you?</i>

368
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,949
<i>Sure.</i>

369
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,073
<i>- Franta!
- What?</i>

370
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,275
<i>I see him.</i>

371
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,357
<i>One o'clock.
Hugging the ground.</i>

372
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,711
<i>He's yours, Karel.</i>

373
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,759
<i>I'm going in.</i>

374
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,189
Franta, I'm hit!
Can you hear me?

375
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,793
Karel!

376
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,268
Oh God!

377
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,909
Out of the way!
I'll start her up.

378
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,519
Are you alright?

379
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,115
- In hospital?
- Stitched up his stomach.

380
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,713
Who's that?

381
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,877
Sysel. He was holding his guts.
It was oozing blood.

382
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,110
He'll be there for a week at least.

383
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,872
You land on your head
when you bailed out yesterday?

384
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,439
Not on my head,

385
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,872
on a woman!

386
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,389
And I fell madly in love with her.

387
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,033
I'm crazy about her.

388
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,559
Really?

389
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,233
I'm going mad.

390
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,191
One could...

391
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,709
One could escape from here.

392
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,592
I'd like to know how.

393
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,231
You see that barbed wire over
there?

394
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,794
If one got hold of a pair of pliers...

395
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,831
The wall's only five metres.

396
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,393
Gentlemen.

397
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,156
It's my birthday today.

398
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,119
- Fifty.
- Your health, doctor!

399
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,591
My father died at fifty.

400
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,472
Also a doctor.

401
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,237
In Reichenberg.

402
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,475
You know how many people
came to his funeral?

403
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,553
A hundred and twenty-seven.

404
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:43,073
My sister counted them all.

405
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,757
They loved him so.

406
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,991
That's life...

407
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,233
How many people did you kill
in the war, Mr. Slama?

408
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,633
No idea.

409
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,837
Take a guess.

410
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,071
Maybe ten.

411
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,556
Me, not one.

412
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,668
Have you ever seen an execution?

413
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,477
I did.

414
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,148
In Prague. At Kobylisy.

415
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,917
I had to check that
the people were dead.

416
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,831
For a whole month.

417
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,757
Day in day out.

418
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,077
- How do I look?
- Ravishing.

419
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,634
Really?
You're pulling my leg?

420
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,916
Get out, you Romeo.

421
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,994
Wait here. I'll give you a sign.

422
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,474
Lovely, isn't she?

423
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,160
I prefer bigger tits, but she is pretty.

424
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,309
How do you say "vinegar" in
English?
