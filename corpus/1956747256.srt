1
00:00:00,824 --> 00:00:03,574
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:15,204
(animal roaring lowly)

3
00:00:17,507 --> 00:00:20,257
(dramatic music)

4
00:00:37,794 --> 00:00:40,794
(crickets chirping)

5
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,892
(engine revving)

6
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:48,892
- Hold it, fellas.

7
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:49,725
Hold up.

8
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:54,130
Oh, good evening, Colonel.

9
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,955
- Just picking up
materials for the academy.

10
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:59,520
(engine idling)

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,900
- Sir, I don't see your name on the list.

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,720
- It's a last minute request, son.

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,118
General Smith signed off.

14
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:06,951
- I don't mean to hold you up.

15
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:08,280
But, I will need to call this in.

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,750
Do you mind?

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,449
- Yes, he minds.

18
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:12,785
(gun firing)

19
00:01:12,785 --> 00:01:15,785
(suspenseful music)

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,390
- Section patrol in 10 minutes.

21
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:37,266
(dramatic music)

22
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:52,638
- Which room?

23
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,323
Come on!

24
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,989
(door buzzing)

25
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,020
Get to work.
- Yes, sir.

26
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,030
- [Colonel] I have access
to much better material.

27
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,750
This is recycled junk is useless.

28
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,900
- We'll see about that.

29
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,542
(crickets chirping)

30
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,821
(door humming)

31
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:38,486
- [Colonel] Security they're early!

32
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:43,247
(keypad beeping)

33
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,830
- How do we get out?

34
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,663
- I tried.

35
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:48,710
- What are you saying?

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,130
- Let me try something else.

37
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:54,823
(keypad beeping)

38
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:57,906
(suspenseful music)

39
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,654
(bomb beeping)

40
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:11,825
(alarm blaring)

41
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,352
- [Avi] Come on.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,673
- You're insane.

43
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:21,970
- Yes, I thought you knew.

44
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:25,756
(alarm blaring)

45
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:31,482
(truck engine revving)

46
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:33,582
- [Commander] Move, go, go, go!

47
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:34,603
Go, go, go!

48
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:36,320
- [Officer] Hold it wait right there!

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,540
- Drop your weapons now!

50
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,730
- Put it down!
- Put them down!

51
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:51,704
(dog barking)

52
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:56,768
- Move out, move out, let's go!

53
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:57,601
Keep it moving.

54
00:03:57,601 --> 00:04:00,184
(dogs barking)

55
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:14,130
(flare guns popping)

56
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:50,124
(brakes squeaking)

57
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,791
(helicopter blades roaring)

58
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,210
- [Pilot] Bravo team to ground leader,

59
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,833
I have visual contact on vehicle
northbound 39er and 49er.

60
00:05:03,826 --> 00:05:06,430
- [Leader] Roger that, Bravo,
we'll follow your lead.

61
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:11,668
(suspenseful music)

62
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:27,640
- [Pilot] Ground leader
they just lit up down here.

63
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,043
Possible suicide mission.

64
00:05:36,614 --> 00:05:38,440
- I got a hell of a
mess down here, fellas.

65
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,683
No sign of survivors.

66
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,560
- [Pilot] Roger, Ground, we're closing in.

67
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,730
- Don't look at me like that.

68
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,563
You got what you want.

69
00:05:51,563 --> 00:05:53,934
Now give me what I want and we're done.

70
00:05:53,934 --> 00:05:56,684
(dramatic music)

71
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,950
- American greed will one day

72
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,103
dismantle the rest of the world

73
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,750
making them nothing more than slaves

74
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,540
to their own self-righteous economy.

75
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,713
- This isn't greed.

76
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,190
It provides my family with a decent life.

77
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,392
It's security.

78
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:20,530
(gun cocking)

79
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,842
- This is security.

80
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,259
(gun firing)

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,750
(engine revving)

82
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:46,464
(powerful guitar music)

83
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,470
- [Man] 13 years ago.

84
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,830
- I'm standing here on Tigani Beach

85
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,360
just south of Japan's Narita Airport

86
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,153
in what can only be
described as a disaster area.

87
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,190
- Wall Street stumbles today

88
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,760
as seven of the world's most
powerful business leaders

89
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,230
die tragically in this morning's
plane crash off the coast.

90
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,630
- That an explosion just after take off

91
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,250
sent flight 770 out of control

92
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,220
and into the Pacific Ocean.

93
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,683
There were no survivors.

94
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,910
NTSB officials along
with Central Intelligence

95
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,810
continue to search for the
answer to the question:

96
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,960
Was this the result of human error

97
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,350
or the act of a terrorist?

98
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:41,350
- Any survivors could still
be targets, Mr. President.

99
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,530
We need to protect them, to hide them.

100
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,250
- They'll work for us, and only us.

101
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,280
- Of course, sir.

102
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:54,363
- [Instructor] Go again.

103
00:07:56,154 --> 00:07:58,301
- [Children] Hai.

104
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:59,218
Huh!

105
00:08:02,587 --> 00:08:03,587
Hey!

106
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,621
(snake tail rattling)

107
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:23,371
(birds chirping)

108
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,800
(car engine revving)

109
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:37,091
(lively rock music)

110
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,653
- [Man] He's coming in alone.

111
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,810
- [Woman] Copy that.

112
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,863
- How you doin'?

113
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,773
Jealous?

114
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:46,965
Oh, careful.

115
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,320
That's loaded, sweetie.

116
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,153
- This way.

117
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,903
- Hmm, hello there.

118
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:21,473
I hope you don't find
all this too pretentious.

119
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,417
Business in town can draw
attention I'd rather avoid.

120
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,267
- Understandable.

121
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,183
- Oh, yes, this is Miss Love.

122
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,730
She's new to our stable here.

123
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,513
I felt it was time she see
just how I like to do business.

124
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,070
- Is that it?

125
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,903
- Yes.

126
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,137
- Well, let's have a look.

127
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:51,973
(bones cracking)

128
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:58,193
Can I get more light, please.

129
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,373
Wow.

130
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,293
Nicely done.

131
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:06,730
- There're all there.

132
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,090
Silos in Europe, the U.S., South America.

133
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,013
All the codes you need for activation.

134
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,860
- They warranty?

135
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,648
- None, launch codes change all the time.

136
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:18,640
My reputation should guarantee.

137
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,020
That's why I get paid the big bucks.

138
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,853
- Yes.

139
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,793
- What's this?

140
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:48,763
- That is the solution to a
certain dilemma I'm having.

141
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,890
I'm always looking for new
connections in the underworld

142
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,320
someone who knows their
way around arms deals

143
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,763
and military specs,

144
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,773
which is why I couldn't resist
Miss Love's qualifications.

145
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,590
Yet, it was foolish of
me to welcome someone

146
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,243
whom I have never heard
of before, very foolish.

147
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,750
As it turns out,

148
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,485
Miss Love is not all she claims to be.

149
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,660
(ominous music)

150
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,713
Isn't that right?

151
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,560
- Look, I just came here for the money.

152
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,000
Have your employee evaluations
on somebody else's time.

153
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,523
- But that won't solve my problem.

154
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,990
You see, I've never heard of you either,

155
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,040
and that troubles me.

156
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:43,360
There's a reason I've never
spent time behind bars.

157
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,490
It's because I don't allow myself

158
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,083
to fool victim to traps.

159
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,919
(dramatic music)

160
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,502
(men groaning)

161
00:12:55,353 --> 00:12:56,270
So,

162
00:12:58,465 --> 00:13:00,900
I would like you to remove that pistol,

163
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,713
and fire a shot through Miss Love's head.

164
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:08,853
That will be hard to resist
by a man of your reputation,

165
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,653
presuming you are, in
fact, who you claim to be.

166
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,240
- This wasn't the deal.

167
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,190
- Pick up the gun,

168
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,673
or you don't have any deal.

169
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:25,995
Pick it up!

170
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,250
- I usually prefer to save
target practice for the weekends.

171
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,026
Guess, I'll have to make an exception.

172
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:39,143
(gun cocking)

173
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:42,143
(suspenseful music)

174
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:46,568
(gun clicking)

175
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,163
- How about that.

176
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,290
You might be interested to know

177
00:13:59,352 --> 00:14:02,587
that I recently acquired
one of these missiles.

178
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:07,240
I think, you'll find it's new
location quite disturbing.

179
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,150
(dramatic music)

180
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,960
You have to think globally
to succeed in business today.

181
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,700
Thanks to you guys the next
world power ignoring my demands

182
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,990
becomes an instant target for the militia.

183
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,630
- Satellites online, Mr. Nayo.

184
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,580
- Ah, that's great.

185
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:51,030
Well, thank you whoever you are.

186
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,470
Perhaps I could grant you a last request.

187
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,930
- Got a hacksaw?

188
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,763
- Hmm.

189
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,320
Enjoy your flight.

190
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,730
- You gave him real launch codes.

191
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,680
- If I gave him fakes and
he checked, we'd be dead.

192
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,960
- Oh, I see you plan
on living through this.

193
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,924
- Could be worse.

194
00:15:09,924 --> 00:15:12,674
(metal clanking)

195
00:15:15,265 --> 00:15:16,098
See.

196
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:26,765
(suspenseful music)

197
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:31,906
- Come on let's go!

198
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:38,796
(guns firing)

199
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:43,191
(gasping softly)

200
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:48,168
(people grunting)

201
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,778
(dramatic music)

202
00:16:06,055 --> 00:16:07,305
Go, go, go, go!

203
00:16:13,277 --> 00:16:15,860
(guns cocking)

204
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:35,111
- [Man] The car, hit the goddamn car.

205
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:37,611
(guns firing)

206
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:14,360
- That's never a good sign.

207
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,780
- What else you got in here?

208
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,220
- If we don't get to the codes in time,

209
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,950
can you turn this thing off?

210
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,813
- Turn offs, his department.

211
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,950
- We can handle it.

212
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,200
- [Jason] Come on let go.

213
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,270
- That's our getaway!

214
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,913
- Yeah, you push, I'll steer.

215
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,893
(truck engine revving)

216
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:45,232
- Cover me.

217
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,149
- I got ya.

218
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:54,301
- Come on, come on!

219
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:33,920
(tires screeching)

220
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,350
- [Joel] He's tagged, right?

221
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,550
- Yeah, in the cheesecake.

222
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,400
- You fed him the tracking cap.

223
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,820
Next time you cook me dinner
remind me to skip dessert.

224
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,440
- [Lena] I've never cooked you dinner.

225
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,886
- Yeah, but you wanted to.

226
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:45,670
- Can we just get the codes, please.

227
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,027
- Girl's in denial.

228
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,253
- [Lena] He's close,
Joel, can you step on it?

229
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:25,400
- [Joel] I've got it floored,
Lena, we're too heavy.

230
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,250
This stupid plow probably ways a ton.

231
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:30,547
- Plow.

232
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,670
- No, no, no, no, no!

233
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:43,659
Look out!
- Shit.

234
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:47,752
- Sorry.

235
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:52,049
- You're losing 'em.

236
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:53,005
Go right!

237
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:53,838
Go right!

238
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:59,244
(tires screeching)

239
00:19:59,244 --> 00:20:01,227
(alert beeping)

240
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:02,450
- What's that?

241
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,150
- Someone's in the command module.

242
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,774
- Shit, come on, move!

243
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:33,691
(tires screeching)

244
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:40,486
Loose those, idiots!

245
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:41,903
Come on move now!

246
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:47,714
- [Lena] They're getting away!

247
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:51,804
(tires screeching)

248
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:54,637
(missile hissing)

249
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:06,580
(tires screeching)

250
00:21:10,393 --> 00:21:12,170
- You can barely steer, Joel.

251
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,020
Stay on the road.

252
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,613
- Hey, could be worse.

253
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:27,047
- I wish you'd stop saying that.

254
00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:34,902
- Oh.

255
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:37,235
Whoa, ho, ho, look at those.

256
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:46,180
- [Lena] Oh, shit he's
going through the town.

257
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:55,442
(tires screeching)

258
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:57,955
- Move, move, move, move, move!

259
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:00,538
(horn honking)

260
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:04,317
(people yelling)

261
00:22:17,341 --> 00:22:19,091
- Get out of the way!

262
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:21,289
- Shit.

263
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:26,264
- [Man] Asshole!

264
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:30,265
(people yelling)

265
00:22:31,777 --> 00:22:34,694
(tires screeching)

266
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,490
- Lose those idiots!

267
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,647
(people screaming)

268
00:22:49,157 --> 00:22:50,324
- Jesus!

269
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:54,376
(people yelling)

270
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:01,902
(tires screeching)

271
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:06,902
- Lose them.

272
00:23:07,378 --> 00:23:10,378
(car horns honking)

273
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:17,130
Good.

274
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,670
- Uh.

275
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,636
- Let me guess.

276
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:22,570
- Uh, these brakes aren't feeling so good.

277
00:23:35,054 --> 00:23:37,971
(car honk honking)

278
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:40,487
(people gasping)

279
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,645
(dramatic music)

280
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:44,145
- [Nayo] Oh, shit!

281
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,393
- [Joel] They might still be alive.

282
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:06,377
(train horn blaring)

283
00:24:21,823 --> 00:24:23,720
- There's no rush really.

284
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,109
- The codes.

285
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:28,343
(dramatic music)

286
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,290
(alert beeping)

287
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,450
- [Derek] You close over there?

288
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,693
- No, why?

289
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,683
- We're toast.

290
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,860
- I'm gonna need to see your
license and registration

291
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,803
and what's in the caboose?

292
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,663
- Got it!

293
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:07,364
The last digit's burned off.

294
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:10,781
(missile alert chirping)

295
00:25:14,942 --> 00:25:16,613
(suspenseful music)

296
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:20,030
(missile roaring loudly)

297
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:24,840
(missile powering down)

298
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:27,983
- What'd you do?

299
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:35,652
(gentle music)

300
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,710
- I trust everyone here heard about

301
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,130
the Bishop munitions theft in Utah.

302
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,560
The space stores a fairly
eclectic supply of hardware.

303
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,603
We'd like it back.

304
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,540
In your files you'll find a
manifest of missing items.

305
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,460
I'd like you to feed it to your

306
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,670
underground sources right away.

307
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,520
Yesterday I received a phone call from the

308
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,263
Dimina Humanitarian Committee
in Southern Cambodia.

309
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,100
Next slide please.

310
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,223
This field was next on their list.

311
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,210
As you can see, gentlemen,
we have a gopher,

312
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,670
and the gopher walked off with
the contents of those mines.

313
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,630
Unfortunately, those contents
were not ordinary stock.

314
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,960
It seems that it is now
common practice in Cambodia

315
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,710
to lace the charge with dioxide.

316
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,240
In case anyone here doesn't
know what dioxide is.

317
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,290
It is a chemical 20 times
more lethal than cyanide.

318
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,640
Considering the dose that would come

319
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,680
from a field of that size,

320
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,430
I would say we have our hands full.

321
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,050
I want everyone in this room

322
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:36,463
to make this their top priority.

323
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,177
I want this juice found fast.

324
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:43,510
I want the culprits ass
bounced into prison.

325
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,120
Is everyone clear?

326
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,953
- [Group] Yes.

327
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:47,140
- Are there any questions?

328
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,380
Thank you, gentlemen, your dismissed.

329
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,953
Colonel McKay.

330
00:26:53,884 --> 00:26:55,423
Would you mind staying a moment, please?

331
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:05,709
(door creaking)

332
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,670
Leonard Nayo turned up yesterday.

333
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,173
Flame broiled.

334
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,760
Apparently, he ran into some car trouble

335
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,830
in the Austrian mountains.

336
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,323
Care to add anything to that?

337
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,323
- No, sir.

338
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,993
- When you came to us
after the accident, McKay,

339
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,913
we made an agreement.

340
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,220
Central allowed you to raise those kids,

341
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,980
train them under our
protection in an effort

342
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,090
to create a covert
alternative when needed.

343
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,930
You got the most sophisticated hardware,

344
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,970
confidential access,

345
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,890
complete absence of any red tape.

346
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,393
In return, we got names, photos,

347
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,400
and all the hard intelligence
necessary to prosecute.

348
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,520
- That agreement stands.

349
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
- Not when dead bodies start turning up.

350
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,533
- Accidents happen.

351
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,230
- Come on, McKay.

352
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,933
Moral boundaries are being
crossed here, and you know it.

353
00:28:07,924 --> 00:28:10,670
Now I don't wanna lose the
assistance of your team,

354
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,600
but I will not have them exacting revenge

355
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,480
on every horrible bastard
they happen to cross.

356
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,400
If there's an investigation,

357
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,330
I think, we both know the
President will be implicated.

358
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,550
I understand that they're victims,

359
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,200
and that's the main reason
why I've supported them.

360
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,490
But, you need to make something
perfectly clear to them.

361
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,030
They are not, I repeat not,

362
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,263
the final solution.

363
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,613
- I will.

364
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,396
- Good, now that, that is out of the way,

365
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:45,420
I wanna talk to you about
having your team come in

366
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,884
on some of these more critical matters.

367
00:28:47,884 --> 00:28:50,634
(dramatic music)

368
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,570
We could use the help.

369
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,683
- I'm listening.

370
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,130
- [President] It's a routine
babysitting job, McKay.

371
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,290
Bunch of high profile
types heading to Japan

372
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,250
for some economic summit.

373
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,810
They requested our best protection.

374
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,803
I'm assigning you.

375
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,430
Look, just keep your eyes open,

376
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,350
and keep 'em safe, understand?

377
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,180
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.

378
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:05,770
(computer beeping)

379
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,490
Good morning, I trust
you're all well and rested.

380
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,980
You've seen the material before you,

381
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,063
so let's get to it.

382
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,750
I'd like to focus on
these missing land mines,

383
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,670
assuming someone is out to transfer

384
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,250
the dioxide into something else.

385
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,850
Considering the hardware
stolen from Bishop,

386
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,090
that threat becomes very real.

387
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,300
There's no evidence, however,

388
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,900
linking these two so find some.

389
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,980
Central has granted us
full access to both CIA

390
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,650
and Secret Service profiles.

391
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,800
The clock prevents any
type of in depth study,

392
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,530
so your best leads are
gonna come from field work,

393
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,460
locations, names.

394
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,200
I'll expect an immediate update

395
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,320
the moment you think you're warm.

396
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,980
Then I'll supply support,

397
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,430
and we'll take it from there.

398
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,233
Before I go, I've been
asked to pass on a message.

399
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,730
Our objective is counter-terrorism.

400
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,413
We are not mercenaries.

401
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,050
No more Leonard Nayos.

402
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,343
You're pissing off Washington, understood?

403
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,450
- [Group] Yes, sir.

404
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,950
- One more thing.

405
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,670
Colonel Tate has been called
away on mandatory duty.

406
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,970
His duty Rachel will be
your pilot until he returns.

407
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,440
Make her feel at home.

408
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,583
- By all means.

409
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,053
- Hmm.

410
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,733
- As always do your best.

411
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,243
Come back alive.

412
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,200
(sighing heavily)

413
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,660
- Next time that guy comes on,

414
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,050
somebody change the channel, all right.

415
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,164
- He meant it this time.

416
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:40,650
I think, McKay is sick
of hearing ultimatums.

417
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,730
- And I'm sick of hearing threats.

418
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,400
What do they think we do
sit around throwing darts

419
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,100
at a list of people we're gonna eliminate.

420
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,190
They should be happy we're on their side.

421
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,490
- Alright, let's not get ugly.

422
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,070
We've been through this.

423
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,020
McKay's the only person
we take orders from

424
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,870
same goes from threats.

425
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,020
- About that homework, any leads?

426
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,150
- Nothing solid, I stuck
with Eastern groups mostly.

427
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:06,360
South Korea, Hong Kong, called
a few contacts nothing hit.

428
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,720
I also did a manpower breakdown.

429
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,750
You know, with the time span
in relation to the location

430
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,550
of each theft, you can
eliminate a few groups

431
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,380
who couldn't have
physically pulled it off.

432
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,730
- You're scaring me, bro.

433
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,110
- You got a better idea?

434
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,680
- Yeah, maybe.

435
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,320
I'm looking at this
manifest of missing items,

436
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,810
and there's a mistake
there's a picture here

437
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,913
that's supposed to be 12 Hawk missiles.

438
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:28,810
The missiles pictured
there have eight tail fins.

439
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,360
Hawks can only have six.

440
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,750
- So what are they?

441
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,583
- Harpoons.

442
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,345
Details I tell ya it's a curse.

443
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:40,890
- You know, harpoons are
only used on battleships.

444
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,520
- Is anyone missing one of those?

445
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,330
- Short range, surface to
air defense missiles, lovely.

446
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,763
- There are mothball
fleets all over the world.

447
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,380
Dozens of battleships just sitting around

448
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,820
that's where I'd start.

449
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,800
- Yeah, but how many of
those can launch harpoons?

450
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,550
- Well, this shows a navel
graveyard in Argentina with one

451
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,620
and one on the Black Sea that's closer.

452
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,760
- Black Sea?

453
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,640
- Surf.

454
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,840
- I, uh, think you'll be disappointed.

455
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,310
Besides how about we
find the harpoons first,

456
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,503
stop a catastrophe.

457
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,460
- You know, Ashe works over there now.

458
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:18,240
Maybe I should stop by,
catch up on old times.

459
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,203
- Well bring mice.

460
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,800
Snakes like mice.

461
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,247
(dramatic music)

462
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:28,497
(plane engine revving)

463
00:33:44,763 --> 00:33:46,950
- Few in the high-tech
world of computer gaming

464
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,380
can match the success of my next guest.

465
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,270
Demanding, unscrupulous in
his quest for supremacy,

466
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,810
and some might even say spoiled

467
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:57,180
by his meteoric rise to the top,

468
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,860
please welcome Tanner Gold.

469
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,910
- [Tanner] Wow, thank you.

470
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,230
- Tanner, how do you explain

471
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,790
the incredible success of your games?

472
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:10,790
- Well, games, I think, are
a validation of humanity.

473
00:34:10,986 --> 00:34:13,610
They challenge your mind,
your physical endurance.

474
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:17,160
They force you to trust
in yourself and in others.

475
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,620
They allow us to have experiences

476
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,600
that most likely we could never have.

477
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,400
- For example, most of us could never

478
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,300
triumphantly command a
battleship through enemy waters,

479
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,060
and yet with your latest
creation, Fleet Command,

480
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,570
that wish comes true.

481
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,890
- Exactly.

482
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,898
Although with the time I
spent designing this game

483
00:34:35,898 --> 00:34:38,640
I think, I could command a battleship.

484
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,050
- [Host] It gets that specific.

485
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,190
- Oh, yeah, my games
are insanely realistic.

486
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,810
That's what the players
most, a real experience.

487
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,360
- Well, they will indeed be excited

488
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,290
when they find out that
the actual battleship

489
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,330
that you used to design this game

490
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,200
will be on display this week

491
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,770
when Fleet Command makes its world premier

492
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,980
at the International Comdex
Convention in Athens.

493
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,751
- Well, we got to get it there first.

494
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,080
- (chuckling) Once we get it there.

495
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,250
Now this is an event that hundreds

496
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,370
of thousands of people will be attending.

497
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,140
It's one I don't think you'll wanna miss.

498
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,960
Now we'll be right back with more of our

499
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,310
conversation with Tanner
Gold in just a moment.

500
00:35:14,152 --> 00:35:16,595
(children chatting)

501
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:17,623
- [Woman On Television] Jack.

502
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,850
(soft knocking on door)

503
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:23,310
You know, when I said I
wanted to have dinner,

504
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,807
I was hoping that included
dinner conversation as well.

505
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:30,700
- [Jack] Sorry, I'm being a jerk, huh?

506
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,533
- Oh.

507
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:33,724
Hi.

508
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:36,950
Thank you.

509
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,294
It's fine.

510
00:35:38,294 --> 00:35:39,610
(throat clearing)

511
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,743
Oh, excuse me.

512
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:46,563
(suspenseful music)

513
00:36:11,654 --> 00:36:14,170
(birds chirping)

514
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,090
- I'm sure you know a lot
about this ship, Mr. Gold,

515
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,523
but keep in mind she's
not dressed for battle.

516
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,663
So try to avoid any hostile forces.

517
00:36:22,736 --> 00:36:23,823
- Hostile forces.

518
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,823
Oh, this must be Captain Stevens.

519
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,033
- Captain Rook Hall.

520
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:38,343
- Uh, Tanner Gold.

521
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,100
- I'm afraid Captain Stevens

522
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,800
had a reaction to some medication.

523
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,850
I'll be taking this place.

524
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,010
- Oh, that's too bad.

525
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,810
I was looking forward to
meeting Captain Stevens.

526
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,220
- Is this her?

527
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,053
- Yes, sir.

528
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,810
Seen better days, of course.

529
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,560
But for this sort of
show-and-tell type stuff,

530
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,248
she'll get the job done.

531
00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:01,081
- Good.

532
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:14,615
(dramatic rock music)

533
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,810
Verify coordinates right away.

534
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,732
So what do you think?

535
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:30,100
- Oh, I think, my fans are gonna get

536
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,373
a big kick out of this.

537
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,863
My games are my life.

538
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,090
- You wanna take us out of here?

539
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,840
- No, I.

540
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,833
- You know how.

541
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,453
- Right, yeah.

542
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,883
This is cool.

543
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:52,539
(upbeat music)

544
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,067
(telephone ringing)

545
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:54,931
- Engine room.

546
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:55,843
- Slow ahead.

547
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:57,325
- Aye, sir, slow ahead.

548
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:58,242
Slow ahead!

549
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,510
(engine hissing)

550
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:09,017
(machine beeping)

551
00:38:24,411 --> 00:38:27,661
(boat whistle blowing)

552
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:33,815
(birds chirping)

553
00:38:37,072 --> 00:38:39,030
- [Elaine] Off to save the world again?

554
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,426
- Yes.

555
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:41,890
- You know, I am beginning
to think there is

556
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,270
a red cape underneath
that uniform of yours.

557
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,150
- Oh, well, maybe.

558
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,890
Although, I have stopped leaping

559
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,170
tall buildings in a single bound.

560
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,380
- Yes, but are you still
faster than a speeding bullet?

561
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,218
- Depends on what you have in mind.

562
00:38:55,218 --> 00:38:57,450
(chuckling softly)

563
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,910
- Here's the material for tomorrow.

564
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,410
I know you hate interviews,

565
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,020
but this one's important.

566
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,123
So, don't let me down.

567
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,122
I'll fax you the flight information.

568
00:39:07,122 --> 00:39:09,872
(dramatic music)

569
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:17,120
(birds chirping)

570
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,470
- Washington just granted clearance,

571
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,620
so let's take a look at the inventory.

572
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,950
Hasn't changed much in the past few years.

573
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,143
A couple of ships moved up
from South Africa a while back.

574
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,343
Of course, we had an old
ship leave here yesterday.

575
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,830
This wealthy fellow called in a favor

576
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,280
he had coming from your
defense department.

577
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,580
They supplied full clearance for the move.

578
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,730
Should be docking in
Athens sometime today.

579
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,030
- Where'd the crew come from?

580
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,340
- Navy, stationed here.

581
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,750
But the captain was
flown in from the States.

582
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,650
Stayed at the hotel just down the way.

583
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,210
- [Lena] Any weapons onboard?

584
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,260
- On the Exeter, no
nothing, a few small arms,

585
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,780
but she's still a bucket of bolts.

586
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,530
I don't even think the stove works.

587
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,280
Why, is there a problem?

588
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,830
- Uh, can we make copies of these?

589
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:03,663
- Yeah, sure.

590
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,280
- Where'd you say that hotel was?

591
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,050
- Whale watching.

592
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,483
You probably wanna look behind us.

593
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,860
When I was designing Fleet Command,

594
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,680
I learned that whales and
dolphins use boats like this,

595
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,050
like tour guides, seriously, sharks too.

596
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,420
Ah, that's all on the 64-bit version.

597
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,420
I'll get you a copy.

598
00:40:36,418 --> 00:40:38,280
Now what are these monkeys doing.

599
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,370
Probably filming a beer
commercial or something.

600
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,860
Report their asses to the Coast Guard.

601
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,310
Athens Port Harbor this is...

602
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,630
They're not supposed to be here.

603
00:40:52,403 --> 00:40:53,984
(gun cocking)

604
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,484
(tense music)

605
00:41:07,464 --> 00:41:10,302
- Hit the brakes.

606
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:11,135
Now.

607
00:41:46,181 --> 00:41:49,264
(gun firing rapidly)

608
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,717
(alarm buzzing)

609
00:42:20,682 --> 00:42:23,515
(sailor groaning)

610
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:42,316
- Come on get up.

611
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:58,772
- Go, go, go.

612
00:42:58,772 --> 00:43:01,639
Starboard side clear, awaiting orders.

613
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:05,495
(helicopter blades roaring)

614
00:43:05,495 --> 00:43:07,662
- On the deck now!
- Move.

615
00:43:08,814 --> 00:43:10,865
- Don't move!
- Keep quiet.

616
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:15,032
- [Hijacker] Keep your
hands behind your head now.

617
00:43:33,776 --> 00:43:36,609
(dramatic music)

618
00:43:51,093 --> 00:43:52,389
- [Avi] Clear this area over here.

619
00:43:52,389 --> 00:43:54,540
- [Man] Yes, sir.

620
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,350
- You must be Tanner Gold.

621
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,920
I enjoy your video games.

622
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,350
They're inspiring.

623
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,650
- What do you think you're doing.

624
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,700
- [Man] Keep your eyes open.

625
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,750
- I'll be borrowing this ship
for a few hours, Mr. Gold.

626
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,490
But don't you worry you'll have it back

627
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,124
in time for your big entrance,

628
00:44:08,124 --> 00:44:09,774
and it's gonna be spectacular.

629
00:44:09,774 --> 00:44:12,700
(chuckling softly)

630
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,690
But, first, I have to
cure it of its impotence.

631
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:18,290
Rock, take him back to the
bridge and get us moving.

632
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:24,224
Dear Brother,

633
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,053
and you said this would be the hard part.

634
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,760
How long do you need?

635
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,910
- A few hours.
- Okay.

636
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,422
(dramatic music)

637
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:45,680
- Full speed ahead, Game Boy.

638
00:44:47,631 --> 00:44:50,131
(gun cocking)

639
00:44:52,446 --> 00:44:55,029
(bell ringing)

640
00:44:58,926 --> 00:45:01,509
(bell tolling)

641
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,213
- Gentlemen.

642
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,980
Whatever strategies are racing through

643
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,393
your simple minds right now forget them.

644
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:12,453
Resist our orders and you'll be killed.

645
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,343
I don't tolerate adversity too well.

646
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,680
Consider that fair warning.

647
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:26,961
(dramatic music)

648
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:31,689
Like clockwork.

649
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:56,702
(upbeat music)

650
00:46:21,575 --> 00:46:25,825
(man speaking in foreign language)

651
00:46:34,937 --> 00:46:36,988
- What do you want?

652
00:46:36,988 --> 00:46:39,905
(intercom buzzing)

653
00:46:43,415 --> 00:46:44,248
Upstairs.

654
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,560
- You can have the thing back, Adrian.

655
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,463
I don't know how to fly a helicopter.

656
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,590
I need collateral I can use

657
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,950
like a house or a casino.

658
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,610
You've got plenty of those, don't you?

659
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,300
I'm gonna give you till next week

660
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,410
to come up with something

661
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,070
or I'm gonna sell your gun ship

662
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,530
to your little Mexican friend.

663
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:25,280
Now how would you like that?
- Now I'll tell you something!

664
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,240
It's a six million dollars a unit.

665
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,470
- No, I didn't think so.

666
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,962
Talk to ya.

667
00:47:30,962 --> 00:47:34,462
(Adrian yelling on phone)

668
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:37,013
Well, well, well.

669
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,083
Look at you.

670
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,958
Pretty fly for a white guy.

671
00:47:43,958 --> 00:47:45,878
- How you been, Ashe?

672
00:47:45,878 --> 00:47:46,711
- Hmm.

673
00:47:50,841 --> 00:47:52,993
- [Joel] Thought our
deal was no more outlaws.

674
00:47:53,894 --> 00:47:56,810
- Uh-uh, just tying up a few loose ends.

675
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,423
This is last year's business.

676
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,073
I'm legit now, I promise.

677
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,760
You still wearing diapers,
or can I make you a drink?

678
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,263
- If this was a social visit, maybe.

679
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,240
- Well, then let's make it social.

680
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,450
- What's hot right now?

681
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,550
- Telecommunications.

682
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,870
The whole world's wired up to the web.

683
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,960
You ain't got game
unless you got a domain.

684
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,670
You know what I'm sayin'?

685
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:35,253
- Right, but that's not
what I'm talking about.

686
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,270
I'm sure even a legit name like yourself

687
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,450
still gets calls on occasion,

688
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,570
commodities only a select few can afford,

689
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:44,943
like most of your clients.

690
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:48,100
- Ex-clients.

691
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:48,963
- Of course.

692
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,450
- You just love to get me
in trouble, don't you J?

693
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:54,950
- I prevent trouble, remember?

694
00:49:09,273 --> 00:49:12,280
If you bought anything on
that list making the rounds,

695
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,113
you let me know.

696
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,023
I need some names.

697
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:16,863
Who's buying right now?

698
00:49:16,863 --> 00:49:18,510
Who's moving the money?

699
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:19,610
If you can help, Ashe,

700
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:22,853
anything, I'd appreciate it.

701
00:49:25,217 --> 00:49:26,050
- Look.

702
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,200
Don't think I disrespect
what you guys did for me,

703
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,810
and I know I owe you one.

704
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,310
And if I had anything, J,

705
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,563
I would give it to you, but I don't.

706
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,979
(lively music)

707
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,980
- I've seen puddles with bigger waves.

708
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,250
- There's a low dribbler.

709
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,560
- Hey, got good news.

710
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,040
You get to go play.

711
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,300
- Where?

712
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,380
- Ship left here yesterday.

713
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,500
I need you to see if it's
the one we're looking for.

714
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,750
Jason and I are gonna stay
here and check things out.

715
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,470
Alright, just a quick on off thing.

716
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:09,930
Drop in, ride it for a while,

717
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,540
and check for bad guys.

718
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,737
You up for that?

719
00:50:12,737 --> 00:50:14,990
- If it's on water, we can ride it.

720
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:16,363
- Alright, you be careful.

721
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:19,343
- Awe, group hug.

722
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,833
Come on.

723
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,390
So they taking the ship?

724
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,930
- Yeah.

725
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,160
- You guys get any bad vibes out there

726
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,040
you just give us a call,

727
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,450
and we'll come get you, okay.

728
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:32,739
None of that wonder twins stuff.

729
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,770
- Huh, that's original.

730
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:35,853
- Yeah, nice shirts.

731
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:39,370
- (sighing) Let's do a spot check.

732
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,430
- Just name the spot.

733
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:52,977
- [Man] Bellhop, Bellhop.

734
00:50:56,828 --> 00:50:59,245
- Oh, welcome can I help you?

735
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,610
- Andre, you sure could buddy.

736
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:05,175
Could you take a giant step to your right?

737
00:51:05,175 --> 00:51:06,008
- Sure.

738
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:09,243
- Excuse me.

739
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,163
Thanks, doll.

740
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,650
- Can I help you?

741
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:19,963
- Well, I sure hope so.

742
00:51:23,529 --> 00:51:26,279
(dramatic music)

743
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,470
- [Avi] This everyone?

744
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:35,900
- All crew accounted for, sir.

745
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,010
- Good.

746
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,220
And if one of them blinks the
wrong way, don't hesitate.

747
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,053
- Yes, sir.

748
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:48,550
(machine beeping)

749
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:49,500
- How are we doing?

750
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:54,490
- [Brother] Target range in one hour.

751
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,610
- And the cargo?

752
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,770
- Getting change over right now.

753
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,710
It will take me a while
to get your remote set.

754
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,010
But we will have ample time to evacuate.

755
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:05,100
- Your prison education
sure came in handy.

756
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,600
(brother sighing heavily)

757
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,230
You doubt this effort, don't you?

758
00:52:13,438 --> 00:52:14,271
Well don't.

759
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,020
Doubt invites weakness,

760
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,651
and weakness invites disaster.

761
00:52:19,651 --> 00:52:22,401
(dramatic music)

762
00:52:27,683 --> 00:52:30,660
(gentle music)

763
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,440
- So did you actually see
Captain Stevens check out?

764
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,483
- No, I didn't.

765
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,443
- Do you think you could
maybe show me the room?

766
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,433
- Andre.

767
00:52:47,433 --> 00:52:49,190
I'm going on break.

768
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:50,390
Can you cover?

769
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:51,223
- [Andre] Sure.

770
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:58,508
(birds chirping)

771
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:09,953
- Nice view.

772
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,540
Take it easy.

773
00:53:15,606 --> 00:53:17,689
- I only have 20 minutes.

774
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,030
- Look, I just, uh...

775
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,133
Oh, hell.

776
00:53:27,053 --> 00:53:28,083
- Your body.

777
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,703
- Yeah, I've been sweating to the oldies.

778
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,283
- I'll be right back.

779
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:47,880
Take off all your clothes.

780
00:53:54,893 --> 00:53:56,226
- God, this job.

781
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:04,317
(eerie ominous music)

782
00:54:13,156 --> 00:54:16,650
Well, this looks like a
fetish even beyond me,

783
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:17,996
so I'm just gonna.

784
00:54:17,996 --> 00:54:21,279
(tense music)

785
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:23,762
Okay.

786
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:26,345
(men grunting)

787
00:54:47,558 --> 00:54:51,981
Guys, don't start something
you can't (grunting).

788
00:54:51,981 --> 00:54:54,814
(dramatic music)

789
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:11,240
- It's getting way too
hot out there, Ashe.

790
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:14,260
Being on the 10 most wanted list

791
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:17,160
is a badge of honor to most of these guys.

792
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,200
Go online you can buy
nukes by the six pack.

793
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,943
An angry hacker, one
guy, can shut down NASA.

794
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:26,240
I don't get it.

795
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,403
- You don't get it.

796
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:30,683
Shit.

797
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,223
Look at what drives you.

798
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,513
I don't know where your
vendetta comes from, J.

799
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,010
That little avenger you have
stomping around your heart

800
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,670
he's in the heart of all your enemies too.

801
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,070
Trust me.

802
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:48,070
Badness is gonna be around long
after you leave this planet.

803
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,063
And when you fight,

804
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,570
there's always gonna be somebody there

805
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:54,340
that pities your opponent,

806
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:59,120
and with pity they gain support and grow.

807
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,703
(gentle music)

808
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,030
- Then I'd better get back to work.

809
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:12,070
You know where to find me.

810
00:56:31,048 --> 00:56:33,715
(ominous music)

811
00:56:49,966 --> 00:56:54,966
(suspenseful music)
(men groaning)

812
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,756
(man grunting)

813
00:57:21,881 --> 00:57:24,464
(guns cocking)

814
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:39,762
(man grunting)

815
00:58:14,192 --> 00:58:15,025
- Joel!

816
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,120
- [Woman] Destroy contents.

817
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:22,953
Goodbye.

818
00:58:25,378 --> 00:58:27,545
- What's that on the roof?

819
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:33,395
(gun firing)

820
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:51,155
- Hang on!

821
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,352
(suspenseful music)

822
00:58:57,352 --> 00:59:00,269
(tires screeching)

823
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,013
- Ex-clients of yours?

824
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,460
Can we park this thing?

825
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,910
We're sitting ducks out here.

826
00:59:38,104 --> 00:59:40,521
(gun firing)

827
00:59:56,278 --> 00:59:59,695
(people yelling angrily)

828
01:00:16,631 --> 01:00:19,214
(men grunting)

829
01:00:23,979 --> 01:00:24,979
- [Man] Hey!

830
01:00:46,752 --> 01:00:49,169
(gun firing)

831
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:15,380
- Hey, not too much, man.

832
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,680
She didn't even get naked.

833
01:01:19,992 --> 01:01:22,260
(chuckling softly)

834
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,310
- Before I rip out your tongue

835
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:27,113
and stick it down your throat, let's chat.

836
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:43,880
Torture comes second
nature to me, little man.

837
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:46,530
So tell us why you are here?

838
01:01:48,603 --> 01:01:50,977
Or I start cutting things off.

839
01:01:50,977 --> 01:01:52,421
(dramatic music)

840
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:53,929
- You could start with the ropes.

841
01:01:53,929 --> 01:01:55,679
That'd be a big help.

842
01:02:03,462 --> 01:02:04,595
- Enough.

843
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:05,428
- No.

844
01:02:05,428 --> 01:02:07,475
(speaking in foreign language)

845
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:09,054
(men grunting)

846
01:02:09,054 --> 01:02:12,054
(suspenseful music)

847
01:02:24,363 --> 01:02:26,503
- Have you seen anything
strange around here?

848
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,500
- Oh, nice, trying for the pool?

849
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,300
- Yeah, just put this all on my bill.

850
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,650
Andre will take care of it.

851
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,460
- Gee, you think we're onto something?

852
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:47,600
- Yeah, the chick at the front test

853
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,730
is totally into the group thing.

854
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:49,830
Let's get out of here.

855
01:03:06,803 --> 01:03:08,228
(intercom beeping)

856
01:03:08,228 --> 01:03:09,200
- [Man] Listen up.

857
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,090
Avi, wants those dead
bodies thrown overboard,

858
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:13,080
and all the supplies up on deck.

859
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,570
- [Man] Let's go, come on.

860
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:15,670
- [Keith] Extreme, eh?

861
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,483
- Stupid thing.

862
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,163
- What's up?

863
01:03:27,022 --> 01:03:28,698
(machine beeping)

864
01:03:28,698 --> 01:03:29,698
The signal's jammed?

865
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,050
- Wanna stay or bail?

866
01:03:33,305 --> 01:03:34,788
(gun cocking)

867
01:03:34,788 --> 01:03:37,371
(man grunting)

868
01:03:47,536 --> 01:03:49,870
- Time for a disguise.

869
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:51,520
Something's up on this ship.

870
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,700
I'm going inside.

871
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,623
- I'll go see what's blocking our signal.

872
01:04:01,407 --> 01:04:02,852
- Ugly tattoo, bro.

873
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:04,531
(computer keyboard clicking)

874
01:04:04,531 --> 01:04:06,973
- It was kind of like
a pissed off elephant.

875
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,370
- Okay, I'll just put elephant.

876
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:15,497
You have sort of a coconut
scent thing going on.

877
01:04:15,497 --> 01:04:17,800
Wonder what you landed in?

878
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,920
It's not bad.

879
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,720
- It's working for ya, huh?

880
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,330
I think, the label's stuck to my back.

881
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:24,070
Maybe you could check that out later.

882
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:24,903
- Hmm.

883
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:29,623
- This one.

884
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:33,537
Does that look familiar to you?

885
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:35,223
- No.

886
01:04:35,223 --> 01:04:38,110
(keyboard clicking)

887
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,227
This can't be right it's an access glitch.

888
01:04:41,623 --> 01:04:43,523
- I know I've seen that somewhere before.

889
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,370
- Hmm, I'm gonna call it in.

890
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,306
Maybe McKay can bring it up.

891
01:04:48,306 --> 01:04:51,723
(computer alert beeping)

892
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:56,925
- Yes, Lena.

893
01:04:56,925 --> 01:04:58,320
- Colonel, I'm here with Jason.

894
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,930
We're accessing a profile
directory, IDing a tattoo.

895
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:02,450
But we're getting shut out.

896
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:04,240
I thought we had complete access.

897
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,600
I'm in commute right now,
Lena, away from my computer.

898
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,740
Do you have it there?

899
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,840
- I'm sending it, sir.

900
01:05:09,963 --> 01:05:12,880
(computer beeping)

901
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,710
Where did this come from?

902
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,733
- Possible suspect on the pearl theft.

903
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,920
- Let's get everyone back onboard, Lena.

904
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,560
We'll wait until I return to Washington

905
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,300
to pursue this any further.

906
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,940
I'll speak to you Monday.

907
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,270
- Oh, wait we're through?

908
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:33,860
- Until further notice, yes.

909
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,510
- Sir, we're making progress.

910
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,220
- There's a mistake on
the weapons manifest we--

911
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,860
- Are you two not hearing me clearly?

912
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,640
This mission is through, abort it.

913
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,930
You're ordered to cease
any further investigation.

914
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:45,500
Is that clear?

915
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,333
- Yes, sir.

916
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,310
- Yes, sir.

917
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:50,163
- Go home.

918
01:05:51,078 --> 01:05:53,828
(dramatic music)

919
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,051
- I'll signal to Joel and the twins.

920
01:05:58,051 --> 01:06:00,884
(machine beeping)

921
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,240
- It's not what you think, Joel.

922
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,850
I would never set you up.

923
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,133
- Sure, you would.

924
01:06:14,133 --> 01:06:15,290
(gun cocking)

925
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:16,123
Who are they?

926
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,216
- They came to me a few
weeks back when they heard

927
01:06:19,216 --> 01:06:21,640
that I was the broker for
the missing land mines.

928
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,970
- [Joel] Dioxide.

929
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,283
- I know, I know, I lied.

930
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,083
But I was dead if I said anything.

931
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,360
Ever since I finished in Steele,

932
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,380
they've just been watching me.

933
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:32,620
Every move I make.

934
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:34,610
Every person I meet.

935
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,712
- Do you know their target?

936
01:06:36,712 --> 01:06:37,879
- They just...

937
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,050
They used to pick money syllables, power.

938
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:43,960
- Used to, what they have a track record?

939
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,330
- They're professionals.

940
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:46,840
They made a big splash in '87.

941
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,490
Took down an airliner filled
with computer mavericks,

942
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:50,763
industrial hot shots.

943
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,793
Nobody survived, but it took
its toll on the world market.

944
01:06:53,793 --> 01:06:55,153
That was their plan.

945
01:06:56,104 --> 01:06:58,854
(dramatic music)

946
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,820
The leader was wiped out
by a covert hit team.

947
01:07:02,820 --> 01:07:04,220
But the two sons...

948
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,070
The two sons they got
nailed for the crash.

949
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,470
They were sentenced to life in prison,

950
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:12,030
but they're out now and they're angry.

951
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:14,490
So if you wanna pull
that trigger, go ahead.

952
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,140
Because with the watch
dogs they have on me,

953
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:17,866
I'm as good as gone.

954
01:07:17,866 --> 01:07:20,866
(cellphone beeping)

955
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:24,800
- We just got dropped.

956
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,550
Kay what's everyone back.

957
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:27,383
- I'll be in.

958
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:30,650
You're coming with me.

959
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,250
I want everything you know.

960
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,930
If one word sounds like bullshit,

961
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,203
so help me, Ashe.

962
01:07:44,692 --> 01:07:46,130
- I'm not trying to talk
you out of anything,

963
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,450
but you know McKay's temper.

964
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:50,100
He's not gonna be cool with this.

965
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:54,170
- Look, Keith and Derek
are still out there.

966
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,590
I'm not just gonna pick up and go home.

967
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:57,810
- They didn't come in?

968
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:58,860
- I can't reach them.

969
01:08:00,353 --> 01:08:01,633
(sighing) You.

970
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:04,670
I knew you'd be linked to this.

971
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:07,060
You truly amaze me, woman.

972
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,220
- Well, there's a simple task.

973
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:09,863
- Whoa, Rachel.

974
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:12,550
Would you please escort our guest here

975
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:15,243
to less hostile quarters.

976
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:24,370
I know why we've been called in.

977
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:26,350
- Doesn't matter McKay just balled us out.

978
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,340
Gave us orders--

979
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:28,973
- And we'll follow orders.

980
01:08:36,814 --> 01:08:39,564
(dramatic music)

981
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,900
McKay's always told us
concentrate your anger

982
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:47,170
on preventing further acts of terrorism.

983
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:48,333
Save others the grief.

984
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,730
He assured us that even though the group

985
01:08:50,730 --> 01:08:52,483
behind our attack was eliminated,

986
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,253
hundreds of others just
as powerful still exist.

987
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,910
And that's why we do this, right?

988
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,060
That's our foundation.

989
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:03,873
But, uh,

990
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:06,961
I don't think it's entirely true.

991
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:10,300
The group we're tracking,

992
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:12,593
these battleship guys,

993
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,220
are the same ones behind Flight 770.

994
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,887
(ominous music)

995
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:22,283
They're back.

996
01:09:25,124 --> 01:09:27,874
(dramatic music)

997
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:44,221
- The tattoo.

998
01:09:45,445 --> 01:09:46,641
(dramatic music)

999
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:48,830
There that morning I saw one of 'em.

1000
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,340
- Well, we have to tell McKay.

1001
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:52,310
- He knows, Joel, that's
why he pulled us in.

1002
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,810
- No, we have to tell
him to let us finish.

1003
01:09:54,810 --> 01:09:57,250
We've all seen what these people can do.

1004
01:09:57,250 --> 01:09:58,280
He can explain to Griffin.

1005
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:00,950
- Griffin wouldn't send us
if we were his last resort.

1006
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:03,230
He'd see this as a mercenary mission.

1007
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,853
McKay is protecting us.

1008
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,371
- Hold on where do you think you're going.

1009
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,310
- One of my skills is
professional counter-terrorists.

1010
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:12,634
Have a nice day.

1011
01:10:12,634 --> 01:10:15,467
- (chuckling) No.

1012
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:23,610
This shouldn't be different
than any other mission.

1013
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:24,540
I'm calling in.

1014
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,410
- Cool, you call McKay.

1015
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:28,200
I'm going after Keith and Derek.

1016
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,920
- Until we get new orders,

1017
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,860
you're not going anywhere.

1018
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,920
- Stop me.

1019
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:34,520
- Jason!

1020
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,570
- You're gonna take 'em all alone, Turbo.

1021
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:45,393
Don't confirm my doubts
of your sanity, Jason!

1022
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,527
Oh, no, you don't.

1023
01:10:49,527 --> 01:10:51,877
You wanna share a cell
with G.I. Joe out there?

1024
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:01,344
Ugh!

1025
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:02,177
Ugh!

1026
01:11:03,614 --> 01:11:05,440
(dramatic music)

1027
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,233
- So is this a permanent dark side?

1028
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:13,060
Look, if you're on a rescue
mission, that's one thing.

1029
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,450
But if you're out for blood,

1030
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,173
there's a pretty good chance
you're gonna trash the team.

1031
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:21,990
When Central catches up with
you, you'll go to prison.

1032
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:23,743
- Prison.

1033
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,920
How's that any worse than us walking away

1034
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,170
knowing what we now know?

1035
01:11:32,614 --> 01:11:33,890
Do you have any idea what comes up

1036
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,340
when you look up our old
social security numbers?

1037
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:38,613
Deceased.

1038
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:41,210
We don't exist, Lena.

1039
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:43,050
Because some twisted freak
and his little buddies

1040
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:45,000
decided to blow our plane out of the sky,

1041
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,480
we get to grow up in Nowheresville

1042
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,930
with nothing but first names.

1043
01:11:50,776 --> 01:11:52,030
And just like all the other little kids

1044
01:11:52,030 --> 01:11:53,410
we got to learn about ballistics

1045
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:55,383
and international spy codes,

1046
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:58,290
how to kill the enemy with our thumbs,

1047
01:11:59,657 --> 01:12:01,757
how to endure relentless torture and pain.

1048
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,340
I'm done enduring the pain.

1049
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:09,963
There's just one thing I can
think to do to make it stop.

1050
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,120
- Well, at least let me drive.

1051
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,720
Then you can blame it all on me.

1052
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,530
- I was gonna do that anyway.

1053
01:12:41,635 --> 01:12:44,135
- So what is it that you want?

1054
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:47,667
Don't you have a list
of demands on somethin'?

1055
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:51,213
- You are a wealthy man,
aren't you, Mr. Gold?

1056
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:56,500
- Money is that what you want?

1057
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,593
Well, name your price I'll pay it.

1058
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:02,510
- No, no, no, what I'm saying is

1059
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:06,383
you have plenty of money
to live a wonderful life.

1060
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:09,270
Yet, you continue to work.

1061
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:11,240
Expanding your company,

1062
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,373
raising your value on the market, why?

1063
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:16,390
Because you found the one thing

1064
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,813
you can do better than
anyone else in the world.

1065
01:13:20,987 --> 01:13:23,780
And the power that comes with that role,

1066
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:25,403
that supreme reputation,

1067
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,060
it's worth more than any currency can buy.

1068
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,003
You have your games and I have mine.

1069
01:13:35,424 --> 01:13:36,686
(chuckling softly)

1070
01:13:36,686 --> 01:13:39,747
You didn't realize we had
that much in common, did you?

1071
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:44,542
(tense music)

1072
01:13:51,213 --> 01:13:54,213
(cellphone beeping)

1073
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,850
- [Derek] There you are.

1074
01:14:01,232 --> 01:14:04,232
(cellphone beeping)

1075
01:14:23,815 --> 01:14:27,315
(voices speaking faintly)

1076
01:14:50,006 --> 01:14:52,506
(gun cocking)

1077
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:08,369
- Where did you come from?

1078
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:11,190
All my prisoners are accounted for?

1079
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,767
You're not on my list, why?

1080
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,010
- I'm not on the cruise sheet.

1081
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:15,843
I'm an intern.

1082
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:19,030
- Where was he?

1083
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:22,330
- Poking around downstairs
near the weapons room.

1084
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:24,675
A guard is missing from that area.

1085
01:15:24,675 --> 01:15:27,590
(suspenseful music)

1086
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:29,863
- Did you hurt one of my men, Intern?

1087
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,406
No, not this one.

1088
01:15:33,406 --> 01:15:35,656
Never harmed a living soul.

1089
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:40,640
Who was back up for that post?

1090
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,169
- Me, sir.

1091
01:15:42,169 --> 01:15:44,586
(gun firing)

1092
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,180
- Then who was watching your post?

1093
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:53,780
I want every bolt of
this ship searched now.

1094
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,787
And toss that man with the others.

1095
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,390
- Don't worry I'm here to help.

1096
01:16:15,255 --> 01:16:18,255
(cellphone ringing)

1097
01:16:26,162 --> 01:16:27,086
(man grunting)

1098
01:16:27,086 --> 01:16:28,788
(electricity buzzing)

1099
01:16:28,788 --> 01:16:31,538
(dramatic music)

1100
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:54,603
- You lost?

1101
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:05,170
You know our policy on public meetings.

1102
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:07,150
This had better be important.

1103
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:08,562
- Why didn't you tell us?

1104
01:17:08,562 --> 01:17:11,400
(dramatic music)

1105
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,623
Why did you lie?

1106
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:24,470
- When pain exists in
the mind or in the body,

1107
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:26,950
human nature insist that we fight it,

1108
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:29,563
destroy it otherwise we suffer.

1109
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:34,140
My job was to free you from such things,

1110
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,330
to make sure that you were focused

1111
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:37,163
on your education, your training.

1112
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:40,893
I couldn't afford one
minute of hopelessness,

1113
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,760
one of you running off
to sniff out the trail

1114
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,363
of your parents' murderers.

1115
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:49,223
So I tried to close that chapter myself.

1116
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,133
- The hit squad

1117
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,653
you took out the leader, their father.

1118
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,920
When you went after the others,

1119
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,053
red flags went up.

1120
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:04,330
You were pissing off Washington.

1121
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:05,990
- Understand two things.

1122
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:08,770
Sometimes lies are told to cure,

1123
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,773
to protect, not to betray.

1124
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:14,080
And understand that there are consequences

1125
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,083
you must accept and be done with.

1126
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:20,513
Joel, their father is dead also.

1127
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:24,390
If you wanna play an eye for an eye,

1128
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:25,640
then both sides are even.

1129
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:28,370
What separates us

1130
01:18:29,685 --> 01:18:32,423
is our dedication to a moral high ground.

1131
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,860
Without out it we're just like them.

1132
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,900
- But it's obvious
they're up to something.

1133
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:41,250
They need to be stopped.

1134
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,860
- Central's been informed.

1135
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,183
They're taking care of it.

1136
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,130
Where are the others?

1137
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:48,910
- They went home.

1138
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:51,293
- There you are?

1139
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:54,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

1140
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:57,460
- Elaine, this is Mr. Richards.

1141
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:00,350
He's a big fan of our
new project, the CD-ROM.

1142
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,800
Flew here all the way from
Texas just to meet us.

1143
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,509
Wants to know where he can sign up.

1144
01:19:04,509 --> 01:19:07,120
- Well, I have all the necessary paperwork

1145
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,530
at our booth if you'd like to follow me.

1146
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:11,130
- Yeah.

1147
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:11,963
Great.

1148
01:19:16,335 --> 01:19:19,110
(people chatting)

1149
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:22,157
- [Announcer] Welcome
to International Comdex,

1150
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:24,329
bringing the computer world together.

1151
01:19:24,329 --> 01:19:25,918
- [Elaine] This way, but take your time.

1152
01:19:25,918 --> 01:19:30,918
(woman on intercom speaking
in foreign language)

1153
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:34,890
- [Man] The U.S. Defense Department

1154
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:37,370
has also establish a website for tourists

1155
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:40,070
to help monitor hostile
activity throughout the world.

1156
01:19:42,034 --> 01:19:43,315
- Come on let's go.

1157
01:19:43,315 --> 01:19:45,450
- [Man] This event just keeps
getting bigger and bigger.

1158
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:48,290
- [Man] Nobody wants to
miss out on technology.

1159
01:19:49,713 --> 01:19:52,900
- [Man] It's like a parade
of CEOs in here, gaming.

1160
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,093
- [Man] Government, software,
hardware, you name it.

1161
01:20:01,595 --> 01:20:04,580
(loud explosion)

1162
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:08,250
- [Announcer] Get ready
for a real experience.

1163
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:13,110
You're in control of a battle at sea

1164
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:18,110
with Tanner Gold's latest
creation Fleet Command.

1165
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,440
See the real ship today at 3:00 p.m.

1166
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,190
(dramatic music)

1167
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:34,470
- Yes, Joel.

1168
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:37,410
- Rachel, find Ashe and bring her to me.

1169
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:38,243
- Right away.

1170
01:20:45,432 --> 01:20:48,182
(dramatic music)

1171
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:53,510
- What other kinds of weapons

1172
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:55,612
can they launch from this thing?

1173
01:20:55,612 --> 01:20:56,860
- I'm not sure.

1174
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,950
- What about your curse for details.

1175
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:01,150
- Often challenged by my other curse.

1176
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:02,380
- Yeah.

1177
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:03,403
- Short-term memory.

1178
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,760
- Let's split up.

1179
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:08,393
- I didn't know we were together.

1180
01:21:17,201 --> 01:21:19,784
(guns cocking)

1181
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,420
You would've been so dead.

1182
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:25,770
- Yeah, by your ghost.

1183
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:27,320
- Where's Derek, drinking with the enemy?

1184
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:32,320
- Yeah, big party in the
hall, food, strippers

1185
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:35,450
thought I'd head down after I
get this stupid thing working.

1186
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:37,260
- Looks like we're out numbered here, huh?

1187
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:40,620
- Totally, and they don't
look like beginners.

1188
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,293
- Yeah, you don't know the half of it.

1189
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,580
Tell you later.

1190
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:47,593
What do you got here?

1191
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:56,470
- You take pride in
killing innocent people?

1192
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:01,870
- We are done with the
psychoanalysis portion of the trip.

1193
01:22:01,870 --> 01:22:03,770
Shut your mouth and keep us on course.

1194
01:22:06,765 --> 01:22:07,932
- Here let me.

1195
01:22:12,919 --> 01:22:13,950
There I got it.

1196
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:15,195
I got it.

1197
01:22:15,195 --> 01:22:16,840
(intercom echoing)

1198
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,251
What's that.

1199
01:22:18,251 --> 01:22:19,727
- [Keith] That's your voice.

1200
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:21,690
- Can they hear that?

1201
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:23,330
What did you do?

1202
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:24,163
- Me.

1203
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:26,663
- Stay.

1204
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,693
(dramatic music)

1205
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:34,283
Follow me.

1206
01:22:35,622 --> 01:22:36,455
Move.

1207
01:22:36,455 --> 01:22:37,372
Move, fast.

1208
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:50,813
What is this?

1209
01:22:52,023 --> 01:22:54,003
Did you see anyone exit this tower?

1210
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:01,623
If you're rats, I'm very impressed.

1211
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:09,290
You transmission didn't get through,

1212
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:11,518
so you might as well surrender.

1213
01:23:11,518 --> 01:23:13,241
(dramatic music)

1214
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:15,550
(guns cocking)

1215
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:18,650
- This isn't the S.S. Minnow, is it?

1216
01:23:21,806 --> 01:23:22,639
- You?

1217
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:32,823
- I don't see any strippers.

1218
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:42,053
- How did he get out, huh?

1219
01:23:45,903 --> 01:23:48,820
I can't run battles with blind men.

1220
01:23:58,230 --> 01:23:59,493
- Yeah, he's a twin.

1221
01:24:01,225 --> 01:24:03,843
I would've said something,
but he just started swinging.

1222
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:09,883
- Well done, boys.

1223
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:12,700
You have made it onboard.

1224
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,000
Taken out a few of my men.

1225
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:18,290
You even fooled me with this
you only live twice bit.

1226
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:24,123
And regardless of how you
stumbled upon my day at sea,

1227
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,200
you're about to witness
one act of aggression

1228
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,493
that can't be stopped.

1229
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:30,813
Certainly, not by you.

1230
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,723
Seal this hatch permanently, move.

1231
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,244
(dramatic music)

1232
01:24:55,008 --> 01:24:57,841
(machine beeping)

1233
01:25:00,442 --> 01:25:01,790
- He's almost here with the boat.

1234
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:04,233
- Just a few minutes
more with my new enemies.

1235
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:14,120
When I read about Mr. Gold's
exciting plans for Comdex,

1236
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:18,900
I thought what a great
target for destruction.

1237
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:23,363
The staples of international
business I couldn't pass it up.

1238
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,640
- Just like that flight
out of Japan years ago

1239
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:31,550
you couldn't pass that
up either, could you?

1240
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:34,883
- Well, you've done your homework.

1241
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:42,030
I wish all my men were more like you.

1242
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:44,153
- Gee, you're making me blush.

1243
01:25:46,758 --> 01:25:51,758
(machine beeping)
(door opening loudly)

1244
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:59,740
- The strength of a great archer is not

1245
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:01,570
how wide he can stretch the bow

1246
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:05,893
but knowing when to release the arrow.

1247
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,894
(men grunting)

1248
01:26:10,894 --> 01:26:13,894
(suspenseful music)

1249
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:17,250
- [Lena] Hang on guys.

1250
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,260
- All you special agents

1251
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,610
you're making it difficult to move around.

1252
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:26,073
That's why you hire me
and my elite warriors.

1253
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:28,780
We get the job done.

1254
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:30,593
No lose ends no smoking guns.

1255
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:34,270
And what better way to
advertise than to hit

1256
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:36,960
the most overexposed event in the world

1257
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:41,563
without warning, without remorse.

1258
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:45,100
Not even a Super Bowl commercial

1259
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,883
gets you that kind of publicity.

1260
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:50,733
Huh, what do you think of that?

1261
01:26:52,727 --> 01:26:54,510
- I think, all your pod-faced terrorists

1262
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:57,403
with your bad teeth are
all smoking the same crack.

1263
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:00,090
Why don't you go do something original

1264
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,710
instead of seeing your face
on the newspaper tomorrow

1265
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:06,008
as the next piece of shit who
underestimated the good times.

1266
01:27:06,008 --> 01:27:07,987
Oh, take your bitches with you.

1267
01:27:09,272 --> 01:27:11,467
(dramatic music)

1268
01:27:11,467 --> 01:27:13,393
- How's this for originality?

1269
01:27:18,103 --> 01:27:21,103
(suspenseful music)

1270
01:27:27,917 --> 01:27:31,584
(helicopter blades roaring)

1271
01:27:45,456 --> 01:27:48,456
- [Lena] Come on let's go, go, move!

1272
01:28:33,906 --> 01:28:36,906
(sailors screaming)

1273
01:28:44,677 --> 01:28:46,333
- Ah!

1274
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:47,166
- Stay.

1275
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:50,923
(men grunting)

1276
01:28:54,145 --> 01:28:55,228
- Samo!

1277
01:29:29,258 --> 01:29:31,631
(men grunting)

1278
01:29:31,631 --> 01:29:35,298
(helicopter blades roaring)

1279
01:29:55,783 --> 01:29:57,493
- I can't fight the chick.

1280
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:01,840
- Unless she starts it.

1281
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:11,113
- Never leave the geek with the knife.

1282
01:30:11,113 --> 01:30:14,113
(suspenseful music)

1283
01:30:41,956 --> 01:30:44,539
(men grunting)

1284
01:32:01,925 --> 01:32:04,675
(woman groaning)

1285
01:32:10,753 --> 01:32:13,773
- You and your friends think
you have all the killer moves.

1286
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,483
Let me show you one of mine.

1287
01:32:22,431 --> 01:32:23,637
- Needs work.

1288
01:32:23,637 --> 01:32:26,387
(dramatic music)

1289
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:44,516
- Here shoot it off.

1290
01:32:55,464 --> 01:32:58,047
(man groaning)

1291
01:33:01,257 --> 01:33:05,135
- [Jason] I said don't start
something you can't finish.

1292
01:33:05,135 --> 01:33:08,802
(helicopter blades roaring)

1293
01:33:31,991 --> 01:33:34,741
(dramatic music)

1294
01:33:37,768 --> 01:33:39,418
- You can't have enough of these.

1295
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:43,130
This one destroys that ship

1296
01:33:43,130 --> 01:33:45,093
with all your little friends onboard.

1297
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,620
I told you I couldn't be stopped.

1298
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:52,820
- Don't be so down on yourself.

1299
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,626
I'm pretty good at this stuff.

1300
01:33:54,626 --> 01:33:56,810
(chuckling sinisterly)

1301
01:33:56,810 --> 01:33:57,643
- Who sent you?

1302
01:33:57,643 --> 01:33:58,573
I gotta know.

1303
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:00,553
- You did.

1304
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:02,820
Flight 770

1305
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,253
I was on it.

1306
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:09,920
- No one could have survived that.

1307
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,620
- Sometimes I wish that were true.

1308
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:15,080
- Then it seems I have
some unfinished business.

1309
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:15,913
- Me too.

1310
01:34:20,499 --> 01:34:21,332
(Jason grunting)

1311
01:34:21,332 --> 01:34:23,240
- No loose ends.

1312
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,383
No smoking gun.

1313
01:34:27,523 --> 01:34:30,356
(sighing heavily)

1314
01:34:31,446 --> 01:34:34,279
Here is the end to your suffering.

1315
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:40,000
(Jason breathing heavily)

1316
01:34:41,954 --> 01:34:43,857
(suspenseful music)

1317
01:34:43,857 --> 01:34:46,607
(Jason grunting)

1318
01:34:55,004 --> 01:34:57,671
(alert beeping)

1319
01:34:58,965 --> 01:35:02,548
(Avi chuckling sinisterly)

1320
01:35:44,442 --> 01:35:46,969
- Times up.
- Got an executor over here.

1321
01:35:46,969 --> 01:35:49,706
- [Man] Shame on you, secure!

1322
01:35:49,706 --> 01:35:51,623
- [Man] Get over there.

1323
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:54,310
- [Man] Gotta move these gentlemen.

1324
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:56,533
- [Man] Just come on quit moving.

1325
01:35:56,533 --> 01:35:59,283
(dramatic music)

1326
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,100
- [Man] Where you going?

1327
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:02,970
- [Lena] Looks okay, huh?

1328
01:36:02,970 --> 01:36:04,626
- [Keith] Hmm.

1329
01:36:04,626 --> 01:36:06,709
- [Man] Knock it off now.

1330
01:36:12,845 --> 01:36:14,436
(dramatic music)

1331
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:17,567
(helicopter blades roaring)

1332
01:36:17,567 --> 01:36:19,650
- [Ashe] So does this make us even?

1333
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,563
- Could we ever be even, Ashe?

1334
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:23,843
- Only in your dreams.

1335
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:26,890
- Then I'll see you in my dreams.

1336
01:36:40,578 --> 01:36:42,833
- What are you guys up to?

1337
01:36:42,833 --> 01:36:44,370
- Heading back to the States.

1338
01:36:44,370 --> 01:36:45,510
Hit the cabin.

1339
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:47,900
- 10 inches of new powder yesterday.

1340
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:51,260
- I'll never understand your
devotion to water and snow.

1341
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:52,310
- We know.

1342
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:53,642
- Late.

1343
01:36:53,642 --> 01:36:56,475
(engines revving)

1344
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:08,710
- You still talking to me?

1345
01:37:08,710 --> 01:37:11,043
- Yeah, I got used to
your mistakes by now.

1346
01:37:12,510 --> 01:37:13,363
No hard feelings.

1347
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:16,720
- Are you ready?

1348
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:17,903
- Oh, gotta go.

1349
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:21,123
I'll take good notes.

1350
01:37:22,055 --> 01:37:23,480
Tell you all about it.

1351
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:24,932
- Yeah, you do that.

1352
01:37:24,932 --> 01:37:27,356
(gentle music)

1353
01:37:27,356 --> 01:37:28,189
Jerk.

1354
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,920
- Alright, I gotta go.

1355
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,540
Take care of that shoulder.

1356
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:34,940
Infections aren't very sexy.

1357
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:39,040
- It's been a while
since I had a new scar.

1358
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,473
- Scars can be sexy.

1359
01:37:41,530 --> 01:37:42,550
- I got a couple of cool ones.

1360
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:43,383
You wanna see.

1361
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,863
- What am I gonna do with you?

1362
01:37:46,863 --> 01:37:48,113
- Want me to answer that?

1363
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:54,800
Thanks for backing me up yesterday.

1364
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:57,210
- I just hope I didn't steal your thunder.

1365
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:59,987
- Yeah, like I try and
be the hero all the time.

1366
01:37:59,987 --> 01:38:02,545
- I'll catch you on the next crisis.

1367
01:38:02,545 --> 01:38:05,212
(gentle music)

1368
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:11,674
- We might just have to start one.

1369
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:20,923
Yeah, she totally likes me.

1370
01:38:20,923 --> 01:38:24,006
(car engine revving)

1371
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:30,100
(woman singing gently)

1372
01:38:34,661 --> 01:38:37,328
(lively music)

1373
01:40:03,373 --> 01:40:06,456
(funky upbeat music)

1374
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:17,557
(gentle music)

1375
01:42:34,172 --> 01:42:37,172
(lively rock music)
