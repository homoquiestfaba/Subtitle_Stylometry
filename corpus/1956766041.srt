1
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,980
- Boss...
<i>- Something happened.</i>

2
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,273
<i>What's wrong?</i>

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,443
You'll have the item today,
just like we agreed.

4
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,112
It's as good as in your hands.

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,033
- Nothing can go wrong.
<i>- You contemptible canine.</i>

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,410
Don't call me canine.

7
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,204
- Do you know what patience means?
<i>- Silence!</i>

8
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:42,417
<i>As long as dogs are involved,
anything can go wrong.</i>

9
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,878
I'll take that as a no.

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,256
Jeez, what a hothead.

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,678
Eh... Keep your quarter.

12
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,410
I am proud to present this
special token to our dear...

13
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,871
Only in heaven
can a bunch of squeaky-clean angels

14
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,208
get awards
for being extra squeaky-clean.

15
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,467
And now, our final honoree,

16
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,762
voted Most Rehabilitated
by our heavenly jury.

17
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,514
He's a dog who is...

18
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,725
Wouldn't be caught dead wearing
one of those merit badges, eh, Carface?

19
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,560
Hey. Sh!

20
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,647
A dog who's lifted himself up
from the depths of depravity,

21
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,109
who proves that every dog deserves
a second chance in heaven.

22
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,361
Now I know why they call it eternity.

23
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,864
- Everything here takes forever.
- Sh!

24
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,117
Charlie, show some respect.

25
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,286
For making the most
of what he's had to work with,

26
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:28,750
this first-class, diamond-studded,
angel-wing pin goes to...

27
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,795
- ...Carface Caruthers.
- Huh?

28
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:35,173
What an honor. You're too kind.

29
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,095
I don't know what to say.

30
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,682
Thank you. Thank you very much.

31
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,270
Bless you.

32
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,939
I only hope
that our other angels,

33
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,317
who have yet
to distinguish themselves,

34
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,029
soon follow your shining example.

35
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,033
Hey, remember, Charlie,
it never hurts to play the game.

36
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,869
Halo polisher.

37
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,919
Whoa, I'm late.

38
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,433
That feels good.

39
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,703
Yah!

40
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,584
Sorry. Lousy brake pads.

41
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,503
Have the newcomers
touched down yet?

42
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,630
No, not yet.

43
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,643
Put on some weight, huh, Fluffy?

44
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,313
Check. Go ahead, 15.
Check. Move along.

45
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,941
Sorry, sir.

46
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,403
Check. Check. Check. Move along.

47
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,740
That's it. That's all dogs.

48
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,535
Hold it, hold it, let me see that list.

49
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,830
There has to be more.
I'm expecting company.

50
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,249
Uh...

51
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,585
Asta, Bandit, Bowser, Fido, Fifi,
Hound of Baskerville,

52
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,297
Pavlov's dog, Rex, Rover, Rufus,
Shatzi, Spot and...

53
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,174
Itchy! Ho-ho!

54
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,094
Oh, yeah. Right.
He's right here on the list.

55
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,890
- Where am I?
- You old fleabag, you.

56
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,773
Charlie, is that you?

57
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,569
Charlie, it is you. Charlie.

58
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,029
Gee, Itch, you shouldn't have.

59
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,949
Sorry, sir, you can't take it with you.

60
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,874
Wait a minute, ain't you dead?

61
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,376
Oh, yeah,
as a dog that eats chicken bones.

62
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:21,172
Oh, so that means...

63
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,718
Uh-oh!

64
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,721
Welcome to paradise, Itch.

65
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,808
Come on, I'll show you around.
You can mark your territory.

66
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,191
Hey, wait. Charlie.

67
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,498
Oh, this is...
Well, I never would have imagined.

68
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,209
Look at this.

69
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,924
Hey, Charlie, wait a minute.
I'm not itchy.

70
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,509
That's funny, you sure look like him.

71
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,845
No, I mean...

72
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:13,266
...for the first time in my life,
I don't need to scratch.

73
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,895
This is heaven, Itch.
Fleas go to the other place.

74
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:22,025
Hey, Bubba, how about we go down
to Hog Heaven and get us some ribs?

75
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,196
Everybody's flying.

76
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,407
Does that mean me too?

77
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,495
Oh, yeah,
it's all part of the basic package.

78
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,874
I'm gonna like it here,
Charlie.

79
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,461
Believe me, it gets old fast.

80
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,172
Yeah, sure. Ha-ha-ha.

81
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,549
Whoa! Yah! Hoo!

82
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,762
- What do you mean?
- It's hard to explain, Itch.

83
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,057
This joint is supposed
to have everything, to be the best,

84
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,643
but it's just too...
I don't know, it's...

85
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,895

Hm...

131
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,303
Ah!

132
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,679
Ooh!

133
00:12:56,359 --> 00:13:00,905
Baby, you're my ticket
to fame and fortune.

134
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,414
This is not good.

135
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,303
Whoa!

136
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,893
Oh-ho!

137
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,827
Charlie,
you're wrong about this place.

138
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:52,290
The flying alone
is worth the price of admission.

139
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:57,420
That's perfect for you, but for me,
there's still something missing.

140
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:02,091
Ooh! Charlie, look, look.

141
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,638
Quiet, quiet, quiet, everyone.

142
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,767
- I've got terrible news.
- Oh, yeah, the flying nun.

143
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:15,438
Gabriel's horn has fallen from heaven
and landed on Earth

144
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,941
in the heart of San Francisco.

145
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,989
But without the horn,
the Pearly Gates can't be opened.

146
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,117
- And no more dogs will get into heaven.
- Lucky dogs.

147
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,454
Reginald,
you're our most-decorated angel.

148
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,956
I need you to go back to Earth

149
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,625
- to retrieve it.
- Go back?

150
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,253
Anabelle,
I would consider it a great...

151
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,838
Whoa, time-out.

152
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,132
- I beg your pardon.
- You can't send Reggie.

153
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,259
Just look at him, for heaven's sake.

154
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,887
They got rats down there
bigger than this.

155
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,640
He's right. I'll go.

156
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:55,228
We're talking the mean streets of Frisco
here, Ace, not Mount Happy-Go-Lucky.

157
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,854
Send me, Ana...

158
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,650
Anabelle, you're gonna need someone
who can zip down there and back

159
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,111
before Big Gabe
finds his horn missing.

160
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,321
Someone who knows the ropes
and the dopes.

161
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,156
- Someone who's...
- Just like you.

162
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,991
Me? Well, I don't know.

163
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,495
I'd have to check with my people
and get back to you.

164
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,206
Aw, what the heck. I'll do it.

165
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,334
Maybe you can do something
besides make a nuisance of yourself.

166
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,879
- Right, right, right. I'll be in touch.
- Hold it.

167
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,507
To find the horn, follow your ears.

168
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:29,470
It gives off a steady, heavenly tone
that only angels can hear.

169
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,264
Only angels. Got it.

170
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,641
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
You're on your own.

171
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:38,938
I can give you one miracle
to be used only in an emergency.

172
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,359
One per customer. Got it.

173
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:47,363
Charles, Charles, Charles,
this is serious.

174
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,702
If the horn falls into the wrong hands,
it could mean disaster for us all.

175
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,538
You can count on Charles.

176
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,502
Uh... Just to make sure,
I'm sending Itchy along with you.

177
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:06,007
Oh, no. But I just got here.
Wait just a sec.

178
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,426
I still have death lag.

179
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,057
I remembered,
I have flying lessons after lunch.

180
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,809
Bring back the horn, Charles,

181
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,063
otherwise there'll be heaven to pay.

182
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,732
Got it.

183
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,085
Look at this mess, Itch.
Trash, exhaust fumes, graffiti.

184
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,379
We are home.

185
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,090
Whoa!

186
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,594
You're telling me.

187
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:57,391
Halo. Double chili cheeseburger
with onions and pickles.

188
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,810
Charlie, stay.

189
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:04,774
Look, we find Gabriel's horn, and then
it's straight back to heaven, okay?

190
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,776
What's the hurry, Itch?

191
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:11,614
- Let's have some fun.
- Charlie, wait. Wiener dog here.

192
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,533
Oh, my legs are short.

193
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,160
<i>Now, let's hear it

195
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:23,251
- ID?
- I don't need no stinking dog tags.

196
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,923
Oh, a classy place.
They check for worms.

197
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,761

- Guess that's why they call me Lucky.
- All right, boys, name your game.

205
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,961
Poker, double deuce, 52-card pickup?
I'm just yanking your leash.

00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,191

I'll just help myself.

Yee-ha!

00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,044
What?

215
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,549
Charlie, look, we ain't... Ooh!

216
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,386
- We're ghosts.
- Anabelle.

217

Of all the rotten tricks.

218
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,895
Charles, you've been down
there for almost half an hour.

Ooh! My ears popped.
Did your ears pop?

266
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,034
Now I know what I was missing
in heaven.

267
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,204
- I gotta meet her.
- But she can't even see you, Charlie.

268
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,748
- You're an angel.
- Quit reminding me.

269
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,586
You're back in circulation,
huh, Charlie?

270
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,755
Oh, yeah, my circulation's fine.

271
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,968
Hello, Carface. Carface?

272
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,137
I heard you was in the neighborhood.

273
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:12,308
Yeah, I got time off for good behavior.
What are you doing here?

274
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,603
Missionary work.
Hey, I'll take one of them.

275
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,358
- She can't hear you.
- That'll be two bits, Carface.

276
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,862
- Put it on my tab.
- Huh?

277
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,494
As long as I'm wearing this baby,
I'm flesh and blood.

278
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,456
- Where'd you get it?
- A buddy of mine has them.

279
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:40,169
- Maybe you could introduce us.
- Charlie, you can't trust Carface.

280
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,796
He shouldn't have got into heaven
in the first place.

281
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,299
My mistake.

282
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,179
I just thought you'd like to meet
the lovely lady.

283
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,597
Hold it, Carface, hold on.

284
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,976
- What about the horn?
- Hey, we'll get it later.

285
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,978
Lead on, pal.

286
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:02,191
Charlie, wait. Short legs, short legs.

287
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:14,495
Charlie.
Charlie, wait for me.

288
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,505
How much further here, Carface?

289
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,050
We're... We're almost there.

290
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:32,096
Charlie. Charlie.

291
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,891
Itchy, you're out of breath
and the fun hasn't even started yet.

292
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:39,937
Charlie,
I got a bad feeling about this.

293
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:44,233
Relax. I got it under control.

294
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,902
Boys, we're here.

295
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,244
Hey, Red!

296
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,876
He must be in the back.
Have a look around.

297
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,056
Ah! Whoo!

298
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,517
- Ooh!
- Ah!

299
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,734
- You trying to scare me to death?
- Don't sweat it, pal.

300
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,029
You're already dead.

301
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:35,701
Itch. Come here.
I want to read your fortune.

302
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:40,456
- I see you going for a long walk.
- Yeah, on a short leash.

303
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,542
You're in the wrong seat. Move it.

304
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:48,964
Carface, that's no way
to treat customers.

305
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,428
Red, I'd like you to meet
a couple of friends of mine.

306
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:58,182
Charlie Barkin, Itchy Itchiford.

307
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,268
- Welcome.
- Wait, wait, how can he...?

308
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:04,021
Red sees all and knows all.

309
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,108
You got cats around here or what?

310
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,820
Cats? Good heavens, no.

311
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,655
The boys have come
to do a little shopping.

312
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,325
Carface tells us you've got
some special collars.

313
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:20,162
Collars? Oh, yes.

314
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,706
They're going to be the next big thing.

315
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:29,088
- Here. Enjoy.
- What's the catch, old man?

316
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:34,718
No catch. Any friend of Carface
is a friend of mine.

317
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:40,933
- There is one small thing.
- I knew it. We're out of here.

318
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,309
Right, Charlie?

319
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,813
The collars are only good
until sundown tomorrow.

320
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:50,484
After that, you'll be, shall we say,
insubstantial again.

321
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:54,530
By then, I'll have Sasha begging for me.

322
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,503
Yow! Hey! Oof!

323
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,881
Ah. Perfect fit.

324
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:19,721
Feels great to be back in the flesh.

325
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,935
Infested again.

326
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,646
Ooh! Get off. Everybody, off.

327
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,358
Now, don't forget, sundown tomorrow.

328
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,703
- Hey.
- Hey, Red, I owe you one.

329
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,207
You'll owe me one, all right.

330
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,752
They fell for it!

331
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,172
When we get that horn,

332
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,843
we can open any safe or bank vault
in the world.

333
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,596

- Excuse me.
- The name's Barkin, Charlie Barkin.

404
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:08,069
- And you are...?
- Not even remotely interested.

405
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,197
- Oh, that's a mouthful.
- Down, boy.

406
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,491
- Let me help with that.
- I don't want a scene.

407
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,494
- Give me that. No, please.
- It's no problem at all.

409
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,875
Hey, sister.

410
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,210
No free eats.

411
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,504
I'll take care of it.

412
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,841
- Put it on Carface's tab.
- Okay.

413
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,344
Now, where were...?

414
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,095
Huh?

415
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,807
Hey, Charlie,

416
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,895
I noted how you swept the lady
off her feet.

417
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:45,357
So I'm rusty.
Let's make a little home delivery.

418
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:52,656
I'll never get back to heaven.
Oh, shucks.

419
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,829
Something tells me
you're forgetting the horn.

420
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,667
Would you take it easy? There's
plenty of time for that. Come on.

421
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,962
Anabelle is not gonna
like this, Charlie.

422
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:24,104
Hey, nice digs, huh, Itch?

423
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,315
Ah!

424
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:32,237
- You again? What do you want?
- You left your doggy bag.

425
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:36,324
Oh, right. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

426
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,994
There's more than enough.

427
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,371
If you want some company,
we could stick around.

428
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:45,000
- Sorry, I've got a kid.
- Uh...

429
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,961
Yeah, well, I'm good with kids.

430
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:59,264
Whoa, she's got a "kid" kid.

431
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,850
Thanks, girl.

432
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:04,436
What did he do,
follow you home?

433
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:08,940
- Ah! You can talk?
- Ooh! Please don't encourage him.

434
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,066
Whoa!

435
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,526
He can understand you?

436
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,653
- Of course he can.
- Holy cow.

437
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,032
Holy dogs, actually.
I'm Charlie, he's Itchy.

438
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,410
What's going on here?
And I want the truth.

439
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:21,661
The truth?

440
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:25,874
I'm an angel.

441
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,792
- Oh, boy.
- Come on.

442
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,378
- Somebody's playing a trick.
- Okay.

443
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:35,133
Okay, if I'm not an angel,
how can I do this?

444
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:39,179
Ooh!

445
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,222
Oh!

446
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:46,269
Wait a minute. Run, jump, fly.
What did I forget?

447
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,734
Of course. Watch this, kid.

448
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:56,529
- Ah!
- Please...

449
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,240
...hold your applause.

450
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,412
- Ta-da!
- Wow!

451
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,164
That was the best trick
I've ever seen.

452
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,334
- Trick?
- I do magic too.

453
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,381
Give me the ball, boy.

454
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:22,180
Wow, that was... That was... More. More.

455
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,933
- The kid's good.
- Listen.

456
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,270
- I could help him with his technique.
- Houdini, that little boy is lost.

457
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,607
If you really wanna help him,
why don't you ask him where he lives?

458
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:38,405
- Charlie, look. It's a miracle.
- Why not ask him yourself?

459
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:43,284
- Now, that would be a miracle.
- One miracle coming up.

460
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,460
Ugh! Of all the arrogant, presumptuous,
egotistical mutts I've ever met...

461
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,962
Now you talk.

462
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,798
You must be an angel.

463
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,260
Hey, Charlie, you used up your miracle.

464
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,762
And that was supposed to be
for an emergency.

465
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,599
- Seemed like an emergency to me.
- You must be my guardian angel.

466
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:07,726
- Your what?
- Your what?

467
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,811
My mom told me
everyone has a guardian angel.

468
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,397
You're here because
I ran away from home, right?

469
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:16,317
Uh, sure, right, kid.
We're gonna make some team, huh?

470
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,237
- You mean you're not lost?
- Not anymore.

471
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,322
I got my guardian angel.

472
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,408
Hold it.
I wanna know why you ran away.

473
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,619
- You tell her.
- This ought to be good.

474
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,289
It's, uh... Um... Uh...

475
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:30,749
You're having, uh...

476
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,667
...kid problems?

477
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:37,172
- Yeah, with my stepmom.
- Knew it. Yeah, I knew it.

478
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,134
She wants me to call her Mom,
but she's not.

479
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,510
I'm never going home again.

480
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,138
So, what do you plan to do,
live on the street?

481
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:49,517
Yep. And do my magic
at Cannery Square.

482
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,437
- Tourists give you money.
- Now, you know that's silly.

483
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,648
- Come on, tell me where you live.
- No.

484
00:37:55,815 --> 00:38:00,528
Okay, don't listen to me.
Listen to your guardian angel.

485
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:04,240
David, Cannery Square
sounds like a good plan to me.

486
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:08,369
- What? Don't listen to him.
- He's not ready to go home.

487
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:14,042
- Come on, he's 8 years old.
- That's 56 in dog years.

488
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,628
David, with your talent,
there's no telling where you'll end up.

489
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,339
- Oh, please.
- No, no, you must have faith.

490
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:23,718
Guardian angels move
in mysterious ways.

491
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:27,472
- So we're off to Cannery Square?
- Not Cannery Square.

492
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,600
- Easy Street.
- Yes!

493
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,019
You with us, Sasha?

494
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:37,524
I don't know what you're up to,
but I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

495
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,069
I wouldn't want it any other way.

496
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,737
<i>Charles!</i>

497
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:48,827
We've got a traffic jam up here.
New arrivals can't get in.

498
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,162
We need that horn.

499
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,208
Put them in a holding pattern, okay?
I'm really onto something down here.

500
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:10,348
You're gonna love this place,
boss. It's got everything you wanted.

501
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:15,770
Beachfront location, fenced yard,
tight security.

502
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,607
The joint's been home
to some great pedigrees.

503
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:25,196
Capone, "Machine Gun" Kelly,
the Bird Dog of Alcatraz.

504
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,031
Ho-ho-ho!

505
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,117
Ah!

506
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:34,622
All that and ratatouille too.

507
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,504
Then I did good?

508
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,300
Have a bone.

509
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,146
Which way to Cannery Square?

510
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:01,274
Uh, just follow your nose.

511
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:04,152
So is there a Mr. Sasha?

512
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,821
No, and I'm not taking applications.

513
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:09,407
Okay. Okay. But if you were,

514
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,952
what, uh, what qualities
would you be looking for?

515
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,832
- Oh, I don't know.
- Of course you do.

516
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,667
Hm...

517
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:24,756
Well, loyalty, strength, breeding...

518
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,843
- I'd be good at that.
- ...humility,

519
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,971
- Compassion...
- Oh!

520
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,476
...and, of course, style.

521
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,353
Charlie, you okay?

522
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,440
- Boy, are my ears ringing.
- Yeah, you're right.

523
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,442
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

524
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:49,530
That's not your ears, Charlie, that's...
Oh, that's gotta be the horn.

525
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,700
Look, Charlie, there it is.

526
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,370
Go get it, Itch.

527
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,956
I'll stay here with Sasha.

528
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,960
Uh-uh. That's your job.
I'll stay with Sasha.

529
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,631
Okay. I'll be back
before you can say "Hallelujah."

530
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:10,927
- Where's he going?
- Confidential guardian-angel business.

531
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:17,642
You dogs have enjoyed
a state of grace for far too long.

532
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:23,773
- Wouldn't you agree, Carface?
- Uh, yeah, whatever you say, boss.

533
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,235
All these cells filled with dogs.

534
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:31,531
- Can you see it?
- Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.

535
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,742
And me playing Gabriel's horn.

536
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,411
- Can you hear it?
- Oh, sure.

537
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,622
Just, uh,
put your lips together and blow.

538
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,918
And then the grand finale!

539
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,714
That ain't...
That's not coming in so clear, actually.

540
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,258
Oh, it will.

541
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:54,345
And all thanks to Charlie Barkin.

542
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,185
- Make sure he doesn't disappoint me.
- You got it, boss.

Let's go.

550
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,799
- All right, step through.
- Good boy.

551
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,135
Hey, nice little dog there, isn't he?

552
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,075
Get this, McDowell:
"Man finds genie in his vacuum cleaner."

553
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,785
And last week, you believed
that scientists

554
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,037
created intelligent lunchmeat.

555
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:04,499
That's why everyone's afraid
to ride in a car with you.

556
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,542
Hey, sarge,
you got a lost and found here?

557
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,630
- Room 112, through the squad room.
- Ten-four.

558
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:15,093
I'm telling you, McDowell, there are
some mighty weird things in this world.

559
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:27,230
Any ideas why he ran away?

560
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,525
- It could only be one thing.
- We're having a baby.

561
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,611
And David got very upset
when I told him.

562
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,552
Hm!

563
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,890
Huh?

564
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,725
Oh! Whoo!

565
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,603
I can't believe this.

566
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,901
Where'd I put that lost-and-found list?

567
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:17,238
Come on. Come to Charlie.

568
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,993
- Oh! Ah!
- Huh?

569
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,578
Oh...

570
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:28,749
Of course it couldn't be Gabriel's flute
or Gabriel's kazoo, no.

571
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,922
- Thanks, Officer Reyes.
- Don't worry,

572
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,300
we'll find your little boy.

573
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,099
Itchy, where is he?
And what's this all about?

574
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:48,436
Sorry, can't.
Charlie and I are sworn to secrecy.

575
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:52,565
My lips, these lips right here,
see these lips? Well, they're sealed.

576
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,818
Itchy.

577
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,447
- Miss me? Ooh!
- Charlie.

578
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:03,910
- So where's the you-know-what?
- Minor setback, Itch.

579
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,537
We're just gonna have to bust it out.

580
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,874
- It? What "it"?
- Charlie, no.

581
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:15,087
- Well... Yah!
- Charlie, don't give away the "it."

582
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:19,717
You ever hear of Gabriel's horn?

583
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,302
All right, here's the plan.

584
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:30,853
Just keep moving. Doing great.
Act like you belong here. That's right.

585
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,688
Just through the door on the left.

586
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,442
I don't think this is gonna work.

587
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,987
Nobody even sees us. No eye contact.
Am I good or what?

588
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,494
Ah!

589
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,413
Don't you...
Don't you do that on those papers.

590
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,752
Uh-oh. Plan B, guys.

591
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,546
Doughnuts, fresh off the truck!

592
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:10,685
- Somebody get those mutts!
- Hey, hey, come back here.

593
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:16,357
Hey. Whoa! Get over here.
He's headed for the... Whoa!

594
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,155
Oh, no. Excuse me.

595
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,324
Ooh!

596
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,368
I'll just file this.

597
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:30,371
Whoa!

598
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,183
Oh! Oof! Ah!

599
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:55,146
- Oops! Sorry, officer.
- Ha! We got you.

600
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,898
Okay, son, give me the keys.

601
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:02,695
- You heard him, little man.
- Nothing up my sleeve, sir.

602
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:07,074
- What?
- Officer, what's that behind your ear?

603
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,328
Thank you, thank you.
You've been a great audience.

604
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,427
Mission accomplished. Come on.

605
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,263
- Ah!
- Oof!

606
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:36,479
Oh, my gosh, David. David!

607
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,359
Freeze. Sit. Stay.

608
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,950
What the...?

609
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,703
Move, move, move.

610
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,958
- Stop that kid!
- What are you doing?

611
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,711
- And those dogs on the scooter!
- Kick it, Charlie.

612
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,922
You don't have a license!

613
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:09,553
- Hey, short legs.
- Come back here!

614
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,639
Ah! It's the dog pound for sure.

615
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,603
Whoa!

616
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,987
Jump, Itch. Now!

617
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,209
Yahoo!

618
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,505
Whoa! Aren't guardian angels
supposed to protect people?

619
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:47,007
Hey, it's my first day on the job.

620
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,016
Ah!

621
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,613
Whoa!

622
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,995
I'm gonna barf.

623
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,582
- Yee-ha!
- Having fun, are we?

624
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,273
You finally got your flying lessons,
eh, Itch?

625
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,611
I'm gonna get you
for this, Charlie.

626
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:04,001
Aw, what do you mean,
we're not gonna go back yet?

627
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:07,838
Look, we got the horn, don't we?
Come on, let's get out of here.

628
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,926
I still need to take care of David.
I am his guardian angel.

629
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,637
Oh, yeah, sure,
and Sasha has nothing to do with it.

630
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:19,600
- Well, uh...
- Charlie, you're making me crazy here.

631
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,144
Just a little more time.

632
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,776
The horn'll be safe here.

633
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:31,946
No. Charlie!

634
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,459
Wouldn't you rather
be home right now, David?

635
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:49,964
Uh-uh. Not that again.
I'm going to Cannery Square.

636
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:54,802
- Don't you mean Easy Street?
- Yeah. How far is it?

637
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,137
A lot closer than you think.

638
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,649
- Nervous?
- A little. And sweaty.

639
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,150
Well, don't be.

640
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,945
- Excited?
- You bet.

641
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:20,369
- Now, Charlie...
- It's okay. All set. Let's go.

642
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,581

Come on, let's get you out of the rain.

690
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:38,150
One, please.

691
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,821
- Thank you.
- There you are. Come here, hon.

692
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:46,950
I'm so hungry, I could eat a shoe.
How about you?

693
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:51,747
I thought so. I'll be right back.

694
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,502
My mom used to do that.

695
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,339
Charlie, can she see me from heaven?

696
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,218
- Of course she can, kiddo.
- David, remember,

697
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,178
you still have
your dad and stepmom here.

698
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:11,225
My stepmom doesn't want me.
She's having her own kid.

699
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,727
But parents can love
more than one pup.

700
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,146
Maybe she didn't know
how to tell you that.

701
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,899
Maybe you should give her
another chance.

702
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:22,069
You know, I ran away from home
when I was little.

703
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,071
- That make your parents sorry?
- I don't know.

704
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,365
I never saw them after that.

705
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:30,118
Guess I could've used
a guardian angel, huh?

706
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:35,415
Charlie, I'll go home
if you promise to take me.

707
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:39,920
- I promise.
- Really? It'll be great.

708
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:42,923
You can sleep on my bed
and we'll play in the yard.

709
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,175
We'll be one big family.

710
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:48,387
Uh, David, hold on, hold on.
I can't promise that.

711
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:52,266
We struck gold.

Ge... Wha!

715
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:27,301
Nice work, Charlie Barkin.
You really are an angel.

716
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,596
No, I'm not.
Not a guardian angel, anyway.

717
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:34,558
- What you did for David was wonderful.
- I'm not his angel.

718
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:38,937
I'm just an errand boy
sent to fetch Gabriel's horn.

719
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:44,151
Sasha, my whole life has been about
making and breaking promises.

720
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,572
- And now I'm gonna do it again.
- You can't take him home?

721
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,616
I have to go back,

722
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:53,744
and just when I finally found
someone special.

723
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,289

- David, I'm here, right here.
- He's gone.

753
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:28,732
He wouldn't leave.
He's my guardian angel.

754
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,860
- We gotta do something, Itch.
- They'll be fine, Charlie.

755
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:34,279
I promised David I'd get him home.

00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,912
Short. Charlie!

758
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,676
Hey, you got any sixes?

759
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:01,181
Go fish.

760
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,242
- Red. Red.
- Ah!

761
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:24,204
I gotta... I gotta ask a favor.

762
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:28,166
Anything, Charlie, just name it.

763
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:33,255
- I need a new collar.
- You enjoyed it.

764
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:37,217
- I knew you would.
- Oh, thanks. You're a pal.

765
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:40,804
- Can I have it now?
- Oh, I am sorry.

766
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,889
You misunderstood me.

767
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:47,060
If you want another collar,
you must pay.

768
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:48,353
Oh.

769
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,524
You caught me a little short.
How about an IOU?

770
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:57,237
I don't think so.
Carface will show you out.

771
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,573
There must
be some way to make a deal.

772
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,911
Charlie, he might take a trade.

773
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,289
- Wait, wait.
- Goodbye.

774
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:12,627
Red, I have this horn.

775
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,340
Sorry, I'm not musical.

776
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,093
No, this is much more than a horn, Red.

777
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,013
There's nothing like it
in the whole world.

778
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,432
Let me sleep on it.

779
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:29,769
I don't have that kind of time.

780
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:33,607
I like your spirit, Charlie.

781
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:36,610
Bring me this horn
and you can have the collar.

782
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:41,198
Great. Uh, I need the collar to get it.

783
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,284
Oh, really?

784
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:50,123
- Come on, Red, you can trust me.
- This isn't about trust.

785
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:54,127
A deal with me is binding.

786
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:59,132
- Charlie, no!
- Deal?

787
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,640
Huh?! Ah!

788
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:14,648
Ah!

789
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:18,360
Guess the cat's out of the bag, eh?

790
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,906
You tricked me.

791
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:27,661
Oh!

792
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:32,832
Now, be a good little bow-wow,

793
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:36,044
and fetch me my horn.

794
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:39,214
Oh, Charlie!

795
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,343
Follow him.

796
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,456
Where you going, Charlie?

797
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,543
The train station.

798
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,215
Oh! Charlie, are you nuts?

799
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:25,385
- You... You gave away the horn.
- Get out of my way.

800
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,471
You shook on it.
You made a deal with him.

801
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:32,767
You promised Anabelle
and you promised me, Charlie.

802
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:37,814
Itch, I know that, but right now,
I've got to find David. Move.

803
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,989
- Come on, David. Which train?
- Where's Charlie?

804
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,450
He wouldn't leave me.

805
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,910
Huh?

806
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:54,873
David? David?

807
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,459
A-ha!

808
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,928
Bring the item to Alcatraz
in one hour,

809
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:14,225
or junior here doesn't have a prayer.

810
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:18,355
Charlie!

811
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,625
Where is he? The hour's up.

812
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,754
You know what they say, boss,
"Patience is a..."

813
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,715
Oh!

814
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:50,178
Uh... Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

815
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:54,516
What kind of dog are you,
selling out to some mangy old cat?

816
01:04:54,682 --> 01:05:00,480
- Quiet, or I'll have your tongue, boy.
- Red.

817
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,817
Charlie.

818
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,279
The horn.

819
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:11,699
Let me, boss. I'll fetch it for you.

820
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:22,043
Gabriel's horn is finally mine.

821
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:27,966
- Boss, they're hitting the bricks.
- Let them. I have what I want.

822
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:41,229
Silence!

823
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:47,444
Huh?

824
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,583
Charlie, what's happening?

825
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,377
Don't worry about it.
Let's get out of here.

826
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:51,674
- Come on. Jump.
- Ah!

827
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:58,431
- Charles, what have you done?
- Charlie, we gotta do something.

828
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:02,727
No, Itch, it's my fault.
I'm the one who's gotta do something.

829
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:07,774
- Get David home safely.
- Charlie, no!

830
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:13,947
Ah!

831
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,764
Red, Charlie's coming back.

832
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:45,645
That puppy's into punishment.

833
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,692
- Oof!
- It's a cat's world now.

834
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:59,242
- Let him go!
- Run, David.

835
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,664
Huh?

836
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:09,502

837
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,133
- All right, you, I'm coming. Ah!
- Huh?

838
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,178
Which do you want,

839
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:23,016
the horn or your friends?

840
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,352
Itchy, help us!

841
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,697
Everyone, scatter!

842
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,077
Come back here.

843
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,707
Play the horn, Charles. The horn.

844
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:53,546
Charlie.

845
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,947
This should cool him off.

846
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,702
Take a bath.

847
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:36,214
Enough stupid pet tricks.

848
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:42,929
Ha!

849
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:45,139
Ah!

850
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,229
Huh?

851
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,524
Here, kitty, kitty.

852
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:59,612
I like your spirit. Oops!

853
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:05,618
- Hope you can dog paddle.
- Charlie!

854
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:18,589
Ah!

855
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:31,370
Halo.

856
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:35,291
Double chili catburger
with onions and pickles.

857
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,460
- Everyone okay?
- Think so.

858
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,879
- I'm fine.
- I'm good.

859
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,631
Me too.

860
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,055
- Where's Red?
- His boss yanked his leash.

861
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:52,683
Ah! Good riddance.

862
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:57,897
Charlie, I hope you didn't
take any of that personally, you know?

863
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:01,025
I was just, you know,
playing the game.

864
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,652
Sure, Carface.

865
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,987
Say, what did you trade Red
for your collar?

866
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,574
He wanted the bottom of my
shoes or something.

867
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:12,245
I don't even wear shoes,
that stupid cat.

868
01:12:12,411 --> 01:12:17,124
Stupid dog. It was your soul!

869
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,210
Let me go.

870
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:24,715
This is not good. Hey! Not the flames.

871
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:33,599
What do you know.
And I thought all dogs go to heaven.

872
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,105
Anabelle?

873
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:44,527
- Come on, Charlie, time to go.
- Already?

874
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:48,155
David, can Sasha take you home?

875
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,783
Charlie, don't go.

876
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:55,705
Hey, I'll always be your guardian angel.

877
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,457
Okay.

878
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,928
Sasha, I love you.

879
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,055
I love you too, Charlie.

880
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:27,320
Hey, what's wrong?
Is this thing stuck between floors?

881
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:31,949
- I'll take the horn from here, Charles.
- What, you afraid I'll drop it?

882
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:35,494
Ah! Whoa!

883
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:43,085
There's someone who still needs
to go back where he belongs.

884
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:47,840
- I already took care of David.
- Not David. You, Charlie.

885
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:52,178
For what you've done,
you deserve a second chance.

886
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:56,349
Claim this in, oh, say, 20 years.

887
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:59,435
- You mean...?
- Mm-hm.

888
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:03,856
Itchy, you hear that?
We're going back.

889
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:08,444
Nah. Not this wiener dog.
See, when you can fly...

890
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:15,701
...short legs don't matter.

891
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:19,497
I'm gonna miss you, pal.

892
01:14:19,664 --> 01:14:23,960
I couldn't have done it without you.
Take care of yourself, buddy.

893
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,063
What is it, girl?

894
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,036
Can you believe it?

895
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:01,205
- Charlie.
- Charlie?

896
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:06,502
I got a weekend pass
for the rest of my life.

897
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:10,089
- Oh, Charlie.
- David?

898
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:14,593
- Thom, it's David.
- Davey!

899
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,139
Oh, David.

900
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,268
You're all right.

901
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,107
I've been worried sick about you.

902
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:30,609
- You worried about me?
- Of course.

903
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:34,280
Having this baby doesn't mean
I don't love you.

904
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:39,577
- I know that now, Mom.
- Honey, we're a family.

905
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:42,788
That's right, just a bigger one.

906
01:15:44,832 --> 01:15:47,168
Dad, Mom,

907
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:50,796
speaking of bigger families, you think
we have room for a pet or two?

908
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:54,467
Now, tell me the truth, Charlie Barkin,
why'd you really come back?

909
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,136
And don't you con me.

910
01:15:57,303 --> 01:16:02,266
Actually, I kind of like the idea
of being Mr. Sasha.

911
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:09,315
