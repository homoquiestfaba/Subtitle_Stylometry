1
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,749
Oh, thank God.

2
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,021
I actually thought you were
a killer tomato!

3
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,742
Good morning. It's 7:00.

4
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:24,613
Good morning. It's 7:00.
Good morning. It's 7:00.

5
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,617
Good morning-

6
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:29,168
Congratulations. You've reached
the city police department-

7
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,438
here to protect, serve
and create this city...

8
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,945
where people of all races,
creeds, colors...

9
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,950
ethnic persuasions and various
sexual orientations...

10
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,145
can live together
in harmonious bliss.

11
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,052
This is the office of
Detective Lance Boyle.

12
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,557
If you are calling about
a dog license...

13
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,753
please press "1"now
from your touch-tone telephone.

14
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,330
If you have a question
about a parking ticket...

15
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,662
please press "2"now.

16
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:58,225
If you're being robbed
or murdered, press "3."

17
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,432
If you're calling for
Detective Boyle directly...

18
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,772
or have questions about how you can
become an Amway distributor...

19
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,506
just like me, leave
your message after the tone.

20
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,675
Boyle. This is Captain Finletter.

21
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,150
I want you to get up
to Crystal Mountain right away.

22
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,655
We've got two homicides.
Messy ones.

23
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,285
Hey, Rood.

24
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,626
Over here.

25
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,868
Lance. Look.

26
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,133
We got a body here,
and a body there.

27
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:39,041
Hey, come on. A move like that could
cost me my Duncan Triple-A rating.

28
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,340
- Come on. They're right over here.
- Yeah? How bad is it?

29
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,575
Twelve years on the force,
I have never seen anything like it.

30
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,653
- Cheese!
- Excuse me. This one is cut up real bad.

31
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,825
Ugh. Boy, that hockey's
a rough sport.

32
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,862
He stinks, too.
Smell like my granddaddy. Eew.

33
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,398
That's not the worst of it.

34
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,766
Are you sure you're ready for this, Lance?
It's not a pretty picture.

35
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:08,432
Hey, when you've been around as long
as I have, pal, you've seen it- Oh!

36
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:12,568
Gross!

37
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,443
You want us to take blood samples
before the tomato expert get here?

38
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,642
Uh, blood samples?
Sure, go ahead. Oh!

39
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,219
- What tomato expert?
- DoctorJohnson.

40
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,347
From the university.
Captain recommended her.

41
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,584
- Tomatologist.
- Toma-what?

42
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,923
Tomatologist.
Tomato research scientist.

43
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,996
Maybe I should be
impressed or something.

44
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,032
But I'm not buying any of this
"tomato attack" baloney.

45
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,967
Whoo! Here she come.
Miss America. Mm, mm, mm.

46
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:47,109
Gentlemen. I am Dr. Johnson
from the university.

47
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:51,274
I got here as quickly as...
I could.

48
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,714
Oh, my God.

49
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,723
Did anyone see any tomatoes?

50
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,692
No, but we did have a report
of renegade broccoli in the area...

51
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,854
and I've been keeping my eye
on that raspberry bush over there-

52
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:08,024
What the lieutenant means is,
we're checking out all possible leads.

53
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,466
That's fine. But I'd like to
take a look around myself.

54
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,061
- If you don't mind.
- Not at all.

55
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,072
Need any help, Doc?

56
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,734
No, thanks, dick.

57
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,074
Careful. You're drooling
on the evidence.

58
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,841
- Ah, she's not even my type.
- Smart and beautiful.

59
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,042
- No wonder she's lookin' at me.
- Yeah. With pity.

60
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,119
- Damn!
- When are you gonna learn how to shave?

61
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,849
Aah!

62
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,954
Fr-eeze!

63
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,004
One, two, three.

64
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,578
Lance. Come on.

65
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,738
- I got him! I got him!
- Come on. Let's go. Come on.

66
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,748
Come on. Up, up, up.

67
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,719
Hmm. Look like a human hair.
Like a fake mustache.

68
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,794
You're right. It even
has a booger in it.

69
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,489
Why would a bush
have a booger?

70
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:16,193
It's not a booger,
Detective. It's...

71
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,702
tomato juice.

72
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,931
Just a minute.

73
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,000
L- Just a minute!

74
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,774
I said, just a minute!

75
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,097
Almost overnight,
this man has emerged...

76
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,675
as the hottest star
on television.

77
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,835
Known simply as "Jeronahew,"

78
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,938
his Talk to Your Friends show
has skyrocketed to number one.

79
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,779
Who is he?
Where does he come from?

80
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,115
America's newest celebrity
isn't saying.

81
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,453
And it really doesn't matter
to his legions of adoring fans.

82
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,494
Igor!

83
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,792
The Talk to Your Friends show
has become the talk of the town.

84
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,664
Every town, if one believes
the latest ratings.

85
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,671
Broadcasting from his secluded studio
high atop Crystal Mountain...

86
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:38,335
Jeronahew gives America
what it wants to see- and then some.

87
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,175
Mr. And Mrs. America:
Perversity...

88
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:47,275
or simply a desperate,
misguided stab at the ultimate?

89
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:51,823
Jeronahew:
Color him brash, bold, controversial.

90
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,290
And very, very successful.

91
00:09:54,393 --> 00:10:00,093
Jeronahew: The new lord
of tabloid television.

92
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,667
Reporting for
Entertainment Ad Nauseam-

93
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,067
"Lord of tabloid television. "
Not bad.

94
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,164
Here are those overnight ratings,
Dr. Gangreen.

95
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,005
- I told you never to call me that!
- I'm sorry, Geronimo.

96
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:16,639
Not Geronimo! Jeronahew. Hugh Downs.
Hugh Hefner. Humongous!

97
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,445
Excuse me, Jeronahew.

98
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,713
I told you never to touch me.

99
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,881
It's Jeronahew, and
don't ever touch me.

100
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:31,894
Oh, ratings are up
all across the board.

101
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,456
Young. Old. And we're killing
in the 18-to-35-year-olds...

102
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,765
who-never-graduated-
from-junior-high-school market.

103
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,136
Oh, my plan is working perfectly.
Flawlessly!

104
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,641
- Who are the guests today, dweeb?
- Three heroes.

105
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,475
Heroes? Well, that's good. Talk show
audiences love heroes. Who are they?

106
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,209
Dr. KennediJohnson.
Big-time tomatologist.

107
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,809
Wilbur Finletter. Former government
agent and hero of both tomato wars.

108
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,354
And... Fuzzy Tomato.

109
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,254
- F. T?
- Yes. He's famous!

110
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,759
Of course he's famous, you dolt!

111
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,989
You were there.
Don't you remember?

112
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,361
That ungrateful little fuzz ball...

113
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,162
came from my laboratory-
I made him!

114
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,760
And then what happens? Hejoins
that boob, Finletter...

115
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:17,002
and foils my most recent plan
to rule the world!

116
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,101
I was that close, and Finletter
and that little mutant...

117
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,544
stumbled in
and ruined everything.

118
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,548
- I'm sorry, professor.
- What?

119
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,016
I mean, Jeronahew.
I'll cancel the show if you want me to.

120
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,610
No, no, no, no, no. Wait.

121
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:34,716
This may be the perfect opportunity
to throw everyone completely off my trail.

122
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,660
Book 'em, Igor.

123
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,228
Hey, turn it to Channel 5.
The captain's on.

124
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:52,239
It's time for America's
man of the hour, Jeronahew.

125
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,472
Today, Jeronahew welcomes
Captain Wilbur Finletter...

126
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,950
Tomatologist KennediJohnson,
and famous vegetable, Fuzzy Tomato.

127
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,111
Hey, Rood.
Get a load of this.

128
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,985
Tomatoes:
Love apples or hate mongers?

129
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,552
Tell us, Captain Finletter,
how do you feel about tomatoes now?

130
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,430
How do I feel? Well, Jeronahew,
I've been fighting killer tomatoes...

131
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,434
for over 13 years.

132
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:22,269
I know what they're like. Tomatoes are-
They're-Tomatoes are-

133
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,399
Disgusting? Nauseating?

134
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,104
Incorrigible? Odious? Loathsome?
Repulsive? Hideous? Contemptible?

135
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,113
- No, uh-
- Antisocial?

136
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,479
- That's it!
- So you really believe...

137
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,950
teensy-weensy tomatoes
are dangerous?

138
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,784
Well, not all tomatoes.
I believe what Captain Finletter means...

139
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,120
is that there are bad tomatoes...

140
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,593
and there are good tomatoes.

141
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,290
Ah, yes. The famous "F. T."

142
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:51,199
A good tomato.
You're not dangerous, are you?

143
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:55,501
- Danger? No.
- You wouldn't turn your back on a former friend, would you?

144
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,872
- Friend?
- You're not the type to betray a friendship...

145
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,707
double-cross a confidante, turn against
the very person who created you?

146
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:08,148
Tomatoes. Basically
sweet, harmless creatures.

147
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,814
With one notable exception.

148
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:19,296
That's not fair!
Everybody loves F. T!

149
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,492
And that exception is F. T...

150
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,935
and the lowlife humans who make
a living from people's irrational fear...

151
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,371
of red vegetables.

152
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,612
Oh!

153
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,515
There are no killer tomatoes.

154
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,552
You got that right.

155
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,181
I'm glad you could join me
today, because...

156
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,191
I'm your friend.

157
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:51,627
And you can always talk
to your friend.

158
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:00,528
You tell 'em, Jeronahew.
"My friend. " Yeah, right.

159
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,335
Wait until I try to borrow
his lawn mower.

160
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,536
- Lance, haven't you got
anything better to do?

161
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,943
Oh, sure. While the captain
does the talk show circuit...

162
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,948
I get all the best cases.

163
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,280
Like this woman who claims that
Martians invaded her house...

164
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,285
and reupholstered her furniture?

165
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:20,017
In pink corduroy, no less. 23 reported
sightings of Elvis at the Bowlarama.

166
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,525
And these swell tomato murders.

167
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,256
When am I gonna get a real case?

168
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,394
Let's face it, Lance.
Your image isn't the best.

169
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,493
- Hey, I'm as good a cop as anyone in the city.
- Maybe.

170
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:35,972
But you gotta prove it first. Now, these
tomato murders might be your big break.

171
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,976
Solve them, and
you become a hero like F.T.

172
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:44,311
Tomato murders? Ha! There's
no such thing as a "killer tomato. "

173
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:48,716
There's a logical explanation here, and it
doesn't have anything to do with vegetables.

174
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:53,451
Detectives. Boyle.

175
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,960
What? Yeah.

176
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:01,294
Well, I'm off to save the world from another
vicious, unprovoked produce attack.

177
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,769
Told you I should have gone into the Midas
Muffler manager training program.

178
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,307
Au revoir, Mr. Big Shot.

179
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,245
Oh, my God.
You should have seen it!

180
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,337
I was driving along,
and I turned the corner-

181
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,008
- Oh, it was terrible!
- Boy, I'll say.

182
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,177
They'll never get this stuff
off the seat covers.

183
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,915
Oh! It was awful.
They robbed me. I sent a call for help.

184
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,457
And then they took
the whole news crew hostage.

185
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,392
- Who did?
- Tomatoes. A whole gaggle of them.

186
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,690
- "Gaggle"?
- Giggle. Goggle. Gurgle. Gazillion.

187
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:10,235
Like a herd. A horde.
A- A-A litter. Well, a whole lot.

188
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,969
- Oh, ho!
- Oh, ho, lads.

189
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,312
What do we have in here?
Ah, good work, boys.

190
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,317
Good work.

191
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,756
Here's a snack for ya.

192
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,759
- More food! More food!
- What?

193
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:38,796
- More food.
- More fertilizer?

194
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,923
You've already had plenty.
Be glad for what you got. Get out of here.

195
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,693
More food!

196
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,500
I said, out of here!

197
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,043
Here's Cal Worthington
and his dog, Spot!

198
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,450
The power...

199
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,721
of really bad television.

200
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,060
It's universal.

201
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:19,126
This time, I shall not fail.

202
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,599
No! No! No!

203
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,694
Yes. Hello, Police.

204
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,202
I'd like to report
a killer tomato attack.

205
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,706
Mm-hmm.

206
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,659
This is great. You know,
I've been a reporter for 23 years...

207
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:09,257
and this is the first time I've ever seen
anyone show us any kind of appreciation.

208
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,132
Yeah. I'd love
to be a reporter.

209
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,569
I mean, I am one.

210
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,800
- Can I have your autograph?
- Charles!

211
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:20,071
Charles White.
Hey, fellow, long time no see.

212
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:23,238
Betty! Willy Makeit.
Willy Makeit, Betty Won't.

213
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,543
- Betty, nice to meet you.
- When was the last time?

214
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,745
Oh, I remember. It was when that train
demolished that school bus, wasn't it?

215
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,755
No. No, it was the mass poisoning
at the old folks' home.

216
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,984
Of course! Love your hair. Like mine?

217
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:38,153
Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the distinguished press...

218
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,232
welcome to Media Appreciation Day.

219
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,496
In our own small way, we would
like to show our gratitude...

220
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,299
for the finejob
you have all been doing...

221
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,603
filming disasters,
interviewing grieving relatives...

222
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,542
and trivializing
important world events.

223
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,977
We would like to begin
our celebration...

224
00:21:56,081 --> 00:22:00,381
by inviting you all to the food pavilion
for free refreshments.

225
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:22,767
- Hey, what's going on?
- I think we're moving.

226
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,638
Hey, maybe we're going
for takeout.

227
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:29,305
Tell me: How did you feel when you
realized that you were being kidnapped?

228
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:01,271
Detective Boyle, right? Does
Ringling Brothers know you're available?

229
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:04,103
I could use a hand.

230
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:09,807
Very funny.

231
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,281
New urban
crime-fighting gear?

232
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,046
Hey, don't mess with my toys.

233
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,815
- I came here to help. If you
don't need me, then- - Wait!

234
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:20,084
I'm sorry.

235
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,559
I guess I'm still a little shook up.
Please?

236
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:28,463
Okay. Tell me what
happened, Dr. Johnson.

237
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:33,664
- First off, I'll need your full name.
- Kennedi. KennediJohnson.

238
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:38,266
I was conceived during the 1960
Democratic National Convention.

239
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:41,311
- Second ballot.
- Makes sense.

240
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:45,611
Now, where were you when this...
alleged attack took place?

241
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,914
- I was taking a shower.
- Naked?

242
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,614
Just asking!

243
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,691
Could be important.

244
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,925
Hmm.

245
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,596
- What is it?
- Nasty soap scum.

246
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,503
You know, there's a fine Amway product
that'll take that off in no time.

247
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:13,009
- You spray the stuff on- - Great. I
call for a cop, I get Hints from Heloise.

248
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,739
We are talking
attempted murder here. Twice!

249
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,872
I don't see any tomatoes, do you?

250
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,178
That's because I smashed
them down the drain!

251
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,981
Oh, sure. Let me see.
You were taking a shower...

252
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:26,216
a tomato broke into your apartment,
snuck into your bathroom...

253
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:30,556
flung open your shower curtain, scoped out
this nasty soap scum, and tried to kill you.

254
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,995
Let me get out my birth certificate.
Ah, yeah. The 15th.

255
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,863
I was born yesterday.
I'm buyin' this.

256
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,699
I know it sounds far-fetched,
but you've got to believe me!

257
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,069
You do research, right?
Research on tomatoes?

258
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,165
We've established that.

259
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:49,213
Well, has anyone else
reported any tomato attacks?

260
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,248
Well, not exactly.

261
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,216
So, your credibility
ranks somewhere between...

262
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,947
used car salesman
and TVpreacher.

263
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,148
I need something more concrete-

264
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:04,627
More concrete?

265
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,756
I'll have you know that I graduated
in the top 314 in my class...

266
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:13,270
from Ivy League University, president of the
debate team, varsity field hockey cocaptain...

267
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:16,238
sorority 16-ounce Budweiser
chug champion.

268
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,174
Maybe you've heard the expression,
"We ain't leavin' till we're heavin"'?

269
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,802
Well, I wrote that.
That's right, Detective Boyle.

270
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,405
I possess more than a couple of things
in my favor when it comes to credibility.

271
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:30,511
If you think that you can just waltz into
my house and question my veracity- well!

272
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:35,958
You've got another thing coming,
Mr. Hotshot Super Dude!

273
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,621
Are you listening to me?

274
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:44,097
Oh! I have been attacked
without provocation.

275
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,102
Hmm.

276
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:49,571
Twice! Now, you are
a public servant.

277
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,199
So serve!

278
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:57,704
Help! He's got me!

279
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,580
I'm being strangled!

280
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,364
Piece o' cake, boss.

281
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:19,893
- I locked 'em all in the brainwash room.
- Perfect.

282
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:23,372
Flawless. Reporters.

283
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,137
Hair spray.

284
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,610
Let me tell you
about a kid, Igor.

285
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,181
An eight-year-old,
insecure, fragile child...

286
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:35,378
who rose from obscurity
to win-yes, win...

287
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:40,356
the second grade spelling bee
of Washington Elementary School.

288
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:47,189
Was that good enough
for the evening news? No!

289
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,461
So I despise the media.

290
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,593
But I had a plan.

291
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,435
To rise above it. To become
the best media personality ever.

292
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,441
And when the public
started to support me...

293
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:01,376
the rest of the media
snubbed me at every turn.

294
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:05,347
"You're not a journalist.
You're a talk show host. "

295
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,975
Why, I can't even
get a press pass.

296
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:12,682
Did I get an invitation to
Jane Pauley's baby shower? No.

297
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:17,421
Does Willard Scott announce
my birthday on the air? Uh-uh.

298
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,430
Did I go to the Shriver-Schwarzenegger
wedding? No!

299
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,366
Why, Ed McMahon never even
sent me a sweepstakes entry.

300
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,535
Well.

301
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:34,010
If you can't join 'em, beat 'em!

302
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:43,817
Step one is complete.
Now comes the good stuff.

303
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:51,658
It's okay. You can laugh.

304
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,031
- Boyle!
- Sir?

305
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:05,735
How's that investigation coming
into those tomato attacks?

306
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,642
Oh, I'm sure I'll get to the bottom of it
just as soon as I crack...

307
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,772
that "Bowling Elvis" mystery.

308
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,283
You still think this
is a joke, don't you?

309
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,786
Not at all. I'm fully prepared.
Tomato Be Gone.

310
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:21,484
- Economy size.
- Listen, buster. This is no joke.

311
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,528
Reports of criminal tomato activity
are on the increase.

312
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:28,395
I want you to go down to the university
and pick Dr. Johnson's brain.

313
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,765
I'd do it myself, but I'm doing Oprah
this afternoon.

314
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,240
Good thing he didn't see my can
of Captain Be Gone.

315
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,121
Wow. Neat. Hmm.

316
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:43,638
On our expedition, we found
that the tomato was our friend.

317
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,803
Brother. Tomato Pods.

318
00:30:56,321 --> 00:31:01,156
- Anybody home?
- Well, well, well. Detective Boyle.

319
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,558
I see we survived the banana attack.

320
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,892
I'd like you to meet F.T.
Fuzzy Tomato?

321
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:10,058
- This is the detective I was telling you about.
- Mm!

322
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,864
Oh, right.
The TV star.

323
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,873
- Don't eat me, okay?
- F.T. Is a good tomato.

324
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:20,502
- Man's best friend.
- Really? Man's best friend.

325
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:25,572
- Play dead, fuzz face.
- Tomatoes aren't born bad. Some are just grown that way.

326
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,583
Yeah. Right.

327
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,347
Detective!

328
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,423
Watch. Watch this.

329
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:36,050
In this tank are five piranha fish
from the Black Sea.

330
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,221
The most dangerous predator
known to man- until now.

331
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,974
Impressive, but
hardly convincing.

332
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,205
You'd be convinced, if you'd
studied tomatoes the way I have.

333
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,010
They can be
very dangerous.

334
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,517
And they despise humans.

335
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,782
When are you going to get it through
your head that there is no such thing...

336
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,914
as a killer tomato?

337
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:11,223
Fine! If that's what you believe,
then why are you here?

338
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:15,663
- The captain made me come.
- So sorry you're put through such torture.

339
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,235
Well, that's what
they pay me for.

340
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,861
Glad to see my tax dollars
are going to such a good cause.

341
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,202
You stay out of this.
I'm leaving.

342
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,610
- Good.
- Good.

343
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,478
Good!

344
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,881
He's amusing.
I'll give him that.

345
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,183
Tomatology.

346
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,124
Uh-huh. Oh.
One moment.

347
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,457
- It's for you. The zoo.
- Hello?

348
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:01,534
Damn!

349
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:55,796
"Stay away from
KennediJohnson or else.

350
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,926
Signed, Your Friend. "

351
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,644
"Your Friend. "
Yeah, right.

352
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:17,915
F.T., you little slime.
I'm on to you.

353
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,990
Here he is. I'm sorry.
We got here as quick as we could.

354
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,755
Hey. That's my wife.

355
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,525
Hey. Kid line's over there.
Get out. Ow!

356
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:05,124
Hey. Oh, Herb.
I have reservations.

357
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,786
No. Leave me alone.
Not the legs.

358
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,363
Don't push.
Not the legs. No!

359
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,509
Come on, Sheila.
This way.

360
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,744
Sheila, stop it.

361
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:57,719
Aah!

362
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,790
Sheila! Bad dog.

363
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,318
Good afternoon, everyone...

364
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:09,798
and welcome to the zoo's
spectacular aquabatics show.

365
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,768
Today, we have a very special treat.

366
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,600
Please welcome our
surprise celebrity guest:

367
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,504
The world-famous F. T.

368
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,009
Boo!

369
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:30,053
And now, on with the show!

370
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,301
Yippee! Yea!

371
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,622
Hello, Bulgarian Embassy?

372
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,289
This is Jeronahew.
That's "Hugh," as in "Hugh Hefner. "

373
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,367
Oh! You know the show!

374
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:20,130
Thank you. I enjoy doing it myself.

375
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,433
Would you hold on, please?

376
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,508
Shut up!
I'm on long distance.

377
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,100
- Hello.
- Da.

378
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:31,147
I'd like to buy 30 minutes
on Bulgarian TVThursday night.

379
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,116
Price is no object.

380
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,585
Thank you.

381
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:40,987
Yes. I'll send an autographed photo.
Good-bye!

382
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,253
Perfect!

383
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,635
Open the door!

384
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,972
Oh! The city's finest.

385
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,209
Back!

386
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:09,116
Friends of yours?

387
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,815
Maybe they smell
Australian Bush Dog.

388
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:16,882
Oh, really? Sounds like
you've been to the zoo.

389
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:19,258
Look, whether you like it or not...

390
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,890
Detective Rood and I have been assigned
to protect you 24 hours a day...

391
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,063
seven days a week,
364 days a year.

392
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:31,039
- Three hundred and sixty-four?
- Groundhog Day.

393
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,976
Terrific. My worst nightmares
are coming to life.

394
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,604
I'm flattered that you dream
about me, but right now...

395
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,683
I need to take a shower.

396
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,685
Ugh. All right!

397
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:47,554
But I'm only doing this for my sake.
You are smelling up my apartment.

398
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,092
A thousand thanks.

399
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:02,002
Igor? It's time
to terminate a certain tomatologist.

400
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:12,209
- Much better.
- Nice legs, Detective.

401
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:15,513
Do you have any accessories
to go with it? Maybe some pumps...

402
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,587
and a nice necklace?

403
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,885
May I offer you a drink instead?

404
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,357
Sure. Uh, hot chocolate?

405
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,589
- Would you like something in that?
- Uh, marshmallows?

406
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,633
- I'll see what I have.
- The little ones are great. You get one in every gulp.

407
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:37,571
- Mind if I turn on your TV set?
- Be my guest.

408
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:41,111
- It's now, it's new.
It's me, it's you.

409
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,147
It's Jeronahew-
the people's friend.

410
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,580
This show is everywhere.

411
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,744
Well, I watch
a lot of television...

412
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,118
and I like the show
because first...

413
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:57,388
Jeronahew talks, and then the guests talk,
and now I get to talk.

414
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:00,953
I trust him more than
my own mother.

415
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,057
I can tell you this.

416
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:08,070
If more kids watched it,
there'd be a lot less...

417
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,304
potential criminals
out there.

418
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,179
Great.

419
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:22,809
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

420
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,523
Not bad
for no marshmallows.

421
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:31,925
- Not bad for no clothes.
- Thanks for caring.

422
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:37,926
- Hey, now. That's a nice family.
- Why, thank you.

423
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,869
Actually, I don't
have a family. Yet!

424
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,668
That's my sister's-

425
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,211
The picture that
came with the frame.

426
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:51,008
Oh, yeah. I thought
I recognized that. I have the...

427
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:55,882
same frame family on my desk too.

428
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,355
Yeah.

429
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,789
My father pushed me
into science.

430
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:05,020
Not that I mind,
it's just that-

431
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:08,690
Well,
I had a dream.

432
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,996
- It was stupid.
- No, tell me.

433
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:15,333
Well-

434
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,999
I wanted to be a dancer.

435
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,542
- Topless?
- Ballet.

436
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,908
Oh, right.

437
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:26,972
- So, where do I sleep?
- How about in your apartment in your bed?

438
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,520
Now, wait just a minute
there, Doctor Einstein.

439
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,522
I'm supposed to protect you.
I can't do that from 20 miles away.

440
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:37,253
Then sleep in the hallway.
In the alley. In the street! I don't care.

441
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:41,092
- But you're not spending the night in this apartment.
- And what about your safety?

442
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,359
I thought you were afraid of things
that go squish in the night.

443
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:48,166
Ha! I've managed to survive two killer
tomato attacks without your help.

444
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,763
Fine. Fine.
You don't need my help.

445
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,503
What, are we afraid the detective's
going to jump our bones?

446
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,239
Let me tell you one thing-
it's going to take a lot more...

447
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,781
than a pair of shapely legs,
a great figure...

448
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:01,545
and full, pouting, sensual,
collagen-injected lips...

449
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,847
- to keep me here.
- Good!

450
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,385
Out!

451
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:13,160
I'll tell you one thing
right now- I'll be back!

452
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,961
Because when you call a professional,
you get what you paid for!

453
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:21,064
Official police business.
Break it up.

454
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,375
Ow! Damn it!

455
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,861
Remember, Leo-
the only good tomatologist...

456
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,201
- is a dead tomatologist.
- Don't worry, boss.

457
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,841
Go for it.

458
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,516
Break a leg, Maurice.

459
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,950
Is this a great job, or what?

460
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,026
Basically, you get up
when you want to...

461
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,322
you're your own boss,
the pay's not bad...

462
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,590
and you get
to rule the world.

463
00:43:54,698 --> 00:44:00,193
I love it.

464
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,514
Excuse me.

465
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,056
Forgot my shoes.
Is that a crime?

466
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,160
Help!

467
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,802
Lance! Thank God you came back.
That was great!

468
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:21,908
Not that great.
I'm still hooking to the left.

469
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,954
I guess I owe you an apology.
Maybe there is something...

470
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:28,388
to this tomato thing after all.

471
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:32,485
- Why did you come back?
- A good detective can sense danger.

472
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:36,555
- Aah!
- Oh! Maybe you should stay here, after all.

473
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,963
Maybe I should.

474
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,974
But you're still sleeping
in the living room.

475
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,101
Damn!

476
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:17,863
I want to make a transfer of $400 from
my savings account to my checking account.

477
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:20,808
Are you laughing at me?
Are you laughing at me?

478
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:24,005
You callin' me Pee-wee Head?
You callin' me Pee-wee Head?

479
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,548
She's callin' me Pee-wee Head!
Can you believe this over here?

480
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,777
Go ahead. Say "Pee-wee Head. "
Go ahead. Say it, say it!

481
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:32,447
- I'm not calling you anything.
- You calling me Lee Harvey Oswald Head?

482
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,423
You calling me
Lee Harvey Oswald Head? Huh?

483
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,289
She's calling me Lee Harvey Oswald Head.
Can you believe this?

484
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,328
Say Lee Harvey Oswald Head.
Say it, say it, say it!

485
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,830
All I want
is a simple transfer.

486
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:46,027
Are you calling me Mr. Potato Head?
You are calling me Mr. Potato Head.

487
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,400
- Aren't you, chick? Yeah! Yes, you are.
- No.

488
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:52,703
No, I'll show you Mr. Potato Head.
This is Mr. Potato Head!

489
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,745
- Go ahead! Say it, say it!
- If only you would listen to me.

490
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,371
You callin' me "Banjo
Player from Deliverance"?

491
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:05,087
No. I'm calling you the teller who's
being robbed and then held hostage.

492
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:14,591
Put the pedal to the metal, dude!

493
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:16,859
Drive, dweeb, drive!

494
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,699
This is getting weird, Lance.

495
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,536
Bank tellers, hockey players,
media types...

496
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:27,542
all gone.

497
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:31,136
And The City News
is being printed by schoolkids.

498
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:33,682
I really like the new
easy-to-read format.

499
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:37,117
Get serious, will ya.
It's your butt that's on the line.

500
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,689
- Any bright ideas, Sherlock?
- Oh, Captain!

501
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:43,351
Can we talk to you for a minute?
We have a tomato-related question.

502
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,519
Ah, tomatoes.
Red spuds.

503
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,256
Alar-covered veggies.

504
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,889
Migrant worker backache-producers.
Flamed fruits.

505
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,400
Bad-act audience bombs.

506
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,835
Produce boy,
bug-infested nightmares.

507
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,339
Yeah, I know tomatoes.
What about 'em?

508
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,603
Uh, well,
about those tomato murders-

509
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,544
Ah, tomato murders,
the kind of sick, senseless violence...

510
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:07,242
that makes a cat want to have his guts
ripped out and turned into racquet strings...

511
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:10,582
to be used by McEnroe
while he belittles chair umpires.

512
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,588
Yeah, the kind of blatant
disregard for human life...

513
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,352
that makes an otherwise decent
grade-school teacher...

514
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,928
want to drag her fingernails
on the blackboard...

515
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,429
until her pupils'eardrums
begin to bleed.

516
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,396
The kind of senseless,
needless-

517
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,434
Uh, Captain, um...

518
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:30,438
where do you think, on the remote chance
that there are such things as killer tomatoes...

519
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,976
that a detective might go to find
information to crack this case?

520
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,942
Try the Slip Inn.

521
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,241
Ask for Sam Smith.
He runs the place.

522
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,249
Old war buddy of mine.
Ex-F.V.I.

523
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,784
"F.V. I?"

524
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:46,913
Federal Vegetable
Investigations.

525
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,954
God will get you for this.

526
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,865
You see,
my pencil-necked friend...

527
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,595
soon I will control
the media completely...

528
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,866
and he who controls the media
controls the world!

529
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,873
And he who controls
the world...

530
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,341
does not have to
stand in line!

531
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:12,177
Aah! You may think you're the big, bad
boss of the world, but you're not.

532
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,682
Go ahead, you small-minded dink.
Make fun.

533
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,185
And speaking of fun,
let's have some.

534
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,448
I'll do the laughing.

535
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:21,956
You know what
I like to do for fun?

536
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,688
I like to drive around the city and collect
all the dead cats I can find...

537
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,697
take 'em home and,
oh, I don't know...

538
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,699
put 'em in a circle...

539
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:35,670
and, for a few precious moments,
I am the leader!

540
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,624
Land 13 to Base.
Land-

541
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,769
Damn.

542
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:13,570
"Lance, I'm being
attacked by a swarm of vicious tomatoes.

543
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,241
"If you never see me again...

544
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,746
- "it's been swell.
- Shoo!

545
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:22,751
P.S. Tell Captain Finletter
he's a good-for-noth"-

546
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,753
- That's it.
- My God, that's awful.

547
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,755
I'll say.

548
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:30,258
There's one, two, three punctuation
errors, he misspelled "vicious"-

549
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,555
And what's a "good-for-noth"?

550
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,028
Look!
There's more!

551
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,400
"If you want
to see Rood again...

552
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:41,403
"stay away from KennediJohnson.

553
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,338
Signed, Your Friend. "

554
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,142
Now, that's penmanship.
Look at this "K"-

555
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,145
What are you going
to do?

556
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,909
Well, I guess the first thing
we'd better do...

557
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,917
is check out that bar
Captain Finletter told me about.

558
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,919
"We?"

559
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:00,922
- You mean you're inviting me to come along?
- Huh?

560
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:04,357
Uh, sure. I mean, I am assigned
to work with you.

561
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,521
And, anyway, I guess I don't mind
you hanging around.

562
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:11,533
Why, after last night
I didn't even think you liked me.

563
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:16,129
Well, "like"
is a pretty strong word.

564
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:43,622
A- Actually, I-
I think I'm falling for you!

565
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,466
What?

566
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:50,005
I said, I think I'm-

567
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:55,072
L-

568
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,636
I think I'm falling-

569
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:01,444
I think I'm-

570
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,451
I think I'm...

571
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:07,148
Falling!

572
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,292
What was it
you were trying to say?

573
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:14,761
Uh, somebody oughta close that window
over there. It's a little drafty.

574
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,265
- Oh.
- Come on. We'd better get going.

575
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:20,097
Right.
I'll get my coat.

576
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:23,172
Good-for-noth?
Bush for the booger?

577
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:41,283
This could get dangerous...

578
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:43,291
so try not to
act conspicuous...

579
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:45,691
and do exactly
what I do.

580
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,130
Run for it! These tomatoes are killers!

581
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,855
Oy vey.

582
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,528
There you go, bro.
I said just a minute!

583
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,067
Huh?

584
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,881
Oh, here we go!

585
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:09,368
Don't get many
two-legged types in here.

586
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,379
What'll it be?

587
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:13,415
Uh, Bloody Mary.

588
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,780
No, no!

589
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,785
- Make that a club soda.
- Me too.

590
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,788
That's better.

591
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,858
Be right with you.

592
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,570
Hey, daddy,
lose the cash cow.

593
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,723
- Cut that out.
- Sorry.

594
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:58,052
Are you sure
we're in the right place?

595
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,562
Hickory-dickory-
Dock.

596
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,033
Kinda gives new meaning
to the term "salad bar,"doesn't it?

597
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,104
You two looking for someone?

598
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:09,228
- No.
- Yes.

599
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,806
- Yeah.
- No.

600
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,807
No.

601
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,707
Well, actually,
Captain Finletter sent us.

602
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,905
Finletter.

603
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:21,245
Kinda figured he had
something to do with this.

604
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,911
Check out the booth
over there.

605
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,556
Hey, you!

606
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,819
Stop chewin'
on the table!

607
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:32,895
Stupid tomatoes.

608
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,802
Nice hat.

609
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,633
- What did he say?
- He likes yours too.

610
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:44,707
I'll handle this.

611
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:59,113
- He needs a hundred bucks.
- A hundred bucks?

612
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,665
He needs the other 50.

613
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,997
- The-
- Get it!

614
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,772
Uh-huh.

615
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,174
Right.

616
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:26,347
Got it.
Thanks.

617
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,417
Come on.
Let's get outta here.

618
00:56:29,652 --> 00:56:31,552
Well? Well?
What did he say?

619
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:34,020
He said,
"Follow the stars. "

620
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:37,855
"Follow the stars"? A hundred and
fifty bucks for "Follow the stars"?

621
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,361
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know!

622
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:42,863
You're the cop!
Start acting like one! Come on!

623
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:45,196
Let's...
rock and roll!

624
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,288
This is fruitless.

625
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:50,833
That astrologist told me I had a future
in car parts. Do you see car parts in there?

626
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:55,837
Will you stop! We have been at this
all day with nothing to show for it.

627
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,635
I know.
I'm really worried about Rood.

628
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:02,302
It's just not like him to be kidnapped
and held hostage.

629
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,642
Think. "Follow the stars. "

630
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,874
It has to mean something.

631
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,154
Hey. Hey! Hey!

632
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:22,959
Wait for me! Wait-Aw!

633
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,935
That's it! Jeronahew's
Camp Broadcasting School!

634
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,437
- Not affiliated with CBS, Incorporated.
- Of course!

635
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,441
That place up on Crystal Mountain!
What better spot for a hideout?

636
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:36,444
And it's only a half mile
from where we found those bodies.

637
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:40,243
Kennedi, grab your
Charlie's Angels lunch box.

638
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,614
We're going back to school.

639
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:58,525
Oh, God-

640
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,686
This place gives me the creeps.

641
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:21,689
What did you pack in this suitcase?

642
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:25,693
Why is it so dark? Maybe we
should come back later. There's nobody here.

643
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:29,356
Good evening and welcome
to Camp Broadcasting School.

644
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:32,593
Not affiliated with CBS, Incorporated
or the Columbia School of Broadcasting.

645
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,602
It's a great night
for checking in.

646
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:37,468
I'm your clerk,
Charles White.

647
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,371
What can I do for you?

648
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:41,375
Uh, we'd like a room, please.

649
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,104
Rookies? Great.

650
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,112
Just sign right here,
and you're in.

651
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:47,114
Don't use our real names.

652
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,116
What name am I
supposed to use?

653
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,118
I don't know.
Think of something.

654
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,120
- Is there a problem?
- Uh, no.

655
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:56,885
We just got married
and can't decide which name to use.

656
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,120
Well, how about
Fahrvergnuegen?

657
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,458
It's my favorite.

658
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,465
Thank you.

659
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:08,162
Bellboy, please show
Mr. And Mrs. Goodwrench to their room.

660
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,847
Looks heavy.

661
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,921
Uh, bird-watching equipment.

662
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,657
Thanks anyway, pal. I got it.

663
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,284
Oh! Thank you!

664
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,523
Hey, does that bellboy
look a little familiar to you?

665
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,124
- Uh, I didn't notice.
- Wait a minute. I recognize him now.

666
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,136
That's F.T. I knew that shaggy beach ball
was up to something.

667
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:45,139
You've got it all wrong.
F.T. Is our friend.

668
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:48,642
I asked him to come here and snoop around.
I thought maybe he could help us.

669
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:52,181
Well, I
Hope he has a day job.

670
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,981
Ah, newlyweds.

671
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:08,796
Bird-watching equipment!

672
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,798
Goodwrench.

673
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,993
Yeah, I think that astrologer
put a car hex on me.

674
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,332
Lance, let's get started.

675
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,338
Right.

676
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,465
We've got to find Rood.

677
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:27,012
I thought I told you
to pack binoculars.

678
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:29,346
We'll see much farther
with that.

679
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,910
Now, we need a password
or a secret knock.

680
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,219
- Secret knock?
- Yes.

681
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:55,409
Z- No, no.
That's not it.

682
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:57,411
X- L-Z- No.

683
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:59,413
Z- L-

684
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,813
Xylophone.
X- Y-L-O-P-H-O-N-E. Xylophone.

685
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:05,410
Big deal. So you can spell. That's no reason
for you to kidnap brainwashed reporters.

686
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:07,421
They irritate me, Mr. Rood...

687
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,423
just like greedy politicians...

688
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:12,119
lazy salesclerks and nosy cops.

689
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:15,824
But all that...

690
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,957
is about to change.

691
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:22,060
It's time for a worldwide
attitude adjustment.

692
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,799
Starting with you.

693
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,967
- You're mad!
- No, I'm not mad. Just angry.

694
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,739
- Why, man?
- Why?

695
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:34,749
Don't you just hate it when you're in a movie
theater and the person behind you says...

696
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:38,651
- "Whoa! Watch this! This is where she gets killed!"
- Hey, that happens. Damn!

697
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:42,418
That's nothing compared to when you order
a salad with dressing on the side...

698
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,426
and the waiter brings the salad
40 minutes later...

699
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:48,429
with a huge glob of dressing
all over it.

700
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:51,432
That's not the worst thing
that happens in a restaurant.

701
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:55,026
How come the food you order never
looks like the food in the pictures?

702
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:58,938
And how come you have to ask
for a lousy glass of water?

703
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:12,486
Oww!

704
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:15,489
- Why does it have to be so dark in here?
- Shh!

705
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,492
We can't turn on the light
or somebody might see us.

706
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:20,494
- Can you see anything?
- Yeah.

707
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,496
A big tree.

708
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:25,431
Wait a minute.
It's a nose hair.

709
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,175
Lance!
Look at this.

710
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:38,236
Bingo! That's Rood, all right.
Come on!

711
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:42,450
All right,
one more time, now. Action.

712
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:45,783
Now patching for the Pidres-
pitching for the Padres-

713
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:47,788
Look, just relax.

714
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:51,690
If you say it right,
he will come. Okay.

715
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:55,594
Now pitching for
the Padres, number 11, Craig Lefferts.

716
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:58,724
Uh, go get 'em, Craig.

717
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:05,598
- Hey, all right!
You'll make a broadcaster yet!

718
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:08,836
The give-and-go, and in the paint-

719
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:13,006
Remember, rude
is the secret. Rude. Now try again.

720
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:16,175
Well, all of the sudden
the mightyJets have fallen apart.

721
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:19,379
You guys have allowed
236 goals in the last three games.

722
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:23,822
That's abysmal, atrocious, crummy,
disastrous, despicable, execrable...

723
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,826
God-awful,
horrible, ignominious-

724
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:28,897
We'd be doing a lot better
if our goalie wasn't dead!

725
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:32,559
All right! Rude and obnoxious!

726
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:34,568
Very good!

727
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,571
- Of course. That's it!
- The dead goalie from Scene One.

728
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:40,403
I knew I'd seen him
somewhere before.

729
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:51,218
- It's locked.
- No kidding!

730
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:54,221
We need a lock pick.
What have you got in your purse?

731
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:57,019
Nothing like a lock pick.

732
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:11,171
You're right.
Nothing like a lock pick.

733
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:14,141
They were out of mace.
A girl's gotta protect herself.

734
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:17,212
- What would you like to try first?
- How about "open sesame. "

735
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:26,620
Why is it every time I fly commercial...

736
01:05:26,722 --> 01:05:29,623
my bags are the last ones
off the conveyor belt?

737
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:32,956
- You're lucky. My bags never even get there.
- Wait.

738
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:36,463
- Do you hear that?
- Sometimes people drive me crazy.

739
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,465
Yes, yes, yes!

740
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:41,934
Why does the tallest guy in the ballpark
always sit right in front of me?

741
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:44,939
Yes, and he's the only one
in the whole damn section smoking.

742
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,670
Why is it that a five-minute wait
in a restaurant is more like five years?

743
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,179
Is time different for restaurant people,
like it is for dogs?

744
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:56,479
Precisely! And have you ever had to stand
in a buffet line behind some old lady...

745
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:58,485
picking over the fried chicken?

746
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,488
- You'll starve to death!
- Yeah! Why doesn't somebody do something about that?

747
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:06,254
It drives me crazy when I ask, "Is it Monday
today?" and some idiot says, "Yep, all day!"

748
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,262
Or, "Did you
get a haircut?"

749
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,264
No, I got them all cut!

750
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:13,028
Now that you're in the mood, Mr. Rood...

751
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,035
how about some television?

752
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:19,005
- It's the Universal
Home Shopping Network.

753
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,445
- This cubic zirconium
weed trimmer attachment-

754
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,453
Can't you see
I'm brainwashing?

755
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,455
I'm sorry, Professor-
I mean, Jeronahew.

756
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:36,457
The door downstairs
has been opened.

757
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,460
- Someone has entered the secured area.
- Zounds!

758
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,962
A 19th-century
French pastry decanter.

759
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:44,362
Help me.
Somebody please help me.

760
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:46,298
And speaking of pastries-

761
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:48,495
Rood! Snap out of it!

762
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,504
Lance! Dr. Johnson!

763
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:52,506
Boy, am I glad to see you.

764
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,735
That lunatic was
starting to make sense.

765
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,744
Evan,
you go get the captain.

766
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:01,374
I've got that maladjusted mastermind
right where I want him.

767
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,714
Man, I think you are crazy.

768
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:06,720
But I have always thought
you were crazy.

769
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:10,383
You know,
you'll make a decent cop yet.

770
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,929
And you can really
show off the purple glaze...

771
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,430
- when you place it next to one of these...
- Let's go!

772
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,932
- Right. - Glow-in-the dark,
plastic pineapple centerpieces...

773
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,003
which make great doorstops.

774
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,538
- First thing we gotta do is get rid of that telescope.
- Why?

775
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:29,338
Do you think
they're on to us?

776
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:32,243
Possibly.

777
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:49,063
- That was close!
- More than close!

778
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:52,862
Look at my pajamas!
Now I'm angry!

779
01:08:06,649 --> 01:08:10,380
Help! Help!

780
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:14,582
Ninja tomatoes?
That does it!

781
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:24,499
Damn!

782
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,779
Aha!

783
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:48,750
A piece of broken bark.

784
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,019
I must be getting close.

785
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,478
Hostages.

786
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,708
Good or bad, rich or poor,
foreign or domestic-

787
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:18,378
Do they have a purpose?
How much money do they make?

788
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,388
Today we welcome
two hostages to our show.

789
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,948
One's a former hostage,
one's a hostage now...

790
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:30,464
and maybe some of you
can become future hostages!

791
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,500
On with our show!

792
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:37,303
Today's guests include
former hostage Sherri Coke...

793
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:42,036
author of the best seller The Hostage Diet:
How to Beat the Cravings.

794
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:44,544
And our other guest
is a current hostage.

795
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:47,047
We're not gonna reveal
her name to you right now.

796
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:49,947
We'll see if you can guess who she is
by the end of the show.

797
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:04,198
The booger bush.

798
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,598
I'd recognize it anywhere.

799
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:26,010
Hello! Wilbur! Over here!

800
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:44,438
Great job, Professor.
They love ya!

801
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,703
Yeah, scary, isn't it?
Quickly! It's almost time!

802
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:53,413
Yes, sir, the satellite uplink
is ready.

803
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:56,916
In 30 minutes
the world will be ours.

804
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,919
Yours. I get the-

805
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,855
You get East Lansing and the Kmart
in Rutherford, New Jersey.

806
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,858
- The tomatoes are assembled?
- Yes.

807
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,520
They await you
at the temple of food.

808
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:11,088
Onward to destiny!

809
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:29,616
Oh!

810
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:52,828
Bacon!

811
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:05,308
Lettuce!

812
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,947
Human!

813
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:15,915
A human!

814
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:35,367
Mayonnaise!

815
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:43,310
Pepper!

816
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:51,124
Hold the onion.

817
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,989
Your time has come,
tomatologist.

818
01:13:56,098 --> 01:14:01,161
Your research grant has just
been permanently canceled.

819
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,137
Prepare to meet thy doom.

820
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:08,436
Well, you wanted to be a cop.

821
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:13,180
I would have been bored
in the muffler business anyway.

822
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,740
Your insidious research
to uncover tomato aggression...

823
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,945
was the only possible thing...

824
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:21,147
that could have foiled my plan...

825
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:24,350
for total world domination!

826
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,190
Yes, tomatoes...

827
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:30,356
do hate humans!

828
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:36,769
But only half as much as I do!

829
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:41,608
Stop in the name of the law!
The city police!

830
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,178
Don't move!

831
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:49,312
Igor!

832
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:51,976
Darn!

833
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:54,180
I was afraid
this was gonna happen.

834
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,382
You'll never get away
with this, Jeronahew!

835
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,392
Get away with it, Mr. Boyle?

836
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,519
I already have.

837
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:05,396
I've kidnapped every member of the media.
Hadn't you noticed?

838
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:11,898
Have a look.
See what they've resorted to.

839
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:15,306
From Washington, it's the Evening News.

840
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:18,140
Is that Ted Koppel?

841
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:21,148
America has become
a land of mindless boobs.

842
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:26,711
Americans would watch a chimp read the news.
They are watching a chimp read the news!

843
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:29,052
The tomatoes.

844
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:32,320
- They're going into a feeding frenzy!
- Feeding frenzy?

845
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:35,658
Yes! They hate to wait for food.
You should see them at wedding receptions.

846
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:39,564
- Lfhe doesn't shut up, we're gonna be in real trouble.
- If he does, they'll eat us!

847
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:41,568
Um, so what's your plan?

848
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:46,130
I mean, the kidnappings are nice,
but why all the robberies?

849
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:49,870
To buy television time,
Mr. Boyle, worldwide.

850
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,979
In just five minutes...

851
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:57,450
I'll begin a live broadcast to
every TV station in the entire world!

852
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,954
I'm gonna fix things my way!

853
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:05,493
I'm gonna brainwash every couch potato
on this imperfect planet.

854
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:08,961
Why, the whole human race
makes me sick!

855
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:12,693
Incompetent nincompoops!
Surly bank tellers! Ignorant clerks!

856
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:16,737
People who write six-dollar checks
in supermarket express lanes!

857
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:19,807
Parents who take their crying babies
to movie theaters!

858
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,399
People who drive 58
in the fast lane!

859
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,809
Men who leave
the toilet seat up!

860
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,347
Well, it's true!

861
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:31,613
Yes! What about all those psycho garbagemen
who come around at 4:30 in the morning?

862
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,053
They're not content to just take the
garbage and go. No, no, no, no, no!

863
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:39,389
They've gotta let everyone know they've gotta
get up and go to work in the middle of the night!

864
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:42,395
Yeah! The guy who empties
my Dumpster does that too!

865
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:45,762
Why doesn't he drive that truck into the side
of my building and make sure I'm awake!

866
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:49,325
No, he has to take that big truck-

867
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:57,137
Like he's got one gooey tissue
lodged up in the Dumpster...

868
01:16:57,245 --> 01:17:01,181
and he's gonna shake that thing free if
it's the last thing he does before 5:00 a. M!

869
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,944
- Aah! Look out!
- It worked!

870
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:05,781
- Let's get outta here!
- This way!

871
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,853
Not me, you dolt!
After them!

872
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:14,759
Four minutes to air, Professor!

873
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:17,764
Lose the toast, Igor.

874
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:20,266
It's show time!

875
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:24,731
No! We're trapped!

876
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,207
There has to be a way to open this door-
a button, a lever, a hidden switch!

877
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,868
- Something!
- Yes!

878
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,184
Quick! Lock the door!

879
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:46,727
- Oh!
- Oh, that was close!

880
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,888
- Ain't nobody gonna open this door.
- Oops.

881
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,040
Uh, our mistake.

882
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,872
- We were just, uh-
- Leaving!

883
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:08,310
- Come on, do something!
- Me? Why don't you do something?

884
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:10,817
- I did do something!
- Oh, you did?

885
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:12,819
Yeah! "Let's go in here,"you said.

886
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:15,185
"We'll be safe in here,"
you said.

887
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:17,315
Ha! Maybe I can find
another door.

888
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:25,523
Ohh!

889
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:33,101
New from Whiz Co,
the amazing Chop-A-Matic slicer-dicer.

890
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,109
It slices! It dices!
It meeses! It mices!

891
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,179
The environmentally sensitive
Chop-A-Matic...

892
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,272
features fully digital
manual energy-saving operation.

893
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,749
It's safe and easy to use.
Just watch.

894
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,682
If you want the best,
forget the rest.

895
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:50,690
Look at them. They're completely
hypnotized by that commercial.

896
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:53,727
That's it! They've been reprogrammed
for bad television!

897
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:57,765
Free accessories- all-weather compass,
compatible back-scratcher...

898
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,925
heavy-duty tire gauge...

899
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:02,902
plus the fabulous Flasho-Dasho
for night slicing.

900
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:05,472
Take your Chop-A-Matic anywhere
with this custom desi-

901
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:08,475
Attention, zombies! Cancel the intruders!

902
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,875
Repeat, cancel the intruders!

903
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:12,879
This has been
a public service announcement.

904
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,915
Oh! Do something!

905
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:18,452
Uh, uh, the Rotco
super-amazing cap baffler.

906
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,453
- Opens anything!
- In a jiff!

907
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:22,455
Aah!

908
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:24,457
And that's not all!

909
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:28,093
If you enjoy gardening as much as I do-
and I know you do-

910
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:30,096
you'll love the revolutionary new
Raunchco garden gopher.

911
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:33,793
This super-aluminum cast construction
assures years of worry-free operation.

912
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:35,802
And it's a breeze
to clean!

913
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:39,203
- Simply spray it off when you're finished!
- It's working! Keep going!

914
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:42,071
Um, uh, what would you
pay for all this?

915
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:45,078
Don't answer, because if you order before
midnight we're going to throw in free...

916
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:48,308
a copy of K-Smell's biggest-selling album,
Mike Tyson's Greatest Hits.

917
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,441
March 7:
Bonecrusher Smith!

918
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,421
June 27:
Michael Spinks!

919
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:56,648
August 1:
Robin Givens!

920
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:01,618
Didn't know you were
a fight fan.

921
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,630
- The sweet science!
- Look!

922
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:06,132
Stay tuned forJeronahew's
worldwide television special...

923
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,634
the show guaranteed
to make a brand-new you!

924
01:20:08,737 --> 01:20:11,035
Quick! We have to stop them!

925
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:22,648
- This has gotta be one of my all-time
worst days on the job. - The ketchup!

926
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,117
Use the hammer!
Just do it!

927
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,890
Pour it on me!

928
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:32,892
Now is not the time
to get kinky.

929
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,894
Tomatoes won't
eat their own kind.

930
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:38,898
- If we smell like tomatoes, we'll be safe.
- Okay, you're the expert.

931
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,401
Oh, it would have to be the good stuff!

932
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:47,907
Oh! Oh! Okay!
All right, now you.

933
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,909
- Quick!
- What are you doing?

934
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,911
My mom bought me this coat!

935
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,914
If we ever get in a food fight,
I want you on my side.

936
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,916
Come on!
We've gotta stopJeronahew!

937
01:20:58,153 --> 01:21:03,056
Four, three, two, one.
You're on!

938
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:05,058
Good evening.

939
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:09,426
I know you'll enjoy tonight's program
on how to become...

940
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,431
the perfect you.

941
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,694
Hurry! Quick! This way!

942
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:17,203
I think it's time for a few film clips.
You'll find them-

943
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:19,205
Detective Lance Boyle,
the city police!

944
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:21,707
Ladies and gentlemen,
this man is a fraud!

945
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:24,711
You're now watching a promo
for next week's show on police brutality.

946
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:27,680
Don't listen to him!
He's trying to brainwash all of you!

947
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:33,152
Pay no attention! Her boyfriend dunks
doughnuts while crime abounds in the community!

948
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:35,849
Listen, people out there
in television land.

949
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,857
This man
hates human nature.

950
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:40,052
He's bent on
total world domination...

951
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:44,996
and he's using subliminal TV
mind control that-

952
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,194
That's right.
That's right!

953
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:53,206
Subliminal TV mind control!

954
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:57,836
Nothing will prevent me from reprogramming
the entire human race!

955
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:01,939
Oh, yeah? Well, I, as a member of
the human race, and damned proud of it...

956
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:04,780
challenge you, self-appointed
supreme being...

957
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:07,855
to a duel-
mano a mano.

958
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:10,891
That's right-
paint guns at 10 paces.

959
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:13,460
The person
with the least splotches wins.

960
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:15,961
Choose your weapon,
madman!

961
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:17,964
When I finish with you...

962
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:20,967
you'll look like you were on the wrong end
of a Wagner power painter.

963
01:22:21,069 --> 01:22:23,401
We'll see, won't we?

964
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:25,632
Ready.

965
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,401
Set-

966
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:32,242
I didn't say "go" yet.

967
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:35,248
Bad guys don't wait for "go. "

968
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,252
Igor!

969
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:44,257
I think it's time
we popped this Boyle.

970
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,327
Don't-

971
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,931
- Oww!
- Yee-hah!

972
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:55,866
F. T!

973
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:05,477
The guy's got a glass jaw.

974
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:08,014
Not exactly.

975
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:10,175
Oh! It's-

976
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:12,185
It's fertilizer.

977
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:15,745
Oh, no!
I'm smelling!

978
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:17,984
I'm smelling!

979
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:21,256
Yum yum!

980
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:23,490
Leon? No. No.

981
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:26,396
Melman,
we've known each other-

982
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:29,231
I- I'm your friend.

983
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:33,637
We can be reasonable,
talk this over, you know.

984
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,745
Ohh! Not there!

985
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,146
Oh, no. Oh, no!
I created you!

986
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,310
- No!
- Yeah! Ha-ha!

987
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,718
Oh, what a world!

988
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:52,191
Oh, what a world!

989
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:55,194
You get the feeling you've seen this
somewhere before?

990
01:23:57,298 --> 01:24:00,699
- You're a mess!
- I'm a mess? You should see yourself.

991
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:04,898
- Ooh. Pretty bad, huh?
- Oh, it's awful.

992
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,906
Too awful to kiss?

993
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:08,908
Mmm.

994
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,911
I suppose I could give it a try.

995
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:14,573
What are you-

996
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:37,470
Hello, everybody, and welcome
to the MFL Post-Film Show.

997
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:40,473
I'm CharlieJones live
in the winners' locker room.

998
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:43,669
My broadcast partner down the hall
in the losers' locker room.

999
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:46,941
We'll be going down the hall
in just a moment to visit that scene.

1000
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,949
But here is Steve Peace,
the executive producer.

1001
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:52,952
- Do you have a moment to visit with us?
- Absolutely.

1002
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:56,455
- What are your thoughts?
- Well, we're pleased to have it in the can.

1003
01:24:56,558 --> 01:25:00,289
It was a little scary there for a while,
but in the end came through.

1004
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:03,728
We were only 43 weeks over schedule,
but that's the business.

1005
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:06,733
And in the end it's all these folks,
these people, this crew.

1006
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:08,735
It's to their credit.

1007
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:11,362
In fact, there go
the credits right now.

1008
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:13,373
Oh. Yes.

1009
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,672
Let's get the director-John DeBello!
The director, John-

1010
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:20,305
Can we get you here, John, to just-
There's something- All right.

1011
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:23,316
- There's something I'm really dying to ask you.
- We're number one!

1012
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:25,318
Yes, but let me
tell you something.

1013
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:29,254
In all of the months of shooting,
the long hours and all of the overtime...

1014
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:32,155
how many times
did you yell "Cut"?

1015
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,387
Okay, okay, that's fine. That's fine.

1016
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:40,400
- This has to be a thrilling moment for you.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1017
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:43,596
You know, anytime
you make a movie, it's somethin'.

1018
01:25:43,705 --> 01:25:47,334
The cast was great.
The crew was great.

1019
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:49,342
- I mean, the movie's-
- Great?

1020
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:51,344
- Over.
- Over. Yes.

1021
01:25:51,446 --> 01:25:53,346
- Okay, well, thank you.
- Number one!

1022
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,348
Rick? Where's Rick?

1023
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:59,352
Rick, can we- can we break
in there just for a moment?

1024
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:02,218
Rick, you have to be
very proud.

1025
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:04,223
Uh-Thanks!

1026
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,624
And thank you, Charlie.
I'm just glad to be here.

1027
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:10,027
Let's go to
the videotape- the monitor here.

1028
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:13,032
We have a scene
that was cut from the film.

1029
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,034
Take us
inside the action here.

1030
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:17,570
Okay, um, that's Kennedi.

1031
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:19,572
Ah!
I remember this scene.

1032
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,074
Uh, I really had a lot of fun
making this scene.

1033
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:24,577
I'm sorry they cut it
from the film.

1034
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,840
- Had to be a thrill.
- It was a real thrill.

1035
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:28,848
Where's Kennedi?
Kennedi!

1036
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:31,851
- Kennedi, can you-
- I'm gonna go do an interview over here.

1037
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:33,853
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1038
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:36,856
- You have to be thrilled.
- Oh, really, I am, I am.

1039
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:40,359
And what are your thoughts about
the scene we just saw on the monitor?

1040
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:44,363
Well, Charlie, I worked out for two years
to prepare for this role...

1041
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:47,366
and I was surprised, frankly,
when they cut that scene.

1042
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:51,097
But I hope to get to do a movie real
soon where I take all my clothes off.

1043
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,607
Well, we're all wishing you the very best
and we hope that that happens very soon...

1044
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:56,609
for all of us.

1045
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:59,703
Now let's go down the hall to the losers'
locker room. Here's my broadcast colleague.

1046
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:03,272
Charlie, I'm here with
Dr. Mortimer Gangreen, a. k. a. Jeronahew.

1047
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:05,284
Jeronahew, tough loss today.

1048
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:08,287
Yeah, we had 'em, Chuck,
but we gave it away at the end.

1049
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,289
Gotta give 'em credit, though.

1050
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:13,292
They got us out of our game plan.
We made some mistakes.

1051
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:16,295
- But I'll be back. You can count on it.
- I'm sure you will be.

1052
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,297
Charlie, back to you.

1053
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,300
We're back here
in the winners' locker room.

1054
01:27:21,402 --> 01:27:24,303
You know, these credits
are hard to read backwards.

1055
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:27,306
- I'm sorry, Charlie. Here.
- Oh, thanks, Rick.

1056
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,308
- Yea!
- Good night!

1057
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,378
That's it from here!

1058
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:38,252
Am I too late?
