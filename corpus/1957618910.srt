- Go, go!

00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:22,068
- [Firefighter] I need
 a ladder over here!

6
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:24,586

 somebody give me some help!

[siren blares]

11
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,551

I found her!

- Yeah.

17
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,931
- [Firefighter]
 Ladder on this side.

18
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:56,551
- This is what you don't
learn in the classroom.

19
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,551
- I know, how's the baby, Al?

20
00:02:59,724 --> 00:03:01,413
- I don't think she'll make it.

21
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,344
- Damn!

22
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:03,275
- Hey, calm down, look, you did

23
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:04,724
everything you're supposed to.

24
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,586
- We got our asses
 kicked in there!

25
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,517
- Look, this house
 was a deathtrap before
 we even got here!

26
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:11,344
If we would've gotten the
 call even a second sooner

27
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:12,620
this whole thing
wouldn't have happened.

28
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,793
- That's bullshit!

29
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,551
Look, we got the equipment!

30
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:17,241
Where's their lifeline?

31
00:03:17,241 --> 00:03:18,172
- Sit down!

32
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:19,689
- If we can't save 'em, who can?

33
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:24,275
- Look, you're right, but gee,

34
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:26,172
sometimes things
 like this happen.

36
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,206

[suspenseful music]

38
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,758
- Alex, you need a hand?

39
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:39,620
Yoo-hoo, Alex?

40
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,896
I said, do you need a hand?

41
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:42,862
- No, I got it.

42
00:04:44,448 --> 00:04:45,586
- Hey, you better
 treat your equipment

43
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:46,620
a little better than that.

44
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,275
You're gonna piss Wayne off.

45
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:50,241
- Oh, yeah, well, he'll live.

46
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:53,586
- Yeah. [chuckles]

47
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:54,724
But you might not.

49
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,310
Say, you going tonight?

50
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,000
- Where?

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,034
- Double-Vision.

[Alex chuckles]

53
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:12,586
- Last time I went there
I got my ass chewed out.

54
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:15,137
- [chuckles] Like
 you hated that.

55
00:05:15,137 --> 00:05:16,620
- [Alex] Carefully now.

56
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,068
- Hey, you were the one
 buying the shots, remember?

57
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,827
- Yeah, you got me there.

58
00:05:20,827 --> 00:05:23,551
- Well, besides,
 it's therapeutic.

59
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:25,827
- Therapeutic?

60
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,000
- Yeah, therapeutic.

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,448
The whole gang will be there.

62
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:32,000
- Well, Helen does
 have to work late

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,275
at the store tonight.

64
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:35,862
She had a problem with hamsters.

65
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:37,275
Nevermind.

66
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:39,862
I can probably use a
few after this morning.

67
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:40,689
- Good.

68
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:43,172

70
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,862
- Ugh, my gut is gonna explode.

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,827
- So what's this I
 hear about hamsters?

72
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,310
- Hamsters?

73
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,931
You and Helen splitting and
 can't find anyone better?

74
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,103
- Have another, alright?

75
00:06:06,103 --> 00:06:07,310
- Okay.

76
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,448
Hey, how about
 another round here

77
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:09,931
for my fine, feathered
 friends, huh?

78
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:12,965
- Alright, what
 about the hamsters?

79
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:16,931
- Alright, you
 really wanna know?

80
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:18,689
It's not such a big deal.

81
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:21,655
The other day at the pet
 store, Helen got in a shipment

82
00:06:21,655 --> 00:06:24,034
of the little furry
 creatures, right,

83
00:06:24,034 --> 00:06:25,482
just a few hours after they were

84
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:29,379
in a cage together
 they ate one another.

85
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:31,206
[firefighter groans]

86
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:32,793
- Cannibals?

87
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,034
- I think they're
 called gerbils.

88
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:36,379
- Shut the hell up!

89
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:42,034
- Anyways, you know, she
 hasn't had anything like this

90
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,655
happen before and it
 kinda freaked her out.

91
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,551
- Didn't they feed 'em
 before they delivered 'em?

92
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,241
- They don't ship hamsters
 in the first class section.

93
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:53,448
- No shit, they could still
 give 'em some hamster food.

94
00:06:53,448 --> 00:06:56,655
- Hey, maybe hamsters
 are gerbil food.

95
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:57,482
- Ahhh!

96
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:58,620
- Yeah?

97
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,206
- Yeah, you guys are brilliant.

98
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,862
- Hey, what's the difference
between a hamster and a gerbil?

99
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,172
- Ah.

100
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,827
You see, it's right
 in the curva--

101
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:10,517
- Alright, enough!

102
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:11,689
Help, please.

103
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:13,068
- You work with him, I don't.

104
00:07:13,068 --> 00:07:14,689
- Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

105
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:18,517
- Thanks.

106
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:20,172
- You trying to get me divorced?

107
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,827
- Actually, we heard
 about this morning.

108
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:24,241
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

109
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:26,517
- Not as sorry as I am.

110
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,517
- I guess you just got
 the call too late, right?

111
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:39,172
I want you guys to know that
these drinks are on us tonight.

112
00:07:39,172 --> 00:07:40,413
- Well.

113
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,724
- You really don't
 have to do that.

114
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:43,965
- Just shut up and drink.

115
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:48,551
- Mmm.

116
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:51,655
What time is it?

117
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,172
- [Firefighter] Quarter to 10.

118
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,931
- Oh, man, I gotta get outta
 here before Helen gets home.

119
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,310
- Just tell Helen
 it was your turn

120
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,931
to get the groceries
 for the guys.

121
00:07:57,931 --> 00:07:59,000
- Yeah, she's not gonna
buy that I'll tell ya.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,310
- Hey, turn it up.

123
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,620
- Police are on the
 scene collecting evidence

124
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,620
at what appears to be
 still another killing

125
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,931
by this wild man
 who's been on a spree

126
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:12,551
for the last several weeks.

127
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:15,172
What has been found
here is a severed finger

128
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:16,931
in the front seat of this car.

129
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:19,275
Police won't say if the
 finger belongs to the owner

130
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:21,965
of this vehicle, but
 no matter who's it is,

131
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:25,758
the fact remains another
person has disappeared.

They have cleared the area,
 they are talking to witnesses.

 as they become available.

This is Dick Jansen, WLDO News.

136
00:08:36,586 --> 00:08:38,241
- Looks like the car
Pete bought his daughter

137
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:39,551
a couple months back.

138
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:40,586
- Oh my God.
 - Shit.

139
00:08:41,482 --> 00:08:42,379
- Where's Pete at?

140
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,413
- He's at the station.

141
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,137
- [Reporter] ...belongs to
 the owner of this vehicle,

142

but no matter's who's
 it is the fact remains

143
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,620

[Wayne sighs]

149
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,034
- What's going on?

150
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:05,241
- Get up, Pete, we need to talk.

151
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:06,172
- Talk about what?

152
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,689
- It's about your daughter.

153
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:14,379
- What about my daughter?

154
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:18,931
[suspenseful music]

155
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:20,137
- Just come on.

[knocking]

158
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:38,862
- Hi, sweetie.

159
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:40,034
What are you working on?

160
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,413
You get everything worked out?

161
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,206
- What?

162
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:50,931
- You know, the gerbils.

163
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,137
[Helen sighs]

164
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:54,655
- Hamsters.

165
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:57,275
I swear, someday you're
 gonna learn the difference.

166
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:58,827
And yes, I did
 get it worked out.

167
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,379
They're gonna replace them all.

168
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:02,551
- Great.

169
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:03,793
You know, I'd hate
 to think that you

170
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:06,482
sold some poor little
 girl a devil gerbil!

171
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:08,689
- God, hamsters!

172
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:12,724
I swear, if you call them
 gerbils one more time.

173
00:12:14,827 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm gonna throw one
 in your underwear.

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,517
- Ooooh!

175
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:20,000
- Figures you'd like that.

176
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,241
- Well, it's all fun and games
 until somebody gets hurt.

177
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,482
- Yeah, and then
 it's just hilarious.

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,689
You son of a bitch!

179
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:32,275
You went out drinking again?

180
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,241
God, I give up!

181
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:36,931
- Helen, I just stopped

00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:44,827
- What are you doing?

357
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,137
- I'm digging it up.

358
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:51,068
- No, Wayne!

359
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,310
- What's the matter with you?

360
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,551
- [Alex] What's the
 matter with you?

361
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:54,517
Come on, let's just
 get outta here.

362
00:22:54,517 --> 00:22:55,344
- Alex, you know what this is?

363
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:56,551
- Yeah, it's a grave.

364
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:57,793
- And what do people
 put in graves?

365
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,655
- [Alex] Listen, I'm
not digging up a grave.

366
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:02,137
- You realize how many people
 are missing from this town?

367
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:03,655
You want more to disappear?

368
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:06,137
- Jesus Christ, Wayne, it's
 probably someone's house pet.

369
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:08,310
A horse' or a cat or a gerbil.

370
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,896
- What if it's not?

371
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:12,344
What if there's some
 clue or evidence

372
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:14,172
under here for the cops?

373
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:16,448
Maybe the remains of
somebody who is missing.

374
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:18,413
We could put some family at
 ease knowing their loved one's

375
00:23:18,413 --> 00:23:20,068
not out being
 tortured somewhere.

376
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:21,896
- Come on, we can call someone.

377
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:23,862
- You know what I
 had to do last night?

378
00:23:25,482 --> 00:23:27,172
I had to wake up
 Pete and tell him his

379
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,517
daughter was missing.

380
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:29,344
Yeah, me.

381
00:23:31,344 --> 00:23:33,344
If you coulda seen
 the look on his face.

382
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:36,896
If you're going, get outta
 here, I'll dig this up myself.

383

[shovel striking]

384
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,068
- God, I can't believe
 I'm doing this.

385
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:47,000
- Just dig.

- Are these human?

390
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,517
This sure as hell
 doesn't look human.

391
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:39,000
- I don't know.

392
00:24:48,482 --> 00:24:50,758
- Doesn't smell too good
either, whatever it is.

393
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:51,827
- No, no, it doesn't.

394
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:55,172
Let's do the back.

395
00:24:57,965 --> 00:24:59,000
- Here, let me do it.

396
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:27,931
[dramatic music]

397
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,137
- Alex.

398
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,827
Alex.

399
00:25:46,793 --> 00:25:48,241
Alex!

400
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:49,068
- What?

401
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:52,896
- You hear that?

402
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,000
- Hear what?

403
00:25:58,206 --> 00:25:59,103
- That's my point.

404
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:01,827
There's nothing to hear.

[creature growls]

406
00:26:08,172 --> 00:26:09,379

- Wayne, where's the truck at?

412
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,000
- Just keep running!

418
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,310
- Alex, is here.

419
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,965
- Oh, how long has he been here?

420
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:19,310
- I don't know, maybe
 an hour and a half.

421
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,137
He's drunk.

422
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:23,103
- Must have been a bad day.

423
00:27:23,103 --> 00:27:25,310
- He didn't even wave to me.

424
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,655
- I'm going to talk to him.

425
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:34,275
Hi, Alex.

426
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:35,206
Hi, Wayne.

427
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,448
- We can't...

428
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:01,965
We can't tell
 anybody about this.

429
00:28:05,448 --> 00:28:07,482
And nobody would believe this.

430
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:14,689
- My lips are sealed.

431
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:19,896
I'm too drunk to even want
 to talk about this right now.

432
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:23,896
- I don't want people
 to think I'm crazy.

433
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:26,724
- Give me your keys.

You drunk fucker!

437
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,896
Barf it up, Alex!

Goddammit!

439
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,896
Adios, Alex.

Mrs. Subner.

00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:01,310
Yeah, is Helen there?

445
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,931
Yeah, can I speak to her please?

You don't, you don't
 understand, um.

- Thanks.

460
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:26,000
- Well, what'd you find?

461
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:30,482
- Don't just shrug your
shoulders, do you have anything?

462
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:33,448
- Yeah, I'll tell you what we
 got, shit is what we've got.

463
00:31:33,448 --> 00:31:38,241
No, wait, we got blood
 and we got some ribs.

464
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,896
All we need now is some
 corn and we got a barbecue.

465
00:31:40,896 --> 00:31:42,379
- Go out there and
 find something.

466
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:44,103
I don't care if it's with
 tweezers or a vacuum.

467
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,896
- You know, we're not just
 looking for shoe tracks here.

468
00:31:48,068 --> 00:31:49,344
- Do you know whose it is?

469
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:52,000
- [Connor] Not yet.

470
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,827

 gotta do an autopsy.

 not smoking in here.

473
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,827
It pisses my wife off.

474
00:32:09,103 --> 00:32:10,931
- Where is your
 wife, Mr. Kerwood?

475
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:15,724
- She's staying at her mother's
house for a couple days.

476
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:17,068
- We're trying to
 get this resolved

 Mr. Kerwood.

- Uh, tea.

00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:42,517

trick a couple days ago

487
00:32:42,517 --> 00:32:44,448
so be easy on me.

488
00:32:44,448 --> 00:32:45,689

 your card, you got it?

00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:49,931

00:32:58,517 --> 00:33:01,103
- Well, I'm tired, I
 have a damn headache.

494
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:02,793
- [Firefighter] Want some pills?

495
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:04,241
- Yeah, sure.

496
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:06,172
- Don't think I'm
prying, but how's Helen?

497
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:08,517
- [Alex] Oh, she's
 fine, I'm the dumbass.

498
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:10,413
- Ah, she's just pissed
off because you've

499
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:12,689
been hanging out at the
 bar again, huh? [chuckles]

500
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:13,517
- Yup.

501
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:16,137
- Well, she'll get over it.

502
00:33:16,137 --> 00:33:17,000
- I know.

503
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:22,379
- This headache wouldn't
have any correlation

504
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:24,000
with Wayne's day off, would it?

505
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,724
- Actually, it would.

506
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:28,586
We stopped at the watering
 hole as Helen likes to call it

507
00:33:29,689 --> 00:33:31,620
after we went hunting
 the other day.

508
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,034

from what I understand,

509
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:35,034
you two drank the place dry.

 we were thirsty.

512
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:40,620
Wayne catch a cab?

513
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,034
- No, I stopped by later
and gave him a ride.

514
00:33:43,034 --> 00:33:44,620
Good thing you had his truck.

515
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,206
He couldn't even stand up.

516
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:48,620
- You cheating bitch!

00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:51,827
- Ze dinner is served!

518
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:54,241

519
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,724
Hey, good cooking.

520
00:33:56,724 --> 00:33:58,586
- [Firefighter] Thanks.

521
00:33:58,586 --> 00:34:01,896
- So, Alex, what happened today?

522
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:04,379
[Alex coughs]

523
00:34:05,724 --> 00:34:06,724
- [Al] That was subtle.

524
00:34:06,724 --> 00:34:07,965
- No, it's alright.

525
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,965
I knew you guys wanted
 to ask me about it.

526
00:34:11,103 --> 00:34:15,620
They found a human
body part at my garage.

527
00:34:17,206 --> 00:34:19,000
- [Al] Are you serious?

528
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,103
- Yeah, they don't know who
 it is or how it got there.

529
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:24,482
- Holy shit!

530
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:25,413
[dispatched muttering
 on the radio]

531
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:27,137
- How's Helen, does she know?

532
00:34:27,137 --> 00:34:28,206
- She's staying at her mother's.

533
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:29,275
She doesn't even know about it.

534
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,620
She won't even talk to me.

535
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,965
- [Al] Damn.

536
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:34,724
Hey, is it safe at your place?

537
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:37,068
- Yeah, they're
 patrolling heavily and

538
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:39,310
searching around the
woods and everything so.

539
00:34:41,655 --> 00:34:44,620
Hey, listen, I'm gonna
 go home, alright?

540
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:47,896
- Alex, if there's
 anything you want

541
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:50,413
or need you just call us.

542
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:51,206
- I will.

543
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:52,931
Thanks.

544
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:02,827
[dramatic music]

545
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:33,793
[low growling]

546
00:35:33,793 --> 00:35:38,793
[creature growling]
 [suspenseful music]

547
00:35:39,862 --> 00:35:42,620
[boxes crashing]

548
00:35:47,517 --> 00:35:48,448
[creature growling]
 [boxes breaking]

549
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:51,689
[man screams]

550
00:35:51,689 --> 00:35:53,137
- Well, where we at?

551
00:35:54,551 --> 00:35:56,758
- Well, we had 'em search
 through the neighboring woods,

552
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:58,448
but they didn't find anything.

553
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,827
All the way back to Bell's line.

554
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,206
I'll tell you what,
 this guy is good.

555
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:05,517
There's not a damn
 thing to work on.

556
00:36:05,517 --> 00:36:07,862
- Yeah, tell me about it.

557
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:09,344
You know, it's hard to
 believe that some guy

558
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,620
just waltzes in, drops a
 limb, and there's no clue.

559
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,758
I mean, what is that?

560
00:36:12,758 --> 00:36:16,206
- We dusted, sprayed,
 dipped, fumed.

561
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:18,103
- [Larry] Shit, what else?

562
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:20,965
- We did get the canine unit.

563
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:22,137
It'll be here soon.

564
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:24,000
If there's anything,
the dogs should get it.

565
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,793
- Yeah, if they don't,
 I'll shoot them in the ass.

566
00:36:25,793 --> 00:36:28,034
[chuckles]

567
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:30,793
- We need to talk.
 [phone rings]

568
00:36:30,793 --> 00:36:32,103
- What is it?

569
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:33,517
- Not here, in the lab.

570
00:36:35,172 --> 00:36:36,172
- Okay, I'll follow.

571
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,137
- I thought it best to bring
 this up to you personally.

572
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:48,655
And privately.

573
00:36:49,862 --> 00:36:52,172
I know I'm a rookie
 and I could be wrong

574
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:54,724
or simply overlooked
 some trivial detail,

575
00:36:54,724 --> 00:36:57,965
but there's something
 definitely not right here.

576
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,586
- Listen, at this point
 I'll take anything you got.

577
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,413
Let's see.

578
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:06,931
This it?

579
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:07,758
- Yup.

580
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:09,551
- Oh!

581
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:12,896
[Larry coughs]

582
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:14,551
Ain't much to look at, is it?

583
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:17,206
- My report won't be a
 long one, that's for sure.

584
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:19,517
- Oh, that's good,
 that outta help.

585
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:21,689
- Listen, you don't
have to worry about me.

586
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:23,000
Speed and carelessness will not

587
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,482
have an effect on my protocol.

588
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:26,413
I'm doing my best to help
 find a solution for you.

589
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:28,275
- Well, look I gotta
 job to do, okay?

590
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:29,482
I'm looking for some answers.

591
00:37:29,482 --> 00:37:31,068
I'd even go for some
 leads right now.

592
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:34,068
Concrete, papier mâché,
I could give a shit.

593
00:37:34,068 --> 00:37:35,724
It's been seven
 months, I've got 11

594
00:37:35,724 --> 00:37:39,068
missing persons and I
ain't got diddly, okay!

595
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:40,448
I'm stretched to the limit.

596
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:45,068
We haven't gotten any answers
 since this thing started

597
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:49,275
so if you've got
something, I'm all ears.

598
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:50,689
- I'm sorry.

599
00:37:50,689 --> 00:37:51,931
I'm just a bit stressed out.

600
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:54,793
I don't want anyone
 else disappearing.

601
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:56,931
Just as I wouldn't
 want my daughter to,

602
00:37:56,931 --> 00:37:59,517
but I know you guys don't have
 any direction at this time.

603
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:01,793
- Oh, is that your
 professional opinion, doc?

604
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:04,724
- I call it as I see it.

605
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:07,137
And now...

606
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm about to throw a big
wrench into the engine.

607
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:14,000
- [Larry] What is that?

608
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,586
- To put it simply, this
 person was chewed to death.

609
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:21,068
- What's that supposed to mean?

610
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:22,862
- Oh, this for instance.

611
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,551
This was not broken,
 crushed, cut or sawed.

612
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:29,965
It's been basically
 gnawed apart.

613
00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:32,517
There are also
 punctures in the bone.

614
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:33,931
I've been trying to get a
 match from the groove marks,

615
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:35,000
but no luck.

616
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:38,206
- What do you think it is?

617
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:39,586
- I've been running
 these jaw patterns around

618
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:40,931
with every known carnivore.

619
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:43,034
There is nothing
that matches up.

620
00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:45,000
Nothing.

621
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:47,310
- Shit.

622
00:38:49,137 --> 00:38:54,137
[dramatic music]
 [crickets chirping]

623
00:39:04,517 --> 00:39:07,586

624
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000

[creature growling]

628
00:40:07,689 --> 00:40:10,482
[Alex coughs]

629
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:13,137
[objects crash]

630
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:18,551
- Yes, I need to
 speak to Larry Gorham.

631
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:20,310
[Alex panting]

632
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,034
Yeah, tell him it's
 Alex Kerwood, alright?

633
00:40:23,034 --> 00:40:26,034
Just get him,
 alright, just get him!

634
00:40:31,758 --> 00:40:33,241
[camera clicking]

635
00:40:33,241 --> 00:40:34,172
- I'm gonna to make
 the report out,

636
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:36,241
but there's nothing much.

637
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:38,172
- [Connor] Have you got guys
 checking the front yard?

638
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:39,758
- [Larry] Yeah,
 they just started.

639
00:40:39,758 --> 00:40:44,172
- [Connor] How about the
 neighbors, you talk to them?

640
00:40:44,172 --> 00:40:46,827
- Someone want to tell me
 what the hell's going on here?

641
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:47,793
- We're working on it.

642
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,034
- Yeah, like hell you are!

643
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:50,551
This is the second
 time in as many days

644
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:52,965
that somebody's body part's
just popped up around my house!

645
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:54,448
Who wants to tell me
 what the hell's going on?

646
00:40:54,448 --> 00:40:55,275
- Take it easy, Mr. Kerwood.

647
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:56,551
- Oh, bullshit!

648
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:57,758
Are they showing
 up anywhere else?

649
00:40:57,758 --> 00:40:59,241
- Like I said, we are working--

650
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:00,586
- Are they showing
 up anywhere else?

651
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:02,517
- No, just here.

652
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:04,448
He might as well know.

653
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:06,586
And another thing.

654
00:41:06,586 --> 00:41:07,827
- What?

655
00:41:07,827 --> 00:41:09,931
- We advise you
 not to stay here.

656
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:11,172
- I'm not leaving my house.

657
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:13,241
- You can stay with my
wife and I for a while.

658
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:14,724
Just until this thing's over.

659
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:18,862
- Only a couple days.

660
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:20,000
- That's fine, sure.

661
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:23,793
- I gotta call Helen.

662
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:25,206
- Look I'll have my wife go by

663
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:26,724
and see her at the
 pet store, okay?

664
00:41:26,724 --> 00:41:28,758
Why don't you go on in the
 house and grab your clothes.

665
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:32,724
[Connor sighs]

666
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,896
- Let's get outta
 here, it stinks.

667
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:42,793
[animals squeaking]

668
00:41:46,448 --> 00:41:48,620
- Here's 18, 19, and 20.

669
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:55,310
- Thanks.

670
00:41:57,172 --> 00:41:58,482
- Can I help you?

671
00:41:58,482 --> 00:41:59,758
- Yes, I'm looking
 for Helen Kerwood.

672
00:41:59,758 --> 00:42:01,275
I believe she's
 the manager here.

673
00:42:01,275 --> 00:42:03,000
- Yes, she is, wait a second,
 I'll go find her for you.

674
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,827
- Thank you.

675
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,620
- They don't smell too good,
 but wait till you taste one.

676
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,724
They're yummy. [laughs]

677
00:42:29,724 --> 00:42:31,000
- Are you Helen?

678
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,862
- Can I help you?

679
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:35,275
- I was wondering if we
could talk privately.

680
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:36,724
- Sure, this way.

681
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,689
- I'm Elizabeth Gorham and--

682
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:49,655
- Don't tell me,
 you bought a hamster

683
00:42:49,655 --> 00:42:50,517
from us the other day.

684
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:51,310
- No.

685
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:54,827
- God, I'm so
embarrassed, I'm sorry.

686
00:42:54,827 --> 00:42:57,137
It's just that we got this
 shipment of hamsters in

687
00:42:57,137 --> 00:42:58,827
They turned out to
 be mean hamsters

688
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:00,931
and I kinda sold
a couple of 'em.

689
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,000
- I'm here about your husband.

690
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,758
- Don't tell me I
 have to bail him out.

691
00:43:05,758 --> 00:43:07,172
- No, nothing like that.

692
00:43:08,517 --> 00:43:09,724
- You two having an affair?

693
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:11,103
- Oh, heaven's no!

694
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:12,413
No.

695
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:14,000
- Okay, I give up, what is it?

696
00:43:15,034 --> 00:43:16,793
- Actually, my
 husband's a detective.

697
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:18,689
- Oh, God, I knew it.

698
00:43:18,689 --> 00:43:20,551
- Mrs. Kerwood,
 please listen to me.

699
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:22,137
This is quite involved.

700
00:43:22,137 --> 00:43:23,241
- Well, let's have it.

701
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:26,310
- For the last few
 days there's been

702
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:28,620
even more body parts
showing up around town.

703
00:43:29,724 --> 00:43:30,965
- I didn't hear
 about it on the news.

704
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:33,000
- They're trying to
 keep a lid on it.

705
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,724
They don't want everybody to
 start freaking out over this.

706
00:43:35,724 --> 00:43:37,862
- It's not like they aren't
 already with the murders.

707
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:41,310
- I know it, but, oh,
 this would be much worse.

708
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,965
- So what does this have
to do with my husband?

709
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,655
- The body parts have been
 showing up at your house.

710
00:43:48,655 --> 00:43:49,655
- What?

711
00:43:49,655 --> 00:43:50,689
- That's why you
can't stay there

712
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:52,344
until this whole thing is over.

713
00:43:53,827 --> 00:43:55,206
Alex found the remains.

714
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,103
- How is he?

715
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,655
- He's at our house.

716
00:43:59,655 --> 00:44:02,000
Why don't you come over
and see for yourself?

717
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,896
- [Larry] So, how
 do you like her?

718
00:44:03,896 --> 00:44:05,793
- [Alex] Well, the
place is just beautiful

719
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:07,793
especially without all the
 body parts lying around.

720
00:44:07,793 --> 00:44:08,931
- Oh, that's funny.

721
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:10,103
- Sorry.

722
00:44:10,103 --> 00:44:12,206
So how can you afford
 a place like this?

723
00:44:12,206 --> 00:44:14,586
- I can't, my wife
 thinks we can.

724
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:16,482
She wants to make a little
 bed and breakfast out of it.

725
00:44:16,482 --> 00:44:17,689
That's why all this scaffolding.

726
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:19,931
A lot more optimistic than I am.

727
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:21,413
Looks like you'd be more suited

728
00:44:21,413 --> 00:44:23,793
for like a murder mystery
 place or a haunted house

729
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:25,241
or something.
 - Yeah.

730
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:27,103
Yeah, well, it's got that
 Hitchcocky feel to it.

731
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:28,413
I mean, it's an old place.

732
00:44:28,413 --> 00:44:29,689
- Kinda creepy.

733
00:44:29,689 --> 00:44:31,551
- Yeah, yeah, it is to me too.

734
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:32,896
Listen, they're
 inside right now.

735
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:34,103
They've been talking
 for a little while

736
00:44:34,103 --> 00:44:36,344
and I wish you guys
 weren't fighting.

737
00:44:36,344 --> 00:44:37,896
You know, I guess there've
 been some problems.

738
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:39,758
You can't have these petty
 arguments, you understand?

739
00:44:39,758 --> 00:44:41,310
Listen, I've been
trying to talk with her.

740
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,103
She's the one who doesn't
 wanna talk with me.

741
00:44:43,103 --> 00:44:45,551
- Yeah, you have, I heard you
 came in the other night drunk.

742
00:44:45,551 --> 00:44:46,655
That's not acceptable.

743
00:44:47,827 --> 00:44:49,724
It's unacceptable,
 you listening to me?

744
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:51,758
- Yeah, you don't
 understand though, right?

745
00:44:51,758 --> 00:44:54,275
- I don't care, you
don't go to the bottle.

746
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,551
- Can you just spare
 me the lectures

747
00:44:55,551 --> 00:44:57,068
and can we please go in?

748
00:44:57,068 --> 00:44:58,206
- Yeah, you got
 your shit together?

749
00:44:58,206 --> 00:45:00,379
- Yes, I have my shit together.

750
00:45:00,379 --> 00:45:02,758
- Let's go, watch
 your step there.

751
00:45:02,758 --> 00:45:04,517
All this stuff is broken up.

752
00:45:04,517 --> 00:45:06,793
These guys leave a mess
every time they come.

753
00:45:07,896 --> 00:45:10,068
- This house is
 absolutely fantastic.

754
00:45:10,068 --> 00:45:11,310
- Thank you.

755
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,137
When Larry and I first
saw it, we fell in love,

756
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:16,758
and all the things
 came with it too.

757
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:17,862
We just thought
 we're gonna turn it

758
00:45:17,862 --> 00:45:19,448
into a bed and breakfast.

759
00:45:19,448 --> 00:45:20,965
- Oh, it's gonna be fantastic.

760
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:23,103
You know, I really like some
 of the furniture that you got

761
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:24,172
I'd really like to
 know where on earth

762
00:45:24,172 --> 00:45:25,655
you found some of this stuff.

763
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:26,482
- We just--

764
00:45:26,482 --> 00:45:27,310
- Hi, honey.

765
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:28,137
- Hi.

766
00:45:28,137 --> 00:45:29,000
- How ya doing?

767
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:31,931
[lips smack]

768
00:45:31,931 --> 00:45:33,724
- Larry, I'd like you
 to meet Helen Kerwood.

769
00:45:33,724 --> 00:45:35,517
- It's very nice to meet you.

770
00:45:35,517 --> 00:45:38,034
Elizabeth's told me
 quite a bit about you.

771
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:40,862
- Anything she could tell you
 about me is probably true.

772
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:44,310
Elizabeth, I'd like you
to meet a friend of mine

773
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:46,620
who just happens to
 be married to Helen.

774
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,000
What a coincidence, huh?

775
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,896
- You fool.

776
00:45:50,896 --> 00:45:52,172
It's definitely a pleasure.

777
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:53,793
Helen's told me a lot about you.

778
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:56,413
- Nice to meet ya.

779
00:45:56,413 --> 00:45:58,517
- Listen, we're gonna cook
 some grub up in the kitchen.

780
00:45:58,517 --> 00:46:00,586
Why don't you guys
 just take it easy and

781
00:46:00,586 --> 00:46:02,344
we'll be back in a minute.

782
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:03,241
Go on, relax.

783
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:25,620
- This is a really
 incredible house.

784
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,448
- Yeah.

785
00:46:34,379 --> 00:46:35,827
- Elizabeth is really nice.

786
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:40,413
- Yeah, Larry's a
 great guy, you know.

787
00:46:40,413 --> 00:46:42,379
I think he's gonna
 be a good influence.

788
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:45,413
- On what?

789
00:46:45,413 --> 00:46:46,241
- On me.

790
00:46:51,137 --> 00:46:56,137
[Helen sighs]
[dramatic music]

791
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,068
- Boy, I'm confused
 by this thing, baby.

792
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:02,482
I think there's more
than one thing going on.

793
00:47:02,482 --> 00:47:03,896
I can't figure it out.

794
00:47:03,896 --> 00:47:05,689
- Do you want the filet mignon?

795
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:07,620
- But, of course.

796
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,965
- They're in the garage freezer.

797
00:47:08,965 --> 00:47:10,482
- Okay, yes, Ma'am,
 I'll get 'em.

798
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:12,827
- I'll get them, I want to
 grab a pint of ice cream.

799
00:47:12,827 --> 00:47:16,931
- Oh, for later on when the
 big bad wolf comes calling.

800
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:18,620
[laughing]

801
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,068
- For dessert.

802
00:47:20,068 --> 00:47:21,241
- That's what I'm talking about.

803
00:47:21,241 --> 00:47:22,655
- I need the keys.
 - Oh, yeah.

804
00:47:22,655 --> 00:47:24,206
There you go, I'll
 get this done.

805

You alright?

810
00:47:57,655 --> 00:48:00,517
- Ooh, yeah, we're fine.

811
00:48:00,517 --> 00:48:01,586
- Yeah, I see you are.

812
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,344
- Thanks.

813
00:48:04,344 --> 00:48:05,586
- For what?

814
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:06,896
- Oh, for having
 Helen and I here.

815
00:48:06,896 --> 00:48:08,931
- Oh, geez, it's nothing.

816
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:10,482
About time you two got together.

817
00:48:10,482 --> 00:48:11,862
[distant flapping]

818
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:13,172
Oh, God, I bet she needs help.

819
00:48:13,172 --> 00:48:14,620
I'm gonna go give her a hand.

820
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,896
- Do you want me to help?

821
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:16,965
- [Larry] No, no,
 stay right there.

822
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:17,827
- He'll be fine.

823
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,344
It's good to have you back.

Baby, you're gonna be alright.

Oh, shit!

Yes, I've got an emergency here!

845
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:29,827
It's my wife, she's dying!

846
00:49:29,827 --> 00:49:31,620
Can you send some, I don't know.

847
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:33,482
I don't know, just
trace the line, alright?

848
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:34,482
Just trace the line!

849
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:37,137
Oh, God.

850
00:49:37,137 --> 00:49:38,655
Come on, baby.

Come on, you alright?

852
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:41,965
You'll be fine.

 great Sunday for you.

of what appear to
 be human remains

that continue to be found in
 the southern area of the city.

 are following up on leads

 at this time.

871

Where the hell have you been?

 me pass, alright?

- How's Helen?

885
00:52:50,137 --> 00:52:52,034
- We heard on the
scanner, she's critical!

886
00:52:52,034 --> 00:52:53,000
- Fuck!

887
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,344
- Calm down, what is going on?

888
00:52:54,344 --> 00:52:55,310
Who did that to Helen?

889
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:57,137
- A big fucking devil dog!

890
00:52:57,137 --> 00:52:58,413
- What?
- I don't know!

891
00:52:58,413 --> 00:52:59,655
It had something to
 do with the woods and

892
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:01,551
that clearing and
 that grave we dug up!

893
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:02,586
- Christ!

894
00:53:02,586 --> 00:53:04,034
What it look like?

895
00:53:04,034 --> 00:53:05,931
- I don't know, it's like a
big dog or a wolf or something.

896
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:07,137
All I know is it keeps dropping

897
00:53:07,137 --> 00:53:09,275
off body parts and
 bringing 'em to me!

898
00:53:09,275 --> 00:53:11,931
- What do you mean, like
 a cat brings a mouse home?

899
00:53:11,931 --> 00:53:13,724
- You can't even
 compare it like that!

900
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:15,862
It attacked Helen at
 the detective's house

901
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:17,724
so I'm going to the training
 grounds to try to--.

902
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:19,000
- [Wayne] Let's go kill
the son of a bitch!

903
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,620
- That's what I'm trying
to do so just let me go!

904
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,206
- Get back, leave him alone!

905
00:53:24,206 --> 00:53:25,482
- Hey, go call the cops.

906
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:26,413
- Don't move!

907
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:28,000
- What is going on here, chief?

908
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,103
- Let him go!

909
00:53:29,103 --> 00:53:30,310
- No way.
 - Who's side are you

910
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,000
on, chief, huh?
 - He knows something

911
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:31,793
about this shit.

912
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:32,758
- Keep your mouth shut!

913
00:53:32,758 --> 00:53:34,482
- He's not going anywhere.

914
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:35,448
- Get out of here, Alex!

915
00:53:35,448 --> 00:53:38,034
[Chief groans]

916
00:53:40,172 --> 00:53:42,965
[dramatic music]

917
00:53:44,517 --> 00:53:47,448
[cameras clicking]

918
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:52,689
- Shit.

919
00:53:57,689 --> 00:53:59,344
- This is where
 Helen Kerwood was.

920
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:05,965
The medics said she had
a tourniquet on her arm.

921
00:54:05,965 --> 00:54:06,793
- What?

922
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,896
- Another thing, there's animal
tracks all over the place.

923
00:54:10,896 --> 00:54:12,655
- We followed 'em about
halfway up the yard.

924
00:54:12,655 --> 00:54:13,965
- What about the dogs?

925
00:54:15,344 --> 00:54:16,620
- That I don't get.

926
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,827
Every time we put 'em on
the scent of the prints

927
00:54:18,827 --> 00:54:20,551
they yelp and freaking run away

928
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:22,965
like they're scared
 or something.

929
00:54:22,965 --> 00:54:25,931
- Fuck, the press!

930
00:54:25,931 --> 00:54:27,620
- Get them assholes outta here.

931
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:31,482
I don't want any pictures,
 articles, or interviews.

932
00:54:31,482 --> 00:54:32,965
If this doesn't go away,

933
00:54:32,965 --> 00:54:35,103
I'm holding you responsible.
 - Okay, I got it, Chief.

934
00:54:35,103 --> 00:54:35,931
I got it.

935
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:41,034
- Nasty mess.

936
00:54:41,034 --> 00:54:42,448
- Yeah, the newspapers are gonna

937
00:54:42,448 --> 00:54:45,172
roast me over the hot
 coals for this one.

938
00:54:45,172 --> 00:54:46,793
- I was talking about
 Larry and his wife

939
00:54:46,793 --> 00:54:47,931
and that Kerwood woman.

940
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:51,206
- What have you found?

941
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:52,413
Tell me you got
 something that'll

942
00:54:52,413 --> 00:54:54,137
help me put this psycho away.

943
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:56,206
I want Kerwood's hide
 nailed to the wall!

944
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:57,517
- Kerwood?

945
00:54:57,517 --> 00:54:59,965
- Isn't it obvious
 what's happened here?

946
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:02,482
Larry went to bat
 for this creep.

947
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:04,655
Looks like he struck out.

948
00:55:04,655 --> 00:55:06,517
- No, Larry was trying
to save that guy's life

949
00:55:06,517 --> 00:55:07,724
from whatever killed
 these two people

950
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:10,000
and left body parts at his home!

951
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,068
From what I can tell, that
 thing caught up with him here.

952
00:55:12,068 --> 00:55:14,758
- Thing, what the hell
 you talking about?

953
00:55:14,758 --> 00:55:15,931
- Like I told Larry.

954
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:17,379
The killings weren't
 done by a man.

955
00:55:17,379 --> 00:55:19,862
They were done by an animal
 of incredible strength.

956
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:24,862
- God, you're telling me
 that we have some killer Cujo

957
00:55:26,413 --> 00:55:29,310
running around gnawing
 the neighborhood?

958
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,275
- Oh, yeah, I'll go right
 out and tell the press

959
00:55:31,275 --> 00:55:34,448
that our head pathologist
 says this was done

960
00:55:34,448 --> 00:55:38,448
by a killer house pet
 that's not satisfied

961
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:39,793
with table scraps anymore.

962
00:55:39,793 --> 00:55:41,344
- I'm not talking
 about some little pet!

963
00:55:41,344 --> 00:55:43,172
- Oh, I'm sorry, some thing.

964
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:45,620
Look, get back to
 your lab and find me

965
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,896
something that I can
 use against Kerwood.

966
00:55:47,896 --> 00:55:52,206
He's the bad guy here not
 some fantasy robo-beast

967
00:55:52,206 --> 00:55:53,724
with vice grip jaws.

968
00:55:53,724 --> 00:55:56,793
Geez, watch a little less
 late night television, please.

969
00:55:56,793 --> 00:56:00,758
- Like it or not some big
 animal killed these people.

970
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:02,000
And until you tell
 people what you're

971
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,482
looking for a lot
 more are gonna die.

972
00:56:03,482 --> 00:56:04,413
- [laughs] Oh, God.

973
00:56:04,413 --> 00:56:06,206
- Oh, laugh at me if you want.

974
00:56:06,206 --> 00:56:08,000
I cared for Larry.

975
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,206
I intend to see that
 whatever ripped him apart

976
00:56:10,206 --> 00:56:11,620
is caught and destroyed!

977
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:18,000
- Maybe you didn't hear
me the first, no press.

978
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,517
You can't go inside.

979
00:56:19,517 --> 00:56:20,758
I'm sorry.

980
00:56:20,758 --> 00:56:22,482
- Hey, hey, put an APB
 out on Alex Kerwood.

981
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:24,206
Consider him armed
 and dangerous.

982
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:25,758
- Asshole!

983
00:56:25,758 --> 00:56:27,172
- Does he have something to
 do with the serial murders?

984
00:56:27,172 --> 00:56:30,172
[suspenseful music]

985
00:56:55,827 --> 00:56:56,655
- Come on.

986
00:56:57,689 --> 00:56:58,793
I'm waiting for you.

987
00:57:02,862 --> 00:57:04,310
[knocking]

988
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:06,448
- Chief, the bureau is here.

989
00:57:11,551 --> 00:57:12,448
- Hello.
- Hello.

990
00:57:13,655 --> 00:57:15,965
- So, Chief, why
 weren't we notified

991
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:18,758
of these human remains sooner?

992
00:57:18,758 --> 00:57:20,206
- I've been busy.

993
00:57:20,206 --> 00:57:22,482
- We would appreciate
 cooperation, Mr. Pellman.

994
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:25,620
- Fine, but I've
still been busy.

995
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,000
- Look, why don't you guys
 go out and have a seat?

996
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,827
We'll take you out to the
 house in a few minutes.

997
00:57:29,827 --> 00:57:31,413
- We'll go now.

998
00:57:31,413 --> 00:57:33,551
- Have you contacted Alex yet?

999
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:35,034
- No.

1000
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:36,241
But there was a disturbance down

1001
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:38,103
at the fire station earlier.
 - Wait.

1002
00:57:38,103 --> 00:57:40,034
What kind of a disturbance?

1003
00:57:40,034 --> 00:57:41,344
- They all got in a brawl.

1004
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,068
Now I've got one
of them downstairs
wanting to talk to you.

1005
00:57:45,068 --> 00:57:46,275
He's got a bloody nose.

1006
00:57:46,275 --> 00:57:47,551
- Yeah, alright, come on.

1007

1016
01:00:08,655 --> 01:00:10,551
- Hey, Al, how you doing today?

1017
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:11,413
- Pretty good, Marcus.

1018
01:00:11,413 --> 01:00:12,655
How about yourself?

1019
01:00:12,655 --> 01:00:14,310
- Alright, what are
 you looking for today?

1020
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:17,068
- Baits, I'm gonna go
 on a big fishing trip.

1021
01:00:17,068 --> 01:00:19,965
- Well, I guess I won't give
 you the golden tour then.

1022
01:00:19,965 --> 01:00:21,000
- Much obliged.

1023
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:30,758
- What can I help
 you with today?

1024
01:00:31,931 --> 01:00:33,896
- Let me see this small knife.

1025
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:34,724
- Alright.

1026
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:48,586
- How about the big one?

1027
01:00:48,586 --> 01:00:49,379
- The black one?

1028
01:00:55,793 --> 01:00:59,758
Those are both 49.99 so with tax

1029
01:00:59,758 --> 01:01:03,724
it would be 52.99.

1030
01:01:05,689 --> 01:01:06,965
- I'll take the big one.

1031
01:01:06,965 --> 01:01:08,413
- Alright, put it
 in a box for you.

1032
01:01:16,448 --> 01:01:18,586
- Just a second, I need
to grab another bill.

1033
01:01:18,586 --> 01:01:19,413
- Alright.

[dramatic music]

1035
01:01:34,137 --> 01:01:36,379
Alright, I'll get
 some change for you.

1036
01:01:36,379 --> 01:01:37,206
Be right back.

1037
01:01:40,482 --> 01:01:42,068
- How you doing?

1038
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:42,931
- Fine.

1039
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:45,827
- What's in the bag?

1040
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,275
- None of your business!

1041
01:01:47,275 --> 01:01:49,172
- I think it is!

1043
01:01:50,344 --> 01:01:51,689
Give me the bag!

Stop right there!

1045
01:01:52,862 --> 01:01:54,275
Right now!

1048

- Marcus, he's the killer!

1049
01:01:59,793 --> 01:02:02,482
I just saw some fingers
fall out of his bag!

1050
01:02:02,482 --> 01:02:03,896
- [Marcus] Open the bag, Al!

1051
01:02:08,655 --> 01:02:10,482

Stay there!

- So where'd you put 'em?

1062
01:03:16,965 --> 01:03:18,034
- Wouldn't you like to know?

1063
01:03:18,034 --> 01:03:19,310
- As a matter of fact, I would!

1064
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:21,517
- There's really
 nothing left for you.

1065
01:03:21,517 --> 01:03:23,758
I make it a point to
make 'em unrecognizable.

1066
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,896
- Except one.
 - Who?

1067
01:03:25,896 --> 01:03:27,000
Who was it?

1068
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,758
Which pretty young thing?

1069
01:03:28,758 --> 01:03:30,482
Was she special?

1070
01:03:30,482 --> 01:03:31,724
Your daughter?

1071
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,413
- You're a sick puppy!
- You're all expendable.

1072
01:03:34,413 --> 01:03:37,172
- We're talking about the
 mess you just left for us,

1073
01:03:37,172 --> 01:03:39,827
a couple in their
 home, ring any bells?

1074
01:03:39,827 --> 01:03:42,482
- I don't know
 anything about that!

1075
01:03:42,482 --> 01:03:45,103
- Listen, you've been very
 forthcoming with us so far

1076
01:03:45,103 --> 01:03:48,241
so why don't you just tell us
 about the Gorhams and tell us

1077
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,862
about Alex Kerwood, all right?
 - No, who?

1078
01:03:49,862 --> 01:03:50,689
Who?

1079
01:03:51,827 --> 01:03:53,413
- Your accomplice, that's who!

1080
01:03:54,896 --> 01:03:57,103
Come on, who do you think
 we're talking about here!

1081
01:03:57,103 --> 01:03:59,413
I've got evidence here that
 we've found at his house that

1082
01:03:59,413 --> 01:04:01,000
puts him at the crime scene.
 - I, I.

1083
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:01,965
- Quit lying!

1084
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:03,517
- I don't know no Alex Kerwood!

1085
01:04:03,517 --> 01:04:04,586
Nobody helped me!

1086
01:04:04,586 --> 01:04:06,827
I did it, I did it all!

1087
01:04:06,827 --> 01:04:08,103
I picked 'em!

1088
01:04:08,103 --> 01:04:09,931
I killed 'em!

1089
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:12,413
- We know about Alex Kerwood!

1090
01:04:12,413 --> 01:04:16,103
- I did it, I picked
 'em, I killed 'em!

1091
01:04:19,862 --> 01:04:21,034
- Well, thank you very much.

1092
01:04:21,034 --> 01:04:23,000
Good, good, that's
 all we wanted to know.

1093
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,620
- Alex is at his house.

1094
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,448
- What?

1095
01:04:25,448 --> 01:04:26,689
- He just called us.

1096
01:04:26,689 --> 01:04:27,931
He wants us to go
 down there, sir.

1097
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:29,482
- [Murderer] Nobody
 helped me, piggy!

1098
01:04:29,482 --> 01:04:31,413
- Shut up, man, you're
 fucked, alright?

1099
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:32,310
You're fucked!

1100
01:04:33,206 --> 01:04:34,724
We're gonna go down there.

1101
01:04:34,724 --> 01:04:39,068
Why don't you stay here and
 watch this fucking thing here!

1102
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:40,068
- Let's go!

1103
01:04:45,724 --> 01:04:46,758
- Don't move.

1104
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,068
Don't even breathe.

1105
01:04:52,068 --> 01:04:54,172
- Can I have some Wheaties?

1106
01:04:55,965 --> 01:04:59,379
[birds chirping]

1107
01:04:59,379 --> 01:05:00,482
- And blew it up?

1108
01:05:01,586 --> 01:05:04,000
- Yeah, I blew it up.

1109
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
- So I send somebody over there,

1110
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,275
they're gonna find animal parts
all over the place, right?

1111
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:10,517
- What I just tell him?

1112
01:05:10,517 --> 01:05:12,000
I told you, I blew
 the whole place up!

1113
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,827
- You know, it seems
 a little funny to me.

1114
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:16,206
You leave Larry's
 place, leave your wife

1115
01:05:16,206 --> 01:05:18,655
laying there almost
dead in a pool of blood.

1116
01:05:18,655 --> 01:05:20,206
- Someone had to
stop that thing!

1117
01:05:20,206 --> 01:05:21,655
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Those people all died

1118
01:05:21,655 --> 01:05:24,000
because of that big fuckin' dog.

1119
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,241
- Yeah, right,
 killer Cujo, yeah.

1120
01:05:26,241 --> 01:05:27,586
- Hey, listen, I know
 you don't believe me

1121
01:05:27,586 --> 01:05:28,655
and you know what?

1122
01:05:28,655 --> 01:05:30,655
I personally don't give a shit.

1123
01:05:30,655 --> 01:05:32,275
- Listen, Kerwood, we're
gonna get to the bottom

1124
01:05:32,275 --> 01:05:33,689
of this one way or the other.

1125
01:05:33,689 --> 01:05:35,379
- Oh, yeah, and the
sooner the better for me

1126
01:05:35,379 --> 01:05:36,758
because the sooner you find out

1127
01:05:36,758 --> 01:05:38,862
that I didn't kill these people.

1128
01:05:38,862 --> 01:05:40,275
What does it look like?

1129
01:05:40,275 --> 01:05:42,310
You think I just went in there,
chewed off my wife's arm?

1130
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,000
Just tore these people apart?

1131
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:48,000
I mean, get real with
 this whole thing!

1132
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,724
I know it sounds a little
 farfetched, but it happened!

1133
01:05:54,724 --> 01:05:56,275
Well, you don't have anything
 to worry about, Chief,

1134
01:05:56,275 --> 01:05:58,413
because I took care of
 your problem for ya.

1135
01:06:01,206 --> 01:06:02,034
How's Helen?

1136
01:06:03,206 --> 01:06:05,724
- She's stable,
 not awake though.

1137
01:06:05,724 --> 01:06:07,448
- She started to
come around so I

1138
01:06:07,448 --> 01:06:09,620
had them give her
 something to sleep.

1139
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,931
We thought it'd be better if you

1140
01:06:10,931 --> 01:06:12,517
were there when she came to.

1141
01:06:12,517 --> 01:06:13,758
We thought it'd
 be easier on her.

1142
01:06:13,758 --> 01:06:15,827
- Let me get some
 coffee, alright?

1143
01:06:15,827 --> 01:06:16,655
- Yeah.

1144
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:26,206
- So what do you think
 of this clown's story?

1145
01:06:26,206 --> 01:06:27,275
- I'm gonna send
some guys out to

1146
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:28,862
check it out, but it stinks.

1147
01:06:28,862 --> 01:06:31,000
- I'll say so, killer dogs?
 [dog barking]

1148
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,275
He claims this creature attacks

1149
01:06:32,275 --> 01:06:33,758
these people and then he lures
 [dog whelping]

1150
01:06:33,758 --> 01:06:36,241
it out to the fireman's
training ground and blew it up?

1151
01:06:36,241 --> 01:06:37,620
- [Connor] That's what he says.

1152
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,551
- [FBI Agent] This
 guy's certifiable.

1153
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:40,379
I mean--
[glass breaking]

1154
01:06:40,379 --> 01:06:41,862
[horrific screaming]

1155
01:06:41,862 --> 01:06:43,724
[agent screaming]

1156
01:06:43,724 --> 01:06:46,172
- Move.
 - Get it outta here, man!

1157
01:06:46,172 --> 01:06:47,310
Shoot!

1158
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:48,241
[gun firing]
 [creature growling]

1159
01:06:48,241 --> 01:06:49,206
- [Connor] Son of a bitch!

1160
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:50,275
[agent groans]

1161
01:06:50,275 --> 01:06:51,586
Shit!
 [gun firing]

1162
01:06:51,586 --> 01:06:54,413
[creature growls]

1163
01:07:15,413 --> 01:07:18,241
[swords clanging]

1164
01:07:21,655 --> 01:07:24,482
[creature growls]

1165
01:07:34,103 --> 01:07:35,482
[knocking]

1166
01:07:35,482 --> 01:07:36,827
- Just a second.

1167
01:07:37,896 --> 01:07:39,448
[knocking]

1168
01:07:39,448 --> 01:07:40,379
I'm coming!

1169
01:07:44,413 --> 01:07:45,931
Jesus, what the hell?

1170
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:47,551
- It's still alive, Wayne.

1171
01:07:47,551 --> 01:07:48,827
- What?

1172
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:50,000
I thought you were
 gonna blow it up?

1173
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,517
- I did blow it up,
 but the thing...

1174
01:07:51,517 --> 01:07:53,137
I don't know, it's
 still alive though.

1175
01:07:53,137 --> 01:07:54,103
- Shit!

1176
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,551
- We've got another problem.

1177
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:57,206
- What?

1178
01:07:58,413 --> 01:08:00,172
- There's another monster.

1179
01:08:00,172 --> 01:08:01,827
I mean, it is huge this thing.

1180
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,344
It walks on two legs.

1181
01:08:03,344 --> 01:08:04,931
It must have been what
 chased us out of the woods.

1182
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:06,758
- You got to be
 fucking kidding me.

1183
01:08:06,758 --> 01:08:08,000
- [Alex] No it killed Connor.

1184
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,172
- Connor?

1185
01:08:09,172 --> 01:08:10,655
- And two FBI
 agents at my house!

1186
01:08:10,655 --> 01:08:11,551
I mean it broke
 through the window,

1187
01:08:11,551 --> 01:08:12,551
it just tore 'em all up!

1188
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:13,793
- How'd you get away?

1189
01:08:13,793 --> 01:08:15,000
- I don't know,
 it didn't kill me.

1190
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,103
It lifted me up
 in the air and it

1191
01:08:17,103 --> 01:08:20,000
showed me how these things
 were created in my mind.

1192
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
- What the hell are
 you talking about?

1193
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,551
- What I'm walking about, Wayne,

1194
01:08:23,551 --> 01:08:25,620
is that hundreds of years
 ago these creature things,

1195
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:28,172
these killing machines,
 they were created by sorcery

1196
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:29,551
and used in some sort of battle

1197
01:08:29,551 --> 01:08:31,103
between two roaring kingdoms.

1198
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:36,103
[dramatic music]
 [swords clanging]

1199
01:08:36,724 --> 01:08:38,862
[men grunting]

1200
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:43,068
[swords clanging]

1201
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:49,068
[man grunts]

1202
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:55,482
Anyway, the tall
creature killed that dog

1203
01:08:55,482 --> 01:08:56,896
and buried it out
 in those woods.

1204
01:08:56,896 --> 01:08:58,620
But then we dig up
 that grave, Wayne.

1205
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,655
Now that dog thinks
 that I'm it's master!

1206
01:09:00,655 --> 01:09:03,724
But the big tall creature thing
wants to kill the dog again!

1207
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:05,172
- Slow down, Alex.

1208
01:09:05,172 --> 01:09:07,931
- No, you're the one who
 took us out to those woods.

1209
01:09:07,931 --> 01:09:09,448
- Wait a minute!

1210
01:09:09,448 --> 01:09:10,689
- I told you I didn't wanna
 dig that thing up, but you--

1211
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:12,103
- You helped!
 - You said that--

1212
01:09:12,103 --> 01:09:13,310
- You helped.

1213
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:14,517
- Well, now you're
 gonna help me!

1214
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:15,827
- Help you how?

1215
01:09:15,827 --> 01:09:18,586
- Well, it showed
 me the empty grave

1216
01:09:18,586 --> 01:09:22,206
so now all we have to do is we
 lure the dog out to the woods

1217
01:09:22,206 --> 01:09:24,620
and then we lure it
 back to the gravesite.

1218
01:09:25,931 --> 01:09:27,517
- And that's your plan?

1219
01:09:27,517 --> 01:09:29,000
- Yeah.

1220
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,517
- We're gonna ambush a monster?

1221
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:36,517
- We have to destroy this
 thing, Wayne, and you helped.

1222
01:09:36,517 --> 01:09:38,000
We were out there together.

1223
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,724
It was you and me, and I
 said I didn't want to do it,

1224
01:09:39,724 --> 01:09:41,931
but you have to help
 me with this problem.

1225
01:09:42,965 --> 01:09:43,862
Come on, Wayne!
- Alright!

1226
01:09:43,862 --> 01:09:45,482
People are dead!
- Alright!

1227
01:09:46,379 --> 01:09:49,379
[suspenseful music]

1228
01:09:56,551 --> 01:09:57,931
[Wayne sighs]

1229
01:09:57,931 --> 01:09:59,827
We've been here for
 hours and nothing.

1230
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:02,000
Maybe you did kill it.

1231
01:10:03,172 --> 01:10:06,137
- I didn't kill it,
 I just pissed it off.

01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,379
Like I said, it will come here.

1233
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,034

1234
01:10:15,034 --> 01:10:16,379
I'm gonna make some coffee.

Alex, take the bike!

1239
01:10:35,517 --> 01:10:36,344
Take it to the woods!

[Alex groans]
 - Are you alright?

1260

- Where the hell
were you, Wayne?

1261
01:13:57,206 --> 01:13:59,620
- The cops showed up
 right after you left.

1262
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,689
They asked me a million
questions about you.

1263
01:14:01,689 --> 01:14:03,655
- Yeah, what'd you tell 'em?

1264
01:14:03,655 --> 01:14:05,068
- I didn't tell 'em anything.

1265
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
- I gotta splint this.

1266
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,655

- [Alex] Yeah.

1270
01:14:22,034 --> 01:14:23,413
- Well, that'd been great
 if the cops had seen this!

1271
01:14:23,413 --> 01:14:24,413
Put it on!

1272
01:14:24,413 --> 01:14:26,344
- [Alex] I don't
wanna put it on.

1273
01:14:26,344 --> 01:14:28,137
- Put it on, you'll
 freeze to death.

01:14:33,275 --> 01:14:34,517
How do you know

1275
01:14:35,827 --> 01:14:36,724
that it's dead?

1276
01:14:38,551 --> 01:14:40,827
- I told you before,
 I can feel the thing.

1277
01:14:40,827 --> 01:14:42,758
I've got a connection with it.

I don't feel it anymore.

1279

It's dead, Wayne!

1280
01:14:47,137 --> 01:14:49,275
- There you go with
 that feeling stuff!

1281
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:50,517
I don't understand
 how you can say

1282
01:14:50,517 --> 01:14:52,517
that you can feel
 when it's not alive?

1283
01:14:52,517 --> 01:14:55,103
- I'll just explain it to
 you later, Wayne, alright?

1284
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,551
Can we just go now?

1285
01:14:57,551 --> 01:14:59,965

 the hell outta these woods.

See Helen.

1289
01:15:05,758 --> 01:15:06,586
Stand up.

1290
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,275

1291
01:15:09,275 --> 01:15:10,103
- Come on.

1292
01:15:16,482 --> 01:15:18,103
- Yeah, we just injected
her so let's try

1293
01:15:18,103 --> 01:15:20,000
to hold off dinner for
 about two hours if we could.

1294
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,241
- [Alex] I wanna see my wife!

1295
01:15:21,241 --> 01:15:22,862
- Hey, what are
 you doin' in here?

1296

I beat 'em.

1300
01:15:52,724 --> 01:15:54,413
You gave me the
 strength to do it.

1301
01:15:58,344 --> 01:16:01,620
I'm never gonna
 leave you, never.

1302
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,206
I'm gonna take a leave
 from the fire station

1303
01:16:08,517 --> 01:16:10,586
and I can come help
 you at the pet store.

1304
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,137
And you can show
 me the difference

1305
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:17,241
between the gerbils
 and hamsters.

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
