00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,309
BUT THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE."

184
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,341
LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED ONE.

185
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,389
I DON'T SMOKE.

186
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,728
CELIA?

187
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:22,778
CELIA.

188
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,407
"COME, MY CELIA, LET US PROVE,
WHILE WE CAN,

189
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:29,493
THE SPORTS OF LOVE.

190
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,412
TIME WILL NOT BE OURS FOREVER.

191
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:36,583
HE AT LENGTH OUR GOODS WILL SEVER.

192
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,210
SPEND NOT THEN HIS GIFTS IN VAIN.

193
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,963
SUNS THAT SET MAY RISE AGAIN;

194
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,465
BUT IF ONCE WE LOSE THIS LIGHT,

195
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:48,053
'TIS WITH US PERPETUAL NIGHT.

196
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,471
WHY SHOULD WE DEFER OUR JOYS?

197
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,517
FAME AND RUMOR ARE BUT TOYS.

198
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:55,143
CANNOT WE DELUDE THE EYES

199
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,104
OF A FEW POOR HOUSEHOLD SPIES,

200
00:23:57,312 --> 00:24:01,441
OR HIS EASIER EARS BEGUILE,

201
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,277
THUS REMOVED BY OUR WILE?

202
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,488
'TIS NO SIN LOVE'S FRUITS TO STEAL,

203
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,950
BUT SWEET THEFTS TO REVEAL,

204

00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,497
TO BE SEEN,

206
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:19,501
THESE HAVE CRIMES ACCOUNTED BEEN."

207
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:14,347
"IN PEACE, LOVE TUNES THE SHEPHERD'S REED,

215
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,372
MAY I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

216
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,915
THIS IS THE FIRST BOARDING CALL

217
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,960
FOR THE 3:00 BUS GOING TO LOS ANGELES.

218
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:14,705
PLEASE HAVE YOUR TICKET READY

219
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,172

AT GATE FOUR.

221
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:36,901
"NEVER SEEK TO TELL THY LOVE

222
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,948
LOVE THAT NEVER TOLD CAN BE.

223
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,954
FOR THE GENTLE WIND DOES MOVE

224
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,331
SILENTLY,

225
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,625
INVISIBLY.

226
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,754
I TOLD MY LOVE,

227
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,505
I TOLD MY LOVE,

228
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:00,508
I TOLD HER ALL MY HEART

229
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:04,304
TREMBLING COLD IN GHASTLY FEARS.

230
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:08,433
AH, SHE DID DEPART.

231
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:09,881
AS SOON AS SHE WAS GONE FROM ME

232
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,978
A TRAVELER CAME BY.

HE TOOK HER WITH A SIGH."

236
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,737
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN MOMMY.

237
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:57,041
HE'S NOT HOME.

238
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,489
MMM.

239
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:17,330
DID YOU SEE HER WITH DADDY TONIGHT?

240
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,666
NO? NO?

241
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:30,885
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

242
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,303
HE'S SO CUTE.

243
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:33,680
SHH...

244
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:42,974
"WHEN I HEARD

245
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,352
AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY

246
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,813
HOW MY NAME HAD BEEN RECEIVED

247
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,816
WITH PLAUDITS IN THE CAPITOL,

248
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:53,986
STILL IT WAS NOT A HAPPY NIGHT
FOR ME THAT FOLLOWED,

249
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,822
AND ELSE WHEN I CAROUSED,

250
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,658
OR WHEN MY PLANS WERE ACCOMPLISHED,

251
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,452
STILL I WAS NOT HAPPY."

252
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,254
IT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

253
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:15,258
"BUT THE DAY WHEN I ROSE AT DAWN

254
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:18,010
FROM THE BED OF PERFECT HEALTH,

255
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:21,013
REFRESHED, SINGING,

256
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,599
INHALING THE RIPE BREATH OF AUTUMN,

257
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,189
WHEN I SAW THE FULL MOON
IN THE WEST GROW PALE

258
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:33,151
AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE MORNING LIGHT,

259
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:37,613
WHEN I WANDERED ALONE OVER THE BEACH,

260
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:40,992
AND UNDRESSING BATHED,

261
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,910
LAUGHING WITH THE COOL WATERS,

262
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,204
AND SAW THE SUN RISE,

263
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:49,542
AND WHEN I THOUGHT
HOW MY DEAR FRIEND, MY LOVER,

264
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,918
WAS ON HIS WAY COMING,

265
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,212
O, THEN I WAS HAPPY.

266
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:56,048
O THEN EACH BREATH TASTED SWEETER,

267
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:59,177
AND ALL THAT DAY MY FOOD NOURISHED ME MORE,

268
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:02,221
AND THE BEAUTIFUL DAY PASSED WELL,

269
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,932
AND THE NEXT CAME WITH EQUAL JOY,

270
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:08,519
AND WITH THE NEXT AT EVENING
CAME MY FRIEND.

271
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:14,567
AND THAT NIGHT

272
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:17,069
WHILE ALL WAS STILL

273
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:20,781
I HEARD THE WATERS ROLL SLOWLY

274
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,325
CONTINUALLY UP THE SHORES.

275
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:25,578
I HEARD THE HISSING RUSTLE
OF THE LIQUID AND SANDS

276
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,080
AS DIRECTED TO ME

277
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:32,710
WHISPERING TO CONGRATULATE ME,

278
00:37:32,919 --> 00:37:36,339
FOR THE ONE I LOVE MOST LAY SLEEPING BY ME

279
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:38,925
UNDER THE SAME COVER IN THE COOL NIGHT,

280
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:42,178
IN THE STILLNESS IN THE AUTUMN MOONBEAMS.

281
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:44,639
HIS FACE WAS INCLINED TOWARD ME,

282
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:50,978
AND HIS ARM LAY LIGHTLY AROUND MY BREAST--

283
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:53,189
AND THAT NIGHT I WAS HAPPY."

284
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:51,330
I WANT TO GO WITH THE ONE I LOVE.

285
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,165
I DO NOT WANT TO CALCULATE THE COST.

286
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:55,214
I DO NOT WANT TO THINK
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S GOOD.

287
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,169
I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW WHETHER HE LOVES ME.

288
00:38:57,378 --> 00:38:59,171
I WANT TO GO WITH WHOM I LOVE.

289
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,424
MY FRIEND...

290
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,343
NEW YORK IS NO PLACE FOR A KID THAT YOUNG,

291
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:06,304
NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER.

292
00:39:30,244 --> 00:39:31,912
YOU'LL SEE HIM IN EIGHT WEEKS.

293
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,183
GO.

294
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:28,487
I SAID, "I WANT A LOVER."

295
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:30,698
GOD SAID, "GO WITHOUT.
LEARN TO LOVE YOUR FRIENDS.

296
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,159
THEY NEED YOU."

297
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:37,455
I SAID, "IT'S ABOUT TIME I WAS FAMOUS."

298
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,498
GOD SAID, "WHAT IS FAME ANYWAY?

299
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,836
I SAID, "I WANT A LOVER."

300
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:48,674
GOD SAID, "HERE'S A PUG. CALL HIM ROMEO."

301
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:51,594
I SAID, "WHAT ABOUT ACTING CREDITS?"

302
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:55,931
GOD SAID, "I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE LESSONS."

303
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,518
I SAID, "BUT I WANT TO BE IN MOVIES."

304
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,187
GOD SAID, "AWESOME.

305
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:05,024
HERE'S A CAMERA."

306
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,692
"I REALLY NEED A LOVER,"

307
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:08,235
I EXPLAINED.

308
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:12,114
"YOU SEE, MY HEART IS BROKEN."

309
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,786
GOD SAID, "MINE, TOO."

310
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:23,125
I SAID, "CAN I AT LEAST BE HAPPY
WITH JUST WHAT I HAVE?"

311
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:27,588
GOD SAID, "UP TO YOU."

312
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:32,134
I SAID,

313
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,889
"I STILL WANT A LOVER."

314
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:41,769
GOD SAID, "ENOUGH ALREADY.

315
00:42:41,977 --> 00:42:44,021
I DON'T EVEN GET TO MAKE OUT WITH ANYTHING.

316
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,107
THE MOON IS FRIGID.
THE SUN'S HIGH MAINTENANCE.

317
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:49,777
IT'S WAY TOO DANGEROUS TO HUG
SATURN WITH ALL THOSE RINGS,

318
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:53,155
AND, TECHNICALLY, EVEN THE
FARTHERST GALAXY FROM THE MILKY WAY

319
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:54,615
IS STILL ME.

320
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:57,493
IF I CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT
A LOVER, SO CAN YOU."

321
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:05,960
SOMETHING ABOUT GOD NOT HAVING A LOVER

322
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:08,629
SHOOK ME TO THE CORE,

323
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,673
AND I STARTED TO CRY.

324
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:14,593
GOD TRIED TO GIVE ME A HIGH FIVE

325
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:15,908
AND MADE SILLY, STUPID FACES,

326
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,596
BUT I WASN'T IN THE MOOD.

327
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:24,603
I SAID, "I CAN'T HELP IT.

328
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:26,981
I'M STILL HOPING TO FIND LOVE."

329
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:32,236
GOD SAID, "NOW YOU'RE TALKING."

330
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:03,684
TO EVERYTHING THERE IS A SEASON,

331
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:08,897
AND A TIME TO EVERY PURPOSE UNDER HEAVEN.

332
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:15,529
A TIME TO BE BORN,

333
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:17,615
AND A TIME TO DIE;

334
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:23,829
A TIME TO PLANT,

335
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:26,290
AND A TIME TO PLUCK UP
THAT WHICH IS PLANTED,

336
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:31,253
A TIME TO KILL,

337
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:35,257
A TIME TO HEAL,

338
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:41,972
A TIME TO BREAK DOWN,

339
00:44:45,184 --> 00:44:46,769
AND A TIME TO BUILD UP,

340
00:44:51,023 --> 00:44:52,691
A TIME TO WEEP,

341
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:59,114
AND A TIME TO LAUGH.

342
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:03,118
A TIME TO MOURN,

343
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,665
AND A TIME TO DANCE.

344
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:14,630
A TIME TO CAST AWAY STONES,

345
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:17,007
AND A TIME TO GATHER STONES TOGETHER...

346
00:45:22,596 --> 00:45:24,306
A TIME TO EMBRACE,

347
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:30,104
AND A TIME TO REFRAIN FROM EMBRACING.

348
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:33,565
A TIME TO GET,

349
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:37,194
AND A TIME TO LOSE.

350
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:40,739
A TIME TO KEEP,

351
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:43,659
AND A TIME TO CAST AWAY,

352
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,747
A TIME TO REND,

353
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:52,835
AND A TIME TO SEW.

354
00:45:57,423 --> 00:45:59,007
A TIME TO KEEP SILENCE...

355
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,682
AND A TIME TO SPEAK;

356
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:12,896
A TIME TO LOVE,

357
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,359
AND A TIME TO HATE,

358
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,238
A TIME OF WAR,

359
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:26,368
AND A TIME OF PEACE.

360
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:56,834
HI. THIS IS FOR ALL THE CHILDREN.

361
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,752
WE ARE INVITING ALL THE CHILDREN

362
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:00,712
IN THE HOUSE TO COME AND STAY WITH US.

363
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:02,047
MEET MY BEST FRIEND.

364
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:03,256
- HI.
- HELLO.

365
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:04,508
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

366
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:05,884
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE FUN

367
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:08,262
WITH SO MANY FRIENDS.

368
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,513
LET'S GO.

369
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:10,761
OKAY, WHOEVER DOESN'T COME

370
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,558
IS GOING TO MISS THE FUN.

371
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:14,101
ALL RIGHT, BYE,

372
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:16,895
OH, YOU'RE HERE.

373
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:36,081
HEY, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

374
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:41,169
WHAT? STOP IT.

375
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,631
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

376
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,592
ME TOO,

377
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:11,366
MOMMY, LET ME OUT.

378
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:25,380
MOMMY, LET ME OUT!

379
00:49:36,141 --> 00:49:39,269
MOMMY, LET ME OUT!

380
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,209
PEOPLE--

381
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,632
YOU TRY.

382
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:59,433
"I WANDERED

383
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:01,476
LONELY AS A CLOUD

384
00:51:01,685 --> 00:51:05,605
THAT FLOATS ON HIGH OVER VALES AND HILLS...

385
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:15,574
WHEN ALL AT ONCE I SAW A CROWD...

386
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:19,953
A HOST OF GOLDEN DAFFODILS,

387
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:21,580
BESIDE THE LAKE,

388
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,040
BENEATH THE TREES,

389
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:26,251
FLUTTERING AND DANCING IN THE BREEZE,

390
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,336
CONTINUOUS AS THE STARS
THAT SHINE AND TWINKLE

391
00:51:28,545 --> 00:51:29,545
IN THE MILKY WAY,

392
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:32,257
THEY STRETCHED IN NEVER-ENDING LINE

393
00:51:32,466 --> 00:51:34,676
ALONG THE MARGIN OF A BAY--

394
00:51:34,885 --> 00:51:38,388
TEN THOUSAND SAW I AT A GLANCE,

395
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:42,100
TOSSING THEIR HEADS IN SPRIGHTLY DANCE.

396
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:47,397
THE WAVES BESIDE THEM DANCED,

397
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:51,943
BUT THEY OUT-DID THE SPARKLING
WAVES IN GLEE.

398
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:53,779
A POET COULD NOT BUT BE GAY

399
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:56,615
IN SUCH A JOCUND COMPANY.

400
00:51:56,823 --> 00:52:00,827
I GAZED... AND GAZED...

401
00:52:01,036 --> 00:52:02,162
BUT LITTLE THOUGHT

402
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,791
WHAT WEALTH TO ME THE SHOW HAD BROUGHT.

403
00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:07,334
FOR OFT, ON MY COUCH

404
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:10,962
WHEN I LIE IN VACANT OR PENSIVE MOOD,

405
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,965
THEY FLASH UPON THE INWARD EYE

406
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:17,677
WHICH IS THE BLISS OF SOLITUDE

407
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:20,639
AND THEN

408
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:23,934
MY HEART WITH PLEASURE FILLS,

409
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:27,604
AND DANCES WITH THE DAFFODILS."

"WILL NO ONE TELL ME WHAT SHE SINGS?

YON SOLITARY HIGHLAND LASS,

415
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:04,015
REAPING AND SINGING BY HERSELF,

416

STOP HERE, OR GENTLY PASS.

417
00:53:08,645 --> 00:53:12,357
ALONE SHE CUTS AND BINDS THE GRAIN,

418
00:53:12,566 --> 00:53:16,987
AND SINGS A MELANCHOLY STRAIN.

419
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:18,530
O LISTEN!

NO NIGHTINGALE DID EVER CHANT
MORE WELCOME NOTES

423
00:53:27,164 --> 00:53:28,498
TO WEARY BANDS OF TRAVELERS

424
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:32,252
IN SOME SHADY HAUNT, AMONG ARABIAN SANDS.

425
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,588
A VOICE SO THRILLING NEVER WAS HEARD

426
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,464
IN SPRINGTIME FROM THE CUCKOO BIRD,

427
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:38,216
BREAKING THE SILENCE OF THE SEAS

428
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,844
AMONG THE FARTHEST HEBRIDES.

429
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,346
WILL NO ONE TELL ME WHAT SHE SINGS?

430
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:45,307
AND PERHAPS THE PLAINTIVE NUMBERS FLOW

431
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:47,934
FOR OLD, UNHAPPY, FAR OFF THINGS,

432
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:50,187
AND BATTLES LONG AGO,

433
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:52,397

434
00:53:52,606 --> 00:53:54,566
FAMILIAR MATTER OF TODAY?

435
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:57,068
SOME NATURAL SORROW, LOSS, OR PAIN,

436
00:53:57,277 --> 00:53:59,779
THAT HAS BEEN, AND MAY BE AGAIN?

437
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:07,412
WHATEVER THE THEME,

438
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:08,621
THE MAIDEN SANG

439
00:54:08,705 --> 00:54:10,832
AS IF HER SONG COULD HAVE NO ENDING.

440
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:16,379
I SAW HER SINGING AT HER WORK,

441
00:54:16,588 --> 00:54:18,423
AND OVER THE SICKLE BENDING.

442
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:23,094
I LISTENED, MOTIONLESS AND STILL,

443
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:25,889
AND AS I MOUNTED UP THE HILL,

444
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:27,849
THE MUSIC IN MY HEART I BORE,

445
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:30,894
LONG AFTER IT WAS HEARD NO MORE."

ARE FADING TO THEIR SLEEP,

448
00:57:43,837 --> 00:57:46,548
YOU'LL PAUSE A MOMENT
IN THE LATE FIRELIGHT,

449
00:57:46,756 --> 00:57:49,467
TOO SORROWFUL TO WEEP.

SILENCE ALL THE DAY

WITH THAT OLD KINDNESS OF DOMESTIC WOOD.

ROLLS OVER HALF AWAKE,

STRETCHES HIS PAWS, YAWNS,

458
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:22,333
LOOKING UP AT YOU,

459
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:25,086
WAGS HIS TAIL VERY SLIGHTLY FOR YOUR SAKE,

460
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,884
THAT YOU MAY FEEL HE IS UNHAPPY TOO.

461
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:35,847
A DISTANT ENGINE WHISTLES,

462
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:38,892
OR THE FLOOR CREAKS,

463
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:43,688
OR THE WANDERING NIGHT WIND BANGS A DOOR.

464
00:58:43,897 --> 00:58:47,567
SILENCE IS SCATTERED LIKE A BROKEN GLASS.

465

SEDATELY IN, MONOTONOUSLY OUT.

ONE HEAVY STEP MORE NEAR."

FROM INTERTINGLINGS AND TWITCHES

587

MADE PRONOUNCED BY HIS LIGHT FRAME.

588
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:07,097
MOST, WHEN THEY SENSE
THIS INEVITABLE DEATH,

589
01:11:07,306 --> 01:11:10,726
WHIMPER AWAY TO SECURE
A FEW MORE SHALLOW BREATHS,

590
01:11:10,935 --> 01:11:13,562
A COMFORT PAIN WITH DIRT.

591
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:16,941
SO IMAGINE THE CURIOUS TWITTER OF NATURE

592
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:18,359
WHEN THE UNUSUAL BLACK CROW

593
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:21,362
RECOGNIZED THE BEGINNING OF HIS OWN DECAY

594
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,155
AND USED UP HIS REMAINING STRENGTH

595
01:11:23,364 --> 01:11:25,741
TO MOUNT A FALLEN SCARECROW

596
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:28,494
LONG FORGOTTEN.

597
01:11:28,702 --> 01:11:31,413
CLUTCHING THE OVERSIZED BUTTONS
ONCE USED FOR EYES,

598
01:11:31,622 --> 01:11:33,666
HE SECURED HIMSELF A VIEW
OF THE GRASSY FIELDS

599
01:11:33,874 --> 01:11:34,959
AND SURROUNDING FORESTS.

600
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:41,382
HE'D BEEN SCAVENGING HIS ENTIRE LIFE.

601
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,217
FOR THE FIRST TIME...

602
01:11:46,095 --> 01:11:47,513
HE NOTICED THE CHASE

603
01:11:48,722 --> 01:11:49,890
ALL AROUND

604
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:54,770
OF PREDATOR TO PREY...

605
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:58,774
OF MATE TO POTENTIAL MATE

606
01:11:58,983 --> 01:12:00,442
THE YOUNG TO ITS MOTHER.

607
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:07,449
HE NOTICED WITHOUT CONCERN
FOR HIS OWN SURVIVAL.

608
01:12:07,658 --> 01:12:12,079
THEN HE DID SOMETHING MOST UNUSUAL INDEED.

609
01:12:12,288 --> 01:12:14,581
HE UNHOOKED HIS TIRED WINGS,

610
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,126
ALLOWING THEM TO DROOP TO EITHER SIDE,

611
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:19,670
AND LET OUT HIS UGLY VOICE.

612
01:12:22,172 --> 01:12:23,799
HIS UGLY VOICE REIGNED

613
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:26,468
OVER THE TWITTERS OF NATURE.

614
01:12:26,677 --> 01:12:29,680
THE UNCOMFORTABLE MINUTES

615
01:12:29,888 --> 01:12:31,849
OF AWKWARD, DYING MOANS,

616
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:33,600
PROVOKED SOMETHING LIKE...

617
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:37,730
CURIOSITY

618
01:12:37,938 --> 01:12:38,938
AMONG THE REST

619
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:41,442
BEFORE OPPORTUNISTIC HAWKS

620
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:43,360
SWOOPED DOWN WITH BLOODLESS ATTACK

621
01:12:43,569 --> 01:12:47,072
ENDED THE SUFFERING
OF THE UNUSUAL BLACK CROW.

622
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:48,699
THE CHASE CONTINUED,

623
01:12:49,992 --> 01:12:51,744
PREDATOR TO PREY,

624
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:53,954
MATE TO POTENTIAL MATE,

625
01:12:54,163 --> 01:12:55,456
YOUNG TO ITS MOTHER.

626
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,543
AH, THE CHASE.

627
01:13:02,338 --> 01:13:04,465
BUT THE SENSE OF THE UNUSUAL BLACK CROW

628
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:08,135
ALTERED SOME OF ITS PARTICIPANTS IN A WAY

629
01:13:08,344 --> 01:13:10,346
TOO MYSTERIOUS TO UNDERSTAND.

630
01:13:15,059 --> 01:13:16,643
IF YOU NEED TO, GO AHEAD.

631
01:13:20,064 --> 01:13:21,565

632
01:13:22,691 --> 01:13:24,318
ABOUT HOW WE WORK IN THERE.

633
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:27,654

YOU THINK YOU DO, BUT YOU DON'T.

725
01:21:22,796 --> 01:21:24,130
WAS IT BAD?

726
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:29,886
YES.

727
01:21:32,889 --> 01:21:34,474
DOES HE SUFFER?

728
01:21:41,857 --> 01:21:43,441
YES.

729
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,244
DID YOU-- DID YOU GET LONELY?

730
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:07,841
YES.

731
01:22:21,938 --> 01:22:23,523
YOU MADE ART FOR HIM.

732
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:32,032
I'M ON MEDICATION NOW.

733
01:22:35,702 --> 01:22:37,537
I DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT PILLS.

734
01:23:47,023 --> 01:23:48,441
WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN?

735
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,408
"LET IT BE FORGOTTEN,

736
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:43,580
AS A FLOWER IS FORGOTTEN,

737
01:24:45,707 --> 01:24:49,044
FORGOTTEN AS A FIRE
THAT WAS ONCE SINGING GOLD.

738
01:24:53,089 --> 01:24:55,258
LET IT BE FORGOTTEN FOR EVER AND EVER...

739
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:04,476
TIME IS A KIND FRIEND, HE WILL MAKE US OLD.

740
01:25:10,857 --> 01:25:12,734
IF ANYONE ASKS,

741
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:16,571
SAY IT WAS FORGOTTEN

742
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:18,198
LONG AND LONG AGO...

743
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:22,702
AS A FLOWER...

744
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:26,623
AS A FIRE...

745
01:25:31,628 --> 01:25:32,754
AS A HUSHED FOOTFALL

746
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:34,714
IN A LONG FORGOTTEN SNOW."

747
01:27:38,922 --> 01:27:43,009
TONIGHT WE GO ON A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME,

748
01:27:43,218 --> 01:27:44,886
FROM YOUTH

749
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:46,596
TO LOVE

750
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:48,097
TO DEATH

751
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:49,974
AND BEYOND.

752
01:27:50,183 --> 01:27:51,726
YOU'LL HEAR 32 POEMS,

753
01:27:51,935 --> 01:27:52,935
SELECTIONS

754
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:53,770
FROM THE BIBLE

755
01:27:53,978 --> 01:27:55,063
TO BLAKE

756
01:27:55,271 --> 01:27:56,271
TO MODERN-DAY POETS

757
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:58,775
LIVING RIGHT HERE IN LOS ANGELES.

758
01:27:58,983 --> 01:28:02,737
SOME OF YOU MAY THINK MEN
BELONG IN THE OFFICE

759
01:28:02,946 --> 01:28:04,364
OR IN A BALLPARK

760
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:07,116
OR EVEN IN A PRISON CELL.

761
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:08,660
WE HAPPEN TO THINK

762
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:09,868
THAT REAL MEN

763
01:28:09,994 --> 01:28:11,204
READ POETRY.

764
01:28:12,247 --> 01:28:13,873
WELCOME

765
01:28:14,082 --> 01:28:15,708
TO "GUYS READING POEMS."

766
01:28:17,126 --> 01:28:21,256
"THERE SOUND WILL SLEEP THE TRAVELER

767
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:24,133
AND DREAM HIS JOURNEY'S END."

768
01:28:24,342 --> 01:28:28,137
"BRED TO A HARDER THING
THAN TRIUMPH, TURN AWAY

769
01:28:28,346 --> 01:28:29,681
AND LIKE A LAUGHING STRING

770
01:28:29,889 --> 01:28:31,099
WHEREON MAD FINGERS PLAY

771
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:35,395
AMID A PLACE OF STONE,
BE SECRET AND EXULT."

772
01:28:35,603 --> 01:28:38,189
"A TIME TO BREAK DOWN

773
01:28:38,398 --> 01:28:39,899
AND A TIME TO BUILD UP..,

774
01:28:42,068 --> 01:28:43,403
A TIME TO WEEP.,.

775
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:48,116
AND A TIME TO LAUGH."

776
01:28:48,324 --> 01:28:50,785
"I THINK OF HIM DANCING
AND HOLDING MY BODY...

777
01:28:55,206 --> 01:28:57,250
BEFORE MY PARENTS HURT ME...

778
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:59,335
HIM HOLDING ME AT THE ONLY TIME

779
01:28:59,544 --> 01:29:01,004
I CAN REFLECT UPON AS INNOCENT."

780
01:29:03,423 --> 01:29:07,844
"EXPECTING THE MAIN THINGS FROM YOU."

781
01:29:14,058 --> 01:29:18,604
BLESSED ARE THEY WHO ARE
PERSECUTED FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS' SAKE,

782
01:29:18,813 --> 01:29:22,108
FOR THEIRS IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.

783
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:43,296
HE HAD A LARGE STACK OF MEMORIAL CARDS,

784
01:29:43,504 --> 01:29:45,840
HANDED FROM FUNERALS.

785
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,511
FRIENDS AND LOVERS STOLEN BY AIDS.

786
01:29:55,558 --> 01:29:59,103
I HAD JOKED ONCE THAT...

787
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:01,606
HE MIGHT NEED A RECIPE BOX TO

788
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:05,193
CATEGORIZE AND ALPHABETIZE...

789
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:06,778
THE MOUNTAIN STACK.

790
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:12,825
HE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT.

791
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:20,500
"THAT'S NOT HOW RECIPE BOXES
ARE ORGANIZED," HE SAID.

792
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:26,422
"THEY WERE ORGANIZED BY COURSE."

793
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:35,556
GREAT.

794
01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:41,646
NOW I HAVE TO DECIDE WHO'S AN ENTREE,

795
01:30:43,815 --> 01:30:46,943
DESSERT,

796
01:30:47,151 --> 01:30:49,028
AN HORS D'OEUVRE."

797
01:30:54,283 --> 01:30:55,701
SO HE BEGAN TO...

798
01:30:58,287 --> 01:31:00,039
SHOUT OUT THE NAMES OF HIS FRIENDS.

799
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:03,126
AND WHERE HE WOULD PLACE THEM.

800
01:31:12,009 --> 01:31:14,095
JOSE, ENTREE.

801
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:22,937
MICHAEL... HORS D'OEUVRE.

802
01:31:23,146 --> 01:31:25,273
SUSAN...

803
01:31:25,481 --> 01:31:27,733
HORS D'OEUVRE.

804
01:31:28,943 --> 01:31:30,570
JOEY...

805
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,823
ENTREE.

806
01:31:39,996 --> 01:31:42,123
JONATHAN...

807
01:31:42,331 --> 01:31:43,749
HORS D'OEUVRE.

808
01:31:47,628 --> 01:31:50,089
ALEX... HORS D'OEUVRE,

809
01:31:56,345 --> 01:31:58,431
AND FOR HIS LAST LOVER, RAMON...

810
01:32:01,184 --> 01:32:02,184
DESSERT.

811
01:32:08,024 --> 01:32:10,067
GO AHEAD.
