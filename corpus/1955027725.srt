1
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,718
Mooney!

2
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,286
Where you at, Mooney?

3
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:42,623
Mooney! Mooney!

4
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,862
Hey, don't drop your wad, you
get spied on in the shower.

5
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:49,496
Do it.

6
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:50,697
Just do whatever faggy shit you want

7
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:55,235
with your Cub Scout buddies,
but keep the fuck away from us!

8
00:02:57,906 --> 00:02:59,606
What's that? I can't hear you.

9
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:01,808
Don't give us that
shit, you fucking liar.

10
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,543
I wasn't spying.

11
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,778
What were you doing then?
Were you taking a dump?

12
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,180
'Cause that's what toilets are for, man.

13
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:07,481
It doesn't smell like
he was taking a dump.

14
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:09,383
Does it smell like he was taking a dump?

15
00:03:09,385 --> 00:03:12,219
Nah, man, someone needs
to give this motherfucker

16
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:12,920
a shitting lesson, huh?

17
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:14,353
Oh, is that... is that what it is?

18
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:16,790
Mooney, you need a
lesson in potty training?

19
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:19,660
Mooney, you're in
luck 'cause I gotta go.

20
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:22,196
Oh, yeah.

21
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:30,804
Anybody else gotta go, huh?

22
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:31,938
Who the fuck is Jamie Marks?

23
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,944
Jamie Marks, he was... he
was in your homeroom, right?

24
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:38,378
Yeah.

25
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,914
Did... did he have red hair?

26
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,848
Nope.

27
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,516
Wait.

28
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:46,619
Was Jamie Marks a boy or a girl?

29
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:47,921
It's a boy, you moron.

30
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:50,556
Jamie Marks is that kid
with the... the glasses

31
00:03:50,558 --> 00:03:53,492
and the... the... the boy scouts shirt.

32
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:54,760
That's him, right?

33
00:03:54,762 --> 00:03:56,330
Mooney Marks.

34
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:58,531
Told you.

35
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,766
Oh, you know what I heard?

36
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:02,669
I heard they found him
without his eyeballs.

37
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:03,770
I mean, like, seriously.

38
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:05,938
And he was raped.

39
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:16,749
Yes, Elizabeth.

40
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:19,852
Aren't we gonna talk
about what's happened?

41
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:26,292
Okay.

42
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:27,693
Fine.

43
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:30,630
Let's talk about what's happened.

44
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:34,500
Who wants to talk about Mooney Marks?

45
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,303
Do you, Elizabeth?

46
00:04:36,305 --> 00:04:38,371
You were a good friend of his?

47
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:42,475
How did it make you feel
when you learned he was gone?

48
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:46,746
Hm? Anyone?

49
00:04:47,048 --> 00:04:49,915
Should we talk about
all those fond memories

50
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,285
we have of Jamie?

51
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:55,421
How everyone thought
he was such a great guy?

52
00:04:56,657 --> 00:04:58,958
Who knew him?

53
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,060
Gregory?

54
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:02,962
Huh?

55
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:04,730
Belinda.

56
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:07,500
Eric.

57
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:09,802
Anyone.

58
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:14,540
Now...

59
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:17,476
I think it's awful what's happened.

60
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:17,910
I do.

61
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:19,745
And if any of you wanna stay after class

62
00:05:19,747 --> 00:05:23,516
and discuss it, please
feel free to do so.

63
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,421
But right now, I think we
should get back to work.

64
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:19,439
What are you doing here?

65
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,978
Visiting.

66
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:28,881
What are you doing here?

67
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:34,521
You don't have to leave.

68
00:06:39,226 --> 00:06:40,893
It smells good.

69
00:06:44,297 --> 00:06:47,199
So do you really collect rocks?

70
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:49,803
Yeah.

71
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:51,804
Rocks are the best.

72
00:06:58,244 --> 00:07:00,513
He was in my homeroom.

73
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:12,991
Down there is where I found him.

74
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:19,432
He looked so scared.

75
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:26,372
You're Adam.

76
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:29,909
Gracie.

77
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:33,846
I know your older brother...

78
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:35,713
Unfortunately.

79
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:44,122
You should come by tomorrow...

80
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:45,957
And see my collection.

81
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,727
My parents will be at
marriage counseling.

82
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:41,713
How was practice?

83
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:43,281
It's all right.

84
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:47,217
I'm gonna go down to the
landing for a bit, okay?

85
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:48,186
Just for a quick drink.

86
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:51,054
I won't be late, I promise.

87
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,891
Have fun.

88
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:54,291
Thank you.

89
00:08:54,593 --> 00:08:54,926
Hey.

90
00:08:54,928 --> 00:08:58,195
Don't ever put your happiness
in anyone else's hands.

91
00:08:58,197 --> 00:09:00,665
You hear me?

92
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:01,832
I'll drop it.

93
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,968
I'll drop it every time.

94
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:08,806
Bye!

95
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:02,327
Oh, my babies.

96
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:07,297
Just rest, mom.

97
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,934
You're okay.

98
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:12,904
They said you were gonna be okay.

99
00:10:12,906 --> 00:10:14,905
I know they did, honey.

100
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:22,679
Aaron.

101
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:24,649
Baby, look at me.

102
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:28,852
You're gonna have to cover
my shift tomorrow night, okay?

103
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:41,264
We're gonna be fine.

104
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,636
You'll see.

105
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,110
Latham?

106
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:55,045
Here.

107
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:55,712
Leeds.

108
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:57,181
Here.

109
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:58,048
Long.

110
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,950
Here.

111
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,418
Marks.

112
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,789
Oh, dear.

113
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,156
Excuse me.

114
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:09,159
McCormick.

115
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:11,261
Here.

116
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,034
Okay.

117
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:22,305
All right.

118
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,878
Hello?

119
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,447
Yeah.

120
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,084
Stop calling here.

121
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:34,818
Who is it?

122
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,420
The crazy bitch that hit you?

123
00:11:36,422 --> 00:11:38,955
She doesn't want to talk to you!

124
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:40,691
Yeah.

125
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:42,325
What do you think she wants?

126
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,694
She's a little busy right now,

127
00:11:43,696 --> 00:11:47,297
considering you just ran
her over with your van.

128
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:54,805
So what took you so long?

129
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:56,206
Sorry.

130
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,708
I ran.

131
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:02,978
Come on.

132
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:18,829
Don't just stand there, come in.

133
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,073
How's your drink?

134
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:32,441
Did I make it too strong?

135
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,222
You've got quite a collection.

136
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,093
I... I didn't know rocks
could be so beautiful.

137
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,497
I know.

138
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:00,337
Sit down.

139
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:18,455
I, uh, like your shelves.

140
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:19,255
Thanks.

141
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,391
My dad made them for me.

142
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:35,271
I see graves all the time now.

143
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,987
Beds are kinda like graves.

144
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:59,862
What kind of funeral do you want?

145
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:05,234
Aren't they all the same?

146
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:08,370
No, they're all completely different.

147
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:11,507
In Mexico, on day of the dead,

148
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:13,376
the families go to the cemeteries

149
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:16,212
and picnic on the graves of a loved one.

150
00:14:16,214 --> 00:14:18,180
They burn incense to guide the way

151
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:21,116
between the road of
the dead and the living.

152
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:23,953
Is that what you were
doing the other day?

153
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,276
I think you should go now.

154
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:52,915
Okay.

155
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,022
Don't worry, you're invited back.

156
00:15:02,425 --> 00:15:03,893
Oh.

157
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,602
Thanks for showing me your rocks.

158
00:15:34,925 --> 00:15:36,492
Not today, bro.

159
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:38,494
You're on your own.

160
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:39,094
Come on.

161
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:41,462
Sorry, we got important
shit to attend to.

162
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,299
Yeah, like what?

163
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:45,968
Aaron's taking us to
where they found him.

164
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,202
You should come, Adam.

165
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:48,369
Jenny Miller says she saw him

166
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:51,006
hanging around by the bridge down there.

167
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:53,475
No thanks.

168
00:15:53,477 --> 00:15:55,443
It's not a circus.

169
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:57,112
What'd you just say?

170
00:15:57,114 --> 00:15:57,680
Let's just go.

171
00:15:57,682 --> 00:16:00,382
Why do you give a shit what we do?

172
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,572
I think it's about...

173
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:26,976
Seven months.

174
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:29,711
I understand.

175
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:32,046
I think it was about...

176
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:35,149
That one night, I had to...

177
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,053
Adam?

178
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:39,554
Honey, is that you?

179
00:16:39,556 --> 00:16:40,421
Yeah.

180
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:42,590
Come in here a minute.

181
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,227
What's up?

182
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,501
What is she doing here?

183
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:54,235
Adam, what happened wasn't Lucy's fault.

184
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:55,704
It was an accident. Of
course it was her fault.

185
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:58,239
She's my friend, I want
you to be nice to her.

186
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:01,275
Since when? Adam, I know
this is really tough for you.

187
00:17:01,277 --> 00:17:03,679
I know there's been so
much going on, but...

188
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:05,246
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

189
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:08,516
It's... it's so awful what
happened to that Marks boy,

190
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:11,185
and... and... and if you need to talk...

191
00:17:11,187 --> 00:17:14,456
Just stay out of it, Paralyzer.

192
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,657
Adam.

193
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,060
Mom.

194
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:21,262
She is the reason you're
in this wheelchair.

195
00:17:21,264 --> 00:17:23,364
She hit you head-on, she was drunk...

196
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:25,367
I wasn't drunk, it was an accident.

197
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:27,335
Yeah, a drunk accident. You know that.

198
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,436
It... I wasn't drunk.

199
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:29,370
Just go away.

200
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:30,738
Lucy's just trying to help.

201
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,673
You apologize to her this instant.

202
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:35,343
Apologize for what?

203
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,210
We are not the only ones

204
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:38,079
who've had tragedy touch our lives.

205
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:41,582
Fate brings people
together for a reason.

206
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:45,286
What does that even mean?

207
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:49,123
There's some chili on the stove.

208
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,492
Will you put it in bowls for us?

209
00:17:52,528 --> 00:17:54,228
Why can't the Paralyzer do it?

210
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,231
Lucy made the chili, Adam.

211
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:01,536
Did you know Adam was born prematurely?

212
00:18:01,737 --> 00:18:04,839
With underdeveloped lungs
and a murmur in his heart?

213
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:06,107
- Really?
- Yeah.

214
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:08,176
Oh, that's so scary.

215
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:16,683
My parents are gone until 10 tonight.

216
00:18:16,685 --> 00:18:18,286
I mean, if you wanna come over.

217
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:21,722
<i>I never had to worry
about him doing things</i>

218
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:23,524
<i>that he wasn't supposed to.</i>

219
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:28,529
<i>He was a... a scout,
and always on a project.</i>

220
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:29,697
<i>I'll tell you this much.</i>

221
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:33,334
<i>Some sick pervert murdered my boy,</i>

222
00:18:33,336 --> 00:18:36,471
<i>and God's vengeance
needs to be carried out,</i>

223
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:38,605
<i>so Jamie won't have died in Va...</i>

224
00:18:39,642 --> 00:18:41,442
What a load of crap.

225
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:43,544
So what if they find
out what happened to him?

226
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:47,515
I mean, it's not gonna
make things meaningful.

227
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,216
What do you mean?

228
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:51,853
He's still dead.

229
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:52,853
Big fucking deal.

230
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:55,690
It won't change his story.

231
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:00,293
Sorry.

232
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:05,466
You don't have to be sorry.

233
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:13,741
Can we please not talk about him?

234
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,818
I think that he should've been loved.

235
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:02,322
Though...

236
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,828
He never got that.

237
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,334
Not like how everyone deserves.

238
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,311
What are you looking at?

239
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:25,712
Nothing.

240
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,282
Look, do you want another drink?

241
00:20:29,284 --> 00:20:31,418
Uh, yeah, sure.

242
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,619
Hey.

243
00:20:34,355 --> 00:20:35,722
Come here.

244
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,359
Adam.

245
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:42,996
Don't.

246
00:20:42,998 --> 00:20:44,464
Gracie.

247
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:50,837
Look, just pretend
like you don't see him.

248
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:58,612
But I do see him.

249
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:04,751
What does he want?

250
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:05,919
How the fuck should I know?

251
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:09,656
Can... come on, can we
please just drop this?

252
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:12,726
Look, I did not choose
for him to be here.

253
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:14,861
I found him, but not
because I wanted to.

254
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:17,963
You're acting like I asked for this.

255
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:18,965
Look, I'm sorry, I was just...

256
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:21,567
Adam, I don't want a dead boy

257
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:25,805
lurking around outside
of my house, okay?

258
00:21:28,276 --> 00:21:29,576
Okay?

259
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:35,515
And...

260
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:38,985
Trust me.

261
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:42,656
Neither do you.

262
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:23,996
What are you waiting for?

263
00:22:31,973 --> 00:22:33,306
You're not real.

264
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:35,541
Don't be frightened.

265
00:22:36,444 --> 00:22:38,644
I don't wanna hurt you.

266
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:42,181
I'm not frightened.

267
00:22:43,618 --> 00:22:46,018
You can call me Mooney.

268
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:52,158
Everybody does.

269
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:57,063
I never liked that name.

270
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:01,534
Me neither.

271
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:07,640
I won't call you that then.

272
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:13,746
Thank you, Adam.

273
00:23:21,254 --> 00:23:25,024
I never thought anybody
would be able to see me.

274
00:23:26,193 --> 00:23:27,494
I see you.

275
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:33,299
Gracie can too, I think.

276
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:40,439
She's just scared.

277
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,685
Don't be shy.

278
00:23:56,756 --> 00:23:59,658
I know you wanna try it.

279
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,594
Try what?

280
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:10,536
Take off your clothes first.

281
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:22,714
Go ahead.

282
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:04,090
Get in.

283
00:25:55,274 --> 00:25:56,774
Close your eyes.

284
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:04,649
Can you help me, Adam?

285
00:26:09,155 --> 00:26:10,356
Yes.

286
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:16,227
I knew it.

287
00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:18,830
I knew it would be you.

288
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,341
What the fuck?

289
00:26:30,343 --> 00:26:31,576
Isn't that...

290
00:26:31,578 --> 00:26:32,410
Why are you naked?

291
00:26:32,412 --> 00:26:34,279
Get the fuck outta there!

292
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:37,582
Put your fucking pants
on, for Christ's sake.

293
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:58,202
They both knocked,
but they can't come in.

294
00:27:01,508 --> 00:27:02,607
Oh, my God.

295
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:03,508
Adam?

296
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,277
Adam, honey, are you okay?

297
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,912
Why are you naked?

298
00:27:08,914 --> 00:27:10,615
What happened?

299
00:28:14,345 --> 00:28:15,579
Hello?

300
00:28:37,735 --> 00:28:39,003
Hi.

301
00:28:43,908 --> 00:28:46,044
What are you doing in there?

302
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:49,480
Why are you all wet?

303
00:28:50,515 --> 00:28:51,915
I'm sorry.

304
00:28:54,852 --> 00:28:56,453
Don't be sorry.

305
00:28:59,657 --> 00:29:01,658
Where are your clothes?

306
00:29:06,764 --> 00:29:08,732
I don't have any.

307
00:29:32,123 --> 00:29:33,557
Here.

308
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:39,830
Are you sure?

309
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:42,499
I'm sure.

310
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:45,936
- Really?
- Yes, really, put on...

311
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:50,040
Thank you.

312
00:30:26,477 --> 00:30:27,677
Wow.

313
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:31,914
Your room's nice.

314
00:30:47,664 --> 00:30:49,032
What happened?

315
00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:52,836
I mean, really.

316
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:55,939
Dead?

317
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:58,975
Right?

318
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:01,143
Don't worry about me.

319
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:04,847
Who did it?

320
00:31:06,217 --> 00:31:09,618
Don't ask me that,
please don't ask me that.

321
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,720
Why not?

322
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:13,556
Right?

323
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:15,091
I can help you.

324
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:16,692
Help them track down whoever did...

325
00:31:16,694 --> 00:31:18,061
It was...

326
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:21,898
It was awful.

327
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:27,536
That's all you need to know.

328
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:43,018
Or you can help me.

329
00:31:46,723 --> 00:31:47,923
How?

330
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:53,629
Give me something.

331
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:56,832
What?

332
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,568
A word.

333
00:31:59,269 --> 00:32:01,570
Whisper it to me.

334
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,274
What kind of word?

335
00:32:06,877 --> 00:32:08,911
It doesn't matter.

336
00:32:08,913 --> 00:32:11,113
It could be anything.

337
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:49,285
Murder.

338
00:33:14,812 --> 00:33:17,746
Honey, there's a call for you!

339
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,617
Hello?

340
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:22,951
Uh, who is it?

341
00:33:22,953 --> 00:33:24,286
It's a girl.

342
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:28,691
What'd you say your name was?

343
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:30,726
Gracie Highsmith.

344
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:35,998
Come out here when you're done, okay?

345
00:33:42,372 --> 00:33:42,905
Hi.

346
00:33:42,907 --> 00:33:45,307
<i>Where were you today?</i>

347
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:48,142
<i>Are you okay?</i>

348
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:50,112
I... I... I'm fine.

349
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:51,013
How are you?

350
00:33:51,015 --> 00:33:53,983
<i>Don't patronize me, Adam.</i>

351
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:56,017
<i>Spit it out.</i>

352
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:57,319
I said I'm fine.

353
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,323
<i>You should have listened to me.</i>

354
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:04,059
What are you talking about?

355
00:34:04,061 --> 00:34:06,894
<i>Look, if you are freaked out</i>

356
00:34:06,896 --> 00:34:09,664
<i>about what happened, I understand.</i>

357
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,367
What happened?

358
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:13,768
Everyone knows, Adam.

359
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,371
Everyone knows what you
did down at the river.

360
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:19,108
What about a green bean
casserole with those crispy...

361
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,842
That sounds good.

362
00:34:20,844 --> 00:34:22,243
Who's Gracie?

363
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:23,878
You think they would like that?

364
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,281
- Huh?
- Do you have any food allergies?

365
00:34:26,283 --> 00:34:27,715
Where the fuck is he?

366
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:28,850
Watch your language.

367
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:29,885
- Fuck you.
- Adam!

368
00:34:30,855 --> 00:34:32,854
How could you?

369
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:37,960
Did you fuck Gracie Highsmith?

370
00:34:37,962 --> 00:34:39,427
Fuck you, Aaron!

371
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,061
What?

372
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:42,230
I'm just saying she's
kinda... I hate you!

373
00:34:42,232 --> 00:34:45,000
Get the fuck off.

374
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,904
Hey, hey, knock it off!

375
00:34:49,906 --> 00:34:52,107
Knock it off!

376
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:53,274
He started it!

377
00:34:53,276 --> 00:34:55,176
I don't care.

378
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,045
How could you tell everybody?

379
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:58,913
Aaron, what are you doing?

380
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:01,149
You're my brother.

381
00:35:01,151 --> 00:35:02,784
Yeah?

382
00:35:02,786 --> 00:35:03,985
Well, I wish I wasn't.

383
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:14,329
Adam, baby, you okay?

384
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:20,334
I'm fucking fine, how are you?

385
00:35:31,947 --> 00:35:33,381
What are you doing?

386
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:37,318
Sorry, I was just trying them on.

387
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,124
Sorry... I'm sorry.

388
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:45,393
Don't draw this shit all over my floor

389
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:48,863
and make me clean it up.

390
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:56,738
Stop getting undressed.

391
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,774
It's fine, Jesus.

392
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:09,416
What's wrong, Adam?

393
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:14,355
Nothing's wrong.

394
00:36:14,357 --> 00:36:17,291
What happened to your face?

395
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:18,826
Oh, my God.

396
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:21,028
What's wrong with your face?

397
00:36:23,998 --> 00:36:26,033
You're funny.

398
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:29,070
Yeah, well, you look ridiculous.

399
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:34,775
Where were you?

400
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:38,812
I was in there.

401
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,884
In that closet?

402
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:45,819
Yes.

403
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:47,955
I like it in there.

404
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,559
And... it's...

405
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:57,063
More than a closet if
you know how to use it.

406
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:01,134
What are you talking about?

407
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:08,108
Uh... I guess I can show you.

408
00:37:09,378 --> 00:37:10,545
Yeah.

409
00:37:15,384 --> 00:37:17,518
Come on.

410
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,921
In my closet?

411
00:37:19,923 --> 00:37:21,222
Yeah.

412
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,606
You ready?

413
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:41,575
Mm-hmm.

414
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,377
Close your eyes.

415
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:46,581
There's nothing worth to see.

416
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,982
But whatever you do,

417
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:50,351
don't let go.

418
00:37:58,492 --> 00:38:00,227
Where are we?

419
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:06,566
I really don't feel so good, Jamie.

420
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:34,494
I don't understand.

421
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,397
You don't have to understand.

422
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:40,400
Stick with me, Adam...

423
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:43,603
And I can show you
what you need to know.

424
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:52,244
Yeah, mom, I heard you!

425
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,281
Shh, shh, shh.

426
00:39:25,312 --> 00:39:26,046
Let's go.

427
00:39:26,048 --> 00:39:28,614
We should get out of here.

428
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,684
Time to go.

429
00:39:30,686 --> 00:39:32,051
Come on, Adam, let's go.

430
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:54,540
Why did you do it, Adam?

431
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:59,980
I don't know.

432
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:02,548
That's such a cop-out.

433
00:40:04,452 --> 00:40:06,051
Well, what do you want me to say?

434
00:40:06,053 --> 00:40:07,420
It's kinda...

435
00:40:08,555 --> 00:40:10,757
Hard to explain.

436
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,128
What do you care, anyways?

437
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:18,264
- Why are you mad at me?
- I'm not.

438
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:20,265
I just...

439
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:22,302
I'm not, I'm not.

440
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:29,442
Jamie showed up.

441
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:32,011
In my closet.

442
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,113
- What?
- I know.

443
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,183
He seems nice enough.

444
00:40:38,585 --> 00:40:42,221
You have to stay away from him, Adam.

445
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,524
Do you hear me?

446
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:48,360
What if I could help him?

447
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,498
Catch whoever killed him?

448
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:56,168
You know, what happened
to Jamie, it was awful,

449
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:59,204
and it was tragic, and
it was everything else

450
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,507
that everyone says it is.

451
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:02,409
But we have a choice,

452
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:05,545
and all of us have a choice,

453
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:07,146
and I made mine.

454
00:41:08,214 --> 00:41:10,282
What did you choose?

455
00:41:11,718 --> 00:41:13,786
Not to see him.

456
00:41:15,488 --> 00:41:16,790
Life.

457
00:41:18,324 --> 00:41:20,527
What did he say to you?

458
00:41:22,128 --> 00:41:23,695
Don't be crazy, Adam.

459
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:26,065
I didn't talk to him.

460
00:41:31,604 --> 00:41:33,439
Well...

461
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:34,406
Maybe you should've.

462
00:41:47,154 --> 00:41:50,155
Adam McCormick.

463
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,460
Why were you beating off
on Mooney Marks' grave?

464
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,431
That's what I heard.

465
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,635
Uh-uh-uh,
not so fast.

466
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:04,837
- Hey.
- What?

467
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,472
Your running coach called and said

468
00:42:06,474 --> 00:42:08,106
you've been skipping practice.

469
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,642
Is that true?

470
00:42:10,644 --> 00:42:11,310
Huh?

471
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:14,179
I tried to explain everything
that's been going on, but...

472
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:15,279
Yeah, tell everyone, why don't you.

473
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:16,482
Well, what am I supposed to do?

474
00:42:16,484 --> 00:42:17,349
We're worried about you.

475
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:19,417
I'm fine, you're the one
who let the Paralyzer...

476
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:21,320
Stop calling her that.
I'm worried about you.

477
00:42:21,322 --> 00:42:22,453
Well, we're fine. Shh, shh, shh.

478
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:28,427
<i>I myself learned that
people really do care.</i>

479
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:29,594
<i>You are truly missed,</i>

480
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:31,463
<i>and I only wish that I could've learned</i>

481
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:36,368
<i>my self-worth without your tragedy.</i>

482
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,170
What bullshit.

483
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:39,271
You know her?

484
00:42:39,273 --> 00:42:42,307
<i>Thank you for giving
me the hope to live.</i>

485
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,709
<i>While the tragic death
has not officially</i>

486
00:42:44,711 --> 00:42:47,279
<i>been ruled a homicide, police...</i>

487
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:51,649
Aaron!

488
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:53,785
Will you check the fuse?

489
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:56,855
That poor boy's mother.

490
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:57,756
You don't know anything.

491
00:42:57,758 --> 00:42:59,690
Look, Adam, I know
that you don't like me

492
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:02,426
for reasons that your mother
has decided to forgive me,

493
00:43:02,428 --> 00:43:05,364
but you do need to
respect our friendship.

494
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:06,631
Yeah.

495
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:07,733
Don't worry about it, Linda.

496
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:09,500
He's just going through puberty.

497
00:43:09,502 --> 00:43:10,801
Pubic hair can be really disturbing...

498
00:43:10,803 --> 00:43:14,338
Stop fucking talking
about me like I'm not here.

499
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,807
Watch your language, you little shit.

500
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:17,642
Okay, both of you.

501
00:43:17,644 --> 00:43:18,810
Mom...
un-fucking-believable.

502
00:43:18,812 --> 00:43:21,879
Listen, I am your mother,
and I love you very much.

503
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:23,649
And whatever it is that
you're going through,

504
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:26,518
you can tell me... we can talk about it.

505
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,489
I am not going through anything.

506
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:33,391
You can tell me, anything.

507
00:43:33,393 --> 00:43:37,396
We can get through it.
We're here for you, Adam.

508
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:39,530
I just don't understand.

509
00:43:46,606 --> 00:43:48,306
What's wrong, Adam?

510
00:43:57,249 --> 00:43:59,618
I think I need to get out of here.

511
00:44:02,287 --> 00:44:03,821
Where would you go?

512
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:09,493
Anywhere.

513
00:44:11,496 --> 00:44:13,564
Can I come with you?

514
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:19,370
Sure...

515
00:44:19,372 --> 00:44:21,572
If we had a place to go.

516
00:44:24,276 --> 00:44:26,444
I might know a place.

517
00:44:33,952 --> 00:44:35,953
Get in here.

518
00:44:35,955 --> 00:44:38,456
They didn't see you, did they?

519
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:49,700
Hi.

520
00:44:50,402 --> 00:44:51,902
Could you tell me everything you know

521
00:44:51,904 --> 00:44:54,038
about Francis Wilkinson?

522
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,841
You mean "fuck you" Francis?

523
00:44:56,843 --> 00:44:59,777
I know what everyone knows.

524
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:01,945
Are you okay, Adam?

525
00:45:02,648 --> 00:45:03,681
Is that really why you're here,

526
00:45:03,683 --> 00:45:06,517
to talk about "fuck you" Francis?

527
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:12,956
Okay.

528
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:16,660
She lived on a little farm

529
00:45:16,662 --> 00:45:19,864
on the hill over by south bend road.

530
00:45:19,866 --> 00:45:24,735
And her parents did awful things to her,

531
00:45:24,737 --> 00:45:25,970
at least that's the story.

532
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:28,773
And then, one day, she had enough.

533
00:45:28,775 --> 00:45:31,608
And you're supposed to be able to...

534
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,946
Go down to a little
cemetery by the field,

535
00:45:35,948 --> 00:45:37,748
and you can call her up.

536
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,951
And apparently, she's real ornery.

537
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:44,555
I don't know.

538
00:45:48,593 --> 00:45:51,062
You really have never heard that story?

539
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:55,866
Adam.

540
00:46:15,686 --> 00:46:17,888
Does that hurt?

541
00:46:46,852 --> 00:46:49,018
Wait, wait...

542
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,887
What are we doing?

543
00:46:53,426 --> 00:46:56,493
Usual sex.

544
00:46:57,129 --> 00:47:00,965
You have a condom?

545
00:47:00,967 --> 00:47:03,466
Like, with me?

546
00:47:03,468 --> 00:47:06,569
Uh, yeah.

547
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:07,670
Aw...

548
00:47:07,672 --> 00:47:10,006
Well, then we'll have to keep things

549
00:47:10,008 --> 00:47:13,109
strictly no penetration.

550
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:15,478
Um...

551
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,548
Okay.

552
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,443
You have a pretty penis, Adam.

553
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:50,847
Thanks.

554
00:47:55,686 --> 00:48:00,089
Your... breasts look creamy.

555
00:48:03,193 --> 00:48:05,061
Creamy?

556
00:48:05,063 --> 00:48:07,062
Yeah.

557
00:48:07,064 --> 00:48:09,833
Like white chocolate.

558
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:33,823
Wait... Gracie, wait, stop.

559
00:48:33,825 --> 00:48:36,525
What's wrong?

560
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:38,895
Nothing, nothing, I just...

561
00:48:38,897 --> 00:48:41,664
- Did you ejaculate?
- No!

562
00:48:41,666 --> 00:48:44,166
No.

563
00:48:50,273 --> 00:48:52,742
Come here.

564
00:49:05,588 --> 00:49:09,558
I'm thinking about leaving.

565
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,794
Where would you go?

566
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:19,301
Jamie says I can maybe stay
with Frances for a few days...

567
00:49:19,303 --> 00:49:21,069
What the fuck, Adam?!

568
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:23,605
Why are you messing
around with Mooney Marks?

569
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,708
I'm not messing around with Jamie...

570
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,310
Call it what you want.

571
00:49:28,312 --> 00:49:32,180
I... I need to get away for a few days.

572
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:34,049
You can't give him what he needs.

573
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:35,284
How do you know what he needs?

574
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:36,119
Oh, and you do?

575
00:49:36,121 --> 00:49:37,086
He just needs to be loved.

576
00:49:37,088 --> 00:49:38,320
You of all people
should understand that.

577
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:41,123
I don't want anyone to tell
me who to feel sorry for.

578
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:44,227
Don't feel sorry then.

579
00:49:44,229 --> 00:49:47,297
Fine, I won't!

580
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,349
You know what?

581
00:50:07,351 --> 00:50:12,988
You are going to be the
one that's sorry, Adam.

582
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:14,656
You'll see.

583
00:50:43,886 --> 00:50:46,287
Are you okay?

584
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,329
I went to go say goodbye to Gracie.

585
00:50:58,134 --> 00:51:01,903
Frances says we can stay.

586
00:51:06,843 --> 00:51:09,044
I'll go get things
ready, and you can meet me

587
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:12,848
over there tomorrow, okay?

588
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,083
Okay.

589
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:19,921
Can I have another?

590
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:23,257
Word?

591
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:37,905
Sorrow.

592
00:51:39,409 --> 00:51:42,711
Say it like you mean it.

593
00:51:46,749 --> 00:51:49,751
Sorrow.

594
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,362
Thank you, Adam.

595
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:40,161
Hey, Adam.

596
00:53:40,163 --> 00:53:42,897
You made it!

597
00:53:42,899 --> 00:53:46,400
We'll stay in the barn over there.

598
00:53:46,402 --> 00:53:48,002
- The barn?
- Yeah.

599
00:53:48,004 --> 00:53:50,805
It doesn't look like much, but it's dry,

600
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:51,539
there's lots of room,

601
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:56,177
and no one will see you from the road.

602
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:58,145
Okay.

603
00:53:58,147 --> 00:53:58,545
Come on.

604
00:53:58,547 --> 00:54:00,881
Aren't you gonna introduce us?

605
00:54:00,883 --> 00:54:05,885
Oh, sorry, she's... she's a little shy.

606
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:07,454
I'm shy too.

607
00:54:07,456 --> 00:54:11,492
Frances, this is my good friend Adam.

608
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,462
Nice to meet you.

609
00:54:18,868 --> 00:54:21,435
Come on, Adam, let's go.

610
00:54:21,437 --> 00:54:24,003
I'll make you a fire.

611
00:54:24,005 --> 00:54:25,906
Let's go.

612
00:54:27,242 --> 00:54:29,610
Come on, Adam.

613
00:54:57,271 --> 00:54:59,540
There you go.

614
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:01,942
Warm, huh?

615
00:55:14,155 --> 00:55:17,524
Don't pay attention to her.

616
00:55:17,526 --> 00:55:20,494
She's just jealous.

617
00:55:23,497 --> 00:55:26,332
Jealous of what?

618
00:55:28,436 --> 00:55:30,603
Of you.

619
00:55:35,577 --> 00:55:38,177
Let's play a game.

620
00:55:40,948 --> 00:55:42,983
Okay.

621
00:55:46,087 --> 00:55:48,988
I'm gonna tell you a story...

622
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:52,225
And then you tell me one.

623
00:55:54,029 --> 00:55:56,162
What kind of story?

624
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:59,098
A story about me.

625
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,402
Something you remember.

626
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:04,203
Like this,

627
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:06,039
I remember this one time

628
00:56:06,041 --> 00:56:09,175
when you won first
place at the track meet,

629
00:56:09,177 --> 00:56:11,210
which meant you'd go to state,

630
00:56:11,212 --> 00:56:14,047
and the team picked you
up on their shoulders

631
00:56:14,049 --> 00:56:16,516
and carried you around.

632
00:56:20,087 --> 00:56:21,521
You were there?

633
00:56:21,523 --> 00:56:24,290
Of course.

634
00:56:25,993 --> 00:56:28,528
I like watching you run.

635
00:56:31,031 --> 00:56:33,466
It's like reading a poem.

636
00:56:33,468 --> 00:56:36,536
You sort of run that way.

637
00:56:36,538 --> 00:56:40,173
Like a line in a poem.

638
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:45,011
Thanks.

639
00:56:47,614 --> 00:56:50,650
It's your turn.

640
00:56:50,652 --> 00:56:54,354
Tell me one about me.

641
00:56:56,724 --> 00:56:59,258
Okay.

642
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:05,498
Come on, slowpoke!

643
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,068
No, I, um...

644
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:12,238
I remember this one time...

645
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:16,476
I think it was the spring

646
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:18,611
because it was really muddy.

647
00:57:18,613 --> 00:57:20,346
I was running past your house,

648
00:57:20,348 --> 00:57:24,217
and I saw you in your bedroom window.

649
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:28,488
Uh, at least I think
it was your bedroom.

650
00:57:30,024 --> 00:57:33,426
I think... I think you saw me too.

651
00:57:34,695 --> 00:57:37,397
You know, neither of us waved.

652
00:57:37,399 --> 00:57:40,132
Tell me again.

653
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:47,105
What was I wearing?

654
00:57:48,776 --> 00:57:51,676
Did I look happy or...

655
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:54,112
Or sad?

656
00:57:55,381 --> 00:57:57,716
You didn't look sad.

657
00:58:11,298 --> 00:58:12,330
What the hell?

658
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:15,368
It's them.

659
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:19,305
Who?

660
00:58:19,307 --> 00:58:21,741
Her parents.

661
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:27,112
What is she doing?

662
00:58:27,114 --> 00:58:30,282
What she does every morning.

663
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,255
She kills them.

664
00:58:39,092 --> 00:58:41,726
Let's go.

665
00:58:46,299 --> 00:58:48,834
This wasn't a good idea, like...

666
00:58:48,836 --> 00:58:52,337
We can go somewhere else.

667
00:59:04,517 --> 00:59:07,486
Why does she do it?

668
00:59:07,488 --> 00:59:10,155
It's her thing, Adam.

669
00:59:10,157 --> 00:59:13,693
Leave it be.

670
00:59:13,695 --> 00:59:16,828
Let's go, let's go.

671
00:59:17,563 --> 00:59:22,134
Adam, let's just go.

672
00:59:22,136 --> 00:59:25,270
Let's go.

673
00:59:39,486 --> 00:59:42,554
Oh, my God.

674
00:59:49,395 --> 00:59:52,697
Enjoy the show, bitch-boy?

675
00:59:55,736 --> 00:59:58,703
What the hell's wrong with you?

676
00:59:58,705 --> 01:00:01,740
That's what I want to know.

677
01:00:01,742 --> 01:00:03,542
Nothing's wrong with me.

678
01:00:03,544 --> 01:00:04,242
Oh, yeah?

679
01:00:04,244 --> 01:00:05,610
Why do you and your dead boyfriend

680
01:00:05,612 --> 01:00:09,681
have to hang out in my barn?

681
01:00:10,716 --> 01:00:13,952
- Let's go.
- You psycho.

682
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:20,659
I'm so sorry, man.

683
01:00:20,661 --> 01:00:21,960
I never should have brought you here.

684
01:00:21,962 --> 01:00:23,460
She promised me she wouldn't do this.

685
01:00:23,462 --> 01:00:24,930
You can't handle real life?

686
01:00:24,932 --> 01:00:27,599
You don't have the guts to be like us.

687
01:00:27,601 --> 01:00:28,733
Frances, stop!

688
01:00:28,735 --> 01:00:30,936
You don't know anything.

689
01:00:30,938 --> 01:00:33,604
Is bitch-boy gonna cry?

690
01:00:33,606 --> 01:00:35,807
Cry like a baby!

691
01:00:35,809 --> 01:00:37,508
Or do you only do that for Jamie?

692
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,777
Don't listen to her, Adam.

693
01:00:38,779 --> 01:00:40,911
- Is that it?
- Shut up.

694
01:00:40,913 --> 01:00:42,214
Adam, let's go.

695
01:00:42,216 --> 01:00:43,515
You just can't stand the heat.

696
01:00:43,517 --> 01:00:45,516
Maybe you should take
your dead boyfriend

697
01:00:45,518 --> 01:00:49,588
and get out of the fucking kitchen!

698
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:52,356
Adam, let's go, please!

699
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:54,259
I'll show you heat.

700
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:55,626
Adam, what are you doing?!

701
01:00:55,628 --> 01:00:57,362
- Fuck you, Frances!
- No!

702
01:00:57,364 --> 01:00:58,929
We don't need your shit!

703
01:00:58,931 --> 01:01:02,566
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

704
01:01:02,568 --> 01:01:03,968
Oh, my God.

705
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,370
You shouldn't have done this, Adam.

706
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:07,471
What did you do?

707
01:01:07,473 --> 01:01:09,274
You shouldn't have done this.

708
01:01:09,276 --> 01:01:10,407
This is mine!

709
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:12,444
This is my house!

710
01:01:12,446 --> 01:01:16,348
No, no, no, no, no!

711
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:18,916
No, no!

712
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:22,854
You motherfucking cocksucker!

713
01:01:22,856 --> 01:01:24,788
You're a fucking cocksucker!

714
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,791
This is mine!

715
01:01:26,793 --> 01:01:28,525
Mine!

716
01:01:28,527 --> 01:01:30,895
No, no!

717
01:01:40,705 --> 01:01:43,407
Run!

718
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:44,976
Go!

719
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,422
Go, Adam, go!

720
01:01:58,424 --> 01:02:00,491
Jamie!

721
01:02:00,493 --> 01:02:04,328
Get off me!

722
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,964
Get out of here!

723
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:47,604
Are you okay, kid?

724
01:02:47,606 --> 01:02:49,073
How much?

725
01:02:49,075 --> 01:02:51,809
Three dollars.

726
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:05,089
Change?

727
01:03:05,091 --> 01:03:07,591
No.

728
01:03:29,381 --> 01:03:32,516
<i>Hello?</i>

729
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:36,487
<i>- Hi.
- Adam?</i>

730
01:03:36,489 --> 01:03:38,788
<i>What's going on?</i>

731
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:42,558
I burned down the Wilkinson farm.

732
01:03:45,163 --> 01:03:47,164
<i>Where are you?</i>

733
01:03:47,166 --> 01:03:50,566
Behind the old Apollo.

734
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:53,169
<i>How glamorous.</i>

735
01:03:53,171 --> 01:03:56,073
<i>Is he there with you?</i>

736
01:03:56,075 --> 01:03:58,709
No.

737
01:03:58,711 --> 01:04:00,743
He's mad at me.

738
01:04:00,745 --> 01:04:03,614
I don't know where he is.

739
01:04:03,616 --> 01:04:06,417
<i>Are you lying to me?</i>

740
01:04:07,451 --> 01:04:09,953
No, Gracie, I'm not lying to you.

741
01:04:09,955 --> 01:04:11,521
I don't know where he is.

742
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:12,990
Look...

743
01:04:12,992 --> 01:04:13,824
I think I have to go.

744
01:04:13,826 --> 01:04:15,892
<i>Adam, don't go anywhere, okay?</i>

745
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,561
<i>I'll be there as soon as...
No, Gracie, listen to me,</i>

746
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,698
<i>you can't...</i>

747
01:04:40,717 --> 01:04:43,753
I'm not mad at you, Adam.

748
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:49,692
I'm just disappointed.

749
01:04:52,963 --> 01:04:55,832
You shouldn't have done that.

750
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:58,201
You had no right.

751
01:04:59,837 --> 01:05:01,838
I know.

752
01:05:03,607 --> 01:05:06,142
I'm sorry.

753
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:14,517
You wouldn't do anything
like that to me, would you?

754
01:05:21,892 --> 01:05:24,694
Of course you wouldn't.

755
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:05,660
Why were you running away from me?

756
01:07:05,662 --> 01:07:06,895
I wasn't running away from you,

757
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:11,000
I was just... I was just running.

758
01:07:17,506 --> 01:07:20,041
What was that place?

759
01:07:20,642 --> 01:07:23,844
Were those people all dead?

760
01:07:25,447 --> 01:07:28,583
Don't worry about them, Adam.

761
01:07:32,521 --> 01:07:33,589
If I could see them,

762
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:36,992
does that mean they could see me?

763
01:07:36,994 --> 01:07:38,459
Huh?

764
01:07:38,461 --> 01:07:41,896
I would never let them hurt you, Adam.

765
01:07:49,471 --> 01:07:51,706
Come on.

766
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:54,542
I'll make you a fire.

767
01:08:29,344 --> 01:08:32,980
Jamie, where's Frances?

768
01:08:36,785 --> 01:08:39,854
Don't worry about her.

769
01:08:41,757 --> 01:08:44,659
I'm protecting you.

770
01:09:40,082 --> 01:09:43,484
Are you okay?

771
01:09:48,923 --> 01:09:52,126
Maybe you should just come home.

772
01:09:53,794 --> 01:09:54,662
No.

773
01:09:54,664 --> 01:09:58,399
You can't just hide out forever.

774
01:10:04,071 --> 01:10:06,741
I know that.

775
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:17,784
What was she like?

776
01:10:17,786 --> 01:10:20,054
Awful.

777
01:10:20,455 --> 01:10:24,091
Her parents were there too.

778
01:10:24,093 --> 01:10:25,992
She'd kill them...

779
01:10:25,994 --> 01:10:30,730
Every morning, over and over.

780
01:10:30,732 --> 01:10:31,632
Poor thing.

781
01:10:31,634 --> 01:10:33,466
She's not a poor thing!

782
01:10:33,468 --> 01:10:37,537
She's a fucking psychopath
bitch that attacked me.

783
01:10:37,539 --> 01:10:41,007
Don't get all compassionate
all of a sudden.

784
01:10:41,009 --> 01:10:42,843
It's why we're here in the first place.

785
01:10:42,845 --> 01:10:45,111
Yeah, well, I would be a bitch too

786
01:10:45,113 --> 01:10:48,181
if I had to kill my
parents over and over again

787
01:10:48,183 --> 01:10:51,584
every morning for all of eternity.

788
01:10:59,493 --> 01:11:01,628
You know, none of this
would have ever happened

789
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:02,829
if you had just listened to me

790
01:11:02,831 --> 01:11:06,900
and stayed the fuck
away from Mooney Marks.

791
01:11:17,211 --> 01:11:18,077
I really should go.

792
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:20,613
I don't want you to get in
any more trouble than you are.

793
01:11:20,615 --> 01:11:23,650
But this... it's fine, Adam.

794
01:11:23,652 --> 01:11:26,619
I brought you some things.

795
01:11:26,621 --> 01:11:30,523
Just a pillow, some food.

796
01:11:32,593 --> 01:11:34,527
You didn't have to.

797
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:37,130
I know.

798
01:11:37,132 --> 01:11:39,699
Adam?

799
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:46,940
I think that I love you.

800
01:11:46,942 --> 01:11:50,810
And I just wanted you to know that.

801
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:58,685
Thanks.

802
01:12:26,213 --> 01:12:28,647
I like it here.

803
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:31,284
Just me and you.

804
01:12:31,752 --> 01:12:34,954
We could stay like this forever.

805
01:13:30,009 --> 01:13:33,246
Come here.

806
01:13:42,055 --> 01:13:45,857
Don't you ever do that again.

807
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:07,980
<i>...The tropical and pristine</i>

808
01:14:07,982 --> 01:14:09,081

809
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:10,182
<i>Wow!</i>

810
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:11,650
<i>A visit to this tiny country</i>

811
01:14:11,652 --> 01:14:13,785
<i>at the northern tip of Central America</i>

812
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:16,789

813
01:14:16,791 --> 01:14:18,790
<i>You'll see ancient Mayan ruins,</i>

<i>second only in size to the
great pyramids of Egypt.</i>

815
01:14:22,096 --> 01:14:23,662
<i>Or spend the day island hopping.</i>

816
01:14:23,664 --> 01:14:24,296
Mom?

817
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:28,033
<i>On one of the hundreds of
tiny tropical islands...</i>

818
01:14:30,938 --> 01:14:32,404

01:14:32,406 --> 01:14:35,874

820
01:14:35,876 --> 01:14:36,408
<i>Absolutely.</i>

821
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:38,377
<i>It's really a spectacular trip.</i>

822
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:40,312

823
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:43,682

<i>Roatan Island, Honduras.</i>

827
01:14:48,222 --> 01:14:49,054
<i>Oh, it is, Janet.</i>

828
01:14:49,056 --> 01:14:52,357
<i>This is truly one of the most

829
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:53,692

830
01:14:53,694 --> 01:14:54,393
Jamie?

831
01:14:57,030 --> 01:14:58,196
Jamie, is that you?

832
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:02,034
You wish.

833
01:15:02,036 --> 01:15:02,934
Frances.

834
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:10,208
Don't be scared.

835
01:15:12,345 --> 01:15:14,913
What do you want? You owe me, Adam.

836
01:15:17,685 --> 01:15:20,886
It was an accident, Frances.

837
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:21,353
I swear.

838
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:23,889
And if you think for a second...

839
01:15:24,425 --> 01:15:26,123
...I'm letting you get away with it,

840
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:30,829
then you're really as
pathetic as I thought you were.

841
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:39,171
Maybe I'll burn down your house.

842
01:15:39,173 --> 01:15:40,238
Burn your mom

843
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:45,477
as she tries to climb out
of the bed into the chair.

844
01:15:52,284 --> 01:15:56,988
You're not so brave
without your little boy-toy.

845
01:16:10,769 --> 01:16:13,104
Adam...

846
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:20,178
Open the door.

847
01:16:30,356 --> 01:16:31,489
Adam...

848
01:16:31,491 --> 01:16:34,792
Open the door.

849
01:16:43,535 --> 01:16:46,036
Open the door!

850
01:16:47,373 --> 01:16:51,208
- Shit.
- Open the door, Adam!

851
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:16,233
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie!

852
01:17:44,896 --> 01:17:46,997
Oh, how nice.

853
01:17:46,999 --> 01:17:51,135
Your dead boyfriend to the rescue.

854
01:17:52,204 --> 01:17:55,539
He thinks you're gonna save him.

855
01:17:55,541 --> 01:18:00,444
Did you not forget he's
more like me than you?

856
01:18:00,446 --> 01:18:03,047
Leave him alone.

857
01:18:03,049 --> 01:18:06,383
He's not yours.

858
01:18:06,385 --> 01:18:09,185
So he's yours?

859
01:18:10,255 --> 01:18:14,058
Adam?

860
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,292
I'm his.

861
01:18:15,294 --> 01:18:18,929
You little bitch-boy.

862
01:18:21,399 --> 01:18:24,635
Just give me the knife.

863
01:18:24,637 --> 01:18:26,470
You can't stay here.

864
01:18:26,472 --> 01:18:28,072
Says who?

865
01:18:28,074 --> 01:18:29,273
It's just done, you know that.

866
01:18:29,275 --> 01:18:31,274
Don't tell me what I know!

867
01:18:31,276 --> 01:18:32,610
I know a fuck a lot more than you,

868
01:18:32,612 --> 01:18:36,480
and if he hadn't come,
I wouldn't be here.

869
01:18:36,482 --> 01:18:39,984
It doesn't change anything.

870
01:18:41,986 --> 01:18:45,222
You still have to go.

871
01:19:05,577 --> 01:19:09,513
I'm so... Jamie, I'm sorry.

872
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:17,321
It's okay.

873
01:19:19,925 --> 01:19:22,358
I'll take you home.

874
01:19:26,931 --> 01:19:30,266
Get out of there, Adam.

875
01:20:46,443 --> 01:20:47,610
You know you're lucky

876
01:20:47,612 --> 01:20:51,581
I didn't let her rip your heart out.

877
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:53,016
That's what she wanted to do.

878
01:20:53,018 --> 01:20:55,318
Stop sneaking up on me like that.

879
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,121
Don't snap at me.

880
01:20:58,123 --> 01:21:01,657
I'm not snapping.

881
01:21:01,659 --> 01:21:04,494
Where did you take her?

882
01:21:04,496 --> 01:21:06,795
Doesn't matter.

883
01:21:08,665 --> 01:21:11,768
Was it to that tunnel?

884
01:21:16,373 --> 01:21:20,109
What happens if you don't go?

885
01:21:22,713 --> 01:21:26,482
I would never do that to you, Adam.

886
01:21:27,418 --> 01:21:32,187
Not now that we've found each other.

887
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:13,095
Can I have some more, Adam?

888
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:19,367
More what?

889
01:22:22,539 --> 01:22:25,208
Words.

890
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:47,130
Close your eyes.

891
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:03,745
I'm ready.

892
01:23:08,784 --> 01:23:10,418
Butterfly.

893
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,920
In my mouth.

894
01:23:11,922 --> 01:23:15,257
Say them in my mouth.

895
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:27,169
Butterfly.

896
01:23:27,171 --> 01:23:29,671
More.

897
01:23:29,673 --> 01:23:31,306
Pollywog.

898
01:23:31,308 --> 01:23:32,274
Popsicle.

899
01:23:32,276 --> 01:23:35,610
Sunflower.

900
01:23:50,426 --> 01:23:53,695
You still see me, Adam, don't you?

901
01:23:58,301 --> 01:23:58,934
I still see you.

902
01:23:58,936 --> 01:24:03,305
Who the fuck are you talking to?

903
01:24:03,307 --> 01:24:05,473
No one.

904
01:24:05,475 --> 01:24:09,477
You really are bat-shit crazy, huh?

905
01:24:09,479 --> 01:24:12,247
Looks like you're famous.

906
01:24:12,249 --> 01:24:15,516
For being a freak.

907
01:24:25,695 --> 01:24:29,598
You look happy in that picture.

908
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,334
Why don't you look happy now?

909
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:40,774
You're not gonna leave
me, Adam, are you?

910
01:24:41,978 --> 01:24:45,012
Not like everyone else.

911
01:24:48,617 --> 01:24:52,453
Promise... promise me.

912
01:24:56,726 --> 01:24:59,860
I need you to say it.

913
01:25:02,964 --> 01:25:05,800
I promise.

914
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:24,685
What time is it?

915
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:27,622
Can we talk, please?

916
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:36,330
My parents caught me
sneaking out to see you,

917
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:39,600
and I didn't know what else to do.

918
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:43,671
I'm sorry about earlier.

919
01:25:43,673 --> 01:25:46,440
About everything.

920
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:52,480
I didn't tell them about the fire.

921
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:57,885
I thought I could fix things.

922
01:25:57,887 --> 01:25:59,621
You know, make it better somehow.

923
01:25:59,623 --> 01:26:00,587
I... I should've listened.

924
01:26:00,589 --> 01:26:03,057
I should've, but everything's
just getting worse.

925
01:26:03,059 --> 01:26:04,658
Hey.

926
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,026
I don't know what to do.

927
01:26:06,028 --> 01:26:07,728
Adam.

928
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:11,665
I have something you should see.

929
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:29,583
What is this?

930
01:26:29,585 --> 01:26:32,386
Just read it.

931
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:38,592
"Things I'd like to kill.

932
01:26:38,594 --> 01:26:39,693
"My mother's ceramic nativity

933
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:42,496
"that she keeps out
all fucking year long,

934
01:26:42,498 --> 01:26:45,499
Artie Chapman's plastered on smile. "

935
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:47,634
Where'd you find this?

936
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:50,771
He had it when I found him.

937
01:26:50,773 --> 01:26:51,638
Just keep reading.

938
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,807
"My father, wherever he is,

939
01:26:53,809 --> 01:26:57,044
"Matt Harden and the
entire varsity team,

01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:58,578
"except for...

941
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:02,449
Adam McCormick, of course. "

942
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,425
"Myself. "

943
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:19,867
Who else has seen this?

944
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:21,869
No one.

945
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:24,705
Why not?

946
01:27:24,707 --> 01:27:25,139
'Cause...

947
01:27:25,141 --> 01:27:29,877
Adam, do you think that
anyone would have thought twice

948
01:27:29,879 --> 01:27:31,611
about the way they treated him

949
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:33,647
if they never had to think
that it might have been

950
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:36,884
one of us who killed him?

951
01:27:45,193 --> 01:27:48,729
They did kill him.

952
01:27:48,731 --> 01:27:50,831
Exactly.

953
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:55,169
Now do you understand...

954
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,139
I was only trying to help?

955
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,676
Who says I need fixing?

956
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:10,050
Jamie, what is this?

957
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:13,220
That's mine.

958
01:28:13,222 --> 01:28:14,054
She had no right!

959
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:15,521
I didn't mean to take it.

960
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:17,925
- I didn't... I found it.
- Ssh!

961
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,997
Really doesn't matter,
Adam, not anymore.

962
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:29,869
Don't you see, we can make this work.

963
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:32,473
Make what work?

964
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:40,213
This.

965
01:28:40,215 --> 01:28:43,050
Me and you.

966
01:28:43,052 --> 01:28:44,617
Well, we can't... I can't.

967
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:49,055
Don't listen to her, Adam!

968
01:28:49,057 --> 01:28:50,890
She's just jealous.

969
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:51,557
Jealous.

970
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:55,895
Jamie, listen to me,
you gotta calm down.

971
01:28:59,533 --> 01:29:03,736
You have to go.

972
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:04,872
Just drop it.

973
01:29:04,874 --> 01:29:05,972
Drop the whole thing.

974
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:08,141
I will not drop it!

975
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:10,009
And you're right, I don't understand.

976
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:12,512
But I know that I can't
change what happened to you...

977
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:15,716
You don't know anything about...

978
01:29:21,555 --> 01:29:24,690
Just come home.

979
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:27,093
Come home, Adam.

980
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:27,693
We can...

981
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,629
Stop telling me what to do!

982
01:29:29,631 --> 01:29:31,264
Stop hanging around my closet,

983
01:29:31,266 --> 01:29:33,132
and stop taking my words!

984
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:34,067
Jamie, Adam can't fix...

985
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:35,134
This has nothing to do with you!

986
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:36,202
What happened to you was awful,

987
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:39,739
but that does not mean you
can come into our lives...

988
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:44,777
Stop it!

989
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:47,046
Jamie, Jamie!

990
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:48,780
Listen to me!

991
01:29:48,782 --> 01:29:52,118
Is this how you want me to remember you?

992
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,986
Look at me.

993
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:56,923
'Cause that's not what I want.

994
01:29:59,859 --> 01:30:03,328
You don't know what you did.

995
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:06,065
You didn't do it.

996
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,600
Let me go.

997
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:10,002
Leave me alone!

998
01:30:28,921 --> 01:30:32,324
Do you want me to come with you?

999
01:30:46,872 --> 01:30:50,809
♪♪

1000
01:31:18,805 --> 01:31:22,708
You don't have to go there alone.

1001
01:31:44,964 --> 01:31:48,667
Thanks for coming, Gracie.

1002
01:31:50,002 --> 01:31:51,871
And...

1003
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:55,774
I'm sorry about your rock collection.

1004
01:31:57,910 --> 01:32:01,079
It wasn't really mine anyways.

1005
01:32:01,814 --> 01:32:05,083
I'm sorry that I took your list.

1006
01:32:07,319 --> 01:32:10,022
That's okay.

1007
01:32:23,436 --> 01:32:26,404
Let's go.

1008
01:33:04,043 --> 01:33:08,145
You don't have to wait, Gracie.

1009
01:33:08,147 --> 01:33:09,314
Are you sure?

1010
01:33:09,316 --> 01:33:12,182
How will you get home?

1011
01:33:12,184 --> 01:33:14,252
I'm sure.

1012
01:33:46,085 --> 01:33:49,253
You could come with me.

1013
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:57,162
Hey.

1014
01:34:00,966 --> 01:34:04,969
Everything's gonna be all right.

1015
01:34:04,971 --> 01:34:07,137
I know, I know.

1016
01:34:07,139 --> 01:34:10,140
I'll see you again.

1017
01:34:16,315 --> 01:34:20,984
You'll be fine too, you know?

1018
01:34:20,986 --> 01:34:22,452
Yeah, I know.

1019
01:34:24,489 --> 01:34:27,991
I got something for you.

1020
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,100
Love.

1021
01:34:50,348 --> 01:34:54,051
Tell that to Gracie for me too, okay?

1022
01:34:56,188 --> 01:34:58,322
I will.

1023
01:35:13,071 --> 01:35:15,572
Here.

1024
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:21,478
Remember me.

1025
01:35:30,922 --> 01:35:33,991
I'm glad it was you, Adam.

1026
01:35:37,428 --> 01:35:40,397
Me too, Jamie.

1027
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,468
Me too.
