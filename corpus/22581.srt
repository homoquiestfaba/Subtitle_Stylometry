01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:10,140
know your arms
are open wide

1321
01:20:10,249 --> 01:20:13,019
But you're a little
on the strange side

1322
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:17,002
I can't lie

1323
01:20:17,106 --> 01:20:21,987
our one vice
is you're too nice

1324
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:26,127
Come around, now
Can't you see

1325
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:30,206
I want you
all tattooed

1326
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:35,064
I want you bad

1327
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:39,674
Complete me
Mistreat me

1328
01:20:39,785 --> 01:20:43,754
I want you to be
bad, bad, bad

1329
01:20:43,866 --> 01:20:45,930
Bad, bad

1330
01:20:48,917 --> 01:20:51,255
If you could only
read my mind

1331
01:20:51,358 --> 01:20:54,632
You would know
that I've been waiting

1332
01:20:54,737 --> 01:20:57,303
So long

1333
01:20:57,414 --> 01:21:00,619
or someone almost
just like you

1334
01:21:00,725 --> 01:21:03,496
But with attitude
I've waited

1335
01:21:03,602 --> 01:21:06,841
So come on

1336
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:11,657
Get out at close time
Pullout those highlights

1337
01:21:11,763 --> 01:21:16,212
Come around, now
Can you see

1338
01:21:16,313 --> 01:21:20,727
I want you
in a vinyl suit

1339
01:21:20,828 --> 01:21:23,565
I want you bad

1340
01:21:23,672 --> 01:21:26,546
Bad, bad
[Jim]
Oh, no.

1341
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:28,656
Oh, my God.
You still broken?

1342
01:21:28,656 --> 01:21:29,420
Oh, my God.
You still broken?

1343
01:21:29,526 --> 01:21:31,499
No.

1344
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,596
I'm fine.

1345
01:21:33,707 --> 01:21:36,946
I might have to...
actually go through with this.

1346
01:21:39,059 --> 01:21:42,799
Jim, what's the big deal
with Nadia, anyway?

1347
01:21:42,905 --> 01:21:46,817
I mean, okay, so she's
50,000 times hotter...

1348
01:21:46,919 --> 01:21:48,824
than most girls, but...

1349
01:21:48,926 --> 01:21:51,025
come on,
it's just sex.

1350
01:21:51,135 --> 01:21:53,040
Oh, no.

1351
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:55,582
You saw the thing
on the lnternet.

1352
01:21:55,684 --> 01:21:57,851
Did it look like
I might have had...

1353
01:21:57,958 --> 01:22:00,489
a slight interest
in Nadia then?

1354
01:22:02,274 --> 01:22:04,179
Add another year to that.

1355
01:22:04,281 --> 01:22:06,447
Okay.

1356
01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:11,973
Hey, why don't you bring
Nadia to the concert first?
It'll be a cool date.

1357
01:22:12,074 --> 01:22:14,914
We'll see how things go.

1358
01:22:19,835 --> 01:22:23,838
Michelle,
you have been great.

1359
01:22:23,949 --> 01:22:25,854
Thank you.

1360
01:22:25,956 --> 01:22:28,328
Anytime.

1361
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:36,224
Come on.

1362
01:22:39,336 --> 01:22:41,537
You ready to break up?

1363
01:22:41,644 --> 01:22:44,016
You big, stupid dummy!

1364
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:46,320
Theatre is so cool!

1365
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:49,770
[Michelle]
I don't care if you are the best
lay I've ever had in my life.

1366
01:22:49,874 --> 01:22:53,010
I hate your guts anyway.
Don't say that.

1367
01:22:53,118 --> 01:22:58,194
And I don't care
if you did give me
ten orgasms in a row,

1368
01:22:58,303 --> 01:23:01,542
because you smell
really bad.

1369
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:04,648
No! I smell
really bad!

1370
01:23:04,759 --> 01:23:08,260
Because we've been having
so much sex, and--

1371
01:23:08,371 --> 01:23:11,872
and I haven't showered,
and I wanna shower!

1372
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:17,401
So, don't you go being all
super-sexy guy anymore,

1373
01:23:17,503 --> 01:23:20,206
because I am now
impervious...

1374
01:23:20,313 --> 01:23:23,758
to your unrelenting machismo
and sexual ardor.

1375
01:23:23,859 --> 01:23:27,930
And that includes
fucking me in the ass!
So there!

1376
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:37,731
We had
something special.

1377
01:23:55,871 --> 01:23:57,776
[Car Engine Starts]

1378
01:24:14,335 --> 01:24:16,741
What's up?
What's up, dog?

1379
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:19,445
[Rock, indistinct]

1380
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:21,618
Vicky. Hey.
Hey.

1381
01:24:21,728 --> 01:24:25,103
I'm so glad you came.
You want something
to drink or--
Hey.

1382
01:24:25,207 --> 01:24:28,343
Can I help you?

1383
01:24:28,451 --> 01:24:31,154
Kevin.
That's my date.
What?

1384
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:49,050
You-- You saved them all.

1385
01:24:49,157 --> 01:24:51,792
How sweet.

1386
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,805
You don't think
I'm a dork?

1387
01:24:56,684 --> 01:25:01,064
Whatever you are, Jim,
it is what I like.

1388
01:25:02,939 --> 01:25:04,935
Kevin left.
Didn't look good.

1389
01:25:05,046 --> 01:25:07,076
Kevin left?

1390
01:25:07,187 --> 01:25:09,856
Just wandered
down the beach.

1391
01:25:13,877 --> 01:25:15,975
You okay, Kev?

1392
01:25:19,062 --> 01:25:20,898
Wanna tell us
what's up?

1393
01:25:22,641 --> 01:25:25,812
Wanna feel Finch's ass?

1394
01:25:28,428 --> 01:25:31,804
No, l-- I went
to say hi to Vicky,

1395
01:25:31,907 --> 01:25:34,712
and she was there
with a date.

1396
01:25:34,817 --> 01:25:37,349
You hooked up with
three girls this year.
You're doing fine.

1397
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:40,129
Rule of three, Oz.

1398
01:25:45,554 --> 01:25:48,359
I guess I was living in the past--
wanting to party with you guys...

1399
01:25:48,465 --> 01:25:50,962
and be with Vicky,
it's just like high school.

1400
01:25:51,074 --> 01:25:53,571
You remember
that day after prom?

1401
01:25:53,683 --> 01:25:56,420
You know, we made
a toast to the next step.

1402
01:25:57,764 --> 01:26:00,364
I guess I never took it.

1403
01:26:02,614 --> 01:26:05,989
My brother said that
by the end of the summer
I'd see the big picture.

1404
01:26:06,093 --> 01:26:08,066
And I see it.

1405
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:11,805
No matter what, times change
and things are different.

1406
01:26:11,913 --> 01:26:15,358
The problem is,
I don't want them to be.

1407
01:26:15,459 --> 01:26:17,523
You know, Kevin,
I haven't moved on either.

1408
01:26:17,634 --> 01:26:22,014
I've been obsessed
with the one woman I can't
have a real future with,

1409
01:26:22,116 --> 01:26:26,119
other than a very kinky,
extremely warped one.

1410
01:26:27,602 --> 01:26:29,871
I gotta find
a new goddess.

1411
01:26:31,415 --> 01:26:34,791
It's gonna take patience,
but I've been celibate all summer.

1412
01:26:34,894 --> 01:26:37,391
Yeah, you kinda get
used to it, though, huh?

1413
01:26:37,503 --> 01:26:40,674
Are you insane?

1414
01:26:40,781 --> 01:26:45,595
Hey, look, Kev,
different does not
necessarily mean worse.

1415
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:48,943
As a matter of fact,
I think things are
just getting better.

1416
01:26:49,043 --> 01:26:52,214
Or am I gonna have to drag
your ass back to that party
and prove it to you?

1417
01:26:52,321 --> 01:26:54,693
I'll walk.

1418
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:02,252
[Rock]

1419
01:27:09,682 --> 01:27:11,917
Wow!

1420
01:27:12,024 --> 01:27:15,125
You know, you have
beautiful eyes.

1421
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:19,306
- Oh, you're sweet.
- That's a really nice top.

1422
01:27:19,416 --> 01:27:22,826
Oh. Thanks.
You're welcome.

1423
01:27:22,929 --> 01:27:26,168
- Wanna fuck?
- Are you serious?

1424
01:27:26,273 --> 01:27:29,409
Come on, baby.
Give it to the Stifmeister.

1425
01:27:29,518 --> 01:27:32,187
- I think you better--
- Your loss.

1426
01:27:32,294 --> 01:27:35,568
Wow. You know,
you have beautiful eyes.

1427
01:27:35,673 --> 01:27:39,209
Come here, dude.
Come on. You're making
an ass out of your self.

1428
01:27:39,319 --> 01:27:42,728
You're ruining my mojo.
And you're not
the Stifmeister, okay?

1429
01:27:42,832 --> 01:27:45,204
It takes years to develop
true Stifmeister style.

1430
01:27:45,307 --> 01:27:48,614
Come on, man!
I just wanna see some boobs.

1431
01:27:48,718 --> 01:27:50,623
Hey, Pop-Tart.
Dream on, midget.

1432
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:54,033
Excuse him. Come here.
Take this. You're on cop watch.

1433
01:27:54,138 --> 01:27:56,476
Go out in the driveway.
See any cops, call me, okay?

1434
01:27:56,579 --> 01:27:58,849
Steve--
All right.

1435
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:12,959
Gentlemen, uh,
this appears to be a party.

1436
01:28:15,913 --> 01:28:19,380
Guys, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go look for Nadia.

1437
01:28:19,493 --> 01:28:21,763
Good luck.

1438
01:28:21,868 --> 01:28:24,172
Ahh.

1439
01:28:24,276 --> 01:28:26,911
[Jim]
So what was this year
like for you?

1440
01:28:27,019 --> 01:28:29,220
Did you miss high school?

1441
01:28:29,327 --> 01:28:32,931
Well, no. When you travel
as much as I do,

1442
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,074
you get used to
moving on.

1443
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:38,854
But I have great memories.

1444
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:45,473
- Wow, can we go in there?
- The lighthouse?

1445
01:28:45,585 --> 01:28:48,356
Yeah.

1446
01:28:48,461 --> 01:28:50,559
Yes.

1447
01:28:50,668 --> 01:28:52,573
Yes, we can.

1448
01:28:52,675 --> 01:28:54,580
How romantic.

1449
01:28:57,024 --> 01:28:59,659
Jim, come on.

1450
01:29:09,903 --> 01:29:13,814
Wow!
Wow!

1451
01:29:15,355 --> 01:29:18,560
Oh, it's beautiful!

1452
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:20,571
Cool!

1453
01:29:22,982 --> 01:29:27,362
Jim, I have told you my
memories from high school.

1454
01:29:27,464 --> 01:29:29,369
What are yours?

1455
01:29:29,471 --> 01:29:31,410
Oh, uh--

1456
01:29:31,512 --> 01:29:36,017
Well, uh, you.

1457
01:29:36,128 --> 01:29:38,364
You have not changed.

1458
01:29:42,818 --> 01:29:45,794
Jim, relax.

1459
01:29:45,896 --> 01:29:50,537
We are just,
how do you say,
tooting our horns.

1460
01:29:50,645 --> 01:29:53,679
Actually, that is
quite difficult.

1461
01:29:53,789 --> 01:29:55,785
How do you mean?

1462
01:29:55,897 --> 01:29:59,136
Well, this one time
at band camp,

1463
01:29:59,242 --> 01:30:01,147
I--

1464
01:30:04,594 --> 01:30:06,898
Holy shit.

1465
01:30:08,006 --> 01:30:10,138
What? Tell me.

1466
01:30:10,247 --> 01:30:12,243
Uh, well, uh,

1467
01:30:12,355 --> 01:30:15,388
this one time
at band camp,

1468
01:30:15,499 --> 01:30:18,304
I got stuck
playing this trombone.

1469
01:30:18,409 --> 01:30:21,545
And I can't play
anything at all.
So I totally sucked.

1470
01:30:21,654 --> 01:30:23,593
And everyone thought
I was this Petey guy,

1471
01:30:23,694 --> 01:30:26,636
but I didn't know
what to think, so I just
kept playing and playing,

1472
01:30:26,738 --> 01:30:28,643
and I didn't know
what I was doing.

1473
01:30:28,745 --> 01:30:31,778
It was so funny!
[ Chuckling ]

1474
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:35,163
I gotta go.
What? Why?

1475
01:30:35,268 --> 01:30:37,606
Nadia,

1476
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:39,808
please don't take this
the wrong way,

1477
01:30:39,918 --> 01:30:42,358
but, but you're--

1478
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:45,528
you're everything
that I used to want.

1479
01:30:45,638 --> 01:30:48,706
And as much
as I may really,

1480
01:30:48,815 --> 01:30:52,693
really regret
what I'm about to do,

1481
01:30:53,934 --> 01:30:55,907
there's somebody else
I want to be with.

1482
01:30:56,007 --> 01:30:59,075
You-You want
the band geek?

1483
01:30:59,185 --> 01:31:03,199
Nadia, I am a band geek.

1484
01:31:04,771 --> 01:31:07,542
I just never
joined the band.

1485
01:31:11,695 --> 01:31:14,033
You go get your geek.

1486
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:17,745
Someday I will find mine.

1487
01:31:17,851 --> 01:31:20,587
Well, my mind is now
play in' tricks on me

1488
01:31:20,694 --> 01:31:23,168
And the world is crashin'

1489

01:43:19,207 --> 01:43:21,704
Ah. What are you
worried about?
You got a girlfriend now.

1657
01:43:21,816 --> 01:43:23,589
Everything in.
Let's go. Pony up.
Dog Years awaits.

1658
01:43:23,589 --> 01:43:24,923
Everything in.
Let's go. Pony up.
Dog Years awaits.

1659
01:43:25,028 --> 01:43:28,061
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, I do.

1660
01:43:28,172 --> 01:43:30,236
I have
a girlfriend now.
Yeah, you do.

1661
01:43:30,346 --> 01:43:32,786
She's my girlfriend.
All right, Jimbo.

1662
01:43:32,888 --> 01:43:34,793
Let's go! Let's go!

1663
01:43:34,895 --> 01:43:37,096
Hey, where's Shitbrick?
The movies.
Took the bus.

1664
01:43:37,203 --> 01:43:39,974
Coffee.
Wait a second.

1665
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,281
Who the fuck
was in that car?

1666
01:43:42,388 --> 01:43:45,023
And here's to you
Mrs. Robinson

1667
01:43:45,131 --> 01:43:47,902
Jesus loves you more
than you will know

1668
01:43:48,008 --> 01:43:49,913
[ Finch Moaning ]

1669
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:53,192
[ Mrs. Stifler ]
Oh, Finchy, I missed you.

1670
01:43:53,327 --> 01:43:57,934
Yeah. Oh, God.
Jeanine. Jeanine.
Call me Stifler's mom.

1671
01:43:58,043 --> 01:44:00,244
[ Loud Moaning ]
[ Car Alarm Blaring ]

1672
01:44:00,351 --> 01:44:00,552
[ Shouting ]
Oh, Stifler's mom!

1673
01:44:00,552 --> 01:44:03,619
[ Shouting ]
Oh, Stifler's mom!

1674
01:44:10,018 --> 01:44:13,759
I don't want to be
an ass anymore

1675
01:44:13,865 --> 01:44:16,602
Sick and tired
of all the promises

1676
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:19,012
That I made to you

1677
01:44:20,522 --> 01:44:22,996
And I pray to you

1678
01:44:25,406 --> 01:44:29,181
And I know you think
you've heard it all before

1679
01:44:29,285 --> 01:44:32,194
Something tells me
that you think I'm stupid

1680
01:44:32,296 --> 01:44:34,702
When I say to you

1681
01:44:36,042 --> 01:44:39,247
That what I say is true

1682
01:44:40,492 --> 01:44:44,734
Too much lyin'
Too little tryin'

1683
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:48,877
This time it's gonna be
the last time

1684
01:44:48,988 --> 01:44:52,397
say the last time again

1685
01:44:52,501 --> 01:44:55,967
This time is gonna be
the last time

1686
01:44:56,080 --> 01:45:00,220
What I say
The last time again

1687
01:45:07,754 --> 01:45:11,494
don't want to be
redundant anymore

1688
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:16,744
Skipping like a broken record
you can play again

1689
01:45:18,190 --> 01:45:21,326
But I'll do it all again

1690
01:45:22,672 --> 01:45:26,915
I'll put it behind me
then you rewind me

1691
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:30,591
This time is gonna be
the last time

1692
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:34,612
What I say
The last time again

1693
01:45:34,714 --> 01:45:37,953
This time is gonna be
the last time

1694
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:42,439
What I say
The last time again

1695
01:46:05,757 --> 01:46:09,703
Once again
I must have been

1696
01:46:09,804 --> 01:46:13,544
Tryin' to wash away the sin

1697
01:46:13,651 --> 01:46:17,494
'Cause I wake up
bathroom floor

1698
01:46:17,597 --> 01:46:21,566
I won't do this anymore

1699
01:46:24,321 --> 01:46:27,230
Starting tomorrow

1700
01:46:28,770 --> 01:46:31,941
This time is gonna be
the last time

1701
01:46:32,049 --> 01:46:36,189
What I say
The last time again

1702
01:46:36,296 --> 01:46:39,603
This time is gonna be
the last time

1703
01:46:39,709 --> 01:46:43,985
What I say
The last time again

1704
01:46:44,091 --> 01:46:47,364
This time is gonna be
the last time

1705
01:46:47,469 --> 01:46:51,575
What I say
The last time again

1706
01:46:51,684 --> 01:46:55,025
This time is gonna be
the last time

1707
01:46:55,129 --> 01:46:59,201
What I say
The last time again

1708
01:47:05,565 --> 01:47:06,234
[Ends]

1709
01:47:06,234 --> 01:47:07,465
[Ends]

1710
01:47:19,314 --> 01:47:22,119
And it's always
little things

1711
01:47:22,224 --> 01:47:27,037
That to the surface brings

1712
01:47:29,884 --> 01:47:32,485
Space you need to breathe

1713
01:47:32,593 --> 01:47:37,269
Before the curtain call

1714
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:42,785
The light that leads the way

1715
01:47:42,896 --> 01:47:47,675
Before you hit the wall

1716
01:47:50,556 --> 01:47:53,053
The mountain
that you climb

1717
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:56,770
Just to take a fall

1718
01:47:56,879 --> 01:48:00,449
The blind among the blind
And I say

1719
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:03,592
There's an echo
'round my heart

1720
01:48:03,702 --> 01:48:07,442
Draggin' me down

1721
01:48:07,549 --> 01:48:10,857
Beneath the waves
in silence I fall

1722
01:48:10,961 --> 01:48:14,029
There's a halo
above my head

1723
01:48:14,139 --> 01:48:17,879
Spinnin' me 'round

1724
01:48:17,986 --> 01:48:21,430
'Cause I don't know
if I'm alive or dead

1725
01:48:21,531 --> 01:48:24,736
There's a dagger
in my hand

1726
01:48:24,843 --> 01:48:29,758
Bleeding me dry

1727
01:48:37,621 --> 01:48:41,065
And all we have to lose

1728
01:48:41,167 --> 01:48:45,911
Is time

1729
01:48:48,058 --> 01:48:55,779
And what we lose
we leave behind

1730
01:48:58,527 --> 01:49:05,143
Stay around
and we will shine

1731
01:49:34,553 --> 01:49:36,458
