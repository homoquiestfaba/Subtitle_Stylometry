They're all making me mad.

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,800
It's totally true.

29
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,300
Your teachers are really cool.
Trust me.

30
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,770
He did not.
He did not say that.

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,910
Girls please.

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,810
Brittany...
Show Haley your shoes.

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,980
They're so amazing.

34
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,200
No way!

35
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,490
Those are so cute.

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,690
No way. I love those.
Did you order them?

37
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,510
Those are so cute.

38
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,880
You're so lucky.

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,380
Those are so cute.
Aren't they amazing?

40
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,890
I am so totally jealous.

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,480
I wish my mom would get me
something cool like that.

42
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,430
My aunt got them
for me in New York.

43
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,620
They're one of a kind.

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,200
Absolutely nobody here
has them.

45
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,440
You're so lucky.

46
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,290
Ok Brittany this is your stop.

47
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,740
Uh no it's not.

48
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,510
Of course it is.

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,350
Not unless we got
a new front door

50
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,590
and they changed
the street numbers.

51
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,020
Are you sure?

52
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,560
Well is this anybody's house?

53
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,840
Nope. No.

54
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,280
See you tomorrow!

55
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,680
Wait!
It's almost 4:00!

56
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,320
No. I'm sorry but...

57
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,380
Mom!

58
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,920

59
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,890
No. We're running
late as it is.

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,770
Olivia when I say no I mean...

61
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,790
I'm home!

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,530
Hi Mrs. Aarons.
Hi Mrs. Aarons.

63
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,580
Hi Mrs. Aarons.

64
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,630
5 minutes and I mean it!

65
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,700
What's going on?

66
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,400
Jordan.
Ahh.

67
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,400
Should've known.

68
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,440
Move it!
No way.

69
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,590
I still have 3 levels.

70
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,770
Zap zap.
There. Done.

71
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,340
Now move it.
How did you...

72
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,460
It's taken me 3 months...
remote!

73
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,650
What's up? Up next
is the world premiere

75
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,890

77
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,750

I finished 2 hours ago.
This is just extra credit.

134
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,480
Although it would be
a lot easier to concentrate

135
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,160
if someone wasn't having
band practice next door.

136
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,700

149
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,850
Hmm.

150
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,060
So what does "the door
is closed on" stand for?

151
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,990
♪ The door is closed on ♪

152
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,860

that ratified
the little known...

154
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,700
Beyonce amendment.

155
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,970

Rhode island?
Rhode island!

158
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,410
Yes. See? That is exactly
what I was going to say.

159
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,750
See how helpful this is?

160
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,600
Hmm.

161
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,890
"The door is closed
on my dreams.

162
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,590
Life is being lived
far away."

163
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,760
First draft?

164
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,860
I don't know what

165
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,500
the fact that it's 8:30

166
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,870
and you still haven't
started your homework or...

167
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,590
Or that you really
feel this way.

168
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,940
Brittany...

169
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,010
Are you really that unhappy?

170
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,580
Mom...

171
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,050
Uhh!

172
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,830
Must you be so dramatic?

173
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,220
It's just a song.

174
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,670
Ever heard of a little
thing called teen angst?

175
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,520
Please don't give me
sad mom eyes.

176
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,390
Ok. Fine.

177
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,090
Do I want to be here

178
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,430
where nothing but
nothing ever happens?

179
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,250
No!

180
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,360
Or do I want to be out there
where exciting things

181
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,630
are always happening?

182
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,850
Yes!
Hardly a secret.

183
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,440
And yet I'm the one
accused of being dramatic.

184
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,290
If you want to do
something with your life

185
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,940

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,530
So the complete
opposite of exciting.

187
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,820
I recycled for you.

188
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,950
I sold candy to save
the whales for you.

189
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,550
I thought you did it
for the whales.

190
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,920
I don't know any whales.

191
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,490
Please don't make me
help you save

192
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,860
a 100-year-old house
that nobody wants.

193
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,660
Ok. Fine.

194
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,400
What if I promise
to continue on

195
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,370
with my sad dreary
boring monotonous life

196
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,600
as if I'm completely
thrilled by it?

197
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,550
Deal.

198
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,710
Hello?

199
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,480
Jordan cahill's coming to town.

200
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,780
He's filming
his next video here.

201
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,850
Right here in the neighborhood.

202
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,990
Jordan's coming to town!

203
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,020
When did this happen?
How exactly do you know...

204
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,610
Wow.

205
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,890
Bet you really wish you'd
finished your homework now huh?

206
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,100
Heh.

207
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,770
Let's go people!

208
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,230
Don't forget.
I have a rally at 3:00

209
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,860
so you have to get coo to
karate and soccer by 5:00.

210
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,860
Oh and we have jessie's
science fair at 6:00.

211
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,950
3:00 5:00 and 6:00. Good.
Fairly light day.

212
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,870
Briefcase.

213
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,690
Oh honey that looks so...

214
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,540
Complex.

215
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,990
Hardly mom. It's just
recombinant DNA.

216
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,430
But I'm missing
3 nucleic acids.

217
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,830
Could they be small
round and something

218
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,660
you might use to play
fetch with the dog?

219
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,700
Mom!

220
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,470
Hey does this say

221
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,590
"please please put me
in your music video"?

222
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,010
More like please please
put me in a sweater.

223
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,210
Has anybody seen my brief...

224
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,790
Ha ha.
There's no way.

225
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,980
Oh come on dad please.

226
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,410
No. No!
Everybody's wearing...

227
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,980
Just a few teeth marks but
other than that good to go.

228
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,920
Oh mom they're
slobbery. Gross!

229
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,220
Have you seen what your daughter's
planning to wear to school today?

230
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,190
Cute. I think
she looks adorable.

231
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,210
Adorable? Oh!

232
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,260
Well played.
Thank you.

233
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,060
Check the counter
next to the phone.

234
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,030
I can't find my karate uniform.

235
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,670
Check the dryer.

236
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,140
Mom help!
It's broken!

237
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,390
Come on come on.
Cooper!

238
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,070
But it's still wet!

239
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,570
Well hang it out the
window when I'm driving.

240
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,210
Come on we're gonna be late.

241
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,080
Ok guys see you later.

242
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,610
Bye! Drive safely.

243
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,020
Ok.

244
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,980
Remember your seatbelt.

245
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,700
Ok. I think this
is definitely...

246
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,500
The one.

247
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,720
Hello? Oh no!

248
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,890
Wait!

249
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,900
No. Kind of funny was the
first time it happened.

250
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,190
Now it's just tragic.

251
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,020
Welcome to the land
of the middle child

252
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,410
a couple miles West of the
island of misfit toys.

253
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,130
Brittany!
Guess what?

254
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,200
Jordan's here and we're all
gonna be in his video.

255
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,530
You said guess.
Whatever.

256
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,430
I went online last night
and I found your shoes.

257
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,970
Uh my shoes?

258
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,240
You can't. You see
they're only from

259
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,610
this one little store
in New York.

260
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,140
Well that little store
has a Web site.

261
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,470
They're gonna be here tomorrow.

262
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,810
I got 2 different colors.

263
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,240
I wanna get some too!

264
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,150
We'll all match.

265
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,110
Brittany isn't that so cool?

266
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,050
Yeah. The coolest.

267
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,310
Good morning Jordan.

268
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,030
My cousin minnie thought she saw
him eating at Doug's diner.

269
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,130
But I said...

270
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,360
Excuse me.
I'm 214.

271
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,530
Cute. Is that
your boyfriend?

272
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
Ha. No.
Not exactly.

273
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,500
That's Jordan cahill.

274
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,010
Oh right. Sorry.
My bad.

275
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,370
Who's Jordan cahill?

276
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,280
You don't know
who Jordan cahill is?

277
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,150
'Fraid not.
I've been living in Europe

278
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,610
off and on for the
last couple of years.

279
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,780
Guess I'm not up with
the latest trends.

280
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,300
Apparently ponytails are back.

281
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,570
I'll have to make
a note of that.

282
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,550
So long story short.

283
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,390
But sports
just aren't my thing.

284
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,270
I'll wait over there
until you're done.

285
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,070
Actually the sun's
better over there.

286
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,260
You're on the goal with Aarons.

287
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,510
But I... uhp.
Could I please...

288
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,850
Uhp.

289
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,310
Move it.

290
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,120
All right let's go!

291
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,850
Hurry up hurry up!

292
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,390
Line it up kick the ball let's go!

293
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,390
Right through!

294
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,180
You're supposed
to try and catch it.

295
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,530
Yeah right.

296
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,780
Come on let's go!

297
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,450
Go! Lob up with that!

298
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,830
Hi. I'm Brittany.
I know you probably met

299
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,030
like a thousand
brittanys already.

300
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,330
There's actually
7 in our class.

301
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,640
I was thinking of
changing my name

302
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,740
to something more exciting

303
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,100
like Paris or...

304
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,670
Natasha.
Right.

305
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,840
I don't know if
I'm exactly a natasha

306
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,910
I was thinking something
like maybe arabella

307
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,100
or Naomi or francesca.

308
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,210
Uh no.
Natasha's my name.

309
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,300
Oh. I can see that.

310
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,050
It's nice.

311
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,520
So what are my chances
of getting out of this

312
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,420
with a dramatically
twisted ankle?

313
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,620
Not good. Mrs.
Dilemma's tight with the nurse.

314
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,740
Color me shocked.

315
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,770
So you really lived in Europe?

316
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,500
Well my dad
works over there so...

317
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,100
Summers breaks long weekends.

318
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,910
The rest of the time I'm with my mom.
New York.

319
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,430
New York City New York?
I love New York.

320
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,380
Not that I've ever been there.

321
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,400
The whole concept.

322
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,010
I really see myself
as more... [Gasps]

323
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,280
Uhh!

324
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,580
So what are you doing here?

325
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,050
I was apparently quite horrible
to someone in my past life

326
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,720
and my mother was transferred.

327
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,990
Ooh.

328
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,330
You're serious?

329
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,380
This whole athleticism
thing happens every day?

330
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,300
Yeah.

331
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,520
Oh good. Only 41/2 more
years till college.

332
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,390
Hopefully I'll get time off
for good behavior.

333
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,680
So what's the deal
with this Jordan guy?

334
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,910
Well he's ok I guess

335
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,220
but everybody else
is in love with him.

336
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,890
Well who wants to be part
of everybody right?

337
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,390
Right.

338
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,030
I'm home.

339
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,540
Good. You can help me
load this stuff...

340
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,390
Hello.

341
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,870
Mom this is natasha.

342
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,640
She's from New York.
Natasha this is my mom.

343
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,210
I'm just from here.
Nice to meet you.

344
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,680
Thanks. So um what's
with all the posters?

345
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,320
Oh please don't even
get her started.

346
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,190
She's trying to save
some old decrepit house.

347
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,920
I mean local landmark.

348
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,210
We'll be upstairs
in my... actually

349
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,900
you know why don't you let
her tell you all about it?

350
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,960
It is really kind of
fascinating.

351
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,220
Natasha's socially aware.
You're socially aware

352
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,000
aren't you? You seem like
you'd be socially aware.

353
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,540
She talks when she's nervous.

354
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,270
I noticed.
Ok. I'll be right back.

355
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,340
On the floor.

we let them demolish
this beautiful old house

372
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,240
and we're losing the last
connection we have to our past.

373
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,010
We're thinking about
making a human chain.

374
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,220
I know. All she needs
are some humans.

375
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,890
You know it really was
kind of fascinating.

376
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,230
Totally amazing.

377
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,560
The city had a certain
Je ne sais quoi.

378
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,270
we went to tons of concerts

379
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,740
lots of theater and the
most amazing shopping.

380
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,570
It's official.
You're living my life.

381
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,910
Actually now I really
am living your life.

382
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,380
Well at least until
I can convince my mother

383
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,320
she's made a horrible
horrible mistake.

384
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,920
Hey do you play the guitar?

385
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,050
Oh. No not really.

386
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,150
Oh too bad.

387
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,150
You've got that whole

388
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,720
coffee house poetess thing going on.

389
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,520
Really? I do?

390
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,590
Knock it off you little creep!

391
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,910
Aah!

392
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,270
Because I'm actually
more into writing

393
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,380
than I am into playing.

394
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,110
Don't look at that!

395
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,410
Why not?
You're really good.

396
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,980
"An island of hope
in a sea of sameness."

397
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,320
I love that.

398
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,790
Really? You do?

399
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,310
Because no one has ever...

400
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,590
Hello.

401
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,190
Jordan's coming to Lafayette!

402
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,180
No way. That's just around the corner.
I'll be there in...

403
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,530
So...

404
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,800
Um you remember
that Jordan guy?

405
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,840
Well he's filming
just down the street

406
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,840
and I know it sounds
really lame

407
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:08,840
but...
we should go.

408
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,140
Really?

409
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,880
I mean you sure?

410
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,980
Yeah.

411
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,550
Watching all of his crazed fans

412
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,080
make complete fools
out of themselves

413
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,220
should be hilarious.

414
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,150
"Oh Jordan
I love you!"

415
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,850
Please.

416
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,720
Right.

417
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,590
Jordan I...

418
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,740
Love you!

419
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,460
Wow you're really good at this.

420
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,580
Uh thanks.

421
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,450
You know I figure
as long as we're here

422
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,670
we might as well...

423
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,620
There he is!

424
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,610
Love that hat.
Picked out that hat.

425
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,110
The hat works.
Am I wrong?

426
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,480
Jordan hey hey. Perfect.
That's exactly what I need you to do.

427
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,260
Check this out.
Come on. Look.

428
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,510
You see your reflection.

429
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,630
You splash your reflection.

430
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,180
You turn to camera.

431
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,420
You strike a pose.
You flip your hair.

432
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,360
You do that thing
in the music video

433
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,340
the girls join in
and boom! Big finish.

434
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,490
Next thing you know we're back
on the bus to civilization.

435
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,730
You got it?

436
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,830
No I don't got it all right?

437
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,600
What does any of this
have to do with the song?

438
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,540
I said I don't want to do
any more strut-strut-snap

439
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,940
girls appear out of nowhere...

440
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,140
Flip your hair stuff.

441
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,760
I couldn't agree
with you more bro.

442
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,760
That's why this time
we're keepin' it real.

443
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,260
Look the dancers don't come in

444
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,380
until after the hair flip
this time.

445
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,530
Places everybody.
Let's roll.

446
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,920
Roll camera.
We have speed.

447
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,170
Take one.

448
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,170

449

Looking great.

473
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,500
I don't want to
sing the song len.

474
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,010
It sounds like
everything else I've done.

475
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,500
Exactly.

476
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,780
Eddie where are my lyrics?

477
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,970
I don't know if you've read
the reworked lyrics I wrote

478
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,590
but I think they work
a little...

479
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,920
I read 'em and they are incredible...

480
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,960
For someone else.

481
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,280
Jordan your fans
want songs about love

482
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,060
getting it
finding it losing it.

483
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,360
They love you.

484
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,540
Someone peel the girls
off the window.

485
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,890
They're gonna leave a mark.

486
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,440
Ugh. Raisins. I'm not
a big fan of raisins.

487
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,440
Argh.

488
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,980
Pick out the raisins

489
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,410
and fire whoever
put them there.

490
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,450
See what I do for you?

491
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,950
I'm still not
doing the song len.

492
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,690
Ok. Ok. Hey
take your time.

493
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,690
Whatever you need.

494
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,820
You take your time Jordan.

495
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,490
Look I need a serious
attitude adjustment

496
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,910
by tomorrow or else.

497
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,790
Ok? Run run.
Run run.

498
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,670
Hey man you know
why don't we just...

499
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,170
Let's get outta here.

500
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,970
All right? And please...

501
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,940
Please remember to
download all my files...

502
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,260
To disk.
I know I know.

503
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,610
You've told me the same thing
every day for like 6 months.

504
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,980
I'm sorry man it's just my
whole life is on that thing.

505
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,630
Have a little faith.

506
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,330
I got your back man.

507
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,920
Thanks man.

508
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,400
Hey hey hey.

509
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,610
Suppose I want
to download everything

510
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,440
from a hand-held
to a disk.

511
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,660
It was kind of a bust.

512
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,530
We only saw him for
like 2 seconds.

513
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,660
I think I did some permanent
damage to my vocal cords.

514
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,770
Sorry.
Oh don't apologize.

515
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,500
Thanks to you I'm already
having more fun here

516
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,900
than I thought I ever would.

517
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,000
Unh! Man!

518
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,470
Jordan come back!

519
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,900
Guys wait up!

520
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,270
Guys I dropped some stuff!

521
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,630
Guys!

522
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,530
Hey guys wait up!

523
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,070
Jordan cahill I love you!

524
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,730
Talk about
your brushes with fame.

525
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,600
That was definitely
more of a trampling.

526
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,770
Are you ok?

527
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,270
Yeah yeah I'm fine.

528
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,070
Brittany!

529
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,440
I'm trying to call you.
Why don't you answer?

530
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,610
Oh sorry my phone
must be on silence.

531
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,970
Um...

532
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,380
Guys this isn't my phone.

533
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,470
Has anybody seen my phone?

534
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,800
Augh! Why isn't
he answering?

535
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,470
I just know that stupid roadie

536
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,810
who mowed me down has it.

537
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,640
He's not answering because
he's too busy calling China.

538
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,230
Please hold. Not a problem.
Not my phone.

539
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,530
Don't say that.
My dad is going to lose it

540
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,480
if he finds out I
lost my phone again.

541
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,650
Don't worry. He can't be
that hard to find.

542
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,490
He is on a bus
with a national icon.

543
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,870
Well they're staying at that
swanky hotel out by the freeway.

544
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,990
Well it's the only
decent hotel around.

545
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,330
Where else
would they be staying?

546
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,180
The only question is...

547
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,710
How are we going to get there?

548
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,020
I'm guessing a cab
is out of the question.

549
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,430
True.

550
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,400
But...

551
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,670
I've got the next best thing.

552
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,440
Sorry.

553
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,190
Sorry.

554
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,200
Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry.

555
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,500
Are you sure
she has her license?

556
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,150
She can build a rocket
that will get you to the moon

557
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,190
but that whole
hand-eye thing...

558
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,190
No talking ok?

559
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,550
You're distracting me.

560
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,310
Sorry!

561
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,530
But he has to be.

562
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,930
No one by that name.

563
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,240
No luck. He's not
even staying here.

564
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,270
Are you sure?

565
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,780
Yeah that's what the guy said.

566
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,160
Oh please. Let me
take care of this.

567
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,910
What are you gonna do?

568
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,650
You just have to act like you belong
and not take "no" for an answer.

569
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,420
But what if the answer
really is no?

570
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,640
Excuse me.

571
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,250
I just gave your
friend an answer.

572
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,920
But it wasn't an honest answer.

573
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,290
You've got photographers
on the street

574
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,810
and reporters in the lobby.

575
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,060
We know he's here.
You know he's here.

576
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,460
So let's just skip
this little charade.

577
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,430
Kip... may I call you kip?

578
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,000
My name is David.

579
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,910
Sure why not?

580
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,590
Hurry up!

581
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,390
Brittany
get over here! Now!

582
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,460
We're not some crazed
Jordan cahill fans.

583
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,910
Yeah. We don't even think
he's that cute.

584
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,780
Though definitely
cuter in person.

585
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,150
Yeah totally.
So much cuter in person.

586
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,150
I saw his hair
and it was like...

587
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,270
My point is...

588
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,890
One of his flunkies
has something of ours

589
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,270
and we'd kind of like it back.

590
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,630
So until we do
we're not leaving.

591
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,580
Knock it off jessie!
We'll be there in a minute!

592
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,750
Hurry up!
It's almost dinner!

593
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,470
Like I said
we're not leaving...

594
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,340
Very soon.

595
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,410
Eddie here.

596
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,180
I'm sorry to bother you sir.

597
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:43,200
Yeah. Raisins
get people fired.

598
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,150
Ok before you throw them out

599
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,690
be sure to give them
a lovely parting gift.

600
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,410
They're only like
the 1oooth fan

601
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,360
to use that excuse to get
up here to see Jordan ok?

602
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,740
Oh we need Mayo too.

603
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,760
Who was that?

604
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,160
Some schmo at the front desk

605
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,400
says a couple of girls were
trying to convince him that...

606
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,640
Convince him that what?

607
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,610
Hey look!
The thing! It fell!

608
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,620
Come on! I know you can
walk faster than that!

609
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,420
Oh man!

610
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,920
What are you doing anyway?

611
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,030
You were in there forever!

612
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,060
Hey stop those kids!

613
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,200
They got my phone!

614
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,380
That was a total waste of time.

615
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,520
Tell me about it.

616
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,640
Ok nobody distract me.

617
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
Wait!

618
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,950
Wait!

619
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,230
Oh no!

620
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,520
What was that?

621
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,090
My brain rattling
around in my head?

622
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,050
I don't see anything.

623
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,300
Ok. Whew.

624
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,030
Hey...You got
the wrong phone.

625
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,930
Unh...

626
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,470
Unh.

627
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,680
Hi.

628
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,120
Hi.

629
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,650
Hi.

630
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,720
Hey you don't happen to remember
Jordan's cell phone number do you?

631
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,260
Please remember.
Nope.

632
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,860
He's changed it so many times
who can keep track?

633
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,910
Doesn't matter though.
He's here.

634
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,220
Jordan Eddie is looking for ya.

635
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,870
Hey don't I pay you
to keep track of him?

636
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,300
I shouldn't have to tell you.

637
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:45,010
I'm playing.
I'm playing.

638
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,240
What's up?

639
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,180
Nothing.

640
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,810
What's up with you?

641
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,920
Eddie...

642
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,520
I'm sorry. What?

643
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,520
Heh heh.

644
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,570
You go first.

645
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,290
I'm sorry. What were
you going to say?

646
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,740
I'm sorry for pulling that full-on
rock star act this afternoon.

647
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,700
Dude you're a rock star.

648
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,600
It's what you do... throw hissy
fits trash hotel rooms.

649
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,130
Do you think I was wrong?

650
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,770
That song is about nothing.

651
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,470
Yeah.

652
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,520
But I mean it's got a good beat

653
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,210
something you can dance to.

654
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,490
Look I mean 3 years ago

655
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,700
you were singing
in your basement.

656
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,810
I was backing you up.

657
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,920
Now you're singing
in stadiums man!

658
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,190
I'm backing you up!

659
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,320
You got everything
you ever wanted.

660
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,190
Is this what I wanted?

661
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,680
Oh man you are like the whiniest
rock star I've ever met.

662
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,880
Let me know if you ever
want to change places

663
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,300
and that includes
dating Penelope.

664
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,030
Penelope. Oh thank you
for reminding me.

665
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,180
Eddie...

666
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,740
Did you do something
to your forehead?

667
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,010
This thing is like a gazillion
times nicer than mine.

668
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,780
You'd think somebody
would want it back.

669
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,620
I mean tv Internet access.

670
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,150
Well you need a password
for most of it.

671
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,120
I used to have one just like it
when I lived in Madrid.

672
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,620
You lived in Madrid?

673
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:09,220
And my dad won't even
let me have Spanish rice

674
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,230
because he thinks
it's too spicy.

675
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,140
Whose phone is it?
What happened to your phone?

676
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,840
Oh you're gonna be so busted
when dad finds out that...

677
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,240
Get out!

678
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,510
Ok.

679
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,020
It's you.

680
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,150
I mean it's your phone.

681
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,120
I mean...

682
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,970
Here.

683
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,090
Hello?

684
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,830
Look you little thief
I want my phone back!

685
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,500
Just return it and there
will be no questions.

686
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,930
I didn't steal your phone!

687
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,400
I tried to bring it back
and I got yelled at

688
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,100
for being 20 minutes late
for dinner

689
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,840
so if anybody
is stealing it's you.

690
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,070
Whoa hey calm down.

691
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,410
I am calm!

692
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,540
I am calm.

693
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,530
I'm sorry. I guess
I was just afraid

694
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,280
about it falling
into the wrong hands.

695
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,310
The wrong hands?
It's just a phone.

696
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,610
And all I want is my...

697
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,820
Um hang on. I've got
another call coming in.

698
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,490
No no see you don't have
another call coming in.

699
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,090
I have another call coming in.

700
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,600
Ok. Yeah right. Sorry.

701
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,810
Do you really think it's her?

702
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,090
We'll call you back.

703
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,130
No no don't don't
don't don't don't!

704
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,800
Hello? Madonna?

705
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,600
It's her!
It's her! It's her!

706
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,600
Hi! This is...

707
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,270
Hello?

708
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,140
She hung up.

709
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,080
Maybe we shouldn't have
screamed like that.

710
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,010
Brit...

711
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,610
You know whose phone
this is don't you?

712
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,280
This...

713
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,630
Is Jordan cahill's phone.

714
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,250
Aah!

715
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,870
I don't know why I did that.

716
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,590
Natasha?

717
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Your mom's...

718
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,400
Here.

719
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,200
And Brittany yours is
highly suspicious.

720
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,070
Thank you so much for letting me
stay over for dinner Mrs. Aarons.

721
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,970
Don't do anything
till tomorrow. Promise?

722
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,210
Promise.

723
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,480
Promise.
She promises.

724
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,360
Honestly.
Let's go.

725
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,130
What part of reality
don't you understand?

726
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,460
All I'm saying is

727
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,850
I just don't think
you know Madonna.

728
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,070
That was me caring for one
second what you think.

729
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,390
Oh but don't worry.
I'm over it.

730
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,510
Natasha you are so funny.

731
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,050
Isn't she funny?

732
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,360
Yeah! Not.

733
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,200
Bye-bye.

734
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,350
Ok first off
you don't know Madonna.

735
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,150
You didn't even
talk to her. I did.

736
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,170
And second

737
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,290
you can't tell anyone
about this phone.

738
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
It's like a total
invasion of privacy.

739
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,900
I've been thinking about it all night
and we've got to give it back.

740
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,870
You really are impossible.

741
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,370
"Oh natasha nothing
ever happens to me.

742
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,300
"Oh natasha
my life is so boring.

743
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,410
"Oh natasha...

744
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,190
Do I really say
"oh natasha" that often?

745
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,240
The point...

746
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,580
Excitement has fallen
into your lap

747
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,860
and you want nothing
to do with it.

748
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,250
It's him.

749
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,150
Pick up pick up pick up.

750
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,250
Hello?

751
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,440
Where have you been?

752
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,550
I called you like a
million times last night.

753
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,560
Why didn't you answer?

754
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,860
Sorry. Lights out
at 10:00.

755
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,710
We know whose phone this is.

756
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,940
Listen I am sorry
for yelling at you

757
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,260
and I am sorry for
taking your phone

758
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,270
but can we please please
just meet and trade phones?

759
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,050
Sure no problem.
But first we want to talk to Jordan.

760
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,300
What?

761
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,210
Yeah fine
no problem. Sure.

762
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,180
Hey Jordan can you
come here for a sec?

763
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,330
Yeah here I come.

764
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,800
Hey how's it going?

765
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,330
Ok Jordan just for
security purposes

766
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,170
could we get you
to sing a few bars of...

767
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,140
Your multi-platinum hit

768
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,760
the live recording not
the dance version remix.

769
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,020
Yeah sure no problems.

770
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,330
♪ Penel... ♪

771
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,860
wrong.

772
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,100
They sweeten my voice in post.

773
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,730
Look you little twerps.
I need that phone back.

774
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,620
No Jordan no phone.

775
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,900
For all intents and purposes

776
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,070
I am Jordan.

777
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,460
I handle every aspect
of Jordan's life.

778
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,570
Just give me back that phone.

779
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,840
Repeat after me...

780
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,630
"No Jordan
no phone."

781
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,850
Fine. But can you at least
give me Gwen Stefani's number?

782
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,320
Jordan keeps asking for it.

783
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,350
Gwen Stefani?

784
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,960
Save ashbrook house!

785
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,410
Honk to save ashbrook house.

786
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:42,730
This is what I get for not having
more after-school activities.

787
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,960
Yeah well this is what I get

788
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,500
for not having
any other friends.

789
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,320
This place is so cute...

790
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,940
An island of hope
in a sea of sameness.

791
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,010
Not exactly what
I was going for.

792
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,510
Besides unless
my mom can generate

793
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,140
some serious
community awareness

794
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,430
next week it will be a gas
station and a coffee place.

795
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,720
Wait isn't there a coffee
place just 2 blocks over?

796
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,600
Yeah but I could walk
to this one.

797
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,160
Honk to save ashbrook house.

798
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,090
Honk if you feel sorry for me.

799
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,010
Honey! Hey
good job sweetie!

800
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,060
Jordan's getting
his hair done today.

801
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,570
Ok thank you.

802
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,030
Highlights.

803
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,300
So?

804
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,240
So...

805
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,150
Hello it's Louise.

806
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
Oh hello Louise.

807
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,470
This is natasha Jordan
cahill's personal assistant.

808
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,990
Jordan's people.

809
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:40,990
What are you doing?

810
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,160
Yes I'm sure
you're very excited.

811
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:45,580
Id just like to go over a couple
of ground rules with you Louise.

812
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,030
Uh-huh.

813
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,400
Never look Mr. cahill
directly in the eye.

814
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,620
Always kneel before
you speak to him.

815
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,170
And remember
he only eats raisins.

816
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,190
Got that?

817
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,570
Oh and Louise

818
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,210
he wants all of
his hair cut off.

819
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,810
Yes. You want it all off?

820
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,860
That's right.

821
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,110
Ok. Bye.
Thanks. Bye!

822
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,080
No no no no no not his hair.

823
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,890
We cannot cut
Jordan's hair off.

824
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,240
Oh relax. No one's gonna
let her cut Jordan's hair.

825
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,660
And voila!

826
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,370
Aah!

827
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,750
What have you done?

828
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,620
Raisin?

829
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,910
Thanks mom.

830
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,010
So I was like there's
no way I got one wrong.

831
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,010
Check it again.

832
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,710
And so he did and I was right

833
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,600
so he had to raise my grade
and lower everyone else's.

834
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,220
Oh honey!
I know!

835
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,020
I knew I didn't get one
wrong though.

836
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,850
I mean heh you know?

837
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,220
Dad can I get a cell phone?

838
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,210
No. Ask me
in a couple years.

839
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,560
I want to get
one of those new ones...

840
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,430
With tv reception

841
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,130
and Internet access.

842
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,570
You know kind of like
that one that Brittany...

843
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,620
Whoa! Whoa!

844
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,820
Honey are you all right?

845
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,670
How many times have I told you
not to lean over in this chair?

846
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,490
Sit.
I'll get it.

847
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,580
I'll get it.

848
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,390
Ok. From what
I can tell

849
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,620
the world is coming to an end

850
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,960
and a boy named Jordan
cut his hair.

851
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,690
What?

852
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:34,580
And the golden mane is gone.

853
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,670
Let's hope his fans
don't go with it.

854
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,040
No word yet from Jordan's
record company or management.

855
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,150
I can't believe we did that.

856
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,080
I can't believe they did that.

857
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,180
No Penelope it really
doesn't look that bad.

858
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
That bad?

859
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,820
Not that bad?

860
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,960
I am holding you
personally responsible.

861
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,060
What did... me?

862
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,260
It's not Eddie's fault.

863
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,330
It's just hair.
It'll grow back.

864
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,330
Besides this is how
I used to wear it.

865
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,030
Before you were famous.

866
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,380
Don't you get it?

867
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,930
The hair was the money.

868
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,600
Then dress it up and make it
sing your lousy songs.

869
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,270
Heh. Everyone has to
have an image.

870
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,140
Part of yours was...Oh.

871
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,650
Oh.

872
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,750
New song new look new image...

873
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,450
Heh. I'm a genius.

874
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,580
Crisis averted.

875
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,490
Will be the premiere

876
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,490
of a whole new
Jordan cahill image.

877
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,890
We'll just have to have a
couple of days of reshoots.

878
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,860
Call Rolling stone.

879
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,600
tell them if they
give us the cover

880
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:38,600
we will give them the exclusive
on Jordan cahill's new look.

881
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,070
You're still writing.

882
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,230
You're now turning.
You're walking.

883
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,600
Good. That's a start.

884
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,210
Cool.

885
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,440
So I guess I'm off the hook.

886
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,540
Eddie...

887
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,200
I know what really happened
this afternoon.

888
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,520
The salon said that someone called
from my personal cell phone.

889
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,260
Jordan I can explain.

890
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,420
Thanks.

891
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,460
I mean I was gonna tell...

892
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,830
Thanks?

893
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,200
All I ever do is whine about
wanting to make some changes

894
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,820
but never do anything about it.

895
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,030
Half of my career has
been about my hair

896
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,420
and now it can be about
me and my music.

897
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,210
Thanks for giving me
the push I needed.

898
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,980
You're a good friend.

899
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,860
Well yeah. Sure.

900
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,650
I mean that's
what I'm here for.

901
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,960
Oh hey can I get my phone back?

902
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,390
Yeah sure.

903
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,430
There you go.

904
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,510
Thank you.

905
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,700
Um it's not working.

906
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,070
Oh man my bad.

907
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,100
You know after
I called the salon

908
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,370
and downloaded all your
data like I always do

909
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,040
I must have forgotten
to charge it!

910
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,310
I am such a fool!

911
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,810
Eddie! Eddie!

912
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,530
Don't beat yourself up.
It's ok all right?

913
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,370
I'll have to call Penelope back
from the hotel phone.

914
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,600
Thanks.

915
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,690
You know...

916
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,930
I really don't look half bad.

917
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,500
Whew.

918
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,110
He writes his own lyrics?

919
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,490
I can either pummel you
within an inch of your life

920
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,690
for being in my room again

921
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,020
or you can help me break
the password on this thing.

922
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,610
You know you've got
dirty socks under here

923
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,060
that are older than I am.

924
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,670
Password.

925
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,660
What's this guy's birthday?

926
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,910
4-1-82.

927
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,450
You're in.

928
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,260
He uses his birthday?

929
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,600
Nah.

930
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,950
He's over 14.

931
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,200
Everyone over 14 just uses
the factory setting.

932
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,440
They're amazing.

933
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,810
They're moving
and spiritual and sweet

934
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,880
about wanting to see
the world live life...

935
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,880
They're about the same things
I write about.

936
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:42,280
You two were practically
separated at birth.

937
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,580
See his version
of More than me

938
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,840
is all about feeling
trapped and isolated

939
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,790
and wanting to be different.

940
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,760
What are you wearing?

941
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,840
Oh just a little something
I threw together.

942
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,460
Cute.
Thanks.

943
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,660
Anyway he misses his dogs
and his girlfriend

944
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,800
and he loves playing
flying saucer golf.

945
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,030
Wait. What's that quaint little
expression you used before?

946
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,300
Oh I remember!

947
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,100
Invasion of privacy?

948
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,620
Don't you understand?

949
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,290
See the Jordan we see
isn't the real Jordan.

950
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,440
They're forcing him
to do all this stuff.

951
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,610
They?

952
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,580
I don't know "they."
His people.

953
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,620
Like that guy who won't
give me my phone back.

954
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,090
We need to help him.

955
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,490
Why should we help him?

956
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,920
He didn't even call us to thank
us for the fabulous haircut.

957
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,360
So operation
save Jordan was launched.

958
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,230
Of course there was no reason

959
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,700
I couldn't make a few

You two think you're
pretty smart don't ya?

1009
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,820
Well not really. I mean
my grades were decent.

1010
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,390
Heh. Thought you'd
get away with this

1011
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,710
and I wasn't gonna even notice.

1012
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,960
It wasn't us I swear.

1013
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,660
Besides remember I said
I wasn't this smart?

1014
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,050
Mmm.

1015
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,880
Although you gotta admit
he does seem a lot happier.

1016
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:05,920
Heh heh heh.

1017
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:09,060
Oh yeah.
Warms my heart

1018
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,220
to see him walk off the set

1019
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,560
with a smile on his face.

1020
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:13,760
2 years ago Jordan was a nobody

1021
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:14,780
playing in a basement band

1022
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,160
and you were nobody's friend.

1023
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,000
One more surprise...
just one more...

1024
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,850
And it's back to the basement
for the both of you.

1025
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,670
Do we understand each other?

1026
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,650
Yes.

1027
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,770
Excellent. Now I want you
to be a good little minion

1028
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:30,980
and go convince our star to sing
the song I want him to sing.

1029
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,980
Go go go go.

I loved it!
It was great!

1037
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:00,010
Did you really like it tasha?

1038
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,470
Because it totally
just came to me.

1039
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,680
I'm serious. I loved it.

1040
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,190
Well usually it takes me
forever to write a song

1041
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,380
but this one...
no no. I liked the part

1042
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,400
where you said "through
the open door."

1043
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,350
Yeah.
It's a...

1044
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,480
It's totally great.

1045
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,120
Well listen I think
I hear a banana split

1046
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,120
calling my name so I'll
talk to you tomorrow ok?

1047
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,850
Bye.

1048
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,390
Oh I know I know.

1049
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,900
How stupid am I to care so much
about a condemned old house?

1050
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,200
It's not stupid.

1051
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,140
A tad obsessive perhaps...

1052
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,210
More sympathy less levity.

1053
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,040
Hey...

1054
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,710
Since when is it
stupid to care?

1055
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,330
You're fighting for
something you believe in.

1056
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,350
It's one of the reasons
I love you so much

1057
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:47,490
and it's what makes you you.

1058
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,860
Much better.

1059
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,060
I just wish I could
make people understand

1060
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,660
that that house...

1061
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,430
Is the last thing that makes
our little corner of suburbia

1062
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,030
the least bit unique.

1063
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,740
An island of hope
in a sea of sameness.

1064
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:07,170
You know the other day

1065
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,180
I pulled into
the wrong driveway.

1066
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:12,880
Really?

1067
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,250
Well don't give up yet.

1068
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,530
After the big rally on Saturday

1069
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,750
who knows what'll happen and...

1070
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,120
Oh I know.

1071
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:24,660
7 people are scheduled
to attend Saturday's big rally.

1072
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,990
8 if I could get at least one
of my own children to show up.

1073
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,260
Well I'd probably
only count on 7.

1074
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,830
Yeah.

1075
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,840
It's all right.

1076
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,500
Ok Brittany now
it's my turn to talk.

1077
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,650
This has got to end
do you hear me?

1078
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:55,990
And I got a news flash
for you little missy.

1079
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:57,360
You're not helping Jordan.

1080
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,790
You're destroying him.

1081
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,560
Uh this isn't Brittany.
I'm calling Brittany.

1082
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:02,830
Who's this?

1083
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,130
Uh wrong number!

1084
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,300
You know him?

1085
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,800
I know Jordan.

1086
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,890
Natasha I've got
to talk to you.

1087
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,610
I had the most brilliant idea.

1088
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,440
What's everyone...

1089
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,710
Do you really know
Jordan cahill?

1090
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:22,380
Ok you can tell me.
Tell me.

1091
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,650
So do you know Jordan
or don't you?

1092
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,350
Yes.

1093
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,850
I so wanted to tell you.

1094
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,490
I have his phone.
I know everything there is to know

1095
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,990
about him.
We made him cut his hair.

1096
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,290
You did that?

1097
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,490
Totally.
Actually it was...

1098
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,760
Something had to be done
about that unruly mop.

1099
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,160
It wasn't even your idea.
It was mine.

1100
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,630
The new clothes the new look all me.

1101
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,470
I can make him do
anything I want.

1102
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,150
Oh and I talked to Madonna!

1103
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,270
So did I.

1104
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,170
Can we meet him?
Please please please?

1105
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:49,980
That's my brilliant idea.

1106
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,210
Uh wait.
Where's natasha?

1107
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,880
Who knows? Who cares?
What's your idea?

1108
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,880
You can all see Jordan tomorrow

1109
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,490
at the save ashbrook
house rally.

1110
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,220
Is he going to sing?

1111
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,520
If I say so.

1112
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,950
What?
That's the deal.

1113
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,380
Jordan sings at
the rally tomorrow

1114
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,850
and I give the phone back.

1115
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,220
No. There's absolutely
no way. It's impossible.

1116
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,950
He has to. I've
already told people.

1117
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,750
Well that's not my problem.

1118
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:26,780
But it has to be your problem.

1119
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:28,730
Natasha where are you?

1120
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,300
Ok fine.

1121
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,830
If Jordan's not there tomorrow

1122
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,780
I'll erase everything
on his phone.

1123
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:37,150
Including his address book

1124
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,550
his to-do list

1125
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,640
oh and all the songs
that he's written.

1126
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,770
No no no.
You can't do that.

1127
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,860
Those are the only
copies I made.

1128
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:44,080
I never downloaded them.

1129
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,640
And that's not my problem.

1130
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:48,310
So 2:00
he'll be there?

1131
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,080
Yes. He'll be there.
Excellent.

1132
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,820
Whoops. Gotta go.
It's the girlfriend.

1133
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,090
Hi Penelope.

1134
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,760
No. This is
Brittany.

1135
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,810
Let's just say I'm a friend.

1136
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:03,200
Flying in on Saturday?

1137
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,130
Ooh no. Saturday's
bad for Jordan.

1138
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,820
I'm pretty sure
he's already booked.

1139
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,180
Ok. Bye-bye.

1140
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:16,480
I just can't believe
Jordan cahill

1141
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,110
is really going
to come to my rally.

1142
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,780
You can believe it.

1143
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:20,880
We are so proud of you honey.

1144
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,800
How'd you even pull this off?

1145
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,950
You know this isn't really

1146
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,520
supposed to be
my night to clear.

1147
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,820
Jessie please.
Your sister's trying to tell a story.

1148
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,020
You just have to know
who to call.

1149
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,360
I explained what it was for

1150
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:36,090
and they were more
than happy to help out.

1151
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,900
Well I'm still amazed
you even got through.

1152
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,260
I'm not.

1153
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:40,420
You can be excused mister.

1154
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,530
Oh I am just so excited!

1155
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:45,100
This is going to be
a real protest rally

1156
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,970
with songs and speeches
and celebrities!

1157
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,770
With all the press
and the publicity

1158
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,490
the city's going
to have to declare it

1159
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,780
an historical landmark.

1160
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,380
Oh! This is going
to be so much fun!

1161
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,850
I don't know if fun
is the right word.

1162
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,150
I'm guessing Jordan's gonna
be a little depressed.

1163
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,090
Depressed? Why would
he be depressed?

1164
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:03,320
He just broke up
with his girlfriend.

1165
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:04,590
Or actually they're saying

1166
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,820
that she broke up with him.

1167
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:07,330
No.

1168
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:11,500
Do you sense we're not
getting the entire story?

1169
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,580
Lately nothing seems
to be going right

1170
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,010
for the prince of pop.

1171
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,150
He's now hairless loveless

1172
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,350
and insiders tell us

1173
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,120
his new video
is behind schedule.

1174
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,420
Is Jordan's reign
finally coming to an end?

1175
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,440
No!

1176
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,990
We're supposed
to be helping him.

1177
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,930
Wow you must feel horrible.

1178
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:41,480
Ooh!

1179
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,680
Hi Brittany.

1180
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,710
I was beginning to wonder if I
was ever going to see you here.

1181
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,660
Hi um is natasha here?

1182
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,280
I called her like a
gazillion times last night

1183
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,650
but she never answered.

1184
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,450
She's in her room.
You can go on up.

1185
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,390
Thanks.
Brittany...

1186
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:10,220
I just wanted to tell
you how happy I am

1187
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,690
that natasha met you.

1188
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,730
She is so shy

1189
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,130
sometimes it's hard
for her to make friends.

1190
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,580
Shy? Yeah right.

1191
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,500
And by the way we are
going to have a barbecue

1192
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,800
if you want
to swing by tomorrow.

1193
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:22,170
Natasha's dad's coming home.

1194
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,000
Home? Here?

1195
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:27,740
Of course here.
He's been traveling lately.

1196
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:30,880
Paris? Rome? Madrid?

1197
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,140
Actually mostly around Buffalo.

1198
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:35,580
Stationery sales keep him
on the road all the time.

1199
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,920
It'll be good to have him home.

1200
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,620
Sure.

1201
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:39,820
I've been living
in Europe off and on

1202
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,920
for the last couple of years.

1203
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,200
The rest of my time
I'm with my mom.

1204
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,920
Mom this is natasha.
She's from New York.

1205
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:47,360
The city had a certain

1206
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:48,690
we went to tons of concerts

1207
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,060
and the most amazing shopping.

1208
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,060
I used to have one just like
that when I lived in Madrid.

1209
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,870
I-I'm sorry
I just...

1210
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,040
I don't know why
but I thought...

1211
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,370
Never mind.

1212
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,020
Hey!

1213
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,020
Why didn't you call me back?

1214
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,380
We are in serious trouble.

1215
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,450
Look we're not
in anything together.

1216
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,370
Ok maybe I shouldn't
have told people

1217
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,960
that Jordan would
come sing at the rally.

1218
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,310
But you've got to help me.

1219
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,730
Why should I help you?

1220
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,260
So you can take all
the credit again?

1221
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,860
You think I want the credit

1222
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,630
for breaking up
Jordan and Penelope?

1223
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,700
Ha. Wow.

1224
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,240
Is there anything you won't do

1225
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,450
to be the center of attention?

1226
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,720
Me...Me?

1227
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:38,230
Your mom thinks
that you have no friends

1228
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,940
because you're shy.

1229
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,710
Well I know the real reason.

1230
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,880
It's because you're a liar.

1231
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,620
Me? Me?

1232
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,320
What about you?

1233
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,700
"Oh I'm not really a Jordan cahill fan.
" Please.

1234
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,490
You love him.

1235
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,480
"I lived with my dad
in Europe. I'm fabulous."

1236
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,800
Your parents
aren't even divorced.

1237
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,400
Your dad is a salesman.

1238
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,130
So? And I never
said they were.

1239
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,540
And I am fabulous.

1240
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,070
It's the only reason
you even talk to me.

1241
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,040
I talked to you

1242
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,610
because I felt sorry for you.

1243
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:11,240
You talked to me because
you thought I was cool.

1244
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:12,240
More like pathetic.

1245
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,360
Ok well if I'm so pathetic

1246
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,550
then how come you're so
desperate to be just like me?

1247
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,920
Nice outfit.

1248
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,870
Yeah. "I wanna be
different.

1249
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:21,090
I wanna stand out."

1250
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,820
Well newsflash.

1251
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,990
There's absolutely nothing
unique about you.

1252
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:27,590
That's not true.

1253
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,090
Calling me a liar?

1254
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,280
Your life's a lie.

1255
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,160
I should've never
listened to you.

1256
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,300
I should've just given the
phone back when I wanted to.

1257
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,270
Oh like this is all my fault?

1258
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,120
What is going on here?

1259
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,330
Yeah. Have fun
at your rally!

1260
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:47,850

1282
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,260
I am sorry that
I kept the phone.

1283
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,260
I am sorry that I said
Jordan had to sing.

1284
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,760
And I'm sorry that I threatened
to erase all of his songs.

1285
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,550
I'm sorry for everything.

1286
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,690
I just wish none of this
had ever happened.

1287
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,350
And I wish you'd told
me that an hour ago.

1288
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,860
What?

1289
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,590
Because then I wouldn't have
had to tell Jordan the truth

1290
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,990
so he could come sing
at your little event

1291
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,290
then he wouldn't have found out

1292
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,260
that his life is being
controlled by 2 teenage girls

1293
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,370
then he wouldn't have
disappeared.

1294
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,830
Disappeared?

1295
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,240
What do you mean
he disappeared?

1296
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,540
I mean
that's it. Ok?

1297
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,670
He ran away.
He had enough.

1298
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,870
And it's all your fault.

1299
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,410
Nice job!
Wait! No!

1300
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:27,750
This can't be my fault too.

1301
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:29,750
Was that him?

1302
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,880
Who? Jordan?
No. He's long gone.

1303
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:33,300
Ok.

1304
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,590
Hey guys.
We going somewhere?

1305
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,620
Yeah. Going on
a little field trip.

1306
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:43,230
We are going to find that
ungrateful little punk

1307
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,560
before the press
gets ahold of this

1308
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,970
bring him back here and
talk some sense into him.

1309
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,870
Ok. Just curious but how
do you expect to find him?

1310
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:50,540
He has his phone
on him doesn't he?

1311
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,170
Oh yeah sure.
Why don't you give him a call?

1312
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,620
I already tried that.

1313
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,170
See I'm not going to call him.

1314
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,180
I called the phone company and
activated his global find.

1315
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,660
See those high-end phones

1316
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,880
have a global tracking device
in them so you never lose them.

1317
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,510
Well there is a thing?

1318
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,220
Did everybody know
about this thing?

1319
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,680
Shut up and get in the car.

1320
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:07,390
Oh!

1321
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,120
You got a minivan?

1322
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:10,960
It's all they had.

1323
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,000
Did you find him?
Is he ok?

1324
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:27,340
I'm fine.

1325
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,740
Jordan?

1326
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,410
I hear you have my phone.

1327
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,710
I am so so so so so so sorry.

1328
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,750
I never meant for you and
Penelope to break up.

1329
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,550
Oh. Don't blame
yourself for that.

1330
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,490
We were breaking up
with or without you.

1331
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,350
Taxi!

1332
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:44,940
And I love your songs.
I'd never erase them.

1333
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,960
More than me
Is so beautiful.

1334
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,030
Yeah right.

1335
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:50,060
No. The version
you wrote.

1336
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:54,500
I kind of might have accidentally
broken your password.

1337
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,750
Not real big on boundaries huh?

1338
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,570
Again. Sorry.

1339
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,340
But why don't you
record that version?

1340
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:03,880
Well that's the multi-million
dollar question literally.

1341
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,010
Taxi!

1342
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,390
Uh you're never gonna
catch a taxi.

1343
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,810
This is the suburbs.

1344
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,980
Yeah. I'm starting
to figure that out.

1345
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:13,550
The record company owns
me and my next 6 albums.

1346
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,820
If I want to record

1347
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,350
I have to record what len says.

1348
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,470
But you can't just give up.

1349
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,090
You're Jordan cahill.

1350
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,480
There he is!

1351
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,900
Hey what are you doing
with Jordan's phone?

1352
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,600
Chase her. Hurry up.

1353
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,020
Chase her.

1354
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,250

1359
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,960
Mom and dad are setting
up for the rally.

1360
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:32,460
Hey! Shouldn't you
be there?

1361
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,300
I'm leaving if you
want to come with me.

1362
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,330
Please please pick up.

1363
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,850
I can't.

1364
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,470
I'm not home.

1365
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:42,970
Oh!

1366
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,940
I am so sorry.

1367
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,540
Everything you said
about me is true.

1368
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:48,860
I just wanted
to be your friend.

1369
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,380
And I just wanted you
to like me.

1370
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:51,680
And you've traveled
all over the world.

1371
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,870
And you have such great friends

1372
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,080
and you're so good
at everything you do.

1373
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:55,520
And you're so cool

1374
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:56,720
and you have all
these great clothes.

1375
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:58,020
I think I was just
jealous of you.

1376
00:58:58,090 --> 00:58:59,560
Oh shut up.
I was jealous of you.

1377
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,230
Shut up. [Gasps]
I didn't tell you.

1378
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,560
I talked to Jordan.

1379
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:04,690
Really?
What did he say?

1380
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:05,810
He ran away.
He's getting out

1381
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,030
of the music business forever.

1382
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,870
Because of what we did?
No. Actually

1383
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:10,080
I think he loved
everything we did.

1384
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:11,370
Well except for the threats

1385
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,500
and the extortion but pretty
much everything else.

1386
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,800
It's his record company.

1387
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:15,970
They won't let him record

1388
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,670
any of the wonderful
songs that he's written.

1389
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,210
That's so wrong.

1390
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,880
Hey isn't he supposed
to be singing

1391
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,400
at your mom's rally
in about an hour?

1392
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,180
That's probably not
going to happen.

1393
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,530
And I was so finally
starting to like my life.

1394
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,130
It could still happen.

1395
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,050
But we've got to find him
and get your phone back.

1396
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,840
Not really all that worried
about my phone right now.

1397
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,860
No. I've got
an idea.

1398
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,310
Cooper!

1399
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,480
I'm never wrong.

1400
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:46,100
Later. Let's go.

1401
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,570
Yes!

1402
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,810
Jordan please just stay
right where you are.

1403
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,180
We'll be there
in like 5 minutes.

1404
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,300
I swear. I don't think
he trusts me.

1405
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:03,220
I'm really sorry about this.

1406
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,820
Where's Jordan?

1407
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,040
I might have
forgotten to mention

1408
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:10,540
the part about the thugs
trying to stop us.

1409
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:11,630
You think?

1410
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,350
Aah!
Aah!

1411
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:17,600
Aaaaaaah!

1412
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,530
What're we going to do?

1413
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:31,710
Let's cut through
the McDonalds' yard.

1414
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,420
That way!

1415
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,930
Brittany?

1416
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,770
Hi Mrs. McDonald.
Hi Devon.

1417
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,420
Hi.

1418
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,840
Brittany...

1419
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:56,940
Yes Mrs. McDonald?

1420
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,540
Can you babysit Thursday?

1421
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,010
Um Thursday.
Yes. Sure.

1422
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,460
See you then.

1423
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,400
Slow down.
Wait up.

1424
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:10,650
I'm wearing these cork sandals...
fabulous for everything

1425
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,520
but walking
and eluding bad guys.

1426
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:13,690
Aah!

1427
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,530
Thought maybe
you could use this.

1428
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:16,960
But how did you know?

1429
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:17,960
Back of the door.

1430
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,400
Thank you.

1431
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,810
Stay out of my room
you little brat.

1432
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,100
Oh I don't do helmets.

1433
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:28,350
But this looks really pretty.

1434
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:36,180
Amazing. A completely
new direction for Jordan.

1435
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:37,610
Oh watch out!
Careful.

1436
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,030
Sorry. My assistant is
driving like a maniac today.

1437
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,380
Ok. Bye.

01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,440

Oh hi Brittany.

1481
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,150
I'm starting to think
that you were right.

1482
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,320
I should've waited.

1483
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,820
Oh and this is natasha.

1484
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,490

Hi.

01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:58,020
Oh before I forget...

1486
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,560
When I was on your phone
j-lo called.

1487
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,890
It's her birthday next week.

1488
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,290
Casual. No presents.
Thanks.

1489
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,810

canceled for tomorrow.

1490
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,560
Good. I'm so behind
on my homework.

1491
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,180
Think we can maybe uh...

1492
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,300
Oh sure.
Follow me.

1493
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,340
Oh here. I think
this belongs to you.

1494
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:16,890
Thank you.

1495
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:17,890

1496
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,280
pink just isn't my color.

1497
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,560

you were wearing

1498
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:21,840

1499
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,130

1500
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,420

That's not possible.

Well maybe not the whole world

1522
01:05:23,810 --> 01:05:27,010
that was supposed to
be a world premiere.

1523
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,750
We haven't even finished
shooting the video yet.

1524
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,550
Wait a second.

1525
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:33,580
These aren't even
the right words.

1526
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:36,620
Wait. These are
Jordan's lyrics.

1527
01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:40,360
And it says that he's
premiering it today.

1528
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,410
This afternoon.

1529
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:43,230
This afternoon? Ha!

1530
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,110
No no no.
There's no way.

1531
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,430
There's the bike!
They're in the park!

1532
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,650
Ah ha ha!

1533
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,190
Come on. Just give
the guy a break.

1534
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:58,770
Len this is wrong.
You can't do this.

1535
01:05:58,830 --> 01:05:59,980
He's got a right not to sing.

1536
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:01,580
Definitely he has
a right not to sing.

1537
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:04,310
He doesn't sing for me
he doesn't sing at all.

1538
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,750
Boys...

1539
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:08,280
No. Wait!

1540
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,260
Grr!

1541
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,060
Let go of me.

1542
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:15,360
Ok. Ok.

1543
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:30,420
Where are they?

1544
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,010
Sorry. Sorry.

1545
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,180
Um I'm not so sure about this.

1546
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:40,170
The singing or the driving?

1547
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,650
Both.

1548
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:42,890
But I'm trusting you two.

1549
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,250
I owe you that.

1550
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,890
You gave me my life back.

1551
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,060
And maybe ended your career...

1552
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:50,640
And life.

1553
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:52,280
Apologies.

1554
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,860
No. Not... not ended.

1555
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,530
Actually you brought it
full circle.

1556
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,100
This is where it began.

1557
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:59,070
You grew up here?
You grew up here?

1558
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,150
Hey.
Trying...To drive.

1559
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:04,490
Um no but a place
just like here.

1560
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:07,780
I spent the whole time
desperate to find a way out.

1561
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:10,280
Now that I'm out I...

1562
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:12,080
I don't know what
I'm searching for.

1563
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,720
An island of hope in
a sea of sameness?

1564
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:16,320
Hey that's pretty good.

1565
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:18,650
Do you uh do you mind
if I use that sometime?

1566
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,970
It's not mine.
It's Brittany's.

1567
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:21,190
She writes songs.
No I don't.

1568
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:22,310
She does too.
Does not. Does too.

1569
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,340
Do not. Does too.
Does not.

1570
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,090
Does too. Do not.
Does too.

1571
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,350
Ok. Maybe a little
but not like you.

1572
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,370
Well I certainly hope it's
something you're going to pursue.

1573
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,130
Eh. Someday
if I ever get out...

1574
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,710
You can be stuck
anywhere you know

1575
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:37,190
but you can't blame
the location.

1576
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:39,190
You can only blame yourself.

1577
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,480
Suburbs are just
a state of mind.

1578
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:43,910
Sorry.

1579
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:45,750
Are you sure you don't
want me to maybe...

1580
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,120
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

1581
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,830
Thanks but if you
could just not talk

1582
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,620
that would be great 'cause
I'm driving. Thanks.

1583
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,840
She has control issues.

1584
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,160
And legend has it

1585
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:01,410
that president Truman
once used the bathroom.

1586
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,730
And those are the 57 reasons

1587
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,140
why ashbrook house
is so important to me.

1588
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:10,470
But it's already 2:3...

1589
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,410
Actually I just thought
of another one. Ha ha.

1590
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:19,750
That brings us to number 58.

1591
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,950
Where's Jordan?

1592
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,180
Yeah.
We want Jordan.

1593
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,650
We don't care about
your stupid old house.

1594
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,960
Now just one minute.

1595
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:29,340
This house
is very important to me.

1596
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:31,260
Jordan or no Jordan.

1597
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:33,150
Did she just say "no Jordan"?

1598
01:08:33,230 --> 01:08:34,600
I knew it.

1599
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:35,830
We're so out of here.

1600
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,520
Right. Like Brittany actually
knows Jordan cahill.

1601
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,170
We want Jordan!

1602
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:41,870

1603
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:43,940

01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,390
You're drooling on yourselves.

1608
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,300
Hi. You must be
Brittany's mom.

1609
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:14,190
If you can give me
just like 2 minutes

1610
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:15,670
we're gonna try
to save your house.

1611
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,010
Sure. Um yeah.
Just uh...

1612
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,490
It's that...
where you...

1613
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,950
I'm Brittany's mom.

1614
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:25,280
I know.

1615
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:26,750
Congrats.

1616
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:33,960
Uh-oh.

1617
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:35,060
Trouble has just arrived

1618
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,590
on the wings
of a tacky minivan.

1619
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,030
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

1620
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:41,110
Isn't she fabulous?

1621
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,870
Mmm. Not half
as fabulous as you are.

1622
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,290
Thank you.

1623
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,500
Mom...
Mm.

1624
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,640
Ok. Sorry.

1625
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:51,140
Ease up there young lady ease up.

1626
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:55,830
Thank you.

1627
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:56,850
I'll take care of the press.

1628
01:09:56,910 --> 01:09:59,220
Exhaustion.
Publicity stunts?

1629
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,480
Ooh. Despondent over the
breakup with his girlfriend.

1630
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,340
Great. Sympathy factor.

1631
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,450
I want you to find Jordan

1632
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,540
and make sure he doesn't
go through with this.

1633
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,710
Yeah. Uh...
But how?

1634
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:09,220
You're his best friend Eddie.

1635
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,990
That should count
for something.

1636
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:13,260
Oh and Eddie
if you can pull this off

1637
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:15,770
I'm prepared to make you
part of the organization.

1638
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:17,020
Maybe even let you
manage the tour.

1639
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,270
I'm on it.
Mm-hmm.

1640
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,500
Come on Jordan.
The porch is this way.

1641
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:33,380
Uhh. How can you
be nervous?

1642
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:36,850
You were on the grammys.

1643
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,270
Yeah. I know but this
is all about me.

1644
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,160
It's... it's personal.

1645
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:46,730
And it's a really good feeling.

1646
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,600
I'll be fine.

1647
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:49,730
Thank you.

1648
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,970
No. Thank you.

1649
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,600
You know what?
Hang on just a second.

1650
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,600
I forgot something.

1651
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:56,260
I'll be right back.

1652
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,340
Jordan...

1653
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:00,540
What're you doing?

1654
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,280
I'm just doing
what I think is right.

1655
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:03,650
You want to
sacrifice everything

1656
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:05,210
that you've been working for?

1657
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,880
Everything that
we've been through?

1658
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:09,190
You realize this could
be the end for us.

1659
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:11,620
Yeah.
I realize that Eddie.

1660
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,890
I'm sorry.

1661
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,490
Fine. You do
what you gotta do.

1662
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,790
But I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

1663
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,460
Eddie wait!

1664
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:24,200
Ladies and gentlemen
if I could have your attention

1665
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:26,150
for just one second please.

1666
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,360
This should explain everything.

1667
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:31,890
I would like to introduce

1668
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,300
my best friend
in the whole world

1669
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,830
Mr. Jordan cahill.

1670
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,500
No!

1671
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,450
What is going on?

1672
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,680
I'd like to thank everyone
for coming out here today.

1673
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,780
I know this isn't
the biggest cause.

1674
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:51,760
It's not going
to change the world.

1675
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:55,100
But that doesn't mean
it's not important.

1676
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:58,020
We spend our whole lives
chasing after things.

1677
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:00,390
"I'd only be happy if"
dot-dot-dot.

1678
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,860
But I think a lot of the time

1679
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:05,130
we forget
what we're leaving behind...

1680
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,110
Our past our home

1681
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,950
what makes us unique.

1682
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:13,970
This song...

1683
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:16,490
Is dedicated to what's
special in all of us.

1684
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,870
It's not what's out there.

1685
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,640
