00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,168
Where's Declan?

186
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,919
I don't know, jail in Thailand?

187
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:41,754
That's not funny.

188
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,588
Rehab?

189
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,881
What is on your lip?

190
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:44,715
[Alex laughing]

191
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:48,343
Thank you for joining, Kel,
and I am growing my mustache.

192
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,344
On purpose?

193
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,637
What do you mean, yeah, on purpose.

194
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,889
- Thank you.
- Hey, let him live.

195
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,723
Let him live?

196
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,183
I'm giving him all the space he needs.

197
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,101
Okay, I'm here, what do you want?

198
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,394
Okay, Kip and I were talking,

199
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,147
and we both think that with
the show going back next month,

200
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,982
if we all band together, like they did-

201
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:04,068
- Yeah, like they did on "The Simpsons."

202
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:04,902
Good show.

203
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,779
Nope, like they did on "Friends,"

204
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,155
if we all band together

205
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,157
we could have a better
chance at getting more money.

206
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,159
Yeah, but we're all
in different amounts.

207
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,328
No, we would agree on
a percentage increase.

208
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,788
So say it's like 10%.

209
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,289
10% is like nothing.

210
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,792
I took "Peanuts" season one
because it was my first pilot.

211
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,169
Yeah, I mean, some
of us are on literally

212
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,712
a fifth of everybody else.

213
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,005
Yeah, but some of us have been

214
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,090
in more seasons than others.

215
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,883
Hey, what'd I miss?

216
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,427
Manners, apparently.

217
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,346
Okay, when people say 11, they mean 11.

218
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,222
Jesus Christ, Kip, Amber Alert.

219
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,557
[Declan and Max laughing]

220
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,683
Okay, guys, we're
talking about next season,

221
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,436
and we need to all band together

222
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,354
if we wanna get more money.

223
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:41,605
Are you guys stupid?

224
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:42,981
The show's getting canceled.

225
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,233
- Oh my god.
- What?

226
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,901
- What?
- Fuck you?

227
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:47,569
My agent called me yesterday.

228
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:48,404
Wait, no, how does he know?

229
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,738
Molly told me we were going back.

230
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,572
Yeah, me, too.

231
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,407
How can they

232
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,491
- just change their minds?
- No, no, no,

233
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,867
there's no way they're canceling the show

234
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:54,660
without telling me.

235
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,744
I am the lead.

236
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,538
I'm Belle, and I would know.

237
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,497
So I'm calling my agent.

238
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,999
My agent's brother-in-law
is the VP of the network,

239
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,543
so if anyone's gonna know it's him.

240
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,461
Oh, that's how you
stay on the show so long.

241
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,380
What are you pissy about?

242
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:08,132
You complained every
single day on that set.

243
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:08,966
You know what?

244
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,008
Just 'cause I didn't want to prance around

245
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,177
pretending to be a 14th century warrior

246
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,512
trapped in the body of a 17 year old

247
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:16,056
doesn't mean I don't like getting paid.

248
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,058
Oh my God, I just bought a new house.

249
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,268
You guys, I knew this was gonna happen

250
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,769
the second that Bobby
took over the network.

251
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,563
He doesn't see our show
for what it could be.

252
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,273
Yeah, I think it's I-E, not Y.

253
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,984
Oh, hey, congratulations on
your new gig in spell check,

254
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,193
the TV series.

255
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,445
That's not even a real fuckin' show.

256
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,780
Name's Bob-I-E Brower.

257
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:32,656
[Max laughing]

258
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,450
That's a stupid name.

259
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,703
Look, let's all think on
the bright side, guys.

260
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:38,537
Okay?

261
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,080
We can all start auditioning again.

262
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,250
Meaning I can show what I
can really do as an actor.

263
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,585
God.

264
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,587
That's exactly what somebody

265
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,839
who booked their first audition would say,

266
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,132
but that's okay, you should.

267
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,967
Okay, it wasn't my first.

268
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,302
It was my second.

269
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,928
Max, we can't audition.

270
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,888
We're not allowed to.

271
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,514
The studio owns us for another 12 months.

272
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,308
They're not gonna release
us from our contracts.

273
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,310
Okay, but if the show is canceled,

274
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,269
then technically-

275
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,437
- They'll keep us under contract

276
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,897
for as long as they can just in case.

277
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,565
Yeah, but in case of what?

278
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,108
I mean, how are we supposed to make money?

279
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,110
They'll give us a holding fee.

280
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,195
How much?

281
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,196
A few grand.

282
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,697
- What?
- Oh my god,

283
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:14,990
- I can't even.
- Look, I told you idiots

284
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:15,908
to save your money.

285
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,743
Oh, by the way, speaking of saving money,

286
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,453
Max, how's your new Porsche?

287
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:20,287
Ha ha.

288
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,498
Okay, I didn't know it
was like burn Max day.

289
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,208
But you know, I look dope in that car,

290
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,751
- so shut up.
- That's amazing,

291
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,086
'cause you're gonna be
living in it soon, so.

292
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,797
Oh my God, what am I gonna do?

293
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,798
You could always do

294
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,925
another banana bread
tutorial on Instagram.

295
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:33,759
[Declan laughing]

296
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:34,968
Oh yeah, the sourdough one was good.

297
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,095
You guys follow me?

298
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,930
No, I don't follow you on Instagram.

299
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,265
Guys, this is is bullshit.

300
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,476
I can't go back to go-go dancing.

301
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:45,020
Acting is the only real skill I even have.

302
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,397
And you barely have that.

303
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,481
What am I gonna do?

304
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:50,109
[gentle music]

305
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:57,866
We could keep making my movie.

306
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:58,867
[gentle music]

307
00:10:58,909 --> 00:10:59,868
Okay.

308
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,495
What movie?

309
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,997
Oh, I am trying my hand at writing.

310
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,125
I have this horror concept

311
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,293
- that's pretty-
- Yeah, but we're still

312
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,045
under contract, right?

313
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,547
No, we make it ourselves.

314
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:15,134
The scenes you guys
filmed were pretty good.

315
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,094
The scenes they filmed?

316
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:17,928
Uuuhhh.

317
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,682
Yeah, yeah, a few of 'em
helped me film some scenes

318
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,726
so I could just see what it sounded like.

319
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,560
A few of 'em.

320
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,437
And was that everyone?

321
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,312
Or just...

322
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,692
No, just Alex, Chrissy, and Max.

323
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,236
Just everyone.

324
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,071
He asked me too, but I said no.

325
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,114
Of course you did.

326
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,198
You know what, fuck you, Kip.

327
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,491
That is really mean.

328
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,325
[Declan laughing]

329
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,703
Come on, Kelly, it's not
like you would have done it.

330
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:43,829
I might have.

331
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,122
No, you wouldn't have.

332
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:46,874
Okay guys, can we all
just take a breath, please?

333
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,708
Together?

334
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,917
Good idea, everyone,

335
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,753
one, two, three.

336
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,505
[everyone inhaling]

337
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:54,798
Now let it go with a...

338
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,884
[Max groaning]

339
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,010
I can't concentrate.

340
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:58,886
Is he okay?

341
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,137
You sound like you're cumming.

342
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,597
Are you finished?

343
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,598
It works.

344
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,308
Okay, seriously guys, though.

345
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,934
Kip, if the writing

346
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,771
gets a little better,

347
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,898
just being honest, just being honest,

348
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,733
do you think that there
is something there?

349
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,360
I, to be honest, back at ya,

350
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,821
I really think we have something here.

351
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,406
The scenes you guys filmed were good.

352
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:22,785
And if we all did it and took it seriously

353
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,912
we could definitely sell it.

354
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,622
Especially if the show is canceled.

355
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,874
I mean, honestly,
our fans would love it.

356
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,125
- Yeah.
- Okay.

357
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,336
You know you need more than actors

358
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:33,629
and a script to make a movie.

359
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,172
You need financing.

360
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,423
You need a director.

361
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:37,466
Kelly, please.

362
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,842
Don't for one second pretend like you have

363
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,761
ever needed a director
in your entire career.

364
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,930
Okay, maybe I haven't needed
one, but you have needed one.

365
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,474
- Okay, wow.
- Okay, okay, guys, guys.

366
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:46,308
- If we keep doing-
- That's hostile.

367
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,309
- What we've been-
- Let's be nice.

368
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,977
We keep doing what we've been doing

369
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,313
and we just shoot it ourselves.

370
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,481
On what?

371
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,482
On our phones.

372
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,983
[Kelly laughing]

373
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,777
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

374
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:57,986
Okay, no, Kelly, listen, Kelly.

375
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:58,821
- Kelly, come on.
- Kelly, just listen,

376
00:12:58,862 --> 00:12:59,780
listen, listen, listen.

377
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:01,323
The new phones they shoot in 4k.

378
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,951
It's basically like, movie worthy.

379
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,744
Look, I'm not being
funny, but I was the lead

380
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,038
of one of the highest
grossing horror films in 2017.

381
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,998
And I'm just not making a home movie.

382
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,833
- So.
- Okay, well,

383
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:11,792
this is found footage,

384
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,585
so it doesn't matter if
the quality isn't the best.

385
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,671
Oh wait, I'm sorry, but
everybody always looks

386
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,214
super ugly in those movies.

387
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:20,676
Well just use your
ring light then, sweetie.

388
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,429
You know guys, I was
listening to Kevin Smith

389
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,972
on Joe Rogan's podcast last night,

390
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,348
- and he's-
- Oh god.

391
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,934
Was a mullet required to
listen to that episode or?

392
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:31,729
[group laughing]

393
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,357
Anyways, they were
explaining that there's

394
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,484
a lot of freedom in
filming your own stuff.

395
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,403
That's what everybody
who can't get a studio

396
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:40,904
to finance their movie says.

397
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,489
I'll go fuck myself then, Declan.

398
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,907
Okay, come on guys, come on.

399
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,159
This could really be something.

400
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,993
Okay?

401
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,703
We could be our own producers.

402
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:48,787
Call our own shots.

403
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,039
Nobody holding us down.

404
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:51,874
Okay.

405
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,584
I mean, there is
something to that, yeah?

406
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,877
Like taking a break from

407
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,046
the archaic patriarchal
system of Hollywood.

408
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,382
Look, I want to agree,
but what did you say?

409
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,051
Babe, I'm in.

410
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:02,885
[Kip clapping]

411
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:03,719
[Alex] Okay.

412
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,471
I don't understand
any of it, but I'm in.

413
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,805
That's what I'm talkin' about.

414
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,223
Declan?

415
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,516
Come on, dude.

416
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,350
Just do it.

417
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,268
- Sure, sure.
- Decky?

418
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,521
There's only so many times
you can jerk off in one day.

419
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:15,439
Gross.

420
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,024
Not proven scientifically.

421
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,651
Okay, one more, one more.

422
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,861
- Kelly.
- Kelly.

423
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,740
[Group] Kelly, Kelly Kelly.

424
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:26,909
What's it about?

425
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,743
What's it about?

426
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:30,120
Oh my god, okay, it's about,

427
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:36,001
it's about a spirit that
attacks people who sin.

428
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,671
That's literally everyone.

429
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,715
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

430
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:42,591
Okay, okay, all right.

431
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:43,425
Why don't we do this?

432
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,427
Why don't we all get the scene

433
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,262
and shoot it and then
we'll see what happens.

434
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,097
We'll see what's there.

435
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,139
Okay, perfect, perfect plan.

436
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:52,184
I'll just, I'll re-tweak it
and then we can go from there.

437
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:54,520
Great, and then send
it to us tonight, yeah?

438
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,064
No, I have to write it still.

439
00:14:57,106 --> 00:14:58,273
Yeah, yeah, well write it now,

440
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,817
and then send it to us tonight.

441
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,068
No, it's not that easy.

442
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,319
Dude, it's like 2 p.m.

443
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,405
Ooo, I'll make a Dropbox.

444
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,489
You download the app

445
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:07,449
and then you click the
add all new videos tab,

446
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,828
and then everything you film
will automatically upload.

447
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,579
That sounds dangerous.

448
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,831
Why?

449
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:14,665
I have some notes.

450
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,499
Can I be the lead?

451
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,251
Let's just meet again on Thursday.

452
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,377
Yeah, same time?

453
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,046
Ah, I dunno if I can, you
know I got Lesly Kahn 'til noon.

454
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,132
- [Declan laughing]
- I have Botox at 11, so 11-

455
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:23,966
- Lesly Kahn.
- What are you

456
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:24,800
fucking laughing at?

457
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:25,759
You do Botox?

458
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,261
Botox, Kelly?

459
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,095
What?

460
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:28,929
Wow.

461
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:29,763
I had no idea.

462
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:30,597
You look so natural.

463
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,267
Okay, guys, 2:30, Thursday.

464
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,184
Yeah?

465
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,185
- All right.
- Okay.

466
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:36,103
- Whatever.
- Bye.

467
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:37,229
- Peace and love babes.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait,

468
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,689
wait, wait, wait, wait.

469
00:15:38,731 --> 00:15:39,523
What?

470
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,859
[camera clicking]

471
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,985
- I was not ready.
- What was that?

472
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:43,819
You're gonna post that aren't you?

473
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:44,778
- Dude I-
- What the fuck?

474
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,612
You're gonna fucking post it.

475
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:46,488
I fucking know you are.

476
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,865
I need content for my Only Fans.

477
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:48,991
It pays my rent, fuck.

478
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,492
- Yo yo yo, tag me.
- Oh my God,

479
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:51,410
- please send it.
- No, don't tag me, okay?

[indistinct]

481
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:55,497

[intense music]

483
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,129
If anyone finds this
tell my mom and dad...

[intense music]

485
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,634
No, no, no, please, no.

[Max grunting and screaming]
[intense music]

487
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,228
It's good to be back.

488
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,606
No, this can't be happening.

489
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,317
Oh but it is.

490
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,236
[Chrissy gasping]

491
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,321
No, please.

492
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,032
Please please stop.

493
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:32,159
Why are you doing this?

494
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,035
No.

495
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:36,663
Oh wait, I gotta fix.

496
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:38,332
Oh my God.

497
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,588
Okay, I'm gonna take that again.

498

[sighing]

499
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,132
Cleansing breath.

00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:53,722
No, no, no, please.

502
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:59,269
Please, please, why are you doing this?

503
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:02,523
Stop, stop.

504
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,692
[Chrissy grunting]

No please, please don't do this.

[Alex laughing]
Don't do this please.

510
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:24,712
Please don't do this.

511
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,422
Oh, she's so scared.

512
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,007
Please don't do this.

513
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:29,842
Who are you crying for?

514
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,176
No no no no, I won't let you.

515
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:31,969
I won't let...

516
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,929
I won't let you?

517
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:35,347
I won't,

518
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:36,807
I won't let you.

519

I won't let you.

520
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:41,270
You're not in control anymore...

521
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:44,231
This, I mean, this feels so cliche.

522
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,569
Everyone else is doing this?

523

[Declan groaning]

524
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,657
Okay, I just, I wanted my family to know

525
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,243
that I loved them and I wish
I stayed in dental school.

526
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,119
I wish...

527
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,955
I won't let you.

[Chrissy laughing]

529
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:14,178
Well, you are not in control anymore.

530
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,220
Yes, I am.

531
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:18,974
This feels really stupid.

532
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,851
Like do I do voices?

534
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,775

I won't let you do this.

You're not gonna get me.

I won't let you do this.

542
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,333
This is, this is like a lot,

543
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:45,918

546
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:49,046
No.

547
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,175
Oh, don't don't, don't, stop, please.

548
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,804
[Max grunting and panting]

549
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,099
I wanna tell my mom
and dad that I'm sorry

550
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,642
that I didn't go to dental school.

551
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,144
[Declan laughing]

552
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,729
[Alex laughing]

553
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:06,814
[Chrissy laughing]

554
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,065
I'm just gonna ad lib something,

555
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:10,734
because I feel like that's, this is not-

556
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,152
- Dental school?

557
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,363
The only reason that I would
be going to dental school

558
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:16,698
is for the fucking gas.

559
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,826
I don't think they give
you that in dental school.

560
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,328
This demon has zero intention.

561
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,580
What, what is the point?

562
00:19:23,622 --> 00:19:25,416
What is the actual point of this demon?

563
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,793
Like, that's just, like fuck, dude.

564
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:28,794
I don't know,

565
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,337
I don't know what to play.

566
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,965
[Alex sighing]

567
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,551
It's not that, I'm just
saying that possession

568
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,468
is such a cliche.

569
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,429
And why are we all reading
the same character?

570
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,471
Dude, I asked that day one.

571
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:40,806
Okay, it's a work in progress, you guys.

572
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,016
And I'm just tryin' to
figure out everyone's flow.

573
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,518
Well, I thought Kelly did great.

574
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,352
Yeah, me, too.

575
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:46,562
I mean, it was super subtle,

576
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,814
- but like raw and organic.
- She did.

577
00:19:48,856 --> 00:19:49,732
Thank you.

578
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,525
But there's no way you're
releasing any of that

579
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,527
because the lighting
looks cheap and desperate,

580
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,905
and what's with the whole,
this is a true story thing?

581
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,449
I mean, the audience is gonna know

582
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,243
if we're actually dead, we're famous.

583
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,161
Most of us.

584
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,370
Can hear you, clearly.

585
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,873
Wait, do you guys actually
think the lighting looks cheap?

586
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,167
Because I really don't
want people to think

587
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,126
that I'm desperate.

588
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:10,794
You should probably
rethink a lotta things then.

589
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,004
[Max laughing]

590
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:12,838
- No, listen, Chrissy.
- Wait, what?

591
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,173
Don't worry, it's raw, okay?

592
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,507
If we do it black and white

593
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,800
everyone would think it's like art house.

594
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:17,634
Exactly.

595
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,845
Guys, it shows that we are serious actors

596
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:22,014
that only care about
the quality of the work.

597
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,140
Yeah, I mean, Allison Janney

598
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,808
didn't win her Oscar for "The Help"

599
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,602
when she was dripping in pearls.

600
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,520
She won it for "I, Tonya"

601
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,856
when she was literally
strapped to an oxygen tank.

602
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:31,732
Exactly.

603
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:33,984
Oh my God, that was Allison Janney?

604
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,069
Wow.

605
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,320
What?

606
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,907
Vanity aside, the plot's whack.

607
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,243
Like there's a spirit attacking
people with bad shit in them

608
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,078
- and then what?
- Exactly.

609
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:44,912
That's what's scary.

610
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:45,954
It's relatable.

611
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,414
It's relatable for about 20 minutes

612
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,916
and then you lose your audience.

613
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:52,503
I mean, people wanna be
challenged, not spoonfed.

614
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,381
You know, Lesly Kahn always says-

615
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,382
- [Declan and Kip laughing]
- Again.

616
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,050
What is the-

617
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,093
- Oh Christ.

618
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,012
what, what, what's so funny.

619
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,013
Nothing dude.

620
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:03,847
Well, how do you know

621
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:04,681
if someone's studies with Lesly Kahn?

622
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,100
- Don't, don't.
- They'll tell you.

623
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,476
[Alex laughing]

624
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:10,312
Well, you're an idiot.

625
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,230
Good one.

626
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,439
Okay guys, okay, okay, look,

627
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,857
Kelly does have a point, right?

628
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,402
We should give the characters
something to fight for.

629
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:18,904
So, I don't know how are
they gonna beat the spirit?

630
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,615
How do you beat something unbeatable?

631
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:22,950
Deep, Chrissy.

632
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:23,867
What is she doing?

633
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:26,286
Chrissy, why are you
talking to a necklace?

634
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,371
What?

635
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:30,249
Oh, this is actually a pendulum.

636
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,751
So it helps me make decisions.

637
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,337
I just ask it a yes or
no question, and then-

638
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,714
- You should be careful with that shit.

639
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,425
You never know who or what
you're calling on to answer it.

640
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,342
Those things are like

641
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:41,260
pretty little Oujia Boards that you wear.

642
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,094
What do you mean?

643
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:43,220
It's a necklace.

644
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:45,305
No, Kel, I got this at the Rose Bowl.

645
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,016
Okay, nothing bad ever
happens in Pasadena.

646
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,601
According to who?

647
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,145
Fine, how does it move?

648
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,979
Physics?

649
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,106
No, it connects to your higher self

650
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:55,774
- to give you divine guidance.
- Exactly.

651
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:59,319
Divine, also known as spirituality, God.

652
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,487
It's a conduit.

653
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:01,572
It's a necklace.

654
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,783
All I'm saying is, who's
pushing the pendulum?

655
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,995
Can't answer a door without opening it.

656
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,622
Wait, hold on, wait, wait,
wait, that's kinda good.

657
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:11,457
That might work.

658
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, who's pushing the pendulum?

659
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,168
Yeah, that's kinda great, Kel.

660
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,087
I mean, I wrote most of
my own stuff on "Belle," so.

661
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:20,382
So, what if our
characters use the pendulum

662
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:21,717
to summon a spirit to help them

663
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,886
banish the spirit that's attacking them?

664
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:25,345
Yeah, I love that.

665
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,599
I'm pretty sure that's not
how it actually works, guys.

666
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,476
I do have some experience in this field.

667
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:34,855
Oh, it'll be like "The
Craft" meets "Poltergeist."

668
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,315
I'm into it.

669
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,399
Just be careful, Kip.

670
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:41,111
'Cause supernatural stuff
gets so cheesy really quick.

671
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,655
Well actually, I might
have something, you know?

672
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,283
I saw it on Reddit the other day.

673
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,994
- Banishment curses.
- Banishment curses?

674
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:51,205
Why you lookin' up
banishment curses, Declan?

675
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:52,664
I was gonna send one to my agent.

676
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:53,499
Wow.

677
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,333
Yikes.

678
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:55,584
- [Alex laughing]
- You're so creepy.

679
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,294
I take back calling you an idiot,

680
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:58,128
'cause now I'm terrified.

681
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,089
- Just fire him.
- Here, here, here, here.

682
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,216
Someone read this.

683
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:03,258
I got it.

684
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:08,722
I call upon the darkness, for
only you can halt the attack.

685
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,392
I call upon your forces to take them away,

686
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:13,268
to take them back.

687
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,896
On the road to evil from my home to yours,

688
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:20,651
I consent to your power for
all the days and all the hours.

689
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:23,487
[loud banging and static]

690
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:24,488
What the fuck?

691
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,781
Okay, what the fuck?

692
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:27,324
That's a little on the
nose, don't you think?

693
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,450
Declan, did you do that?

694
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:29,743
That was amazing.

695
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:30,661
That was amazing.

696
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:33,705
I can play around with it a
little so it's not so obvious,

697
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,332
but that's good.

698
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,376
Great, so then we'll
just shoot the next scenes,

699
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:39,128
and then we'll see if we
can stitch some together.

700
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,629
- Cool, okay.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

701
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:41,672
I mean, yeah, it's not that easy.

702
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:42,715
You can't just put it together-

703
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,133
- Do we have a name yet?

704
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:47,970
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I was
thinking "The Reckoning."

705
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:48,929
No.

706
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:49,763
No.

707
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:50,681
- Why?
- I don't like it.

708
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:51,515
All around?

709
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:52,433
No, nobody?

710
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,892
Pendulum, "The Pendulum."

711
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,645
No, that's for sure not it.

712
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,105
"Untitled Horror Movie."

713
00:23:58,147 --> 00:23:59,523
- What?
- Meta.

714
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:00,357
This is weird.

715
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:01,775
No, when you Google it it's gonna be

716
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:03,402
the first thing that
comes up, that's genius.

717
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,529
Oh come on, you guys
come on, that's lame.

718
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:07,072
I mean, will people get it?

719
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,198
- It's funny.
- No, no, no,

720
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,783
but then, but then, who's
pushing the pendulum

721
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,076
could be the tagline.

722
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,745
That's kinda long for a hashtag.

723
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,413
Okay, all right, all right.

724
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:16,165
Well, Kelly, why don't you check with CAA?

725
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:17,249
See which one they like best.

726
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,417
I'm telling my agents about this.

727
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:20,002
They'll shut it down quicker

728
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:22,588
than the time it takes you to ejaculate.

729
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:23,964
- That is-
- Wow.

730
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:26,759
You know what, that's my cue.

731
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,719
- I'm for sure, bye guys.
- I don't.

732
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:30,679
Okay, peace and love.

733
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:31,847
- It's not that easy to write.
- Bye.

735
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,728

Reckoning" was way better.

00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:41,774
Hey, Kel, what's up?

738
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,236
Kel?

739
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:48,697
What do you think my
strengths are as an actor?

740
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,032
Oh Jesus, I.

741
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:52,367
I'm serious, I wanna know.

742
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:58,332
Okay, you're good at
making scenes feel real.

743
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,210
You always hit the emotional connection.

744
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,837
I mean, you can cry like nobody else,

745
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:06,757
- so that's good.
- Good, so you do know.

746
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,467
Now can you actually
write me some scenes

747
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,219
that show my range?

748
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,054
[Kip laughing]

749
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:13,263
Kelly, that's not really how it works.

750
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,808
You can't just tell a
writer what to write.

751
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,267
Of course you can.

752
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,852
Vin Diesel does it all the time.

753
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,854
I mean, why do you think The
Rock was in a hospital bed

754
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:25,901
for the entire "Fast Eight"
or "Furious 11" or whatever?

755
00:25:26,318 --> 00:25:27,152
What?

756
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,990
Look, you play a dick on the show.

If I wanna live,

I must involve the darkness.

It was very good.

But there are a couple things
that we need to talk about.

I don't really understand

something in a bowl?

00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:02,613
- What?
- What?

905
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,323
Max, what the fuck, dude?

906
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,199
You're so stupid.

907
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,033
What, guys?

908
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:06,950
It's a good thing.

909
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:08,911
They went nuts for it.

910
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:09,745
- Wait, Lionsgate?
- What?

911
00:31:09,787 --> 00:31:10,579
Yeah.

912
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:11,455
Like actual Lionsgate.

913
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:12,498
Lionsgate.

914
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:14,917
Yeah, Lionsgate, Lionsgate.

915
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,211
And she said that if we put together

916
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,629
about 15 minutes of the footage

917
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,923
she will walk it right
into the studio herself.

918
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:21,757
Puh!

919
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:22,591
[Kip laughing]

920
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:23,425
Oh my god.

921
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:24,259
What's that gonna cost us?

922
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:26,011
5% of the movie plus her producer credit?

923
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:26,929
Dude, it doesn't matter.

924
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:27,763
That's great news.

925
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:28,889
Thank you, Kip.

926
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:31,266
No, tell me you at
least colored it first.

927
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:32,101
Yeah.

928
00:31:32,142 --> 00:31:32,935
Well, I thought we were going for

929
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,686
the whole raw, "I, Tonya" thing.

930
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:35,938
Oh god.

931
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:36,855
Just 'cause it's raw doesn't mean it's-

932
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:38,816
- Oh I have this app that makes videos,

933
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,275
they look like super vibey.

934
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:41,693
Oh my god, it's amazing.

935
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:42,528
That's still-

936
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:43,487
- Are we mad about this or happy?

937
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:44,321
'Cause I don't really understand.

938
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:45,864
Listen, Max, it is awesome.

939
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:46,698
Happy.

940
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,866
- Yes, but.
- Okay, thank you.

941
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:48,867
I don't think we should sell it

942
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,119
to the first studio that wants it, right?

943
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,871
We should play the field,
start a bidding war.

944
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:55,416
No, that's, that's
actually a great point.

945
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:58,335
They're interested because
the stuff we shot was good.

946
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:01,338
And if they're interested,
then others will be, too.

947
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,172
- Exactly.
- So,

948
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:03,465
I'll finish writing a scene,

949
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,300
and then we could just
film some more stuff.

950
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:06,844
Great, just take your time.

951
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:07,678
Okay?

952
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,637
Don't rush it.

953
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,013
It needs to be good.

954
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,808
And Chrissy, how did you
do that shadow thing?

955
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:13,684
Oh yeah.

956
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:16,228
It was extra, but it worked, so.

957
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,604
What shadow thing?

958
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:18,439
Come on.

959
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,314
What?

960
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:20,149
what?

961
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,525
I'm sorry, guys.

962
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,152
- I don't know.
- Here we go again.

963
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:24,153
No, like I really don't know what

964
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,112
- you're talking about.
- Okay.

965
00:32:25,154 --> 00:32:25,946
We get it Chrissy,

966
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:26,780
- we get it.
- Keep your secrets.

967
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:28,031
- That's fine.
- Okay, bye.

968
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,576
- Peace out weirdos.
- Bye bye.

969
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:35,873
Kip, does she think we're stupid?

970
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:38,500
I mean, it's like, do you want
this thing to be good or not?

971
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,336
Listen, I don't think she knows
what we were talking about.

972
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:43,464
No, she used to do this
all the time in rehearsals.

973
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:44,673
She would phone it in,

974
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:46,467
and then she would pull out her choices

975
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:47,801
when the cameras were actually rolling.

976
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:49,428
Like I would ever steal from her.

977
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,930
Listen, Kelly, maybe she
just had a record player

978
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,850
and the light on it so when
it turned, it just made this,

979
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,894
I don't know, light on the wall

980
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:57,728
- or something.
- I actually,

981
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,604
I think I have one of those, I can-

982
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:01,482
- Wait, Kelly, just,
Kelly, let her have it.

983
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:04,985
Okay, you know you're gonna shine.

984
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:06,195
You always do.

985
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,157
You should come over.

986
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,242
We can practice the scenes.

987
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,703
I would but I have to work.

988
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,248
It's just that I'm so scared.

989
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,001
The scenes are so good and
I'm having trouble sleeping.

990
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,087
Okay, yeah, nice try.

991
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:25,631
Call me if you need me, okay?

992
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:26,757
I need you.

993
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,760
If you really need me.

994
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:35,682
And it's gone.

995
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:39,144
What, is it the mustache?

996
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:39,978
- Really?
- Goodnight, Kipper.

997
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,731
Oh my God, you guys are ridiculous.

998
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:45,526
[intense music]

999
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,247
I figured it out.

1000
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,167
It's you.

1001
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:07,965
I should've known.

1002
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:12,678
Penny, Penny, there is not one single day

1003
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:16,639
that goes by that I don't miss you.

1004
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:19,893
I wish we could just go back

1005
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:22,938
to sitting on the couch and watching TV

1006
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,150
like we had all the time in the world.

1007
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,402
Because we did.

1008
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:33,741
At least I thought we did.

1009
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,869
I know you're angry, and I'm sorry.

1010
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:44,126
I shoulda tried harder.

1011
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:47,420
[gentle music]

1012
00:34:47,463 --> 00:34:50,049
I shoulda been a better friend.

1013
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,512
If I could take it all back, I would.

1014
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:58,140
[gentle music]

1015
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:01,560
Penny, I miss you.

1016
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:05,939
I hate you for what you did,

1017
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:15,032
but it doesn't deny the
fact that I love you,

1018
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:17,326
and I probably always will.

1019
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:22,039
But maybe our love
just wasn't meant to be.

1020
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:29,338
Maybe our love was always
just meant to be free.

1021
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:32,383
The way that you are now.

1022
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,968
[gentle music]

1023
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,011
I'm sorry.

1024
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:39,890
I'm so sorry.

1025
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:42,976
I coulda done better.

1026
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,479
I should have done better.

1027
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:48,565
And as much as I wanna
see you and keep you,

1028
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:49,608
Penny, I, um...

1029
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:53,946
I have to let you go.

1030
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,074
It has to,

1031
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,785
it has to end here.

[thunder crashing]

1036
00:36:09,712 --> 00:36:10,671
You don't have to be like this.

1037
00:36:10,713 --> 00:36:12,756
[intense music]

1038
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:14,633
You don't have to be like this.

What the?

1043
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,267
I'm so sorry.

1044
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,268
It has to end here.

1045
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:25,894
[intense music]

1046
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,605
it has to end here, Penny.

1047
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,399
It has to end here.

1048
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:32,776

[Chrissy grunting]
[hand slapping]

1050
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:46,832
Did anyone see the weird
lightning last night?

1051
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:50,085
Like it wasn't raining,
but it was lightning.

1052
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:50,919
- No.
- Hmm-mmm.

1053
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,714
No, but dude, something
really strange happened

1054
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:54,590
while I was filming.

1055
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:55,799
I rolled camera and I'm

1056
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:56,967
- going into the scene-
- Where's Chrissy?

1057
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:59,678
It's really unprofessional
to keep people waiting.

1058
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,596
Hi Kelly.

1059
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:01,972
Is it Kelly?

1060
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:04,433
Unprofessional to keep people waiting?

1061
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:06,602
No, I haven't heard from her.

1062
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:07,895
She's probably still at rehearsal.

1063
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:08,812
Rehearsal?

1064
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:10,064
Wait, rehearsal for what?

1065
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,356
She kept talking about some play

1066
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:12,399
she was thinkin' of doing.

1067
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:15,110
Honey, if I had an Oscar for
every time I used that line

1068
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:16,320
- I'd be Meryl Streep.
- I'm sorry,

1069
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:17,946
Chrissy's doing a play?

1070
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:20,199
Yeah, she didn't tell you guys about it?

1071
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,533
She's been busy like all week.

1072
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:22,743
- Every time I've spoken to her.
- Yeah, no.

1073
00:37:22,785 --> 00:37:24,286
There's no way she's doing a play.

1074
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:25,788
You actually have to
have talent to do that.

1075
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,290
So that's a lie.
[Alex scoffing]

1076
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:29,124
Okay. Thank you, Kelly.

1077
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,668
I will try calling her really quickly.

1078
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,797
Okay, but not to be mean,
but does it really matter?

1079
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,258
I mean, she's not adding
that much value to the movie.

1080
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,093
- Declan.
- Dude.

1081
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:43,806
Declan, she's literally
one of the leads of our show.

1082
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:46,642
She's not the lead, though, so,

1083
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:47,976
people will still watch without her.

1084
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,019
Here we go.

1085
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:49,853
What?

1086
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:51,397
You guys would all get a pay raise, okay?

1087
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:52,439
So don't give me that.

1088
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:54,191
Oh, you are unbelievable.
You guys,

1089
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,068
you won't believe what
just happened to me.

1090
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,236
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- Oh my god, Chrissy, what?

1091
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,445
Babe, what happened to your eye?

1092
00:37:58,487 --> 00:37:59,279
Are you okay?

1093
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,197
Are you doing a play?

1094
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,031
- Who's directing?
- What?

1095
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:01,949
- Oh my god.
- Kelly.

1096
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,910
No, I'm not doing,
listen to me, you guys.

1097
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:08,372
I was, I was trying to
shoot one of the scenes,

1098
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:10,833
and all of a sudden, I don't,

1099
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,584
I don't even know how to say it.

1100
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:17,089
[Chrissy crying and hyperventilating]

1101
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:20,426
Chrissy, we can't
understand you if you overact.

1102
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,468
You gotta bring it down.

1103
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,678
Just like a little bit.

1104
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,680
Just give yourself somewhere to go.

1105
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:27,725
Okay, okay, you guys, just listen.

1106
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,519
I was doing this scene,

1107
00:38:30,561 --> 00:38:34,815
and all of a sudden I just
started slapping myself.

1108
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:38,736
Like I couldn't stop.

1109
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:41,363
I was so scared, you guys.

1110
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:42,948
And it was just my hand to do

1111
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,160
over and over and over and over.

1112
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,620
Chrissy, Chrissy, Chrissy, me, too.

1113
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:49,455
Me, too.

1114
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:52,624
I punched myself right in the chin.

1115
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,084
And it's like it took over me.

1116
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:57,254
I only did it once and
I think I passed out,

1117
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:59,631
but I decided when I got up

1118
00:38:59,673 --> 00:39:02,676
that I needed to use this in the scene.

1119
00:39:02,718 --> 00:39:05,012
Ah, you're a fuckin' pro, Max.

1120
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:06,013
What?

1121
00:39:06,055 --> 00:39:07,264
That's one name for it.

1122
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:08,474
Thanks, Kip.

1123
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:12,561
Chrissy, are you, babe are you okay?

1124
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:15,147
Do you need me to come over?

1125
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:17,441
No, I'm gonna be fine.

1126
00:39:17,483 --> 00:39:18,901
I think.

1127
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:23,113
I told you not to
mess with the dark arts.

1128
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:24,740
What?

1129
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:25,574
Oh my god.

1130
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:26,992
Is this Hogwarts?

1131
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,244
Okay, you guys, maybe,

1132
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:31,038
maybe, Chrissy, maybe your performance

1133
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,957
was just so good that
you got carried away.

1134
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:35,000
You know?

1135
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:35,959
Been there.

1136
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,002
Is that a thing?

1137
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:38,462
Oh totally.

1138
00:39:38,504 --> 00:39:40,422
- Yes.
- Yeah, of course.

1139
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:42,883
You're just so in the scene
you get lost in the moment.

1140
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,636
You're just so in character
you lose track of everything.

1141
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:48,222
It's like performance amnesia.

1142
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:49,681
You guys actually think?

1143
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:52,142
Definitely, like a hundred percent.

1144
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:52,976
Totally.

1145
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:54,603
How is there any doubt about this, guys?

1146
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:56,939
I mean, do you not
remember season two finale?

1147
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,940
When I was under that curse,

1148
00:39:57,981 --> 00:40:00,567
the big scene, Universal
backlot, right by "Jaws."

1149
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,277
You remember?

1150
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:03,404
What?

1151
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:04,321
Anyways.

1152
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:07,366
I really started to
believe that I was evil.

1153
00:40:07,408 --> 00:40:09,535
I mean, my mom wouldn't
talk to me for like a week.

1154
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,412
That feels very unrelated.

1155
00:40:11,453 --> 00:40:13,205
It's in the same lane, but okay.

1156
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:14,081
Kelly?

1157
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,042
Kel?

1158
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,839
Yeah, yeah.

1159
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,592
A few years ago I trained
with the USC diving team

1160
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:28,345
for this aquatic film I was doing,

1161
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:32,599
and well for like a month,
I thought I was a diver.

1162
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:34,810
Wow.

1163
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:39,106
All right, listen, why
don't we all take tonight off?

1164
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:41,942
It feels like that's much needed.

1165
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,444
Kip can work on another scene,

1166
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:46,113
and then we will chat again tomorrow.

1167
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:47,030
- Okay?
- Yeah,

1168
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:47,865
Yeah, sure.

1169
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:49,283
Okay, thank you guys so much.

1170
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:52,161
I'm sorry I like freaked out.

1171
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,579
[Chrissy laughing]

1172
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,290
Oh my god, it's also like a full moon,

1173
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:59,793
and so maybe I just got like, so in it.

1174
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:00,919
Isn't it daytime?

1175
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,963
Anyway, I'm gonna go cleanse my aura,

1176
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:05,215
- do a face mask, just TLC.
- Move your,

1177
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:06,759
Move your crystals around the house.

1178
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,593
Bye.

1179
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:08,427
- Bye.
- Don't go chasing waterfalls.

1180
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:12,181
- [Alex laughing]
- Okay, bye.

1181
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:15,392
What the fuck is going on?

1182
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:17,227
What?

1183
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,979
No, don't treat me like an actor.

1184
00:41:19,021 --> 00:41:20,856
We all know that method acting is just

1185
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:23,358
made up shit to justify bad behavior.

1186
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,819
Who's being naughty costars
having secret meetings then?

1187
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:28,697
Okay, we're not, we're just,
we just haven't hung up yet.

1188
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,408
We're not having a meeting, Declan.

1189
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,036
Shit's goin' down isn't it?

1190
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:36,038
Oh my god, it is.

1191
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,248
Fuck, I knew I wasn't tripping last night.

1192
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,501
Like I was tripping,
but I wasn't tripping.

1193
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:41,335
Declan, this isn't funny.

1194
00:41:41,377 --> 00:41:42,169
Okay, it's serious.

1195
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:43,629
Yeah, she obviously got carried away.

1196
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,005
I mean, if anybody's gonna do it

1197
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:46,090
it's gonna be a bunch of actors.

1198
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,216
Well, I didn't get carried away.

1199
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:48,717
We all know I'm not that good.

1200
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:49,635
Exactly.

1201
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,512
No, I felt something
weird last night, too.

1202
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:54,640
Okay, I just felt like
this wind wash over me.

1203
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,893
Did you maybe leave a
window open, possibly?

1204
00:41:57,935 --> 00:42:00,145
Kip, you know how
sensitive I am to this stuff?

1205
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:01,772
Okay, so don't-
[Kip laughing]

1206
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:04,983
Okay, what are you saying then, Kel?

1207
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,277
Are you really gonna make me say it?

1208
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,029
I'll say it.

1209
00:42:09,071 --> 00:42:10,739
Something ooky spooky's goin' on.

1210
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:13,909
[laughing] oh come, Come on, you guys.

1211
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:16,370
I mean, Kelly, what's more believable?

1212
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:18,580
Chrissy overacting or that she's

1213
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:20,999
boxing with zombies in her apartment.

1214
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:23,127
Don't play to the judge, okay?

1215
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:24,336
That's actually a good idea.

1216
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:25,921
That would make a good movie.

1217
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:27,297
You know, like a bunch of people

1218
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:28,799
go out to make a horror movie

1219
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,301
and then real shit
starts happening to them.

1220
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:32,845
It feels very meta.

1221
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,179
One too many metas.

1222
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:35,681
You know, this is making me think

1223
00:42:35,723 --> 00:42:38,267
that that shadow she
did, that it wasn't fake.

1224
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,101
True.

1225
00:42:39,143 --> 00:42:40,185
Oh, Kel, come on.

1226
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:41,895
You saw Alex's tape from last night.

1227
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:43,814
She did the exact same thing.

1228
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:44,648
Me, what?

1229
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,774
No, I didn't.

1230
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:47,568
What?

1231
00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:48,569
- I didn't.
- Wait, are you,

1232
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,403
are you kidding?

1233
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:50,237
Are you fucking with me?

1234
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,113
No, I'm being,

1235
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:52,406
no I'm being serious.

1236
00:42:52,448 --> 00:42:53,407
What are you talking about?

1237
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:54,867
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1238
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:55,701
You guys are crazy.

1239
00:42:55,743 --> 00:42:57,953
Here, let, I'll pull it up.

1240
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,461
What the fuck is that?

1241
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:06,420
Wait.

1242
00:43:06,462 --> 00:43:08,672
Zoom in and enhance that.

1243
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,007
- I can't-
- Oh my god.

1244
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:11,508
She does one episode of CSI

1245
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,053
and thinks zoom in and
enhance it is a thing.

1246
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:17,222
Okay, I mean, it's
obviously the ceiling fan.

1247
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:18,849
You guys, they just installed the light

1248
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,059
too close to the fan, right?

1249
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,018
- Are you serious?
- So you didn't,

1250
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,144
you didn't make that,

1251
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:23,353
- you didn't make that shadow?
- Okay, you know what?

1252
00:43:23,395 --> 00:43:25,147
You guys are tryin' to scare
me and it's not gonna work.

1253
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:25,981
I'm leaving.

1254
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:27,232
- Bye.
- You two are just fucked.

1255
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:28,067
Okay?

1256
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:28,901
You're fucked.

1257
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:30,736
Both of you, fucked.

1258
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:31,779
And let me tell you something,

1259
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,447
I don't like this one bit.

1260
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:34,281
Okay, close your window

1261
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:36,909
- before you go to bed.
- Goodbye.

1262
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:40,871
Personally, and this is just me,

1263
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:43,791
but I think it's fucking great.

1264
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,834
I know [laughing].

1265
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:46,960
We are losing it.

1266
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,630
[intense music]

1267
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:52,341
[phone ringing]

1268
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,804
Kip, what time is it?

1269
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:00,015
I'm sorry, it's late
or early, I don't know.

1270
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:02,101
Look, something really
weird just happened.

1271
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:03,727
What?

1272
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:06,438
Chrissy just uploaded a video.

1273
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:08,607
So call Chrissy.

1274
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:12,361
No, listen, she's sleeping in the video.

1275
00:44:12,403 --> 00:44:14,863
It's like the camera's
moving, but she's sleeping.

1276
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:17,950
It's really fucking creepy.

1277
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,660
Come on, that doesn't make any sense.

1278
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:21,620
You can't upload footage

1279
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:22,454
- when you're unconscious.
- No, that's

1280
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:23,497
not what I'm saying.

1281
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:25,040
It's just, I don't know.

1282
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:28,460
It looks like someone else is there.

1283
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,087
What do you mean?

1284
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:32,965
- Okay, hold on.
- Just send it to me.

1285
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,425
I'm gonna show you.

1286
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:39,471
[intense music]
[clock ticking]

1287
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:10,961
[dark intense music]
[clock ticking]

1288
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:33,067
Damn, I mean, she really went for it.

1289
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:35,194
I mean, she's good.

1290
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:36,153
Have you shown Kelly?

1291
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:37,613
She's gonna shit her pants.

1292
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:40,282
No, no, I didn't show Kelly.

1293
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:41,450
No.

1294
00:45:41,492 --> 00:45:42,534
I mean, come on, Kip,

1295
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,912
she obviously just got Max to
go over there and shoot it.

1296
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:46,371
And I mean, it works.

1297
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:47,414
It's a hell of a lot better

1298
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:49,917
than just holding the camera yourself.

1299
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:54,630
Okay, yeah, but no, that's
that's not like Chrissy.

1300
00:45:54,671 --> 00:45:57,132
I mean, she wouldn't do that.

1301
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:59,093
What, you think it's Casper?

1302
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,345
I mean, what, who are you, Kelly?

1303
00:46:01,387 --> 00:46:04,306
Okay, I'm not saying
it's a ghost or something.

1304
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:07,643
It's just, I don't know, it's
not like Chrissy to do that.

1305
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:10,354
And it's really frickin' creepy.

1306
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:14,191
Fine, just call the others.

1307
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,987
[call disconnecting]

1308
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:24,743
Sorry for waking you,
Kip's having a fit.

1309
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,370
It's all good.

1310
00:46:26,412 --> 00:46:27,871
I was just chasin' the worm.

1311
00:46:27,913 --> 00:46:29,331
Who still smokes?

1312
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:30,791
[Max laughing]

1313
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,376
You said worm.

1314
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:35,045
Well, there he is, our
very own Dean Cundey.

1315
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:36,630
[Max yawning]

1316
00:46:36,672 --> 00:46:38,048
Who is Dean Cundey?

1317
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,509
Dude, he shot "Halloween,"

1318
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:41,343
"Back to the Future,"

1319
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:42,594
"Jurassic Park."

1320
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:44,888
Oh my God, what the fuck
is Lesly teaching you?

1321
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,056
Don't speak to-

1322
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:47,474
- Okay, where's Chrissy?

1323
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:49,727
He said he doesn't
know, he hasn't seen her.

1324
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:50,686
Bullshit.

1325
00:46:50,728 --> 00:46:52,062
I swear on my mother's life.

1326
00:46:52,104 --> 00:46:53,355
I just woke up.

1327
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:54,189
Do you see-

1328
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:56,608
- [indistinct]
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, Max.

1329
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,318
Swear on Lesly's.

1330
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,154
[Declan laughing]

1331
00:47:00,195 --> 00:47:03,615
Have any of you even tried to call her?

1332
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:05,993
Seriously?

1333
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:08,412
Oh my God, what the fuck
is wrong with all of you?

1334
00:47:08,454 --> 00:47:11,373
Okay, Max, if she's not
with you, then who is?

1335
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:12,916
Why do you keep asking me?

1336
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,168
Yo?

1337
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:16,420
Yeah, get in the meeting room.

1338
00:47:16,462 --> 00:47:17,379
Okay, bye.

1339
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:18,422
She's coming.

1340
00:47:18,464 --> 00:47:19,840
So she's fine.

1341
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:20,883
She's fine.

1342
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:25,554
Will someone please tell
me what the hell is going on?

1343
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:26,513
I was asleep.

1344
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:28,098
Do you know how many pills I had to take

1345
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,433
to make that happen?

1346
00:47:29,475 --> 00:47:31,685
A pharmacy worth.

1347
00:47:31,727 --> 00:47:33,145
Look, there she is.

1348
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,646
- Hey, guys.
- Chrissy.

1349
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:35,898
- Hi.
- Are you okay?

1350
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:37,024
Yeah, I'm fine.

1351
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:38,901
Mmhmm, oh my God, you guys.

1352
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:40,235
I had the best dream.

1353
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,029
I'm gonna journal it later as soon as

1354
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:43,697
- we're done with this.
- Are you alone right now?

1355
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:45,657
Yes, Max, I am alone.

1356
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:48,410
What kind of a question is that?

1357
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:49,411
Listen, a video of you

1358
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:50,746
- got uploaded to-
- What?

1359
00:47:50,788 --> 00:47:52,039
What video?

1360
00:47:52,081 --> 00:47:54,208
I swear, I deleted all those.

1361
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:55,376
No.

1362
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:56,794
Oh my god, the one time I drank tequila.

1363
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:57,628
Wait, wait, wait a minute,

1364
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:58,545
let's talk about that for a minute.

1365
00:47:58,587 --> 00:47:59,380
- What?
- No, Chrissy,

1366
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:01,006
it was a video of you sleeping.

1367
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:03,717
Yeah, it was like an hour ago.

1368
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:05,761
Wait, what?

1369
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:09,681
Okay, all right, hold on.

1370
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:11,809
Let me pull it up.

1371
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:12,893
I don't.

1372
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:13,727
What videos were you-

1373
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:15,145
- I'm confused.

1374
00:48:15,187 --> 00:48:15,979
Me, too.

1375
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:18,857
[intense music]

1376
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,609
[Chrissy] Oh my God, that's my house.

1377
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:21,860
[intense music]

1378
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:23,612
Okay, who's filming it, though?

1379
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:24,822
Like what the?

1380
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:26,865
Chrissy, you're obviously doing that.

1381
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:28,242
It's not me.

1382
00:48:28,283 --> 00:48:29,743
It's like so weird.

1383
00:48:29,785 --> 00:48:31,578
[intense music]

1384
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,538
[Alex] Cute jacket.

1385
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:35,332
[intense music]

1386
00:48:37,501 --> 00:48:38,544
You see?

1387
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:39,586
Oh my god.

1388
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,715
Wait a minute.

1389
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:43,549
You-

1390
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,383
- See it's not me.
- Come on, Max.

1391
00:48:44,425 --> 00:48:46,927
- I told you.
- That's not you?

1392
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:51,515
[Declan] Whoa, what the fuck?

1393
00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:54,226
[intense music]

1394
00:48:55,394 --> 00:48:57,146
I didn't film that.

1395
00:48:57,187 --> 00:48:57,980
What the fuck?

1396
00:48:58,021 --> 00:48:58,897
[intense music]

1397
00:48:58,939 --> 00:48:59,940
- Oh my god, guys.
- Was it?

1398
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:01,108
I didn't film that.

1399
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:01,984
I told you all,

1400
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:04,528
but nobody ever trusts a pretty blonde.

1401
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,529
Fuckin' told you.

1402
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:06,363
What am I gonna do?

1403
00:49:06,405 --> 00:49:07,614
Okay, okay, we need to calm down, okay?

1404
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:08,449
- Okay-
- No, no,

1405
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:09,533
we do not need to be calm.

1406
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:11,118
We need to call the cops right now.

1407
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,661
Whoever did that could
still be in your house.

1408
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,495
What?

1409
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:14,705
Why would you say that to her?

1410
00:49:14,747 --> 00:49:16,790
911, Chrissy, now.

1411
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:18,584
Max, Max, this isn't funny anymore.

1412
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,044
If you were actually there
and you actually shot it,

1413
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:21,045
- fucking say something.
- I'm not fuckin',

1414
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:22,463
why am I fucking around
tell her to call the cops?

1415
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:23,297
I'm not kidding.

1416
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:25,090
[Dispatcher] 911,
what is your emergency?

1417
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:27,760
Hi, yeah, is this 911?

1418
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:28,594
What?

1419
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:29,678
- Wait, shit.
- Chrissy.

1420
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,512
- Fuck.
- Where'd she go?

1421
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:31,346
Where'd she go, where'd she go?

1422
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:32,181
- Where'd she go?
- Somebody call her.

1423
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:33,348
Somebody call her.

1424
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,391
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1425
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:35,225
It's not gonna work

1426
00:49:35,267 --> 00:49:36,393
if we're all calling her at the same time.

1427
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:37,227
Good point, Declan.

1428
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:39,354
Well, who's calling?

1429
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:40,606
I am, just hold on.

1430
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:41,857
Okay, she's calling me.

1431
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:44,276
Hey, what the fuck happened?

1432
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:47,029
My computer died, sorry.

1433
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:48,739
Oh my god.

1434
00:49:48,781 --> 00:49:50,282
Her computer died.

1435
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,743
Jesus.

1436
00:49:52,785 --> 00:49:53,702
Oh god.

1437
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:54,995
Are you okay?

1438
00:49:56,205 --> 00:49:58,373
Yeah, I mean, no,

1439
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:00,501
but they're sending cops.

1440
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:02,836
They're sending a cop.

1441
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:04,046
Oh God.

1442
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:07,424
Declan, Declan, I don't know what to do.

1443
00:50:07,466 --> 00:50:09,051
Why did you hang up from the police?

1444
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:10,928
To call you guys back.

1445
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:11,887
This is super fucked,

1446
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:12,721
- you guys.
- I don't think

1447
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:13,555
we can help you.

1448
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:16,517
Ask her if she wants me
to go over to her house.

1449
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:18,560
I can see you, dickhead.

1450
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:22,731
Max wants to know if
he should come over.

1451
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:23,941
[loud banging]
[everyone gasping]

1452
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:24,775
What was that?

1453
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:25,609
What was that?

1454
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:26,443
What the fuck?

1455
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:28,153
Shhh, shhh, you guys, guys.

1456
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:29,321
What the fuck was that?

1457
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:31,156
I think somebody's in my room.

1458
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:33,200
[intense music]

1459
00:50:33,242 --> 00:50:35,285
- What's she saying?
- What's going on?

1460
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:36,120
Declan, talk to us.

1461
00:50:36,161 --> 00:50:38,330
What's happening, man?

1462
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:40,958
Is she using the pendulum again?

1463
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,669
No, stop using that thing.

1464
00:50:43,711 --> 00:50:45,963
Okay, I'm gonna look.

1465
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:46,922
No, no, no.

1466
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:47,756
- Did she just say she was gonna look?
- No no no.

1467
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:48,966
[Group] No no no no.

1468
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:50,884
- Stay where you are.
- No.

1469
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:51,719
Chrissy.

1470
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,513
[intense music]

1471
00:51:02,354 --> 00:51:03,981
Can you tell her to
stop shaking the camera?

1472
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:05,607
Kelly, shut the fuck up.

1473
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:07,192
What, it's making me nauseous.

1474
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:08,986
Chrissy, just get the fuck out of there.

1475
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:09,820
I am trying.

1476
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:10,654
Would you be quiet?

1477
00:51:10,696 --> 00:51:13,449
[intense music]

1478
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:21,957
[Declan] Oh sweet Jesus, what is that?

1479
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:25,002
- Don't put it down.
- Shut up, Declan.

1480
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:27,796
[Chrissy exhaling]

1481
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,006
I trained for this.

1482
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:31,300
- Oh god, no.
- No, no, no.

1483
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:33,761
Just because you played a ninja on TV.

1484
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:34,845
Why do you have that?

1485
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:36,346
What could she possibly do with that?

1486
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:38,182
Why do you have a samurai sword?

1487
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:39,933
Relax you guys.

1488
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:41,268
The stunt guy said that I was good enough

1489
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,686
to be a professional.

1490
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:44,480
No, he had to say that to you.

1491
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:45,606
They were being nice.

1492
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:49,151
That was pretend fighting, Chrissy, no.

1493
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:51,361
[loud banging]
[Chrissy gasping]

1494
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:52,863
- Christ.
- Shit.

1495
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:54,031
[Declan] What was that?

1496
00:51:54,073 --> 00:51:54,865
Chrissy, what was that?

1497
00:51:54,907 --> 00:51:57,159
It came from the kitchen.

1498
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:00,370
Well don't go in there.

1499
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:01,371
Get your stuff and get out of the house.

1500
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:03,457
Get out of the house.

1501
00:52:03,499 --> 00:52:05,584
Jesus, Chrissy, what are you doing?

1502
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:07,544
Why are you looking for him?

1503
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:08,420
Run.

1504
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:13,509
[loud banging]
[Chrissy grunting]

1505
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,344
[quiet intense music]

1506
00:52:15,386 --> 00:52:17,846
Is that thing even sharp?

1507
00:52:17,888 --> 00:52:18,722
Um,

1508
00:52:21,517 --> 00:52:22,559
no.

1509
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:24,812
Kip, Kip, Kip, you should
be writing all this down.

1510
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:26,480
Are you kidding me right now?

1511
00:52:26,522 --> 00:52:27,314
Now is not the time.

1512
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:28,148
Don't worry about it.

1513
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:28,982
I'm on it.

1514
00:52:29,024 --> 00:52:29,942
Oh you piece of shit.

1515
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:31,110
Okay, you're not getting
a writing credit, though.

1516
00:52:31,151 --> 00:52:32,277
I'm just saying.

1517
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,406
[Chrissy grunting]

1518
00:52:35,447 --> 00:52:36,740
But this is.

1519
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:38,367
- Oh my God, oh my God.
- No, no, no.

1520
00:52:38,409 --> 00:52:39,660
- Now we're talking, yes.
- You should not be allowed

1521
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:40,953
- to play with grown up knives.
- Yes.

1522
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:42,496
Be careful you don't stab yourself.

1523
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:45,416
Okay, listen, Declan,
tell those assholes

1524
00:52:45,457 --> 00:52:47,876
that I can still hear them.

1525
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:48,752
Kinda.

1526
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:52,589
She says she can still hear you guys.

1527
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:56,552
[gentle intense music]

1528
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:59,430
[Chrissy gasping]

1529
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:15,154
[Chrissy laughing]

1530
00:53:15,195 --> 00:53:19,032
Okay, honestly, I am
literally losing my mind.

1531
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:22,035
No, I don't, I don't,

1532
00:53:22,077 --> 00:53:22,953
I don't think you are.

1533
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:24,204
I heard something, too.

1534
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:26,832
Declan, there is nobody here.

1535
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:31,253
Are you guys playing a trick on me?

1536
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:33,213
No, you just need to go
back to your room, and-

1537
00:53:33,255 --> 00:53:34,131
- These pranks aren't funny, okay?

1538
00:53:34,173 --> 00:53:35,674
[door banging]
[intense music]

1539
00:53:35,716 --> 00:53:36,550
Shit.

1540
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:39,053
Fuck.

1541
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:41,889
[door banging]

1542
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,348
I think it's the cops.

1543
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:44,433
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1544
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:45,684
That was way too quick.

1545
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:46,518
Don't answer it.

1546
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,270
The police are here, it's fine.

1547
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,646
[Declan] Chrissy, don't answer it.

1548
00:53:49,688 --> 00:53:51,106
Declan-

1549
00:53:51,148 --> 00:53:51,899
- Okay, wait, wait-
- No no no,

1550
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,733
- don't put your phone down.
- Chrissy,

1551
00:53:52,775 --> 00:53:53,567
maybe you should just-

1552
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:54,401
- Just bring it with you so we can-

1553
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:56,278
- Bring your phone, bring your phone.

1554
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,072
Also, no more shrooms.

1555
00:53:58,113 --> 00:53:59,156
Who else would it be?

1556
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:00,032
Come on.

1557
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,119
[Max] Guys, I don't like
this, I don't like this.

1558
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:06,330
Can someone call the cops?

1559
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:08,582
[Chrissy] Wait, no.

1560
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:09,416
[Chrissy screaming]

1561
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:12,127
[intense music]

1562
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:16,048
Chrissy.

1563
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:20,177
Oh my god, oh my god, no.

1564
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:22,888
[intense music]

1565
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:25,015
What are you doing?

1566
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:26,266
Chrissy, stop doing that!

1567
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:29,269
[intense music]

1568
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:30,104

Chrissy.

1571
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:39,863
What just happened?

1572
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:41,657
What is happening?

1573
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:44,660
[intense music]
[knuckles crackling]

1574
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:45,953
What the?

1575
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:48,914
[intense music]
[knuckles crackling]

1576
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:49,706
What the fuck?

1577
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:50,541
What the fuck?

1578
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:53,252
[intense music]

1579
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,345
What the fuck was that?

1580
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:07,599
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1581
00:55:07,641 --> 00:55:09,560
Oh my god, oh my god.

1582
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:13,480
I just, I just saw someone die.

1583
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:16,483
Oh god.

1584
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,320
Okay, I'm gonna call the cops.

1585
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:23,031
That was fuckin' weird.

1586
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:24,658
Where's Alex?

1587
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,076
I am never gonna unsee that.

1588
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:27,953
I'm gonna have to carry
that with me forever.

1589
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:29,913
Shut up, where's Alex?

1590
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:32,040
- Guys, guys, I'm so sorry.
- Oh my god.

1591
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:34,293
- I'm so sorry.
- Where did you go?

1592
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:35,836
ALl of my power went out.

1593
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:37,129
Like even my phone.

1594
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:37,963
I don't know what happened.

1595
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:38,797
That was so weird.

1596
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:39,631
Dude, not cool.

1597
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:40,466
What did I miss?

1598
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:41,300
Is Chrissy okay?

1599
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:42,134
No, Chrissy's dead.

1600
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:42,968
Dead?

1601
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:43,802
What do you mean dead?

1602
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:44,636
She's fine.

1603
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:45,471
What?

1604
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:46,305
What?

1605
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:47,139
She's fine.

1606
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:48,223
The police said that she called back

1607
00:55:48,265 --> 00:55:51,101
three minutes after the
original call to cancel it.

1608
00:55:51,143 --> 00:55:52,144
Wait what?

1609
00:55:52,186 --> 00:55:52,978
No.

1610
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:53,812
We fuckin' saw it.

1611
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:57,107
No, no, I was still on
the phone to her then.

1612
00:55:57,149 --> 00:55:58,776
It would have been after you hung up.

1613
00:55:58,817 --> 00:55:59,985
What an asshole.

1614
00:56:00,027 --> 00:56:01,070
Why would she do that to us?

1615
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:03,572
Will someone please
tell me what is going on?

1616
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:08,619
Chrissy was strangled with her own hand.

1617
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:09,703
Okay, you guys,

1618
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:10,746
- this is really fucked up.
- And then-

1619
00:56:10,788 --> 00:56:11,663
- You know what?

1620
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:12,498
I'm goin' over there.

1621
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:13,332
Oh geez.

1622
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:14,792
Declan, come on man.

1623
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:16,043
That's not a good idea.

1624
00:56:16,085 --> 00:56:19,171
No, that does not sound
like a good idea at all.

1625
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:21,173
I mean, what if there's
someone still in the house?

1626
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:22,049
Who?

1627
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:23,717
[door shutting]

1628
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:24,968
And there he goes.

1629
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:28,764
Look, I am just saying, okay, Declan

1630
00:56:28,806 --> 00:56:31,141
is a bit of a wiener.

1631
00:56:31,183 --> 00:56:33,018
Like, what is he-

1632
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,603
- Okay, Max, Max, we get it.
- Really going to do?

1633
00:56:34,645 --> 00:56:36,939
Why don't you just go ahead
and go over there yourself?

1634
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,149
- No, no.
- You should both go.

1635
00:56:39,191 --> 00:56:39,983
This is not fake.

1636
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:40,984
It's not fake.

1637
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:42,486
Oh, Kelly, come on.

1638
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:44,321
Shut up, Alex.

1639
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:45,406
She strangled herself.

1640
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:46,865
That's physically impossible.

1641
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:48,784
If that's not some supernatural shit

1642
00:56:48,826 --> 00:56:50,244
then I don't know what is.

1643
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:52,996
Super, okay, then why is
it only attacking Chrissy

1644
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:54,665
and not all of us?

1645
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:55,749
Right?

1646
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:57,251
We all did the spell.

1647
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:58,669
Fuck.

1648
00:56:58,711 --> 00:57:00,254
It's the fucking pendulum.

1649
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:01,672
Fuck, oh my god.

1650
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:02,673
- [Kip laughing]
- I was right.

1651
00:57:02,715 --> 00:57:04,967
I was, I was right.

1652
00:57:05,008 --> 00:57:05,801
All along.

1653
00:57:05,843 --> 00:57:06,635
I was right.

1654
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:08,721
Again, fuckin' right, fuckin' pendulum.

1655
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:09,805
Oh my god.

1656
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:12,516
[intense music]

1657
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:16,437
[phone ringing]

1658
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:19,148
Chrissy.

1659
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:23,861
Chrissy.

1660
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:24,737
Hello.

1661
00:57:30,576 --> 00:57:31,952
Chrissy, come on, this isn't funny.

1662
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:35,164
[intense piano music]

1663
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:44,423
Okay, we're glad you're not dead.

1664
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:47,634
[intense piano music]

1665
00:57:48,594 --> 00:57:51,013
Okay, Chrissy, good talk.

1666
00:57:51,055 --> 00:57:54,892
[intense piano music]

1667
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:57,603
[phone ringing]

1668
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:01,815
Hold on just one sec,
Chrissy, Kelly's callin'.

1669
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:02,941
I'll merge us.

1670
00:58:02,983 --> 00:58:05,652
[phone ringing]

1671
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:08,572
Hey, Kel.

1672
00:58:08,614 --> 00:58:09,865
I want an apology.

1673
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:12,076
No, it's, Chrissy's fine, okay?

1674
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:13,202
She just called me.

1675
00:58:13,243 --> 00:58:14,119
She's on the other line.

1676
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:15,788
Hold on, I'll just, I'll merge us.

1677
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:18,749
Hold on, hold on, one sec, one sec.

1678
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:24,380
Where is she?

1679
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:25,339
[Kip sighing]

1680
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:26,757
You know, I don't know.

1681
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,050
I actually haven't seen her yet,

1682
00:58:28,092 --> 00:58:30,594
but this is her apartment, so.

1683
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:35,641
[intense music]

1684
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:46,110
Chrissy.

1685
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:48,153
She's alive.

1686
00:58:50,406 --> 00:58:51,824
Wow, she can act.

1687
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:58,247
[loud banging]
[intense music]

1688
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:16,056
[intensifying music]

1689
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:27,568
Wait, how did he get there so fast?

1690
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:30,028
You idiots know we're
not filming this, right?

1691
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:31,238
You called us.

1692
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:33,240
Hey.

1693
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:36,452
[intense scary music]

1694
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:46,920
What is he doing?

1695
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:48,130
I have no idea.

1696
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:49,298
This is weird.

1697
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:52,426
[dark intense music]

1698
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,930
[banging on window]
[dark intense music]

1699
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:58,474
Again, with the strangling.

1700
00:59:58,515 --> 01:00:01,602
[dark intense music]

1701
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:27,252
- Okay, that was kinda creepy.
- What the fuck?

1702
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:31,590
I'm calling him.

1703
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:33,425
[intense music]

1704
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:36,136
[phone ringing]

1705
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,642
Do you guys know how
dangerous it is to call people

1706
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:43,310
while they're driving?

1707
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:44,144
You piece of shit.

1708
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:45,979
What the hell is wrong with you?

1709
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:47,314
What?

1710
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,024
We saw Chrissy strangle herself,

1711
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:50,651
and you were there.

1712
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,737
Yeah, I know I was on
the same call as you.

1713
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:58,575
No, no, you were there, and
she strangled herself again.

1714
01:00:58,617 --> 01:00:59,827
Fucking crazy town over here.

1715
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:00,702
What?

1716
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:04,915
Where the fuck are you?

1717
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:08,085
I'm going through West Hollywood.

1718
01:01:08,127 --> 01:01:10,087
Well, show us.

1719
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:10,921
What?

1720
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:11,797
Show us.

1721
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,175
What?

1722
01:01:16,009 --> 01:01:16,927
Wait, he's not even,

1723
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,220
he's not even close.

1724
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:19,471
Yeah, I just said that.

1725
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:21,598
I'm still like 20 minutes away.

1726
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,392
Declan you need to get
over there right now.

1727
01:01:23,434 --> 01:01:25,102
I don't know what the fuck is going on,

1728
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:27,187
but it's some weird magic shit,

1729
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:30,190
and just get over there and call me.

1730
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:36,196
[quiet intense music]

1731
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:37,156
I'm here.

1732
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:42,161
[intense music]

1733
01:01:46,707 --> 01:01:48,876
[dog barking]

1734
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:51,670
[intense music]

1735
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:05,684
I swear to god, if
she's fucking with us,

1736
01:02:05,726 --> 01:02:06,643
I will kill her myself.

1737
01:02:06,685 --> 01:02:11,690
[intense music]
[gate clanking]

1738
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:28,040
No, something feels weird.

1739
01:02:28,082 --> 01:02:29,333
Knock, maybe.

1740
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,505
Why do you have a key to Chrissy's?

1741
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:36,173
Max, shut up?

1742
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:37,007
Dude.

1743
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:38,008
She gave me one when we dated.

1744
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:39,176
You are the worst.

1745
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:44,223
[intense music]
[door creaking]

1746
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:45,307
Oh my god.
[door slamming]

1747
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:47,810
[dark intense music]

1748
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:48,894
I see her.

1749
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:51,063
[intense music]

1750
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:51,897
What?

1751
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:53,357
She's not moving.

1752
01:02:53,399 --> 01:02:54,942
Okay, she's pretending.

1753
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:56,527
Go in there and poke her.

1754
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:57,361
Are you insane?

1755
01:02:57,403 --> 01:02:58,195
I'm not going in there.

1756
01:02:58,237 --> 01:02:59,363
She's messing with you.

1757
01:02:59,405 --> 01:03:00,864
Declan, she's not dead.

1758
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:02,908
[intense music]

1759
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:03,951
[Declan] Oh my god.

1760
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:05,911
Do something, Declan.

1761
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:11,709
[banging on door]

1762
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,336
Oh god, she's not moving.

1763
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:15,587
She should have moved.

1764
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:18,632
[banging on door]

1765
01:03:18,674 --> 01:03:19,508
Fuck.

1766
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:21,176
Oh my god.

1767
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:23,512
Oh my god, why is she doing this to me?

1768
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:24,930
She should have moved, guys.

1769
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:26,932
- She should have moved.
- Are you sure, Declan?

1770
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:28,350
What do I do? What do I do?

1771
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:29,184
- What do I do?
- Just don't touch

1772
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:30,561
anything and just get out of there.

1773
01:03:30,602 --> 01:03:31,395
Okay?

1774
01:03:31,437 --> 01:03:32,229
Do you want me to call the cops?

1775
01:03:32,271 --> 01:03:33,147
Is that gonna make you feel better?

1776
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,648
- Have someone come over?
- No, no, no, no, no, wait.

1777
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:35,899
You need to get the pendulum.

1778
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:37,067
Kelly enough with

1779
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:38,152
- the pendulum.
- Get the pendulum.

1780
01:03:38,193 --> 01:03:39,862
I know it has something to do with this.

1781
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:41,822
I'm not stealing from
our dead costar, Kelly.

1782
01:03:41,864 --> 01:03:43,323
Just do it, you little piss wipe.

1783
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,033
It may be the only way we can figure out

1784
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:46,660
what the fuck is going on.

1785
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:47,494
So do it.

1786
01:03:47,536 --> 01:03:49,580
You go in there, and be a man, and get it.

1787
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:50,539
Fuck you.

1788
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,925
[door slamming]

1789
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,844
You guys, you fuckin' owe me.

1790
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:04,887
Thank god.

1791
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:08,474
[intense music]
[person screaming]

1792
01:04:08,515 --> 01:04:09,683
Did you guys hear that?

1793
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:10,517
Hear what?

1794
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:11,852
- What?
- You-

1795
01:04:11,894 --> 01:04:13,062
- What, what?

1796
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:14,313
- Hear-
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1797
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:16,106
Have any of you guys
watched a horror movie?

1798
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:18,108
Declan, just get out of there.

1799
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,151
Wait, shut up.

1800
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:22,446
[gentle intense music]

1801
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:27,910
I think there's someone in there.

1802
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:30,788
[Max] What do you
mean someone's in there?

1803
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,456
[Alex] What are we looking at?

1804
01:04:32,498 --> 01:04:33,415
[Declan] Right there.

1805
01:04:33,457 --> 01:04:34,249
Right past her body.

1806
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:35,084
See that shadow?

1807
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:35,918
- Right where?
- Where, where, where?

1808
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,294
What are you talking about?

1809
01:04:37,336 --> 01:04:38,962
[Declan] Fuck.

1810
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:41,757
Oh my god, what the fuck is that?

1811
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:44,009
Is that a guy?

1812
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:46,762
Okay, okay, just
fucking get out of there

1813
01:04:46,804 --> 01:04:47,596
Declan.

1814
01:04:47,638 --> 01:04:49,598
It's not funny anymore.

1815
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,226
[loud banging]

1816
01:04:56,897 --> 01:04:57,731
My god.

1817
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:00,067
Oh my god.

1818
01:05:02,194 --> 01:05:03,821
Her body's gone.

1819
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:04,655
What?

1820
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:06,156
What do you, what do
you mean her body's gone.

1821
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:07,199
How does a dead body walk away?

1822
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:09,410
I don't know, it's gone.

1823
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:13,747
What the fuck?

1824
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:16,333
[Kip] Maybe she walked away.

1825
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:18,252
I mean, how did she just get up there?

1826
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:19,128
[sudden intense music]

1827
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:21,088
[everyone gasping]

1828
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:23,549
Holy shit, that was good.

1829
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:26,677
[dark intense music]

1830
01:05:36,812 --> 01:05:37,855
Don't be ridiculous.

1831
01:05:37,896 --> 01:05:39,148
They must be working together.

1832
01:05:39,189 --> 01:05:40,441
- Don't you dare.
- Obviously.

1833
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:41,233
Enough with the whole

1834
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:44,945
it was a fucking turntable
and a fan bullshit.

1835
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:47,197
That bitch got possessed
and she killed herself.

1836
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:49,074
- Kelly's right.
- Or Declan killed her.

1837
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:49,950
I don't know, but something

1838
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:51,118
- fucking happened.
- I didn't kill her.

1839
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,453
And you know what, Kip,

1840
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:54,830
I am sick and tired of being told

1841
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:57,040
that because I am a woman I am crazy.

1842
01:05:57,082 --> 01:05:58,459
We're not crazy.

1843
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,835
- We're the only ones who-
- Kelly, shoosh,

1844
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:00,836
- shoosh shoosh shoosh.
- What are you talking about?

1845
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:02,671
Shoosh shoosh shoosh shoosh
shoosh, guys, it's my manager.

1846
01:06:02,713 --> 01:06:03,714
Hold on, hold on.

1847
01:06:03,756 --> 01:06:05,883
[intense music]

1848
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:08,218
Hey Alissa, yeah.

1849
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,512
Yeah, I have a minute, mmhmm.

1850
01:06:10,554 --> 01:06:11,388
Okay.

1851
01:06:12,598 --> 01:06:13,807
Wait.

1852
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:15,100
You're serious?

1853
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:19,104
That's amazing news.

1854
01:06:19,146 --> 01:06:20,230
Yeah.

1855
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:22,483
Okay, yeah, yeah, we'll
talk about it more tomorrow.

1856
01:06:22,524 --> 01:06:23,942
Okay, you let me, I'll call you.

1857
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:24,777
You call me.

1858
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:25,611
I'll call you.

1859
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:27,613
Okay, yeah, okay, bye.

1860
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:28,989
[Max laughing]

1861
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:30,407
- Holy shit.
- Are you kidding?

1862
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:31,825
Do not mute us.

1863
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:33,660
- That is so rude.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1864
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:35,245
I'm sorry, I'm sorry guys, guys, listen.

1865
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:36,497
All right, that was Alissa.

1866
01:06:36,538 --> 01:06:37,372
- She called me-
- Also, you don't have

1867
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:39,208
a huge problem with
your manager calling you

1868
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:40,584
at three o'clock in the morning?

1869
01:06:40,626 --> 01:06:42,044
That's when she does her reading, Alex.

1870
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:45,172
Anyways, she took some of
the footage over to Netflix,

1871
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:48,634
and they are putting together
an offer to buy the film.

1872
01:06:48,675 --> 01:06:49,551
- What?
- Right now?

1873
01:06:49,593 --> 01:06:51,261
- Yeah.
- How much?

1874
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:52,429
- Did they say how much?
- Are you for real?

1875
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:53,597
Do you think you can do reshoots?

1876
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:55,057
No, no, we don't need reshoots.

1877
01:06:55,099 --> 01:06:56,392
They love the footage how it is.

1878
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,227
It's raw and tense and gritty.

1879
01:06:58,268 --> 01:07:00,479
They're saying 2021 is
all about found footage.

1880
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:01,772
[Declan crashing]

1881
01:07:01,814 --> 01:07:03,482
- But when do they want it?
- How is this gonna work?

1882
01:07:03,524 --> 01:07:05,192
Do we get a percentage?

1883
01:07:05,234 --> 01:07:06,568
Well, we need to finish the story.

1884
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,237
No, no, fuck the story.

1885
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:09,738
The story doesn't really, even
really matter at this point.

1886
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,156
They just love the energy of it.

1887
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:12,157
All right, but now we need to

1888
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:13,867
- figure out the why now factor.
- You guys, did you see that?

1889
01:07:13,909 --> 01:07:14,701
What does that even mean?

1890
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:15,869
[Declan crashing]

1891
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:17,121
[intense music]

1892
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:17,996
Whoa.

1893
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:18,831
Declan.

1894
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:19,665
Explain that Kip.

1895
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:22,126
He's obviously making
it about himself right now

1896
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:26,171
because this is a victory for
my writing, quite frankly.

1897
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:27,881
Guys, something's

1898
01:07:27,923 --> 01:07:29,049
- in my apartment.
- Declan, what are you doing?

1899
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:31,135
Declan, where is the pendulum?

1900
01:07:31,176 --> 01:07:32,052
- Declan?
- You guys.

1901
01:07:32,094 --> 01:07:33,053
- Is he fucking around?
- Declan,

1902
01:07:33,095 --> 01:07:36,515
where is the pendulum, you dipshit?

1903
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:37,516
Why are you wearing it?

1904
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:38,434
I told you it was a necklace.

1905
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:39,435
I told you it was a necklace.

1906
01:07:39,476 --> 01:07:40,310
You just told me to take it.

1907
01:07:40,352 --> 01:07:41,395
You didn't tell me what to do with it.

1908
01:07:41,437 --> 01:07:42,730
Wait, do we really think that

1909
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:44,648
this stupid fucking necklace thing

1910
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:46,233
is controlling all of this?

1911
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:47,151
It has to be.

1912
01:07:47,192 --> 01:07:47,985
I don't know-

1913
01:07:48,026 --> 01:07:48,819
[Kelly gasping]

1914
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:49,653
- Kelly.
- Guys, guys, Kelly.

1915
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:50,779
Kelly, Kelly.

1916
01:07:50,821 --> 01:07:51,655
I'm okay.

1917
01:07:51,697 --> 01:07:52,489
I'm okay.

1918
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:53,323
[loud banging]
[Kelly yelling]

1919
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:54,158
What the fuck is going on?

1920
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:54,992
What the fuck is going on?

1921
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:55,826
[Kelly] Oh my god.

1922
01:07:55,868 --> 01:07:57,494
[Kelly gasping]

1923
01:07:57,536 --> 01:07:58,412
Oh my god.

1924
01:07:58,454 --> 01:07:59,496
Kelly, are you okay?

1925
01:07:59,538 --> 01:08:00,622
Yeah, it didn't end with Chrissy.

1926
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:02,040
It started with her.

1927
01:08:02,082 --> 01:08:04,460
I could have just died.

1928
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:06,712
I might've actually just
died for a minute there.

1929
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:09,048
Well, you didn't, 'cause
you're breathing, but.

1930
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:11,675
I can't die as an
unemployed television actress.

1931
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:15,554
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
Kelly, just take a breath.

1932
01:08:15,596 --> 01:08:16,680
Just breathe.

1933
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:19,600
- [Kelly hyperventilating]
- Do it with me.

1934
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,725
[Max groaning]

1935
01:08:20,768 --> 01:08:22,310
Oh my god.

1936
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:23,479
What is happening?

1937
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,564
Are you guys all in on this together?

1938
01:08:25,606 --> 01:08:26,607
Fuck off, Kip.

1939
01:08:26,648 --> 01:08:27,566
- No.
- No.

1940
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:30,444
- Fuck you, Kip.
- Okay, okay, shit.

1941
01:08:30,486 --> 01:08:31,319
Jesus.

1942
01:08:33,447 --> 01:08:34,698
Okay, so why?

1943
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:39,453
Why now?

1944
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:42,872
Because we started meddling
with this magic shit.

1945
01:08:42,915 --> 01:08:45,042
The why now factor.

1946
01:08:45,084 --> 01:08:46,710
Guys, the text.

1947
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:49,212
The answers are in the fucking text.

1948
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:50,631
Not now, Brando.

1949
01:08:50,671 --> 01:08:51,465
Listen to me.

1950
01:08:51,506 --> 01:08:52,674
Scene two, guys.

1951
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:55,469
All right, we called upon a
spirit during the FaceTime

1952
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:57,720
while Chrissy was swinging the pendulum.

1953
01:08:57,763 --> 01:08:59,014
He's right.

1954
01:08:59,055 --> 01:09:00,849
- And I said it was a conduit.
- Thank you.

1955
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:04,103
We said I call upon the darkness

1956
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:06,939
for only you can halt the attack.

1957
01:09:06,979 --> 01:09:07,773
The pendulum is the condiment.

1958
01:09:07,814 --> 01:09:10,401
We must have literally
called upon the darkness.

1959
01:09:10,442 --> 01:09:11,777
Wait, Declan, you're the
one that sent it to us.

1960
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,569
Where'd you find it?

1961
01:09:13,612 --> 01:09:14,738
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1962
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:15,948
On Reddit somewhere.

1963
01:09:15,988 --> 01:09:17,073
Okay, find it again.

1964
01:09:17,116 --> 01:09:18,742
Fuck.

1965
01:09:18,783 --> 01:09:20,577
Pull it up, pull it up, pull it up.

1966
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:21,453
Declan.

1967
01:09:22,621 --> 01:09:23,455
Declan.

1968
01:09:24,415 --> 01:09:25,249
Declan.

1969
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:26,082
Here, here, here, here.

1970
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,626
I call upon the darkness,

1971
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:29,127
from my home to yours
I consent to your power

1972
01:09:29,169 --> 01:09:31,087
for all the days and all the hours.

1973
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:32,673
All the days and all the...

1974
01:09:32,715 --> 01:09:34,383
That sounds pretty permanent, guys.

1975
01:09:34,425 --> 01:09:35,426
That's like forever.

1976
01:09:35,466 --> 01:09:37,761
Does it say anything else?

1977
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:38,595
Scroll to the bottom.

1978
01:09:38,636 --> 01:09:40,013
Do people say anything in the reviews?

1979
01:09:40,055 --> 01:09:41,432
You don't review a Reddit.

1980
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:42,933
[Alex crashing and grunting]

1981
01:09:42,975 --> 01:09:43,975
- Alex.
- Alex.

1982
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:44,810
Alex.

1983
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:45,935
- [Alex groaning]
- Are you okay?

1984
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:46,812
In the comments.

1985
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:47,645
Check in the comments.

1986
01:09:47,688 --> 01:09:49,273
Does it say anything?

1987
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:51,108
Nothing, just ton of you
got rid of my cheating ex,

1988
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:52,776
praise be, bullshit.
[Alex crashing and grunting]

1989
01:09:52,818 --> 01:09:54,194
Oh wait, wait, wait, here, here, here.

1990
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:55,988
I'm next, I'm next, fuck.

1991
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:58,407
Fuck, hurry up Declan, shit.

1992
01:09:58,449 --> 01:10:00,117
How do you undo the curse?

1993
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,326
The original.

1994
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:03,704
[indistinct] open a
flood gate, how do you?

1995
01:10:03,746 --> 01:10:05,205
How do you stop something
that's unstopabble?

1996
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:06,081
Isn't that what Chrissy said?

1997
01:10:06,123 --> 01:10:07,708
Get to the point, get to
the point, get to the point.

1998
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:08,709
No, wait.

1999
01:10:08,751 --> 01:10:10,461
It must, it must run its course.

2000
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:11,628
It must run its course.

2001
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:12,838
That sounds like it's from "The Craft."

2002
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,590
That's directly from "The Craft."

2003
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:16,091
Well what's the course?

2004
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:17,301
What does it mean?

2005
01:10:17,342 --> 01:10:18,886
The author has no imagination.

2006
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:21,263
No, it has to run its course.

2007
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:24,141
It must fulfill its objective.

2008
01:10:24,183 --> 01:10:26,185
What's the objective?

2009
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:27,061
Wait,

2010
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:30,981
so we all have to,

2011
01:10:31,023 --> 01:10:32,441
do we all have to die?

2012
01:10:32,483 --> 01:10:34,234
- No, no, no, I don't think-
- please don't say-

2013
01:10:34,276 --> 01:10:35,152
[indistinct]

2014
01:10:35,194 --> 01:10:36,278
- Guys, we said,
- What's its objective

2015
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,072
if not to kill us then?
I call upon the forces,

2016
01:10:38,113 --> 01:10:39,448
I call upon the forces,

2017
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:41,992
to take them away, to take them back.

2018
01:10:42,034 --> 01:10:43,035
To where?

2019
01:10:44,578 --> 01:10:46,622
I mean, I guess the
spirit must be attacking

2020
01:10:46,663 --> 01:10:48,207
what is evil inside of us?

2021
01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:50,376
Like my original script, hold on.

2022
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:52,503
So we have to get rid of the evil

2023
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,380
that is inside all of us?

2024
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:55,339
How do we do that?

2025
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:57,674
Or pass it onto somebody more evil?

2026
01:10:57,716 --> 01:11:01,470
Wait, you're talking
about killing someone.

2027
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:04,932
You don't even believe
in this shit, remember?

2028
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:06,058
Okay, no one's gonna die.

2029
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,267
No, one's gonna die.

2030
01:11:07,309 --> 01:11:08,102
- No, one's gonna die.
- It's a little

2031
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:10,687
suspect now, okay?
[Max whooshing and grunting]

2032
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:11,480
Max.

2033
01:11:11,522 --> 01:11:12,314
- What the?
- Declan,

2034
01:11:12,356 --> 01:11:13,148
you have to get rid of it.

2035
01:11:13,190 --> 01:11:13,982
Yeah.

2036
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:14,817
- [Max crashing and grunting]
- Max.

2037
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,693
Declan, I do not care
who you send it to,

2038
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,903
just make sure that they've read

2039
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:19,613
the entire passage out loud.

2040
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:20,989
- It's the only way-
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

2041
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:21,824
that we can break the curse.
I'm on it.

2042
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:23,367
I'm on it.

2043
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:26,370
Fuck, dude I spilled my milk.

2044
01:11:26,412 --> 01:11:28,539
I spilled my milk all
over the fuckin' floor.

2045
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:31,166
It's just, it's on my socks.

2046
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:32,000
[Max crashing and grunting]

2047
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:34,753
Oh shit, oh my god, oh fuck.

2048
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:35,587
It's everywhere.

2049
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:37,005
[Max crashing and grunting]

2050
01:11:37,047 --> 01:11:38,382
- Oh, god.
- Not okay.

2051
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:39,341
Not okay, not okay,

2052
01:11:39,383 --> 01:11:40,175
- not okay, not okay.
- I'll put on

2053
01:11:40,217 --> 01:11:41,176
a new pair of socks.

2054
01:11:41,218 --> 01:11:43,178
[Max] Declan, throw
away the fucking necklace.

2055
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:48,183
[phone ringing]
[intense music]

2056
01:11:51,395 --> 01:11:52,271
Hey.

2057
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:55,399
Oh shit, dude, you don't look so good.

2058
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:57,693
Oh well, I've seen worse.

2059
01:11:58,736 --> 01:12:00,487
Well, hey did you get rid of it?

2060
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:02,281
Yeah, I'm on my way.

2061
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:03,657
Who, Declan?

2062
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:04,700
Who are you sending it to?

2063
01:12:04,742 --> 01:12:05,534
Seriously?

2064
01:12:05,576 --> 01:12:06,994
I know, I know, I know, but,

2065
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:08,954
I just, I need to know.

2066
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:10,414
Dude, is this why you're calling me?

2067
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:12,499
'Cause I'm trying to save our lives, okay?

2068
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:15,961
No, no, they found Chrissy's body, man.

2069
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:19,882
It's all over the news.

2070
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:20,758
Fuck.

2071
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:22,509
Fuck.

2072
01:12:23,844 --> 01:12:25,179
I told you guys.

2073
01:12:26,263 --> 01:12:27,931
I swear to God, I believed you.

2074
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:29,099
It's just-

2075
01:12:29,141 --> 01:12:29,933
- What are they saying about it?

2076
01:12:29,975 --> 01:12:32,352
It still doesn't make any sense, okay?

2077
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:35,147
They're calling it an accident.

2078
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:37,149
That is fuckin' bullshit, isn't it?

2079
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:39,693
[intense music]

2080
01:12:39,735 --> 01:12:42,780
Declan, do you think if
I woulda listened to Kelly,

2081
01:12:42,821 --> 01:12:45,574
do you think Chrissy would still be alive?

2082
01:12:45,616 --> 01:12:47,076
No I don't.

2083
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:47,910
And honestly, man,

2084
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,912
there's no use going down that road, okay?

2085
01:12:49,953 --> 01:12:51,997
Look, this is almost behind us.

2086
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:52,831
I even wrote out instructions

2087
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:55,209
to read the fucking thing out loud, okay?

2088
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:57,002
But why, why would anyone do that?

2089
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:57,836
Why wouldn't they?

2090
01:12:57,878 --> 01:12:58,670
We did.

2091
01:12:58,712 --> 01:12:59,505
Look, I gotta go.

2092
01:12:59,546 --> 01:13:00,631
Wait, Declan, Declan.

2093
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:01,632
Do you think this is gonna work?

2094
01:13:01,673 --> 01:13:04,218
[intense music]

2095
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:06,804
Honestly, Kip, I don't fuckin' know,

2096
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:07,930
but we're about to find out.

2097
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:10,724
[intense music]

2098
01:13:11,809 --> 01:13:14,186
[Kip] Did you get this
email from the network?

2099
01:13:14,228 --> 01:13:17,606
Yeah, it looks like we're all on it.

2100
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:20,609
Dude it's from Bobbie Brower.

2101
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:21,944
Wonderful.

2102
01:13:21,985 --> 01:13:23,153
Now on top of everything else,

2103
01:13:23,195 --> 01:13:25,781
our show's officially getting canceled.

2104
01:13:25,823 --> 01:13:26,698
Dammit.

2105
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:27,574
Fuck.

2106
01:13:28,826 --> 01:13:29,743
Hey, Max.

2107
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:33,497
Are you okay?

2108
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:34,706
You kinda look like shit, dude.

2109
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:37,376
No, no, no, I'm not okay, Alex.

2110
01:13:37,418 --> 01:13:38,836
Frankly, it's kinda disconcerting to me

2111
01:13:38,877 --> 01:13:40,337
that you guys are so calm, okay?

2112
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,506
- And I'm having panic attacks-
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, Max,

2113
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:43,757
- Max, Max, Max.
- Every two seconds.

2114
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:44,591
Hyperventilating likes it's my job.

2115
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:45,426
Okay.

2116
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:47,428
Let's not jump into anything.

2117
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:49,346
We don't know what this
meeting is about yet.

2118
01:13:49,388 --> 01:13:51,223
What meeting, Kip?

2119
01:13:51,265 --> 01:13:52,474
- What meeting?
- Bobbie Brower wants to talk

2120
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:53,976
to all of us on Friday.

2121
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:54,810
Bobbie?

2122
01:13:54,852 --> 01:13:55,644
Yeah.

2123
01:13:55,686 --> 01:13:56,478
Okay, maybe we should all go together,

2124
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,312
because I don't really think

2125
01:13:57,354 --> 01:13:58,981
I should be going anywhere
alone at the moment

2126
01:13:59,022 --> 01:14:00,357
or just being alone in general [laughing].

2127
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:02,276
Dude, it's summer hours.

2128
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:03,485
Meetings aren't in prison.

2129
01:14:03,527 --> 01:14:05,779
Guys, screw, no, it's great, it's fine.

2130
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:06,739
Where the hell are you?

2131
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,575
I'm at my mom's house
because I got my ass beat

2132
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:11,535
by a ghost in my bedroom.

2133
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:12,369
[vacuum whirring]

2134
01:14:12,411 --> 01:14:15,873
God mom, you can't just
sneak up like that.

2135
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:18,125
I'm on the phone.

2136
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,668
[Mom] Oh, sorry.

2137
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:23,047
- Okay, Max.
- Did Declan

2138
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:24,548
get rid of it yet?

2139
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:26,550
Because I'm really starting
to lose my shit, man.

2140
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:28,719
And I don't really think
I can do this anymore.

2141
01:14:28,761 --> 01:14:29,553
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2142
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:31,346
He sent it a couple days ago.

2143
01:14:31,388 --> 01:14:32,431
Okay, okay.

2144
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:37,519
Then why do I still feel
like I'm being watched?

2145
01:14:37,561 --> 01:14:38,979
I don't know, I don't know.

2146
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:40,939
Okay, I haven't felt right either.

2147
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:43,484
Ever since he sent it, I,

2148
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:45,319
I should have stopped him from sending it.

2149
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,615
Yeah, but come on, what
other choice did we have?

2150
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,117
[Kip sighing]

2151
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:53,160
Yeah, I mean maybe this thing

2152
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:55,704
really does go after people who sin.

2153
01:14:55,746 --> 01:14:58,415
[intense music]

2154
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:25,901
[water flowing]

2155
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:28,612
[intense music]

2156
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:46,004
[water flowing]

2157
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:11,697
[dark intense music]

2158
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:16,827
[Declan gasping]

2159
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:27,755
- Hey.
- What up man?

2160
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:29,131
Hey guys.

2161
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:30,591
Hey guys.

2162
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:32,217
It's so good to see you all.

2163
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:33,177
Yeah.

2164
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:34,636
I'm glad you guys are okay.

2165
01:16:34,678 --> 01:16:38,057
Listen, I just wanted to check in

2166
01:16:38,098 --> 01:16:40,350
with everybody before we have
this meeting with the network.

2167
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:41,769
Who cancels the show of a dead girl?

2168
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,897
I mean it's so short sighted.

2169
01:16:44,938 --> 01:16:46,690
Well, we don't know
if they're canceling us.

2170
01:16:46,732 --> 01:16:48,650
I'm sorry, let's just take a moment

2171
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:51,361
for Chrissy's grieving
best friend, everyone.

2172
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:52,488
Don't be jealous.

2173
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:53,655
Jealous?

2174
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,074
Yeah, that's the word.

2175
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:58,077
Because I would love to be Chrissy's,

2176
01:16:58,118 --> 01:17:00,245
what's that basic ass
hashtag she keeps using

2177
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,371
- in all the photos?
- Soul sister.

2178
01:17:01,413 --> 01:17:03,332
Soul sister, yes, yes.

2179
01:17:03,373 --> 01:17:06,502
How does it feel with
half your soul missing

2180
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:07,336
right now, Kelly?

2181
01:17:07,378 --> 01:17:08,170
You know what?

2182
01:17:08,212 --> 01:17:10,214
We played sisters and the
people wanna hear from me.

2183
01:17:10,255 --> 01:17:12,508
Okay, has anyone heard from Declan?

2184
01:17:12,549 --> 01:17:13,592
I haven't spoken to
him since he was gonna-

2185
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:15,636
- No.
- Mail the thing.

2186
01:17:15,677 --> 01:17:16,970
No.

2187
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:17,805
- Yeah.
- Wait,

2188
01:17:17,846 --> 01:17:18,847
he didn't respond to the email.

2189
01:17:18,889 --> 01:17:22,601
No he didn't, but it's Declan so.

2190
01:17:22,643 --> 01:17:24,812
I'm gonna call him.

2191
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:27,523
[phone ringing]

2192
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,234
So

2193
01:17:31,985 --> 01:17:33,987
any of you know what this meeting's about?

2194
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:34,822
No idea.

2195
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:35,906
Come on, it's obvious.

2196
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:37,866
When was the last time we
had a call with network?

2197
01:17:37,908 --> 01:17:38,700
When we got hired.

2198
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:41,078
And when Declan got arrested

2199
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,579
for hitting that Uber driver in Miami.

2200
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:44,748
Exactly, they don't just call to say hi.

2201
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:46,792
Okay, he's not picking up.

2202
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:50,921
Hey listen, guys, if it is a cancellation,

2203
01:17:50,963 --> 01:17:52,965
let's just play it cool.

2204
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:54,133
Okay?

2205
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:57,177
I mean, realistically
they'll probably just

2206
01:17:57,219 --> 01:17:59,304
offer us therapy or something.

2207
01:17:59,346 --> 01:18:00,723
I don't need their shitty therapist.

2208
01:18:00,764 --> 01:18:02,266
I have my own.

2209
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:03,434
Of course you do.

2210
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:04,727
[gentle music]

2211
01:18:04,768 --> 01:18:06,270
Okay, let's just not give 'em a reason

2212
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:08,439
to keep us under contract out of spite.

2213
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,314
Okay?

2214
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:11,900
Otherwise we'll never be
able to finish our movie.

2215
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:12,735
What?

2216
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,445
You guys wanna finish the movie?

2217
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:15,571
Chrissy's dead.

2218
01:18:15,612 --> 01:18:16,989
Kip, it's her best work.

2219
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,741
Oh my god.

2220
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:22,870
Yeah, I mean, I do think that
she'd want us to finish it.

2221
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:23,704
- Jesus.
- She might

2222
01:18:23,746 --> 01:18:24,538
even get nominated.

2223
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,498
You are the worst person I have ever-

2224
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,167
- Are you on your period or something?

2225
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,293
I don't know what's going on.

2226
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:30,127
- Fuck off, Kelly.
- Okay, wait, shit,

2227
01:18:30,169 --> 01:18:31,253
guys, it's time for the meeting.

2228
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:32,629
Okay?

2229
01:18:32,671 --> 01:18:33,505
You ready?

2230
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:36,175
- [Max sighing]
- Yeah.

2231
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:37,551
Yeah.

2232
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:39,261
Blah, blah, blah.

2233
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:40,095
Yeah.

2234
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:42,765
[intense music]

2235
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:44,683
Hey guys, good afternoon.

2236
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:45,809
Thank you for coming.

2237
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:47,603
We've got Bobbie Brower on the line.

2238
01:18:47,644 --> 01:18:48,979
Welcome, everybody, welcome.

2239
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:49,813
[Max] Thank you for having us.

2240
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:53,442
Yeah, especially now
considering everything, so tragic.

2241
01:18:53,484 --> 01:18:55,402
Although the show's never been so popular.

2242
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:57,488
Yeah, oh yeah it is.

2243
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:59,156
It's super tragic.

2244
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:01,158
Guys, you know Michelle,
from marketing, right?

2245
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:01,992
Okay, good.

2246
01:19:02,034 --> 01:19:04,870
Hey, isn't there supposed
to be one more of you?

2247
01:19:04,912 --> 01:19:06,038
Yes.

2248
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,999
Wait, what is, what's this?

2249
01:19:09,041 --> 01:19:10,501
This is going immediately, right?

2250
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:11,668
Like as soon as we hang up?

2251
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:12,544
Get it off.

2252
01:19:12,586 --> 01:19:15,214
I don't even understand
your face right now.

2253
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:18,675
Yeah, where, is, was it, Declan, is it?

2254
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,972
Declan is,

2255
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:24,848
making a video.

2256
01:19:26,058 --> 01:19:26,892
Yeah.

2257
01:19:28,018 --> 01:19:31,313
From all of us to commemorate Chrissy.

2258
01:19:31,355 --> 01:19:35,025
It's a goodbye from her "Belle" family.

2259
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:36,360
"Belle" family.

2260
01:19:36,402 --> 01:19:37,820
Hmmm.

2261
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:40,114
Yeah, well, that's actually
really good thinking.

2262
01:19:40,155 --> 01:19:43,826
We were gonna send it over to
you guys when it was finished.

2263
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:45,911
Thought it would be great press.

2264
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:49,748
I mean, look guys, I know
that you guys were all,

2265
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:53,544
I mean from your social media, very close,

2266
01:19:53,585 --> 01:19:58,340
and I'm sure this has gotta
be really hard on all of you.

2267
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:02,928
God, I'm just, I'm not
really good at that stuff.

2268
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:03,762
You know what I mean?

2269
01:20:03,804 --> 01:20:04,638
- Can we just-
- Bobbie, no, no, no,

2270
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:05,472
you're you're wonderful.

2271
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:06,306
You're great.

2272
01:20:06,348 --> 01:20:08,559
You know, I think that
we should just push on

2273
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,518
because I know that you know

2274
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,395
how valuable everyone's time is

2275
01:20:11,437 --> 01:20:15,023
and you wanted to give the cast some news.

2276
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,233
Yeah, I did.

2277
01:20:17,234 --> 01:20:22,197
Guys, I wanted to let
you know that "Belle"

2278
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:24,867
is being renewed

2279
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:27,035
for three more seasons.

2280
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:29,663
- Congratulations, guys.
- What?

2281
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:30,497
Oh my god, what?

2282
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:31,331
Oh my god.

2283
01:20:31,373 --> 01:20:32,750
That's great, that's great news.

2284
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:34,835
This is so epic, thank you, thank you.

2285
01:20:34,877 --> 01:20:37,880
It is, it is indeed epic.

2286
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:38,756
And you did that.

2287
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:40,507
I know, I did that.

2288
01:20:40,549 --> 01:20:42,926
Oh my god, what a relief.

2289
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:45,345
You know, we just,
we have an opportunity

2290
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:48,140
here to really seize a moment.

2291
01:20:48,182 --> 01:20:48,974
We should seize the moment.

2292
01:20:49,016 --> 01:20:50,059
- Yes.
- This is the show.

2293
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:50,934
It's,

2294
01:20:52,102 --> 01:20:53,854
it's a survivor, isn't it?

2295
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:55,522
And I honestly just think it would be,

2296
01:20:55,564 --> 01:20:59,318
it would be a mistake
not to capitalize on...

2297
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:02,529
[phone ringing]

2298
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:04,782
Guys, I need to take this call, okay?

2299
01:21:04,823 --> 01:21:08,035
Harry, how do I mute this thing?

2300
01:21:08,077 --> 01:21:09,745
[Harry] Just turn the volume down.

2301
01:21:09,787 --> 01:21:10,913
Yeah, it's on the side.

2302
01:21:10,954 --> 01:21:11,830
The button with the bracket.

2303
01:21:11,872 --> 01:21:14,708
Just press that, yeah, go down.

2304
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:15,959
Keep pressing.

2305
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:17,002
Okay, all right.

2306
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:19,797
[phone ringing]

2307
01:21:19,838 --> 01:21:20,672
Brower.

2308
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:23,467
- No.
- Um, um,

2309
01:21:23,509 --> 01:21:24,468
- No, no, not at all.
- Wait, wait.

2310
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:28,055
- I think you forgot to-
- No, I said no.

2311
01:21:28,097 --> 01:21:29,640
I don't understand how
you can't understand

2312
01:21:29,681 --> 01:21:30,474
a word with two letters.

2313
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:33,227
It's no, he's a fucking prick,

2314
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:35,437
and I will not tolerate this shit anymore.

2315
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:38,107
- Oh, it's Bobbie with an I-E.
- Melanie, what is this?

2316
01:21:38,148 --> 01:21:39,483

Hi, I got your gift.
