report of what

10
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,159
sounded like gunshots coming from this

11
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,000
residence really

12
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,080
yes is there a problem

13
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,120
no other than the fact that i have an

14
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,000
idiot son

15
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,000
everything's fine

16
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
look this is gonna sound stupid but here

17
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,760
it is i was upstairs and i heard what i

18
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,080
thought were gunshots coming from down

19
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
here

20
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,000
i come running down and i see my idiot

21
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,879
son and his idiot friends pounding on

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,560
some bullets with a hammer

23
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,080
you're kidding me now do you ever hear

24
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,159
of anything so dumb no

25
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,480
that's a first lucky they didn't kill

26
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,599
themselves you're telling me i wanted to

27
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,239
strangle every one of the little

28
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,959
bastards

29
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,400
is your son here now no when i saw what

30
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,640
they were doing i went into a screaming

31
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
fit and told them to get out of my house

32
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,599
they all took off on their bikes

33
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,879
somewhere they're probably at the

34
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,759
woodley place down the road

35
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,280
your guns in the house i take it i have

36
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,040
a gun

37
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,720
but i keep it locked up so i can avoid

38
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,639
situations like this

39
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
i didn't lock up the ammunition because

40
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,360
i didn't think i had to

41
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,639
i figured you know how dangerous can a

42
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,600
bullet be if they don't have a gun to

43
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,639
put it in

44
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,800
so it's [ __ ] me it's not to

45
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,400
idiot-proof the ammunition

46
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
which completely defeats the purpose for

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,120
having a gun for home defense

48
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,320
if someone broke in i'd be raped stabbed

49
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,000
and bludgeoned before i can

50
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,000
get my key on those trigger box

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,960
well all right that's all it is i'll be

52
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,800
on my way and i know i keep calling my

53
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,520
son an idiot but

54
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,400
i'm just exaggerating he's a smart kid

55
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,680
just does really

56
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,759
stupid [ __ ] sometimes

57
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,520
and i guess i could take him to a shrink

58
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,720
and they could give him some fancy name

59
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,840
for it like

60
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,919
autism or asperger's or adhd

61
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,639
i guess i could pump him full of ritalin

62
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,240
turn him into some brain dead zombie

63
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,919
you know when all is said and done i'd

64
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,919
rather have a kid that

65
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,960
is a pain in the ass but has some

66
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,479
personality

67
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,639
instead of some mindless robot

68
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,919
besides who might even do something like

69
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,639
that just to make my life a little

70
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,880
easier

71
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,320
that's the mark of a weakling can't

72
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,960
handle the [ __ ] life deals out

73
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,800
i understand you know i have two of my

74
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,720
own the thing is his father died last

75
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,039
year of cancer and

76
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,880
i know that's affected him not to

77
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,120
mention when it's done to me

78
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,600
my head is like a pinball machine 24

79
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,440
hours a day

80
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,199
my brother tried to set me up on a date

81
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,080
last week

82
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,720
i even know how to date anymore half the

83
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,479
time i

84
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,000
think i never want to see a penis again

85
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,800
and the other half i'm so horny i can

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
hump the doorknob

87
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,240
guess i went a little far on that one

88
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,600
huh

89
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,960
a little bit don't worry about it

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,960
i just wish things were easier

91
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
i don't know maybe i'm part of the

92
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,720
problem

93
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,120
maybe i'm making things harder than they

94
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,919
have to be

95
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,440
maybe i should stop punishing myself for

96
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,560
past mistakes by denying me what would

97
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,560
make me happy right now

98
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,199

99
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,199
the right now

100
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,919

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,120

just

294
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,600

295
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,159

297
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,799

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,760
like a talent a lack of luck

299
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,440

its hooks in you

306
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:09,840

in the game is kind of an accomplishment

343
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,919
but there's a sort of poetry in any job

344
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,919
if you look for it

345
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,640
is poetry and a factor y'all sure

346
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,200
like the mom who works four overtime

347
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,600
shifts to buy her kid an xbox

348
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,440
or the fat old guy who plays nothing but

349
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,159
love songs on his radio like what's his

350
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,799
deal

351
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,840
is he pining for a long lost love or is

352
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,440
he waiting for a love that may never

353
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,320
come

354
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,840

355
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,919
collar work for years and he never got

356
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,120
any poetry out of it just

357
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,799
a bad back and bad knees and a bad

358
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,520
disposition

359
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,960
well it's a matter of perspective i'll

360
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
tell you many times in life

361
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,360
perspective has saved me from the

362
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,360
consequences oh

363
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:42,000
what what happened what's the matter

364
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,919
a bug flew in my mouth you should

365
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,159
swallow it that's extra protein

366
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,520
i could feel its wings on my tongue see

367
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,799
that's what you get that's the country

368
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,400
god's punishing you for your shitty

369
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:57,840

looks delicious

372
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,279
so what is the first thing we do when we

373
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,799
get back from a nature height

374
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,760
celebrate our daring pioneer spirit no

375
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,960
take a check so they usually jump on

376
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,840
your pant leg and work their way up

377
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,840
so start there

378
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,440

your junk to get sunburned

480
00:36:52,839 --> 00:37:11,839
[ __ ] thought about that

481
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,320
having fun under your statement of the

482
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,320
century

483
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,359
you ready for an odd compliment

484
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:27,599
hit me you have the sexiest

485
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,119
[ __ ] face i've ever seen really

486
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,440

487
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,599
[ __ ] i'm worried about

488
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,119
looking goofy and get self-conscious oh

489
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,640
the lack of self-consciousness is what

490
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,560
makes it so hot

491
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,839
that's why most porn does nothing for me

492
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,680
most porn stars are

493
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,880

494
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,320
beautiful that

495
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,079
they won't let their faces contort in

496
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,800
any way that isn't stereotypically

497
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,920
gorgeous

498
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,280

00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,319
no come on i've given boyfriends

568
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,440
manicures before one of them even let me

569
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,200
paint his face with makeup yeah where

570
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,800
are those guys now

571
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,800
damn defiant that's how you wear their

572
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:37,839
second dick in a bus stop men's room

573
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,839
oh that is entirely possible

574
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,720
so next we have

575
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,160
the grand cosmic questions of the

576
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,160
universe

577
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:52,000
okay okay how it works is

578
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,280
i ask you a question then you ask me a

579
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,640
question then me you

580
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,599
you me creating a volley not like a

581
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,160
verbal tennis match

582
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,800
okay okay so these questions can be

583
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,400
either

584
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,800
deep and profound or light and casual

585
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,079
an example of the latter what is your

586
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,040
favorite beatles song

587
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,599
oh [ __ ] the beatles i mean [ __ ] the

588
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,280
beatles

589
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,319
i mean [ __ ] the beatles i'm not saying

590
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,839
they suck i'm just saying they're

591
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,240
overrated

592
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,599
okay any band that you like was

593
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,640
influenced by the beatles not talking

594
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,920
about influence i'm talking about the

595
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,680
actual music

596
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,440
you can break their career in two halves

597
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,440
all right the first half day

598
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,119
they spent writing candy-ass love songs

599
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,880
for teenage girls to scream to

600
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,319
which basically makes them the 1950s

601
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,200
equivalent to justin bieber for the

602
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,839
backstreet boys

603
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,920
jesus second half they spent stoned out

604
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,880
of their minds doing hippy dippy drug

605
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,160
music

606
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,720
that is the era where they did their

607
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,960
most profound work oh bullsh yeah right

608
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,560
songs about kaleidoscope skies and girls

609
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,560
with marmalade eyes

610
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,760
other way around whichever just real

611
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,760
[ __ ] profound okay

612
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,359
plus then they added all that indian

613
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,839
string [ __ ] and sitar in

614
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,400
rock and roll is about guitar plain and

615
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,359
simple

616
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,359
no wrong no wrong or wrong right right

617
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,640
right right

618
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,640
which brings me to my question now that

619
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,079
we're talking about the guitar when are

620
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,640
we going to get a van halen reunion with

621
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,240
the four

622
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,000
original members right after two decades

623
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,000
we finally get roth back and then they

624
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,640
fire michael anthony so eddie can jim's

625
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,319
idiot son into the lineup

626
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,760
you know what i'm really holding out for

627
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,119
i'm really holding out for the reunion

628
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,000
with their third singer who was that

629
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,400
dopey guy

630
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,800
no what the extreme guy do not

631
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,280
disrespect the greatness of gary sharon

632
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,359
oh yeah name one good song from the game

633
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,960
jeremy if i wasn't afraid of boring you

634
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,720
i could sit here and rattle off every

635
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,680
song titled the van halen three much to

636
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,960
my eternal sugar

637
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,000
oh eternal chagrin good word choice

638
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,960
that's close enough about right

639
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,880
so we um going back to the beatles you

640
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,160
know what i feel really sorry for

641
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,599
john lennon all right

642
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,880
way to go out on the limb there feeling

643
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,520
sorry for the guy that got gunned down

644
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,760
in the street

645
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,839
no no no no i mean like in terms of like

646
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,200
historical significance

647
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,400
because like when you look back at their

648
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,240
stuff like his stuff was the stuff

649
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,760
that like and like his stuff versus

650
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,520
mccartney stuff his stuff is the stuff

651
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,400
that really dated you're saying one word

652
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,160
again

653
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:15,760
over and over his stuff is the stuff

654
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,520
that really dated the most like

655
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,960
when you look at mccartney stuff it's

656
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,359
about stuff that's always going to be

657
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,960
there

658
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:25,680
like love and regret 50 years from now

659
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,280
some trucker's gonna put yesterday on

660
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,240
his ipod 27

661
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,800
and just cry like a baby but when you

662
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,200
listen to lennon's you know imagine

663
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,000
you kind of want to go oh that's sweet

664
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,440
world please

665
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,960
run along and play the adults are

666
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,319
talking that is exactly what i was

667
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,400
trying to say five minutes ago

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,599
no you said they sucked no i didn't i

669
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,440
said they were overrated

670
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,359
okay well the overrated is different

671
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,920
than dated data doesn't have the same

672
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:51,359
negative

673
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:55,760
connotations whose turn is it

674
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:58,319
it's your turn go quick um

675
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,520
when you were a kid okay when you were a

676
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,079
kid did you ever have the nickname

677
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:05,599
spruce goose bruce

678
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,240
yes really no ask a dumb question get a

679
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,079
sarcastic

680
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,720
answer my turn okay well what about

681
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,520
loose caboose what about my turn

682
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,720
all right why do midgets hate being

683
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,760
called midgets

684
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,359
huh like they prefer little person

685
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,400
that's so condescending oh a little

686
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,160
person

687
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,760
that's terrible and dwarf that makes you

688
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,800
sound like a cartoon

689
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,680
but [ __ ] is a strong word isn't it two

690
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,040
syllables

691
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,520
short strong

692
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,640
it's like it sounds like hatchet [ __ ]

693
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,480
hatchet

694
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,240
small but lethal right

695
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,559
tell me i'm wrong it's a stronger

696
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,200
sounding word

697
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:47,040
okay my safe answer to that is just call

698
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,040
them little people and don't ever ask

699
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,839
that in mixed and judgmental companies

700
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,520
whatever it's a good word you should

701
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:58,480
enjoy it

702
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:58,480
okay own it next topic

703
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,440
men in urinals oh

704
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,800
two of my favorite toppings two-part

705
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,319
question

706
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,240
first is it true that you have to keep a

707
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:14,839
one buffer

708
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,880
urinal between you and the guy next to

709
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:20,000
you and

710
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,319
part two if that's true are you really

711
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,680
worried about him looking at your junk

712
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:27,200
no okay there's an unspoken rule

713
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,280
that if there's a wall full of empty

714
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,000
urinals you don't go sidling up to the

715
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,040
one other guy

716
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,880
there that's [ __ ] weird but if you're

717
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,400
at a concert or something like a crowded

718
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,920
event like a football game

719
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,160
like all that [ __ ] goes out the window

720
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,880
you have guys crossing streams in the

721
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,400
same stall

722
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,680
pissing in the sink what it's not like

723
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,599
it's just another drain it's like your

724
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,720
fingers touch the drain when you're

725
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,000
washing your hands yeah what about

726
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,359
droplet splash that's got to get all

727
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,839
over the faucet and the knobs

728
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:55,040
well you're in a sterile anyway and they

729
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,200
say you could drink it if you were

730
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,240
stranded on a desert island

731
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:03,520
who says that they

732
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,319
scientists and [ __ ] oh they they

733
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,319
yes they

734
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,480

735
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:16,400

that is that it

740
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,240

847
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,160
though of course in high school there

849
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,720

michelle clark and

855
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,280

01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,480
nickname moby clark so everywhere she

857
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,880

a long time ago so let me ask you

907
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,160
something that whole thing with the

908
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,280
pounding bullets with the hammer earlier

909
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,520

01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,280
about

911
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:45,119

914
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,760
little boy [ __ ]

915
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,680
when i was a kid me and my friends put

916
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,839
an m80 in a coffee can

917
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,880
the idea being that it would shoot it

918
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:00,400
straight up in the air

919
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,359
50 feet like a rocket no instead it blew

920
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,200
completely apart

921
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,799
like a fragmentation grenade sent all

922
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,839
these flying pieces of shrapnel

923
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:08,799
everywhere

926
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,839
exactly making me feel better here

927
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,720
i'm just saying that little boys are

928
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:19,200
stupid and god tends to have pity on

929
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,200
stupid

930
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:24,079
but as long as we're going back to

931
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:28,640
things from earlier you said

932
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,640

933
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:34,240

disaster or anything

936
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,319

937
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:44,079
ended with a loose armed hug

938
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:48,000
yeah i've had a couple of those

939
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:50,559

he would do this thing where he would he

941
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,000
would chew with his mouth closed but he

942
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,920
wouldn't fully swallow every bite before

943
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,760
he would shovel the next bite in

944
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,760
so there was like always this like

945
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,119
chewed piece of food

946
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,920
in his mouth like there's only

947
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,520
swallowing part of it

948
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,280
it was a petty thing to focus on but it

949
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,799
drove me nuts no no

950
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,119
it's the little things that can really

951
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:12,640
suck sometimes i once dated this girl

952
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:14,160
and before we went out she just painted

953
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,720
her nails but

954
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,200
she left all this excess polish like all

955
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:21,119
over her cuticles and her fingers

956
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,720
it looked like my four-year-old does it

957
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,880
and so the whole time i'm just glancing

958
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,720
at her fingers thinking

959
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,720
does she even know how bad that looks or

960
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:31,760
does she know and just not care

961
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,799

01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,160
balls in my mouth you don't get to play

990
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,160
the too personal card

991
01:05:53,520 --> 01:06:04,000
it's not that it's too personal i just

992
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:06,240
don't like talking about it with anyone

993
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,359
for some reason i always have to i

994
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,359
always feel like i have to

995
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:13,599
say how great everything is going

996
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:22,480
when i usually don't feel that way i

997
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:26,319
i usually feel like a fraud

998
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,319
who has no idea what he's doing

999
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:33,839
we all feel that way sometimes yeah but

1000
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,839
with me it's not sometimes

1001
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,520
i don't know

1002
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:42,079
it's hard to admit

1003
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,839
she never worries

1004
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,440
and i worry so much to the point that

1005
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:57,280
i never get to enjoy the process

1006
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,440
i honestly can't remember the last time

1007
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,079
i felt happy

1008
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,079
about it all

1009
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:14,880
it's like the way i'm supposed to feel

1010
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:18,480
and the way i actually feel

1011
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,480
are two very separate things

1012
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:26,559
she'll show me a cute picture or video

1013
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,559
of the kids

1014
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:32,799
and i know the reaction that she wants

1015
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,799
and i give it to her

1016
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,559
but i'm totally faking it

1017
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:43,839
and i feel like [ __ ] because i'm faking

1018
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:43,839
it

1019
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,640
i guess i always feel like [ __ ] about

1020
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,640
some aspect of it

1021
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,720
it makes me sound like an [ __ ]

1022
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:00,960
doesn't it

1023
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:02,160
no no it makes you sound like someone

1024
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,760
who

1025
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,520
had a hole in their life who filled it

1026
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:11,200
with what they thought they should

1027
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:15,760
or with what someone expected them to

1028
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,760
yeah that is kind of it i guess

1029
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:25,839
i still think it makes me less of a man

1030
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:25,839
in some way

1031
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,040
we all like to think that we're these

1032
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:34,719
perfect angels of virtue

1033
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:36,839
but really we're just

1034
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:39,839
flawed train wrecks barely keeping it

1035
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:39,839
together

1036
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:45,679
i know when my husband was dying

1037
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:49,920
at the end when things were at their

1038
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,920
worst

1039
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:54,560
i wasn't there for him as much as i

1040
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,560
should have been

1041
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:58,080
there were some days that i just

1042
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,359
couldn't handle it

1043
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,640
i wonder what he must have thought on

1044
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:10,239
those days when i just

1045
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,319
didn't show up how much that must have

1046
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:14,799
hurt even though he never

1047
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,799
showed it

1048
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:21,839
oh that's family

1049
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:27,759
we [ __ ] up we forgive each other

1050
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:38,480
we [ __ ] up again

1051
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:40,640
yeah it's just not an easy truth to live

1052
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,640
with

1053
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:51,920
well of course i never met the guy but

1054
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,920
with him getting to marry you

1055
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:58,159
start a family with you and wake up

1056
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,159
every morning to you

1057
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:03,840
i bet he probably died a pretty happy

1058
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,840
and satisfied man

1059
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,159
well

1060
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:31,840
lean over what

1061
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:31,840
kiss break

1062
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,880
get used to this

1063
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,480
but then

1064
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,719
can you remember we only have a few

1065
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:51,199
hours until daylight and reality hits us

1066
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,199
in the face

1067
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:58,960
yeah back to perspective

1068
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:01,360
a few hours can be a lifetime if we use

1069
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,360
it right

1070
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:13,840
for example

1071
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,840

1072
01:11:52,840 --> 01:12:09,840

it's amazing

1075
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:51,840
it's better than any truck

1076
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,480
it's fine

1077
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:33,840

and i see the both of us going back to

1105
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,719
our normal

1106
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,719
boring routines and our normal boring

1107
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:20,480

then i'll avoid eye contact and

1111
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,600
the both of us will hold on to our time

1112
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,760
together as a

1113
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:33,920
treasured secret that we used to get us

1114
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:38,159
through the sad times

01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:39,679
