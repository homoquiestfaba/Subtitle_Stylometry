1
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:28,300
The children must be so
excited for Christmas.

2
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:30,500
They are.

3
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,166
Abby and I were really hoping

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,166
you would come for
Christmas dinner.

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,100
The kids are dying to see you.

6
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:40,834
I appreciate the offer and I
would love to see the children,

7
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:42,300
but I'm on duty.

8
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:46,100
If anything changes,
I'll let you know.

9
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:49,333
The courier
is entering the market.

10
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,867
Got him.

11
00:00:55,567 --> 00:00:57,200
Thank you.

12
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,533
Hey.

13
00:01:01,667 --> 00:01:04,367
They're using the charity
as a cash drop.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,333
Mm-hmm. Bye.

15
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:11,567
I'll stay with the courier.

16
00:01:15,266 --> 00:01:16,867
Package is on the move.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,633
Transport thirty seconds.

18
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:20,734
They split up.
You take the van,

19
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,233
I'll take the package.

20
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:31,066
Subject is approaching Oxford.
Permission to intercept.

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,834
Standby.

22
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,467
She dropped the package.

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,567
I need an answer.

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,220
Arrest authority granted.

25
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:41,333
Confirmed.
Security service!

26
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:42,567
Stop!

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,633
Excellent job, Officer Champion.

28
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,667
No. I lost her.

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,667
She won't get far.
We're working on ID'ing her now.

30
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,633
Good work.

31
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,567
They took the bait.

32
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,567
Perfect.

33
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,367
The bomb squad
cleared the package.

34
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:29,367
Old school tradecraft.

35
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,533
It's a microdot.

36
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:35,100
Nobody's used these
since the cold war.

37
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,367
This is bad.

38
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,400
As bad as it gets.

39
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:42,409
The microdot contains
security profiles

40
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:44,100
for Kensington Palace -
schematics,

41
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:48,567
names of the security detail,
alarm codes, shift changes.

42
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,810
Only someone on the inside could
access this information.

43
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:54,066
It presents an immediate
threat to the Royal Family.

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
Princess Rose -

45
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,467
eldest daughter of
His Majesty the King,

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,333
first in line to the throne.

47
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,467
Prince Edward -
husband to Princess Rose,

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,800
father to Princess Elle
and Prince Robert -

49
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:09,300
second and third in line to
the throne respectively.

50
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,100
Prince Colin - younger
brother to Princess Rose,

51
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:16,200
fourth in line to the throne.

52
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,867
Colin does not
reside at Kensington.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,834
However, he visits frequently

54
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,266
and oversees His Majesty's
Christmas Charity

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,633
on behalf of the family.

56
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:26,166
The threat and the charity
are somehow connected.

57
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,300
I'm declaring this
Crisis Top Secret.

58
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,800
We need our own people
in Kensington ASAP.

59
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,700
There are two immediate
openings in the staff

60
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,333
we can take advantage of -

61
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,166
there's Protection Officer
and Royal Nanny.

62
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,033
Royal Nanny? You're
suggesting an undercover?

63
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,910
An undercover will provide an
extra layer of protection

64
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,033
for the Royals and serve
as an intelligence source

65
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,166
to identify the security breach.

66
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,333
The family will be outraged
if this gets out.

67
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,333
They'll claim
we were spying on them.

68
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:52,600
Better outraged than
the alternative, Sir.

69
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,033
Officer Champion,

70
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:56,867
you'll go undercover
as the Royal Nanny.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,066
Officer Wallace, you'll be added
to the palace Security Detail

72
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,066
to accompany and assist.

73
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,433
Yes, Sir.

74
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:05,834
With all due respect, Sir,

75
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:07,509
I don't think I'm the best fit
for this assignment.

76
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,433
Explain yourself.

77
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:11,500
I was grew up in
a children's home.

78
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,867
I was never adopted.
I never had a family of my own.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,400
I don't know the first thing
about looking after children.

80
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:19,433
I barely had
a childhood of my own.

81
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:23,033
Posing as a nanny in such a
high-profile environment

82
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,700
seems like a non-starter.

83
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,600
Given the urgency
of the situation,

84
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,333
you are the only one
who can do it.

85
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,200
Need I remind you
of the oath you took

86
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,600
to serve King and Country?

87
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:35,367
No, Sir.
I'll do my best.

88
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,767
Good. I'll place a
phone call to the headmistress

89
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,233
of Devonshire Academy
to assist with your cover.

90
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,567
Can she be trusted?

91
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,033
Absolutely!

92
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,700
Ms. Lansbury is one of
our most valued assets.

93
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:53,533
Devonshire Academy -
founded in 1902.

94
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,033
In their 120 years of
proud history,

95
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,000
they have trained thousands
of the best,

96
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:01,433
most respected nannies
in the world.

97
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,767
Current Headmaster,
Ms. Juliet Lansbury

98
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,233
has personally
handpicked the caretakers

99
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,767
of the Royal Children
for the last thirty years.

100
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,500
Right. Let's swap.

101
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:15,000
You go to nanny training and
I'll work security detail.

102
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:17,233
Not on your life.

103
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,066
But you're qualified.
You have kids.

104
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,633
I don't even know if
I want kids or if I like them.

105
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:24,467
Abby holds the frontline
with the kids.

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,567
I'm only backup.

107
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,940
You make it sound like warfare.

108
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,300
It is!

109
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:32,266
Play nice.

110
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,066
Try and make friends.

111
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,266
Why do you think they call
Lansbury "Scary Poppins"?

112
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,734
I have no idea, but I suspect
you'll find out soon enough.

113
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:52,934
Miss Champion!

114
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:55,066
Oh!
You startled me.

115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,433
I startle everyone, apparently.

116
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,300
Scary Poppins.
Ms. Lansbury...

117
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,233
Save the pleasantries.

118
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,900
I was read-in by DG Taylor.

119
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:07,867
Right.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,133
It takes four years of
concentrated study

121
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:13,567
and a year's service
as a probationary nanny

122
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,133
for me to even consider

123
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,567
placing someone
in a Royal household.

124
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,734
We have twenty-four hours.

125
00:06:22,934 --> 00:06:26,233
Do you have
any childcare skills?

126
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:28,233
No.

127
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,633
Do you have younger siblings?

128
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:31,767
No.

129
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,967
Do you have friends
with children?

130
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,166
Oh, my partner has kids.

131
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,400
Romantic partner?

132
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,500
Work partner.

133
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,700
And do you ever
sit for these children?

134
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:45,166
No,

135
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,300
but I was a child myself once.

136
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:56,066
To be a successful nanny,

137
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,800
one must be passionate
about children.

138
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:02,934
This is just
not a teachable skill.

139
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:04,433
I'm afraid...

140
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:06,900
there's simply
nothing I can do for you.

141
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,867
Good day.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,633
Oh. No.
Ms. Lansbury...

143
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,700
I have no doubt

144
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,309
you are the best of
the best in your field.

145
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,233
But I, too, am the best of the
best in my field,

146
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,533
and for better or for worse,

147
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:20,409
I might be the only thing
standing in the way

148
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:22,767
of an immediate threat to the
future of the British Empire.

149
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,700
I swore an oath to protect...

150
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:28,867
To protect King and Country,

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,433
an oath I am willing
to give my life for.

152
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:35,133
But I need your help
to keep that oath,

153
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:38,266
in service to the Crown.

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,767
You're very direct,
sincere, and uncomplicated -

155
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,433
all admirable qualities.

156
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:48,600
The only way you have
the slightest chance

157
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,967
of becoming passable as
a nanny in the time we have

158
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,200
is for me to personally
oversee your training.

159
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,800
Chop-chop.

160
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:02,300
Come on, then.

161
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,100
A nanny is well groomed,

162
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,667
organized, efficient,
but flexible.

163
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,266
She always smiles,
always remains calm,

164
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,967
always nurtures with love.

165
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:15,800
She is properly prepared
for any situation.

166
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:18,166
A nanny will do
whatever is necessary

167
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,700
to stop an attack on her charge.

168
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,533
Threats come in
all shapes and sizes.

169
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:28,100
Your response must be
measured promptly

170
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:30,133
and balanced accordingly.

171
00:08:30,266 --> 00:08:34,500
This is the perfect protection.

172
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,200
You see?
It does not draw attention.

173
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,700
It does not provoke.

174
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:42,633
And yet, it increases
the range and power you have,

175
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,767
against even
the strongest of foes.

176
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:50,100
The canopy acts as a distraction

177
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:53,700
and a shield against the foe.

178
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,800
And it buys you
those precious seconds

179
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:00,834
to measure your response.

180
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:04,700
Every nanny likes
to plan for rain.

181
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:08,500
It might even
save your life and...

182
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:11,934
the life of your charge.

183
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,767
Did you spend time
in the security service?

184
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,600
Oh, that's classified.

185
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:21,266
Let common sense be your guide.

186
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,834
At the end of the day,

187
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,934
a nanny allows
children to be children

188
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:31,066
because she knows in her heart

189
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,166
love always triumphs in the end.

190
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,834
Do you really believe that?

191
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,367
About love?

192
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,900
I must do.
I wrote it.

193
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:44,767
Page eighty-four,
third paragraph.

194
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:52,867
Well done.

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,734
Given adequate time,

196
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:58,266
I could have made an
excellent nanny out of you.

197
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,867
Given just...

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,567
24 hours,

199
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,266
you're as prepared as I
could ever have made you.

200
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,033
I would like to
escort you to Kensington

201
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,934
and provide you with
the proper introductions.

202
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:16,367
This is probably going to be
the undoing of my reputation.

203
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,834
But if it allows you to protect
the Royal Family from harm,

204
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:23,100
so be it.

205
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,533
I was thinking that
I might be old enough

206
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,867
to make do without a nanny.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,400
Really?
What about you, Robert?

208
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:30,767
Elle is right.

209
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,533
I think we're both old
enough to do without one.

210
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,266
Hmm. I see. Perhaps we
could meet her anyway,

211
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,567
give her a chance.

212
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,266
I'd hate to put
someone out of a job,

213
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
especially during the holidays.

214
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,734
And who knows?
She might surprise us.

215
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:48,266
And maybe you'll even like her.
Now, there's a thought.

216
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,300
Come on.

217
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,400
How are you, Juliet?

218
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:57,667
I'm very well, Ma'am.

219
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,467
Might I introduce
Ms. Carter?

220
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,800
So nice to meet you.

221
00:11:01,934 --> 00:11:02,967
Your Highness.

222
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,734
Ms. Carter comes
highly recommended by me.

223
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,333
Welcome to the palace.

224
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,734
These are my little darlings
Elle and Robert.

225
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,233
Your Highnesses.

226
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,900
Pleased to meet you.

227
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:17,710
We look forward to
thriving under your care.

228
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:20,500
Okay.

229
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,667
Claire, this is
my assistant Olivia.

230
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,333
She's going to help
you get settled in.

231
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:27,200
Please follow me, I'll escort
you to your quarters.

232
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,166
Do you think
this one will stick?

233
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:39,266
I think she will prove to be
the nanny you need right now.

234
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,800
I share this as a kindness:

235
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:43,734
I'm pretty sure
no one informed you,

236
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:45,967
but the children
are prone to mischief.

237
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,266
What sort of mischief?

238
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,000
Pranks mostly.

239
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,266
More often than not
they're harmless.

240
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,333
Some of them have sent
a nanny or two packing.

241
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,266
Well, I assure you,
I'm no shrinking violet.

242
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,800
They all say that at first.

243
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,400
Here you are.

244
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:05,133
Thank you.

245
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm inside.

246
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:19,533
Welcome back.
Any red flags?

247
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,233
No. So far so good.
But I'll be in touch.

248
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,300
Hello.

249
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm so glad you're both here.

250
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:04,467
I believe you left
a few things behind.

251
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,934
She's a tricky one.

252
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:14,367
We're going to need reinforcements.

253
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:18,100
Both:
Uncle Colin!

254
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,767
- What's the emergency?
- It's the new nanny.

255
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,200
Another one?
Well, what's she done?

256
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:29,867
She foiled every one
of our welcome pranks.

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,567
So, she's a bit tougher
than the others, is she?

258
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,533
Well, I suppose we'll just
have to come up something

259
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,967
absolutely foolproof, won't we?

260
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,500
Come on.

261
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,767
Ah, the old bucket on
the door trick, it never fails.

262
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,867
Hello there!

263
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,700
Your Highness.
I'm Ms. Carter.

264
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,133
The new nanny.

265
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:58,100
Oh. Uh... hello.

266
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:00,700
Er, welcome.

267
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:03,166
Erm...

268
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,433
The children were quite eager
for me to meet you. Hmm?

269
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,166
Oh. Well, it's lovely
of you to make the time.

270
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,133
I think you'll find

271
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:14,700
I'm quite fond
of my niece and nephew,

272
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:18,600
and I take great interest in
anyone charged with their care.

273
00:14:18,734 --> 00:14:20,266
As you should be.

274
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,834
Children, let's leave

275
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:25,834
to allow Ms. Carter
to settle in.

276
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:27,333
Aren't you forgetting something?

277
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,133
What's that?

278
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:36,300
Well played.

279
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:39,133
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

280
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:49,200
Rose:
How are you getting on?

281
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:53,000
The children went out of their
way to make me feel welcome.

282
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,200
Really?

283
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:57,467
I love my children
with all my heart,

284
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,967
but they can be spirited,
to say the least.

285
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:04,033
No. I found them...
absolutely delightful.

286
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,233
Oh, I don't think I believe you.

287
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:08,200
Alas, have a good evening.

288
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:20,166
There we all are.

289
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,333
What have you done to yourself?

290
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:25,333
Oh. Erm...

291
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,734
Our cooking lesson
got a bit out of hand.

292
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,700
Oh, really?

293
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:33,600
So, how do we like
Claire so far?

294
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:36,433
It's too soon to tell
if we like her just yet.

295
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,433
But we don't dislike her.

296
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:42,033
- Colin?
- She's clever... too clever.

297
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,000
Well, at least that's a start.

298
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,967
This could be
a Christmas miracle.

299
00:16:01,266 --> 00:16:03,467
Security service!
Open the door!

300
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,467
We know you're in there.

301
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Open the door!

302
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,600
Ready for sweep.

303
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:17,900
- All clear!
- Yes, sir.

304
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,333
The threat is not only credible,
it's already set in motion.

305
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:39,166
My darlings,
I hate to be the bearer

306
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,333
of bad news this morning, but...

307
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:46,834
Father won't be
home for Christmas.

308
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:50,233
We need him more
than the Royal Air Force.

309
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,000
He'll be home after the New Year

310
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,233
and we can celebrate
Christmas with him then.

311
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:55,407
But it won't be Christmas;

312
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:56,800
it will be just another day.

313
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,667
I know.
I'm so sorry, darling.

314
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,967
I wish there was
something I could do.

315
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,867
I got a school project I could
use your help with, Mum.

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,834
I'd be delighted.
When is it due?

317
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,734
End of the week.
It should only take a few hours.

318
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,400
Let's schedule some time.

319
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,834
I'm sorry. I just don't see
how it's possible, Ma'am.

320
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,967
We're overextended as it is,
and then we'll be traveling.

321
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,800
We must be able to squeeze
a few hours out of somewhere.

322
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:23,900
I'll look at the schedule, see
if I can move something, but...

323
00:17:24,033 --> 00:17:25,300
I'll just ask the tutor.

324
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,500
No, it's not that I don't
want to help, Robert.

325
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:31,200
Pardon the interruption,
but the car is ready for us.

326
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,967
Let's pick this up
tonight, okay?

327
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,967
We have an engagement.
We won't be home until late.

328
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:48,633
I was sorry to hear your father
won't be here for Christmas.

329
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,667
I know what it's like
to miss one's family,

330
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,200
especially around the holiday.

331
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:54,500
This is Officer Wallace.

332
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:56,109
He'll be our security
for the next few weeks.

333
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:58,633
Good Morning, children.

334
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,433
Off to a running start, I see.

335
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,700
This was not my doing.

336
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,600
But it wasn't, I swear.

337
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:11,300
Not entirely.

338
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:14,433
Why the umbrella?
There isn't a cloud in the sky.

339
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:18,066
Oh, well,
a nanny always plans for rain.

340
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:45,600
Have a good day.
We'll see you after school.

341
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,567
Vance needs us to come in.

342
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,667
Okay.

343
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,066
Amanda Young.

344
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,033
You served together in the SAS.

345
00:19:05,166 --> 00:19:06,667
What are you planning?

346
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,900
It's only a matter of time
before we have Young in custody,

347
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:13,266
and it will go easier on you,
if you give her up now.

348
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,367
Put an end to it willingly.

349
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,200
Michael Ford and Amanda Young -
both ex-military.

350
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,400
Young's been
surveilling the Princess

351
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:29,934
and the children for some time.

352
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:32,100
I can't be sure if we've delayed

353
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,533
whatever it is that she's
planning or hastened it.

354
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:37,333
Do we have his phone?

355
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,343
He managed to ditch it before
we took him into custody.

356
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:41,333
Do we have anything
on the van driver?

357
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:42,900
Employed by
the transport company

358
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,734
contracted with
the Christmas Charity.

359
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:47,200
Does Young work for
the Christmas Charity?

360
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,333
We're looking into it.

361
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,266
It's staffed primarily
by volunteers.

362
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,042
There are very few people
actually in their employ,

363
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,266
and volunteer records
are spotty at best.

364
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,533
Right.
Let's retrace Ford's steps,

365
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,467
see if we can't find his phone.

366
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:06,166
Have you, er, met him yet?

367
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,367
We've crossed paths.

368
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,433
He was named England's most
eligible bachelor by the Times.

369
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:13,500
Why do you know that?

370
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:17,000
Abby told me.

371
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,100
Doesn't every woman want to
find their Prince Charming?

372
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:23,233
He's not so much
of a Prince Charming;

373
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:26,367
more like a Prince of Pranks.

374
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,533
Let's go find Ford's phone.

375
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:31,333
- Hello.
- Hi.

376
00:20:31,467 --> 00:20:34,333
- Do you have a lost and found?
- We do. What did you lose?

377
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,767
I think I dropped my phone
here yesterday.

378
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,166
Oh. We did have a phone
that turned up.

379
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,367
Is this it?

380
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Oh my goodness! Yes!

381
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:45,967
Thank you! Thank you.

382
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:48,900
That could belong to anyone.

383
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:50,400
No. It's his. Trust me.

384
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:52,100
How can you be so sure?

385
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,934
Elementary, my dear Wallace!

386
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:57,333
I'm a criminal,

387
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:58,834
I'm about to be
taken into custody,

388
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:00,900
I drop my phone in
the Christmas lot,

389
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:02,300
then come back to recover it

390
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:05,800
or get it from
the lost and found.

391
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,834
We're headed to Frogmore House.

392
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:11,667
Colin's residence?

393
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,567
Has there been
a change of plans?

394
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,467
Heightened security protocols.

395
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,166
Delaying our travel orders until
the last minute prevents leaks.

396
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,400
How was school today?

397
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:34,567
Have either of you
given any thought

398
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,433
to what you want for Christmas?

399
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:41,333
I bet you both love
getting socks.

400
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:47,400
Perhaps... laundry soap,

401
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:50,433
dental floss, shoelaces,

402
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,767
bowling balls,
a bag of tweezers,

403
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,400
toenail clippings.

404
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:57,967
- A bag of toenail clippings?
- Eww!

405
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,467
Who would possibly want a bag of
toenail clippings for Christmas?

406
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,166
Well, I suspect absolutely no
one anywhere who ever lived.

407
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,580
I was just
trying to get you both

408
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:08,133
to break your vow of silence.

409
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:09,900
Well played.

410
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,033
You're not like all
the other nannies, are you?

411
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,066
I most certainly am not,

412
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,880
and I intend to take
that as the compliment

413
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:19,767
you did not intend it to be.

414
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:26,066
Hello, children.

415
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,467
Welcome to Frogmore.

416
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,300
I'm Price -
Colin's security man.

417
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:30,433
Thank you. Hi.

418
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,967
Oh, hi!
Oh, come here.

419
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,033
Good. Come on in.

420
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,467
Thank you, Nanny.

421
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,609
You will not be needed for
the rest of the afternoon.

422
00:22:40,633 --> 00:22:41,967
I'm on duty.

423
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,333
I must remain with
the children at all times.

424
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:46,867
There is no service you can
provide my niece and nephew

425
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,233
over the next few hours

426
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,166
that I cannot
perform diligently,

427
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,800
and your presence will only
impose upon our privacy.

428
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:57,213
I'm gonna need to clear
that with Princess Rose.

429
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,900
Oh, by all means, feel free.

430
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:01,233
And after my sister has told you

431
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:02,700
exactly what I have
just told you,

432
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:07,200
you can remain outside until
we're finished... Nanny.

433
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:17,633
I see you've made another fast
friend among the Royals.

434
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:19,467
That was my doing.

435
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:37,300
Wallace, what's going on?

436
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,509
Something trigged
the silent alarm in the kitchen.

437
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,500
I'm on my way.

438
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:49,233
I'm afraid you've caught me.

439
00:23:49,367 --> 00:23:51,400
If it's not too much to ask,

440
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,934
could we keep this between us?

441
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,633
Okay.

442
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,266
Stand down.

443
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,533
All clear.
False alarm.

444
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:04,033
What's all this?

445
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,867
Someone triggered
the silent alarm, Ma'am.

446
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,200
What silent alarm?

447
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:09,467
Heightened security measures
were installed today.

448
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,500
Why was I not informed?

449
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,467
Ms. Morgan
should have briefed you.

450
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,166
Top of my list for the morning.

451
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,533
I am so sorry.
I think this is all my fault.

452
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,867
I came down to make a snack

453
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,600
and I
must have set off the alarm.

454
00:24:23,734 --> 00:24:25,333
What's your name, Officer?

455
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:26,867
Wallace, Ma'am.

456
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,433
Officer Wallace,

457
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,976
from here on out,
I wish to be briefed directly

458
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,100
on matters of security.
Do you understand?

459
00:24:33,233 --> 00:24:35,967
Yes, Ma'am.
I'll make sure of it.

460
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,300
Oh, you wish
to be briefed right now.

461
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:42,533
- Yes, please.
- Very well.

462
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,533
We've been made aware
of a credible threat

463
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:49,867
against you and the children.

464
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,934
We've responded with
heightened security measures

465
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:53,500
and additional security detail.

466
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:54,967
Rose:
Should I be concerned?

467
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,767
Is this threat more
credible than most?

468
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,800
We take all threats
against the Crown seriously.

469
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:02,367
For now, allow us to do
the worrying for you, Ma'am.

470
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,266
We are very good at our job,
and we are well-trained,

471
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,433
and we are dedicated to keeping
you and your family safe.

472
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,900
Very well.
Thank you, Wallace.

473
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:15,333
I think we've had enough
excitement for one evening.

474
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,600
Everyone should make
their way back to bed.

475
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,433
Sweet dreams to all.

476
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:23,266
Claire, stay behind, would you?

477
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,867
Oh, of course.

478
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,700
Thank you for covering.
It means a lot.

479
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:34,000
It's my pleasure.

480
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,133
Cocoa?

481
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:44,500
There we are.

482
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:45,633
Thank you.

483
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,767
Mm. It's delicious.

484
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,834
It's a family recipe.

485
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:56,200
Handed down from
generation to generation.

486
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,200
Mm-hm.

487
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,613
You'll come to
find the palace is

488
00:25:58,734 --> 00:26:01,667
a special place to
be at Christmas time.

489
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,266
How are you getting on?

490
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,633
Oh, uh.

491
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:08,467
Well, I... I think.

492
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,000
Why? What have you heard?

493
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:13,166
Oh, well, I'm not one
to spread palace gossip.

494
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,333
All I will say is you really
seem to be holding your own.

495
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:18,000
Fair enough.

496
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,076
You know,
I wish I could say the same.

497
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,133
With Edward away
I've had to take on more than

498
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,000
my fair share of royal duties.

499
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:29,734
And add to that the state
of heightened security.

500
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,900
Admittedly, I'm struggling.

501
00:26:35,033 --> 00:26:38,967
Gosh, I feel so guilty
even saying that out loud.

502
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,967
No.

503
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,600
I have so much help, and...

504
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,834
and so much to be grateful for.

505
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:47,567
It troubles me
when protocol dictates

506
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,734
that I spend more time in the
company of my loyal subjects

507
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:52,900
than... than with my own children.

508
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:56,076
And here I am trying to
make up for it in the middle of

509
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,066
the night with packed lunches,
it's...

510
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,500
I don't know.
It's absurd, isn't it?

511
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:05,734
No. No. It's... wonderful.

512
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:10,166
As Ms. Lansbury would
say if she were here...

513
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,576
Your children just want
to know that you're engaged

514
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,567
and present in their lives.

515
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,400
So, if packed lunches is
how you do that, then so be it.

516
00:27:19,533 --> 00:27:21,500
Thank you.

517
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:24,000
That does actually make me
feel slightly less terrible.

518
00:27:26,533 --> 00:27:28,000
Cheers.

519
00:27:35,066 --> 00:27:36,734
Rose:
I think we could make that work.

520
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:39,533
Robert, we've managed
to make time for me to help

521
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,834
with your project
on Thursday night.

522
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:44,200
Elle, we're working on
scheduling a video call

523
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,400
with father.

524
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,166
I'm afraid it's a bit tricky.

525
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,166
I keep running
into military protocol,

526
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,420
restricting non-military
use of their secure satellite

527
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,533
during deployment.

528
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:54,633
Well, keep trying.
I have faith in you.

529
00:28:07,467 --> 00:28:08,834
Who's responsible for this?

530
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,734
I will get to the bottom of this
if it's the last thing I do.

531
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:21,100
This is Wallace,
we need another vehicle asap.

532
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,133
Did you do this on your own?

533
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:24,934
No, I thought maybe you did.

534
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:26,066
No.

535
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,633
Thank you for
being a good sport.

536
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:33,800
How did you manage
to get so many ornaments?

537
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:37,233
Well, a nanny is prepared
for any situation.

538
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,333
Speaking of,
when you served in the RAF,

539
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,027
how difficult was it
for you to schedule

540
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,433
a video call with someone?

541
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:45,667
Difficult, not impossible.

542
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,100
Requires a lot of leg work.

543
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:48,633
Depends mostly on scheduling

544
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:50,633
and available time on
the secure satellite.

545
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,133
And bending a rule or two.

546
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:55,767
Could you see
about scheduling a call

547
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,400
with the family with Edward?

548
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:59,000
I'll look into it.

549
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:01,000
Thank you.

550
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:05,233
Come on.

551
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:08,900
So, have you sacked that
annoyingly clever new nanny yet?

552
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:11,533
I'm afraid Claire may be
with us for the duration.

553
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,734
What could possibly
make you say that?

554
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:14,900
See for yourself.

555
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,033
Who's responsible for this?

556
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:26,633
Outstanding.

557
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:29,000
The children have
certainly outdone themselves.

558
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,166
It wasn't the children.

559
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,367
It was Claire.

560
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,633
What? No.

561
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:35,967
No, I don't believe that.

562
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:39,400
It's true. She made
the effort to win them over.

563
00:29:39,533 --> 00:29:41,066
And it seems to have worked.

564
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,633
They thought it was the funniest
thing they'd ever seen.

565
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:46,233
She comes across
as so prim and proper.

566
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,467
Well, there's clearly more
to her than meets the eye.

567
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,166
I know she's only been
with us a short time,

568
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,233
but I feel as if
I can confide in her.

569
00:29:53,367 --> 00:29:55,233
Are you sure that's wise?

570
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:58,867
You have been wrong before.

571
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,233
I'm only looking out for you.

572
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,667
I know you are, it's sweet.

573
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,967
I can't quite explain why,
Call it intuition if you will,

574
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,567
but something
tells me Claire has

575
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,633
all our best interests at heart.

576
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,900
It's very good, Robert.

577
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:24,066
He's getting better.

578
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,367
Yes.

579
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,967
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

580
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,140
I've managed a surprise,
but we only have a few more

581
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:32,200
minutes with
the secure satellite.

582
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,500
Come here, Robert.

583
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,033
Father.

584
00:30:37,166 --> 00:30:38,700
Edward:
Hello, my darlings.

585
00:30:38,834 --> 00:30:40,834
I'm told I'm missed at home.

586
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:42,000
Terribly.

587
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,200
Where are you?

588
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,834
I'm not allowed to say.

589
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:46,033
It's not important.

590
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,867
Tell me everything
that's going on at home.

591
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,400
Well, Robert's been
practicing his violin.

592
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:53,000
He's been working so hard.

593
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:54,453
Let's give them privacy,
shall we?

594
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:57,567
You're overstepping your duties.

595
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:02,834
I was just trying to do
something nice for the family.

596
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,880
Plus, arranging a call
was not as difficult

597
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,333
as you made it out to be.

598
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:14,133
Rules of protocol
exist to be followed.

599
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,400
Mm-hm.

600
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:20,400
We miss you so much.
How's it going out there?

601
00:31:20,533 --> 00:31:22,934
Could you look
into Olivia for me?

602
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:24,133
See what you can find.

603
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:26,300
There's something
I don't trust about her.

604
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
Okay.

605
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,867
Thank you for
the lovely surprise.

606
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:37,700
I just pulled a few
strings with Wallace's help.

607
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:38,867
Thank you, Wallace.

608
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,133
My pleasure, ma'am.

609
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,200
We're so accustomed
to things being asked of us,

610
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,367
it's rare when
someone presents us

611
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,300
with such a selfless
and thoughtful kindness.

612
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:53,600
Have a good day.

613
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:55,066
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

614
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:01,600
You were right. They found
something on that phone.

615
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:09,333
Young used her access
through the charity to get

616
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,967
a little too close for
comfort to the Royals.

617
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,333
I need you to extend the scope
of your watch to Prince Colin.

618
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:19,667
Are we looking at him
as a suspect or a target?

619
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,633
We must be open
to any possibilities.

620
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:24,166
History teaches us
that even the best of men

621
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,934
would commit unspeakable
acts to sit upon the throne.

622
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:42,633
Consider me impressed.

623
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:44,166
No, really.

624
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,266
Princess Rose does nothing
but sing your praises.

625
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,266
Your instincts are very good.

626
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,600
You just continue
to follow them.

627
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,533
I could use
your instincts in a...

628
00:32:58,667 --> 00:32:59,667
a delicate matter.

629
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,667
Do you think Colin is
capable of harming his family?

630
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,033
You think he's in on it?

631
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:08,533
Don't waste your time.

632
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,400
He adores his sister
and he loves those children

633
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:12,934
as if they were his own.

634
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:15,600
But even if it meant
wearing the crown?

635
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:19,433
The crown is not
something Colin aspires to.

636
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:24,433
Our prime suspect has gotten
close to Colin and the charity.

637
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:28,166
So, I've been ordered
to include him in my watch.

638
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,700
Only problem is
he's not my biggest fan.

639
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,474
In fact, he's banned me
from the residence

640
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:34,934
when the children are visiting.

641
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:38,500
Is there any way
I can smooth things over?

642
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:42,433
Ms. Lansbury, please.

643
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:45,967
If Colin is not involved
he might be a target.

644
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:49,767
I can't protect him
if I can't get near him.

645
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,367
In that case, I know
exactly what you need to do.

646
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,066
Look who it is. Hello!

647
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Thank you, nanny.

648
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:07,000
Your services
will not be required.

649
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,633
I'm invoking
the Lansbury Nanny Protocol.

650
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:12,266
A Lansbury nanny
must always be within

651
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,967
arm's reach of
her children while on duty.

652
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,100
If you interfere with
the performance of said duties

653
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:21,166
I would be forced to
inform Ms. Lansbury herself.

654
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,734
And you will have to
deal with her directly

655
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:26,667
and in person.

656
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,433
Scary Poppins.

657
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:32,133
As I was saying,
before you interrupted me,

658
00:34:32,266 --> 00:34:33,767
you're welcome to join us.

659
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,166
However, your entry
is conditional.

660
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,834
On what?

661
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:42,433
On proving that
you can have fun.

662
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,400
Challenge accepted.

663
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:49,767
Welcome to my home.

664
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:07,333
I love the Christmas decor.

665
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,166
I keep it up year round.

666
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,100
Every day is Christmas
at Uncle Colin's.

667
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:15,400
Are they being serious?

668
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:17,367
They're just teasing you.

669
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:21,700
It looks like
Santa's workshop in here.

670
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:24,314
I think it's important that we
be hands on in our charity work.

671
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:27,266
So, we wrap as many of
the gifts as we can ourselves.

672
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,734
I didn't know the children
were involved in the charity.

673
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:31,533
It's their first year.

674
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:33,200
They aren't exactly
thrilled about it,

675
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:35,567
but that's because
they have yet to learn

676
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,900
that hard work builds character.

677
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,433
Mm.

678
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:42,166
At first glance I didn't take
you for a Christmas cheerleader.

679
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,100
No? Well, perhaps we're both
worthy of a second glance.

680
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,333
What?

681
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,700
Maybe we could
play charades with her.

682
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:56,834
With her?

683
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,900
Yeah.

684
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Really?

685
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,433
Yeah, we really
do need a fourth.

686
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:02,367
Sorry, a fourth for what?

687
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,500
Alright, and go.

688
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,433
Uh, shoelaces.

689
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,300
Doing your laces.

690
00:36:11,433 --> 00:36:12,834
You're dancing.

691
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:14,967
Um, ice skating! Ice skating!

692
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,200
- Yes.
- Yes!

693
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,166
Robert.

694
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,567
Three, two, one, go.

695
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,276
Big, giant. So strong
you're full of muscles.

696
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,100
You're so strong
you're carrying a...

697
00:36:26,233 --> 00:36:27,934
Oh, oh, you're Father Christmas.

698
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,409
You're Father Christmas.
Is that it?

699
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:31,233
No, there's more. Sorry. No.

700
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:32,800
Why are you yelling at me?

701
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:36,500
Because I'm naughty.
I've been naughty. Sorry.

702
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:37,943
Is there more?
Santa clause is coming to town?

703
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:39,333
Five seconds!

704
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:40,800
It's got... What, uh.. uh...

705
00:36:40,934 --> 00:36:42,333
Naughtiness!

706
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,000
Naughty? Didn't I say that?

707
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:48,000
And go!

708
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:50,100
Okay.

709
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:51,500
Giant nanny bag.

710
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:53,967
No, this is not your turn.

711
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,667
Actually, help her. Help her.

712
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,100
Father Christmas.

713
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:58,266
No!

714
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,500
Santa's sack?

715
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,133
Sack of toys. Sack of toys!

716
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:04,800
We should get a point for that.

717
00:37:04,934 --> 00:37:06,166
We have to consult the judge.

718
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,333
The judge will allow it.

719
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:09,507
That makes it two nothing.

720
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:12,867
You better catch up.

721
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,333
You're quite competitive.

722
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:15,633
What?

723
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,333
You fit right in.

724
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:23,400
Oh. Oh? Oh!

725
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:27,000
Love. Um. Flies. Um.

726
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,066
Mistletoe!

727
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,533
- Yes! Mistletoe!
- Yes!

728
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,000
Well done.

729
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:33,367
That's game.

730
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,367
We trounced you.

731
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,367
Oh.

732
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,000
The girls win.

733
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,776
The children seem to have
taken quite a liking to you.

734
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,633
Not something that I've
witnessed with previous nannies.

735
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:45,800
And I admit,
you do know how to have fun.

736
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:47,734
Well, thank you.

737
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:49,367
What do you say?

738
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,633
Should we induct Claire
into the Royal Fun Club?

739
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:55,667
The Royal Fun Club?

740
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,880
You're in the headquarters.

741
00:37:56,934 --> 00:37:58,033
Okay.

742
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,633
It's a place where
there is no royal protocol.

743
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:02,633
Only good fun and games.

744
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:05,266
It's a place where
royal children can be children.

745
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,967
We need to have
a proper ceremony.

746
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,033
Yes, fetch me my sword. Mm?

747
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:12,967
Thank you.

748
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,133
Please, take...

749
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:16,467
Oh, oh. My sheath.

750
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,233
Yes.

751
00:38:18,367 --> 00:38:19,567
Thank you.

752
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,967
Uh, please. Take a knee.

753
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,200
Ms. Carter.

754
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:27,033
I dub thee Dame...

755
00:38:27,166 --> 00:38:28,200
Oh!
Carter.

756
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,100
Oh, well. Dame.

757
00:38:31,233 --> 00:38:33,400
Rise, Dame Carter.

758
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:36,367
Order of the Royal Fun Club.

759
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,200
Thank you, thank you.
One and all. Thank you.

760
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:45,209
How long have you been involved
in the Christmas charity?

761
00:38:45,233 --> 00:38:47,133
Since I was about Robert's age.

762
00:38:47,266 --> 00:38:50,133
Well, I think it's
a very worthwhile endeavor.

763
00:38:50,266 --> 00:38:52,700
I'm glad you feel that way.

764
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:55,700
How would you feel about
volunteering for us tomorrow,

765
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,133
while the children
are at school?

766
00:38:57,266 --> 00:38:58,467
I'd love to.

767
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,100
Wonderful.

768
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:03,300
Well done, Robert.

769
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,943
Great. Thank you for
putting those together.

770
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:14,567
So, you can bring
those over to the...

771
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:21,867
Uh, to the van.
Just over there. Thank you.

772
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:27,367
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

773
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,266
This is quite the operation.

774
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,934
Well, I'm glad you're impressed.

775
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:34,433
Are you ready to get to work?

776
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:35,567
Absolutely.

777
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:41,166
Can I ask you something?

778
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,300
Certainly.

779
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:46,433
Why do you put so much effort
into a charity that, um...

780
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,333
that you don't really have to?

781
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:52,633
Oh, I think what
you're trying to say is,

782
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,976
"Colin, why don't you let
the staff handle the day to day

783
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,734
while you work
on your polo game?"

784
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:02,100
That is a tad more delicate
than I was going to put it,

785
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,667
but, um, essentially yes.

786
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,934
Well, I suppose
it's selfish, really.

787
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:11,100
Growing up as a royal,
as I'm sure you can imagine,

788
00:40:11,233 --> 00:40:13,767
I was lavished with
all sorts of extravagant gifts

789
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,967
at Christmas time,
and it didn't take long for

790
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,633
the novelty to wear off,

791
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:21,300
but I've discovered through
charity that giving gifts

792
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:24,333
brings me much more joy than
any gift I've ever received.

793
00:40:24,467 --> 00:40:25,467
No matter how grand.

794
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:30,333
Ah.

795
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:32,033
James Wilder.

796
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:34,200
Richest man in England.

797
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,967
Trying to get him to donate
is like trying to pull teeth

798
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,667
from someone who has no teeth.

799
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,000
James, welcome.

800
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:45,333
We start taking requests from
children's houses in October.

801
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:47,267
I like to think of us
as being in the business

802
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:49,100
of Christmas wish fulfillment.

803
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:51,700
To call it a business,
it would mean it was profitable.

804
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:54,867
The idea is to acquire
a gift for each and every child

805
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,166
who participates so they
have something to look forward

806
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,500
to for the holidays,
the exact thing they asked for.

807
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:03,166
Well, I feel my money would
be better served elsewhere.

808
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,200
What can I do to convince you?

809
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,567
I can tell you
firsthand the difference

810
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,533
a Christmas charity can
make in a child's life.

811
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:12,233
Please, enlighten me.

812
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:14,567
I grew up in a children's home.

813
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,000
Christmas charity was
a constant we could rely on.

814
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:21,400
It made Christmas special.

815
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:23,609
Something to look forward to
despite not being able to

816
00:41:23,633 --> 00:41:25,333
spend it with our families.

817
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:27,767
I would rather establish
programs to help the children

818
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,066
overcome their circumstances
than provide them with a luxury

819
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,033
for one day.

820
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:36,433
I understand that,
but a toy is not a luxury.

821
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:39,433
It's a hope and joy.

822
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:42,333
It reminds us
that the world cares.

823
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:44,734
You can't assign a value
to that in a ledger,

824
00:41:44,867 --> 00:41:46,533
because it's priceless.

825
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:50,533
The joy of receiving a gift on
Christmas day can give a child,

826
00:41:50,667 --> 00:41:53,333
can empower them to
take on even life's

827
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:56,333
most difficult of circumstances.

828
00:41:56,467 --> 00:41:58,533
Where did you find
this ringer, Colin?

829
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:01,233
Claire is nanny to
my niece and nephew.

830
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:02,633
You're the nanny?

831
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:07,467
Yes, um, what if you bought
one toy for one child?

832
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
See how it made you feel.
If it brought you joy,

833
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:12,166
maybe you could
buy more next year.

834
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,633
I will personally donate
100 pounds if you agree

835
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,300
to match my donation.

836
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:21,967
Em, uh, how many children
does 200 pounds provide for?

837
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,500
That would secure
gifts for four children.

838
00:42:24,633 --> 00:42:26,266
Four?

839
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,300
Four children who'll have a much

840
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:31,000
happier Christmas
because of you.

841
00:42:31,133 --> 00:42:33,467
Come on, don't you believe that

842
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,467
a genuine act of kindness
around the holidays can

843
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,333
fill a child's world with hope?

844
00:42:40,467 --> 00:42:43,133
How many gifts short are
you of making your quota?

845
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:45,734
Oh, roughly 1000.

846
00:42:47,367 --> 00:42:49,500
I'll cover what remains.

847
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:52,467
Thank you.

848
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,242
Thank you, truly, this will
make a tremendous difference

849
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:56,934
in the lives of
so many children.

850
00:42:57,066 --> 00:42:59,400
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Claire.

851
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:01,667
Pleasure was all mine, sir.

852
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,800
Thank you.

853
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,333
Sorry.

854
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:11,834
I have been after him for ages.

855
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:13,576
You know, I think
he took sinister delight in

856
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,000
turning me down year after year.

857
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:18,333
I don't know how to thank you.

858
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:19,467
You are...

859
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:22,367
not like the other nannies.

860
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,800
- Do you...
- The Children.

861
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:31,200
- I should...
- The children.

862
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,700
- I need to get the children.
- You... Yes, you should.

863
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:35,300
- Right now.
- Yes, of course.

864
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:36,900
Okay. Goodbye.

865
00:43:51,867 --> 00:43:53,343
We were hoping you might
take us Christmas shopping.

866
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:54,934
We want to buy
a gift for mother.

867
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,300
We'd like it to be a surprise.

868
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:57,467
Absolutely.

869
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,166
What were you thinking?

870
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:09,800
My main concern
is being recognized

871
00:44:09,934 --> 00:44:12,333
by any royal watchers
and causing a scene.

872
00:44:12,467 --> 00:44:13,800
Maybe you could shop for them.

873
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:17,200
No, the point of this is
they want to do it themselves.

874
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:18,834
Claire is right.

875
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:21,934
We wanted to pick out
a gift for her together.

876
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,000
I'll call in the backup detail.

877
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:38,634
You have the store
locked down for 30 minutes.

878
00:44:38,734 --> 00:44:39,800
Plenty of time.

879
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Do you have any idea what
you want to get your mother?

880
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:48,166
It's difficult to shop for her.

881
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,000
She gets so many
gifts all year round.

882
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:53,166
Not just for Christmas.

883
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,200
Mm, that's a tough one.

884
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:57,643
What about getting
your mum something

885
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,700
you can experience together?

886
00:44:59,834 --> 00:45:02,033
Does she like puzzles?

887
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:05,333
She does. She told us
how much she enjoyed them

888
00:45:05,467 --> 00:45:06,600
when she was our age.

889
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,934
This all look like so much fun.

890
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,467
How about these marbles? These.

891
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:22,166
Mm.

892
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,266
Now, since your mother seems to
be the woman who has everything

893
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,934
in regards to gifts...

894
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:32,500
how about we get her
the world and everything in it?

895
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:33,700
Brilliant.

896
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:34,834
I love it.

897
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,500
I don't think
we need it gift wrapped.

898
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:40,367
We're sort of professionals
in that department.

899
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,500
Come on.

900
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:53,767
We want both children.

901
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:08,333
On my signal.

902
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,500
We're blocked in.

903
00:46:13,633 --> 00:46:15,333
Walk away. Walk away.

904
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,467
We welcome their royal
highnesses to this year's

905
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,900
Christmas tree lighting.
Three, two, one.

906
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:03,867
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

907
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,480
I'm surprised to
see you here tonight.

908
00:47:05,533 --> 00:47:07,300
The children invited me.

909
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:10,166
It's a welcome surprise.

910
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,700
Um...

911
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:14,567
Uh, shall we?

912
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,700
Yes.

913
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:25,867
The Christmas wishing fountain.

914
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,300
Who needs a coin?

915
00:47:27,433 --> 00:47:29,967
Me. Thank you.

916
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,967
That.

917
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,100
Thank you.

918
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,066
My wish is to have father
home in time for Christmas.

919
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:42,500
That's my wish, too.

920
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:44,667
Maybe if we all
make the same wish

921
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,834
it'll have a better
chance of coming true.

922
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:49,867
Well, in that case,
I'll add mine to the cause.

923
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,533
On the count of three.

924
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:52,700
Three.

925
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:55,800
Two. One. Make a wish!

926
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:03,800
Aren't you going
to make your wish?

927
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:04,934
Yes.

928
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,367
What did you wish for?

929
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,567
If I tell you,
it might not come true.

930
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,700
Okay.

931
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:24,100
You've gone from
being dismissive to taking

932
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:26,600
more than a passing
interest in Claire.

933
00:48:26,734 --> 00:48:28,967
I take great interest in
anyone charge with the care

934
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,900
of my niece and nephew.

935
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,900
Do you like her?

936
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:36,400
Absolutely. Claire has proven to
be wonderful with the children.

937
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,367
I'm glad to see
you've come around.

938
00:48:48,734 --> 00:48:51,066
I'm sorry to have to
do this to you, Robert,

939
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,467
but I won't be able to
help your project tonight.

940
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,200
But you promised.

941
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,767
I know, I'm so sorry, darling.

942
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,433
Grandfather needs Uncle Colin
and I to fill in last minute.

943
00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:04,967
He isn't feeling very well.

944
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,100
It's rubbish, isn't it?

945
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:09,934
I know.

946
00:49:10,066 --> 00:49:11,543
All the travel
arrangements have been made.

947
00:49:11,567 --> 00:49:14,600
You'll be flying
out of Heathrow.

948
00:49:14,734 --> 00:49:16,800
Thank you.

949
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:21,133
But we can still have fun
before we go, can't we?

950
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,367
How about a pancake?

951
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,934
To go with the chocolate milk.

952
00:49:26,066 --> 00:49:27,266
- Wash it down.
- Thank you.

953
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:32,876
Are we able to
ground a flight leaving

954
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,300
out of Heathrow this evening?

955
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:36,433
Do I want to know why?

956
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:39,700
It's a matter of
domestic security.

957
00:49:41,734 --> 00:49:44,500
Only DG Taylor
can give that order.

958
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:46,233
But, um,
I'll put in the request.

959
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,600
Thank you.

960
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,166
Okay.

961
00:50:01,934 --> 00:50:02,800
Ooh.

962
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:03,934
Oh, nope.

963
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,100
Close.

964
00:50:05,233 --> 00:50:06,467
Oh!

965
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,934
So, this must be what
they meant by reindeer games.

966
00:50:09,066 --> 00:50:12,000
Our plane was grounded
with mechanical issues.

967
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:14,934
Uh, come along, Elle.
As soon as I change,

968
00:50:15,066 --> 00:50:16,967
we will all work together
on Robert's project.

969
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,800
Come play with us first!

970
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:20,300
We have work to do.

971
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:21,667
Please?

972
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,200
Pretty please?

973
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,633
Just one game.

974
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:26,767
One game.

975
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,934
But you have to be the reindeer.

976
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:31,166
I think Claire is
doing a terribly good job

977
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,166
being the reindeer.

978
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,867
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

979
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,600
Let's all play!

980
00:50:38,734 --> 00:50:40,467
Oh, shall we?

981
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,633
Well, I do think that it's my

982
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:47,934
sworn duty as a member
of the Royal Fun Club.

983
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:49,934
Oh, okay.

984
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:50,934
Go!

985
00:50:51,066 --> 00:50:52,066
Not even close.

986
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,767
Oh.

987
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,100
Are you aiming for my face?

988
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,900
Whoa!

989
00:51:01,033 --> 00:51:02,367
- Yes!
- Yeah!

990
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,333
Oh!

991
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:06,667
For all of Christmas.

992
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,734
Not even close.

993
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,900
Well, I stand corrected.

994
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:15,533
I believe that my sister
is the superior reindeer.

995
00:51:15,667 --> 00:51:18,533
I'm sure it's all good practice
for wearing the crown one day.

996
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:22,400
Uh, Claire, you can take
the rest of the evening off.

997
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:24,500
Colin, would you
care to join us?

998
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:26,400
No, I think
I'll make my way home.

999
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:27,867
As you wish.

1000
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,066
Say goodnight, children.

1001
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,233
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1002
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:32,567
Goodnight.

1003
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:33,700
Night.

1004
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,333
Well, it seems
we both unexpectedly

1005
00:51:39,467 --> 00:51:40,533
have the evening off.

1006
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,843
If you're interested,
I could give you

1007
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:46,333
a guided tour of
the palace gardens.

1008
00:51:46,467 --> 00:51:48,433
The Christmas displays.

1009
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:49,834
Christmas light displays.

1010
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:52,500
Quite spectacular
this time of year.

1011
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:53,953
Yes, no, I'd like that,
thank you.

1012
00:51:54,066 --> 00:51:55,066
Oh, good.

1013
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,767
I grew up here, you know?

1014
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:02,967
It still feels like home.

1015
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:08,767
It's difficult for me
to feel at home anywhere.

1016
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,800
The curse of being an orphan.

1017
00:52:11,934 --> 00:52:13,854
You're never really sure
you're on solid footing,

1018
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,533
no matter where you stand.

1019
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:17,700
You were never adopted?

1020
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:18,967
No.

1021
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,500
I'm sorry.
That must have been difficult.

1022
00:52:21,633 --> 00:52:23,333
No, it's alright.

1023
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:26,800
I didn't grow up
in a Dickens novel.

1024
00:52:26,934 --> 00:52:29,533
Everything turned out
alright in the end.

1025
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:34,834
Seems to me as though my sister
is rapidly coming to treat you

1026
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:36,967
as if you're part of the family.

1027
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,100
The children as well.

1028
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:42,133
You know, I owe you an apology.

1029
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:45,367
Um, regrettably our introduction

1030
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,333
was not my finest hour.

1031
00:52:48,467 --> 00:52:50,834
My actions were childish,

1032
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,700
and you, quite rightfully,

1033
00:52:52,834 --> 00:52:53,700
put me in my place.

1034
00:52:53,834 --> 00:52:54,834
Apology accepted.

1035
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,166
I admit, you did look absolutely
ridiculous covered in spaghetti

1036
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,667
and I loved it.

1037
00:53:05,633 --> 00:53:08,533
You're really good
with the children.

1038
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:09,967
They look up to you.

1039
00:53:12,467 --> 00:53:16,400
Have you given any thought to
starting a family of your own?

1040
00:53:16,533 --> 00:53:19,700
I'd like to think
my heart is open to it.

1041
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:24,200
Although, I do have
trouble trusting anyone

1042
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:26,166
from outside of the family.

1043
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,333
You and I, I think,

1044
00:53:30,467 --> 00:53:33,767
are like two sides
of the same coin.

1045
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,200
Growing up without a family,

1046
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:40,493
I find it difficult to trust
someone other than myself.

1047
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Well, perhaps we might both be

1048
00:53:46,133 --> 00:53:49,300
brave enough to take a chance
on trusting each other.

1049
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:52,567
Perhaps.

1050
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,834
Sir.

1051
00:53:58,967 --> 00:54:00,567
I need you to come
with me immediately.

1052
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,834
Why? What's happened?

1053
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:05,934
DG Taylor of MI7 has
requested a face to face

1054
00:54:06,066 --> 00:54:07,834
to brief you on
a security matter.

1055
00:54:07,967 --> 00:54:09,200
Uh, but...

1056
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,667
Right now?

1057
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,834
Yes, sir.

1058
00:54:15,533 --> 00:54:16,533
Price.

1059
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,900
Does it have to be right now?

1060
00:54:21,033 --> 00:54:22,100
Yes, sir.

1061
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,500
Claire, I'm sorry.

1062
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:29,767
Apparently, I need to
cut our outing short.

1063
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,266
I completely understand.

1064
00:54:33,066 --> 00:54:34,567
Goodnight.

1065
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:40,033
Goodnight.

1066
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:51,166
Has there been any
development in the case?

1067
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,633
I don't have any more
information than you do.

1068
00:54:54,767 --> 00:54:57,667
Your Highness,
thank you again for coming in.

1069
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,600
Amanda Young.

1070
00:54:59,734 --> 00:55:02,367
She volunteers for our charity.

1071
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,667
We believe she poses
an immediate threat

1072
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,200
to Princess Rose
and the children.

1073
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:07,567
Possibly even yourself.

1074
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,166
I've received countless
security threats over the years.

1075
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,567
Young has a military background
and was in possession

1076
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,834
of the security protocols
for Kensington.

1077
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,487
Only someone within the trusted
inner circle of the Royal Family

1078
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:20,967
could obtain this information
and she's been surveilling

1079
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,066
your sister and the children
for quite some time.

1080
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:28,166
This isn't a security briefing,
it's an interrogation.

1081
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,166
It looks that way.

1082
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,943
But only after they've
been thoroughly vetted.

1083
00:55:31,967 --> 00:55:33,767
The vetting process
only works if they've been

1084
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:36,166
convicted of a crime,
not if they're planning one.

1085
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,567
What more can you tell us?

1086
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,066
She was a hard worker.

1087
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,734
She only joined
our efforts this year.

1088
00:55:41,867 --> 00:55:43,967
I honestly don't know
anything else about this woman.

1089
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,900
Perhaps you could take a step
back from the charity this year.

1090
00:55:47,033 --> 00:55:48,867
Postpone the involvement
of the children.

1091
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,066
The charity does not function
without my involvement.

1092
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,633
Stepping back is not an option.

1093
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,533
I will, however, yield to Rose

1094
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:57,900
in all matters
concerning the children.

1095
00:55:58,033 --> 00:55:59,633
Now, gentlemen.

1096
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,900
My sincere hope is that you are
both very good at your jobs

1097
00:56:04,033 --> 00:56:05,242
and this will be
the last time we ever need

1098
00:56:05,266 --> 00:56:06,800
to speak on this matter.

1099
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:07,934
Your Highness.

1100
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,900
I just don't believe Colin
is capable of doing anything

1101
00:56:15,033 --> 00:56:17,233
to put his family in danger.

1102
00:56:17,367 --> 00:56:19,233
Don't fall prey to
the royal's charms.

1103
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:21,800
I need you to remain
professionally dispassionate

1104
00:56:21,934 --> 00:56:24,433
on this assignment.
You must be willing to go

1105
00:56:24,567 --> 00:56:25,967
where the evidence leads you.

1106
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,100
Yes, sir.

1107
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:31,076
Can we use Ford's
mobile device to map his route

1108
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,700
to the charity drop?
Maybe catch him on CCTV?

1109
00:56:33,834 --> 00:56:35,734
It'll take some time, but yes.

1110
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,376
What exactly are we looking for?

1111
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,409
I want to find out where that

1112
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:40,834
package he was
carrying came from.

1113
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:44,509
Perhaps it would be best
if you and the children kept

1114
00:56:44,533 --> 00:56:47,200
a low profile until
the threat is contained.

1115
00:56:47,333 --> 00:56:48,934
Cancel the Christmas party.

1116
00:56:49,066 --> 00:56:52,400
Nonsense. I won't hear of it.

1117
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:55,533
I want my children to have
a somewhat normal existence,

1118
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:58,834
and I refuse to allow
our lives to be guided by fear.

1119
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:02,693
Price, what's your
professional opinion?

1120
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,533
I assure you, sir,
that with the heightened

1121
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:09,166
security protocols,
the palace is the most secure

1122
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,660
place in the country
at this point.

1123
00:57:10,767 --> 00:57:12,867
Good. Hear that? Good.

1124
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:15,747
I'll consider
the matter settled.

1125
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:40,633
Are you trying to
collect them all?

1126
00:57:40,767 --> 00:57:42,633
I want to sample
one of everything

1127
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:44,533
to see what I like best.

1128
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:47,967
Thank you.

1129
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,667
Ooh. Yum.

1130
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:55,333
Psst!

1131
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Hey, look.

1132
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:01,100
Come here.

1133
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:04,667
What are you doing out here?

1134
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,834
To be honest,
this is my least favorite part

1135
00:58:07,967 --> 00:58:11,100
of the charity business.
Being in the spotlight.

1136
00:58:11,233 --> 00:58:13,934
I would much rather spend
the evening with all of you.

1137
00:58:14,066 --> 00:58:16,400
Well, perhaps we could
all go down together.

1138
00:58:16,533 --> 00:58:18,700
No, no. Save yourselves.

1139
00:58:18,834 --> 00:58:21,500
My fate is inevitable.

1140
00:58:21,633 --> 00:58:26,333
I just wanted to say hello
before the evening got started.

1141
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:28,367
Hello.

1142
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
What's all this?

1143
00:58:31,233 --> 00:58:32,600
This is your party, Colin.

1144
00:58:32,734 --> 00:58:34,400
You need to actually attend.

1145
00:58:34,533 --> 00:58:35,834
On one condition.

1146
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:38,533
I would like Claire
to attend as well.

1147
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:40,033
As my guest.

1148
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,800
Lovely.

1149
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:45,767
I'm all for it.

1150
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,400
That is very nice,

1151
00:58:49,533 --> 00:58:50,700
but what about the children?

1152
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:52,900
I'll call on the night
nanny a little early.

1153
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,700
Okay.

1154
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:57,233
I'm happy to lend you
a gown if you need it.

1155
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,600
Thank you, but I think I might

1156
00:59:00,734 --> 00:59:02,900
have something for
just such an occasion.

1157
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:05,734
Splendid.

1158
00:59:05,867 --> 00:59:07,967
You know, I must confess,

1159
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,567
all our lives do seem to be
a bit brighter with you in it.

1160
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,867
I'm grateful.

1161
00:59:15,934 --> 00:59:17,200
Alright, let's go.

1162
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,000
Chin up. Off we pop.

1163
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:47,033
Thank you.

1164
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:52,300
Your Highness, good evening.

1165
00:59:52,433 --> 00:59:53,993
- Your Highness.
- Thank you for coming.

1166
00:59:55,033 --> 00:59:56,800
How have you been, Madame?
Thank you.

1167
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,333
- Ah, excuse me.
- Yes, Your Highness.

1168
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:39,166
You look stunning as always.

1169
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,700
You've hardly seen me
in anything but my uniform.

1170
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:44,166
I stand by my statement.

1171
01:00:56,967 --> 01:00:58,734
Hello, thank you for coming.

1172
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:00,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

1173
01:01:00,433 --> 01:01:01,934
Good to see you. This is Claire.

1174
01:01:02,066 --> 01:01:03,867
- Hello.
- Lovely to meet you.

1175
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,600
Thank you so much
for being here.

1176
01:01:05,734 --> 01:01:07,300
Hello.

1177
01:01:07,433 --> 01:01:08,810
- Lovely, good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1178
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:10,600
May I have a word?

1179
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:11,900
Go, go. Please. Yes.

1180
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:13,266
- Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

1181
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,142
No, no. I'm quite interested.
I think it's a very...

1182
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:17,433
I thought I might
find you here tonight.

1183
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:21,233
You seem to be getting on better
than I could have expected.

1184
01:01:21,367 --> 01:01:22,700
Being with the children has...

1185
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:27,633
brought out something in me
I didn't even know was there.

1186
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,967
You see, I was the older kid.

1187
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,242
Always looking after
and protecting the younger

1188
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:34,900
children at the children's home.

1189
01:01:35,033 --> 01:01:37,867
Perhaps that's why I went into
the line of work that I did.

1190
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,266
You may be lying
about what you do,

1191
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,033
but you're not lying
about who you are.

1192
01:01:44,166 --> 01:01:46,567
Thank you.

1193
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,633
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Lansbury.

1194
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:51,300
Merry Christmas, dear boy.

1195
01:01:51,433 --> 01:01:52,867
I need to thank you.

1196
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,800
You have sent us
a true gift in Claire.

1197
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:59,233
She has exceeded even
my greatest expectations

1198
01:01:59,367 --> 01:02:01,433
for her service.

1199
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:03,600
As always,
it's a pleasure to see you.

1200
01:02:03,734 --> 01:02:05,200
Now, if you don't
mind excusing us,

1201
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:07,700
there's something
I need to show Claire.

1202
01:02:07,834 --> 01:02:09,467
By all means.

1203
01:02:14,967 --> 01:02:16,266
Where are you taking me?

1204
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,600
It's a surprise.

1205
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:32,834
I've never been
in this room before.

1206
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:36,467
This is where I keep some of
the presents so Robert and Elle

1207
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,467
don't find them
before Christmas morning.

1208
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:41,767
It's so beautiful.

1209
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:45,800
Every year I try to
create a different display,

1210
01:02:45,934 --> 01:02:50,467
and then I give Robert and Elle
a Christmas tree ornament.

1211
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,266
On Christmas Eve,
we all gather together

1212
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,467
in the living room
and put up all the decorations

1213
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,133
they've collected
over the years.

1214
01:02:57,266 --> 01:02:58,934
I've been doing it
since they were born.

1215
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,367
So, I suppose it's
a family tradition now.

1216
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,567
It's very thoughtful.

1217
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:04,567
It's nothing much.

1218
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,333
Just special memories from me.

1219
01:03:08,467 --> 01:03:12,266
No, those are the things
that matter the most.

1220
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,867
From the heart.
They're timeless and priceless.

1221
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:18,667
That's the idea.

1222
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:22,767
Rose would like the children
to have a humble upbringing.

1223
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,266
So, I, well, I try to
encourage them to appreciate

1224
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,533
the simple things in life,

1225
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:32,934
and just to be grateful
for having each other.

1226
01:03:33,066 --> 01:03:37,867
The love of a family
is very special indeed.

1227
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:40,533
They're blessed to have you.

1228
01:03:41,867 --> 01:03:43,700
Thank you for saying that.

1229
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:46,633
But truly I am the lucky one.

1230
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,533
We should, um...

1231
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:57,500
Should we what?

1232
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,867
Go, um...

1233
01:04:01,734 --> 01:04:03,100
- to the ball.
- The ball.

1234
01:04:03,233 --> 01:04:04,443
Right, we should
go back to the ball.

1235
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:06,166
- Back to the ball, then.
- Right.

1236
01:04:16,133 --> 01:04:18,767
We used the recovered phone to
reverse engineer the courier's

1237
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,567
route to the charity kiosk.

1238
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,133
The package
containing the microdot

1239
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:30,467
originated from Colin?

1240
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,000
We can't assume Colin
passed along security info.

1241
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:34,400
He would have access to it.

1242
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:35,800
What does Ford have to say?

1243
01:04:35,934 --> 01:04:37,900
He's still not talking.

1244
01:04:38,033 --> 01:04:39,266
No, Colin is not the bad guy.

1245
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,000
How can you be certain?

1246
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:42,734
'Cause I've spent time with him,

1247
01:04:42,867 --> 01:04:44,600
and believe me,
I have spent time with

1248
01:04:44,734 --> 01:04:46,576
some pretty unsavory
characters in this line of work,

1249
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,934
and Colin stands above them all.

1250
01:04:49,066 --> 01:04:50,176
Would you trust him
with your life?

1251
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,667
I would, yes.

1252
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,133
That would be a mistake.

1253
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:56,176
I warned you against falling
prey to the royal's charms.

1254
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:59,266
Sir, if you feel my integrity

1255
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,500
has been compromised,

1256
01:05:01,633 --> 01:05:03,800
perhaps you should
remove me from this case.

1257
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:05,567
The only way
through this is forward.

1258
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,580
You're still the best
asset we have in the game.

1259
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:10,967
You've managed to get close
to a family no outsider

1260
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,467
should be able to get close to.

1261
01:05:31,467 --> 01:05:32,900
I grew up here.

1262
01:05:33,033 --> 01:05:34,333
In this exact home?

1263
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,600
Yeah.

1264
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:42,533
Once I left I never
thought I'd be back.

1265
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:46,400
It's sort of like being visited
by the Ghost of Christmas Past.

1266
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:50,166
Oh. Well, that's all good,

1267
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:54,467
because I am
the Ghost of Christmas Presents.

1268
01:05:57,834 --> 01:05:59,767
Uh. Yeah. Okay.

1269
01:06:02,266 --> 01:06:03,266
Thank you.

1270
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,400
Alright, yes. Thank you.

1271
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:10,467
Yes, this one is for you.

1272
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,100
You're welcome. Well?

1273
01:06:13,233 --> 01:06:16,467
That's very good.

1274
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,600
One more.

1275
01:06:18,734 --> 01:06:20,100
Good.

1276
01:06:20,233 --> 01:06:21,467
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.

1277
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,266
Alright, now.

1278
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,400
Why don't we all open our gifts
together on the count of three?

1279
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:30,700
Ready? One, two, three.

1280
01:06:30,834 --> 01:06:32,734
Happy Christmas!

1281
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:04,133
Fallout!

1282
01:07:10,834 --> 01:07:13,433
Claire Champion,
Hand over the children

1283
01:07:13,567 --> 01:07:15,433
and I'll leave
the Prince unharmed.

1284
01:07:15,567 --> 01:07:18,333
Claire! Don't you dare!

1285
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:20,467
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1286
01:07:24,133 --> 01:07:26,033
Are you hurt? Are you injured?

1287
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,100
Okay. We're going to go home.

1288
01:07:29,233 --> 01:07:31,533
I know, I know, I know.

1289
01:07:42,967 --> 01:07:44,333
Your Royal Highness.

1290
01:07:44,467 --> 01:07:45,800
I feel it best to explain.

1291
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:52,667
My name is Claire Champion,
not Carter.

1292
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,200
I'm with Security Service.

1293
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:58,700
We uncovered a credible threat
against you and the children

1294
01:07:58,834 --> 01:08:01,734
and deemed it best
to place me here

1295
01:08:01,867 --> 01:08:04,734
undercover as an added
layer of protection

1296
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:06,500
for just such an occasion.

1297
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:10,834
Thank you for
protecting my children.

1298
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:15,066
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but, um...

1299
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,333
but they took Colin.

1300
01:08:21,633 --> 01:08:24,100
What can be done to
bring him home safely?

1301
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:25,667
- Well, I...
- Officer Champion.

1302
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,667
You are relieved
of your assignment.

1303
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,066
I'll take it from here.

1304
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,400
Sir, if... if it's alright,
I'd like to stay here

1305
01:08:32,533 --> 01:08:33,400
and see this through to the end.

1306
01:08:33,533 --> 01:08:35,166
You're relieved
of the assignment.

1307
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,166
That's an order.

1308
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,567
I'm sorry. Who exactly are you?

1309
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,600
DG Taylor, MI...

1310
01:08:40,734 --> 01:08:44,800
My first priority at this moment
is tending to my children.

1311
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:48,800
The only person in this room
I trust right now is Claire.

1312
01:08:48,934 --> 01:08:50,409
Everyone else needs
to leave immediately.

1313
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:52,300
But we need to
brief you on the situation.

1314
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:53,734
Officer Champion
will brief me on

1315
01:08:53,867 --> 01:08:55,934
anything I need
to be briefed on.

1316
01:08:56,066 --> 01:08:57,066
Is that understood?

1317
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:01,667
Yes, ma'am.

1318
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,867
Ma'am, I promise you,

1319
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,400
I will do everything in my power
to bring Colin home safely.

1320
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,734
I know you will.

1321
01:09:20,433 --> 01:09:22,233
I owe you one.

1322
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,033
It's what we trained for.

1323
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:25,633
The day we hope never comes.

1324
01:09:25,767 --> 01:09:28,367
Something just doesn't fit,
does it?

1325
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,800
I don't follow.

1326
01:09:29,934 --> 01:09:33,066
Young knew who I was.

1327
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,667
She recognized you
from the market?

1328
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,400
No, no.
She called me by my real name.

1329
01:09:37,533 --> 01:09:38,900
Not my alias.

1330
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:42,734
Only someone inside Thames House
could have given it to her.

1331
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:43,867
Exactly.

1332
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:50,066
Officer Price is missing
after the exchange.

1333
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,667
Seems he was taken as well.

1334
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:55,314
Vance needs us to
come in immediately.

1335
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
We traced Prince Colin's
secure phone.

1336
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,734
It led us right back here.

1337
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:07,643
Where this package was
delivered addressed to you.

1338
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:09,667
It's been cleared.
It's safe to open.

1339
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,734
Prince Colin's
secure phone is inside.

1340
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,033
Officer Champion.

1341
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:29,667
Hello, Officer Champion.

1342
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,667
The children are safe.

1343
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,767
I thank you for that.

1344
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:39,066
These not-so-lovely people
have a list of demands

1345
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,300
for my safe return.

1346
01:10:41,433 --> 01:10:44,066
I would tell them to bugger off.

1347
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,333
You'll find the list
in a file on my phone.

1348
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,367
I'm coming to
get you out of this.

1349
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,834
I promise.

1350
01:10:51,967 --> 01:10:53,333
Thank you, Claire.

1351
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,867
They want
the courier Ford released.

1352
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,300
Along with a drive
containing 50 million crypto.

1353
01:11:05,433 --> 01:11:07,009
I'll telephone the PM.
See how he wants to proceed.

1354
01:11:07,033 --> 01:11:09,900
Shouldn't this be
up to the family?

1355
01:11:10,033 --> 01:11:11,900
The family has no say
in this whatsoever.

1356
01:11:12,033 --> 01:11:13,533
This is a matter of state now.

1357
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,467
I don't like how
Taylor is handling this.

1358
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,934
There's something
about it that doesn't fit.

1359
01:11:25,066 --> 01:11:27,176
You don't get to be
the head of the Security Service

1360
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,033
by winning a popularity contest.

1361
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:32,467
Hm, we caught a red flag
on Olivia Morgan's

1362
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,967
financial records.

1363
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,633
Maybe connected, maybe not.

1364
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:39,300
I knew there was something
about her I didn't trust.

1365
01:11:39,433 --> 01:11:43,033
Let's bring her in.
See what she knows.

1366
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,700
Ms. Morgan, it's come to
my attention you had some

1367
01:11:54,834 --> 01:11:58,266
financial difficulties
that were recently resolved

1368
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,700
by a series of
large cash transfers.

1369
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:03,633
Financial issues make someone

1370
01:12:03,767 --> 01:12:04,867
a prime target for coercion

1371
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,867
from malevolent outside forces.

1372
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,600
Are you saying you think I'm
involved with Colin's abduction?

1373
01:12:09,734 --> 01:12:12,934
You had access to
all the security protocols.

1374
01:12:13,066 --> 01:12:14,967
You had access to
my itinerary that day of.

1375
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:18,033
The funds came from The Mirror.

1376
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,166
The tabloid?

1377
01:12:21,266 --> 01:12:23,867
I was selling them gossip
about the royal family.

1378
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:27,133
I'm not a kidnapper.

1379
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,000
They were particularly
interested in

1380
01:12:32,133 --> 01:12:33,700
a budding relationship

1381
01:12:33,834 --> 01:12:36,000
between Prince Colin
and the royal nanny.

1382
01:12:36,133 --> 01:12:38,667
My role at the palace
is classified.

1383
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,300
Any information
you divulge going forward

1384
01:12:43,433 --> 01:12:45,266
will be considered
an act of treason

1385
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,300
punishable by
10 years in prison.

1386
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:55,133
What's this?

1387
01:12:55,266 --> 01:12:58,767
A letter of termination
from Princess Rose.

1388
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,934
Effective immediately.

1389
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,400
The PM has ordered
a national emergency

1390
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:09,166
and convened COBR.
As of this moment,

1391
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:10,600
we've been ordered
to stand down.

1392
01:13:10,734 --> 01:13:13,533
Sir, the PM is
making a grave mistake.

1393
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:16,066
It's his mistake to make.

1394
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,040
By the time the experts
and the crisis planners

1395
01:13:18,066 --> 01:13:19,586
and the politicians
all get up to speed

1396
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,433
it will be too late!

1397
01:13:21,567 --> 01:13:24,533
Young has been one step
ahead of us this entire time.

1398
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:26,734
It's as if someone
in Thames House is

1399
01:13:26,867 --> 01:13:28,433
behind this entire operation.

1400
01:13:28,567 --> 01:13:30,900
Your feelings for
the Prince are blinding you.

1401
01:13:31,033 --> 01:13:32,643
The evidence is plausible
enough to point to him

1402
01:13:32,667 --> 01:13:34,767
as the mastermind
behind this entire endeavor.

1403
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,567
By getting himself kidnapped.

1404
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,767
His plan to take
the children failed.

1405
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:39,900
He... improvised.

1406
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,333
This is personal for you.

1407
01:13:43,467 --> 01:13:45,100
You have something against him.

1408
01:13:45,233 --> 01:13:47,834
Against the family.
Against royals in general.

1409
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:49,009
You are out of line, Officer.

1410
01:13:49,033 --> 01:13:51,333
No, sir, I am in line,

1411
01:13:51,467 --> 01:13:54,700
because you keep trying to
take this piece of the puzzle

1412
01:13:54,834 --> 01:13:57,834
that simply doesn't fit,
and force it into something.

1413
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:00,400
You are suspended
from active duty.

1414
01:14:00,533 --> 01:14:01,967
Turn in your credentials,

1415
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,900
and pray that I don't
have you decommissioned.

1416
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:21,900
I've been suspended.

1417
01:14:23,734 --> 01:14:25,734
It's not the best
way to begin Christmas.

1418
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,834
When an investigation
hits a dead end,

1419
01:14:29,967 --> 01:14:31,407
you have to go back
to the beginning.

1420
01:14:33,367 --> 01:14:37,734
That dead end may not
be as dead as you think.

1421
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:44,066
Price is in on it.

1422
01:14:46,633 --> 01:14:50,266
Young and Ford served
with him in the SAS.

1423
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,367
I'm sorry.
How do you know all this?

1424
01:14:55,433 --> 01:14:59,900
I have eyes and ears everywhere.

1425
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,800
No.

1426
01:15:01,934 --> 01:15:03,233
We shouldn't give this to him.

1427
01:15:03,367 --> 01:15:05,867
There's not much
going on in this city

1428
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,300
that I don't know about.

1429
01:15:08,433 --> 01:15:10,567
My sources tell me

1430
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,700
Ford and Young were former MI7.

1431
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:14,834
How could we have missed that?

1432
01:15:14,967 --> 01:15:17,166
They were decommissioned
and their involvement

1433
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,967
in the Security Service
was wiped off the record.

1434
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,066
So, they became ghost agents
for off-book missions.

1435
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,734
Yes, rather like something

1436
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:27,533
right out of
A Christmas Carol, isn't it?

1437
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:30,467
But Taylor must be behind it.
Why?

1438
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,867
The word is that
the powers that be

1439
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,967
were cutting the MI7 funding.

1440
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,300
Even considering absorbing it

1441
01:15:39,433 --> 01:15:42,633
into a newly formed
joint security service.

1442
01:15:42,767 --> 01:15:44,700
Create a national crisis.

1443
01:15:44,834 --> 01:15:47,367
Save the day. It does prove
how essential you are.

1444
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,500
Precisely.

1445
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:53,834
Now, I'm counting on you to
bring my dear boy back home.

1446
01:15:53,967 --> 01:15:56,166
Your dear boy?

1447
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,400
I was Colin's nanny
back in the day.

1448
01:15:58,533 --> 01:16:02,433
Who do you think gave me
the nickname Scary Poppins?

1449
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:06,767
He's no longer a child,

1450
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:11,400
but one never stops looking out
for the people one cares for.

1451
01:16:38,433 --> 01:16:40,200
This had better be good.

1452
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:42,100
Colin's security
detail, Officer Price,

1453
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:45,066
he's not missing, he's in on it.

1454
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,066
And if my sources are correct,
Colin is inside.

1455
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,734
I'd say that's pretty good.

1456
01:16:49,867 --> 01:16:52,700
Well, they're preparing to
release Ford with the ransom so.

1457
01:16:52,834 --> 01:16:53,900
Then we'd better be quick.

1458
01:17:11,066 --> 01:17:12,834
Colin. It has to be.

1459
01:17:12,967 --> 01:17:14,266
I'd bet my life on it.

1460
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:16,834
What's the plan?

1461
01:17:16,967 --> 01:17:19,200
Are we just going to
go down the chimney?

1462
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:20,333
Like Santa Clause?

1463
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:51,734
We have to be smart about this,

1464
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:53,800
and do it my way.
Wait a minute.

1465
01:17:53,934 --> 01:17:55,200
No.

1466
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:56,733
Nothing like
Christmas Eve takeaway.

1467
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,033
Wonderful. I'm hungry.

1468
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:02,934
Thank you.

1469
01:18:03,066 --> 01:18:04,066
I'm in.

1470
01:18:07,734 --> 01:18:09,133
There's somebody
coming your way.

1471
01:18:16,567 --> 01:18:17,700
Claire: Psst.

1472
01:18:44,934 --> 01:18:46,934
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

1473
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,767
Do you trust me?

1474
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,576
Was everything you
told me about yourself true

1475
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,166
or was it all a cover story?

1476
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:57,166
No, I only lied to
you about what I do.

1477
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,800
Not who I am.

1478
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,567
I trust you.

1479
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:04,133
Stay behind me.

1480
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,200
Where is he?

1481
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,667
What? Where is he?!

1482
01:19:12,133 --> 01:19:14,300
Come on.
He can't be gone.

1483
01:19:27,066 --> 01:19:29,233
Whoa!

1484
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:36,834
A Lansbury nanny
always plans for rain.

1485
01:19:38,467 --> 01:19:40,867
All good, boys.
I've got it.

1486
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,867
You are quite amazing.

1487
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,600
Mrs. Lansbury would be proud.

1488
01:19:56,633 --> 01:19:57,867
What's the meaning of this?

1489
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:58,867
It's over, sir.

1490
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,009
We know you were behind it all,

1491
01:20:00,033 --> 01:20:02,500
attempting to
frame Prince Colin.

1492
01:20:02,633 --> 01:20:03,710
It might have worked
had Officer Champion

1493
01:20:03,734 --> 01:20:04,900
not protected the children.

1494
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:08,166
Everything I did was for
the good of this service.

1495
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:10,533
I had to prove
that we are essential

1496
01:20:10,667 --> 01:20:13,066
to the safety of this country.
It was the only way.

1497
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,360
That may be what you believe,

1498
01:20:14,467 --> 01:20:17,300
but you can never do right
by doing wrong.

1499
01:20:21,333 --> 01:20:22,667
You'll see.

1500
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,367
It's the job. It changes you.

1501
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,533
I think it just makes you
more of who you are.

1502
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:45,500
Uncle Colin.

1503
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:47,066
I miss him, too.

1504
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,066
No!

1505
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,033
Uncle Colin!

1506
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:52,333
- Colin!
- Colin!

1507
01:20:52,467 --> 01:20:54,734
Hi! Oh, it's so good to see you.

1508
01:20:54,867 --> 01:20:56,433
Oh. Oh, you're crushing me.

1509
01:20:57,867 --> 01:21:00,133
Thank you for bringing him home.

1510
01:21:00,266 --> 01:21:02,767
It's my pleasure.

1511
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:05,633
And you know,
we actually brought home

1512
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:09,100
a straggler from the North Pole.

1513
01:21:09,233 --> 01:21:13,033
Ho, ho, ho.
Happy Christmas, one and all.

1514
01:21:14,767 --> 01:21:16,066
Father! You're here!

1515
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,133
How did you pull this off?

1516
01:21:22,266 --> 01:21:26,100
Your abduction triggered
military safety protocol.

1517
01:21:26,233 --> 01:21:28,767
So, Edward was relieved of
active duty immediately.

1518
01:21:33,133 --> 01:21:34,867
It's our Christmas
wish come true!

1519
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,567
What did you wish for
by the fountain?

1520
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,700
Um...

1521
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,567
To spend Christmas here
with you and your family.

1522
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,433
Hello?

1523
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:57,266
Yes, of course.

1524
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,433
She's right here.

1525
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,367
Just a moment.

1526
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,133
It's for you.

1527
01:22:04,266 --> 01:22:05,266
Thank you.

1528
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:08,834
Claire Champion.

1529
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,133
Yes, Your Majesty.

1530
01:22:19,133 --> 01:22:21,567
No, I'd... I'd love to.

1531
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:25,467
No, absolutely.

1532
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,600
Thank you.

1533
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:36,200
The king just invited me to
spend Christmas at Sandringham.

1534
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:40,133
Well, that's highly unusual.

1535
01:22:40,266 --> 01:22:43,734
Father's not usually one to
invite non-family members.

1536
01:22:43,867 --> 01:22:47,834
This is quite an unusual
break in royal protocol.

1537
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,233
Claire is family,

1538
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:53,133
and if my brother's
as smart as he thinks he is,

1539
01:22:53,266 --> 01:22:55,934
he'll make it official
sooner than later.

1540
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:00,643
Should we look at the presents?

1541
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:01,533
Yeah!

1542
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:02,667
Come on.

1543
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,066
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

1544
01:23:12,266 --> 01:23:14,033
I guess
Ms. Lansbury was right.

1545
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,000
Love does triumph over all.
