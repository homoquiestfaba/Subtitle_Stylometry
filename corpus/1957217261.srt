Let's try to find the unknown

915
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,875
using whatever information
we've been given.

916
01:26:22,083 --> 01:26:25,375
Philip, what information
do we have?

917
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:31,542
That Miss Groshardt
and Mrs...

918
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:35,083
Miss Lumpkin
are getting married.

919
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,833
What else?

920
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:44,917

921
01:26:45,917 --> 01:26:47,792
What is it that
we don't know?

01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:52,125
Why they're getting married.

923
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:54,583
And why they got fired.

924

This is what
we have to deduce.

Now just think logically.

926
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:03,833
Why do people get married?

927
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,417
Because they love each other.

928

Makes sense to me.

Why did these two
people lose their jobs?

930
01:27:17,208 --> 01:27:19,375
Because they set
a bad example for us.

931

Is love a bad example?

01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:28,958

romantic than a wedding?

Thanks for sticking up
for us at the meeting.

When you're gay, you hear
a lot about Leviticus.

937
01:27:45,917 --> 01:27:47,208
So we took The Bible
to bed with us

Don't worry, if you stay
together long enough,

941
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:55,542
straight people will
forget that you're gay

942
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:57,042
and you'll be respectable.

943
01:27:57,083 --> 01:27:59,083
You'll have to act gay
to remind them.
