1
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,596
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

2
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:43,868
<i>Fire. The whole house is on fire.</i>

3
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:48,022
<i>What's the address of the fire?</i>

4
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:53,428
<i>I can't hear you. 911.
What's the address of the fire?</i>

5
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:58,750
<i>Sir, what is the address?</i>

6
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,886
<i>Yours.</i>

7
00:01:56,248 --> 00:01:57,283
<i>Good morning, Atlanta.</i>

8
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,968
<i>There's a beautiful sunrise outside
if you're up at this early hour</i>

9
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:04,306
<i>lighting up the A skyline
across Midtown and Buckhead.</i>

10
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:06,592
<i>But what about the south of the city?</i>

11
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:10,784
<i>Yeah, that's right, today is
the big day, the result of our poll...</i>

12
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,950
Mommy.

13
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:27,905
It's okay, baby.

14
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:48,987
Cassie!

15
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:16,445
- You look funny!
- Well, you have my nose and lips,

16
00:03:16,545 --> 00:03:19,782
so I would probably think
of a better word to describe me.

17
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:22,952
- You shouldn't wear that.
- Why not?

18
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:26,021
That shirt with those shoes?
Uh-huh, girlfriend.

19
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,690
Oh, yeah? And where did you go
to fashion school, Missy?

20
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,486
Miss Summers' art class.

21
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:34,563
Well, I'm not taking fashion tips from
a 10-year old. Now, go grab your bag.

22
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:37,158
It's the new twelve.

23
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:09,464
- Where did you find that?
- In the garbage.

24
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:11,334
Well, it's not yours.

25
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:14,302
Daddy gave it to you.

26
00:04:14,402 --> 00:04:17,356
Cassie, that was a long time ago, okay?
We're not kids anymore.

27
00:04:17,506 --> 00:04:18,807
So?

28
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:22,377
So, don't argue with me.
Come on, I'm late.

29
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:24,897
Okay, but I still need $50.

30
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,950
- For what?
- Our career-day field trip.

31
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,211
What? That's today?

32
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:34,616
Daddy!

33
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,585
Wait! Cassie, I...

34
00:04:38,994 --> 00:04:40,855
Shit.

35
00:04:45,434 --> 00:04:46,902
There's my little lady.

36
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:49,204
- Daddy!
- Get over here. Come on.

37
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:50,773
- How you been?
- Good.

38
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,374
- You got a new outfit?
- Yeah.

39
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:53,942
- Pretty. Look at you.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,962
I think waiting a week
to see you is too much.

41
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:58,657
Morning, Pam.

42
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:02,318
- Hey, Howard.
- Morning, Pammie.

43
00:05:04,286 --> 00:05:06,522
Oh, Dad, can you help me
with my homework?

44
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:08,140
You know I can.

45
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,261
- You were supposed to finish that yourself!
- Oh, come on, Pam!

46
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:14,696
Hey, want to go see uncle Howard?

47
00:05:14,796 --> 00:05:17,325
- Yeah.
- Go on, I'll be right there.

48
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,930
- Hey, Pam.
- What is it, Jeremy?

49
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:25,507
I was just gonna say you look
beautiful today, that's all.

50
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:28,269
I'm in a rush. What do you want?

51
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,748
The car is in both of our names.
It's affecting the credit, that's all.

52
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:35,251
- I'll take care of it.
- I didn't mean it like that, okay?

53
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,447
- If you need help, I can...
- We're not married.

54
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,561
- We're not divorced either.
- Not yet.

55
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:48,696
I think I've said "Sorry" enough,
don't you?

56
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:52,360
- You left our daughter alone in the house.
- I know.

57
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:55,938
And for what? So you could take a call?

58
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:58,983
Hey, Pam, it's been a year, okay?

59
00:05:59,741 --> 00:06:02,103
When are you gonna let it go?

60
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:21,479
I look forward to seeing you
and Cassie, you know that.

61
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:26,461
How many times I got to say I'm sorry
if you just stop being crazy-mad at me?

62
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:33,001
I don't know. How many whiskey sours
does it take to forget?

63
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:36,811
Nice, Pam.

64
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:40,675
You, know, I've been sober
for five months. I'm trying, okay?

65
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:57,766
We have a couple of issues to discuss, so
let's go ahead and get them out of the way.

66
00:06:57,866 --> 00:07:00,402
First, we need to keep
our workplace clean.

67
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:04,139
Second shift has been complaining
about trash left on our workstations.

68
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:07,943
- Some of that shit is from third shift.
- Well, be that as it may...

69
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:10,445
Pamela, nice of you to join us.

70
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:13,311
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly,

71
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:16,384
the state is making major cuts
to our staff and benefits,

72
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:20,455
so I'll be taking over for Richard
for a bit while he is out with the flu.

73
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:22,991
He'll post the details next week
when he gets back.

74
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:24,910
So, who got axed?

75
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,629
I'm not privileged
to release that information.

76
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,915
Don't worry, sweetie,
you've only been here two years.

77
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:31,320
Three.

78
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,761
They're firing employees
with longer tenure and more benefits

79
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,638
for those newer, cheaper workers.

80
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:38,874
I don't make any decisions.
That's Richard's call.

81
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:41,877
He and upper management in both
the state police and fire departments

82
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:44,146
are taking a 40% cut
of their retirement benefits,

83
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:46,645
so it's not just us who are affected.

84
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:50,578
Let's just focus on the task at hand
and get to our workstations.

85
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:56,117
Pamela, could I see you
for a moment, please?

86
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:01,989
Have a seat.

87
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,963
Seven years and a perfect record.

88
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:13,567
Do you feel an itch?

89
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,505
How much sleep did you get
last night, Pamela?

90
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,149
- Enough, why?
- You were late.

91
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:24,845
Second time this week
and fourth time this month.

92
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:27,281
Five minutes.

93
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,684
It was ten actually.

94
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:33,788
I requested to review
your psych evaluation.

95
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,232
Do you still dream about the fire?

96
00:08:37,632 --> 00:08:39,460
No.

97
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:44,573
But you still claim that the caller
burned your house down.

98
00:08:44,873 --> 00:08:49,002
- I listened to the tapes.
- So did I.

99
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:53,615
And you insist that the caller,
when asked for his address...

100
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:55,901
said "Yours."

101
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:59,054
No, he said 110 Hamilton Drive.

102
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:01,890
It was just the way he said it.

103
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,042
Like he knew it was my house.

104
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:07,495
It's only when I dream
I hear him say "Yours".

105
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,965
So you're still having a dream.

106
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:12,526
No, I'm fine.

107
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:25,239
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, baby. Be good.

108
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:37,726
- Hey, brother.
- For fuck sake, coffee and doughnuts!

109
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:40,896
Come on, try it. Green tea is good
for you. Spinach and Chicken Ram.

110
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:43,498
- Nobody eats this crap.
- In 2015 they do.

111
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:45,960
It's the last time you go for food.

112
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:50,824
So, we're having a padlock
on Tuesday if you're interested.

113
00:09:52,774 --> 00:09:55,711
I should have done this
a lot sooner, actually.

114
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,462
Done what?

115
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:59,781
No liquids by the workstations.

116
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,977
Moved you to an easier district.

117
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:05,987
Grace, Pamela's gonna be starting today
on the Eastern District.

118
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,376
- Excuse me?
- You'll also cover suburbs and highways...

119
00:10:08,476 --> 00:10:11,763
- Tony! Tony!
- And lot of tress and grass...

120
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:15,597
Tony! I've worked this station
for nearly 20 years.

121
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,565
Grace, it's just a few days.

122
00:10:17,665 --> 00:10:20,903
You'll take the Northwestern District
then you can give Pam a lunch at noon.

123
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:25,306
- I can handle the inner city calls, really.
- No, have a seat, sweetie.

124
00:10:25,406 --> 00:10:29,037
- Really, let her have this workstation.
- Don't mind her.

125
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,727
I know you're probably looking
for a raise or promotion, or...

126
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:36,618
both, but... we're really under
a lot of heat right now,

127
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:41,689
so, why don't we wait until this smoke clears
a little bit and then we can re-evaluate.

128
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:44,018
You're a good operator, Pam.

129
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:54,902
- What's the occasion?
- Occasion?

130
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,339
- In that outfit?
- What's wrong with my outfit?

131
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,007
That white, those shoes?

132
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,610
- Who are you trying to impress?
- My paycheck.

133
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,380
- Yeah, with all the cuts they're making?
- Well, you got to at least try, right?

134
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,649
Make some initiative.

135
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:10,277
I've read that somewhere.

136
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,455
911. What is your emergency?

137
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:19,620
911. What's your emergency?

138
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:39,981
I haven't gotten a call in over an hour.

139
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:43,878
- Why is it always so slow around lunch?
- Criminals eat, right?

140
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:49,791
Break time, baby girl.

141
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:52,034
I've been on break all day.

142
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:56,690
Don't let Tony catch you with that.

143
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:01,303
- It's all yours.
- I forgot my mirror. Two minutes?

144
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:02,536
Follow me, children.

145
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:06,274
Over here we have one of the city's
most prominent monuments

146
00:12:06,374 --> 00:12:09,737
established in the late 1890's
around the same time

147
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:12,630
that the city itself was built...

148
00:12:27,678 --> 00:12:31,475
<i>We're good to go and ready
in about ten minutes.</i>

149
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:44,179
911. What is your emergency?

150
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,183
<i>Such a lovely voice.
Such a calming tone.</i>

151
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:52,320
I'll bet you don't get told that
very much when people are calling in.

152
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,346
No doubt they are too scared
out their minds to notice.

153
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:59,494
- Thank you.
- <i>My pleasure.</i>

154
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:01,229
<i>So, how does this work?</i>

155
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,734
I tell you the crime and the location,
and you send assistance to said location?

156
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:10,472
If I deem is necessary, yes, sir.
What is your emergency?

157
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:13,374
<i>No time to waste
when lives are at stake.</i>

158
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:16,011
You take your job
very seriously, don't you?

159
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:18,846
Sir, this is a line
for emergencies only.

160
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:22,550
If you need a help hotline
I'll be more than happy to transfer you.

161
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,120
<i>But I do have an emergency to report.</i>

162
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,185
<i>Suppose I were to tell you
that a serious accident</i>

163
00:13:29,285 --> 00:13:33,728
<i>on the corner of Fifth and Dawkins
is gonna occur in ten minutes</i>

164
00:13:33,828 --> 00:13:36,364
<i>and you can prevent it from happening.</i>

165
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:39,510
<i>Would I have your attention then?</i>

166
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:46,327
Oh, my goodness.

167
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:50,011
- Are we still on the clock?
- You think you have a shot with that?

168
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:52,180
What are you talking about?
She looked right at me.

169
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,518
- I know what that means. I still got it.
- It means you need new glasses.

170
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,685
She looked right at me.

171
00:13:57,785 --> 00:14:00,255
- What a butt like a ten-year old.
- Really?

172
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:03,191
You know, you should enjoy her
while you can at that age.

173
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:06,061
Because right now she thinks
you're the coolest dude on Earth.

174
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:09,523
- But by middle school it's all over.
- That early?

175
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:13,167
That early. My daughter started
to call me "pig" in sixth grade.

176
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,429
I wonder why.

177
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:20,805
Who I am and why I'm doing this
is none of your concern.

178
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:24,938
<i>What I am prepared to do is
what you should be concerned about.</i>

179
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:28,984
- Sir, if this is some kind of a prank...
- <i>Then hang up on me.</i>

180
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:30,985
<i>Oh, that's right!</i>

181
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:34,589
<i>An emergency dispatch operator
can't disconnect</i>

182
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:37,985
<i>once the caller has stated
"There's emergency".</i>

183
00:14:39,027 --> 00:14:43,298
No doubt, by now you've tried
discovering my location.

184
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:45,533
Did you find something interesting?

185
00:14:45,633 --> 00:14:47,669
- Listen, Mister...
- <i>No!</i>

186
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:49,604
You listen.

187
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:54,475
Report an accident to the corner
of Fifth and Dawkins over dispatch.

188
00:14:54,575 --> 00:14:58,379
You can believe me or not,
but if you don't,

189
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:01,216
then the blood of the victims
will be on your hands,

190
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:03,118
<i>not mine.</i>

191
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:08,723
By the way, you're down
to four minutes and 53 seconds.

192
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:10,592
52.

193
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,553
<i>51.</i>

194
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:17,933
<i>Radio to any available units.</i>

195
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,868
<i>We have possible signal 41 in progress</i>

196
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:23,671
<i>on 421 Fifth Avenue South.</i>

197
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:26,433
That's a familiar voice.

198
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:30,111
Not really. I spoke to her today
first time in a week.

199
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:32,940
I thought you guys
were patching things up.

200
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:38,253
She said possible 41 auto accident.
How does that make any sense?

201
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:41,261
It's 421 Fifth Avenue.
It's close by, let's take it.

202
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:44,520
Hey, look at it this way. At least now
she'll have to listen to you.

203
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:50,498
670, Radio. You said a possible 41?

204
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:54,636
<i>Ten-four 2670. It was a confusing call
on my end as well.</i>

205
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:57,472
<i>Are you available to go check it out?</i>

206
00:15:57,572 --> 00:16:00,134
Ten-four. En route. Hey.

207
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,925
I'll take a look around.

208
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:30,548
Radio, this is 670.

209
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:33,567
<i>Go for Radio.</i>

210
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:37,412
We're here, there's no sign
of a signal 41, nothing at all.

211
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:39,947
Did you trace the caller?

212
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:43,010
<i>Ten four, 2670. I got nothing.</i>

213
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:47,357
Copy.

214
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:51,365
Stand by, 2670.

215
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:54,529
- 911. What is your emergency?
- <i>You tell me.</i>

216
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,731
Listen, I've had enough of your pranks.

217
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,368
Are you aware that is a felony
to prank call an emergency to 911?

218
00:17:00,468 --> 00:17:04,472
<i>Oh, no! A felony?
Well, perhaps I should just stop now.</i>

219
00:17:04,572 --> 00:17:08,309
<i>So, you sent a unit over to the location
like I asked? Did they find anything?</i>

220
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:12,146
No, nothing. They found nothing
because there is nothing there.

221
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:15,250
You've wasted my time
and the time of two police officers.

222
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,119
- <i>Are you sure about that?</i>
- Yes, I am sure about that.

223
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,125
<i>Please, stop shouting.</i>

224
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:24,150
<i>Remember that the primary responsibility
of an emergency operator</i>

225
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,227
<i>is to keep the caller calm.</i>

226
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,329
<i>Check with the officer one more time.</i>

227
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:31,499
<i>We must be certain before
making any rash decisions.</i>

228
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,050
Radio to 2670, are you certain
there is no sign of an accident?

229
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,800
<i>No sign of a signal 41. Nothing at all.</i>

230
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:42,103
Prank call.

231
00:17:42,577 --> 00:17:45,639
Wasted time? Let's get out of here.

232
00:18:15,776 --> 00:18:19,139
2670, come back.

233
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:21,782
Jeremy...

234
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:25,102
<i>Let me guess. Signal 41.</i>

235
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:29,316
<i>A car accident. And right on time.</i>

236
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:33,495
You did this. You made this happen.

237
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:36,897
<i>Now that is really a stretch.</i>

238
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:40,335
<i>Good luck explaining that
to your superiors.</i>

239
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:43,271
<i>I know a lot about you, Pam.</i>

240
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:46,774
<i>And have a great deal of more surprises
in store for you today.</i>

241
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:49,777
No, you need to find someone else
to play games with.

242
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:52,780
I assure you if you had anything
to do with that accident,

243
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,543
you're gonna be very sorry
you ever dialed 911.

244
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:02,479
Oh, my God!

245
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:16,329
No!

246
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:18,304
What do you want?

247
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,910
<i>For you to understand
the fear I will create.</i>

248
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,653
Fear like you've never felt before.

249
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:28,816
<i>Fear that will scar you for life.</i>

250
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:32,720
Please, don't hurt her.
I will do anything you want.

251
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,556
I can get you a hostage negotiator.

252
00:19:35,656 --> 00:19:38,759
I don't want a negotiator, Pam.
I want you.

253
00:19:38,859 --> 00:19:41,396
And I want you to cooperate.

254
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:45,233
- I chose you specifically for this task.
- I can't do this.

255
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:49,670
<i>Either you'll put the lives
of a few pigs in the line of danger,</i>

256
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,408
pigs that have sworn
to protect and serve.

257
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,077
<i>Or you'll watch
as your daughter struggles</i>

258
00:19:56,177 --> 00:20:00,331
as she's slowly submerged
into the watery depths.

259
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,930
I always liked poetry.

260
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,679
<i>It's your choice.</i>

261
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,272
Jeremy! Don't move!

262
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:23,404
Look, just fall on me. Just fall.
Go ahead, I got you. I got you. I got you.

263
00:20:23,504 --> 00:20:27,226
There we go, alright. Come on. Come on.

264
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:34,441
Come on. Alright, come on.
Roll out. Roll over. Come on, man.

265
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,485
Come on, Jerry, let's go!

266
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:40,387
Alright, just go out.

267
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,916
Son of a bitch, you are lucky!

268
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:49,130
<i>Now, let's set up the rules.</i>

269
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,865
<i>Rule number one:</i>

270
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:56,571
<i>You will ignore all incoming calls and
remain on the line with me at all times.</i>

271
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:59,941
<i>Rule number two:
You will ask nothing of me,</i>

272
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:03,370
<i>and you will answer any question
that I ask you.</i>

273
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:07,915
Rule number three: Obey!

274
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:10,318
You will comply with my every request

275
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:13,588
and you will see to it
that they're carried out to a tee.

276
00:21:13,788 --> 00:21:17,362
<i>And you will do so without asking
for assistance from your co-workers</i>

277
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:20,070
like you're attempting to do now.

278
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:22,897
You can see me?

279
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:27,402
<i>It's surprising how easy it is
to intercept the video</i>

280
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:30,971
<i>of a "high security"
state protected building</i>

281
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:33,741
<i>even from a safe distance.</i>

282
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:35,877
<i>Take a sip of your coffee.</i>

283
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:38,271
That's not mine.

284
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:41,793
I'd hate for something to happen
to your daughter because you're disgusted

285
00:21:41,893 --> 00:21:45,045
by the thought of drinking
after your friend.

286
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:58,792
You ready?

287
00:21:58,966 --> 00:22:00,727
Yeah.

288
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:08,502
- Got it, got it.
- Ready?

289
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:10,637
Freeze!

290
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:16,977
I will shoot!

291
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,818
Shit.

292
00:22:29,246 --> 00:22:31,008
Nothing.

293
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:39,507
Nothing. Did you see anything?

294
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:41,609
I was pulling you out of the car.

295
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:44,363
It's some kind of hit and run, man.

296
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,849
Thanks, buddy. He came straight at me.

297
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,233
Better call back-up.

298
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:55,990
- <i>Radio 670 requesting code 21.</i>
- What do I say?

299
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:00,161
<i>An officer is calling for back-up, Pam.
So, send him some back-up.</i>

300
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:01,929
Ten-four 670.

301
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,136
<i>The accident didn't happen until we got here.
What the hell is going on?</i>

302
00:23:05,236 --> 00:23:08,695
- Careful.
- I don't know.

303
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:14,409
Radio to any available units. I'm requesting
code 21 to 421 Fifth Avenue south.

304
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:18,799
<i>Ten-four Radio. This is 26040. En route.</i>

305
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,831
See, that wasn't so hard, was it?

306
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:24,551
Sorry about that. It's not easy
looking beautiful all the time.

307
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:27,060
- Are you ready for that break now?
- <i>Ignore her.</i>

308
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,740
It's okay.
I'm in the middle of a call, so...

309
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,227
- I'll take it over.
- No, she won't.

310
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,048
No, really, I'm gonna finish this one.

311
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:36,631
- Just give me the call, Pam.
- <i>Deal with her!</i>

312
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:40,701
I know you're trying to get a raise. But you
don't have to impress the callers, too.

313
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:44,105
- I'm warning you.
- It's not that. I just want to finish this call.

314
00:23:44,205 --> 00:23:48,175
- Enough, Pam. Get up!
- Get rid of her now!

315
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:50,170
Hell, I could use a 15.

316
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:56,776
I just hate office drama.

317
00:23:58,285 --> 00:24:00,687
<i>The officer you were speaking to...</i>

318
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:03,991
- <i>he's quick</i>
- He's just a cop doing his job.

319
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:07,061
<i>I think he understands
what we're trying to accomplish.</i>

320
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:10,131
We? I don't even know
what you're trying to accomplish.

321
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:13,368
<i>I'd like to report another crime.
Property damage.</i>

322
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:16,404
<i>It's 1731 Weathervane Drive.</i>

323
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:20,425
- <i>Send 2670 to check it out.</i>
- He was just in an accident.

324
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:25,139
Besides, a cop can't leave the scene of
the crime when he's the first to respond.

325
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:28,716
Are you still there?

326
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:31,853
<i>Figure something out.
I'm not gonna do your job for you.</i>

327
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:36,715
- <i>If he isn't at the scene in five minutes...
</i>- Okay. Okay.

328
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:40,853
Just don't hurt her.
I'll see what I can do.

329
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:45,667
Okay, guys... guys! So you had to check
out an accident and then it happened.

330
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:48,969
Yeah, man, like I just told you.
Home-boy here plowed straight into me.

331
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:51,238
Wait a second.
That doesn't add up at all.

332
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:54,191
- No shit!
- <i>Radio for 2670.</i>

333
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,445
- Go for 670.
- <i>I've got a lead on that suspect.</i>

334
00:24:57,545 --> 00:25:00,981
<i>Somebody spotted him
at 1731 Weathervane Drive</i>

335
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:03,417
<i>requesting a code 12.
Are you able to pursue?</i>

336
00:25:03,517 --> 00:25:05,937
Confirm that. That cruiser
was damaged in the crash.

337
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:09,156
We're gonna be cruising in
Cruiser 644 from this point.

338
00:25:09,256 --> 00:25:11,881
Hold on! Wait! Are you out of your mind?

339
00:25:11,981 --> 00:25:15,329
- You can't leave the scene of an accident.
- Unless we're pursuing a suspect.

340
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:16,578
For?

341
00:25:16,678 --> 00:25:20,335
- Attempted homicide with a vehicle.
- You don't know what the hell he looks like.

342
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,331
That's what we're going to find out.
Are you coming?

343
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:32,263
Well done, Pam.

344
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:36,300
That police officer, do you know him?

345
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,755
- Why would I know him?
- You called him by his name.

346
00:25:40,955 --> 00:25:43,316
<i>Jeremy I think it was.</i>

347
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:47,528
I heard it over the radio.

348
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:49,797
Are you attracted to him, Pam?

349
00:25:50,197 --> 00:25:52,865
I know the names
of a lot of police officers.

350
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,502
I talk to them all the time.

351
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:57,204
Doesn't mean that I know them
or that I am attracted to them.

352
00:25:57,304 --> 00:26:02,009
And if he has another mishap, and can
no longer walk away from the scene.

353
00:26:02,109 --> 00:26:05,645
Or if he is killed
in the line of duty...

354
00:26:05,885 --> 00:26:07,428
tell me, Pam...

355
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:11,544
<i>would you shed a tear
for officer Jeremy?</i>

356
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:14,681
No.

357
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:48,088
- What day of the week is it?
- Friday.

358
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:51,191
So where the hell is everybody?

359
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:55,862
- Long weekend, maybe.
- Nah, I don't think so. Something's up.

360
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:58,833
Let me have a look around.
Make sure no one leaves here.

361
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:00,827
Copy that.

362
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:24,684
Anyone here? Police officer!

363
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:31,665
670 for Radio.

364
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:36,035
- <i>Go, 670.</i>
- We got a code 23.

365
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:38,572
Nobody here, it's empty.

366
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:41,234
Hey, Howard, you got anything?

367
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:44,354
No, I got nothing.

368
00:27:56,156 --> 00:27:58,585
You got to be kidding me.

369
00:28:02,696 --> 00:28:04,591
Williams!

370
00:28:14,741 --> 00:28:17,044
2670, please, come in.

371
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:19,514
<i>I don't think he copied.</i>

372
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,216
- You son of a bitch!
- <i>Watch him.</i>

373
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:25,121
- Then leave me alone, you sick...
- We got a 10-33!

374
00:28:25,221 --> 00:28:27,989
10-33, officer down! We need backup now.

375
00:28:28,089 --> 00:28:29,557
Ten-four, 670.

376
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:34,295
All units, all units! We have a 10-33.
It's 1731 Weathervane Drive.

377
00:28:34,395 --> 00:28:36,413
Officer down.

378
00:28:58,953 --> 00:29:00,947
Easy, partner.

379
00:29:03,456 --> 00:29:06,393
- Did you see anything?
- No, nothing.

380
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:08,955
What about Williams, where is he?

381
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,803
<i>Jeremy, Howard, do you copy?</i>

382
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:19,873
<i>670 for Radio, we're okay.
We might have a possible 10-54 here.</i>

383
00:29:19,973 --> 00:29:24,515
- <i>We need backup right now.</i>
- Ten-four. They're on the way.

384
00:29:25,646 --> 00:29:28,515
<i>You even know the name of his partner.</i>

385
00:29:28,615 --> 00:29:31,085
<i>You do care about this one.</i>

386
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:35,455
They'll find you. Do you know
what they do to cop-killers in prison?

387
00:29:35,555 --> 00:29:39,226
<i>For me to go to prison
I would have to get caught first.</i>

388
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:41,362
<i>But I have no intention
of getting caught.</i>

389
00:29:41,462 --> 00:29:45,266
You underestimate him. He will find you.

390
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,030
He?

391
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:51,037
Who's he? Pam, tell me...

392
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,136
is the hero going to barge in,

393
00:29:53,236 --> 00:29:56,610
<i>in his police blues
and throw handcuffs on the bad guy?</i>

394
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,013
<i>Is that how it's going to play out?</i>

395
00:29:59,113 --> 00:30:03,284
How many times have you received
an emergency call from a bad neighborhood

396
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,653
only to discover that the police
wouldn't go there

397
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:08,289
<i>simply because they're not
guaranteed their safety?</i>

398
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,541
<i>Or have your ever been walking home,
heard a scream of someone calling for help.</i>

399
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:14,528
<i>What do you do?</i>

400
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:16,497
Do you rush to their assistance?

401
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:19,666
Or do you put your head down
and just keep walking?

402
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:24,105
<i>We're all bad guys, Pam.
We're all complicit in crimes.</i>

403
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,341
<i>We turn a blind eye to death everyday.</i>

404
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:29,710
<i>No one weeps for the victims.</i>

405
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:33,440
We only care when it happens
to someone important to us.

406
00:30:34,114 --> 00:30:37,451
- You're insane.
- <i>Am I?</i>

407
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:40,620
Or am I the only one with clear head?

408
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,850
The only difference between you and I

409
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,653
<i>is that I have the conviction
to go after what I want.</i>

410
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:50,230
And on that note,
I have another crime to report.

411
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,091
No.

412
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:54,794
No, I'm done helping you.

413
00:31:02,408 --> 00:31:05,272
- Are you there? Did you hear me?
- <i>Watch your screen.</i>

414
00:31:14,037 --> 00:31:16,257
No. No, please.

415
00:31:17,357 --> 00:31:20,260
- Please stop.
- <i>Mommy! Help!</i>

416
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,654
<i>Remember, a 911 call operator
must remain calm at all times.</i>

417
00:31:25,754 --> 00:31:28,469
Please. Stop, I'll do whatever you want.

418
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:31,505
<i>I understand your hesitations, Pam.</i>

419
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:33,540
<i>But don't for a second think</i>

420
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,311
<i>that I am not prepared
to do what is necessary.</i>

421
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:40,239
<i>Don't defy me again!</i>

422
00:31:42,582 --> 00:31:44,218
What do you want me to do?

423
00:31:44,318 --> 00:31:48,055
<i>Send officer Jeremy and his partner
to 12 Westmont Circle.</i>

424
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:50,483
<i>Breaking and entering.</i>

425
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:21,243
The only cop I knew who used
to take his kids to school every day.

426
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:31,157
He used to play
with Cassie all the time.

427
00:32:32,316 --> 00:32:35,511
We all end up the same way
sooner or later.

428
00:32:37,837 --> 00:32:39,766
He played us, you know that?

429
00:32:41,275 --> 00:32:43,570
Waiting for us to get to the scene.

430
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:47,481
Why do you say that?

431
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:49,476
Read this.

432
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:00,694
Jesus Christ, why didn't you
tell me about your daughter?

433
00:33:00,794 --> 00:33:02,846
Don't you think we should call this in?

434
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:06,967
He's got dispatcher, hears everything.
Every damn thing we say.

435
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:08,812
No.

436
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:11,071
<i>2670.</i>

437
00:33:11,171 --> 00:33:12,776
Go, 670.

438
00:33:12,876 --> 00:33:16,176
<i>I've got a report of a signal 42
at 12 Westmont Circle.</i>

439
00:33:16,276 --> 00:33:20,180
- <i>Are you available to check it out?</i>
- Looks like it's just you and me, Howie.

440
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,109
This asshole can't know we're on to him.

441
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:27,120
- Okay?
- Right.

442
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,915
Ten-four. We're on our way.

443
00:33:35,395 --> 00:33:38,425
- What?
- <i>Incoming.</i>

444
00:33:42,135 --> 00:33:43,537
Aren't you gonna answer that?

445
00:33:43,637 --> 00:33:46,206
<i>You better do something.
She's making a scene.</i>

446
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:49,476
- How many calls did you put on hold?
- Grace.

447
00:33:49,576 --> 00:33:51,512
What are you waiting for?
Answer the damn thing.

448
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,415
I'm... No!

449
00:33:54,515 --> 00:33:56,843
<i>Hello, are you really there?</i>

450
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:01,227
You just hung up on them.

451
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:04,174
- You bitch.
- What the hell is going on here?

452
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:06,660
- She's ignoring callers.
- That's not true.

453
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,696
- Grace, I don't...
- Tony. Tony.

454
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:12,499
What are you, nine years-old?
Enough drama.

455
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,503
- She's ignoring callers.
- If she were, I would know about it.

456
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:20,460
Alright, everyone, thank you very much.
Back to work, please.

457
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,602
Take a 15.

458
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:30,183
- Hello. 911. What's your emergency?
- <i>You broke rule number one!</i>

459
00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:33,420
- My co-worker pressed the button.
- <i>Don't let it happen again.</i>

460
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,724
<i>This is 670. ETA to the location
is approximately three minutes.</i>

461
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:39,859
Ten-four, 670.

462
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:43,564
<i>Are you sure there isn't something
going on between the two of you?</i>

463
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:47,601
<i>His last name wouldn't happen
to be Miller, now would it?</i>

464
00:34:47,701 --> 00:34:50,637
If you already know it is,
then why are you asking me?

465
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:54,508
<i>No questions. You've been lying to me.</i>

466
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:57,611
I didn't lie. We're separated.

467
00:34:57,711 --> 00:34:59,079
<i>Is he handsome?</i>

468
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:03,209
He has brown hair, blue eyes.
He's a good...

469
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:11,253
- He's a thoughtful man.
- <i>And yet you're not with him!</i>

470
00:35:11,353 --> 00:35:14,000
<i>Is he a crooked cop?</i>

471
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,563
No, he's a good person.

472
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:18,764
<i>Then why, Pam?</i>

473
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:21,447
<i>Why aren't you with him?</i>

474
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,736
<i>Alright, that's enough for now.
Compose yourself.</i>

475
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:30,106
<i>You don't need anyone asking questions.</i>

476
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:40,212
We're almost there.

477
00:35:40,554 --> 00:35:42,949
Something on your mind?

478
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,058
Yeah, sure.

479
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:48,594
He's got my wife and daughter.
Can't do anything about it.

480
00:35:48,694 --> 00:35:50,924
Untraceable numbers.

481
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:54,060
The guy's just covering his tracks.

482
00:35:55,602 --> 00:35:59,106
The thing is when I was working as state
detective before we rode together,

483
00:35:59,206 --> 00:36:02,601
we had this case,
untraceable numbers, dozens of them.

484
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:06,739
You can't break them.
Even got the FBI involved.

485
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:11,171
So, some idiot is pulling prank phone calls
and you couldn't find him. Big deal.

486
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:12,462
Howard, think about it.

487
00:36:12,562 --> 00:36:16,318
To go to this much trouble
is gonna be a bigger pitcher, right?

488
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:21,762
Like hacking into security cameras
of a state operating building, right?

489
00:36:21,862 --> 00:36:23,623
Exactly.

490
00:36:24,297 --> 00:36:26,416
What happened with you and Pam?

491
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:29,269
That night, with the fire,
with Cassie nearly got killed...

492
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:31,338
hit me hard, you know.

493
00:36:31,438 --> 00:36:34,967
I went off the deep end,
I got suspended, I got demoted.

494
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:38,345
- This is how you ended a bag in uniform.
- Sure.

495
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:42,015
Pam left you because
she blames you for the fire?

496
00:36:42,115 --> 00:36:45,211
She blames me because
I wasn't there that night.

497
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:49,249
- She had a point.
- What the hell is this?

498
00:36:53,593 --> 00:36:55,822
- I'll take the back.
- Copy.

499
00:36:58,832 --> 00:37:01,894
Is anyone in here? Anyone?

500
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,377
Anyone here?

501
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:14,648
670, Radio, we have a signal 33
at 12 Westmont, Code 3.

502
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:17,343
Anyone here? Police officer!

503
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:25,017
Police officer. Anyone need help?

504
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,490
Hey, wait, wait, wait! We have
a possible 10-70 heading eastbound.

505
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:27,120
Where's my daughter?
My daughter, where is she?

506
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,649
The hell are talking about, bitch?

507
00:38:30,924 --> 00:38:35,128
- I ain't got no kid.
- You've been targeting cops all day. Why?

508
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:38,324
What are you talking about?
You're the first I seen all day.

509
00:38:38,765 --> 00:38:42,068
Okay. What were you doing here?

510
00:38:42,168 --> 00:38:46,019
Somebody paid me. I... Somebody
paid me. I don't know his name.

511
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:47,896
I was supposed to be there
an hour before,

512
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:51,277
set fire to the place and make it
look like an accident, okay.

513
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:54,170
But it took too long and you...
You caught up with me.

514
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,210
- Look, I swear, I...
- Shut up! Just shut up!

515
00:39:05,725 --> 00:39:08,020
What'd he look like?

516
00:39:08,762 --> 00:39:12,132
I don't know. Normal. White guy.

517
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:16,796
Look, he may be on the streets. Today's
the first day I met him, okay? Now just...

518
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:29,549
- What are you doing?
- I thought he had your gun.

519
00:39:29,649 --> 00:39:32,978
You're a police officer.
How're you gonna explain this?

520
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:37,190
- 670. 670, Radio.
- Go for Radio.

521
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:41,136
<i>I have a suspect down on code 33.
Requesting fire and the EMT to location.</i>

522
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:45,742
Jesus Christ, Howard,
you can't just shoot a suspect.

523
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:11,918
What do you think?

524
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:17,123
The poor kid was just a pawn.
Had no idea what he was into.

525
00:40:18,464 --> 00:40:20,600
$10,000 is a lot of money
for this kind of job.

526
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,696
Somebody wanted them pretty bad?

527
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:29,168
- Georgia National.
- What?

528
00:40:30,744 --> 00:40:32,605
Couldn't be.

529
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,180
Hey, Howard. Howard.

530
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,875
- Do you have a second?
- Yeah.

531
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,878
Here, take a look at this.

532
00:41:16,622 --> 00:41:18,558
That doesn't make any sense.

533
00:41:18,658 --> 00:41:21,227
What are you talking about?
It makes perfect sense.

534
00:41:21,327 --> 00:41:23,096
That untraceable call case
I told you about,

535
00:41:23,196 --> 00:41:26,432
six of the same bank branches
were hit by the those numbers.

536
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:30,003
When they torched my house, all the
security files of the bank were in my home.

537
00:41:30,103 --> 00:41:31,671
Coincidence? You know what I think?

538
00:41:31,771 --> 00:41:33,840
Same people behind it.
It's all shit all along.

539
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,369
Jeremy. Jeremy, take a breath.
Take a breath.

540
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:40,903
This is too close to home for you,
I know they got your daughter but listen,

541
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:44,051
everything we've done today
we can answer for, but this...

542
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:46,853
dispatch hasn't sent us,
and we don't have probable cause.

543
00:41:46,953 --> 00:41:48,655
We're talking about my daughter here.

544
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:50,924
She's seen their faces.
You think they're gonna let her go?

545
00:41:51,024 --> 00:41:53,026
But you don't even know
if she's gonna be there.

546
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:56,463
You've convinced yourself she's there,
'cause you want to be the one who saves her.

547
00:41:56,563 --> 00:41:59,858
You don't know that
and if you're wrong, she's dead.

548
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:03,970
<i>Send your officers
to 3814 Willow Street.</i>

549
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,240
- What's the crime?
- <i>A shooting, suspected. A gang activity.</i>

550
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,909
Can't I send someone else?
They've got their hands full.

551
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:11,865
<i>Do as you're told.</i>

552
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:15,382
Oh, yeah, they'll kill her. As soon
as they won't need her for leverage.

553
00:42:15,482 --> 00:42:18,192
- As long as we do what he says...
- <i>Radio to 2670.</i>

554
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:20,821
- ...she's gonna be fine.
- Okay. Go for Radio.

555
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:24,957
<i>I've got a report for code 25
at 3814 Willow Street.</i>

556
00:42:25,057 --> 00:42:28,261
<i>Possible gang related.
Are you available to check it out?</i>

557
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:31,557
Let's take it, let's take it
and let's play along.

558
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,068
Ten-four. En route.
Hey, Howard, I'll drive.

559
00:42:38,168 --> 00:42:40,139
<i>Anarchy, chaos.</i>

560
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:43,694
<i>Haven't you ever wondered what would happen
if the safety parameters</i>

561
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:47,481
<i>that society puts in place for us
were simply removed?</i>

562
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:50,887
What if you called 911...

563
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:52,602
<i>and no one answered?</i>

564
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:55,548
Then a lot of innocent people would die.

565
00:42:56,456 --> 00:42:58,991
Of course you'd say that,

566
00:42:59,091 --> 00:43:01,631
but you're not talking about safety,

567
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:04,097
you're talking about shackles.

568
00:43:04,197 --> 00:43:08,384
Don't you see you can't force
a person to do anything?

569
00:43:08,484 --> 00:43:12,839
You'd have to get them to buy into a system,
but every system has an organizer,

570
00:43:12,939 --> 00:43:15,241
a person who wields control.

571
00:43:15,341 --> 00:43:17,543
And what about those people
you killed today?

572
00:43:17,643 --> 00:43:19,479
I didn't say no one would die.

573
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:23,876
Simply that I would return man
to its true nature.

574
00:43:25,118 --> 00:43:28,194
At the end of the day you're no more
special than the hundreds of criminals

575
00:43:28,294 --> 00:43:29,956
this office deals with.

576
00:43:30,056 --> 00:43:34,119
I think you're just too weak
to fit into your so-called system.

577
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:37,857
Well, then it seems
you've figured me out.

578
00:43:41,334 --> 00:43:43,496
I'm impressed.

579
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:56,108
What are you doing?
Willow Street is to the south.

580
00:43:56,316 --> 00:43:58,384
We're not going to Willow,
we're going to the bank.

581
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:01,821
You're out of your mind? What's gonna happen
when we don't show up at the other location?

582
00:44:01,921 --> 00:44:03,623
He knows we're going to Willow, right?

583
00:44:03,723 --> 00:44:06,492
By the time we get to the bank,
we'll be too late.

584
00:44:06,592 --> 00:44:10,130
You don't know how many people could be
there. We could be walking into an ambush.

585
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,460
If you don't want to do this, don't want
to back me up... she's not your daughter.

586
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:26,305
It's my wife. If I'm gonna die today, I want
to tell her I love her one more time.

587
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,818
- <i>They should have been there by now.</i>
- Maybe they hit some traffic.

588
00:44:31,918 --> 00:44:34,387
<i>I don't think they're going
where I told them to?</i>

589
00:44:34,487 --> 00:44:38,184
- You heard them on the call.
- You lied.

590
00:44:40,226 --> 00:44:43,289
And it's created a serious
fucking problem for me.

591
00:44:49,735 --> 00:44:52,739
I can fix it.
I can fix it, let me fix it.

592
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:58,111
Such an adorable girl! Perhaps she'll be
more adorable if she's a lifeless corpse.

593
00:44:58,211 --> 00:45:00,817
I'll do anything you want me to do.
What do you want me to do?

594
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:04,684
Convince them, Pam.
Convince them to go to Willow Street,

595
00:45:04,784 --> 00:45:07,900
or you'll watch
her goddamn head under water.

596
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,990
- Do it now!
- <i>Mommy! Help!</i>

597
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,260
2670, confirm you are en route
to Willow Street.

598
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,597
<i>ETA approximately three minutes.</i>

599
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:19,492
Hurry!

600
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:40,946
Turn these off.

601
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:10,416
- Anything?
- I can't see shit.

602
00:46:10,516 --> 00:46:14,650
- Do you want to go on the other side?
- I'll radio you when I'm in place.

603
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,482
Go.

604
00:46:17,924 --> 00:46:20,064
<i>Where the hell are they?</i>

605
00:46:46,852 --> 00:46:48,647
Ready for this?

606
00:46:49,388 --> 00:46:51,283
I'm in position.

607
00:46:52,025 --> 00:46:53,685
Go!

608
00:46:58,097 --> 00:47:00,092
Police!

609
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:01,086
No! No!

610
00:48:08,901 --> 00:48:12,428
Please! No! No!

611
00:48:12,772 --> 00:48:15,909
Who hired you? Where's my daughter?

612
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:18,177
Who're you talking about?

613
00:48:18,277 --> 00:48:21,707
- Who hired you?
- I ain't telling you shit.

614
00:48:22,448 --> 00:48:26,285
Don't come any closer.
I'll blow this bitch's brains out.

615
00:48:26,385 --> 00:48:29,254
Let her go. Put the weapon down.

616
00:48:29,354 --> 00:48:31,607
You have no idea
what's going on here, do you?

617
00:48:31,707 --> 00:48:34,236
I will take the shot.

618
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:38,849
Let her go. It's the only way
you can walk out of here.

619
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:44,763
Put it down! You didn't
sign up for this. Put it down!

620
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:49,735
Put it down. Put it down.

621
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,772
Good. Drop it!

622
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,087
Dead.

623
00:49:11,964 --> 00:49:13,792
Great.

624
00:49:15,134 --> 00:49:18,304
- I had the shot.
- Yeah, I see that.

625
00:49:18,404 --> 00:49:20,723
Also, the only person who
might have known where she is.

626
00:49:24,043 --> 00:49:26,179
Fuck, Howard.

627
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:27,874
Where are you going?

628
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:53,377
She's not here.

629
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:07,653
- <i>They went to the Bank, didn't they?</i>
- What the hell are you talking about?

630
00:50:07,753 --> 00:50:10,089
<i>You like doing things your own way?</i>

631
00:50:10,189 --> 00:50:13,485
<i>Well, it's time you learn
the consequences.</i>

632
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:16,098
Hey, come on.

633
00:50:16,198 --> 00:50:20,430
Okay? Okay? Alright? Alright?

634
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,569
Come on. Here you go.

635
00:50:23,669 --> 00:50:25,605
You've done this before, right?

636
00:50:25,705 --> 00:50:28,767
Alright, the EMT's
will be here any second.

637
00:50:43,689 --> 00:50:48,261
I was foolish to believe a cop would be
competent enough to follow simple commands.

638
00:50:48,361 --> 00:50:53,032
So, no more games, no more crimes
reported over dispatch.

639
00:50:53,232 --> 00:50:57,937
Tell officer Jeremy to get the money
that my men were taking from the bank

640
00:50:58,337 --> 00:51:01,407
and meet me at 643 Hawthorne.

641
00:51:01,507 --> 00:51:05,578
I repeat, 643 Hawthorne Street.

642
00:51:05,678 --> 00:51:07,947
Tell him to come alone.
It will be a civil exchange.

643
00:51:08,047 --> 00:51:10,861
He gives me the cash money,
I give him Cassie.

644
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:13,593
- Let me see my daughter.
- <i>I make the rules.</i>

645
00:51:13,693 --> 00:51:17,149
No. If you want me to cooperate,
then let me see her.

646
00:51:20,225 --> 00:51:24,263
<i>Next time you fail to cooperate, she goes
all the way under. You understand?</i>

647
00:51:24,363 --> 00:51:26,999
How am I supposed to deliver
a message if I can't use the radio?

648
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:32,164
<i>Why don't you use that cell phone
you've been texting him with all day?</i>

649
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,146
He can't just walk out of there
with all of that money.

650
00:51:40,246 --> 00:51:43,308
<i>He has a gun, doesn't he?</i>

651
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:48,154
- Pam?
- Jeremy.

652
00:51:48,254 --> 00:51:50,123
Are you okay?
You said you couldn't call.

653
00:51:50,223 --> 00:51:53,526
- <i>Are you at the bank?</i>
- Yeah. Hey, look, Cassie's not here.

654
00:51:53,726 --> 00:51:57,030
- Didn't you get my text?
- No, I had to turn it off when I came in here.

655
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,028
You had to be the one to save the day.

656
00:51:59,128 --> 00:52:02,334
I'm not to be a hero, okay?
I'm trying to save our daughter.

657
00:52:02,434 --> 00:52:04,763
Now he's nearly killed her.

658
00:52:06,438 --> 00:52:11,444
<i>He wants you to bring the money
to 643 Hawthorne Street. Alone.</i>

659
00:52:12,244 --> 00:52:15,314
He says he's gonna give you Cassie
in exchange for the money.

660
00:52:15,414 --> 00:52:18,684
<i>Jeremy he is not
screwing around anymore.</i>

661
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:23,956
I know. You get it...
Hey, I love you, okay?

662
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:26,418
Just go get Cassie back.

663
00:52:30,362 --> 00:52:31,777
You're not gonna like it.

664
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:34,634
I haven't liked anything
you've done all fucking day.

665
00:52:35,077 --> 00:52:37,579
Are you gonna back me up on this?

666
00:52:39,772 --> 00:52:41,966
- Yeah.
- Good.

667
00:52:42,107 --> 00:52:43,876
Everybody...

668
00:52:43,976 --> 00:52:46,038
on the floor. Now!

669
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,778
You!

670
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,049
Are you the manager?

671
00:52:58,023 --> 00:53:00,118
Come with me.

672
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:02,601
<i>I must applaud your efforts.</i>

673
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:07,266
<i>I thought you're going to use desperation,
but guilt is a much stronger motivator.</i>

674
00:53:07,366 --> 00:53:10,436
What do you care?
I'm just a pawn in your game.

675
00:53:10,536 --> 00:53:14,640
You know, the funny thing
about pawns and games, Pam,

676
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,342
the king is usually miserable.

677
00:53:17,442 --> 00:53:21,314
Too many things to do,
too many consequences to weigh,

678
00:53:21,414 --> 00:53:23,916
too many people depending upon him,

679
00:53:24,016 --> 00:53:26,878
and too many people
plotting against him.

680
00:53:27,886 --> 00:53:30,122
<i>Count your blessings, Pam.</i>

681
00:53:30,222 --> 00:53:32,918
Not every one has what you have.

682
00:54:04,957 --> 00:54:07,451
- What are you doing?
- I don't care what he says.

683
00:54:07,551 --> 00:54:11,163
We're not going there without backup.
The dispatch is compromised.

684
00:54:11,263 --> 00:54:13,468
Stanton, this is Howard.

685
00:54:13,568 --> 00:54:16,636
Listen, I need a big favor.
You got to call in every man you can.

686
00:54:16,936 --> 00:54:20,289
Have them meet us half a block
south 643 Hawthorne street.

687
00:54:20,389 --> 00:54:22,158
Stay out of view of the building.

688
00:54:22,308 --> 00:54:25,337
No, don't use the radio
to organize this.

689
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:28,781
- Is he gonna do it?
- Yeah.

690
00:54:28,881 --> 00:54:30,776
Excellent.

691
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:35,154
What do you think we got back there?
Two, three million?

692
00:54:35,254 --> 00:54:37,236
Probably more like four.

693
00:54:37,336 --> 00:54:40,176
Could buy a beautiful house with that.

694
00:54:40,626 --> 00:54:43,228
Tempting, isn't it?

695
00:54:43,328 --> 00:54:45,757
They got my daughter, Howard.

696
00:55:13,025 --> 00:55:15,928
<i>I hope Jeremy follows
his instructions this time,</i>

697
00:55:16,028 --> 00:55:19,164
<i>because this is your last chance
to see your daughter.</i>

698
00:55:19,264 --> 00:55:20,633
He will.

699
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:23,635
<i>That's what you said last time.</i>

700
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:27,573
That was just a miscommunication.
It's not gonna happen again.

701
00:55:27,673 --> 00:55:29,842
I'm gonna have to let you go.

702
00:55:29,942 --> 00:55:34,313
- What about our deal?
- <i>I'll still be listening and watching.</i>

703
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:36,715
<i>So see to it that there are no surprises</i>

704
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:41,780
<i>and that this transaction with your
husband is completed as promised.</i>

705
00:56:02,307 --> 00:56:03,635
Stanton.

706
00:56:09,915 --> 00:56:12,644
- What's going on?
- A ransom.

707
00:56:14,052 --> 00:56:16,255
- There's money in there?
- They've got his kid.

708
00:56:16,355 --> 00:56:18,891
Let's just keep our eye
on the prize, okay?

709
00:56:18,991 --> 00:56:20,987
I go in, give them the money,

710
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,662
- get my daughter back.
- Shouldn't we set up a perimeter?

711
00:56:23,762 --> 00:56:28,033
This guy was one step ahead of us
all day. He sees you, she dies.

712
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:30,536
- I don't like this.
- Now, this is my daughter!

713
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:34,089
We haven't scouted the location,
we don't have a perimeter,

714
00:56:34,189 --> 00:56:38,110
and you got us working this off the book.
Why isn't the captain involved in it?

715
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:41,046
We have a compromised dispatch,
one police officer's been killed.

716
00:56:41,146 --> 00:56:42,715
We don't know who we can trust anymore.

717
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:45,234
Let me go in there,
get my daughter to a safe zone.

718
00:56:45,334 --> 00:56:47,753
You can take it from there
and handle it how you want.

719
00:56:47,853 --> 00:56:50,515
I'm just asking you to wait here.

720
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,018
You good?

721
00:57:18,651 --> 00:57:20,853
911, what's your emergency?

722
00:57:20,953 --> 00:57:23,388
<i>Hello, are you really there?</i>

723
00:57:23,988 --> 00:57:27,710
Yes, ma'am, this is 911 dispatch.
What is your emergency?

724
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,695
<i>Bank robbery,
there's a bank robbery happening.</i>

725
00:57:29,795 --> 00:57:33,966
Ma'am, calm down. The police are aware
of the robbery, it's been dealt with.

726
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:36,801
<i>No, you don't understand,
it's happening right now.</i>

727
00:57:36,901 --> 00:57:40,172
- <i>Two guys with guns are holding us hostage.</i>
- Ma'am, that's impossible.

728
00:57:40,272 --> 00:57:43,676
<i>Listen, you bitch, I've been trying
to get through for the last 40 minutes.</i>

729
00:57:43,776 --> 00:57:45,844
<i>They're taking everything.</i>

730
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:49,481
<i>I'm at Georgia National Bank,
228 Crenshaw Blvd.</i>

731
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:54,519
- Excuse me, where did you say you were?
- <i>Georgia National, 228 Crenshaw Blvd.</i>

732
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:57,455
But that's... that's impossible!

733
00:57:57,555 --> 00:58:00,459
<i>Sorry? Are you listening to me?</i>

734
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,248
911, what is your emergency?

735
00:58:02,348 --> 00:58:04,196
<i>Two men have taken over
Georgia National Bank.</i>

736
00:58:04,296 --> 00:58:08,266
- What's your location?
- <i>1462 Farragut Drive.</i>

737
00:58:08,366 --> 00:58:11,770
- 911, what is your emergency?
- <i>We've got a bank robbery.</i>

738
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:16,001
- Which bank?
- <i>Georgia National 4658 Coakley Street.</i>

739
01:00:43,555 --> 01:00:47,351
This is 670 to SWAT. No one's here.

740
01:00:48,743 --> 01:00:51,038
I repeat, no one's here.

741
01:01:02,374 --> 01:01:03,542
What do you have?

742
01:01:03,642 --> 01:01:06,211
Foot prints up top.
They cleared out, man.

743
01:01:06,311 --> 01:01:08,781
- Is that sure?
- Yeah, ten-four.

744
01:01:08,881 --> 01:01:12,610
- He knows the protocol.
- Thanks again, man.

745
01:01:18,423 --> 01:01:21,660
- Pam?
- <i>Jer... it's not...</i>

746
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,762
I can't hear you. Baby?

747
01:01:23,862 --> 01:01:26,031
Cassie's gone, okay?
He's playing us again.

748
01:01:26,131 --> 01:01:27,799
<i>I know...</i>

749
01:01:27,899 --> 01:01:31,463
No, look, baby, I can't hear you.
Hang on, hang on.

750
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,252
Pam.

751
01:01:47,352 --> 01:01:49,922
- Pam, you hear me?
- <i>Don't...</i>

752
01:01:50,022 --> 01:01:51,924
Jesus Christ.

753
01:01:52,424 --> 01:01:54,693
- Pam!
- <i>Don't go in.</i>

754
01:01:54,793 --> 01:01:59,531
What are you talking about?
No one's here. Cassie's not here.

755
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:03,702
<i>It's a trap. He's not hitting one
of the banks. He's hitting all of them.</i>

756
01:02:03,802 --> 01:02:06,531
<i>They're all getting taken right now.</i>

757
01:02:15,313 --> 01:02:17,442
Shit! Get out of here!

758
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:29,737
Jeremy?

759
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,235
Jeremy!

760
01:02:37,335 --> 01:02:39,864
Jeremy, can you hear me?

761
01:03:04,762 --> 01:03:07,566
- <i>Do I have your attention now?</i>
- Why?

762
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:12,367
- He did everything you asked him to do.
- Because he didn't come alone.

763
01:03:12,467 --> 01:03:14,473
<i>You know how it makes me feel, Pam?</i>

764
01:03:14,573 --> 01:03:17,942
It makes me feel
like you think I'm a pawn.

765
01:03:18,042 --> 01:03:19,945
<i>Like you think this is all a game</i>

766
01:03:20,045 --> 01:03:23,128
- and that you are the chess master.
- <i>I told him to go alone.</i>

767
01:03:23,228 --> 01:03:26,396
<i>They called in for SWAT team
to back them up. I counted 20 of them.</i>

768
01:03:26,496 --> 01:03:28,729
- 20?
- <i>21 casualties...</i>

769
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:33,284
- <i>if you include our officer Jeremy.</i>
- You're gonna burn in hell for this.

770
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:38,456
<i>Careful, Pam.
You still have a job to do.</i>

771
01:03:40,064 --> 01:03:43,502
What the hell makes you think I'm
gonna do anything you ask me to do?

772
01:03:43,602 --> 01:03:47,231
<i>Because I'll blow your kid's
fucking head off if you don't.</i>

773
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:50,876
It's your job to remain calm, not mine.

774
01:03:51,276 --> 01:03:56,073
I suggest you compose yourself unless you
want to lose a second family member.

775
01:03:56,173 --> 01:03:59,654
Pam... are you okay?

776
01:04:00,819 --> 01:04:03,114
Yeah, I'm fine.

777
01:04:05,023 --> 01:04:06,739
That's right.

778
01:04:07,726 --> 01:04:10,846
Because I still need you, Pam.

779
01:04:10,946 --> 01:04:12,474
My accomplice.

780
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:15,710
<i>I couldn't have done this without you.</i>

781
01:04:16,768 --> 01:04:20,140
You're the one who sent officer Jeremy
and his partner to those scenes

782
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,500
before the crimes happened.

783
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:27,479
<i>And you're the one who told them
to take the money from the bank.</i>

784
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:30,916
And you're the one who sent
those officers to their death.

785
01:04:31,016 --> 01:04:35,353
And now, the only one who can
corroborate your story is dead.

786
01:04:35,453 --> 01:04:38,949
I never would have helped you.
You threatened my daughter.

787
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:44,522
Fear is what drives mankind
to his greatest accomplishments.

788
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:51,052
Only someone with the nerves to overcome
his fear can scale the highest mountain...

789
01:04:51,152 --> 01:04:53,714
<i>when a lesser man wouldn't dare.</i>

790
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,269
Or rob ten banks simultaneously.

791
01:04:59,978 --> 01:05:03,214
No doubt you've figured it out by now.

792
01:05:03,314 --> 01:05:07,776
It's a shame you didn't figure it out
in time to save Jeremy.

793
01:05:11,856 --> 01:05:13,692
<i>Tell me...</i>

794
01:05:14,092 --> 01:05:15,739
<i>are you still afraid?</i>

795
01:05:17,462 --> 01:05:21,433
- What should I do?
- <i>One more crime to report.</i>

796
01:05:21,533 --> 01:05:26,705
Call in a hostage situation
at 1296 Faulkner Blvd.

797
01:05:26,805 --> 01:05:28,967
The Emergency Dispatch Center.

798
01:05:35,614 --> 01:05:37,916
Who's taking the hostages?

799
01:05:38,016 --> 01:05:41,612
You are. Convince them, Pam.

800
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,403
Radio to all available units.

801
01:05:58,503 --> 01:06:01,999
This is dispatch operator Pamela Miller.

802
01:06:02,373 --> 01:06:06,744
I've taken the Dispatch Center
of Faulkner Blvd. under my control.

803
01:06:06,844 --> 01:06:09,906
And I have a number of hostages.

804
01:06:11,483 --> 01:06:13,435
<i>I am the criminal behind the events</i>

805
01:06:13,535 --> 01:06:17,384
<i>that took the lives of two civilians
and a number of police officers.</i>

806
01:06:18,523 --> 01:06:21,359
<i>As many of you know,
my husband, officer Jeremy Miller</i>

807
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:25,589
<i>used to be a state police detective
before being demoted.</i>

808
01:06:26,331 --> 01:06:31,696
<i>He was so dedicated to his job that he put
the safety of our daughter in jeopardy.</i>

809
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:36,031
<i>And afterward he was simply cast aside.</i>

810
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:38,777
<i>We're all disposable.</i>

811
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:43,516
<i>It is only through fear that we are able
to get the attention of those with power.</i>

812
01:06:44,516 --> 01:06:48,779
My plans to rob Georgia National Bank
earlier were stopped.

813
01:06:49,687 --> 01:06:53,017
So I want my money brought to me here.

814
01:06:53,608 --> 01:06:57,037
Or I will begin executing hostages.

815
01:07:00,331 --> 01:07:02,392
That is all.

816
01:08:05,897 --> 01:08:07,659
I thought you had the flu.

817
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:11,913
Where is she?

818
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,868
Where is my daughter?

819
01:08:19,244 --> 01:08:20,445
Calm down, Pam.

820
01:08:20,745 --> 01:08:23,197
- Hey!
- Back off!

821
01:08:23,297 --> 01:08:24,349
It's okay.

822
01:08:24,449 --> 01:08:28,078
Everybody, just relax.
Everybody calm, stay down.

823
01:08:28,219 --> 01:08:32,440
- Oh, you've really done it now, Pam.
- How did you block that call?

824
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:37,462
Blocking its source is easy
if you're in control of the system.

825
01:08:37,562 --> 01:08:41,833
But I needed a cell phone to coordinate
with my people in the field.

826
01:08:41,933 --> 01:08:46,074
I just didn't anticipate that you'd find
that number. Well done, Pam.

827
01:08:46,174 --> 01:08:48,973
Where is she?
Where is my daughter, you son of a bitch?

828
01:08:49,073 --> 01:08:51,936
Why don't you just relax and sit down?

829
01:08:54,078 --> 01:08:56,080
Get back!

830
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,818
This is the man responsible
for the bombings. He has my daughter.

831
01:08:59,918 --> 01:09:03,688
I would do no such thing.
You got to be careful, Pam.

832
01:09:03,788 --> 01:09:06,396
Why would you do this to my family?
Why me?

833
01:09:06,496 --> 01:09:09,594
- I needed Jeremy, too.
- What?

834
01:09:09,694 --> 01:09:14,032
A state police detective
investigating a bank chain...

835
01:09:14,132 --> 01:09:15,934
architecture plans,

836
01:09:16,857 --> 01:09:18,637
money import transfer.

837
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:22,566
All I needed to do was to find a way
to get into his computer.

838
01:09:23,274 --> 01:09:27,011
So... I fed him
a dead end lead that night.

839
01:09:27,211 --> 01:09:28,680
What night?

840
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:32,343
Pamela, just... just put the gun down
before someone gets hurt.

841
01:09:34,018 --> 01:09:37,689
- The night of the fire.
- My daughter was in that house.

842
01:09:37,789 --> 01:09:41,059
Why don't you listen to Grace, Pam?

843
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:43,428
You two were so mad at each other.

844
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:46,230
That you didn't even care
what was left in the fire.

845
01:09:46,330 --> 01:09:49,117
Including Jeremy's laptop.

846
01:09:49,567 --> 01:09:52,971
So, what's your plan?
You're just gonna disappear?

847
01:09:53,506 --> 01:09:57,642
All the calls in here are recorded.
Eventually that will pin it back to you.

848
01:09:57,742 --> 01:09:59,844
Like that gun you're holding.

849
01:09:59,944 --> 01:10:02,539
Guess who is registered to?

850
01:10:03,047 --> 01:10:04,749
Jeremy.

851
01:10:04,849 --> 01:10:07,385
It's the one he thought
he lost in the fire.

852
01:10:07,485 --> 01:10:11,415
So you tell me how are you
going to explain that?

853
01:10:23,718 --> 01:10:27,071
- Ma'am. Ma'am, put the gun down now!
- I'm not the criminal.

854
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:29,341
She's crazy, she's been
sending cops all over...

855
01:10:29,441 --> 01:10:31,059
Shut up!

856
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:34,980
He has my daughter. He took over my line,
you can look at the call logs.

857
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:38,086
- Look at her, who has the gun?
- Ma'am, put the gun down now.

858
01:10:38,186 --> 01:10:41,810
I can't. If I do, he's gonna kill her.

859
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:44,022
- Kill who?
- My daughter!

860
01:10:44,122 --> 01:10:47,618
He's been robbing the banks
all day. Please!

861
01:10:51,395 --> 01:10:53,031
Pam, you got to stop this.

862
01:10:53,531 --> 01:10:55,926
- I thought you were dead.
- I made it out.

863
01:10:57,135 --> 01:10:59,129
What about Jeremy?

864
01:11:00,204 --> 01:11:03,567
He didn't make it. We can solve this.

865
01:11:03,841 --> 01:11:06,437
We can make it right,
but you got to put the gun down, baby.

866
01:11:08,045 --> 01:11:09,974
Please.

867
01:11:10,315 --> 01:11:12,909
Think about Cassie, Pam.

868
01:11:13,985 --> 01:11:15,879
That's it.

869
01:11:17,388 --> 01:11:19,416
Put it down.

870
01:11:44,315 --> 01:11:45,817
How'd we do?

871
01:11:45,917 --> 01:11:49,721
The other nine went down
without incidents. Little over 200 million.

872
01:11:49,821 --> 01:11:54,218
Good work, baby. Pulled it off.
We still got to get out of the town.

873
01:11:58,829 --> 01:12:01,199
What about my payment?

874
01:12:01,299 --> 01:12:03,927
I didn't forget about your payment.

875
01:12:08,372 --> 01:12:10,267
Thank you.

876
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:24,114
Let see what you got.

877
01:12:33,598 --> 01:12:35,392
Fuck.

878
01:12:41,973 --> 01:12:43,211
Yeah!

879
01:13:39,764 --> 01:13:41,491
Hey!

880
01:13:51,709 --> 01:13:54,104
What's going on?

881
01:14:31,949 --> 01:14:34,018
Baby, it's me.

882
01:14:34,118 --> 01:14:35,987
- Jeremy?
- Yeah.

883
01:14:36,087 --> 01:14:37,982
Baby.

884
01:14:38,082 --> 01:14:40,450
I thought you were dead.

885
01:14:42,093 --> 01:14:43,995
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

886
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,731
No. I'm sorry, I never
should have said all those things.

887
01:14:46,831 --> 01:14:51,402
Come on, I understand, I deserved that.
You have any idea where she is, baby?

888
01:14:51,502 --> 01:14:53,997
Not without my computer.

889
01:14:54,972 --> 01:14:56,767
Hang on.

890
01:15:00,644 --> 01:15:02,947
- Will this work?
- Yeah.

891
01:15:03,047 --> 01:15:07,543
Got it? We got to go.
We got to go. Come on.

892
01:15:09,637 --> 01:15:11,732
What was that number?

893
01:15:12,723 --> 01:15:14,618
Here, baby.

894
01:15:17,194 --> 01:15:18,830
It's gonna take long, baby?

895
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:21,959
Depends if he used the phone
in the last ten minutes.

896
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:25,195
He's on it right now.

897
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:28,506
Highway 11. Eastbound.

898
01:15:28,606 --> 01:15:30,200
Great.

899
01:15:36,247 --> 01:15:38,716
I'll call you
when we're a little closer.

900
01:15:38,816 --> 01:15:41,252
With any luck we're about an hour away.

901
01:15:41,352 --> 01:15:43,647
Be ready for us.

902
01:15:44,155 --> 01:15:45,849
Anything?

903
01:15:47,124 --> 01:15:48,485
Nothing.

904
01:15:49,293 --> 01:15:53,891
Don't worry, little girl.
You'll be seeing your mother very soon.

905
01:15:57,735 --> 01:16:00,371
- We're getting close?
- A mile or two at least.

906
01:16:00,771 --> 01:16:02,432
Shit.

907
01:16:04,341 --> 01:16:06,896
- What are you doing?
- Calling the precinct.

908
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:08,839
They can head us off.

909
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:11,778
- <i>This is Brody.</i>
- Captain, it's Miller.

910
01:16:11,878 --> 01:16:13,912
<i>Miller? Jesus. Where have you been?</i>

911
01:16:14,012 --> 01:16:17,182
You know those guys that took the Georgia
National? We're in pursue right now.

912
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:20,324
<i>They just took your ex in custody.
They tell me that she was in on it.</i>

913
01:16:20,424 --> 01:16:22,744
No, she wasn't. They were using her.

914
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:27,365
<i>Son, I know this has been an emotional day
for you. We can't argue with the evidence.</i>

915
01:16:27,465 --> 01:16:30,460
Captain, listen to me.
She's with me right now.

916
01:16:30,868 --> 01:16:32,904
- Hi, captain.
- <i>I'm sorry, Miller.</i>

917
01:16:33,004 --> 01:16:36,407
You don't chase the criminals, fair enough.
We're heading Eastbound on 11. Track us.

918
01:16:36,507 --> 01:16:38,568
- <i>Miller, stop what you're...</i>
- Fucking asshole.

919
01:16:41,045 --> 01:16:42,739
Baby.

920
01:16:43,097 --> 01:16:45,099
You're gonna need...
you're gonna need this.

921
01:16:45,549 --> 01:16:47,151
What? I can't.

922
01:16:47,251 --> 01:16:49,921
Baby, it's just you and me.
I can't do this without you.

923
01:16:50,021 --> 01:16:52,743
- No, I've never fired a gun.
- I know that. Listen.

924
01:16:52,843 --> 01:16:55,685
Soft trigger, two hands.

925
01:16:56,027 --> 01:16:58,704
They will try and kill us, so you
have a shot. You do not hesitate,

926
01:16:58,804 --> 01:17:02,130
you take the shot, you hear me?
You hear me?

927
01:17:04,101 --> 01:17:06,070
We're gonna get her.

928
01:17:06,537 --> 01:17:09,599
You'll be fine, I promise you.

929
01:17:12,776 --> 01:17:15,039
- Is that them?
- It's got to be.

930
01:17:20,784 --> 01:17:24,414
- So, which one is it?
- I don't know, the big one?

931
01:17:25,256 --> 01:17:26,657
- Are you sure?
- No.

932
01:17:26,757 --> 01:17:28,552
Hang on.

933
01:17:40,738 --> 01:17:42,866
- Watch out!
- Shit!

934
01:18:01,525 --> 01:18:03,620
Shit... get down!

935
01:18:16,574 --> 01:18:18,335
You're gonna hit them.

936
01:18:19,109 --> 01:18:21,672
- What, you're gonna hit them?
- Get down!

937
01:18:31,522 --> 01:18:32,957
- Baby, take the wheel.
- What?

938
01:18:33,057 --> 01:18:37,421
Take the wheel. Keep it steady, baby.
Baby, steady!

939
01:19:24,675 --> 01:19:26,535
Watch out!

940
01:19:29,847 --> 01:19:32,175
Fuck, that's got to hurt.

941
01:19:59,643 --> 01:20:02,399
Okay, listen. What I tell you.
You see a shot, you take it.

942
01:20:02,499 --> 01:20:05,541
Stay low, baby. Come on, now. Get down!

943
01:20:13,324 --> 01:20:16,027
Go around, baby. Get around back.

944
01:20:16,127 --> 01:20:18,655
Stay low. Stay low. Stay low!

945
01:21:21,191 --> 01:21:23,461
You're a disgrace to everything
we stand for.

946
01:21:24,061 --> 01:21:26,463
What are you taking about? Honor?

947
01:21:26,563 --> 01:21:29,666
I've been wearing
this goddamn uniform for 25 years.

948
01:21:29,766 --> 01:21:32,262
There's nothing honorable about...

949
01:21:37,975 --> 01:21:40,303
Just take the money.

950
01:21:56,693 --> 01:21:59,196
Is this why you did all this?
For the money?

951
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:03,059
It's not just about money, Pam.
It's about history.

952
01:22:03,334 --> 01:22:06,770
No one's ever had the smarts
to take down ten banks at once.

953
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:10,867
200 million dollars.
What are you, stupid...

954
01:22:15,445 --> 01:22:18,716
Don't do this! Jerry, don't do it, man!

955
01:22:18,816 --> 01:22:21,218
- Where is my daughter?
- She's in there.

956
01:22:21,318 --> 01:22:24,554
And this time, I'm gonna let her burn.

957
01:22:39,236 --> 01:22:42,072
Jerry! Don't do this!

958
01:22:42,172 --> 01:22:46,703
Don't be stupid, man.
It's 200 million fucking dollars!

959
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,853
Mommy! Help! Help me!

960
01:22:55,953 --> 01:22:59,349
Somebody, please help me!

961
01:23:25,916 --> 01:23:27,785
Come on, baby.

962
01:23:27,885 --> 01:23:31,221
- It's Daddy, come on. Baby.
- Baby.

963
01:23:31,321 --> 01:23:33,416
Are you okay?

964
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:36,852
Come on, baby, breathe. Breathe.

965
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:11,538
Daddy!

966
01:24:21,772 --> 01:24:24,918
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>
