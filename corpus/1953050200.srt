DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
THE KONGO

00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:32,784
What are you doing?

4
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:37,547
It will kill you.

5
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:39,322
I'll take care of my family.

6
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:46,553
Well, well, well, what
We have here, mate?

7
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,074
Ross is his master.

8
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,661
I met him, I ...
Shut up.

9
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:54,052
A beautiful diamond, Mr. Ross ...
I told you keep quiet!

10
00:01:55,755 --> 00:01:57,155
This is not a diamond,

11
00:01:58,695 --> 00:02:00,095
This is a shell.

12
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:02,862
Oh, look at Mr. Ross,
More diamonds.

13
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,736
No one escapes.

14
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,160
No!

15
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:12,845
Get back to work!

16
00:02:12,877 --> 00:02:14,077
Already in there.

17
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:15,943
All!

18
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:17,395
Come on!

19
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,860
Start digging!

20
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:26,765
You are just like
A flock of women.

21
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:51,186
Hey, hey.
Hey.

22
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:53,141
Motherfuckers.

23
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,910
I can not make heads
Without tails of it.

24
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:51,489
Where is the Whale ... the small type?

25
00:03:53,804 --> 00:03:55,304
McCormack!

26
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:57,663
3 The team is ready, Lieutenant.

27
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,250
When I give orders.

28
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,819
Reduce by a factor of
From seven to 1000 MHz

29
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:03,406
From now on.

30
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:12,187
Balls hydro
Are the sound of a fish to die.

31
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:15,141
Terry, Captain Smalls
Is looking for you.

32
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:17,337
He wants to see you immediately
In the command center.

33
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:20,944
Terry?

34
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:24,749
Hey, hey, hey.
Oh, hello Cray.

35
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,403
Look at this.

36
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,919
If I increase the frequency
Only five MHz can ...

37
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:30,861
To create a speed ... more
Stable than the sound.

38
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:33,408
Really?
Yes, look.

39
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:35,827
OK

40
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:39,837
Ok, look at the shark
Following the waves of sound.

41
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:41,078
Are you okay?

42
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:42,913
If we now increase the sound,

43
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:48,164
Then we will pursue the shark
Away from the noise.

44
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:50,106
Is not it amazing?

45
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:51,935
The sound will scare the shark.

46
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,611
This could change everything, oh ...

47
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:56,016
Ok, Terry,

48
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,461
I'm out of here before that
Great white shark is released.

49
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,965
Yes, yes, no, no, not just
Error in my figures hydroponics.

50
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,083
But

51
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,681
This is good, I'm in
Right way, that's good.

52
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,780
Remember that the
Captain Smalls want to see.

53
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:12,992
You need to be calm.

54
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:16,764
I love you,

55
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:18,392
... Even if you like to play
With big fish.

56
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:22,817
You come see me after
Speak with the Captain.

57
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,023
Here, you see me at 1:00.

58
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:29,871
I think I know what time it is.

59
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:30,974
You know.

60
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,031
This time?

61
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:35,464
This arrangement.

62
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:37,126
Yes.

63
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,136
OK

64
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:46,466
Lord.

65
00:05:46,562 --> 00:05:48,562
Sorry about the tank.

66
00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:51,705
I figured wrong, to increase frequency
I vibrate the walls and raise ...

67
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,779
Lieutenant McCormack, I am sure
That the research you're doing ...

68
00:05:54,903 --> 00:05:57,903
In sharks will prove a great
Value to our divers.

69
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:02,042
But now I want to be
Plumb say what you see there.

70
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:03,881
Thermal movements.

71
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:06,856
These are recent photos?

72
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,233
In real time,
10/2 apart.

73
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:11,617
Ten seconds?
It is not possible.

74
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:13,275
These are the whales, right?

75
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,679
No, sir.

76
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:18,453
The waves rise and fall of whales,
And a Sharks side to side.

77
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,645
If you look at the heat of
Projection you see ...

78
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:22,906
... The size, are all
Move as a unit.

79
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:24,678
This is huge.

80
00:06:24,827 --> 00:06:26,827
Lieutenant, you have
Sharks in your head.

81
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,930
What is a group of whales.

82
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,060
Captain, if you can put
My Hydro in water,

83
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:33,863
Then I think I can use radio
Active sonar to identify.

84
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,267
No, that's enough.

85
00:06:35,347 --> 00:06:37,347
All I wanted was a
Confirmation on that.

86
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:38,892
No, that is much larger than
What you think.

87
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:41,009
Lieutenant McCormack, enough.

88
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,530
The shark is dead.

89
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,802
Nobody saw it.

90
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:45,925
Pardon?

91
00:06:46,384 --> 00:06:48,884
Ah, the carcass was not found,
No remains found on the beach.

92
00:06:49,436 --> 00:06:52,036
No one can say with certainty
That the Megalodon was killed by ...

93
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:53,621
... The giant squid.

94
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:56,137
Lieutenant McCormack
Can get out of my deck.

95
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,166
Now.

96
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:00,483
Yes, sir.

97
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:11,685
Well, see you later.

98
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:12,811
Hey.

99
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:14,625
Are you okay?

100
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:17,204
What is happening? The Captain
Smalls gave you another sermon?

101
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:20,216
A heat source solid was
Found not far from here.

102
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,292
Stop, stop, stop.
What?

103
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:24,935
Corinne, the giant shark returned.

104
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:26,461
How, how do you know that?

105
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,506
Captain Smalls
Say something?

106
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:30,627
No, but he tried
Intimidate me, but I ...

107
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:31,910
So for sure it is nothing.

108
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,483
I need to put my
Tetrahydro sonic spheres in water,

109
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:35,613
There is a chance to stop it.
Dear to.

110
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:37,748
Did you hear that?

111
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:40,087
No sirens.
No movement.

112
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:41,215
Nothing.

113
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:42,307
Take it easy.

114
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:45,232
Will be okay.

115
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,025
"Will be okay."

116
00:07:49,228 --> 00:07:51,228
Meet me at 1:00 pm.

117
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,829
So, we can do something
About your stress.

118
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:54,495
Oh, yeah, oh yeah.

119
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:46,853
OK

120
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:52,265
Great.

121
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:54,146
Rays.

122
00:09:05,597 --> 00:09:07,197
What the hell was that?

123
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,425
Turn on the alarm.

124
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:26,693
Corinne?

125
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:28,351
Corinne?

126
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,071
Corinne?

127
00:09:35,383 --> 00:09:36,783
Corinne, agrees.

128
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:38,661
Come on, wake up, wake up.

129
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:56,931
Shit, shit.

130
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:01,755
Lord, we must go.

131
00:10:01,878 --> 00:10:03,378
We have to go now.

132
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:05,474
Lord, we must go now.

133
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:52,732
My ship, the son of a bitch.

134
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:43,528
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
KONGO

135
00:12:57,345 --> 00:12:58,745
How you doing, Michael?

136
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,001
Hello Nigel.

137
00:13:01,376 --> 00:13:02,776
Sorry for your pig,
Companion.

138
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:04,321
What happened?

139
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:06,826
He did not call me for three days.

140
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:09,126
Three days?

141
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:10,712
Three days?

142
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:11,782
No, no, no.

143
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,340
You'll have to explain
So my wife.

144
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:15,548
Love will stop, right?

145
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:17,614
But this time you will do for
Unless you're sorry.

146
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,741
Do you agree?

147
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,087
I agree.

148
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:22,561
Give me a whiskey, please.

149
00:13:28,704 --> 00:13:29,704
Thanks.

150
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:31,491
Toast.

151
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,210
Your pig almost killed me.

152
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:58,372
N, N, Nigel Potnam?

153
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:02,664
Well, there can be only one reason and
This is because I was born in Congo ...

154
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:04,073
And it's no fun.

155
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:05,932
No, sir.

156
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:08,493
Let me guess.

157
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:10,167
Problems with blood diamonds,

158
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:13,065
Or illegal coal mining
To give out this beautiful country.

159
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:15,267
Coal.

160
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:16,751
Coal.

161
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:18,817
I suppose the residents
Saw a thing ...

162
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:23,522
Strange creature of the holes
You did on the mountain?

163
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:25,848
Actually, yes.

164
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,581
I'm not interested.

165
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:42,532
We fold more
That you receive now.

166
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:45,297
Triple, if the pick up.

167
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:46,731
That was good.

168
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,541
I do not know, but no
Of our employees ...

169
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,601
Will continue to work in the area
Until they know he's dead.

170
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:55,075
What is a ghost?

171
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:57,135
A curse that has killed 34
Of our men.

172
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:08,029
Oh, yes, send my apologies
His wife for me, ah.

173
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:11,658
Come here semhora Australia.

174
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:13,934
Show me the ghost.

175
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:40,823
How long have you been seeking
For these creatures, ghosts, goblins ...

176
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:42,088
... Things like that?

177
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,760
Have you found something you see?

178
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,119
Something?

179
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:58,142
Look, I know what you think
We do is wrong,

180
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:00,269
But we pay the
Residents a living wage.

181
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:03,701
You know what I think?

182
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,246
If you have to work for you ...

183
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:09,306
We have to concentrate
In this monster in the jungle.

184
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:10,786
OK?

185
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:24,779
There is.

186
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,399
What is there?
I do not see anything.

187
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:31,828
Entire area.

188
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:34,999
There is nothing there.

189
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,420
Exactly.

190
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:07,388
Sorry Mr. Potnam,
We must hurry.

191
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,522
I have a meeting with the
Rebel leaders in two hours.

192
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,544
If you write a
Check now,

193
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,431
'll Just say that
That was a misunderstanding.

194
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:17,472
Yes, it sounds like
A good idea.

195
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:21,403
There are rumors that you,
As I say,

196
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:22,463
... Open.

197
00:17:23,471 --> 00:17:24,671
... For all this.

198
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:27,365
Lady Leget,

199
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:33,843
I've felt since the breathing
A white gorilla with 700kg ...

200
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:35,642
... In my neck.

201
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,125
I have struggled with creatures
Similar to lizards ...

202
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:43,245
With two heads and 15
Pointed tails ...

203
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,724
... That ate children.

204
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:47,451
I have seen all
Horrors of the jungle.

205
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:50,649
Well, there's nothing here,

206
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,829
... Or there, or anywhere,

207
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:54,668
... That surprises me.

208
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,479
But this was a creature.

209
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:01,443
It was nothing ..

210
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:03,653
How can you say that?

211
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:06,562
You're treading in their footsteps.

212
00:19:02,515 --> 00:19:04,515
Lady Leget.
What?

213
00:19:06,682 --> 00:19:08,382
Pretty cool, cool.

214
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,941
Hello, a little help here,
Please.

215
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:24,115
Well crocodile.

216
00:19:25,426 --> 00:19:26,727
Well crocodile.

217
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,050
Tell me.

218
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,375
Nigel, will get you out of this jungle?

219
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
Really?

220
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:09,262
Was the bogeyman this time?

221
00:21:10,576 --> 00:21:12,176
I Look, I've seen
Many crocodiles.

222
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:15,704
Come on man, you are still
A thief cheater.

223
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:18,531
Really?

224
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,377
And is to come here now?

225
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:25,072
Ok, I'll see out there.

226
00:21:25,878 --> 00:21:26,878
Luis.

227
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:28,458
Is Lewis.

228
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,780
This will cost the Nigel
Fifty percent.

229
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:48,027
Fifty? Fifty!
I want at least ten.

230
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,229
Vai dreaming.

231
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,859
I want my ten percent.
Yes, what you say.

232
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:53,614
My ten percent.

233
00:21:53,807 --> 00:21:55,307
Do not always take care of you?

234
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,650
What, like last time?

235
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:58,469
Look, my, the last time
Was not my fault.

236
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:00,465
I'll take care of you.

237
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:08,008
Nigel?

238
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:10,857
Yes, you're right, is the mother
Of all crocodiles.

239
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:18,538
Well, my, my boat may be
Available at the right price.

240
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
Tell him you want the
My ten percent.

241
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,850
Shut up.

242
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,877
Well, I mean I was thinking
Fifty percent.

243
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Ten percent.

244
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:28,121
Shut up.

245
00:22:32,055 --> 00:22:33,656
Well, good luck
Find another boat.

246
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:39,613
You're still a
Thief cheater,

247
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,039
... But you know what,

248
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:43,658
... Nothing less than
Fifty percent ...

249
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,406
Ah, ten percent.

250
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:48,497
Ok, bye.

251
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,344
You told him about the
My ten percent?

252
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
Shut up.

253
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:55,402
Look, we will navigate
Within an hour.

254
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:56,516
This is wonderful.

255
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:58,367
And you will not receive ten percent.

256
00:23:08,485 --> 00:23:09,985
3 HEARING ROOM

257
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:11,716
SECRET

258
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,460
You waivers your right
To health care.

259
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,131
You're the only survivor ...

260
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,280
A ship with more
Of 2200 passengers.

261
00:23:27,344 --> 00:23:28,344
You, you ...

262
00:23:28,592 --> 00:23:32,592
You could save emissions
Satellite USS GIBSON.

263
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,380
Ah, ah, I need the data.

264
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:37,661
I need the data because ah ...

265
00:23:38,005 --> 00:23:39,005
Would you like water?

266
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:41,093
No, no, no, I
Accurate data collection.

267
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,850
The ah, the impulse to sonic
Detect Megalodon.

268
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,363
... And it is possible that ...

269
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:52,339
It was my fault that the
Megalodon was there.

270
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:56,103
"That was my fault that
The Megalodon was there. "

271
00:23:57,221 --> 00:23:58,222
Get out!

272
00:23:58,858 --> 00:23:59,858
Sorry!

273
00:24:01,126 --> 00:24:02,626
I think very clear.

274
00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:05,303
This is my research.

275
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:07,763
Take.

276
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:10,708
Read it out there.

277
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:22,209
Lieutenant McCormack
I'm Special Agent Hutchinson ...

278
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:23,267
... NOAA.

279
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:27,502
Do not like to talk.

280
00:24:27,962 --> 00:24:29,962
Well, I say,
And you listen.

281
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:33,486
I represent an elite of a
Group of military commanders.

282
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,241
We go hunting,
Lieutenant McCormack

283
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:37,789
... To kill a shark.

284
00:24:37,932 --> 00:24:39,432
It was my fault.

285
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:42,181
It was my fault.

286
00:24:42,493 --> 00:24:44,493
You do not do any good if
Caught in your emotions.

287
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,442
Go rest.

288
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:48,376
I will not bother you again.

289
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:51,321
No!

290
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:52,647
No.

291
00:24:57,257 --> 00:24:59,257
I can help
Detect Megalodon.

292
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:01,235
I can create a bait,

293
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:03,319
And help kill this monster.

294
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,291
I need to help her
Kill this monster.

295
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:09,305
Please.

296
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:10,789
Okay.

297
00:25:11,082 --> 00:25:13,082
Do not get anything.
And start now.

298
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:15,114
Are you ready?

299
00:25:15,337 --> 00:25:16,337
Yes.

300
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:33,574
ATLANTIC OCEAN
650 KM SOUTH OF FLORIDA

301
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:42,858
There is ...

302
00:25:43,564 --> 00:25:44,564
Have you seen something?

303
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,708
Is not it great?

304
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:46,996
Yes.
Of course not.

305
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:51,322
You know I do not want to see?
The baby alligator coming out of it?

306
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:52,481
Exactly what I mean.

307
00:25:54,378 --> 00:25:55,378
Hey, man,

308
00:25:55,836 --> 00:25:57,337
... Are you sure of that
Nigel knows what he is doing?

309
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:58,974
Oh, you'll be fine.

310
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:00,855
Either way that
Thing will not wake up.

311
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:03,933
Mean that that
Thing still alive?

312
00:26:04,268 --> 00:26:05,568
Yes, it's just reassurance.

313
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:06,946
I have to get
Other work, man.

314
00:26:07,562 --> 00:26:08,562
Take it easy.

315
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:11,404
If something goes wrong.
You will receive ten percent.

316
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:46,732
Are you sure that this
Thing will not wake up?

317
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:48,629
No.

318
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:53,108
This is reassuring.

319
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:55,328
Do you have eggs?

320
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:57,398
Yes, on the deck, counting
And under control.

321
00:26:58,632 --> 00:26:59,932
That's all they did.

322
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
What?

323
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:03,058
Protect their eggs.

324
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:04,129
What?

325
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,621
Who wants an omelette
So big?

326
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:24,682
Guys, guys, Captain
Said to wear the vests.

327
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:28,391
Nigel, are you okay?

328
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:31,284
This is probably the way
Which sails this boat,

329
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:32,373
It may be drunk?

330
00:27:32,474 --> 00:27:34,174
Should remember about
Which takes the load.

331
00:27:38,716 --> 00:27:40,217
I do not think it's
The only monster here.

332
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,659
Is it, is beneath us.

333
00:27:49,304 --> 00:27:51,304
What you gonna do?
Want to sink us?

334
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,159
Wait, wait, maybe it's gone.

335
00:27:54,302 --> 00:27:55,802
Maybe it's gone.

336
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:01,977
The crocodile, crocodile,
Crocodile agreed.

337
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
Cut the rope.
Cut the rope.

338
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:05,413
I told you not to cut the rope.

339
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:07,009
If you cut down the rope
We have to go after two.

340
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:08,641
No, no, no, they will
Move one after another.

341
00:28:08,693 --> 00:28:10,493
You just said that he
Only protects their eggs?

342
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:11,265
Against that thing.

343
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:12,980
Not against us.
Cut the rope.

344
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:14,034
Let.

345
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,140
USS LEXINGTON
ATLANTIC OCEAN

346
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,505
Patalsky.
Admiral on deck, sir.

347
00:29:04,106 --> 00:29:05,506
Can not find my target?

348
00:29:05,606 --> 00:29:06,606
Negative, sir.

349
00:29:08,272 --> 00:29:10,272
Patalsky this is a Black Dragon,

350
00:29:10,372 --> 00:29:11,872
The world's most expensive cigar.

351
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,870
And I promised myself that
When we kill this creature,

352
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,740
I'll get to that fire and smoke it.

353
00:29:19,413 --> 00:29:21,714
Really want to smoke
This cigar, Lieutenant.

354
00:29:24,857 --> 00:29:25,857
So tell me,

355
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:28,592
I have the opportunity to
Smoking my Black Dragon?

356
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:30,212
Yes, sir.

357
00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:32,048
Admiral.

358
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:33,517
This is Lieutenant Terry McCormack.

359
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:34,990
My expert on sharks.

360
00:29:35,164 --> 00:29:36,164
What?
No.

361
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:37,825
Oh, yeah, yeah.

362
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:39,471
Well, what are you?

363
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:41,048
I am an engineer water acoustics.

364
00:29:41,434 --> 00:29:42,534
Sharks are my obsession.

365
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:44,134
I have made groundbreaking discoveries ...

366
00:29:44,193 --> 00:29:45,893
A little more humility,
Lieutenant. I read your file.

367
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:47,053
I know who you are.

368
00:29:47,476 --> 00:29:48,976
You like to try
With noise levels,

369
00:29:49,076 --> 00:29:51,076
... To find out what
Can remove a shark.

370
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:53,541
Well, that's exactly
I want to do.

371
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:55,935
Yes, sir.

372
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:00,919
Welcome to my domain.

373
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:05,333
All seamen recruits
As a special agent for me ...

374
00:30:05,409 --> 00:30:06,409
We are all dedicated to ...

375
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:07,229
... Hunt,

376
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:08,009
... Find ...

377
00:30:08,132 --> 00:30:08,832
... And kill ...

378
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,158
... This Megalodon.

379
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:14,240
This is an elite and only
Guests of the club.

380
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:17,329
If you are on this ship,
Then it is your only goal.

381
00:30:17,756 --> 00:30:18,756
Understood?

382
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:19,817
Yes, sir.

383
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:21,235
So, why is
're On my ship?

384
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:23,607
To hunt, find and
Kill the Megalodon,

385
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,810
... Sir.

386
00:30:24,895 --> 00:30:25,895
Excellent.

387
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,639
Show him to Dr. McCormack
Its new premises.

388
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:29,309
Show them your new lab.

389
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,450
I want to see the defense of
Sharks in action.

390
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:34,427
May be useful in the future.

391
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:46,463
Special Agent Hutchinson,
Should return and investigate.

392
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:47,791
There was a new attack.

393
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,213
A cargo ship.

394
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:51,232
There are few survivors.

395
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:52,632
Yes, sir.

396
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:20,247
Boys, boys, come on.

397
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,253
Do not touch is very dirty.

398
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:23,183
Come on.

399
00:31:25,648 --> 00:31:26,848
What is your name, boy?

400
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:31,035
Get out of here.

401
00:31:33,094 --> 00:31:34,094
Damn kids.

402
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:54,756
Where is Lewis?

403
00:31:54,897 --> 00:31:56,897
You know where he is,
Should have jumped.

404
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,543
I never liked him.

405
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,050
That's why he jumped.

406
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:07,638
Where are you going?

407
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,010
I give up.

408
00:32:26,723 --> 00:32:27,723
Whiskey

409
00:32:28,316 --> 00:32:29,516
I want to pay, please?

410
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,416
With money.

411
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:33,603
What?

412
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:34,753
Money.

413
00:32:34,891 --> 00:32:36,491
Money.
Oh, money.

414
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:42,326
Money, money, money,
A lot of money.

415
00:32:47,247 --> 00:32:48,247
This is spoiled.

416
00:32:48,728 --> 00:32:50,728
- No - Yes
- No. Impossible.

417
00:32:55,368 --> 00:32:58,368
No, you only pay with cash,
With the money.

418
00:32:59,431 --> 00:33:01,731
Listen, a bottle of whiskey.

419
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:09,955
I think this whiskey
Will cost me a lot.

420
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:15,989
I'll take it.

421
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:33,078
The last time I met
Beautiful woman in a bar ...

422
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:36,075
It was not pretty.

423
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,458
Do not talk too much.

424
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,474
Children smelly education
Secondary are not my type.

425
00:33:40,578 --> 00:33:41,578
Lord Potnam.

426
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:42,664
How do you fire?

427
00:33:43,285 --> 00:33:45,685
Special Agent Hutchinson,
Secret Service.

428
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:46,833
Ooh, this is a good name.

429
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:49,647
How can I help it,
Special Agent?

430
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:50,738
Info.

431
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,792
You and a few survivors
Have a story to tell.

432
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:54,619
And I have to listen.

433
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:57,053
You know I'll never kill him.

434
00:33:57,665 --> 00:33:59,665
Even with all the
U.S. Army?

435
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
You've seen the
Skeleton of these things?

436
00:34:03,652 --> 00:34:05,152
These things have been done
To survive.

437
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:07,219
They survived more
That 400 million years.

438
00:34:08,874 --> 00:34:09,874
You know that these crocodiles ...

439
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:11,276
... Have the intelligence
A human being? Crocodiles?

440
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,009
Who are you
Speak of a crocodile?

441
00:34:14,765 --> 00:34:17,065
The creature that attacked your
Ship was a shark.

442
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,888
Honey, I know the difference between
A shark and a crocodile.

443
00:34:19,944 --> 00:34:21,944
Look, sharks have
Limitations in the sea,

444
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:23,998
... But crodilos, oh, no,
Thanks, I do not count.

445
00:34:25,214 --> 00:34:27,215
Sharks are fleshy
And permeable ...

446
00:34:27,913 --> 00:34:29,913
Where a crocodile is waterproof.

447
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:31,984
The crocodile found in the sea?

448
00:34:32,327 --> 00:34:33,827
No, I captured it in earth.

449
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:34,882
The most beautiful trophy
I've ever had.

450
00:34:34,988 --> 00:34:36,288
You gotta come with me.

451
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:40,905
Where do we go,
To your house?

452
00:34:42,553 --> 00:34:45,054
Otherwise I'm even here.
Thanks for the whiskey.

453
00:34:46,616 --> 00:34:50,116
This is not a request.
You will come by hook or by crook.

454
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,679
The choice is yours.

455
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:25,997
Great.

456
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,209
It is in the North Atlantic
Near Nassau.

457
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:30,841
Impossible.

458
00:35:30,926 --> 00:35:32,926
An hour ago she was
Southeast of Newfoundland.

459
00:35:33,641 --> 00:35:34,341
Enlarge.

460
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,341
It is faster than
We thought, sir.

461
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:40,093
This does not mean that
Is our shark.

462
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:43,308
What is that?

463
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,509
We have to play a game
Completely different.

464
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:11,758
Lord.

465
00:37:19,228 --> 00:37:20,228
McCor Doctor, oh ...

466
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,601
Lt. McCormack for sure?

467
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,170
Watch it now.

468
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:29,408
Please do not be fooled.

469
00:37:29,503 --> 00:37:31,503
Behind its scientific
Latest ...

470
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:34,614
Is a man with more
Speed ??than a lion.

471
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:36,352
In other words,

472
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:37,626
... His girlfriend ...

473
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:41,995
Has the best ass in
All the African jungle.

474
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,427
It is not true, Lieutenant?

475
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:45,395
In order to confront Potnam.

476
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,131
You're very quiet there.

477
00:37:48,939 --> 00:37:50,939
I wonder if your wife
Should know you better ...

478
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,261
... And leave you.

479
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:54,445
I told you keep quiet.

480
00:37:55,784 --> 00:37:57,084
The admiral needs your attention.

481
00:37:57,586 --> 00:37:59,586
Pretty cool man crocodile.

482
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,910
My name is Nigel Potnam, sir.

483
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,028
That design is so beautiful here.

484
00:38:04,474 --> 00:38:06,074
Patalsky.
Lord.

485
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,431
Shows you the crocodile man
Where the eggs are.

486
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:10,339
Yes, sir.

487
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:13,691
Around 18:34 we find
This picture that coast there ...

488
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:14,818
Those are crocodile eggs.

489
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:16,299
We believe that they are eggs.

490
00:38:16,883 --> 00:38:18,883
Sorry but some of Mr.
Sharks lay eggs ...

491
00:38:19,105 --> 00:38:21,205
We do not view
Where they come from.

492
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:24,568
Can be tube ... Are eggs
Crocodile, looks at how,

493
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:27,429
I think I've seen a few.

494
00:38:27,846 --> 00:38:29,846
Admiral, this man does not
Is who he says is:

495
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,557
Ok, he is a traitor
And a crook.

496
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:34,804
It allows the tribes in the jungle
Believe that there is a bogeyman.

497
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,160
And he delivered them out of your mind and
Demons for a small reward.

498
00:38:38,238 --> 00:38:39,938
It is better to throw him out of here.

499
00:38:40,463 --> 00:38:42,464
In my back pocket, sir.

500
00:38:46,264 --> 00:38:47,664
Oh, dear, you feel the orange.

501
00:38:48,921 --> 00:38:49,921
Nothing.

502
00:38:50,034 --> 00:38:52,034
Honey, deeper and
Tell me you love me.

503
00:38:52,638 --> 00:38:54,638
Or get me handcuffs
What I find.

504
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:15,153
Mr. this is a shell
Of a crocodile.

505
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:18,398
I had a bigger piece ...

506
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,640
Mr. this is the only piece
I have.

507
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,525
Take this to the laboratory
And test everything.

508
00:39:22,715 --> 00:39:24,215
Wait, we can not find
... A Megalodon

509
00:39:24,283 --> 00:39:25,583
... And a prehistoric crocodile.

510
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,320
We must do more analysis.

511
00:39:27,753 --> 00:39:28,753
More field work.

512
00:39:29,306 --> 00:39:31,306
And I want to bring me a
Egg that lady.

513
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,511
My pleasure, sir.

514
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:35,428
Admiral, we have technology
Echo,

515
00:39:35,566 --> 00:39:37,266
Do not need fisicalmente
To go near the eggs.

516
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:39,045
We have everything here
We need ...

517
00:39:39,103 --> 00:39:40,603
... For ...
He's right.

518
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:44,221
Why do not you stay here
Warm this ship ...

519
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:48,309
... And pray that your technology
Satellite solve this.

520
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:50,234
If you want to approach this monster.

521
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:51,976
If you want to meet you,

522
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:55,135
... Or more importantly,
If you want to die.

523
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,294
Really allow me to suggest that
I go get the eggs.

524
00:40:00,254 --> 00:40:01,554
Hutchinson, go with him.

525
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:02,833
You also, Lieutenant.

526
00:40:04,013 --> 00:40:04,713
I?

527
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:06,098
No, sir.
I have to test ...

528
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,204
Do you have hearing problems?
Because I do not think you heard me right.

529
00:40:08,258 --> 00:40:11,258
Have to go see if eggs are
Shark or crocodile.

530
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,952
This is not a request,
This is an order.

531
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:16,894
Yes, sir.

532
00:40:33,046 --> 00:40:35,546
I do not see why we both
Should be here to take the eggs.

533
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,016
This shark can be close to

534
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:39,171
And my machine is not yet
Is ready to chase him.

535
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:40,524
Incredible.

536
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:42,950
What?

537
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:46,012
You know what.
Has not changed a bit.

538
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:48,433
This is why you never
You were in Africa.

539
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:50,794
What you mean?
I was there in the middle.

540
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,690
I had to deal with
Diseases, famine, rebel ...

541
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,820
You had to deal with
Graphs, figures, maps,

542
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:56,876
... Import, export.

543
00:40:57,022 --> 00:41:00,023
Have you ever met a person
You should be that you help her?

544
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:01,362
I met a few, ok?

545
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:02,662
It was not my job.

546
00:41:02,786 --> 00:41:04,786
My job was to develop
Agricultural projects ...

547
00:41:04,902 --> 00:41:05,602
... For peace association.

548
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:07,124
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

549
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,468
The mean is now
You were in Africa?

550
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:14,477
Uh, no more fraternal
In me than you.

551
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:16,258
Really?
Seriously.

552
00:41:16,383 --> 00:41:19,583
What do you say have an experience of
Steal, murder and killing villagers.

553
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:21,868
And ignoring the dignity
And their pride.

554
00:41:21,967 --> 00:41:23,467
I do not know what had
Experienced in Africa.

555
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:24,698
Shut up, guys.

556
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,279
He just wants sex.

557
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:30,577
Seriously, Podman?
Yes.

558
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:34,988
Look, this is a simple task ...

559
00:41:35,194 --> 00:41:38,594
And you are complicating it,
And I hate complições.

560
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:40,809
We come,
We get an egg,

561
00:41:41,002 --> 00:41:42,602
And bring back everything.

562
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:43,795
Understood?

563
00:41:43,908 --> 00:41:46,308
Understood, but then it is better
Looks along the coast,

564
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,371
Because crocodiles like
For the eggs ...

565
00:41:48,434 --> 00:41:49,635
... Along the coast.

566
00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:51,578
Entnedido?

567
00:41:51,654 --> 00:41:53,154
How long does it take to be born?

568
00:41:54,204 --> 00:41:56,804
I do not know,
Normal crocodiles, five months,

569
00:41:57,006 --> 00:42:00,006
... These things?
I do not know.

570
00:42:00,678 --> 00:42:01,878
How do we know this?

571
00:42:01,983 --> 00:42:03,983
How do we know,
When they born?

572
00:42:04,127 --> 00:42:05,627
You'll see small crocodiles

573
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:09,290
Small crocodiles
7-9 meters.

574
00:42:09,922 --> 00:42:10,922
The people eat.

575
00:42:16,124 --> 00:42:17,124
Addition, as well.

576
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:52,258
Look at him,
Poor Terry.

577
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:54,850
A popular person he is.

578
00:42:54,998 --> 00:42:55,998
Always was.

579
00:42:56,595 --> 00:42:57,996
He always wanted to be number one.

580
00:42:59,198 --> 00:43:01,198
We ought to let him play
With its beautiful shark ...

581
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,328
... And let's find crocodiles.

582
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:03,699
What do you think?

583
00:43:04,446 --> 00:43:05,446
Special.

584
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:19,962
Here is the entrance.

585
00:43:59,392 --> 00:44:00,892
Look up the coordinates.

586
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:02,857
I do not know much
About crocodiles ...

587
00:44:03,091 --> 00:44:04,291
But usually know where
They lay their eggs ...

588
00:44:04,395 --> 00:44:05,395
... Near the water.

589
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:07,085
Oh, really?

590
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:09,339
In Africa she puts
Their eggs in a mine ...

591
00:44:10,377 --> 00:44:12,377
And when they expect
The water rises.

592
00:44:13,732 --> 00:44:15,032
Well, it could happen
Happens.

593
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:18,728
Unless ...

594
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,115
Unless you know the
They say.

595
00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:22,374
Unless it does not
Was no accident.

596
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,595
Unless ... They put us
In the water on purpose.

597
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,220
Can you lend me this?

598
00:44:46,613 --> 00:44:49,613
Wow, what's that?
It's crazy.

599
00:44:51,129 --> 00:44:52,129
Heat sensitive.

600
00:44:52,751 --> 00:44:53,751
Special.

601
00:44:58,175 --> 00:44:59,175
Oh, shit.

602
00:45:01,325 --> 00:45:02,325
What do you see?

603
00:45:03,093 --> 00:45:04,693
I see eggs, many eggs.

604
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:06,919
Scattered along the coast.

605
00:45:08,845 --> 00:45:09,845
Why?

606
00:45:12,093 --> 00:45:14,094
This is what crocodiles do,
Lay eggs.

607
00:45:14,742 --> 00:45:16,742
Hey, what do you hear me.

608
00:45:26,086 --> 00:45:28,086
Are winches.
No.

609
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:29,746
Yes, but it's not a bird.

610
00:45:30,558 --> 00:45:32,459
Either they were born,
Or are to be born.

611
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:33,590
Crocodiles chew?

612
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:35,133
Oh, yes.

613
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,350
Hey, guys.

614
00:45:38,326 --> 00:45:39,326
What is a flipper?

615
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:52,099
Where are you going?

616
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,541
What are you doing?

617
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,422
Coordinates Forward
To the Admiral,

618
00:45:59,552 --> 00:46:01,052
For we attack.

619
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:02,699
We have ten minutes
To get out of here.

620
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:04,392
Oh, no, forget it,
These are my eggs.

621
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:06,909
Your eggs, sorry?

622
00:46:06,968 --> 00:46:10,268
Sorry, my eggs,
My game, my expedition.

623
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,790
And all you're
Do is wrong.

624
00:46:13,362 --> 00:46:14,962
No Potnam,
You are you wrong!

625
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:17,366
This is a danger to
National security.

626
00:46:17,593 --> 00:46:19,093
This crocodile is not your trophy.

627
00:46:24,226 --> 00:46:27,226
Received a distress call
Special Agent Hutchinson.

628
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:28,718
Increases it.

629
00:46:29,605 --> 00:46:31,605
They found the eggs and
Sent us these coordinates.

630
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,360
Lord.

631
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:36,676
They ask for a missile attack.

632
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,020
Damn, Hutchinson,

633
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:45,239
You can go after your eggs but
You will not be able to reach them all.

634
00:46:45,354 --> 00:46:46,554
And where is the mother crocodile, ah?

635
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:51,419
You just with a crocodile
Behind everything and everyone ...

636
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,550
Guys, guys, guys,
The shark.

637
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:04,980
Jesus.

638
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:06,309
Sobe, seobe, rises.

639
00:47:10,729 --> 00:47:12,429
We have to leave,
We have two minutes.

640
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:15,963
They'll kill each other
Before his men arrived.

641
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:24,069
Course 1-4-0,
Target in sight of the command.

642
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:45,975
They failed the crocodile.

643
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:47,044
They have failed.

644
00:47:47,168 --> 00:47:48,168
You failed.

645
00:47:49,294 --> 00:47:50,794
That shark was straight
To your eggs ...

646
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:52,438
... And the crocodile was behind
It immediately.

647
00:47:52,895 --> 00:47:55,095
Your crocodile has a
Great maternal instinct.

648
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:56,175
It is not mine.

649
00:47:57,016 --> 00:47:58,016
At least not yet.

650
00:47:58,078 --> 00:48:00,078
Give it to me, which is owned
U.S. Army.

651
00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:03,014
In fact, it is my
Personal property.

652
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,181
And if you do not have them.
Crackshop lady,

653
00:48:05,695 --> 00:48:07,195
... None.

654
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:08,794
Yes, but we need the eggs.

655
00:48:09,311 --> 00:48:10,311
Yes, but not all.

656
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:13,358
They are removed
Over the entire area.

657
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:14,121
Hutchinson.

658
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:15,792
I'm going to put another team.

659
00:48:15,875 --> 00:48:17,575
Oh, no, you're not going nowhere.
You need to focus on you ...

660
00:48:17,683 --> 00:48:19,983
... Bothered by a crocodile
46 meters in length ...

661
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,631
... That goes along the coast.

662
00:48:21,748 --> 00:48:23,748
Yes, and a Megalodon
Starved to haunt him.

663
00:48:24,106 --> 00:48:26,106
You have to warn all
East Coast, Hutchinson.

664
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,100
We sent photos of
Cameras outdoors.

665
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:33,285
We have to immediately alert
Along the Atlantic coast.

666
00:48:33,426 --> 00:48:35,026
The National Guard
Is the command.

667
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:58,091
There she is.

668
00:49:01,262 --> 00:49:02,262
Yes, it goes to Miami.

669
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:04,549
Where ... where's the shark?

670
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,580
He was seen in the Atlantic.

671
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:09,191
There is another ship
Leading the attack.

672
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,601
USS RELIANT
ATLANTIC OCEAN

673
00:49:16,143 --> 00:49:17,343
The torpedo is ready.

674
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:19,805
In my brand.

675
00:49:20,306 --> 00:49:21,506
We have only one
Torpedo tube.

676
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:23,362
Well, I hope not to fail.

677
00:49:25,147 --> 00:49:26,347
And Fire!

678
00:49:27,514 --> 00:49:28,714
The torpedo was launched.

679
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,330
We have been successful.

680
00:49:36,148 --> 00:49:37,448
You should see this.

681
00:49:37,786 --> 00:49:38,786
What?

682
00:50:07,949 --> 00:50:08,949
Concentrate, folks.

683
00:50:09,435 --> 00:50:10,835
We have not seen anything.

684
00:50:11,324 --> 00:50:12,324
Now where is the crocodile?

685
00:50:12,529 --> 00:50:13,729
You get in Miami, sir.

686
00:50:14,564 --> 00:50:15,564
We signed him well?

687
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:17,888
Negative, dense population.

688
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:20,446
Only two percent
Of the survivors.

689
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:21,892
Try to find a detour.

690
00:50:21,976 --> 00:50:23,976
Give me 15% chance,
And then shoot.

691
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:25,122
I'm in it.

692
00:50:33,177 --> 00:50:35,077
We must find a way
To get her back home.

693
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:37,147
Do you think, Terry, thinks.

694
00:50:37,225 --> 00:50:38,225
Yes, why do not you think?

695
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,270
Why do not you think GI Joe,
As you will take a Crocodile ...

696
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:43,522
46 meters in length
Back to the sea.

697
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:51,625
This is incredible,

698
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:53,819
... Something I thought
We never were going to see.

699
00:50:53,911 --> 00:50:55,512
Look at the size of the creature.

700
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:07,892
A bright arc.

701
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:10,651
I'm sorry?

702
00:51:10,782 --> 00:51:11,783
Yes, yes, a bright arc.

703
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:13,451
From 1000 amperes or more,

704
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:15,147
... Can create sufficient
Electricity ...

705
00:51:15,301 --> 00:51:17,801
... At least to reduce
The crocodile, or stop it.

706
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:19,412
Has to be a light
Very bright.

707
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:22,155
The nuclear power plant in Turkey

708
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:23,609
... Is about 25 km from here.

709
00:51:23,711 --> 00:51:25,711
Look, we can ...
What can we do?

710
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:29,086
Surround a nuclear power plant, you will have
Dozens of guides, right?

711
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,086
Then caught a high power,

712
00:51:31,362 --> 00:51:32,862
... Conectas with a
Achievement of the objects,

713
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,891
And you can create and establish
A bright bow.

714
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:42,061
Create a bright arc
With a nuclear reactor?

715
00:51:43,285 --> 00:51:44,285
Yes.

716
00:51:44,437 --> 00:51:45,738
I'll call the Admiral.
All right.

717
00:51:58,922 --> 00:52:00,922
Call Commander
Base Miramar.

718
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:04,031
We have to drain the central
Nuclear Turkey, now!

719
00:52:05,598 --> 00:52:07,598
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN TURKEY

720
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:13,158
Central Turkey.

721
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:14,685
This is the USS Lexington.

722
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:17,533
I need a bow
Bright immediately.

723
00:52:17,727 --> 00:52:19,328
Lord, I do not think
We can do this.

724
00:52:19,393 --> 00:52:21,793
This is an order of
Chief of the Navy!

725
00:52:22,325 --> 00:52:23,025
Do it!

726
00:52:23,152 --> 00:52:24,152
Yes, sir.

727
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:35,617
Lord.

728
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,311
The Lexington contacted us,

729
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:39,049
And a necessary arc
Bright immediately.

730
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:40,292
A bright arc?

731
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:42,722
Call the Chief of Engineers
Which imforme five.

732
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:43,989
Yes, sir.

733
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:48,551
Call auxiliary 1, which
Prepare for a bright bow.

734
00:52:50,161 --> 00:52:52,461
Are you talking seriously?
Yes, you do so.

735
00:52:54,116 --> 00:52:57,516
Notify auxiliary 2.
The bright bow my order.

736
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:00,759
Lexington, in central Turkey.

737
00:53:01,371 --> 00:53:04,371
Here speaks the Lieutenant J.J. Patalsky
Of the USS Lexington.

738
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:07,801
I need a bright arc that
Hit Orlando, immediately.

739
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:12,819
We will do our best.

740
00:53:15,095 --> 00:53:16,695
When I say, folks.
Orlando

741
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,355
The conduct of Turkey
Are ready, sir.

742
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:39,779
Are They point to
The critura now.

743
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,384
Five seconds to shoot.

744
00:53:42,192 --> 00:53:44,192
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN TURKEY

745
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:46,010
Three,

746
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:48,807
... Two,

747
00:53:53,532 --> 00:53:55,532
... A.

748
00:54:08,481 --> 00:54:09,481
Again,

749
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:11,101
Tell them to shoot again.

750
00:54:11,224 --> 00:54:12,224
Ay, Ay.

751
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,800
She turns.

752
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:36,048
Is there any clue to the Megalodon.

753
00:54:38,197 --> 00:54:39,197
Patalsky.

754
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,080
Red indicates the crocodile,
Green indicates the shark.

755
00:54:44,233 --> 00:54:45,833
He remains in the Atlantic.

756
00:54:46,154 --> 00:54:48,854
Deep water, warm water.

757
00:54:49,511 --> 00:54:51,011
It seems that the shark is swimming ...

758
00:54:51,139 --> 00:54:52,940
Strong parallel magnetic fields.

759
00:54:53,025 --> 00:54:54,525
That he uses to steer.

760
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:01,241
Do not look at me.

761
00:55:01,563 --> 00:55:03,063
The Hutchinson wanted to save it.

762
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:05,547
I do not know where the crocodile.

763
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:07,873
But what I know!

764
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,491
You've got to find the eggs
Found that their men.

765
00:55:11,674 --> 00:55:13,674
For if we have
A to dissect,

766
00:55:13,868 --> 00:55:17,868
Maybe we could find
Its weakness.

767
00:55:18,032 --> 00:55:19,032
They are already under way.

768
00:55:19,697 --> 00:55:20,997
Two aboard the Invincible

769
00:55:21,082 --> 00:55:22,382
Two suspended from
A pair of Black Hawks.

770
00:55:23,267 --> 00:55:25,267
They should get here
Within 30 minutes.

771
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,315
Well, maybe this is
A good coincidence.

772
00:55:28,407 --> 00:55:29,407
Lord.

773
00:56:07,808 --> 00:56:08,808
What is that?

774
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,560
Came from inside the egg?

775
00:56:27,525 --> 00:56:28,525
Captain!

776
00:56:57,635 --> 00:56:58,635
Come on, Terry.

777
00:56:59,873 --> 00:57:01,873
It is not good.
Rays.

778
00:57:02,666 --> 00:57:03,666
Not even going to ask?

779
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,450
If refers to their eggs.
So, no.

780
00:57:06,855 --> 00:57:08,656
They were devoured
With the Megalodon.

781
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:09,761
What you know?

782
00:57:11,453 --> 00:57:14,453
They are an ace, as the
My balls hydro sonic.

783
00:57:15,423 --> 00:57:16,623
They attract sharks.

784
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:18,870
Glad you do not have
Eggs on board this ship.

785
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,020
Otherwise, we would target.

786
00:57:21,553 --> 00:57:23,553
So, I mean if we find the eggs
'll Also find the shark?

787
00:57:23,605 --> 00:57:25,406
Mean that we will find both.

788
00:57:25,741 --> 00:57:27,541
We find a
Very protective mother ...

789
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,170
... And a very aggressive predator.

790
00:57:32,511 --> 00:57:33,511
Good try.

791
00:57:33,777 --> 00:57:35,777
But where do you think
Will trigger it?

792
00:57:36,297 --> 00:57:38,297
We do not have a cage or
A tank large enough.

793
00:57:38,362 --> 00:57:39,962
This is true, we
Does not have a cage.

794
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:41,519
But we got it.

795
00:57:42,315 --> 00:57:43,416
The Panama Canal?

796
00:57:43,561 --> 00:57:44,761
Admiral deck!

797
00:57:47,607 --> 00:57:50,007
This is a bad idea
This is crazy.

798
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:52,079
Is very dangerous ...

799
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:53,631
... And is very close to the population.

800
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:55,566
Anything can happen ...

801
00:57:55,623 --> 00:57:57,623
If anything can happen,
Has happened, Terry.

802
00:58:00,104 --> 00:58:01,104
This can work.

803
00:58:01,641 --> 00:58:02,941
Just take the risk.

804
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:04,839
What is the risk?

805
00:58:07,071 --> 00:58:09,071
Mr. the Panama Canal
Has three borders,

806
00:58:09,722 --> 00:58:12,122
We attract the monster and its
Eggs to the border.

807
00:58:13,736 --> 00:58:15,736
Bingo, and gets stuck.

808
00:58:16,529 --> 00:58:18,129
So we started a
Devastating attack.

809
00:58:18,247 --> 00:58:19,747
Tear them to pieces.

810
00:58:19,773 --> 00:58:20,773
Admiral, Admiral,

811
00:58:20,882 --> 00:58:22,882
... Live more than a million
People on the canal.

812
00:58:23,821 --> 00:58:26,821
This is crazy, put
People's lives at risk,

813
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,437
... And we do not even have eggs.

814
00:58:28,947 --> 00:58:31,947
Then I suggest you bring with you
Your hydro sonic spheres.

815
00:58:35,403 --> 00:58:36,603
Almirante, where you go?

816
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:39,396
Well, someone has to
Tell the president ...

817
00:58:39,531 --> 00:58:40,596
... We blow it up
In international waters.

818
00:58:42,825 --> 00:58:44,996
Explaining that only God
Knows the danger.

819
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:47,811
And discover how to kill
These damned.

820
00:58:53,692 --> 00:58:55,092
I hope you're right.

821
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:02,507
I need to ask
One thing, Terry?

822
00:59:04,543 --> 00:59:06,543
You do not even know if your
Tomatoes will work here?

823
00:59:08,703 --> 00:59:10,403
Look, I have concentrated
To frighten the shark ...

824
00:59:10,507 --> 00:59:12,107
... With my balls
Hydro sonic.

825
00:59:12,218 --> 00:59:14,418
And now the Admiral
Wants to hang.

826
00:59:14,553 --> 00:59:15,553
He wants it distracts.

827
00:59:15,633 --> 00:59:16,633
I do not have any calculations ...

828
00:59:16,706 --> 00:59:17,306
... Or diagrams ...

829
00:59:17,418 --> 00:59:18,818
... Or anything for that.
Look ...

830
00:59:20,756 --> 00:59:22,756
I think I know where we can
Find out more ...

831
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:24,774
... More eggs.

832
00:59:27,514 --> 00:59:30,514
Should tell the Admiral to
To send a rescue team ...

833
00:59:31,023 --> 00:59:33,523
... To meet me,
In these coordinates.

834
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:37,945
Where the hell is this?

835
00:59:38,595 --> 00:59:40,095
This is where sank my ship.

836
00:59:40,801 --> 00:59:42,302
I think there's eggs.

837
00:59:43,557 --> 00:59:45,557
And because this information kept?

838
00:59:47,069 --> 00:59:49,069
You wanted to get them
Later, is not it?

839
00:59:50,464 --> 00:59:51,564
I am the crocodile man.

840
00:59:53,936 --> 00:59:55,536
At least not very far.

841
00:59:58,173 --> 01:00:00,674
Near Aruba,
In the Caribbean Sea.

842
01:00:01,091 --> 01:00:02,691
I see what is
Is available in the area.

843
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,308
Might get lucky
And there is someone nearby.

844
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:12,775
Lord.

845
01:00:15,284 --> 01:00:17,285
We have new orders
Of the USS Lexington.

846
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:20,982
Well, swallowed the radius
Of their language, officer?

847
01:00:21,582 --> 01:00:23,982
No, sir.
Seems to go fishing.

848
01:00:27,143 --> 01:00:28,543
What the hell does that mean?

849
01:00:31,868 --> 01:00:33,369
Have you found my eggs?

850
01:00:33,953 --> 01:00:34,753
No.

851
01:00:34,867 --> 01:00:37,067
They sent now
Divers by your eggs.

852
01:00:37,862 --> 01:00:39,262
Good, then we can return.

853
01:00:40,033 --> 01:00:41,533
Eggs are sufficient
To attract the creatures,

854
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,600
So I do not know if I can change
Codes of my balls.

855
01:00:51,929 --> 01:00:53,929
Are now 100 meters.

856
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:55,770
110.

857
01:00:56,809 --> 01:00:57,809
120.

858
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,490
Quiet and stable, Lieutenant.

859
01:01:00,133 --> 01:01:02,133
We do not want it to collide
As a ping pong ball.

860
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:03,619
Lord, 125.

861
01:01:07,674 --> 01:01:08,674
130.

862
01:01:09,204 --> 01:01:10,204
Lord we are
Close to the wall.

863
01:01:10,275 --> 01:01:11,275
And reverse traction.

864
01:01:11,384 --> 01:01:12,584
Mr. we will not succeed.

865
01:01:12,726 --> 01:01:13,726
Twist, with all his might.

866
01:01:13,867 --> 01:01:15,467
This is not sufficient, Sr.
Brace yourself for impact.

867
01:01:20,364 --> 01:01:21,364
Report of Injury.

868
01:01:21,872 --> 01:01:23,372
3:05 The gloves are damaged, Mr.

869
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,514
They are taking water rapidly.

870
01:01:25,074 --> 01:01:27,074
Close from the chambers
3 to 5.

871
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:29,075
Yes, sir, but we are
Remove the water quickly.

872
01:01:29,192 --> 01:01:30,492
I strongly recommend to go back.

873
01:01:30,565 --> 01:01:33,265
Keep the course of 0-1-0.

874
01:01:33,346 --> 01:01:35,046
Mr. strongly recommend to ...
Lieutenant!

875
01:01:37,145 --> 01:01:38,145
Affirmative.

876
01:01:39,103 --> 01:01:40,103
135.

877
01:01:41,554 --> 01:01:42,554
140.

878
01:01:42,606 --> 01:01:43,606
Engines back quarter.

879
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:46,636
145.

880
01:01:46,777 --> 01:01:47,777
Distance from target?

881
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:48,871
Five meters, sir.

882
01:01:49,426 --> 01:01:50,026
Four.

883
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:51,091
Turn off the engines.

884
01:01:52,243 --> 01:01:52,943
Three.

885
01:01:53,707 --> 01:01:54,307
Two.

886
01:01:56,277 --> 01:01:57,678
A.
Depth achieved.

887
01:01:59,919 --> 01:02:01,919
Order this is Argonaut.
Depth achieved.

888
01:02:02,435 --> 01:02:03,435
We are waiting for instructions.

889
01:02:03,491 --> 01:02:05,091
Let's see what we have here.

890
01:02:07,963 --> 01:02:09,463
Hold on, let's land.

891
01:02:09,555 --> 01:02:10,655
Listen, this is a mistake.

892
01:02:10,745 --> 01:02:11,845
Those creatures will
Dive into the water ...

893
01:02:12,063 --> 01:02:13,363
... And the pumps will fail
Completely.

894
01:02:13,436 --> 01:02:14,436
We can never
Catch them in the channel.

895
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:16,569
Sharks will sink
To stop moving.

896
01:02:16,771 --> 01:02:18,771
And if a tank aguentarmos,
Will block the channel ...

897
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:20,175
... We do not need
Bombard them.

898
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,578
I know I'm not ready.

899
01:02:23,165 --> 01:02:25,165
I hope that it found
My crocodile.

900
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:34,622
Eggs?

901
01:02:35,423 --> 01:02:36,623
Are three feet tall?

902
01:02:37,781 --> 01:02:38,781
Roger that, sir.

903
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:43,345
Ok, send the rescue team.

904
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:44,969
We'll get the samples,

905
01:02:45,031 --> 01:02:46,031
... And let's get outta here.

906
01:02:46,601 --> 01:02:47,601
Yes, sir.

907
01:02:47,742 --> 01:02:48,743
Order this is Argonaut.

908
01:02:49,148 --> 01:02:50,148
Trying to recover ...

909
01:02:51,088 --> 01:02:52,088
Over and out.

910
01:02:53,034 --> 01:02:54,734
They prepare
Transfer immediately.

911
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:01,639
Panama Canal

912
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:26,761
Here she comes.

913
01:03:27,881 --> 01:03:28,881
Is a crocodile.

914
01:03:29,604 --> 01:03:31,304
We have to put him in the water.

915
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,136
Lower it.

916
01:03:37,257 --> 01:03:38,257
I can make this work.

917
01:03:38,386 --> 01:03:39,686
This is not important,
We have the egg.

918
01:03:39,753 --> 01:03:40,453
Definitely the creature will come.

919
01:03:40,603 --> 01:03:41,303
You do not know that, ok.

920
01:03:41,394 --> 01:03:43,394
Give me one second we
For it in the water ...

921
01:03:43,495 --> 01:03:44,195
... And all is well.

922
01:03:44,301 --> 01:03:47,001
Once the water from the egg
Creatures will come, it is instinct, right?

923
01:03:47,213 --> 01:03:49,413
Yes, yes, maternal instinct,
Self-preservation, I think.

924
01:03:49,895 --> 01:03:51,395
When they get here,
We go away.

925
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:54,128
Let and catches them
All this bombing.

926
01:03:54,792 --> 01:03:55,792
Roger that!

927
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:01,799
Lord.

928
01:04:02,496 --> 01:04:04,496
The crocodile is about two
Minutes to enter the zone,

929
01:04:04,698 --> 01:04:05,898
And even the shark,
Is even closer.

930
01:04:06,041 --> 01:04:07,541
Evacuate all personnel from area,

931
01:04:07,673 --> 01:04:09,173
This is an emergency.

932
01:04:09,305 --> 01:04:10,905
Evacuate all personnel ...

933
01:04:11,004 --> 01:04:12,504
This is an emergency.
Yes, sir.

934
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,434
Prepare everything McCormack
We have to get up now.

935
01:04:21,822 --> 01:04:22,822
I said raise, rays.

936
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:24,581
We have to evacuate.

937
01:04:26,376 --> 01:04:28,076
The Megalodon is
Three miles away.

938
01:04:28,399 --> 01:04:29,399
Let's rays.

939
01:04:41,866 --> 01:04:43,366
3-0-9 Contact.

940
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:45,699
Contact 3-0-9, Ay.

941
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:47,166
Prepare weapons.

942
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:48,020
Prepare weapons, Ay.

943
01:04:48,148 --> 01:04:49,148
Fire ace my orders.

944
01:05:19,813 --> 01:05:21,013
Your not bombs
Are working.

945
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,100
I drew it to the channel
And let out the water.

946
01:05:24,202 --> 01:05:26,002
What they are doing
Is the bug you anymore.

947
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:41,631
Tango, Bravo 1,
I'll fall to 1-4-0.

948
01:05:42,812 --> 01:05:44,812
Oh, my God,
He'll pick me up.

949
01:05:52,553 --> 01:05:54,553
I think the shark will
Right the first border.

950
01:05:55,683 --> 01:05:56,684
Where is the crocodile?

951
01:05:57,458 --> 01:05:59,458
Block out about 1 km.

952
01:06:17,731 --> 01:06:18,731
It is the first frontier.

953
01:06:19,694 --> 01:06:20,694
It goes straight to the crocodile.

954
01:06:21,879 --> 01:06:24,479
Mr. The Megalodon entered
At the first border.

955
01:06:41,391 --> 01:06:42,391
You got the green light.

956
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,450
Heat guns,
All systems go.

957
01:07:16,062 --> 01:07:17,562
Seems to have dried your channel.

958
01:07:18,727 --> 01:07:19,727
Oh, shit.

959
01:07:45,507 --> 01:07:46,507
Why is that
Bombs did not kill them?

960
01:07:47,091 --> 01:07:48,891
For the same reason, can not
Trigger most crocodiles.

961
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:50,210
Their skin is so strong
As concrete.

962
01:07:51,062 --> 01:07:53,062
You have to have more power
Necessary to overthrow the mother.

963
01:07:53,117 --> 01:07:54,617
Yeah, but people
Kill crocodiles?

964
01:07:54,714 --> 01:07:56,715
Course, most crocodiles
Have a weak spot behind ...

965
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:57,782
... The eyes and behind the head.

966
01:07:58,845 --> 01:08:00,145
But this is not the
Most of the crocodiles.

967
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:06,313
They control the Panama

968
01:08:06,685 --> 01:08:07,685
They destroyed everything.

969
01:08:08,093 --> 01:08:09,093
We can not stop.

970
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:11,432
You must be over them.

971
01:08:12,006 --> 01:08:13,106
We can not let them go.

972
01:08:55,972 --> 01:08:57,472
You are competing for the eggs, man.

973
01:08:58,581 --> 01:08:59,381
Hutchinson,

974
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:00,893
... Want to talk to the admiral, now!

975
01:09:03,502 --> 01:09:04,502
Let me see if I understand this.

976
01:09:05,637 --> 01:09:07,137
Are you trying to tell me
All these ...

977
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:09,062
... Purple spots here

978
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:11,940
Where the shark and the crocodile
Detected together

979
01:09:12,137 --> 01:09:13,137
... These are the moments ...

980
01:09:13,275 --> 01:09:15,775
These are the times when the
Shark was behind the eggs,

981
01:09:15,905 --> 01:09:17,905
That can only mean
That she put the eggs ...

982
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:19,439
... In all these places.

983
01:09:19,903 --> 01:09:20,904
Impossible.

984
01:09:21,044 --> 01:09:22,644
Pos How many eggs
In rapid succession.

985
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,640
We have heard about
Play very fast but

986
01:09:25,848 --> 01:09:27,648
... Even the flies
Produce so fast.

987
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:29,793
It probably has inside ...

988
01:09:30,312 --> 01:09:32,812
... An evolved adaptation
Allow to produce more ...

989
01:09:32,873 --> 01:09:34,873
Rapidly when
Children are at risk.

990
01:09:35,059 --> 01:09:36,959
This means that it
Possible hundred eggs.

991
01:09:37,056 --> 01:09:39,056
<i>The battle  likely ... </ i></i>

992
01:09:39,181 --> 01:09:41,681
Eggs of most, if not
Are now all destroyed.

993
01:09:41,984 --> 01:09:42,984
And if not?

994
01:09:43,661 --> 01:09:45,661
God help us when
They start to rise.

995
01:09:46,346 --> 01:09:47,346
I see eggs here, sir.

996
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,560
They are off the coast.

997
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:51,910
How many?

998
01:09:52,718 --> 01:09:54,719
Hundreds, perhaps thousands.

999
01:10:04,772 --> 01:10:05,772
There is movement, sir.

1000
01:10:07,692 --> 01:10:08,692
My God!

1001
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:11,591
I think they are born.

1002
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:14,926
Hutchinson.

1003
01:10:16,147 --> 01:10:17,847
Answer, Hutchinson.

1004
01:10:18,503 --> 01:10:20,503
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

1005
01:10:27,422 --> 01:10:30,423
Mr. We have received reports
Small crocodiles ...

1006
01:10:30,537 --> 01:10:32,037
... They are attacking
Port of Santa Monica.
1007 ??

1007
01:10:32,581 --> 01:10:34,581
Lord, the USS CARTER
Wants to know what to do.

1008
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:36,079
Carter?

1009
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,349
Is a nuclear submarine.

1010
01:10:39,358 --> 01:10:41,358
He followed the creature
Through the North Pacific.

1011
01:10:41,764 --> 01:10:44,064
They go to a direitinhos
Seismically active area.

1012
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,949
They will not be able to pursue
Creature when you get there.

1013
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:48,897
The shark is going direitnho
To Hawaii.

1014
01:10:50,857 --> 01:10:51,857
You would do this?

1015
01:10:52,408 --> 01:10:54,408
I think the Megalodon
Found more eggs.

1016
01:10:56,779 --> 01:10:59,279
He can go to Hawaii, walking,
Swimming or water skiing.

1017
01:10:59,409 --> 01:11:01,709
We will bombard these
Bastards out of the water.

1018
01:11:15,408 --> 01:11:17,008
Lord come into
Sonar contact,

1019
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:19,162
... Direction 2-4-7 degrees.

1020
01:11:19,443 --> 01:11:20,743
2-4-7 degrees, Ay.

1021
01:11:20,987 --> 01:11:21,987
Shoot the target.

1022
01:11:22,059 --> 01:11:23,359
Shoot the target, Ay.

1023
01:11:32,326 --> 01:11:33,726
They have to stop.
What?

1024
01:11:34,072 --> 01:11:35,772
They fire nuclear weapons,
And if they fail?

1025
01:11:36,512 --> 01:11:37,012
And if he fail?

1026
01:11:37,103 --> 01:11:38,603
And hit something volcanic?

1027
01:11:38,872 --> 01:11:40,672
Then all of Hawaii will be destroyed.

1028
01:11:41,537 --> 01:11:42,937
I want a report
Damage the target.

1029
01:11:43,019 --> 01:11:44,419
Report damage to the target, Ay.

1030
01:11:47,168 --> 01:11:48,168
The target disappeared, sir.

1031
01:11:48,825 --> 01:11:50,125
What the hell is he doing?

1032
01:12:01,058 --> 01:12:02,358
Tell them to shut down the engines.

1033
01:12:02,542 --> 01:12:03,242
What?

1034
01:12:03,842 --> 01:12:05,842
Sharks are attracted
By electrical activity,

1035
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:06,909
This is what he is chasing.

1036
01:12:06,983 --> 01:12:09,383
If you tell them to shut down
Engines and keep quiet,

1037
01:12:09,795 --> 01:12:10,796
... Maybe he misses them.

1038
01:12:11,182 --> 01:12:13,582
Look, there are a lot of activity
Volcanism in the area ...

1039
01:12:13,661 --> 01:12:15,661
Which is creating a hole
Tram that ...

1040
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:18,061
Tell them to shut down the engines.

1041
01:12:18,861 --> 01:12:19,661
Affirmative.

1042
01:12:19,938 --> 01:12:21,538
Engine room,
Deliguem engines.

1043
01:12:49,955 --> 01:12:50,755
We have the target back.

1044
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:52,565
Direction 0-6-2 degrees.

1045
01:12:52,712 --> 01:12:54,012
All engines
All the steam.

1046
01:12:54,397 --> 01:12:55,897
All engines
In full swing, Ay.

1047
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:03,540
Nothing?

1048
01:13:04,407 --> 01:13:05,907
Lost all
Our communications.

1049
01:13:06,663 --> 01:13:08,663
I still get on target
Inside the submarine, but ...

1050
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:11,790
Try to ping to see
Footprint that can decipher.

1051
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:13,650
What the hell is happening?

1052
01:13:14,213 --> 01:13:15,713
The submarine?
The Shark?

1053
01:13:16,076 --> 01:13:18,477
I think, I think they are both.

1054
01:13:22,341 --> 01:13:23,641
I think it's the shark ...

1055
01:13:25,495 --> 01:13:26,895
Became nuclear.

1056
01:13:31,454 --> 01:13:32,654
Ok, if it looks clear.

1057
01:13:33,207 --> 01:13:34,007
Projections?

1058
01:13:34,465 --> 01:13:36,266
2 to 1.1 degrees north,

1059
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:38,413
1-5-7.8 degrees west,

1060
01:13:39,192 --> 01:13:40,892
... Going to the southern
Oahoe the Pacific.

1061
01:13:41,406 --> 01:13:43,206
We must remove him to
From the coast.

1062
01:13:43,405 --> 01:13:45,105
That shark swallowed
A nuclear submarine.

1063
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,815
We have to take that thing
To the middle of the ocean.

1064
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:47,940
And destroy it.

1065
01:13:48,744 --> 01:13:50,244
And how do you think we
Can make it without eggs?

1066
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:52,460
And what on earth do you know?

1067
01:13:53,182 --> 01:13:54,582
There may be new to Hawaii.

1068
01:13:54,676 --> 01:13:57,376
Otherwise, I have to emulate
The sound with my equipment.

1069
01:13:57,576 --> 01:13:58,576
Oh, your equipment?

1070
01:13:58,724 --> 01:14:00,324
This worked very
And the last time.

1071
01:14:00,455 --> 01:14:01,955
Listen, your pirate fake.

1072
01:14:02,014 --> 01:14:03,614
You better ideas ... A little
More humility, Lieutenant.

1073
01:14:05,284 --> 01:14:06,284
We follow your advice.

1074
01:14:10,297 --> 01:14:11,797
Come on, come on, come on.

1075
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,980
We have the first reports
This crocodile to be born in Hawaii.

1076
01:14:58,024 --> 01:14:59,524
Seems to have been born
Of the eggs here.

1077
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:02,800
Wow.

1078
01:15:03,557 --> 01:15:04,557
Look at that.

1079
01:15:09,533 --> 01:15:11,133
Something drew them here.

1080
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:13,670
They come from everywhere.

1081
01:15:13,844 --> 01:15:15,244
Affirmative, USS Lexington.

1082
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:16,516
How is the new mission?

1083
01:15:16,699 --> 01:15:19,100
Negative, have not yet found
No eggs ...

1084
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:20,297
... Just empty shells.

1085
01:15:21,552 --> 01:15:22,652
Sends a squad to the air.

1086
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:23,709
Yes, sir.

1087
01:15:24,293 --> 01:15:25,293
What did you say?

1088
01:15:26,268 --> 01:15:27,268
No eggs.

1089
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:32,870
Wait a minute.

1090
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:48,980
We need the helicopter.

1091
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,350
Come on, we
Exit the helicopter.

1092
01:15:50,403 --> 01:15:51,704
She's still alive,
She is alive.

1093
01:15:52,173 --> 01:15:53,173
Leave it where it is.

1094
01:15:53,427 --> 01:15:54,427
Let's get out of the helicopter.

1095
01:15:54,529 --> 01:15:55,229
It is here,
Stay here.

1096
01:15:55,339 --> 01:15:56,139
Let's call the helicopter.

1097
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:57,039
We'll ask for help.

1098
01:15:57,159 --> 01:15:58,159
No.
Join the army.

1099
01:15:58,569 --> 01:16:00,569
Let us help you.
Let us help you.

1100
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:01,920
We have to help her.

1101
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,260
Leave it here.

1102
01:16:03,328 --> 01:16:04,528
I will not leave here
My bride.

1103
01:16:04,617 --> 01:16:05,417
I'm not doing that.

1104
01:16:08,532 --> 01:16:10,532
Look at me, Terry.
It is not your girlfriend, okay.

1105
01:16:10,956 --> 01:16:12,256
Listen. She is the best thing
That ever happened to me.

1106
01:16:12,343 --> 01:16:13,643
Listen. She is the best thing
That ever happened to me.

1107
01:16:13,793 --> 01:16:15,293
Terry, this is not your girlfriend.

1108
01:16:15,354 --> 01:16:16,154
Listen.

1109
01:16:16,303 --> 01:16:17,303
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

1110
01:16:17,644 --> 01:16:18,944
I can not bring it back.

1111
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:21,150
But we can
Kill this monster.

1112
01:16:21,943 --> 01:16:22,943
You and me.

1113
01:16:24,386 --> 01:16:25,387
Are you with me?

1114
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:27,350
Are you with me?

1115
01:16:29,058 --> 01:16:30,058
Let.

1116
01:16:53,517 --> 01:16:55,017
The way you cry
Must be for,

1117
01:16:55,103 --> 01:16:56,103
... To help her.

1118
01:16:56,552 --> 01:16:57,952
That's why everyone comes here.

1119
01:16:59,452 --> 01:17:00,752
Is the same as
A mother crocodile ...

1120
01:17:00,877 --> 01:17:01,877
... Responds to the child.

1121
01:17:04,559 --> 01:17:06,759
Your answer to their
Screams of pain is incredible.

1122
01:18:16,034 --> 01:18:17,734
No, no, no.

1123
01:18:18,076 --> 01:18:19,676
They have to stop
Bombard the coast.

1124
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:22,010
Has a nuclear submarine inside.

1125
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:23,732
Is an atomic bomb, now.

1126
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:43,990
What are you doing?

1127
01:18:44,089 --> 01:18:45,089
We'll munch
With the volcano.

1128
01:18:45,468 --> 01:18:46,468
Oh, yeah, what?

1129
01:18:46,616 --> 01:18:47,416
With this.

1130
01:18:47,604 --> 01:18:49,304
I find the frequency
Correct and lure him.

1131
01:18:49,445 --> 01:18:51,945
And while we
To create a big explosion ...

1132
01:18:52,016 --> 01:18:53,216
And we'll kill you tenfold.

1133
01:18:53,327 --> 01:18:54,827
We attract them to put both.

1134
01:18:54,942 --> 01:18:55,942
Is the end game.
Oh, yes.

1135
01:18:56,713 --> 01:18:58,313
You have not even
You got to do it.

1136
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:01,101
What? Given all of a sudden
Divine inspiration?

1137
01:19:01,296 --> 01:19:03,296
You talked to me about
Lying to African ...

1138
01:19:03,346 --> 01:19:05,346
... To rescue them from monsters
And ghosts.

1139
01:19:05,668 --> 01:19:06,868
But look at you, man.

1140
01:19:07,509 --> 01:19:08,509
You have delusions.

1141
01:19:09,572 --> 01:19:10,772
But I can try, ok.

1142
01:19:11,338 --> 01:19:13,338
And I will not stop until we die.

1143
01:19:14,309 --> 01:19:15,309
But who am I?

1144
01:19:21,969 --> 01:19:22,769
Lord.

1145
01:19:23,769 --> 01:19:24,769
We lost Hutchinson.

1146
01:19:25,477 --> 01:19:26,277
Survivors?

1147
01:19:33,054 --> 01:19:34,054
Victims of War.

1148
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:43,583
Let's focus
In the creatures.

1149
01:19:44,629 --> 01:19:45,629
Yes, sir.

1150
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:18,562
Do you hear anything?

1151
01:20:35,975 --> 01:20:36,975
Oh, shit, is working.

1152
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:38,870
They come there.

1153
01:20:44,968 --> 01:20:46,368
Where is your explosion?

1154
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:47,730
Terry?

1155
01:20:48,314 --> 01:20:49,314
Yet.

1156
01:20:49,506 --> 01:20:50,506
We have to leave.

1157
01:20:50,977 --> 01:20:52,477
No, not yet.

1158
01:21:04,183 --> 01:21:04,983
Oh, shit.

1159
01:21:08,216 --> 01:21:10,216
You idiot, you idiot.

1160
01:21:24,848 --> 01:21:26,048
They will direitinhos sound.

1161
01:21:26,695 --> 01:21:27,895
No, they will direitinhos your mama.

1162
01:21:28,571 --> 01:21:30,171
Yes, but any
So we have to leave.

1163
01:21:30,315 --> 01:21:31,315
I understand well.

1164
01:21:38,928 --> 01:21:39,928
What is this?

1165
01:21:40,014 --> 01:21:41,014
Acommand.

1166
01:21:41,136 --> 01:21:42,436
I know that.
What is?

1167
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:43,597
Your explosion.

1168
01:21:48,698 --> 01:21:50,098
It was nice working with you, haaiman.

1169
01:21:50,963 --> 01:21:52,163
Also you, krokman.

1170
01:21:57,108 --> 01:21:58,408
Oh, shit, look at that.

1171
01:22:58,533 --> 01:22:59,833
Mr. the creatures are dead.

1172
01:23:01,654 --> 01:23:02,654
All right.

1173
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:05,399
All right dear, we,
Can dear.

1174
01:23:09,248 --> 01:23:09,948

It seems that now can
That cigar smoking.

1176
01:23:15,514 --> 01:23:16,214
All right.

1177
01:23:25,749 --> 01:23:27,749
I knew that I expect, my dear.

1178
01:23:29,406 --> 01:23:31,007
You owe me a whiskey.

1179
01:23:31,354 --> 01:23:32,654
How are you, Terry?

1180
01:23:32,884 --> 01:23:33,684
Better.

01:23:34,526 --> 01:23:35,526
I'm ah ...

1182
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:37,262
I feel I'm the best.

01:23:40,545 --> 01:23:41,545
These are my.

1184
01:23:49,388 --> 01:23:50,188
Nigel,

1185
01:23:50,905 --> 01:23:52,905
I think you did
Hutchinson just laugh.

1186
01:23:54,201 --> 01:23:55,501
Well, pigs can fly.

1187
01:23:56,967 --> 01:23:58,267
Fasten your seatbelts, boys.

1188
01:23:59,488 --> 01:24:00,688
We will go home.

1189
01:24:02,502 --> 01:24:03,502
What a Crocodile.
