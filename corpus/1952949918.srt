1
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:27,681
Hey hey.
Hey, look.

2
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:31,809
I need you to be strong
and stay with me

3
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,689
because you're the one

4
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:39,489
who's gonna have to kill me.

5
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:44,329
(siren blaring)

6
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:47,560
(horns honking)

7
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:58,443
(heavy breathing)

8
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:11,215
(phone ringing)

9
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:14,660
Woman: Hey, honey.
I hate how we left things this morning.

10
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:17,529
Maybe I'm just nervous
about my new show.

11
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:18,793
I don't know.

12
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:24,934
I know. My work is so much darker
than what I usually do

13
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:27,601
and I don't know what people
are gonna think of it.

14
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:31,805
It's just ever since I've been pregnant

15
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:35,043
I have this feeling like I'm being
watched or followed.

16
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:43,889
Yeah, I know what the books say.

17
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:45,392
I don't know what it means.

18
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:47,418
Maybe I'm just not ready
to be a mom.

19
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:52,658
No, Jack, it's not
the hormones either.

20
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,827
It feels different. Real.

21
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,167
Like something's happening.

22
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:03,842
Look, I'm going to the gallery to work
on something I've been thinking about.

23
00:02:03,878 --> 00:02:07,473
It's something I need
to get out of me.

24
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:10,882
No, not the baby.

25
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:15,613
I'll see you later.
Bye.

26
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,921
(growling)

27
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:25,195
(heavy breathing)

28
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,576
- (metal scrapes)
- (gasps)

29
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:49,981
(growling)

30
00:02:50,992 --> 00:02:52,789
Jack?

31
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:54,692
Is that you?

32
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,393
Hello?

33
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:03,700
(metal clanking)

34
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:06,104
Who's there?

35
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:13,236
Man:
Hello, Kathryn.

36
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:16,216
No. It's you.

37
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:19,482
- Man: Yes.
- But...

38
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:22,752
(screams)

39
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,792
I've come for you
and what's inside of you.

40
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,194
Kathryn: Oh my God

41
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,064
Man:
The real evolution is coming.

42
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:35,535
(Kathryn screams)

43
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:38,403
No, not my baby.
Not my baby.

44
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,946
- (growls)
- Baby.

45
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:50,546
(gagging)

46
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:52,951
(siren in distance)

47
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:06,125
And now,

48
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,397
18 years after the day I was born,

49
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:11,371
I'm here to convince you
that the monsters are real,

50
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:14,068
that they live among us,

51
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,140
within us.

52
00:04:20,415 --> 00:04:22,883
And hopefully one day
you'll know who I was

53
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,583
and what I tried to do.

54
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:30,058
But for now...

55
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:32,618
(alarm buzzing)

56
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,865
Boy's voice:
Who am I?

57
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:45,767
I guess I don't really have a good
answer to that question.

58
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,071
Man:
Don't forget to take your pills.

59
00:04:53,114 --> 00:04:56,049
Boy's voice: I guess you already know
my mom died when I was born,

60
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,484
but it never seemed like the end
of the world or anything.

61
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,181
Is that weird?
Maybe.

62
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:04,680
But how can you miss something
you never had, right?

63
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:08,355
* The messages I left
weren't answered *

64
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:13,192
* But I stayed off till bed *

65
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:16,101
* These were the only
things I dreamt... *

66
00:05:16,137 --> 00:05:19,470
I know how to take an exam,
I know the periodic elements,

67
00:05:19,507 --> 00:05:21,566
I know how to do school.

68
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:24,840
Do I have any idea
how to survive the real world?

69
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,908
* So wake me when
the world's worth waking up for *

70
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:35,013
* When my dreams don't stop
at my door *

71
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:36,751
* When the world's worth... *

72
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,918
My whole life I never
really felt like I fit in.

73
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,451
I just watched people

74
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:44,158
who looked like they were
actually enjoying their lives.

75
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:46,689
Your final grades will be posted
tomorrow night

76
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:49,703
outside the administration office
after graduation.

77
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:52,672
Good luck. Your parents'
fading hopes and dreams

78
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:54,800
are hanging on the outcome.

79
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,639
Boy's voice:
And now graduation is almost here

80
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:59,146
and I'm a little scared

81
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,944
that everything is gonna change.

82
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,383
Or even worse,

83
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,013
that nothing's gonna change.

84
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:12,015
I just thought you should know that

85
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,824
before you waste any more
of your time on me.

86
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:18,195
When I asked who you were,
I was looking for a name.

87
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:20,132
Oh.

88
00:06:20,168 --> 00:06:22,796
Sorry.
Will Kidman.

89
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:25,931
How is it possible
that in four years

90
00:06:25,973 --> 00:06:27,565
we haven't met until
your exit interview?

91
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:30,304
Well, that's a good thing, right?

92
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:32,835
That's one way to look at it.

93
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:38,212
Oh, you were a part of
the debate team

94
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:39,913
that brought home
the silver this year.

95
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:44,352
A little disappointing, isn't it?

96
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:48,324
You're obviously pretty bright

97
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:52,196
and you appear
perfectly adequate on paper.

98
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:55,725
It's just that there's
nothing special here.

99
00:06:57,772 --> 00:07:02,300
Four years, each day more impossibly
monotonous than the last.

100
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:05,835
But after today, we'll never have to
walk down this awful hallway ever again.

101
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,848
That's true, but soon
we'll have a whole lifetime

102
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:10,350
of even longer and even more
depressing hallways after that.

103
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:13,353
(chatting)

104
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:15,218
So how many video yearbooks
have you sold so far?

105
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:17,349
Two.

106
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:19,655
I'm getting the impression that nobody
wants to relive high school

107
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:21,958
in this sort of actual detail.

108
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:24,487
But on a lighter note,

109
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:29,162
I was finally able to hack into
the city's broadcast master control.

110
00:07:29,203 --> 00:07:30,727
What?

111
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:32,603
I've got a computer loaded
and ready to go

112
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,301
in the chapel
under construction upstairs.

113
00:07:34,342 --> 00:07:36,207
- Come here.
- Well...

114
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:38,769
- What do you mean?
- It means that tomorrow,

115
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:41,213
after my diploma is safely is hand,

116
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:43,217
a backup generator will kick in

117
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:46,550
and the regularly scheduled programming
of the greater metropolitan area

118
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:49,055
will be preempted
by the world premiere

119
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,116
of ''Untitled Sachin
Horror Project.''

120
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,855
How do you even walk
with a pair that big?

121
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:55,294
Like this.

122
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:57,820
(girls laugh)

123
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:02,061
High school girls are like
history class--

124
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:04,936
completely fascinating
and utterly boring at the same time.

125
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:08,936
Oh.

126
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:14,311
Will: I mean, who even enrolls
their kids into a new school

127
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:15,713
a month before graduation?

128
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,446
Their parole officers.

129
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:38,572
It's been four years, man.
It means your last chance.

130
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:42,234
He who hesitates...

131
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,142
Too much trouble.

132
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:47,773
Yeah, Roland is kind of intimidating.

133
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:49,339
But purely in a physical way.

134
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:51,510
Will:
Not him. Her.

135
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:56,122
Besides, I've got to worry about
getting into a good college.

136
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:57,749
No time for distractions, right?

137
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,419
(pounds locker)

138
00:09:03,731 --> 00:09:05,961
Uh, I-- I've--
I should go.

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,763
Talk to you tomorrow!

140
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:13,465
How many times
do I have to tell you?

141
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:16,408
Elliana only dates within her species.
Understood?

142
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:18,002
Will:
Understood.

143
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:20,070
Please.

144
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:22,639
If you get suspended before
the last day of school,

145
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:24,617
who's gonna be my date
to the grad party?

146
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:27,553
Go wait with the rest of the pack.
I'll be right there.

147
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:30,682
You live for now.

148
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:40,327
(chuckles nervously)

149
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:42,199
No, I...

150
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:46,263
I had him right where I wanted him,
but thanks.

151
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:49,704
I'm Elliana.

152
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:54,137
- You're Will.
- Yeah yeah, I am.

153
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:56,547
So what do we have here?
May I?

154
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:07,927
Why are they all of me?

155
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:14,665
I guess there's nothing much else
interesting to draw around here.

156
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,801
And I am?

157
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:25,578
Sign it?

158
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:27,205
Uh...

159
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,190
There are two types
of people in the world:

160
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:43,628
Those who take what they want,

161
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:46,761
and those who get taken.

162
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:52,639
Which are you, Will?

163
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,034
(bell rings)

164
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,569
Will's voice:
Fun science fact--

165
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:01,604
what really separates humans
from other animals?

166
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:04,641
2% of our DNA.
That's it.

167
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:13,388
You okay?
You're bleeding.

168
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:15,622
Oh yeah.
I'm fine, thanks.

169
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:18,393
Hi, I'm Kay.

170
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,866
Let me guess,

171
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:22,766
your first fight.

172
00:11:22,803 --> 00:11:25,033
Yeah, but you should
see the other guy.

173
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:31,741
He's perfectly fine.

174
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:36,405
Don't worry.

175
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,884
You'll have your revenge
in the real world.

176
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,717
Guys like you eat guys
like him for lunch.

177
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,352
I've got to go.
That one's mine.

178
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:49,295
- Okay.
- Hang in there.

179
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,026
Life gets better after high school.

180
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:57,169
I promise.

181
00:11:57,204 --> 00:11:58,831
Thanks.

182
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,743
(heavy breathing)

183
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:29,034
Looking back, it's funny how days
just kind of blend together.

184
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,732
One little unexpected moment

185
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:33,831
can pretty much change everything.

186
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:35,273
Jack:
What a shame.

187
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:38,278
We didn't have to lock everything
down like that back in my day.

188
00:12:38,312 --> 00:12:40,837
(alarm blaring)

189
00:12:50,124 --> 00:12:51,819
Jack:
Happy birthday, Will.

190
00:12:54,228 --> 00:12:56,321
This used to be my favorite room
in the world.

191
00:12:56,363 --> 00:12:59,355
When your mom
was pregnant with you

192
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,834
she'd come through that door,

193
00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:06,465
walk straight over here
and join me on this couch.

194
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:11,036
She'd lay down,

195
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:13,740
put her head on my lap

196
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:18,442
and just talk,

197
00:13:18,486 --> 00:13:21,887
you know, about what
you might turn out like.

198
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:24,288
Would you laugh like your mom

199
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:26,225
or sigh like your old man?

200
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,128
Or be some strange new combination
of the both of us?

201
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:36,834
Used to be my favorite
room in the world.

202
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:39,901
(sighs)
Now it's just a room.

203
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:48,040
Your mom spent all the money
she had at the time to buy me this.

204
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:55,814
A silver wedding band.

205
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:05,327
I can't believe you finally took it off.

206
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:21,675
Will’s voice:
I think it all comes down to this:

207
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:23,945
The things we suppress

208
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:26,248
very deep down in places
nobody can find them,

209
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:28,152
they come back
and get us in the end...

210
00:14:29,356 --> 00:14:31,449
with a vengeance.

211
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:44,061
It's funny, we take for granted
that we have free will,

212
00:14:44,104 --> 00:14:47,335
but we have so many rules
and expectations to live by.

213
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:50,832
And if we didn't, we would all
probably just blindly follow

214
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:53,278
our strongest desires,
good or bad, right?

215
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:57,473
So where exactly is the free will?

216
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:18,034
Okay.

217
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:19,937
You can do this.

218
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:24,274
Man:
Welcome to the party, Will.

219
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:25,869
Will:
Thanks.

220
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,278
I didn't even know
anything was down here.

221
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:33,411
Where is everybody?

222
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:37,584
Man: Don't worry.
It's a very exclusive guest list.

223
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:40,389
(loud music playing)

224
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:44,055
Whoa.

225
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:51,930
Who are these people?
They aren't students.

226
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:55,334
There are all kinds
of graduations, Will.

227
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:58,641
Consider yourself special for being
the youngest guest invited.

228
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:00,670
Stick out your tongue.

229
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:06,980
Now say hello
like I taught you, pet.

230
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:18,190
What-- what was that?

231
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:20,700
Freedom.

232
00:16:22,036 --> 00:16:23,833
We got something else for you.

233
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:26,866
She's yours, brother.

234
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,399
Happy birthday.

235
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,671
My plus one is here.

236
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:36,182
Yeah.

237
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:39,379
Me, here.

238
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,878
I had a hunch there was something
behind that civilized exterior.

239
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:48,225
- Let's dance.
- Oh no, I really don't do that.

240
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:57,829
I have a feeling you're gonna be doing
all sorts of new things tonight.

241
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:11,112
Can I ask you something?
Why Roland?

242
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:13,881
Why not?

243
00:17:13,921 --> 00:17:16,856
Maybe because he has everything you
look for in a high school boyfriend--

244
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,723
yummy face, nice ass,

245
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,024
cool car,
chateau in the south of France.

246
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:25,190
Oh, so it's a spiritual thing.

247
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:27,291
He's a distraction.
Something for now.

248
00:17:27,334 --> 00:17:31,600
Besides, he's the one
who asked me out.

249
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:34,198
I think most boys
are scared of me.

250
00:17:34,241 --> 00:17:37,176
So you've never been serious
about anyone?

251
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:39,179
You mean in love.

252
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:43,244
It's not like
I'm incapable of love, Will.

253
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:47,218
I love the way this dress
hugs my ass.

254
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:52,157
But commitment?
Well, let's just say

255
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,092
it's more fun being free

256
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:57,120
and a danger to myself
and others.

257
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:59,155
(both laugh)

258
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:03,292
Okay, my turn.

259
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:05,828
You've drawn enough pictures
of me to fill a gallery.

260
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:08,899
So why is it we've never had
a real conversation until this moment?

261
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:12,639
The accepted social order
of high school, I guess.

262
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,705
Where do you fit into
the accepted social order?

263
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:17,580
I don't know.

264
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:21,315
I just kind of blend into my
environment, avoid the predators.

265
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:23,220
What are you so scared of?

266
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:29,760
- You, mostly.
- Well, don't worry.

267
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,788
I don't bite...

268
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,825
much.

269
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:40,273
(laughs)

270
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,708
(growling)

271
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:53,310
What's wrong?

272
00:18:53,353 --> 00:18:55,844
I don't know.
I feel weird.

273
00:18:55,889 --> 00:18:57,914
Someone gave me a pill earlier.

274
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,791
- (laughs)
- (woman screams)

275
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:03,262
Just roll with it.

276
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:05,765
- (growling)
- (woman screaming)

277
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,266
Where's my glasses?
What's going on?

278
00:19:07,301 --> 00:19:10,202
Come on, Will.
Let go. Let it happen.

279
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:13,233
We've got to go.
We've got to go.

280
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:15,639
- No, it's just getting good.
- Come on.

281
00:19:17,144 --> 00:19:20,238
I think I'm seeing things.
Well, like--

282
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,942
Let's just get some fresh air.

283
00:19:26,954 --> 00:19:28,785
Do you remember
where the exit was?

284
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,086
(banging)

285
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:33,956
Elliana?

286
00:19:38,532 --> 00:19:40,557
Elliana, is that you?

287
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:43,760
(growls)

288
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,670
What is that?
What is that?

289
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:53,911
Elliana, can you hear me?

290
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:55,812
(growling continues)

291
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,421
(thuds)

292
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:13,422
- (growling)
- (pounding)

293
00:20:18,605 --> 00:20:20,334
Where's the door?

294
00:20:24,645 --> 00:20:26,112
- (growling)
- (pounding)

295
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,456
(grunts)

296
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,534
Whoa whoa whoa.

297
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,935
What the hell are you doing?

298
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:53,235
There's something down there, okay?
There's something down there.

299
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:55,036
Something, huh?

300
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:56,906
It's attacking people
and it's not human.

301
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:58,878
Not human, huh?

302
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:02,973
Fill that out and under

303
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:05,849
''Perpetrator ethnicity''

304
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:07,683
put ''Other.''

305
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:09,848
Will?

306
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,484
Elliana?

307
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:15,188
Are you okay?

308
00:21:15,228 --> 00:21:17,162
But...

309
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:19,290
How did you--
how did--

310
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:22,762
Jesus, kid.

311
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:26,239
You're high as a kite, aren't you?
You with him?

312
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:28,241
No.

313
00:21:29,276 --> 00:21:30,971
No.

314
00:21:35,782 --> 00:21:37,682
Will’s voice:
Today was not at all what I expected

315
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:39,242
when I woke up this morning.

316
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:42,016
But the days that change
your life forever rarely are.

317
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,388
Will:
This is gonna be really awkward,

318
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:48,917
but I need to talk to you
about something.

319
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:51,294
Okay, please don't tell me

320
00:21:51,331 --> 00:21:53,697
that you've secretly been
in love with me all these years.

321
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:55,827
- No.
- Oh.

322
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:58,702
Well, then please carry on.
And here, make yourself useful.

323
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,675
What can you tell me about--

324
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:08,177
what can you tell me
about werewolves?

325
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:12,584
Well, considering that three
of my 1 2 unproduced screenplays

326
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:17,147
involve lycanthropes of some variety,
I can tell you a lot.

327
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,124
Okay, they don't like
silver bullets, right?

328
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,652
No, they don't like any silver
in their bloodstream

329
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:24,323
to the point of dying from it.

330
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:28,664
And the only other way a human can kill
a run-of-the-mill werewolf is by fire.

331
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:31,398
Have you never seen
a werewolf flick?

332
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:33,929
Eh, can't blame you.

333
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:36,909
That's what studios get for casting
geezers in their lead roles.

334
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:38,604
I mean, if I want to see
people in their 40s

335
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:40,044
I would just go home
and look at my parents.

336
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,413
Okay, this is just gonna
sound crazy,

337
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,216
but I maybe saw one
at the party last night.

338
00:22:47,254 --> 00:22:51,418
Okay, the party where I assume
it was wild and dark

339
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,824
and you were high on drugs?

340
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:56,560
Yeah.

341
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:03,063
So silver and fire, that's it?

342
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:06,595
Will, these aren't your
makeup-wearing, skin-glistening

343
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,904
pansy-ass vampires, okay?

344
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:11,934
There's not some grocery list
of items that you can just get

345
00:23:11,978 --> 00:23:14,606
to cripple them
or scare them off like,

346
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:18,948
''Oh, garlic.
Oh, some holy water.''

347
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:22,011
You know, two fingers
perpendicular to each other.

348
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:34,995
Okay, look. Real lycanthropes
are hard-frickin'-core.

349
00:23:35,035 --> 00:23:37,799
Okay? They're doomed to struggle
between their humanity

350
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:40,329
and their animal natures.
And once they kill a human,

351
00:23:40,373 --> 00:23:44,070
which they like always do,
there's no going back.

352
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:46,875
They become vicious killers for life.

353
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:51,813
So hypothetically, there wouldn't
be anything to worry about

354
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:53,877
'cause there's already a full moon
this month, right?

355
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,185
There's a full moon tonight.
A blue moon, actually.

356
00:23:57,224 --> 00:24:00,625
So if they were really out there,

357
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,823
that should certainly kick things
up a notch, wouldn't it?

358
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,994
Why would they be after me?

359
00:24:08,034 --> 00:24:11,629
Either you pose a threat
to their existence

360
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:13,298
or you're food.

361
00:24:16,276 --> 00:24:18,107
In your case,

362
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:20,409
I'm guessing they've already
picked out the best wine

363
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:21,937
to bring out your flavor.

364
00:24:24,317 --> 00:24:26,649
What are they doing in here?

365
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:30,213
Well, nobody goes
to church anymore,

366
00:24:30,257 --> 00:24:32,782
so this is gonna be
the new computer lab.

367
00:24:34,628 --> 00:24:36,926
You know, when somebody had
a question they couldn't answer,

368
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:39,898
they used to ask God.
Now they ask Wikipedia.

369
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:41,798
(laughs)

370
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:44,269
The god with answers.

371
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,099
(bell rings)

372
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:03,087
* When he moves I watch him
from behind *

373
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:04,920
* He turns and laughter
flickers in his eyes *

374
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:07,085
* Intent and direct
when he speaks *

375
00:25:07,127 --> 00:25:08,617
* I watch his lips *

376
00:25:08,662 --> 00:25:10,857
* And when he drives
I love to watch his hands *

377
00:25:10,897 --> 00:25:13,058
* White and smooth,
almost feminine *

378
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:14,623
* Almost American *

379
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:16,693
- * I have to watch him... *
- (phone vibrating)

380
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:18,897
* In his face age descends on youth *

381
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,839
* Exaggeration on the truth *

382
00:25:20,874 --> 00:25:24,867
* He caught me looking in then,
but soon his eyes forgot me *

383
00:25:24,911 --> 00:25:28,779
* And everything he seems to do
reflects just another shade of blue *

384
00:25:28,815 --> 00:25:31,750
* I saw him searching into you
and ached a while *

385
00:25:31,785 --> 00:25:34,345
* I watch his lips caress the glass *

386
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:36,753
* His fingers stroke
its stem and pass *

387
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,519
* To lift a cigarette at last *

388
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:42,722
* He dries his eyes
from a shadow by the stair *

389
00:25:42,762 --> 00:25:44,195
* I watch as he weeps unaware *

390
00:25:44,231 --> 00:25:46,028
* That I'm in awe of his despair *

391
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:50,394
* In his face
age descends on youth *

392
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:52,029
* Exaggeration on the truth *

393
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:55,530
* He caught me looking in then,
but soon his eyes forgot me *

394
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:58,567
* And everything he seems to do *

395
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:00,307
* Reflects just another
shade of blue *

396
00:26:00,347 --> 00:26:02,747
* I saw him searching into you
and ached a while *

397
00:26:02,782 --> 00:26:06,149
* In his face age descends on youth *

398
00:26:06,186 --> 00:26:07,949
* Exaggeration on the truth *

399
00:26:07,988 --> 00:26:11,082
* He caught me looking in then,
but soon his eyes forgot me *

400
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:14,321
* And everything he seems to do *

401
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:16,454
* Reflects just another
shade of blue *

402
00:26:16,496 --> 00:26:19,863
* I saw him searching into you
and ached a while... *

403
00:26:43,323 --> 00:26:46,156
(bell rings)

404
00:26:46,192 --> 00:26:47,955
Woman on P.A.:
Last ever school lunch

405
00:26:47,994 --> 00:26:50,724
now being served, seniors.

406
00:26:54,668 --> 00:26:56,693
(door squeaks)

407
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:02,064
Was I not clear with you, man?

408
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:04,975
Were you seriously with
Elliana last night?

409
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:08,208
School's almost over.
Just leave me alone.

410
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:10,808
- I'm never gonna see her again.
- That's not good enough, man.

411
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:14,378
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

412
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:18,489
Right now, looking at an asshole.

413
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,627
Well, there must be something
wrong with your glasses.

414
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:25,426
(cracks)

415
00:27:25,465 --> 00:27:27,763
Oh, that's it.

416
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:29,860
They're broken.

417
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:33,696
This is where you die, man.

418
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,038
And nobody's around to save
your sorry ass this time.

419
00:27:37,377 --> 00:27:39,106
(grunting)

420
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:46,216
(growls)

421
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:09,068
(panting)

422
00:28:23,723 --> 00:28:25,782
I'm gonna tear you up, Kidman.

423
00:28:54,954 --> 00:28:56,512
Where are you, Kidman?

424
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,621
Hey, I just want to talk.

425
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:13,968
You're dead.

426
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:18,006
(growling)

427
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:20,908
Oh crap.

428
00:29:20,947 --> 00:29:22,938
- (roaring)
- Fuck!

429
00:29:22,982 --> 00:29:25,007
Hey, what the hell are you?

430
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:29,985
(gunshots)

431
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:36,422
Hey, I'm not an asshole, man.

432
00:29:36,463 --> 00:29:38,192
I'm just misunderstood.

433
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:40,756
Okay okay, I am an asshole.

434
00:29:42,702 --> 00:29:44,499
- Please don't hurt me.
- (roars)

435
00:29:44,537 --> 00:29:47,529
(screaming)

436
00:29:50,677 --> 00:29:52,745
(heavy breathing)

437
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,652
Will’s voice:
You know what we do?

438
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:05,055
We let moments pass,
opportunities pass,

439
00:30:05,091 --> 00:30:07,184
our lives pass,

440
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:09,593
day after day

441
00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:11,859
until before we know it,
without even realizing it,

442
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:14,662
the best versions of ourselves
have become a distant memory.

443
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:19,271
Look, I've been going
through life on autopilot

444
00:30:19,305 --> 00:30:20,829
with nothing really required of me--

445
00:30:20,874 --> 00:30:23,638
stop, go, do this,
don't do that,

446
00:30:23,676 --> 00:30:26,736
moving along being polite,
just surviving.

447
00:30:28,715 --> 00:30:30,876
I don't want to be one
of the herd anymore.

448
00:30:30,917 --> 00:30:33,249
What do you want, Will?

449
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:46,022
* Nothing you do can stop me
from living today *

450
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:53,035
* Nothing you say
can keep me down *

451
00:30:53,072 --> 00:30:56,132
* I'm on my way *

452
00:30:58,645 --> 00:31:00,340
* What will you scream... *

453
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,814
I want you.

454
00:31:04,284 --> 00:31:06,684
I've wanted to say that
for a really long time.

455
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:19,360
Nice ass.

456
00:31:33,813 --> 00:31:35,144
What smells so good?

457
00:31:35,181 --> 00:31:37,809
Graduation dogs.
You want me to hook you up?

458
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:41,782
Yeah, I really do,

459
00:31:41,821 --> 00:31:44,346
but no thanks.
I don't eat meat.

460
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,824
You have any idea what
they put in these things?

461
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:48,759
I wouldn't exactly call it meat.

462
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:54,162
Come on, live a little.

463
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:01,600
Why not?
Yeah, give me one with everything.

464
00:32:17,023 --> 00:32:19,287
(crunches)

465
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:28,560
So, did you have fun
at the party last night?

466
00:32:29,736 --> 00:32:31,727
(crunches)

467
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:39,142
How does Roland taste?

468
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:44,475
Oh my-- oh my God.

469
00:32:44,517 --> 00:32:46,576
(coughing, vomiting)

470
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,553
(students murmuring)

471
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:56,623
Have you been experiencing any
other unusual symptoms lately?

472
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:59,564
(sighs)
You wouldn't believe me.

473
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,624
Some really crazy shit's been going on.

474
00:33:01,668 --> 00:33:03,533
Hmm.

475
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:05,400
Well, you're at
the tail end of puberty

476
00:33:05,438 --> 00:33:07,906
and you're under
the stress of final exams,

477
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,703
worried about going to college.

478
00:33:09,742 --> 00:33:12,233
It's perfectly normal.

479
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:14,439
District requires us to draw blood

480
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,677
just to verify that it's not a virus
or drugs.

481
00:33:17,717 --> 00:33:20,277
But I'm sure you
and your blood are just fine.

482
00:33:29,462 --> 00:33:31,430
(coins clinking)

483
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:34,966
(machine humming)

484
00:33:37,603 --> 00:33:39,935
Damn it!

485
00:33:39,972 --> 00:33:43,100
I saw the whole thing.
That Javamatic had it coming.

486
00:33:51,184 --> 00:33:53,243
Do I know you from somewhere?

487
00:33:55,321 --> 00:33:57,915
I don't think so.

488
00:33:57,957 --> 00:33:59,822
My name is Kay.

489
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:01,759
Jack.

490
00:34:01,794 --> 00:34:04,627
I'd shake, but I think I might
have broke my hand.

491
00:34:11,337 --> 00:34:12,804
So what brings you here?

492
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,966
My boy.

493
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:18,101
Me too.
Must be the full moon or something.

494
00:34:18,144 --> 00:34:21,079
I just-- it's getting
so hard, you know?

495
00:34:21,114 --> 00:34:22,945
You just want to protect them.

496
00:34:22,982 --> 00:34:26,975
I had him strapped in a car seat
till he was eight.

497
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:28,486
Hmm.

498
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:30,045
Today you got child-proof cabinets,

499
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:32,455
flame-retardant pajamas,

500
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:35,052
- bicycle helmets.
- Hmm.

501
00:34:35,094 --> 00:34:37,289
The closest thing I had
to a bicycle helmet

502
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,195
was when I grew my hair out
in the eighth grade.

503
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,731
There's some things
you can't protect them from

504
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,362
no matter how hard you try.

505
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,869
Yeah, like from girls.

506
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:53,669
End up breaking their heart.

507
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:55,704
Well, you know
my philosophy on that is

508
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:59,309
kill the first one who does
and hope that the word gets around.

509
00:34:59,352 --> 00:35:00,649
(laughs)

510
00:35:03,156 --> 00:35:05,647
Hey, what's the emergency?

511
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:07,818
How do you become a werewolf?

512
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,987
All right, what is going on with you?

513
00:35:10,029 --> 00:35:13,328
Now I'm glad that you've become a fan.
I really am.

514
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:15,926
But you're verging on
major geekdom here.

515
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:17,492
Humor me, please.

516
00:35:18,704 --> 00:35:22,606
Okay. If a werewolf
drew blood from you

517
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:26,544
and you survive,
then you would become one.

518
00:35:27,613 --> 00:35:29,911
- Did that happen?
- I don't know.

519
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,085
How would I find out?
You know, like hypothetically?

520
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,748
- Dude, have you been working out?
- Dude!

521
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:39,087
Sorry. Yeah, no,
hypothetically,

522
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:42,322
um, you could use one of these

523
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:44,454
and try and kill yourself.

524
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:46,556
Your wounds would heal.

525
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:49,295
Remember, only fire and silver

526
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:52,793
can kill a garden variety
lycanthrope.

527
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:54,568
Garden variety lycanthrope?

528
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:56,598
Yeah, as opposed to the alpha,

529
00:35:56,642 --> 00:36:00,043
the leader,
the uberwolf.

530
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,014
No one really knows how
you become one,

531
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:06,485
but if you are one,
only another wolf can kill you.

532
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,919
(laughs)
But no other wolf would have the balls.

533
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:12,280
What do you say
we test your theory?

534
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:15,419
Well, I guess I should go
check on mine.

535
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:21,397
Um,

536
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:25,393
would you like to get lunch
or maybe drinks this afternoon?

537
00:36:25,438 --> 00:36:27,770
I could really use one.

538
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,237
Thanks.

539
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:33,768
But I think I've had enough excitement
for one day.

540
00:36:33,813 --> 00:36:35,542
Okay.

541
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:39,017
Well, I'll be at Bradner's Pub
in case you change your mind.

542
00:36:41,454 --> 00:36:42,785
Maybe I will.

543
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:48,421
What are you, insane?

544
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:53,023
Look, you're not a werewolf, okay?

545
00:36:53,065 --> 00:36:55,158
Your wounds will not heal.

546
00:36:56,602 --> 00:36:58,695
Okay, wait wait.
What are you--

547
00:36:58,738 --> 00:37:00,569
Okay, what if something
goes wrong?

548
00:37:00,606 --> 00:37:02,801
What am I supposed to tell
the authorities?

549
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:04,969
Okay, wait wait.

550
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:10,847
You know, just in case.

551
00:37:21,327 --> 00:37:22,726
(groans)

552
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:26,560
(groans)

553
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:28,294
- (scalpel clangs)
- Sachin: Oh oh shit.

554
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:31,064
Oh shit.
Um, okay.

555
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:33,367
Uh, oh man.

556
00:37:33,406 --> 00:37:36,705
When you play a practical joke
you really commit.

557
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:39,108
Okay, I'm gonna go get the nurse.

558
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:58,924
What the hell
is happening to me?!

559
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,280
Lycanthrope.

560
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,619
(gasps)

561
00:38:22,655 --> 00:38:24,316
Four years of high school
finally over

562
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:26,791
and you celebrate
by coming to the library.

563
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,425
You look yummy.

564
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:39,233
I'm pretty sure all of the E
from last night

565
00:38:39,271 --> 00:38:42,866
is out of my system by now,
so why?

566
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:47,374
This is gonna sound

567
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:49,381
so stupid.

568
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:53,447
But...

569
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:58,083
I think that I might be...

570
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:01,584
a werewolf.

571
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:09,598
Will’s voice:
Vampires, they've got it easy.

572
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:12,962
They're all about wish fulfillment.

573
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:15,132
Me? I can't read minds.

574
00:39:15,174 --> 00:39:18,041
I'm not really older and wiser
and more mature than I look.

575
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:21,535
Well, we do have half an hour
before they lock down campus.

576
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,048
You want to find out?

577
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:26,017
Will’s voice:
I'm just a guy

578
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:29,112
who wants to do
really bad things to a girl.

579
00:39:29,155 --> 00:39:32,318
(horns honking)

580
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:34,622
(laughing)

581
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,528
I knew you'd join me
for a drink, or five.

582
00:39:38,564 --> 00:39:40,293
You did, huh?

583
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:52,172
Aw. A cutie.

584
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:56,113
Look, I know that there's this
whole courtship ritual thing

585
00:39:56,148 --> 00:39:58,412
I'm supposed to follow, but--

586
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:01,477
Well, how about we skip
the clumsy first date

587
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,545
where you don't even know
if it's okay to kiss me

588
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:07,525
because really you're not even sure
we're actually on a date?

589
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:15,127
And while we're at it,

590
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:18,466
why don't we skip the more
promising second date

591
00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:21,405
where I've proven to you

592
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,670
what a good listener I am,

593
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:27,076
but really all I'm thinking about

594
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:30,378
is what sex with you
would be like?

595
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:32,509
Okay. While we're at it

596
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:35,714
maybe we should
just skip the third date too

597
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:38,690
where we have really bad sex.

598
00:40:38,724 --> 00:40:40,749
Well, in that case,

599
00:40:40,793 --> 00:40:43,023
let's pretend
this is the fourth date.

600
00:40:43,062 --> 00:40:46,554
And if we don't have sex again soon,

601
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:49,966
and if it's not really good this time,

602
00:40:50,002 --> 00:40:53,096
things are gonna get awkward
between us.

603
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:54,834
Do you trust me?

604
00:41:00,412 --> 00:41:02,175
I'll take that as a yes.

605
00:41:03,282 --> 00:41:04,874
You see, in the movies

606
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:08,045
the concerned friend always handcuffs
the possible werewolf

607
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:11,716
to keep him from harming anyone
in case he turns.

608
00:41:17,696 --> 00:41:19,186
This will have to do.

609
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:33,238
Where did you come from?

610
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,271
The better question is,

611
00:41:37,316 --> 00:41:39,079
where have I been?

612
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:42,679
(laughs)
What are you talking about?

613
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,555
Now,

614
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:50,460
let's see if you made
the right choice.

615
00:41:55,734 --> 00:41:58,464
Because if you're a werewolf,

616
00:41:58,504 --> 00:42:02,270
then I may have just saved
some innocent lives.

617
00:42:03,943 --> 00:42:05,706
(zipper unzips)

618
00:42:05,744 --> 00:42:08,713
But if I'm a werewolf,

619
00:42:08,747 --> 00:42:13,411
then you just made
a very very bad mistake.

620
00:42:17,223 --> 00:42:19,714
You're completely at my mercy.

621
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:31,061
(deep moan)

622
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:32,968
Ah.

623
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,510
(both laugh)

624
00:42:42,715 --> 00:42:46,207
Now I think you should just stay
there and cool down a bit

625
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:48,311
'cause it looks like
you're going through

626
00:42:48,354 --> 00:42:50,151
a little transformation right now.

627
00:42:50,189 --> 00:42:51,884
(laughs)

628
00:42:56,528 --> 00:42:58,587
(sighs)

629
00:42:58,631 --> 00:43:00,895
- So you're not--
- A monster?

630
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:04,061
No. Not literally anyway.

631
00:43:06,472 --> 00:43:08,463
I'm gonna go out on a limb

632
00:43:08,507 --> 00:43:10,600
and say that neither are you.

633
00:43:14,146 --> 00:43:17,479
Aren't you even a little curious
why this is happening?

634
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:19,814
Why I'm here with you?

635
00:43:19,852 --> 00:43:22,047
Oh, come on, Jack.

636
00:43:22,087 --> 00:43:25,113
I know I'm bigger, stronger,

637
00:43:25,157 --> 00:43:27,990
cut off that wispy red hair.

638
00:43:28,027 --> 00:43:31,724
I stayed young and beautiful
while you just grew old.

639
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:34,665
But you wore my ring
for 20 years

640
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,225
- till last night, baby.
- (gasps)

641
00:43:40,506 --> 00:43:42,667
What's the matter?

642
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:44,505
You look like you've seen a ghost.

643
00:43:44,543 --> 00:43:46,374
What's happening?

644
00:43:50,749 --> 00:43:54,150
You were so worried
about keeping our boy safe,

645
00:43:54,186 --> 00:43:57,121
you didn't even give him the tools
to take care of himself.

646
00:43:57,156 --> 00:43:59,454
Now I have to do it.

647
00:44:01,493 --> 00:44:03,085
Don't you remember?

648
00:44:04,129 --> 00:44:06,620
Till death do us part.

649
00:44:06,665 --> 00:44:08,929
(roaring)

650
00:44:08,968 --> 00:44:11,266
- (Jack screaming)
- (school bell ringing)

651
00:44:12,438 --> 00:44:14,065
(students shouting, chatting)

652
00:44:14,106 --> 00:44:16,597
Man on P.A.: Enjoy your summer.
Good luck, graduates.

653
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:28,382
Who did that to you?

654
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,287
I don't know.

655
00:44:31,323 --> 00:44:33,291
When they killed my mom
they got me too.

656
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:36,951
* You don't need to change *

657
00:44:36,996 --> 00:44:38,987
* A thing about you, babe *

658
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:41,158
* I'm telling you,
from where I sit *

659
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,462
* You're one of a kind... *

660
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:44,162
When I was 1 2

661
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:46,262
my mom and I came home
from this day of shopping

662
00:44:46,305 --> 00:44:48,102
to find half of our stuff gone--

663
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,904
furniture, TVs-- whatever.

664
00:44:50,943 --> 00:44:53,002
I thought we'd been robbed.

665
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,307
(sighs)
You weren't?

666
00:44:56,348 --> 00:44:58,646
My dad left us.

667
00:44:58,684 --> 00:45:00,652
No warning.

668
00:45:01,887 --> 00:45:05,482
He left a note saying
he hadn't signed up for this

669
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:08,322
and we were holding him back.

670
00:45:10,396 --> 00:45:13,297
So you decided to date guys who
disappointed you at the start.

671
00:45:13,332 --> 00:45:15,323
Something like that.

672
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:20,136
I so could have been that guy.

673
00:45:22,074 --> 00:45:24,235
(laughs)

674
00:45:26,145 --> 00:45:29,114
Oh man, you must think I'm crazy.

675
00:45:29,148 --> 00:45:31,048
Why are you still here?

676
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:33,278
What is it about me?

677
00:45:34,787 --> 00:45:37,187
You're kind of like a good book
I can't put down yet.

678
00:45:43,095 --> 00:45:45,529
''It was one of those
rare smiles.

679
00:45:46,532 --> 00:45:48,796
It understood you just as you
wanted to be understood,

680
00:45:48,834 --> 00:45:52,065
and believed in you just as you
would like to believe in yourself

681
00:45:52,104 --> 00:45:53,935
and assured you
just the impression of yourself

682
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:56,031
that you'd hope to convey.''

683
00:45:58,877 --> 00:46:00,777
Or something like that.

684
00:46:00,813 --> 00:46:02,781
(chuckles)

685
00:46:04,917 --> 00:46:06,976
So do you quote ''Gatsby''
to all the girls?

686
00:46:09,521 --> 00:46:10,852
(phone beeps)

687
00:46:10,889 --> 00:46:13,357
* Well, I've been lost
and I need direction *

688
00:46:13,392 --> 00:46:15,917
* And I could use
a little love protection *

689
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:18,088
* What do you say, honey?
Come to my... *

690
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:20,257
I have to go.

691
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:23,462
After graduation my mom and I
are going to Europe for the summer.

692
00:46:23,502 --> 00:46:26,096
* I can take a punch,
I don't mind it bleeding *

693
00:46:26,138 --> 00:46:28,868
* As long as afterwards
you feel bad for me... *

694
00:46:28,907 --> 00:46:31,171
So do you think you'll be able
to live without me?

695
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,701
I hope so.

696
00:46:33,745 --> 00:46:36,339
* I've got a deep desire
and it needs quenching *

697
00:46:36,381 --> 00:46:39,145
* And I think that's pretty plain
for you to see *

698
00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:44,045
* Well, enough about me
and more about you *

699
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:46,785
* Would that be the gentlemanly
thing to do? *

700
00:46:46,825 --> 00:46:49,225
* I hope you like your men
sweet and polite... *

701
00:46:49,261 --> 00:46:52,697
So what is it about me?

702
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:55,427
I don't know.
It's kind of hard to explain.

703
00:46:58,036 --> 00:47:00,436
It's like the rest of the world
is in black and white,

704
00:47:00,472 --> 00:47:03,202
you're in color.

705
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:05,642
* Relationships, I don't know why *

706
00:47:05,677 --> 00:47:08,612
* They never work out,
they make you cry *

707
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:11,946
* But the guy that says goodbye
to you is out of his mind. *

708
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:13,986
(whirring)

709
00:47:13,986 --> 00:47:15,283
(whirring)

710
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,686
(typing)

711
00:47:23,695 --> 00:47:25,663
Christ.

712
00:47:28,901 --> 00:47:30,926
(gasps)

713
00:47:32,804 --> 00:47:35,272
Just overrode the system.

714
00:47:35,307 --> 00:47:37,104
There's no way in hell
anyone or anything

715
00:47:37,142 --> 00:47:39,576
is getting in or out
of here before tonight.

716
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:42,205
Just leave my money on the desk.

717
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:45,914
Selling out your own species.

718
00:47:48,554 --> 00:47:50,112
How weak.

719
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,323
Kathryn:
Will?

720
00:47:56,361 --> 00:47:58,192
Elliana?

721
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:02,591
Elliana, is that you?

722
00:48:03,835 --> 00:48:07,100
Oh, it's you.
What are you doing here?

723
00:48:08,106 --> 00:48:10,074
I came here for you, Will.

724
00:48:12,978 --> 00:48:14,639
Holy shit.

725
00:48:15,814 --> 00:48:19,181
I've waited 18 years for this.

726
00:48:21,787 --> 00:48:23,652
It's time for us to go.

727
00:48:24,923 --> 00:48:27,153
What? Us?
Us go where?

728
00:48:28,427 --> 00:48:31,328
(laughs)

729
00:48:31,363 --> 00:48:33,422
Everywhere.

730
00:48:33,465 --> 00:48:35,194
(growling)

731
00:48:38,237 --> 00:48:39,795
You're one of them, aren't you?

732
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:42,102
One of us.

733
00:48:50,215 --> 00:48:51,739
Hi, it's Sara Winter.

734
00:48:51,783 --> 00:48:53,910
Leave me a message
and I'll call you right back.

735
00:48:53,952 --> 00:48:55,817
- (beeps)
- Hey, Mom.

736
00:48:55,854 --> 00:48:57,822
I know you're probably on your way,

737
00:48:57,856 --> 00:49:00,950
but I was hoping we could
just meet after the ceremony.

738
00:49:00,993 --> 00:49:03,393
It's just there's this boy.

739
00:49:03,428 --> 00:49:05,589
And no, it's not Roland.

740
00:49:05,631 --> 00:49:08,259
I'd just really like to stay.

741
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,996
I'm graduating today.
I can't believe it.

742
00:49:11,036 --> 00:49:13,334
All right, I love you, Mom.
Bye.

743
00:49:14,606 --> 00:49:16,005
(exhales)

744
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:19,368
You survived an attack

745
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:23,044
while you were still
in the womb.

746
00:49:26,084 --> 00:49:27,779
My womb.

747
00:49:32,024 --> 00:49:33,753
No.

748
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:36,260
No, you died.
How are you even here?

749
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:38,889
It's okay, honey.

750
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,330
At first I was scared too.

751
00:49:41,366 --> 00:49:43,493
But just imagine

752
00:49:43,535 --> 00:49:47,596
having the power over all the things
you feel you can't control.

753
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:49,436
It's amazing.

754
00:49:58,183 --> 00:49:59,741
Why did you wait so long?

755
00:50:01,086 --> 00:50:03,486
I was watching you,

756
00:50:03,522 --> 00:50:06,616
waiting until you were ready.

757
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,755
And the blue moon.

758
00:50:09,795 --> 00:50:13,253
Tonight is gonna be so special.

759
00:50:14,299 --> 00:50:17,097
Wait wait. If I'm one of you, then why
are the other ones trying to kill me?

760
00:50:18,303 --> 00:50:19,702
(snarls)

761
00:50:19,738 --> 00:50:21,706
We weren't trying to kill you.

762
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,140
We were trying to welcome you.

763
00:50:26,712 --> 00:50:28,976
So this curse--

764
00:50:29,014 --> 00:50:31,107
Gift.

765
00:50:31,149 --> 00:50:33,049
--has been inside me my whole life.

766
00:50:33,085 --> 00:50:36,316
You call this a life?

767
00:50:41,493 --> 00:50:43,393
Forget your books...

768
00:50:44,996 --> 00:50:46,224
and your technology.

769
00:50:50,202 --> 00:50:52,136
That's not life.

770
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,004
It's a series of distractions
from life.

771
00:50:58,043 --> 00:51:01,410
Your father tried
to suppress you

772
00:51:01,446 --> 00:51:03,539
with drugs.

773
00:51:05,717 --> 00:51:09,153
He tried to domesticate you
like a yellow Lab.

774
00:51:09,187 --> 00:51:12,179
He taught you useless facts
and called it knowledge.

775
00:51:12,224 --> 00:51:14,522
He made you soft...

776
00:51:16,228 --> 00:51:18,219
and called it civilized.

777
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:27,836
You have so much to learn.

778
00:51:27,873 --> 00:51:32,105
Life as you know it is over.

779
00:51:34,513 --> 00:51:36,708
Elliana:
You know, I thought about it,

780
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:39,216
and I don't think you can
live without me.

781
00:51:39,251 --> 00:51:41,082
Will?

782
00:51:44,489 --> 00:51:45,888
Who's that?

783
00:51:46,892 --> 00:51:48,359
Uh...

784
00:51:48,393 --> 00:51:50,258
It's time for us to go, son.

785
00:51:53,165 --> 00:51:55,190
Son?

786
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:58,566
Wait, I don't understand.
I thought your mom was dead.

787
00:52:07,345 --> 00:52:10,178
Listen, I thought about it
and I can definitely live without you.

788
00:52:15,587 --> 00:52:18,078
Goodbye.

789
00:52:18,123 --> 00:52:20,683
So what? I'm never gonna
see you again?

790
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:28,722
Wait.

791
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:31,031
What is going on here?

792
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:37,940
Our use for you is over, pet.

793
00:52:39,911 --> 00:52:43,779
But you and me
can have a little fun

794
00:52:43,815 --> 00:52:45,680
before I put you out
of your misery.

795
00:52:45,717 --> 00:52:47,651
Jesus.

796
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:49,677
He's not coming.

797
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:54,056
Lesson number one, Will:
survival of the pack over all.

798
00:52:54,092 --> 00:52:57,823
Besides, we can't have anyone
knowing about us yet.

799
00:52:57,863 --> 00:52:59,455
It'd spoil the surprise.

800
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:09,732
Hey!

801
00:53:17,215 --> 00:53:18,876
Let me do it.

802
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:20,942
(laughs)

803
00:53:20,986 --> 00:53:23,011
Will?

804
00:53:23,054 --> 00:53:25,147
Please.

805
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:54,981
(Elliana groans)

806
00:54:00,725 --> 00:54:02,488
Let him come to us.

807
00:54:07,832 --> 00:54:10,062
(coughs)

808
00:54:19,811 --> 00:54:22,177
(whimpers)

809
00:54:33,992 --> 00:54:35,584
Will.

810
00:54:37,429 --> 00:54:39,192
No, Will.

811
00:54:42,667 --> 00:54:44,897
(gasps)
Will.

812
00:54:46,972 --> 00:54:48,803
(cracking)

813
00:54:56,681 --> 00:54:58,808
(groaning)

814
00:54:59,851 --> 00:55:02,615
Will’s voice: You know what they say
about the white light?

815
00:55:02,654 --> 00:55:05,020
It's bullshit.

816
00:55:05,056 --> 00:55:07,456
Or maybe they just didn't
turn it on for me.

817
00:55:07,492 --> 00:55:10,052
What I did see

818
00:55:10,095 --> 00:55:13,326
was why the lure of immortality
is so strong.

819
00:55:16,134 --> 00:55:18,659
So you're--

820
00:55:20,472 --> 00:55:22,497
- A monster.
- (whimpers)

821
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:26,668
Literally.

822
00:55:27,779 --> 00:55:29,614
(alarm sounding)

823
00:55:33,918 --> 00:55:36,716
Let's go.
Let's go before campus locks down.

824
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,100
No! No!

825
00:55:59,778 --> 00:56:01,905
(lights humming)

826
00:56:06,384 --> 00:56:07,749
Elliana:
Now what?

827
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:10,812
(gates clanging)

828
00:56:10,855 --> 00:56:12,447
(chugging)

829
00:56:14,092 --> 00:56:15,753
Okay.

830
00:56:16,761 --> 00:56:18,626
After tonight

831
00:56:18,663 --> 00:56:21,223
I will only return to this campus

832
00:56:21,266 --> 00:56:23,826
to promote my films

833
00:56:23,868 --> 00:56:26,393
and to autograph
women's breasts.

834
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,240
Oh hi.
I didn't see you there.

835
00:56:38,283 --> 00:56:40,046
My name is Sachin.

836
00:56:40,085 --> 00:56:43,384
And you, ladies and gentlemen,
are about to witness

837
00:56:43,421 --> 00:56:46,754
the rebirth of American cinema.

838
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:49,817
''Untitled Sachin Horror Project.''

839
00:56:49,861 --> 00:56:52,295
(door opening)

840
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,820
(footsteps)

841
00:56:53,865 --> 00:56:55,628
Who's there?

842
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:57,191
Man:
Sorry, Sachin.

843
00:56:57,235 --> 00:57:00,693
But this is where you fade to black.

844
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:02,730
(growling)

845
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:06,643
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

846
00:57:10,448 --> 00:57:13,144
Please be there, security.
Security.

847
00:57:20,992 --> 00:57:23,256
Elliana:
Eddie?

848
00:57:23,294 --> 00:57:26,593
Keys. Where's his keys?
Where's his keys?

849
00:57:36,508 --> 00:57:38,533
Phones are dead.

850
00:57:39,577 --> 00:57:41,010
Uh...

851
00:57:43,782 --> 00:57:45,841
Okay, the school won't unlock
until after graduation.

852
00:57:45,884 --> 00:57:47,647
There has to be some sort
of override switch.

853
00:57:47,685 --> 00:57:50,176
Is there a chance anyone
is still on campus?

854
00:57:50,221 --> 00:57:51,848
(werewolf growling)

855
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:53,619
(lights clattering)

856
00:57:53,658 --> 00:57:56,525
It's Sachin.
Sachin.

857
00:57:56,561 --> 00:57:58,893
Werewolfs on steroids!

858
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,693
And they're so much more jacked up
than in the movies.

859
00:58:00,732 --> 00:58:03,701
They're not hiding in the woods, okay?
They're here.

860
00:58:03,735 --> 00:58:05,202
- (roars)
- God!

861
00:58:05,236 --> 00:58:07,898
Will, I'm so sorry
for not believing you, man.

862
00:58:07,939 --> 00:58:11,739
Look, whatever you do,
don't kill a human, okay?

863
00:58:11,776 --> 00:58:14,574
Once you do
there's no turning back.

864
00:58:14,612 --> 00:58:16,477
I'm about to die,
oh my God.

865
00:58:16,514 --> 00:58:20,712
Whoever finds this tape, please post it
on YouTube so I don't die in vain.

866
00:58:20,752 --> 00:58:22,947
(screaming)

867
00:58:22,987 --> 00:58:25,455
(werewolf growling)

868
00:58:34,899 --> 00:58:37,459
(thunder rumbles)

869
00:58:40,238 --> 00:58:42,365
- What are you doing?
- Protecting ourselves,

870
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:45,433
assuming everything they taught us
in chemistry wasn't complete bullshit.

871
00:58:48,813 --> 00:58:51,077
Last night at the party there was
a hatch to the street.

872
00:58:51,115 --> 00:58:53,379
Maybe we can find it again from
the basement and get out of here.

873
00:58:57,956 --> 00:59:00,857
Thank you, Will,
for before.

874
00:59:02,126 --> 00:59:03,821
You would have done
the same for me.

875
00:59:08,032 --> 00:59:10,000
I'd like to think you'd have
done the same for me.

876
00:59:16,474 --> 00:59:18,465
Look, in case something happens,

877
00:59:18,509 --> 00:59:20,841
you think I never saw you,
but I did.

878
00:59:20,879 --> 00:59:23,973
I saw you drawing those pictures.

879
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:28,442
You made me feel beautiful
on days that weren't.

880
00:59:30,989 --> 00:59:32,786
I could have said something
but I didn't

881
00:59:32,824 --> 00:59:37,056
because I thought whatever image
you had of me was better than who I was.

882
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:50,765
What are we supposed
to do with that?

883
01:00:48,032 --> 01:00:50,057
(Elliana gasps)

884
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:33,407
Elliana:
This can't be real.

885
01:01:38,483 --> 01:01:40,781
What are they doing
with all these people?

886
01:01:40,818 --> 01:01:43,719
How long have they been
collecting them?

887
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:50,627
- (gasps)
- Elliana.

888
01:01:51,629 --> 01:01:54,792
Where's my light?
Where's my light? Where's my light?

889
01:01:57,769 --> 01:02:00,397
(whimpering)

890
01:02:01,973 --> 01:02:03,964
Kathryn:
Hello, son.

891
01:02:06,744 --> 01:02:11,010
Dad? What is this?
What's going on?

892
01:02:11,049 --> 01:02:15,008
He's outgrown his usefulness
to you, my boy.

893
01:02:15,053 --> 01:02:17,180
It's my turn.

894
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,716
You're one of us now.

895
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:29,324
Kill him.

896
01:02:31,502 --> 01:02:32,662
Do it!

897
01:02:37,108 --> 01:02:38,473
No.

898
01:02:41,312 --> 01:02:43,212
I'd rather die
than become one of you.

899
01:02:43,247 --> 01:02:45,181
Oh?

900
01:02:58,329 --> 01:03:00,229
- (cracks)
- No!

901
01:03:05,269 --> 01:03:08,568
Nothing and no one
can hold you back anymore.

902
01:03:08,606 --> 01:03:10,665
I'll never kill a human.

903
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,209
But you already have.

904
01:03:18,116 --> 01:03:20,209
You killed Roland.

905
01:03:21,252 --> 01:03:25,188
I was there.
It was impressive.

906
01:03:26,657 --> 01:03:30,149
The only question is was it because
he was trying to kill you

907
01:03:30,194 --> 01:03:33,823
or because he had
something you wanted?

908
01:03:33,865 --> 01:03:35,992
Will?

909
01:03:47,612 --> 01:03:49,637
What have I done?

910
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,910
You are your impulses now.

911
01:03:51,949 --> 01:03:55,407
No need to distinguish,
no need for control or guilt.

912
01:03:55,453 --> 01:03:58,422
Yeah.

913
01:03:58,456 --> 01:04:00,617
Just let go.

914
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:04,724
Get out of here now.

915
01:04:04,762 --> 01:04:06,252
What about you?

916
01:04:06,297 --> 01:04:07,821
Just go!

917
01:04:07,865 --> 01:04:09,628
Wait for the campus
to unlock without me.

918
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:12,033
- You can't stay here with them.
- It's none of your concern!

919
01:04:13,137 --> 01:04:15,298
Go. Go.

920
01:04:15,339 --> 01:04:18,570
Run away, little girl.

921
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,784
Welcome to the family.

922
01:04:40,097 --> 01:04:42,258
What do you want to do first?

923
01:04:44,902 --> 01:04:47,166
(bottle clanks)

924
01:04:47,205 --> 01:04:50,140
Kill you.
Kill all of you.

925
01:04:51,676 --> 01:04:54,474
(growling)

926
01:04:54,512 --> 01:04:57,743
Will’s voice: Remember that mere 2%
that separates us from the animals?

927
01:04:57,782 --> 01:05:00,218
It's everything.

928
01:05:00,218 --> 01:05:02,277
(thunder rumbling)

929
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,312
(cawing)

930
01:05:07,959 --> 01:05:10,928
- (howling)
- Will?

931
01:05:16,467 --> 01:05:18,662
Elliana?

932
01:05:18,703 --> 01:05:20,330
Elliana!

933
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,941
Elliana?

934
01:05:33,351 --> 01:05:35,785
(whimpering)

935
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:42,655
(stifled gasp)

936
01:05:47,365 --> 01:05:50,198
- (growls)
- (screaming)

937
01:05:50,234 --> 01:05:51,496
Elliana!

938
01:05:51,535 --> 01:05:53,799
No. No!

939
01:05:58,643 --> 01:06:00,975
(roars)

940
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:16,826
(panting)

941
01:06:16,861 --> 01:06:19,489
I guess it's a good thing
you didn't win the gold.

942
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,531
Will.

943
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,663
Get away from me.

944
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:34,207
They killed my dad.
They turned me into this.

945
01:06:34,245 --> 01:06:37,737
- You're not like them.
- Yes I am!

946
01:06:37,782 --> 01:06:39,477
- You have a choice.
- No I don't.

947
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:42,281
You don't understand.
Every second I'm with you

948
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,118
is about restraint, reining myself
in because the more I want you.

949
01:06:49,994 --> 01:06:51,188
Come on.

950
01:06:51,228 --> 01:06:53,890
Will’s voice: I've always been
scared of letting anyone in.

951
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:57,367
Or maybe I've really been
scared of letting me out.

952
01:06:59,136 --> 01:07:01,468
Do what you want to do.

953
01:07:01,505 --> 01:07:03,132
What?

954
01:07:06,077 --> 01:07:09,274
Whatever it is, come on.

955
01:07:09,313 --> 01:07:11,440
Do it.

956
01:07:11,482 --> 01:07:13,541
Come on.

957
01:07:17,421 --> 01:07:19,412
You don't know what you're saying.

958
01:07:19,457 --> 01:07:22,517
Come on, Will.
Let's go.

959
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:26,220
Let it happen.

960
01:07:26,263 --> 01:07:28,595
* Come on, baby *

961
01:07:28,632 --> 01:07:30,657
* Don't fear the reaper *

962
01:07:30,701 --> 01:07:33,135
* Take my hand *

963
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:34,660
* Don't fear the reaper... *

964
01:07:34,705 --> 01:07:36,229
Are you sure?

965
01:07:36,273 --> 01:07:37,968
* We'll be able to fly *

966
01:07:38,008 --> 01:07:39,976
* Don't fear the reaper *

967
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:42,308
* Baby, I'm your man *

968
01:07:42,346 --> 01:07:44,871
* Don't fear the reaper *

969
01:07:44,915 --> 01:07:46,746
* Baby, I'm your man *

970
01:07:46,784 --> 01:07:49,218
* La la la *

971
01:07:49,253 --> 01:07:51,778
* La la... *

972
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,757
Get away from me.

973
01:07:57,795 --> 01:08:00,093
Did you ever think maybe if I was
like you that I could help you?

974
01:08:00,131 --> 01:08:02,861
- Maybe we could be a team.
- You think you could save me?

975
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,731
Huh?
Is that what you want to do?

976
01:08:04,769 --> 01:08:06,896
If you don't want
to be with me, just say it.

977
01:08:06,937 --> 01:08:10,373
That's not what I'm saying.
I just can't. You don't want this.

978
01:08:10,408 --> 01:08:14,276
Don't tell me what I want.

979
01:08:14,311 --> 01:08:16,506
What are you so afraid of?

980
01:08:16,547 --> 01:08:19,880
Or maybe the better question is
what aren't you afraid of?

981
01:08:19,917 --> 01:08:22,715
You've been living
in your safe little world

982
01:08:22,753 --> 01:08:24,380
where everybody
tells you what to do

983
01:08:24,422 --> 01:08:26,617
and you're too scared
to do anything about it.

984
01:08:26,657 --> 01:08:28,249
Yeah well, you're afraid
that you're gonna die

985
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:30,192
so I'm just another guy who's safe
to be with for the moment

986
01:08:30,227 --> 01:08:31,819
because it has zero chances
of working out.

987
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:34,422
I'm asking you
to make me like you.

988
01:08:34,465 --> 01:08:36,831
How much more of a commitment
do you need?

989
01:08:39,103 --> 01:08:43,540
I think you're afraid that if you
love me, I won't love you back.

990
01:08:45,509 --> 01:08:48,876
Yeah well, maybe you're afraid
that I will.

991
01:08:48,913 --> 01:08:50,744
Try me.

992
01:08:50,781 --> 01:08:53,045
* We can be like they are *

993
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:55,347
* So come on, baby *

994
01:08:55,386 --> 01:08:58,048
* Don't fear the reaper... *

995
01:08:58,088 --> 01:08:59,282
(grunts)

996
01:08:59,323 --> 01:09:02,292
* La la la *

997
01:09:02,326 --> 01:09:04,385
* La la... *

998
01:09:04,428 --> 01:09:07,124
- (moans)
- (heart beating)

999
01:09:08,132 --> 01:09:11,295
* La la la *

1000
01:09:11,335 --> 01:09:13,633
* La la... *

1001
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:16,231
Ah!

1002
01:09:16,273 --> 01:09:18,173
* Take my hand *

1003
01:09:18,209 --> 01:09:20,370
* Don't fear the reaper *

1004
01:09:20,411 --> 01:09:22,106
* We'll be able to fly... *

1005
01:09:22,146 --> 01:09:24,478
Leave me alone!

1006
01:09:24,515 --> 01:09:27,143
* Baby, I'm your man *

1007
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,918
* Baby, I'm your man... *

1008
01:09:31,956 --> 01:09:34,083
I'm so sorry.

1009
01:09:37,962 --> 01:09:40,192
I won't be the one who hurts you.

1010
01:09:41,532 --> 01:09:45,263
I told you, you have a choice.

1011
01:09:45,302 --> 01:09:47,998
You don't have to kill again.
You know that, right?

1012
01:09:48,038 --> 01:09:50,302
Will’s voice:
My generation,

1013
01:09:50,341 --> 01:09:52,468
we're not about commitments
and relationships.

1014
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:54,603
We're about hooking up.

1015
01:09:54,645 --> 01:09:57,512
It's like somewhere along the way
we were led to believe

1016
01:09:57,548 --> 01:10:01,951
that knowing too much about a partner
somehow makes love less exciting.

1017
01:10:03,254 --> 01:10:05,518
We were led to believe wrong.

1018
01:10:05,556 --> 01:10:07,524
Kathryn on P.A.:
Attention please.

1019
01:10:07,558 --> 01:10:09,788
Would Will Kidman
and the campus whore

1020
01:10:09,827 --> 01:10:12,295
please report
to the principal's office?

1021
01:10:12,329 --> 01:10:15,162
Thank you.

1022
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,463
Come on, we have
to get to the chapel.

1023
01:10:21,505 --> 01:10:23,996
You came from inside of me, my son.

1024
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:27,211
That's a fact and you'd better start
learning how to deal with it.

1025
01:10:28,779 --> 01:10:29,837
We have to throw off their scent.

1026
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,814
Kathryn:
There's no use fighting it.

1027
01:10:31,849 --> 01:10:34,147
Push me away,
I'll tighten my grip.

1028
01:10:34,184 --> 01:10:36,345
It's what mothers do.

1029
01:10:36,387 --> 01:10:39,413
The world as you know it
is about to change.

1030
01:10:40,891 --> 01:10:45,191
500 years ago
people knew the Earth was flat.

1031
01:10:50,067 --> 01:10:52,228
This morning everybody knew

1032
01:10:52,269 --> 01:10:54,567
that humans were at
the top of the food chain.

1033
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:03,344
My boy, that isn't food below.

1034
01:11:05,883 --> 01:11:07,544
It's an army.

1035
01:11:09,086 --> 01:11:12,055
It's coming to life as we speak.

1036
01:11:12,089 --> 01:11:14,523
And tonight
when the blue moon rises,

1037
01:11:14,558 --> 01:11:17,083
we will lead this world
into a new era.

1038
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,828
Roland's gun.

1039
01:11:27,071 --> 01:11:29,039
(werewolf growling)

1040
01:11:35,412 --> 01:11:38,506
(thunder crashing)

1041
01:11:44,388 --> 01:11:46,879
Hollow points. Perfect.

1042
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:54,789
Argentum nitricum?

1043
01:11:54,832 --> 01:11:56,891
AKA silver nitrate.

1044
01:11:59,536 --> 01:12:01,436
We have to warn people what's
happening before it's too late.

1045
01:12:01,472 --> 01:12:04,066
We can use the broadcast hack
Sachin set up.

1046
01:12:04,108 --> 01:12:05,507
They won't believe us.

1047
01:12:05,542 --> 01:12:07,032
They'll think it's just a couple
of kids playing a joke.

1048
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:08,408
That's why we have to
make them believe.

1049
01:12:08,445 --> 01:12:10,310
How?

1050
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:15,175
I'm gonna turn into one.

1051
01:12:17,187 --> 01:12:19,018
You might need this

1052
01:12:20,824 --> 01:12:23,588
in case I'm not strong enough
to come back.

1053
01:12:28,799 --> 01:12:30,096
Let's do this.

1054
01:12:31,301 --> 01:12:33,735
I don't want to lose you,

1055
01:12:33,771 --> 01:12:37,207
even though I feel like I've been
seriously damaged

1056
01:12:37,241 --> 01:12:39,141
by this relationship.

1057
01:12:39,176 --> 01:12:41,474
(both laugh)

1058
01:12:47,317 --> 01:12:49,148
It's graduation time.

1059
01:12:49,186 --> 01:12:51,950
(''Pomp and Circumstance''
playing)

1060
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:12,906
(exhales)

1061
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:22,883
Hey hey.
Hey, look.

1062
01:13:24,655 --> 01:13:28,716
I need you to be strong
and stay with me

1063
01:13:28,759 --> 01:13:31,990
because you're the one

1064
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:34,463
who's gonna have to kill me.

1065
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:40,534
* I will keep the bad things
from you *

1066
01:13:40,571 --> 01:13:44,905
* I will love you
like no other *

1067
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:48,673
* I will be your dad and mother *

1068
01:13:48,712 --> 01:13:52,614
* I will give you older brothers *

1069
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:56,608
* I will keep your smile
from falling *

1070
01:13:56,653 --> 01:14:00,646
* I will keep the price
below cost *

1071
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:05,094
* I will lead the way
when all is lost *

1072
01:14:08,499 --> 01:14:10,194
* Catch it while you can *

1073
01:14:10,234 --> 01:14:13,499
* It's the feel-good hit
of the summer *

1074
01:14:16,807 --> 01:14:18,434
* Catch it while you can *

1075
01:14:18,475 --> 01:14:22,241
* 'Cause there won't be another *

1076
01:14:22,279 --> 01:14:26,773
* Won't be another *

1077
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:32,518
* I will keep the bad things
from you. *

1078
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:35,419
(beeping)

1079
01:14:35,459 --> 01:14:37,552
Sorry, Will.

1080
01:14:37,594 --> 01:14:40,392
The evolution will not be televised.

1081
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,231
Who the hell are you

1082
01:14:45,269 --> 01:14:47,203
to warn people about us?

1083
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:54,366
Fellow graduates,

1084
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:57,209
let's not let it rain on our parade.

1085
01:15:02,653 --> 01:15:04,416
I want to love you.

1086
01:15:04,454 --> 01:15:07,685
Really, I do.

1087
01:15:09,293 --> 01:15:11,989
But you're making it so

1088
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:15,795
incredibly difficult.

1089
01:15:17,901 --> 01:15:21,098
We admit it, we're scared.

1090
01:15:21,138 --> 01:15:24,699
We always hear how there's still
so many things that we don't know,

1091
01:15:24,741 --> 01:15:27,972
but I'd like to think that we know
more than you think.

1092
01:15:29,346 --> 01:15:31,940
We just haven't summoned it yet.

1093
01:15:31,982 --> 01:15:34,746
Why would you even try
to save those people?

1094
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:38,414
Those people that have made your life
nothing but miserable all these years?

1095
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:42,116
Because I'm not like you.

1096
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:53,029
Imagine how disappointed I am

1097
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:55,800
after 18 years to find out you're...

1098
01:15:57,841 --> 01:15:59,934
so ordinary.

1099
01:15:59,977 --> 01:16:03,504
Imagine how disappointed
I am to find out that you're not.

1100
01:16:03,547 --> 01:16:06,414
Certainly there are lessons
yet to be learned

1101
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:08,179
as we leave high school behind.

1102
01:16:08,218 --> 01:16:11,813
But let me share with you
a few I've learned already.

1103
01:16:13,724 --> 01:16:17,023
Clearly the girl has clouded
your judgment.

1104
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:19,790
You might not thank me now
for getting rid of her,

1105
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:21,821
but trust me,

1106
01:16:21,865 --> 01:16:23,230
one day you will.

1107
01:16:26,236 --> 01:16:28,363
Never look back.

1108
01:16:28,405 --> 01:16:30,202
Behind you!

1109
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,572
- (gunshot)
- (roars)

1110
01:16:32,609 --> 01:16:34,634
That which doesn't kill us

1111
01:16:34,678 --> 01:16:38,205
- makes us stronger.
- (grunts)

1112
01:16:38,248 --> 01:16:41,843
At the end of every dark tunnel
is a light.

1113
01:16:43,453 --> 01:16:45,853
(roars)

1114
01:16:48,425 --> 01:16:51,326
When one door closes,
another opens.

1115
01:16:58,035 --> 01:17:00,003
- Come on.
- (growling)

1116
01:17:08,312 --> 01:17:10,974
Elliana, come on.
Come on, Elliana.

1117
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:18,610
We've come this far.
Come on, Elliana, come on!

1118
01:17:21,625 --> 01:17:24,185
Come on, don't go.
Don't go.

1119
01:17:24,227 --> 01:17:26,286
Don't go!

1120
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:29,860
Wake up!
Come on!

1121
01:17:31,368 --> 01:17:33,393
Come on, fight.

1122
01:17:41,545 --> 01:17:44,878
Come on, Elliana.
Breathe. Breathe!

1123
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,881
Come on.
Come on.

1124
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:53,888
You'd never let go.
Don't you dare let go.

1125
01:18:00,163 --> 01:18:02,654
I can't live without you, Elliana.
Come on.

1126
01:18:02,699 --> 01:18:04,257
Come on, Elliana.

1127
01:18:08,138 --> 01:18:10,299
(gasps)

1128
01:18:15,512 --> 01:18:17,912
- Hi.
- You're alive.

1129
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:23,542
- (screams)
- No!

1130
01:18:23,587 --> 01:18:25,714
Will Kidman.

1131
01:18:28,759 --> 01:18:30,989
Will Kidman?

1132
01:18:41,471 --> 01:18:43,200
(gunshot)

1133
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,834
(werewolf howling)

1134
01:18:53,483 --> 01:18:56,384
Elliana!

1135
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,513
Elliana Winter.

1136
01:19:00,524 --> 01:19:02,754
Elliana Winter?

1137
01:19:06,863 --> 01:19:09,297
Elliana!
Elliana!

1138
01:19:13,503 --> 01:19:16,063
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you

1139
01:19:16,106 --> 01:19:18,574
this year's graduating class.

1140
01:19:18,608 --> 01:19:21,372
(cheering, applauding)

1141
01:19:24,881 --> 01:19:26,576
Bravo, Will.

1142
01:19:26,616 --> 01:19:28,709
You've got more potential
than I thought.

1143
01:19:28,752 --> 01:19:32,051
You're alive. How?

1144
01:19:32,089 --> 01:19:34,148
Oh, honey,

1145
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:37,592
it's gonna take a lot more
than a little fire to get rid of me.

1146
01:19:37,627 --> 01:19:39,595
It's a cruel world

1147
01:19:39,629 --> 01:19:43,759
and the only morality in a cruel world
is every being for themselves.

1148
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,497
Even if you win this battle,
you lose the war.

1149
01:19:47,537 --> 01:19:50,938
There are thousands of other armies
out there just like ours.

1150
01:19:50,974 --> 01:19:53,704
So why resist?
There's nothing you can do.

1151
01:19:53,743 --> 01:19:55,574
I know it's hard to swallow.

1152
01:19:58,882 --> 01:20:00,850
Swallow this!

1153
01:20:02,352 --> 01:20:04,820
(coughing, gagging)

1154
01:20:09,059 --> 01:20:10,526
(swallows)

1155
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,755
(laughs)

1156
01:20:12,796 --> 01:20:14,730
(growls)

1157
01:20:14,764 --> 01:20:16,959
You're the alpha.

1158
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,332
You're damn right I am.

1159
01:20:20,837 --> 01:20:23,806
And now I'm gonna do to you what
I should have done 18 years ago--

1160
01:20:25,976 --> 01:20:27,568
abort you.

1161
01:20:29,212 --> 01:20:30,770
Why?

1162
01:20:30,814 --> 01:20:32,975
'Cause your boy likes his girlfriend
better than Mommy?

1163
01:20:33,016 --> 01:20:35,314
(growling)

1164
01:20:39,589 --> 01:20:40,988
(grunts)

1165
01:20:43,293 --> 01:20:45,022
(roars)

1166
01:20:48,498 --> 01:20:50,830
What, you jealous?
You pissed off?

1167
01:20:50,867 --> 01:20:52,801
Hell, that makes you
the most human one here.

1168
01:20:52,836 --> 01:20:54,463
(roars)

1169
01:20:55,672 --> 01:20:57,230
(grunts)

1170
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:06,180
(heart beating)

1171
01:21:06,216 --> 01:21:08,309
(groaning)

1172
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:16,050
(growling)

1173
01:21:21,364 --> 01:21:23,889
(growling, roaring)

1174
01:22:44,748 --> 01:22:44,781
(growling)

1175
01:22:44,781 --> 01:22:47,113
(growling)

1176
01:22:53,657 --> 01:22:56,592
Go ahead.
Put me out of your misery.

1177
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:01,055
(shrieks)

1178
01:23:04,467 --> 01:23:06,230
(growls)

1179
01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:20,112
(growling)

1180
01:23:22,652 --> 01:23:24,142
Will:
What have I done?

1181
01:23:32,929 --> 01:23:34,419
Elliana?

1182
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:38,597
You're in there somewhere.

1183
01:23:38,635 --> 01:23:40,364
It's hard.

1184
01:23:40,403 --> 01:23:43,668
I know what you're feeling.

1185
01:23:43,707 --> 01:23:46,335
So if you can't come back,

1186
01:23:46,376 --> 01:23:47,843
then kill me.

1187
01:23:47,877 --> 01:23:51,438
Because the only way I'm walking
out of here is together.

1188
01:23:51,481 --> 01:23:54,245
But you have a choice.

1189
01:23:54,284 --> 01:23:57,253
You know that, right?

1190
01:23:57,287 --> 01:23:59,255
Come on.

1191
01:24:25,915 --> 01:24:27,348
(heart beating)

1192
01:24:42,766 --> 01:24:45,030
Here.

1193
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:49,134
(laughs)

1194
01:24:50,173 --> 01:24:52,164
Will.

1195
01:25:18,768 --> 01:25:20,497
* The book of love *

1196
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:23,404
* Is long and boring *

1197
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,204
* No one can lift *

1198
01:25:26,242 --> 01:25:28,870
* The damn thing *

1199
01:25:28,912 --> 01:25:31,608
* It's full of charts *

1200
01:25:31,648 --> 01:25:35,175
* And facts and figures *

1201
01:25:35,218 --> 01:25:39,450
* And instructions
for dancing *

1202
01:25:39,489 --> 01:25:44,927
* But I *

1203
01:25:44,961 --> 01:25:47,486
* I love it *

1204
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:50,431
* When you read to me *

1205
01:25:50,467 --> 01:25:56,030
* And you *

1206
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:01,136
* You can read me anything *

1207
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:06,638
* The book of love
has music in it *

1208
01:26:07,784 --> 01:26:12,244
* In fact, that's where
music comes from... *

1209
01:26:12,288 --> 01:26:14,119
Will's voice:
Most of us don't have the option

1210
01:26:14,157 --> 01:26:17,649
of waking to eternal life
or experiencing undying romance.

1211
01:26:17,694 --> 01:26:20,492
Our lives and loves
are painfully finite.

1212
01:26:25,034 --> 01:26:27,525
But maybe that's how it should be.

1213
01:26:27,570 --> 01:26:31,097
Because the parts of the human
condition that we suffer from most

1214
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:34,041
are the very things
that make us what we are.

1215
01:26:34,077 --> 01:26:37,945
* And you... *

1216
01:26:37,981 --> 01:26:40,347
Will’s voice: We appreciate time
because of our lack of it.

1217
01:26:40,383 --> 01:26:43,875
* You can sing me anything *

1218
01:26:45,421 --> 01:26:46,979
* The book of love... *

1219
01:26:47,023 --> 01:26:50,789
Will’s voice: We're sensitive
because of our vulnerability.

1220
01:26:50,827 --> 01:26:53,523
We're compassionate
because of our dependence.

1221
01:26:56,232 --> 01:26:57,859
* It's full of flowers... *

1222
01:26:57,901 --> 01:27:00,836
Will’s voice:
And while we can all be monsters...

1223
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:05,898
* And things we're all
too young to know... *

1224
01:27:07,911 --> 01:27:10,038
Will’s voice:
...we're always at our most monstrous

1225
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:11,842
when we ignore our humanity.

1226
01:27:25,395 --> 01:27:28,091
(roaring, howling)

1227
01:27:31,067 --> 01:27:32,932
(window shatters)

1228
01:27:32,969 --> 01:27:34,766
(bodies thud)

1229
01:27:34,804 --> 01:27:38,740
(students murmuring)

1230
01:27:38,775 --> 01:27:42,211
- (explosion)
- (students screaming)

1231
01:27:43,947 --> 01:27:45,915
Will’s voice:
Our teachers and parents like to say

1232
01:27:45,949 --> 01:27:48,679
we're witnessing the decline
of Western civilization.

1233
01:27:48,718 --> 01:27:51,619
Sure, these are trying times.

1234
01:27:51,654 --> 01:27:55,420
But when we begin to lose ourselves
in routine or fear or tragedy,

1235
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:57,858
I think we can always
find our way back.

1236
01:27:57,894 --> 01:28:01,125
We just need to remember
that our obligations to one another,

1237
01:28:01,164 --> 01:28:03,826
our relationships to one another,

1238
01:28:03,866 --> 01:28:06,630
these things don't exist
only to fill up our days.

1239
01:28:06,669 --> 01:28:09,103
They exist to save our lives.

1240
01:28:09,138 --> 01:28:11,470
And these things
are worth fighting for.

1241
01:28:13,009 --> 01:28:15,068
''It's a whole new world.''

1242
01:28:15,111 --> 01:28:17,705
''The future begins here.''

1243
01:28:17,747 --> 01:28:19,647
(chuckles)

1244
01:28:19,682 --> 01:28:22,742
You people have no fucking idea.

1245
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:28,319
* You are to give me *

1246
01:28:28,358 --> 01:28:31,589
* A wedding ring. *

1247
01:28:34,998 --> 01:28:36,989
(growling)

1248
01:28:37,033 --> 01:28:39,593
- Two three four.

1249
01:28:46,075 --> 01:28:48,043
Will: I need you to be strong
and stay with me...

1250
01:28:48,077 --> 01:28:51,137
Hey, man, do you think this is real?

1251
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:53,876
...because you're the one

1252
01:28:53,916 --> 01:28:55,907
who's going to have to kill me.

1253
01:28:55,952 --> 01:29:00,514
Nah, it looks like viral marketing
for some movie.

1254
01:29:02,425 --> 01:29:05,155
* It never really costs that much *

1255
01:29:05,194 --> 01:29:07,958
* If you consider the return... *

1256
01:29:07,997 --> 01:29:12,457
Will on TV: And now, 18 years
after the day I was born,

1257
01:29:12,502 --> 01:29:16,461
I'm here to convince you
that the monsters are real,

1258
01:29:16,506 --> 01:29:18,633
that they live among us,

1259
01:29:18,675 --> 01:29:20,836
within us.

1260
01:29:20,877 --> 01:29:24,506
And hopefully one day
you'll know who I was

1261
01:29:24,547 --> 01:29:26,378
and what I tried to do.

1262
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:31,547
* And it's my favorite revolution *

1263
01:29:32,555 --> 01:29:37,857
* It's my favorite revolution *

1264
01:29:37,894 --> 01:29:41,330
* It's my favorite *

1265
01:29:41,364 --> 01:29:42,991
* Favorite *

1266
01:29:43,032 --> 01:29:46,729
* Favorite revolution... *

1267
01:29:49,539 --> 01:29:52,474
Will on TV:
Please listen to me.

1268
01:29:52,508 --> 01:29:56,035
I need you to gather
all the silver and fire...

1269
01:29:56,079 --> 01:29:58,274
(breathing heavily)

1270
01:29:58,314 --> 01:30:01,943
...and kill them
before it's too late.

1271
01:30:01,984 --> 01:30:04,384
- (people screaming)
- (roars)

1272
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:07,651
* Revolution *

1273
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:20,295
* Now it's all updated *

1274
01:30:20,336 --> 01:30:23,635
* Plastic and laser beams... *

1275
01:30:23,673 --> 01:30:25,300
Reporter:
Police stations and authorities

1276
01:30:25,341 --> 01:30:27,002
are being flooded with werewolf--

1277
01:30:27,043 --> 01:30:30,103
yes, werewolf-- sightings
on four continents.

1278
01:30:30,146 --> 01:30:32,740
Officials are currently
assessing the situation

1279
01:30:32,782 --> 01:30:36,650
and asking people to stay indoors
until further notice.

1280
01:30:36,686 --> 01:30:40,122
* I'll make you famous,
sweet revenge *

1281
01:30:40,156 --> 01:30:42,056
* Will come in time *

1282
01:30:42,091 --> 01:30:44,889
* Where would we be without them? *

1283
01:30:44,927 --> 01:30:47,691
* Thank God we'll never know *

1284
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:50,824
* We're safe and sound
as angels *

1285
01:30:50,867 --> 01:30:53,836
* When it's loud we dance slow *

1286
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:58,933
* And it's my favorite revolution... *

1287
01:31:00,276 --> 01:31:01,641
Reporter:
People are panicking,

1288
01:31:01,677 --> 01:31:03,474
gathering silver and firearms

1289
01:31:03,513 --> 01:31:06,607
as military troops around the globe
are mobilizing.

1290
01:31:06,649 --> 01:31:10,380
(static)
...attacks leaving thousands of victims.

1291
01:31:10,419 --> 01:31:14,378
* Favorite revolution... *

1292
01:31:28,504 --> 01:31:31,337
(werewolves howling)

1293
01:31:39,615 --> 01:31:45,110
* It's my favorite revolution *

1294
01:31:46,122 --> 01:31:48,682

1295
01:31:48,724 --> 01:31:50,316

* Favorite... *

1297
01:31:52,094 --> 01:31:54,528
Do you believe us now?

1298
01:31:54,564 --> 01:31:57,863
* Drop the needle,
there's a song to be sung *

1299
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,834
* When the tables turn, baby *

1300
01:31:59,869 --> 01:32:04,101
* It's my favorite revolution. *
