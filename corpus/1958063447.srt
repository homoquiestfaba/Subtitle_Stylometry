00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,772
<i>There's a land of the living</i>

3
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,675
<i>And the bridge is love.</i>

4
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:45,245
<i>The only survival,</i>
<i>the only meaning.</i>

5
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:53,387
<i>We were closer than family,</i>
<i>as children playing together,</i>

6
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,491
<i> sharing our secrets and hopes,</i>
<i>a day would feel like a year</i>

7
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,192

8
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,396

10
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:12,574

13
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,759

Thank you so much for coming.

47
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,940
- Oh, Maggie.

48
00:06:12,974 --> 00:06:14,842
So glad to see you.

49
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,979
Close this door, oh its cold.

50
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:19,780
It's mom's coat.

51
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:21,782
- Well I'm just
inhabiting the coat.

52
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:23,751
- Well I'm very grateful
to you for coming,

53
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,452
cause there's an
awful lot of work.

54
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,153
- Happy to do it.

55
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,955
- Hey Aspen.

56
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,992
Oh buddy.

57
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:40,935
Yeah.

58
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:43,137
Oh, oh, oh.

59
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:45,873
You are hungry.

60
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:47,708
Another one?

61
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,812
- Oh God, Rheza.

62
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,214
- I'm so sorry I'm a bit dirty.

63
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,516
- Oh, come here,
come in that's fine.

64
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,184
- We had an
emergency at the zoo.

65
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,452
- Oh dear.
- Didn't wanna be late.

66
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:00,888
- Do you wanna go in
and then get warm

67
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:02,156
and get your coat off and...

68
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:02,857
- Thanks Shelley.

69
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,192
We're supposed to think of this?

70
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:07,028
We're supposed to know
what she's talking about?

71
00:07:07,061 --> 00:07:10,765
- <i>Look at them,</i>
<i>my friends, my family.</i>

72
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,466
- I remember always around this
table doing plays with her.

73
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,769
We did wonderful.

74
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:17,171
- <i>Shelley was never</i>
<i>really part of our group.</i>

75
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:21,676
<i>Probably my fault, not</i>
<i>wanting my kid sister around,</i>

76
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,210
<i>but when our mother died,</i>

77
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:26,180
<i>my friends</i>
<i>immediately reached out.</i>

78
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:29,917
<i>It's been 25 years since</i>
<i>they've all been together.</i>

79
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,853
<i>It was my funeral.</i>

80
00:07:32,887 --> 00:07:34,088
- Natalie was like that too.

81
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,690
- Like mother, like daughter.

82
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,825
- Remember Natalie
playing ping pong?

83
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,560
- She was ferocious.

84
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,028
- Hello?

85
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,498
- Love, oh my God.
- Nice to see you.

86
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,567
- Oh my gosh Hannah.

87
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,601
- Did you bring food?

88
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:48,736
- I brought some veggies.

89
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,004
- Oh what do you have here?

90
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,939
- Do you need help getting
that in the kitchen?

91
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:53,674
- No I'll be fine I'll
be right back.

92
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,646
- I remember sitting
at this table.

93
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,182
- We had so many fun times.

94
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,116
- Yeah.

95
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,684
- It was so fun remember that?

96
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:04,852
- I can't believe I forgot.

97
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,154
- Midsummers night,

98
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:09,056
- "Through the forest,
have I gone."

99
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,726
- I remember your mom
helping me with an audition

100
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,296
for the high school production
of the Scottish play.

101
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,299
"Out out damn spot!"

102
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,201
Rage!

103
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:24,638
She is raging and I was
like "she is raging".

104
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,074
Remember that?

105
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:29,577
- How do you get younger?

106
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,277
- Me?

107
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:31,012
- Every year.

108
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:31,879
- Oh that's nice.

109
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,881
- I'm really starting
to resent this.

110
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:37,051
- Oh gosh in this
drawer right there

111
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,319
I found something for you guys.

112
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,220
- What, over here?

113
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,956
- Yeah in that drawer.
- The top, okay.

114
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,157
- Were you talking about this?

115
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,692
- Yes those.
- All right.

116
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,993
- That's for you.

117
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,095
- Yeah, what are these here?

118
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,799
These are birthday
cards for Natalie.

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,970
- Happy birthday Natalie.

120
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,139
- I'm wearing this hat.

121
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:00,241
- We gave her these on
her fortieth.

122
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,343
- I didn't mean to
bring up a bummer.

123
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,812
- No it's just so sweet.

124
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,680
- Love.
- Beautiful.

125
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,015
- So wonderful.

126
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,950
- But that she kept them.
- Oh, my God.

127
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:12,153
- Your mother had
things of yours?

128
00:09:12,953 --> 00:09:16,190
- No, but I'm still
here, so it's different.

129
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,092
I don't know what it's
like to lose a child,

130
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,662
I just know what it's like
to be the one left behind.

131
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:26,834
- It's kind of who I see here.

132
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:31,038
I mean, I can't bring us
into our present.

133
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:34,775
♪ Could it be a faded rose ♪

134
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:41,615
- I keep talking to, who we
were, that's always here.

135
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,785
- Isn't it so odd though,
about getting older,

136
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,856
doesn't it just feel like
we're still inside the same.

137
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:49,757
- Exactly.
- I feel like...

138
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,092
- Exactly.

139
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,360
- I'm still struggling
with the same, yeah though.

140
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:55,663
My mother calls it the
organ recital.

141
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:56,831
- Yeah.

142
00:09:56,864 --> 00:10:00,000
- You go around and say,
what's wrong like I have a hip,

143
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,770
I have a shoulder,
I have a heart.

144
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,338
- If I only had a brain.

145
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,848
- Before I found photography,
I probably made a big mistake

146
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:17,651
choosing a profession that
was my mother's. Commercials.

147
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,820
Yeah I just did commercials
because I had to pay

148
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:23,157
for trying to do theater,
which didn't work out too well.

149
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,126
- I work with seniors,
I take them to,

150
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,227
their appointments and stuff

151
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,094
but I also bring them to
the library cause we have

152
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:29,864
a lot of great classes
and like that.

153
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:30,364
- Well that's wonderful.

154
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:30,431
- Yeah it's great.

155
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,166
- Keeps your mind.

156
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:35,970
- And keeps me feeling young,
which is the important thing.

157
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,338
- But you look.

158
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,807
- I'm not as sick as that
person, oh no.

159
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,179
- What I might like to do,
which is to work with the dying.

160
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,747
- Really?

161
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,381
- Yeah I might.

162
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:48,249
- You didn't tell me that.

163
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:52,286
- Well it's, we are at
that age where,

164
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,756
all of us are searching,
it's a natural time.

165
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,760
Am I this, am I that, yes
and nuns do that as well.

166
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:03,797
So I'm thinking of
working in hospice.

167
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,066
- I wanna say this to you.

168
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,070
- Is that, well,
- The best comedic nun,

169
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:10,971
I've ever known.

170
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:13,207
- No I wanna try to explain.

171
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,810
Your mother gave me
the privilege of having

172
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:20,848
to preside, to enjoy,
to collaborate with her

173
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:26,187
during her death, her dying,
which was for me...

174
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,722
profound.

175
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,793
I need to tell you that,
that she, what you,

176
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:38,732
it was because we know
Ruth had many flaws.

177
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:42,203
She was very human and,
but you know, death is,

178
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:43,337
it doesn't have to be
for most people.

179
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,941
But with her, it was courageous,
she caught the light.

180
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:52,746
- Well, Ruth never had any
trouble finding her light.

181
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:57,952
- Like this.

182
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:01,355
- I'm not hearing a
thing from Lizzie.

183
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,924
Your sister's not coming,
should we start packing?

184
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,025
- Lets go, let do our packing.

185
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,126
- Maggie don't take the coat.

186
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,094
Please don't take the coat.

187
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,797
Respect the animal, let's not,
let's not-.

188
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,367
- I understand, but this is dead
already now what do you do?

189
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,468
- Understand the dying.

190
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:19,306
- I wanna just inject, like
it is, sometimes things

191
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,177
carry a person's spirit
and soul, and this vibrant

192
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,447
- Oh my God, looks like,
- is a Ruth thing.

193
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:30,985
- Doorbell, oh wait a minute
there's somebody at the door.

194
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,522
Oh it's come on it's Nat,
come on.

195
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,026
- I like the coat.

196
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:39,960
- I know.

197
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:41,862
- Hi Natalie.

198
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,264
- Hi.

199
00:12:43,297 --> 00:12:44,832
- I'm Shelley.

200
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:45,533
- Hi Shelley.

201
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,101
- You're named after my sister.

202
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,837
So nice to have you
here, thank you so much.

203
00:12:51,472 --> 00:12:52,373
- Hi.

204
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:58,045
- Hi Val you look amazing.

205
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,581
- Good to see you guys.

206
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,849
- Well, let's get you
something to drink

207
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:04,451
and get your coat off and
then get back to work.

208
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:05,386
- I'm here to help though.

209
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:06,820
- Yes, here we go.

210
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,924
- Lizzie where are you?

211
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:12,960
<i>- Where am I?</i>

212
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:13,762
- Yeah.

213
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:15,462
- Well I'm home,
where should I be?

214
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,266
<i>- Are you kidding me,</i>
<i>you're home?</i>

215
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,268
- Yeah I'm home with the kids.

216
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,437
- You're supposed to be here.

217
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,839
We're at Ruth's, we're
going through all her stuff.

218
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,041
<i>You're, you're supposed to</i>
<i>be here everybody's waiting.</i>

219
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,075
- Oh my God.

220
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,843
- You're home, oh my God.

221
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,413
<i>- Oh my God, Val please</i>
<i>don't do this to me again.</i>

222
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:36,250
I told you I couldn't get up
there, I have too much to do.

223
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:37,519
<i>This is a setup.</i>

224
00:13:37,552 --> 00:13:41,556
- Okay so how are you,
how's it going?

225
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:42,956
How's your new girlfriend?
<i>- Normal.</i>

226
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,058
- How's your girlfriend?

227
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:45,926
- My partner? Great.

228
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,929
Everything's great, everything's
normal. All is going well.

229
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,298
- Okay great wonderful.

230
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:53,967
So did you get your
check this month?

231
00:13:55,537 --> 00:14:00,007
- Val can we not with this,
can we not you know, no.

232
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,876
No,I didn't get the check this
month surprise you know that.

233
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,278
- Really you didn't
get it from those guys?

234
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,312
<i>- You know I didn't get it.</i>

235
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:07,247
- I'm telling you there's
something wrong there.

236
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,315
There something wrong
with those people.

237
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,249
<i>- No. Val.</i>

238
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:12,554
- There's something suspicious,
I really.

239
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:15,623
- It's from you, it's you
that didn't send me a check.

240
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:18,025
<i>It's you, you are in charge</i>
<i>of sending the check.</i>

241
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:21,095
- It's what mom wanted honey
what do you want me to do?

242
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,963
It's what mom wanted,
she wanted me

243
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,668
to be the executor of her
estate, she wanted that.

244
00:14:26,701 --> 00:14:30,270
And hmm, I wonder why? I
wonder why she thought that

245
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,539
maybe possibly you weren't

246
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:35,209
responsible enough to
handle your own money.

247
00:14:35,242 --> 00:14:36,578
<i>I wonder where I</i>
<i>could be thinking</i>

248
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:38,312
<i>that maybe you still</i>
<i>have this problem?</i>

249
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,214
Or was it the time that
you missed the plane

250
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,349
and didn't make it to
dad's funeral?

251
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:45,386
Could that have possibly
been the reason that, geez.

252
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,255
<i>- I understand I am not</i>
<i>a trustworthy person.</i>

253
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,524
<i>I was rebellious, I was</i>
<i>this and that.</i>

254
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:51,291
<i>This is many, many,</i>
<i>many years ago.</i>

255
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:54,428
I have a family I have
a career, I have a life.

256
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:57,965
<i>The person who thinks I'm</i>
<i>not responsible is you now.</i>

257
00:15:03,638 --> 00:15:04,639
- How's-

258
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:06,073
How's Lucas?

259
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,108
- We actually broke up so,

260
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:11,211
hopefully he's doing
wonderfully.

261
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:15,550
- I'm so sorry, sweetie,
what happened?

262
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,587
- He said that he
wanted to have kids.

263
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:23,357
So that was pretty much
the end of that.

264
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,159
- You never wanna have kids?

265
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,029
Well I mean I think
you're a little young

266
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:32,634
to making a big decision
about your whole life.

267
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:35,002
You just, I mean,
no one can really.

268
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:40,374
- I don't like wanna do
this whole thing.

269
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:44,978
Like cute little cups,
mom home cooking,

270
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,614
while the husband's out.

271
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:49,049
- Somehow I feel like
it's a dig at me,

272
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:53,621
but I'm sure you're not
intending to do that.

273
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,357
- Don't you wish that you
had your own thing though?

274
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,627
You know, like dad goes
out and goes to work,

275
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:03,330
I'm not here anymore,
and you just don't have,

276
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:08,603
you know, like your own
independent lifestyle.

277
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:11,038
Doesn't that bother you at all?

278
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,439
- Oh.

279
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,208
Ow.

280
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:17,545
- Doesn't it though, I mean.

281
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,213
- God, the judgment.

282
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:23,016
Is there any chance you can
just like soften a little

283
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,519
for dear old mom.

284
00:16:24,552 --> 00:16:27,722
- I wanna have a career you
gave up your would be career.

285
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:29,490
- I don't know what it
is you think you saw

286
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:32,092
between your father and
me, but we are fine.

287
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,160
There's nothing-
- Are you happy?

288
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,028
Are you happy with
your marriage?

289
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:39,500
- Like happiness is not
really like a one block thing.

290
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:42,202
It's not like you find
somebody you fall in love,

291
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:43,538
happy for the rest of your life.

292
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:46,340
Relationships, it's up
and down and up and down

293
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:50,310
and it takes a lot of fortitude
and you're putting your time

294
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:52,747
and energy into this
thing that is movable.

295
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,482
It's more like water,
it's not like a rock.

296
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,752
- That's some really
beautiful and flowery language

297
00:16:57,785 --> 00:17:01,054
to just say that you
were afraid to leave dad

298
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,055
and live your own life.

299
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:06,293
So you stayed with him
and you made me scared

300
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:08,061
of what I could become.

301
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,598
- Okay I actually can't
take this in anymore,

302
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:12,266
I can't take it in.

303
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,468
Fine, you can have your opinion

304
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:15,637
and I have my opinion about you.

305
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,172
And quite honestly, you're
on a path to be very lonely

306
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,040
in your life.

307
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,410
- Yeah I'm not speaking
to you anymore, bye.

308
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:24,779
- Yeah, fine.

309
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,191
Ugh.

310
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,193
- You weren't there in
the hospital for me,

311
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,328
when I had that,

312
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,832
when I had my mastectomy,
it really hurt me, it did.

313
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:47,334
I have to be honest with
you, it's very hurtful.

314
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,570
<i>- Oh my God, Val,</i>

315
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:50,470
I know, you're right.

316
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:52,707
- My friends were there
for me at the hospital

317
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,242
and my friends are like
sisters to me,

318
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,712
and I so you know, I'm
fine, I'm totally fine.

319
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,547
And the other person
who was there,

320
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,749
really, really there
for me was Joe.

321
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:02,884
<i>- Joe.</i>

322
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,252
He was there every single day.

323
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,588
<i>- I know.</i>

324
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:07,622
- And it made me feel
great about myself,

325
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,824
because I was very
depressed because you know,

326
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:11,793
you lose both of your breasts,

327
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,427
and you don't feel like a woman,

328
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,729
but he makes me feel
like a woman.

329
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:16,864
He knows a lot of stuff
and oh, by the way,

330
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:19,333
I just wanna tell you,
you're just gonna hate this.

331
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,101
You're going to hate this.

332
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:22,904
- She's downstairs,

333
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:25,305
criticizing me and my
relationship

334
00:18:25,339 --> 00:18:26,440
and the choices that I've made,

335
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,677
who is she to be giving me
advice really on anything,

336
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:32,379
but especially on
relationships and marriage.

337
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,148
- Don't be so quick
to judge her.

338
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,450
She loves your father.

339
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,620
Marriage is very complicated.

340
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:40,722
Really I'm not kidding.

341
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:42,189
It's, you don't.
- I believe it.

342
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,158
You have to be tolerant
of your mother.

343
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:49,831
- I think I just blew it
royally with my kid, again.

344
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:50,765
- Again?

345
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,266
- Ugh.

346
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,268
- I don't think so.

347
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,306
She's wildly unique
and wonderful.

348
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,207
- She is.

349
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,612
She's just so mad at me.

350
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,347
- She's going to
separate from you

351
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:11,919
and you have to
separate from her.

352
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:14,221
- I feel like I don't text,
I don't call,

353
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:16,390
I don't say too much,
I keep my mouth shut

354
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:17,424
and still it's like-

355
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,594
- Oh you're the perfect mother.

356
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:24,364
- I mean, I am in such a
flat line moment right now.

357
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,570
- I think it's true
probably of every mother,

358
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:31,506
that the thing you'd like
most is for your child

359
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:35,910
to like the things you like.
It would make things so simple.

360
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:38,746
But it's never true, right?

361
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,982
It's your job to be
somebody else.

362
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,417
It is, right?

363
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,987
And maybe she's having
a hard time with it,

364
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,355
but just the listen for
the love in it.

365
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,456
Listen for the love in it,

366
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,826
not the content of what
she's saying.

367
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,962
She might be getting it all
wrong, but she's trying.

368
00:19:54,996 --> 00:19:57,532
- It's so strange to feel
like you're a disappointment

369
00:19:57,565 --> 00:19:58,331
to your kid.

370
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,468
- You've been a
wonderful mother.

371
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:02,770
- I think daughters carry

372
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:04,939
terrible burdens of
their mother.

373
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,743
- The unsaid burdens, right?

374
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:11,879
- The secrets, or the regrets,

375
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:15,449
or the sacrifices of the mother.

376
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,852
Did you ever get my letter?

377
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,822
- Yeah.

378
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:25,425
I got your letter.

379
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:31,264
- Why didn't you answer me?

380
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,669
- I didn't know what to say.

381
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:42,309
You know, I'm not in
love with David

382
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:45,245
but Hannah you married him.

383
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:50,417
It's weird.

384
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,888
- It's been really
hard between us.

385
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,791
- He's not an easy guy.

386
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:03,965
- I just wish I had some way
to like answer back to him.

387
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:04,932
You know?

388
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:08,803
I feel like I'm getting
run over and I just,

389
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:13,340
I need some caustic
witticisms to kind of zing.

390
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:16,511
I can't like get it out to him.

391
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:18,646
- Yeah.

392
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,313
- God how do you do it?

393
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:21,816
- I didn't do it honey,
if I'd done it,

394
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:25,385
we'd still be together okay.

395
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:28,523
And I warned you.

396
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,928
I warned you if you didn't
know who the hell you were,

397
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:37,832
that you would wind up like
the incredible shrinking woman.

398
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:44,972
- Do you know why my dad
divorced Natalie?

399
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:51,579
- Because she
couldn't have a baby.

400
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,017
- Wow.

401
00:21:57,018 --> 00:22:01,022
- I feel like the best years
of my life are behind me.

402
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:01,956
- Oh.

403
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:03,958
- But I am,

404
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:07,862
I am super stuck.

405
00:22:09,597 --> 00:22:11,566
Starting at around
three o'clock,

406
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,600
this is my deep dark secret.

407
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:13,668
- Okay.

408
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:16,804
- I just sit on the couch
I manage to get through

409
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:21,776
to three o'clock and then
I'm just totally flat lined.

410
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:22,743
- And then?

411
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:25,746
- And then I just can't
get up from the couch.

412
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,915
I don't want David to
see me, God forbid,

413
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:30,151
Natalie ever even
knew about this.

414
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:33,855
She already thinks I'm not
accomplishing much.

415
00:22:33,888 --> 00:22:36,023
This is so not
accomplishing it's-

416
00:22:36,724 --> 00:22:38,425
- But we get up off the couch,
right?

417
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,660
- Yes.

418
00:22:39,694 --> 00:22:43,463
- And then we say I have no
idea what I'm supposed to do.

419
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:44,866
That's a big moment.

420
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,500
The "I don't know" moment.

421
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:49,604
- Yeah.

422
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:50,805
I don't know.

423
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:54,075
- I don't know either.

424
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:56,510
I just trust.

425
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:01,916
It is a spiritual issue,
it is your choice.

426
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,417
Get off the,
- I can't.

427
00:23:04,886 --> 00:23:06,721
- Get off, get off.

428
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:08,856
- Get off this couch.

429
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,857
- I got off the meds

430
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:14,028
- And I'm totally fine.
<i>- No you're foggy.</i>

431
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:17,698
No I'm not, I got off the
meds and I'm totally fine.

432
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:18,599
<i>- Can I ask,</i>

433
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,534
did you taper off the meds?

434
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:24,138
You do it with a doctor,
did you do it responsibly?

435
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:26,140
- I know I did it, I know I
tapered and don't remember

436
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,676
exactly how went, I can't
remember exactly how it went,

437
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:29,911
but I know I did it,
it happened,

438
00:23:29,944 --> 00:23:33,748
and everybody's like totally
wanting me to and get involved

439
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:35,149
in this packing,
so I have to go.

440
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:39,153
So thank you for all your,
I really appreciate it.

441
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:39,887
<i>- Val.</i>

442
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:40,955
- I love you so.

443
00:23:47,695 --> 00:23:49,897
- Hi, how's it going?

444
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:53,935
- I'm deciding whether
this is a good time

445
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:57,838
to become an oxycodone
addict, what do you think?

446
00:23:57,872 --> 00:23:58,706
I don't know what to
do with them

447
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:00,007
and you can't pour 'em
down the sink.

448
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,543
- Wow, Ruth was in
all these plays.

449
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:03,476
- You want this?

450
00:24:04,912 --> 00:24:06,881
I have enough
pictures of Natalie.

451
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:07,982
- Sure.

452
00:24:15,222 --> 00:24:16,023
- Okay.

453
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:20,661
- My sister's such a bitch.

454
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:22,997
- Whoa.

455
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:29,203
- She knows just
exactly where to hit.

456
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:31,505
- Kind of felt that way
about Natalie.

457
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:34,075
- You mean, you thought
Natalie did that to you?

458
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:35,943
She thought you did that to her.

459
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:37,778
- I don't know maybe
all sisters feel

460
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:39,513
that way about each other.

461
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:43,517
- Well, I just know that she was
worried about your

462
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:47,521
being angry or
envious or something

463
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:50,992
and just didn't seem
to ever work.

464
00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:52,293
- Well, of course I was.

465
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,996
You saw the way mom
was with her.

466
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:59,300
I mean, there's only one
picture of one of us in here.

467
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,602
- Yeah, that's kind of
how it was with me too.

468
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:04,972
I had that all that time with
my mom before Lizzie was born

469
00:25:05,006 --> 00:25:09,543
and we were a team,
my mom and I.

470
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:13,547
- Do you think that Lizzie
felt weird about her being gay

471
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:15,983
and you weren't gay and
life was harder for her?

472
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:18,719
- I think I've kind of
known about it for a while,

473
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:19,754
you know.

474
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:24,258
I think I kind of
suspected it and stuff,

475
00:25:25,026 --> 00:25:30,631
and I didn't wanna talk
about it or anything because,

476
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:32,199
I was scared of it.

477
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,768
- I can't tell mom and dad.

478
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:34,769
- No.

479
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:37,772
- So I really need you
to tell me it's alright.

480
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:43,778
- What's in here?

481
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:50,618
- Well, yeah there's a lot
of stuff that's starting to

482
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:51,819
probably, oh my God.

483
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:52,820
- Oh look at this, geez.

484
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:54,021
- That's hideous.

485
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:56,190
- No that's for me, this is
for me, let me get it on.

486
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:58,726
- You like it really?
- Yeah.

487
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,927
- I can't wear anything of hers.

488
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,695
- I could wear it to
the bull fights.

489
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:06,033
Oh, this is you.

490
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:06,934
- Oh, you think?

491
00:26:06,967 --> 00:26:08,302
- Oh yeah, well they both,

492
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:11,806
I can't believe she ever
wore those oh my God.

493
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,008
- This was a classic.
- What was she thinking?

494
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:15,976
- I think she was trying
to be Minnie Pearl.

495
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,812
- Yeah she was like.

496
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:19,780
- You know like, oh here
this is trash.

497
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:22,349
Yeah, that's not a keeper.

498
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,853
- Why did she keep coffee
in her bedroom?

499
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:29,924
- Don't open that, it's ashes,
her ashes.

500
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:31,158
- God! Ah!

501
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:35,062
- You remember when she did
that whole commercial campaign

502
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:38,099
for Monarch Coffee, it was
at the height of the 50s

503
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:40,401
they paid her so much
money to do.

504
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:40,701
It paid for this house.

505
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:41,869
- Wow.

506
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:45,873
- So she decides years ago
that she's gonna be cremated

507
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,644
and she wants her ashes
in a Monarch Coffee can.

508
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:53,214
Remember they had that
tagline, that slogan,

509
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:57,685
"The end justifies the beans."

510
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,920
- Oh God.
- Yeah.

511
00:27:21,842 --> 00:27:26,847
- Oh my gosh, my wings.

512
00:27:27,114 --> 00:27:30,084
- Now I gotta get my little
skirt going with my wings.

513
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:32,319
- Get your wing away from me.

514
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:34,288
- Sorry I'm running
into your wings.

515
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:39,727
- Oh my gosh, I think these
were mine, these marbles.

516
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,861
- Do remember playing?

517
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:44,298
- No, these were from my brain,
mom had them removed.

518
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:47,735
- Oh, check it out, our
championship paddles.

519
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:50,171
- You just figure them out,
the algorithms are on my desk.

520
00:27:50,204 --> 00:27:51,906
- What is this, A Viking Myth?

521
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:52,806
- May I sell a watch?

522
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,974
- I'd really like that one.

523
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,042
- Okay, here
you take this.

524
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:57,912
Look at this watch,
this is a very cheap watch.

525
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,080
- Okay, thank you bye.

526
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:01,782
- You end up with all the books.

527
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:04,752
- The first chapter of
David Copperfield is called,

528
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:06,187
"I am born."

529
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:07,888
- What is that?

530
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:11,492
- Can I have that when you die?

531
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:13,827
- You want
everything when I die.

532
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:15,896
- Who uses these anymore?

533
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:16,730
- Hi kids.

534
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:18,032
- We made angels.

535
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,839
- Going, going, gone.
White Christmas DVD.

536
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:28,842
- Oh,
- That's a great one.

537
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:30,444
- Yeah that's a good one.

538
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:31,513
- Sinatra Can-Can.

539
00:28:31,546 --> 00:28:32,313
- Oh.

540
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:33,380
- That's a great one.

541
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:35,749
- Oh God, we're never
gonna throw anything away.

542
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:36,784
Esther Williams?

543
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:38,052
- Oh Esther Williams.

544
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:39,053
- A Wonderful Life?

545
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:40,187
- Oh.

546
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:42,990
- That's kind of how I
thought about our little sweet

547
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:45,492
little town, when we
were growing up.

548
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:46,860
- Yes it was.

549
00:28:46,894 --> 00:28:48,896
- We had time for each other.

550
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:49,997
- Not so nice for you.

551
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,301
- What are we talking about?

552
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,437
- When I was in school,
everybody either wanted

553
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,405
to be my friend because
my mother was famous

554
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:00,307
or the teachers were
disappointed

555
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:01,909
that I wasn't Natalie.

556
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:04,445
- But it's also different
for me because growing up

557
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:07,214
in a place where people
don't look like you,

558
00:29:07,248 --> 00:29:09,116
it was pretty isolating.

559
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:12,019
- This town is very,
very, very, very white.

560
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:16,857
- It's very homogenous and
people definitely growing up

561
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,993
and kids are mean, but
people were very quick

562
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:20,494
to make me feel like the other.

563
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:23,297
When I was little, it
was the, you know, oh,

564
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,566
does the color rub off?

565
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,068
Then it evolves to when you're
an actual teenager and people

566
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:32,273
saying really offensive things
and nobody asking you to prom

567
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:36,043
because they're a target, if
they're taking the only black

568
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:37,579
girl in the class,
that kind of thing.

569
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:38,979
- Oh, I never heard that.

570
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:41,782
- I'm glad to hear about this.

571
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:46,253
We have such different
experience of life.

572
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:47,855
I mean, you know.

573
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:50,491
- Yeah, you have the privilege
to not have to see this.

574
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:53,961
- Serious ladies.

575
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:54,895
- Whoa.

576
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:57,931
- See, I got you on that one.

577
00:29:57,965 --> 00:29:58,832
- Woo!

578
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,167
Oh my God.

579
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:30,264
- Ready?

580
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:31,365
- Yeah.

581
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,001
- What? Oh so good.

582
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:35,469
- Oh sorry.

583
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:53,020
- Nice Rheza.

584
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:54,021
- Yeah.

585
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:54,955
- Oh!

586
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,668
- We only play under
the net now.

587
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:08,135
- Under the net.

588
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:33,528
- So frustrating, Charlie and
I were panting for each other.

589
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:36,698
So I mean, we were only 10, so
we probably weren't panting,

590
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:40,200
but he runs out the door, he
and his friend run out the door

591
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:42,504
and I ran after him
and I grab him

592
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:44,037
and I kiss him on the mouth.

593
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:44,972
- Oo!

594
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,940
- It was the boldest thing
I've ever done.

595
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:47,675
- That was so brave.

596
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:48,843
- It is.

597
00:31:48,877 --> 00:31:53,046
- My first kiss was from a
boy named Archie Stalemate.

598
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:56,216
I kid you not, it just happened.

599
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,317
- Yeah.

600
00:31:57,351 --> 00:32:00,020
- And to start my
period that night.

601
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:02,724
But I thought I was very, I
didn't know what was happening

602
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:04,692
and I thought it was tied
into this fact

603
00:32:04,726 --> 00:32:07,562
that I felt something
like, I got turned on.

604
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:10,964
So when I went to the
bathroom and I saw this thing,

605
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:14,736
I thought it was because
I had been bad

606
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,470
and had kissed and
gotten turned on.

607
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:19,273
So I thought something
somehow connected

608
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:21,576
guilt, shame, immediately.

609
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:21,876
- Yeah.

610
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,844
- Wow.

611
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:26,246
- I remember the first
guy that felt me up.

612
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,114
- Okay.

613
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:28,248
Second base.

614
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,317
- It was like one of those
things where it was like,

615
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:34,154
you were just sort of, it
was awful feeling me up.

616
00:32:34,188 --> 00:32:37,090
That was kind of my, me
too movement that moment.

617
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:41,195
13, 14, I didn't wanna
be felt up and I was.

618
00:32:41,228 --> 00:32:42,162
- What did you do?

619
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:44,465
- And I don't love that
I'm about to say this.

620
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:46,568
I think I just was silent.

621
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:48,670
Just like.

622
00:32:48,703 --> 00:32:50,270
- That's what most of us do.

623
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:51,773
If you could be born a
man would you be?

624
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:56,143
- No, I love being
underestimated as a woman

625
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:59,446
and then showing up and
crushing it with a smile.

626
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:00,949
- Yeah.

627
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:04,251
- And having it charm them and
scare them at the same time

628
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:07,789
and you can only do that as a
woman and I love that feeling.

629
00:33:07,822 --> 00:33:10,525
- Be nice to be able to
pee standing up though.

630
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:12,493
- So what is something
that you've never told

631
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,061
your significant other?

632
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:18,432
- Sometimes when
we're having sex,

633
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:21,134
I imagine he's like
Vladimir Putin.

634
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:23,403
- No don't.

635
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:24,304
- No, you're joking right?

636
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:25,472
- Stop.

637
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:30,177
- Are you like really, does
that make the sex better?

638
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,178
- No, no.

639
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:33,447
- Please tell me you're
making this up right?

640
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,549
- Yeah please.

641
00:33:34,582 --> 00:33:36,316
- I'm not really.
- Oh my God.

642
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,519
- I'm sorry I forgot
you were here.

643
00:33:37,552 --> 00:33:41,088
- You mean like Vladimir Putin
from Saturday Night Live?

644
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:43,591
- Let's just move along to
something else.

645
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:46,694
- So outrageous something
like Putin really?

646
00:33:46,728 --> 00:33:50,532
- It was in the early days
before all the terrible spying

647
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:52,466
on the United States of America.

648
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:54,301
- Like naked from the
waist up on the horse?

649
00:33:54,334 --> 00:33:55,269
- On the horse.

650
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:57,304
- That kinda got me.

651
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:59,741
- Yeah, that got you, yeah
it got most of Russia too.

652
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:05,212
- I never told my husband that
I wanted a lot of children.

653
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:06,113
- Oh.

654
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:10,552
- We had two children and
I felt that he,

655
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:14,254
at that point felt that
that was enough

656
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:17,592
and I didn't tell him.

657
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:21,663
- You didn't tell him that
that's an important thing

658
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:24,566
that you wanted and you, why?

659
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,134
- Because I instinctively
felt that, you know

660
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,738
he was the provider he was,
basically the,

661
00:34:30,772 --> 00:34:33,106
the one in charge of
the farm and,

662
00:34:34,776 --> 00:34:36,711
that we weren't gonna have a
huge amount of money,

663
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:38,613
that it would put a
strain on him

664
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:42,316
and that it would affect him
deeply because if he felt

665
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:47,187
at any point he was failing us,
it would kill him.

666
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,524
- You are the kindest
person in the world.

667
00:34:49,557 --> 00:34:50,525
- She is.

668
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:51,859
She so is.

669
00:34:51,893 --> 00:34:54,394
- Or maybe the most
dishonest I don't know.

670
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,295
- No.

671
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:56,564
- But I just kept it in.

672
00:34:59,466 --> 00:35:00,635
- I promise this is not a way

673
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:02,537
to get out of cleaning up,
but I need to-

674
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,905
I wanna take Natalie
upstairs for a second

675
00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:05,673
I have something I
have to give you.

676
00:35:05,707 --> 00:35:06,774
- Okay.
- Okay.

677
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:12,814
I, um -

678
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:20,220
I have to tell you a secret,
that I've never told anyone,

679
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:26,126
but it's really important
that you hear this.

680
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:33,166
When my sister was dying,
she was in so much pain

681
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:39,339
and she made a decision
to end her life,

682
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:45,546
but these were the days
that it was illegal,

683
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:49,216
there was no such thing as
assisted suicide anywhere.

684
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:50,150
- Yeah.

685
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:53,353
- She knew that mom
and all of her friends,

686
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:54,555
wouldn't be able to do it.

687
00:35:55,188 --> 00:36:00,427
So, she called me, talked
to her and told me that,

688
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:03,631
well because we
weren't very close,

689
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:07,568
that she thought that I
would be able to do it.

690
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:08,268
- That's terrible.

691
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:10,437
- Yeah it was.
- So sorry.

692
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,405
- I just left.

693
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,940
I, I-

694
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,342
I didn't even know how to react.

695
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,444
I went to my therapist,
talked to him he said,

696
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:19,212
you can't talk to me about this.

697
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:21,582
I would have to report it.

698
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,318
Especially if you did it,
it's a crime.

699
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:28,255
And then I realized I
wouldn't even be able

700
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,590
to talk to him about it.

701
00:36:29,624 --> 00:36:31,526
- Wow, that's awful.

702
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,662
- I thought, oh great,
she's asked me to,

703
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:35,863
to do the worst thing I
would ever do in my life,

704
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:39,332
and I wouldn't even be able
to talk to anybody about it.

705
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:49,276
But then, all my life I'd been
wanting to be close to Natalie.

706
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:51,946
And I had never been.

707
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:58,686
And I felt so terrible,
when I just abandoned her

708
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,558
and I left and she was
alone and she was in pain

709
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:07,427
and I felt so bad about that.

710
00:37:07,461 --> 00:37:11,666
And so I went to her and I said,

711
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:15,268
I can't help you do this,
I can't do that,

712
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:19,406
but I can be there for
you I can be with you.

713
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:25,813
When we sat for hours
and talked and talked,

714
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:29,349
it was very healing.

715
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:33,487
But one of the things that
we talked about was you.

716
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:36,591
- Why me?

717
00:37:36,624 --> 00:37:39,660
I wasn't even, wasn't
even born yet.

718
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:41,796
- You were on the way.

719
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:44,665
She wrote you this letter.

720
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:48,903
Now, I was gonna mail
it to you but,

721
00:37:49,971 --> 00:37:50,805
I'm,

722
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:54,909
I'm so glad that I can
give this to you now

723
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:57,845
because she wanted me to
wait until you turn 25.

724
00:37:57,879 --> 00:38:00,347
And so now I can,
and you're here and.

725
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:10,525
- Dear, oh so beautiful girl.

726
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,393
I know you'll be a girl

727
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:16,798
and I know you'll be
beautiful like your mother.

728
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:20,835
And sensitive, compassionate,
creative,

729
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,971
and that you'll feel things
deeply just like her,

730
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:26,507
and you'll also be
smart and ambitious

731
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:29,110
and headstrong like your father.

732
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:35,516
But sometimes those qualities
can be at war with each other.

733
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:39,486
And perhaps you might
think your strength lies

734
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,388
in all your father's qualities,

735
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:44,826
and you might not see who
your mother really is,

736
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:49,429
because your mother
doesn't, at least not yet.

737
00:38:50,264 --> 00:38:53,801
But I do and I wanted
to tell you a story.

738
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:57,505
<i>At camp, I was</i>
<i>Hannah's counselor.</i>

739
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:59,674
<i>I don't know if you</i>
<i>know what color war is,</i>

740
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:00,808
<i>or if it even still exists.</i>

741
00:39:00,842 --> 00:39:02,543
- Oh, it does.

742
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:05,780
<i>- The camp would be divided</i>
<i>into two sides, two colors,</i>

743
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:07,949
<i>and they would</i>
<i>compete at sports.</i>

744
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:11,152
<i>Hannah was a terrific</i>
<i> swimmer, the best in the camp.</i>

745
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:12,920
<i>She was a mermaid.</i>
- She's amazing.

746
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:15,957
<i>- There was a swim meet,</i>
<i>four girls on each side,</i>

747
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,626
<i>and they would swim out</i>
<i>to the dock and back.</i>

748
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,862
<i>The strongest swimmers go last.</i>

749
00:39:20,895 --> 00:39:22,864
<i>The girls were even</i>
<i>when your mother</i>

750
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:26,033
<i>and the girl from the other</i>
<i>team dove into the water.</i>

751
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:28,636
<i>They touched the dock</i>
<i>at the same time</i>

752
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:30,805
<i>and were neck and neck</i>
<i>swimming back.</i>

753
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:33,908
<i>It was close, but the</i>
<i>other girl won.</i>

754
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:36,744
<i>And the other girl was</i>
<i>hugged and praised,</i>

755
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:38,746
<i>and got to hold the trophy.</i>

756
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:40,882
<i>You see the other girl</i>
<i>wasn't liked.</i>

757
00:39:40,915 --> 00:39:42,950
<i>She wasn't pretty,</i>
<i>spoke too loud,</i>

758
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:45,586
<i>said the wrong thing at</i>
<i>the wrong time.</i>

759
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,921
<i>But Hannah being Hannah,</i>

760
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:48,923
<i>saw what the other girls didn't,</i>

761
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:51,692
<i>a girl wanted</i>
<i>desperately to fit in.</i>

762
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:55,830
<i>So your mother threw the</i>
<i>race. That took compassion,</i>

763
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:59,466
<i>that took selflessness</i>
<i>and that's your mother.</i>

764
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:00,635
<i>I hope she knows that.</i>

765
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:04,505
<i>I know I've gone on too</i>
<i>long, but I'm a writer.</i>

766
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:08,809
<i>Ask your mother, better</i>
<i>yet just hug her for me.</i>

767
00:40:08,843 --> 00:40:12,847
<i>I send you my love</i>
<i>beautiful girl, Natalie.</i>

768
00:40:23,691 --> 00:40:24,926
- Thank you.

769
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:31,065
- <i>My mother used</i>
<i>to get a script</i>

770
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:32,266
<i>and immediately turn to</i>

771
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,003
<i>the last page to see what</i>
<i>happened to her character.</i>

772
00:40:36,037 --> 00:40:38,039
<i>She said, if she didn't</i>
<i>know the end,</i>

773
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:39,974
<i>she wouldn't know how</i>
<i>to play all the scenes</i>

774
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:41,474
<i>that came before.</i>

775
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:45,780
<i>So I wonder if I could</i>
<i>tell one of my friends,</i>

776
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:49,016
<i>what's gonna happen to her,</i>
<i>should I?</i>

777
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:53,087
<i>And would that make living</i>
<i>it easier or harder?</i>

778
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,956
<i>And which one would I tell?</i>

779
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:01,929
- Oh my, you are attached
that balloon, aren't you,

780
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:04,131
can you put the balloon
down for a minute?

781
00:41:06,634 --> 00:41:08,235
- What time is she coming?

782
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:09,637
- Three O'clock.

783
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:12,273
- What time is it now?

784
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:13,641
- 2:45.

785
00:41:14,275 --> 00:41:15,176
- Excited.

786
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:22,216
- Hey Kenai.

787
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:25,686
Hey Kasha.

788
00:41:38,265 --> 00:41:40,568
I gotta tell you something,
okay?

789
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,541
I have to go.

790
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:49,977
I don't wanna go, I don't
wanna leave you.

791
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:57,151
I remember when you were born,

792
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:02,023
Kenai look at me.

793
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,660
Thank you.

794
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:34,088
I'm not gonna forget you.

795
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:07,955
- You know, I sing this song
with my guys in the bar.

796
00:43:07,988 --> 00:43:08,856
- You do?

797
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:09,824
- My band yeah.

798
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:13,694
- You are the sexiest
woman on the planet.

799
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:15,963
- Tell that to my fireman.

800
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:17,364
- How's that going?

801
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:21,635
- Oh he's so, he's just
given up on me.

802
00:43:21,669 --> 00:43:22,603
- Oh, no, you broke up?

803
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:24,738
- Well I thought he was
gonna leave his wife

804
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:26,373
which was a little weird.

805
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:27,509
- I'm sorry.

806
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,644
- But I kind of got my eye
on my lead guitar player,

807
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:32,012
Barry, he's very hot.

808
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:34,281
- I love that face.

809
00:43:34,315 --> 00:43:38,352
- I'm gonna, could you
just get that?

810
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:41,355
- Oh, your hair, your wonderful
hair wait, let me go closer.

811
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:42,723
- Got it?

812
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:43,525
- Got it.

813
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:46,327
- Cause this is my
last donation,

814
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,363
I'm gonna, you know,
locks for love.

815
00:43:57,972 --> 00:43:59,673
- I applied to grad school.

816
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:03,944
- Oh my God you've been
wanting to do that forever.

817
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:06,313
- Classical studies I'm
super excited.

818
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:08,415
Thank you Val.

819
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:12,753
Thank you I'm waiting to hear,
I can't wait, I hope, I hope.

820
00:44:12,786 --> 00:44:14,121
- What time's she coming?

821
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:17,791
- She's coming
sometime after three.

822
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:21,929
- Okay good, we have
a little time.

823
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:23,197
- Yeah.

824
00:44:55,863 --> 00:44:56,797
- Can you take your glasses off?

825
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:57,798
- Okay.

826
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:58,165
- Only for a second.
- Right.

827
00:44:58,199 --> 00:44:59,266
- Got it.

828
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,169
- Okay that was right, that
was a second all right.

829
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:05,072
- What's going on?

830
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,474
- She's early!

831
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:11,345
- You fearless goddess person,

832
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:14,815
who's gonna kick the four
corners of the universe.

833
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:19,086
- Good bye tension
happy pension.

834
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,387
- Yeah!

835
00:45:20,421 --> 00:45:22,323
- Picture!

836
00:45:22,356 --> 00:45:24,124
Everybody face forward.

837
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:25,359
All right, ready?

838
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:27,361
Say uterus!

839
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:28,829
- Uterus!

840
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:34,034
- Look at this beauty, who's
gonna go out into the world

841
00:45:34,068 --> 00:45:36,036
and teach us how-

842
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,004
- Wait, what?

843
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:41,442
- I'm not, I'm not retiring.

844
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,045
I got fired this morning.

845
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:46,747
- Oh, what?

846
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:52,486
- Wait, wait, wait, Val I
thought you said that

847
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,488
I thought you said
that this was -

848
00:45:54,522 --> 00:45:56,890
- Well, Sally on the
board she told me

849
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:59,126
that they were retiring her.

850
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:00,828
- No, no, no, no.

851
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:04,865
"Retiring her", that's code
for that you're getting fired.

852
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,067
- Oh God I feel terrible.

853
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:07,968
- Rheza!

854
00:46:08,002 --> 00:46:09,870
- It's okay, it's okay.

855
00:46:11,606 --> 00:46:14,208
- Now I've wrecked all
this and everything.

856
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,010
- It's all right, it's okay.

857
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:45,906
- This is not just about me.

858
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:50,911
Patrick has been so depressed.

859
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:55,215
It's so much harder to run
a small farm. It gets harder

860
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:57,951
and harder, you can't get
help you can't keep help.

861
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:00,254
He's older.

862
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:07,294
He's in despair about
the environment.

863
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:10,230
He made us write letters
to our children

864
00:47:10,264 --> 00:47:12,333
and our grandchild apologizing.

865
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:17,938
I'm scared Maggie,
I, we could fall apart.

866
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:23,210
Oh God and then
there's the animals.

867
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,413
- Oh.

868
00:47:26,447 --> 00:47:31,619
- You know, we caged them

869
00:47:31,952 --> 00:47:34,288
and we try to give
them happy lives.

870
00:47:34,321 --> 00:47:37,525
I'm not under any
illusion that we do.

871
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:38,459
Oh Maggie

872
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:46,634
- I believe, God has big
plans for you.

873
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:48,235
Well, I do.

874
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,270
- He's gonna be up all night.

875
00:47:50,304 --> 00:47:51,338
- Big plans!

876
00:47:55,543 --> 00:48:00,347
- You gave me a quote years
ago about the animals,

877
00:48:01,281 --> 00:48:02,950
they're not underlings.

878
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:08,088
- They're other nations.

879
00:48:08,122 --> 00:48:12,359
- Like ourselves captured
in the web of time and life.

880
00:48:13,193 --> 00:48:14,562
Fellow prisoners.

881
00:48:15,963 --> 00:48:17,331
- Your work's not done.

882
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:23,170
Oh my dear friend.

883
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:25,005
- You went through this.

884
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:26,340
- I did.

885
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:29,443
I left the convent, I
went to a new convent

886
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:33,380
and I found my life's
work, I found it there.

887
00:48:36,651 --> 00:48:40,053
And my work's just
beginning and so is yours.

888
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:45,292
Big plans.

889
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:51,098
Our fellow prisoners need you.

890
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:58,740
- I would like to say
how beautiful you look,

891
00:48:58,773 --> 00:48:59,707
you changed into the-

892
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:01,041
- With the overalls?

893
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:02,476
- Shell blue, would we say?

894
00:49:03,177 --> 00:49:08,015
- So I wanna make a
toast to second chances.

895
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:10,417
In this country today, given
how long everybody lives,

896
00:49:10,451 --> 00:49:12,186
people change their jobs
a million times,

897
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,521
they may have three or
four careers.

898
00:49:13,555 --> 00:49:17,692
This is my second and so
we'll say to second chances.

899
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:19,727
- What did we say?
"We will get there!"

900
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:20,994
- We will get there!

901
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:24,331
- To where we're gonna get.

902
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:26,233
- But just one more toast ready?

903
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:27,234
- Okay.

904
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:31,438
- The good Lord said come forth,

905
00:49:31,472 --> 00:49:34,007
but he came fifth and
lost the race.

906
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:36,043
- Is that inspiring?

907
00:49:36,076 --> 00:49:39,079
- He came in fifth and
lost race, okay.

908
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:40,280
- Okay anyway, we're drinking.

909
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:41,148
- We're drinking.

910
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:42,416
- We're drinking, yes.

911
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,618
- That's beautiful.

912
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:44,619
- Drinking.

913
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,155
- I have a firing story.

914
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:49,256
- Oh great.

915
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:52,159
- I was in a department
store for the makeup counter

916
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:55,763
and I never wore any makeup
and I wasn't very good at it.

917
00:49:55,797 --> 00:49:58,365
And when these women would
have their makeup put on,

918
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:01,468
they would say, I would do
was just a terrible job.

919
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:04,806
I thought, after I got the
makeup on and the women,

920
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:07,341
they would say, how do
you think I look?

921
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:10,077
What do you think, and I would
have to tell them the truth

922
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,680
which is I thought they
looked better before.

923
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:14,348
Anyway.

924
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:19,186
- I wasn't fired, but all the
good stuff that's interesting,

925
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:22,389
at least at school was
going to the younger people.

926
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:24,224
You know the new projects,
if I had a project

927
00:50:24,258 --> 00:50:28,128
that I was excited about, I
used to get a lot of attention

928
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:30,798
on those projects and
then it was suddenly,

929
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:33,668
I don't think that's such
a good idea and,

930
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:37,237
just gradually just feel
the focus is off you.

931
00:50:37,271 --> 00:50:39,774
But anyway, I've got my band
and I wouldn't have started

932
00:50:39,807 --> 00:50:41,843
singing with the band
if they done that so.

933
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:43,511
- And I wouldn't be
taking pictures.

934
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,379
- And I wouldn't be
applying to grad school,

935
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:47,180
if I hadn't felt like get
off the couch.

936
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:52,185
- We have transformations,
cause that's what we're really

937
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:52,987
talking about right.

938
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:54,856
All of us going to
the next place,

939
00:50:54,889 --> 00:50:57,659
the next stage into new
skin, into new thoughts.

940
00:50:57,692 --> 00:50:59,694
- Doesn't it make you think
back when you were younger

941
00:50:59,727 --> 00:51:02,429
and you had a grandparent
or somebody who was older

942
00:51:02,462 --> 00:51:05,700
or someone that you might have
just a little bit dismissed.

943
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:08,636
I would've loved to have asked
my grandmother about what

944
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:11,238
that felt like after the
kids were gone,

945
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:14,341
and after I would just love
to have had that one on one,

946
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:15,409
like how was that for you?

947
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:18,145
- You know I wonder if
our generation has escaped

948
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:20,548
a little bit of that because
the baby boomer generation

949
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:23,651
was so huge, and then they
started saying things like

950
00:51:23,685 --> 00:51:26,453
50 is the new 40 and 60
is the new 50.

951
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:29,591
- And it's so awful, the
premium on youth.

952
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:30,525
- And everybody in
our generation

953
00:51:30,558 --> 00:51:31,626
started having surgery

954
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:32,860
and everybody's working
out like crazy.

955
00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:37,565
And so I think our generation
kind of stretched our youth

956
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,734
longer than the
generations before us.

957
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,703
- On the one hand,
I feel like everyone

958
00:51:41,736 --> 00:51:44,672
should fly their flag like
if you wanna be dressing

959
00:51:44,706 --> 00:51:48,175
in high heeled shoes in
your 60s and you know,

960
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:49,142
glam in your face,

961
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:50,812
then we should just
celebrate each other.

962
00:51:50,845 --> 00:51:53,648
But on the other hand for
myself, if I'm being honest,

963
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:55,516
there's always a
little bit like,

964
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,518
what mold are you
putting yourself in,

965
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:58,720
and who is that for really.

966
00:51:58,753 --> 00:52:02,489
- Now my job doesn't depend
on how I sound or how I look

967
00:52:02,523 --> 00:52:03,658
or you're not pretty enough.

968
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:06,360
- That was a great thing
about working with animals.

969
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:10,598
- Maggie have ever been
fired Maggie?

970
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:16,203
- Yes, remember a bunch
of us protested.

971
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:17,538
- Oh boy.

972
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:19,473
- And that's a wild thing
if you wanna see

973
00:52:19,507 --> 00:52:20,808
a bunch of protesting nuns.

974
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:23,745
But I was put on
probation so you can,

975
00:52:23,778 --> 00:52:27,447
I think we can all feel
we can lose our jobs.

976
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:29,717
Sometimes for good reasons.

977
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:30,551
- What do you think Natalie

978
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:32,854
would've been doing now,
if she's...

979
00:52:32,887 --> 00:52:35,590
Because I remember when she
was fired after her 40th

980
00:52:35,623 --> 00:52:36,658
birthday and we were-

981
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:39,661
- She was fired because
of growing a little older,

982
00:52:39,694 --> 00:52:40,561
right was it?

983
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:41,529
- Ageism.

984
00:52:42,764 --> 00:52:45,232
- Lizzie I told you that in
secrecy, how does she know?

985
00:52:45,265 --> 00:52:47,300
- I didn't tell her.
-Well then how does she know?

986
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:53,574
- Because I told my wonderful,
trustworthy older sister, Val.

987
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:56,243
- Oh great so everybody here
knows? Great.

988
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,879
I lost my job okay?

989
00:52:57,912 --> 00:53:00,615
- She was really
pushing the envelope.

990
00:53:00,648 --> 00:53:02,583
If she lived, do you
think she would've been

991
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:04,351
like the head of some network?

992
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:06,654
- Maybe she would've
had her own show on CNN

993
00:53:06,688 --> 00:53:09,590
or some, or the PBS news hour.

994
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:12,292
- The person you tuned
into to hear about women,

995
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:15,797
- Glass ceiling would've been
just shattering all over.

996
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,465
- I call this guy in Chicago
that I knew, a businessman

997
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:19,867
and I've known him
over the years.

998
00:53:19,901 --> 00:53:23,638
And I said, I've just
turned 40, I've been fired

999
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:25,907
and I'm ready to
change careers.

1000
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,474
And he said, I'll
take a chance.

1001
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:28,609
- Unbelievable.

1002
00:53:28,643 --> 00:53:30,645
Just outta the blue,
I'll take a chance.

1003
00:53:30,678 --> 00:53:32,580
So maybe losing my job
was the best thing

1004
00:53:32,613 --> 00:53:34,749
that ever happened to me.

1005
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:36,551
- Should we toast to Natalie?

1006
00:53:36,584 --> 00:53:40,555
To Natalie, wherever you are.
Forever.

1007
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:41,455
- To Natalie.

1008
00:53:41,488 --> 00:53:42,355
- To Natalie.

1009
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:42,924
- Yes to Natalie.

1010
00:53:42,957 --> 00:53:43,758
- To Natalie.

1011
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:45,827
- Keep inspiring us
to go forward.

1012
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:50,263
- You know, when I was here
before I was talking to Val

1013
00:53:50,297 --> 00:53:54,334
about spreading my mother's
ashes at Christmas,

1014
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:58,506
she volunteered, she kind
of volunteered you guys too.

1015
00:53:58,539 --> 00:53:59,841
How would you feel about that?

1016
00:53:59,874 --> 00:54:01,042
- Yes, I would love that.

1017
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:02,577
- I would be honored.

1018
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,945
- And I would love to host,

1019
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:06,446
just to have
everybody at my house.

1020
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,015
- My mother would've loved that.

1021
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:08,850
- Yes.

1022
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:10,417
- A nice gathering.

1023
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,318
- Beautiful idea.

1024
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:11,819
- Wonderful.

1025
00:54:11,853 --> 00:54:12,620
- It's beautiful.

1026
00:54:12,653 --> 00:54:14,522
- I would love for
you to be there.

1027
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:15,723
- Yes, definitely.

1028
00:54:15,757 --> 00:54:18,291
- Rheza would you give me a
minute, could I talk to you?

1029
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:18,993
- It would be an honor.

1030
00:54:19,026 --> 00:54:19,927
- I love Christmas time too.

1031
00:54:19,961 --> 00:54:22,462
- Just need to talk to
you for a second.

1032
00:54:22,496 --> 00:54:24,799
- We're just gonna, I just
have to tell her something.

1033
00:54:24,832 --> 00:54:28,301
Or show her something,
just show her something.

1034
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:29,036
- Okay.

1035
00:54:30,605 --> 00:54:31,471
- Be right back.

1036
00:54:31,506 --> 00:54:32,372
- Okay.
- Okay.

1037
00:54:32,405 --> 00:54:33,674
- All right.

1038
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,777
- Well we'll just drink
while you're gone.

1039
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,311
- Rheza, Rheza, sit down.

1040
00:54:38,345 --> 00:54:39,446
- What?
- Sit down

1041
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:42,784
I lost the ashes.

1042
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:45,119
- What?

1043
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:48,321
- So we were packing
everything up, in Ruth's house,

1044
00:54:48,355 --> 00:54:50,490
and I was with Shelley
and we found the ashes.

1045
00:54:50,525 --> 00:54:51,592
- Right.

1046
00:54:51,626 --> 00:54:52,827
- And she asked me if I
would take them

1047
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,830
because she was going to Africa
and she couldn't, take them.

1048
00:54:55,863 --> 00:54:56,731
So what could I say?

1049
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:59,000
So I took them and I
put them in a box

1050
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:01,102
and then I put them with
the other boxes

1051
00:55:01,135 --> 00:55:03,704
and I put them in my car
and I brought them home.

1052
00:55:03,738 --> 00:55:06,073
But then I didn't open
up for a couple of weeks,

1053
00:55:06,107 --> 00:55:09,043
but when I did, the
ashes were gone.

1054
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:12,880
- When you were packing
the car, you gave me a box

1055
00:55:12,914 --> 00:55:15,950
but that was just, that
was stuff for the kitchen.

1056
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:21,088
- Oh that's it, I put
them in the kitchen box.

1057
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:32,834
Oh my God, you use this
honey cornbread.

1058
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:35,502
- What are you talking about?

1059
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:38,506
Oh my God.

1060
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:45,713
We have to open.

1061
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,851
- Okay, I'm gonna...

1062
00:55:50,718 --> 00:55:51,552
No, no you can't

1063
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:55,488
- There are never any arguments,
very happily together.

1064
00:55:55,523 --> 00:55:56,958
And the men said it was because

1065
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:59,126
they never see each other
during the day.

1066
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:05,032
- I was just talking about
these women in Burma.

1067
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:09,136
So wait, what did...
- Is everything okay?

1068
00:56:09,871 --> 00:56:11,939
- Yes, perfect.

1069
00:56:11,973 --> 00:56:15,576
Everything is very much okay.

1070
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,444
- Oh, wait a minute, present.

1071
00:56:17,477 --> 00:56:18,779
- What about the presents?

1072
00:56:18,813 --> 00:56:19,680
- I can't believe this.

1073
00:56:19,714 --> 00:56:21,182
- They're supposed to
be joke presents

1074
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,184
- You get fired and
people give you presents.

1075
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,719
- Oh, that's when you
should have presents.

1076
00:56:24,752 --> 00:56:25,786
- I'm embarrassed, so excited.

1077
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:29,991
- And this is about what
you can do in your future,

1078
00:56:30,024 --> 00:56:32,492
with the new time that you have.

1079
00:56:32,526 --> 00:56:35,428
- Wait minute, this looks
like a, it's a pancake maker.

1080
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:39,967
- It's not a dream griddle
that's just the box.

1081
00:56:41,736 --> 00:56:42,803
- It's a little alarm clock.

1082
00:56:42,837 --> 00:56:43,604
- I wanted a dream-

1083
00:56:43,638 --> 00:56:45,106
- Dream griddle
that's hilarious-

1084
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:47,575
- Dream griddle alarm
box but that's not it.

1085
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:49,476
- This feels, um...

1086
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,711
- No.
- What?

1087
00:56:50,745 --> 00:56:51,879
- Oh my God.

1088
00:56:51,913 --> 00:56:53,714
- Oh my God.

1089
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:56,083
- What on earth are
you thinking?

1090
00:56:56,117 --> 00:56:58,519
- And the funny thing
is it didn't have ears

1091
00:56:58,552 --> 00:56:59,486
when I put it in.

1092
00:57:03,624 --> 00:57:04,792
- Can you not point that at me?

1093
00:57:04,825 --> 00:57:06,627
- What are talking about?

1094
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:10,665
- And it doubles as a
dream griddle.

1095
00:57:11,766 --> 00:57:12,833
- Is it an alarm clock?

1096
00:57:12,867 --> 00:57:13,901
- Its an alarm clock.

1097
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:15,202
- It will make great alarm
clock, wake up girls.

1098
00:57:15,236 --> 00:57:16,938
- It doubles as an alarm clock!

1099
00:57:16,971 --> 00:57:17,872
- Bless your heart

1100
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:20,641
- Can you just put this up
more over here?

1101
00:57:23,978 --> 00:57:27,782
- Val, I think you're the
only older woman I know,

1102
00:57:27,815 --> 00:57:29,216
that still wants to have sex.

1103
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:29,850
- You're the best.

1104
00:57:29,884 --> 00:57:30,851
- I know.

1105
00:57:30,885 --> 00:57:33,220
- Oh come on.
- I'm just looking out for you.

1106
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:35,890
- I'm in a book club, there's
some of the women are married,

1107
00:57:35,923 --> 00:57:37,758
some are not, but everybody,

1108
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:38,793
they were all saying
they didn't care

1109
00:57:38,826 --> 00:57:40,061
if they ever had sex again.

1110
00:57:40,094 --> 00:57:42,763
And that the only reason they
were still having sex is cause

1111
00:57:42,797 --> 00:57:45,199
their husbands wanted it and
so they were like, okay well.

1112
00:57:45,232 --> 00:57:47,101
- It's so sad.
- But they really didn't care.

1113
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:48,636
- If you don't wanna
do it, you don't do it

1114
00:57:48,669 --> 00:57:52,139
but I just think, wow,
this is like so much fun,

1115
00:57:52,173 --> 00:57:54,141
and it makes me feel so great,

1116
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:57,178
and why wouldn't
everybody wanna do it?

1117
00:57:57,211 --> 00:57:58,079
It's just me.

1118
00:57:58,946 --> 00:57:59,847
- This is from you.

1119
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,549
- Yeah.
- Oh my gosh.

1120
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:05,820
Oh, this is so beautiful.

1121
00:58:05,853 --> 00:58:09,790
- This is called a
Toka from Tibet.

1122
00:58:09,824 --> 00:58:10,725
- Oh.

1123
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:16,263
- And it's Tara and she's
the goddess of protection

1124
00:58:16,297 --> 00:58:21,602
and animals and compassion
and she's fearless,

1125
00:58:21,936 --> 00:58:23,537
like our Rheza, beautiful.

1126
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:24,638
- Oh, thank you so much.

1127
00:58:24,672 --> 00:58:25,873
- You're so welcome.

1128
00:58:25,906 --> 00:58:26,941
- From my heart.

1129
00:58:29,944 --> 00:58:31,112
- Oh my God.

1130
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,547
- You did that?

1131
00:58:33,581 --> 00:58:35,082
- Oh my God.

1132
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,084
- Wow.

1133
00:58:37,118 --> 00:58:39,787
- Oh this is, oh thank you.

1134
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,589
- Is that from that place
with the women?

1135
00:58:41,622 --> 00:58:43,190
- Oh, this is beautiful.

1136
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:46,327
- Oh these were still in
Africa when I went through-

1137
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:46,994
- That's so beautiful.

1138
00:58:47,028 --> 00:58:49,196
- Boy, I'm glad I was fired.

1139
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:53,300
- Goodbye tension,
happy pension.

1140
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:54,235
- Yay!

1141
00:58:55,102 --> 00:58:56,971
- Make a wish Rheza!

1142
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:02,710
- I want us all to make a
wish together.

1143
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:05,546
Ready?
- Uh-huh.

1144
00:59:20,828 --> 00:59:25,232
- <i>As we get older,</i>
<i>our perspective on age changes.</i>

1145
00:59:25,266 --> 00:59:28,836
<i>When we were younger,</i>
<i>we thought 40 was old.</i>

1146
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:33,174
<i>When I died at 40, my friends</i>
<i>said she died too young.</i>

1147
00:59:34,141 --> 00:59:36,877
<i>You have a conviction</i>
<i>that at a certain age,</i>

1148
00:59:36,911 --> 00:59:38,646
<i>you should have it all together,</i>

1149
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:42,216
<i>but then you get older and</i>
<i>you keep moving the goal post.</i>

1150
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,953
<i>How will my friends</i>
<i>remember this year?</i>

1151
00:59:45,986 --> 00:59:47,988
<i>The year that Ruth died,</i>

1152
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:50,257
<i>the year they were all</i>
<i>together again.</i>

1153
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:53,127
<i>What change that is coming</i>
<i>will take center stage</i>

1154
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,228
<i>in their lives?</i>

1155
00:59:54,762 --> 00:59:58,199
<i> Oh and if you're wondering if</i>
<i>everything is predetermined</i>

1156
00:59:58,232 --> 01:00:01,168
<i>or if you are in control</i>
<i>of your own destiny,</i>

1157
01:00:01,202 --> 01:00:03,104
<i>the answer is yes.</i>

1158
01:00:16,217 --> 01:00:18,686
- ♪ Glory to the newborn king ♪

1159
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:22,156
- Merry Christmas.

1160
01:00:22,189 --> 01:00:24,358
- Merry Christmas.

1161
01:00:27,061 --> 01:00:29,296
- So what is the plan
when you get home?

1162
01:00:31,298 --> 01:00:35,336
- Actually, Lucas and I
are gonna go on a trip.

1163
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:38,172
I know.

1164
01:00:38,205 --> 01:00:39,907
- You're back together?

1165
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:43,177
- Yeah we've been dating and
spending a lot of time together

1166
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:45,679
and it's been really,
really good.

1167
01:00:46,247 --> 01:00:47,982
- What changed do you think?

1168
01:00:48,682 --> 01:00:55,122
- Well, on the kids'
situation, we kind of decided

1169
01:00:55,156 --> 01:00:57,892
that we would just take
it as it comes.

1170
01:00:57,925 --> 01:00:58,826
- Uh-huh.

1171
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:00,194
- And really,

1172
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:07,401
my example of a mom was
a very devoted mother

1173
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:12,106
and I don't know, I feel
like where I am now

1174
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:14,375
I couldn't be that
kind of focused

1175
01:01:14,408 --> 01:01:17,044
and involved and great mom.

1176
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:21,982
So, but I'm learning that
maybe it doesn't have

1177
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:24,318
to be one extreme
or the other, but.

1178
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:35,362
- There she is.

1179
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:36,297
- Mm.

1180
01:01:54,114 --> 01:01:57,351
- It's an adjustment cause I
was so used to having the house

1181
01:01:57,384 --> 01:02:00,187
to myself and now
he's there but,

1182
01:02:00,221 --> 01:02:01,388
- All the time.

1183
01:02:01,422 --> 01:02:04,792
- We're navigating, I've gotten
him to go to a yoga class.

1184
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:06,026
- Dad's doing yoga?

1185
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:09,230
- He is, and the downward facing
dog is a whole other thing.

1186
01:02:09,263 --> 01:02:11,865
- Wow, sign me up.

1187
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:12,701
- He's doing well though.

1188
01:02:12,733 --> 01:02:15,069
- That's great, good
for you guys.

1189
01:02:15,102 --> 01:02:17,972
- Yeah, it's very sweet, he's
got the best sense of humor

1190
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:22,510
and it's- that goes a
long way I have to say.

1191
01:02:30,317 --> 01:02:31,885
- I actually decided
this morning

1192
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:33,787
that you should move back.

1193
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:34,088
- Oh yeah?

1194
01:02:34,121 --> 01:02:35,089
- Yeah.

1195
01:02:35,122 --> 01:02:37,224
We could spend weekends
up here I'm thinking,

1196
01:02:37,258 --> 01:02:39,326
this would be a
really nice thing.

1197
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,261
- Yeah but if I move back,

1198
01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:42,363
I'll have to see my
mother all the time.

1199
01:02:42,396 --> 01:02:43,531
- We won't tell her.

1200
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:49,571
- I dunno where she went, she
left Chicago, I don't know.

1201
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:51,071
- You need a sandwich
or something?

1202
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:52,574
I can make you a little
shrimp salad.

1203
01:02:52,607 --> 01:02:55,175
- No serve food on the plane
these days, it's a new thing.

1204
01:02:55,209 --> 01:02:56,243
- Ah, really?

1205
01:02:57,845 --> 01:02:58,946
- I miss you.

1206
01:02:58,979 --> 01:02:59,980
- Me too, sweetie.

1207
01:03:02,016 --> 01:03:03,317
Take care of yourself.

1208
01:03:08,255 --> 01:03:09,290
Bye, bye.

1209
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:11,593
Love you.

1210
01:03:11,626 --> 01:03:12,527
- I love you.

1211
01:03:17,632 --> 01:03:18,465
- Val.

1212
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:20,434
Val?

1213
01:03:21,902 --> 01:03:22,803
Val.

1214
01:03:24,438 --> 01:03:27,007
Sweetie, take a
deep breath okay.

1215
01:03:28,242 --> 01:03:29,476
It's hard to be here.

1216
01:03:33,414 --> 01:03:39,019
I am grateful for you and
you, grateful for life.

1217
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:46,860
- No one like you. Okay.

1218
01:03:49,396 --> 01:03:50,431
- Love you Nat.

1219
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:00,474
- I got back from China,

1220
01:04:00,508 --> 01:04:04,278
I talked to the guy from the
gallery, he wants to do a show.

1221
01:04:04,311 --> 01:04:05,647
- That's amazing.

1222
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,617
- I'm calling it The
Kingdom of Daughters.

1223
01:04:10,384 --> 01:04:11,352
- Wonderful.

1224
01:04:11,385 --> 01:04:12,386
- Thank you.

1225
01:04:12,754 --> 01:04:16,190
- So I am very happy in
my new order,

1226
01:04:16,223 --> 01:04:20,494
Sisters of the Sacred Mount,
we do wonderful hospice work

1227
01:04:20,528 --> 01:04:23,030
and I am moving
forward with that.

1228
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:26,233
But I'm not cutting my hair yet,
not yet.

1229
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:27,368
- I noticed that.

1230
01:04:27,401 --> 01:04:30,572
- I started Rheza's Rescues.

1231
01:04:30,605 --> 01:04:34,241
I'm taking in stray dogs,
some wounded animals,

1232
01:04:34,274 --> 01:04:36,377
and making a lot of
new friends.

1233
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:38,613
- Wow, oh gosh.

1234
01:04:38,646 --> 01:04:41,081
- We have a litter of
puppies do you want any?

1235
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:43,651
- And I am at the end of
my first semester

1236
01:04:43,685 --> 01:04:47,589
in classical studies and
I love, love my cohort.

1237
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:50,290
It's been incredible.
- She's learning.

1238
01:04:50,324 --> 01:04:52,493
- Every night I'm like
"Let me tell you about

1239
01:04:52,527 --> 01:04:55,129
the Trojan Women and Hecuba!-

1240
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,030
And Demeter, and Persephone"

1241
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:58,399
- And I'm like, oh, I
have to go to sleep now.

1242
01:04:58,432 --> 01:05:00,167
And she's like, "But one more!"

1243
01:05:00,702 --> 01:05:04,471
But no, it's exciting, it's
nice to see you so passionate

1244
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:05,439
and lit up about something.

1245
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:08,442
- Yes, and can I tell
your aunties about,

1246
01:05:08,475 --> 01:05:12,112
she's- Nat's been offered
this incredible promotion

1247
01:05:12,146 --> 01:05:14,649
that was just, almost like-

1248
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:19,253
- It's avatars, yes, computers.

1249
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:21,088
- Tell us about it I don't know.

1250
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:22,289
- So I was offered a promotion

1251
01:05:22,322 --> 01:05:24,458
as a senior software engineer,

1252
01:05:25,627 --> 01:05:31,533
but I would just have to work
closely with another engineer

1253
01:05:31,566 --> 01:05:33,635
and I don't know if
it's really a good fit.

1254
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:35,670
So I'm just kind of
weighing my options

1255
01:05:35,703 --> 01:05:39,273
and seeing maybe I wanna switch
companies, I'm not sure yet.

1256
01:05:39,306 --> 01:05:42,976
- What's the dynamic like that
it's not comfortable or what?

1257
01:05:44,211 --> 01:05:45,179
- Um,

1258
01:05:47,147 --> 01:05:48,982
yeah, it's that.

1259
01:05:49,016 --> 01:05:50,350
I don't think I'd be,

1260
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:53,020
I just don't think we
would work well together.

1261
01:05:53,053 --> 01:05:55,255
It's not the most
comfortable situation

1262
01:05:55,289 --> 01:06:00,327
and working even more closely
with him, would just not be.

1263
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,596
- What did he do?

1264
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:06,233
- Oh.

1265
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:07,167
- Oh God.

1266
01:06:09,436 --> 01:06:13,541
- So a month ago I was at
the office late,

1267
01:06:14,107 --> 01:06:17,110
I go into his office, he tells
me to come around the desk

1268
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:20,515
so I can take a look at what
he's working on, so I do,

1269
01:06:20,548 --> 01:06:23,484
and he goes to hand me
a folder and it drops,

1270
01:06:23,518 --> 01:06:28,690
and so, I go to pick it up,

1271
01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:33,628
and that's when I see
that he is um,

1272
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:37,030
playing with himself.

1273
01:06:37,064 --> 01:06:40,467
I tried to get up, but he pushed
my head down into his lap.

1274
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:41,669
- Oh no, no.

1275
01:06:42,871 --> 01:06:48,141
- And he wouldn't let me go,
like I physically couldn't move

1276
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:51,078
and I've never felt that before.

1277
01:06:51,111 --> 01:06:55,783
And I bit him, I bit it.

1278
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:56,751
- Good.

1279
01:06:56,784 --> 01:07:00,120
- He pushed me away
and he called me a cunt

1280
01:07:00,153 --> 01:07:05,325
and he told me that I'd be
fired if I ever told anyone.

1281
01:07:05,994 --> 01:07:10,364
So I didn't, I actually
haven't told anyone until now.

1282
01:07:10,397 --> 01:07:11,365
- I'm so sorry.

1283
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:14,602
- So I'm just figuring
out what I'm gonna do.

1284
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:20,675
- I'm so sorry this
happened to you.

1285
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:22,777
- All I wanna do was my job.

1286
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:24,679
That night when I went
into his office,

1287
01:07:24,712 --> 01:07:26,514
all I wanted to do was my job.

1288
01:07:26,548 --> 01:07:28,616
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
talk about this,

1289
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:31,118
I don't wanna have to
deal with it.

1290
01:07:31,151 --> 01:07:35,723
I'm just not, I don't want it.

1291
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:38,726
I don't want any of this so.

1292
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,563
- I think there is a choice.

1293
01:07:41,596 --> 01:07:44,699
There's so much support now.

1294
01:07:44,732 --> 01:07:50,470
I think for his own sake,
you need to report him.

1295
01:07:51,005 --> 01:07:54,776
- Don't report him, it will
ruin your whole career.

1296
01:07:55,843 --> 01:07:59,446
- What you both just said,
I've been battling in my mind,

1297
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:00,447
- Right.

1298
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:05,152
- A lot over the last
month and, the thing is,

1299
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:09,724
Im, I'm a terrible person if I
don't report it and stop him

1300
01:08:09,757 --> 01:08:11,793
from potentially doing
this other women,

1301
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:17,230
but I could also completely
ruin my career if I do

1302
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:21,736
and it's such an unfair
position to be put in.

1303
01:08:21,769 --> 01:08:25,840
- This happened to Natalie
and she didn't report it, and

1304
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:29,544
she always felt terrible about
it, she always regretted it.

1305
01:08:29,577 --> 01:08:32,145
But in our day there
wasn't a group of people

1306
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:35,482
that she could go to talk to
who experienced the same thing.

1307
01:08:35,516 --> 01:08:36,851
And you can.

1308
01:08:38,218 --> 01:08:39,854
The only way for you to heal,

1309
01:08:39,887 --> 01:08:42,590
I think, is for you
to fight back.

1310
01:08:42,624 --> 01:08:45,192
- Change is always
extraordinary,

1311
01:08:45,693 --> 01:08:47,595
you're going to be fine.

1312
01:08:48,963 --> 01:08:50,364
- We've all been there.

1313
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:54,702
- You're not alone.

1314
01:08:55,202 --> 01:08:57,371
- You are
so not alone.

1315
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:10,618
♪ Silent night, holy night ♪

1316
01:09:11,284 --> 01:09:18,258

♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪

1321
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:45,285
- What are you doing,
we're enjoying the company.

1322
01:09:48,422 --> 01:09:49,090
- No

1323
01:09:49,123 --> 01:09:50,257
- What are we talking about now?

1324
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:51,926
- Memories, memories oh my God.

1325
01:09:51,959 --> 01:09:54,662
- We're talking about your
mother and her fabulousness

1326
01:09:54,696 --> 01:09:58,599
and her dread orange lipstick
and her leopard coats.

1327
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:00,300
- All right, all right.

1328
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:04,972
Do you know the story of Ruth
and Shelley and the movie?

1329
01:10:05,006 --> 01:10:05,973
All right.

1330
01:10:06,007 --> 01:10:10,011
Ruth's latest movie was
in town and she decided

1331
01:10:10,044 --> 01:10:11,378
to take the girls.

1332
01:10:11,946 --> 01:10:14,782
She didn't wanna draw a lot
of attention to herself,

1333
01:10:14,816 --> 01:10:18,586
she said, when she prepared
to go to the movie,

1334
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:19,887
she was in disguise,
- Incognito.

1335
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:23,323
incognito, in a huge fur hat,

1336
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:24,726
a lot of fur and a scarf.

1337
01:10:24,759 --> 01:10:25,660
- A Persian fur!

1338
01:10:25,693 --> 01:10:26,661
- And dark glasses.

1339
01:10:26,694 --> 01:10:28,863
- Right, dark glasses
in the movie theater.

1340
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:30,598
- And then they see the
lights go down

1341
01:10:30,631 --> 01:10:33,266
and they sneak in the
back and sit down.

1342
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:37,337
So in this movie, Ruth
was playing a mother,

1343
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,541
with a little girl, exactly
the same age as Shelley.

1344
01:10:41,142 --> 01:10:44,377
So as Shelley's watching
the story unfold,

1345
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:49,550
she starts to think that her
mother has another daughter

1346
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:51,451
and that she loves her more.

1347
01:10:52,153 --> 01:10:56,657
So she starts crying
and she's inconsolable

1348
01:10:56,691 --> 01:10:59,326
and Ruth cannot stop
this child crying.

1349
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:00,895
She's trying to stop her
and shushing her

1350
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:04,565
and getting Kleenex and
whatever and finally,

1351
01:11:04,599 --> 01:11:08,502
as there's this moving scene
between the mother and daughter

1352
01:11:08,536 --> 01:11:12,840
on screen, she stands up,
she points to the screen

1353
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:18,012
and she says, "That's
not my daughter."

1354
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:24,018
And then lights come up
and the projector goes off,

1355
01:11:24,051 --> 01:11:27,387
everybody turns around
to look at them.

1356
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,857
And in her grand way she says,

1357
01:11:29,891 --> 01:11:33,528
"Thank you, thank you,
carry on please."

1358
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:36,664
- To Ruth.
- To Ruth.

1359
01:11:36,697 --> 01:11:37,799
- To Ruth.

1360
01:11:37,832 --> 01:11:40,433
- Oh your mother was glamorous.

1361
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:42,537
- Very glam.

1362
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:45,773
- She was. I envied that
confidence that she had.

1363
01:11:45,807 --> 01:11:48,709
Natalie had it, that confidence.

1364
01:11:48,743 --> 01:11:49,844
- Mm, she did.

1365
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:53,781
- I didn't, I was the
little ugly duckling child.

1366
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:54,749
- Oh, stop.

1367
01:11:54,782 --> 01:11:55,783
- Not ugly
- I was, I was.

1368
01:11:55,817 --> 01:11:57,618
- I wonder how you turned out.

1369
01:11:58,619 --> 01:11:59,587
- Bitter.

1370
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:00,521
- It's interesting about
mothers and daughters

1371
01:12:00,555 --> 01:12:02,957
and if your daughter
isn't in your image,

1372
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:06,393
what you do to either make
her seem more like you,

1373
01:12:06,426 --> 01:12:08,830
or just the path
towards acceptance,

1374
01:12:08,863 --> 01:12:12,066
if they really aren't
a mini me or,

1375
01:12:12,099 --> 01:12:14,969
they're different from
you, just how you navigate.

1376
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:16,571
- Everyone's looking at me now.

1377
01:12:18,139 --> 01:12:18,973
- Well.

1378
01:12:20,975 --> 01:12:24,779
- Well, pretty was
important to her, looks.

1379
01:12:26,113 --> 01:12:27,915
- Yeah, there's a
premium on that.

1380
01:12:27,949 --> 01:12:29,917
- But it's important
to women right?

1381
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:33,054
- I'm pretty sure she saw
that as a power that's true,

1382
01:12:33,087 --> 01:12:35,590
but gee, she was so kind to me.

1383
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:42,129
She took me in when my
mother found another man,

1384
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:45,132
and I came only, I knocked
on the door, I said, Ruth.

1385
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:47,535
And she said, look, come on in.

1386
01:12:47,568 --> 01:12:49,804
She's very kind, she
never said anything right?

1387
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:50,771
To any of you?

1388
01:12:50,805 --> 01:12:52,106
- No.

1389
01:12:52,139 --> 01:12:54,141
- Ruth, thank you.
- That's amazing.

1390
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:56,644
- I think I'd wanna leave
behind this idea

1391
01:12:56,677 --> 01:12:58,179
and I know I've told
Nat about this,

1392
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:01,949
that friendship, it
actually takes effort,

1393
01:13:01,983 --> 01:13:04,886
that you have to really
in the same way,

1394
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:08,055
marriage or a career,
that with friendships,

1395
01:13:08,089 --> 01:13:10,524
you really do have
to be the one,

1396
01:13:10,558 --> 01:13:12,193
I mean, this is something
that I've learned,

1397
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:15,696
just over the years to
keep reaching out,

1398
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:16,998
to keep making the effort.

1399
01:13:17,031 --> 01:13:19,466
Sometimes friends can
be going through things

1400
01:13:19,499 --> 01:13:20,801
and it might feel personal,

1401
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:23,470
and actually just what
gets stitched together,

1402
01:13:23,503 --> 01:13:25,840
when you keep reaching out,
which is...

1403
01:13:28,776 --> 01:13:29,777
- Are you okay?

1404
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:30,645
- I'm giving you a stroke?

1405
01:13:30,678 --> 01:13:31,579
- No it.

1406
01:13:33,614 --> 01:13:34,982
- Oh mm.

1407
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:37,985
- What dear?

1408
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:40,187
- What did you put in this?

1409
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:43,991
- I mean, no I'm sorry.

1410
01:13:46,994 --> 01:13:51,098
It was a privilege to be
with your mother.

1411
01:13:51,132 --> 01:13:52,033
- Yes.

1412
01:13:56,003 --> 01:13:58,539
- And if anything happens
to me I want you there.

1413
01:13:58,572 --> 01:14:00,508
- Mm, righty-o.

1414
01:14:01,742 --> 01:14:03,010
- Do you want me there?

1415
01:14:04,612 --> 01:14:05,478
- All right.

1416
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,949
I love you, I want you-

1417
01:14:07,982 --> 01:14:09,917
I want you all there.

1418
01:14:11,953 --> 01:14:14,822
- I have all the people
that I love so much here,

1419
01:14:14,855 --> 01:14:17,925
to pay tribute to our
dear friend.

1420
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:21,095
- Happy birthday Natalie!

1421
01:14:22,563 --> 01:14:25,232
- I'm just so happy to
have us all together.

1422
01:14:26,968 --> 01:14:30,771
You know because it's
been too long.

1423
01:14:30,805 --> 01:14:31,706
- It's true.

1424
01:14:32,773 --> 01:14:35,042
- Especially that we
could be here

1425
01:14:35,076 --> 01:14:40,047
to celebrate this wonderful day.

1426
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:43,084
Because-

1427
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:50,591
cause we didn't know if
we would ever be able

1428
01:14:50,624 --> 01:14:54,729
to celebrate your 41st
birthday together.

1429
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,498
We didn't know if you
would be here,

1430
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,137
and here you are.

1431
01:15:05,272 --> 01:15:06,640
- Oh, no honey.

1432
01:15:09,643 --> 01:15:10,778
Um-

1433
01:15:10,811 --> 01:15:11,679
Val,

1434
01:15:13,714 --> 01:15:15,149
I changed my hair.

1435
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:16,083
- Oh.

1436
01:15:16,117 --> 01:15:20,755
- And so I look a little
more like Natalie

1437
01:15:20,788 --> 01:15:26,127
than I usually do, but I'm
Shelley, I'm, Natalie's sister.

1438
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:31,565
- Shelley.

1439
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:32,967
- Yeah.

1440
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,537
- Right sweetie, it's
Shelley okay?

1441
01:15:37,805 --> 01:15:38,706
- Okay.

1442
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,674
- Okay.

1443
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:41,609
- Sweetie?

1444
01:15:42,276 --> 01:15:43,044
- Oh Christ.

1445
01:15:43,077 --> 01:15:44,745
- Don't be scared
it's all right.

1446
01:15:44,779 --> 01:15:45,646
- Deep breath.

1447
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:46,814
- I, um,

1448
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:51,619
yeah, I think I'll give
Lizzie a call.

1449
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,021
- That's a good idea.

1450
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:54,889
- It's Christmas and-

1451
01:15:54,922 --> 01:15:56,090
- Okay.

1452
01:15:56,123 --> 01:15:57,758
- I'll go find my phone.

1453
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:09,570
- Oh, sweetie, it's all right.

1454
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:11,238
It's all right, it's
been coming.

1455
01:16:11,272 --> 01:16:13,374
- All the times that I
wanted to be Natalie,

1456
01:16:13,407 --> 01:16:16,310
I've never wanted it
more than just...

1457
01:16:17,078 --> 01:16:19,914
- You handled that very well,
you're so very wonderful.

1458
01:16:19,947 --> 01:16:23,184
- Oh here it is,
I think, here it is.

1459
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:28,222
I'll just give her a call.

1460
01:16:32,026 --> 01:16:36,597
<i>- Hey, Merry Merry Happy Happy.</i>

1461
01:16:36,997 --> 01:16:38,632
- Hey, hey.

1462
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:41,235
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

1463
01:16:43,037 --> 01:16:47,241
- You know, Lizzie, I think

1464
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,680
I think I, something isn't,

1465
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,015
I think I need your help.

1466
01:16:55,049 --> 01:16:56,617
I think I need your help.

1467
01:16:58,719 --> 01:16:59,787
<i>- Okay.</i>

1468
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,188
- Um,

1469
01:17:01,222 --> 01:17:04,391
you know, I think there's,

1470
01:17:04,425 --> 01:17:05,092
<i>- Val?</i>

1471
01:17:05,126 --> 01:17:08,129
I think there's something wrong.

1472
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:09,730
<i>- Okay.</i>

1473
01:17:09,763 --> 01:17:12,099
- I think I can see that
there's something wrong,

1474
01:17:12,133 --> 01:17:14,368
and um I need you to...

1475
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:17,338
<i>- Val what?</i>

1476
01:17:18,973 --> 01:17:22,309
- I need you come
and be with me.

1477
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:23,310
<i>- Okay.</i>

1478
01:17:23,344 --> 01:17:24,111
- Okay?

1479
01:17:24,145 --> 01:17:25,713
<i>- Yes, Val.</i>

1480
01:17:25,746 --> 01:17:26,313
- Okay.

1481
01:17:26,347 --> 01:17:26,881
<i>- Who is-</i>

1482
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:28,149
<i>Are you by yourself?</i>

1483
01:17:28,182 --> 01:17:30,050
- No no, I have my

1484
01:17:30,084 --> 01:17:31,352
<i>- Who's there?</i>

1485
01:17:31,385 --> 01:17:33,821
- I have my friends here.
- Everybody's here.

1486
01:17:35,055 --> 01:17:36,157
- Here's Rheza.

1487
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:37,057
<i>- What's going on?</i>

1488
01:17:37,091 --> 01:17:38,692
- Hi sweetie, its Rheza.

1489
01:17:39,894 --> 01:17:42,897
Hey take it easy
everybody's here,

1490
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:46,200
we'd love it if we could talk
to you a little bit later?

1491
01:17:46,233 --> 01:17:47,268
All right?
<i>- Okay.</i>

1492
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:49,103
- Cause Val's just a little,

1493
01:17:49,136 --> 01:17:52,106
you know, she's a little tired,
roll on tired.

1494
01:17:52,507 --> 01:17:57,077
She's got loving arms around
her all night tonight, okay?

1495
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:58,746
Why don't you say goodnight.

- That was good now I
feel better.

1522
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:46,961
Thank you, everybody.

1523
01:18:46,994 --> 01:18:49,163
- You know I was just thinking,

1524
01:18:49,196 --> 01:18:50,798
I don't think
tomorrow's a good day

1525
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:52,399
to go spread these ashes.

1526
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:55,970
- No, that's, it's
important that we do it.

1527
01:18:56,003 --> 01:18:57,404
I think we should do it.

1528
01:18:57,438 --> 01:19:00,374
And I feel better now and I,

1529
01:19:00,407 --> 01:19:03,310
who knows how I'll feel
if we wait so,

1530
01:19:03,344 --> 01:19:05,913
I think we should do it
now, I wanna be here for it.

1531
01:19:07,214 --> 01:19:08,816
- You're right.
- Okay.

1532
01:19:08,849 --> 01:19:09,850
- You are right.

1533
01:19:09,883 --> 01:19:10,552
- Good.

1534

- We're doing it.
- Great.

1535
01:19:11,852 --> 01:19:12,520

1536
01:19:12,554 --> 01:19:13,420

- Yes.

1538

Love and friendship.
