1
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:24,556
If you're watching this, I guess...

2
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,753
I'm dead.

3
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,601
If you're watching this
and I'm not...

4
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,799
then everything is fucked,
and I might as well be.

5
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:44,510
You know most people bitch, about...

6
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:49,014
the awful shit that happens
in world and they sit around...

7
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:52,780
and they wait for it all,
to sort itself out...

8
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,686
and it does.

9
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:02,361
All the bleeding stops, eventually.

10
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,898
Death is certain...

11
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,400
and life is far from it.

12
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,838
Jesus says "Turn The Other Cheek",
and God says "An Eye For An Eye".

13
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:18,436
Even in the Bible you've got to make
choices, you stop... and life is over.

14
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,614
Only you spend years, with
your ass pasted to a couch.

15
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,946
I took control.

16
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,556
Now I might, not of my life...

17
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,158
but of the circumstances...

18
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,660
of my death.

19
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:39,291
and in doing so, it means
everything that came before.

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,407
You think that'll be enough?

21
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:56,315
I don't know, but I tell
you what, man.

22
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,517
When I come knocking
on them purely gates...

23
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,748
St. Peter ain't gonna have to
look my name up in no book.

24
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:07,225
the
insurgents

25
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,717
6 months ago

26
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,098
Give me a Scotch,
single malt, lemon twist.

27
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,767
- Vodka Gimlet.
- Vodka Gimlet?

28
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,929
What kind of Vodka?

29
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,198
Christ, never mind,
make'm both Scotch.

30
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,045
It's 9 bucks.

31
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,214
Keep the change.

32
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,340
- Come here often?
- Seriously?

33
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,742
Imagine me, in a dump.

34
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,779
I bet your lying.

35
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,281
What'd you drink?

36
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,016
What? You're the wing-man?

37
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,280
Don't think, you need a wing-man.

38
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,021
So, what's your name?

39
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,390
Why? You wont remember
it in the morning.

40
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,059
So long as we understand
each other.

41
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,289
Yeah, like trusting you.

42
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,197
How about the 3 of us,
go back to the suite?

43
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:03,156
You can suck on my cock, while
my friend humps you in the ass.

44
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,040
This is a joke, right?

45
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,708
You think I'm kidding?

46
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,810
I can read you like a book.

47
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,379
- A dirty book.
- With the pages stuck together.

48
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,480
Hey fellows!

49
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,215
Leave the lady alone.

50
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,918
Listen, friend, this has
nothing to do with you.

51
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,119
Why'd you get lost?

52
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,989
I just wanna say, first of
all, I'm not your friend and...

53
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,457
second!

54
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,062
Let's go.

55
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,090
Gotta go!

56
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,790
Gotta go!

57
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,208
You know, I could've
handle it myself.

58
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,544
I know, just thought,
I save you the trouble.

59
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,714
- That's so considered.
- That's what my daddy thought me.

60
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:50,248
Did he teach you to fight dirty?

61
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,918
No, that was my mama.

62
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,054
- What's your name?
- James.

63
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,022
Thank you, James.

64
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,461
For to long this country has...

65
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,696
sat on it's well fed hunches...

66
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:08,033
fiddling with their remote,
while the world burned.

67
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,870
Poverty, Aids, Genocide...

68
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,340
Melting Ice-caps,
spiking Oil-prices.

69
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,476
Our phone-calls are monitored...

70
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,945
our homes watch from space.

71
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,615
And what are we the people,
prepared to do about it?

72
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,385
Our For-fathers fought
a bloody war...

73
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,288
to free the nation,
from old King George.

74
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,157
"Don't" treat on me, they said.

75
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,250
Death to Tyrants.

76
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,797
Where has that Spirit gone?

77
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:42,100
We believe that the
Election was stolen...

78
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,704
We believe that the Constitution,
is being compromised...

79
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,774
that our Liberties and Freedom
being robbed from us...

80
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,842
in the name of Security...

81
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:56,148
if you're opposed to torture, to
think of Detention-camps, to murder...

82
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,676
and what are you as a person,
prepared to do about it?

83
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,589
Don't mistake passivity,
for morality.

84
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:11,029
Wake-up, Rise-up, Over-come.

85
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:19,304
- That's perfect.
- Yeah? Okay.

86
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,611
3 years ago

87
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,600
It's save to say, that George Orwell’s'
novel from 1984 has come to passed.

88
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,202
But it's interesting to know...

89
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:54,973
the level, to which his utopian vision
of the future has already been surpassed.

90
00:07:54,974 --> 00:08:00,378
For example, in 1900 the N.Y.City
Police-force, numbered 7,500...

91
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,048
per population of 3.5 million.

92
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,251
A hundred years later, the
population is barely doubled...

93
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,987
but the Police-force,
has grown to 40,000.

94
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,722
N.Y.City has a standing Army...

95
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,590
roughly equivalent, to a
Mid-size European Nation.

96
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,729
It's budget is 3 billon dollars.

97
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,866
Now, you combine that with
the Fire-department budget...

98
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:24,903
N.Y.City spends more on Security,
then the nuclear states of Pakistan...

99
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,705
and North Korea.

100
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,708
N.Y.City has a larger
Security budget...

101
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:34,412
then Iran, Syria, Libya
and Cuba combined.

102
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:39,618
George Orwell said "Freedom" is the
Freedom to say, that 2 + 2 equals 4.

103
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,687
If that is granted, then
everything else follows.

104
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,890
So, let me ask you...

105
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:50,055
what do you think all
these cops, add up to?

106
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,932
- I love your book.
- Thank you.

107
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,967
- You're Ann, right?
- With an "e".

108
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,935
Anne with an "e".

109
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,431
Thank you.

110
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

111
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,808
I thought... huh, what you
said, made a lot of sense.

112
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,547
Would you like our signet?

113
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,582
I... huh, don't have a copy.

114
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,608
That's alright, there's plenty to go
around, who should I make it out to?

115
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,382
Hanna, but don't.

116
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,084
Hanna, "but don't"?

117
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:23,194
I can't... I can't waste
money on a book.

118
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,329
Hey! Waste?

119
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,166
I don't mean waste, like...
it'll be thrown away, I just...

120
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,261
This one's on the house.

121
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:34,764
Now, the worst thing you'll
be wasting is your time.

122
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,872
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

123
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,224
It is true that our founding
fathers were Atheists?

124
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,392
No, Theists.

125
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:58,229
They believed in a creator, they just
didn't believe in a particular religion.

126
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,633
- So, then how did it get like this?
- Like what?

127
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,035
So religious and judgmental.

128
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,737
They're not actually
the same thing.

129
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,707
Well. you know what I mean,
were we all so angry?

130
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,241
There was a Civil-war.

131
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,336
Yeah, but that was about
freeing the slaves, right?

132
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,914
Voltaire said...

133
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,351
So long as the people do not
care to exercise their Freedom...

134
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,753
those who wish to tyrannies,
will do so.

135
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,223
The Tyrants are active
and ardent...

136
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:29,227
and will devote themselves, in
the name of any number of Gods...

137
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,996
religious and otherwise...

138
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:35,194
to put shackles
upon sleepy men.

139
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,194
Who is Voltaire?

140
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,769
A Frenchmen.

141
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,000
You know what a Patriot is?

142
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,946
Huh... some one who
loves their country.

143
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,315
A person who defends
their country.

144
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,918
Nathan Hale, was a Patriot.

145
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,052
Malcolm X.

146
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,656
- Malcolm X, was a... a Moslem, right?
- That's right.

147
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,691
Didn't he hate America?

148
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:05,323
Well, at times, I'm sure he did, but
still, he defended her from injustice.

149
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:10,358
I never saw the movie.

150
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,903
Hm-mm.

151
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:14,331
Can I have the book back?

152
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,777
- Oh, no, I... I didn't mean to, huh...
- No. that's okay, no, no.

153
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,979
This is how to get a hold of me.

154
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,651
I run a group discussion.
I do politics mostly.

155
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:30,212
But there is hot
food and coffee and...

156
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,485
you should think about coming.

157
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,688
Okay, maybe I will.

158
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,368
The ride North was cake.

159
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,104
Anything we
got on our way...

160
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,841
we patch up and lined it
with depleted uranium.

161
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,410
No dealers.

162
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:57,182
Just shit they scraped
out of nuclear reactors.

163
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,984
Half life is 4.5 billion years.

164
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,818
We get to Bagdad,
everything is cool.

165
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,424
That's when Saddam
got his 4th of July.

166
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:17,829
Then 4 black men get strung up in
Felucca, everything goes to shit.

167
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:25,941
They ordered us to, capture
the responsible parties.

168
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,347
The hell, everyone's responsible.

169
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,375
What the fuck were those contractors
doing there in the first place?

170
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:39,584
So they get shot and we
have to waste an entire city.

171
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,318
And there Humvee...

172
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,695
we couldn't I.D.

173
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:53,735
And that fucker
split my leg open.

174
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:57,698
I nearly bleed to death.

175
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,009
It was 6 months, before I could
walk again and never expected...

176
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,021
getting wounded as
part of the deal.

177
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:12,991
Well, I couldn't get my
head around this...

178
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:17,328
4 days in, we finely had the fuckers
on the run, then they order us off.

179
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,831
Why?

180
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,000
Because there's an election...

181
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:26,738
and death Marines cost votes.

182
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,241
Then 4 days after the election
they ordered us back in.

183
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,344
Called it "Operation
Phantom and Fury", why?

184
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:38,407
It was bull-shit, I was a Carney
they brought to the desert...

185
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:43,488
so wise up America.

186
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,425
The only W.O.M.D's
are the ones we dropped.

187
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,020
And the terrorist are there
because we need an enemy.

188
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:56,301
With an Army, that gives
billions to corporations.

189
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,071
But cuts benefits for veterans.

190
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,267
Fuck'm.

191
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,947
The first man to die, in
the American Revolution...

192
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,507
was a black man.

193
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,247
Crispus Attucks.

194
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,592
Do you think the British
called him a hero?

195
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,924
Hell, no.

196
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,658
He was an insurgent.

197
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,904
So were the founding fathers.

198
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,963
And so are we.

199
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,277
6 years ago

200
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,546
It's dark in here.

201
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,014
Yeah.

202
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,543
- That's the way I like it.
- Oh yeah?

203
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,658
- Wait, hold on, hold on.
- Hm-mm?

204
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,060
I wanna look at you.

205
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:02,758
You like what you see?

206
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,004
Still would prefer blonds.

207
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,240
A good thing you just pretend one.

208
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,266
You got a radio in this place?

209
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,918
- You know you gonna have to...
- What?

210
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,793
Pretence.

211
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,852
I like to pretend.

212
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,766
Come on, let's dance.

213
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,733
I can't.

214
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,829
Come on, baby.

215
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,202
Stop this, I can't.

216
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,845
You know, it's only sometimes
when a girl says, let's dance...

217
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,711
I know, I know.

218
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,086
I'm not your type?

219
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,656
Girl, you're every mans type.

220
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,036
You don't like me.

221
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,614
I told you I was in a wreck, right?

222
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,207
Yeah.

223
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,613
Why do you think I'm home early?

224
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,054
I don't know, they let you out.

225
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,893
Why do you think they
let me come out early?

226
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:44,695
You got hurt or something,
but... you look fine.

227
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,372
Oh, Honey, I... I'm sorry.

228
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,449
Comes with the Territory.

229
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,077
But you're gonna get better, right?

230
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,683
Lie back.

231
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,499
Touch yourself.

232
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,997
You wanna watch?

233
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,704
I don't mind.

234
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,894
I think you should go.

235
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,563
We don't have to do anything,
we can just talk.

236
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,272
I thought I'd be ready, but...

237
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,401
Come here, come lay down.

238
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,947
Tell me about the war.

239
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,959
Should be one in the desk.

240
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,543
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

241
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,481
- Wait, there's somethin' else.
- Like what?

242
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,023
A souvenir.

243
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,410
What'd you think?

244
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,538
I'll do, man.

245
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,957
- What?
- Keys, let's have'm.

246
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,154
Get the fuck in.

247
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,691
Great.

248
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,519
Artisan aquA

249
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,900
Well, that was easy enough.

250
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,202
It only get's tougher from here.

251
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:52,817
- You're not nervous, are you?
- And, you ain't?

252
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:53,851
No.

253
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,814
I think you're full of shit,
everybody get's nervous.

254
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,527
What you and Robert want with
a truck full of water anyway?

255
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,655
How should I know?

256
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,965
He tells you things.

257
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,492
He tells everybody things,
you just have to listen.

258
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:16,135
It's been good listening.
I'm ready to do.

259
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:21,012
A time like this,
you gotta have patience.

260
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,480
That's what I'm talking about.

261
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,083
I don't mind waiting, why the
hell would somebody steal water?

262
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,918
You said you wanted do something.

263
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,589
Like something big, man,
this is Teen-age shit.

264
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,459
It's grand larceny, class B
felony, punishable by 25 years.

265
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,289
You mean we'd go to prison?

266
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,531
What's some black men you
think doing in a prison?

267
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,505
He didn't know shit about the law.

268
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,574
What's an educated black man
you think doing in a prison?

269
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,372
Have you?

270
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,846
Let me tell you something.

271
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,282
Prison is a plantation
by another name.

272
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,274
The government makes millions
of them with labor.

273
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:05,623
There's no Unions,
no minimum wage.

274
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,726
A black man is 50 times more
likely to be incarcerated...

275
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:11,688
than a white man, for the
same exact offence.

276
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,865
It's institutionalize slavery.

277
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,635
- Slavery, huh?
- Yes it is.

278
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,264
Maybe y'all should
stop selling drugs.

279
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,008
You think that's funny?

280
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,378
Because I could've gotten this
truck without your shitty ass...

281
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:28,979
Hey, I'm just saying.

282
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,450
You know you can't blame somebody
else forever, the Civil-war is over...

283
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,984
your people won.

284
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:37,088
Bull-shit, my people
didn't win a damn thing.

285
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,557
40 acres and a mule,
I'm still waiting.

286
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,253
If I buy you a Donkey,
would that square us?

287
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,030
What good's a Jack-ass
without the land?

288
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,204
I been to prison.

289
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,415
You've seen them (?) on TV.
naked and wire and shit.

290
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,645
I tell you, it's one fuckin' puck.

291
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,756
I tell you what, my parents they left
me some property, outside of Sheridan...

292
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:16,921
and there comes a time, if anything should
happened to me, I want you to have it.

293
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:19,764
Why me?

294
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,894
Well, it ain't 40 acres, but...

295
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,135
it's a start.

296
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,641
Hey man, don't talk like this.

297
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,474
- Nothin's gonna happen.
- If it does...

298
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:39,116
Look, one’ a this days you gonna have a
whole lot’ a (?), out there runnin'...

299
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,084
you gonna need that land.

300
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:45,445
I'm just saying, I'm not
going back to prison.

301
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,463
- Well, what'd you think?
- Perfect.

302
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,031
Bring it inside,
put in the yard.

303
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,262
Hey, how'd it go?

304
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,731
We got the truck.

305
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,427
- That's great.
- Yeah, it's a class B.

306
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:33,337
Class what?

307
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,805
Nothin'.

308
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,779
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

309
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,916
- You nervous?
- No, I'm not nervous.

310
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:49,045
- Just, huh...
- What?

311
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,099
Let's go some place,
just you and me.

312
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,367
To where?

313
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:06,036
I don't know, anywhere.

314
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:09,840
I can't just leave the
responsibilities, so do you.

315
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,376
Fuck responsibility.

316
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,579
Fuck Robert.

317
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:19,345
I meant to me, you're a
responsibility to me now.

318
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:22,286
That's what I'm saying.

319
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,022
What ever Robert's planning,
we haven't done anything.

320
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,924
Baby, we can start all over, okay?

321
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,992
You stole a truck.

322
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,795
I call Colby and tell'm
it was a mistake.

323
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,965
He don't give a shit,
call the police.

324
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:39,470
It doesn't matter, we'll go to Mexico,
we leave right now, like in the movies.

325
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,673
Listen to me, James,
I don't wanna go any where.

326
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,869
I'm not gonna go any where.

327
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,105
This thing matters, it's important.

328
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:50,478
Important to Robert.

329
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,754
It isn't his fault, James.
I haven't been brain-washed.

330
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,423
- Then tell me.
- What?

331
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,092
What is it, we're doing... here?

332
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,686
Hanna, really.

333
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:13,697
When I first met Robert, I thought
the world was against me.

334
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,803
It made me lonely and bitter...

335
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:24,815
and after those teachings,
I know the world is against me.

336
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,818
It isn't my fault...

337
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,412
and that makes me angry.

338
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,624
That teaches me faith...

339
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:38,721
and part of faith,
is not asking questions.

340
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,798
You're a fucking nut?

341
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,145
But once you embrace violence,
your results lose credibility...

342
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,713
- like in Seattle.
- Okay, fine, but...

343
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,880
that's my point exactly.

344
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,417
Before the direct action
in Seattle, nobody knew...

345
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:02,286
that the Anti-global-movement,
even existed.

346
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,623
Yeah, and afterwards no one cared, they
were the self described Anarchists.

347
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,760
Revolutions are never amassed fish.
you need a radicalized Vanguard.

348
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:13,268
And the challenge is,
in creating a group...

349
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:15,165
that is so disillusioned
with the status quo...

350
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,569
that they're willing to sacrifice
anything to change it.

351
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,237
Provoking government into...

352
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,140
waging war against their own people.

353
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,777
It's an incredible efficient
reason of accomplishing this.

354
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,472
By spilling blood?

355
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:33,751
The fact is, the harder they crack down,
the stronger the movement becomes.

356
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:37,087
In the 1960's the government infiltrated the
Left-wing and pushed it towards violence...

357
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,824
by the 1970's, the movement was dead.

358
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:45,529
Why, so what? Are you accusing
me of being a government agent?

359
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,833
Hey, he's accusing me of
being a government agent.

360
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,137
Hey, look, America
is a great frontier...

361
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:55,305
without the occasional
Forest-fire...

362
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,308
the next generation of trees,
will never grow.

363
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,810
- And you're the man to light the match?
- What?...

364
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:03,614
No, no, not me, not me at all,
I need others to stand with me.

365
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:07,217
I need those, who have nothing
to lose but their chains...

366
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,915
and the faith, that this great
country of ours, gonna be saved.

367
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,518
How many is that?

368
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,994
Fuck, if I know.

369
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:34,968
- Hey, what is this place?
- It's Roberts', he owns it.

370
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,523
Hey, how come we stole this thing...

371
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,288
and we're just gonna
dump all these out?

372
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,759
We need the bottles.

373
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,799
Hanna, would you get
the empty’s' inside.

374
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,745
Smells' like shit.

375
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,583
It's been closed for a while.

376
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,176
It'll be airing out now.

377
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,819
Fuses?

378
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,824
You're gonna build a bomb?

379
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,520
Mm-hm... a big one.

380
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,750
It's important to get the
the consistency right.

381
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,583
Not to dry, not to damp.

382
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,153
Why didn't you tell me?

383
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,197
Come on, you must have known.

384
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,265
You don't trust me?
Hanna!

385
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:04,835
She wanted to tell you,
and I told her not to.

386
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:05,869
Why?

387
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,905
Because, we all got
our roles to play.

388
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,600
Oh, yeah, what's mine?

389
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,203
The most important role of all.

390
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,983
So how long you think,
before it's finished?

391
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,653
Well, it's not the sort
of thing you can rush.

392
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,888
I know, but I wanna
hit them on Monday.

393
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,924
I wanna take advantage
of the new cycle.

394
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,326
I think we're gonna
be ready by then.

395
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,261
- Me too.
- Good.

396
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,667
What?

397
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,733
Do you think you'll
be ready on Monday?

398
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,873
Ready for what?
I still don't no shit.

399
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,508
We're gonna hit'm where it hurts.

400
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,910
You got enough to blow
a whole building.

401
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,901
2000 pounds.

402
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,114
What's the target?

403
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,641
The target in any revolutionary
action is the State.

404
00:30:55,342 --> 00:30:58,355
When you do this,
than people are gonna die.

405
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,457
- Politics change.
- Butchery.

406
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,794
Butchery, Peace-keeping,
Liberation, Occupation...

407
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,819
it's all just points of view.

408
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:10,928
Do you know how the army
liberates a village in Afghanistan?

409
00:31:10,929 --> 00:31:12,135
Do you?

410
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:16,273
From a C-130 Gun-ship
at 30,000 feet.

411
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:20,077
Do you think they care, if a few
civilians get caught up in that mix?

412
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,979
We're not talking about Afghanistan.

413
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,615
Oh they can't?
Death is death.

414
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:28,018
You kill civilians
you’re a murderer.

415
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,621
You kill enough of them
and you’re a mass murderer.

416
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,490
If you target civilians,
I agree.

417
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,059
But if your objective,
is political...

418
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,629
and civilians get in the way, then the
result is regrettable it's preventable...

419
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,466
but it does not rise, to the
moral equivalents of murder.

420
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:43,567
That is bull-shit, if death
is death, murder is murder.

421
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,771
James, how many people do you think
die in this country every day? 6600.

422
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,840
The tragedy is not
that people die...

423
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,639
it's the pathetic circumstances
in which live.

424
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:56,914
Yeah, you know what,
I agreed to do this, because...

425
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,998
I thought that... huh, maybe I could...
huh, do some good, help people.

426
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,353
- That's it for me, Gentlemen.
- I know what I promised.

427
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:05,656
I didn't realize that caper
went through the cemetery.

428
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:10,160
Don't be melodramatic, Truman killed
65,000 people in Hiroshima, alone.

429
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,261
That was war.

430
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,729
And this isn't?

431
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,167
I don't wanna be remembered
as another Timothy Mc Veigh.

432
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,169
History judges on success.

433
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,873
If we accomplish our goals, we'll be
remember't as men of good conscience.

434
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:24,705
If we don't...

435
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,611
I don't give a fuck what people
think of me, ones I'm gone.

436
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,714
- What about God?
- God?

437
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,251
I think that God
understands violence.

438
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,788
"All the first-born in
the land of Egypt shall die...

439
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:42,192
from the first-born of the Pharaoh,
to the first-born of the Maid servants".

440
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:45,629
Yeah, those rules are made pretty clear,
"I shall not kill".

441
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,532
Well, you should read the bible
before you quote it...

442
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,802
It says: "He that smudged a man, so that
he dies, should surely be put to death".

443
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,304
"He who cursed his mother and
father should be put to death".

444
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,973
Now come on, have you
ever cursed your parents?

445
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,274
Never in words, just wicked.

446
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,443
What about politicians and presidents?

447
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:03,246
It don't mean, that I know Gods plan
for this country, but I'm sure...

448
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:09,185
it does not include clamping electrodes,
to the testicles of prisoners.

449
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:12,447
Two wrongs don't make it right.

450
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,259
It's an eye for an eye, a tooth
for a tooth, a wound for a wound.

451
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,729
- A life for a life.
- Jesus said, "Turn the other cheek".

452
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,391
Is that what they did,
after September 11?

453
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,668
You see James, we live in old
Testament times.

454
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,796
The people want
"Fire and Brimstone".

455
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,814
You people are wrong.

456
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:41,852
That's my point,
revenge is for the wicked.

457
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,354
We all know what God
does to the wicked.

458
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,422
He snubs them.

459
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,090
With the edge of the sword...

460
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:51,118
we shall not spare them,
neither have pity nor mercy.

461
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,324
Neither should we.

462
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,188
Do you believe that shit?

463
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,021
James... it's important
that you understand...

464
00:34:22,022 --> 00:34:24,521
the things we're fighting for.

465
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,296
The things we're gonna win.

466
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:33,191
Why I see your lips moving,
but what I hear is Robert.

467
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:37,541
Are you James?
I hope not.

468
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,942
For your sake nothin' else.

469
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,905
You're up late.

470
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,839
You here to kill me?

471
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,934
What makes you think that?

472
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:20,183
- I might call the police.
- You're a rat?

473
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,284
No.

474
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,583
Then you have nothing to worry about.

475
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,591
- It's cold down here.
- Yeah.

476
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,802
Alright, so...

477
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:42,739
I do this, what I gotta... pull a
trigger, push a button or somethin'?

478
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,175
You park the truck,
we pick you up.

479
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,278
We detonate by remote and the
3 of us, get the hell out of town.

480
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,081
- The 3 of us?
- Yeah.

481
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,150
Robert's staying behind.

482
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,448
What for?

483
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:59,715
Start over, recruiting
another cell.

484
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,726
So it goes and...

485
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:08,591
Extremism in defense for liberty,
is no vice, James.

486
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:19,039
Look, I need you to tell me,
that this is the only way.

487
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,708
That would change things?

488
00:36:25,047 --> 00:36:26,908
Hm-mm?

489
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,285
One way,
to get inside peoples head.

490
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,381
This is how we cut through
all the static.

491
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,894
Like Oklahoma City.

492
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:41,565
No, the public wasn't ready then.

493
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,802
- But they're ready now.
- Hm-mm.

494
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:49,739
September 11th, opened our
minds to possibilities.

495
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,003
I ain't afraid to die.

496
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,744
And that's why we need you.

497
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,681
Hanna is not dumb.

498
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,633
Yeah.

499
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,035
I know.

500
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,874
Hey, wake up.

501
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,573
Something we gotta do.

502
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,759
- What's going on?
- We're making Video-tapes.

503
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,028
- Of what?
- Testimonials.

504
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,963
If anything goes wrong.

505
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,733
I'll have them released
to the media.

506
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:50,867
Seriously?

507
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,371
Well, if they try
to dehumanize us...

508
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:55,071
I wanna make certain
our message gets out.

509
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,541
Where you want this?

510
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,100
Huh, right here.

511
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,347
Well, I don't know what to say.

512
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,816
Just speak from the heart.

513
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,609
It's all set.

514
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,747
Alright?

515
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,392
Our country was founded
on the principles...

516
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,828
that all men are created
with equal rights...

517
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:21,698
and obligations to defend
themselves from tyranny.

518
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:26,036
But with out consent to be governed,
there can be no government.

519
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:29,172
There is no higher authority,
than our own good judgment...

520
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:30,407
and common sense.

521
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:34,411
And this consent is the privilege
of every citizen to give...

522
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:38,448
and their inalienable
right to take away.

523
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,050
Not just every 4 years, but...

524
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:44,287
whenever oppression
threatens liberty.

525
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,092
The cost of Freedom
has always been high...

526
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:49,492
and Americans have always paid it.

527
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:53,797
With our bounty, with our blood.

528
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:58,902
But what have we been ask to sacrifice,
in this new global war on terror?

529
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,997
Freedom itself.

530
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:08,403
The world changed on September 11,
3000 Americans died.

531
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,515
What did their life’s purchase?

532
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,485
A Military debacle in the Middle-east.

533
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:19,456
A Nation cynically divided,
for political gain...

534
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:24,792
and a Constitution, that has been
systematically undermined and perverted.

535
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:30,162
Is this how we honor our dead?

536
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:35,138
What was done once,
can be done again.

537
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,607
The world can change for a 2nd time.

538
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,643
Not backwards in to Empire.

539
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:47,050
But forward, in to Truth,
and Justice and Democracy.

540
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:52,789
That is my burden,
that is my crime.

541
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,282
That is my privilege.

542
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,631
I don't ask forgiveness...

543
00:39:57,632 --> 00:40:01,631
but I demand that you
understand my reasons.

544
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:06,202
What we plan to do,
we do for those who died.

545
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:08,805
For those who live...

546
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:14,175
and for those of you,
who are about to die.

547
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,014
More tea?

548
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,277
Thank you.

549
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,386
You look good.

550
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,662
Retirement suits me.

551
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,996
- I'm happy for you.
- And for you.

552
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,903
The King is death.

553
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,531
So, long live the Queen.

554
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,848
Why did you leave, Robert?

555
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,616
We've been over this.

556
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,821
We all burn out.
Not all of us quit.

557
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,924
- I guess, I reached that point.
- Which point?

558
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,926
You can't wash the stink
off your hands.

559
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:06,463
- I never pecked you for an Idealist.
- Maybe once.

560
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,934
But now, I'm a full-time Historian,
I like the facts speak for themselves.

561
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,370
- The book.
- Did you read it?

562
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:17,640
- I read the report on it.
- And?

563
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,043
You're out of the game now, right?

564
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,344
That's right.

565
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:24,780
So, why do you care,
how thick your file is?

566
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,880
At least somebody bought a copy.

567
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,992
They say writing is
a lonely profession.

568
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,827
I got many people around me.

569
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,430
- Other writers?
- Friends.

570
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,966
- You entertain?
- I try to stay involved.

571
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,802
The lectures, meetings,
and so forth.

572
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,203
You should stop by sometime.

573
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:55,843
- We're friends, aren't we, Robert?
- I like to think so.

574
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,515
If you saw a friend...

575
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,918
heading for trouble, you have to
do something about, wouldn't you?

576
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,284
Yeah, it's an obligation.

577
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,092
I'm gonna ask you something...

578
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,460
and I want you to think carefully,
before you answer.

579
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,857
Of course.

580
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,135
Are you involved in anything,
we should know about?

581
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,001
No.

582
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,773
No, you're not involved in anything?...

583
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,942
Or no, we shouldn’t know about it?

584
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,011
Please, you should phrase
your questions more careful.

585
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,046
- There are limits, Robert.
- You're right...

586
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,082
there are limits!
There are limits...

587
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,352
to what people can do,
or can be allowed to do.

588
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,289
Before their actions,
demand a reaction.

589
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,093
A preemption by force, or by
whatever means necessary...

590
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,161
to draw the lines,
which can not be crossed...

591
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,689
and there are injustices, which
must not be allowed to stand.

592
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:55,367
So long as we understand each other.

593
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,745
How do you know
that's the right wire?

594
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,614
Circuits.

595
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,850
Really? And how you know
it's the right circuit?

596
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:12,121
That's why Robert,
pays me a big bonus.

597
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:15,819
But what, if it doesn't work?

598
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:19,028
There's only one way to find out.

599
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:22,987
- Oh, no, no, thanks.
- Watch how it's done.

600
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,570
Alright, what'd I do?

601
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:31,074
That's programmable, one number
lights the fuse, another shuts it off.

602
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,542
What's the number to detonate?

603
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:39,041
- 1776.
- Cute.

604
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,418
Go ahead.

605
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,394
What, that's it?

606
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:55,598
Well, you have to imagine it wired
to a 1000 pounds of explosives.

607
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,070
- Well, then how do you test it?
- You don't test it...

608
00:43:58,071 --> 00:44:00,570
you just have to trust it's
gonna work out the 1st time.

609
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,772
What if there's no signal?

610
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,775
It can always be
detonated manually.

611
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:09,040
Then that extra man,
has to flip the switch.

612
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,314
Well, it's better
than getting caught.

613
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,550
They fly you over the ocean and
then drop you out of the plane.

614
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:17,020
Why waist a cell at Guantanamo.

615
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:20,149
- So, who's gonna drive?
- We need a patsy.

616
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,892
Just like with Oswald,
but that's obvious.

617
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,128
So, how do you find
some one like that?

618
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,296
Actually Hanna, that's your job.

619
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,699
You're the Honey-pot.

620
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,767
Ah... what does that mean?

621
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,071
You know the C.I.A. Play,
you catch a bear with honey.

622
00:44:33,072 --> 00:44:35,271
Yeah, I know what a Honey-pot is.

623
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,041
And where exactly am I
supposed to find this guy?

624
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:40,243
- Take as much time as you need.
- You mean, you want me to fuck'm?

625
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,446
All of us have made sacrifices,
to reach this point.

626
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:46,381
Now what is one more,
when the end is so near?

627
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,259
So, what'd you think?

628
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,695
It's... huh, I like it.

629
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,264
Well no, I mean my friends.

630
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,099
- Yeah... huh, they seem nice.
- Yeah?

631
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:06,569
Robert has a lot of ideas.

632
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:10,139
Well, I gotta be honest,
all that political stuff...

633
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,775
just goes right over my head.

634
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,778
You know, sometimes
the truth can be...

635
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,448
overwhelming sometimes and...

636
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,384
but also illuminating.

637
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:26,048
You know? It works for me.

638
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,261
You know?

639
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,990
You know, as long as
we're being honest, in here...

640
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:39,902
I just wanna tell you,
I think that you're...

641
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,337
incredibly sexy.

642
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,841
Isn't it kind’ a rare, you're
living here with those 2 guys?

643
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,845
No, I'm not sleeping with them,
if that's what you worried about.

644
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:52,615
- No, but it's just so...
- So...

645
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:55,118
- Intense.
- Is that a problem for you?

646
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,247
- What?
- Intensity.

647
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:05,394
- No, ma'am.
- Oh, well, that's a good boy.

648
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,795
Yeah, let's go over it again.

649
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:11,200
I got it, alright?

650
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,464
Assure me.

651
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,374
The truck's gonna fuel,
and I leave at 8:00am sharp.

652
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,177
Marcus and Hanna
gonna follow behind...

653
00:46:19,178 --> 00:46:21,177
take the Blvd. to the
Express-way and then Down-town.

654
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,479
- How many exits?
- 5 exits...

655
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,316
take a left off the ramp, 3 lights,
then take a right on 12th street.

656
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,051
Target's a half mile
down on the right.

657
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,952
And what happens
when you get there?

658
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:35,792
I'm the water guy, nobody
looks twice at the water guy.

659
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,395
- But if they do?
- I smile and pull in anyway.

660
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:42,660
I'll be waiting,
to pick you up.

661
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,237
Hey, what's so special
about this building anyway?

662
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:50,106
- It's the target.
- Yeah, I know it is.

663
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:56,535
But... huh, what's so special about
it, that y'all risk our life’s?

664
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,649
Secrets.

665
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,349
Secrets? That's it,
that's all you gonna say?

666
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,819
Secrets, that need to be buried.

667
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,717
Is that a problem?

668
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,093
No, ma'am.
How should I approach'em?

669
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:18,461
There's a... weak link.

670
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,664
She's their Honey-pot.

671
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,734
I never thought of myself,
as the honey type.

672
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,312
You'll do.

673
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:32,982
The key is not to show to much,
let them underestimate you.

674
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:37,286
- An old country boy like me.
- Cut the corn, Paul.

675
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:38,421
Sorry.

676
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,757
You fuck this up and
people are gonna die.

677
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,816
Yes, ma'am.

678
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:47,129
Let Robert, rail against the
Iniquities of the world...

679
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,928
let him march, you're job
is to keep him save.

680
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,103
- From himself?
- From his good intentions.

681
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:57,240
And from us, we owe him that much.

682
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,539
And if he decides to go ahead?

683
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,838
We burn that bridge,
when we come to it.

684
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,820
What's wrong?

685
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:12,955
It don't feel right,
to celebrate.

686
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,524
It's the turning point,
in the History of our country.

687
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:21,063
Yeah, I... huh, can't shake the idea,
that we're the bad guys, of sorts.

688
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,395
Oh, come on, you really feel that way?

689
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:30,130
Alright, then let us tell
you a story, about bad guys.

690
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,012
How many hours did the
High-jackers have?

691
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:39,282
- The 9/11 High-jackers?
- Yeah, how many flight hours...

692
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:43,052
did they have as pilots,
in those types of Jets?

693
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:46,055
- I have no idea.
- Guess.

694
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,523
- A few.
- None.

695
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:51,527
And yet each of their
targets were shot.

696
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:54,553
- They got lucky.
- Very lucky.

697
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:58,701
Now, flight 77 was flown
by Hani Hanjour.

698
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:02,371
Hanjour had tried to rent a Cessna
a month before the attacks...

699
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:06,709
but he had such difficulty landing, the
flight school refused to let him fly solo.

700
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,612
But ever since the F.B.I.
said he had been practicing.

701
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,415
The section of the Pentagon that
Hanjour crashed his plane into...

702
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,783
was under construction.

703
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,320
They were having constructing
surviving a missile attack.

704
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:20,957
because the terrorist crashed
into the one part of the building...

705
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,493
that was specifically designed
to withstand the impact.

706
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:29,055
And the Top-Brass...
were sitting on the other side.

707
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,902
What if the High-jackers was
getting set for the generals.

708
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,270
James, that's a lot’ a luck.

709
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:36,706
Maybe that was about the
closest to dive back.

710
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,175
You might think so,
but... in fact...

711
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:41,944
the plane had to
veer miles of course...

712
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:45,314
and circle around, to strike
the Pentagon from behind.

713
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:49,652
Okay, now Imagine this...
at 500 miles an hour...

714
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:54,790
Hanjour... executes
a 270 degree turn...

715
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,761
dropping the plane
7000 feet in 2 minutes...

716
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:01,597
and then at 30 feet above
the ground, he levels off...

717
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:05,201
and slams in to the Pentagon
with pin-point accuracy.

718
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:08,204
And this from a guy,
who couldn't land a Cessna?

719
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,439
What's your point?

720
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,443
James, if you add up all the people
in the planes, in the towers...

721
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:17,546
in the Pentagon, how many people
do you think that is?

722
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:20,383
- Thousands.
- Ninety thousand.

723
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:23,319
And how many people, do you
think died in the attacks?

724
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,956
Two thousand, nine hundred,
eighty-six.

725
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,092
So, the remarkable thing about 9/11,
is not how many people died...

726
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,460
but how many lived.

727
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,397
What you're saying, these pilots
purposefully crashed this planes...

728
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,966
in such ways, to minimize
casualties, I'm not buying.

729
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,001
Of course now, if these
were radical Jihads'...

730
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,804
they would have never been entrusted
with such a delicate mission..

731
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:46,175
What'd you mean entrusted? By who?

732
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:49,012
Did you ever hear of the Project
the New American Century?

733
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:52,615
- No.
- It's a new conservative Think-tank.

734
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,184
<i>In Retrospect
the Neo-con Think-tank.</i>

735
00:50:55,185 --> 00:51:00,656
Rumsfeld is a member...
Perle, Wolfowitz, Cheney.

736
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:06,962
In 2000, they published a plan,
for 100 years of American-agenda.

737
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:08,366
Of course,
they didn't have the money...

738
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:10,766
to pay for the necessary
military build up.

739
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:12,234
Absent as they planed to do...

740
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:15,934
some catastrophic
and catalyzing event...

741
00:51:15,935 --> 00:51:17,234
like a new Pearl Harbor.

742
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,642
And a year later
they got there money.

743
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:22,144
So these guys staged 9/11.

744
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:25,648
Did they plan it?
Did they take advantage of it?

745
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:26,982
Is there a difference?

746
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:28,918
The Pentagon got their budget.

747
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,188
Republicans, are in government.
Corporations make billions.

748
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:35,825
This is all a vast crazy
conspiracy.

749
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:39,962
Why do conspiracies,
always have to be vast?

750
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:42,965
You see, if two people plan
a crime, that's a conspiracy.

751
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,868
Successful conspiracies are small.

752
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,703
The smaller the better.

753
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:50,263
Three, maybe four people.

754
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,738
I need a drink.

755
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,324
- You want one?
- Sure.

756
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,520
Should you?

757
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,101
Does it make sense to you?
This theory?

758
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:20,136
Does it matter?

759
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,405
It does if you're using it to justify,
what we're about to do tomorrow.

760
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,174
I'm not trying to justify anything.

761
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,209
- Well, people are gonna die.
- It's important...

762
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,713
- that their sacrifice has meaning.
- Even if you have to make that meaning up?

763
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,449
People need stories to make
sense of their lives.

764
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,976
The truth is less important,
than the effect.

765
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,797
So you're gonna see project, guys
you wanted 9/11 to happen...

766
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,433
we were still attacked
by Al-Qaeda, right?

767
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:54,970
To the extent that Al-Qaeda
actually exists, that's correct.

768
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,007
So they hit us and we
hit'm back, keeps going.

769
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,243
That's not quiet that simple.

770
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:05,314
Why do you think the attacks
occurred, on that particular day?

771
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:09,118
- Why September 11?
- And don't think of the sky was clear...

772
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,554
because the High-jackers bought
their tickets weeks before that.

773
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:14,682
I don't know.

774
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:17,326
Okay, it turns out
that on September 11...

775
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:22,398
NORAD was conducted an exercise
called "Vigilant Guardian".

776
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:26,335
Which simulated air attacks,
against the United States.

777
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,674
Now, what they did, or have
the ability to do, was to plant...

778
00:53:29,675 --> 00:53:34,443
false transponder signals, into
the air traffic control system...

779
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:37,613
which appeared as planes
veering off course.

780
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,552
And in fact, there were
something like, huh...

781
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:42,952
29 false High-jackings
reported that day.

782
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,688
Supposedly, once the Air-force
got their birds off the ground...

783
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,824
- nobody knew where to send them.
- How did the High-jackers know?

784
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:51,627
The question isn't who knew.
The question is, who needed to know.

785
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,162
From Al-Qaeda’s point of view...

786
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,731
they only needed one person
to give the order.

787
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,132
Osama bin Laden.

788
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,501
And all he needed to know,
was the date.

789
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:02,698
Then who told Osama?

790
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,874
That could've been anyone.

791
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:09,478
And don't forget, that was
C.I.A.'s go to guy.

792
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:14,250
A Saudi royalty,
and someone else picked him.

793
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,286
You know what a U.A.V. is?
An unmanned aerial vehicle?

794
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:20,356
A plain you fly by remote control.

795
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:23,325
Exactly,
now there is a defense plant...

796
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,361
called
"System Planning Operation"...

797
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:29,765
they make remote controllers, for
U.A.V.'s, for missiles, for boats...

798
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,201
and even for commercial air liners.

799
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:34,103
Now, they're not the only
company to do this...

800
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:38,340
but their C.E.O. was comptroller,
at the Department of Defense.

801
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,642
He was also a member of the...

802
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,744
Project the New American Century.

803
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:45,481
And it gets better,
under his less then watchful eye...

804
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:49,218
<i>a trillion dollars,
was misplaced by the Pentagon.</i>

805
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,353
He resigned,
but the money was gone.

806
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:52,921
That's just an accusation.

807
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,190
We're not accusing him of anything.

808
00:54:55,191 --> 00:54:58,828
No! And we're not saying,
that 9/11 was a setup.

809
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:01,996
Or Pearl Harbor, or J.F.K.
The point is...

810
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:05,429
that if anybody wanted to do such
a thing, at a very high level...

811
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,329
it wouldn't be that hard.

812
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:11,140
You need to ignore the F.B.I.
reports on terrorist activity...

813
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,909
you need a way,
to contact Bin Laden...

814
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:18,180
you need a way to control
the planes and not the pilots...

815
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:21,150
and you need the money,
to finance the operation.

816
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,986
There's someone at the top,
someone who writes the checks...

817
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:27,423
a technician to install
the system to fly the planes.

818
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:31,093
It's all speculation,
I mean, you have no evidence.

819
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,295
- James, what's it gonna take?
- Proof.

820
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:37,527
There isn't any, there isn't gonna be,
this here will be beyond that.

821
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,570
There is three elements here,
motive, means and opportunity

822
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:41,970
What is their motive?

823
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:45,507
A hundred years of American empire.
Were there means?

824
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,276
A trillion dollars worth.

825
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,278
Was there opportunity?

826
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:53,148
The Air Defense Command, had
it's pants around it's ankles...

827
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,378
conducting a trill.

828
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,787
Maybe it's all bull-shit.

829
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:01,023
Maybe the government
planted this story...

830
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,649
to discredit the truth, hm'mm?

831
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:08,297
Maybe if... if you all look
closely enough, at any tragedy...

832
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:11,367
you find a whole string of events...

833
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:15,904
so random, that it's easier to
believe in some kind’ a master plan...

834
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,907
then to except the fact,
that the world is complicated...

835
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:23,379
and that's the way shit
works out sometimes.

836
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,871
Maybe that's the definition
of "tragedy".

837
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:31,850
And maybe you're looking
for a reason to back out.

838
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,952
You know what, Robert?

839
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:49,795
It's not yet over with.

840
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:54,143
- Maybe you should go to him.
- And what?

841
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:57,670
Well, you're a smart girl,
you'll think of something.

842
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,943
Go on.

843
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,008
HACE 9 MESES

844
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:58,574
Did they teach you
this in the army too?

845
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:01,043
Special Forces.

846
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:06,438
They gave you a medal.

847
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:12,014
Yeah, that's my special talent.
Dick-less wonder.

848
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:16,694
Auh...

849
00:58:17,361 --> 00:58:19,324
Ah, you're hurting me.

850
00:58:19,325 --> 00:58:21,524
- But you drew blood.
- Oh'oh...

851
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:25,526
Self pity is not
a charm for quality.

852
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:28,536
- Bitch.
- Gimp.

853
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:35,338
- I'll bite.
- I'll do worse.

854
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:40,272
I love you.

855
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:43,752
No you don't.

856
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,655
I want a child.

857
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:50,125
I wanna have a child.

858
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:55,820
- What?
- So have one.

859
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:59,134
I want one with you.

860
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:01,303
You know that's not possible.

861
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:04,773
Well, we can adopt.

862
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:14,249
No.

863
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:18,887
- You keep saying that.
- I keep meaning it.

864
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:22,424
What's so wrong with it?

865
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,497
Just because a man is
your biological father...

866
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:28,097
doesn't stop him from
crawling into your bed.

867
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,356
- That's disgusting.
- It's true.

868
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:37,406
So, you wanna be a revolutionary,
you wanna bring down the system...

869
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:41,276
how you gonna do that, with
a baby hanging from your hip?

870
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:44,575
I don't know,
maybe get a sitter.

871
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,651
Come on.

872
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,483
What is this about?

873
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,924
I just wanna leave something behind.

874
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:59,561
- An insurance policy.
- Against what?

875
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,461
I don't know, living?

876
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:04,855
When you're dead,
who cares what happens next.

877
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,040
What?

878
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:15,472
Maybe you're not this great
father material, after all.

879
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:22,144
That's the first sensibly
thing you've said all night.

880
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:25,020
Did Robert send you up here?

881
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,956
Make sure I'm still committed.

882
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,758
Are you?

883
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:33,161
After all we've been through,
you ask me a question like that?

884
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:37,189
What have we been through, James?

885
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,668
You're asking me to kill
innocent people.

886
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,169
Everyone's guilty of something.

887
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:45,140
What're you guilty off?

888
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,108
Jacking you meaningless.

889
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,443
I knew what I was getting into.

890
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:52,381
I was teasing you.

891
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,049
You don't think I knew that?

892
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,678
Robert might be smart,
but it doesn’t make me stupid.

893
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:01,081
You didn't think manageable.

894
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,555
- By you?
- You and me.

895
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,131
Sometimes I think
about taking a gun...

896
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:12,123
- and ending this.
- Yeah.

897
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:16,466
I know what you mean.

898
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:20,242
But then I think about the baby.

899
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:23,075
I was talking about Robert.

900
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,941
Let's get outta here.

901
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,389
- Raise our baby.
- In what kind of world?

902
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,984
- I'm not having this arguments.
- And I'm not leaving.

903
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:41,963
But you can, I can drive a truck,
the same as any man.

904
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,165
- No.
- Why not?

905
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,599
I wont let you.

906
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,436
All you've done, is look
for reasons not to do this.

907
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:47,836
You think I haven't noticed.

908
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,105
You think, Robert hasn't noticed?

909
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,974
- If you're so opposed, leave.
- I can't.

910
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,072
No one's holding
a gun to your head.

911
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,448
Oh... Hanna, you don't know
anything about me.

912
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,711
You're right.

913
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:16,588
So, what makes you think,
I can even pull this off?

914
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:26,100
Because... I picked you.

915
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,478
And deep down,
I know you're a good person.

916
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,680
If I drive that truck...

917
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,815
that makes me a good person.

918
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,985
It makes you a man of principle...

919
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:41,115
willing to sacrifice the lives
of others for the future.

920
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,558
You want me to do this
for the children?

921
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:48,860
You do it for yourself,
because you know it's right.

922
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:55,293
It's "Terrible", "Awful"...
but absolutely 100% necessary.

923
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:12,985
- What about Marcus?
- What about him?

924
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,259
You two are pretty close.

925
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,250
He's like a brother to me.

926
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:25,332
A brother you fucked.

927
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,465
He can't, you know that.

928
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,235
There's lots a ways to fuck.

929
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,474
Is that what this it about?

930
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,253
There was something once,
but that's all over now.

931
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,189
Because you can't love
a man without a dick?

932
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:52,127
Because he can't love himself,
not alone another person.

933
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,912
Do you still
have feelings for him?

934
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:15,179
I don't love him,
if that's what you wanna know.

935
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:20,183
- Did you?
- Once, maybe?

936
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:23,859
But none of that matters now.

937
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:30,094
Because my Knight walked into
a bar and rescued me.

938
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:34,391
- My Damsel.
- I never said "Damsel".

939
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,306
I said was in distress.

940
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:49,311
So then, what'd you gonna do?

941
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:03,398
Now once you're in call Hanna,
to confirm the signal.

942
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,091
Then head for the back exit...

943
01:05:05,092 --> 01:05:07,391
we'll pick you up
at Debby's by the mall.

944
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:12,540
Now, if you can't get a signal,
you have to arm it manually.

945
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,509
You got 3 minutes,
to clear the Zone.

946
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:21,212
- Anything else?
- Good luck.

947
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,777
- I'll see you on the other side.
- Yes you will.

948
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,552
Alright, let's do this.

949
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,431
I'll wait for your call.

950
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:16,800
Are you alright?

951
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:22,471
Yeah... I will be soon.

952
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,817
- What's up with that?
- What?

953
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,745
- What is he doing?
- Is he turning?

954
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,942
- I can't get a ring.
- There must be a disconn...

955
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:09,878
- No, can't be, let's keep going.
- Are you serious?

956
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:12,380
- It's goin' to shit, I can feel it.
- Hanna! Don't freak out on me.

957
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:15,083
Please, let's just get outta here,
just the two of us.

958
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,118
We just can't leave the driver
and the (?) on it's own.

959
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:19,888
Listen, there's probably
something wrong with the truck.

960
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,250
It's the only way
he cold do.

961
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,558
Let's check it.

962
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,164
Hello?

963
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:09,269
What's going on, Robert?

964
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:12,106
- Did I come at a bad time?
- What you're doing here?

965
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:13,574
You invited me.

966
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:20,344
- You're crazy.
- Keep your hands where I can see them.

967
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:24,747
You're paranoid, you know that.
Delusional.

968
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,289
Your phone.

969
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,816
- You're clean.
- What did you expect?

970
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,296
I worry about you, Robert.

971
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:39,801
You quit your job, you live
like a recluse, and now this?

972
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:43,371
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
What you're doing here?

973
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:48,343
I came to make you an offer.
Come back to us.

974
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:51,813
- To what?
- What ever you want.

975
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:54,849
- Five million dollars?
- Lots of money?

976
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,484
For an island, so what?

977
01:10:56,485 --> 01:11:00,887
- Atlantic or Pacific?
- Second half.

978
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,213
I know.

979
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,562
There's something you should
know about your driver.

980
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:10,331
- What driver?
- Of your truck.

981
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:13,767
- What truck?
- About James.

982
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,495
He's one of my boys,
he's one of us.

983
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:22,644
I can proof it.

984
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,112
Call him.

985
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:09,824
<i>- James, here.
- They have a driver?</i>

986
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:13,394
<i>- Yeah.
- Then it's over.</i>

987
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:14,796
I can salvage this.

988
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:18,027
<i>I've made my decision.
Be ready.</i>

989
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:43,157
What were you doing in there?

990
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:46,461
- I was splashing water on my face.
- Really?

991
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:51,599
I though I... huh, heard you
talking to someone, no?

992
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,298
No, there's nobody in here,
to talk to.

993
01:12:56,438 --> 01:13:00,237
I thought, I... huh,
I heard something.

994
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:14,655
Yeah, you cut me, I talk to
myself in the mirror sometime.

995
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:18,226
- Really?
- Yeah.

996
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:21,029
Then what'd... huh,
you talk about?

997
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:25,333
Ah... you know, the usual,
bombs and girls.

998
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:28,035
So, there's something new
every day then.

999
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,972
- It's when my boy-friend is crazy.
- And you're not?

1000
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:35,307
I... I mean, I suspected.

1001
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:42,310
I didn't mean to be
discussing this, but, huh...

1002
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:46,254
- The man in the mirror.
- Yeah.

1003
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:48,620
Definitely.

1004
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:56,597
You know it should tell you?

1005
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,602
I can't take nothing
for granted...

1006
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:03,837
because you never know
what's around the corner.

1007
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:09,073
Robert send me up here, 'cause
he's got the maps ready.

1008
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,813
Make sure you remember
the last thing I said.

1009
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:17,185
Yes, that life is short, and not
to take anything for granted.

1010
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:20,484
It's time for us to go downstairs
and you'll get the route.

1011
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:30,195
James here.

1012
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:31,866
<i>James? Hello?</i>

1013
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:34,267
Hello?

1014
01:14:35,507 --> 01:14:37,974
James?

1015
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:39,974
James?

1016
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,443
Alright.

1017
01:14:50,276 --> 01:14:52,043
Where the fuck is he?

1018
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:09,003
No, no, no! Marcus, don't leave me!
Please, don't.

1019
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:12,240
Calm down, look... look at me.

1020
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,708
Relax.

1021
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,962
Subject one is down.

1022
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,373
- Anna freeze! Get on the ground!
- Marcus!

1023
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,742
Freeze, damn it! No! No!

1024
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,211
No! No! Stand down!

1025
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:56,446
- Don't be stupid, Hanna!
- Fuck you!

1026
01:15:57,352 --> 01:16:00,054
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Nobody here's gonna hurt you.

1027
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,723
Come on! Hey, it's over.

1028
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,691
I trusted you.

1029
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,227
We have a shot.

1030
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,229
- You can't let it end this way.
- No!

1031
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,290
- How is it gonna end?
- With you alive.

1032
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,730
- With our baby alive.
- Our baby?

1033
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:23,578
- I let you fuck me.
- I was doing my job.

1034
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:24,946
Did you like it?

1035
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:29,247
- Did you like fucking me over?
- You were doing your job too.

1036
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:33,287
They're gonna kill him?

1037
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,256
You think, I'm gonna let you
go through with this?

1038
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,622
They were going to kill you.

1039
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,463
As soon as you called today.
I can still kill you.

1040
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,368
Is this what you want?

1041
01:16:49,404 --> 01:16:52,304
We meant something to each other,
I know we did.

1042
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:57,268
Hey! Hey!... Hey! Hey! Hey!

1043
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,243
You gonna tell me
it was all lies?

1044
01:17:00,184 --> 01:17:02,151
Hanna...

1045
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:03,951
I love you.

1046
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:08,389
Go! Fuck! Fuck!

1047
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:38,587
Hey, what happens to her?

1048
01:17:38,588 --> 01:17:42,587
She takes a long voyage,
does it matter?

1049
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:07,646
That's sick.

1050
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:10,484
Yeah, that's natural.

1051
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:15,684
That's what separates us, from when
we know when we do things wrong.

1052
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:18,921
But we do it with anyone.

1053
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:25,566
Precisely, you saved life’s.
