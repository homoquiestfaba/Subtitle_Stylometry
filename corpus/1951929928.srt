1
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:32,619
- Mr. Vale.
- Yes.

2
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:33,988
I'm Barbara Watson.

3
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:34,991
Yes. Come in.

4
00:01:35,059 --> 00:01:36,049
Thank you.

5
00:01:38,062 --> 00:01:39,052
Hmm.

6
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:42,761
Ah. May I take your coat?

7
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:43,995
No, thank you.

8
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:45,001
Uh...

9
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,799
would you like something to drink?

10
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,860
No.

11
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:50,999
Shall we get started?

12
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:52,065
Uh, okay.

13
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,686
Let's try it again.

14
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:08,019
The same thing?

15
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:09,685
Yes.

16
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,352
And remember...

17
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:13,729
fingers curved like a tunnel.

18
00:02:13,797 --> 00:02:14,787
Okay.

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,601
Don't flatten.

20
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:28,409
Make room for the train.

21
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,469
What?

22
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:33,039
It's something I tell my kids.

23
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:37,055
If the fingers are curved, like this,

24
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:41,116
then there's room for the train
to pass through the tunnel.

25
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:47,387
Thank you.

26
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:49,057
Uh, next Tuesday, then, same time?

27
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:53,071
No. Uh, I don't think
I'm going to continue with our lessons.

28
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:54,364
Oh, no.

29
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:56,561
You're giving up?

30
00:02:57,573 --> 00:02:58,700
No.

31
00:03:00,142 --> 00:03:01,735
Oh.

32
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:03,403
Okay.

33
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,504
Well...

34
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,513
good-bye.

35
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:06,810
Good-bye.

36
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,084
Uh, Mr. Vale.

37
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,084
May I ask?

38
00:03:11,152 --> 00:03:13,885
How many teachers
have you had before me?

39
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,424
Four.

40
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:17,721
Well, for what it's worth,

41
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:21,094
learning an instrument
at your age is difficult,

42
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:25,968
especially if you don't possess
a natural gift for it.

43
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:28,470
I'm not saying this to be mean.

44
00:03:28,536 --> 00:03:35,176
But if you do decide to give up,
I'd really like to buy your piano.

45
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:38,168
Okay.

46
00:03:50,857 --> 00:03:53,454
Each stage of experience
is really the exception to the rule

47
00:03:53,528 --> 00:03:54,928
because the conditions there

48
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:59,129
that made trade mobilization
to the Middle East successful

49
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,194
weren't present
in the developing countries.

50
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:09,165
Yes?

51
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:12,570
Hi.

52
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:13,944
Come in.

53
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,487
Paper. Uh, sorry it's late.

54
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:29,718
Why is it late?

55
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:33,233
I had some personal
issues to deal with.

56
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,665
I'm sorry, but I can't accept it now.

57
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,169
I mean, I... I really had a...

58
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,231
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,861
Uh, you know you still haven't given us
the syllabus yet?

60
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,257
I know.

61
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,291
Yeah?

62
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,657
Hello, Walter.

63
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:42,666
Hi, Charles.

64
00:05:42,734 --> 00:05:43,827
You got a sec?

65
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:44,926
Sure.

66
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:47,231
Walter, Shelley can't make it down

67
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,240
to the NYU conference
to present your paper.

68
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,071
I'm gonna need you to cover for her.

69
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,938
Why can't she go?

70
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,039
She's been put on bed rest
till she has the baby.

71
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:59,244
I wish I could, but now is not
a good time, Charles.

72
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,912
Well, I understand,
but you co-authored the paper,

73
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:03,044
and the Dean wants it presented.

74
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,418
He wants to keep
Shelley on track for tenure.

75
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:07,854
I just don't think I can,
with the start of classes and my book.

76
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:11,328
You're only teaching one class, Walter.

77
00:06:11,395 --> 00:06:13,422
So I can stay focused on my book.

78
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:18,129
Charles, I would really rather not go.

79
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:21,766
Well, I'm sorry, but there really
isn't another option at this point.

80
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,370
Charles, the truth is...

81
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:30,311
this is really Shelley's paper.

82
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:33,442
I just agreed to co-author it
because she asked me to.

83
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:37,452
I'm not really prepared to present it.

84
00:06:38,454 --> 00:06:39,752
Now, look, Walter,
you can take it up

85
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:40,983
with the Dean if you want,

86
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:45,464
but as your friend, I wouldn't advise it,
not with that argument.

87
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,079
Hello?

88
00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:00,078
Aah! Aah! Aah! Get out!

89
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,518
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get out!

90
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,575
You stay away from me!

91
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:05,486
You leave me alone!

92
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:07,422
No. I... It's... It's okay. I... I'm...

93
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,925
It's not okay! My boyfriend is coming!

94
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,929
I'm... I'm... I'm not going to hurt you.

95
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,022
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

96
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,496
This is my apartment.

97
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:16,056
This apartment does
not belong to you!

98
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,930
- How did you get in here?
- My name is Walter Vale.

99
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,994
- I have keys! This is my apartment!
- What the fuck!

100
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,302
Ow! Ow! God! Aah! Please!

101
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,601
- Zainab!
- I'm in here!

102
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:25,107
- Shut up!
- Aah!

103
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:26,905
- Shut up!
- All ri... Okay. Okay.

104
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,035
Okay. Okay.

105
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,135
Who are you?

106
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,406
<i>Qu'est-ce que c'est ça?</i>

107
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,607
<i>Ça va?</i>

108
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,614
<i>Oui, ça va.</i>

109
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:33,615
<i>C'est qui?</i>

110
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:34,946
<i>J'étais dans mon bain.</i>

111
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:36,077
<i>Lui, il était là.</i>

112
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:38,179
- Did you touch her?
- What?

113
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,448
- Motherfucker, did you touch her?
- No! No! No!

114
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:40,990
<i>II ne m'a pas touchée.</i>

115
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,254
<i>Mais comme il est entré,</i>
<i>il a dit qu'il avait la clé.</i>

116
00:10:43,325 --> 00:10:44,954
Do you have keys?

117
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,621
Yes, of course I have keys.
This is my apartment.

118
00:10:47,696 --> 00:10:48,960
- Show me your keys.
- All right.

119
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:50,227
Here.

120
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:51,631
I've had this apartment for 25 years.

121
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,135
So why haven't you been here?

122
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:56,037
Because I live in Connecticut.
I haven't been down here in a very long time.

123
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,166
Are you friends with Ivan?

124
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,038
Ivan. I don't... Who's Ivan?

125
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,703
I'm sure he's called the police!

126
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:06,478
- Did you call the police?
- No.

127
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:08,380
- You did not call the police?
- No.

128
00:11:12,553 --> 00:11:13,647
And you don't know Ivan?

129
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:15,156
No. Who is he?

130
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:16,657
- He rented us this place.
- I don't know him.

131
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,355
He said it belongs
to his friend who is out of town.

132
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:20,417
I don't know who he is.

133
00:11:20,495 --> 00:11:22,226
This is my apartment. I assure you.

134
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,467
Shit!

135
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:28,731
<i>Je t'ai déjà dit</i>
<i>de faire confiance à personne.</i>

136
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:30,529
<i>T'as jamais signé</i>
<i>un contrat.</i>

137
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:35,675
Shit.

138
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:37,734
Hey, look.

139
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:42,509
We don't want any trouble.

140
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,245
We will get out of your apartment.

141
00:11:46,587 --> 00:11:48,488
Here. Take your keys.

142
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:51,183
It's all a mistake. I'm sorry.

143
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:52,191
Okay.

144
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,193
We will leave. Okay?

145
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:55,752
Yeah, okay.

146
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,413
How long have you lived here?

147
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:17,178
Two months.

148
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:18,775
We will pay you if you want.

149
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,651
Yes, so, uh, we will go.

150
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,387
I'm sorry, again.

151
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,793
Thank you for understanding.

152
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:38,359
Go get the valise.

153
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:41,062
Okay, okay.

154
00:12:44,643 --> 00:12:45,611
Good-bye.

155
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:46,805
Good-bye.

156
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,793
Tarek.

157
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:46,360
- Tarek.
- What?

158
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:53,368
Uh... you left this in the apartment.

159
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:55,368
Thanks.

160
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,143
So you know where
you're staying tonight?

161
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,551
Yeah, sure. We're goin' to some friends'.

162
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,848
You like classical music, huh?

163
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,816
Yes.

164
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:35,352
Me, too.

165
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:36,545
Do you play the piano?

166
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:38,384
No.

167
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:39,387
Do you?

168
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:42,187
Me? No. I play the djembe.

169
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:43,921
Hmm.

170
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:46,254
Okay. Good night.

171
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,367
And thanks again for letting us stay.

172
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,495
Um... you saved me a lot of trouble,
if you know what I mean.

173
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:57,201
We'll be out of your way
in a couple of days. Okay?

174
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,707
Good night.

175
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,892
Good morning.

176
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:23,954
Good morning.

177
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,903
I made some coffee.

178
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:28,959
Thank you.

179
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:34,746
And... have a good day.

180
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:35,798
Good-bye.

181
00:15:48,655 --> 00:15:49,884
Walter Vale.

182
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:54,917
Thank you.

183
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,828
And that will be on the last day
of the conference.

184
00:15:56,897 --> 00:15:58,594
I hope you can all attend.

185
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,934
And now I'd like to welcome
my distinguished colleague

186
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,234
and the winner
of the John Bates Clark Award...

187
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:06,001
Professor Stephen Kriegman.

188
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:16,805
Thank you, Shiva.

189
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:38,635
Thank you.

190
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:39,637
Excuse me.

191
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:40,638
Yes?

192
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:41,638
Mr. Vale?

193
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:42,800
Yes.

194
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,812
Oh, my goodness. How are you?

195
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:47,312
It's me.

196
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,646
Jacob Koningsberg.
Do you remember me?

197
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:51,877
- I'm sorry.
I... I used to live on the third floor

198
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,387
- with my mother.
Your wife used to give me piano lessons.

199
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:56,981
Oh, right, right.

200
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:58,991
How are you?

201
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:00,993
Oh, my goodness.
I haven't seen you in so long.

202
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,995
We thought that you
sold the place.

203
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:03,994
You haven't met Sprinkles.

204
00:17:04,062 --> 00:17:05,827
This is Sprinkles. Say hello.

205
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:07,058
Hello. How is your wife?

206
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,994
Oh, my wife passed away.

207
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,902
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:17,708
I'm very sorry.
My... My condolences to you.

209
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:19,404
She was a lovely woman.

210
00:17:19,478 --> 00:17:22,882
Honestly, I could
listen to her play piano for hours.

211
00:17:22,948 --> 00:17:24,041
How is your mother?

212
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,485
My mother is fine.
Thank you very much.

213
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,544
Thank you for asking. She's in Florida.

214
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,022
So I'm living alone now, and it's nice,

215
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:35,027
but I tell you, there are so many
new people in this building,

216
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,825
- and Mr. Sprinkles and I...
- It's nice to see you again, Jacob.

217
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:39,854
It's good to see you.

218
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,091
Good to see you. Welcome home.

219
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:42,629
Thank you.

220
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,929
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

221
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:56,478
Stop it.

222
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:57,707
Come on, honey.

223
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:08,752
We find that,
under these circumstances,

224
00:18:08,825 --> 00:18:11,558
financial globalization
can be beneficial.

225
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:14,691
Empirically, it's good institution
and quality of government

226
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:16,893
that will allow third world countries

227
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:19,129
to benefit and harvest
the fruits of globalization.

228
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:09,110
Great stuff, huh?

229
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:11,177
Maybe we should have 'em
come play inside.

230
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:14,088
Uh, you coming?

231
00:19:14,156 --> 00:19:16,456
In a minute. Uh, I gotta make a call.

232
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,119
- Oh. Uh, see you inside.
- Okay.

233
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:43,947
- ##
- Hey, Walter.

234
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,145
Welcome home.

235
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,209
Hi.

236
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:51,453
How was the conference?

237
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,050
It was fine.

238
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:56,163
Sorry about the pants. I...

239
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,222
I've been practicing
like this since I was a kid.

240
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,175
You... You don't have
to stop practicing.

241
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,541
Really? it won't bother you?

242
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:12,945
- No. It's fine.
- Great.

243
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:23,250
Hey, uh, Zainab's going to make dinner,

244
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,254
if you want to eat with us later.

245
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,088
Okay. Thank you.

246
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,208
I'm sorry.
That was my mother in Michigan.

247
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:49,217
If I don't call her every day,
she thinks something happened to me.

248
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,944
Yeah, I'll have a bit. Thanks.

249
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:53,146
You sure you won't have some?

250
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,277
I don't drink.

251
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,753
She's a good Muslim. I'm a bad one.

252
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,221
Are you finished?

253
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,228
Yes. Uh... can I help you?

254
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,232
No. Please.
It's the least I can do.

255
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,631
Well, thank you for dinner.
It was very good.

256
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,294
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

257
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:13,071
So what's the conference about?

258
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:15,232
Economic growth
in developing nations.

259
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:18,039
That's us. Syria, Senegal.

260
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:21,237
So have you written some books?

261
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:23,248
Three, and I'm working on a fourth.

262
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:24,908
- Four books.
- Mm-hmm.

263
00:21:24,982 --> 00:21:27,214
Wow. That's great.

264
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:31,252
My father was a writer. A journalist.

265
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:32,882
Is he still writing?

266
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:37,022
No. He died before we left Syria,
almost nine years ago.

267
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,085
Sorry.

268
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,588
Me, too.

269
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,031
- Tarek.
- Mmm.

270
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:45,930
Mmm. We have to go.

271
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,231
I have a gig.

272
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:51,267
Walter, you can come if you want.

273
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:54,040
Oh, no. I've got some work
I have to get done. Thank you.

274
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:55,978
Okay. Well, maybe another time.

275
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:57,036
Okay.

276
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:01,346
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

277
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:18,799
You know, you are very sexy
when you're mad at me.

278
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:24,863
Hello?

279
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,038
If you don't mind, I think I will come.

280
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:31,807
Cool.

281
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:33,213
Let me get my coat.

282
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:04,401
Hohh!

283
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:17,252
He's very good.

284
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:19,249
Yes.

285
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:22,424
- The whole band's very good.
- Yes.

286
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:32,900
I'm sorry, guys.

287
00:23:32,973 --> 00:23:33,906
Yeah, well, let's go.

288
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:35,375
Very good.

289
00:23:35,443 --> 00:23:36,376
Really? You liked it?

290
00:23:36,444 --> 00:23:37,377
Yeah. It was very good.

291
00:23:37,445 --> 00:23:38,708
I was not sure.

292
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,943
I thought it's too loud and you know.

293
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:24,483
Tarek?

294
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:40,438
Oh.

295
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:42,271
Hi.

296
00:24:42,341 --> 00:24:44,277
Sounded good, Walter.

297
00:24:44,343 --> 00:24:45,436
I'm sorry. I...

298
00:24:45,511 --> 00:24:47,104
No. Don't be sorry.

299
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:48,512
That's what it's there for.

300
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:51,249
I was lying

301
00:24:51,316 --> 00:24:52,375
on my bed, listening to my music,

302
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,113
and then I was, like...

303
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:55,780
what's that crazy rhythm I'm hearing?

304
00:24:58,523 --> 00:25:01,518
Sit. Come on. I'll show you.

305
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:13,362
Just put your feet flat on the ground.

306
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,840
Now take the drum
between your legs like this.

307
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:24,176
Now you want to take
the inside edge off the ground

308
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:25,842
with your ankles, like this.

309
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:28,819
Great.

310
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:30,481
You're okay?

311
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:32,251
Okay.

312
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,382
Okay.

313
00:25:33,457 --> 00:25:35,120
Now, Walter, I know
you're a very smart man,

314
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:38,494
but with a drum
you have to remember not to think.

315
00:25:38,562 --> 00:25:40,498
Thinking just screws it up. Okay?

316
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:41,863
Okay.

317
00:25:41,932 --> 00:25:43,491
Now, give it a couple of bangs.

318
00:25:47,904 --> 00:25:49,430
Not so hard. You're not angry at it.

319
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,101
Okay. I'm sorry.

320
00:25:52,576 --> 00:25:53,566
Okay.

321
00:25:57,581 --> 00:25:59,517
Better. Did you think?

322
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,516
No.

323
00:26:00,584 --> 00:26:02,280
Good.

324
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,015
Now, one more thing, Walter.

325
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:06,524
You listen to classical music,
so you think in fours.

326
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,525
1, 2, 3, 4.

327
00:26:08,592 --> 00:26:10,858
Dah, dah, dah, dah.

328
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:12,021
This is an African drum,

329
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:13,495
so we're gonna be playing in threes.

330
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:14,531
Tak tak tak.

331
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:16,089
You have to forget your classical.

332
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:18,192
Leave it behind. Tak tak tak.

333
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:19,530
1, 2, 3.

334
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:20,592
Come on, follow me.

335
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:22,867
Tak tak tak.

336
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,999
Tak tak tak.

337
00:26:24,073 --> 00:26:25,439
1, 2, 3.

338
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:30,538
Don't worry. Start again.

339
00:26:30,613 --> 00:26:31,546
Good.

340
00:26:31,614 --> 00:26:32,604
Don't worry.

341
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,040
Again.

342
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:41,613
Good.

343
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,156
You got it.

344
00:26:46,228 --> 00:26:47,560
Go...

345
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,121
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

346
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:51,191
Don't worry. Go again.

347
00:26:57,941 --> 00:26:58,930
Good.

348
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:02,945
That's it.

349
00:27:03,011 --> 00:27:05,209
Now, keep it going, and I'll do this.

350
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:14,354
There you go.

351
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:16,051
1...

352
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:17,114
1...

353
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,090
Hohh!

354
00:28:03,703 --> 00:28:04,636
Hello.

355
00:28:04,704 --> 00:28:06,469
Hi.

356
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:08,640
Is Tarek home?

357
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:12,648
Uh, no. He, uh...
he went to look at another apartment.

358
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:15,141
Are you okay?

359
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:16,649
Yes.

360
00:28:16,716 --> 00:28:19,449
Tarek's been giving me drum lessons,
and I was just practicing.

361
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:27,123
Don't worry. I'll keep my pants on.

362
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:29,551
What?

363
00:28:30,563 --> 00:28:31,963
Nothing.

364
00:28:32,031 --> 00:28:33,397
It's just that earlier, uh...

365
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,726
No, nothing.

366
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:28,719
Which is due, in large part,

367
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:31,724
to the delay in African infrastructure

368
00:29:31,789 --> 00:29:35,193
and the slowdown on steel imports.

369
00:29:49,306 --> 00:29:50,535
Hey, Walter!

370
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:05,482
How did the presentation go?

371
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:06,488
Oh, fine. Thanks.

372
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:07,785
Cool.

373
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:09,725
- You ready?
- Yeah.

374
00:30:09,793 --> 00:30:10,726
Let's go.

375
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:12,593
- Can you grab this drum?
- Yeah.

376
00:30:12,662 --> 00:30:13,595
Okay.

377
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:16,293
You might want to take off
your, uh, name tag.

378
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:17,355
Oh, okay.

379
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:22,270
You hungry?

380
00:30:22,338 --> 00:30:23,773
Yeah, I'm starving.

381
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,773
You like shawarmas?

382
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:26,571
Yeah, I like sharmas.

383
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:29,335
Shawarmas.

384
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:36,616
Here. This is for you.

385
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:37,744
For letting us stay.

386
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,119
Oh. Thank you.

387
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,717
It's Fela Kuti. You know him?

388
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,124
Nope.

389
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:46,595
- You don't know Fela?
- No.

390
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:50,132
Then, Walter, you're in for a treat.

391
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:51,793
He started the whole Afrobeat movement.

392
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:54,737
Oh, and his drummer, Tony Allen,
was just... whoo, scary, man.

393
00:30:54,803 --> 00:30:57,273
You want to play drums,
you have to listen to this.

394
00:30:57,339 --> 00:30:58,603
Okay. I will.

395
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,136
Ooh.

396
00:31:03,212 --> 00:31:04,475
Did you make these?

397
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:05,810
Yes, I made these.

398
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,144
Ooh.

399
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:08,809
- How much?
- Which one?

400
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:11,320
Mmm...

401
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:12,411
this one.

402
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:15,152
That's $35.

403
00:31:15,224 --> 00:31:16,317
Will you take 30?

404
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:17,416
No. 35.

405
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:18,790
Okay.

406
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,354
My daughter will think this is very cool.

407
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:24,161
Where are you from?

408
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:25,200
Senegal.

409
00:31:25,266 --> 00:31:27,829
Oh, I was in Cape Town
two summers ago.

410
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:29,667
It is so beautiful.

411
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:32,571
- Thank you very much.
- What's your name?

412
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:34,834
Uh, Zainab.

413
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:36,343
Zainab!

414
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,400
So pretty.

415
00:31:38,412 --> 00:31:39,904
- Thank you.
- Your change.

416
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,188
How far is Senegal from Cape Town?

417
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:51,887
About 8,000 kilometers.

418
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:55,596
I told this guy yesterday
I was from Israel.

419
00:31:55,662 --> 00:31:58,259
He asked if I ever visited the Holy Land.

420
00:32:00,434 --> 00:32:02,802
Hey, look who it is!

421
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:03,802
- Zev.
- What's up, Tarek?

422
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,803
How are you, man?

423
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:05,804
Good, man.

424
00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:06,806
Hey, honey.

425
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:08,501
Hi. Hi, Walter.

426
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:09,507
Hi.

427
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:10,635
Her stuff is great, right?

428
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:11,872
Beautiful.

429
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:13,744
She made me this.

430
00:32:13,814 --> 00:32:14,873
It's very nice.

431
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:17,781
So Walter and I
are goin' up to the park

432
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:19,878
to play for a little bit, okay?

433
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:21,717
Tarek. Remember I told you

434
00:32:21,787 --> 00:32:23,518
we have to pick up
my new table today?

435
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:25,616
He said he'll only hold it for today.

436
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:26,886
Oh, I know, I know. No problem.

437
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:30,592
Tarek, you always say "No problem,"
and then you are late or you forget.

438
00:32:30,663 --> 00:32:31,892
I know. I... I will not be long.

439
00:32:31,964 --> 00:32:34,401
We will go up and play,
and we'll come back to help you.

440
00:32:35,968 --> 00:32:37,961
It's a promise, <i>habibti.</i>

441
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:42,971
It's always <i>habibti</i>
when you want to win, huh?

442
00:32:43,242 --> 00:32:44,232
Good-bye.

443
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:47,411
Bye.

444
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:49,415
He closes at 5 p.m., Tarek.

445
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:50,540
No Arab time.

446
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:52,278
No, not Arab time.

447
00:32:52,351 --> 00:32:53,945
Real time, <i>habibti.</i>

448
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:57,452
Don't <i>habibti</i> me, man.

449
00:32:57,522 --> 00:32:58,649
What does <i>habibti</i> mean?

450
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:00,955
<i>Habibti?</i> It means "beloved one."

451
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:03,924
Does she know that?

452
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:15,941
I always wanted to play down here.

453
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:17,840
It's supposed to be good money.

454
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:19,833
Why haven't you?

455
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:25,446
Maybe we could do it together...

456
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:26,781
split the profits.

457
00:33:37,861 --> 00:33:38,829
What do you think?

458
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:40,798
I think I'll just watch.

459
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,957
Come on, Walter, it's easy.

460
00:33:42,032 --> 00:33:43,626
You just wait until you feel it.

461
00:33:45,536 --> 00:33:46,469
Yeah, let's go.

462
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:47,597
Oh...

463
00:35:48,822 --> 00:35:49,881
That was fun, right?

464
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:51,084
Oh, yeah.

465
00:35:51,158 --> 00:35:52,091
How are your hands?

466
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,092
They're...

467
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:57,760
Oh, shit. We have to get home.

468
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,923
Zainab's gonna kill me.

469
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:00,433
I'm on Arab time again.

470
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:01,764
What is Arab time?

471
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:03,930
It means I'm late by an hour.

472
00:36:04,003 --> 00:36:05,096
All Arabs are late by an hour.

473
00:36:05,172 --> 00:36:07,107
It's genetic. We can't help it.

474
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:18,612
I think that's our train.

475
00:36:18,686 --> 00:36:19,619
I'm gonna need a token.

476
00:36:19,686 --> 00:36:20,711
No, I got you. I got you.

477
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:22,187
Here's our train. Come.

478
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:29,119
Here, I got you. Let...

479
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:36,731
I'm stuck, man.

480
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:38,031
Here, take it.

481
00:36:45,645 --> 00:36:46,635
This way, please.

482
00:36:46,712 --> 00:36:47,737
What are you doing?

483
00:36:47,813 --> 00:36:48,746
NYPD.

484
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:49,907
Step this way, please.

485
00:36:49,982 --> 00:36:51,645
Police? What do you want?

486
00:36:51,717 --> 00:36:52,844
You jumped the turnstile, man.

487
00:36:52,918 --> 00:36:54,683
I did not jump it. I paid.

488
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:56,449
Sir, he... he paid... Please.

489
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:57,649
But he paid...

490
00:36:57,723 --> 00:36:59,055
Sir, stand over there!

491
00:37:03,228 --> 00:37:05,198
Got anything else, Tarek?

492
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:06,693
No. Where you from?

493
00:37:06,764 --> 00:37:08,962
I'm from Syria. Why?

494
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:10,900
What's in the bag?

495
00:37:10,969 --> 00:37:11,994
It's my drum.

496
00:37:18,075 --> 00:37:20,546
Put this back in your pocket, please, sir.

497
00:37:20,612 --> 00:37:21,739
Step over here.

498
00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:23,178
- Why? I'm sorry...
- Step over here, please.

499
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:24,807
What did I do?

500
00:37:24,882 --> 00:37:26,681
Oh, come on. Come on.

501
00:37:30,254 --> 00:37:32,156
- I don't think that's necessary.
- Yeah, well, we do.

502
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:33,213
You can come down to the station

503
00:37:33,491 --> 00:37:34,653
- and make a statement if you want.
- But he didn't...

504
00:37:34,726 --> 00:37:36,194
Sir! That's all I'm saying!

505
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,198
Now, step back,
or we're gonna take you in, too.

506
00:37:39,263 --> 00:37:41,165
Where are you taking him?

507
00:37:41,232 --> 00:37:42,200
10th Precinct.

508
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:44,202
Walter, take the drum.

509
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:46,261
Tell Zainab what happened,
but don't let her come.

510
00:37:46,537 --> 00:37:47,937
I will call you.

511
00:37:50,274 --> 00:37:51,708
Don't let her come.

512
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,233
Where's Tarek?

513
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:21,293
He was arrested.

514
00:38:22,973 --> 00:38:24,100
What?

515
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:25,733
Yes.

516
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:26,901
In the subway.

517
00:38:26,975 --> 00:38:28,740
Arrested?

518
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:30,906
It was just a misunderstanding.

519
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,973
They said he'd be
released later tonight.

520
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:38,317
How could this happen?

521
00:38:39,556 --> 00:38:41,788
He knows better.
He wouldn't do anything wrong.

522
00:38:41,857 --> 00:38:43,257
No, he didn't.

523
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:44,760
He didn't.

524
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:46,227
I'm sure it'll be okay.

525
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:49,863
No, it won't be okay.

526
00:38:49,932 --> 00:38:52,870
No, I went down to the precinct
and made a statement.

527
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:53,925
That doesn't matter.

528
00:38:55,337 --> 00:38:57,273
We are illegal.

529
00:38:57,339 --> 00:38:59,104
We are not citizens.

530
00:38:59,174 --> 00:39:00,699
And when they find out, they're going to...

531
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:02,933
Excuse me.

532
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:27,300
Well?

533
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:28,301
They moved him.

534
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:29,302
To where?

535
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,135
To a detention center in Queens.

536
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:33,641
He was turned over to Immigration.

537
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:36,145
They said we can see him
tomorrow night.

538
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,180
Visiting hours are 5 to 10.

539
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:40,648
I cannot visit that place.

540
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:42,184
I'll end up there, too.

541
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,133
Zainab?

542
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:12,344
Yes.

543
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:15,008
I brought some Chinese food home,
if you'd like to eat.

544
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:16,948
Oh, no, thank you. I'm not hungry.

545
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:21,253
Okay. Well, if you change your mind,
I'll leave some in the fridge.

546
00:40:21,321 --> 00:40:22,311
Thank you.

547
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:25,152
Have you heard from Tarek?

548
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:28,151
No. Not yet.

549
00:40:28,227 --> 00:40:30,892
Oh. Well...

550
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:32,865
I made an appointment
with an immigration attorney

551
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,366
for tomorrow morning at 11.

552
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:35,732
No. We can't afford that.

553
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:36,996
That's okay.

554
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:42,405
Thank you, Walter.

555
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:46,434
Walter.

556
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,714
I was in detention...

557
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:55,417
when I first arrived, for five months.

558
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,215
How did you get out?

559
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:04,029
They... closed the facility
and released some of the women.

560
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:06,088
They didn't release any of the men.

561
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,362
We'll get him out.

562
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,403
Good night.

563
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,735
Good night.

564
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,190
Okay.

565
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:20,525
Yeah.

566
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:24,029
Okay.

567
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,010
Sir, that detainee has been moved.

568
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:28,978
He was here yesterday.

569
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:30,479
Well, he's not here now.
That's all I know.

570
00:42:30,546 --> 00:42:33,177
You can call I.C.
The number's on the wall.

571
00:42:33,249 --> 00:42:34,182
Where?

572
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,982
On the wall by the phone
and the water fountain.

573
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:38,042
Next.

574
00:42:39,388 --> 00:42:41,050
Sir, step aside, please.

575
00:42:46,395 --> 00:42:49,332
Hi. I'm here to see Tarek Khalil.

576
00:42:49,398 --> 00:42:50,832
Have you been here before?

577
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,890
No, sir.

578
00:42:53,401 --> 00:42:54,494
Hello?

579
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,163
May I see your driver's license, please?

580
00:42:57,172 --> 00:42:58,504
Yes, it is. Um...

581
00:42:58,573 --> 00:43:00,338
the one you...

582
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,566
Hi, <i>papito.</i>

583
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:00,623
Hi.

584
00:44:03,971 --> 00:44:05,565
Walter. Thank you for coming.

585
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,609
Of course.

586
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,936
How is Zainab?

587
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,412
She's upset. Um...

588
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:15,245
I have a... a letter from her.

589
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:16,578
Oh, you can't give it to me.

590
00:44:16,649 --> 00:44:19,246
It has to be sent to me by mail.

591
00:44:20,386 --> 00:44:21,581
Oh.

592
00:44:21,654 --> 00:44:23,647
But... But you can put it up to the glass.

593
00:44:24,657 --> 00:44:25,590
Go ahead. Open it up

594
00:44:25,658 --> 00:44:27,924
and press it up to the glass
so I can read it.

595
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:31,127
It's okay. It's allowed.

596
00:44:42,976 --> 00:44:45,139
You want to say hello to <i>papá?</i>

597
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:50,616
Oh...

598
00:44:56,688 --> 00:44:58,248
Thank you, Walter.

599
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,588
So how are they treating you?

600
00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:06,522
It's very depressing here.

601
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,633
There's no privacy.

602
00:45:09,701 --> 00:45:10,964
The lights are always on.

603
00:45:12,537 --> 00:45:13,562
You need anything?

604
00:45:13,638 --> 00:45:16,040
No. I just want to get out of here.

605
00:45:17,374 --> 00:45:20,244
Well... Zainab and I met
with a lawyer today.

606
00:45:20,311 --> 00:45:22,247
Yes? What did he say?

607
00:45:22,313 --> 00:45:24,978
Well, he's... he's gonna
stop by tomorrow and see you.

608
00:45:27,385 --> 00:45:32,020
Tarek. Zainab said
that you were denied asylum.

609
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:33,649
You mean when we came here?

610
00:45:33,724 --> 00:45:35,193
Yeah.

611
00:45:35,259 --> 00:45:37,729
Did you go to your deportation hearing?

612
00:45:37,995 --> 00:45:39,487
Yeah.

613
00:45:39,563 --> 00:45:40,656
In Michigan.

614
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:42,428
Yeah. We did everything they told us to.

615
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,729
Okay.

616
00:45:45,703 --> 00:45:47,137
Let's go, man. You gotta get off.

617
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,672
Bed count.

618
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:50,332
I have to go.

619
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:53,173
They have to do a bed count.

620
00:45:53,243 --> 00:45:55,042
Usually, I can visit for one hour.

621
00:45:55,112 --> 00:45:56,171
Could you come tomorrow?

622
00:45:56,246 --> 00:45:58,614
- I will. Yeah.
- Good.

623
00:45:58,683 --> 00:46:00,015
Good-bye, my friend.

624
00:46:00,084 --> 00:46:01,074
Good-bye.

625
00:46:12,762 --> 00:46:13,695
I'll see you tomorrow.

626
00:46:13,763 --> 00:46:15,426
Okay. Bye.

627
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:23,035
Walter, I'm going to leave now.

628
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,703
I have a cousin who lives in the Bronx.

629
00:46:26,776 --> 00:46:29,269
I'm going to go
stay with him for now.

630
00:46:30,479 --> 00:46:32,210
You don't have to go.
You can stay here.

631
00:46:33,616 --> 00:46:35,278
I think it's better I leave.

632
00:46:36,285 --> 00:46:39,746
Um... you know how to reach me
if you need to.

633
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,529
Is it okay if I leave
Tarek's things here for now?

634
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:52,403
Uh, my cousin's place is...
not very big.

635
00:46:53,468 --> 00:46:54,697
Yes, of course.

636
00:46:55,804 --> 00:46:57,033
Thank you.

637
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,117
Hello?

638
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:22,829
Oh. Hi, Charles.

639
00:47:24,332 --> 00:47:26,325
Oh. Wait. I'm sorry. Wha... What?

640
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,071
Yeah. The conference went very well.

641
00:47:30,137 --> 00:47:31,606
Yes.

642
00:47:31,672 --> 00:47:35,270
No, uh, actually, I'm still in New York,
and I'm doing some research for my book.

643
00:47:35,343 --> 00:47:36,606
Why?

644
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:39,306
When's the meeting?

645
00:47:39,379 --> 00:47:40,780
Wha...

646
00:47:40,848 --> 00:47:41,781
Oh. Okay.

647
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:44,115
All right. I... I'll, um...

648
00:47:44,185 --> 00:47:46,621
I'll leave first thing tomorrow.

649
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:49,453
Yeah. I'll see you at 3. Bye.

650
00:47:59,533 --> 00:48:01,526
I thought you said
you went to the hearing.

651
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:03,298
We did. I remember it.

652
00:48:03,371 --> 00:48:05,807
Well, then why is there
a final order out on you?

653
00:48:05,872 --> 00:48:07,466
He didn't know yet. He just said

654
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,513
that unless they can find a way
to reopen the case quickly,

655
00:48:10,577 --> 00:48:11,806
they're going to deport me.

656
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,646
I don't even understand it.

657
00:48:15,715 --> 00:48:18,653
Walter, there are guys
who have been in here for years.

658
00:48:18,718 --> 00:48:20,482
I can't do that, Walter. I'll go crazy.

659
00:48:20,553 --> 00:48:23,822
He's trying to deal with the case
as quickly as possible.

660
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,826
I know. I know. It's...

661
00:48:25,892 --> 00:48:27,360
It's just...

662
00:48:28,427 --> 00:48:30,693
Look, maybe we
should call your mother.

663
00:48:30,763 --> 00:48:34,203
No. No. I don't want her to worry.

664
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:36,724
Yeah.

665
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:42,709
Tarek, um...

666
00:48:44,476 --> 00:48:45,842
I have to go back to Connecticut.

667
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:47,346
When?

668
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:48,676
Tomorrow.

669
00:48:48,747 --> 00:48:51,217
But I'll be reachable
by phone if you need anything.

670
00:48:51,283 --> 00:48:54,518
And I'll be back to visit. It's not far.

671
00:48:54,586 --> 00:48:55,849
Okay.

672
00:48:55,921 --> 00:48:57,355
Just please...

673
00:48:57,422 --> 00:48:58,857
don't forget about me in here.

674
00:48:58,924 --> 00:49:00,586
No, I won't.

675
00:49:04,263 --> 00:49:05,857
So have you been practicing?

676
00:49:05,931 --> 00:49:07,866
Yes.

677
00:49:07,933 --> 00:49:09,765
You should go back to the drum circle.

678
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:10,859
No.

679
00:49:12,937 --> 00:49:15,932
Okay, but listen to that Fela CD.
That will help you.

680
00:49:16,208 --> 00:49:17,938
- I promise.
- I will. I will.

681
00:49:20,446 --> 00:49:22,746
So show me what you...
you've been working on.

682
00:49:22,814 --> 00:49:24,545
What?

683
00:49:24,616 --> 00:49:26,449
Show me. Why not?

684
00:49:26,517 --> 00:49:27,485
Here?

685
00:49:27,552 --> 00:49:29,613
Come on. I need some music, man.

686
00:49:30,955 --> 00:49:32,891
Don't worry. They can't arrest you.

687
00:49:32,957 --> 00:49:34,425
At least, not yet.

688
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,950
Mmm...

689
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:38,355
Come on.

690
00:49:59,816 --> 00:50:00,909
Good.

691
00:50:05,989 --> 00:50:07,982
Oh, no. An elbow.

692
00:50:31,348 --> 00:50:32,407
Hello.

693
00:50:32,482 --> 00:50:33,450
Oh, I'm sorry. I must've got

694
00:50:33,517 --> 00:50:35,953
- the wrong apartment.
- Can I help you?

695
00:50:36,018 --> 00:50:37,544
I'm looking for my son.

696
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:38,781
Excuse me.

697
00:50:38,854 --> 00:50:41,017
Uh, are...
are you Tarek's mother?

698
00:50:42,758 --> 00:50:43,748
Yes.

699
00:50:43,826 --> 00:50:47,287
Well, this is Tarek's apartment.

700
00:50:47,363 --> 00:50:48,456
I j...

701
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,022
I share the apartment with him.

702
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,795
He didn't mention
that he lived with someone.

703
00:50:55,037 --> 00:50:56,562
Well, I'm not here very often.

704
00:50:56,638 --> 00:50:58,039
I... I live in Connecticut.

705
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:00,805
Is Tarek here?

706
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:03,973
No. He's not here now.

707
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:06,038
Uh, come in... please.

708
00:51:08,883 --> 00:51:10,044
Please.

709
00:51:12,388 --> 00:51:13,447
Thank you.

710
00:51:21,396 --> 00:51:23,662
Oh, my name is Walter. Walter Vale.

711
00:51:23,732 --> 00:51:25,496
I'm... I'm Mouna Khalil.

712
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,594
I'm sorry to show up unannounced.

713
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:30,466
My son hasn't called me for five days.

714
00:51:30,538 --> 00:51:33,066
I keep trying his cell phone,
but he doesn't answer.

715
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:36,004
Would you like to sit down?

716
00:51:36,077 --> 00:51:37,067
Thank you.

717
00:51:55,429 --> 00:51:57,023
Mr. Vale?

718
00:51:57,097 --> 00:51:58,565
Is my son all right?

719
00:51:58,631 --> 00:51:59,621
Yes.

720
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:02,433
He's been arrested.

721
00:52:04,604 --> 00:52:06,836
He's being held in a detention center.

722
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:08,873
Where?

723
00:52:08,942 --> 00:52:10,035
In Queens.

724
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,444
Uh, they're tying to deport him.

725
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:18,042
How did this happen?

726
00:52:18,117 --> 00:52:21,055
He was stopped in a subway station.

727
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,092
Uh... he didn't... didn't
do anything wrong.

728
00:52:27,126 --> 00:52:29,119
I'd like to go there, to Queens.

729
00:52:30,797 --> 00:52:31,787
Okay.

730
00:52:33,132 --> 00:52:35,568
But, Mrs. Khalil, um, the lawyer m...

731
00:52:37,136 --> 00:52:39,504
Uh, I just don't
think it's possible for you...

732
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:42,909
Mr. Vale, I know I cannot visit Tarek.

733
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:45,971
I just want to see the place
where they're holding him.

734
00:52:47,813 --> 00:52:48,803
Okay.

735
00:52:49,981 --> 00:52:51,074
I can take you there.

736
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,618
Thank you.

737
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:56,151
Could we go now?

738
00:53:16,007 --> 00:53:18,477
So have you been
to New York before, Mrs. Khalil?

739
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:22,676
No. Tarek wanted to come to New York
to play music.

740
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,875
I did not want him to, but...

741
00:53:25,883 --> 00:53:27,477
Do you have
any children, Mr. Vale?

742
00:53:27,552 --> 00:53:29,715
A son. He lives in London.

743
00:53:29,787 --> 00:53:31,814
And your wife?

744
00:53:31,889 --> 00:53:33,791
My wife passed away.

745
00:53:33,857 --> 00:53:34,847
I'm sorry.

746
00:53:41,833 --> 00:53:42,823
That's it.

747
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:46,870
- This is where the prison is?
- Mm-hmm.

748
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:48,964
It doesn't look like a prison.

749
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:50,530
I think that's the point.

750
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:54,640
How many people are in there?

751
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:56,578
Tarek said about 300.

752
00:53:58,215 --> 00:53:59,649
There's, uh...

753
00:53:59,716 --> 00:54:01,208
There's a coffee shop on that corner.

754
00:54:01,485 --> 00:54:03,216
- It's not very nice.
- I'll wait there.

755
00:54:40,088 --> 00:54:42,183
Walter. I thought you were leaving.

756
00:54:42,258 --> 00:54:43,248
I was.

757
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:46,995
Tarek, your mother is here.

758
00:54:47,062 --> 00:54:49,191
What? My mother? Where?

759
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:51,097
She's waiting outside.

760
00:54:52,935 --> 00:54:53,868
When did she arrive?

761
00:54:53,935 --> 00:54:54,868
Today.

762
00:54:54,937 --> 00:54:57,032
Man. Why did she come?

763
00:54:57,105 --> 00:54:58,505
She can do nothing for me.

764
00:54:58,574 --> 00:55:01,045
Well, she said
she hadn't heard from you.

765
00:55:02,944 --> 00:55:05,210
Walter, listen to me.

766
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,714
She... She can't stay here.

767
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,774
She doesn't know
anyone in New York.

768
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:11,514
I'm sorry, but you must get her
to go back to Michigan.

769
00:55:13,288 --> 00:55:15,884
Okay. Okay, I'll try.

770
00:55:15,956 --> 00:55:17,220
Thank you, Walter.

771
00:55:18,959 --> 00:55:20,292
I have a note from her.

772
00:55:37,813 --> 00:55:38,974
Need anything else?

773
00:55:40,314 --> 00:55:41,646
No, thank you.

774
00:56:26,359 --> 00:56:27,292
Hello, sir.

775
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,350
Hi.

776
00:56:30,963 --> 00:56:31,953
How is he?

777
00:56:32,031 --> 00:56:33,625
Oh, he's good. He's good.

778
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,795
Um... but...

779
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:38,362
he's very concerned
about you being here.

780
00:56:40,372 --> 00:56:41,966
I will not leave.

781
00:56:44,376 --> 00:56:46,677
Mrs. Khalil, I don't... I don't think

782
00:56:46,745 --> 00:56:48,304
your being in New York will do any good

783
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,282
because we have a very good lawyer
working on Tarek's...

784
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:51,647
Mr. Vale.

785
00:56:51,717 --> 00:56:53,687
I will not go back to Michigan

786
00:56:53,752 --> 00:56:56,656
knowing that my son is in that building.

787
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,383
Even if I can't see him...

788
00:57:01,393 --> 00:57:02,884
I will stay here.

789
00:57:08,734 --> 00:57:09,793
Shall we go?

790
00:57:14,105 --> 00:57:15,631
Uh madame?

791
00:57:21,746 --> 00:57:22,736
Bye.

792
00:57:31,256 --> 00:57:32,349
Mr. Vale?

793
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:35,286
I'm leaving now.

794
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,352
Thank you for your help.

795
00:57:37,428 --> 00:57:38,726
Where are you going?

796
00:57:39,764 --> 00:57:41,062
I'll find a hotel.

797
00:57:41,131 --> 00:57:43,864
You can stay here.
You can use Tarek's room.

798
00:57:45,268 --> 00:57:48,104
Thank you for your offer,
but I cannot accept it.

799
00:57:48,171 --> 00:57:49,697
I don't want to impose on you.

800
00:57:49,774 --> 00:57:51,367
You're not imposing.

801
00:57:51,441 --> 00:57:53,935
Please. I would like you to stay.

802
00:57:54,946 --> 00:57:55,936
Thank you.

803
00:57:56,947 --> 00:57:58,108
But I will manage.

804
00:58:02,787 --> 00:58:04,221
Good-bye.

805
00:58:04,287 --> 00:58:05,414
Good-bye.

806
00:58:22,472 --> 00:58:24,465
Um... Mrs... Mrs. Khalil?

807
00:58:26,476 --> 00:58:27,466
Please.

808
00:58:28,812 --> 00:58:30,748
I was with Tarek
when he was arrested.

809
00:58:30,814 --> 00:58:33,752
He was in the subway
in the first place because of me.

810
00:58:33,817 --> 00:58:34,807
So...

811
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:37,048
please.

812
00:58:38,054 --> 00:58:39,488
Even if it's just for one night.

813
00:58:53,002 --> 00:58:55,496
Um, the bathroom is across the hall.

814
00:58:56,505 --> 00:58:57,438
Thank you, Mr. Vale.

815
00:58:57,506 --> 00:59:00,444
No. Call me Walter.

816
00:59:00,509 --> 00:59:01,499
And I'm Mouna.

817
00:59:03,012 --> 00:59:04,743
So... do you need anything else?

818
00:59:04,813 --> 00:59:05,906
No, thank you.

819
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:09,444
Well... good night.

820
00:59:09,517 --> 00:59:10,507
Good night.

821
00:59:49,222 --> 00:59:50,383
Okay?

822
00:59:55,495 --> 00:59:56,554
Bye.

823
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,442
Oh. Good morning.

824
01:00:10,511 --> 01:00:11,444
Morning.

825
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:12,570
Mmhh...

826
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:19,018
Tarek says hello.

827
01:00:20,087 --> 01:00:21,521
How is he?

828
01:00:21,587 --> 01:00:23,079
I can't really tell.

829
01:00:26,592 --> 01:00:28,528
He wants me to leave.

830
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:35,371
Well... you're welcome to stay here
as long as you need to.

831
01:00:35,434 --> 01:00:36,367
Thank you.

832
01:00:36,435 --> 01:00:38,132
That's very generous of you.

833
01:00:38,205 --> 01:00:41,040
Well... thank you for the paper.

834
01:00:41,106 --> 01:00:42,131
You're welcome.

835
01:01:00,625 --> 01:01:03,563
Do you spend a lot of time in the city?

836
01:01:03,628 --> 01:01:06,395
No, no. Not really.

837
01:01:06,464 --> 01:01:09,561
I'm just here
presenting a paper at a conference.

838
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:11,399
Well...

839
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:12,402
You wrote it?

840
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,460
Mm-hmm.

841
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:15,971
Congratulations.

842
01:01:20,478 --> 01:01:22,414
I co-authored it, really.

843
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:30,653
And what happened after the hearing?

844
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:33,985
We appealed. It took two years.

845
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,356
And your appeal was denied?

846
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:36,918
Yes.

847
01:01:36,995 --> 01:01:39,261
And did they send you
your bag-and-baggage letter?

848
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,061
- No.
- What's that?

849
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:44,103
Basically, it tells you
where to show up and be deported.

850
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:45,158
But you didn't receive it?

851
01:01:46,337 --> 01:01:48,432
No. I would remember this.

852
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:49,939
Did you move?

853
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:51,533
Eventually, we had to.

854
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:53,601
But we had our mail advanced.

855
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:56,615
Is it possible that it
just never got there?

856
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,114
Yeah, it's happened before.

857
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,618
And pre-9/11, it wasn't much of a priority
trackin' people down,

858
01:02:00,684 --> 01:02:04,179
but if you got it and you just ignored it,
then there's nothing I can do.

859
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:09,293
So... you can help him.

860
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:11,123
I'm gonna try.

861
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:12,926
But you should know it's still a long shot.

862
01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:14,396
The government's approach
has changed radically.

863
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:15,625
It's very black and white now.

864
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:17,224
Either you belong, or you don't.

865
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:20,137
Tarek's lucky.
Most of them don't even have lawyers.

866
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:21,432
Lucky.

867
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:23,064
Relatively speaking.

868
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,574
We just have to move quickly

869
01:02:24,641 --> 01:02:26,634
to get an emergency stay,
and then we'll stick with a motion

870
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,440
to reopen, pending his green card application.

871
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:29,501
Yeah?

872
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:32,280
Okay.

873
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:35,113
Can you explain
what that means, please?

874
01:02:35,183 --> 01:02:36,982
Actually, I don't have
the time right now.

875
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:39,353
I'm sorry.
I have to be in court very shortly.

876
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:40,651
How long will he be in detention?

877
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:44,492
I can't predict that. I am sorry,
but I am gonna have to wrap this up.

878
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,726
Do you have any children, Mr. Shah?

879
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,664
Yeah. Two kids.

880
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:53,362
And for what it's worth,
my uncle was deported

881
01:02:53,435 --> 01:02:55,667
after raising a family here for 23 years.

882
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:59,667
If I can get your son out... I will.

883
01:03:00,976 --> 01:03:01,966
Thank you.

884
01:03:06,715 --> 01:03:07,705
Where are you from?

885
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,740
Queens.

886
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,684
Which one is she?

887
01:03:13,755 --> 01:03:14,688
The one closest to us.

888
01:03:14,756 --> 01:03:16,658
That black woman?

889
01:03:16,725 --> 01:03:17,658
Mm-hmm.

890
01:03:17,726 --> 01:03:18,659
That is Zainab?

891
01:03:18,727 --> 01:03:19,717
Mm-hmm.

892
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:23,429
She's very black.

893
01:03:24,432 --> 01:03:25,422
Mm-hmm.

894
01:03:33,607 --> 01:03:34,734
Zainab.

895
01:03:36,111 --> 01:03:37,602
Oh. Hi, Walter.

896
01:03:37,678 --> 01:03:40,046
Uh, Zainab, this is Mouna Khalil...

897
01:03:40,114 --> 01:03:41,708
Tarek's mother.

898
01:03:41,782 --> 01:03:43,045
- Oh...
- Hello, Zainab.

899
01:03:43,117 --> 01:03:44,381
Oh, I...

900
01:03:44,452 --> 01:03:46,581
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Khalil.

901
01:03:46,654 --> 01:03:47,644
You, too.

902
01:03:48,689 --> 01:03:51,125
Uh... I'm s... I'm sorry.

903
01:03:51,191 --> 01:03:52,717
I... I didn't know
you were coming.

904
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:54,786
Neither did I.

905
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,065
Your jewelry is very nice.

906
01:04:01,135 --> 01:04:02,398
Oh.

907
01:04:02,468 --> 01:04:03,697
Oh, thank you.

908
01:04:06,806 --> 01:04:09,369
Do you think we can go out
for a cup of tea sometime?

909
01:04:09,442 --> 01:04:11,412
Oh... yeah.

910
01:04:11,477 --> 01:04:12,740
We could go right now.

911
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:15,750
I... I am...
I'm just watching Zev's table,

912
01:04:15,815 --> 01:04:18,047
but I... um...

913
01:04:18,117 --> 01:04:21,818
I just need to... find someone to...

914
01:04:28,661 --> 01:04:29,754
Hey.

915
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:30,819
Hi.

916
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:36,359
Is it a necklace?

917
01:04:36,435 --> 01:04:37,562
I think so.

918
01:04:39,339 --> 01:04:40,830
I like that one in the front.

919
01:04:42,508 --> 01:04:43,498
Um...

920
01:04:44,643 --> 01:04:45,838
It's all handmade.

921
01:04:47,513 --> 01:04:48,538
Ooh.

922
01:04:49,648 --> 01:04:52,620
I've lived here for two years,

923
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:55,315
and I was in France
for a year before that.

924
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:57,614
Do you miss home?

925
01:04:57,689 --> 01:05:00,125
Yes, sometimes.

926
01:05:01,392 --> 01:05:02,861
But I don't want to live there.

927
01:05:04,696 --> 01:05:05,857
Do you miss Syria?

928
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,566
Sometimes, too.

929
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:13,139
I miss Damascus...

930
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:14,230
the smell.

931
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:18,374
But this is my home now.

932
01:05:20,545 --> 01:05:21,877
When did you meet Walter?

933
01:05:22,147 --> 01:05:24,310
Walter? Uh...

934
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:26,785
about ten days ago.

935
01:05:26,851 --> 01:05:29,186
Ten days? That's all?

936
01:05:29,253 --> 01:05:30,653
Mm-hmm.

937
01:05:31,889 --> 01:05:33,654
How did you meet him?

938
01:05:33,724 --> 01:05:34,714
Uh...

939
01:05:35,893 --> 01:05:37,624
through Tarek's friend.

940
01:05:37,695 --> 01:05:40,165
Ivan. That's how we
ended up living there.

941
01:05:40,231 --> 01:05:42,292
You live there, too?

942
01:05:43,434 --> 01:05:44,903
Just for a little while.

943
01:05:45,903 --> 01:05:46,893
Oh.

944
01:05:54,411 --> 01:05:56,847
So... have you spoken to Tarek?

945
01:05:56,913 --> 01:05:58,678
Yes.

946
01:05:58,748 --> 01:06:00,342
He called me this morning.

947
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:02,148
He sounded in a good spirit.

948
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:06,516
I was so afraid this was going to happen.

949
01:06:08,258 --> 01:06:10,491
Tarek used to tease me
that I worry too much.

950
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,550
But now...

951
01:06:13,863 --> 01:06:15,799
I just don't know what to do.

952
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:19,263
I miss him so much.

953
01:06:21,604 --> 01:06:22,629
I'm sorry.

954
01:06:27,944 --> 01:06:28,934
Zainab.

955
01:06:30,446 --> 01:06:32,313
I'd like you to do something for me.

956
01:06:32,382 --> 01:06:36,220
I'd like you to show me
something you and Tarek like to do,

957
01:06:36,286 --> 01:06:37,720
somewhere you like to go.

958
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:40,685
Like what?

959
01:06:41,724 --> 01:06:43,387
Whatever you like.

960
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:45,554
Okay.

961
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:46,959
Okay.

962
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,708
So what is in Staten Island?

963
01:07:05,713 --> 01:07:06,909
I don't know.

964
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:09,384
We would just go there
and then come back.

965
01:07:09,451 --> 01:07:10,476
We never got off.

966
01:07:10,552 --> 01:07:11,542
Why?

967
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:13,920
It was free.

968
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,221
We felt like we were going somewhere.

969
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:21,256
Oh. That's where the Twin Towers were.

970
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:24,233
I never saw them, but... Tarek did.

971
01:07:25,266 --> 01:07:26,427
Oh. And...

972
01:07:26,502 --> 01:07:27,970
there's the Statue.

973
01:07:28,236 --> 01:07:30,263
And behind that is Ellis Island.

974
01:07:31,372 --> 01:07:34,937
Sometimes Tarek would point at the Statue
and jump up and down

975
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,741
like we're arriving
in New York for the first time.

976
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,415
It was very funny.

977
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,953
Can you go up in the Statue?

978
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,613
Oh, yeah.

979
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:48,678
I think so.

980
01:07:49,856 --> 01:07:50,915
You haven't been there?

981
01:07:50,991 --> 01:07:51,924
No.

982
01:07:51,992 --> 01:07:52,925
Never?

983
01:07:52,993 --> 01:07:53,961
Nope.

984
01:07:54,027 --> 01:07:55,656
Oh.

985
01:07:56,663 --> 01:07:57,961
Excuse me.

986
01:07:58,031 --> 01:07:59,021
Hello?

987
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:01,023
Hey, Charles.

988
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,428
What's that?

989
01:08:03,504 --> 01:08:06,704
Um, yeah. I'm still in New York.

990
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,676
I'm sorry, Charles.
I couldn't make it back yesterday.

991
01:08:11,745 --> 01:08:14,375
I said I couldn't make it back!

992
01:08:14,447 --> 01:08:15,848
Well, I'm on a boat.

993
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:17,943
A boat!

994
01:08:18,018 --> 01:08:20,511
Listen, Charles, I'll explain it to you
when I see you.

995
01:08:20,587 --> 01:08:22,318
But I have to go now,
so I'll call you back.

996
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:23,379
Bye.

997
01:08:35,067 --> 01:08:36,434
You went on the ferry?

998
01:08:36,502 --> 01:08:37,470
Yes.

999
01:08:37,536 --> 01:08:38,629
No.

1000
01:08:38,705 --> 01:08:40,298
- My mother, too?
- She liked it.

1001
01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:46,013
You know that they don't even have
an outside space here.

1002
01:08:46,078 --> 01:08:48,378
They just have a room
with its roof cut out.

1003
01:08:48,447 --> 01:08:49,676
Really?

1004
01:08:49,747 --> 01:08:52,082
Some crazy stuff, man.

1005
01:08:53,919 --> 01:08:55,353
And they seemed to get along...

1006
01:08:55,421 --> 01:08:56,354
Zainab and my mother?

1007
01:08:56,422 --> 01:08:59,417
Yes. I think your mother
likes her very much.

1008
01:09:02,428 --> 01:09:04,021
My mother's not going home, is she?

1009
01:09:04,095 --> 01:09:06,088
I don't think so.

1010
01:09:07,865 --> 01:09:09,732
I know she's thinking about my father.

1011
01:09:10,935 --> 01:09:11,925
Why?

1012
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:16,033
He spent seven years in jail in Syria

1013
01:09:16,107 --> 01:09:18,100
because of something
he wrote in the newspaper.

1014
01:09:19,444 --> 01:09:22,906
By the time
they released him, he was very sick.

1015
01:09:24,616 --> 01:09:26,883
He died two months later.

1016
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:28,442
That's why we moved here.

1017
01:09:32,623 --> 01:09:34,058
Would you like a glass of wine?

1018
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:35,787
No, thank you.

1019
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:49,372
Mouna. Um...

1020
01:09:49,441 --> 01:09:54,075
I need to go back to Connecticut
tomorrow, for work. I told Tarek.

1021
01:09:54,144 --> 01:09:55,738
How long will you be gone?

1022
01:09:55,813 --> 01:09:57,874
Um, I don't know yet. I...

1023
01:09:59,149 --> 01:10:01,814
I'll try to get back
and visit him as soon as I can.

1024
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:06,917
Walter, you don't have
to keep visiting him.

1025
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,151
I'm sure you're busy.

1026
01:10:11,828 --> 01:10:13,161
I'll see what I can do.

1027
01:10:19,835 --> 01:10:21,098
Dinner will be ready soon.

1028
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,867
Oh. Okay.

1029
01:10:36,185 --> 01:10:38,678
Walter. Do you go to Broadway?

1030
01:10:39,789 --> 01:10:40,779
No, not really.

1031
01:10:42,525 --> 01:10:43,720
Tarek sent me the CD

1032
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:49,194
I think I know every word.

1033
01:10:56,204 --> 01:10:57,935
Tarek is teaching me the drum.

1034
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,807
Really? How is that going?

1035
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:03,142
Well, I... I sound a lot better

1036
01:11:03,211 --> 01:11:04,612
when he's playing with me.

1037
01:11:10,552 --> 01:11:11,851
How's your teaching?

1038
01:11:12,888 --> 01:11:13,821
My teaching?

1039
01:11:13,888 --> 01:11:14,821
Yes.

1040
01:11:14,889 --> 01:11:15,879
It's fine.

1041
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:18,553
How many classes do you have?

1042
01:11:19,893 --> 01:11:22,888
Well, I have a lighter schedule
so I can focus on my book.

1043
01:11:23,897 --> 01:11:24,990
Your book?

1044
01:11:25,065 --> 01:11:26,227
What is it about?

1045
01:11:27,735 --> 01:11:31,698
Well, it... covers quite a bit,
so it's hard to explain.

1046
01:11:31,772 --> 01:11:33,172
You're almost finished?

1047
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,005
I'm close.

1048
01:11:35,075 --> 01:11:36,065
Ahem.

1049
01:11:38,747 --> 01:11:40,876
You don't like
to talk about your work?

1050
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:42,884
Mmm, it's, uh... just not a process

1051
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:45,580
that's easy to talk about
with somebody who's not a writer.

1052
01:11:50,757 --> 01:11:51,747
Oh.

1053
01:11:57,765 --> 01:11:59,257
I shouldn't have
spoken to you like that.

1054
01:12:00,934 --> 01:12:01,924
It's okay.

1055
01:12:22,288 --> 01:12:24,053
- I'll get it, sir.
- Thanks.

1056
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:26,718
Well...

1057
01:12:26,794 --> 01:12:29,731
um, you have my number
if you need anything.

1058
01:12:29,796 --> 01:12:32,063
Thank you. I'll be fine.

1059
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:34,733
Here.

1060
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,235
Thank you.

1061
01:12:36,302 --> 01:12:37,235
Have a safe trip.

1062
01:12:37,303 --> 01:12:38,566
Thanks.

1063
01:12:38,638 --> 01:12:39,571
Good-bye.

1064
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:41,233
Good-bye.

1065
01:13:16,675 --> 01:13:17,734
Good afternoon.

1066
01:13:24,348 --> 01:13:26,615
Hi, Mouna. It's Walter.

1067
01:13:26,685 --> 01:13:30,351
Uh, no. I was, uh, just checking in
to make sure everything was okay.

1068
01:13:32,022 --> 01:13:33,320
Okay. Oh, good.

1069
01:13:33,591 --> 01:13:35,652
Uh, you know... working.

1070
01:13:39,029 --> 01:13:41,295
Okay. So... good.

1071
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,702
Good night.

1072
01:15:25,934 --> 01:15:26,959
Walter.

1073
01:15:27,969 --> 01:15:29,164
Hello.

1074
01:15:29,236 --> 01:15:31,297
I didn't expect you so soon.

1075
01:15:32,306 --> 01:15:34,208
Um, I just was cleaning a bit.

1076
01:15:39,313 --> 01:15:41,077
I love this CD.

1077
01:15:42,149 --> 01:15:43,174
Is it your wife?

1078
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:44,275
Yes.

1079
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:46,911
She was beautiful.

1080
01:15:46,987 --> 01:15:48,080
Thank you.

1081
01:15:51,826 --> 01:15:52,885
These are different glasses?

1082
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,018
Mm-hmm.

1083
01:15:54,095 --> 01:15:55,028
They're new?

1084
01:15:55,095 --> 01:15:56,256
They are, yeah.

1085
01:15:56,330 --> 01:15:58,095
They're nice.

1086
01:15:58,165 --> 01:15:59,258
Thank you.

1087
01:16:02,003 --> 01:16:04,064
I was going to cook some lunch.

1088
01:16:04,138 --> 01:16:05,128
Are you hungry?

1089
01:16:05,205 --> 01:16:07,437
Yes. That would be nice.

1090
01:16:07,507 --> 01:16:08,941
Okay.

1091
01:16:17,183 --> 01:16:18,116
Mouna?

1092
01:16:18,183 --> 01:16:19,242
Yes.

1093
01:16:19,319 --> 01:16:21,288
Mmm, I was wondering.

1094
01:16:21,354 --> 01:16:22,879
Um, uh, Thursday night.

1095
01:16:22,956 --> 01:16:24,117
Do you have any plans?

1096
01:16:25,492 --> 01:16:28,463
No, Walter. I have no plans.

1097
01:16:28,528 --> 01:16:32,262
Okay. Well, then, I thought...
maybe we might do something.

1098
01:16:33,867 --> 01:16:35,028
Okay.

1099
01:16:36,036 --> 01:16:37,026
Okay.

1100
01:16:44,877 --> 01:16:46,904
- They keep moving people.
- To where?

1101
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:50,146
I don't know. I think
to other detention centers.

1102
01:16:50,215 --> 01:16:51,945
Two Moroccan guys were just moved.

1103
01:16:52,017 --> 01:16:53,486
They had no idea.

1104
01:16:53,552 --> 01:16:55,248
Suddenly, they were just gone.

1105
01:16:55,321 --> 01:16:57,314
Has anyone said anything to you?

1106
01:16:57,389 --> 01:16:59,221
No. No one in here knows anything.

1107
01:17:01,192 --> 01:17:02,182
This is not fair.

1108
01:17:03,227 --> 01:17:04,924
I am not a criminal.

1109
01:17:04,997 --> 01:17:07,297
I have committed no crime.

1110
01:17:07,365 --> 01:17:08,492
What do they think?

1111
01:17:08,566 --> 01:17:10,502
I'm a terrorist?

1112
01:17:10,568 --> 01:17:12,435
There are no terrorists in here.

1113
01:17:12,504 --> 01:17:14,474
The terrorists have money.
They have support.

1114
01:17:14,539 --> 01:17:15,507
This is just not fair.

1115
01:17:15,573 --> 01:17:18,568
- I know.
- How do you know? You're out there.

1116
01:17:33,424 --> 01:17:35,394
I'm sorry. I... Um...

1117
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:49,205
I sit in here at night, and...

1118
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:52,537
I keep thinking about Zainab.

1119
01:17:56,413 --> 01:17:59,510
I just want to live my life
and play my music.

1120
01:18:03,287 --> 01:18:04,619
What's so wrong about that?

1121
01:18:12,462 --> 01:18:13,521
Okay.

1122
01:18:14,531 --> 01:18:15,556
Okay. Please do.

1123
01:18:15,632 --> 01:18:16,565
Yeah. Thank you.

1124
01:18:16,633 --> 01:18:17,623
Okay. Bye.

1125
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,060
What did he say?

1126
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:23,573
That he'd make some calls,

1127
01:18:23,639 --> 01:18:26,577
but they can move him
to another facility at their discretion.

1128
01:18:26,642 --> 01:18:29,205
What facility? Where?

1129
01:18:29,278 --> 01:18:31,373
He said it could be anywhere.

1130
01:18:31,447 --> 01:18:33,576
Upstate Pennsylvania.

1131
01:18:33,649 --> 01:18:35,585
There's even one in Louisiana.

1132
01:18:35,651 --> 01:18:37,245
Louisiana?

1133
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,583
Where they had the floods?

1134
01:18:38,654 --> 01:18:39,644
Mm-hmm.

1135
01:18:39,922 --> 01:18:41,049
But that's too far.

1136
01:18:41,123 --> 01:18:42,319
Yeah.

1137
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,391
Did the lawyer say anything else?

1138
01:18:46,462 --> 01:18:48,659
No. He didn't know anything else.

1139
01:18:52,501 --> 01:18:54,494
It's just like Syria.

1140
01:19:43,218 --> 01:19:44,311
Okay.

1141
01:19:44,385 --> 01:19:46,252
Bye, <i>habibti.</i> Good-bye.

1142
01:19:53,393 --> 01:19:54,656
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1143
01:19:54,728 --> 01:19:56,527
That's okay. How is he?

1144
01:19:56,597 --> 01:19:58,499
He says hello.

1145
01:19:58,565 --> 01:20:01,263
He wants to make sure
you're practicing your drum.

1146
01:20:01,335 --> 01:20:03,396
I am. So...

1147
01:20:04,404 --> 01:20:05,463
You look very nice.

1148
01:20:06,472 --> 01:20:07,998
Thank you.

1149
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:09,270
You, too.

1150
01:20:09,342 --> 01:20:10,743
Thank you.

1151
01:20:30,264 --> 01:20:32,291
Okay. That's good.

1152
01:20:33,298 --> 01:20:34,231
Thank you, sir.

1153
01:20:35,768 --> 01:20:37,066
You ready?

1154
01:20:37,136 --> 01:20:38,035
For what?

1155
01:20:38,104 --> 01:20:39,231
Well...

1156
01:20:39,304 --> 01:20:41,673
uh, I thought we'd go see this.

1157
01:20:43,743 --> 01:20:44,711
Really?

1158
01:20:44,777 --> 01:20:46,370
Yeah.

1159
01:20:46,445 --> 01:20:47,378
Now?

1160
01:20:47,445 --> 01:20:48,778
Yeah. Is that okay?

1161
01:20:50,283 --> 01:20:52,515
Yes. That's wonderful.

1162
01:20:53,585 --> 01:20:54,518
Thank you.

1163
01:20:54,586 --> 01:20:56,146
I'm so excited.

1164
01:20:57,422 --> 01:20:59,585
Okay. Don't move.

1165
01:21:30,321 --> 01:21:31,289
You know...

1166
01:21:31,356 --> 01:21:34,522
I think that show
was really kind of scary.

1167
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:36,151
It was a little scary. Yeah.

1168
01:21:36,228 --> 01:21:37,389
Yeah.

1169
01:21:39,264 --> 01:21:40,197
Are you finished?

1170
01:21:40,265 --> 01:21:41,733
Yes. Thank you.

1171
01:21:41,799 --> 01:21:42,732
How was everything?

1172
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,599
- Great.
- Very good.

1173
01:21:44,668 --> 01:21:47,401
Actually, I think
I'd like a glass of wine, please.

1174
01:21:47,472 --> 01:21:49,202
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't even think to ask.

1175
01:21:49,273 --> 01:21:50,765
It's okay.

1176
01:21:50,841 --> 01:21:53,243
It's not every night
that you see <i>The Phantom.</i>

1177
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:55,370
I'll have a Cabernet.

1178
01:21:55,445 --> 01:21:56,378
Cabernet.

1179
01:21:56,447 --> 01:21:57,380
Two, please.

1180
01:21:57,447 --> 01:21:58,642
Excellent.

1181
01:21:58,716 --> 01:22:02,416
Well, I haven't been to the theater
in a long time. Me, neither.

1182
01:22:02,485 --> 01:22:05,787
There's a place in Syria called Malula.

1183
01:22:05,855 --> 01:22:08,725
It's a very big outdoor theater.

1184
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:09,781
It's beautiful.

1185
01:22:09,859 --> 01:22:13,458
We used to take Tarek there
to see concerts.

1186
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:16,159
- Here you go. Two Cabernets.
- Thank you.

1187
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:17,861
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1188
01:22:18,868 --> 01:22:19,801
Well.

1189
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:21,805
Cheers.

1190
01:22:28,211 --> 01:22:29,440
Mmm.

1191
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:31,778
Mouna. Um...

1192
01:22:33,716 --> 01:22:36,813
I'm taking a leave of absence...
uh, for the rest of the semester.

1193
01:22:36,886 --> 01:22:37,819
Ahem.

1194
01:22:37,887 --> 01:22:39,788
Really? Why?

1195
01:22:39,856 --> 01:22:43,317
Well, I thought I might
spend some more time in New York.

1196
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:48,629
Walter, you don't
have to do this. You're busy.

1197
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,428
No, I want to.

1198
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:52,833
But you have to be in Connecticut.

1199
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:55,338
You have your teaching, your book.

1200
01:22:55,405 --> 01:22:57,466
No, it's fine. Really.

1201
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:00,512
This is not your problem, Walter.

1202
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:03,536
It's okay that you're busy.

1203
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:07,409
I'm not busy.

1204
01:23:09,251 --> 01:23:11,346
Not at all.

1205
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:15,383
The truth is I haven't done any real work
in a very long time.

1206
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:18,258
But you just
presented your paper at the conference.

1207
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,820
No. No. No, I didn't even write it.

1208
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:21,920
I just read it.

1209
01:23:24,598 --> 01:23:26,625
I've been teaching
the same course for 20 years,

1210
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,932
and it... doesn't mean anything to me.

1211
01:23:29,937 --> 01:23:31,406
None of it does.

1212
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:35,502
I pretend.

1213
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:41,774
I pretend that I'm busy,
that I'm working, that I'm writing.

1214
01:23:45,619 --> 01:23:47,282
I'm not doing anything.

1215
01:23:53,626 --> 01:23:54,685
I'm sorry.

1216
01:23:55,695 --> 01:23:56,958
Don't be.

1217
01:23:57,231 --> 01:23:59,963
I really appreciate you telling me this.

1218
01:24:06,307 --> 01:24:07,673
Um, Walter.

1219
01:24:09,309 --> 01:24:11,439
What would you do if you didn't teach?

1220
01:24:14,648 --> 01:24:15,980
I don't know.

1221
01:24:16,249 --> 01:24:18,982
It's kind of exciting not to know.

1222
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:25,481
What time is it?

1223
01:24:25,558 --> 01:24:27,255
Uh, 12:30.

1224
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:28,921
My God. Is it?

1225
01:24:28,995 --> 01:24:31,591
Yeah. I think that happens
a lot in New York.

1226
01:24:31,663 --> 01:24:32,996
It's...

1227
01:24:33,999 --> 01:24:35,593
Thank you, Walter.

1228
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:37,728
It was a lovely evening.

1229
01:24:37,803 --> 01:24:41,299
It's the most fun I had in a long time.

1230
01:24:41,374 --> 01:24:43,867
Yeah, I told Tarek
I was taking you tonight, and I did.

1231
01:24:43,943 --> 01:24:45,776
I think he was happy about it.

1232
01:24:46,912 --> 01:24:47,845
Thank you.

1233
01:24:52,685 --> 01:24:53,618
Good night.

1234
01:24:53,686 --> 01:24:54,676
Good night.

1235
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:29,814
There's a message from Tarek.
Something's wrong.

1236
01:25:29,887 --> 01:25:31,515
What did he say?

1237
01:25:31,588 --> 01:25:33,855
He said they were moving him.
He didn't know what it meant.

1238
01:25:33,925 --> 01:25:35,052
We should go.

1239
01:25:40,898 --> 01:25:42,993
Okay. When do you expect him?

1240
01:25:43,067 --> 01:25:44,501
All right. When he gets in,

1241
01:25:44,569 --> 01:25:46,038
could you have him
call me as soon as possible?

1242
01:25:46,304 --> 01:25:48,570
Uh, please.
It's an emergency. Thank you.

1243
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,336
God, he's still in court.

1244
01:25:50,408 --> 01:25:52,935
Come on, come on,
come on. Can you hurry?

1245
01:25:53,009 --> 01:25:54,672
Sorry, sir.

1246
01:25:54,744 --> 01:25:56,076
I hate this feeling.

1247
01:26:23,106 --> 01:26:26,374
Um... I'm here for bed 38... Tarek Khalil.

1248
01:26:26,443 --> 01:26:28,538
Visiting hours start at 5 p.m.

1249
01:26:28,611 --> 01:26:29,874
What? I'm sorry. Excuse me?

1250
01:26:29,945 --> 01:26:32,006
- Visiting hours are at 5 p.m.
- Oh. Um,

1251
01:26:32,081 --> 01:26:33,106
it... I... I understand.

1252
01:26:33,383 --> 01:26:35,045
But this is e... extremely urgent.

1253
01:26:35,117 --> 01:26:36,380
Could you please check for me?

1254
01:26:39,121 --> 01:26:40,886
Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.

1255
01:26:44,126 --> 01:26:46,119
He is no longer with us.

1256
01:26:47,596 --> 01:26:49,498
Well... wh...

1257
01:26:49,565 --> 01:26:50,590
What does that mean?

1258
01:26:50,665 --> 01:26:52,692
I'm not sure.

1259
01:26:52,767 --> 01:26:53,963
What do you mean you're not su...?

1260
01:26:54,036 --> 01:26:58,067
I mean was he moved to another facility,
another state, what?

1261
01:26:58,140 --> 01:26:59,073
I don't know.

1262
01:26:59,141 --> 01:27:02,409
I just know that that detainee
is no longer at the facility.

1263
01:27:02,478 --> 01:27:05,917
Well, coul... could you please find
someone who... who does know?

1264
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,141
I would appreciate it.

1265
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:09,611
- Hold on.
- Thank you.

1266
01:27:09,684 --> 01:27:11,050
Thank you very much.

1267
01:27:12,053 --> 01:27:14,080
Yes. Khalil. 38?

1268
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:18,650
Okay.

1269
01:27:18,727 --> 01:27:19,752
Yes.

1270
01:27:22,497 --> 01:27:23,932
- Sir?
- Yes? Did you find him?

1271
01:27:23,998 --> 01:27:25,091
He's been removed.

1272
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:26,429
Removed to where?

1273
01:27:26,501 --> 01:27:27,730
Deported.

1274
01:27:27,801 --> 01:27:29,031
Deported?

1275
01:27:30,505 --> 01:27:31,495
When?

1276
01:27:32,507 --> 01:27:33,998
He was deported this morning.

1277
01:27:35,008 --> 01:27:36,170
How can that be?

1278
01:27:37,178 --> 01:27:38,168
No, he...

1279
01:27:45,853 --> 01:27:48,187
Um... sir, is, uh...

1280
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:51,125
Is there any way that I could contact him?

1281
01:27:51,191 --> 01:27:53,127
I don't think so.

1282
01:27:53,193 --> 01:27:55,994
You don't think so.
What kind of an answer is that?

1283
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:59,126
I'm sorry, sir.
That's all the information that I have.

1284
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:00,132
Okay.

1285
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,432
Now, please step away from the window?

1286
01:28:04,171 --> 01:28:07,075
You can contact I.C.
if you have any further questions.

1287
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,540
The number's on the wall.

1288
01:28:11,043 --> 01:28:12,137
Sir?

1289
01:28:12,212 --> 01:28:14,205
Step away from the window, please?

1290
01:28:16,716 --> 01:28:21,988
Sir. For the last time,
step away from the window.

1291
01:28:49,915 --> 01:28:52,682
You can't just take people away like that.

1292
01:28:52,752 --> 01:28:54,186
Do you hear me?

1293
01:28:54,253 --> 01:28:57,555
He was a good man, a good person.

1294
01:28:58,591 --> 01:29:00,082
It's not fair!

1295
01:29:01,594 --> 01:29:03,860
We are not just helpless children!

1296
01:29:05,096 --> 01:29:06,257
He had a life!

1297
01:29:08,266 --> 01:29:09,529
Do you hear me?

1298
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:12,129
Do... I mean do you hear me?

1299
01:29:14,105 --> 01:29:16,200
What's the matter with you?

1300
01:29:16,274 --> 01:29:17,207
Walter.

1301
01:29:17,275 --> 01:29:18,265
What?

1302
01:29:23,615 --> 01:29:24,947
Let's go.

1303
01:29:30,288 --> 01:29:31,722
Let's go.

1304
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:33,281
There is nothing we can do.

1305
01:29:35,959 --> 01:29:37,291
Let's go, please?

1306
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:02,085
He did nothing wrong.

1307
01:31:23,398 --> 01:31:24,661
Are you okay?

1308
01:31:31,405 --> 01:31:35,175
Walter, I need to go back to Syria.

1309
01:31:35,242 --> 01:31:37,178
I should be there for Tarek.

1310
01:31:38,746 --> 01:31:40,010
When are you going?

1311
01:31:40,081 --> 01:31:41,640
Tomorrow.

1312
01:31:41,715 --> 01:31:44,983
It's best for me to be there
as soon as possible.

1313
01:31:47,087 --> 01:31:49,250
You won't be able to come back.

1314
01:31:51,425 --> 01:31:52,415
I know.

1315
01:31:56,096 --> 01:31:57,121
Good night.

1316
01:32:00,099 --> 01:32:01,089
Mouna?

1317
01:32:03,771 --> 01:32:04,761
I'm sorry.

1318
01:32:05,773 --> 01:32:07,435
I am so sorry.

1319
01:32:18,118 --> 01:32:19,108
Yes?

1320
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:02,887
It's my fault what happened to Tarek.

1321
01:33:05,430 --> 01:33:09,164
We did receive the letter
telling us to leave.

1322
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:13,028
I threw it away.

1323
01:33:15,841 --> 01:33:17,002
I never told him.

1324
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:39,398
We were here for three years
before the letter arrived.

1325
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:43,857
I had found a job.

1326
01:33:46,369 --> 01:33:48,271
Tarek was in school.

1327
01:33:51,374 --> 01:33:54,312
Everybody told me not to worry...

1328
01:33:54,377 --> 01:33:56,404
the government didn't care.

1329
01:33:58,181 --> 01:34:00,048
And it appeared to be true.

1330
01:34:03,053 --> 01:34:04,078
And then...

1331
01:34:05,889 --> 01:34:07,222
after a time...

1332
01:34:08,224 --> 01:34:09,385
you forget.

1333
01:34:13,563 --> 01:34:15,863
You think that you really belong.

1334
01:34:21,405 --> 01:34:22,566
It's not your fault.

1335
01:34:24,908 --> 01:34:26,069
It's not your fault.

1336
01:34:33,582 --> 01:34:34,572
Stop.

1337
01:34:52,101 --> 01:34:55,039
Zainab and I picked it out specially for you.

1338
01:34:55,104 --> 01:34:56,094
Thank you.

1339
01:34:59,942 --> 01:35:02,208
Oh. It's very nice.

1340
01:35:02,277 --> 01:35:03,506
Let me see it.

1341
01:35:10,019 --> 01:35:10,987
I like it.

1342
01:35:11,053 --> 01:35:13,353
- So do I.
- Mmm.

1343
01:35:13,421 --> 01:35:14,389
You look cool.

1344
01:35:14,455 --> 01:35:15,947
Cool?

1345
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:20,450
Yes.

1346
01:35:21,629 --> 01:35:23,622
You're very cool, Walter.

1347
01:35:36,143 --> 01:35:38,136
<i>Delta flight 275</i>

1348
01:35:38,212 --> 01:35:40,945
<i>now boarding at Gate 3 for Syria.</i>

1349
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:46,146
<i>Delta flight 275, Gate 3 for Syria.</i>

1350
01:36:00,667 --> 01:36:02,296
Thank you, Walter.

1351
01:36:03,303 --> 01:36:04,669
Thank you for everything.

1352
01:36:06,006 --> 01:36:08,443
I don't want you to go.

1353
01:36:10,677 --> 01:36:13,007
I don't want to go,
<i>habibti.</i>

1354
01:36:14,347 --> 01:36:15,508
Oh...

1355
