1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,628
He wasn't there again today

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,973
I wish
I wish he'd go away

3
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,108
Where did you learn that?

4
00:00:15,317 --> 00:00:17,650
Where did you learn that poem?

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,187
I made it up.

6
00:00:20,357 --> 00:00:23,793
When I was a kid, I made it up.

7
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:30,597
What else do you remember
from back then?

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,202
Don't beat around the bush, doc.
Don't beat around the bush.

9
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,410
Don't beat around the bush.
Don't beat around the bush, doc!

10
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:50,026
Tell me what you remember
about your mother.

11
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:52,853
I remember my mom.

12
00:00:54,332 --> 00:00:56,198
I remember my mom.

13
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:00,396
I remember my mom was a whore.

14
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:13,356
How long would she keep you there?

15
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:18,590
As long as she was busy.

16
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:35,746
Do you understand
why you're talking with me now?

17
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:37,579
You're supposed to be good with...

18
00:01:38,922 --> 00:01:39,910
...headaches.

19
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:44,660
I need something more than aspirin.
Know what I mean?

20
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:48,857
Do you remember the murders?

21
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:52,796
I remember...

22
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:57,135
...that Columbia is the capital
of South Carolina.

23
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:01,275
I remember that--

24
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,895
Are you the person
who murdered six residents...

25
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:18,559
...of the Lakeworth Apartments
on May 10, 1998?

26
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,575
That's my birthday.

27
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:33,079
Who am I speaking to right now?

28
00:02:35,592 --> 00:02:38,289
What should I call you?

29
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:42,795
Call me whatever you want.

30
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,144
Gary?

31
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:57,046
Gary?

32
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,645
Gary, you awake?

33
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:03,315
Yes, Greg, as a matter of fact,
I am awake.

34
00:03:03,494 --> 00:03:05,291
I'm sorry to bother you at home...

35
00:03:05,463 --> 00:03:08,728
...but there's gonna be a midnight
hearing in the Rivers case.

36
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,804
The defense found a notebook
misfiled in evidence, a diary.

37
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:15,873
They argued to the state Supremes
that it was suppressed.

38
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:18,506
What are you talking about?

39
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:21,979
There's no media.
This all happened under the radar.

40
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,584
The prisoner transport
left an hour ago from Ely.

41
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:27,917
Left Ely? What do you mean?
What transport?

42
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,924
The diary gave them an opening
to argue insanity again.

43
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:34,531
They need Rivers present, so they
drugged him, put him on a transport.

44
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,861
They're taking this scumbag
to a hearing...

45
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:38,867
...the night before his execution.

46
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:41,268
How the fuck did you let that happen?

47
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:48,279
Would anyone like to play
another round?

48
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:52,348
Let's get another puzzle,
Vanna. What do we have?

49
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:54,956
-"Around the House" is the category.
-Buy a vowel.

50
00:03:55,124 --> 00:03:56,956
-Buy a vowel.
-Pick up that trip.

51
00:03:57,661 --> 00:04:01,256
-Buy a vowel, you idiot.
-I'd like to buy a vowel. An E.

52
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,825
One E.

53
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:07,404
-All right, 350 left.
-N.

54
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:10,003
-Buy a vowel.
-Buy another vowel.

55
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:12,078
-Yes!
-An I.

56
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:19,543
-I'd like to solve.
-Sure.

57
00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:21,190
"Kibbles 'n Bits. "

58
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:28,226
She won't stop bleeding.
She won't stop bleeding.

59
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,735
-Jesus. What happened?
-An accident. We had an accident.

60
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,067
Rain and lightning
is moving into Elko.

61
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,677
Doppler Radar has picked up a
severe thunderstorm with lightning...

62
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:41,246
...on its way from Pershing
and Lander counties.

63
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,180
-We could get damaging winds....
-Four times 10 equals--

64
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:45,615
Four times 10--

65
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:49,953
Timothy, could you not do that now?
We're trying to hear about the storm.

66
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:53,760
-Sure you don't want me to drive?
-No.

67
00:04:53,932 --> 00:04:58,666
I'll get us to Anderson,
then you can take over after we eat.

68
00:05:02,242 --> 00:05:04,506
Turn into spin.

69
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:09,015
Apply brakes with short, firm pumps.

70
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:12,779
Check mirror and gauge indicator
and roll...

71
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:16,653
...to a slow, smooth stop.

72
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,920
You okay, honey? Timothy?

73
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,665
Seat belts, seat belts, seat belts.

74
00:05:31,812 --> 00:05:33,474
-It's a shoe.
-What?

75
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:35,946
It's a shoe!

76
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:57,000
For he's a jolly good fellow

77
00:05:57,176 --> 00:06:01,808
For he's a jolly good fellow

78
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:08,446
For he's a jolly good fellow

79
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:16,990
Which nobody can deny

80
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,613
Shit!

81
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:40,396
-Why didn't we get a better spare?
-Do you know what radials cost, Alice?

82
00:06:40,564 --> 00:06:42,122
Honey, don't get defensive.

83
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:45,894
Well, if the point is to put him,
Timothy, into the right school...

84
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,404
-...it's absurd to focus...
-George? George?

85
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,100
-...on replacement tires.
-What can I do to help?

86
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:55,045
Nothing. I'm fine, but...

87
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,576
...thank you.

88
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:29,314
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Alice?

89
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:34,955
Oh, my God! Alice?
What have you done?

90
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:39,665
What have you done?
What have you done?

91
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:45,608
Hi, Harry.
Where do I begin?

92
00:07:45,778 --> 00:07:48,805
I have walked off the set, okay?

93
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:51,145
I know they'll say
that I am in breach...

94
00:07:51,318 --> 00:07:54,254
...but they clearly
did not read my deal.

95
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:56,721
They had me at a Ramada--

96
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,589
Oh, Jesus.

97
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:05,661
I think I have a spare battery
in my bag.

98
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:07,065
Excuse me?

99
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:11,301
I have a spare battery in my bag
up front, next to you.

100
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,940
-Any idea which one, Miss Suzanne?
-The Louis Vuitton duffel, right on top.

101
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:23,089
I don't see anything--

102
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,424
Just use your fucking eyes!
It's in the side pocket! Just look!

103
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:28,860
Jesus!

104
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:40,843
What have you done?
What have you done?

105
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:44,382
No, fool! If you help him,
you assume responsibility.

106
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:47,087
It is my responsibility.
Let go of me.

107
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,890
Alice? Alice?

108
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,255
What have you done?
What have you done?

109
00:08:52,628 --> 00:08:55,189
Let me take a look.

110
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:59,667
The driver of every motor vehicle
involved in any manner of accident...

111
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:03,638
...originating from the operation
of a vehicle shall, within 10 days....

112
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,143
You got a towel or something
in the car?

113
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:09,009
Okay. Come help me look.

114
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,144
--within 10 days of the accident...

115
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,655
...if you are operating a vehicle
and it should, at any time, involve--

116
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:21,093
-Stay here. Keep her dry.
-It's okay. It's okay, honey.

117
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,499
-Open the door! We need the phone.
-No!

118
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,301
Sweetheart, it's okay.

119
00:09:27,472 --> 00:09:29,202
Honey, it's okay.

120
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:35,406
-Give me the goddamn phone!
-The phone is dead, all right?

121
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:40,020
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be okay.

122
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:48,591
No!

123
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,560
-She won't stop bleeding.
-Jesus. What happened?

124
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:15,528
There was an accident.
May I please use your phone?

125
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,761
-Please use your phone?
-Yeah, sure.

126
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:25,340
Shit. I'm not getting a line.
It happens in the rain.

127
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:26,705
The phone doesn't work.

128
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,872
St. Jude's has 24-hour emergency,
30 miles east.

129
00:10:30,885 --> 00:10:32,045
Okay.

130
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:36,250
You sit here, okay?

131
00:10:37,526 --> 00:10:40,587
Keep pressure on the wound.
I'll be back with an ambulance.

132
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,536
What are you doing?

133
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:55,977
Sorry. It's a step down
from the Ramada, but it'll have to do.

134
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:58,141
I am not staying here.
Are you out of your mind?

135
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:03,121
This is my car. You work for me.
Get those bags back in this car now!

136
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:09,723
I understand the bleeding person
has a medical condition, but so do I.

137
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,396
My lung walls have depleted cilia.
If I stay here, I could asphyxiate!

138
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,342
No, please, please, please,
please, please, please.

139
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,916
Please!

140
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:34,627
Hey!

141
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:41,900
Stop. Please, please.

142
00:11:45,378 --> 00:11:48,973
Hi. I'm sorry, my car is stuck.
Can I get a ride?

143
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:50,947
Okay.

144
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:11,066
You know you're going east.

145
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:14,209
Hospital's this way.

146
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:19,649
It's flooded.
I mean, it's a dead end.

147
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:23,424
Yeah, well, if you don't mind,
I gotta try.

148
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:32,525
Okay, that will be $30 cash, please.

149
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,571
Didn't you use to be that actress?

150
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,251
Yes.

151
00:12:46,754 --> 00:12:50,191
-Wow.
-Now, is that a nice room?

152
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:56,730
Because though I am leaving soon,
I still would prefer a nice room.

153
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:00,928
Your nicest...

154
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:04,073
...if that is possible.

155
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:12,044
Eight's very cozy.

156
00:13:21,097 --> 00:13:23,589
I tried to tell you.

157
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:29,635
Hey! Hey, stop!
There's no way through.

158
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,505
There's no way through!
No way through!

159
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,112
-Lou, wake up.
-What?

160
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,306
Cell phone.

161
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,508
-What?
-Do you have a cell phone?

162
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:40,085
Who wants to know?

163
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:43,451
There's been an accident,
a bad one. A lady's hurt.

164
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,527
-We need a cell phone right now.
-Dude, slow down.

165
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:50,155
First, we don't know who you are.
Second, we don't see an accident--

166
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:54,032
Listen to me, dude, I'm having a really
fucked-up, wet, bad fucking day.

167
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:56,673
So if you have a cell phone,
give it to me now!

168
00:13:56,841 --> 00:14:02,280
Dude, we don't have a cell phone,
so could you just let go of me now?!

169
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:06,615
I need you to give me a lift
in the other direction.

170
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:10,383
It's flooded that way too.
It's worse than this.

171
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:14,193
Ginny, pop the trunk.
Let them in.

172
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,457
Let them in.

173
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:36,590
Hey. How you doing?

174
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,064
-Phone still dead?
-Yeah. Where's your Lincoln?

175
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:49,832
Stuck in a run-off two miles down
the road. The other way's fucked too.

176
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,999
The kids gave us a lift.
The girl was stranded.

177
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:54,980
-Is there another way out?
-Is she a hooker?

178
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:56,776
Hey! Is there a back road?

179
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:59,475
Where do you think the water's going?
You wouldn't get 500 feet.

180
00:14:59,653 --> 00:15:03,283
-How's the woman?
-I don't know. They're in number 4.

181
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:21,546
I'm sorry. We don't rent rooms
by the hour.

182
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:26,716
Funny. You still serving food?

183
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:30,949
Vending machines are around
the corner. Go ahead.

184
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:35,564
Rooms are 30 bucks in advance with
picture ID. You need one room or two?

185
00:15:35,732 --> 00:15:39,328
Excuse me. I was talking to you.
I'd appreciate it if you looked at me.

186
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:42,595
Well, I don't like looking at trash.

187
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:54,478
We're a little stuck here, George.
I don't think we can get out tonight.

188
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:59,389
-She just keeps shaking.
-She's in shock.

189
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:01,962
-Let me take a look.
-What?

190
00:16:02,132 --> 00:16:04,692
Let me take a look.

191
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:23,623
Did your wife pack a sewing kit?

192
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:25,587
No.

193
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:32,232
Ginny, wait up.

194
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:37,867
Six.

195
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:41,138
At least we got a good number.

1
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,429
-Did you feel that?
-Feel what?

2
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:38,265
Cold.

3
00:18:51,918 --> 00:18:53,749
Are you the manager?

4
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,911
Yeah.

5
00:18:56,424 --> 00:19:01,190
I'm Officer Rhodes, Corrections.
I'm transporting a prisoner here.

6
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:04,263
The law gives you the right
to refuse us service...

7
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:06,865
...but the roads are flooded.
I could use a room.

8
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:10,470
-It's an emergency.
-You got a radio in that car?

9
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,764
-Who's this?
-Limo driver, had an accident.

10
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:16,102
I got a lady pretty banged up.
I could use an ambulance.

11
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:19,143
Four-four-two requesting medical.

12
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:22,008
Four-four-two requesting medical.

13
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:24,912
Nothing. It's been like this
for the past hour.

14
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:27,519
She's losing a lot of blood.
Got a first aid kit?

15
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:29,052
Band-Aids, that's it.

16
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:31,816
-How about a needle and thread?
-Maybe in the diner.

17
00:19:31,992 --> 00:19:36,520
I'll get it. Locked up.
Stay dry.

18
00:19:36,764 --> 00:19:39,324
I'll be back with your key.
I'll put you in 10.

19
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:42,764
-Okay, thanks.
-What do you got back there?

20
00:19:42,936 --> 00:19:45,064
Prison transfer.

21
00:19:45,238 --> 00:19:48,571
Maybe when you get him situated,
come to 4 and look at the lady.

22
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:51,974
-I could use a second opinion.
-Yeah, sure.

23
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,685
Looks like you're fucked.

24
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:04,818
Shut up!

25
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:21,469
-I wish I had beige.
-This is fine.

26
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:24,008
Would have been better.

27
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:26,976
I gotta get the officer situated.
Let me know if you need something.

28
00:20:27,147 --> 00:20:29,139
I'll be right back.

29
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:38,153
Where did you learn to do that?

30
00:20:38,592 --> 00:20:41,355
Pretty much where you're standing.

31
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:57,075
Hey, is the...?

32
00:20:57,811 --> 00:21:00,746
The little boy, is he all right?

33
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:03,349
He hasn't said a word
since the accident.

34
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:08,079
No, no, no. He doesn't talk much
ever since the....

35
00:21:10,523 --> 00:21:12,958
I'm his stepfather.

36
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:15,253
His father....

37
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:19,054
Two years ago, he left.

38
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:23,067
Little temper problem.

39
00:21:39,053 --> 00:21:41,078
Watch your step.

40
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:49,594
The furniture's for shit.

41
00:21:49,764 --> 00:21:54,098
If you're fixing to cuff him to
something, the toilet's bolted down.

42
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:56,168
Thank you so much
for your assistance.

43
00:21:56,337 --> 00:21:59,101
-It's a good idea. Come on.
-I got stripes

44
00:21:59,273 --> 00:22:03,676
Stripes around my shoulders
And these chains

45
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:06,142
These chains
They're about to--

46
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:12,014
Let's go look at that lady.

47
00:22:16,323 --> 00:22:18,757
-You get anyone?
-What?

48
00:22:19,193 --> 00:22:22,458
-Did you get through?
-No, not yet.

49
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:30,397
Good stitch job.

50
00:22:33,407 --> 00:22:36,171
Pulse is shallow, but steady.
Keep her comfortable.

51
00:22:36,343 --> 00:22:38,834
We should take turns on the radio,
if that's all right.

52
00:22:39,447 --> 00:22:42,177
No, it's not. I can manage.

53
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:01,359
You gonna arrest me, officer?

54
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:06,873
What?

55
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:11,311
How'd you do that?
How'd you know I was a cop?

56
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:17,181
No shit.

57
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,415
Cheetos for dinner, huh?

58
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,151
-That don't seem right.
-You got a better idea?

59
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:30,560
I worked mess in the service.
Maybe the diner's open. I could--

60
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:33,723
You got change for a dollar?

61
00:23:34,268 --> 00:23:37,260
I don't know. Let me see.

62
00:23:46,514 --> 00:23:49,005
Here you go.

63
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:52,381
You got a name?

64
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,519
-Paris.
-Paris, huh?

65
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,987
I'll get it.

66
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,355
Never been.

67
00:24:00,528 --> 00:24:03,692
Well, you ain't going tonight.

68
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:16,075
Please.

69
00:24:16,244 --> 00:24:18,974
Please be strong.

70
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:23,413
You see, Timothy and I...

71
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:25,951
...we need you.

72
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:29,217
We need you so much.

73
00:25:28,116 --> 00:25:29,879
Lou?

74
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,445
Lou?

75
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,584
You need to tell them, Harry,
that I can't work, I can't perform...

76
00:26:08,757 --> 00:26:11,624
...I can't shine living
in an environment like that.

77
00:26:11,793 --> 00:26:16,230
No, it is not about the money.
It's about the working conditions.

78
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:49,796
One bar.

79
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:52,332
One bar.

80
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:53,694
No bar.

81
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:56,227
One bar.

82
00:26:56,404 --> 00:26:57,564
Two bars.

83
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:01,840
Come on. Come on.

84
00:27:02,478 --> 00:27:04,240
Here we go.

85
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:09,447
There you go. Come on.

86
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:15,881
Goddamn desert wasteland!

87
00:27:23,798 --> 00:27:27,791
Oh, shit! I just had it.

88
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:12,322
Holy fuck.

89
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:45,722
-Jesus, Mother of God.
-Who is this?

90
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:49,159
The woman I was driving.

91
00:31:52,067 --> 00:31:55,264
-What the hell are you doing?
-There's something in there.

92
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:57,530
-Use this, man.
-Thanks.

93
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,904
-Are you a cop?
-I was.

94
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:11,950
-She was in Room 10?
-I am.

95
00:32:13,656 --> 00:32:17,683
-Where's your guy?
-Cuffed to a toilet.

96
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,897
Son of a bitch.

97
00:32:31,206 --> 00:32:33,606
That was a fucking drive.

98
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:40,783
-Gentlemen.
-Your Honor.

99
00:32:47,157 --> 00:32:50,854
Ready, Sharon? Alrighty.

100
00:32:51,027 --> 00:32:54,462
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada,
for the purposes of--

101
00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:00,227
Judge Taylor, sir, with due respect,
we should wait till my client arrives.

102
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:04,663
-He has a right to be present.
-He has precious few rights.

103
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:06,740
He's 24 hours from execution.

104
00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:10,835
But to demonstrate his
mental state, which is the purpose--

105
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:13,078
His mental state?

106
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,412
His mental state?

107
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:19,945
Do you know what time it is?
You think I got time for bullshit?

108
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,717
That the justices called me in the
middle of the night to review a case...

109
00:33:23,893 --> 00:33:28,330
...I already sat on, that I already
decided, may make you happy.

110
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:30,556
But it pisses me off.

111
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,702
When your boy gets here, do what you
want, but in the name of decency...

112
00:33:34,871 --> 00:33:37,431
...state your goddamn case!

113
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:41,401
Yes, sir.

114
00:33:41,578 --> 00:33:43,603
Somebody get me
a cup of coffee, black.

115
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:53,415
All right, everybody! Listen up!

116
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,017
There was an incident tonight.

117
00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:58,285
That's police talk for,
"Someone's head got lopped off."

118
00:33:58,461 --> 00:33:59,860
Larry!

119
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:04,257
-Caroline Suzanne was murdered.
-What?

120
00:34:04,434 --> 00:34:08,165
-Who's Caroline Suzanne?
-The actress I was driving.

121
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,569
And where exactly did that happen?

122
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,972
We don't know, because
we can't find the body.

123
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,611
Not all of it anyway.

124
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,843
-What do you mean, you can't find it?
-Stay calm. Everything will be all right.

125
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,954
Officer Rhodes is outside.
He was transporting a convict.

126
00:34:26,122 --> 00:34:28,682
-Who escaped.
-What are you--?

127
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:31,691
-Hold on.
-Running free!

128
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,295
Will you shut the fuck
up so he can talk?

129
00:34:34,464 --> 00:34:37,433
This is my place, ho!
I'll say what I please!

130
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,227
-It's safe here.
-It is not safe here!

131
00:34:39,402 --> 00:34:41,302
-There's a cop here.
-Yeah, two cops.

132
00:34:41,471 --> 00:34:43,132
Wait. You're a cop?

133
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:48,868
-I was. Shut up, Larry!
-It's not safe here! I'm not staying--

134
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:51,973
It's all right. It's okay.

135
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,677
Nothing.

136
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:59,083
-Is she okay?
-Ginny.

137
00:34:59,355 --> 00:35:03,519
Ginny, will you...?
Stop it. Don't do this right now.

138
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:07,260
-What are you doing?
-Put your arm around your girlfriend.

139
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,491
-Actually, she's my wife.
-Everybody just stay here.

140
00:35:11,668 --> 00:35:14,728
-Stay in this room.
-Wait! I'm not staying here if he is.

141
00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:16,528
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

142
00:35:16,706 --> 00:35:20,233
-I'm not.
-All right. Larry?

143
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,843
-Come with us.
-Why?

144
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:25,012
-You know the place.
-Here's what I know. I'm not a cop.

145
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:27,776
I don't take orders from
a professional slut!

146
00:35:28,117 --> 00:35:31,110
-Fuck you!
-Listen. Just stay here, please.

147
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:32,948
Keep everybody calm.

148
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:44,625
He's not gonna get too far.
Not in this!

149
00:35:46,402 --> 00:35:48,393
Rhodes!

150
00:35:48,705 --> 00:35:50,264
What are we chasing here?

151
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:55,941
Multiple homicide.

152
00:35:56,346 --> 00:35:59,782
I'll go around this way.
Meet you in back.

153
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:16,055
Is that where you live
full-time? Las Vegas?

154
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:20,466
-Used to.
-What's that supposed to mean?

155
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:25,435
It means I don't live there anymore.

156
00:37:02,112 --> 00:37:03,374
Maine!

157
00:37:04,915 --> 00:37:08,612
We'll go see if we can use this one.
We'll go in here.

158
00:37:08,786 --> 00:37:12,312
Since that wasn't a successful
attempt, we'll go in here.

159
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:17,151
I'll be right out here. It's okay.
I'm gonna stand guard.

160
00:37:17,394 --> 00:37:22,229
Not a worry. I'll be right here.
I'm not going anywhere.

161
00:37:29,106 --> 00:37:33,337
See, his mother usually does this.

162
00:37:54,298 --> 00:37:59,167
Hey, Ginny. So how long
you two been married?

163
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:03,238
About nine hours. It was
a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

164
00:38:03,874 --> 00:38:05,569
Viva Las Vegas, huh, Gin?

165
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:09,205
-We need to leave!
-I was just talking to her.

166
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,008
Something's happening!
I need to get out of here!

167
00:38:12,182 --> 00:38:17,415
-Ginny! Ginny!
-You don't own me, Lou!

168
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:19,885
I own what's inside you!
Half, at least.

169
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:22,991
You don't own any part
of me or my baby!

170
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,957
Then why did I marry you?

171
00:38:25,562 --> 00:38:30,124
-Don't slam the goddamn door on me!
-Hey! Hey!

172
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,791
You guys, just calm down!

173
00:38:39,076 --> 00:38:43,445
We are not leaving.
There is no place else to go.

174
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:47,641
There's a flood outside,
Ginny. Stop it! Stop it!

175
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:50,685
I'm not pregnant!

176
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:57,191
What did you just say?

177
00:38:59,997 --> 00:39:02,329
I lied.

178
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:05,729
I'm not pregnant.

179
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:12,035
What are you talking about?
I saw the test.

180
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:18,739
Why would you do that to me?

181
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:23,952
Because Alison saw you at
The Hawk with that fucking girl!

182
00:39:28,626 --> 00:39:32,288
-Ginny, what are we, like 15?
-Go away!

183
00:39:33,697 --> 00:39:36,029
Goddamn!

184
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:58,384
-Open this goddamn door, Ginny!
-No!

185
00:39:58,555 --> 00:40:01,388
I haven't been to The Hawk
in over a fucking year.

186
00:40:01,558 --> 00:40:07,326
Alison is a stupid bitch-whore,
who likes fucking with your head.

187
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:09,796
Open the damn door, Ginny.

188
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,833
-Open the fucking door!
-Not until you calm down!

189
00:40:14,204 --> 00:40:18,072
I'm calm! I am very fucking calm!

190
00:40:27,752 --> 00:40:30,220
What are you doing?

191
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,055
Lou?

192
00:40:50,341 --> 00:40:54,573
Ginny, open this damn door!
Open the door!

193
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,876
-Open the door!
-Stop it, stop it!

194
00:40:59,017 --> 00:41:03,511
Ginny, damn it, open the door!
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny!

195
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:06,121
Lou, please stop!

196
00:41:44,028 --> 00:41:46,428
Lou?

197
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:32,008
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

198
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:34,974
Help me! Somebody help me!

199
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:45,387
Help me!

200
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:49,215
Help me! Somebody help me!

201
00:42:49,627 --> 00:42:53,290
Is he in there? Is he in there?

202
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:58,460
Ginny, are you okay?
What happened? What happened?

203
00:43:05,176 --> 00:43:08,202
-Oh, shit.
-Jesus Christ.

204
00:43:16,587 --> 00:43:19,647
Lou? Lou?

205
00:43:20,793 --> 00:43:22,886
What's going on?

206
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,976
What the hell?

207
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:52,014
Oh, shit!

208
00:44:54,252 --> 00:44:56,413
Come here!

209
00:45:11,068 --> 00:45:14,937
They caught him. They caught him.

210
00:45:23,081 --> 00:45:25,481
Why are we keeping him in here?

211
00:45:26,284 --> 00:45:29,448
-Where would you prefer, Larry?
-I don't know.

212
00:45:29,721 --> 00:45:32,349
I told you to stay in 3, didn't I?
Did I tell you that?

213
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:37,290
They got in a fight! I tried to
get them to go back inside!

214
00:45:37,462 --> 00:45:40,227
Should we try the radio again?

215
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:44,332
Larry, just stay here and watch him.

216
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:48,030
-Go back and look after Ginny.
-Where are you going?

217
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:51,034
Just do it, please.

218
00:45:51,944 --> 00:45:53,172
Ed?

219
00:45:56,949 --> 00:45:59,577
I don't know if I'm comfortable
with guard duty, per se.

220
00:46:00,252 --> 00:46:03,415
He's unconscious, Larry.
He's tied to a post.

221
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:28,879
Timothy.

222
00:46:31,783 --> 00:46:33,842
Timothy.

223
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:45,594
Alice? Oh, my God. Alice?

224
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:49,298
I don't remember anything.

225
00:46:50,035 --> 00:46:52,595
We had an accident.

226
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:56,064
George? Can you keep
an eye on Ginny for a minute?

227
00:46:56,375 --> 00:47:02,575
She's awake now. I have
to get some aspirin to help her.

228
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:07,079
Darling, I gotta go get
something out of my room.

229
00:47:23,835 --> 00:47:26,633
-Shit!
-What's wrong, buddy?

230
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:29,103
What do you got in the fridge?

231
00:47:30,008 --> 00:47:32,704
-You shut up.
-What's in there?

232
00:47:35,148 --> 00:47:37,775
What's in there?

233
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,918
-What do you got in there?
-Shut up.

234
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,150
What is it, huh?

235
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:44,084
-Shut up.
-You can tell me.

236
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:48,486
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I got a whopper myself.

237
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,471
What are you doing?

238
00:48:09,915 --> 00:48:11,109
Motherfucker!

239
00:48:11,283 --> 00:48:15,117
-What are you doing out here?
-Getting shit that's mine.

240
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:18,916
What are you doing?
What, I don't get to ask a question?

241
00:48:19,091 --> 00:48:22,492
I'm taking photos. There's been two
murders. Before all the evidence--

242
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:26,791
That's not an answer. You're a limo
driver. What are you doing?

243
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:30,901
Looking to win some "beyond the call
of duty," limo-driver merit badge?

244
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:34,368
You're not on the job anymore.
You don't need to be a hero.

245
00:48:34,539 --> 00:48:36,906
There's a real, live,
active-duty cop outside--

246
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:39,873
The one who's managed to lose
a convicted killer?

247
00:48:42,447 --> 00:48:44,211
You're a complicated cat, Edward.

248
00:48:45,351 --> 00:48:47,751
No. Not really.

249
00:48:48,154 --> 00:48:50,418
I think so.

250
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:55,092
What month were you born?

251
00:48:55,627 --> 00:48:58,528
-May.
-Taurus.

252
00:48:59,598 --> 00:49:01,395
Same as me.

253
00:49:04,703 --> 00:49:08,366
-Where were you a cop?
-Los Angeles.

254
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:12,070
Were you fired or did you quit?

255
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:14,742
I took medical leave.

256
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,044
It was making me sick.

257
00:49:19,252 --> 00:49:22,482
I burned out, I guess.
Wasn't up for it.

258
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:28,821
One day I got a call...

259
00:49:31,197 --> 00:49:33,529
...for a jumper.

260
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,667
A young Mexican girl.

261
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:41,662
Pregnant, infected with AIDS,
totally strung-out.

262
00:49:42,274 --> 00:49:45,835
She was truly one of the doomed.

263
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:52,783
I asked her to come in off
the ledge and into my arms.

264
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:56,377
She asked me why
she should bother living.

265
00:50:02,795 --> 00:50:05,093
What did you say?

266
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,963
I was trained
to tell her lots of things.

1
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,299
Her dreams, all the people
who'd miss her.

2
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:17,074
But for a second, I hesitated.

3
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:20,270
And she saw it.

4
00:50:23,483 --> 00:50:28,980
Within that second, I couldn't think of
one optimistic thing to say to her.

5
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:35,960
So she spread her arms
and jumped.

6
00:50:41,173 --> 00:50:43,472
I started getting headaches...

7
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,944
...and eventually started blacking out.

8
00:50:50,185 --> 00:50:54,555
So I filed for medical.

9
00:51:10,411 --> 00:51:12,540
What?

10
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:16,613
What is it?

11
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:22,755
Rhodes!

12
00:51:22,927 --> 00:51:28,026
-It's worse. Nothing but static!
-Where's that key from the actress?

13
00:51:29,502 --> 00:51:31,801
This was on the kid.

14
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:36,239
-What is it, some kind of countdown?
-Larry!

15
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:42,377
What the fuck is he doing?
Larry, come over here!

16
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,821
Come over here, man.
What are you doing? Come over here.

17
00:51:48,227 --> 00:51:51,321
-What are you doing?
-I just went to get something.

18
00:51:52,266 --> 00:51:55,963
We told you to watch the guy.
What are you doing in your office?

19
00:51:56,772 --> 00:51:58,239
I just went to get something.

20
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:02,139
How many sets of keys are there
to this place? Look at me. How many?

21
00:52:02,312 --> 00:52:04,746
-Two and a master set.
-Oh, my fucking God!

22
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:11,990
Larry, you mother--! You son of a--!
Get the fuck in here! Get in here!

23
00:52:14,027 --> 00:52:16,621
Why did you kill him?
Why did you kill my con?

24
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:21,702
Holy shit! Who did that?
Jesus Christ, I didn't do that!

25
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:23,464
Bullshit! You're lying!

26
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,542
-It's your bat sticking out of his throat!
-I know, but I didn't do it!

27
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,442
Check the doors!

28
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:31,242
-I didn't do it!
-Look at him!

29
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:34,648
-Why'd you kill him?
-Why were you outside?

30
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,846
-Why'd you leave him?
-I was scared.

31
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:39,254
-What were you scared of?
-You wouldn't understand.

32
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:40,893
Try me.

33
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:42,825
-Why'd you kill my con?
-I didn't!

34
00:52:42,998 --> 00:52:46,902
I don't know how--
I went to my office, that's all!

35
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:49,732
-Why'd you leave him?
-This your key? Number 8?

36
00:52:49,907 --> 00:52:52,536
Ten, nine, eight, huh?
This is your key!

37
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,679
You can't say that!
Those aren't my keys!

38
00:52:54,847 --> 00:52:57,816
That's like leading the witness
or something. Look.

39
00:52:57,984 --> 00:53:01,682
These are my keys, okay?
These are my keys. You see?

40
00:53:03,224 --> 00:53:05,591
You got a Gucci wallet?
It's the actress's.

41
00:53:05,761 --> 00:53:10,166
Yes, I took her wallet.
Afterwards. After she died!

42
00:53:10,334 --> 00:53:15,739
Afterwards, all right? I didn't kill her.
And I didn't kill him.

43
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:20,676
-Let her go, Larry.
-Get back! You won't pin this on me.

44
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:22,873
-Timothy?
-Get him out of here!

45
00:53:23,051 --> 00:53:26,418
-Put it down.
-I didn't hurt anybody. No one!

46
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:29,957
But I don't like cheap fucking whores!
If you take one more step--

47
00:53:30,126 --> 00:53:32,458
Fuck!

48
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:42,608
Get it off!

49
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:47,574
Shit!

50
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:58,324
Come on, you little bitch.
Please fucking start.

51
00:53:58,897 --> 00:54:01,628
-Goddamn it!
-Hey!

52
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:04,833
Larry, stop!

53
00:54:08,075 --> 00:54:09,440
What is going on?

54
00:54:10,011 --> 00:54:12,310
-Larry!
-Get out of my way, I didn't do shit!

55
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,314
Timothy! Timothy!

56
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,217
An insanity plea was
refused by the court...

57
00:54:43,387 --> 00:54:47,883
...despite the fact that my client
is a certifiable Axis IV dissociative.

58
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:52,726
To this day, he remains unaware of
the crimes for which he was convicted.

59
00:54:52,901 --> 00:54:58,703
In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled
decisively that states cannot execute...

60
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:02,107
...a person who does not understand
why he's being put to death.

61
00:55:02,278 --> 00:55:03,576
He signed a confession.

62
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:07,276
-He didn't just sign it, he dictated it.
-Thirdly...

63
00:55:07,452 --> 00:55:12,949
...Malcolm's diaries found
misfiled in state evidence.

64
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:18,087
Your Honor, this notebook contains
entries made just before the murders.

65
00:55:18,265 --> 00:55:22,601
Important to note are the spectacular
changes in handwriting style...

66
00:55:22,772 --> 00:55:24,535
...tone, point of view.

67
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:29,544
What you are looking at are the private
thoughts of several different people.

68
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:33,482
With permission,
Dr. Mallick will elaborate.

69
00:55:33,652 --> 00:55:36,121
Thank you.

70
00:55:36,423 --> 00:55:40,156
Your Honor, there is no
universally efficacious treatment...

71
00:55:40,328 --> 00:55:43,162
...for Dissociative Identity Disorder.

72
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:47,600
In theory, one attempts to move
the patient towards integration.

73
00:55:47,772 --> 00:55:52,369
-A folding of their fractured psyche.
-Your Honor?

74
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:54,244
He's here.

75
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:14,332
No! What you saw was an accident!

76
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:16,667
He ran out in front of me!
I'm not a murderer!

77
00:56:16,842 --> 00:56:18,902
There's a dead body
in your freezer, Larry.

78
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,605
-I didn't kill him. I found him like that.
-Stop it!

79
00:56:21,782 --> 00:56:25,275
Listen! Listen! I was in Vegas last
month and I lost everything, okay?

80
00:56:25,453 --> 00:56:26,682
Everything!

81
00:56:26,855 --> 00:56:30,485
I drove west. I didn't know where
to go, but I was running on empty...

82
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,095
...so I pulled in here at this place.

83
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:37,598
And there was no one at the station,
so I came over to the office...

84
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,567
...and I walked in.

85
00:56:39,738 --> 00:56:42,605
And there, sitting at that desk
right there, was the manager...

86
00:56:42,776 --> 00:56:45,439
...facedown in a Banquet Potpie.
Dead!

87
00:56:45,613 --> 00:56:48,913
-Heart attack or something.
-Banquet Potpie!

88
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:51,645
He'd been sitting there
for God knows how long.

89
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,849
All of a sudden, this auto-parts
salesman pulls up, looking for a room.

90
00:56:56,025 --> 00:56:58,291
I didn't have a fucking dime...

91
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:01,057
...so I took his 30 and gave him one.

92
00:57:01,234 --> 00:57:05,535
I just took the key from the wall
and gave him a room.

93
00:57:05,706 --> 00:57:10,007
Maybe that was wrong,
but I was broke, and that's what I did.

94
00:57:11,045 --> 00:57:13,071
Then I came back in here...

95
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:17,245
...and I moved Larry's body--
His name was Larry too.

96
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,050
I put him in the freezer.

97
00:57:23,663 --> 00:57:26,393
I wasn't trying to hide him.
It was hot out.

98
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:31,163
I thought it was the best place for him
till his family or someone came along.

99
00:57:31,338 --> 00:57:33,864
Only no one did...

100
00:57:34,342 --> 00:57:37,073
...except more guests.

101
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,148
So I checked them in too.

102
00:57:41,052 --> 00:57:43,543
And they all seemed happy...

103
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:46,384
...so I just stayed.

104
00:57:47,426 --> 00:57:50,591
Cry me a river.
This is a total crock of shit!

105
00:57:50,764 --> 00:57:53,199
-No, it's not!
-Admit it, you killed him!

106
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:56,132
Just like you killed my con.
Just like you killed her husband.

107
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:58,934
Just like you killed his actress.
Just admit it.

108
00:57:59,107 --> 00:58:02,806
-Say it, "I killed them."
-Stop it! He can't take any more!

109
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,542
Everything is okay now. Everything
is fine. We got the guy. It's fine.

110
00:58:06,718 --> 00:58:08,448
-I don't know what we got.
-What?

111
00:58:08,621 --> 00:58:11,089
We thought we got the guy
two hours ago, then--

112
00:58:11,257 --> 00:58:13,624
You believe this shit?
It's him! It's this guy!

113
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:15,922
He had a knife to your neck,
remember?

114
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:20,262
His story's so unbelievable,
I think it just might be true.

115
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,469
She's got a point.

116
00:58:25,509 --> 00:58:27,670
You guys are crazy.

117
00:58:27,878 --> 00:58:30,109
Maybe it's the burial ground.

118
00:58:31,984 --> 00:58:33,178
What?

119
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:39,020
Read the brochure in there.
It's all around us.

120
00:58:39,194 --> 00:58:42,289
A hundred years ago, the government
moved these Indians here.

121
00:58:42,464 --> 00:58:45,697
They all died
because there was no water.

122
00:58:47,772 --> 00:58:50,171
Now they're coming back to life
like sea monkeys, huh?

123
00:58:50,341 --> 00:58:52,310
Come on.
Give me a break, sweetheart.

124
00:58:52,477 --> 00:58:54,810
-Just take it easy, Rhodes.
-You know, you take it easy!

125
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,678
You've tried to run this show all night.
Giving orders, pointing fingers!

126
00:58:58,852 --> 00:59:01,845
You blamed my con for everything,
and he ends up dead.

127
00:59:02,023 --> 00:59:05,050
I'm telling you, it's him!
We all saw him run down George.

128
00:59:05,228 --> 00:59:08,686
Your actress's wallet is right there.
She's dead, there's the wallet.

129
00:59:08,865 --> 00:59:11,733
-What more do you want?
-Stop it! Please shut up!

130
00:59:12,804 --> 00:59:15,932
All right. You want a plan?
Here's the plan, okay?

131
00:59:16,108 --> 00:59:20,341
No one's gonna move. We'll stay
here, like this, in this room until dawn.

132
00:59:20,514 --> 00:59:22,675
No one leaves, no one moves.

133
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,820
And if he tries anything,
I'm gonna shoot him!

134
00:59:25,988 --> 00:59:29,185
And if something out there
comes in here, I'll shoot it!

135
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,261
And if anyone of us tries anything,
I'll shoot them!

136
00:59:32,429 --> 00:59:33,897
-We get it.
-Good!

137
01:00:07,742 --> 01:00:10,211
Timmy? Timmy?

138
01:00:10,379 --> 01:00:13,576
-You need to stay in here with us.
-It's all right.

139
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:23,590
Remember that movie where
the 10 strangers went to an island...

140
01:00:23,763 --> 01:00:26,164
...and then they all died
one by one...

141
01:00:26,333 --> 01:00:30,703
...and then it turned out they weren't
strangers, they all had a connection?

142
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:33,103
They all messed with the wrong guy,
and he was getting revenge.

143
01:00:33,274 --> 01:00:34,674
Shut up!

144
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:39,473
I'm just saying maybe there's
a connection between all of us.

145
01:00:39,917 --> 01:00:41,248
Like what?

146
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:44,846
-We're all in Nevada.
-Shut up!

147
01:00:47,527 --> 01:00:50,725
Where were you going with your con
when you pulled in here?

148
01:00:52,499 --> 01:00:55,936
Carson City. Okay?

149
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:01,502
I was going home to Florida.
Where were you going?

150
01:01:01,678 --> 01:01:03,543
I was taking the actress to L.A.

151
01:01:03,915 --> 01:01:05,440
I was born in Florida.

152
01:01:06,552 --> 01:01:09,282
Since you been in that chair,
no one's died, so shut up!

153
01:01:09,456 --> 01:01:10,889
No one's died since we've
all been here!

154
01:01:11,057 --> 01:01:14,050
-Hey, sweetie, sit down.
-Where in Florida, Larry?

155
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:19,633
-Where in Florida?
-Friends now, huh? Great.

156
01:01:20,903 --> 01:01:24,237
-Polk County.
-That's where I was born.

157
01:01:24,408 --> 01:01:26,740
-Which town?
-Mulberry.

158
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:30,177
-Frostproof.
-No wonder you left.

159
01:01:30,516 --> 01:01:32,609
There's a town called Frostproof?

160
01:01:32,986 --> 01:01:36,923
They grow oranges.
The name doubles as a slogan.

161
01:01:37,091 --> 01:01:40,858
I danced hallelujah the day I left Polk.
Why would you wanna go back?

162
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:43,999
I found a grove for sale
on the Internet.

163
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:47,501
Nine acres, 1200 trees.
Limes and oranges.

164
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:51,834
According to the realtor, the soil
needs a few tills, phosphorous...

165
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:58,418
...lanes need reading,
but it's real good land.

166
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,289
What?

167
01:02:04,927 --> 01:02:06,953
It sounds nice.

168
01:02:27,557 --> 01:02:28,751
Ed?

169
01:02:32,263 --> 01:02:34,492
She's dead.

170
01:02:54,058 --> 01:02:56,526
Get him out of here.

171
01:02:57,362 --> 01:03:00,331
Come on.
Come on, sweetie.

172
01:03:07,108 --> 01:03:09,509
Look at this.

173
01:03:14,951 --> 01:03:18,388
-Where'd you get that?
-Right here.

174
01:03:22,628 --> 01:03:26,896
This doesn't make any sense.
She died from an accident.

175
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:31,528
George was an accident,
if you believe Larry.

176
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,911
Where is seven?

177
01:03:39,617 --> 01:03:41,608
Back it up!

178
01:04:17,832 --> 01:04:22,533
-See, I told you it wasn't me!
-That's not possible.

179
01:04:22,706 --> 01:04:26,804
I was standing right there. I saw what
happened. We all saw what happened.

180
01:04:26,977 --> 01:04:30,506
He ran out. Nobody could have
known he was gonna do that.

181
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:31,980
No one human.

182
01:04:32,151 --> 01:04:34,620
We're back to that again?
It's the spirits, huh?

183
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:38,850
Maybe it's the ghost of the guy
that Larry put in the freezer.

184
01:04:40,795 --> 01:04:42,730
Somebody untie me.
Goddamn it!

185
01:04:42,898 --> 01:04:44,594
You know it wasn't me.
Come on.

186
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:44,901
-Listen.
-We gotta get out--

187
01:04:44,901 --> 01:04:46,698
-Listen.
-We gotta get out--

188
01:04:46,871 --> 01:04:49,101
Take her car and get out.
You, her and the kid.

189
01:04:49,273 --> 01:04:50,501
There's nowhere to go.

190
01:04:50,676 --> 01:04:52,702
-How much gas do you have?
-Half a tank.

191
01:04:52,878 --> 01:04:54,972
You can drive till dawn on that.
Look at me.

192
01:04:55,148 --> 01:04:57,811
When you get to where it's flooded,
go the other way.

193
01:04:57,985 --> 01:04:59,350
I don't know if I can.

194
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:02,649
Get the kid and go.
Right now. Come on.

195
01:05:02,824 --> 01:05:03,814
Timmy.

196
01:05:03,992 --> 01:05:06,621
Timmy, come on. Let's go.
Get up.

197
01:05:06,796 --> 01:05:07,956
What's going on?

198
01:05:08,132 --> 01:05:09,861
-They can't leave!
-This way.

199
01:05:10,033 --> 01:05:12,002
We'll see you
when the storm breaks.

200
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:15,504
Hey! Hey! They can't leave!
Where are they going? Get back here!

201
01:05:15,674 --> 01:05:17,266
Go, go, go!
They're leaving.

202
01:05:17,444 --> 01:05:18,809
-They're not leaving.
-Go!

203
01:05:18,979 --> 01:05:21,710
You can't let suspects leave
after four people have been killed!

204
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:24,819
-You really think they're suspects?
-They're not leaving!

205
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:33,086
Shit.

206
01:05:33,598 --> 01:05:35,463
Ginny!

207
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:40,201
Extinguishers.
Larry, you got a fire extinguisher?

208
01:05:40,674 --> 01:05:43,040
-Fire extinguisher! Where?
-Back there!

209
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,107
Nobody in there.

210
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:16,475
Maybe it got so hot,
they got cremated.

211
01:06:16,654 --> 01:06:18,713
There'd be something left.

212
01:06:22,995 --> 01:06:24,361
You did this.

213
01:06:24,998 --> 01:06:28,162
You did this!
You told them to get into the car!

214
01:06:28,336 --> 01:06:29,803
Are you happy?

215
01:06:53,935 --> 01:06:56,097
Where is he?

216
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:57,744
Nothing.

1
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,133
I give up!

2
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:09,835
I give up!
What the hell do you want?

3
01:08:10,011 --> 01:08:14,348
What do you want, you sick bastard?
What the fuck do you want from us?

4
01:08:15,953 --> 01:08:19,722
I am turning 30 next week
and I just want to go home...

5
01:08:19,893 --> 01:08:21,623
...and grow oranges!

6
01:08:28,507 --> 01:08:31,239
It's your birthday next week?

7
01:08:31,412 --> 01:08:34,315
It's my birthday next week.
The 10th.

8
01:08:35,886 --> 01:08:37,184
Me too.

9
01:08:41,362 --> 01:08:42,796
Me too.

10
01:08:45,601 --> 01:08:47,366
Yeah.

11
01:08:49,675 --> 01:08:52,201
George York, May 10.

12
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,315
Alice York, May 10.

13
01:08:54,483 --> 01:08:56,315
Caroline Suzanne, May 10.

14
01:08:57,355 --> 01:08:59,917
Ginny and Lou Isiana, May 10.

15
01:09:00,093 --> 01:09:02,494
Me, Larry Washington,
May fucking 10.

16
01:09:03,565 --> 01:09:06,365
What are the odds?
Must be 10 trillion-to-one.

17
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,236
What is it?

18
01:09:25,534 --> 01:09:28,129
-Where's the fuse box, Larry?
-Other side of the building.

19
01:09:35,283 --> 01:09:37,309
Ginny and Lou Isiana.

20
01:09:37,921 --> 01:09:40,720
Virginia and Louisiana.

21
01:09:40,893 --> 01:09:43,089
Caroline, Carolina.

22
01:09:44,965 --> 01:09:46,958
Paris Nevada.

23
01:09:47,136 --> 01:09:48,764
George York.

24
01:09:49,741 --> 01:09:52,176
Larry Washington.

25
01:09:54,381 --> 01:09:57,318
Rhodes, Rhode Island.

26
01:10:02,895 --> 01:10:05,456
Ed Dakota.

27
01:10:19,589 --> 01:10:24,053
When I was going up the stairs
I met a man who wasn't there

28
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:26,598
He wasn't there again today

29
01:10:26,768 --> 01:10:28,634
I wish
I wish he'd go away

30
01:10:30,406 --> 01:10:32,467
Who is this?

31
01:10:32,644 --> 01:10:35,615
Who am I speaking to right now?

32
01:10:38,354 --> 01:10:40,585
Where did you learn that poem?

33
01:10:40,757 --> 01:10:43,159
Who am I speaking to?
Look at me.

34
01:10:43,328 --> 01:10:45,593
Who am I speaking to right now?

35
01:10:52,209 --> 01:10:53,438
Doc?

36
01:10:56,651 --> 01:10:58,916
-Edward?
-What's happening?

37
01:10:59,254 --> 01:11:01,917
-Please be quiet.
-He can hear what we're saying?

38
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:04,627
Of course I can hear
what you're fucking saying.

39
01:11:04,797 --> 01:11:09,863
Edward, you missed your last
appointment. Where have you been?

40
01:11:12,042 --> 01:11:15,343
-Did I black out again?
-Try and think back.

41
01:11:15,515 --> 01:11:17,983
Where have you been?

42
01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:20,816
All right.
I was driving this actress...

43
01:11:21,324 --> 01:11:26,459
...and we got stuck at the motel.
There was a storm.

44
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,064
We couldn't get out
because of the storm.

45
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:32,401
What happened at the motel?

46
01:11:35,247 --> 01:11:37,979
People started dying.

47
01:11:38,151 --> 01:11:41,178
And then their bodies--
It didn't make any sense.

48
01:11:41,357 --> 01:11:43,087
They disappeared.

49
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:48,294
Edward, I'd like to show
something to you, if I may.

50
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,045
Do you recognize this man?

51
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:59,385
No.

52
01:12:00,021 --> 01:12:02,856
That man, Edward,
is Malcolm Rivers.

53
01:12:03,026 --> 01:12:06,623
He's had a very troubled life.
He was arrested four years ago...

54
01:12:06,798 --> 01:12:10,167
...and convicted of the murder
of six people in a violent rampage.

55
01:12:10,638 --> 01:12:12,869
-He did this.
-Detective, please.

56
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:14,670
Edward, listen to me.

57
01:12:15,078 --> 01:12:20,987
When faced with an intense trauma,
a child's mind may fracture...

58
01:12:21,155 --> 01:12:24,718
...creating disassociated identities.

59
01:12:25,529 --> 01:12:28,967
That's exactly what happened
to Malcolm Rivers.

60
01:12:29,134 --> 01:12:31,536
He developed a condition
that is commonly known...

61
01:12:31,706 --> 01:12:34,609
...as Multiple Personality Syndrome.

62
01:12:39,852 --> 01:12:41,787
Why are you telling me this?

63
01:12:43,057 --> 01:12:45,323
Because you, Edward...

64
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:48,625
...are one of his personalities.

65
01:12:53,108 --> 01:12:54,736
What?

66
01:13:09,334 --> 01:13:12,601
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
did you do to my face?

67
01:13:12,773 --> 01:13:14,469
-Keep calm.
-Where is my face?

68
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:17,136
-That is your face.
-Why am I tied up?

69
01:13:17,313 --> 01:13:18,906
-Keep calm.
-Where is--?

70
01:13:19,084 --> 01:13:20,608
-Please.
-Jesus Christ!

71
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:22,948
-Where is my face?
-Stay calm.

72
01:13:23,123 --> 01:13:26,822
No! I'm not gonna stay calm!
Why am I tied up like this?

73
01:13:26,997 --> 01:13:30,456
Who are all these people?
What happened at the motel?

74
01:13:30,635 --> 01:13:33,663
-Where is everybody?
-They don't exist, Edward.

75
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:36,436
You were all created
by Malcolm as a child.

76
01:13:36,611 --> 01:13:39,013
-You're a liar!
-Consider what you know.

77
01:13:39,184 --> 01:13:41,551
-Everyone named after a state.
-No.

78
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,180
Everyone sharing the same birthday.
Your blackouts.

79
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:46,827
No! I was a cop!

80
01:13:46,995 --> 01:13:50,728
I was a cop in the Rampart Division
of L.A.P.D. for six years.

81
01:13:50,902 --> 01:13:51,927
Edward, please.

82
01:13:52,103 --> 01:13:54,505
I live in Hollywood,
in a studio apartment.

83
01:13:54,675 --> 01:13:57,043
-You don't live there.
-I do live there!

84
01:13:57,313 --> 01:13:59,077
You don't live anywhere.

85
01:13:59,416 --> 01:14:03,480
I know this is difficult to accept,
but the face you saw in that mirror...

86
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:08,961
...is the face I've always seen when
I talk to Edward or Paris or Larry...

87
01:14:09,131 --> 01:14:11,066
...or anyone else you've met tonight.

88
01:14:11,236 --> 01:14:15,174
Malcolm is in the midst
of a medical treatment.

89
01:14:15,342 --> 01:14:20,909
One which forces all his identities to
confront one another for the first time.

90
01:14:21,085 --> 01:14:23,612
I knew there would be violence...

91
01:14:23,788 --> 01:14:29,025
...and with it, the number
of the identities would be reduced.

92
01:14:31,369 --> 01:14:33,269
Reduced?

93
01:14:33,438 --> 01:14:36,238
One of the personalities
you've met tonight, Edward...

94
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:39,312
...committed those murders
four years ago.

95
01:14:39,682 --> 01:14:43,451
He took control of Malcolm's body,
as you have now...

96
01:14:43,622 --> 01:14:48,824
...and released an unspeakable rage.
And in 19 hours...

97
01:14:48,997 --> 01:14:52,560
...Malcolm Rivers will be put to death
because of those actions...

98
01:14:52,736 --> 01:14:56,607
...unless I can convince that man...

99
01:14:56,777 --> 01:14:59,178
...that the killer is gone.

100
01:15:02,452 --> 01:15:04,888
I need you to stay with me.
Edward?

101
01:15:05,057 --> 01:15:08,358
I need your help.
I need your help to finish this.

102
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:10,694
Edward, listen to me.

103
01:15:11,935 --> 01:15:13,630
Edward, stay with me.

104
01:15:13,805 --> 01:15:16,674
Listen to me.
I need you to understand.

105
01:15:16,843 --> 01:15:20,008
The killer cannot survive.

106
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,445
Edward!

107
01:15:48,662 --> 01:15:50,187
Got it?

108
01:15:51,265 --> 01:15:54,829
I can't see a thing.
Is there a flashlight?

109
01:15:55,005 --> 01:15:56,633
Hang on. Hang on.

110
01:15:57,142 --> 01:16:00,876
-You got a flashlight?
-Yeah, yeah, it's dead. Goddamn it.

111
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:47,156
Shut up!

112
01:16:53,267 --> 01:16:56,067
Hey. What am I
supposed to wear, man?

113
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:58,037
You're in it.

114
01:17:09,928 --> 01:17:10,917
Larry.

115
01:17:12,698 --> 01:17:15,100
Larry, come here.

116
01:17:21,547 --> 01:17:23,106
Ed!

117
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:33,465
Ed!

118
01:17:47,723 --> 01:17:49,692
Larry!

119
01:17:54,701 --> 01:17:57,604
-Larry!
-Paris.

120
01:17:58,608 --> 01:17:59,734
Paris.

121
01:18:02,614 --> 01:18:04,413
Larry?

122
01:18:07,556 --> 01:18:10,459
Larry? Larry?

123
01:18:13,566 --> 01:18:16,298
Where are the keys to the truck?

124
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:18,598
Where are the keys to the truck?

125
01:18:22,748 --> 01:18:25,913
-That was good, Larry.
-We gotta get out of here.

126
01:18:26,086 --> 01:18:29,114
-Ed has the keys to the truck.
-I got a spare right here.

127
01:18:29,292 --> 01:18:32,262
-Where is he?
-I don't know. Here.

128
01:18:33,264 --> 01:18:36,201
-What are you doing?
-We need a gun.

129
01:18:37,304 --> 01:18:38,397
Holy shit!

130
01:18:41,912 --> 01:18:43,847
Give me the keys to the truck.

131
01:19:43,914 --> 01:19:45,609
Ed!

132
01:19:45,784 --> 01:19:47,685
We gotta get out of here!

133
01:19:47,853 --> 01:19:50,152
-Paris--
-He's coming. He's--

134
01:19:50,323 --> 01:19:52,657
-Stay here.
-What's wrong with you?

135
01:19:52,828 --> 01:19:55,560
Paris, listen to me.

136
01:19:55,733 --> 01:19:58,135
Stay here.

137
01:19:59,338 --> 01:20:01,535
It's gonna be okay.

138
01:20:26,749 --> 01:20:29,744
Throw me the keys to the truck, Ed.

139
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:35,457
Throw me the keys to the truck.
Stay there. Stay there!

140
01:21:08,118 --> 01:21:11,851
Ed! Ed! Ed!

141
01:21:17,132 --> 01:21:19,569
Ed, let me see.

142
01:21:19,737 --> 01:21:21,466
We gotta get you to a hospital.

143
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,735
We're gonna get you
to a hospital, okay?

144
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:26,813
Stay with me because
I'm gonna get you to the truck.

145
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:30,613
Put your arm around my neck.
You gotta hold on, okay?

146
01:21:30,788 --> 01:21:36,458
You with me, Ed? Stay with me.
Okay. One, two, three.

147
01:21:37,533 --> 01:21:41,870
You gotta help me get you up.
Ed, you gotta push a little bit.

148
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:47,180
Ed, why won't you let me help you?

149
01:21:48,684 --> 01:21:50,312
Where did you go before?

150
01:21:50,487 --> 01:21:54,290
What did you see?
Tell me what you saw.

151
01:21:57,266 --> 01:21:59,861
I saw you.

152
01:22:03,775 --> 01:22:07,179
I saw you in an orange grove.

153
01:22:37,064 --> 01:22:39,933
Why won't you let me help you?

154
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:43,438
Where did you go?

155
01:22:43,608 --> 01:22:45,667
What did you see?

156
01:22:49,016 --> 01:22:51,316
I saw you...

157
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:56,391
...in an orange grove.

158
01:23:32,588 --> 01:23:37,893
The question, Your Honor, is whether
to convict the body or the mind.

159
01:23:38,498 --> 01:23:42,095
His body committed these murders,
that is true.

160
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:44,537
The person who remains
inside did not.

161
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:46,266
Judge Taylor, that may not be true--

162
01:23:46,444 --> 01:23:48,937
We witnessed the destruction
of 10 identities tonight.

163
01:23:49,116 --> 01:23:50,879
Nine were innocent
and one was guilty.

164
01:23:51,051 --> 01:23:52,041
They're not real!

165
01:23:52,221 --> 01:23:54,519
The violence that existed in him
has been executed.

166
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:59,357
Your Honor, Malcolm belongs
in a state hospital.

167
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:08,543
In the matter of Rivers v. Nevada, it is
the recommendation of this court...

168
01:24:08,714 --> 01:24:11,377
...that Mr. Rivers' execution
be stayed.

169
01:24:11,552 --> 01:24:15,388
I am transferring Mr. Rivers
to state psychiatric services...

170
01:24:15,792 --> 01:24:18,729
...under the care of Dr. Mallick.

171
01:24:36,757 --> 01:24:39,353
Cracked heels and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn

172
01:24:39,529 --> 01:24:43,832
But it's not that way
I wasn't born to lose you

173
01:24:44,004 --> 01:24:46,302
I want you

174
01:24:46,474 --> 01:24:48,670
I want you

175
01:24:48,844 --> 01:24:53,079
I want you so bad

176
01:26:05,737 --> 01:26:07,500
Timmy.

177
01:26:35,986 --> 01:26:37,751
No, please don't.

178
01:26:39,192 --> 01:26:42,925
No, Timmy, please.

179
01:26:43,098 --> 01:26:45,067
What is it, Malcolm?

180
01:26:53,616 --> 01:26:54,810
Malcolm?

181
01:26:54,984 --> 01:26:57,180
Whores don't get a second chance.

182
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:17,649
When I was going up the stairs

183
01:27:17,821 --> 01:27:21,658
I met a man who wasn't there

184
01:27:21,828 --> 01:27:24,526
He wasn't there again today

185
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:28,433
I wish
I wish he'd go away
