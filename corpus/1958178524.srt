1
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:19,064
(crickets chirping)

2
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:22,397
(soft mysterious music)

3
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,760
- [Sally Voiceover] God, I hate to wait.

4
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,636
I hate it more than those
stupid Girls Gone Crazy

5
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:35,760
commercials that are on late-night TV.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,246
Crazy.

7
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,696
Those girls don't know from crazy.

8
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:41,224
They should be called Girls Got Drunk

9
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:43,898
and Lost Any Fraction of
Dignity and Self-Respect,

10
00:00:43,898 --> 00:00:46,065
not Girls Gone Crazy.

11
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:48,452
If they want crazy, they should come here.

12
00:00:48,452 --> 00:00:50,035
This town is crazy.

13
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:52,825
If you were to pull back the vinyl siding,

14
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:54,312
the dollar-store curtains and the plastic

15
00:00:54,312 --> 00:00:57,462
lawn ornaments in almost half
the houses in Porterville,

16
00:00:57,462 --> 00:01:00,430
you'd find a world of wickedness.

17
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:04,241
But, fuck it, every town
has its dark side, I figure.

18
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:05,933
I was taking care of things just fine

19
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:08,516
on my own, till a few days ago.

20
00:01:11,063 --> 00:01:13,730
(clock ticking)

21
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:18,823
- [Stan] Come on, Vickie, how
much longer are you gonna be?

22
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:20,946
- I'll be done soon, hon, really I will.

23
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:24,008
- All these reports for school,
it's all a buncha bullshit.

24
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:26,725
I never did no reports for
school, and look at me.

25
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:28,171
- Yeah, look at you.

26
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,595
- You know what? Blow me, Bonnie.

27
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:31,580
I have a job, don't I?

28
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,788
- Excuse me, sir.

29
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:35,114
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you

30
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:36,922
to keep your voice down.

31
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:39,255
- Me? They were talking too.

32
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:43,872
- Yeah, if you could keep
it down just a little.

33
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:44,705
Thanks.

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,206
- See what you did not, Bonnie?

35
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,835
You got little Miss Frosted
Flake all pissed off at me.

36
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:52,192
- No problem, shithead.

37
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:54,002
- Fuck this, I'm getting outta here.

38
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:55,686
- Stan, would you shut up?

39
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:57,410
You're gonna get us all kicked outta here.

40
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,147
- You know what? Fuck you
too, you little bookworm.

41
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:01,223
Bye, Vick.

42
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:03,560
- Baby, don't go. I'll
make it worth your while.

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,362
- God, Vickie, you're such a doormat.

44
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:07,728
- I got your doormat right here, Bonnie.

45
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:11,079
- Sir, please be quiet in the library.

46
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:13,748
The other patrons are
trying to concentrate.

47
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:15,190
I'd appreciate it if you didn't make me

48
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,386
come over here again,

49
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,398
or I'm afraid I'll have
to ask you to leave.

50
00:02:18,398 --> 00:02:21,583
- Hey, no problem. I'll keep it down.

51
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,833
I'm very quiet.

52
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:25,439
Frigid little freak.

53
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:29,078
(clock ticking)

54
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:35,713
Listen, I gotta take a piss.

55
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:39,141
When I'm done, I am gone
... with or without you.

56
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:39,974
All right?

57
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:49,253
(Stan grumbling)

58
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:54,641
(soft piano music)

59
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,990
- That boy'll come to
no good. Mark my words.

60
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,361
- Well, I hope not.

61
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:01,513
- Well some folks just ain't
got no couth like us, Sal.

62
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:03,214
- No, I guess not.

63
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:05,435
- Well, see you, hon.

64
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,657
- Have a pleasant afternoon.

65
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:10,193

Ladies and gentlemen, please.

120
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:28,067
Many, many months of
planning have gone into this.

121
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:30,724
Now let us not let petty, petty

122
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,584
differences impede our progress.

123
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:38,501
This opportunity is being handed
to us on a silver platter.

124
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:42,400
- [Sally Voiceover] This
is the thorn in my side,

125
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,428
the turd in my punchbowl,
the piss in my cereal

126
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:48,516
and for now the bane of my very existence.

127
00:06:48,516 --> 00:06:50,349
Harvey Fucking Benton.

128
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:56,951
- Now is the time for
our humble, charming town

129
00:06:56,951 --> 00:07:01,090
to make the proverbial
jump into the 21st century.

130
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,031
Now, let us show a little
respect for our guest.

131
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:05,948
Mr. Benton.

132
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,582
- Thank you, Mr. Mayor, my friends

133
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:12,081
and hopefully my new neighbors.

134
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:14,775
Porterville has incredible
growth potential.

135
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:18,038
Witness what has happened just
in the last six months alone.

136
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,363
Phase One is now complete.

137
00:07:20,363 --> 00:07:23,153
Affordable, low-cost
waterfront condominiums

138
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:25,569
starting in the low 200s,
and sales are better

139
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:27,473
than we ever expected.

140
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:29,247
Phase Two is now underway.

141
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:31,970
We are in the process of
acquiring the Kellerman property,

142
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,165
over 200 acres of nothing
that will contain condos

143
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:37,632
and marinas right up to
the Porterville waterfront.

144
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:39,005
- This is the part I wanna hear.

145
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:42,922
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Phase Three.

146
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:46,383
Benton's Quest.

147
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,675
(gasping)

148
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,581
Four glorious miles of
waterfront property,

149
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:54,170
shopping centers, office
buildings, movie theaters,

150
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,635
restaurants, nightclubs.

151
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:58,800
Porterville will no
longer be that little town

152
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,238
that you pass on the way
to the shopping centers.

153
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:04,018
Porterville will be the place to go.

154
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:06,224
- What's next, casinos, gambling?

155
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,128
- Our taxes will skyrocket.

156
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:09,083
- What about the town?

157
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:11,345
- You'll turn Porterville
into Benton's Ghetto.

158
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:12,839
- Ladies and gentlemen, please.

159
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,627
Don't you want better
opportunities for your children

160
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,482
and for your families to thrive?

161
00:08:16,482 --> 00:08:18,418
- The children? How will this help?

162
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:20,448
- I couldn't afford to
live there. Can you, Mayor?

163
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:22,670
- It'll bring more crime
than we've ever had here.

164
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,920
(coughing)

165
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:31,011
- You all know me.

166
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:34,771
Born in Porterville.

167
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:38,314
Raised here, schooled here.

168
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,852
Make my living here.

169
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:46,974
It was home of my birth pappy
and his pappy before him.

170
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:53,346
You're talking about a
lot of money, Mr. Benton.

171
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:56,983
Money that I don't see
flowing up Main Street

172
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,400
into the people's businesses.

173
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:04,360
Into their pockets, for their families.

174
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,443
For 67 years, I'd get up with the sun

175
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,559
and look outta my window.

176
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,809
And for 67 years, the river greeted me.

177
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:18,575
But if you have your way,

178
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:23,390
a year from now, I'll
get up in the morning

179
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,890
and look out of the window and

180
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:29,936
have this big, ugly, 75-foot-tall

181
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:35,704
silver cock in my face.

182
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:38,654
I hope I won't have to see that.

183
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:41,789
You all know what you have to do.

184
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,843
I said my peace.

185
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:48,773
But if you let Mr. Benton
and the mayor have their way,

186
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:50,715
they'll swallow you up whole

187
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,715
and leave you all in the poor house.

188
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:58,390
A little shaking, a little tenderizing,

189
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,557
and they'll eat you alive.

190
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:03,045
Make up your minds.

191
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:07,528
- I ask you to please
consider my proposal.

192
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:09,517
Give us another chance
to talk after I have

193
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:11,630
the opportunity to speak
to Steve Kellerman.

194
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,189
- Please, call me Steve.

195
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:14,732
- Thanks, Cynthia.

196
00:10:14,732 --> 00:10:15,751
- [Steve] Cynthia.

197
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,755
- Well, have a seat.

198
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:22,243
I must admit, you're a very
hard man to find, Mr. Kellerman.

199
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:24,076
- Well I travel a lot.

200
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:27,918
- (chuckles) I'm sure
you're a very busy man.

201
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,033
Business or pleasure?

202
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,450
- Both, actually.

203
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:34,118
- Mm, must be nice.

204
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:38,035
I can't remember the last
time I left Maryland.

205
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:42,337
- Is that Mr. Benton's offer?

206
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,420
- Yes, it is.

207
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:46,950
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Kellerman.

208
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,191
I'm surprised you came here in person.

209
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,340
Like I said, you're not the
easiest man to get a hold of.

210
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,471
Your attorneys haven't
exactly been very helpful.

211
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:57,554
- Yeah, well.

212
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:00,568
I pay them a lot of money to handle things

213
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:03,567
that I'd rather not handle.

214
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,594
And I own a lot of things that

215
00:11:06,594 --> 00:11:08,809
I don't even know the half of.

216
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:11,076
Like this property, for instance.

217
00:11:11,076 --> 00:11:14,195
- It was willed to you by your
late uncle James Kellerman.

218
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,518
- I know that much. My
people filled me in.

219
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:18,889
- If you're not busy, we could drive

220
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,988
out there now and take a look.

221
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:22,821
- That's why I'm here.

222
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:25,692
- Here you go.

223
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:26,774
- Okay, thank you very much.

224
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:28,246
- [Sally Voiceover] Good old Mr. Gordon.

225
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:31,474
He's like a ray of sunshine
in this shitty little town.

226
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:33,532
He's been like a father to me.

227
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:35,019
I think.

228
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:37,657
Well, as close as I can figure
a father to be like anyway.

229
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:38,748
- Well, hello, Miss Sally.

230
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:40,369
How are you this fine and sunny day?

231
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:42,214
- Hunky dory, Mr. Gordon, and you?

232
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:43,427
- Can't complain.

233
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:44,604
- And even if you did-

234
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,391
- Who would listen?
- Who would listen?

235
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:47,244
- What can I do you for?

236
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:50,076
We're having a big sale
in our gardening section.

237
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,554
- Well that sure sounds
swell, but all I really need

238
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:55,137
is a new handle for our hammer.

239
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,751
- Well I'll be.

240
00:11:57,751 --> 00:12:02,461
You musta really been whacking
the heck outta something.

241
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:04,711
- Let's see what we've got.

242
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,803
- [Harvey] He and Cynthia are together

243
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:14,136
right now, as far as I know.

244
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:18,520
- You think Kellerman'll sell?

245
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,292
- Do you know any good
reason why he wouldn't?

246
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,210
- No.

247
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,201
- Besides, there's not
a straight man alive

248
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,477
who can say no to Cynthia Prescott.

249
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:28,227
- I don't imagine so.

250
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:31,569
- Would you?

251
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,555
- Only if I didn't have
my little blue pill.

252
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:39,338
- Please, if Cynthia couldn't
get you up, no pill could.

253
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:41,784
(laughing)

254
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:45,117
(soft mysterious music)

255
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,802
- Well, here we are.

256
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:52,262
(soft mysterious music)

257
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:14,545
The house obviously needs some work,

258
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,698
but it's still quite a place.

259
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:18,448
- You aren't kidding.

260
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:24,202
(soft mysterious music)

261
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:26,265
Benton wants to tear this down?

262
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,558
- Well Harvey wants to-

263
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,079
(phone ringing)

264
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,496
Hold on a second.

265
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:34,638
Cynthia Prescott.

266
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:35,888
Oh, hi, Harvey.

267
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,974
Yes, I'm showing Mr.
Kellerman the property now.

268
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:43,037
Hang on.

269
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:43,929
It's Harvey Benton.

270
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:46,745
He wants to know what time
you'd like to meet tomorrow.

271
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:48,119
- You call it.

272
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,286
I'm all yours.

273
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,729
- Anytime, Harvey.

274
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,282
Okay, great, one o'clock it is.

275
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:57,558
See you then.

276
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:02,225
- 200 acres, right down to the waterfront.

277
00:14:05,682 --> 00:14:07,499
Any other buildings on the property?

278
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,371
- Just the barns we passed on the way in.

279
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:13,672
I'd give you the grand
tour but it's getting late,

280
00:14:13,672 --> 00:14:14,857
and I'll be honest with you,

281
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:16,797
this place really creeps me out.

282
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:19,774
- Old houses creep you out?

283
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:21,668
- Not old houses.

284
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:22,985
This one.

285
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:26,803
They say that an entire family
was attacked and murdered,

286
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:29,464
right before Christmas,
about 15 years ago.

287
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:32,871
- [Steve] Murdered, in this house?

288
00:14:32,871 --> 00:14:33,704
Swell.

289
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:38,329
- [Cynthia] Legend has it
that there were three escaped

290
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:42,746
lunatics from the mental
hospital right here in town.

291
00:14:44,487 --> 00:14:47,016
They say the men forced their
way into the house and shot

292
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:50,420
the man who lived there
at point-blank range.

293
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,100
He was probably dead
before he hit the ground.

294
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,495
After killing the man, they found his wife

295
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,147
and proceeded to beat and rape her,

296
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:02,397
over and over, so they say.

297
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:05,168
Musta been horrible.

298
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,132
No bodies were found.

299
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:10,869
Who knows what they could
have done with the family?

300
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,856
Some people even say that
the lunatics ate them,

301
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:16,692
because all that was
found where body parts,

302
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:18,859
blood and traces of semen.

303
00:15:20,073 --> 00:15:20,906
- Damn.

304
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:26,860
You said there was a family.

305
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,071
Were there children?

306
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:30,321
- I don't know.

307
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,917
Some say there were.

308
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,433
Others say no.

309
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:37,386
- Jesus.

310
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:41,377
And now I'm the proud owner.

311
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:43,560
Great.

312
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:49,660
- [Cynthia] Well ...
that was a long time ago.

313
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,577
(mysterious music)

314
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:03,806
- [Sally Voiceover] This
is my brother, Ruby.

315
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:05,234
I raised him from a cub,

316
00:16:05,234 --> 00:16:08,294
like the wolves did
Mowgli in The Jungle Book.

317
00:16:08,294 --> 00:16:09,826
I guess he's got some issues,

318
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:12,275
but I don't really know
anyone who doesn't.

319
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,859

Come out, come out wherever you are.

338
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:59,436

339
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:02,665
Duck,

duck,

341
00:18:07,391 --> 00:18:08,224
duck,

342
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:10,116
goose!

343
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:11,991
(screaming)

344
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,313
Tina, there you are.

345
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:16,199
I've been looking for you.

346
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,616
Waiting, waiting.

347
00:18:18,652 --> 00:18:20,919
You never came back.

348
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:21,752
Why, Tina?

349
00:18:22,912 --> 00:18:23,745
- Why?

350
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,597
I don't know what you're talking about.

351
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:30,274
- Don't pretend you don't know.

352
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:31,546
- Please.

353
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:34,882
I have no idea what you're talking about.

354
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:35,715
- No idea?

355
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:37,812
No idea!

356
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,505
(screaming)

357
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:41,298
Is it not true that in June of last year

358
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:44,053
you checked out a book
from the public library?

359
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:46,621
Is it not true that you, Tina Gray,

360
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:49,860
checked out Atkins for Life
by the late Robert C. Atkins?

361
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,562
And is it not true that
since then that book

362
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:54,109
has not been able to be checked out

363
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:59,109
by any other patron of the
Porterville Public Library?

364
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:01,266
(crying)

365
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,004
- Yes, I guess so (cries).

366
00:19:04,004 --> 00:19:06,515
- And why is that, Tina?

367
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:08,015
Why is that, Tina?

368
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:14,319
- Because (cries) I never brought it back.

369
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,416
- That's right, you never did.

370
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,926
And now your fine is in the double digits.

371
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:23,301
But, Tina, you only live four blocks away.

372
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:24,972
I sent notices.

373
00:19:24,972 --> 00:19:26,801
I sent letters.

374
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:30,144
What the fuck is wrong
with you, girly girl?

375
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:32,698
Now, there's a bunch of fucking fat asses

376
00:19:32,698 --> 00:19:34,616
waddling around Porterville,

377
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:36,919
and it's all thanks to your complete

378
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:39,669
and utter lack of responsibility!

379
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,398
(screaming)

380
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:45,203
(chainsaw roaring)

381
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:48,620
(intense dramatic music)

382
00:20:11,856 --> 00:20:14,913
Oh great, now I have to change.

383
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,158
(intense dramatic music)

384
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:21,241
(indistinct singing)

385
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:34,657
♪ Let's go ♪

386
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:37,907
(muffled upbeat music)

387
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:40,955
- I know this place isn't much,

388
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:43,135
but it is the only bar in town.

389
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,962
- I like it.

390
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:48,462
- You are just not at all what I expected.

391
00:20:51,204 --> 00:20:52,525
- What does that mean?

392
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:55,595
- Well, I know the Kellerman name and

393
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:57,380
I know the Kellerman wealth.

394
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,570
- Go ahead.

395
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,403
- Well,

396
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:05,034
I guess I just didn't expect, um.

397
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:05,867
- Bum?

398
00:21:06,957 --> 00:21:08,575
- No, not a bum.

399
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:09,408
Someone so

400
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,271
down to earth.

401
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:16,483
- Down to earth?

402
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,113
That's an interesting way of putting it.

403
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:20,381
- Oh, I'm sorry.

404
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:23,048
I didn't mean to make
you feel uncomfortable.

405
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:23,881
- Nah.

406
00:21:25,002 --> 00:21:25,835
Me?

407
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:28,009
I'm never uncomfortable.

408
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:29,176
- You bastard.

409
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:31,043
Last night you said that--

410
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:34,595
- No no no, last night
was just pillow talk.

411
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:36,154
- You bastard.

412
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:38,291
- You're acting like a
damn child. Just grow up.

413
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,548
- But you used me.

414
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:42,624
- Who used who, babes?

415
00:21:42,624 --> 00:21:44,332
Who used who?

416
00:21:44,332 --> 00:21:45,586
- Man, fuck you.

417
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:48,636
- No no no, see, that was last night.

418
00:21:48,636 --> 00:21:49,877
And to hear you brag about it,

419
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:52,285
you know what, you're not all that.

420
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:54,436
If you were, I mighta
given you another spin.

421
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:57,919
Hear you talk, I expected
sparklers to shoot out your ass.

422
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,862
Make love by the rockets red glare,

423
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:03,316
but you know what, in reality,
you're nothing special.

424
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:06,483
You're just another backseat pit stop.

425
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:14,497
- Welcome to Porterville.

426
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:16,160
- I've had enough
entertainment for one night.

427
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,457
How about you?

428
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:18,781
- You ready to get outta here?

429
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:20,195
- [Steve] Let's roll.

430
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:21,713
- Oh, hey wait.

431
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:23,584
Do you mind if, when we
get back to your room,

432
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:25,413
I can come up and get those papers

433
00:22:25,413 --> 00:22:27,869
that we need for the meeting
with Harvey tomorrow?

434
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:30,592
I can get Pat to make copies.

435
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:31,755
- Sounds like a plan.

436
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:33,224
- Okay.

437
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:35,641
(soft music)

438
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:44,800
(balls colliding)

439
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,217
(soft music)

440
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:51,835
- Hey there, pretty lady.

441
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:53,168
You want a game?

442
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:56,303
- Nope, not into games.

443
00:22:58,886 --> 00:23:01,122
- Pool, babes. I meant pool.

444
00:23:01,122 --> 00:23:03,539
(soft music)

445
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:09,622
- [Sally] Oh, I know what you meant.

446
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,397
- Derrick, babes.

447
00:23:11,397 --> 00:23:13,575
I'm Derrick Bradly.

448
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:16,262
I think you should let me buy you a drink.

449
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,679
- What about your girlfriend?

450
00:23:19,743 --> 00:23:21,904
- Well, I'm already wearing hers,

451
00:23:21,904 --> 00:23:23,984
and she ain't my girlfriend.

452
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:25,651
She's a mental case.

453
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,654
- And how do you know
I'm not a mental case?

454
00:23:29,654 --> 00:23:31,321
- I can tell, babes.

455
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:34,863
You got your shit together.

456
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:38,780
There ain't nothing wrong
with a girl like you.

457
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:49,065
- This is it.

458
00:23:54,895 --> 00:23:55,895
Here we are.

459
00:23:57,508 --> 00:23:59,591
- I just love this place.

460
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:06,882
- Here you go.

461
00:24:06,882 --> 00:24:07,882
- Oh, great.

462
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,045
I'll have Pat get on these
first thing in the morning.

463
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:16,918
- Well, thanks for a very
entertaining evening.

464
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:18,501
Floor show and all.

465
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:21,915
See you tomorrow.

466
00:24:21,915 --> 00:24:23,748
- Yeah, you sure will.

467
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:33,729
- Good night.

468
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:34,562
- Night.

469
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:40,445
(dramatic piano music)

470
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:49,703
(soft moaning)

471
00:24:49,703 --> 00:24:52,870
(soft dramatic music)

472
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:11,590
(seat belt clicking)

473
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,757
(soft dramatic music)

474
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,034
- Are you ready for the fireworks?

475
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:22,015
- Oh yeah, babes, I'm ready.

476
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:22,848
I'm ready.

477
00:25:22,848 --> 00:25:26,015
(soft dramatic music)

478
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:33,512
Oh.

479
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:36,262
(dramatic music)

480
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,550
(groaning)

481
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,550
Oh, oh yeah.

482
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:44,354
- Do you see them yet?

483
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:46,187
The fireworks, I mean.

484
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,789
- Oh, God! Oh my God!

485
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,574
- You know, for all your bragging
you sure aren't all that.

486
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:56,846
If you were even half as good as you said,

487
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,848
I mighta let you live longer.

488
00:25:59,848 --> 00:26:01,730
Hearing you talk, I expected sparklers

489
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,985
to shoot out your ass.

490
00:26:03,985 --> 00:26:06,690
Love by the rockets red glare.

491
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,794
In reality, you're nothing special.

492
00:26:09,794 --> 00:26:12,127
(screaming)

493
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:15,625
(upbeat music)

494
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:20,677
(Derrick crying)

495
00:26:25,502 --> 00:26:28,097
(hard breathing)

496
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:30,680
(upbeat music)

497
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:38,975
(groaning)

498
00:26:38,975 --> 00:26:40,058
- Oh, oh, oh.

499
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:41,999
- [Sally] Just be glad I didn't have

500
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:44,631
any firecrackers, you big baby.

501
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:47,381
(dramatic music)

502
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,241
(engine starting)

503
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:54,824
(violin music)

504
00:27:08,154 --> 00:27:10,708
- [Zeke] Looks like Sally's working late.

505
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,125
- Yep, sure does.

506
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:17,540
Librarians, it's always the quiet ones.

507
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,115
Hey, I ever tell you guys
about the time I dated a mime?

508
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:21,949
- Only about a gazillion times.

509
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:23,743
- You didn't date no mime.

510
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,496
- The hell I didn't.

511
00:27:25,496 --> 00:27:26,596
It was great.

512
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:29,336
She used to do that walking
against the wind shit.

513
00:27:29,336 --> 00:27:30,568
It was fantastic.

514
00:27:30,568 --> 00:27:31,670
She was a very flexible girl.

515
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,703
- I bet she was.

516
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:33,937
- Don't encourage him.

517
00:27:33,937 --> 00:27:35,928
- No, it was awesome, really.

518
00:27:35,928 --> 00:27:38,524
She was double-joined too.

519
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:41,817
She used to do things to blow your mind.

520
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:45,312
She'd get a, tie a knot in a
cherry stem with her tongue.

521
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:47,171
- Pfft, I could do that.

522
00:27:47,171 --> 00:27:49,549
- I'll give you $10 if
you can do that right now.

523
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:50,458
- Hell yeah.

524
00:27:50,458 --> 00:27:53,041
(upbeat music)

525
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:06,989
(muffled music)

526
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:08,406
- Ruby, I'm home.

527
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:13,052
- Well it's about time.
My supper's almost ruined.

528
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:15,002
Did you bring groceries?

529
00:28:15,002 --> 00:28:16,752
Could you get drinks?

530
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:20,917
That blonde lady was back
up at the house again today.

531
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:23,382
You know, the one that
has the pointy titties.

532
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:26,081
Her and some guy that I didn't know.

533
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:28,655
- Shit, why didn't you say something?

534
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:30,278
- I just did.

535
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:31,741
- That's Cynthia Prescott.

536
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:34,191
That bitch is gonna be trouble.

537
00:28:34,191 --> 00:28:35,961
- Right here in River City?

538
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:40,270
- No, Harvey Fucking Benton,
that's what kinda trouble.

539
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,651
He's been building and
building and working his way

540
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:44,982
towards us like a swarm of locusts.

541
00:28:44,982 --> 00:28:47,189
He's about to be knocking
on our front door.

542
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:50,648
Little Miss Barbie Doll
is his calling card.

543
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:52,815
- Well, fuck a furry duck.

544
00:28:54,175 --> 00:28:56,837
- Ruby, don't talk like that.

545
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:58,399
You should never fuck farm animals.

546
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,884
It'll rot your Twinkee off
and make you smell funny.

547
00:29:00,884 --> 00:29:03,217
You don't want that, do you?

548
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,462
Now come on, let's eat.

549
00:29:10,496 --> 00:29:12,606
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

550
00:29:12,606 --> 00:29:16,147
I'll find out more about it tomorrow.

551
00:29:16,147 --> 00:29:18,442
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

552
00:29:18,442 --> 00:29:21,525
You just keep an eye out for Cynthia.

553
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:32,754
Ugh, oh, we better get the
groceries off the porch first.

554
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:44,168
(crickets chirping)

555
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:49,028
- Um, what'd you do with
his, um ... pee pistol?

556
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:53,344
- Oh.

557
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:57,087
- Thanks.

558
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:02,451
(dramatic music on TV)

559
00:30:10,324 --> 00:30:13,342
- I believe it's well hung anyway.

560
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:16,515
For until then, I am Count Gore de Vol.

561
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:17,922
- [Sally Voiceover] I
wonder how many late-night

562
00:30:17,922 --> 00:30:20,565
horror movies we've watched on that couch.

563
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:22,012
I can't even remember the last time

564
00:30:22,012 --> 00:30:24,551
I fell asleep in my own bed.

565
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:28,968
I love Ruby. He's my family,
at least all that's left.

566
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:32,301
But he really needs to bathe more often.

567
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:40,166
(vehicles passing)

568
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,201
- Excuse me, I was wondering
if you could point me

569
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:48,222
in the direction of your town's
newspapers and periodicals.

570
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,555
- Of course, sir, follow me.

571
00:30:51,586 --> 00:30:54,253
(clock ticking)

572
00:30:56,338 --> 00:30:57,338
Here we are.

573
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,917
All these papers are organized by date.

574
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:02,643
If you need a more extensive collection,

575
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:04,951
you'll need to go to our main branch.

576
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:05,784
- Thanks.

577
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:07,667
Excuse me.

578
00:31:10,481 --> 00:31:13,148
You'll pardon me for asking, but

579
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:15,985
are you?

580
00:31:15,985 --> 00:31:16,985
- Am I what?

581
00:31:18,256 --> 00:31:19,423
- Are you, um?

582
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:24,078
Nothing, nothing.

583
00:31:24,078 --> 00:31:25,299
- Very well, sir.

584
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:29,151
Please let me know if I can
be of any more assistance.

585
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:30,385
- Thanks.

586
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:33,052
(clock ticking)

587
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:49,394
(phone ringing)

588
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,598
Hello.

589
00:31:54,598 --> 00:31:55,431
- Sh.

590
00:32:02,232 --> 00:32:04,556
- Okay, I'll see you.

591
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:05,389
Bye-bye.

592
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:18,465
(soft mysterious music)

593
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:26,614
(soft dramatic music and vocalizing)

594
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:34,744
("Hark the Herald Angels Sing")

595
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:03,355
(muffled knocking on door)

596
00:33:03,355 --> 00:33:07,355
("Hark the Herald Angels Sing")

597
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:19,766
(gun firing)

598
00:33:19,766 --> 00:33:22,288
(dramatic music)

599
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:25,205
(muffled shouting)

600
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:29,606
(dramatic music)

601
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:55,501
(chainsaw roaring)

602
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:58,251
(dramatic music)

603
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,875
(hard breathing)

604
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:32,208
(soft mysterious music)

605
00:35:02,812 --> 00:35:05,531
- Daddy, are you all right?

606
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:08,415
- I don't think so, baby.

607
00:35:08,415 --> 00:35:11,226
- [Sally] You killed them, Daddy.

608
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:13,250
- I'm so sorry, baby.

609
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,142
I'm so sorry you had to see that.

610
00:35:16,142 --> 00:35:21,142
- Daddy, you killed them.
Why did they come here, why?

611
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:24,657
- I don't know, baby. I just don't know.

612
00:35:27,222 --> 00:35:30,139
Sometimes ... life just isn't fair.

613
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:36,913
But I had to kill them, baby,
to protect you and Ruby.

614
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:37,746
I had to.

615
00:35:40,942 --> 00:35:42,442
An eye for an eye.

616
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,043
Those were bad men.

617
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,543
- Why, Daddy, why?

618
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:51,117
- I'm so sorry, baby.

619
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,150
If I had,

620
00:35:55,138 --> 00:35:56,108
had just.

621
00:35:56,108 --> 00:35:59,441
(soft mysterious music)

622
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:07,502
Take care of your brother,
like we took care of you.

623
00:36:07,502 --> 00:36:08,335
- Daddy.

624
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,175
- You gotta take care of him.

625
00:36:10,175 --> 00:36:11,008
He can't.

626
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:15,206
- Daddy, don't.

627
00:36:16,113 --> 00:36:16,946
Daddy!

628
00:36:16,946 --> 00:36:19,863
(soft piano music)

629
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:43,753
- Mr. Kellerman, so nice
to finally meet you.

630
00:36:43,753 --> 00:36:45,390
Please, come in and have a seat.

631
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:47,077
Cynthia, please.

632
00:36:47,077 --> 00:36:49,342
- Thanks, Mr. Benton.

633
00:36:49,342 --> 00:36:51,759
I have heard a lot about you.

634
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:55,199
- (chuckles) All good things, I'm sure.

635
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,322
But please, call me Harvey.

636
00:36:57,322 --> 00:36:58,809
All my good friends call me Harvey.

637
00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:00,155
- Thanks.

638
00:37:00,155 --> 00:37:02,768
And please also call me Steve.

639
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:05,824
When I hear Mr. Kellerman,
I start looking for my dad.

640
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,074
(laughing)

641
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:13,663
You look like a man with
something on his mind.

642
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:15,031
- Always.

643
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:17,382
Always something on my mind.

644
00:37:17,382 --> 00:37:20,632
And I bet you can tell me what that is.

645
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,210
- Money.

646
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,175
- Money?

647
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,659
Good answer, one of my favorites, but

648
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:28,159
no, not this time.

649
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,378
I think about the future,

650
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:33,817
and how I can mold that future.

651
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:36,233
That's what I'm about, Steve.

652
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:37,483
What about you?

653
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:41,638
- Well, at the moment,
I'm thinking about how

654
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:44,275
you will grow and mold my future.

655
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:45,325
- I like that.

656
00:37:45,325 --> 00:37:48,025
A straight shooter, right from
the hip, that's a good thing.

657
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:49,294
Hmm.

658
00:37:49,294 --> 00:37:54,294
You know, I'm in the position
to make you a very rich man.

659
00:37:54,553 --> 00:37:57,114
Wealthier than your wildest dreams.

660
00:37:57,114 --> 00:37:59,716
- I don't know, I can dream pretty big.

661
00:37:59,716 --> 00:38:01,801
- I bet you do dream big,
but I am the person who got

662
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,763
those hill jacks to take
their cars off blocks

663
00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:06,233
in their front yards, and I
am the person who got people

664
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:09,464
to go out and do something
other than cash a welfare check.

665
00:38:09,464 --> 00:38:11,340
And I'm the person who
can take this two-bit,

666
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,257
piece-of-shit town, and turn it

667
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,880
into the community that it should be.

668
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,761
That's me, Steve. Now what about you?

669
00:38:18,761 --> 00:38:20,990
- Hell, I wanna move in right now.

670
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,689
Maybe I should hold on to my
land and see what happens.

671
00:38:24,689 --> 00:38:26,386
- Why would you wanna stay here?

672
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:27,969
Aren't there greener pastures for you?

673
00:38:27,969 --> 00:38:29,442
I mean, what are you gonna do,

674
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:31,938
just sit around and
watch those weeds grow?

675
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:32,820
- But you just said.

676
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,073
- But, you know what I said.

677
00:38:35,073 --> 00:38:37,156
And you know what I mean.

678
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:39,912
Mr. Kellerman, Steve,

679
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:45,069
I think we both know why you're here.

680
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:47,181
- Yeah, yeah, we do.

681
00:38:47,181 --> 00:38:50,014
So ... let's get down to business.

682
00:38:50,987 --> 00:38:54,168
- Let's get down to business.

683
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:57,811
You've got 200 acres that
divides Porterville in half,

684
00:38:57,811 --> 00:39:02,144
and I'm the person that can
pull that town together.

685
00:39:04,897 --> 00:39:08,202
I've written down a nice, tidy little sum.

686
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:10,372
I think once you try this on,

687
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:14,556
you're going to see that
it makes a very nice feet.

688
00:39:14,556 --> 00:39:16,973
(soft music)

689
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:21,237
(chuckling)

690
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:26,010
- It's a very big number.

691
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:32,608
Mr. Benton, it was a pleasure to meet you.

692
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:37,282
Cynthia, I'll be in touch.

693
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:38,699
- You're leaving?

694
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:42,978
- I have a lot to think about.

695
00:39:42,978 --> 00:39:45,753
You'll have my answer in 24 hours.

696
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:48,170
(soft music)

697
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:53,213
- 24 hours, my ass.

698
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:55,399
That pinprick little shit,
he's just sitting around

699
00:39:55,399 --> 00:39:57,789
waiting for me to raise my offer.

700
00:39:57,789 --> 00:39:58,779
He thinks he's gonna sit here and wait

701
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:01,837
for my balls to start
sweating, I don't think so.

702
00:40:01,837 --> 00:40:03,796
You better get an
autograph on that contract,

703
00:40:03,796 --> 00:40:06,625
or shit is gonna hit the fan.

704
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,125
Cyn, you do whatever it takes.

705
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:11,782
And I mean whatever.

706
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,400
(crickets chirping)

707
00:40:19,225 --> 00:40:20,157
- Hi.

708
00:40:20,157 --> 00:40:23,866
I was doing some research
on some old articles,

709
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:25,750
and it looks like some things are missing.

710
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,583
- Missing?

711
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,417
That's impossible.

712
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:31,392
- Well you might wanna have
a look because it looks like

713
00:40:31,392 --> 00:40:34,985
somebody's taken the
scissors to your files.

714
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:37,652
(clock ticking)

715
00:40:46,627 --> 00:40:50,193
(soft music and vocalizing)

716
00:40:50,193 --> 00:40:53,127
- Why do some people have
to destroy everything?

717
00:40:53,127 --> 00:40:54,627
I'm so sorry, sir.

718
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,656
- Steve.

719
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:58,502
- Look, if you need any
help with your research,

720
00:40:58,502 --> 00:41:00,200
I'll be happy to do what I can.

721
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,542
It's never very busy in
here on the weekdays, so.

722
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:05,073
- Thanks, that'd be great.

723
00:41:05,073 --> 00:41:07,244
- So, what are you looking for?

724
00:41:07,244 --> 00:41:09,810
- Well have you ever heard of that story

725
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,727
about the old house up on Route 40?

726
00:41:13,797 --> 00:41:16,959
The one where the family was murdered?

727
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:19,317
- Murdered? Oh my God, when?

728
00:41:19,317 --> 00:41:23,937
- Oh no no no no no, this
was like 15 years ago or so.

729
00:41:23,937 --> 00:41:25,705
Three escaped mental patients.

730
00:41:25,705 --> 00:41:27,742
- Yeah, everyone in
Porterville's heard that story,

731
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:30,198
but I don't think it's really true.

732
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:31,678
I mean, I've been living here all my life

733
00:41:31,678 --> 00:41:33,979
and I've never seen any proof of it.

734
00:41:33,979 --> 00:41:35,857
It's just one of those-

735
00:41:35,857 --> 00:41:37,050
- Town stories?

736
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,655
- Exactly.

737
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:41,558
I think you may be chasing a fairy tale.

738
00:41:41,558 --> 00:41:46,412
- Well, maybe so, but ...
somehow it interests me.

739
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:49,432
Would you mind pointing
me in the right direction?

740
00:41:49,432 --> 00:41:50,999
- Sure, I'd be happy to.

741
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:55,234
And if I can't, I'm sure that George can.

742
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:56,651
- Oh, uh, George.

743
00:41:58,003 --> 00:41:58,836
Hey, um.

744
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,323
Is he, um?

745
00:42:05,312 --> 00:42:06,444
You know, is he?

746
00:42:06,444 --> 00:42:10,649
- Oh no, he's just a little
effeminate, that's all.

747
00:42:10,649 --> 00:42:13,316
(clock ticking)

748
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:17,943
(screaming)

749
00:42:17,943 --> 00:42:20,022
(chainsaw roaring)

750
00:42:20,022 --> 00:42:22,355
(screaming)

751
00:42:24,514 --> 00:42:27,264
(dramatic music)

752
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:34,130
- Ruby.

753
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,963
- [Ruby] What?

754
00:42:34,963 --> 00:42:36,635
- She didn't twist her ankle
like that in the movie.

755
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:38,337
You're thinking of the ones with Jason.

756
00:42:38,337 --> 00:42:40,792
- No I'm not. I'm doing
Jamie Lee in Halloween.

757
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,837
(high-pitched squealing)

758
00:42:42,837 --> 00:42:45,531
- Why do you always have
to mix up the movies?

759
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:46,459
- I'm not mixing it up.

760
00:42:46,459 --> 00:42:49,626
I like to add my own artistic license.

761
00:42:50,556 --> 00:42:53,681
Hey, I'm thinking about taking a shower.

762
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:55,526
Do you wanna play Norman?

763
00:42:55,526 --> 00:42:56,981
- Nah.

764
00:42:56,981 --> 00:42:58,599
How about a game of Twister?

765
00:42:58,599 --> 00:42:59,965
- Okay.

766
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:02,691
But wait, all we have
is left hands and feet.

767
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:03,524
- That's okay.

768
00:43:03,524 --> 00:43:05,800
We'll just cut the thumbs
off a couple of rights.

769
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,633
- Okay.

770
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:07,582
- Want me to make some popcorn?

771
00:43:07,582 --> 00:43:08,685
- [Ruby] Sure.

772
00:43:08,685 --> 00:43:10,604
- [Sally Voiceover] Cut the
thumbs off a couple of rights?

773
00:43:10,604 --> 00:43:12,672
That made sense.

774
00:43:12,672 --> 00:43:15,225
Actually, I wouldn't have
minded playing Norman with Ruby,

775
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:18,977
but since he's older,
it's gotten kinda weird.

776
00:43:18,977 --> 00:43:21,644
(clock ticking)

777
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:26,449
- Hey, it's five o'clock. It's
about time for me to lock up.

778
00:43:26,449 --> 00:43:27,282
- Really?

779
00:43:28,135 --> 00:43:29,718
Oh man, time flies.

780
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,192
Thanks for all your help today.

781
00:43:34,192 --> 00:43:35,739
- I don't know how much help I was.

782
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:38,944
I mean, we didn't find anything.

783
00:43:38,944 --> 00:43:42,128
- Good night, Sally, Mr. Kellerman.

784
00:43:42,128 --> 00:43:43,461
- Night, George.

785
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:47,535
- Good night.

786
00:43:50,783 --> 00:43:53,201
(door closing)

787
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:55,118
Anyway, you were great.

788
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:59,311
Hey, let me return the favor.

789
00:43:59,311 --> 00:44:03,110
I saw a little ice cream
shop down the street.

790
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,598
Wanna have some with me?

791
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:06,848
- Uh, sure, that'd be nice.

792
00:44:07,968 --> 00:44:11,286
Let me get my things and I'll
meet you by the front door.

793
00:44:11,286 --> 00:44:13,953
(clock ticking)

794
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:28,121
- Hey, isn't that that rich guy
that owns all that property?

795
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:29,190
- Where?

796
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:31,209
- Right there, with the librarian.

797
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:32,611
- Him?

798
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:33,580
He's rich?

799
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,413
- Yep, worth millions.

800
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:39,451
I saw him yesterday, and
he was driving a hummer.

801
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:41,806
- I got a hummer for him.

802
00:44:41,806 --> 00:44:44,317
What the shit is he doing with her?

803
00:44:44,317 --> 00:44:45,589
My customer.

804
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:46,506
- Geez, ho.

805
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:49,592
- Oh.

806
00:44:49,592 --> 00:44:53,222
I'll have a small chocolate shake.

807
00:44:53,222 --> 00:44:54,777
- A small chocolate shake please,

808
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:57,944
and I'll have a chocolate banana malt.

809
00:44:59,285 --> 00:45:00,149
- A malt?

810
00:45:00,149 --> 00:45:02,239
You mean, a shake?

811
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:04,365
- Yeah, it's a shake with malt in it.

812
00:45:04,365 --> 00:45:06,633
You have malt on the menu.

813
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:08,383
- Yeah, okay, got it.

814
00:45:09,561 --> 00:45:12,742
- You spell malt with an A not an O.

815
00:45:12,742 --> 00:45:15,659
- I think I know how to spell malt.

816
00:45:18,155 --> 00:45:20,581
That's 4.75, good-looking.

817
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:23,831
(muffled upbeat music)

818
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:29,045
Here you go.

819
00:45:29,045 --> 00:45:30,462
- [Steve] Thanks.

820
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,515
- You know, I get off in about an hour,

821
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:40,421
if you wanna buy me some ice cream.

822
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:43,404
- Thanks, but I got plans already.

823
00:45:43,404 --> 00:45:45,105
- Yeah, I see that.

824
00:45:45,105 --> 00:45:48,962
(muffled upbeat music)

825
00:45:48,962 --> 00:45:49,795
- Thanks.

826
00:45:54,204 --> 00:45:55,765
- Why don't you give me a call

827
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:58,265

828
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:01,450

832
00:46:21,367 --> 00:46:24,963
- Well, evening there, Miss Sally.

833
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:26,707
Don't worry about this turd.

834
00:46:26,707 --> 00:46:28,193
He's got priors.

835
00:46:28,193 --> 00:46:31,943
He's probably just off somewhere drunk or

836
00:46:31,943 --> 00:46:33,579
shacked up with a big-tittied pole dancer

837
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:36,507
from the all-night booby bar.

838
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:37,882
I wouldn't worry about him.

839
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:40,060
Actually kinda surprised
he hasn't, you know,

840
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,909
knocked up his sister or nothing yet.

841
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:44,076
Well, evening.

842
00:46:45,037 --> 00:46:46,125
- Evening.

843
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:48,908
- [Sally Voiceover] Now I ask
you, how can you not feel safe

844
00:46:48,908 --> 00:46:52,382
with a crack team like
Zeke and Earl on the job?

845
00:46:52,382 --> 00:46:53,663
I shouldn't complain.

846
00:46:53,663 --> 00:46:55,532
They do make my job easier.

847
00:46:55,532 --> 00:46:57,750
They just need to be pointed
in the right direction

848
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,619
from time to time.

849
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:02,786

850
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:08,080
(birds chirping)

851
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,550
- Do you think Batman was gay?

852
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:16,300
(birds chirping)

853
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:18,448
- [Steve] No.

854
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,188
Bruce Wayne was a millionaire playboy.

855
00:47:24,188 --> 00:47:26,132
What makes you think he's gay?

856
00:47:26,132 --> 00:47:28,324
- [Sally] Well, the Batman
I'm talking about is the one

857
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:31,008
on TV, and he seemed a little gay.

858
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:33,758
(birds chirping)

859
00:47:34,734 --> 00:47:37,946
- [Steve] TV? They had
that foxy Julie Newmar.

860
00:47:37,946 --> 00:47:40,784
- Yeah, but he never
did anything with her.

861
00:47:40,784 --> 00:47:43,269
It was always Robin that he went home to.

862
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:46,032
Thus confirming his love of dick.

863
00:47:46,032 --> 00:47:48,782

864
00:47:49,918 --> 00:47:52,751
- Dick Grayson, his youthful ward?

865
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,346
He was like a ... father figure to him.

866
00:47:58,346 --> 00:48:00,263
- Mm-hm, father figure.

867
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:03,488
- Well it was the '60s.

868
00:48:03,488 --> 00:48:07,129
It's not like you could have
Batman bedding Catwoman.

869
00:48:07,129 --> 00:48:11,509
- Yeah, but two guys in tights
sliding down polls all day,

870
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:14,885
you've gotta admit that it's a bit gay.

871
00:48:14,885 --> 00:48:17,936
- They were superheroes,
charging out of the Bat Cave

872
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:22,049
in the middle of the night
to fight injustice in Gotham.

873
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:25,252
- Yeah, they ran around
tying men up all day long.

874
00:48:25,252 --> 00:48:27,107
Not gay at all.

875
00:48:27,107 --> 00:48:29,357
- They were crime fighters.

876
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:34,225

880
00:48:50,476 --> 00:48:52,290
getting rid of the bad guys?

881

883
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,719
They were heroes, and they
only went after bad guys.

884
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:03,719
- So that makes it okay?

885
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,533

886

Plus, anybody who gets to slide down polls

to fight crime can't be all bad.

888
00:49:12,632 --> 00:49:15,554
- (chuckles) Sliding down polls.

889
00:49:15,554 --> 00:49:16,417
You're right.

890
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:20,386

00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,797
Look, I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

898
00:49:36,797 --> 00:49:40,012
♪ The invisible man ♪

899
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:41,572
- See you tomorrow.

900
00:49:41,572 --> 00:49:43,989
(soft music)

901
00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:51,971
- Well?

902
00:49:52,876 --> 00:49:54,279
- Well what?

903
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:55,112
- Well where were you?

904
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:58,435
God fucking shit, dammit, God dammit.

905
00:49:58,435 --> 00:50:00,396
My dinner was ruined, you poopoo head,

906
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:01,646
and I hate you!

907
00:50:03,288 --> 00:50:06,068
- Look what you're doing
to the goddam wall!

908
00:50:06,068 --> 00:50:07,185
Would you look?

909
00:50:07,185 --> 00:50:09,602
(soft music)

910
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,586
I swear to God, Ruby, if you
don't give me that knife,

911
00:50:18,586 --> 00:50:20,261
I will pull out your tongue by the roots

912
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:22,847
and feed it to the dog.

913
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:26,042
- We don't have a dog. We ate it.

914
00:50:26,042 --> 00:50:31,042
- Well I'll get another one,
and we'll see what happens.

915
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,934
- Sally, don't pull out my tongue.

916
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:36,282
- Give me the knife then.

917
00:50:36,282 --> 00:50:38,259
Okay, that's better.

918
00:50:38,259 --> 00:50:41,452
(knife whooshing)

919
00:50:41,452 --> 00:50:44,674
Did you wanna hear about my night or not?

920
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,685
Well then stop being such a big baby

921
00:50:46,685 --> 00:50:49,685
and come over here and talk with me.

922
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:54,780
I was with Steve.

923
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,947
- Who's Steve?

924
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,150
- Just this guy I met at the library.

925
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,738
- What'd you do?

926
00:51:01,738 --> 00:51:03,090
- Talked.

927
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,325
- Talked?

928
00:51:04,325 --> 00:51:07,210
For all those hours, all you did is talk?

929
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:10,054
- Yep, that's all we did.

930
00:51:10,054 --> 00:51:12,442
And he bought me ice cream.

931
00:51:12,442 --> 00:51:14,550
- [Ruby] Did you bring me any?

932
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:15,851
- No.

933
00:51:15,851 --> 00:51:17,308
How was I supposed to bring you any?

934
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:20,721
It woulda melted by the time I got home.

935
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:23,323
- I wanted ice cream, and
we have hardly anything

936
00:51:23,323 --> 00:51:25,874
to eat in the house at all.

937
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:29,360
- What happened to all
the fudgesicles I bought?

938
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,166
- I ate them.

939
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,218
- You ate them?

940
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:34,635
You ate them all?

941
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:42,058
I thought you said we
didn't have anything to eat.

942
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:45,970
I can't believe you
ate all 10 fudgesicles.

943
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,248
Doesn't matter.

944
00:51:47,248 --> 00:51:48,694
I have to see a girl about some groceries

945
00:51:48,694 --> 00:51:50,521
tomorrow night anyway.

946
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:53,104
(upbeat music)

947
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,047
- There he is.

948
00:52:08,035 --> 00:52:09,285
He's waking up.

949
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:14,906
Don't squirm.

950
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:20,649
That's no way to become a
pretty, pretty princess.

951
00:52:20,649 --> 00:52:22,215
There.

952
00:52:22,215 --> 00:52:25,048
All dressed up and no place to go.

953
00:52:30,726 --> 00:52:33,404
- I sure hope we're not
keeping you from anything.

954
00:52:33,404 --> 00:52:36,438
I know we have plans in about two hours.

955
00:52:36,438 --> 00:52:40,055
See, Count Gore's coming on.
We try to never miss that.

956
00:52:40,055 --> 00:52:42,987
Tonight is a really good one.

957
00:52:42,987 --> 00:52:46,689
- He's showing toolbox murders.
It's one of our favorites.

958
00:52:46,689 --> 00:52:50,475
- So, in honor of tonight's presentation,

959
00:52:50,475 --> 00:52:52,330
we're going to play a little game.

960
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,423
It's called.

961
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:54,590
- Da da da na!

962
00:52:56,433 --> 00:52:59,183
- Toolbox Murders, the Home Game.

963
00:53:01,801 --> 00:53:03,896
So long, Mr. Man.

964
00:53:03,896 --> 00:53:04,729
Stop it.

965
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:07,177
Stop it.

966
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:09,376
Don't be such a baby.

967
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:12,591
You know, I don't know
what your problem is.

968
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:14,116
You've got the easy part.

969
00:53:14,116 --> 00:53:16,367
Just sit there on your fat ass.

970
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:19,014
You know, like you always do.

971
00:53:19,014 --> 00:53:22,009
(muffled screaming)

972
00:53:22,009 --> 00:53:24,106
(dramatic music)

973
00:53:24,106 --> 00:53:27,106
(muffled screaming)

974
00:53:32,685 --> 00:53:35,412
(blade whirring)

975
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:38,412
(muffled screaming)

976
00:53:46,379 --> 00:53:49,449
Now that didn't take very long, did it?

977
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:50,282
- Nope.

978
00:53:51,716 --> 00:53:53,838
Another hour and 53 minutes to go.

979
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:56,588
(muffled crying)

980
00:54:01,852 --> 00:54:04,627
- Now this will really
solve your inchworm problem.

981
00:54:04,627 --> 00:54:06,236
I guarantee you, once they get this,

982
00:54:06,236 --> 00:54:09,894
there won't be one of them
more than half an inch long.

983
00:54:09,894 --> 00:54:10,934
- Hi, Mr. Gordon.

984
00:54:10,934 --> 00:54:11,837
- Hello, my dear.

985
00:54:11,837 --> 00:54:13,078
- And how are you today?

986
00:54:13,078 --> 00:54:14,945
- Well I can't complain,
and even if I did-

987
00:54:14,945 --> 00:54:16,652
- Who would listen?
- Who would listen?

988
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:18,899
- Well I would, Mr. G, you know that.

989
00:54:18,899 --> 00:54:20,153
- I know you would.

990
00:54:20,153 --> 00:54:22,089
So, what can I do you for today, Sally?

991
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:24,007
- I thought I'd take a
look at that gardening sale

992
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:25,798
you were talking about, is it still on?

993
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:28,010
- Sure is, right back in there.

994
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:28,843
- [Sally] Thanks.

995
00:54:28,843 --> 00:54:30,630
- I'll be back to help you in
a moment. Is that okay, hon?

996
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,330
- Okay.
- All right.

997
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,913
(upbeat music)

998
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:08,432
(mysterious music)

999
00:55:21,103 --> 00:55:24,020
(muffled speaking)

1000
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:34,706
- [Sally] Daddy!

1001
00:55:36,058 --> 00:55:37,445
- [Sally Voiceover] So,
we packed up everything

1002
00:55:37,445 --> 00:55:39,255
we could haul in our
wagon and moved it all

1003
00:55:39,255 --> 00:55:41,039
into a trailer someone
had started converting

1004
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:43,514
into a house back in the woods.

1005
00:55:43,514 --> 00:55:46,928
It took a few trips, but we
got everything we needed.

1006
00:55:46,928 --> 00:55:48,440
No one knew we were back there,

1007
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,710
and the trailer was well in
the center of our property.

1008
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:52,333
There wasn't even a road to it.

1009
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:54,265
Just what was left of a path.

1010
00:55:54,265 --> 00:55:57,300
- I guess you do have some
serious gardening to do.

1011
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,436
- Just got some things that need

1012
00:55:58,436 --> 00:56:00,754
clearing away from the house.

1013
00:56:00,754 --> 00:56:03,171
(soft music)

1014
00:56:08,562 --> 00:56:11,145
(upbeat music)

1015
00:56:14,547 --> 00:56:17,214
(muffled music)

1016
00:56:18,699 --> 00:56:20,030
- [Sally] Ruby, I'm going out soon.

1017
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:22,118
How's it going down there?

1018
00:56:22,118 --> 00:56:24,785
(muffled music)

1019
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,923
- Almost done.

1020
00:56:27,923 --> 00:56:30,590
(muffled music)

1021
00:56:34,415 --> 00:56:36,373
Can I go out tonight?

1022
00:56:36,373 --> 00:56:39,858
- No, not tonight, I got
something I gotta do.

1023
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:41,108
- [Ruby] Steve?

1024
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,737
- No, I'm not going to do Steve.

1025
00:56:45,952 --> 00:56:47,535
Not tonight anyway.

1026
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,283
But I am gonna be bringing someone home,

1027
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,966
so make sure it's
presentable down there, okay?

1028
00:56:54,966 --> 00:56:55,799
- I will.

1029
00:56:58,364 --> 00:56:59,664
Bossy butt.

1030
00:56:59,664 --> 00:57:02,737

1031

(knocking on door)

1036
00:58:10,211 --> 00:58:14,961
- I was on my way out to
dinner, and I hate to eat alone.

1076
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:24,526
So, we gonna,

1077
01:04:28,127 --> 01:04:29,748
you gonna tie me up?

1078
01:04:29,748 --> 01:04:32,165
(soft music)

1079
01:04:36,525 --> 01:04:38,275
I've been so naughty.

1080
01:04:40,365 --> 01:04:43,144
What are you gonna do to me?

1081
01:04:43,144 --> 01:04:44,845
Do I need a spanking?

1082
01:04:44,845 --> 01:04:47,262

- How do you spell malt?

1094
01:05:30,995 --> 01:05:32,597
- Malt?

1095
01:05:32,597 --> 01:05:34,122
What?

1096
01:05:34,122 --> 01:05:36,932
- How do you spell malt?

1097
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:37,765
- Um.

1098
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,168
- Do you like being scratched?

1099
01:05:41,168 --> 01:05:42,251
- Scratch me.

1100
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:49,569
(flesh tearing)

1101
01:05:51,168 --> 01:05:54,203

(whimpering)

1105
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:09,500
I wanna go home, let me down.

1106
01:06:10,353 --> 01:06:12,270
- Aw, but you can't go.

1107
01:06:14,032 --> 01:06:16,157
Not before dessert.

1108
01:06:16,157 --> 01:06:18,074
Not on pity fuck night!

1109
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,043
(upbeat dance music)

1110
01:06:34,298 --> 01:06:37,048

01:06:38,379 --> 01:06:41,462
(upbeat dance music)

1112
01:07:12,186 --> 01:07:14,921
- Late night last night?

1113
01:07:14,921 --> 01:07:17,289
- Yes, I'm sorry it was.

1114
01:07:17,289 --> 01:07:18,789
How are you today?

1115
01:07:20,219 --> 01:07:21,561
- Fine.

1116
01:07:21,561 --> 01:07:22,394
Fine.

1117
01:07:23,843 --> 01:07:25,295
Could I get a cup of that?

1118
01:07:25,295 --> 01:07:27,249
- Sure, hang on, I'll get you some.

1119
01:07:27,249 --> 01:07:28,868
What do you take in it?

1120
01:07:28,868 --> 01:07:30,133
- Cream and sugar.

1121
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,966
- More research today?

1122
01:07:33,348 --> 01:07:35,015
- Yeah, well, maybe.

1123
01:07:36,624 --> 01:07:38,507
I don't know.

1124
01:07:38,507 --> 01:07:41,927
It has been a very strange few days.

1125
01:07:41,927 --> 01:07:42,760
- That's funny.

1126
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,296
I didn't think much of anything strange

1127
01:07:44,296 --> 01:07:45,671
happened in Porterville.

1128
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:48,422
- Huh, well there is more strangeness here

1129
01:07:48,422 --> 01:07:50,982
than you may be aware of.

1130
01:07:50,982 --> 01:07:54,053
You just might be the most
normal person in this town.

1131
01:07:54,053 --> 01:07:55,303
- That's funny.

1132
01:07:56,357 --> 01:07:58,524
- Here's what I don't get.

1133
01:07:59,728 --> 01:08:04,317
Why is Harvey Benton so
interested in that land?

1134
01:08:04,317 --> 01:08:07,400
Check that, I mean, I know why he is.

1135
01:08:08,325 --> 01:08:11,099
Why is he so obsessed with it?

1136
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:13,799
The price he offered me is three times

1137
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:16,054
what it's really worth.

1138
01:08:16,054 --> 01:08:18,346
What is he planning to do with that land?

1139
01:08:18,346 --> 01:08:19,179
- Land?

1140
01:08:20,144 --> 01:08:21,897
What land are you talking about?

1141
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:23,972
The farm you've been researching?

1142
01:08:23,972 --> 01:08:24,805
- Yeah.

1143
01:08:24,805 --> 01:08:26,388
That's my property.

1144
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:30,368
I thought you knew that.

1145
01:08:30,368 --> 01:08:32,285
- No, I guess I didn't.

1146
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:35,553
How could I have been so stupid?

1147
01:08:35,553 --> 01:08:37,001
- What does that mean?

1148
01:08:37,001 --> 01:08:38,470
- Nothing.

1149
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:41,803
So what do you think you're going to do?

1150
01:08:42,676 --> 01:08:43,926
- I don't know.

1151
01:08:44,992 --> 01:08:46,361
I'm tempted to just sell him the land

1152
01:08:46,361 --> 01:08:48,861
and get the hell out of Dodge.

1153
01:08:49,743 --> 01:08:51,811
What about you?

1154
01:08:51,811 --> 01:08:53,513
You live here.

1155
01:08:53,513 --> 01:08:54,744
Do you wanna see the land developed?

1156
01:08:54,744 --> 01:08:59,075
(door opening and closing)

1157
01:08:59,075 --> 01:09:01,171
- Hey there, stranger.

1158
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:02,754
- Hey. How are you?

1159
01:09:04,262 --> 01:09:05,345
- Great, you?

1160
01:09:08,157 --> 01:09:10,232
- Fine, slept like a baby.

1161
01:09:10,232 --> 01:09:12,029
- I could tell.

1162
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:14,467
Glad I could help (chuckles).

1163
01:09:14,467 --> 01:09:16,571
So, are you free for lunch today?

1164
01:09:16,571 --> 01:09:18,829
- Yeah, sure, what time?

1165
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:22,069
- Why don't you come up to
my office, say, noonish?

1166
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:22,902
- Okay.

1167
01:09:24,032 --> 01:09:25,081
I'll see you then.

1168
01:09:25,081 --> 01:09:25,914
- Great.

1169
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,214
Until then.

1170
01:09:30,214 --> 01:09:34,039
(soft dramatic music)

1171
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:36,775
- So, I didn't know if
you'd want this or not,

1172
01:09:36,775 --> 01:09:38,120
but over in the main branch I had them

1173
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,816
pull some articles for
you on the property.

1174
01:09:40,816 --> 01:09:42,415
You know, if you're still interested.

1175
01:09:42,415 --> 01:09:43,748
- Oh yeah, I am.

1176
01:09:45,158 --> 01:09:47,240
Oh, that's great.

1177
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,407
(soft dramatic music)

1178
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:58,727
- I told them you'd be up
tomorrow afternoon sometime,

1179
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:01,670
so they said they'd have the
articles ready for you by then.

1180
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:03,866
- That's perfect. Thanks so much.

1181
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,478
- Sure, it was nothing.

1182
01:10:05,478 --> 01:10:07,340
Oh, and while you're
here, I'll get a printout

1183
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:10,493
of a map so you can find
the library tomorrow.

1184
01:10:10,493 --> 01:10:12,220
- Thanks again.

1185
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:15,174
- George, do you mind kind
of watching things out here?

1186
01:10:15,174 --> 01:10:17,755
I need to make a private
phone call in the back.

1187
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,962
- Oh sure, take your time.

1188
01:10:19,962 --> 01:10:20,795
- Thanks.

1189
01:10:20,795 --> 01:10:22,198
- No problem, hon.

1190
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:24,865
(clock ticking)

1191
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:32,440
- Oh my goodness.

1192
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:34,284
- I have a delivery
here for Miss Prescott.

1193
01:10:34,284 --> 01:10:35,635
- I'll take those.

1194
01:10:35,635 --> 01:10:38,218
(bright music)

1195
01:10:39,263 --> 01:10:40,096
Here you go.

1196
01:10:40,096 --> 01:10:44,107
- [Delivery Man] Thanks
a lot, have a nice day.

1197
01:10:44,107 --> 01:10:47,107
- [Pat] Cynthia, guess what you got.

1198
01:10:49,532 --> 01:10:51,125
- Who are they from?

1199
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:53,798
- I don't know. Here's the card.

1200
01:10:53,798 --> 01:10:56,381
(bright music)

1201
01:11:05,313 --> 01:11:06,146
- Hm.

1202
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:10,043
- Steve?

1203
01:11:13,543 --> 01:11:14,376
Hello?

1204
01:11:15,961 --> 01:11:17,044
Anybody home?

1205
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:24,821
Hello?

1206
01:11:25,904 --> 01:11:26,737
Steve?

1207
01:11:31,385 --> 01:11:34,386
(soft mysterious music)

1208
01:11:34,386 --> 01:11:35,219
Hello?

1209
01:11:41,474 --> 01:11:42,895
(gasping)

1210
01:11:42,895 --> 01:11:44,982
Sally? What are you doing here?

1211
01:11:44,982 --> 01:11:47,329
- Well, waiting for you, of course.

1212
01:11:47,329 --> 01:11:48,831
- Waiting for me.

1213
01:11:48,831 --> 01:11:51,269
Why, did we have an appointment?

1214
01:11:51,269 --> 01:11:52,783
- Sort of.

1215
01:11:52,783 --> 01:11:55,726
I just have some loose
ends that need tying up.

1216
01:11:55,726 --> 01:11:56,912
- What are you talking about?

1217
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,257
- Didn't you get the flowers?

1218
01:11:58,257 --> 01:11:59,528
- Flowers?

1219
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:01,883
- Yes, the flowers I sent.

1220
01:12:01,883 --> 01:12:05,878
Oh, did you think they came from Steve?

1221
01:12:05,878 --> 01:12:07,914
- You sent those?

1222
01:12:07,914 --> 01:12:11,414
- I guess I shoulda signed
the card Sally instead of S.

1223
01:12:11,414 --> 01:12:12,839
- Look, you little bitch.

1224
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:14,161
You have no right to be here.

1225
01:12:14,161 --> 01:12:16,263
You have no right to lead me
here under false pretenses.

1226
01:12:16,263 --> 01:12:19,123
And you have no right to even
look at a rich man like Steve.

1227
01:12:19,123 --> 01:12:22,496
He can buy and sell you
and your whole damn family.

1228
01:12:22,496 --> 01:12:26,663
He may give you a quick
twirl around the dance floor

1229
01:12:26,663 --> 01:12:28,802
and a couple bounces on the mattress,

1230
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:31,204
but as soon as he throws
you the towel, it's over.

1231
01:12:31,204 --> 01:12:33,509
You know it, and I know it.

1232
01:12:33,509 --> 01:12:37,279
So take my advice and fuck
off before I call the cops.

1233
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:40,367
- Oh, Cynthia, I don't
think you'll turn me in.

1234
01:12:40,367 --> 01:12:42,950
- Oh yeah. Who's gonna stop me?

1235
01:12:44,766 --> 01:12:46,199
(chainsaw roaring)

1236
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:48,415
(screaming)

1237
01:12:48,415 --> 01:12:51,331
(chainsaw roaring)

1238
01:12:51,331 --> 01:12:54,664
(upbeat dramatic music)

1239
01:13:05,527 --> 01:13:07,736
(groaning)

1240
01:13:07,736 --> 01:13:11,069
(upbeat dramatic music)

1241
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:18,055
(whimpering)

1242
01:13:18,055 --> 01:13:20,805
(dramatic music)

1243
01:13:33,673 --> 01:13:36,226
(screaming)

1244
01:13:36,226 --> 01:13:38,087
- [Pat] Hello, hello?

1245
01:13:38,087 --> 01:13:39,645
Cynthia, this isn't funny.

1246
01:13:39,645 --> 01:13:41,741
Somebody please pick up the phone.

1247
01:13:41,741 --> 01:13:42,732
Can you hear me?

1248
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:45,155
Please pick up the
phone. This isn't funny.

1249
01:13:45,155 --> 01:13:45,988
Hello?

1250
01:13:48,284 --> 01:13:51,860
(chainsaw idling)

1251
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,274
- Excuse me. Excuse me, Miss.

1252
01:13:54,274 --> 01:13:55,495
Do you know anything about this cable

1253
01:13:55,495 --> 01:13:57,630
running back into the woods?

1254
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:58,642
Is there a house back there?

1255
01:13:58,642 --> 01:13:59,960
Because if it is, that's
a federal offense.

1256
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,050
Somebody's been stealing cable.

1257
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:02,515
Holy shit, what happened to you?

1258
01:14:02,515 --> 01:14:05,432
(chainsaw buzzing)

1259
01:14:06,844 --> 01:14:08,427
- Send me the bill.

1260
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,927
(phone ringing)

1261
01:14:17,132 --> 01:14:18,081
- Yes, Cynthia.

1262
01:14:18,081 --> 01:14:18,955
- Oh, hello.

1263
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:21,147
No, Mr. Benton, this is Pat, Pat Hingle,

1264
01:14:21,147 --> 01:14:23,924
Cynthia's personal assistant.

1265
01:14:23,924 --> 01:14:26,384
- Yes, Pat, what can I do for you?

1266
01:14:26,384 --> 01:14:28,608
- Well Cynthia has asked me
to call you and let you know

1267
01:14:28,608 --> 01:14:31,233
that Mr. Kellerman is
ready to close the deal,

1268
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:34,065
and he will be at his
farmhouse at seven PM.

1269
01:14:34,065 --> 01:14:36,738
And she would like to
know if you can make it.

1270
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,411
- Yes, that's great news.
Thank you very much.

1271
01:14:39,411 --> 01:14:41,551
And definitely tell
Cynthia that I'll be there.

1272
01:14:41,551 --> 01:14:43,718
- Okay, fine, bye-bye now.

1273
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,850
(laughing)

1274
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:48,946
Okay, sh.

1275
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:50,966
(laughing)

1276
01:14:50,966 --> 01:14:51,799
- Sh, sh.

1277
01:14:51,799 --> 01:14:55,132
(soft mysterious music)

1278
01:14:59,045 --> 01:15:01,409
- Yeah, Pat, I can be
there, but I'm in town now

1279
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:05,409
and it'll be after dark
by the time I get there.

1280
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:08,021
- I'm sure that's fine.

1281
01:15:08,021 --> 01:15:11,756
I'll let her know. Thank
you, Mr. Kellerman.

1282
01:15:11,756 --> 01:15:14,006
(laughing)

1283
01:15:15,514 --> 01:15:19,004
Nine one one? I'd like to report a murder.

1284
01:15:19,004 --> 01:15:22,004
(crickets chirping)

1285
01:15:25,297 --> 01:15:26,752
(knocking on door)

1286
01:15:26,752 --> 01:15:29,578
- This is the police. Open up.

1287
01:15:29,578 --> 01:15:30,986
(knocking on door)

1288
01:15:30,986 --> 01:15:32,740
This is the police, Mr. Kellerman.

1289
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:35,093
Open up, we have a warrant.

1290
01:15:35,093 --> 01:15:37,540
All right, this scumbag
wants to play tough,

1291
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:38,957
I can play tough.

1292
01:15:44,217 --> 01:15:46,134
- Holy shit on a stick.

1293
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:53,584
What kind of crazy Ed Gein
wannabe is this Kellerman wacko?

1294
01:15:55,203 --> 01:15:58,286
Would you look at this, ew, shit, oh.

1295
01:16:00,575 --> 01:16:03,140
- [Zeke] Hey, check this out.

1296
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:04,123
Looks like this punk's taken

1297
01:16:04,123 --> 01:16:06,403
an interest in our town history.

1298
01:16:06,403 --> 01:16:08,521
- Oh, he thinks he's Kolchak, huh?

1299
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:12,938
Well, bet you he's feeling
like a dog in the ass now.

1300
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:15,971
God musta gone and made
him just about as stupid

1301
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:19,304
as He could, and then peed all over him.

1302
01:16:23,056 --> 01:16:25,973
(mysterious music)

1303
01:16:28,359 --> 01:16:30,359
- Ho, I got a door here.

1304
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:35,313
(door creaking)

1305
01:16:35,313 --> 01:16:37,396
Oh my God, Earl. Is that?

1306
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:40,782
- It's the ice cream girl.

1307
01:16:40,782 --> 01:16:42,412
Sweetest piece of ass
in the whole damn town,

1308
01:16:42,412 --> 01:16:43,996
and this guy had to go and lop it off

1309
01:16:43,996 --> 01:16:46,246
and dump it into a bathtub.

1310
01:16:47,655 --> 01:16:48,604
What kinda of a sick son of a bitch

1311
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,582
would do something like that?

1312
01:16:51,582 --> 01:16:54,232
- Melinda, this is Zeke.

1313
01:16:54,232 --> 01:16:57,434
We're gonna need some state boys out here.

1314
01:16:57,434 --> 01:16:59,753
This is one seriously troubled man.

1315
01:16:59,753 --> 01:17:00,670
- Troubled?

1316
01:17:01,528 --> 01:17:02,994
Nah, troubled's being a couple of months

1317
01:17:02,994 --> 01:17:04,427
late on your truck payment.

1318
01:17:04,427 --> 01:17:06,413
This is the kinda guy that
would put on his granny's bra

1319
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,626
and panties and whack
off with some Crunchy Jif

1320
01:17:08,626 --> 01:17:10,376
into a turkey potpie.

1321
01:17:11,653 --> 01:17:14,653
(crickets chirping)

1322
01:17:17,246 --> 01:17:18,993
- [Sally Voiceover] Waiting.

1323
01:17:18,993 --> 01:17:20,826
I can't stand waiting.

1324
01:17:21,789 --> 01:17:26,393
Here I sit brokenhearted,
came to shit but only farted.

1325
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:29,587
Goddam how I hate to have
to wait for these assholes.

1326
01:17:29,587 --> 01:17:31,816
All this mess, and over what?

1327
01:17:31,816 --> 01:17:35,203
A piece of land that was
never theirs to begin with.

1328
01:17:35,203 --> 01:17:37,496
Oh well, no skin off my ass.

1329
01:17:37,496 --> 01:17:38,926
I just want them to get here soon,

1330
01:17:38,926 --> 01:17:40,991
because at nine o'clock
wrestling comes on.

1331
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:43,313
And I don't wanna miss any of it.

1332
01:17:43,313 --> 01:17:44,230
Wait a sec.

1333
01:17:45,401 --> 01:17:46,292
Finally.

1334
01:17:46,292 --> 01:17:49,792
(dramatic drumming music)

1335
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:11,147
(soft dramatic music)

1336
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:58,828
(nail gun firing)

1337
01:18:58,828 --> 01:19:01,625
- What the hell is that doing here?

1338
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:04,792
(soft dramatic music)

1339
01:19:23,618 --> 01:19:26,618
(crickets chirping)

1340
01:19:28,338 --> 01:19:31,671
(upbeat dramatic music)

1341
01:19:34,053 --> 01:19:36,906
- Hey, you big fucking thief, put it back!

1342
01:19:36,906 --> 01:19:39,971
(screaming)

1343
01:19:39,971 --> 01:19:43,865
- Better call on someone
who knows you, Harvey.

1344
01:19:43,865 --> 01:19:46,670
(upbeat dramatic music)

1345
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:49,503
(nail gun firing)

1346
01:19:50,549 --> 01:19:52,877
- My fucking feet, goddammit!

1347
01:19:52,877 --> 01:19:54,877
(nail gun firing)

1348
01:19:54,877 --> 01:19:56,619
(Harvey screaming)

1349
01:19:56,619 --> 01:19:59,452
(nail gun firing)

1350
01:20:05,311 --> 01:20:07,944
Goddammit, don't fucking touch me!

1351
01:20:07,944 --> 01:20:09,912
(nail gun firing)

1352
01:20:09,912 --> 01:20:12,732
(Harvey screaming)

1353
01:20:12,732 --> 01:20:15,565
(nail gun firing)

1354
01:20:17,049 --> 01:20:20,466
Goddammit, someone stop this fucking gun.

1355
01:20:22,302 --> 01:20:24,802
Oh my God, you son of a bitch!

1356
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:29,539
(Harvey screaming)

1357
01:20:29,539 --> 01:20:32,372
(chainsaw idling)

1358
01:20:34,174 --> 01:20:35,007
- Sally?

1359
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:38,932
Please.

1360
01:20:41,024 --> 01:20:43,305
What did he do to deserve that?

1361
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:45,999
- He's a bad man. I have to kill him.

1362
01:20:45,999 --> 01:20:49,462
I have to protect my
family. That's what I do.

1363
01:20:49,462 --> 01:20:50,545
- It was you.

1364
01:20:52,052 --> 01:20:53,052
Your family.

1365
01:20:55,081 --> 01:20:57,568
In this house, the story.

1366
01:20:57,568 --> 01:20:58,755
Cynthia told it.

1367
01:20:58,755 --> 01:20:59,966
- Help me!

1368
01:20:59,966 --> 01:21:00,989
- You lay here.

1369
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:03,835
(chainsaw revving)

1370
01:21:03,835 --> 01:21:04,668
Here.

1371
01:21:05,829 --> 01:21:06,996
Call for help.

1372
01:21:07,907 --> 01:21:09,700
Call the cops.

1373
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:10,533
- Call the cops?

1374
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:13,845
- Yeah, come on, Bruce
Wayne, save the day.

1375
01:21:13,845 --> 01:21:15,012
I want you to.

1376
01:21:16,414 --> 01:21:18,681
- Why do you want me to?

1377
01:21:18,681 --> 01:21:23,075
- Because if you don't, I'm
gonna cut this pig's head off.

1378
01:21:23,075 --> 01:21:25,492
(whimpering)

1379
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:28,938
Call them, motherfucker!

1380
01:21:28,938 --> 01:21:31,688
(dramatic music)

1381
01:21:34,408 --> 01:21:36,351
- I need help.

1382
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:38,528
I wanna report a murder.

1383
01:21:38,528 --> 01:21:41,528
No, I wanna report a buncha murders.

1384
01:21:43,535 --> 01:21:45,450
There's no time to get into that now.

1385
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:46,283
Just.

1386
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:51,971
I don't think they believe me.

1387
01:21:53,145 --> 01:21:54,778
(Harvey screaming)

1388
01:21:54,778 --> 01:21:55,658
No!

1389
01:21:55,658 --> 01:21:57,696
(Harvey screaming)

1390
01:21:57,696 --> 01:22:00,462
(chainsaw roaring)

1391
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:03,212
(dramatic music)

1392
01:22:16,174 --> 01:22:18,007
I'm not afraid of you.

1393
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:23,737
I don't believe you're gonna kill me.

1394
01:22:23,737 --> 01:22:27,715
I don't believe you're
gonna cut me with that saw.

1395
01:22:27,715 --> 01:22:31,262
- That's good, because you're right.

1396
01:22:31,262 --> 01:22:33,754
I'm not gonna kill you, Steve.

1397
01:22:33,754 --> 01:22:35,421
I couldn't kill you.

1398
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:40,328
(chainsaw banging)

1399
01:22:42,364 --> 01:22:44,947
(dreamy music)

1400
01:22:57,236 --> 01:22:58,069
- Oh man.

1401
01:23:02,059 --> 01:23:02,892
Ugh.

1402
01:23:03,946 --> 01:23:05,011
- Freeze!

1403
01:23:05,011 --> 01:23:08,748
(soft dramatic music)

1404
01:23:08,748 --> 01:23:10,998
(groaning)

1405
01:23:11,991 --> 01:23:13,862
Don't you move a muscle!

1406
01:23:13,862 --> 01:23:16,203
- There he is. It's Norman Bates.

1407
01:23:16,203 --> 01:23:18,226
And all his singalong friends.

1408
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:19,696
Boy, it looks like you
been shitting down one leg

1409
01:23:19,696 --> 01:23:21,648
and wiping it with the other.

1410
01:23:21,648 --> 01:23:23,860
Go on, Zeke, just shoot him
now, just shoot him now.

1411
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:27,402
- When I tell you to, I want
you to lay down, slowly.

1412
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:28,874
Easy.

1413
01:23:28,874 --> 01:23:31,000
(dreamy music)

1414
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,667
- No, look, you've got it wrong.

1415
01:23:35,601 --> 01:23:37,316
- You have the right to remain silent,

1416
01:23:37,316 --> 01:23:39,565
and I suggest you do so.

1417
01:23:39,565 --> 01:23:41,085
You have the right to an attorney.

1418
01:23:41,085 --> 01:23:44,196
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

1419
01:23:44,196 --> 01:23:47,113
- Look, I know what you must think,

1420
01:23:48,713 --> 01:23:50,974
but you got it all wrong.

1421
01:23:50,974 --> 01:23:53,508
- I'm sure I do, Mr. Gacy.

1422
01:23:53,508 --> 01:23:55,998
Well don't piss down my back
and tell me that it's raining.

1423
01:23:55,998 --> 01:23:58,665
Now kiss the floor, Leatherface!

1424
01:24:00,117 --> 01:24:03,141
- Yeah, well we got an anonymous tip

1425
01:24:03,141 --> 01:24:07,524
leading us to his, uh, Steve
Kellerman's hotel room.

1426
01:24:07,524 --> 01:24:09,257
And it was about that
time that we figured out

1427
01:24:09,257 --> 01:24:12,894
that he might not be up,
might not be up to any good.

1428
01:24:12,894 --> 01:24:17,457
So we took it upon ourselves
to do a little investigating.

1429
01:24:17,457 --> 01:24:20,538
And it brought us to this place here,

1430
01:24:20,538 --> 01:24:22,176
and we found that bastard.

1431
01:24:22,176 --> 01:24:24,960
Hopefully, he'll be brought
to justice, you know.

1432
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,265
Have to play a little butt bingo

1433
01:24:26,265 --> 01:24:28,036
with Bubba down at the penitentiary.

1434
01:24:28,036 --> 01:24:29,797
(laughing)

1435
01:24:29,797 --> 01:24:30,692
- Sucker.

01:24:35,313 --> 01:24:37,702
- Oh that was good.

01:24:37,702 --> 01:24:40,104
(chainsaw revving)

1439
01:24:40,104 --> 01:24:43,476
Oh I love this. This is my favorite.

1440
01:24:43,476 --> 01:24:45,809
- A toast to those two guys.

1441
01:24:48,052 --> 01:24:49,302
- Tits and ass.

1442
01:24:56,798 --> 01:24:59,048
(laughter)
