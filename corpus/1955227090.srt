found Ahab's father.

I would raise me own.

I got a situation in hell and
I've got to take care of it.

Chad, didn't you tell
him about the Twinkies?

1457
01:26:44,767 --> 01:26:47,236
I spent my whole
life worshipping You.

1458
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:49,772
But I swear to God if you
don't show me to the exit,

1459
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:50,706
I'll kill him.

1460

You know this is bad
for business, right?

1467
01:27:02,418 --> 01:27:05,754
I think, uh, maybe, just
maybe we can get a Bible
