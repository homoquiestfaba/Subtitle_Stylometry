So just show us where
his details are in here.

180
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,794
I can't do that.

181
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,730
Why not?

182
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,865
Because I didn't
take notes that day.

183
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,934
It might not be him?

184
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,277
This article was about
saving young people's lives.

185
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,847
I wanted to write about
all the kids I interviewed.

186
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,015
I came back with
a plan for that.

187
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,350
A more
aggressive story about

188
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:54,219
the corruption within
these aid agencies.

189
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,287
But we felt
it was too broad.

190
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,856
Don't imply
this has anything to do

191
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,224
with anyone
other than you, Mike.

192
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,358
You said
write about one boy.

193
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,694
Suggest the issues
through one boy's story.

194
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,029
A personal portrait.

195
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,097
And you were right.
You were absolutely right.

196
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,966
I assumed you had
the research.

197
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,768
I did, just not
all in one place.

198
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:09,901
Then that's not research.

199
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:13,838
Mike, you must understand
how damaging this could be

200
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,740
for the charities
who work with these children.

201
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,042
Not to mention
the paper.

202
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:17,375
You said write it up.

203
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,979
I... I thought it could work
on a higher level.

204
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,114
I said write it up,
not make it up.

205
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,983
The higher level
is the truth.

206
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,117
You didn't have
the research,

207
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,119
that's the only fact
that matters here.

208
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,790
Do you think this stuff
writes itself?

209
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:36,061
You hire people like me
to get on the ground
and hunt.

210
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,930
That's how this paper
has competitive advantage.

211
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,732
I did the best
with what I had.

212
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,467
You lied.

213
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,070
I just can't understand why.

214
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,706
It's not like
you had anything
to prove to any of us,

215
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,074
you're an exceptional
journalist.

216
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:49,407
It just bewilders me.

217
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:53,344
We'll have to be open
with our readers
about this, Mike,

218
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,879
which is no small
embarrassment.

219
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:54,879
Explain what you've done.

220
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,750
Do you know what that means
for those poor kids?

221
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,020
For the support your article
gave them, for their futures?

222
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,455
For your future?

223
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:04,889
What the fuck
were you thinking?

224
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,157
Okay, that's enough, Karen.

225
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,430
All right. (STAMMERS)

226
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,902
I can,
um, write a retraction,
if that's what you want.

227
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,904
That's what I can do.
I can go...
I'll go right now.

228
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,308
(STAMMERS) I'll go
and I'll just write you
a retraction,

229
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,509
if that's what
you want, okay?

230
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,348
(EXHALES)

231
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,056
Just, can you not print
the apology?

232
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,095
If you print the apology,
no one will touch me.

233
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,463
Can you just...
Can you do that?

234
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,198
Can you just not print
the apology?

235
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,067
Just that, please?

236
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,939
You have a great future
ahead of you, Mike.

237
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,475
But not here.

00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,035
If I can find
something good.

247
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,176
Uh, I can ask the university
for a raise,

248
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,912
or take on some
high school teaching.

249
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,580
No, I'll make some calls.

250
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,587
It'll be nice to have you
back for a while.

<i>You hadn't heard?</i>

No. Why are you
telling me this?

<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Hold on one second.</i>

302
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,110
PAT: When they picked him up
in Mexico,

303
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,211
he denied
all knowledge of it,

304
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,146
but the cops clearly felt

305
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,347
they had enough
to bring him in.

306
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,383
He was just a regular guy,

307
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,419
an intelligent, sane man
from a good family.

308
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,354
Comes home one night
and kills his wife and kids.

309
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,123
It makes no sense.

310
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,125
At any rate,
this turned out to be

311
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,259
the end of the line for them.

312
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,861
He... He drowned them.

313
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,797
Although there is evidence
to suggest

314
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,533
that his wife and baby
were strangled first.

315
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,435
Where are
they holding him now?

316
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,237

317
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:29,407
He'll stay there until
it comes to trial, I suspect.

318
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,444
I'm going to have to start

319
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,413

it's quite a drive.

be able to tell me that.

00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,536
Look, I know
what I'm doing, okay?

523
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:33,470
I know.

524
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,542

00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,811

00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,113
Love you.

527
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,101

528
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,103
Second floor,
the one on the left.

529
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,838
MICHAEL: Can we see it?

530
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:07,838
PAT: Well, it's totally empty,
the cops cleared it out.

531
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,975
But I can show you
where they were found.

532
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,245
According to the coroner,
MaryJane and Madison

533
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,415
were beaten
and strangled to death,

534
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,384
and then zipped inside
two suitcases

535
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:23,253
with free weights
and dropped here,

536
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,989
breaking a water pipe
on the way down,

537
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,591
which is noticed
the next morning

538
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,493
and becomes part of
the reason the canal

539
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,928
was searched
the following week.

540
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,263
It's pretty public here.

541
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,866
I know. Crazy.

542
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,069
And then Zach and Sadie
are driven 15 miles south

543
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,939
and dropped in the water
at Waldport, over there.

544
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,041
MICHAEL: Why drive 15 miles

545
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:46,577
to dump bodies on the edge
of the next town?

546
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,878
Don't you find that odd?

547
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,280
Maybe something in him
wanted to get caught.

548
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,949
MICHAEL: Then why'd flee?

549
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,884
I guess
he changed his mind.

550
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,220
So this is
where he dropped them.

551
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,222
It's not high enough
to kill them outright,

552
00:30:58,224 --> 00:30:59,890
so they would have drowned.

553
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,492
Unless the cold made them
go into cardiac arrest.

554
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,862
It was well below zero
that night.

555
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,298
Terrible thing
for him to do.

556
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,033
If he did it.

557
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,902
If?

558
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,037
He's gonna plead innocent.

560
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,041
He told me.

561
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,910
You spoke to him?

562
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:20,978
I met him.

563
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,112
Why?

564
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,649
I wanted to hear
his side of the story.

565
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,986
I'm not sure Christian Longo

566
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,988

his story heard.

Chris, your letter was
an extraordinary thing.

But this story
between the two of us,

581
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,436
it's not an article
I can write.

Oh.

you speak so beautifully,

All right. (CLEARS THROAT)

598
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,751
All right,
so on page 23 you write,

599
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:42,586
"When I lost my position
at the realtor's,

600
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,521
"MaryJane thought
I'd tried to get fired,

"but I never said it was
a job I didn't want."

602
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:50,160
So that's a double negative,
"never said I didn't want."

00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,497
Okay.

604

a double negative.

we would write,

00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,236
"It was a job I wanted."

608
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,173

might make the difference

to force a mistrial,
he's won.

981
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:29,151

1066
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:16,898
I asked him what happened
to his family.

1067
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,301
And he said he'd sent them
to a better place.

1068
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:22,104
GREG: A better place?
What do you think
he meant by that?

1069
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,505
Do you believe that
he had murdered his family?

1073

1075
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,785

a couple of splashes.

1076
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:36,785

I am the manager

How long did he
work for you?

1089
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,180
About two months.

1090
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,549

you saw him?

1091
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,452
December 17th.
In the morning,

1092
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:13,021
he came in to work
about an hour late.

BETH: He said his wife
had left him for another man.

<i>Two days after the murder.</i>

1105
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:40,916

1106
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,184
<i>What was he doing?</i>

1107
01:03:42,186 --> 01:03:43,585
<i>Playing basketball.</i>

1108
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:45,387
<i>He was playing basketball</i>
<i>two days</i>

<i>after his wife and children</i>
<i>were murdered?</i>

1110

<i>Yeah. We attend</i>
<i>the same gym.</i>

1111
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:49,591
CORONER: Neither of
the children's bodies

1112
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:50,992
displayed any evidence of

1113
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:50,992
having struggled
with an attacker,

1114
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:55,597
which suggests
they likely knew
and trusted their killer.

1115
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,202
Both Zachary and Sadie

1116
01:04:00,204 --> 01:04:02,103
had Play-Doh
under their fingernails.

1117
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:07,142
Sadie's toenails were painted
with a pearlescent polish,

1118
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:10,612
the same as
on MaryJane's toes.

1119
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,882
They likely painted
them together.

1120
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:17,886
Madison

1121
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:21,289
was found in the suitcase.

1122
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,863
Tiny scratch marks
here indicate

1123
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:29,164
Madison must have
come around

1124
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:32,234
at some point
before she drowned.

1125
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:34,903
Dozens of facial
capillaries burst

1126
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:36,638
as she struggled for air.

1127
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,975
MaryJane's body was found
in this suitcase.

1128
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:43,211
This was a violent
and frenzied act.

1129
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,347
A ferocious attack.

1130
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:48,016
Her neck has been broken.

1131
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:51,152
Though this looks like
it may have happened
after she died,

1132

when she was forced
into the suitcase.

hurt her the most.

I should get out
and leave her alone.

1184
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:34,309
I'd never seen her

to be at work.

So I offered to call in sick,

1200
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,188
but MaryJane said I had to go

1201
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,623
because we were
in such a deep hole,

1202

any more sick days.

and drove me to work.

1205
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:32,367

just her robe.

1211
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,650

1212
01:09:50,586 --> 01:09:53,321
And then she collapsed.

1213
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,191
I asked her what was wrong.

1214
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,326
And I was actually

1219
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,677

of your crime.

1437
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:30,337
Instead,
you manipulated this court

What do you mean?

1571
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,870
Well, it seems to me
that Christian Longo

1572
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,739
has lost his liberty,

1573
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:27,874
but hearing you read today,

1574
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,676
I was just wondering

1575
01:32:29,678 --> 01:32:31,278
what you might
have lost as well.
