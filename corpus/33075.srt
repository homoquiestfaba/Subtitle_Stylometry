1
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,400
Super Ali,

2
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,200
I don't see you walking much.
-It ain't true.

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Shut up!

4
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,000
It's time to teach both
of you a lesson.

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

6
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,600
You better step back,
unless you want me to bust a cap in your ass.

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,200
This is my neigbourhood,
and these girls belong to me.

8
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,200
''Belong?'' That's is a very sexiest
way to talked about these bitches

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,400

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Speak to the hand, cause it face

14
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Remember, life is the most
precious gift.

15
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
That Jah has given us.

16
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Unlucky.

17
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
You saved us.

18
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,200
I just really want to thank you.

19
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,800
That's gonna need the two of us!

20
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Let me help you with that.

21
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,200
Thank you very much.

22
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
Oh, Tupac, no!

23
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
What ever.

24
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Yeah baby.

25
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Play with the balls.

26
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Good dog.

27
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Ali? Are you awake?

28
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
For real.

29
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,400
Ali-Palli, do you know how very late it is?

30
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,200
And you are still in bed all asleep.

31
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,600
It's nice to get up in the morning...

32
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,000
It's nice to get up in the morning...

33
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,600
But better stay in bed.

34
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,000
Ali-Palli it's not nice to play with your puppy
when nanny's in the room

35
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,800
Come on,

36
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,200
Oh wicked.

37
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Respect.

38
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,000
So? What going down in Staines
town, my niggers?

39
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah nigger, we're just cold chilling,
kicking, back sucking

40
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,400
Up some gin and juice laid back.
-Laid back?

41
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Juicy, is you wearing green?

42
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I knew it, you is defecting
to the East posse ini'it?

43
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,000
Come on, let's stop him.

44
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,200
No wait,

45
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,600
My mum put my yellow top in the wash.

46
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,000
My brother blue football socks even
thought they ain't colour fast

47
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,400
Alright, but you tell that slack,
that in the ghetto - 

48
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Washing non colour fast synthetics at 60 degrees -

49
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,400
Could cost you your life!

50
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,000
Will you boys move?

51
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,800
I've told you before is a fire risk.

52
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah my
brother what's it about?

53
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,000
We're just folk brothers chillin'

54
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,000
Maxin, relaxin, it ain't too taxin, booff!

55
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,600
Move!

56
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Ok, yeah, we're just sitting on the bench.

57
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
The East Staines Massive.

58
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,200
Well if it ain't the West Staines Massive
outside their precious center.

59
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,000
East side is the best.

60
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,600
West side is the best.

61
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,200
East side is the best.

62
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
West side is the best.

63
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
West side is the best.

64
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
East side is the best.

65
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Anyways, you is on our turf!

66
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,600
Once you pass the bumble bee
day nursery

67
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,400
Just before you get to mini roundabout.
you know the kindergarten

68
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,000
- The you is in the West side.
- We don't care.

69
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,800
Your mama is so fat.

70
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,400
That when she voulenteered to
clean the cages at the zoo

71
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,600
People they walked
by her and say

72
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,400
Look at that hippopotamus.

73
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
That ain't fair.

74
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400

75
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,000

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm feeling it.

88
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,800
I'm kissing it.

89
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm checking it.

90
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,600
Nice.

91
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Wicked.

92
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
Wait a sec, I is gonna to be late
for my class.

93
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,800
Crack, cocaine is destroying
our community

94
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,400
So when a brother makes it full,
they deserve our respect.

95
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,800
So let's big it up for Darren,

96
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who's been cleaned and off
the crack now for 8 years.

97
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,600
8 and 3 quarter years.
- What ever.

98
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
You don't want to say this but...

99
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Most of you ain't never gonna see 11

100
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,200
Look he's crying!
Homo, homo!

101
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,400
Hey! We'll have none of that language here.

102
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,200
The word is batty-boy!

103
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,200
Better!

104
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Now everybody up.

105
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,000
Cos is time to give out this week's badges.

106
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,400
First. Big it up for my main man Andy

107
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,200
Who has finally got his
hot wiring badge.

108
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
And his advanced swearing badge.

109
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,800
Shit off, you hairy dog's cock.

110
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Respect

111
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,600
And since you got fifth badge.

112
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,200
You has also earn your second slit.

113
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,800
Hopefully one day you'll get
to be Tyrone's level

114
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Tyrone, if you get any better We is gonna
have to start doing your pubes

115
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,800
I don't have any.
-Well, I have a million.

116
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Now, remember, without realness,
We is nothing!

117
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,000
So, posse, keep it real!

118
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
Keep it real!

119
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,000
Keep it real!

120
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,200
Now on the street,
you has got to know that your homey

121
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
Will take a cap in his ass for you.

122
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,600
So let's start with a very basic
trust exercise.

123
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,400
One, two, three.

124
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Ali, can I have a word?

125
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,800
Sure.

126
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,200
It's about the senator.

127
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,600
Now, I know how much these
classes mean to you

128
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
And how much the kids enjoy them.

129
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,400
But I'm afraid the goverment is
withdrawing our funding

130
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,800
They're closing down the center.

131
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
What?

132
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,000
How is these kids gonna make
out in the ghetto now?

133
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
You have to go somewhere else.

134
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Something else? Do you what
this centre means to them?

135
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200
And to me?

136
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,000
This is the spiritual home
of the West Staines massive

137
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,800
This is like what Mecca is to the jews.

138
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,800
Is like what Kentucky is to chickens.

139
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,200
And it was here when I first
felt my Julie's ...

140
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,600
Ali, there's nothing you can do.

141
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,000
Now, you better go and tell the kids.

142
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,600
I ain't never gonna let them
close us down.

143
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,000
Keep it real, yeah?

144
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,200
The Begium prime minister
briefing in half an hour

145
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,800
And the deputy prime minister
urgently wishes to speak to you

146
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Have you got the polls result yet?

147
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,600
Excuse me.

148
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
I wish I haven't.

149
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
He's putting 22 points behide.

150
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
What about Marrice?
-23 points behide.

151
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
The youth folks deserting us in droves

152
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,000
All our folks are just out of touch

153
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,400
Maybe we are, you know I am

154
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,800
Don't be ridiculous.
-Are we gonna lose this?

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
No chance we haven't
lost Stains in 20 years.

156
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,600
We're not going to start now.

157
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,400
We just have an image problem.

158
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,400
We have to find the candidate
who will improve that image

159
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Somebody young.

160
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,400
Somebody ethnic.

161
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,400
Somebody in touch.

162
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Exactly.
-That's absolutley right David.

163
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,200
We have to find an
outstanding candidate.

164
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,800
Who's intellectually superior.

165
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,400
Who can guarantee us victory.

166
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Is Julie about?
-She's upstairs.

167
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,000
Hello baby, Is been missing you
so much today

168
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,400

170
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,600

173
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000

174
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400

00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,200

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400

178
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,200
Sorry, there was something in them.

179
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,000
Because there's these flees

180
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
And the two of them coming in again.

181
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,200
And caught in my eyes.

182
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,000
Ali G, you have been a very bad boy
you need to be punished.

183
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Are you a bad boy?

184
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,400
Yes I am.

185
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,800
My skin is so dry.

186
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So for being a bad boy.
I want you to rub oil into me.

187
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,600
Paying special attention to my breasts
and my back

188
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,600
Okay, I will do that.

189
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,000
But first I want you to take your hat off.

190
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,800
You naughty, naughty boy.

191
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,800
But me never take my hat off.

192
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,400
You take that off
and I'll take these off.

193
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,600
Okay.

194
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,000
Now, I'm going to milk you.

195
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,800
Ali.

196
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Give me one more second.

197
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Behave Alistair.

198
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,000
J. Lo, they is closing down the center.

199
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,800
So I is gonna go on hungerstrike until they
save it or until I die.

200
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,400
So just in case I do join Tupac and
Biggie in that ghetto in the sky

201
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,200
I has come here
to bone you one last time.

202
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,800
I think Mr. Johnson might have
something to say about that.

203
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,800
Can I watch?

204
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,400
I ain't got no problem with that.
Has you?

205
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,400
Ali...

206
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
Don't do nothing stupid alright.

207
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,000
Hear me now.
She ain't really my Julie.

208
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Obviously in real life I is going out
with someone much fitter

209
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
But they do that to make me more accessible.

210
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,600
Which mean you girls out there
will think I will nob you

211
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Even if you was a minger.

212
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,400
Okay, you got 10 seconds
until you start, Mac Daddy.

213
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay, and go!

214
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,800
Mr G, why are you on hungerstrike?

215
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,000
In the struggle for...
In the struggle for justice!

216
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
And I is willing to lay down my life.

217
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,800
Just like Martin Luther.

218
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
This is local party chairman.
Alan Swan.

219
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,800
He'd been putting together a list
of names for the election

220
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,000
This is a great honour...
I've always been a particular admirer.

221
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
My name is Swan.
-Right.

222
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,800
Well...there are 3 really outstanding
candidates to match all your critera

223
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,400

225
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,000
Have you tried these new
chicken dippers?

226
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They're quite good aren't they?

227
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh yeah, they're really good.

228
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,600
What sauce you going for?

229
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,000
I think it's barbecue.

230
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,200
Take can't it! I can't take it!

231
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
Chicken dippers!

232
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,000
Good, we can go home now.

233
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,800
Oh nips.
-I'II get the keys, yeah?

234
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,000
Starting again...
from now!

235
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,200
No.

236
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,000
Well, what has we got here then?

237
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,800
I is doin' a serious protest
if you don't mind.

238
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Well in that case,
we'll leave you to it.

239
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,400
Thanks.

240
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,600
Just one thing though.

241
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,400
Grow biggie, grow!

242
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,400

Jennifer Lopez lessin of the one from
Destiny's Child with the big size!

244
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
Look at it now! Look at it now!

245
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Look at my massive beast!

246
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,200
You filthy animal.

247
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,800
Old chef
This rail is very dirty

248
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,800
It's going to need a lot of polishing.

249
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,200
Ph.D. in economics. 3 years at Havard
Age 34.

250
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,400
Swan, is there any reason why
there should be an absurdly dressed

251
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,800
Halfnaked man chained to a fence being
tossed off by an old blind council worker?

252
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,800
Ignore him. It's the local idiot
making some pathetic protest.

253
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,800
Have him unchained,
and bring him in here.

254
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,800
But I'm trying to go through the...
-Bring him in, Swan.

255
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,800
Straight ahead at top of the stairs.

256
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,400
Let me do all the things...
You want me to do...

257
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,000

That's his full name and address.

269
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Tell me Ali, do you have a job?

270
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,200
Unfortunately I has recently
gone on the dole.

271
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Really when?

272
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,600
8 years and 3 months ago.

273
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,200
It said here you claimed disability
benefit - are you...

274
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Yeah, I is actually spasticated.

275
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,400
I got terrible D.J injuries.

276
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,400
I still ain't got full mobility on my
main mixing finger.

277
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,000
Everything down there is still working,
oh yeah.

278
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,000
Ali, would you sit down.
Please sit down

279
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,800
Have you ever consider becoming
a member of parliament?

280
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,600
Why would me wanna do that for?
It's full of pricks.

281
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,200
That's a little harsh.
I'm a M.P. Am I a prick?

282
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,600
Yes.

283
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,600
Let's try approaching this from
an different angle.

284
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,200
Is there nothing in the world that
you would like to change?

285
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Yes, me want to save the leisure center.

286
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,600
Obviously...

287
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
As the M.P of Staines,
you could achieve that.

288
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,400
Would you stand as our candidate
in this bi-election?

289
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,200
I got to be honest.
Me ain't actually bind.

290
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,400
I mean,
I done it with two girls.

291
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I seen it on the internet. But me
would never feel completely comfortable

292
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
Me being bumped by a man.
Or even bumping a man.

293
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,800
I know a lot of people
say never say ever.

294
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,600
But me feel so strong that my exit hole
should always stay my exit hole

295
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,600
Never become my entry hole.

296
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
You know how I stand?
-Yes.

297
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,400
Yes, It's been a pleasure meeting you.

298
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,000

299
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,400
David, what are you doing?

300
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,800
He was the biggest idiot I've ever met.
Choose him

301
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,600
And there is no way we can win the election..
- I know

302
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,200
There'll be a leadership crisis
And vote of no confidence.

303
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
The P.M will be out.

304
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,400
And who could possibly replace him?

305
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Ali, has 2 week to lose us
18 thousand votes

306
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,000
Let's get him on the campaign trail.

307
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,600

representin' Staines.

Steve, it's your turn to shit for the letterbox.

Our anit-bullying programme has won
praise throughout the county

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,800
And incidents bullying in this school
are at an all time low.

317
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,000

Of the town hall. We are asking all the

We would be honoured.
-In front of everyone?

Yes.

333
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,800
Not bad.

334
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,800
This is absolutely vital.

335
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,200
10 days ago we were 14 points ahead
with one day to go

336
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,800
we are 8 points behind.

337
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,400
Listen - did you get the manifesto
that I sent you?

338
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,600

leisure center ain't it?

350
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,200
You can't suggest that your soul
policy is to save a center

351
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,000
that is barely used,
and are a terrible drain on funds

352
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,800
What are your others policies?

353
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,800
My other policies?

354
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
Yes, you must have some.

355
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Well, I think is really important to
reduce inflation

356
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,800
and also to invest in the nurse...

357
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, the NHS...

358
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,400
You're reading from my sheet.

359
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
No I ain't.
I thought out these things myself

360
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,800
You obviously copied from me.

361
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,400
It wasn't me.

362
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,200
Perhaps you'd like to tell me where
you stand on the ERM

363
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,600
No problem.

364
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Me thought the first album was wack

365
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,200
And to be honest me ain't
all in their music.

366
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,000
Quick frankly the voters of Staines
deserve better. 

367
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You're making a mockery of this debate.

368
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,800
What? Is you looking in the mirror?

369
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,600
All you're doing is making it
obvious to all the voters

370
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,400
out there what an absolute
buffoon you are!

371
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Talking about yourself again?

372
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,000
You are an embarrassment to your party
and to the people of Staines

373
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,200
That is not a very nice way to talk
about your mum.

374
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,200
I put it to you, that you are
the worst possible candidate

375
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,000
ever put foward
by your miserable party

376
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,000
Well, I put it to you...

377
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
...that you sucked off a horse!

378
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,400
I did not...
suck off a horse.

379
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,400
I have already dealt with this issue
with the party chairman

380
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,800
And as I explained to him,
I was out hunting with a friend

381
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,800
and I slipped onto the end
of an horse's fallos

382
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:47,800
Which unfortunately, owing to
it beeing the mating season, was aroused.

383
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,400
Another dramatic day in the Staines
bi-election saw the unexpected withdrawal

384
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
the opposition candidate David Griffiths.

385
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,800
Tomorrow's vote now become
a two horse race

386
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,200
between Thomas Alvares
and Ali G

387
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,800
With the result too close to call.

388
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,600
Thomas Alvares Liberal Democrates
5080 votes.

389
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Alistair Lesile Gramham
-Who?

390
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What a stupid name.

391
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,600
5086 votes.

392
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,600
You won! You made it!

393
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,000
Ali G has been duly elected
as member of parliament

394
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,000
for Staines.

395
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,000
Now, do you want to see the new
member of parliament?

396
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,000
Look how I is touching myself.

397
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Do you like that?

398
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,400
Is that turnin' you on?

399
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Not really.

400
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Would you like to give a kiss
to Mr Gurkin?

401
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Oh baby you're so long and hard.

402
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,200
That's the hand brake.

403
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,200
Now let's get jiggy!

404
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Is it in yet?

405
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,600
Hey, hey I know you. You is the giz
that did it with that pussy ain't it?

406
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,800
Respect.

407
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,200
They is dissin' our posse.
I is gonna sort this.

408
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,800
What is he doing?

409
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Umm...I'm not sure, Prime minister.

410
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Relax.

411
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Look at you.

412
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,200
All you ever do day long
is cuss each other.

413
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,400
RESTECP.
Do you even know what that spells?

414
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,400
Restecp?

415
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,800
Yes. Restecp.

416
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,600
How is anyone out there meant
to restecper each other

417
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,800
if you lock in here and don't even start

418
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,600
Restecping one and other.

419
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
Do you know how I'd make
this country better?

420
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,600
It's simple, two words.

421
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,600
"Keep it real!"

422
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
That's 3 words.

423
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,200
That be a spanic. "IT"
ain't no real word

424
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,600
is short for ini'it.

425
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,200
Keep it real...

426
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,400
The member of Staines will be banned
from the house

427
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,000
Is it because I is black?

428
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,200
What in gods name have
you done to me?

429
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Restecp?

430
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,800
I want that idiot in my office in the
morning with his letter of resignation

431
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,400
Is that clear?

432
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,000
Come in.

433
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,800
Listen. Me know me done wrong.

434
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,400
Ali, haven't you read the papers?

435
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I can't believe it!

436
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,600
There's a dog that can
play table tennis!

437
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,600
Ali it's the Press,
they love you.

438
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,600
But how can he hold the bat?

439
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,400
Ali, the deputy Prime minister
and I were wondering...

440
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,000
What would you say if I asked you
to join the cabinet?

441
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,800
No, think about it.
Ali joins the cabinet

442
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,200
The two of them are public
allied together.

443
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,000
Ali slips up,
and he take that old prat with him.

444
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,800
What makes you think Ali will join?

445
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,800
Cause I've suggested to the
prime minister

446
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
that he offers to save his leisure center.

447
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
Are you mad...

448
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,200
Let me finish.

449
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,600
Offers to save his leisure center,
if Ali can secure him a 20 point lead

450
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
in the polls.

451
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,800
Now I is in the cabinet and all that,
could I have a look at the red button?

452
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,800
Can I trust you?

453
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,200
Yes.
-Alright.

454
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,600
Now - one touch on that red button -
could destroy the whole world.

455
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,800
That is very interesting you say that because...

456
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,200
No! No! Ali please stand away.

457
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,600
Can't we just blow up something?

458
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Of course not.

459
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,200
Please?
-No.

460
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Just somewhere shitty like Wales.
-Ali

461
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,400
I heard the Prime Minister of Wales
called your a slug.

462
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
I am the Prime Minister of Wales!

463
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,000
Well, you shouldn't talk that way
about your mum, ain't it?

464
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,200
Your first cabinet meeting
is next Thursday

465
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,400
We're going to be discussing the asylum seekers

466
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm sending you on a fact-finding mission.

467
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,200
If anybody wants to smuggle
anything into Britain.

468
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,000
Chances are they will
come through here.

469
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
And it's not just immigrants.

470
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Take a look at this.

471
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,800
You'll be appalled.

472
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,000
Look at this crap.

473
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,800
30 kilos of marijuana

474
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Smuggled in from Europe, South America
and the Middle East.

475
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
That is terrible.

476
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,000
Is there any skunk?

477
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,200
Yes. Some scumbag managed to
smuggle in 15 kilos of this

478
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,000
Turns out it's the strongest
superskunk ever discovered!

479
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,600
Over here is where we keep the
confiscated weapons.

480
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,200
You must have such a laugh here!

481
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,400
No, we don't.

482
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
This next section is where we keep
the mountains

483
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,400
of hardcore pornography
most of it coming from Germany

484
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,200
You may not want to look at this...

485
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,200
No! I got a job to do.

486
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,200
I know. It makes me feel sick too.

487
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,600
Well, I is gonna have to compile my report now,

488
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,200
so if you wouldn't mind fucking off.

489
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,400
Certainly, sir.

490
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,000
They'll be sending me down a couple
of experts to help with my research

491
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,800
Hello. We is experts.

492
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Well, Ali. Tell us what did you
find out in Dover?

493
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,000
Well, we saw a lot of stuff.
Most of it from Germany

494
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,400
Of these blokes, all going in
through the back door.

495
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
He's absolutely right.

496
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I've been to Germany and experienced
it myself

497
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,800
Respect.

498
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I remember one time there were
these two huge African men

499
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,800
who managed to squeezed themselves
into this tiny box.

500
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,800
How long was they in there for?

501
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,800
15 hours

502
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,000
It was incredibly emotional.

503
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,000
Must have hurt a lot.

504
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
It still does.

505
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Sorry.

506
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,000
So John, what are we going to do
about these asylum seekers?

507
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
We can't just let them all in.

508
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,400
It would cripple the economy.

509
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Yes Ali?

510
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,000
Let's think about this right?

511
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,400
What is the main thing we ain't
got enough of in this country?

512
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,600
Hospitals?

513
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,200
No.

514
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,200
Libraries?

515
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,600
We ain't got enough fit women.
And we has got too many mingers.

516
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,200
No offense.

517
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,200
So why don't we just let in all the fit
refugees and turn away all the ramp ones?

518
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,800
That way we solve both problems.

519
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
We is nobbig two birds with one
conny, ain't it?

520
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
What do you think?

521
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I think we should keep it real.

522
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,800
Fit.

523
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,000
Fit.

524
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Wait.

525
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,400
Back to Slovenia.

526
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,000
Education standard are
at their lowest in 15 years.

527
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,000
That is because kids is learning stuff
that ain't no use to them.

528
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,800
I mean who here has ever used maps?

529
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,200
Or English?

530
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Exactly.

531
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,000
Let's start making education relevant.

532
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,400
So, if Kevin buys 6 oz of
Jamaican sensimilia from Fat Tony

533
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,600
For £480, cash in hand

534
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,800
And has to divide it amongst
eleven of his customers

535
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,600
How much did he charge for 1/8

536
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,600
So that he can make £100 profit
to pay off his child support?

537
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,200
The situation in Northern Ireland
is threathing to spiral

538
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,200
out of all control.

539
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,600
The only way you is ever gonna get
those Hinuds to stop killing them Islams,

540
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,800
- It's actually Catholics
fighting Protestants.

541
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,200
What ever.

542
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,400
Is if you get some really fit woman
to get her babylons out for peace.

543
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,400
Prime Minister.
- Not you, love.

544
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,600
The army is costing the Brittish
tax payers 4.2 billion pounds a year

545
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,200
How does the government
intend to reduce this figure?

546
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,000
We is gonna hire the A-team.

547
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,600
Her majesty, the Queen

548
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,400
Your majesty, may I introduce Ali G,
member of parliament for Staines.

549
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,800
You is much fitter
than you look in them coins.

550
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,400
Tell you next time I put a
50 pence piece in my pocket

551
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,400
Me will feel honoured having your
head some close to my nuts.

552
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,000
The jobs figures are of their
highest level.

553
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,400
This country has a special relationship
with the United States

554
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,800
What do you think of Bush?

555
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,000
Me love bush!

556
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,200
I mean, me love anything that gives
foliage to the punani-area

557
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,000
Would you do a dance for me, please?

558
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,800
Oh my gosh.

559
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,200
Shaven heaven!
Respect!

560
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,400
...as Ali G's influence grows
ever stronger...

561
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
...Ali G storms the parliament...

562
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,600
...Ali G mania sweeps the UK...

563
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
As of 12 o'clock.

564
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,800
All Rizla's will be free.

565
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,800
To discourage their use, there will be a
levy of 25 pence on the pound on panties.

566
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,000
This will exclude thongs.

567
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,800
As for the heatlh service.

568
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,600
Marjuana will be made available
free on the NHS

569
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
For the treatments of chronic diseases.

570
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,000
Such as itchy scrunt.

571
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Furthermore

572
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,200
I am a bell-end...

573
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:31,000
"I Iike to take it up the batty.
Yes, I do. It feel really nice.

574
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,800
And is my favorite.

575
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,000
I used to be a girl and wear knicks.

576
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,400
Honest, ask my mum!"

577
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
More news in central Africa,

578
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,400
Britain is to host a
last minute peace conference...

579
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,000
A triumphant budget, framed by
Britain's most controvercial M.P...

580
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,600
Just because you bought me a fancy frock,
don't make up for 3 months of neglect.

581
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,600
Me know.

582
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
Listen Ali, I ain't never been to
nothing like this before

583
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,500
so don't leave me
on my own tonight, alright?

584
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
Don't worry baby.

585
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,400
Look, there's the Prime Minister!
I've seen him on the tellie,

586
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,600
Let me get his autograph!

587
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,600
This is my Julie.

588
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,600
This is President Waterna from Thailand

589
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,300
It is a honour to meet you.

590
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,000
Thai, aiiight!

591
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,800
A present...

592
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,600
Ali, let's move along.

593
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,400
This is the Mongolian delegate.

594
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,700
Is you a genuine mong?

595
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,700
Oh, that is fantastic that you're
also being represented here!

596
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,800
I will - go and get you - 
some nice - Crayons!

597
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Should we carry on.

598
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,600
Oh, this is Borat from Kazakhstan.

599
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Bless you!

600
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,600
It is nice to meet you.

601
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,000
Get off, you batty-boy!

602
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
Ali, Ali...

603
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,900
...you're a cock-sucker...

604
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,000
Bonjour.

605
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,200
Canapé sir?

606
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,600
My Julie.

607
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,600
Julie.

608
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Hello?

609
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,900
What are you doing up here with me?

610
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,500
Why don't you stay downstairs
with that push girl?

611
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
We was just talking about the politics.

612
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,200
I ain't interested in what you've got to say!
Shut up!

613
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,200
For real. Me won't speak no more.

614
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,600
You really are a prank.

614
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,400
Now come here!

615
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,200
We can't. This is the P.M.'s bedroom.

616
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Well?

617
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,000
Why don't you pretend to be
the Prime Pinister then?

618
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,000
Cheeky?

619
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,700
Ladies and gentlemen...

620
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,400
In advance of tomorrow's summit

621
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,400
I shall be having private talks with both parties

622
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,100
So first President Muephu.

623
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,200
Would you care to join me upstairs?
-My pleasure.

624
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,200
Thank you.

625
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,600
I must say I enjoyed that.

626
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,800
So did I.

627
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm so glad we trashed it out.

628
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,400
Ladies and gentlemen, I want everyone to know
than President Muephu here is a very big man.

629
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,000
I would like you to know
that the Prime Minister

630
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,500
was very hard,

631
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,000
but very straight.

632
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,400
The President here was very much 
on top to start off with

633
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,400
and I don't mind telling you
I was in a deep hole

634
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh very deep.

635
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,000
Yes, but eventhough we had
some sticky patches,

636
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,400
I'm delighted to say we came
together finally in the end.

637
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,200
Yes, I lapped up everything
that you had to offer.

638
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,400
Now President Numpeba, would you care
to join me upstairs?

639
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,200
No bloody way!

640
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,200
Can I come?

641
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,900
Come on Ali, let's go home.

642
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,200
I'll cook you up your favourite.

643
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,000
Yeah, butterscotch.

643
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,500
Mmmmm - butterscotch!

644
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,600
This bit is for the girls.
To show that me can be well sensitive

645
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,200
By the way, if any of you bitches
is fit and into doggie

646
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,200
then here is my mobile number.

647
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,200
Callers must be over 16.

648
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,400
But not by too much obviously.

649
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,400
I can't.

650
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,700
They need me at the
peace conference tomorrow

651
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,200
You what?

652
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,000
What about the people who
really need you?

653
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,000
What about Ricky?

654
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,700
What about Dave?

655
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,600
What about me Ali?

656
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,300
Please come back to Staines.

657
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,500
The world is bigger then Staines.

658
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,400
And me got to save it.

659
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,200
Well, you'll have to do it
on your own then.

660
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,400
Julie? Julie?

661
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,500
We've got to get rid of him before
this bloody center is saved

662
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,000
What I thought...
-You thought?!?

663
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,600
The United States will do
everything in it's power

664
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,200
to support Chad in it's stuggle
against it's neighbours.

665
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,700
Russia will not allow this
western oppression to continue.

665
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,500
In order to support Burkina Faso,

665
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:51,600
is prepared to utilize all our
military capabilities.

666
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,400
Ali, Ali, Ali!

666
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,900
Could be armageddon breaking out!
Please help me will you?

666
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:03,900
Sure, bro.

667
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,200
United State will not be intimidated!

668
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,200
We are prepared to meet any show of force
with our full military might!

669
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,400
Wait!
Do you know why there is no shine in there?

669
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,600
It's cause they ain't been fed their teas!

670
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Come on, choppy-chop.

671
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,900
Moving to emotion, all those in favour
of sending a ran down to the gas station

672
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,300
to get some potato chips
and chocolate

673
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,400
raise your hand.

674
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
Oh bummer.

675
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:08,900
I'm sorry we invaded you.
It was really un-cool.

675
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,800
Who cares? It's all in the past.

676
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,000
And hey - if I was going to
be invaded by anyone,

677
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,800
I am happy it was you.

678
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,600
You are really cool.
You have nice clothes.

679
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,600
You saved my white ass, Ali.

679
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:30,000
No problem.
Big up, the herbal tea, aiiight!

680
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,200
Hey you! Britain!

681
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,800
Respect.

682
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,000
How does he do it?

683
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,600
You know, we're quite a team Ali.

684
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,800
It's thanks to you,
we are 22 points ahead.

685
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,200
I'm going to save that center of yours.

686
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,700
Check out all the pepperami!

686
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:20,900
There're for, you Ali.

687
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,400
This is your moment.

688
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,900
Will you comment on accusations that
you drugged the leaders of the world?

689
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,400
You what?

690
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,900
We have evidence that proves you're guilty.

691
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,400
Well, we have evidence
that proves you're guilty.

692
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,700
This is just childish.

693
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,300
This is just childish.

694
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,200
Aren't you by employing this absurd, retorical
tactic merely incriminating yourself further?

695
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,600
Aren't you by dabadabda tactic
just simanama your father?

696
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,600
This bag was sent to my office
anonymously this morning.

697
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,400
Do you deny that you stole it from
customs and exiles?

698
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,100
That could be anyones.

699
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,800
What's it got to do with me, come on.

700
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
I has got to go.

701
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,900
I is actually touching cloth.

702
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,000
Ali, Ali!

703
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,000
Oh dear.
There you goes your leisure center.

704
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,200
Clear your desk before you go, will you?

705
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,200
Prime minister.

706
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:04,200
We'll miss you, Mr G.
Respect.

706
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,200
Mum?

707
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,800
Can I borrow your car?

708
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,700
Having a bad day?

709
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,300
Maybe I can help...

710
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,600
Is it nippy outside?

711
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:45,900
Very.

712
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,700
What is you doing here?

713
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,800
Let me show you.

714
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,800
So today's main news again.

715
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,700
The prime minister has resigned
after the discovery of a video tape

716
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,700
from a security camera showing
him having sexual intercourse

717
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,300
with an unknown prostitute.

718
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,400
That ain't no prostitute!
That's my hoe!

719
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,400
As of 11 o'clock this morning,
the deputy Prime Minister

720
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,900
David Carleton will be acting
Prime Minister.

721
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,600
Well, that ain't fair.
That weren't the P.M

722
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,400
Why aren't they showing
the rest of the tape?

723
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,000
Unfortunately, my boss has
locked it in the safe

724
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,100
at his new office at Chequers,
that's where it's staying.

725
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,400
You ain't gonna get away with this.

726
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,400
If you keep your month shut,

727
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,400
David's willing to be very generous.

728
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:36,400
I'm willing to be very generous.

729
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:43,800
All that you have to do
is keep your mouth shut.

730
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,200
I'm tuning up my engine, Ali.

731
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,600
Fill me with petrol!

732
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,300
I is gonna to pump you with my
five star unleaded, aiiight!

733
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,900
Let me see your nozzle.

734
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,100
What?

735
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,400
Oh, you wanna see my nob?

736
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,600
Alright.

737
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,200
Give me your fuel injection.

738
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,500
"...and in tomorrows phone in,
we'll be asking this question:"

738
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,200
"Have you ever slept with a pig?
I know I certaily have!"

738
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,200
"...and we'll be finding out what turns
girls like this into slugs..."

738
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,100
No one calls my Julie a slag!

739
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,300
Come to mama!

740
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,000
Take them off!

741
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,000
This ain't right.

742
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,200
Here set it to vibrate
and finish yourself off!

743
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,900
Open up, open up!
Your blood, I need your help!

744
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,300
Everyone on the tele
is calling my Julie a slag.

745
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,300
What I heard about her three header at ???


745
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,500
What three header?

745
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,700
Nothing.
-Anyways I can prove that she ain't

746
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,200
We've gotta restart Drive-by FM.
What do you say?

747
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,200
Drive-by FM is back on the road!

748
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,000
This is Drive-by FM

749
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,800
The sound of the ghetto coming to you
from deep in the heart of Barkshire

750
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,200
What was that?

751
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,800
Helicopter.

752
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,200
Hear me now, gangsters.
There is some serious shit going down.

753
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,400
The prime minister, check it,

754
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
has been chunked out
by a geezer

755
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,800
who is a massive dong.

756
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,400
He is even more eviller
than Skeletor!

757
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,000
To get the P.M. back in,

758
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,600
we needs to get hold of this tape
of me nobbin' my bitch.

759
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,700
If you help me rescue this video,
we can save the country.

759
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,100
Plus you will get to see
my Julie's babylons!

759
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,600
Oh, wicked!

759
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:38,300
That is why I is calling in all of you.
To end the Barkshire turf wars.

759
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,600
There's been enough brothers slain.

760
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,400
So put down your AKs.

761
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,000
Lay down your Uzis.

762
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:53,400
And unite into one massive
Massive!

763
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,500
And me never thought
me would ever say this:

763
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:14,000
But big up, the East Staines Massive.

763
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,000
Ali! What are you doing, man?!

764
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:27,600
If you join us.
Tonight I is prepared to hand over

764
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,500
the Borrester spider climbing frame
in Leargrove Park.

764
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:37,900
Let's do what Tupac and Biggie
never managed, alright.

765
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,600
Here it is, here it is!
If you wish joining us

765
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,800
for this military operation, then
meet up wearing your camouflage

765
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,500
and your combat gear. The venue is
outside John Nike Lesiure Center,

765
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,600
at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

765
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,800
Actually that's a bit early.
Can we make it 12?

766
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,200
Sorry I is late.

767
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,000
But there was something
on the tele about monkeys...

767
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,200
It was really funny...

768
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,800
Respect to all of you for
wearing your camouflage.

769
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,300
It will help you go undetected.

770
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,800
No let's go to Chequers
and rescue that tape.

771
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Let's do this for Britain.

772
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,000
Let's do this for my Julie.

773
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,100
And let's do this for hip hop.

773
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Selecta!
Selecta!

774
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,800
Hear me now. I has drawn up
a detailed plan of Checkers.

775
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,900
The tape is in the P.M's office.
In a safe.

776
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,800
First up, Ricky, Dave
and me will go in.

777
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,800
Jessie, you stay here.

778
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,600
We is gonna be like the A-team.

778
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,500
And I is B.A. Baraccas!

778
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,200
No, I wanna be B.A. Baraccas!

779
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,000
But I is very much like him!
"I ain't gettin' in no plane!"

779
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,200
Uhuh - "I ain't goin on no plane!"
- What?

779
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,400
"I ain't gettin' in no plane!"

779
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,200
"I ain't goin on no plane!"

779
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
"I ain't gettin' in no plane!"

779
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,800
"I ain't goin on no plane!"
- That's James Brown!

779
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,500
You'll be Murdoc,
and Dave, you'll be Face.

780
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,600
But what do we do?

780
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,900
You lot stay here,
and we all hide,

781
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,600
and blend in to the natural habitat.

782
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:34,100
Then when it gets dark,
me will make the secret signal

783
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,200
Let's go!

784
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,200
At that point you will tune in
all your radios

785
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,700
to the baddest speed-garage station,
and crank up the volume to the max!

786
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,400
This will bring out the guards.

787
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,300
And at that point, we will use our
cunning to over power them.

788
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,600
Sir?
-What the hell is going on?

788
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,600
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about sir,
but I'll send some men out to check.

789
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,300
See that you do. I want maximum security.
Patrol the house.

790
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,300
The great hall is exactly like the one
in Lara Croft's house

791
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,400
You know in Tomb Raider 2 in Playstation.

792
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,800
So Dave, if you run at the pillar that will
take us through to the underwater kingdom,

793
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,200
and on to the next level.

794
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,200
If for some reason that don't work,

795
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,600
we must find a way to cross the
"touch sensitive floor"

796
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,500
if we lift our feet at all,
we're dead!

797
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,800
Nothing. We'll keep on looking.

798
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Next up, we has gotta go through
the laser room.

799
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,500
Dave, you will use your
special skills to help us through.

800
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,000
Remember if we break
any of these beams,

801
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,700
it will set the alarms off.
So extra careful!

802
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,200
Now let's do it!

803
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,300
This must be the P.M's office.

804
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,500
The tape is in there.

805
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,800
Intruders in my offce.
This is a terrorist attack.

806
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,500
Shoot on sight.
Repeat, shoot on sight!

807
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,500
The safe. Yeah I is safe, man.
Open that.

807
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,500
The safe...
Yeah I is feelin' fine! Now open it!


808
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,800
Behind you!

809
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,800
Hold on, I thought you couldn't speak!

810
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It's not really that, I've always been
terribly embarrassed about my voice.

811
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,100
Alright, don't go on about it.

812
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,800
Stop giving it all that.

813
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,200
Now if me can just interrupt
your life story for one second.

814
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,200
Let's tie these geezers up,
and get that safe open.

815
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,700
No...
I've got it!

816
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,500
Why don't we link up the batteries
of all the cars outside here,

817
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,300
and then transfer an electrical current
through a human chain,

818
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,800
and blow this mother open!

819
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,200
But won't we get electrocolocuted?

820
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,200
Yeah, we'll blow the batteries,
but we won't get fried as long as the chain

821
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,200
don't break, cause we all wearing
rubber sole trainers ain't it?

822
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,000
Trust me, man!
I got a D in phsyic you know.

822
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
Wicked!

823
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,800
No, b82rez,
batteries!

823
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
2g4,
together!

824
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,500
Me was trying to save time.

825
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,400
Switch on the engine pass it on.

826
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,000
Switch on the engine pass it on.

827
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:22,100
Haha, your voice!
Switch on the engine pass it on.

828
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,200
Bitch on the pension,
suck my dong!

829
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,200
What?

830
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,800
Shall I turn the engine on?

831
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,600
Yeah.

832
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,500
What are you doing?
I can't help it! I'm beeing pulled!

833
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,200
No!

834
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,400
Peace, man.
-Peace.

835
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:34,700
The tape ain't there!

835
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,600
What are you talking about?
-Look for yourself!

836
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,200
All there is is some photographes...

837
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,800
And there's a...
A map of Staines.

838
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,800
Jah Rastafari, Haile Selassi, I an' I!
They is extending the Heathrow Airport!

839
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,800
That means...
They is gonna destroy Staines.

840
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,100
And he is starting in 3 hours.

841
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,800
2 hours, 57 minutes to be precise.

842
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,000
Why has you gotta build this
terminal over Staines?

843
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,500
Because I have bought 600 acres
of land there. Can I have those please?

844
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,700
Now, don't try escaping from here because
this room doubles at a nuclear bunker

844
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:29,000
It is completely impenetrable
to the outside world.

845
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,200
And I've have forgotten to
put on the air supply.

846
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,900
Why don't you just nip outside
now and stick it on?

847
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,000
You know, you really are
unbelieveably stupid!

848
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:48,800
Hey!

849
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,000
What?
-Give me them plans!

850
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:06,000
Or what?
-Or nipple cripple, that's what!

850
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,600
Chinese burns!

851
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,900
You hit me on the nose,
you fucking nutcase!

852
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,300
I ain't being funny, but
you should look behind you

853
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,400
because there is like a thousand 
police officers behind you!

854
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,100
Look, look behind you!
There is Jennifer Lopez!

855
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,000
What? You wanna bone him
right this second,

855
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,800
'cause you is feeling so horny,
that if you don't get it now...

856
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,600
Look, there's 20 squid on the floor...

856
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,100
There is a squirrel with the head
of a chicken, and with fly...

856
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,600
...wings and everything...
It's just...

857
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,500
Is you gonna hit me again?
-Uhuh...

858
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,400
Now I'm going to shoot you.

859
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,700
This is from the people of Staines!

860
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,100
I think I followed through.

861
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,600
My Julie, are you there?

862
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,300
Me know what you must think of me.

863
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,400
I've been a piece of knob cheese.

864
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,800
But me got to save Staines, and
me can't do it on my own, and...

865
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,800
...and I has shat myself...

866
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,600
Shit! Ricky and Dave.

867
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,700
Ricky?

868
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:36,600
We thought that if we was gonna die,
we might as well give it a go...

869
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,600
Well, what's it like?

870
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,800
It's not bad, you know.

871
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Dave?
-Quite nice, actually.

872
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,600
We'll talk about this later.

873
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,300
Now we got to save Staines.

874
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,600
2 minutes? See you in the car?
-Alright, be quick,

875
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,800
the feds is coming, and
you don't wanna finish up inside!

876
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,500
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

877
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,900
Ali! I love you!!!

878
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,600
Julie!!!

879
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:35,800
Hello.

880
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,500
Ignore them and start
the demolition.

881
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,000
Wait! Don't listen to him!

882
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,300
He's a criminal!
And not even the good kind

883
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,200
that sells drugs and do drive-bys...

884
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,500
I has got proof here, that
he is trying to destroy Staines.

885
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,200
So what?
It's a shit-hole!

886
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,700
Arrest them.
-Oh shit.

887
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,600
We is going to jail!

888
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,200
Every day for the next 20 years,
we is gonna get bonged in the showers!

889
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,200
Hold it!
Release them.

889
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,300
Under what authority?

890
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:06,900
In case you've forgotten,
I am the acting prime minister.

891
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,500
You are the disgraced one.

892
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,800
Disgraced by you!

893
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,400
And this tape proves it.

894
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,700
Kate...
-No David.

895
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,300
When I first entered politics,

896
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,800
it was to create a better world.

897
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,400
A world of honesty, integrity and truth.

898
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,800
But somewhere along the way,
that vision was lost.

899
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,600
My dream was tornished,
and instead I discovered greed,

900
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:36,200
averseness and corruption...
-Boring!

901
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,900
Arrest him.

902
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,600
Enjoy your life with this fool.

903
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,300
You two deserve each other.

903
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,800
-Piss off!

904
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,200
And you can rest assured we're not
gonna build terminal 5 over Staines.

904
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:53,300
We're gonna demolish Slough instead.
-Wicked! 

905
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,100
As of right now, I'm gonna need
a new deputy prime minister

906
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,700
How would you feel about
being my right hand man?

907
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,800
Right hand man!
Batty-boy, batty-boy!

908
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:08,200
What do you say Ali?
-I has shown you the way.

909
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,400
You will have to carry on
the journey by yourself now.

910
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,400
As for me, I is gonna
stick with my posse.

911
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,400
And my bitch...
My lady.

912
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,800
-The end-

912
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,800
Actually, there is one thing
you could do for me...

912
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,800
This way, ambassador.

912
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,800
The crop is ready for inspection.

912
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,600
Good morning, ambassador.

912
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,600
Ambassador,
will you try the harvest?

912
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,400
This is good shit!

912
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,600
The man from Staines -
He say yeah!

912
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:41,000
Ice, please.

912
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:49,000
Ali, this is a great jacuzzi!
-That ain't the jacuzzi.

912
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,600
Sorry.

912
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,900
Bring her in.

912
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,200
Dance for me, bitch!

912
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:44,200
My Julie, me got something to ask you...

912
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:52,700
Will you make me
the happiest man in the world?

912
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,700
Yeah, I will!

912
01:17:58,200 --> 01:17:59,700
Let me shag her then!

912
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,900
So...
What did you think of the film?

912
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,500
It wasn't bad, was it?

912
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,800
It was easily better
than Harry Potter...

912
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,100
which me thought was very childish.

912
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,900
If you was watching this Potter,
I is better than you!

912
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:33,100
You probably ain't even slept with a girl!

912
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:38,600
I have slept with three...
And I got one of them to play with herself.

912
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:43,600
Anyways, whatever you thought of this film,
please tell your mates that it was wicked!

912
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:48,300
Cause if this flops,
me won't be able to get my nanny a new hip.

912
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,400
So the choice is yours,
no pressure...

912
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:57,000
Come in, nanny, I told them about it.
What?! You has fallen over again?

912
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,200
What, you've done the other one in as well!

912
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,300
Don't cry there, all mashed up,
a lump of bones!

912
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:09,400
Me will get you the cash
to make it better, somehow...

912
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:16,700
Don't be selfish.
Buy the merchandise and all...
