1
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,340
Can I play?

2
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,940
Do you have any marbles?

3
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,580
Yep.

4
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,820
OK.

5
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,980
Thanks.

6
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,460
You're welcome.

7
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,820
So, what's your name?

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,340
Louis. Yours?

9
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,780
Alan.

10
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,100
You're not from around here,
are you?

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,500
No. I'm here with my parents
for the day.

12
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,980
What?

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,140
What's over there?

14
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,660
Don't do that. We're not
even allowed to be here.

15
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,180
Come on.

16
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,820
Wait for me.

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,300
Let's go back down.

18
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,140
Nope.

19
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,660
Don't!

20
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,500
Alan, don't!

21
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,300
See? That wasn't so bad.

22
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,740
Just don't look down.

23
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,500
Louis!

24
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,460
Come on.

25
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,900
See? It's steady.

26
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,020
- Louis!
- I can't move!

27
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,660
Come on!

28
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,060
Alan, help!

29
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,380
Wait!

30
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,820
Here it comes. Just relax.

31
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,380
You're doing great now.

32
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,260
All right.
Now, just a couple more seconds.

33
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,180
Here it comes, sweetie.

34
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,940
Just keep breathing.

35
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,660
All right, the head's crowning.
Very good.

36
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,020
Excellent. Here we go.

37
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,620
One more big push, sweetie.

38
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,020
That's it. Now breathe.

39
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,940
It's coming.

40
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,420
Push, push, push!

41
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,500
Oh, here we go.

42
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,460
We have a boy.

43
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,900
Oh, is he OK?

44
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,340
- He's perfect.
- He's fine. He's fine.

45
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,260
A beautiful son.

46
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,180
Beautiful. He's beautiful.

47
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,260
- Are we OK?
- He's fine, honey.

48
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,740
- He's beautiful.
- Oh, he's perfect.

49
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,380
Congratulations, Dad.

50
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,145
Here he comes.

51
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,060
You did really well.

52
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,380
Oh, hi. Oh, it's OK.

53
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,540
Beautiful baby boy.
You did really well.

54
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,980
He's got his eyes open.
He's looking at you.

55
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,860
- What's his name?
- Danny.

56
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,740
Danny.

57
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,740
Danny, come here, sweetie.
Get away from the ants.

58
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,420
See, we have the best-fed ants
in the neighborhood.

59
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,860
Come on.

60
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,580
Have to do that later.

61
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,860
Jason, my guys took
your guy's gun.

62
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,060
Can't.
It's attached to his leg. See?

63
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,700
Oh, my God.

64
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,940
That's me, man.

65
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,660
That's me.

66
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,100
Danny, play nice
with your brother.

67
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,100
What's that music you're using?
I really dig it.

68
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,900
Whatever it is,
it's terrific, man.

69
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,180
It really...

70
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,540
I don't know...

71
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,820
suits his life somehow.

72
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,300
So, Danny, you still drawing?

73
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,460
Nope.

74
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,940
No? Didn't you want to grow up
to be an artist?

75
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,820
That's some
of the opening sequence.

76
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,580
The rest needs
some fixes and tweaks.

77
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,140
But right now, he's clocking in
at one hour and 40 minutes.

78
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,060
Yeah, that's cool.

79
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,580
I just wanted to have a look...

80
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,140
before the Rememory tomorrow.

81
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,700
You know.

82
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,820
You've done a hell of a job
with him, Mr. Hakman.

83
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,780
You've done
the son of a bitch right.

84
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,380
You're welcome.

85
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,620
I don't suppose...

86
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,940
There was a fishing trip
when we were 13.

87
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,500
Just Danny and I and Dad...

88
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,740
- At the cape.
- Yes, that one.

89
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,060
My God,
that day is still with me.

90
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,380
You requested it specifically.
It's there.

91
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,820
Well, I'll be off, then.

92
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,780
Closing Zoe project
D. Monroe, rough cut 6.

93
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,500
Opening D. Monroe, scene 127-Q.

94
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,060
Jesus Christ!

95
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,620
I told you to shut up!

96
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,660
Danny! Danny, stop!

97
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,060
You...

98
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,260
You deserve this, bitch!

99
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,780
No!

100
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,060
No! God! Please... please...

101
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,500
No! Stop! No! You're killing me!

102
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,900
Stop!

103
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,780
Scene 127-Q deleted.

104
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,700
EYE Tech introduces...

105
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,100
the ninth generation
of the Zoe implant...

106
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,380
from our family to yours.

107
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,460
Do you think
we'll be able to afford one?

108
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,340
Yep.

109
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,700
I hope so.

110
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,100
Well, we can save.
It's worth it, I think.

111
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,060
Excuse me.

112
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,300
This girl was a complete wreck.

113
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,220
Drinking, drugs,
in and out of schools.

114
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,580
Then she turns 21...

115
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,540
and she finds out
about her Zoe implant.

116
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,980
Complete 180. She's born again.

117
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,860
Her knowing that
someone would one day watch...

118
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,180
transforms her into this kind,
gentle, loving person.

119
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,260
So, what happened?

120
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,020
She committed suicide.

121
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,100
Took a dive off her balcony...

122
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,980
twenty-seven floors
straight onto her head.

123
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,740
The implant
was instantly vaporized.

124
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,500
Charming story, Hasan.
Please do go on.

125
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,140
Alan!
This is a rare treat.

126
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,540
Alan!

127
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,900
Michael, this is Alan Hakman.

128
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,060
- Hi.
- Hi.

129
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,660
It's an honor to meet you.

130
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,460
Mike is my new assistant.

131
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,780
What happened to Eddie?

132
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,500
Eddie freaked out on me.
Strung too tight.

133
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,020
Hey, Alan, have you seen these?

134
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,820
They are all over town.

135
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,220
These anti-Zoe hippies always
seemed a little crazy to me.

136
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,020
But now they just seem crazy.

137
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,180
Listen...

138
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,820
"It is not our place to see
through other people's eyes.

139
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,980
"That is for God and God alone."

140
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,980
Anyway, how's
the Monroe project coming?

141
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,220
Fine.

142
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,820
- Just fine?
- Just fine.

143
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,500
Michael,
it's your great privilege...

144
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,740
to meet this man.

145
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,100
He's the best cutter in town.

146
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,460
- Who's your assistant?
- I don't have an assistant.

147
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,340
I have a friend that's looking
to get into the racket.

148
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,460
I don't work with an assistant.

149
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,020
You have
something for me, Thelma?

150
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,260
Straight to business.

151
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,140
I got a job last week
that I passed on...

152
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,900
and I think
it's right up your alley.

153
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,620
You know Charles Bannister?

154
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,940
His widow
is looking for a cutter.

155
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,220
Bannister, the EYE Tech lawyer?

156
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,980
He was out jogging
and his heart collapsed.

157
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,020
Wait a minute.
EYE Tech let that footage out?

158
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,300
Jennifer Bannister
won the lawsuit against them...

159
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,180
and claimed
her husband's implant.

160
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,020
She insisted on having
her own cutter, too.

161
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,900
And with good reason.

162
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,380
We could have taken that job.

163
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,020
After Caldwell,
our schedule is wide open.

164
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,020
I don't like the ugly stuff.

165
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,340
It gives me nightmares.

166
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,060
And this pig Bannister...

167
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,220
he's human garbage.

168
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,940
I took one look at the footage
and sent it straight back.

169
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,140
She only hired me because
you were busy with Monroe.

170
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,780
It's you she really wants.

171
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,740
- I'm available.
- Good.

172
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,060
Our friend Alan...

173
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,060
that's his specialty,
so to speak.

174
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,900
If you can't bear
to look at it, he will.

175
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,660
I'll tell her
you'll come by tomorrow.

176
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,140
She'll be expecting you.

177
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,900
We should actually go.

178
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,700
Oh, yes.
Rememory is in two days...

179
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,620
and we're still cutting picture.

180
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,500
Goddamn last-minute jobs.

181
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,980
Thelma, come on.
It keeps you young.

182
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,740
Alan.

183
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,740
Hasan.

184
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,260
Oh, hey, Alan.
I've been working on...

185
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,380
this new sorting program
for the Guillotine...

186
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,340
and I would really love
to get your feedback on it.

187
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,860
Maybe another time.

188
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,260
Yeah, maybe some other time.

189
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,780
Put it in archives very gently.

190
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,020
- Sure.
- All right.

191
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,580
Delila,
is suicide under self-help?

192
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,860
What are you doing here?

193
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,620
I just wanted to talk.

194
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,460
I'm busy.

195
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,660
Store's still open.
It's the 11:30 rush.

196
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,940
Books are flying off the shelf.

197
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,340
We close in 20 minutes.

198
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,020
This is exciting.

199
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,500
You've never had me over before.

200
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,420
You've always
wanted to see my work.

201
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,180
Well, you're always working.

202
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,260
I'm curious about
what takes up all your time.

203
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,540
Guillotine.

204
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,460
You're like a mortician...

205
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,100
or a priest...

206
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,260
or a taxidermist.

207
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,900
All of them.

208
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,540
I mean...

209
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,380
you get to see life upon life.

210
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,460
Most of us get only one,
if that.

211
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,620
What are people's lives like?

212
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,140
Do they make any sense?

213
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,100
It all seems so massive
and so random.

214
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,140
Have you ever been
to a Rememory?

215
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,300
No. Well...

216
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,100
Once, a few years ago.

217
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,380
Whose?

218
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,700
My ex-boyfriend.

219
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,820
But I couldn't take it.
I didn't stay.

220
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,260
Why not?

221
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,500
Because it just wasn't...

222
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,180
It wasn't him.

223
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,500
And I wanted
to remember him my way.

224
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,060
Sit down.

225
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,580
Thank you.

226
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,620
It's like
you read my mind, Alan.

227
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,260
I have this recurring dream
where I'm aging backwards.

228
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,540
Wow.

229
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,620
What about all the bits
in between?

230
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,060
It's a miniature.

231
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,700
Concise, symmetrical.

232
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,020
That's the way the world
looks to me...

233
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,420
the way I see it.

234
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,100
How do you do this?

235
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,900
It's what I was meant to do.

236
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,860
You were meant
to live your own life, too.

237
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,780
- Hey.
- Hey.

238
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,940
The house was big...

239
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,380
enormous...

240
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,180
like this one.

241
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,700
We didn't care
whose house it was.

242
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,820
It felt dangerous to be there.

243
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,140
It felt exciting.

244
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,500
I can see the grass.

245
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,020
I can hear it
crunching beneath our feet.

246
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,980
And then the sprinklers
came on...

247
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,340
all around us...

248
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,460
and we ran.

249
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,780
I remember that
like it was yesterday.

250
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,780
Do you recall any moments
with your daughter?

251
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,340
This isn't long ago.

252
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,260
We were watching Isabel
in a school talent show.

253
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,420
She was wonderful that night.

254
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,780
I think Charles and I
both felt...

255
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,620
what an amazing thing
a family was.

256
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,620
We felt it together.

257
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,820
She was up there on that stage.

258
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,900
Oh, goodness.

259
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,140
Excuse me.

260
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,820
I know this is very hard,
Mrs. Bannister...

261
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,580
but it's important.

262
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,140
It's the foundation
of a cutter's work.

263
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,060
I need you and your family...

264
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,900
to help me choose
those moments you want to keep.

265
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,020
I won't be able to do
your husband justice...

266
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,940
if I don't understand him
through you.

267
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,860
I heard you were the best...

268
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,340
that you would know
how to handle Charles.

269
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,220
My husband was a great man,
Mr. Hakman.

270
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,420
He deserves to be remembered
as a great man.

271
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,620
After my initial cut...

272
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,580
I will need
to speak with Isabel.

273
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,340
Is that necessary?

274
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,020
There's nothing that
any one of you can tell me...

275
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,860
that I won't know very soon.

276
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,820
Of course. Yes.

277
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,820
Rom.

278
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,540
Please call EYE Tech storage.

279
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,780
Tell them Mr. Hakman
will be dropping by.

280
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,380
Very good, ma'am.

281
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,780
Thank you.

282
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,860
I've...

283
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,220
I've seen Rememories
where the cutters were careless.

284
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,140
They had no respect
for the dead.

285
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,140
The dead mean nothing to me,
Mrs. Bannister.

286
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,500
I took this project
because I respect the living.

287
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,820
Remember for yourself!

288
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,860
Live for today!

289
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,300
You are blasphemous, you freak!

290
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,020
Why don't you people go home?

291
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,380
Just go home! Show some respect!

292
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,820
Open your eyes!

293
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,780
I'm sorry, Mrs. Monroe.
It's never been this bad before.

294
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,660
So... this is him, huh?

295
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,420
That's him.

296
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,980
Caroline, are you all right?

297
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,140
You did very well.

298
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,340
Oh, hi. Oh, it's OK.

299
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,380
He's got his eyes open.
He's looking at you.

300
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,460
- What's his name?
- Danny.

301
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,500
- Hi, Danny.
- Oh, careful.

302
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,100
Hey, Daniel,
we got some visitors for you.

303
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,900
Look. Everybody's here. Look.

304
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,940
- There's your grandma.
- Look. That's Grandma.

305
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,700
How are you feeling, Eliza?

306
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,100
I'm good. I'm really good.

307
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,820
- Excellent.
- Look what I made.

308
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,060
That looks really good, Danny.

309
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,740
Now go wash out your brush.

310
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:02,460
Hi!

311
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,580
Come on, Uncle.
Bring a steak for us.

312
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,180
Sit in the shade, honey.

313
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,100
So, Danny, you still drawing?

314
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,300
Nope.

315
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,140
No? Didn't you want to grow up
to be an artist?

316
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,620
Not anymore.

317
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,340
No?
What did you want to be, then?

318
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,500
A doctor.

319
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,020
A doctor, eh? Clever kid.

320
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,620
That'll keep you in the bucks.

321
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,100
Why a doctor?

322
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,140
Because I want to help people
when they're hurt.

323
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,900
Would you listen to
this little kid?

324
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,820
You got a good heart, Danny.

325
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,700
And that's all you need in life.

326
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,300
Come on. Be a good boy
and eat your lunch.

327
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,500
Now I make the incision here.

328
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,380
Hand me the number 17, please.

329
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,380
Actually, Professor,
I think the number 12...

330
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,260
would be more appropriate.

331
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,460
Yes. Correct. The number 12.

332
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,060
Thank you, Mr. Monroe.

333
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,700
Hello there.
I'm Dr. Daniel Monroe.

334
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:09,740
I've seen you around
the hospital these last few days

335
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,540
and I couldn't help but notice
the most beautiful woman here.

336
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,300
I was wondering if maybe
you'd like to join me...

337
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,220
for dinner sometime.

338
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,940
That might be nice.

339
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,460
You lasted longer
than I thought you would.

340
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,940
Come on, Danny boy.

341
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,020
It's a strange profession
you have, isn't it, Alan?

342
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,740
You take people's lives,
make lies out of them.

343
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,140
Fletcher.
It's been a long time.

344
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,860
Eight years.

345
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,820
Yeah. I don't have time
to catch up right now.

346
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,940
Come on! Speech!

347
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,340
- Say something.
- Speech.

348
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,860
I want to thank all of you.
I mean that.

349
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,740
This is the best birthday
I have ever had.

350
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,860
How can you handle it, Alan?

351
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,780
People sleeping and shitting...

352
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,180
people stealing
from each other...

353
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,660
manipulating each other...

354
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,020
the obscenity.

355
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,380
I can't talk. I'm working.

356
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,420
Well, now... I'm hurt.

357
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,660
That's not why I'm here.

358
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,380
I'm booked solid
for the next two months.

359
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,900
No, no, no.
I don't have a job lead for you.

360
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,920
You do have something
that I need, though.

361
00:27:33,955 --> 00:27:35,860
What could I possibly have
that you want?

362
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,860
I know you've taken
the Bannister project...

363
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,780
and I want it.

364
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,780
Wow. I thought
you'd given up cutting.

365
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,300
I'm offering you
$500,000 in cash.

366
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,900
Oh, what? The code?

367
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,460
Would you forget
the damn code and grow up?

368
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,220
This is real life now.

369
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,460
Hey, did you change
the color of our fishing boat?

370
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,580
- I would never do that.
- Are you sure?

371
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,900
Because I remember
it being green, not red.

372
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,660
Weird. All my memories
in that boat...

373
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:32,140
have it being green.
It just blew my mind.

374
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,060
Maybe it was green.

375
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
Will you excuse me?
I have to go.

376
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,820
OK. Rush, rush, rush.

377
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,100
Beautiful work, Mr. Hakman.

378
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,940
I'll keep you in mind for me.

379
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,980
Ah, yes, the questions.
"I remember it differently.

380
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,380
"Are you sure
that's what happened?"

381
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,060
Some of us still
live by the code, Fletcher.

382
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,460
We didn't walk away.
We have what it takes.

383
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,700
And what does it take, Alan?

384
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,340
Delusion? Obsession? Guilt?

385
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,060
No, I don't have any of those...

386
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,820
not as much as you do.

387
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,660
I'll be in touch.

388
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,300
Wait!

389
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,540
He was such a good father, too.

390
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,620
When his son had the mumps?
Oh, my God!

391
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,900
My heart was in my throat.

392
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,420
That part with the partners.
Could you believe that?

393
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,660
It's the Rememory
your husband deserved, Caroline.

394
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,100
He really was someone special.

395
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,820
Thank you, Nathalie.

396
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,700
Yeah! Danny! Danny!

397
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,140
Excuse me.

398
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,620
Mr. Hakman.

399
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,340
Mrs. Monroe.

400
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,420
Why are they tattooed like that?

401
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,180
I'm not sure.

402
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,060
They're so grotesque,
aren't they?

403
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,660
Sorry about your loss.

404
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,540
Thank you.

405
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,020
Look! It's the cutter!

406
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,020
Open your eyes!

407
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,180
Hey! Back off! Back off!

408
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,140
Keep your distance.

409
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,420
Receiving Zoe footage,
Charles Bannister.

410
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:13,500
Processing 544,628 life hours.

411
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,740
Sorting life files.

412
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,580
Childhood...

413
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,900
sleep...

414
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,660
puberty...

415
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,580
eating...

416
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,460
awkward phase...

417
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,660
romantic life...

418
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,180
temptation...

419
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,100
personal hygiene...

420
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,940
religion...

421
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,700
tragedy...

422
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,540
wedding...

423
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,540
masturbation...

424
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,340
fears...

425
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,460
athletics...

426
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,260
growth spurt...

427
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,220
university...

428
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,380
violence...

429
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,620
school...

430
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,140
courtship...

431
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,700
career...

432
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,820
...these documents...

433
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,180
and I'm quite concerned
about EYE Tech's liability.

434
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,260
I think if any of this
were to get out...

435
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,060
it could be quite devastating.

436
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,780
We do have $1.2 billion
that we wish to invest...

437
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,660
and I'm just wondering,
with EYE Tech, if there's...

438
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,260
What do you think?

439
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,220
I love it. Thank you, Charles.

440
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,780
Hey, Joey, come help me
build a sandcastle.

441
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,225
Here. Use my shovel.

442
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,460
Happy anniversary, honey.

443
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,420
Is it keys?

444
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,860
Hi, baby. You still awake?

445
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,340
No.

446
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,380
Daddy loves you so much.

447
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,180
You know that.

448
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,740
I love you, too, Dad.

449
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,220
Do you want to come down
to my study?

450
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,060
I'd like to show you
what I'm working on.

451
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,940
What are you working on?

452
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,980
It's a new case. Come on.

453
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,460
OK.

454
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,060
So, how was school today?

455
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:56,220
Good. We read a book
about Kipper, the Sparky Dog.

456
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,180
Kipper, the Sparky Dog?

457
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,180
He's a very happy dog.

458
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,420
Daddy?

459
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,860
What, sweetie?

460
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,300
Can I have a pet?

461
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,180
Well, maybe. What kind of pet?

462
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,780
Maybe a kitty.

463
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,700
A kitty? Of course.

464
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,700
Go on in, honey.

465
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,300
- Daddy?
- Yes, sweetie?

466
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,660
I want to go back to bed.

467
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,820
In a little while, baby.

468
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,380
In a little while.

469
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:07,740
Daddy loves you so much.
You know that.

470
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,860
And I love you, too, Dad.

471
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,020
Thank you.

472
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,380
Wasn't she wonderful?

473
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,260
- You look lovely, honey.
- Thank you.

474
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,340
I'll tell Rom to bring up
some more champagne.

475
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,460
- Fine.
- Would you like one, sir?

476
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,940
No, thank you.

477
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,740
Isabel wanted to stay up
and say hello...

478
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,700
but the poor thing fell asleep.

479
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,260
It's a beautiful picture.

480
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,220
She's a very bright little girl.

481
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,380
Yes, she is.
Jennifer and I are very lucky.

482
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,900
We're very fortunate.

483
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,460
We're looking forward
to spending...

484
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,620
So, what's your name?

485
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,220
Louis. Yours?

486
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,700
Alan.

487
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,860
Identity match.

488
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,780
Searching.

489
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,100
Come on.

490
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,820
No, I can't move.

491
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,620
I can't move!

492
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,340
I know you've taken
the Bannister project...

493
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,580
and I want it.

494
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,180
I found something, Delila.

495
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,140
I mean, in a new project.

496
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,540
Something very important,
and I have to explore it.

497
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,260
It's...

498
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,500
A new cutting project?

499
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,020
That's what you're talking
to me about, Alan?

500
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,500
Well, more than that.

501
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,740
Alan,
you've seen so much life...

502
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,940
and somehow you miss the point.

503
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,060
I mean, I haven't
even heard from you...

504
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,140
since that night
at your apartment.

505
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,780
I need you.

506
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,860
Why?

507
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,540
Why do you need me?

508
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,420
There's no place for me
with you.

509
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,540
You haven't even made room
for yourself.

510
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:14,020
You have to separate yourself
from that machine.

511
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,940
Yeah. Yeah.

512
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,380
Alan?

513
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,340
Alan.

514
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,540
You look like shit.

515
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,020
What happened to your face?

516
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,700
This? Rather not elaborate.
Come in.

517
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,860
I mean, you decided
that this scene, this event...

518
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,820
is what made this woman
who she was.

519
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,820
You've taken
this woman's entire life...

520
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,740
and drawn a straight line
from this particular moment.

521
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,660
How can you make
a decision like that?

522
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,220
Whittling a life down to one...

523
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,620
Michael, we have to make
story decisions.

524
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,540
Otherwise,
there will be no Rememories.

525
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,700
Yeah, I still don't buy it.

526
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,620
You don't have to buy it.

527
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,180
You just have to do it.
Trust me.

528
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,660
Alan, darling, you look spooked.

529
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,940
Sorry about the place.
The kid's mess.

530
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:29,500
I need to speak with you alone.

531
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,140
Michael, honey, would you
run down to the store...

532
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,060
and buy us some cigarettes?

533
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,580
We've got eight packs already.

534
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,300
Then go and return them,
sweetheart.

535
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,820
We don't need so many.

536
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,460
He's an emotional one.

537
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,340
Now... are you all right?

538
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,900
I saw Fletcher yesterday.

539
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,380
Really?

540
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,780
Yeah.

541
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,580
Fletcher.

542
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,340
Now, he was a great assistant.

543
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,260
What happened to him
after he quit?

544
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,180
He seems changed.

545
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,100
We kept in touch
for a few years...

546
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,980
and then his sister Laura...
You remember Laura.

547
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,780
She had a son,
died of leukemia.

548
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,620
He was only twelve.
She never got over it.

549
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,140
She spent days and days watching
his unedited Zoe footage...

550
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,020
stopped speaking to everyone.

551
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,500
And then she didn't even
recognize who Fletcher was.

552
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,580
After that, he dropped off
the map completely.

553
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,060
Think he could be involved
with anti-implant groups?

554
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,900
I've heard rumors...

555
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,900
talk of them being organized
by an ex-cutter.

556
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,300
I never thought
it could be Fletcher.

557
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,100
He wants to buy
Bannister's footage.

558
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:55,140
These anti-implant groups have
become like religious fanatics.

559
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,140
They gave Michael one hell
of a beating last night.

560
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,860
So it's not just talk anymore.

561
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,620
You know,
if they want Bannister's life...

562
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,580
the bastard's
not worth fighting for.

563
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,820
Give the footage
back to his widow.

564
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,020
Let her deal with it.

565
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,500
I can't give it back.

566
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,220
There's someone in that project
I haven't seen for years.

567
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,660
I hate when that happens.

568
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,545
Oh, yeah.

569
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,300
He's at a party, in a crowd...

570
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,260
never mentioned by name.

571
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,145
I've got to find him, though.

572
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,540
He's not a main character
in Bannister's life.

573
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:25,980
It'll take
the Guillotine days...

574
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,820
to track his face
through the footage.

575
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,500
Who is this person?

576
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,980
Just someone from my childhood.

577
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,420
Bannister's life
is my only lead.

578
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,660
OK. Go through the family,
snoop around...

579
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,740
tell them you're doing research
for the project.

580
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,180
It might be faster
than waiting for the Guillotine.

581
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,020
Be careful, Alan.

582
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
So...

583
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,060
how is it that you and I
know each other again?

584
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,700
We don't.

585
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,220
That's the wrong answer, pal.

586
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,900
We share a mutual friend.
Billy Finch.

587
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,980
Billy who?

588
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,780
Don't play games.
I know you better than that.

589
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,860
I know all
your little secrets, Oliver.

590
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,140
How do you know my name?

591
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,380
I know that you suffocated
those kittens when you were 13.

592
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,060
I know that that scar on
your head was self-inflicted...

593
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,500
and I know
that you sold Billy the gun...

594
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,580
that he killed his brother with.

595
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,500
They say that friends
help you move...

596
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,220
but good friends help you
move bodies, don't they?

597
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,660
I just want what Billy wanted.

598
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,180
A gun.

599
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,620
Take it. Take it.

600
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,380
And these. Take these.

601
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,580
Take them all.

602
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,380
Please go, OK? Just go.

603
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,940
Thank you, Ollie.

604
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,780
Take care.

605
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,300
I'm here.

606
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,540
Is this why you wanted
to meet me here?

607
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,180
I thought
it would be safer this way.

608
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,180
How's Thelma doing?

609
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,060
I can't give you Bannister,
and you know I can't.

610
00:44:37,095 --> 00:44:39,620
It's unbelievable,
when you think about it.

611
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,620
One in twenty of these people
has an implant.

612
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,100
How will that baby remember
his mother years from now?

613
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,660
Will he remember the special
moments between them...

614
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,660
or moments someone like you
decides are special?

615
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,180
My job is
to help people remember...

616
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,180
what they want to remember,
Fletcher.

617
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,100
Ah. Oh, that's noble.

618
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,060
But I don't think you understand
the scope of the damage.

619
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,460
There is no way to measure...

620
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,660
the profound effect
the Zoe implant has had...

621
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,660
on the way
people relate to each other.

622
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,580
"Am I being filmed?
Should I say this or not?

623
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,700
"What'll they think in 30 years
if I do this or that?"

624
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,500
What about the simple right
not to be photographed?

625
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,380
The right not to pop up
in some guy's Rememory...

626
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,300
without even knowing
you were being filmed?

627
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,940
I didn't invent the technology.

628
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,340
If people didn't want it,
they wouldn't buy it, Fletcher.

629
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,980
It fulfills a human need.

630
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,940
Alan, you take murderers
and make them saints.

631
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,260
That's why we need
Charles Bannister.

632
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,660
He was a public figure
for EYE Tech...

633
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,105
their star attorney...

634
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,540
well respected,
loved his family...

635
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,660
gave to charity, and if
you get through with him...

636
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,860
that's all
anyone will ever know.

637
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,380
But Bannister is
the first EYE Tech employee...

638
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,660
whose implant has left
the confines of the corporation.

639
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,260
His widow fought for that.

640
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,340
We know she's hiding something
about him and his daughter...

641
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,860
and we're gonna find it.

642
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,460
EYE Tech's hands aren't clean.

643
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,180
Bannister's implant is evidence.

644
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,860
So you want to destroy
EYE Tech with a scandal?

645
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,740
Absolutely.
The press would go apeshit.

646
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,060
He's the perfect candidate.

647
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,940
I must have his footage.

648
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,220
Is this about your sister?

649
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,020
Don't even say her name.

650
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,460
You don't know anything
about that.

651
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,105
She has nothing to do with it.

652
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,820
These implants
distort personal history...

653
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,740
and therefore all history...

654
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,460
and I will not stand by
while the past is rewritten...

655
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,180
for the sake
of pleasant Rememories.

656
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,540
Tell me something.

657
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,460
Why is your name
the first on the list...

658
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,980
for cutting
scumbags and lowlifes?

659
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,980
Because I forgive people
long after...

660
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,700
they could be punished
for their sins.

661
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,300
I know what you do.

662
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,660
Why do you do it?

663
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,260
Do you know
what a sin eater is?

664
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,740
It's part of
an ancient tradition.

665
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,140
When someone would die,
they would call for a sin eater.

666
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,820
Sin eaters were
social outcasts, marginals.

667
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,100
They would lay out the body...

668
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,300
put bread and salt
on the chest...

669
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,100
coins upon the eyes.

670
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,300
The sin eater would eat
the bread and salt...

671
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,220
take the coins as payment.

672
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,100
By doing this,
the eater absorbed...

673
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,860
the sins of the deceased,
cleansing their soul...

674
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,060
and allowing them safe passage
into the afterlife.

675
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,780
That was their job.

676
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,540
And what about the sin eater...

677
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:26,580
who bears the burden
of all those wrongs?

678
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,380
Are you worried
about my soul, Fletcher?

679
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,500
I will have Bannister.

680
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,980
I can't give him to you.

681
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,020
You see that man behind me?

682
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,620
I don't want to bring him
into this conversation...

683
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,700
but I will if you leave me
no other choice.

684
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,180
Alan!

685
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,540
Alan!

686
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,060
Do you remember the moment...

687
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,980
you first fell in love
with your husband?

688
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,460
Goodness. How can you answer
a question like that?

689
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,425
The pier?

690
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,940
Yes, the pier.

691
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,420
He had taken me down
to the pier.

692
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,060
It was springtime.

693
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,980
We were walking,
and he was going on...

694
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,460
This was during college?

695
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,020
Yes, I was in college...

696
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,940
and I remember,
I looked up at him...

697
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,540
and I thought,
this is the man...

698
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,700
I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

699
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,340
I just have one more question.

700
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,580
There was a man
at one of your parties.

701
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,660
- A man?
- Yes. A man with glasses.

702
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,860
You may have noticed them.
They're very thick glasses.

703
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,420
Thick glasses?

704
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,580
Mr. Hakman,
how is this relevant?

705
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,540
Minor people I don't even know
have no place in the Rememory.

706
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,420
Family...

707
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,020
career...

708
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,620
community.

709
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:10,020
That's all I want.
Cut everything else.

710
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,540
Maybe I could speak with Isabel?

711
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,300
Right now?

712
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,900
It would be very helpful.

713
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,340
Yes, of course.

714
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,500
Isabel?

715
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,780
Remember what I told you?

716
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,500
Mr. Hakman wants
to talk to you about Daddy.

717
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,540
It's for Daddy's Rememory.

718
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,700
Mrs. Bannister?

719
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,940
We have a problem
with the caterers.

720
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,740
Hi, Isabel.

721
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,700
Hello, Mr. Hakman.

722
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,940
"Mr. Hakman."
That's very formal.

723
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,700
My name is Alan.

724
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,700
Beautiful house.
What's going on in there?

725
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,100
Birthday party for Mr. Froggy.

726
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,540
Do you think Mr. Froggy
would mind...

727
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,460
if I took you away
from the party for a minute?

728
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,260
OK.

729
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,100
Who's that in your arms?

730
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,700
My doll.

731
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,020
Oh. What's her name?

732
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,860
She doesn't have a name.
She's just a doll. See?

733
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,940
Isabel, your daddy...

734
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,980
My daddy is the best daddy
in the world.

735
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,340
He had a really big meeting
one day...

736
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,300
but instead,
he took me horseback riding.

737
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:47,260
He would read me stories
before bed every night.

738
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,980
Sometimes he would make it up
as he went along...

739
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,620
and I knew, but I didn't care.

740
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,820
Your mom said I was here
to talk about your dad.

741
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,220
But we don't have to do that
if you don't want.

742
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,300
I don't want.

743
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,020
OK. Then we won't.

744
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,020
When I was a little older
than you...

745
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,300
I lost both my parents.

746
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,980
Not many people
know what you're feeling.

747
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,500
Not many people understand.

748
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,180
But I do.

749
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,420
You don't want me nosing around,
asking questions.

750
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,380
And you're right.

751
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,180
OK.

752
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,740
Alan...

753
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,340
it's not really
Mr. Froggy's birthday.

754
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,580
It's in a week.

755
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,780
Can I ask one question?
And then I'm gone.

756
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,380
There was a man at
one of your parents' parties.

757
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,300
The thing that's special
about this man...

758
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,020
is he wore glasses
that were very, very thick.

759
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,900
They're almost like the bottom
of a glass bottle.

760
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,420
Mr. Hunt.
I took him the invitation.

761
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,020
Mr. Hunt?

762
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,460
Was his name Louis Hunt?

763
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,020
He was my teacher.

764
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,420
Really? What does he teach?

765
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,260
He doesn't teach anymore.

766
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,940
He died in a car accident
a year ago.

767
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,300
It was very sad.

768
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,700
Did you have a Rememory,
like for your father?

769
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,020
I don't know.

770
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,980
We just had a day at school
where we talked about him.

771
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,340
Thank you, Isabel.

772
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,060
Alan?

773
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,620
Are you gonna fix
what my daddy can remember?

774
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,220
In a way... yes.

775
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,460
Can you make him forget
that I...

776
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,300
that I drew on
his contract with crayon?

777
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,140
I will.

778
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:01,180
And that I pulled
Dottie's hair so hard...

779
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,260
that she cried.
Will he forget that?

780
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,220
He'll forget.

781
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,420
But make sure you don't.

782
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,900
Hey, Alan...

783
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,020
would you relax?

784
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,980
There's nobody
following us, all right?

785
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,740
This is a really big favor
I'm doing for you.

786
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,260
You're lucky my cousin Karim
is working late tonight.

787
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,620
Thank you.

788
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,700
So, what's this guy's name?

789
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,060
Louis Hunt.

790
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:43,940
If he had an implant...

791
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,820
there will be a record
of it in here.

792
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,860
I could lose my job,
letting cutters in here.

793
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,180
Come on, Karim.
Would I get you in trouble?

794
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,540
They can track anyone
accessing data from a computer,

795
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,980
so this is the best I can do.
Please hurry.

796
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,620
Wait.

797
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,940
These are genealogies.

798
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,980
I don't know his family tree.
How do I use this?

799
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,860
Hard copies are
sorted by series numbers...

800
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,300
alphabetically on the boxes...

801
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,260
and then arranged
by implant date.

802
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,180
He's the same age as I am...

803
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,780
so it would be a 1500 series.

804
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:52,220
2000. Oh, great.

805
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,740
Hunt.

806
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,700
No Hunt.

807
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,060
Alan!

808
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,180
Alan, are you OK?

809
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,780
I'm fine.

810
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,220
OK.

811
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,460
Hello, Mr. And Mrs. Hakman...

812
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:58,780
and welcome
to the EYE Tech family.

813
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:01,140
You've made
an important decision.

814
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:05,340
You've purchased a Zoe implant
for your unborn son.

815
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,860
What does that mean?

816
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,300
Immortality.

817
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,860
No longer do our most cherished
moments together...

818
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,060
have to fade
and disappear over time.

819
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:20,140
Remember, the Zoe implant
is entirely organic...

820
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,660
and since it grows...

821
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,900
with your baby's brain
and nerve centers...

822
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:27,580
it's virtually undetectable.

823
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,140
When is the right time
to tell your child...

824
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,700
about their miraculous gift?

825
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,100
By their 21st birthday...

826
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:38,340
most carriers are
mature enough to understand...

827
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,700
and from then on,
your son can live his life...

828
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,700
knowing
that always and forever...

829
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:50,180
his experiences and adventures
will be revisited and relished,

830
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:53,380
and that's what
great memories are made of.

831
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,620
Congratulations.

832
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,620
Oh, my God. That's me, man.

833
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,700
That's me.

834
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,500
You take people's lives,
make lies out of them.

835
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:04,300
My daddy is the best daddy
in the world.

836
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,300
It's unbelievable
when you think about it.

837
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,260
One in twenty of these people
has an implant.

838
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,780
When is the right time
to tell your child...

839
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,300
about their miraculous gift?

840
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:15,180
What are people's lives like?
Do they make any sense?

841
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,940
It all seems so massive
and so random.

842
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,380
This is real life now.

843
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,300
Don't do that. We're not even
allowed to be here.

844
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,540
You take murderers
and make them saints.

845
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,380
Everybody's here!

846
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,220
- Just someone from my childhood.
- Remember for yourself!

847
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,460
What about the sin eater
bears the burden...

848
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,340
Get out of my head!

849
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,140
Oh, no.

850
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:55,300
Oh, Alan...

851
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:58,220
your phone call had me
so worried.

852
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,180
I saw the mirror.

853
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,900
What happened to you?

854
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,020
I saw something.

855
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,980
All right.

856
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:14,660
You cannot let your work
get to you like this.

857
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,900
Please don't leave.

858
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,620
What have you got to eat
in this dump?

859
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,820
Not much.

860
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,220
Try looking in the cupboards.

861
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,660
The cupboard.

862
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,780
I saw that in a project
I was working on.

863
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,380
An herbalist.
It looked interesting.

864
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,980
That's disgusting.

865
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,660
Well...

866
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,900
I guess we order out, then.

867
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,300
I want to show you something.

868
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,140
I've never shown it to anyone.

869
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:54,540
What is this?

870
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,300
Some implants have a defect.

871
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:58,660
They can't differentiate
between what the eye sees...

872
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,580
and what the mind sees.

873
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,500
What?

874
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,820
What were these? Dreams?

875
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,300
Yeah, dreams.
Daydreams. Hallucinations.

876
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,220
It's so beautiful.

877
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,220
Where are you off to, Alan?

878
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,980
Let's do this.

879
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,900
Oh, no. Not now.

880
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,540
There's somebody up there.

881
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,980
This has to be clean.
No mess.

882
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,220
Clean, dirty.
It's all the same to me.

883
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,300
I think he's a cutter.
You want to do him?

884
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,660
Yeah, I'll do him.

885
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,660
Hi.

886
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,020
You can follow her.

887
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,940
Now, you know how this works?

888
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,620
No, not at all.

889
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,780
OK. We draw synth tattoos...

890
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,540
with electrosynthetic ink.

891
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,660
And it creates
a magnetic field...

892
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,020
which interferes
with the Zoe implant...

893
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:24,540
blocking it from recording
audio or video...

894
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:27,420
from that point on.

895
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,820
Now, first
we do the audio tattoo...

896
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,900
and we wait a week.

897
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:38,300
If you don't get a migraine
and your system takes it...

898
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,900
then we'll do the video tattoo.

899
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,820
Do I have to cover
my whole face?

900
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,020
No.

901
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:52,060
Those guys...
they're just young and angry.

902
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:55,740
You want it discreet.

903
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,820
Very.

904
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,780
Yeah.

905
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,820
Will this hurt?

906
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,660
Oh, yeah.

907
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,980
Fletcher?

908
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,460
I'm armed.

909
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,060
What's the matter, Delila?

910
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,340
You know
that recurring dream I have?

911
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,700
You know
that recurring dream I have?

912
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:53,020
Where I get younger and younger?
I had it again.

913
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,780
I make you happy?

914
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:56,740
Yeah.

915
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,740
Well, I make myself miserable.

916
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,060
That's just
because you're silly.

917
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,700
You're silly.

918
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:08,700
How can you not be happy
right now?

919
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:13,980
I think the first books I read
were really, really sad.

920
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,660
Why do they make
children's books so sad?

921
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,740
They're always terribly tragic.

922
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,300
Not so hard to make
this thing play disks.

923
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,420
Not so hard at all.

924
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:34,340
- Delila...
- Shut up!

925
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,300
That was my old boyfriend,
you bastard.

926
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,580
Is that why you wanted
to be with me?

927
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,900
Because you saw some proof
that I'm to your liking?

928
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:45,100
No.

929
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:47,020
These moments...

930
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,060
they belong to me, Alan.

931
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,180
The good and the bad.

932
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,340
They're mine and his!

933
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:59,860
Who are you to take them
away from me?

934
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,500
No! No! Don't touch me!

935
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,820
A gun.

936
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:10,020
Who are you?

937
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,140
Please, please, no.

938
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,340
Who are you, Alan?

939
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,300
No! No!

940
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,820
No!

941
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:24,580
Why did you do that?

942
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,140
Mine!

943
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,900
You're still here.

944
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,940
Alan, this thing is junked.

945
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,060
The implant itself is severed.

946
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,940
God himself could not
retrieve that footage...

947
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:11,460
and you know that.

948
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,940
Then we have to access
a different life.

949
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:17,100
OK. Well, where is it?

950
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:21,980
My implant.

951
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,425
What?

952
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:24,980
The one in my head.

953
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,140
You want to take a shot, too?

954
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,460
Everybody else has.

955
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,060
I deserved that one.

956
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:45,020
You deserve a lot more
than that, Hakman.

957
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:46,700
Why didn't you tell us, Alan?

958
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:50,020
Because I didn't know until
I found the files at EYE Tech.

959
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,540
I never thought my parents
could afford one.

960
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:55,180
Turns out,
they took a loan to get it.

961
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,500
How could you not know?

962
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,740
Because they died before
they told me.

963
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,620
They never got around to it.

964
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,220
You know the code, Alan.
It's one of our central tenets.

965
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:08,100
A cutter
cannot have a Zoe implant.

966
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:11,940
I need to access that footage.
I need it right now.

967
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,220
Yeah? Well, that's impossible.

968
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,620
Oh, no, it's possible.

969
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,780
It was done before by you.

970
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:20,500
An attempt to access footage
while a carrier was still alive.

971
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:22,980
Yeah. I performed that...

972
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,900
and the woman
never recovered, Alan.

973
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:28,820
And I will not try that again.

974
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:31,820
Then you know what it's like
to be haunted.

975
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:33,460
One memory...

976
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:37,420
one single incident
has made me who I am.

977
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:41,900
It won't leave me be.
The guilt tears me apart...

978
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,780
but now I got a chance
to find out the truth.

979
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,220
I have to take it.

980
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,300
Alan, you brought
an implant amongst us.

981
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:50,340
Why should I help you?

982
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,900
If I try it myself, I'll die.

983
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,860
And I will try it myself.

984
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:05,300
We've been friends
for too long, my dear.

985
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,980
I can't let you
kill yourself, can I?

986
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:12,420
But you understand,
you can never cut again.

987
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,700
Yeah.

988
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,180
The last time I tried this,
the woman's nervous system...

989
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:23,820
shut down immediately.
It couldn't handle it.

990
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,820
She was a blank
for the rest of her life.

991
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:35,900
Now, remember...

992
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:37,460
I can't copy anything
into a hard drive.

993
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,140
You can only watch.

994
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:41,180
You know exactly which scene
you're going to?

995
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,540
I sure do.

996
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:44,220
You have five minutes.

997
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,380
Anything longer than that
is just too risky.

998
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,060
OK.

999
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:20,260
Christie.

1000
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:28,580
I remember her.

1001
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,340
It's me.

1002
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:12,140
Alan.

1003
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:15,940
Almost there.

1004
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,380
There we are.

1005
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,700
Come and get me.

1006
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,580
Let's go back down.

1007
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,220
Don't!

1008
01:13:53,380 --> 01:13:56,500
I'll meet you
back on the ground floor.

1009
01:13:56,580 --> 01:14:00,540
Hold on. I'm coming.

1010
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:03,580
No. Wait. Wait.

1011
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:08,500
It isn't steady anymore.

1012
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:14,580
Louis, please, just stop.

1013
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,620
I can't move!

1014
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,580
OK, Louis, you can make it.

1015
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,020
Just a few more steps.

1016
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,580
Grab my hand!

1017
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:27,900
Wait!

1018
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,260
Alan...

1019
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:10,340
- We're done! We're done!
- Alan, unplug it.

1020
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:11,780
I can't.

1021
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:48,780
Alan!

1022
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,020
Alan!

1023
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,220
Alan?

1024
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,860
I'm all right.

1025
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:03,580
Do you have any idea
how close you came?

1026
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,900
I saw him.

1027
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:10,420
I tried to help.

1028
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:12,740
I told him to turn around.

1029
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:16,420
He wouldn't listen.

1030
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:19,860
He fell, but...

1031
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,380
he was breathing.

1032
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:25,780
It wasn't blood.

1033
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:27,940
It was paint.

1034
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,740
Now I remember.

1035
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,020
Thank you.

1036
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:48,980
Looking for this?

1037
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,420
The implant's history.

1038
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,660
You better find yourself
another perfect candidate.

1039
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,740
Do you know
how much planning it took...

1040
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:01,260
to make Bannister's footage
available? Do you?

1041
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,940
He died of
a coronary complication.

1042
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:05,540
I was the complication.

1043
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,180
Or didn't
you get to that part yet?

1044
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:09,260
I guess no one will.

1045
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,660
I bet he still keeps good notes.
Don't you, Alan?

1046
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:42,620
All of it?

1047
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:44,620
All of it.

1048
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,300
It was a terrible accident.

1049
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:51,260
Sometimes the older Guillotines
can damage a Zoe implant.

1050
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,820
There's no replacing
your husband's life.

1051
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:55,585
He deserved a Rememory...

1052
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:58,140
and a place
in your Zoe family tree.

1053
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:59,660
I'm sorry.

1054
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:07,820
You will... waive your fee?

1055
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:09,300
Of course.

1056
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,220
And you'll never speak
of Charles to anyone?

1057
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:16,220
What can one do?
Accidents will happen.

1058
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:21,460
Perhaps some things
are best forgotten.

1059
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,540
Perhaps.

1060
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,420
God, Isabel, you scared me.

1061
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:49,500
Isabel, honey,
what's the matter?

1062
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:52,460
Isabel.

1063
01:19:54,420 --> 01:19:56,260
Isabel, what...

1064
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,180
What's wrong, honey?

1065
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:03,980
Isabel.

1066
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,540
A friend?

1067
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:33,220
Yeah. Something like that.

1068
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,540
I hear
you're not cutting anymore.

1069
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,100
I've had enough
of other people's lives.

1070
01:21:40,580 --> 01:21:43,580
Stop, Alan.
I can't let you go.

1071
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:44,860
What now?

1072
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:46,780
Word travels fast in my circles.

1073
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:50,860
Word is, a cutter came in
for a synth tattoo.

1074
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:54,260
Word is that cutter is you.

1075
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:57,220
You saw that implant.
It was destroyed. It's useless.

1076
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,140
You.

1077
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,380
Bannister's footage is gone,
but you've seen his life.

1078
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,220
It's encrypted
into your implant.

1079
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:40,380
Will you look at that?

1080
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:17,260
Come and get me.

1081
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,260
He had a very big meeting
one day...

1082
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,660
but he took me
horseback riding instead.

1083
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:27,500
He would read me stories
every night.

1084
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:30,100
Sometimes he would make it up
as he went along...

1085
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:32,540
and I knew, but I didn't care.

1086
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,540
Your mom said I was here
to talk about your dad.

1087
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,620
We don't need to do that
if you don't want to.

1088
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,980
- Daddy?
- Yes, sweetie?

1089
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:41,860
- Alan, please!
- I want to go back to bed.

1090
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:43,700
- It's John's birthday.
- We'll have meatballs.

1091
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:46,220
Italian. You love Italian.
A toast.

1092
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,900
- Happy birthday, John.
- Happy birthday, Fletcher.

1093
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,100
Thanks, Alan.

1094
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:53,620
Alan, put the newspaper down.
Come on.

1095
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:56,900
You gonna lighten up
and be gay for a moment?

1096
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:18,180
It's for the greater good, Alan.

1097
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:20,580
Your life will mean something.

1098
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:24,260
I promise.
