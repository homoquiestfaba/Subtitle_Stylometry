1
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,711
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

2
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,549
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah, keep doing that.
Okay. Okay.

3
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,019
Oh, Larry! -Oh... Uh, I'm
sorry, help me out here.

4
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:56,221
- Suzanne.
- Oh, Susan!

5
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,991
No! Suzanne. -I'm sorry.
I meant to say Susan.

6
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:01,026
No. Suzanne.

7
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,795
Oh, Suzanne!

8
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,266
- Oh.

9
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:10,269
- Yeah.
- You are amazing.

10
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:11,837
- Well...

11
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,173
I could never have reached those
heights of passion without you.

12
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:17,409
Actually, you did reach those
heights of passion without me.

13
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,113
Oh, God, you are so damn hot.

14
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,682
Yeah. Right there, Larry.
That's it.

15
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,717
- Don't stop.
- Larry!

16
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,753
What?

17
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,757
What?

18
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,028
- So, how about some breakfast?
- I couldn't possibly.

19
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,634
- You see, Su...
- Zanne!

20
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,969
You see, Zanne,

21
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,572
I know you'd want me
to have breakfast,

22
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:49,475
date for a while, get married,
start a family,

23
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:51,443
plants roots in the community,

24
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,179
join the local church, synagogue
or a polygamous cult,

25
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,181
but that's not my speed.

26
00:01:56,183 --> 00:02:00,552
If I stay on the ground too
long, the sky starts to beckon.

27
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,754
Don't you ever get
tired of that lifestyle,

28
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,557
flying from place to place
all the time?

29
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:07,593
Every once in a while,
I wake up in a cold sweat,

30
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:10,829
my entire being enveloped by
a crushing, empty loneliness

31
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,799
that physically presses down on
me till I can barely breathe.

32
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,469
But then I ignore it
and it usually passes.

33
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,638
That doesn't sound too healthy.

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,809
Well, mind-blowing sex
and free medical advice.

35
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,879
- Zanne, what don't you give?
- I have a surprise for you.

36
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,253
Is that what I think it is?

37
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,355
Here's something
to remember me by.

38
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,524
- Oh.

39
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:42,027
You sure I can't get you anything?
A little breakfast to go?

40
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,763
Okay, but just something
quick and easy.

41
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,543
So...

42
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,779
Mr. Gaye,

43
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,448
um, you're a flight attendant?

44
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,883
- Bingo.

45
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,786
- And, uh, you want us to
publish your book? -Yahtzee.

46
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,610
- Oh, but the book is not written yet?
- Twister.

47
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,398
Uh, and it is the story
of your life?

48
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,436
<i>The Unauthorized Autobiography.</i>

49
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,571
<i>The Unauthorized Autobiography?</i>

50
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,440
Um,

51
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:12,277
- but an autobiography cannot
be unauthorized. -Or can it?

52
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,381
By writing the book, you're implicitly
authorizing that it be written.

53
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,016
Define "implicitly."

54
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,453
Mr. Gaye, was there ever a time in
the past that maybe I'm unaware of

55
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,923
where I wiped my bottom
with 20 minutes of your life?

56
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:28,126
Define "aware" and "20."

57
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,062
- Who arranged this meeting?
- -Uh...

58
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:31,496
I... I did, sir.

59
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,465
You're fired.

60
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,304
Oh. And happy birthday.

61
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:42,374
- Hey. -Would someone please
show this jackass the door?

62
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,076
I already saw the door
on my way in.

63
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:47,412
Now, sir, my life story
yearns to be told.

64
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,348
It's a tale of intrigue,
adventure

65
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,316
and life among the clouds.

66
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,719
Mr. Gaye,

67
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,588
if you held a gun to my head
and said to me,

68
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,458
"Hey, be less interested
in my book"

69
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,562
"or I will splatter the walls
with the contents of your skull,"

70
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,331
I don't think I could.

71
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,935
I guess I'll just have
to take my story elsewhere.

72
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,743
There are other fish in the
publishing sea, my friend.

73
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,013
Yes, in Manhattan,
I'm gonna need two numbers,

74
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:25,250
the first one is for Simon, and
then I need one for Schuster.

75
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,623
Look, if I walk out that door,
guys, I'm not coming back!

76
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,791
You got it?

77
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,594
Oh, you think I'm bluffing?

78
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,763
You think I'm bluffing?

79
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,931
Good day, everyone!

80
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,610
Okay.

81
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,746
I'm headed to the elevator.

82
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,783
- Do we have any kind
of screening process here?

83
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:00,051
Okay. I'm in the elevator.

84
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,387
- Get out.
- Yep. Yes.

85
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,357
It's closing.
The door is closing.

86
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,393
- The door is closing.

87
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,096
Last chance!

88
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,266
If I get in a taxi,
you're out of luck!

89
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,695
Is there a quicker way to
the airport, my friend?

90
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:27,946
I'm running late for a flight.

91
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,981
Sorry, man,
it's like this all over.

92
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:34,519
- Rush hour traffic, you know.
- I know that accent.

93
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,588
What part of Canada
are you from?

94
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,158
I'm from Jamaica.

95
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,129
Yeah, but you obviously lived
in Canada for a long time.

96
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,064
No, man, never been there.

97
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,768
But your parents were Canadian
and spoke it around the house.

98
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,936
No, man!

99
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,876
Bet you never had to worry aboot
traffic like this in Saskatchewan,

100
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,444
eh?

101
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,713
Eh?

102
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,182
Who's that guy?

103
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,405
I can help you with that bag.
All right.

104
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,544
Please be careful! I have my grandfather's
remains in an urn up there.

105
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,113
- I will, sir.
- Excuse me!

106
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,116
This woman claims she's in 9E,
but that's my seat.

107
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,119
I'll try to straighten
that out. Okay?

108
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,988
I can't remember if I ordered a
kosher meal or not. Can you help me?

109
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,870
Okay. If you can just give me one
second, I will check that, I promise.

110
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,466
Okay, people, please, please, please, okay?
It's my very first flight

111
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,603
and our lead attendant is not here,
but I'm doing the best that I can.

112
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:33,705
So, please, bear with me.

113
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,145
Grandpa!

114
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,256
Excuse me.

115
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,358
Is there a problem here?

116
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,293
Allow me.

117
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,044
Anything else?

118
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,179
She's in my seat.

119
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,983
Oh.

120
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,619
Actually, ma'am,
you're not in 9E.

121
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,321
You're in 3b.

122
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,423
Common mistake.

123
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,995
I've been trying to find out
if I ordered a kosher meal.

124
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,330
Rabbi, I got the passenger
manifest in advance,

125
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:36,668
so I personally prepared you a nice piece
of chicken with a side of borscht.

126
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,036
Thank you, my son.

127
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,208
What about my grandpa? Look.

128
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,920
- Gramps comin' at ya!

129
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,891
Thanks.
You really saved me there.

130
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,494
You saying "Thanks"
is thanks enough.

131
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,462
Um, okay.

132
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,465
- I guess we're ready.
- Not yet.

133
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,334
My finely honed senses
tells me there's someone

134
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,670
on board this flight
who's a threat to us all.

135
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,589
You, sir.

136
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,592
Frat guy, huh?

137
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:37,696
- Oh, Phi Beta Kappa, it's an
academic fraternity. -Oh?

138
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:40,365
You like to drink,
get out of control,

139
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,967
you boot and rally,
you cause a scene.

140
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,370
No, I don't drink.
I'm a Rhodes Scholar.

141
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,672
I'm actually flying to UCLA
to collect an award.

142
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,774
I won't have those kind
of shenanigans on my flight!

143
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,276
Take a hike, party boy!

144
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:53,545
- No, but I'm...
- Save it, <i> Animal House!</i>

145
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,213
Off my plane!

146
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,483
Off my plane!

147
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,197
Okay, rookie,
let's fly this bitch.

148
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,649
Miss McCoy, it's all yours.

149
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,119
Thank you.

150
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:38,156
Gentlemen and ladies, what do
we spend the most money on?

151
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,961
- Passenger safety.

152
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,767
Stop it, Geddes, stop it!
This is serious.

153
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,836
Outside of equipment,
fuel and brass tacks,

154
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:55,140
our greatest operating expense
is service.

155
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,176
Flight attendants.

156
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,345
- Yes.
- Their union is strong,

157
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,715
their salaries keep rising.
Not to mention their benefits.

158
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:04,883
But what if I told you
there was a way

159
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:08,319
to completely eliminate
human flight attendants?

160
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,082
Even if we could, where
would you hide the bodies?

161
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,958
Oh, just asking.

162
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,095
Gentlemen, there is someone
I would like for you to meet.

163
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,636
Good morning, Miss McCoy.

164
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:27,472
Good morning, Sally.

165
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,774
Sally, may I have
a cup of coffee, please?

166
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:30,842
My pleasure.

167
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,849
Thank you, Sally.

168
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:42,387
Oh, this coffee is way too hot!

169
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,689
Oh.

170
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,563
I'm sorry, Miss McCoy. I'll find
some more coffee that's not so hot.

171
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,965
- What the...
- She's not real!

172
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,367
- Right, Sally?
- That's right, Miss McCoy.

173
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,369
My body is state-of-the-art
neoprene

174
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:00,772
stretched over a complex
electronic framework,

175
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,373
my brain is a powerful
microprocessor

176
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,375
capable of five billion
decisions per second

177
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,678
and my boobs are a perky 34C.

178
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,379
This is amazing.

179
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,015
Go ahead, touch her. You'd
never know the difference.

180
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,684
- What?
- Touch her.

181
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,223
You mean, just... Wow!

182
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,338
I'm Nathan, by the way.

183
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,772
The pleasure's yours, Nathan.

184
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,409
That was incredible, all the
stuff you did back there.

185
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,845
I'm not sure "incredible"
is the right word.

186
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,347
I believe it's "uncredible."

187
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,450
I'm pretty sure
it's "incredible."

188
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,485
Let's agree not to disagree.

189
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,421
I don't think
that's the expression.

190
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,157
Are you disagreeing with me?
We just agreed not to.

191
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,729
You were saying?

192
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,931
They sure didn't teach us any of
that stuff at the training academy.

193
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,733
Yeah, that's why I never
listen to what they teach.

194
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,335
I make my own rules,
then I break 'em.

195
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:07,272
But if they're your own rules,
why do you have to break 'em?

196
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:08,940
- Well, I...
- Wouldn't it be easier

197
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,775
to make up different rules
that you didn't have to break?

198
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,278
- Not necessarily. -Or to not
make up any rules at all.

199
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,647
The point is, I'm a renegade.

200
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,383
Wait a minute.
You're Larry Gaye!

201
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,051
My first day and I get to fly

202
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,853
- with Larry Gaye?
- So cool.

203
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,722
My God, the stories, the women.

204
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,825
- Six Golden Coffee Pots!

205
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,928
You're a legend.

206
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,729
Relax. Look.

207
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,899
I know this may come as a shock,
but I'm just a human being.

208
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:37,702
I mean, if you cut me, I bleed.

209
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,004
If you pinch me, I cry.

210
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,443
If you pull my hair,
I scream like a little girl.

211
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,779
If you back an SUV
over my bare feet,

212
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,548
I'd likely go into shock.
The pain is so intense.

213
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,785
If you eliminate vitamins
B and D from my diet,

214
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:56,888
my skin turns a shade of taupe
you've never seen.

215
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,696
I can't breathe.

216
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,965
Hello.

217
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,967
Carry on, please.

218
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,503
You're looking at
the new Flightpal 200

219
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:14,739
made by Techtronics Industries.

220
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:18,609
Now, for a fraction of the
cost of a flight attendant,

221
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,878
we can have
every one of our planes

222
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,648
fully manned by Flightpals

223
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,150
within one year.

224
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,119
Excuse me, Miss McCoy.

225
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:31,022
The reputation of this airline
is built on service.

226
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:34,292
How do you know
that the Flightpal 200

227
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:36,427
is better
than our flight attendants?

228
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,962
That's a great question.

229
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,430
Ladies and gentlemen,

230
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,734
the President and Founder
of Techtronics Industries,

231
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,969
Bob Techtronics.

232
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,639
Folks, I wouldn't expect you to
just sign on the dotted line.

233
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,009
I only ask for the opportunity
to prove to you

234
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,679
that the Flightpal can
outperform an error-prone human.

235
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,081
And how do you plan
on doing that?

236
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:00,051
By letting Sally here
go up against your best

237
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,887
in a challenge
of flight attendant skills.

238
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,089
- That sounds fair, doesn't it?
- Absolutely. Let's set it up.

239
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:08,960
If it works, it could be a financial
lifesaver for the entire company.

240
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:11,262
Thank you so much, Mr. T.

241
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,597
Sally, we'll talk.

242
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,033
If you remove

243
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,535
the vestibular system from my inner
ear, I have difficulty balancing.

244
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:21,639
If you take a croquet mallet,
coat it with shards of glass

245
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:24,375
- and swing it directly at my testes...
- Okay, you're human!

246
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,677
- You made your point.
- I think I've made my point.

247
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,086
Well, look who it is.

248
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,356
Bryce. Felder.

249
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,992
That's "Captain" to you.

250
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:44,395
Sorry, Crapton Bryce.

251
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,164
How you feeling today, Gaye?

252
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,101
Are you getting sleepier?

253
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,171
Oh, snap!

254
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,953
It's ancient history, Nathan,
like the Romanian Empire.

255
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,650
- But...
- I said,

256
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,291
ancient history.

257
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,928
- Okay. Got it.

258
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,330
<i>Uh...</i>

259
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,300
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Captain Bryce here.</i>

260
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,569
<i>Just wanted to speak</i>
<i>as your pilot</i>

261
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,270
<i>and not</i>
<i>a lowly flight attendant,</i>

262
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,040
<i>and say it's great</i>
<i>to be piloting this plane</i>

263
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,576
<i>because I'm a pilot</i>

264
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,811
<i>who passed through</i>
<i>the pilot training academy</i>

265
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,547
<i>and became a pilot.</i>

266
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,554
These big union meetings
tend to drag

267
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,756
like a turtle's nut sack,
am I right?

268
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,559
Excuse me?
Show some respect.

269
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,128
What's that?

270
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,999
Actually, I find them
interesting and informative.

271
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,234
Uh, surely
you can't be serious.

272
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,936
I am serious.

273
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,272
- Then should I stop
calling you Shirley?

274
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,450
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

275
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,386
<i>and members</i>
<i>of the Fraternal Association</i>

276
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:51,322
<i>of Federated Airlines</i>
<i>Flight Attendants, welcome.</i>

277
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,358
<i>Management has</i>
<i>asked us to select</i>

278
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,961
<i>our top flight attendant</i>

279
00:19:56,963 --> 00:20:00,031
<i>to go up against the Flightpal</i>

280
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,066
<i>in a performance test.</i>

281
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:06,671
<i>And the Research Committee</i>
<i>has given me one name.</i>

282
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,973
<i>Which one of you is Gaye?</i>

283
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,281
<i>Larry Gaye.</i>

284
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,452
- That'd be me.
<i>- Ah!</i>

285
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,355
<i>Mr. Gaye,</i>
<i>just how good are you?</i>

286
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,724
On a scale from one to 10,

287
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,859
it can't be quantified.

288
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,062
<i>Perhaps you would</i>
<i>try to quantify.</i>

289
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,264
Well...

290
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,433
I have won
an unprecedented six,

291
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,336
count them, six, consecutive
Golden Coffee Pots.

292
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,570
Roll the clip!

293
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,407
- <i> -Uh, guys, I...</i>

294
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,110
<i>I don't know what to say,</i>
<i>except maybe,</i>

295
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,713
<i>suck it,</i>
<i>other flight attendants!</i>

296
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,147
<i>Suck it dry!</i>

297
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,550
Hey, hey, hey! You cut it off
before my dance. Not cool.

298
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,919
<i>Mr. Gaye,</i>
<i>I want to ask you,</i>

299
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:59,390
<i>will you help spare the jobs</i>
<i>of everyone in this room</i>

300
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,026
<i>and thousands of others</i>
<i>nationwide?</i>

301
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,500
Seems like a hassle. Pass!

302
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:10,835
I'm gonna pass!

303
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,505
<i>No. Mr. Gaye!</i>
- Larry.

304
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,474
What? What? What?

305
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:19,710
<i>We need you.</i>
<i>Our livelihood depends on it.</i>

306
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,685
Fine, I'll do it.

307
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,253
- I'll do it!

308
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,689
Ladies and gentlemen
of the FAFAFA, worry not!

309
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,825
I will take on this scourge
and I will win.

310
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:37,528
Nothing on God's green Earth
will stop me!

311
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,697
- <i> -Thank you, Mr. Gaye.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

312
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:41,766
As long as it's not on a Tuesday morning.
I have a Zumba class.

313
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:43,267
<i>Okay.</i>

314
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:46,070
Or Saturdays at 3:00. I have a
standing body wax. Gotta do that.

315
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:48,973
Wednesdays aren't great.
Hump day.

316
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,808
And I take
that quite literally.

317
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,310
- You know what I'm talking about.
<i>- Thank you, Mr. Gaye.</i>

318
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,611
<i>Larry Gaye,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

319
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,846
<i>- Larry Gaye, thank you.</i>
- You got it.

320
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,751
Larry!

321
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:10,895
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
aboard Federated Airlines Flight 75</i>

322
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,997
<i>with non-stop service</i>
<i>to Los Angeles.</i>

323
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,099
<i>We'll be taxiing</i>
<i>in just a few moments.</i>

324
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,767
<i>But first, allow me</i>
<i>to demonstrate</i>

325
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,870
<i>the safety features</i>
<i>of our Boeing 737.</i>

326
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:21,872
Nathan. Thank you.

327
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,674
<i>You fasten the seatbelt</i>

328
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,676
<i>by inserting the metal end</i>

329
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:33,184
<i>into the expectant buckle.</i>

330
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:36,120
<i>A little at first, you know,</i>
<i>just enough to</i>

331
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,656
<i>tease the buckle.</i>

332
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,459
<i>You want some of that?</i>

333
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,161
<i>Hmm, yeah.</i>

334
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,932
<i>Ohh!</i>

335
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:51,369
<i>Take that buckle.</i>
<i>Take it! Yeah.</i>

336
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,237
<i>- Mmm, yeah.</i>
-

337
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,739
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

338
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,307
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

339
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,843
<i>And finally, when that buckle</i>
<i>just can't take any more,</i>

340
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:01,312
<i>you pull on this thing</i>
<i>to release it.</i>

341
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,051
<i>We don't anticipate it, but should
there be a change in cabin pressure,</i>

342
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,553
<i>your oxygen mask</i>
<i>will drop down.</i>

343
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:12,990
<i>You place the mask</i>
<i>over your mouth, like so.</i>

344
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,267
<i>Mmm, yeah.</i>

345
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,570
<i>Okay.</i>

346
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,240
<i>For those of you seated</i>
<i>in an emergency exit row,</i>

347
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,710
<i>like, uh, I don't know,</i>
<i>say you.</i>

348
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,914
<i>If called upon to open</i>
<i>the emergency door, well,</i>

349
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,290
<i>you're gonna pull</i>
<i>on that big lever.</i>

350
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,488
<i>Yeah, yeah, you're gonna</i>
<i>pull on it real nice</i>

351
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,759
<i>Ooh, I bet you know how to
pull that thing just right.</i>

352
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:49,894
<i>Yeah, you know</i>
<i>what I'm talking about.</i>

353
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,195
<i>You know</i>
<i>what I'm talking about,</i>

354
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,797
<i>-you naughty little tart.</i>

355
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,498
<i>Flight attendants,</i>
<i>please be seated for take-off.</i>

356
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,501
<i>Okay. Power down</i>
<i>all electronic devices.</i>

357
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:59,303
<i>We'll be up in the air shortly.</i>

358
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:00,838
<i>Thank you, everybody.</i>

359
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:07,378
We have got a live one in 10b.

360
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,621
I think those instructions
could have been clearer.

361
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,825
<i>Uh, folks, we're about</i>
<i>to start our in-flight movie,</i>

362
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:23,661
License to Chill.

363
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,596
<i>Audio can be found</i>
<i>on Channel 10.</i>

364
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:32,102
- Hey, Nate, can you grab the
disk out of my bag? -Yeah.

365
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,738
Gaye, I asked for a Fresca
five minutes ago.

366
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,974
What happened?
Did you trip over your skirt?

367
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,977
So sorry, I was, uh...
I was about to bring it in.

368
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,483
Well, maybe if you spent less time flirting
with your little gal pal over there,

369
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,486
you'd be able
to focus on your job.

370
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,722
I already do focus on my job
as six, count them, six,

371
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,758
Golden Coffee Pots can attest.

372
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,594
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

373
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:01,432
How does it feel working with the
biggest wussy in the business?

374
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,434
- Well...
- Don't talk!

375
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:05,002
I gotta go fly this bird.

376
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,989
Are you gonna tell me
what's that all about?

377
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:15,880
Sorry, Nathan.

378
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,748
I'm an intensely
private person.

379
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,984
You made a deal to publish your
autobiography so you could,

380
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:23,087
and I quote, "Share your
story with the world."

381
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,488
It's unauthorized.

382
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,766
Fine. I guess
you'll read it anyway.

383
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,236
It all started
when I was a little boy...

384
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,938
- Uh, Larry...
- Please don't interrupt.

385
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,606
You asked for the story.
Now let me tell it.

386
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,742
- No, but it's... -Hey!
Here's how it works up here.

387
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:46,377
When a veteran
is telling a rookie a story,

388
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,213
the rookie, you, listens,

389
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,181
<i>sans</i> interruption. <i> Sans!</i>

390
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,819
As I was saying,

391
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:58,622
<i>I loved my father</i>
<i>more than anything.</i>

392
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:01,325
<i>So when he left me,</i>
<i>I was devastated.</i>

393
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:04,662
- <i> -Even if it was</i>
<i>only for a few minutes.</i>

394
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:13,304
<i>Well, you can imagine how upset
I was when he left for good.</i>

395
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,173
Where are you going, Dad?

396
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:20,544
Hey-hey, there he is.

397
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,479
There he always is.

398
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,615
I'm... I'm...

399
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:28,385
I'm just going out to have
these suitcases polished.

400
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:30,147
But it's the middle
of the night.

401
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,623
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

402
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,625
And there is a, uh,

403
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:38,395
24-hour suitcase polisher
over on State Street.

404
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:40,264
Oh, okay.

405
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,434
Good night.

406
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,970
Good night, Son.
Have a good life.

407
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:48,572
Until tomorrow morning,

408
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:51,809
when I will see you again

409
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:56,580
because I'm definitely
not running out on you

410
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,949
or your mother,

411
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,920
or the life of debt and
dysfunction we've built together.

412
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,825
<i>But I wasn't stupid. It didn't
take long to figure out</i>

413
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,461
<i>that somewhere on his way to
the 24-hour suitcase polisher,</i>

414
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:12,329
<i>-he decided to leave for good.</i>

415
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,105
<i>My mom tried</i>
<i>everything she could</i>

416
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,774
<i>to take my mind off</i>
<i>the hurt of Dad leaving,</i>

417
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,245
<i>but nothing could distract me.</i>

418
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:32,449
<i>In an all-new episode</i> of
Boys Whose Fathers Love Them

419
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,951
and Have Not Run Off
Unexpectedly...

420
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:35,786
No!

421
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:38,422
<i>I knew of no way to make</i>
<i>the pain go away.</i>

422
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,728
<i>Until that moment,</i>

423
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,232
<i>when I realized that if I could be
way up in the clouds, then maybe</i>

424
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:52,436
<i>it would take me away from the
hurt I felt down on the ground.</i>

425
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:55,773
<i>And that's when I decided that
what I wanted more than anything</i>

426
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,641
<i>was to fly.</i>

427
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,779
- Larry, behind you. -Yes,
that chapter was behind me.

428
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,213
Well observed.

429
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:06,116
Then, in 1995,
I went to flight school.

430
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,855
Building 5.
Orientation's on the right.

431
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,260
- Hi.
- Hi there.

432
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,761
I'm Gaye.

433
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:19,730
Really?

434
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,099
Uh...

435
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,503
I have a private bunk

436
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:29,440
with the only bathtub
in this whole facility.

437
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:31,542
Cadet Larry Gaye.

438
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:35,045
- Right. Uh, building 5. Orientation's
on the right. -Thank you.

439
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,751
That's what I'm talking about.

440
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,188
Here, here

441
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,423
and especially here.

442
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:51,161
Ladies and gentlemen, you need
to know these principles cold.

443
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:54,331
<i>I had big dreams,</i>
<i>and even bigger confidence.</i>

444
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:58,035
<i>I was gonna be the best
damn pilot in the world.</i>

445
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:01,672
All right.
Define lift. Gaye.

446
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,677
A positive force caused by the
difference in air pressure

447
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,746
- under and above a wing, sir.
- Drag?

448
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,882
The resistance of the air to
anything moving through it, sir!

449
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,117
And thrust?

450
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,187
Damn, he's good.

451
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,324
E, P, H,

452
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:22,726
- T, O, Z.
- Good.

453
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:24,294
The bottom line, please?

454
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,298
That's...

455
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,169
J, M, V...

456
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:34,772
No, no, no.
That's not correct.

457
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,908
Uh, actually, Doc,
I'm working off that chart.

458
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,878
- Are you kidding me?
- H, R,

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,746

Reduce airspeed 50 knots.

463

Lower angle of left wing.

Come on. Challenge me, bud.

<i>I wasn't cocky. I just</i>

Deploy landing gear.

467
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,840
<i>And bragged about it,</i>
<i>in an obnoxious way.</i>

468
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,802
What's the matter?
You need to use your hands?

469
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:20,484
That's right. I was on my way
and nothing was gonna stop me.

470
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,190
So what happened?

471
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,425
All that was left
was the actual flying.

472
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:32,763
<i>You're coming in too hot, Gaye.</i>

473
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,666

475
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,838
<i>Gaye! Wake up!</i>

476
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,147
Wake up, wake up.

477
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,890
Yeah, there's something
wrong with this kid.

478
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,892
Gaye, I've got some bad news.

479
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:05,729
And it's my job to give it to you in
the most professional way possible.

480
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,733
Guess what it is.

481
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:13,604
- Heart disease?
- No.

482
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:15,839
- Measles?
- You're getting cooler.

483
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,509
Oh, uh, okay, okay, okay, um...

484
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,913
- Nervous disorder.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.

485
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,281
- That's warmer.
- Okay.

486
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:26,350
- Mumps?
- No, colder.

487
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,784
- Anemia.
- Oh, you're ice-cold.

488
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:29,853
Come on! Doc, just tell me.

489
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,222
- You have narcolepsy.
- Oh.

490
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,125
It's a neurological disorder
caused by the brain's inability

491
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:38,095
to regulate sleep-wake cycles.

492
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,858
In other words, you fall
asleep uncontrollably.

493
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,367
- That's ridic...
- Hmm?

494
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,903
Sorry, I thought
I had to sneeze.

495
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,738
Oh, I thought you
were having a stroke.

496
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,972
That's ridiculous.

497
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,825
- Yes!

498
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:24,441
So, my dreams of being a pilot were
smashed into a thousand pieces.

499
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,410
The only way I was gonna
fly was in this apron,

500
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:29,279
and Bryce and Felder
never let me forget it.

501
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,349
But it's all in the past.

502
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:35,085
Never even think about it.
I'm as happy as I seem.

503
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,091
I'm glad you're over it.

504
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,663
Someone's playing our song.

505
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,936
Ah.

506
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,139
Is there something
I can help you with?

507
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,142
I wanted to tell you how much
I'm enjoying the movie.

508
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:03,080
It's not <i> Ice Age 2</i> or even
<i>3,</i> but it's a jaunty romp,

509
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,282
it's pleasantly paced.

510
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,752
Turbulence.

511
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,654
Excuse me for a second.

512
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,229
Oh! <i> Uh, folks, folks, folks.</i>

514
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:25,969
<i>That was the director's cut, with
some scenes that had been omitted,</i>

515
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:29,306
<i>and I think wisely so.</i>

516
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:32,709
<i>Here's some more</i>
<i>family friendly entertainment.</i>

517
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,254
How are you?

518
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,792
You were saying.

519
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:51,595
Perhaps someday you and I
could make a movie like that.

520
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:53,563
<i>License to Chill?</i>

521
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:58,735
No, I mean, I'd like you to make
love to me in every way imaginable.

522
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,546
Ooh.

523
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,315
Shall we ignore the fact that it smells
like Death's underpants in here?

524
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:13,383
Let's.

525
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,385
Okay, can I get you a drink?

526
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:17,687
- Vodka, rocks.
- Yes, it does.

527
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,323
Oh, right.

528
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,370
- Thank you.

529
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:34,604
That'll be $6.

530
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,575
- Oh.
- Hmm.

531
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,777
Oh.

532
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,316
Ah, yes. Um, do you
happen to have exact change?

533
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,484
No, I don't.

534
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,287
What are we gonna
do about that?

535
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,595
Here.

536
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,832
Where were we?

537
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:03,834
I wanna know
everything about you.

538
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:05,669
I want to feel
what it's like to touch you.

539
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,804
I want your body
to possess my body.

540
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:09,272
In a sexual way?

541
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,614
Hi, there.

542
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:22,052
So, uh, we're all out of beef stew,
would you like some lasagna?

543
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,422
Oh, but I love beef stew.

544
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,492
Oh, this sucks.

545
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,794
I apologize, sir.

546
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,462
- No!
- Okay, all right.

547
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,266
Oh, uh, glad
I could help, ma'am.

548
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,934
If anyone else needs
help with the faucets,

549
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:40,804
please don't hesitate to call,
they can be a tad tricky.

550
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,075
If you could just
give me one moment.

551
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,277
Hmm.

552
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:52,149
Presiding over an emergency
meeting of the Mile High Club.

553
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,726
Well, I'm glad you had fun.
We ran out of

554
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,452
beef stew, these people
are ready to kill me.

555
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:56,987
Did you tell them we ran out?

556
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:02,626
Okay, rookie, lesson one. It's not beef
stew they want, they just want a choice.

557
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:06,329
- But there is no... -Watch and
learn from a professional.

558
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:10,400
Oh, left the
luggage hatch open.

559
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:16,740
Folks, for dinner we have lasagna
or a stew of beef and brown lice.

560
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:18,074
Well, I'll have the lasagna.

561
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,844
Excellent choice, my dear.

562
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,580
Sir, would you like lasagna
or beef with cancer sauce?

563
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:26,483
- I better go for lasagna.
- I think you better, yeah.

564
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:30,253
Sir, lasagna or sliced
elderly human feet?

565
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:32,122
- Lasagna.
- Lasagna. Excellent choice.

566
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:41,264
Stick with me, Nath. You'll gain a mentor,
wingman and all-around fun captain,

567
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:46,069
and having you around might help ward off
my occasional crushing, empty loneliness.

568
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,704
The crushing,
empty loneliness you ignore?

569
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,773
What crushing,
empty loneliness?

570
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,646
Yeah!

571
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,996
Call me.

572
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,664
I will.

573
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,348
Yeah, yeah.

574
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,800
Whoa!

575
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:33,703
Oh!

576
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,360
Wow.

577
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:32,662
Can't believe all that stuff
happened in one day.

578
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,664
That's the life
of the sky, Nathan.

579
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:38,368
Every day is an incredible
series of fun, memorable events.

580
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,203
A montage, if you will.

581
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:43,006
- It was amazing.
- I know.

582
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,975
Although I did get strip
searched by a giant angry man.

583
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,178
And severely shocked
with defibrillator paddles.

584
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,746
Yep, best job in the world.

585
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:51,080
I also drank vomit.

586
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,988
Oh, dear God.

587
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,357
- What? -Uh, I can't let
that woman see me.

588
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:35,839
- Why?
- Just...

589
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,696
What the... Damn!

590
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:42,732
I'm not comfortable
with this. Please, Larry...

591
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,034
Yeah, Larry she's gone.
Larry, she's gone!

592
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:47,837
- Okay. Okay.
- She's gone.

593
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,400
That could've been
really uncomfortable.

594
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,208
Who was that?

595
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,645
Nathan, I've said many times nobody
can ground this plane permanently,

596
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,314
but she came the closest.

597
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,817
<i>The year was 1998.</i>

598
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:04,387
<i>I was on a weekend layover</i>
<i>in LA and, well, you know,</i>

599
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:07,891
<i>every great couple has a cute
story about how they met.</i>

600
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:09,993
<i>We were no different.</i>

601
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,565
<i>She was</i>
<i>walking her dog, Muffin.</i>

602
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,600
<i>The night before,</i>
<i>I'd been thrown through</i>

603
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:20,937
<i>a car windshield at 50 miles
an hour and left for dead.</i>

604
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:24,807
<i>Boy, that little Muffin sure liked
to lick dried blood off a face.</i>

605
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:32,582
<i>That charming April</i>
<i>convinced an off-duty,</i>

606
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:35,485
<i>and possibly drunk, ambulance
driver to pick me up.</i>

607
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:38,154
<i>And I was glad she did.</i>

608
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:41,357
You're hot.
You wanna have dinner tonight?

609
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,776
I'll pick you up
at 7:00, all right?

610
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:53,503
So, I'm all bandaged up, right? I
look her right in the eye and I say,

611
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:56,039
"God, you're hot. You wanna
have dinner tonight?"

612
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:58,908
- Um, Larry... -Hello,
storius interruptus much?

613
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,577
- No, but she's...
- Butt cheese?

614
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,579
Really, Nathan? Act your age,
not your weiner length, okay?

615
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:08,851
<i>We went to one of those restaurants where
they cook everything at the table.</i>

616
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:13,656
<i>We were given a truly authentic
Japanese experience by chef Hiro Obata</i>

617
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:15,959
<i>Garcia Gonzalez</i>
<i>de San Fernando.</i>

618
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:17,827
<i>I think it may have</i>
<i>been his first day.</i>

619
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:20,330
So, uh, you grew up in LA?

620
00:43:20,332 --> 00:43:22,332
Hmm, well actually
in the suburbs.

621
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,133
Really? Me too.

622
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:25,201
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

623
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,402
- Oh.
- Yeah.

624
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:29,505
Yeah, I loved it, you know,
everything felt so safe.

625
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,941
You could ride a bike
to a friend's house

626
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,104
without your parents being
all worried about you.

627
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,779
Totally, totally.

628
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,301
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

629
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,717
Yeah.

630
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,051
Mmm-hmm.

631
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,091
So what made you decide
that you wanted to fly?

632
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:55,732
Well, let's just say I wanted to escape
the pain of a father's abandonment.

633
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:58,067
I wanted to escape the pain
of a father's abandonment.

634
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,310
Thank you. I didn't think
I could say that by myself.

635
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,147
Hmm.

636
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,119
Huh.

637
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,590
It's crazy.

638
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,697
So, do you believe in fate?

639
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:30,433
Sure. Do you?

640
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,469
How could I not?

641
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:36,139
I mean, every day I walk
Muffin down Elm Street,

642
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:39,609
today I went down Maple,
and there you were,

643
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:41,444
unconscious on somebody's lawn.

644
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:42,945
- Hmm.

645
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:46,082
And usually I take a taxi
back to my hotel room,

646
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:48,418
but last night, I accepted a
ride from a complete stranger

647
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,387
who reeked of alcohol and could
barely stand up straight.

648
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,389
And if that hadn't happened,
we would've never met.

649
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:54,991
- I know.

650
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:58,828
It's like that drunk driver was an
angel, sent down to watch over me.

651
00:44:58,830 --> 00:44:59,896
Yeah.

652
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,833
I love you, drunk driver
who almost killed me.

653
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:11,040
<i>Now, without exaggeration, I've
made love to roughly 135,000 women.</i>

654
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,203
<i>But there was something about April
that went beyond the physical.</i>

655
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,815
I... Wow.

656
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:22,151
I just can't believe how
much we have in common.

657
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:25,955
You know, um, we both are Scorpios,
we both love Japanese food.

658
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:28,591
We both even have
the same middle name.

659
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:29,659
I know.

660
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:34,664
You are amazing,
Larry Elizabeth Gaye.

661
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,852
<i>But despite how wonderfully
everything was going,</i>

662
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:57,854
<i>something just</i>
<i>didn't feel right.</i>

663
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:06,896
Do you have to go?

664
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:08,865
No, I went when I woke up.

665
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,336
So, when you come back
to LA, will I see you?

666
00:46:13,338 --> 00:46:16,439
Look, I, um, the thing is...

667
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,510
Yes.

668
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,746
Yes, you will.

669
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,114
You promise?

670
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,683
I give you my word,
I'll call you.

671
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,189
Well, I didn't call her.

672
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:37,193
Why not? Nathan, you know me.
I'm built to fly.

673
00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:38,595
And as great as
April was, I just...

674
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:40,630
I didn't think I could be fully
happy down on the ground.

675
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,398
Then why didn't you have
the guts to say that?

676
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,767
Well, because... Turbulence.

677
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,937
April.

678
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:50,973
Boy, your ears must have been burning,
'cause I was just talking about you.

679
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,175
How have you been?

680
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:55,778
How have I been? Oh, gosh.
Uh, let's see.

681
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,947
I work at a crappy hotel,
where, um,

682
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:01,184
I get hit on all day by shitheads who say
they're gonna call and they never do.

683
00:47:01,186 --> 00:47:02,485
How you been?

684
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,956
Great, I've won six
Golden Coffee Pots in a row.

685
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,525
- This is my buddy, Nathan.
- Asshole.

686
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:12,261
Hey, that's not really fair. You
didn't even give him a chance.

687
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:13,930
- I think she meant you.
- No.

688
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,733
Really?
April, wait!

689
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,638
I'm sorry.

690
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,874
I'm sorry. I should never
have done what I did.

691
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:29,145
I guess what I'm trying to say is, what
I should've done is what I didn't.

692
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:33,883
And what I did do is not the opposite of
what the unright thing to do would've been.

693
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:36,552
- I understand. Okay.
- Okay, good.

694
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:40,122
Um, in fact,
why don't you, um...

695
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:44,193
Why don't you
come over tonight?

696
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:48,130
We can, um, pick up where we left
of, you know, for old times' sake.

697
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:55,571
Well, I guess I could drop my landing
gear, if you know what I mean.

698
00:47:55,573 --> 00:48:00,443
Put my tray table into its upright
position, if you know what I mean.

699
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:03,279
Fit my wheelie bag
into you overhead comp...

700
00:48:03,281 --> 00:48:04,714
I know what you mean.

701
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,282
Okay, so I'll see
you tonight, right?

702
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:07,984
- Yes, you will.
- Okay.

703
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:47,456
And this is the team that we have assembled
to fine tune the Flightpal's hard drive.

704
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:51,227
Johann Kaminsky, Stuart Nevins
and Token Black.

705
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,797
Taequan Black. Taequan Black.

706
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:57,033
Yes, of course it is.

707
00:48:57,035 --> 00:48:59,802
Now, Mr. Techtronics would
like to see how it's going

708
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:01,971
with our highest
priority project.

709
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:03,839
- Uh, fantastic.
- Right on target.

710
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:06,075
- Couldn't ask for better.
- Well within parameters.

711
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:07,243
Are you sure?

712
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:10,012
Well, the technical stuff
will be there,

713
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:14,350
but there's a certain human instinct
that great flight attendants have,

714
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,953
which we don't
fully understand yet.

715
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,955
I think
I can help you with that.

716
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,024
What?

717
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:25,027
What's the matter with you boys?
Never seen a sexy woman before?

718
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,332
- No, no.
- No, no. Not for free. No.

719
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:31,934
Isabella here has done
a little research for us.

720
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:37,273
<i>Larry, I want to know</i>
<i>the secrets of being</i>

721
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:39,875
<i>the best flight attendant</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

722
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:43,079
<i>Wait, you're not gonna somehow
use this against me, are you?</i>

723
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:45,281
<i>What?</i>
<i>No, of course not.</i>

724
00:49:45,283 --> 00:49:48,484
<i>No, I didn't mean to make you
uncomfortable, I just felt I had to ask.</i>

725
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,654
<i>Anyway, all my secrets?</i>
<i>Where do I begin?</i>

726
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,564
These tulips
should go in water.

727
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:05,401
And these two lips should go on a
self-guided tour of Mount April.

728
00:50:05,403 --> 00:50:08,337
Larry, you haven't
changed a bit.

729
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:13,009
Hey, if it ain't broke, don't
un-break it, if you know what I mean.

730
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:14,877
- I don't. Um...
- Okay.

731
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:18,080
Uh, Larry there is someone
I'd like you to meet.

732
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:21,484
- Mmm.
- So, um, just wait here.

733
00:50:21,486 --> 00:50:23,886
- That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- Okay.

734
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,889
Three-way.

735
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:35,698
Huh, that's a different
way to go.

736
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,502
- Larry.
- Oh.

737
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,470
This is Donnie.

738
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,540
- What's up, man?
- He's your son.

739
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,776
He's my what? Eh...

740
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:48,744
Whoa.

741
00:50:48,746 --> 00:50:51,313
- May I have a word with you?
- Yeah.

742
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:57,253
This can't be.
We only did it once.

743
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,655
That was all it took.

744
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:01,457
That's what I'm talking about.

745
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,360
But how can you be sure
he's mine?

746
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:08,898
Turbulence.

747
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,841
Hey, Donnie.

748
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,114
Would you like some more?

749
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:26,315
Don't mind if I do.

750
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,217
Okay.

751
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,786
Hmm. Mmm. No, no.

752
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:32,088
Oh, okay.

753
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,344
Oh, okay.

754
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,847
Mmm.

755
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:01,383
Oh, uh, convenient.

756
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:03,612
Yeah, well, I don't have
a lot of time to cook.

757
00:52:03,638 --> 00:52:04,587
I'm a single mother.

758
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:05,721
As you know.

759
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:07,490
Yeah, that's gotta be rough.

760
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,695
So, Donnie, how's school? Uh, What...
What grade are you in?

761
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,266
First? Wow, you gotta be one of the
bigger kids in the class, huh?

762
00:52:17,268 --> 00:52:19,468
No, Donnie, don't
disrespect your father.

763
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,769
He's not my father.

764
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,471
Aha! The plot thickens.

765
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:25,941
No, he means he doesn't
accept you as a father.

766
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,611
Oh. I see.

767
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:33,649
Okay, look, Donnie. I don't blame
you for feeling angry towards me.

768
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,685
If you don't want me to be a
part of your life, I understand.

769
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,320
Good.

770
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,158
It's just as well.

771
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,094
Flying the LA to Chicago route
first thing in the morning anyway.

772
00:52:45,096 --> 00:52:47,596
I'm... I'm sorry again.

773
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,965
- About... About everything.
- Mmm-hmm.

774
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:52,801
Wait.

775
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,604
Dad, are you a pilot?

776
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:01,944
Wait, um, your mother didn't
tell you what I do for a living?

777
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:04,146
She's never told me
anything about you.

778
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:07,183
I've always dreamed of having
a dad who was a pilot.

779
00:53:07,185 --> 00:53:10,219
Son, that look of wide-eyed adoration on
your face makes it hard for me to admit

780
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:12,755
- that I'm only a fly...
- Please say pilot.

781
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:16,325
Ing man. Meaning pilot.
I'm a pilot. I'm a pilot.

782
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:19,828
That is so cool. That's what
I wanna be when I grow up.

783
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,931
Tell me everything about it.
Every single detail.

784
00:53:21,933 --> 00:53:23,799
Son, there is nothing
like the feeling

785
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:26,335
of guiding that bird
up to 36,000 feet.

786
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:27,970
Someday you'll come up with me.

787
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:32,141
Okay. Why don't you two keep talking,
I'm gonna get dessert ready, okay?

788
00:53:32,143 --> 00:53:33,442
Okay.

789
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,647
Wow, there's just so much
I didn't know.

790
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:40,583
Well, now you do.

791
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:42,985
Any questions?

792
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:47,089
Yeah, uh, can you still do it
if there's only one girl?

793
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:49,158
Good question, Son.

794
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,861
And the answer,
believe it or not, is yes.

795
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:54,330
I mean, she won't always
have a hot roommate

796
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:56,565
or a college friend
visiting from out of town.

797
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,034
On those occasions,
you have to make it work.

798
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:01,237
And where can I get
one of these swings?

799
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:04,607
There are catalogs. Online sex shops.
I had mine custom made in Bangkok.

800
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:08,744
But remember, install it properly.
And test it out.

801
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,746
Because you
always wanna have...

802
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:12,948
Safe sex.

803
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,418
Atta boy. That's my boy.
Anything else?

804
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,153
Yeah, just one thing.

805
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:23,826
Should you still do it if you and
the girl are, like, in love?

806
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:27,029
Hmm. I'm gonna have
to say no on that one, Son.

807
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:29,765
There can be a lot
of strings attached.

808
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:33,902
But you know what? You're only 13.
You have so much to learn.

809
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:35,804
I just... I wanted you
to have the basics.

810
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:37,339
Thanks, Dad.
I really appreciate it.

811
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:39,008
Hey, you got it.

812
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,911
Now bring it in here.
Huh? All right. That's my boy.

813
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:49,318
Oh.

814
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,353
Hey, what are you guys
doing in here?

815
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:53,722
Uh, just a little
father-son bondage.

816
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,361
Okay. Uh, Donnie, I'm afraid that
it's time for you to go to bed.

817
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:01,563
- Aww.
- Can Dad stay over?

818
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,201
- If you like, yeah, he can stay.
- Sweet.

819
00:55:06,203 --> 00:55:09,471
The living room? I mean, what
if the kid walks in on us?

820
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,208
Hmm, I don't know.

821
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,420
Oh, um, don't forget
to lock that.

822
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:26,902
It's broken, it tends to release.
So if you...

823
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,224
Yeah, I think I got it.

824
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:38,400
So, how come you never tried to
find me and tell me about Donnie?

825
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:43,205
Um, well, because I was...
I was really angry.

826
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,909
Angry at you for leaving,

827
00:55:46,911 --> 00:55:50,546
and I didn't think you deserved
a son as great as Donnie,

828
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:52,081
and I don't know, I guess
when I saw you at the pool,

829
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:54,883
I thought maybe
the time had come.

830
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:59,021
Well, April,
I wanna do my part.

831
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:02,057
From now on, I'll give you
half my salary for him.

832
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:05,260
Well, I'll give you 25%
of my salary for him.

833
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:08,897
And on his birthday, well, I'll pick
him out something from the sky mall.

834
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,667
A sleep mask, a neck pillow.

835
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:13,402
Perhaps some nice
compression leg sleeves,

836
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:15,838
ideal for improved
circulation on longer flights.

837
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,774
Okay, I think what he'd really like
to have is a father in the picture.

838
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:23,312
I know. You've got to get out there and
start dating while you're still hot.

839
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:24,446
I meant you.

840
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:26,215
Oh.

841
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:31,320
Look, I... I know
that it's a lot to ask,

842
00:56:31,322 --> 00:56:36,859
but if you, I don't know, if you ever stop
flying and settle in the area, you...

843
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:39,128
You could really be
a big part of his life.

844
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,296
Yeah, but how would
I even earn a living?

845
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:44,400
I mean, sure, I could open a
studio and teach the Macarena,

846
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:47,002
but that craze isn't
gonna last forever.

847
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:48,871
April, let's face it.

848
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:52,875
If you couldn't keep me on the
ground, well, nothing could.

849
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,612
Okay, well,
just think about it.

850
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:58,680
Okay.

851
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:06,688
Oh, not right now?

852
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:09,958
Just think about it.

853
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,428
Better yet,
I'll think about it.

854
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,695
- Okay.
- Okay.

855
00:57:13,697 --> 00:57:15,664
Good night, Larry.

856
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:18,534
Hey, uh, maybe
we could have sex.

857
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,437
If you know what I mean.

858
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:24,306
Okay, if you say the actual thing,
then you don't need to say,

859
00:57:24,308 --> 00:57:26,108
"If you know what I mean."

860
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,609
Is that a yes?

861
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:28,844
That's a no.

862
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:29,945
- Got it.
- Okay.

863
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,213
All right.

864
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,302
Oh.

865
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,076
I said no, Larry.

866
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,445
Oh.

867
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,220
Morning, Son.

868
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:15,557
Morning, woman with whom passionate
unprotected fling resulted in son.

869
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,693
Morning.

870
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,194
Where's your hat, Dad?

871
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:22,598
- What hat?
- Your pilot's hat.

872
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,402
Oh, right. I don't like to wear it
when I'm not flying. Too pilot-y.

873
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:30,138
Which I am, of course.
Pilot. I'm a pilot.

874
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,674
Wait, why is your tie
tucked into your shirt?

875
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:35,711
I thought only loser
stewardesses did that.

876
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:36,778
Flight attendants.

877
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:42,384
Is what those losers
prefer to be called,

878
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:45,554
and this tie-tuck is my way
of mocking them.

879
00:58:45,556 --> 00:58:48,090
Losers. Come on,
I'll walk you to school.

880
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:49,858
Oh, actually, I ride a bike.

881
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,226
Not a problem.

882
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:58,333
Hey, Dad. When I grow up, can
I be a pilot just like you?

883
00:58:58,335 --> 00:59:01,069
Of course you can. You can
be anything you want, Son.

884
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:04,473
Just follow your dreams
and go wherever they take you.

885
00:59:04,475 --> 00:59:08,443
The good ones, not the weird ones,
like when you're naked at a funeral.

886
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:09,945
Or naked at a petting zoo.

887
00:59:09,947 --> 00:59:11,947
I got it. Thanks, Dad.

888
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,048
You got it, Son.

889
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:18,453
Let me get that for you, Son.

890
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:20,689
- Thanks, Dad.
- Sure. Straight in there.

891
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:23,058
Hey, look.
It's Donnie Girlparts.

892
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,260
How's your vagina
today, Donnie?

893
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:26,495
Son, you have a vagina?

894
00:59:26,497 --> 00:59:28,330
God, the surprises
just keep coming.

895
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:31,266
No, Dad. They pick on me
'cause they think I'm a wuss.

896
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:33,068
It's no big deal, okay?

897
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,870
I beg to differ.

898
00:59:34,872 --> 00:59:36,872
Hey, you.

899
00:59:36,874 --> 00:59:39,374
This young man here,
he's a Gaye.

900
00:59:39,376 --> 00:59:41,743
And when you mess with a Gaye,

901
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:43,812
you mess with Gayes everywhere.

902
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:46,748
And some of us Gayes have a vicious temper.
You feel me?

903
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,216
You feel me on that?

904
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:50,719
Scram!

905
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:55,691
Thanks, Dad.

906
00:59:55,693 --> 00:59:58,093
Hey, it's what dads do.

907
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:03,398
So, are you gonna be, like,
staying with us from now on?

908
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,602
Well, actually, Son, I...

909
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:10,439
I... I will.

910
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:12,674
Of course I will.

911
01:00:12,676 --> 01:00:15,477
What, do you think I'm just gonna
abandon you like my own father did?

912
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:17,679
That I'm gonna choose
an empty, transient existence

913
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:20,716
over a meaningful life
with a family that loves me?

914
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:23,285
What do you got for a guy who chose
an empty transient existence

915
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:27,623
- over a meaningful life with a
family that loves him? -Scotch?

916
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:30,826
- No, I'm American.
- Sorry, you look Scotch.

917
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:39,668
- You're Gaye, right?
- Yeah.

918
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,904
Thought so.
You remind me of your dad.

919
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:48,443
Ugh!

920
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:12,134
Well, Cecile it looks like your
award-winning flight attendant

921
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:15,837
- is 30 minutes late. -That's
the type of human error

922
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,441
that you never have to worry
about with the Flightpal.

923
01:01:19,443 --> 01:01:22,744
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. Larry's
coming, I know he is. -Uh-huh.

924
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:24,413
Well, he's about
30 minutes late.

925
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:26,214
- Well, maybe he's stuck in
traffic, I don't know. -Really?

926
01:01:26,216 --> 01:01:29,251
- I don't think he's ever gonna show up.
- Trust me, he's a hero.

927
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:31,386
- Mmm-hmm. -He's gonna
save all of our jobs.

928
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:34,990
- I ran out on
my own son, everyone.

929
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:40,228
Yes, I did. Just like
my own father ran out on me.

930
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:45,767
The sins of the fathers laid
on the children of the corn.

931
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:48,937
'Cause I had a chance to stop the
cycle of abandonment. Did I? Did I?

932
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,139
Larry!

933
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:52,661
- No, it's Jack.
- Larry.

934
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,944
Oh, boy, this isn't optimal.

935
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:00,415
- Okay, all right, listen to me.
- Okay.

936
01:02:00,417 --> 01:02:01,616
- Okay?
- Okay.

937
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:03,652
I want you to take
all this shame, okay,

938
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:05,821
all this pain
that you're feeling right now,

939
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,056
and let's use it,
let's channel it.

940
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,758
Let's focus it.

941
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:14,296
Thank you, Nathan.
I needed that.

942
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,769
Phew!

943
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:22,838
My God, you're hot.

944
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:26,675
Look, I've got a full-on
dinosaur bone in my pants,

945
01:02:26,677 --> 01:02:28,478
and it's not going away
any time soon.

946
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:33,115
Yeah, let's do this.

947
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,356
Attendants ready.

948
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,459
- And go!

949
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,599
And brew!

950
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,143
Good.

951
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,531
Oh!

952
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:58,733
Ow!

953
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:12,247
Here we go,
are you ready for this?

954
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:13,849
- Yeah! -All right, she's
just a sexy robot.

955
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:16,117
Just a sexy robot.
You're Larry Gaye.

956
01:04:16,119 --> 01:04:18,854
Go! Go get her.

957
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,225
What does this test measure?

958
01:04:23,227 --> 01:04:25,627
We just thought it'd be fun
to watch.

959
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:26,862
- Okay.

960
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,920
Move!

961
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:53,121
Oh!

962
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,236
Nathan!

963
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:11,640
- Nathan!
- Right here.

964
01:05:11,642 --> 01:05:15,343
Nathan, Nathan,
I've done it, Nathan.

965
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:19,080
- I've done it.
- No, you didn't.

966
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:22,196
- I didn't?
- You didn't.

967
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,152
- Oh.
- It was ugly.

968
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:25,587
Oh.

969
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:32,861
- Okay, Nate, so how am I doing?
- All right, I've got you down

970
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:36,765
30 points to none.

971
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:40,068
- With one event left. -Huh. I
felt it was closer than that.

972
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,171
- It's not. -Well, how can I
possibly make up 30 points?

973
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:45,173
<i>Because customer service</i>
<i>is so important,</i>

974
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:47,242
<i>this final event</i>
<i>is worth 31 points.</i>

975
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,543
- Hmm.
- Wow, that's convenient.

976
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:53,248
<i>We're going to present a customer service
problem and see who can best solve it.</i>

977
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,550
<i>It's dinner time</i>
<i>we have two entrees,</i>

978
01:05:55,552 --> 01:05:58,253
<i>barbeque chicken</i>
<i>and pasta primavera.</i>

979
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:00,722
<i>The problem is,</i>
<i>you're all out of pasta.</i>

980
01:06:02,558 --> 01:06:05,193
Good evening, folks,
for dinner we have

981
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:08,730
barbeque chicken
or stewed muskrat testicles.

982
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:10,966
- I'll have the chicken.
- Of course you will.

983
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:15,670
I have barbeque chicken
or vomit encrusted rat legs.

984
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:18,106
Barbeque chicken.
- Now, that's programing.

985
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:22,510
Uh, barbeque chicken or the

986
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:27,749
sauteed anus of a skunk served on a
bed of the anuses of other skunks.

987
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:29,517
I'll take the chicken.

988
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:33,555
Barbeque chicken or toe nail fungus in a
broth of hobo saliva and crotch sweat.

989
01:06:33,557 --> 01:06:37,425
Barbeque chicken or, uh,
bubonic plague

990
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:40,395
garnished with pigeon droppings
and the hand-fluffed pubes

991
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:43,765
of a fat, old eczema sufferer
who just ran a 10k.

992
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:45,300
Chicken sounds good.
- Yeah.

993
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:48,203
Barbeque chicken or
dingleberry-crusted rat tartar

994
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:52,440
drizzled with pus, served with a
warm mug of curdled liposuction fat.

995
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:53,842
Chicken, please.
- Um...

996
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:57,879
Barbeque chicken or...
Or, um...

997
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:02,384
- Or lobster. I...
- Oh, I'll have the lobster.

998
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:05,387
Yeah, fuck chicken, I want the lobster too.
- I don't have lobster.

999
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:07,605
I only have barbeque chicken.
I couldn't think

1000
01:07:07,631 --> 01:07:09,491
of anything else disgusting.
I give up.

1001
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:11,259
Larry Gaye gives up.

1002
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,265
I am amazed.

1003
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,969
I am amazed.

1004
01:07:20,971 --> 01:07:24,172
<i>The winner, by a score</i>
<i>of 61 points to zero,</i>

1005
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:27,208
<i>-is Sally the Flightpal.</i>

1006
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,884
Ugh!

1007
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,355
I don't know how you lost.
You were down by 30 points.

1008
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:43,291
But when they said the last event was
for 31, I thought for sure you'd win.

1009
01:07:43,293 --> 01:07:46,261
Nah, things like that only
happen in the movies, Nathan.

1010
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:47,896
This is real life.

1011
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,697
But how did she know how to
do that with the arm tray?

1012
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:52,267
I mean, it's like she knew
my every move. But how?

1013
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:54,502
Isabella.

1014
01:07:56,939 --> 01:08:00,508
The woman who seduced me and with
whom I shared all my secrets,

1015
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:02,977
and then never heard
from again.

1016
01:08:02,979 --> 01:08:06,681
You came to support me. I'm truly
touched, that is so sweet.

1017
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:08,016
I don't think that's
what happened, Lar.

1018
01:08:08,018 --> 01:08:10,318
I think she plied you
for information

1019
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,754
- and used it against you.
- -Oh.

1020
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:15,623
Pardon my sidekick,
he's embarrassingly naive.

1021
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:19,260
- How have you been? -Oh, no,
he's right, Larry. I'm sorry.

1022
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:22,597
You deceiving tramp. I never
wanna see your lying face again.

1023
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:27,335
My God, you are so hot! Any
chance you're free for dinner?

1024
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:31,139
- No.
- Lunch, tomorrow? Breakfast?

1025
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:33,141
God! I'm such an idiot!

1026
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:36,878
I've ruined flight attending
for everyone.

1027
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,581
Everyone! <i> Everyone!</i>

1028
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:54,295
<i>You can be anything you want, Son.
Just follow your dreams</i>

1029
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,865
<i>and go wherever they take you.</i>

1030
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:59,601
- <i> Federated Airlines.</i>

1031
01:08:59,603 --> 01:09:04,839
Hi, this is Larry Gaye. I seem to
have forgotten my next assignment.

1032
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:06,641
Could you tell me
where my next flight is?

1033
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,510
<i>Oh, hi, Larry, it's Cristal.</i>

1034
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:12,347
<i>You've got Flight 37 to Buenos Aires,
leaves San Fran tonight at 10:00.</i>

1035
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:16,451
- Thank you. <i> -Hey, Larry,
what are you wearing?</i>

1036
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:20,188
- Jeans and a hoodie from GAP kids.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1037
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:36,504
- Okay, have a nice flight.
- Mmm-hmm.

1038
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:41,009
- May I help you? -Hi, can I
get a ticket from Los Angeles

1039
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:43,444
to San Francisco, and continuing
on from San Francisco

1040
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:45,146
to Buenos Aires, please?

1041
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:48,249
Sorry, I'm not allowed to sell
tickets to unaccompanied minors.

1042
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:58,459
I'd like a ticket from Los Angeles to
San Francisco, then on to Buenos Aires.

1043
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:02,063
Sorry, I'm not allowed to sell
tickets to unaccompanied miners.

1044
01:10:02,065 --> 01:10:05,466
Oh, no,
actually we're together. So...

1045
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,802
Oh, perfect!

1046
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:27,922
Jeez. What happened? Who
brought herpes to the orgy?

1047
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:29,390
Larry, look.

1048
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,930
- She has herpes? Thanks
for the heads-up. -No!

1049
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:39,300
That's the Flightpal. They say
within a year, we'll all be gone.

1050
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:42,136
- It's devastating. -You say
that like it's my fault.

1051
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:46,507
As if I lost some sort of flight
attending contest to save our jobs.

1052
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:48,610
You did.
That's exactly what happened.

1053
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:51,613
- Disagree not to agree.
- You're just combining words.

1054
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:52,981
Correctly.

1055
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:06,261
- Sir, can I get you a drink?
- Bourbon, rocks.

1056
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:09,197
It sure does, but I'm afraid I
can't serve alcohol to miners.

1057
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:13,768
- Sparkling water.
- Very well.

1058
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:20,108
- Sir, can I get you a... Son?
- Dad!

1059
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,144
What are you doing here?

1060
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:26,114
Well, I took your advice. You
told me to follow my dreams,

1061
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:28,616
and my dreams are to fly
and be with you.

1062
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,152
Donnie, I can't
be a part of this.

1063
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:32,553
I mean, your mother's
probably worried sick.

1064
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:35,456
You get off this plane
and go home, this minute.

1065
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:37,625
- We're at 32,000 feet.
- Right.

1066
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,927
Whatever you do,
do not get off this plane,

1067
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:43,398
but we're gonna talk more about
this when we get to Buenos Aires.

1068
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,300
Hey, Dad?

1069
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:48,670
What are you doing back here
serving drinks?

1070
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:51,172
Aren't you supposed to be
up front in the cockpit?

1071
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:56,144
And that's how you serve
a drink,

1072
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:58,479
you lowly, wussified
flight attendant.

1073
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,815
God! Don't make me come
back here and show you again.

1074
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,885
- I'm way too busy flying the plane.
- But, Larry...

1075
01:12:03,887 --> 01:12:07,155
Larry? Who's Larry? I'm not Larry.
It's Captain Gaye to you.

1076
01:12:07,157 --> 01:12:10,425
Hey! That's my nickname.

1077
01:12:10,427 --> 01:12:14,595
Huh. Okay.
I've gotta get back to work.

1078
01:12:14,597 --> 01:12:18,833
In the cockpit, of course. Which
is where I belong, being a pilot.

1079
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,001
I'm a pilot.

1080
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,216
- Look who it is.

1081
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:38,993
What are you doing
up here, Gaye?

1082
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:43,825
My son is on board and he
doesn't know I'm only a...

1083
01:12:43,827 --> 01:12:45,526
- Flying waitress?
- Sissy man?

1084
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,495
Ass pansy?

1085
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,698
Come on, guys.
Give me a break, okay?

1086
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,901
Just let me stay up here for a
while so he doesn't find out.

1087
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,904
Can't help you, Gaye.
It's against regulations.

1088
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:09,617
Hey, why is our fuel level
dropping precipitously?

1089
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,487
I don't know.

1090
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,628
Good night.

1091
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:26,768
Donnie?

1092
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:40,415
<i>Dear Mom, sorry to sneak out,
but I had to go find Dad.</i>

1093
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:42,383
<i>I rigged the CD recording</i>
<i>to start playing</i>

1094
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:44,519
<i>when you picked up</i>
<i>that blank piece of paper.</i>

1095
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:45,987
<i>Hope it all worked.</i>

1096
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,189
Oh, my God.

1097
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:59,600
Uh, Lar? We were supposed to start
dinner service an hour ago.

1098
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:02,069
Hey, I think we can
wait a while.

1099
01:14:02,071 --> 01:14:05,506
Larry, you can't avoid facing the
truth with your son forever.

1100
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:08,309
He'll accept you
whether you're a pilot

1101
01:14:08,311 --> 01:14:10,978
- or a flight attendant. -That's
really great advice, Nate.

1102
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,749
Sally, would you mind covering dinner
in coach for me with Nathan here?

1103
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:18,119
I'm just... I'm trying to avoid being seen.
It's a long story.

1104
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:19,353
But I was assigned
to first class.

1105
01:14:19,355 --> 01:14:22,924
- Come on, have a heart.
- But I don't have a heart.

1106
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:25,593
- Do you have to take
everything so literally? -Yes.

1107
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:33,134
- Fine. Fine.
- Dinner?

1108
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:38,139
Must be a break
in one of the lines.

1109
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:41,108
According to this,
we're losing fuel like crazy.

1110
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,978
This is Federated Flight 37,
we've got a situation.

1111
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,614
Chicken and rice, please.

1112
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:53,488
Uh, ma'am, we have baked ziti
and chicken with wild rice.

1113
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:55,490
Chicken and rice, please. -Dad?

1114
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,161
- Oh.
- Dad, are you really a pilot?

1115
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:03,364
Yeah, I'm just helping out while
the plane's on autopilot.

1116
01:15:03,366 --> 01:15:06,100
- <i> Folks, we've just</i>
<i>switched off autopilot,</i>

1117
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:08,536
<i>we're expecting</i>
<i>some possible turbulence.</i>

1118
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:11,973
Oh, that's Felder, my co-pilot,
and I am his captain.

1119
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:14,242
<i>Uh...</i>
<i>This is Captain Bryce,</i>

1120
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:15,843
<i>just want to let you know</i>
<i>you're in good hands</i>

1121
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:17,912
<i>with me and my co-pilot,</i>
<i>Felder, up here.</i>

1122
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:20,181
<i>It's the two of us flying</i>
<i>this plane,</i>

1123
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:23,384
<i>definitely no one else</i>
<i>in the cockpit.</i>

1124
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:26,888
Dad?

1125
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,924
Oh, Son,
you're too smart for me.

1126
01:15:29,926 --> 01:15:31,392
I'm...

1127
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,161
I'm a...

1128
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:35,496
I'm a flight attendant.

1129
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,700
Why did you lie to me?

1130
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:43,905
I just felt that if you knew, you'd
judge me or think less of me.

1131
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:45,273
I guess it was just
my own insecurity.

1132
01:15:45,275 --> 01:15:46,541
I should have
given you more credit.

1133
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:48,442
You pussy! You're pathetic!

1134
01:15:48,444 --> 01:15:51,812
Okay, my dad's a waitress
with wings. A sissy man.

1135
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:54,148
Don't forget ass pansy.

1136
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,328
<i>Uh...</i>

1137
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:11,660
<i>At this time, we'd like
to ask flight attendant</i>

1138
01:16:11,686 --> 01:16:14,535
<i>Larry Gaye to report
to the cockpit.</i>

1139
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:17,305
<i>To all you passengers,</i>
<i>nothing to worry about,</i>

1140
01:16:17,307 --> 01:16:20,207
<i>certainly no blown</i>
<i>fuel lines or</i>

1141
01:16:20,209 --> 01:16:21,976
<i>anything of that nature.</i>

1142
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,382
Gaye, we think
the main fuel line is blown,

1143
01:16:28,384 --> 01:16:31,185
and we might have to make
an emergency landing.

1144
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:35,089
And, well, neither of us have
actually ever done one before.

1145
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,725
And back in flight school,
you were the best at it.

1146
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:40,227
So, we're sorry.

1147
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:42,563
You gotta help us, Larry.
We're scared.

1148
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:47,435
You spent all those years abusing me,
and now, all of a sudden, you need me.

1149
01:16:47,437 --> 01:16:51,639
I don't know, guys, I mean, I'm
just a lowly waitress with wings.

1150
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:55,176
A sissy man, an ass pansy,
if you will.

1151
01:16:55,178 --> 01:16:58,946
How could I possibly help you
big, strong, superior pilots?

1152
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,349
Look, we're sorry for all
the stuff that we ever said.

1153
01:17:01,351 --> 01:17:03,017
Yeah, yeah, we never meant it.

1154
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:05,519
You know, I do.
I say these things sometimes.

1155
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:07,188
- Well...
- I don't know why.

1156
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:10,891
- All right, it's okay.
- I'm not a good person, Larry.

1157
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:13,961
- I forgive you. Now...
- My mom didn't hold me enough,

1158
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:17,131
and when she did, it was
always at a weird distance.

1159
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,532
Like...

1160
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:23,404
The way you'd hold
a spool of barbed wire,

1161
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:27,341
or an angry raccoon,
not a lonely little boy.

1162
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:31,245
Maybe to compensate, my grandmother
was overly affectionate.

1163
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:35,049
She would hold me tight
against her ample bosom,

1164
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:39,754
keep me nestled in there long after
it became difficult to breathe.

1165
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,455
And yet,

1166
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:44,258
on one level,

1167
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:47,628
I think I liked it.

1168
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:50,564
She smelled like
nutmeg. Autumn.

1169
01:17:51,867 --> 01:17:53,701
Okay, guys, listen, we need...

1170
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:55,069
I once pleasured myself

1171
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:58,105
to the image of my grandma
jumping on a trampoline.

1172
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:02,877
I will help land the plane.

1173
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,080
Up.

1174
01:18:08,617 --> 01:18:14,021
Oh, but first, Captain Felder,
I'll need a cup of coffee.

1175
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:18,159
One sugar and just
a skosh of cream.

1176
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:22,563
Federated 37 to ground control.

1177
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:24,965
<i>Come in, Bryce.</i>
<i>You got Herb Donkins here.</i>

1178
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:26,767
Actually, there's been
a slight change, Herb.

1179
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:28,969
From now on, the man
you'll be talking to is Gaye.

1180
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:32,273
<i>Oh! Well, good for you, Bryce.</i>
<i>Have you told your wife?</i>

1181
01:18:32,275 --> 01:18:34,408
No, Larry Gaye.
I'm a flight attendant,

1182
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,043
and I'm gonna bring
this bird down.

1183
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,978
<i>Well, that's against FAA rules.</i>

1184
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:42,583
Look, if you want these people
on the ground in one piece,

1185
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:46,353
then I'm bringing her down.
Now, here's what I'm thinking.

1186
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:49,006
If we have enough fuel
to reach the ocean...

1187
01:18:49,032 --> 01:18:49,890
-<i> Larry...</i>

1188
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:53,828
- What? Hello? Hello?
<i>- Larry?</i>

1189
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:56,163
Come in.
Come in, damn it.

1190
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:58,032
Okay, you don't have to yell.

1191
01:18:58,034 --> 01:18:59,834
I left room in case
you want some more cream.

1192
01:18:59,836 --> 01:19:01,368
I can't hear a damn thing!

1193
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:04,038
I said I left room in case you
want to add some more cream!

1194
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,506
Damn it! Where'd you go?

1195
01:19:05,508 --> 01:19:07,842
To get coffee,
like you asked me to!

1196
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,345
Would you like some Chardonnay?

1197
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:14,181
- <i> Or perhaps some Cabernet-Franc</i>
- What the hell is that?

1198
01:19:14,183 --> 01:19:16,817
It's a combination
of Cabernet and Merlot,

1199
01:19:16,819 --> 01:19:20,321
pairs well with savory meats
like pork, lamb.

1200
01:19:20,323 --> 01:19:21,889
The signals are crossed
with the Flightpal.

1201
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:23,157
That's why
we've lost our radio.

1202
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:25,039
Somebody's gotta
take out the Flightpal.

1203
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,994
Bryce, hold our course.

1204
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:28,095
I'll be right back.

1205
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:37,872
- Coffee smells good.
- Don't touch anything.

1206
01:19:37,874 --> 01:19:39,740
Hey, Larry,
what the hell is going on?

1207
01:19:39,742 --> 01:19:41,108
What's this about
a blown fuel line?

1208
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,209
No time to explain.

1209
01:19:49,919 --> 01:19:51,919
Take that, robot bitch.

1210
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:53,921
Uh, Larry.

1211
01:19:53,923 --> 01:19:55,055
That's not her.

1212
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:56,497
- No?
- No.

1213
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,861
There you are.

1214
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:03,164
- May I help you?
- Yes, you may.

1215
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,441
I said power down
all electronic devices.

1216
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:21,348
Dad, what's goin' on?

1217
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:23,751
Son, how would you like
to come up to the cockpit

1218
01:20:23,753 --> 01:20:27,855
and watch your old man attempt an
incredibly dangerous emergency landing?

1219
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:38,666
This is Federated 37 to ground control.
Come in, ground control.

1220
01:20:38,668 --> 01:20:41,335
<i>Uh, we read you, Larry, but
you're dropping like a stone.</i>

1221
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,972
According to our gauge, we have
about 30 miles of air left.

1222
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:46,974
We're about 30 miles
from Los Angeles.

1223
01:20:46,976 --> 01:20:48,909
Then that's where we're going.

1224
01:20:48,911 --> 01:20:50,811
Can we get clearance at LAX?

1225
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:53,247
Okay, we're gonna clear all runways.
Take your pick.

1226
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:57,284
Wait, um, would it make more sense to put
the plane towards a less populated area,

1227
01:20:57,286 --> 01:20:59,353
in case we don't have
enough fuel to make it?

1228
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:01,789
Son, this is no time
for naive questions.

1229
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:04,258
It's time for heroic
yet impulsive actions.

1230
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:06,527
Now remember, every second...

1231
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,532
- Larry?
- Dad?

1232
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:16,971
Yeah, he's, um...
He's 13 years old,

1233
01:21:16,973 --> 01:21:18,672
and I think he's on
one of your flights.

1234
01:21:18,674 --> 01:21:20,241
<i>And in a bizarre turn of
events, we've learned that</i>

1235
01:21:20,243 --> 01:21:22,676
<i>- a flight attendant is going to attempt...
</i> -Do you know Larry Gaye?

1236
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:25,346
- He could be with him, right?
<i>- ...an emergency landing at LAX.</i>

1237
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:27,281
<i>As this harrowing story</i>
<i>develops,</i>

1238
01:21:27,283 --> 01:21:30,317
<i>we're joined by flight
attendant Steven Slater.</i>

1239
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:31,785
<i>Hi, Tanya, great to be here.</i>

1240
01:21:31,787 --> 01:21:32,887
<i>He's the former...</i>

1241
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,928
Cheese and crackers,
how did we get so low?

1242
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,296
You fell asleep.

1243
01:21:42,298 --> 01:21:44,265
<i>Larry, you are</i>
<i>eight miles from LAX.</i>

1244
01:21:44,267 --> 01:21:45,966
<i>How much fuel do you have left?</i>

1245
01:21:45,968 --> 01:21:48,569
Uh, not eight miles' worth.

1246
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:51,071
There's only one thing
we can do.

1247
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,274
- Urban Landing.
- Don't be an idiot.

1248
01:21:53,276 --> 01:21:55,376
- It's far too risky.
- It's never been done.

1249
01:21:57,178 --> 01:21:59,179
Nathan, I need you up here now.

1250
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:01,749
Herb, we can't make it
to the airport.

1251
01:22:01,751 --> 01:22:03,984
I'm going to bring her down
in the city.

1252
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:07,054
Passengers are kind of freakin'
out back there. So I thought...

1253
01:22:07,056 --> 01:22:08,322
Get your priorities
straight, Nathan.

1254
01:22:08,324 --> 01:22:10,157
This is gonna be huge.

1255
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:11,592
Herb, did you read me?

1256
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:13,460
We need to land in the city.

1257
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:16,463
<i>I am sorry, Larry.</i>
<i>My shift is ending.</i>

1258
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:18,599
<i>I'm gonna have to turn you</i>
<i>over to Russ Peterson.</i>

1259
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,734
<i>- Have a good one.</i>
- What? You can't do that.

1260
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:23,737
<i>Hey, Larry, Russ Peterson here.</i>

1261
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:26,707
Uh, okay, Russ,
we're in a dire emergency.

1262
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:29,243
- We're gonna run out of fuel any second.
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

1263
01:22:29,245 --> 01:22:30,945
<i>Hold on, Larry,</i>
<i>I just got here.</i>

1264
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:32,446
<i>Give me a chance to settle in.</i>

1265
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,214
<i>Okay, I'm just...</i>

1266
01:22:34,216 --> 01:22:35,916
<i>I'm taking my jacket off.</i>

1267
01:22:35,918 --> 01:22:38,385
<i>Hey, is that a birthday cake?</i>
<i>Who's birthday is it?</i>

1268
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:43,824
<i>Happy birthday, big thug. Come
here, let me give you a hug.</i>

1269
01:22:43,826 --> 01:22:46,327
<i>Okay, I'm just going to grab</i>
<i>myself a little cake here.</i>

1270
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:59,773
<i>Okay, I'm back.</i>
<i>Now, you were saying?</i>

1271
01:22:59,775 --> 01:23:03,444
We're running out of fuel. I need
to land this plane in Los Angeles.

1272
01:23:03,446 --> 01:23:06,647
<i>- Larry, that's never...</i> -I know,
it's never, but I'm doing it now.

1273
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:08,849
Son...

1274
01:23:08,851 --> 01:23:11,352
If we don't make it,
I just want you to know,

1275
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:14,355
- I love you.
- We might not make it?

1276
01:23:14,357 --> 01:23:16,490
Of course
we're going to make it.

1277
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,492
- Huh, yeah
- Yeah.

1278
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:21,595
<i>Just how good are you?</i>

1279
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:24,164
<i>Damn, he's good.</i>

1280
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:27,434
<i>You're a legend.</i>

1281
01:23:27,436 --> 01:23:30,270
<i>Just follow your dreams</i>
<i>and go wherever they take you.</i>

1282
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:33,340
<i>I have a private bunk</i>

1283
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,776
<i>with the only bathtub</i>
<i>in this whole facility.</i>

1284
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:40,214
<i>Larry? Do you read me?
</i> -Okay. Roger, Russ.

1285
01:23:40,216 --> 01:23:42,716
This is Federated 37 heavy,
coming in on

1286
01:23:42,718 --> 01:23:47,321
uncleared course 45, vector
16, bearing two-niner-zero.

1287
01:23:47,323 --> 01:23:48,455
Urban landing.

1288
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:50,858
I repeat, urban landing.

1289
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,593
<i>Roger that, Captain Gaye.</i>

1290
01:23:52,595 --> 01:23:55,396
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your pilot speaking.

1291
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:57,731
Prepare for arrival.

1292
01:23:57,733 --> 01:24:00,734
Oh, and if we survive, baggage
can be found on carousel 3.

1293
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:25,192
Uh, do I have space?

1294
01:24:25,194 --> 01:24:27,127
Wait, wait, wait,
after the minivan.

1295
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,650
Uh, this guy's going to
let us in. Thank you.

1296
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:52,019
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1297
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:55,522
Okay, okay, okay.

1298
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:57,691
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1299
01:25:00,596 --> 01:25:03,530
<i>Wheels down. Repeat, we have</i>
<i>wheels on the ground.</i>

1300
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:05,666
Oh! Oh, thank God, Larry.

1301
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:07,909
<i>Completed an urban landing</i>
<i>on a southbound freeway.</i>

1302
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:16,310
- Ah! You're one
cool customer, Gaye.

1303
01:25:16,312 --> 01:25:18,645
I would've peed in my pants.

1304
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:20,547
Ha! That's ridiculous.

1305
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:23,250
Larry! Larry! Larry!

1306
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,722
Dad, I'm sorry I thought

1307
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:30,791
it was lame to be
a flight attendant.

1308
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:34,528
That's okay, Son. Look, if it's one thing
that I teach you in this lifetime,

1309
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,530
it's that, well,

1310
01:25:36,532 --> 01:25:40,334
it's that flight attendants pull
every bit as much ass as pilots.

1311
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:43,403
- Love you, Dad.
- Thanks, Son.

1312
01:25:43,405 --> 01:25:44,805
Bring it here.

1313
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:51,311
Okay, Lar, let's just
get off at this exit,

1314
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,147
and we can head
back to the airport.

1315
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:54,681
Not yet.

1316
01:25:54,683 --> 01:25:56,550
I got a stop to make first.

1317
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:47,067
Uh, yep. There it is.

1318
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:18,699
Donnie!

1319
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:23,470
Cross your arms.

1320
01:27:37,152 --> 01:27:39,453
My goodness, Donnie!

1321
01:27:39,455 --> 01:27:41,622
Donnie, I was worried sick!

1322
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:50,230
I'm sorry. I just
really missed Dad.

1323
01:27:50,232 --> 01:27:53,500
Well, honey, you're gonna have
to learn how to deal with that.

1324
01:27:53,502 --> 01:27:55,703
Daddy doesn't live here.
His home is in the sky.

1325
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:57,671
Go get into bed, okay?

1326
01:27:57,673 --> 01:27:59,273
Okay.

1327
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:04,578
Bye, Dad.

1328
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:06,480
Bye, Son.

1329
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:10,684
Thanks for bringing him home.

1330
01:28:11,786 --> 01:28:13,387
Actually,

1331
01:28:13,389 --> 01:28:15,789
I did a little thinking
up there,

1332
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:19,092
while I was saving 200 people
from a fiery death.

1333
01:28:20,161 --> 01:28:21,428
Yeah?

1334
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:22,696
I thought about how,

1335
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:27,401
of all the great times
I've had in my life,

1336
01:28:27,403 --> 01:28:30,237
the greatest, the greatest,

1337
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:32,806
was the time I spent with you.

1338
01:28:35,209 --> 01:28:36,877
Then why did you leave?

1339
01:28:36,879 --> 01:28:39,112
Because I was an idiot,

1340
01:28:39,114 --> 01:28:41,481
who thought that
not being tied down

1341
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:43,884
and going from woman to woman

1342
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:45,919
to woman, to, in some cases,

1343
01:28:45,921 --> 01:28:48,522
- women, plural.
- Go on.

1344
01:28:48,524 --> 01:28:50,490
Would be a fun,
fulfilling lifestyle,

1345
01:28:50,492 --> 01:28:53,860
but the truth is,
it was soulless and empty.

1346
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:57,264
All that meaningless sex
was just filling a hole.

1347
01:28:57,266 --> 01:28:58,899
And by hole,
I don't mean vagina.

1348
01:28:58,901 --> 01:29:00,967
Or in some cases, I guess
I do mean vagina.

1349
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:02,135
I know what you mean.

1350
01:29:02,137 --> 01:29:03,370
April...

1351
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,040
Is there any chance you could

1352
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:08,575
see your way clear to

1353
01:29:08,577 --> 01:29:10,077
taking this idiot back?

1354
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:13,313
Oh, gosh, Larry.

1355
01:29:13,315 --> 01:29:15,782
Did you really think you could
just waltz back into my life

1356
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:19,386
because you were finally ready and
I'd be sitting here waiting for you?

1357
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,155
Kind of, yeah.

1358
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:28,428
Oh, no.

1359
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:31,031
It's too late.

1360
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,733
You've moved on.

1361
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:34,868
You were the one thing
in my life

1362
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,236
that was real and true,

1363
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:37,571
and I blew it.

1364
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:40,073
Gah!

1365
01:29:40,075 --> 01:29:42,376
How could I have thought
you would've waited for me?

1366
01:29:42,378 --> 01:29:44,544
Stupid Larry! Stupid Larry!

1367
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,348
God, please,

1368
01:29:48,350 --> 01:29:51,651
let me drown in this
ocean of despair.

1369
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:54,221
Without this woman in my life,

1370
01:29:54,989 --> 01:29:57,057
I don't want to live.

1371
01:29:57,059 --> 01:29:58,925
I don't want to live!

1372
01:29:58,927 --> 01:30:00,460
Murphy bed's all fixed.

1373
01:30:00,462 --> 01:30:01,695
Thank you, Karl.

1374
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:04,264
Oh.

1375
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:07,434
Larry...

1376
01:30:07,436 --> 01:30:10,203
Listen, when you left and I
never heard from you again,

1377
01:30:10,205 --> 01:30:12,139
that hurt me.

1378
01:30:12,141 --> 01:30:16,643
But when you left Donnie, that
didn't just hurt me, that hurt him.

1379
01:30:16,645 --> 01:30:19,413
I know, and I didn't
want to leave.

1380
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:22,916
But I didn't believe I could
be any better at fatherhood

1381
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:24,885
than my own father was.

1382
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:29,055
But then I landed
that plane safely,

1383
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:32,092
and I realized that
I can take care of my son.

1384
01:30:32,094 --> 01:30:34,795
And being with him,
and being with you,

1385
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:38,965
that'll keep me
on the ground for good.

1386
01:30:38,967 --> 01:30:40,887
So you'll really
not fly anymore?

1387
01:30:45,106 --> 01:30:46,206
Oh!

1388
01:30:47,074 --> 01:30:49,142
Well, that is
shockingly painful.

1389
01:30:49,144 --> 01:30:51,411
Like, more than
I would have ever imagined.

1390
01:30:51,413 --> 01:30:53,780
Come here,
Larry Elizabeth Gaye.

1391
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:56,850
I'm coming,
April Elizabeth Fornicowsky.

1392
01:30:56,852 --> 01:30:58,852
And by coming, I mean
approaching, not ejaculating...

1393
01:30:58,854 --> 01:31:00,353
I know what you mean.

1394
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:06,193
Aww!

1395
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:17,337
Donnie! Donnie!

1396
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:22,509
Daddy's staying.

1397
01:31:22,511 --> 01:31:24,444
- Really?
- Yes, really.

1398
01:31:29,584 --> 01:31:31,785
It's okay, guys. You can go.

1399
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,416
And so, I retired my apron,

1400
01:32:03,418 --> 01:32:07,153
leaving the door open for
someone else to finally win

1401
01:32:07,155 --> 01:32:08,722
the Golden Coffee Pot.

1402
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:12,726
And because of the way the wiring
interfered with the plane's radios,

1403
01:32:12,728 --> 01:32:17,531
Federated Airlines was forced to
abandon the Flightpal project.

1404
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:20,233
Three weeks after
that fateful flight,

1405
01:32:20,235 --> 01:32:23,236
I landed April,
my beautiful bride

1406
01:32:23,238 --> 01:32:24,838
and mother of my wonderful,

1407
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,408
and no longer bastard,
son Donnie.

1408
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,582
And the feeling of
crushing empty loneliness

1409
01:32:30,608 --> 01:32:32,512
that dogged me through
the years, well,

1410
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:34,714
turned out to be
a gluten allergy.

1411
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:36,349
Six months later,
I found myself

1412
01:32:36,351 --> 01:32:38,652
at a bookstore in downtown LA,

1413
01:32:38,654 --> 01:32:41,988
reading this last chapter
of my book.

1414
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:44,124
And then something
unbelievable happened.

1415
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:46,960
I looked up and saw...

1416
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:55,468
Dad?

1417
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,008
Dad!

1418
01:33:04,512 --> 01:33:05,845
It's me!

1419
01:33:08,783 --> 01:33:10,617
- Larry.
- Larry. Larry.

1420
01:33:12,554 --> 01:33:14,621
You look wonderful, Son.

1421
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:18,959
You too, Dad.

1422
01:33:18,961 --> 01:33:22,829
You must have come to ask my forgiveness
for walking out all those years ago,

1423
01:33:22,831 --> 01:33:25,231
and to beg me to allow
you back into my life.

1424
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:30,503
That's exactly right,
Larry, that's why I'm here.

1425
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:34,474
Well, there was a time...

1426
01:33:34,476 --> 01:33:38,778
There was a time I would've told you to
stick several unwieldy objects in your ass.

1427
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,782
A porcupine, a six iron

1428
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,718
a French horn,

1429
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,286
ceramic pineapple.

1430
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:48,555
But...

1431
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:52,659
I've learned a little
something about fatherhood.

1432
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:57,664
So...

1433
01:33:58,866 --> 01:34:00,166
Whoo!

1434
01:34:00,935 --> 01:34:02,402
I forgive you, Dad.

1435
01:34:02,404 --> 01:34:03,804
- Oh...
- Welcome back into my life.

1436
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:05,205
Oh!

1437
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:08,308
Thank God.
Thank God!

1438
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:10,310
Oh, that is...

1439
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:12,979
- That is such a huge relief.
- Oh!

1440
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:14,247
I know.
- Boy, oh, boy.

1441
01:34:14,249 --> 01:34:16,549
I know.

1442
01:34:16,551 --> 01:34:18,618
- For me, too. For me, too.
- Yeah, yeah.

1443
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:21,521
Uh...

1444
01:34:21,523 --> 01:34:23,723
You got to give me a second.
I got to move my car.

1445
01:34:23,725 --> 01:34:25,825
- I'm double parked.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1446
01:34:27,062 --> 01:34:28,561
I'll be right back.

1447
01:34:28,563 --> 01:34:29,763
- You got it, Dad.
- You got it.

1448
01:34:29,765 --> 01:34:30,897
You got it.

1449
01:34:30,899 --> 01:34:33,199
- You got it!

1450
01:34:39,907 --> 01:34:41,041
Ah!

1451
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:47,614
I can't wait to resume
my relationship with that guy.

1452
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:49,582
Oh!

1453
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:52,185
Uh...

1454
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:54,888
Anyway, anyway...

1455
01:34:56,257 --> 01:34:58,825
Then I closed the book

1456
01:34:58,827 --> 01:35:00,493
to thunderous applause.

1457
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:08,935
Uh, it said
"thunderous applause."

1458
01:37:05,954 --> 01:37:07,687
- Four seems like plenty.
- Fine.
