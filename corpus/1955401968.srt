1
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,164
For as long as can be remembered,
storks delivered babies

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,169
from their perch on Stork Mountain.

3
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,211
It was an honor and a privilege to serve.

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,001
It was our duty, our core belief,

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,926
the driving force of our very lifeblood.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,490
Aw... Ow!

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,645
It wasn't always easy.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,040
Oh...

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,771
This was our challenge.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,765
This was our sacred duty.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,162
No matter how tough or impossible

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,565
or brutal or harsh or inhumane or savage,

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,007
we would triumph over adversity.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,560
Phew!

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,564
Gotcha!

16
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,130
Oh!

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,362
Hey.

18
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,686
- On your right.
- Left.

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,841
Bike lane.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,527
Thank goodness we don't do that anymore.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,401
There! Right there!

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,930
The problem was, we had the wrong cargo.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,368
Our new phones!

24
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,605
Luckily, now, storks deliver
packages for Cornerstore. com!

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,885
- My dude!
- Oh, yeah!

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,887
Yo, Kevron! Lookin' good, my man!

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,769
Oh, I love this guy!

28
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,201
Perfect landing. Chiggy-check.

29
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,405
You're the man!

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,411
What? Millionth package? Not possible.

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,210
I thought I was only at 20.

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,771
Hey, Junior, are you gonna celebrate?

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,241
You know what? You're right.
I should celebrate.

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,561
What are you guys doing this weekend?

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,721
Are you guys free?

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,928
The wife and I
are celebrating another anniversary.

37
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,730
Got my kid's game this weekend.

38
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,526
Family reunion. The whole family's coming.

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,961
Oh. Just wanted to confirm.

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,161
That you were all busy.

41
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,890
I assumed you were all busy and you are.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,201
So, if anything changes, let me know.

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,361
I maybe could get out of work.

44
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,965
Probably can't,
but let me know if you can.

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,282
Great job out there, brah!

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,010
Thanks, Pigeon Toady.

47
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,969
Check out my girlfriend.

48
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,565
- She's in Canada.
- Yeah-huh.

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,721
She migrated.

50
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,450
- She's not made up.
- Okay.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,409
Look at her! Look at her!

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,642
- She exists, brah!
- That's great.

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,087
Hey, did you guys hear about Roger?

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,850
Ah!

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,923
Oh, my goodness. Are you okay?

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,331
What? Hey, brah. I say... What? Okay.

57
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,130
I tell you about my girlfriend?

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,608
Hey, boss wants to see you.

59
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,841
Uh...

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,729
Hunter wants to see me?

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,682
All right. Head in the game, Junior.

62
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,683
So, you're Hunter.
What do you do around here?

63
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,041
No, I hate that.

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,804
Hunter. Nice. To. Meet. You.

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,007
No, that's too robot.

66
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,162
Just say it normal. Just say it normal.
Here we go.

67
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,401
Nice to meet you!

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,244
What is wrong with me?

69
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,641
Junior.

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,247
Hunter.

71
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,928
You know why
I built my office entirely out of glass

72
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,645
even though birds can't see glass?

73
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,446
I do not.

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,921
Power move.

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,847
Eighteen years ago, I saved all storks
by getting out of babies

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,241
and into package delivery.

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,887
Now, this Monday at Storkcon, the board
will announce they're kicking me upstairs.

78
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,166
I'm going to be named Chairman.

79
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,011
Which means you are going to be named

80
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,408
boss.

81
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,807
Boss!

82
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,291
Cool, cool, cool. Very cool, very cool.

83
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,206
Now, look upon your domain
with your eyes wide open.

84
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,165
- Yeah.
- Wider.

85
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,367
I love it. Feels good.

86
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,887
How can you be boss
if you can't look at it?

87
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,247
If I go blind, it was worth it.

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,970
You know the hardest thing
about bein' boss?

89
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,201
Staring at the sun?

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,361
No, this is easy.

91
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,761
Whether to be like a friend boss
or a distant, weird boss?

92
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,843
Always be distant and weird.
What's the matter with you?

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,001
Sorry.

94
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,243
No, it's dealing with that.

95
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,726
The orphan Tulip?

96
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,041
I don't understand.

97
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,170
Do you know why
we stopped delivering babies?

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,408
Because there are so many
other ways of getting babies?

99
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,848
Yes. But that's not the whole story.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,004
Eighteen years ago,
when we still delivered human infants,

101
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,240
a stork named Jasper
went crazy and tried to keep a baby.

102
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,725
Tulip's beacon broke.

103
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,566
Her address was destroyed,
so we could no longer deliver her.

104
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,529
My baby!

105
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,083
It was then I realized that
there was no future in baby delivery.

106
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,325
Now, the orphan Tulip has just turned 18,
which means we can finally liberate her

107
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,289
and return her to the human world.

108
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,566
But she's no trouble.

109
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,324
Oh, she isn't, is she?

110
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,363
Here's our profit chart.

111
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,130
- I love a good profit chart.
- Me, too.

112
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,281
Yeah!

113
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,643
The peaks are when Tulip is on vacation,
asleep or out with the flu.

114
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,531
The valleys are when she tries to help.

115
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,889
Cool. I will liberate her.
Consider her liberated.

116
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,204
And if she doesn't want to be liberated?

117
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,805
Fire her. I'm talking about firing her.

118
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,007
Really?

119
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,246
The only thing you need to do to be named
boss on Monday is liberate the orphan Tulip.

120
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,811
If I'm not being clear, I mean fire her!

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,126
Yes, sir. I am on it.

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,442
I have read between the lines
and heard you overtly.

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,962
Ow, ow, ow...

124
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,681
Excuse me! Orphan Tulip?

125
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,801
Junior?

126
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,961
You're talkin' to me?

127
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,246
Yes, Orphan Tulip!

128
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,283
No, it's just that you never talk to me.

129
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,482
Well, yeah, that's changing
starting today, Orphan Tulip.

130
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,608
Oh, "Tulip" is just fine.
"Orphan" hurts my heart.

131
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,410
I have so many questions to ask you!

132
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,642
Why don't you come down
and we can talk all day?

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,564
Okay. I will be down.

134
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,960
As will my friends.

135
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,481
We are going to fly right down.

136
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,641
What? No, no.

137
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,086
That's a quail, an emu, there's a chicken.

138
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,241
They cannot fly.

139
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,687
Yeah. Until now.

140
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,001
She's helping us achieve our dreams.

141
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,764
- That's right, Dougland.
- You know it.

142
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,531
It is still a personal victory
if you use the bucket.

143
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,130
Okay, we'll all not use the bucket!

144
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,361
Wait, what?

145
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,602
Ha-ha! Tulip doesn't fit in.

146
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,001
We're all the same and she's a weirdo.

147
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,605
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not nice. She's...

148
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,285
She's had a hard life.

149
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,689
Okay.

150
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,128
This is gonna be great, guys!

151
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,051
Countdown.

152
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,160
Three, two, one!

153
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,287
Oh.

154
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,211
It's working! We're flying!

155
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,566
Ho-ho! Whoa!

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,206
Yeah, yeah!

157
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,806
Yeah!

158
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,803
Enough of this, I wanna go fast!

159
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,727
No! Dougland, wait!

160
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,041
No, no, no!

161
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,043
This is the greatest day of my life!

162
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,085
I'm flying!

163
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,967
This is my moment!

164
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,043
- Dougland! No!
- Get out of my way!

165
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,881
Bad Dougland! No!

166
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,202
How could my dreams go so horribly wrong?

167
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,406
I got ya!

168
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,607
Okay.

169
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,921
I'm fallin'.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,401
Oh, no! No! No, no, no, no, no!

171
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,241
- Uh...
- Oh, boy.

172
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,201
Oh. Oh, that's not so bad.

173
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,843
I got it. I got it. I got it! I got it!

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,081
I got it!

175
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,761
I'm sorry! Oh, I'm so, so sorry. Oh!

176
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,646
I don't fit in anywhere
and all I want to do is help!

177
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,450
Oh, boy.

178
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,604
Uh, Tulip, okay. I have news for you.

179
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,802
Before you finish,

180
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,644
for you to come to wish me
a happy birthday,

181
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,406
that's just the nicest, you know?
It's like a little rainbow.

182
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,726
So, thank you.

183
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,211
That's really nice.

184
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,010
But, oh, I'm sorry. I interrupted you.

185
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,288
- What were you gonna tell me?
- Uh...

186
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,641
Oh, boy.

187
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,167
I have wonderful news for you.

188
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,330
You have been liberated.

189
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,644
What does that mean?

190
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,009
Well, it means that you are fired.

191
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,804
- What?
- You're...

192
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,202
Are you okay?

193
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,442
Excuse me. You're...

194
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,204
You're fantastic!

195
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,001
Really?

196
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,686
Because I just blew up
most of the factory.

197
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,046
Oh, yeah.

198
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,726
What a twist! Um...

199
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,164
Well, it means...

200
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,450
Oh.

201
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,370
I'm putting you in charge
of your very own department.

202
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,081
You are the new head of Letter Sorting.

203
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,689
I didn't even know we still got letters.

204
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,604
We do!

205
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,207
- And now, you're in charge of them.
- Oh, yes! I will rock this!

206
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,521
You will rock this!

207
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,205
- Oh, yeah! Rock it hard!
- Gonna rock it hard!

208
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,010
And what's the number-one rule?

209
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,571
Always deliver!

210
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,370
- Wrong. Never leave this room.
- Oh.

211
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,727
I always thought it was
something more like "Strength"!

212
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,882
- "Determination"!
- Nope. That's way off.

213
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,008
Number-one rule, never leave this room.

214
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,764
Okay, well, if that...

215
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,208
Bored, bored, bored.

216
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,005
So, how was your commute?

217
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,684
Oh, I took the bucket.

218
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,649
Me, too. Real backed up.

219
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,251
Oh, yeah.

220
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,404
You hear about Steve and Gloria?

221
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,801
What?

222
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,724
I hear they're an item.

223
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,961
- No.
- Yeah.

224
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,531
Are you kidding me?

225
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,961
Are you guys talking about us?

226
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,884
You guys better not be talking about us.

227
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,610
I told you that in confidence.

228
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,364
You don't make her upset. She's my life!

229
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,766
Oh, no, I said it out loud.

230
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,160
You're not supposed to say anything!

231
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,771
Sorry, guys. Cat's out of the bag!

232
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,729
- No!
- Meow!

233
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,645
Are you gossiping?
No gossip allowed! Go to HR!

234
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,964
I've called you both in because
I hear you've been having problems.

235
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,288
- And it's important we have...
- She's the one who started it!

236
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,441
- How dare you!
- How dare you!

237
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,250
- How dare both of you! You're fired!
- You can't fire me!

238
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,050
- I just did!
- Wait! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean that!

239
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,770
- Guys! Group hug!
- Group hug!

240
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,121
Aw.

241
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,123
I'm hugging myself. Okay.

242
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,685
Somebody write me a letter!

243
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,206
Come in, Ninja Commander.

244
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,966
This is Cowboy Astronaut Agent Nate, over.

245
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,122
Ninja Team Commander, are you in position?

246
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,651
I'm about to launch the assault.

247
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,564
We can absolutely do that.

248
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,325
That's not gonna be a problem.

249
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,564
Ha-ha! Dr. LeFreeze!

250
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,922
You may have me outnumbered 7,000 to one,
but you weren't counting on one thing,

251
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,570
I'm not alone.

252
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,489
Ninja force, attack!

253
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,326
Ninja force?

254
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,404
Oh, ow! No! Oh!

255
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,648
This is the end.

256
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,010
Ninja force, tell my wife I loved her.

257
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,650
Gardner Real Estate. Henry...

258
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,325
- And Sarah...
- ... Gardner!

259
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,041
A house is not a home without a Gardner!

260
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,009
Ninja Commander, where were you?

261
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,969
- Uh, can you hold one second?
- Can you just...

262
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,930
You promised me that we were taking down
Dr. LeFreeze this afternoon.

263
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,127
You didn't show up,

264
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,442
and now he controls
most of Western Europe.

265
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,971
Ethnic tension is on the rise.

266
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,961
Yeah.

267
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,283
- We're totally done after this call, okay?
- Really?

268
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,403
- Five more minutes.
- And then we'll stop.

269
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,130
We promise.

270
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,448
We never stop. That's the Gardner promise.

271
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,601
Not even for five minutes.

272
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,761
Oh, look! There's one of our bench ads.

273
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,921
And you know what it says?

274
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,366
"We never stop."

275
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,086
We never stop. We never stop.

276
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,401
There's a stop sign. We're stopping.

277
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,641
We do stop for that.

278
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,847
I love you, brother.

279
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,407
It's like we're best friends
that live together!

280
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,561
And we yield.

281
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,643
And the yield
you're gonna get on this house, Kyle...

282
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,569
And that's what we were saying,
like you've gotta be up...

283
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,685
Mom, Dad,
I've decided I want a baby brother.

284
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,404
- Oh, honey, can you...
- Can you hold one second?

285
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,920
- Oh...
- Um...

286
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,601
I think we're fine as a family of three.

287
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,761
Why can't I have one?

288
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,922
Let's make this easy.
Where do you get one?

289
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,488
Why are you laughing and not answering me?

290
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,688
Where did you get me?

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,001
What is the joke?

292
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,201
Is there a different subject?

293
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,603
Okay, so there's a super weird
vibe in this car right now.

294
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,928
Oh, honey, this is very sweet.

295
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,724
But we have you.

296
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,411
And that's all we need.

297
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,607
That's right.

298
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,961
No, no, no, don't feel bad.

299
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,167
You can call us anytime.

300
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,924
Call us morning, noon or night.

301
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,286
Weekends, holidays.

302
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,130
No, we will pick up the phone
on Christmas.

303
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,327
Oh, well, I don't... Will we?

304
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,084
Yeah, you can call us on Christmas.

305
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,680
"Dear Stork Delivery Service,
"our adult names are Henry and Sarah.

306
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,731
"We are adult parents
of an absolutely perfect son named Nate.

307
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,166
"He really deserves a baby brother.

308
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,363
"As adults, it is our adult belief

309
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,364
"that it would be irresponsible
if this baby did not have ninja skills.

310
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,009
"Sincerely, adult parents
Henry and Sarah Gardner comma adults.

311
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,770
"Not Nate.

312
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,684
"P.S. He has to have ninja skills!"

313
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,881
Hi-ya!

314
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,886
Nailed it.

315
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,924
Happy birthday, dear Tulip!
Happy birthday to you!

316
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,970
Whoo!
Guys, thank you so much! Oh, my gosh.

317
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,004
Don't you think Junior put
you down here to get you out of the way?

318
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,123
Cheryl, that's not fair.
Why would you say that?

319
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,169
What? I can't help it.
I'm your outspoken friend.

320
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,720
I've never done this before,
but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

321
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,164
Aha! A letter!

322
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,371
"The H.I. Department."

323
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,090
Don't know that one.

324
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,527
He said the number-one rule is
"Don't leave."

325
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,770
But if I don't deliver the letter,
I won't be doing my job.

326
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,046
I'll cover for you!

327
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,361
Okay, thanks!

328
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,126
I have excellent news.

329
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,850
I have taken care of the Tulip problem.

330
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,527
Wonderful.

331
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,009
Monday, it'll all be yours.

332
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,889
Barring any monumental screw-up.

333
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,726
Do you know what we'll do
when you're boss?

334
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,370
No. Tell me!

335
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,760
We'll barbecue together.

336
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,291
We'll point at things together.

337
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,487
We'll team-build together.

338
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,324
We'll wear suits together.

339
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,604
You'll never be alone
because Cornerstore is your family.

340
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,526
- What?
- And I'll be like your dad.

341
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,131
And you're like my son.

342
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,805
My son-ployee.

343
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,006
And like any family...

344
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,571
No, no, no, no, no.

345
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,529
No, no, no, no, no, no.

346
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,682
How do you turn this thing off?

347
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,763
...and racquetball and fishing...

348
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,206
Why are there so many screens?

349
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,686
Turn off, turn off, turn off!

350
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,885
You're about to
get everything you ever wanted.

351
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,851
Great convo, Hunter!

352
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,441
I'm so stupid!

353
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,648
I should have just fired her!
Why didn't I just fire her?

354
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,644
Tulip!

355
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,801
Hey!

356
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,047
Hey, what are you doing out of the room?

357
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,201
I told you not to leave the room!

358
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,691
Nah, it's cool. I'm covering for myself.

359
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,881
What?

360
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,371
Okay, we need to get outta here.

361
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,126
Come on. We have to go now.

362
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,727
Junior, you asked me to do a thing,
and I will not fail you!

363
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,530
Always deliver!

364
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,921
Wait! No!

365
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,685
This is the Baby Factory!

366
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,650
This is the Baby Factory?

367
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,723
No, no, no!

368
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,361
See ya!

369
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,646
Why did you do that?

370
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,404
Touchdown Tulip!

371
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,800
Stop celebrating!

372
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,241
I think it was supposed to go over there.

373
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,730
Oh...

374
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,090
You're right. That was wrong.

375
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,767
Oh, come on!

376
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,809
Why didn't we destroy
this place years ago?

377
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,007
Oh, my gosh!

378
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,286
I can't believe what I'm seeing!

379
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,686
Do you see all this?

380
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,649
Junior! This is amazing!

381
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,801
Why put the button there? Uh...

382
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,601
Come on!

383
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,084
Hi-ya!

384
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,961
Is it off?

385
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,406
Uh, I believe so.

386
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,647
Are you okay?

387
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,280
Your wing looks a little mangled.

388
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,006
My wing is fine. It's A-O-great.

389
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,650
Yeah, that seems bad.

390
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,040
Let's go.

391
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,084
This place is dangerous.

392
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,682
Huh. What is that?

393
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,605
Cool beans.

394
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,560
- What?
- What?

395
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,846
- What's happening?
- Mom, Dad.

396
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
The storks are bringing me a baby brother!

397
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,768
That sounds like a nice dream, buddy.

398
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,002
Let's go back to sleep, honey.

399
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,686
This is the best day of my life!

400
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,604
This is the worst day of my life!

401
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,250
Hunter's gonna kill me!

402
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,323
- Why don't we just tell someone?
- Are you insane?

403
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,363
If anyone finds out about this,
I am dead meat.

404
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,210
My hopes of becoming boss destroyed.

405
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,840
No, no, no.

406
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,203
Come on!

407
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,080
What up?

408
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,964
- Hey, Pigeon Toady.
- Hey, there.

409
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,531
Hey, cool metal thing, brah.

410
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,444
New kind of package? What's in it?

411
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,284
- Candy canes.
- Some gas. Uh...

412
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,801
Cool, brah. You catch the game last night?

413
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,724
- Oh, yeah. Real great game.
- Excellent playing.

414
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,484
Yeah, too bad about the last quarter.

415
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,728
- Yeah, that was too bad.
- Real bummer.

416
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,360
And yet then with a little
time left, we pulled it out...

417
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,561
- Totally!
- Yeah.

418
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,609
...only to lose it again
in the last second.

419
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,569
- Such a disappointment.
- It was a comedown.

420
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,449
- Only to get it back.
- Best day of my life!

421
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,011
- Only to lose it!
- Worst day of my life!

422
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,286
Only to get it back.

423
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,487
A roller-coaster of a game!

424
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,642
Only to lose it again.

425
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,245
What a game! Here we go, see you later.

426
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,401
Bye!

427
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,688
Cool. No big deal.

428
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,729
Wait... Wait a second.

429
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,724
There was no game last night.

430
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,245
What the...

431
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,244
Come on. Let's get to my workshop.

432
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,970
We'll be safe there.

433
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,804
All right, okay, all right, all right.

434
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,644
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

435
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,406
We just need to keep a low-pro here. Okay?

436
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,364
If one person sees a stork with a baby,

437
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,767
my chances of being named boss
are ruined. So...

438
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,921
What are you doing?

439
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,320
- I wanna see the baby!
- No, no, no.

440
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,481
We do not open that thing.

441
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,961
Just a brief exposure
to baby cuteness can ruin your life.

442
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,121
Remember Jasper?

443
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,248
Hmm. I'm trying to put my finger on it.
I can't think of who...

444
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,482
You're being sarcastic because
he changed the course of your life.

445
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,641
- That's right.
- Yeah.

446
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,451
Huh. How about this?

447
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,050
Huh. All right, Storkcon is on Monday.
Today is Friday.

448
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,966
If I can just deliver this thing by then,
I can still be named boss.

449
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,646
Gardner family, here I come!

450
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,924
But your wing's broken. You can't...

451
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,287
Make a plan! Stick to the plan!

452
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,930
Always deliver!

453
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,727
I'll never fly again!

454
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,561
What's that?

455
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,721
Hmm? What's what?

456
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,370
That. Right there.

457
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,290
Uh... Oh, that? No.

458
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,487
That's nothing.

459
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,641
Looks like an airplane.

460
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,802
Well, it kind of is an airplane, I guess.

461
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,240
Great! I'll use it.

462
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,087
Oh, well, it kind of took me a long
time to make, like years and years...

463
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,924
Great. All leading to this moment.

464
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,366
I'm saving it for something else.

465
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,521
- For what?
- Hmm?

466
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,721
What were you gonna use it for?

467
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,645
Uh, it's my dream to deliver packages
for Cornerstore. com.

468
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,169
Oh, well, hey there, kid.

469
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,449
Now's your chance.

470
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,802
- Uh, I don't know.
- Yeah.

471
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,002
I don't even know if it flies.

472
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,327
Eh, uh...

473
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,167
You know what?

474
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,561
Yeah, you can use it.
Let's deliver this baby.

475
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,846
Are you sure though?

476
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,402
- Uh...
- All right, let's do it!

477
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,409
Okay, great.
Let me show you how to fly this.

478
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,164
Um, hello? I'm a bird.

479
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,890
I'm pretty sure I know how to...

480
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,846
I was wrong! I was immediately wrong!

481
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,326
Of course, the autopilot button.
That makes perfect sense.

482
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,806
I knew that. I was testing you.

483
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,564
Oh, you were testing me
on a thing that I made.

484
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,290
- That's correct.
- Is your seat wet?

485
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,481
Yep. That's my urine.

486
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,449
I peed in the seat when we were falling.

487
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,564
Whoo. What else do you want to talk about?

488
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,324
My baby.

489
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,364
Now, I really think you're
gonna love this one, Becky.

490
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,726
I think we found you a good one.

491
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,082
Yeah, when we saw this, we looked
at each other and we were like, "Wow."

492
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,571
"This is theirs." Yeah.

493
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,085
- And it's a fixer-upper...
- Yeah. It is.

494
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,571
...which I know we weren't looking for.

495
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,769
But at least it's not a fixer-downer.

496
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,921
Oh, honey, can you just...

497
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,127
- Can you hold one second?
- Yeah, can you?

498
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,249
- You're up. You're up.
- What? No, it's not my turn.

499
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,721
- You're up, now. You're up.
- It can't be.

500
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,769
So you want a panic room, okay.

501
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,047
Uh...

502
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,366
Nate?

503
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,921
What?

504
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,320
Nate?

505
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,004
Hey there, buddy.

506
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,207
Whatcha doin' here?

507
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,447
I'm preparing.

508
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,011
Right, you're preparing.

509
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,605
For what?

510
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,762
To get my baby brother from the storks.

511
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,126
Right.

512
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,565
Hey, I love your school encourages
imagination over actual learning,

513
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,724
- but the storks don't deliver anymore.
- I know.

514
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,086
They haven't done that in, like, forever.

515
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,605
Dad, you don't have to help me at all.

516
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,610
This is a guilt-free pass for you
to go back inside and work.

517
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,801
Just go.

518
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,361
- Go. Shoo, shoo, Dad. Go.
- What?

519
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,007
Okay, all right. Fine.

520
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,571
You blink and I'll be in college.

521
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,881
What was that?

522
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,691
Hmm? No, I'm just walking, working.

523
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,968
- I didn't say anything. You should just...
- Okay.

524
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,963
Remember when I was a baby?
It felt like one minute ago?

525
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,361
- What?
- What? Hmm?

526
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,041
Fine.

527
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,969
Dad, you'll be my idol
for, like, two more years.

528
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,451
Okay, I heard that one.

529
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,329
Okay. All right, look.

530
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,689
Five minutes. That's all the time I have
is five minutes, and then we stop.

531
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,841
Yeah, five minutes.

532
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,041
Five minutes, and then...

533
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,201
We stop.

534
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,603
Five minutes and then we stop.

535
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,970
What?

536
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,926
Powder?

537
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,645
Baby powder.

538
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,128
Homing pigeon powers activate!

539
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,483
Ah!

540
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,289
Baby, what are we gonna call you, baby?

541
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,003
This is crazy. We are delivering a baby!

542
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,804
No, we are delivering a package.

543
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,327
Maybe we should name it
instead of calling it "the package."

544
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,084
We do not name the package, okay?

545
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,241
It's very simple.

546
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,448
We make a plan. Stick to the plan.

547
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,204
Always deliver.

548
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,443
And then we get back to Storkcon
so the board can name me boss.

549
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,681
Oh, it's so exciting.

550
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,848
What can we expect from boss Junior?

551
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,206
Oh, you know that's top secret.

552
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,124
- You can tell me. Come on.
- It's gonna be big!

553
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,203
Like what? Like, what, how big?
Like, what are you gonna do?

554
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,362
I prefer not to talk about it right now.

555
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,641
- Do you not know?
- What?

556
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,847
- Oh, my gosh. You don't know.
- I know.

557
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,604
If you don't know,
then why do you wanna be boss?

558
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,807
- I know.
- You don't.

559
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,531
Oh, man,
you laugh when you're uncomfortable.

560
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,681
No.

561
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,285
- Am I pushing your buttons?
- Uh, no.

562
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,771
- Yes, I am.
- Nah. No.

563
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,247
- Beep, beep, boop, boop...
- No, those aren't even where my buttons

564
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,771
would be if I had buttons.

565
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,126
- Beep, beep, boop, boop...
- So, nice try.

566
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,647
I am programming you to tell me
why you want to be boss.

567
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,928
I love robots, so this is fun.

568
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,246
We're having a good time together.

569
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,890
Why do you wanna be boss?
Why do you wanna be boss?

570
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,491
Back off!

571
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,721
Oh, God! No!

572
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,251
No, no, no!

573
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,851
Wow! Well, that was funny.

574
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,286
You almost died.

575
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,048
I guess the lesson we learned today is
don't ask me why I want to be boss, right?

576
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,761
Okay, good talk.

577
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,491
Good talk.

578
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,525
That didn't sound happy.

579
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,445
Yeah, well, the package
will be delivered soon enough.

580
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,647
Uh...

581
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,768
I really think that
we should check that out, you know.

582
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,961
Ah, just relax.

583
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,810
Okay. Yeah, you're right.

584
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,327
Ah, you see, the package has
cried itself gently to sleep.

585
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,804
I can't take it!

586
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,962
Can't help body movements! Must open pod!

587
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,246
Wait! No!

588
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,811
The pod! Gotta open the pod!

589
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,883
Oh, no! No, no, no! Come back! Come back!

590
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,610
- Be there in a jiff!
- Pull yourself together!

591
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,205
- Fly this plane!
- Gotta open the pod!

592
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,050
We're gonna die!

593
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,646
Well, at least the baby's quiet.

594
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,001
Are you out of your mind?

595
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,924
A baby cries and you crash a plane?

596
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,003
Hey, hey, hey! I was busy with the pod!

597
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,004
Why didn't you turn on the autopilot?

598
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,605
I was panicking! Listen to me, Tulip.

599
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,922
- You crashed a plane, did you hear me?
- The baby is quiet.

600
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,809
- You crashed a plane!
- The baby is quiet!

601
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,121
- The baby is quiet?
- The baby is quiet!

602
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,930
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Oh, no!

603
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,241
Why is it quiet?

604
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,046
Open the pod! Open the pod!
Open the pod! Open the pod!

605
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,328
How do you open this thing?
How do you open it? Come on!

606
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,244
Aw.

607
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,650
Oh, my gosh.
You know what I just realized?

608
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,450
This baby and I have the same birthday.

609
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,250
Oh, yeah. I don't care.

610
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,283
You crashed the plane.
I don't need you anymore.

611
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,966
I'm going to deliver
the package myself. Goodbye.

612
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,567
What? You're breaking up the team?

613
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,207
"Team"? What is wrong with you?

614
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,283
You and I are not a team. We are nothing.

615
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,010
There is no "we."

616
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,366
This is all your fault. This.

617
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,887
This. This!

618
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,209
All of this.

619
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,970
A good day to you, Orphan Tulip.

620
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,406
A good day.

621
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,170
Well, just so you know, I'll be fine.

622
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,885
I'm the most popular person
in the entire Letter Sorting department.

623
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,690
- I can't hear you!
- I said that...

624
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,410
Yeah, it just sounds
like "Blah, blah, blah,"

625
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,800
but mixed with crying.

626
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,525
But that's not what I'm...
Junior, come here.

627
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,682
I can't hear what you're saying,
but I assume it's lame.

628
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,570
I said I'm the most popular person...

629
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,404
Lame!

630
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,245
Tulip's dumb.

631
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,368
There's a reason she doesn't fit in.

632
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,251
If you're smart enough to build a plane,
then who wrecks one?

633
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,051
I'm gonna deliver this package
and be back at Stork Mountain in no time.

634
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,404
Oh, great. Now I'm surrounded by wolves!

635
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,131
What are you gonna do,
knock me unconscious?

636
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,361
Perfect!

637
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,246
Oh, seriously?

638
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,448
I'm not talking to you. I'm mad at you!

639
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,329
Oh, no. Really? What am I gonna do?

640
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,811
We are done! This conversation is over.

641
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,961
Last word, me!

642
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,121
- Last word.
- Me.

643
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,850
- Last word. Last word.
- Me. Me. Me.

644
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,487
Listen, I'm the alpha.

645
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,641
I'm gonna eat this thing first.

646
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,165
I'm gonna be the new alpha.

647
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,971
No. There is no...
There's no need for a new alpha.

648
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,161
I'm the alpha!

649
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,651
- You...
- You're not even a beta.

650
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,801
I'm the alpha!

651
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,729
No, you're not the alpha!

652
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,122
Aw!

653
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,606
What just happened?

654
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,009
- What was that?
- What did that thing just do?

655
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,248
- I'm sorry. Where were we?
- Oh, yeah.

656
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,125
I'm gonna devour this thing.

657
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,601
I'm gonna bite her arm clean off.

658
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,001
You didn't bite her arm clean off.

659
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,650
This tastes like flowers.

660
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,245
Okay, stand aside.

661
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,370
Look at you. Look what you did.

662
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,443
I did the same thing you did.

663
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,526
- Are you in love?
- I am in love.

664
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,886
- Are you in love?
- I'm in love, too.

665
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,166
I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree.

666
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,731
Hey, guys!

667
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,127
This tiny thing is now a wolf, everybody.

668
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,884
- What did he say?
- What? What's happening?

669
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,166
- Louder. We're in the back!
- We're keeping it!

670
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,448
- Back of the pack, we're keeping it!
- Okay, thank you.

671
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,921
Aw, look at that.

672
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,081
The delivery is now complete.

673
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,287
Now, I just need to find
a way out of here.

674
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,681
Wait, you're not gonna deliver
her to her actual parents?

675
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,241
Baby doesn't know the difference
because babies are dumb.

676
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,566
Oh, babies are not dumb.

677
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,721
They are super dumb.

678
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,565
Babies have a higher level of intelligence
than we will ever understand.

679
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,165
You sound like a baby
that learned how to talk.

680
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,691
I am a baby that learned how to talk!

681
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,002
Hey, I want to teach it
to walk around in circles

682
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,611
- before it lays down.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

683
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,761
That's my favorite thing to teach.

684
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,081
Don't get too close,
you're gonna scare it!

685
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,241
I'm not... Ow!

686
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,847
Aw!

687
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,880
- Huh. The baby, it's laughing!
- Yeah. Good for it.

688
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,087
No.

689
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,527
Okay, I apologize for what
I'm about to do.

690
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,680
- Ow!
- Sorry.

691
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,921
Aw!

692
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,246
- Stop it!
- Sorry.

693
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,368
Sorry.

694
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,124
- That's my face!
- Sorry!

695
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,810
- Why did you stop?
- Come on!

696
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,008
Okay, I get the plan.
I can fake it. I can fake it!

697
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,650
Okay, okay. Fake it!

698
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,081
Ow!

699
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,000
Wait! Hold on a second, okay? Wait.

700
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,770
All right, I have an idea.

701
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,083
Imagine how much harder
she could hit me if you cut us down.

702
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,527
Oh, yeah! I could really wail on this guy.

703
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,121
I mean, you don't have to
go that hard, but...

704
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,123
- Oh, I think I do.
- Well...

705
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,770
Oh, I'm still mad at you.

706
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,961
Cut 'em down!

707
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,441
Grab a stick or something!

708
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,806
Wait, what?

709
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,245
Aw!

710
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,482
Do you want more?

711
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,086
Yeah!

712
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,971
Will this tiny twig be enough?

713
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,849
- Yes!
- No! No!

714
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,001
Bigger!

715
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,525
Get the biggest twig you can find!

716
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,166
Sorry, Junior.
Gotta give the people what they want.

717
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,930
Grab the baby! Let's go!

718
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,529
Wolfpack, chase!

719
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,571
Chase, chase, chase.

720
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,801
Why wouldn't you stop hitting me?

721
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,081
I was distracting them.

722
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,366
Okay, here we go.

723
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,321
Oh! Oh! We should untie the bridge!

724
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,005
Yeah, I know. What do you think I'm doing?

725
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,484
Chase, chase, chase.

726
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,525
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

727
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,605
Suck it, wolves!

728
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,326
Wolf pack! Form of wolf bridge!

729
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,690
Hut, hut, hut.

730
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,726
What is happening?

731
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,848
The wolves are forming
a suspension bridge.

732
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,445
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

733
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,886
All right, let's go!

734
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,770
A bridge!

735
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,885
We're probably gonna die!

736
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,201
Chase, chase, chase!

737
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,881
Let's go!

738
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,041
- The door!
- Leave it!

739
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,009
Almost gotcha, almost gotcha,
almost gotcha!

740
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,249
Oh, my gosh!
We can use that thing as a thing!

741
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,885
Right! To thing to the thing!

742
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,610
Let's go!

743
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,049
- You sound like a monkey.
- You sound like a monkey!

744
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,921
Wolf pack, form of wolf boat!

745
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,487
Boat!

746
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,880
Are you kidding me?

747
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,371
That is so unpredictable!

748
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,521
Ha-ha!

749
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,211
Wolf pack! Form of submarine!

750
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,600
Submarine!

751
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,369
I didn't know wolves could
form a submarine!

752
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,409
I've never seen that before
on nature shows.

753
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,244
Okay, quick, get to the plane!

754
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,526
What? I thought it was broken.

755
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,921
No, I fixed it with some spare parts.

756
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,487
We're gonna get ya. We're gonna get ya.

757
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,201
All right, let's go!

758
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,407
Junior!

759
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,204
Obviously, I'm not gonna push it.

760
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,691
Wait!

761
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,009
Oh, I could push it so easily.

762
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,686
It would take
such a little amount of force.

763
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,286
Don't look at me like that.

764
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,405
If you don't give us Tiny Thing,
we're gonna eat you.

765
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,971
We're gonna eat you anyway!

766
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,326
You don't say it.

767
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,562
You make the deal
and then you eat them anyway.

768
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,721
Gotcha!

769
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,006
We're not going to eat you!

770
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,486
Well, now it's too late!

771
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,483
Oh, no! No!

772
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,290
- Junior!
- Let's go!

773
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,161
All right, let's fly!

774
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,321
It doesn't fly.

775
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,130
- What?
- It falls!

776
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,329
Why did I save you?

777
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,171
Whee!

778
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,570
Wolf pack! Form of wolf plane!

779
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,123
- Come on! Come on!
- Let's go!

780
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,482
Tiny Thing, come back!

781
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,530
Oh, come back, Tiny Thing. We need you!

782
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,764
My baby.

783
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,768
Hmm.

784
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,721
What?

785
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,486
Five more minutes and then we stop

786
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,641
What?

787
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,007
- Five more minutes...
- No!

788
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,881
That's our chimney!

789
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,451
You're gonna destroy the whole roof?

790
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,728
Mom, we have to replace
the chimney with a slide

791
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,882
for when the storks deliver
my baby brother.

792
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,041
What he said.

793
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,561
No! Don't be crazy.
You cannot do the chimney.

794
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,404
Come on, don't make me the mean mom.

795
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,562
- Dads are fun, moms are mean.
- I heard that!

796
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,404
- Parent conference.
- Pinching!

797
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,722
Henry, people are gonna think we're crazy.

798
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,001
We need to tell him.

799
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,161
Tell him what?

800
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,685
What, to go watch more TV?

801
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,565
This is the best time I've had
with Nate in my life.

802
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,091
I actually feel like a dad again.

803
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,368
And when no baby brother shows up?

804
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,602
Well, then we tell him.

805
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,761
We can get a new chimney,

806
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,922
but we'll never be able to
replace this time with Nate.

807
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,809
And if we put those headsets back on,

808
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,247
how old will Nate be
when we take them off again?

809
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,680
I'm not a jerky teen yet.

810
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,207
Fleeting moments, precious memories.

811
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,290
Moms are fun, too.

812
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,606
Wow! That's...
That's not a well-made chimney.

813
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,444
I'm... I'm a small woman
and that just came...

814
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,045
Yeah, that came right down!

815
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,482
Okay, so, uh, what's next?

816
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,125
Okay, it's Saturday night.

817
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,602
As long as we deliver by tomorrow,
we can still make it for Storkcon Monday.

818
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,922
Thanks for waiting for me back there.

819
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,011
I don't know what you're talking about.

820
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,845
Oh, okay, "I'm too manly to
admit anything at all about anything."

821
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,001
Is that supposed to be me?

822
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,568
Oh, sorry, "This is a more
accurate representation."

823
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,326
Oh, you're so right.
That is what I sound like.

824
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,289
Let's both talk like this.

825
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,044
Baby's fussing.

826
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,168
She's bored. We have to distract her.

827
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,481
Oh, let's see. Oh!

828
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,041
You are a baby, you are a baby

829
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,201
Little hands, little feet

830
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,964
- Look at you, you're so sweet
- JUNIOR: Stop! Stop! Stop!

831
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,167
You're so cute I wanna...

832
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,446
Let's just step aside, all right?

833
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,290
- And let me do it.
- You want to sing to her?

834
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,680
Yeah. Is that so surprising?

835
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,365
I'm a pretty good singer, actually.

836
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,925
Okay, fine! Sing to her.

837
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,404
When you need a little something

838
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,721
And there's too much to do

839
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,451
Just click your little finger
And we'll ship it for you

840
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,843
Cornerstore, Cornerstore. com

841
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,845
Free shipping does not apply
in Alaska and Hawaii.

842
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,684
Wait, wait, wait, is that a song?

843
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,126
That's not a song, that's an ad.

844
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,408
- Well, strap in for this one then, Tulip.
- Okay.

845
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,165
Cornerstore

846
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,367
I like how this is going.

847
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,046
Let your packages rain down on me

848
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,769
Uh, this looks like a good place
to rest for the night.

849
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,251
Junior, what are talking about?
Why are you acting...

850
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,401
I can't hear what you're saying.

851
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,602
- Junior?
- I can't hear you!

852
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,641
Junior!

853
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,204
Hmm...

854
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,564
Hey! Have you seen
a red-headed lady and a stork?

855
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,767
A bird and a lady?

856
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,371
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

857
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,729
I saw two that fit that
description the other day!

858
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,924
No, man, I will not be your friend.

859
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,368
Sorry, thought we were vibing.

860
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,209
Why you being so creepy?

861
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,767
You know what? Just get... Here. Here.

862
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,089
I'm just gonna put this right here.

863
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,801
Uh...

864
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,810
What happened back there?

865
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,325
What? What do you mean?

866
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,847
Uh, you stabbed the raft?
For literally no reason!

867
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,321
It was not for no reason.
It was for personal reasons.

868
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,682
Anyways, there's a port
right there on the coast.

869
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,805
We'll just leave first thing in the
morning and deliver the package.

870
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,766
Just call it "the baby."

871
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,490
Why are you so afraid of babies?

872
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,241
Because this one single package could ruin
everything I've worked towards my entire life!

873
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,402
- Why do you wanna be boss again?
- Not this again.

874
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,642
No, really.
Why do you wanna be boss of Cornerstore?

875
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,485
I don't know, okay? I mean...

876
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,085
Why does anyone want to be boss?

877
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,241
It rules. That's why.

878
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,323
Yeah, but what would you do?

879
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,331
- I don't know. What would you do?
- I'm glad you asked!

880
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,450
Well, for one, I would employ a more
diverse variety of birds and animals.

881
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,642
Two, I would get rid of
the Cornerstore warehouse

882
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,325
because that building is a bummer.

883
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,563
And three, I would start
delivering babies again.

884
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,289
Okay, you were very prepared
for that question.

885
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,481
Man, I feel so close to you.

886
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,641
Like we're girlfriends already.

887
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,525
All right, I knew as I was saying it
that I should just keep my mouth shut.

888
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,490
Aw, I want to braid
your feathers immediately!

889
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,649
Look, uh...

890
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,081
Yeah?

891
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,527
While we're being real honest right now,
I'll tell you why I built my plane.

892
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,604
It's not to deliver packages
for Cornerstore. com.

893
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,846
I built my plane to find my parents.

894
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,563
But I thought you didn't know
where your parents lived.

895
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,529
When Jasper destroyed my
homing beacon, I lost all the pieces.

896
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,045
Except one.

897
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,402
And I thought this, plus some luck
might be enough to find my parents.

898
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,882
So, you sacrificed your plane
for this baby?

899
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,724
- Yeah.
- Why?

900
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,885
Oh, I don't know.
I guess if this baby finds her family,

901
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,809
I mean, it's worth it.

902
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,526
Right?

903
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,082
Fine. You can name her.

904
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,771
- Really?
- Yeah, go ahead.

905
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,046
Diamond Destiny.

906
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,406
Okay, I changed my mind.
You can't name her.

907
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,005
Too late! Her name is Diamond Destiny.
Yes, it is!

908
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,650
I thought it was gonna be,
like, an actual name.

909
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,325
It is a name. Diamond Destiny is her name!

910
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,403
Isn't that right, Diamond Destiny?

911
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,242
We're gonna find your parents,
and everything is gonna be just perfect.

912
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,165
You'll find your family.

913
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,646
You think?

914
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,040
For sure.

915
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,571
Good night.

916
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,760
Good night!

917
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,923
Huh!

918
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,566
What is it? I'm up.

919
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,610
Do you think she's hungry?

920
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,046
Yeah. I don't know.

921
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,248
Uh, maybe she just needs to be rocked.

922
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,921
Okay.

923
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,401
Oh, my gosh.

924
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,011
Her eyes could not be more open.

925
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,685
Okay, grab that end.

926
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,245
It's like we're a family.

927
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,521
We are not like a family.

928
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,843
We're just a guy and a girl
trying to put our baby to sleep.

929
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,570
Let's just put her to sleep.

930
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,330
Come on, close, close, close.

931
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,323
Okay, close. Close, close, close.

932
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,323
That's good, right? Is that closed enough?

933
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,005
No! Look, I can still see eyeball.

934
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,608
Can we manually close them? Here.

935
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,649
No! Don't do that! What are you doing?

936
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,643
I'm gonna... Wait!
Okay, give me the eye glue.

937
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,484
- What?
- You know, for gluing eyes shut.

938
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,210
No, we don't have any.

939
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,527
It's gonna stick.

940
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,162
What if she never goes to sleep?

941
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,481
All right, you know what? I got her.

942
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,250
You just go to bed.
You go to bed. It's fine.

943
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,165
No, I don't wanna go to bed
if you're gonna be up. I'll feel bad.

944
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,845
I know. But if I go to bed, then
I'm gonna feel guilty. And I just can't.

945
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,161
No, that's what I'm saying. Listen to me.

946
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,761
No, so that's why you go to bed,
and I'll take care of her.

947
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,244
All right. I'll go to bed.

948
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,126
I can't believe you went to bed!

949
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,004
What? You just said it was
okay for me to go bed!

950
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,161
Okay, you know what?

951
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,850
Can we just rock her in our arms?

952
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,843
No. We do not. No loving the baby.

953
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,206
You said "baby."

954
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,771
Fine. I don't care. I don't care.

955
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,367
You love it.

956
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,489
Goodbye, brah!

957
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,491
How you like me now? Huh!

958
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,202
"How you like me now"?

959
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,202
How you like me now?

960
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,807
How do you like me now!

961
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,088
Now there was a time

962
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,123
When you loved me so

963
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,081
I could do no wrong

964
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,722
And now you need to know

965
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,927
Dance break!

966
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,605
How you like me now? How you like me now?

967
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,127
And you're sure you saw this?

968
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,760
Yes, I'm sure I saw this.

969
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,849
All right. Let's keep this quiet.

970
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,286
Yes, sir.

971
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,329
Thank you for your loyalty, Pigeon Toady.

972
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,927
Or should I say boss.

973
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,165
Cool, cool, cool.

974
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,969
Whoa! Steam room in an elevator.
Mind blown!

975
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,121
Shut up! I'm planning.

976
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,321
Oh, that's cool.

977
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,606
All right. Now, listen.

978
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,285
First, we have to stop that delivery.

979
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,881
But we don't know where they're headed.

980
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,481
Indeed. We won't go to them.

981
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,766
We'll make them...

982
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,041
Come to us.

983
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,884
Yes!

984
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,924
Well, I'm off.

985
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,923
You're in a suit suddenly.

986
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,206
Let's go.

987
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,089
My towel blew away.

988
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,646
Junior.

989
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,006
Wake up. We gotta go.

990
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,207
I'm still asleep.

991
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,486
I know, we gotta go, we gotta go.

992
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,005
Just let me sleep a little longer.

993
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,561
Junior. Baby's awake.
Ship's leaving. Let's go!

994
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,848
You do it. You get the baby.

995
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,650
Junior, I'm tired, too!

996
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,007
You made it, you get it.

997
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,281
Hey!

998
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,085
Ooh!

999
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,320
Yes!

1000
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,770
Diamond Destiny,
you come back here right now.

1001
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,961
I'm not fooling around.

1002
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,451
All right, let's go.
We got a boat to catch.

1003
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,125
We got a boat to catch, oh!

1004
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,281
Here we go. On it.

1005
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,566
Home stretch!

1006
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,163
We have to be absolutely silent.

1007
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,011
One human sees a stork with
a baby and we'll get reported.

1008
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,367
All right, last one. Let's pack it up.

1009
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,561
What was that?

1010
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:06,801
Sounds like a baby.

1011
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,651
That's very suspicious.

1012
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,009
- Why is she doing that?
- I don't know.

1013
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,650
Diaper?

1014
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,001
Check.

1015
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,161
Food?

1016
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,801
Check.

1017
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,961
Maybe she needs a nap.

1018
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,485
Rock-a-bye baby, on the treetop

1019
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,603
Nope. What is it? What does she want?

1020
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,761
It's coming from over there!

1021
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,166
I don't know. She's reaching for you.

1022
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,321
Maybe she just wants you.

1023
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,931
No. That doesn't make sense.

1024
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,890
Technically, she should be
perfectly happy.

1025
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,644
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

1026
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,291
I have no idea.

1027
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,521
Oh, no!

1028
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,921
Oh, no.

1029
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,849
She's gonna blow! She's gonna blow!

1030
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,041
What do I do with her?

1031
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,281
Take her, take her. Just take her!

1032
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,884
- Ah, look at that.
- Hmm.

1033
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,690
Actually seems to be working pretty well.

1034
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,207
Ha! She smells so nice!

1035
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,563
Who's got the little sparkly eyes? You do.

1036
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,246
You do.

1037
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,448
Oh, no! The boat's leaving!

1038
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,203
No, no, no! Come on!

1039
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,931
Wolf pack. Form of wolf minivan!

1040
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,160
Minivan!

1041
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,164
Ow, ow, ow...

1042
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,241
Give me a break!

1043
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,401
- Click, click.
- Click.

1044
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,161
My baby!

1045
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,560
Ah! We got the Tiny Thing!

1046
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,484
This is not a safe way
to transport the baby.

1047
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,927
- We're parents now.
- Just go slower.

1048
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,323
- You're right, you're right, you're right.
- Slower.

1049
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,887
Okay, good.

1050
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,130
Is that good, Tiny Thing?

1051
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,011
Hmm? Tiny Thing?

1052
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,810
We lost her again!

1053
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,326
Quick! We can get to
the boat through here.

1054
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,686
Ah!

1055
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,211
Wait. Why are you running so weird?

1056
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,203
What don't I know?

1057
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,604
My old nemesis.

1058
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,610
"Glass."

1059
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,484
Birds can't see glass!

1060
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,441
Give us Tiny Thing.

1061
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,728
Just go, Tulip. It's too late for me.

1062
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,769
You've got the baby.
You can deliver her yourself.

1063
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,968
What? No, I'm not leaving you behind!

1064
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,963
We can do this. Together!

1065
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,009
Where's the Tiny Thing?

1066
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,487
- All right. Tulip, you got this!
- Tiny Thing! Tiny Thing!

1067
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,688
- Okay, left. Right. Straight.
- Where's the Tiny Thing?

1068
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,888
Straight! Left! Right!

1069
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,083
Oh, no! I'm panicking!

1070
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,447
Uh, right again! Left, I mean. Left!

1071
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,931
Right! Right, I mean.

1072
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,964
Left! Left! Right! Right!

1073
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,645
Left! Left! Left! Right!

1074
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,166
Rolft! I mean, ralft!

1075
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,411
Right! Left! I'm just shouting words!

1076
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,244
This is not working!

1077
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,123
Oh-oh! We did that together!

1078
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,725
I ran into every piece of glass.

1079
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,166
Some, more than once.

1080
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,441
Oh, jeez.

1081
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,211
Ah!

1082
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,521
What are the chances of that?

1083
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,205
I guess, pretty high in a glass factory.

1084
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,408
- Tiny Thing! Tiny Thing!
- Come on!

1085
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,409
First, we're gonna take Tiny Thing

1086
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,040
and raise her to be a strong,
independent woman.

1087
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,771
And then, we're gonna eat you.

1088
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,931
We made a great team.

1089
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,890
My baby.

1090
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,322
That's my baby!

1091
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,010
It's Jasper!

1092
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,207
My baby!

1093
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,209
- No, no, no!
- My baby! My baby! My baby!

1094
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,407
Let go!

1095
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,244
Let go of us!

1096
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,403
Wolf pack, form of...

1097
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,045
Broken heart!

1098
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,481
Cry! Cry!

1099
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,841
Get away from us!

1100
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,047
- Get away!
- Stay back!

1101
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,241
- Go home!
- Come on!

1102
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,401
Don't make me hit you!

1103
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,370
- Hey, hey, hey! Let me explain!
- I don't wanna hear it!

1104
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,851
When you orphaned me, you said "whoops!"

1105
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,644
Whoops! You said "whoops!" Who does that?

1106
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,404
Will you please let me explain?

1107
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,722
Hey! She doesn't wanna hear
your explanation, guy!

1108
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,967
Back off!

1109
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,122
I fell in love with you.

1110
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,481
Okay, fine.

1111
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,409
Honestly, I am very curious.
Let's hear it.

1112
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,687
Look, they tell you being
a stork isn't gonna be easy.

1113
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,966
Always deliver.

1114
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,090
I failed to do that.

1115
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,164
Your beacon broke. The pieces scattered.

1116
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,885
I spent my entire life

1117
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,682
searching for the missing pieces
so that I could deliver my baby.

1118
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,527
And yet, after all these years,
I'm still missing one piece.

1119
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,569
- But, I have pledged...
- Oh, my gosh! Wait.

1120
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,484
...to be the parent
I took from you, Tulip.

1121
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,369
And I will lay down my life.

1122
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,204
I have the missing piece!

1123
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,885
Excuse me, what?

1124
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,122
I have the missing piece.

1125
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,450
My home!

1126
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,280
I'm going home!

1127
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,488
I'm gonna finally meet my real family.

1128
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,131
Oh, my gosh!

1129
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,163
This is crazy! Junior, can you believe it?

1130
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,885
No, that's so... That's so great.

1131
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,645
Yeah, yeah, you should go.

1132
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,210
Oh, yeah, well, after we deliver the baby.
But, yeah!

1133
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,363
No, no, no. I can take care of the baby.

1134
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,646
You should go now.

1135
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,725
No, no, no.
We have to finish the delivery.

1136
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,961
I'm sorry to cut you off.

1137
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,090
You know what's so funny is
just then when you said "real family",

1138
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,605
it, like, weirdly hurt my feelings.

1139
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,962
But I realized how stupid that is.

1140
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,368
I mean, I'm a bird
and you're, like, a sloppy human

1141
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,046
and that's not our baby.
It's just some baby.

1142
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,283
Well, I mean, we're not, like, a "family",
but we are like a family.

1143
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:02,001
Well, it's like we are
except instead we're more like employees

1144
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,685
who are delivering a package,
and that's all.

1145
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,171
Do you know what I mean?

1146
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,481
And you should go to where you belong.

1147
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,846
Now. Do you know what I mean?

1148
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,729
No! Junior, we are a team, okay?

1149
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,161
We're gonna deliver this baby,
then we're gonna meet my parents,

1150
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,682
- then I'm gonna show them Stork Mountain.
- I was supposed to fire you.

1151
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,921
Okay?

1152
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,682
You were supposed to fire me?

1153
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,205
Yeah.

1154
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,045
Well, "liberate"."Free". Yes, fire.

1155
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,690
And then I didn't,
and then this all happened.

1156
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,161
Look, there's nothing waiting for you
back at Stork Mountain.

1157
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,366
Who cares though?

1158
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,204
It's time for you to go
and meet your real family!

1159
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,283
That's exciting, right?

1160
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,401
Look, I...

1161
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,046
I just think this is
for the best, you know?

1162
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,249
It's what you've always wanted.

1163
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,601
Yeah, I wanna go meet my family.

1164
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,525
So, yeah, I better go now, I guess.

1165
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,922
It's gonna be fine.
I'll take good care of her.

1166
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,407
Okay, okay. Fine.

1167
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,726
Goodbye, little girl.

1168
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,882
Have a good trip back home.

1169
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,451
You take care...

1170
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,887
And be safe.

1171
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,448
I'm scared.

1172
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,649
They're your family.
They're going to love you.

1173
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:43,729
I'll be right here.

1174
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,445
Oh, oh! Give me your camera.

1175
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,967
I'd love to capture this family moment.

1176
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,564
Okay, camera rolling and action.

1177
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:04,682
Yup. Okay.

1178
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,486
Ring the doorbell.

1179
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,962
I don't hear a doorbell ringing.

1180
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,569
You're right. Let's take our time.

1181
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,961
I've only waited my whole life for this!

1182
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,281
Tulip?

1183
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,009
Hmm?

1184
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,525
The storks!

1185
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,401
Oh, boy!

1186
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,125
- Here we go!
- Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

1187
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,611
- Okay. Big smile!
- I'm a little nervous. Okay.

1188
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,205
Everyone, calm down!

1189
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,805
This is not to code.

1190
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,570
- What?
- This all has to come down.

1191
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,321
Hunter?

1192
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,323
- You're fired!
- But, but, but...

1193
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,164
"But, but, but..." You are so idiotic!

1194
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,560
How were you not suspicious?

1195
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,690
I thought it was
a gentrifying neighborhood.

1196
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,882
Didn't expect to see you here, brah!

1197
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,724
Oh, yes, I did. I set it up.

1198
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,121
Seize the thing!

1199
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,764
Wait, no! Not the baby!

1200
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,443
Don't worry. She's gonna be fine.

1201
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,721
She's with penguins.

1202
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,451
They have whole documentaries
about how great they are at babysitting.

1203
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:36,961
And she'll be an excellent swimmer.

1204
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,885
And then when she's old enough,
we'll return her to the human world.

1205
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,407
That's insane! You need to deliver her!

1206
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,848
We can't let it get out that the new
boss accidentally made a baby!

1207
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,968
Our stock would plummet,
everything we've built.

1208
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,401
My entire company will fall apart!

1209
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,244
Those parents can never find out.

1210
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,129
Okay, we're ready to go.

1211
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,722
Who's the baby now?

1212
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,206
Good enough.

1213
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,129
- "Cease and desist"?
- Why?

1214
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,931
This is not up to code,
and quite frankly, it looks dangerous.

1215
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,081
We can't tear it down.

1216
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,288
'Cause then the storks won't
deliver my baby brother.

1217
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,648
The policeman's right, Nate.

1218
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,804
They don't deliver babies. Not anymore.

1219
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,764
Then why did we do all this stuff?

1220
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,442
Because we were having
such fun playing with you.

1221
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,524
Oh, honey. We spent time together.

1222
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,444
And that's what matters.

1223
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,967
So is this like
a ticket thing or a warning thing?

1224
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,321
It feels like a warning, right?

1225
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,289
Yeah, we are warned.
We are properly warned.

1226
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,084
Oh, buddy.

1227
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,886
Come on.

1228
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,446
What?

1229
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,521
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

1230
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,841
What happened? Where's the baby?

1231
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,331
They tied me up and took her.

1232
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,686
Why would you think this was her house?

1233
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,490
It's surrounded by
a bunch of scary warehouses!

1234
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,641
Gentrification!

1235
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,689
How could they just take her?
She was your responsibility!

1236
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,841
It wasn't my fault, okay?

1237
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,769
I'm not blaming you.
I'm just worried about the baby!

1238
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,928
Well, I'm also worried,
which is why I'm yelling!

1239
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,684
We're yelling 'cause we're wasting time!

1240
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,649
How can we get back to Cornerstore?

1241
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,804
You're shopping? What are you doing?

1242
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,126
Oh, I see.
You did that so we could hide in the box

1243
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,406
and get back to Cornerstore real quick.

1244
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,726
- That's right.
- Yeah.

1245
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,600
Wait a minute. Junior, what is going on?

1246
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,526
What the heck is this?

1247
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,330
This is Storkcon.

1248
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,404
Once a year, storks come
together for one thing.

1249
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,561
Storkcon!

1250
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,520
The biggest stork convention
on the planet Earth, where birds and...

1251
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,886
- Uh, Junior?
- What?

1252
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,690
What are you doing?
We have to save the baby.

1253
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,683
I'm just a huge fan of Storkcon.

1254
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,080
'Cause it's so cool.

1255
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,607
There. Look, look, look!

1256
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,728
They're headed towards the flight deck.

1257
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,565
What? It calms me.

1258
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,770
Presenting the world's first round box

1259
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,251
Sphericus!

1260
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,969
Circles can hold dreams!

1261
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,684
How are we gonna get through this crowd?

1262
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,171
Hello.

1263
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,848
I'm full of dreams!

1264
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,927
Hey, you guys aren't
supposed to be back here.

1265
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,529
Pardon me, big guy.

1266
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,927
I'm full of dreams!

1267
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,081
Listen to me, Tulip.

1268
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,931
Even if we get the baby,
we have no way to get out of here.

1269
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,326
Storkcon is huge

1270
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,170
for storks come from
all across the world...

1271
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,446
Junior, stop talking about Storkcon!

1272
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,681
All right, I'm sorry.

1273
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,205
It's just really impressive. Here we go.

1274
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,602
Put down that baby!

1275
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,765
Whoo!

1276
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,171
Growth analytics suggest
increased bandwidth

1277
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,971
enabling us to silo
creative core components.

1278
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:27,121
I got your text.

1279
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,725
Sorry, but we could only find
one jet pack.

1280
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,206
All right, give me the pack.
I'm taking her.

1281
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,725
- What? No, I'm taking her.
- No way.

1282
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,921
When you had her last, you lost her.

1283
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,082
- After you left us.
- After you fired me!

1284
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,526
'Cause you're bad at everything.

1285
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:37,721
- I wish I'd never met you.
- Whoa! Wow,

1286
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,086
well, you know what?
I wish I'd never met you.

1287
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,001
The only good thing to come out of all
of this is this baby, and I am taking her.

1288
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,731
This baby is far too precious
and perfect for you. I'm taking her!

1289
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,927
- I'm taking her.
- I'm taking her!

1290
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,923
- I'm taking her!
- I'm taking her!

1291
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,043
What is that?

1292
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,651
My pants fell down. Oh, no!

1293
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,162
- Where are we going?
- I don't know!

1294
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,051
Oh, okay. Not that way.

1295
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,201
Not that way either.

1296
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,441
Hey, guys.

1297
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,929
This is very overwhelming.

1298
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,011
Hand over that thing!

1299
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,966
Come one step closer,

1300
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,324
and I will drop this.

1301
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

1302
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:38,323
Junior, look, hand over the baby,
and we'll let bygones be bygones.

1303
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,527
More than that.

1304
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,728
You can still be...

1305
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,081
Why isn't it working?

1306
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,041
One baby?

1307
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,924
How about a million!

1308
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,127
Wait, no!

1309
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,686
Danger. Danger.

1310
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,286
I did not think that through.

1311
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,210
No!

1312
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,401
- Turn it off! Turn it off!
- Aw!

1313
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,763
You stop it this instant!

1314
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,723
Shut it down! Shut it down!

1315
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,690
This is my moment!

1316
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,446
Whoa!

1317
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,246
Ooh!

1318
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,127
Oh, no!

1319
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,321
Uh...

1320
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,806
Uh-oh.

1321
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,803
- Let's go!
- Come on!

1322
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,962
Go, go, go! Grab it!

1323
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,120
- Over here. I got this one.
- Catch it!

1324
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,089
Got it! Whoo!

1325
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,651
Out of my way! Out of my way!

1326
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,970
Oh, no!

1327
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:56,489
One million babies!

1328
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,761
Oh, hi.

1329
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,967
- Oh, no!
- No!

1330
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,167
Come on!

1331
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,567
Now it's time to do what
I should've done so long ago.

1332
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,406
Destroy the Baby Factory!

1333
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,607
No, you can't.

1334
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,841
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't!

1335
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,530
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't!

1336
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,849
We could go on like this all day.
I'm just gonna go on

1337
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,724
and destroy the Baby Factory.

1338
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,207
Goodbye, baby-making machine.

1339
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,491
What the heck?

1340
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,611
Told you babies were smart.

1341
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,046
Babies are dumb.
Babies are super-duper dumb.

1342
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,201
- No, no, no.
- No, no. Wait, no.

1343
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,647
- Diamond, give it back!
- You stop it, this instant! Stop! Stop!

1344
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,921
Come on!

1345
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,167
What?

1346
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,601
No!

1347
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,086
Whoa!

1348
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,841
Now get over here and get me out of here.

1349
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,081
Oh!

1350
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,442
All right. Don't move.

1351
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,288
Whoa!

1352
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,686
What?

1353
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,801
Oh, no.

1354
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,481
No!

1355
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,602
Always deliver!

1356
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,441
Whoo! You did it!

1357
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,125
I can hear my bones.

1358
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,447
Yeah, we should land
because this hurts so much.

1359
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,211
We did it! We did it! We're a family!

1360
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,283
Yes! We're a...

1361
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,564
Sorry, I kinda ruined the moment there.

1362
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,569
I just have so much internal bleeding.

1363
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,330
We're a family!

1364
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,681
Look at that.

1365
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,201
Uh, what? What? I thought it was broken.

1366
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:21,566
I guess it was just dislocated.

1367
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,245
It must've popped back in when we landed.

1368
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,085
Oh, yep. What a twist.

1369
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,481
- Oh, no.
- Uh...

1370
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,120
So many of them.

1371
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,327
They're pulling my feathers!

1372
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,369
What are we going to do?

1373
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,522
All right, everybody.
Gather around. Gather around.

1374
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,091
An annoying person
asked me once why I wanna be boss.

1375
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,561
Well, I never knew why until today.

1376
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,604
Baby delivery is our true calling.

1377
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,206
This is not just a bunch of
metal and glass

1378
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,523
and whatever that giant
magical crystal-looking thing is made of.

1379
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:10,162
This is the heart of what storks were
put on this Earth to do.

1380
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:11,446
This is our mission.

1381
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,682
We pride ourselves on customer service.

1382
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,810
Well, this is a family that never
got the baby they asked for.

1383
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:18,281
Make a plan.

1384
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,090
Stick to the plan.

1385
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,566
Always deliver.

1386
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,646
That's great. This is great.
But we don't have any pods.

1387
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:31,168
Wait! Everyone, stop. Would you stop?

1388
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,321
Hey!

1389
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,282
- What about these?
- Yes!

1390
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,487
Thank you, Jasper!

1391
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,766
I agree.

1392
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,571
Baby delivery is what we're born to do.

1393
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,443
Should we do anything about him?

1394
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,687
It's...

1395
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,966
It's fine.

1396
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,650
They're here! Oh, my gosh.

1397
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:48,926
I can't believe it! They're here!

1398
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,481
They're here!

1399
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,441
Aw...

1400
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,646
Sign here.

1401
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,847
And sign here.

1402
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,405
Initial here.

1403
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,530
Initial here, here, and...

1404
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,329
I love you, my little lady.

1405
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,649
And we always will.

1406
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:49,966
Bye.

1407
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,321
Oh, so you deliver to the front door.

1408
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,482
So we didn't have to destroy
our entire house.

1409
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,641
Yeah.

1410
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,041
Yo, Stork! I ordered a brother!

1411
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,686
I ordered a brother!

1412
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,882
You wanna feed her her bottle?

1413
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,810
Ninja skills.

1414
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,606
You okay?

1415
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,489
Of course. I'm fine.

1416
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,682
Oh, this does not feel good.

1417
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,649
Is every delivery gonna be like this?

1418
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,451
What can I say? It's a terrible business.

1419
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,126
I feel so sad all the time.

1420
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:33,403
No. I'm actually fine now.

1421
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,449
Yeah, it looks like you're
handling stuff real well.

1422
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,648
Yeah. Look good, feel good.

1423
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,804
Yeah, pretty cool, man.

1424
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,650
Just enjoying it.

1425
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,485
You know, I'm here if you
wanna talk about anything.

1426
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,641
- I'm here to listen.
- Nope.

1427
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,842
Okay, well, it seems like
you're handling it pretty well.

1428
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,001
Yeah, I am.

1429
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,525
- You're shaking.
- You're shaking!

1430
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,370
Junior, it's okay
to let your feelings out.

1431
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,521
I'm not feeling.

1432
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,484
- It's healthy.
- I have no feelings!

1433
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,920
Come on, let it out.

1434
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,047
Hey.

1435
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,042
We're all right behind you.

1436
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:18,801
Go on.

1437
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,888
Who is it, honey?

1438
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,764
Who is it, Dad?

1439
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,131
Mom and Dad?

1440
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,846
All right, guys.

1441
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,445
We delivered her.

1442
01:20:58,600 --> 01:20:59,601
Let's go.

1443
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,841
Junior!

1444
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,250
Where are you going? Get over here.

1445
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,401
Yeah!

1446
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,131
- Come on!
- No, no, no.

1447
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,811
You love it.
