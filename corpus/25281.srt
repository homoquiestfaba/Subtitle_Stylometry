1
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:33,496
Almost got hung myself once.

2
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:36,697
Didn't care for it much.

3
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:38,975
How about you?

4
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:44,183
We'll leave you now.

5
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:47,495
Don't want anyone to see me here. . .

6
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:50,862
. . .get the crazy notion that I was
somehow connected with your. . .

7
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:52,538
. . .accidental death.

8
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:54,619
On the other hand. . .

9
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:58,543
. . .it's not good for a man
to be out here alone.

10
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:01,015
The mind can do terrible things.

11
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:05,979
Enjoy the company.

12
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:25,820
Oh, snakes!

13
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:36,774
Don't go without me,
all right, Ollie?

14
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:38,900
Lord. . .

15
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:41,904
. . .whatever I've done
to piss you off. . .

16
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,616
. . .if you'd just
get me out of this. . .

17
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:47,663
. . .Iet me know what it was,
I'll rectify the situation.

18
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:51,577
It hadjust beeb a shitty week
for me from the begibbibg.

19
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,624
It all started wheb I was headibg
ibto Crystal River...

20
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:56,776
... to take some mobey
from the babk.

21
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:59,903
I should've kbowb there was
bad luck ob the horizob...

22
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:01,583
... wheb my horse got stoleb...

23
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:04,942
...abd I had to replace it
with less thab a thoroughbred.

24
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,335
My luck had to chabge fast.

25
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:17,419
The poker game of the cebtury
was four days away ib St. Louis...

26
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:21,260
...abd I was still $3,000 short
of the ebtrabce fee.

27
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:24,304
There was bo way ib hell
I would miss that game.

28
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:27,423
It wasb 't obly the half-milliob
dollar pot to be wob...

29
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:30,463
... though that kibd of mobey
certaibly demabds attebtiob...

30
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:33,583
...but I beeded to kbow
how good I really was.

31
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:35,898
Obce abd for all.

32
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:13,414
I had to hole up here
for the bight.

33
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:16,784
Busibess would have to wait
till morbibg.

34
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:25,177
-Hello, sir.
-Hi, son.

35
00:05:27,585 --> 00:05:28,540
How much?

36
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:30,218
On a day, week or month?

37
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:35,099
Not to take care of him, how much
to just take him. Permanently.

38
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:38,134
This man wants to sell a burro.

39
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,105
That burro ain't worth a dollar.

40
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,296
You got yourself a deal.

41
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,018
Here's your dollar.

42
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,898
He doesn't eat much,
but he's a regular jackass.

43
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,024
And he always likes
to be called Arthur.

44
00:05:56,665 --> 00:06:00,499
From the momebt I slapped eyes
ob this hombre , I smelled trouble...

45
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:02,616
...abd refried beabs.

46
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:07,099
Somethibg else told me that this
was botjust a chabce meetibg.

47
00:06:35,065 --> 00:06:37,943
I'll see your 1 0
and I'll raise you 1 0.

48
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:44,020
I call.

49
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:45,982
-What do you got?
-Full house.

50
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:48,059
That beats me.

51
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:50,734
Damn. You are a lucky lady.

52
00:07:03,785 --> 00:07:05,377
Is this seat taken?

53
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,304
It is now.

54
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:11,537
My name is Annabelle Bransford.

55
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,139
What do they call you?

56
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:15,535
Bret Maverick.
I'm pleased to meet you.

57
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:17,536
I like the game the way it is.

58
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:22,135
Well, I bring all sorts
of pluses to the table.

59
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:25,542
I hardly ever bluff
and I never, ever cheat.

60
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:27,894
I don't believe it.

61
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:30,178
Neither do l.

62
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:32,654
I like the game just the way it is.

63
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:34,417
What good is an empty chair?

64
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:36,020
Indeed.

65
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:38,176
I'll bet I can change your mind.

66
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,422
I promise that I will lose
for at least an hour.

67
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:44,215
Sounds good.

68
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:46,097
My kind of player.

69
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:48,063
We're playing five-card draw.

70
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:49,539
Please, sit down.

71
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:52,015
My name is
Mrs. Annabelle Bransford.

72
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:56,341
I caught that before, ma'am.
Except the ""Mrs. ""

73
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:58,054
Ante up.

74
00:07:58,745 --> 00:07:59,700
I'm in.

75
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:01,459
Same game. Chips, sir.

76
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,775
You can lose as much as you want.

77
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,024
Two hundred.

78
00:08:09,465 --> 00:08:12,502
-You did say you'd lose for an hour.
-I'm a man of my word.

79
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:13,541
I know.

80
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:21,938
Place your bets.

81
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:50,304
It's about time.

82
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,939
I'll see you. . .

83
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:03,818
. . .and raise you 20.

84
00:10:04,465 --> 00:10:06,660
Slow down,
I'm running low on chips.

85
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:08,901
I'll see your bet and. . .

86
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:12,014
. . .I'll call.

87
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,138
Two pair. Aces over queens.

88
00:10:14,305 --> 00:10:16,694
Lucky for me, I had 3 sixes.

89
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:21,180
Sorry.

90
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:25,454
Nice pot.

91
00:10:25,745 --> 00:10:27,224
Broke your losing streak.

92
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:28,573
That one shouldn't count.

93
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:30,779
Beg your pardon?

94
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:33,141
I don't think
that hand should count.

95
00:10:34,545 --> 00:10:36,661
You got any logical reasons
why not?

96
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:38,778
My mind wasn't on the game.

97
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:41,178
His mind wasn't on the--

98
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:45,499
What's your name, son?

99
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,421
Johnny.

100
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:48,098
You got a last name?

101
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:49,778
Johnny Hardin.

102
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:56,174
What's your occupation?

103
00:10:57,025 --> 00:10:58,094
I'm a gunfighter.

104
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:06,019
I have to assume
since you're still alive. . .

105
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,261
. . .and playing cards with us. . .

106
00:11:08,865 --> 00:11:10,378
. . .that you're good at it.

107
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:12,778
Care to find out?

108
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:19,981
Gentlemen, this hand definitely
does not count. Take it all.

109
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:24,253
Whatever you think's fair, and
I'll be content with the leavings.

110
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:25,864
You always been gutless?

111
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:32,061
I think so. For as long
as I can remember at any rate.

112
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:36,093
My old pappy used to say,
""He who fights and runs away. . .

113
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:38,421
. . .can run away another day. ""

114
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:45,340
What?

115
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,254
Look, I don't see--

116
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,899
Slow down there!

117
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:54,618
Where's the fire, son?

118
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:59,500
Slow down. Don't shoot me, okay?
I'm just trying to. . .expound.

119
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:03,582
I was saying, I don't see
what's so great about being brave.

120
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:06,624
I'm a card player.
Call me a gambler.

121
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,935
I want to become an old gambler.

122
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:11,016
You are a gunfighter.

123
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:14,225
An exceptional one at that,
from what I hear.

124
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:18,094
If I went up against you, what
chance would I have had? Answer?

125
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,694
Zero.

126
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:26,864
Absolutely none whatsoever.

127
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:30,220
Again?

128
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:38,300
Damn thing won't stay
in the holster.

129
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:41,017
I must have a spring in there.

130
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:43,176
Come on, let's just play poker.

131
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:45,737
Who wants to play poker?

132
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:48,138
Who wants to see
someone get killed?

133
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:51,415
Let's play poker.

134
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,700
I'd rather be rich than dead.

135
00:12:58,305 --> 00:13:00,819
Was that fast?
I thought that was fast.

136
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,663
Was it fast? Was it?

137
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:06,780
What was it?

138
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,014
Stud?

139
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:10,454
I think I prefer draw!

140
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:13,615
Just kidding.

141
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:17,063
Sorry. I couldn't resist it.

142
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:20,619
My ante's in.

143
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:36,058
I'll raise you $75.

144
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:41,300
That takes care of your bet.

145
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:45,136
And I'll raise you whatever that is,
looks like 1 00.

146
00:13:49,905 --> 00:13:50,940
Shit! I fold.

147
00:13:56,225 --> 00:13:57,817
You didn't pay to look. . . .

148
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:59,657
You said you never bluffed.

149
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:01,258
I had a pair of aces!

150
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:05,213
No, I said I never cheated
and I also said I hardly ever bluff.

151
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:06,938
This is one of the ""hardlys. ""

152
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:08,379
You've been cheating
the whole game.

153
00:14:09,505 --> 00:14:12,702
What do you think I was doing
during that first hour?

154
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:14,537
I was learning your ""tells. ""

155
00:14:15,865 --> 00:14:18,618
Your weakness comes
when you get your hand. . .

156
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:22,579
. . .shuffle the cards back and forth
and act a little fidgety.

157
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:25,015
I just called you a cheat!

158
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,615
You also called me gutless. . .

159
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:29,815
. . .but I figured
you were just teasing.

160
00:14:31,185 --> 00:14:33,415
Get your hands off him!

161
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:35,179
We get him first!

162
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:39,980
When I seen you through the window,
I believed in the Almighty.

163
00:14:40,785 --> 00:14:41,900
You were drinking.

164
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,863
A lot. And you played bad.
Whose fault is that?

165
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:48,700
Yours, you bastard!
It's all your fault!

166
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:50,218
It's our time now.

167
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:05,980
There's going to be a fight.

168
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:07,419
Come here, son.

169
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:10,534
I want you
to hold onto this for me.

170
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:13,656
If they get to whupping me. . .

171
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,656
. . .you can shoot me.

172
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:18,856
See this doesn't get dirty.

173
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:19,980
Good luck!

174
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:37,578
I'm going to cut you up. . .

175
00:15:37,785 --> 00:15:38,854
. . .fancy man!

176
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:26,897
You're a pretty good fighter.

177
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:29,295
-I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.
-Me too.

178
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:31,262
By the way, I won 20 cents.

179
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:34,896
Thanks to my lucky shirt.

180
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:36,498
Speaking of my 20 cents. . . .

181
00:16:57,065 --> 00:16:59,863
All right! My shirt's damaged!
Damn!

182
00:17:00,065 --> 00:17:02,898
What the hell else bad
can happen? You!

183
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:06,184
What did you say before?
You called me something.

184
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,221
Nothing important.

185
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:08,858
He called you a gutless coward.

186
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:12,143
I did not say that. I might've said
a gutless cheat. . .

187
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:13,898
Cheat? Cheat?

188
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:16,064
. . .but I was teasing.

189
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:17,215
Teasing?

190
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:23,583
I don't like being teased.

191
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:27,654
My friend, I'm sorry.

192
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:31,623
Now I'm teasing you.

193
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:34,298
Let's play poker.

194
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,664
Let me get your chair.

195
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,016
That was truly amazing.

196
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,416
I just get lucky sometimes.

197
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:49,860
Whose deal was it? Mine?

198
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:53,102
Excuse me. Think I'm through
with y'all for the evening.

199
00:17:53,665 --> 00:17:54,939
G'night, ma'am.

200
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:56,779
Good night, son.

201
00:17:58,225 --> 00:17:59,453
Five-card draw all right?

202
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,461
Whatever.

203
00:18:01,505 --> 00:18:02,460
Mind if I take six?

204
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,218
Little poker humor.
I'm just teasing you again.

205
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:31,134
Who is it?

206
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,619
Annabelle Bransford.

207
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,977
I shouldn't be doing this.

208
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:51,300
You're just standing
in the hallway.

209
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,496
That's still legal in this state.

210
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,855
If only I weren't a married woman.

211
00:19:09,185 --> 00:19:11,096
I couldn't help myself.

212
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,894
My very being cried out
to hold you.

213
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:17,178
Stop by anytime.

214
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:20,864
I know we may never
see each other again. . .

215
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:23,335
. . .so I think it's safe to say. . .

216
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:25,499
. . .you are the most. . .

217
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,737
. . .blindingly attractive man
that I've ever seen.

218
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:35,260
Goodbye.

219
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,335
How can I possibly go on. . .

220
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:46,898
. . .without my wallet?

221
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,776
If you don't give me back my money,
I'll have you jailed.

222
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:56,100
Don't get mad at me. I can't help it
if you're a miserable thief.

223
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:58,825
I'm a very good thief.
I just been having. . .

224
00:19:58,985 --> 00:19:59,974
. . .bad luck.

225
00:20:00,105 --> 00:20:01,936
I know what that's all about.

226
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:06,057
Where're you from? Your accent
could use some work too.

227
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:09,375
Most gentlemen enjoy my Southern.

228
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:11,376
That's not in dispute.

229
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:14,663
But I'll bet there is no
Mr. Bransford, is there?

230
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:18,980
No, there isn't and there never
will be, thank you very much.

231
00:20:19,945 --> 00:20:21,856
Now what do we do?

232
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:23,778
You're not gonna turn me in?

233
00:20:24,585 --> 00:20:27,145
I am law-abiding.
It's my duty to turn you in.

234
00:20:28,105 --> 00:20:29,458
I'm afraid I'll have to.

235
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:34,493
What the hell! I got my money back
and there's no harm done.

236
00:20:35,225 --> 00:20:36,817
Let's just call it square,
shall we?

237
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:44,620
Damn!

238
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:46,660
What?

239
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,981
Well, you're just so irritating
and likeable.

240
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:53,381
I have to work on that, I guess.

241
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,183
There you go, all likable again.

242
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:02,019
I think. . .

243
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:05,660
. . .had we known each other
under different circumstances. . .

244
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:08,095
. . .we'd have hated each other.

245
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:14,255
There's no Mrs. Maverick, is there?

246
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,374
I'm sure I would've remembered.

247
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:21,093
May l?

248
00:21:44,745 --> 00:21:46,736
I wish we'd never met.

249
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:48,740
Goodbye.

250
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,816
Son of a bitch!

251
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:31,697
Can I be of some help?

252
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:37,773
You must admit
I was better this time.

253
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:40,180
Not just better.
You were good.

254
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:42,176
-I was?
-Not just good. Very good!

255
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:43,374
Thank you.

256
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:45,699
And now. . .

257
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:48,459
. . .it's time you do
something I want.

258
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:51,623
How dare you? I'm a lady.
Not in a million years!

259
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:54,094
Not if you were 1 00 years old.
Not if I was 1 00.

260
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:56,420
I don't want
to go to bed with you.

261
00:22:56,905 --> 00:22:58,054
Why not?

262
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:01,377
I'd be too frightened!

263
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:04,264
If I dozed, God knows
what parts of me you'd steal.

264
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,223
I'd wake up with
all sorts of things missing.

265
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:10,539
But I don't know
how to clean this. . .

266
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:12,656
. . .and you must know how to.

267
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:16,023
The laundry's closed,
I leave early and you owe me.

268
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:17,459
Easy on the starch.

269
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:22,453
If I can't touch you,
I can touch your shirt and dream.

270
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,816
-Want a hand?
-Yes, thank you.

271
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:38,340
Thank you.

272
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:39,940
Good night, Bert.

273
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:44,022
Bret. That's my name. Bret.

274
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:18,620
Good morning.

275
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:20,739
Is Eugene in?

276
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,896
Yes, sir, but he's busy.

277
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:35,494
Get up, you bald-headed reprobate!

278
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,944
On your feet!

279
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:39,943
I need some cash.
Empty your pockets on the desk.

280
00:24:40,185 --> 00:24:41,538
Shut up!

281
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:43,377
-Put the cash on the table.
-I don't have any.

282
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:44,739
Robbery!

283
00:24:49,385 --> 00:24:51,615
It's my friend Bret saying hello.

284
00:24:51,785 --> 00:24:54,015
Tell everybody everything's okay.

285
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:56,260
Son of a bitch!

286
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:57,460
Silly bastard!

287
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,218
How are you, Eugene?

288
00:24:59,385 --> 00:25:01,376
Things couldn't be worse, Bret.

289
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:03,218
I know I owe you $1 ,000.

290
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:04,340
I came for it.

291
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:05,540
Would you take 1 00?

292
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:09,864
I've never welshed on a debt.
Give me to year's end.

293
00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:14,419
The end of the--?
Eugene, I need that money right now!

294
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:17,934
For the All Rivers
Poker Championship.

295
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:20,494
-How much it cost to enter that?
-$25,000.

296
00:25:22,585 --> 00:25:25,145
I'm $3,000 short,
but with Joseph and you. . . .

297
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:26,818
Pork Chop Slim owed me too. . .

298
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:29,624
. . .but his widow used the money
for his funeral.

299
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:31,298
They never found the body.

300
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:32,741
What?

301
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:34,497
They never found his body.

302
00:25:36,185 --> 00:25:37,698
The widow conned me.

303
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:40,175
What's with people nowadays?

304
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:44,093
I know what you mean. You can't
trust them. Take my last 1 00.

305
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:47,223
Not your last 1 00.
What about Matilda and the kid?

306
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:49,780
Bank robbery!

307
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:52,981
You heard him! Bank robbery!

308
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:56,975
I'll take this, gunslinger.

309
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:59,784
Much obliged.
Empty your pockets, old man.

310
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:01,856
I got a silver dollar.

311
00:26:02,025 --> 00:26:04,414
Do better!
My trigger finger's itchy.

312
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:06,974
All right, don't shoot.
Don't shoot!

313
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:10,658
Take it.

314
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:18,344
Hundreds and thousands!
You said you were broke?!

315
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:19,858
I am now! He's got it.

316
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:21,299
And I'll get the rest too!

317
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:23,137
I don't have any more.

318
00:26:23,305 --> 00:26:26,900
Pull those pockets out.
Son of a bitch! Hurry up!

319
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,620
Give me that!

320
00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:41,660
Blow the safe!

321
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:44,020
Light up!

322
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,698
Heads down, everybody!

323
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:00,654
I'm getting too old for this shit!

324
00:27:11,785 --> 00:27:14,345
You sons of bitches
beat me by a day!

325
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:19,779
You're holding out.

326
00:27:21,065 --> 00:27:22,896
That's all I got left.

327
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:33,938
Nothing to worry about.

328
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:37,860
We want to talk to you, pal.

329
00:27:39,345 --> 00:27:40,983
Where're you going?

330
00:27:41,625 --> 00:27:42,774
Got you now!

331
00:27:45,225 --> 00:27:47,375
-Anybody see you?
-Not a soul.

332
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:51,302
You come in any later last night,
that monster would've eaten me alive.

333
00:27:51,465 --> 00:27:52,739
We saw that.

334
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,179
Anybody suspect anything?

335
00:27:54,345 --> 00:27:56,256
Not a thing. You were great!

336
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,017
The truth is, we enjoyed it.

337
00:27:58,185 --> 00:27:59,459
No kidding.

338
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:01,338
Thanks for taking it so easy on us.

339
00:28:01,465 --> 00:28:02,420
Easy?

340
00:28:02,705 --> 00:28:04,343
Those were my best shots.

341
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:07,663
The one there
rung my bell a little bit.

342
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:10,214
-That's good.
-You owe us five dollars apiece.

343
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:14,214
Damn right.
That's $5 a beating, right?

344
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:18,577
You won't believe this.

345
00:28:18,705 --> 00:28:21,139
They cleaned the bank and me out.

346
00:28:21,305 --> 00:28:22,704
I'm gonna have to owe you.

347
00:28:22,865 --> 00:28:24,457
Are you saying. . .

348
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:27,901
. . .you don't have our money
for taking your best shots?

349
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:32,460
-Killing me won't make you richer.
-But it'll make me feel better.

350
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:35,417
You got a point there.

351
00:28:35,585 --> 00:28:36,938
Let's see here.

352
00:28:39,345 --> 00:28:41,222
I'm sorry. I forgot!

353
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:42,744
I honestly forgot.

354
00:28:42,865 --> 00:28:45,095
I always keep something pinned
inside my vest. . .

355
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:47,181
. . .for such a rainy day occasion.

356
00:28:47,345 --> 00:28:50,143
It's a good thing.
It was clouding up pretty quick.

357
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,057
That's a $1 00 bill.

358
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,899
A $1 00 bill!?

359
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:57,817
But I do need some change.

360
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,856
80 will be close enough. 75.

361
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:02,902
Let's see what we got here.

362
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:06,377
I got 1 7 here.

363
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:09,423
$1 7? You owe me $8 for a month.

364
00:29:09,585 --> 00:29:12,145
-We'll settle that later.
-You always cheat me.

365
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:13,700
I can't believe you!

366
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:16,544
Close enough. You came out
better than you think.

367
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:18,616
Nice working with you.

368
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:20,901
You keep this
under your hats, okay?

369
00:29:21,145 --> 00:29:23,261
News travels fast in the old West.

370
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,977
That's $25 apiece.

371
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:51,022
Sibce I was a kid,
I believed I had a gift.

372
00:29:51,585 --> 00:29:54,304
That if I thought hard ebough
about a card...

373
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:56,935
...l'd be able
to cut straight to it.

374
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:02,940
My old pappy always said
I was a damb fool. But I kbew...

375
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:05,903
...if I really believed
abd made it happeb...

376
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:09,421
... that would be
bothibg short of magic.

377
00:30:15,025 --> 00:30:16,697
Of course it didb 't always work.

378
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,463
What do I expect!

379
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:22,138
Ib fact, it bever worked.

380
00:30:31,545 --> 00:30:33,137
Ah, sweet woman!

381
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:40,618
Lucky shirt.

382
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:57,259
Wait! You!

383
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:14,374
Hold up the ferry!
Wait for me!

384
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:27,017
You did this on purpose!

385
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,618
You bet I did!

386
00:31:29,185 --> 00:31:30,538
This is my lucky shirt.

387
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,661
Do your own laundry then.

388
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:35,017
My underwear comes from New York.

389
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:38,183
You got any idea
where this shirt was made, lady?

390
00:31:38,785 --> 00:31:40,696
Paris, France, that's where!

391
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,982
You think I can go to the nearest
store and get another!

392
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:46,613
Why don't you try
the kiddie department?

393
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:49,736
Remove your hands from the lady.

394
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:54,542
When you least expect it,
your hero arrives.

395
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:59,260
Zane Cooper. Folks call me Coop.
Suits me just fine.

396
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:03,581
This creature's named Maverick
and I'm Annabelle Bransford.

397
00:32:03,745 --> 00:32:06,259
-I'll be taking this coach.
-So am l.

398
00:32:06,945 --> 00:32:08,617
That ought to be fun.

399
00:32:08,785 --> 00:32:12,539
Lord knows what he'd have done,
alone in the stage for two days.

400
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:16,221
I hope you can relax
and enjoy the journey now.

401
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:20,173
See, my feeling is
that if there weren't any women. . .

402
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:22,217
. . .none of us would be here.

403
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:25,265
What kind of sense does that make?

404
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:28,544
If there were no men,
we wouldn't be here either.

405
00:32:28,705 --> 00:32:30,218
Are you mocking me?

406
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:31,579
Don't get ruffled.

407
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:34,817
I was agreeing with you
in a totally unusual way.

408
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:39,101
What would this world come to
without gentlemen like yourself?

409
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:44,856
A passenger! Come ahead.

410
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:47,814
Right this way, sir. Want a hand?

411
00:32:50,545 --> 00:32:52,217
I'm the driver.

412
00:32:53,745 --> 00:32:54,939
Are you all right?

413
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,420
Why does everybody ask me that?

414
00:32:57,585 --> 00:33:00,463
Get me up there so we can
get this thing going.

415
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,424
I think it's about time
we get to know each other.

416
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:24,383
Mr. Maverick has aspirations
to be a card player.

417
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:28,140
I'm not totally ignorant of cards.
Can't be in my line of work.

418
00:33:28,305 --> 00:33:30,375
-And pray what might that be?
-Lawman.

419
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:35,535
I bet you're the best there is.
I can tell things about a man.

420
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:39,533
I can't quite place your accent.
Where in the South are you from?

421
00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:41,497
Ever been to Mobile?

422
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:43,977
That's where I'm from.

423
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:46,454
Mobile, Alabama?
Hell, I been there.

424
00:33:46,865 --> 00:33:49,425
I'll bet we know the same people.
You start.

425
00:33:50,225 --> 00:33:52,455
I've tried so hard
to forget that place.

426
00:33:52,585 --> 00:33:54,860
I endured
such personal tragedy there.

427
00:33:58,065 --> 00:34:01,023
A woman's suffering
is not a funny thing, Bertie.

428
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:03,179
There are exceptions.

429
00:34:04,865 --> 00:34:06,457
Watch your billfold.

430
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:20,457
Hey, old-timer!

431
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,822
The thief and the old guy
find it bumpy back here!

432
00:34:57,025 --> 00:34:58,822
How could you face them all down?

433
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:00,901
Nine men, all of them armed?

434
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:04,819
A man gives his word to do his job,
he's honorbound to do it.

435
00:35:05,185 --> 00:35:07,176
-Weren't you afraid?
-A mite.

436
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:10,933
Mr. Maverick
doesn't believe in bravery.

437
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:14,298
I think bravery's a fine thing. . .

438
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:17,656
. . .just overrated is all
and doesn't suit me personally.

439
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:19,418
I just realized something.

440
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:20,701
What's that?

441
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,139
You're spineless.

442
00:35:23,345 --> 00:35:25,859
Yes. It's kept me alive
a long time.

443
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:42,296
You fellas got a problem?

444
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:44,458
Heavens to Betsy, no!

445
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:47,658
What's the joke?

446
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:50,778
-You, Pancho. You're the joke.
-Explain that.

447
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:53,699
You'll have to pay us more money
than Maverick did.

448
00:35:58,385 --> 00:35:59,579
He paid you to fall down?

449
00:35:59,745 --> 00:36:01,656
Paid us good too.

450
00:36:02,545 --> 00:36:03,819
A $1 00 bill.

451
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:06,137
That's a good day's work.

452
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:09,736
You fellas ought to see me first.

453
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:12,776
I'd a let you fall down for free.

454
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:33,584
Maverick is mine, anyway.

455
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,617
But this time it's personal.

456
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,379
$1 00 bill!

457
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:06,383
Is he taking a short cut?

458
00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:18,177
Hey, old-timer, wake up!

459
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:25,621
Is he asleep?

460
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,015
It's more serious than that,
he's dead.

461
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:32,303
Get up and stop the stage.

462
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:35,502
I just put a fresh shirt on.
You stop the stage.

463
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:38,697
This wheel's loose.
If it comes off, we're all dead.

464
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:42,380
Go up and stop the stage.
I'll take care of the wheel.

465
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:46,414
-Give me your hat.
-It better fit me when I come back.

466
00:37:58,545 --> 00:37:59,819
Now, Bert. . .

467
00:37:59,985 --> 00:38:02,863
. . .stop playing around
and stop those horses.

468
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:04,260
This is serious!

469
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,417
-He'll be fine. He's pretty handy.
-He is?

470
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:30,375
Why don't you fix the wheel?

471
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:32,343
The wheel is perfect.

472
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:35,338
Then help him. He'll kill you
when he gets back.

473
00:38:35,505 --> 00:38:38,383
No, in the long run,
he'll thank me in his prayers.

474
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:54,099
What's he doing back there?

475
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:25,414
Sorry!

476
00:39:26,225 --> 00:39:29,456
-Stop fooling around!
-You poked me in the eye!

477
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:32,014
Get up there and stop the horses!

478
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,059
Whoa, horses! Stop!

479
00:40:35,385 --> 00:40:37,296
-Let me help you.
-I got it.

480
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:47,815
What's with the wheel?

481
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:51,540
-It's fine.
-Nothing was wrong with it.

482
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:54,380
I know, I got a real good. . .

483
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:56,860
. . .close look at the wheels
from underneath.

484
00:40:57,065 --> 00:40:59,943
Don't you feel better about yourself
for being so brave?

485
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:03,218
-Wasn't that exciting?
-I get it.

486
00:41:03,385 --> 00:41:05,615
This was all for my benefit.

487
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:08,137
To help me build character.

488
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:10,421
-Exactly.
-He's bursting with pride.

489
00:41:11,465 --> 00:41:14,377
That's funny. You'd think
I'd be mad, wouldn't you?

490
00:41:16,465 --> 00:41:17,136
Give me your hand.

491
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:19,540
Don't ever. . .

492
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,905
. . .try and help me again.

493
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:25,740
You either.

494
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:27,503
Now back off.

495
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:28,734
Back off!

496
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:30,538
Go away.

497
00:41:31,225 --> 00:41:32,294
Ungrateful!

498
00:41:49,585 --> 00:41:50,222
Help.

499
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:51,820
What?

500
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:56,620
Help.

501
00:42:03,225 --> 00:42:04,817
What did you say?

502
00:42:06,185 --> 00:42:07,174
Please help me.

503
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:09,063
Okay. Take my hand.

504
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:11,976
You take my hand.

505
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:22,097
Take my other hand.

506
00:42:24,985 --> 00:42:26,100
Watch the cactus!

507
00:42:26,345 --> 00:42:29,576
I don't care about the cactus.
Just get me up there.

508
00:42:29,745 --> 00:42:31,144
You're doing good.

509
00:42:34,905 --> 00:42:36,816
Now get your hands off me!

510
00:42:41,745 --> 00:42:43,064
Ungrateful.

511
00:42:51,305 --> 00:42:55,981
I suppose somebody ought to say
something nice about the deceased.

512
00:42:56,145 --> 00:42:58,864
How do we know he was nice?
We know nothing about him.

513
00:42:59,025 --> 00:43:02,415
The only thing he's got in
his wallet is names of whorehouses.

514
00:43:59,065 --> 00:43:59,861
Trouble!

515
00:44:44,465 --> 00:44:46,456
""Though I walk through the valley. . .

516
00:44:46,545 --> 00:44:48,900
. . .of the shadow of death,
I fear no evil. . . . ""

517
00:44:49,105 --> 00:44:52,177
-They got hit by lndians.
-Yeah, they were lnjuns.

518
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:54,296
Ma'am, it was not lndians.

519
00:44:54,545 --> 00:44:57,298
I seen them.
They were wearing war paint.

520
00:44:57,785 --> 00:44:58,774
If it was lndians. . . .

521
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:01,459
I said we'd take them
to Crystal City.

522
00:45:01,905 --> 00:45:04,021
-That's backtracking.
-Just a day.

523
00:45:04,185 --> 00:45:05,982
I have a game to get to.

524
00:45:06,105 --> 00:45:08,016
I know what you have to get to.

525
00:45:08,225 --> 00:45:11,058
-They took my girl's music box.
-My favorite!

526
00:45:11,225 --> 00:45:13,341
They took the wagon with our money.

527
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:15,254
Simmer down.

528
00:45:16,865 --> 00:45:18,457
How much money?

529
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,138
-What kind of animal are you?
-Vulture.

530
00:45:20,305 --> 00:45:21,818
How much money was that?

531
00:45:22,425 --> 00:45:23,540
$30,000.

532
00:45:23,705 --> 00:45:25,343
We were starting a mission.

533
00:45:27,065 --> 00:45:30,137
If I get back your $30,000,
is it worth 1 0 percent to you?

534
00:45:31,745 --> 00:45:32,814
5 percent.

535
00:45:32,945 --> 00:45:35,140
No, 1 0 percent, Mary Margaret.

536
00:45:35,305 --> 00:45:38,024
I want my wedding dress back
for when I find a husband.

537
00:45:40,545 --> 00:45:42,183
All right. Can you do it?

538
00:45:42,305 --> 00:45:45,342
-I know we can.
-Praise the Lord!

539
00:45:46,665 --> 00:45:50,499
I'll give you your 1 0 percent,
but make those savages suffer.

540
00:45:50,945 --> 00:45:54,984
I'm telling you, there are
no hostile lndians around here.

541
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:05,296
Those are definitely drums.

542
00:46:05,865 --> 00:46:07,457
Right again, Bert.

543
00:46:08,745 --> 00:46:10,337
It's Bret.

544
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:22,981
Well?

545
00:46:23,145 --> 00:46:26,296
They look like dimples in dirt,
but they're horse tracks.

546
00:46:26,425 --> 00:46:30,623
Besides, they're shod horse tracks.
Indians don't shoe their ponies.

547
00:46:30,825 --> 00:46:33,544
They're lndians.
They probably stole the ponies.

548
00:46:33,705 --> 00:46:37,015
-Not everybody's like you.
-What is it with you and lndians?

549
00:46:37,225 --> 00:46:41,537
Nothing. I try and shoot one a day,
if possible. How about you, Coop?

550
00:46:42,185 --> 00:46:46,144
It's their fault, too, for being
on our land before we got here.

551
00:46:50,425 --> 00:46:53,303
-What are you doing here?
-We're partners. 50-50.

552
00:46:53,505 --> 00:46:55,621
Sounds like 50-50 to me.

553
00:46:56,905 --> 00:46:58,338
You want 50% too?

554
00:46:58,505 --> 00:47:00,541
I want those ladies
to get their money.

555
00:47:00,705 --> 00:47:01,820
Oh, fine.

556
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,537
I don't split my bounty
with anybody.

557
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:06,582
Would 60-40 be agreeable?

558
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,696
What'll you do for your 40%?

559
00:47:08,905 --> 00:47:10,133
I'll help.

560
00:47:20,425 --> 00:47:21,494
70-30?

561
00:47:21,825 --> 00:47:23,099
70-30?

562
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:32,264
I don't know about 70-30. You're not
exactly an experienced tracker.

563
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:38,143
Some tracker you are, following
a few horses. Anyone can do that.

564
00:47:38,305 --> 00:47:39,260
Anyone?

565
00:47:39,745 --> 00:47:41,178
See that hawk?

566
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:44,055
I won't shoot the hawk.

567
00:47:44,425 --> 00:47:46,336
You know what that hawk means?

568
00:47:48,025 --> 00:47:50,141
Nothing. But you didn't know that.

569
00:47:50,305 --> 00:47:51,784
-I did!
-You didn't.

570
00:47:51,905 --> 00:47:53,224
Children! Children!

571
00:47:55,945 --> 00:47:58,459
You smell a bunch of lndians
in Montana?

572
00:47:59,745 --> 00:48:01,224
Now be quiet.

573
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:03,253
What is it?

574
00:48:08,705 --> 00:48:10,297
What do you hear?

575
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:11,580
Nothing.

576
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:13,975
I thought I'd nap before sundown.

577
00:48:14,185 --> 00:48:16,255
Sneak up on them in the dark.

578
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:22,782
What are you laughing at?

579
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:37,382
There's 6 horses there.
It's got to be them.

580
00:48:37,545 --> 00:48:40,537
-You got good eyes.
-We got to tie these up.

581
00:48:40,705 --> 00:48:44,095
Wait. Can you teach me
how to be a better poker player?

582
00:48:44,265 --> 00:48:45,220
What, now?

583
00:48:45,385 --> 00:48:48,058
You might be dead later.
I need to know now.

584
00:48:48,705 --> 00:48:50,343
Poker's about observing.

585
00:48:50,465 --> 00:48:53,343
Now observe the U.S. Cavalry brand
on this horse.

586
00:48:53,545 --> 00:48:56,582
They're not lndian ponies.
These are tells. You got tells too.

587
00:48:57,545 --> 00:49:00,537
-You play with your hair at cards.
-I do not!

588
00:49:00,745 --> 00:49:03,305
Would you two shut up? Just listen!

589
00:49:04,825 --> 00:49:06,781
Sounds like a music box.

590
00:49:12,465 --> 00:49:13,818
There they are.

591
00:49:16,105 --> 00:49:18,494
There's the music box
she talked about.

592
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:21,133
And look at that fella
in the back.

593
00:49:21,345 --> 00:49:24,257
He's wearing your sweetheart's
wedding dress, Mary Margaret.

594
00:49:24,745 --> 00:49:26,303
Margaret--? Mary's not my sweetheart.

595
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:28,376
You're on a first name basis.

596
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:30,342
Would you two be quiet!

597
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:33,659
You're crazy!

598
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,735
Did you see any money over there?

599
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:41,060
Nothing.

600
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:44,184
We could take them easy.
They're half drunk.

601
00:49:44,385 --> 00:49:47,297
What's ""we"" doing
in your vocabulary? It's your show.

602
00:49:49,225 --> 00:49:53,013
You'd just stand there and
let me face 6 guys with 6 guns?

603
00:49:53,185 --> 00:49:56,575
I have 1 gun with 6 bullets.
6 guns means 36 bullets.

604
00:49:57,065 --> 00:50:00,375
What if they got 2? That's
72 bullets. Maybe they got rifles.

605
00:50:00,505 --> 00:50:03,383
Shut up. You're babbling.

606
00:50:03,825 --> 00:50:04,735
You're babbling.

607
00:50:05,065 --> 00:50:07,260
-No, I wasn't.
-You are babbling.

608
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:09,535
Don't worry,
they're probably drunk.

609
00:50:09,705 --> 00:50:12,697
Coop faced down 9 men dead sober,
didn't you?

610
00:50:12,905 --> 00:50:13,940
He's always sober.

611
00:50:14,505 --> 00:50:16,416
-She didn't mean that.
-That's what she said.

612
00:50:16,585 --> 00:50:18,177
I said the outlaws were sober!

613
00:50:48,385 --> 00:50:49,864
What if there's trouble?

614
00:50:50,185 --> 00:50:52,335
-Seriously.
-I'm right behind you.

615
00:50:52,705 --> 00:50:53,694
You are?

616
00:50:54,505 --> 00:50:56,223
No ""wheels coming off"" shit.

617
00:50:56,425 --> 00:50:59,462
That was about breaking bones.
This is about dying.

618
00:50:59,945 --> 00:51:01,014
Other way.

619
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:02,658
Dying. Right.

620
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:05,338
Give it to me.

621
00:51:05,505 --> 00:51:07,894
It may be my last chance.
Hand it over.

622
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:09,220
How dare you?!

623
00:51:09,385 --> 00:51:13,822
-I need all I can get.
-Just take your own. Why take mine?

624
00:51:13,985 --> 00:51:16,101
All right, 50 percent.

625
00:51:17,025 --> 00:51:18,014
50-50.

626
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,224
60-40.

627
00:51:21,505 --> 00:51:23,416
All right, 60-40.

628
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:28,416
You're the fastest draw there is.
Why do you need my tiny gun?

629
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,018
Who said he was fastest?

630
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:31,937
Yes, it's true. I am fast.

631
00:51:32,105 --> 00:51:33,538
But I can't hit shit. . .

632
00:51:33,705 --> 00:51:36,856
. . .especially if I aim at real people,
so I need bullets.

633
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:38,424
You back me up.

634
00:51:39,945 --> 00:51:41,663
Bret. My name is Bret.

635
00:51:41,825 --> 00:51:45,181
You're Annabelle, he's Coop.
It's like you're shooting me.

636
00:51:45,665 --> 00:51:47,098
Be careful, okay?

637
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:48,974
Of course.

638
00:51:49,185 --> 00:51:50,174
You, too.

639
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:20,094
Hi, everyone.

640
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:22,460
Wake up!

641
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:23,899
No need to get alarmed.

642
00:52:24,105 --> 00:52:27,177
I saw your fire and thought
I'd come visit for a while.

643
00:52:27,585 --> 00:52:28,904
Who are you?

644
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:30,134
Bert Maverick.

645
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:36,183
I'm Bret Maverick, and I'm here
to say each one of you has a gun. . .

646
00:52:36,665 --> 00:52:38,144
. . .pointed at your head.

647
00:52:40,985 --> 00:52:42,703
Just whistle, so they can hear you.

648
00:52:43,385 --> 00:52:44,454
You're surrounded.

649
00:52:51,225 --> 00:52:52,499
Did another wheel come off?

650
00:52:52,745 --> 00:52:54,417
Clap if you can't whistle!

651
00:52:57,825 --> 00:52:59,736
See? They're out there.

652
00:52:59,905 --> 00:53:03,375
Zane Cooper will blow your brains
out. Probably heard of him.

653
00:53:03,545 --> 00:53:05,740
I know, you're thinking
he's old and decrepit.

654
00:53:05,945 --> 00:53:08,015
But he can still shoot straight.

655
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:10,544
After you is Ugly Annie Bransford.

656
00:53:10,945 --> 00:53:14,142
She came out backwards when
she was born, but nobody noticed.

657
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:18,102
As a kid, they tied a pork chop
on her neck so the dog. . .

658
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:19,061
. . .would play with her.

659
00:53:19,225 --> 00:53:22,740
When she's making love, she has
to pretend she's someone else.

660
00:53:25,905 --> 00:53:27,384
You're all right, Bart.

661
00:53:27,545 --> 00:53:29,297
Admit it, that was funny.

662
00:53:29,505 --> 00:53:30,938
I don't think so.

663
00:53:31,905 --> 00:53:33,816
Some lndians
attacked a wagon train.

664
00:53:33,985 --> 00:53:37,660
Folks said it might be whites acting
like lndians, but I don't believe it.

665
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:41,295
If you come along with me,
we'll settle this matter.

666
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,055
Just follow me. Get up.

667
00:53:44,865 --> 00:53:47,220
Get up. Get in a line and let's go.

668
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,417
You'll remember this!

669
00:53:57,025 --> 00:54:00,495
-Aren't you going to help him?
-A man could get killed doing that.

670
00:54:10,265 --> 00:54:12,335
Did you just help him?

671
00:54:17,945 --> 00:54:19,424
Shot my whiskey bottle!

672
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:28,857
That's my gun!

673
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:32,058
Damn you!

674
00:54:37,465 --> 00:54:39,057
Isn't he wonderful?

675
00:54:42,705 --> 00:54:44,024
Look at that!

676
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:46,574
They're all gone.
Isn't it wonderful?

677
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:49,345
-I'll be rich!
-It was nothing, really.

678
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:52,025
I'll tell you what you did wrong.

679
00:54:52,225 --> 00:54:53,624
Where's the money?

680
00:55:03,745 --> 00:55:06,100
-Take off that dress!
-How dare you!

681
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:08,335
-Not you. Him.
-Put that cash down!

682
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:11,065
-I found it!
-I nearly got blown away!

683
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,785
-I'll take the money.
-I'll count it for you.

684
00:55:13,945 --> 00:55:15,378
Don't let her touch it!

685
00:55:15,705 --> 00:55:18,742
Where are you going?
Stay here and clean up your mess.

686
00:55:18,945 --> 00:55:21,300
Be mature. Clean up this mess.

687
00:55:21,505 --> 00:55:24,338
Get back!
Put those guns down and line up.

688
00:55:24,505 --> 00:55:27,144
Don't let her get
within 1 0 yards of that cash!

689
00:55:31,345 --> 00:55:35,179
I have found you. For He said,
""Seek and ye shall find. ""

690
00:55:35,385 --> 00:55:38,582
And I have found you. Oh, rejoice!

691
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:43,543
Bless you. Bless you for finding
my wedding dress.

692
00:55:43,705 --> 00:55:47,823
Now I can get married. The Lord
thinks it's good to bear children.

693
00:55:47,985 --> 00:55:49,737
It's a beautiful dress.

694
00:55:51,225 --> 00:55:52,499
$2,500. . .

695
00:55:53,305 --> 00:55:54,533
. . . $2,600. . .

696
00:55:55,505 --> 00:55:56,494
. . . $2,800. . . .

697
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,104
$2,700, ma'am.

698
00:55:58,385 --> 00:55:59,864
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

699
00:56:00,145 --> 00:56:00,975
She'd know.

700
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:03,695
$2,700. . .

701
00:56:04,305 --> 00:56:05,579
. . . $2,800. . .

702
00:56:06,545 --> 00:56:07,819
. . .900.

703
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:11,822
$3,000.

704
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:14,545
Here Mr. Maverick,
the 1 0 percent we promised.

705
00:56:18,105 --> 00:56:20,824
That leaves us with $27,000,
Margaret Mary.

706
00:56:20,985 --> 00:56:23,180
That's not enough
to start a mission.

707
00:56:23,345 --> 00:56:26,382
Don't worry, we are honorable women.
We promised Mr. Maverick. . .

708
00:56:26,545 --> 00:56:30,743
. . . $3,000 and we delivered.
The Lord will provide for us.

709
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:49,897
My pappy used to say. . .

710
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:54,223
. . .things such as, ""Never sneeze
when you hide or smile when you lie.

711
00:56:54,385 --> 00:56:56,660
And never,
under any circumstances. . .

712
00:56:56,825 --> 00:57:01,421
. . .take money from women who've lost
a dog, a wedding dress and a wagon. ""

713
00:57:01,745 --> 00:57:02,860
Hallelujah!

714
00:57:03,385 --> 00:57:05,296
I lost a wedding dress!

715
00:57:08,985 --> 00:57:12,773
We have got our money back.
Saint Maverick!

716
00:57:12,985 --> 00:57:15,215
We had a deal.
You owed me my 30 percent.

717
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:19,702
I'm a man of my word. You can have
30 percent of whatever I got.

718
00:57:22,265 --> 00:57:24,938
I hate to interrupt,
but I got a problem.

719
00:57:25,825 --> 00:57:28,544
If those renegades
weren't real lndians. . .

720
00:57:28,705 --> 00:57:30,821
. . .who was beating those drums?

721
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:32,459
Maybe it was them.

722
00:57:51,185 --> 00:57:53,096
I'll take care of this.

723
00:58:02,905 --> 00:58:03,815
Get that?

724
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,818
You know about lndians.
Can you speak to him?

725
00:58:08,345 --> 00:58:09,778
I'll do my best.

726
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:29,740
What's he say?

727
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:33,894
It seems we've committed
a terrible sin.

728
00:58:34,585 --> 00:58:35,984
We're on sacred ground.

729
00:58:36,465 --> 00:58:39,821
We didn't know we were on
sacred ground. Can't you tell him?

730
00:58:55,705 --> 00:58:59,493
His gods demand a sacrifice.
There's no way out of it.

731
00:58:59,865 --> 00:59:01,457
Sacrifice?

732
00:59:02,425 --> 00:59:03,494
Human.

733
00:59:22,385 --> 00:59:25,900
We can go if one of us
passes a bravery test. . .

734
00:59:26,065 --> 00:59:27,054
. . .but one of us
must go with him.

735
00:59:27,385 --> 00:59:29,103
What's the bravery test?

736
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,501
You see that?

737
00:59:31,825 --> 00:59:35,022
He cuts off your hands.
If you don't make a sound, you pass.

738
01:00:08,145 --> 01:00:10,215
I'll die before I let him touch you!

739
01:00:10,385 --> 01:00:12,296
There's too many of them!

740
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:15,822
You're right. Don't show fear!
It makes them crazy.

741
01:00:18,705 --> 01:00:21,139
One of us must go,
or there'll be bloodshed.

742
01:00:21,305 --> 01:00:22,897
-I'll go.
-No, I'll go.

743
01:00:23,065 --> 01:00:26,375
I owe you. I almost
got you killed twice already.

744
01:00:26,585 --> 01:00:30,544
I can't do what you can.
You get these people to safety.

745
01:00:31,185 --> 01:00:32,982
I'll go, but it's okay.

746
01:00:33,265 --> 01:00:34,380
Third time lucky.

747
01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:41,745
I liked it just now
when you called me Bret.

748
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:44,061
One thing.

749
01:00:44,505 --> 01:00:45,574
What, Bret?

750
01:00:46,065 --> 01:00:49,740
When you bluff, never tap
your fingernails on your teeth.

751
01:00:49,905 --> 01:00:51,975
That's your second giveaway.

752
01:00:52,985 --> 01:00:55,818
Even at a time like this,
you think of others.

753
01:01:15,185 --> 01:01:16,664
Goodbye, my lady.

754
01:01:21,425 --> 01:01:22,744
You were right.

755
01:01:23,985 --> 01:01:26,579
I never felt better in my life
than I do right now.

756
01:01:27,545 --> 01:01:29,137
Take care of yourself.

757
01:01:30,705 --> 01:01:32,616
When they. . .

758
01:01:33,145 --> 01:01:35,340
. . .cut my hands off,
my lucky shirt'll fit.

759
01:01:40,025 --> 01:01:40,935
Bye, Bret.

760
01:01:49,145 --> 01:01:51,705
What was that all about?
My throat is killing me.

761
01:01:51,985 --> 01:01:53,259
Tell you later.

762
01:01:55,825 --> 01:01:57,941
I could die happy right now.

763
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:29,265
Where'd you get this piece of junk?

764
01:02:29,465 --> 01:02:33,094
I won it off a Russian at poker.
Okay, watch out for it!

765
01:02:33,305 --> 01:02:35,182
My bicycle! Look at that!

766
01:02:35,345 --> 01:02:37,256
I think I'll stick to a horse.

767
01:02:38,545 --> 01:02:40,183
Why are they laughing?

768
01:02:40,345 --> 01:02:41,744
Nobody's ever ridden it before.

769
01:02:45,025 --> 01:02:47,255
You sure do pick the spots.

770
01:02:47,585 --> 01:02:48,859
I know.

771
01:02:49,505 --> 01:02:52,383
Next time you people drive us
off our land, I'll find. . .

772
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:55,577
. . .some swampland so awful
maybe you'll leave us alone.

773
01:03:19,465 --> 01:03:20,580
Is that good?

774
01:03:26,305 --> 01:03:29,058
What's with the drums
and war paint and horses?

775
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:31,455
We had a lousy year.

776
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:35,300
Not much hunting. When this Russian
archduke, who gave me the bike. . .

777
01:03:36,665 --> 01:03:39,577
. . .came and wanted to see
the real West, I said, ""Okay. ""

778
01:03:39,865 --> 01:03:41,014
He pays well.

779
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:46,938
We get dressed up in war paint
and whoop around like idiots.

780
01:03:47,265 --> 01:03:50,496
He wants me to speak like
they say in books: ""How, white man! ""

781
01:03:50,665 --> 01:03:52,223
You people are such assholes!

782
01:03:53,345 --> 01:03:56,064
Of course he's got to hear
the war drums all the time!

783
01:03:56,705 --> 01:03:58,024
It gets on my nerves.

784
01:03:58,185 --> 01:04:01,222
You'll move on, you'll have
the cash. What's eating you?

785
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:07,415
I don't have the $1 ,000 I owe you.

786
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:09,541
I knew you'd say that.

787
01:04:09,705 --> 01:04:13,664
I'm sorry. You'll get it as soon
as I change my rubles into dollars.

788
01:04:13,825 --> 01:04:16,862
When will that be? The big game's
only a few days away.

789
01:04:17,065 --> 01:04:20,899
The big game. You need $25,000
to get into that. You're crazy.

790
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,623
I know that.

791
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:26,454
I suppose I have to win
the $3,000 a day or so before.

792
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:29,344
With your $1 ,000,
I'll only need to win $2,000.

793
01:04:29,505 --> 01:04:30,460
Wait!

794
01:04:31,465 --> 01:04:35,140
You've got $22,000?

795
01:04:36,465 --> 01:04:37,420
Cash?

796
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:39,299
Not frog skins.

797
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:42,822
I've never seen $22,000.

798
01:04:43,025 --> 01:04:45,539
I've never seen 25.
This is terrible.

799
01:04:45,705 --> 01:04:46,979
Can I see it?

800
01:04:48,265 --> 01:04:49,334
Why not?

801
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,660
-Can I touch it?
-You can roll in it.

802
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:53,053
Where is it?

803
01:04:53,225 --> 01:04:54,180
Where else?

804
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:58,016
What is this stuff?

805
01:05:01,425 --> 01:05:03,143
-Very funny.
-What?

806
01:05:06,225 --> 01:05:07,499
It's newspaper!

807
01:05:12,425 --> 01:05:14,700
You all right? Was it the food?

808
01:05:15,825 --> 01:05:17,736
I'll kill her!

809
01:05:17,905 --> 01:05:18,860
Annabelle!

810
01:05:19,825 --> 01:05:23,500
How could she rob me when I was
going off to face my doom?

811
01:05:23,665 --> 01:05:26,384
You were going to cut my hands off
and she robbed me!

812
01:05:27,545 --> 01:05:29,456
Pull yourself together!

813
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:30,694
Everyone's looking.

814
01:05:32,025 --> 01:05:35,222
I got your money. Just wanted
to see how you'd react.

815
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:37,263
I was just teasing.

816
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:44,655
Teasing?
I don't like being teased.

817
01:05:45,585 --> 01:05:48,497
I'll kill you!
You'll be dead and I'll be happy.

818
01:05:49,105 --> 01:05:50,697
Did you say, ""dead""?

819
01:05:53,425 --> 01:05:55,143
I just got an idea.

820
01:06:27,665 --> 01:06:29,098
Big asshole.

821
01:06:43,025 --> 01:06:43,935
How, white man!

822
01:06:44,265 --> 01:06:47,496
Hello, Noble Savage.
I've had a terrible day.

823
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:50,014
I kill every animal in sight. . .

824
01:06:50,185 --> 01:06:52,415
. . .and it's boring me. Boring.

825
01:06:52,905 --> 01:06:57,581
Maybe His Largeness be interested
in greatest Western thrill of all.

826
01:06:58,705 --> 01:06:59,979
What is it?

827
01:07:00,785 --> 01:07:02,218
Come, come!

828
01:07:12,425 --> 01:07:14,336
What is best Western thrill?

829
01:07:16,785 --> 01:07:18,013
Kill lnjun.

830
01:07:20,265 --> 01:07:21,664
Is it legal?

831
01:07:21,825 --> 01:07:25,215
White man been doing it for years
but much wampum needed.

832
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:29,534
How much?

833
01:07:30,985 --> 01:07:32,259
One thousand.

834
01:07:33,265 --> 01:07:34,618
One thousand?

835
01:07:34,825 --> 01:07:37,544
Would not have to tie him?
That wouldn't be sporting.

836
01:07:37,745 --> 01:07:39,656
No, he'll lose, but easy hit.

837
01:07:39,985 --> 01:07:42,704
Dying anyway.
Smoke too much tobacco.

838
01:07:43,665 --> 01:07:45,178
Put out of misery.

839
01:07:45,385 --> 01:07:46,181
Deal?

840
01:07:46,385 --> 01:07:47,101
Deal.

841
01:07:50,185 --> 01:07:52,574
Me go find and give him courage.

842
01:07:53,265 --> 01:07:56,098
Indian law say death private thing.
You wait here.

843
01:08:05,745 --> 01:08:08,418
Well, who else?
Did you fix his gun?

844
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,382
He wouldn't let go of it.

845
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,900
Great!
What's in it for me if I die?

846
01:08:13,905 --> 01:08:15,782
I got him up to $500.

847
01:08:17,265 --> 01:08:18,823
Worth the risk.

848
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:19,775
$250 each.

849
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:23,583
I'm the one taking all the risk.
Why do you need $250?

850
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:27,017
So, Arch!

851
01:08:27,425 --> 01:08:28,380
Look sick.

852
01:08:32,465 --> 01:08:34,057
Tell him to run.

853
01:08:35,305 --> 01:08:36,055
Wrong!

854
01:08:36,265 --> 01:08:38,654
Why?
I don't want to lose the light.

855
01:08:38,945 --> 01:08:43,461
Indian shot by white man's weapon
not reach happy hunting ground.

856
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:46,020
Indian die by lndian way.

857
01:08:46,385 --> 01:08:48,945
I never used one of those.
Never!

858
01:08:50,665 --> 01:08:52,098
Real easy, see?

859
01:09:11,185 --> 01:09:15,781
No wonder you people were
so easy to conquer. Give me it!

860
01:09:16,425 --> 01:09:17,858
$2,000.

861
01:09:20,425 --> 01:09:22,177
$2,000. Give me that.

862
01:09:25,905 --> 01:09:27,304
Come, come!

863
01:09:33,345 --> 01:09:34,141
Shit!

864
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,938
I killed him.

865
01:09:42,025 --> 01:09:44,095
I really killed him!

866
01:09:46,825 --> 01:09:49,020
Will you leave him
for the vultures?

867
01:09:50,705 --> 01:09:54,664
Never liked him much anyway.
Come, we get the money now.

868
01:10:04,105 --> 01:10:05,379
Partner, we did it!

869
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:09,379
We did it. Yeah, we did it.

870
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:11,496
He could have killed me.

871
01:10:11,665 --> 01:10:16,136
-Arrows missing, bullets whizzing--
-We had to make it look real.

872
01:10:16,305 --> 01:10:19,024
Real? You knew
he'd miss me by this much!

873
01:10:19,185 --> 01:10:20,743
-Shoot this.
-You shoot it.

874
01:10:20,945 --> 01:10:22,060
I'll show you something.

875
01:10:22,665 --> 01:10:24,940
I'll give you
a 5-second head start.

876
01:10:25,105 --> 01:10:27,414
I saved your life!

877
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:29,377
Shoot it. I'll show you.

878
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:37,575
-That's not funny.
-Hurts, doesn't it?

879
01:10:37,865 --> 01:10:41,540
Anybody who shoots my bow
can't use their hand for half a day.

880
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:47,105
And fresh from the mint.
All yours. You earned it.

881
01:10:48,545 --> 01:10:50,820
I'd kiss you, but there's people.

882
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:52,259
Don't do that.

883
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:55,620
Guess you'll go.

884
01:10:56,945 --> 01:10:58,856
How will I explain I got away. . .

885
01:10:59,025 --> 01:11:01,061
. . .with my hands still attached?

886
01:11:01,425 --> 01:11:05,213
Tell them you got us all drunk
and escaped in the confusion.

887
01:11:05,385 --> 01:11:07,774
Nobody'll believe that.
It's stupid.

888
01:11:07,985 --> 01:11:11,295
You people believe anything.
Besides, that's not $500.

889
01:11:11,465 --> 01:11:12,261
What is it?

890
01:11:12,425 --> 01:11:14,985
I got the big dunce up to $1 ,000.

891
01:11:15,145 --> 01:11:16,624
From $500 to $1 ,000?

892
01:11:16,785 --> 01:11:19,936
-Who's the best?
-He would've gone for $2,000.

893
01:11:20,105 --> 01:11:22,175
That's pushing it, really.

894
01:11:22,545 --> 01:11:24,740
All I need now is another $2,000.

895
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:26,020
You'll win it soon.

896
01:11:26,225 --> 01:11:28,420
With my luck,
I'll lose this thousand.

897
01:11:29,065 --> 01:11:31,021
Hey, hey, what's this?

898
01:11:31,345 --> 01:11:33,654
You insult me by counting it?

899
01:11:36,145 --> 01:11:40,775
I'm sorry Joseph, but lately,
my friends, even my close friends. . .

900
01:11:40,945 --> 01:11:42,344
. . .have stiffed me.

901
01:11:43,185 --> 01:11:45,858
Hey, Mav. What are friends for?

902
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:52,260
It's all there?

903
01:11:57,665 --> 01:11:59,940
I had to hot-foot it out of there...

904
01:12:00,105 --> 01:12:03,256
...as it wouldb 't be lobg
before Joseph had a scheme...

905
01:12:03,425 --> 01:12:06,656
... to help me reibvest
my bewly-acquired thousabd.

906
01:12:11,945 --> 01:12:13,014
Goodbye, Bert.

907
01:12:13,225 --> 01:12:15,898
The $2,000 wasb 't the obly thibg
I was short ob.

908
01:12:16,305 --> 01:12:18,694
I was really gettibg short ob time.

909
01:13:14,785 --> 01:13:17,345
Should've paid your cowhands
a little more.

910
01:13:17,505 --> 01:13:20,065
Lucky for you,
I don't mind being made a fool of.

911
01:13:20,225 --> 01:13:24,537
If you hadn't done what you did,
I might've let you live.

912
01:13:30,825 --> 01:13:32,463
But now I won't.

913
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:39,982
It occurred to me, before I
blacked out, he might be teasibg.

914
01:13:41,825 --> 01:13:43,417
Theb agaib...

915
01:13:43,905 --> 01:13:44,860
...maybe bot.

916
01:13:57,865 --> 01:14:00,538
That's enough, Lord.
I've found humility.

917
01:14:01,865 --> 01:14:05,221
If you could get me out of this,
I don't mean to be. . .

918
01:14:06,025 --> 01:14:07,777
. . .too presumptuous, but. . . .

919
01:14:23,985 --> 01:14:25,384
Thank you, Lord.

920
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:27,456
All right, Ollie.
You can stop now.

921
01:14:27,985 --> 01:14:29,703
Ollie, you can stop.

922
01:14:33,025 --> 01:14:35,095
You can stop. Thattaboy.

923
01:15:03,305 --> 01:15:05,102
Don't go, Ollie!

924
01:15:06,185 --> 01:15:07,095
Stay there.

925
01:15:13,225 --> 01:15:14,863
No, don't run!

926
01:15:53,225 --> 01:15:55,455
Bret Maverick! Look at you.

927
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:57,377
My hero's alive and well.

928
01:15:57,545 --> 01:15:58,614
You seem happy.

929
01:15:58,785 --> 01:16:00,059
Well, I am.

930
01:16:00,745 --> 01:16:03,418
How ever did you escape
from those hostiles?

931
01:16:06,825 --> 01:16:09,544
I'm not exactly
a whole man anymore.

932
01:16:27,945 --> 01:16:30,937
My beautiful, beautiful,
perfect male.

933
01:16:31,945 --> 01:16:34,300
I don't want to seem forward, but. . .

934
01:16:34,665 --> 01:16:37,338
. . .I wonder,
could you loan me $4,000?

935
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:42,135
I've only been able to break even
at the poker tables these days.

936
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:45,056
That means you can't enter.

937
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:49,218
If it was within my power, I'd give
you that money in a heartbeat.

938
01:16:49,385 --> 01:16:51,740
The problem is,
I'm $2,000 short myself.

939
01:16:51,905 --> 01:16:53,224
And my poor, pure heart. . .

940
01:16:53,465 --> 01:16:55,103
. . .was just set on it.

941
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,815
This wine is for peasants!

942
01:17:03,465 --> 01:17:06,138
Well, set on this, Mrs. Bransford.

943
01:17:08,745 --> 01:17:11,942
Just stay as pure as you are
right now and I'll be back soon.

944
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:19,499
Hunting savages,
isn't that dangerous?

945
01:17:19,665 --> 01:17:20,939
It's primitive. . .

946
01:17:21,065 --> 01:17:22,703
. . .but I like killing.

947
01:17:22,865 --> 01:17:25,254
Excuse me,
but may I speak with you?

948
01:17:25,425 --> 01:17:27,143
Do you know who I am?

949
01:17:27,305 --> 01:17:30,183
No, but I do know who I am.
Maverick, lndian Affairs.

950
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:38,177
It's over for you.

951
01:17:38,345 --> 01:17:39,300
Joseph talked.

952
01:17:39,985 --> 01:17:42,374
I know no one with that name.

953
01:17:42,545 --> 01:17:46,982
That's what he said about you when
I started investigating the murder.

954
01:17:47,625 --> 01:17:50,537
But once in jail, he told the truth,
and so will you.

955
01:17:50,705 --> 01:17:52,741
But, I no American.

956
01:17:52,945 --> 01:17:54,856
Murder's murder, Dukey.

957
01:17:55,305 --> 01:17:57,944
You face at least 1 0 years in jail
and a $6,000 fine.

958
01:17:59,305 --> 01:18:00,738
Six? Wait, wait!

959
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,942
I have 6,000. Help me.

960
01:18:05,225 --> 01:18:08,740
Do you know the penalty for bribing
an lndian Affairs official?

961
01:18:08,945 --> 01:18:10,856
No, please, I'm going home.

962
01:18:10,985 --> 01:18:12,304
Take the 6. Fix it.

963
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,663
-Please, take!
-All right.

964
01:18:14,825 --> 01:18:17,544
The courts are overworked.
I'll give you a break.

965
01:18:18,665 --> 01:18:20,417
Don't shoot any more lndians.

966
01:18:28,785 --> 01:18:31,015
Excuse me,
has there been an accident?

967
01:18:31,145 --> 01:18:32,737
Can I speak with you?

968
01:18:33,065 --> 01:18:34,339
Excuse me, gentlemen.

969
01:18:34,705 --> 01:18:36,616
Good luck, Miss Annabelle.

970
01:18:38,185 --> 01:18:40,141
I got something to show you.

971
01:18:42,665 --> 01:18:44,257
Close your eyes.

972
01:18:47,825 --> 01:18:49,099
You're in the game.

973
01:18:50,545 --> 01:18:51,819
I'm in the game!

974
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:53,853
Best be quiet.

975
01:18:54,065 --> 01:18:55,134
Your goodness has no end?

976
01:18:55,345 --> 01:18:56,778
Apparently not.

977
01:18:57,545 --> 01:19:00,901
Heaven will kiss you for this one,
Mr. Maverick.

978
01:19:02,385 --> 01:19:04,296
I just realized something.

979
01:19:06,865 --> 01:19:08,742
You can't help it, can you?

980
01:19:10,385 --> 01:19:12,137
You are irresistible.

981
01:19:16,945 --> 01:19:21,382
Now if by some small chance you
happen to win, I'll expect my 50% .

982
01:19:21,745 --> 01:19:24,623
Then I'll be expecting
my 50% of your winnings.

983
01:19:26,025 --> 01:19:28,414
Perhaps we should
consider that a loan.

984
01:19:58,945 --> 01:20:00,139
Let him go!

985
01:20:06,065 --> 01:20:07,134
How'd you get here?

986
01:20:07,465 --> 01:20:08,454
Tell me.

987
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,377
No, you tell me.

988
01:20:10,985 --> 01:20:14,057
Why did you say you'd never let me
make it to this game?

989
01:20:14,545 --> 01:20:15,773
Who's trying to stop me?

990
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:19,618
It's going to be a pleasure
playing you again.

991
01:20:20,465 --> 01:20:22,376
Well, the pleasure's all yours.

992
01:20:23,305 --> 01:20:24,135
Come on.

993
01:20:49,385 --> 01:20:50,261
Hit it!

994
01:20:54,545 --> 01:20:56,297
Welcome to my ship. . .

995
01:20:56,465 --> 01:20:57,864
. . .the Lauren Belle.

996
01:20:58,945 --> 01:21:01,015
And welcome to the first Annual. . .

997
01:21:01,185 --> 01:21:03,255
. . .All River's
Draw Poker Championship.

998
01:21:07,825 --> 01:21:09,224
Rules are simple.

999
01:21:09,505 --> 01:21:11,735
We play till we drop.
Winner takes all.

1000
01:21:11,905 --> 01:21:14,294
The dealer can call one break
of one hour.

1001
01:21:14,505 --> 01:21:16,097
If you bust, you're gone.

1002
01:21:18,145 --> 01:21:20,375
20 players means
there's going to be. . .

1003
01:21:20,545 --> 01:21:21,819
. . . 1 9 broken hearts.

1004
01:21:23,425 --> 01:21:25,939
Let's make it a great contest.

1005
01:21:26,145 --> 01:21:28,215
An honest, great contest.

1006
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:29,494
For that reason. . .

1007
01:21:29,665 --> 01:21:33,658
. . .I've imported one of the West's
most remarkable lawmen.

1008
01:21:34,465 --> 01:21:36,217
Marshal Zane Cooper.

1009
01:21:36,385 --> 01:21:37,704
He'll run things.

1010
01:21:40,225 --> 01:21:41,863
Come on up here, Coop.

1011
01:21:47,145 --> 01:21:48,544
Thank you, Commodore.

1012
01:21:49,185 --> 01:21:51,938
Now players,
anyone caught cheating. . .

1013
01:21:52,225 --> 01:21:54,978
. . .will forfeit his entry fee
and be banned.

1014
01:21:55,145 --> 01:21:56,419
See these?

1015
01:21:57,465 --> 01:21:59,376
They're the only two allowed here.

1016
01:21:59,505 --> 01:22:00,824
Anyone breaking rules. . .

1017
01:22:01,785 --> 01:22:03,980
. . .better be a faster draw than me.

1018
01:22:04,305 --> 01:22:06,216
And better learn how to swim.

1019
01:22:11,665 --> 01:22:12,939
Thank you, sir.

1020
01:22:16,025 --> 01:22:19,495
All right, gamblers, step right up
and bring your money.

1021
01:22:21,105 --> 01:22:22,094
After you.

1022
01:22:24,145 --> 01:22:25,294
$25,000.

1023
01:22:25,425 --> 01:22:27,063
That's correct. Here.

1024
01:22:27,225 --> 01:22:28,977
Make your mark right here.

1025
01:22:30,065 --> 01:22:30,861
Thank you, sir.

1026
01:22:33,105 --> 01:22:34,220
Make your mark.

1027
01:22:34,425 --> 01:22:35,653
Good luck to you.

1028
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:37,460
Here.

1029
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:39,024
I'll take good care of it.

1030
01:22:41,465 --> 01:22:42,580
Count that.

1031
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:45,774
It's all there.

1032
01:22:45,945 --> 01:22:47,378
I'm sure it is.

1033
01:22:58,585 --> 01:23:01,099
The games will begin in 1 0 minutes.

1034
01:23:03,025 --> 01:23:06,904
Ladies and gentlemen, if we had
$25,000 more in this satchel. . .

1035
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:10,535
. . .we'd have a full half-million.
We're minus one entry fee.

1036
01:23:11,025 --> 01:23:12,822
I believe it's yours.

1037
01:23:19,545 --> 01:23:21,456
Do I need to count it?

1038
01:23:23,505 --> 01:23:25,257
I don't think so.

1039
01:23:26,385 --> 01:23:27,534
Even half-million.

1040
01:23:30,385 --> 01:23:33,775
This safe was brought in specially
for this contest.

1041
01:23:33,945 --> 01:23:37,904
I selected the combination.
I'm the only one that knows it.

1042
01:23:38,545 --> 01:23:41,742
Commodore, the money's as protected
as I can make it.

1043
01:23:42,905 --> 01:23:44,463
There it is.

1044
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:45,774
Gamblers. . .

1045
01:23:45,945 --> 01:23:49,460
. . .find your designated table
and let's play some poker!

1046
01:24:48,785 --> 01:24:50,104
Five thousand.

1047
01:25:11,985 --> 01:25:12,622
My pot.

1048
01:25:22,705 --> 01:25:23,694
I'll call you.

1049
01:25:24,665 --> 01:25:25,780
Gentlemen. . .

1050
01:25:26,225 --> 01:25:27,658
. . .four kings.

1051
01:25:30,105 --> 01:25:32,175
All right, young man. Let's go.

1052
01:25:32,345 --> 01:25:33,141
Hold on.

1053
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:36,938
Cheating bastard!

1054
01:25:37,105 --> 01:25:39,335
Sit down! I'll handle this.

1055
01:25:39,505 --> 01:25:41,143
I knew it was him!

1056
01:25:41,265 --> 01:25:42,823
Don't touch my chips!

1057
01:25:54,265 --> 01:25:55,334
Wait a second!

1058
01:25:55,665 --> 01:25:57,576
Where are you taking me?

1059
01:25:57,745 --> 01:25:59,656
I can't swim!

1060
01:26:06,345 --> 01:26:07,903
Gentlemen, my pleasure.

1061
01:26:15,465 --> 01:26:17,660
Kings over tens, gentlemen.

1062
01:26:20,545 --> 01:26:24,697
Time to go for a swim.
Divide the chips among the players.

1063
01:26:25,065 --> 01:26:26,464
You son of a bitch!

1064
01:26:28,705 --> 01:26:30,138
Sorry, old-timer, that's it.

1065
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,936
If you don't mind.

1066
01:26:39,585 --> 01:26:42,463
-At your pleasure.
-Thank you, Mr. Coop.

1067
01:26:54,505 --> 01:26:55,733
Thank you, gentlemen.

1068
01:27:04,585 --> 01:27:06,177
Good game, Hightower.

1069
01:27:06,465 --> 01:27:08,103
Hightower retires.

1070
01:27:19,265 --> 01:27:20,584
Four queens.

1071
01:27:25,985 --> 01:27:27,418
Congratulations.

1072
01:27:28,065 --> 01:27:31,421
Chips'll be waiting at the main
table. Good luck in the final game.

1073
01:27:37,545 --> 01:27:38,660
Full house.

1074
01:27:38,825 --> 01:27:40,224
That's a good hand.

1075
01:27:40,385 --> 01:27:41,818
That beats one. . .

1076
01:27:42,505 --> 01:27:43,620
. . .two. . .

1077
01:27:44,065 --> 01:27:45,703
. . .three sevens.

1078
01:27:46,505 --> 01:27:47,904
But not four.

1079
01:27:54,465 --> 01:27:56,535
Why don't you get a drink?

1080
01:27:56,705 --> 01:27:59,265
You'll feel better
if you get fresh air.

1081
01:28:00,745 --> 01:28:02,019
Watch your step.

1082
01:28:08,265 --> 01:28:10,654
I hate those sad losers.

1083
01:28:10,825 --> 01:28:12,861
Don't play if you can't afford it.

1084
01:28:13,105 --> 01:28:14,379
How's it look?

1085
01:28:14,545 --> 01:28:17,264
It looks like you,
Mrs. Bransford, the Spaniard. . .

1086
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:20,462
. . .and, unless a miracle happens,
Maverick.

1087
01:28:23,345 --> 01:28:26,223
When it's decided,
call a break for an hour. . .

1088
01:28:29,585 --> 01:28:31,815
. . .and let's set it up
at that table.

1089
01:28:33,185 --> 01:28:36,461
I was going to leave you something,
but I'm cleaned out.

1090
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:38,343
You're a hell of a player.

1091
01:28:38,505 --> 01:28:40,257
It's the most I enjoyed losing.

1092
01:28:45,745 --> 01:28:47,144
That's for you.

1093
01:28:48,625 --> 01:28:53,221
Congratulations. I'll see that your
chips are set up for the next game.

1094
01:29:29,425 --> 01:29:30,778
Good luck to you, son.

1095
01:29:32,945 --> 01:29:37,097
Leave your chips here, I'll get them
transferred to the final game.

1096
01:29:38,065 --> 01:29:39,293
Congratulations.

1097
01:29:48,745 --> 01:29:51,498
The players can take
a one hour break.

1098
01:29:51,665 --> 01:29:54,543
Players not back in their seat
at the stroke of five. . .

1099
01:29:54,705 --> 01:29:56,024
. . .forfeit their winnings.

1100
01:30:17,705 --> 01:30:18,660
Good morning.

1101
01:30:28,265 --> 01:30:29,220
Sorry.

1102
01:31:02,065 --> 01:31:03,657
30 minutes, everybody.

1103
01:31:04,585 --> 01:31:06,655
30 minutes to the final game.

1104
01:31:14,025 --> 01:31:15,822
He's a good 4 minutes fast.

1105
01:31:20,105 --> 01:31:21,538
Positions, sir?

1106
01:31:21,705 --> 01:31:24,265
Dealer over there.
Give me the cards.

1107
01:31:28,305 --> 01:31:30,500
1 5 minutes, everybody.

1108
01:31:30,665 --> 01:31:32,576
1 5 minutes to the final game.

1109
01:31:32,785 --> 01:31:34,696
Maybe we better get serious.

1110
01:31:37,105 --> 01:31:39,016
I've got it, if you don't mind.

1111
01:31:39,185 --> 01:31:41,574
We have rules about that
on board ship.

1112
01:31:41,745 --> 01:31:43,019
That's my gun.

1113
01:31:43,145 --> 01:31:44,942
-It's your gun?
-Yeah, it's mine.

1114
01:31:45,065 --> 01:31:46,180
Do you swim?

1115
01:31:46,665 --> 01:31:49,099
No. But she does and it's her gun.

1116
01:31:49,265 --> 01:31:50,539
And this one?

1117
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:52,616
-Is this hers too?
-I'm carrying it for her.

1118
01:31:53,105 --> 01:31:54,663
-Is this your husband?
-What?

1119
01:31:54,865 --> 01:31:57,538
-How about a little boat?
-A little boat?

1120
01:32:29,625 --> 01:32:33,777
Mrs. Bransford, you look ravishing
for five in the morning.

1121
01:32:33,945 --> 01:32:37,142
Nice glow about you.
Five minutes, Mr. Maverick!

1122
01:33:31,145 --> 01:33:32,260
Dealer. . .

1123
01:33:32,785 --> 01:33:36,460
. . .start dividing up Maverick's
chips. Looks like he's a no-show.

1124
01:33:36,625 --> 01:33:37,421
Yes, sir.

1125
01:34:10,305 --> 01:34:11,021
Wait!

1126
01:34:27,385 --> 01:34:30,218
All right, dealer.
You can start the game.

1127
01:34:30,545 --> 01:34:31,660
Ante up.

1128
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:46,695
A thousand and two more.

1129
01:34:49,025 --> 01:34:50,936
I'll see your $2,000. . . .

1130
01:34:52,865 --> 01:34:54,856
Can I bid everything I have?

1131
01:34:58,065 --> 01:35:00,135
That'll be $1 2,000.

1132
01:35:03,825 --> 01:35:05,338
Too rich for my blood.

1133
01:35:05,505 --> 01:35:06,620
I'm out.

1134
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,218
I feel like being silly.

1135
01:35:12,385 --> 01:35:13,659
I'll call.

1136
01:35:18,705 --> 01:35:20,536
It's just a pair of sixes.

1137
01:35:21,265 --> 01:35:23,825
If you can beat that,
then I'm licked.

1138
01:35:24,705 --> 01:35:26,775
Not a totally unpleasant prospect.

1139
01:35:31,345 --> 01:35:32,937
I'm out of the game.

1140
01:35:34,225 --> 01:35:35,658
I'm out.

1141
01:35:36,065 --> 01:35:37,464
You put me out.

1142
01:35:38,225 --> 01:35:39,180
I did.

1143
01:35:39,345 --> 01:35:41,176
I didn't do any of my tells.

1144
01:35:41,425 --> 01:35:43,575
I didn't twirl my hair
or flick my teeth.

1145
01:35:45,425 --> 01:35:46,460
You held your breath.

1146
01:35:47,665 --> 01:35:48,780
No, I wasn't.

1147
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:52,217
Did I hold it?

1148
01:35:52,545 --> 01:35:53,261
Did l?

1149
01:35:54,465 --> 01:35:55,659
Did l?

1150
01:35:55,985 --> 01:35:56,940
See?

1151
01:35:57,665 --> 01:35:58,620
Sorry.

1152
01:35:58,785 --> 01:36:00,059
See, usually. . .

1153
01:36:00,345 --> 01:36:03,098
. . .when you get excited,
you breathe heavily.

1154
01:36:03,265 --> 01:36:04,414
How do you. . . .

1155
01:36:10,385 --> 01:36:14,139
I'll just pretend I was playing
with somebody else's money.

1156
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:16,297
That shouldn't be hard.

1157
01:36:20,305 --> 01:36:22,773
You did hold your breath.

1158
01:36:22,945 --> 01:36:24,060
Ante up.

1159
01:37:30,065 --> 01:37:31,259
It's up to you to open.

1160
01:37:33,105 --> 01:37:34,458
I'll open for $5,000.

1161
01:37:39,025 --> 01:37:40,538
I'll see your 5. . .

1162
01:37:41,865 --> 01:37:43,093
. . .and raise you 5.

1163
01:37:43,345 --> 01:37:44,698
1 0,000 to you.

1164
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:46,060
Call.

1165
01:37:46,945 --> 01:37:48,776
And 5 for me.

1166
01:37:51,185 --> 01:37:51,822
Cards?

1167
01:37:53,105 --> 01:37:54,538
Two cards, please.

1168
01:37:58,465 --> 01:37:59,420
Sir?

1169
01:37:59,985 --> 01:38:00,781
Two.

1170
01:38:37,185 --> 01:38:38,777
One card, but not from you.

1171
01:38:38,905 --> 01:38:40,304
Put the deck down.

1172
01:38:43,465 --> 01:38:46,218
I'd like a new deck,
new cut and a new shuffle.

1173
01:38:46,385 --> 01:38:48,455
I'm sorry, that isn't permitted.

1174
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:50,855
But you can have a new dealer.

1175
01:38:53,665 --> 01:38:56,543
In that case, I'd like you to deal.

1176
01:38:57,985 --> 01:38:59,657
Just one from the top.

1177
01:39:01,905 --> 01:39:03,224
I like that.

1178
01:39:04,385 --> 01:39:05,056
Shows trust.

1179
01:39:19,585 --> 01:39:23,578
The Commodore has four of a kind,
Angel has a small straight flush. . .

1180
01:39:23,745 --> 01:39:25,895
. . .and I don't know
what Maverick has.

1181
01:39:28,145 --> 01:39:29,578
It's up to you.

1182
01:39:31,585 --> 01:39:35,021
It looks like I'm sucking hind tit,
so I'll bet everything.

1183
01:39:37,105 --> 01:39:39,573
The Commodore wagers $25,000.

1184
01:39:48,145 --> 01:39:49,897
I'll see your 25.

1185
01:39:52,785 --> 01:39:54,298
I guess we're even.

1186
01:39:56,665 --> 01:39:59,498
I'll raise you everything I've got.

1187
01:40:03,185 --> 01:40:05,096
That's half a million to the winner.

1188
01:40:13,705 --> 01:40:15,343
That should cover the Commodore.

1189
01:40:17,505 --> 01:40:19,177
You gonna look at your card?

1190
01:40:19,825 --> 01:40:20,940
No need.

1191
01:40:21,185 --> 01:40:22,698
What are you playing at?

1192
01:40:22,905 --> 01:40:23,781
Look at it.

1193
01:40:24,465 --> 01:40:26,933
I'd look at my card
if I were you.

1194
01:40:27,385 --> 01:40:29,103
This is your portion of the pot.

1195
01:40:30,705 --> 01:40:33,663
What kind of poker you playing?
Look at that card!

1196
01:40:38,305 --> 01:40:41,422
Cards have been called, Commodore.
Show your cards.

1197
01:40:45,185 --> 01:40:47,255
I have two small pair.

1198
01:40:49,985 --> 01:40:51,338
Eights. . .

1199
01:40:52,385 --> 01:40:53,500
. . .and eights.

1200
01:41:00,385 --> 01:41:01,500
Thank you.

1201
01:41:08,665 --> 01:41:10,303
Not going to look?

1202
01:41:20,785 --> 01:41:23,902
How you gonna know if
you can beat my straight flush?

1203
01:41:42,865 --> 01:41:44,378
Ten of spades.

1204
01:41:44,625 --> 01:41:45,978
Jack of spades.

1205
01:41:46,625 --> 01:41:47,740
Queen of spades.

1206
01:41:48,625 --> 01:41:49,501
King of spades.

1207
01:41:50,905 --> 01:41:52,179
Possible royal flush.

1208
01:41:55,425 --> 01:41:57,177
Quiet! Quiet!

1209
01:42:55,665 --> 01:42:56,541
You won!

1210
01:42:57,745 --> 01:42:59,895
You cheating son of a bitch!

1211
01:43:24,745 --> 01:43:25,860
You all right?

1212
01:43:26,185 --> 01:43:27,937
I can't believe
I pulled that card.

1213
01:43:28,105 --> 01:43:30,699
Did I ever tell you
about the desert?

1214
01:43:30,865 --> 01:43:32,298
You're babbling.

1215
01:43:35,905 --> 01:43:37,896
Your security isn't worth a damn!

1216
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:40,295
Everybody's got a gun!

1217
01:43:54,745 --> 01:43:55,860
Ladies and gents. . .

1218
01:43:56,105 --> 01:44:00,383
. . .for our presentation of one-half
million dollars to our winner. . .

1219
01:44:00,705 --> 01:44:02,297
. . .Mr. Maverick!

1220
01:44:07,985 --> 01:44:11,819
I want to congratulate you
on a game well played.

1221
01:44:12,385 --> 01:44:14,615
I wish your moment
could last longer. . .

1222
01:44:14,785 --> 01:44:17,015
. . .but I see all this money
and I just. . .

1223
01:44:17,185 --> 01:44:18,618
. . .gotta take it.

1224
01:44:20,465 --> 01:44:24,777
I'll have regrets, I'm sure, but
I'm going to take it nevertheless.

1225
01:44:24,945 --> 01:44:26,776
Move down the steps.

1226
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:32,934
This is no time to be brave, Bert.

1227
01:44:33,105 --> 01:44:35,255
Down the stairs, now.

1228
01:44:35,905 --> 01:44:37,896
You too, Commodore.

1229
01:44:38,385 --> 01:44:40,216
-I'll take your bag.
-Get your hands off.

1230
01:44:40,465 --> 01:44:42,262
Get away from here!

1231
01:44:42,465 --> 01:44:44,103
Down the stairs. Move!

1232
01:44:44,345 --> 01:44:45,903
You son of a bitch.

1233
01:44:46,065 --> 01:44:48,943
I worked my ass off for that money.
I'll be coming for it.

1234
01:44:49,665 --> 01:44:50,700
I'll look for you.

1235
01:44:50,905 --> 01:44:52,133
Look real hard!

1236
01:44:52,305 --> 01:44:54,773
-That's my money.
-Was your money.

1237
01:45:00,785 --> 01:45:03,857
I don't want to see any faces
looking this way.

1238
01:45:08,145 --> 01:45:09,498
Get my gun.

1239
01:45:12,305 --> 01:45:13,977
He's headed for the lifeboat.

1240
01:45:14,145 --> 01:45:15,100
Stop him!

1241
01:45:17,025 --> 01:45:17,821
Move!

1242
01:45:17,985 --> 01:45:19,577
I'll kill that son of a bitch!

1243
01:45:40,945 --> 01:45:42,219
There he is.

1244
01:45:42,625 --> 01:45:43,819
Let him go!

1245
01:45:43,985 --> 01:45:46,101
-Let him go?!
-The man saved my life!

1246
01:45:47,785 --> 01:45:49,184
I can always win more money.

1247
01:45:49,345 --> 01:45:52,382
Anyway, I found out
what I came here for.

1248
01:45:52,705 --> 01:45:57,096
I remind you there's $500,000 in
that satchel that bastard's taking!

1249
01:45:57,265 --> 01:46:00,063
It grieves me,
but it's my half million.

1250
01:46:00,905 --> 01:46:02,054
It's only money, right?

1251
01:46:02,385 --> 01:46:03,579
Right!

1252
01:46:04,865 --> 01:46:07,425
-Only money?!
-It's not worth killing a man.

1253
01:46:09,505 --> 01:46:12,303
I won't swear out
a warrant against him.

1254
01:46:12,625 --> 01:46:14,377
I'll be damned!

1255
01:46:16,465 --> 01:46:18,535
I will be damned!

1256
01:46:20,025 --> 01:46:21,822
Let's toast our champion.

1257
01:46:22,945 --> 01:46:24,458
Our champion!

1258
01:47:09,345 --> 01:47:12,223
I meant to give you this.
I took it from you on the stage.

1259
01:47:12,385 --> 01:47:14,216
You should have it.

1260
01:47:15,705 --> 01:47:17,980
I meant to give you this cufflink. . .

1261
01:47:18,145 --> 01:47:19,976
. . .I took before you left
with the lndians.

1262
01:47:20,145 --> 01:47:21,578
I been looking for it.

1263
01:47:43,505 --> 01:47:44,779
Will you miss me?

1264
01:47:45,585 --> 01:47:47,257
Will you miss me?

1265
01:47:48,945 --> 01:47:50,617
You are going to miss me.

1266
01:47:52,865 --> 01:47:54,901
-How do you know?
-You were holding your breath.

1267
01:47:55,065 --> 01:47:55,895
I was not.

1268
01:48:00,225 --> 01:48:01,738
Maybe I was.

1269
01:48:25,425 --> 01:48:28,144
I guess I better go make my stage.

1270
01:48:46,305 --> 01:48:47,738
See you in Abilene.

1271
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:51,737
New Orleans, wasn't it?

1272
01:48:52,705 --> 01:48:53,820
Either.

1273
01:49:31,785 --> 01:49:33,662
Where have you been?

1274
01:49:35,905 --> 01:49:37,975
I had to say goodbye.

1275
01:49:38,145 --> 01:49:41,182
I didn't want them thinking
I was running off.

1276
01:49:41,585 --> 01:49:45,339
And I did a lot of twists and turns
and backtracked a lot. . .

1277
01:49:45,905 --> 01:49:48,055
. . .to keep anyone from following me.

1278
01:49:48,625 --> 01:49:50,855
I thought we were in this together.

1279
01:49:50,985 --> 01:49:54,455
You win, I do nothing.
Someone else wins, I do what I did.

1280
01:49:54,625 --> 01:49:57,093
You didn't tell me
Angel was in it too.

1281
01:50:00,665 --> 01:50:03,054
If Angel had won,
we'd split it the same way.

1282
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:04,704
The reason I brought him in. . .

1283
01:50:04,905 --> 01:50:08,215
. . .I telegraphed him
to keep Maverick out of the game.

1284
01:50:08,945 --> 01:50:10,617
He messed up on that.

1285
01:50:10,785 --> 01:50:12,457
Poor, dead bastard.

1286
01:50:14,785 --> 01:50:16,901
I don't like secrets.

1287
01:50:18,305 --> 01:50:20,535
You probably won't like
this one either.

1288
01:50:20,945 --> 01:50:23,982
I don't know, I guess
it's my greedy nature, but. . .

1289
01:50:24,985 --> 01:50:26,338
. . .I've decided. . .

1290
01:50:26,945 --> 01:50:28,424
. . .not to share it with you.

1291
01:50:38,865 --> 01:50:39,695
Uncock it.

1292
01:50:47,265 --> 01:50:48,857
Sit down, gentlemen.

1293
01:50:50,865 --> 01:50:52,696
Let's get real cozy.

1294
01:50:53,025 --> 01:50:54,299
Parlay some.

1295
01:50:58,305 --> 01:50:59,738
Put your hands down!

1296
01:51:03,745 --> 01:51:05,975
I admit, you had me fooled.

1297
01:51:06,385 --> 01:51:07,420
Not many can.

1298
01:51:08,065 --> 01:51:11,501
But you did save my life. It
wouldn't be neighborly to kill you.

1299
01:51:12,145 --> 01:51:13,100
Besides. . .

1300
01:51:13,665 --> 01:51:16,304
. . .everybody knows
what you are now, anyway.

1301
01:51:16,785 --> 01:51:18,377
All your life's work. . .

1302
01:51:19,665 --> 01:51:21,576
. . .it's all been wiped away.

1303
01:51:22,305 --> 01:51:23,579
Was it worth it?

1304
01:51:24,225 --> 01:51:26,295
You got nothing to show for it.

1305
01:51:28,105 --> 01:51:29,902
What you said is true.

1306
01:51:30,065 --> 01:51:32,943
I traded every decent thing I know
for that money.

1307
01:51:33,105 --> 01:51:34,220
You can't leave me alive.

1308
01:51:34,705 --> 01:51:36,218
I don't care where you go. . .

1309
01:51:36,425 --> 01:51:38,381
. . .one night you'll relax. . .

1310
01:51:38,545 --> 01:51:39,898
. . .and I'll be waiting.

1311
01:51:43,985 --> 01:51:46,704
You couldn't sneak up
on a corpse, Coop.

1312
01:51:46,905 --> 01:51:48,224
Not anymore.

1313
01:51:48,465 --> 01:51:50,854
You're a decrepit old has-been.

1314
01:51:52,025 --> 01:51:54,619
Well, what're you going to do?

1315
01:51:54,745 --> 01:51:56,781
Maybe the fairest thing would be. . .

1316
01:51:57,265 --> 01:51:59,096
. . .Iet one of you kill the other.

1317
01:52:01,025 --> 01:52:03,016
I'll let you decide which.

1318
01:52:13,665 --> 01:52:15,576
That, as they say, is that.

1319
01:52:26,785 --> 01:52:28,457
You rotten, double-crossed. . . .

1320
01:52:28,865 --> 01:52:31,504
I've never committed
a cold-blooded murder in my life.

1321
01:52:35,345 --> 01:52:36,380
Well, I won't.

1322
01:52:38,225 --> 01:52:40,136
Not till I find Maverick.

1323
01:53:13,625 --> 01:53:17,140
Decrepit old has-been?
Couldn't sneak up on a corpse?

1324
01:53:17,465 --> 01:53:20,980
You got $500,000 in that satchel
and your gun is 8 feet away.

1325
01:53:21,225 --> 01:53:22,977
Not smart.
Not smart at all.

1326
01:53:23,785 --> 01:53:25,059
Guess not.

1327
01:53:27,945 --> 01:53:30,220
It's plain to see
who won the toss-up.

1328
01:53:30,385 --> 01:53:32,023
You shoot the Commodore
in the back?

1329
01:53:32,265 --> 01:53:34,495
No. Good idea, but no.

1330
01:53:35,705 --> 01:53:38,265
I really enjoyed
nailing that bastard.

1331
01:53:38,825 --> 01:53:40,895
No room in poker for cheats.

1332
01:53:41,225 --> 01:53:45,104
He won't be able to touch a deck of
cards, this side of the Mississippi.

1333
01:53:45,305 --> 01:53:47,694
My old pappy always used to say:

1334
01:53:47,865 --> 01:53:52,017
""There is no more deeply moving
religious experience. . .

1335
01:53:52,185 --> 01:53:54,016
. . .than cheating a cheater. ""

1336
01:53:54,185 --> 01:53:56,016
I never said that once.

1337
01:53:56,185 --> 01:53:58,335
You've misquoted me all your life.

1338
01:53:58,505 --> 01:54:01,736
-Are we quibbling over fine points?
-I'm sick of it!

1339
01:54:06,985 --> 01:54:10,819
The things you said were always
so dumb I had to improve on them.

1340
01:54:10,985 --> 01:54:12,259
Dumb, huh?

1341
01:54:13,545 --> 01:54:15,217
Cut that out, Pappy!

1342
01:54:15,385 --> 01:54:18,343
These are a buck apiece.
You brought me up to save money.

1343
01:54:18,505 --> 01:54:19,620
Give me one.

1344
01:54:20,585 --> 01:54:22,655
-Those are the good ones.
-They are?

1345
01:54:22,825 --> 01:54:24,258
You got a match?

1346
01:54:34,505 --> 01:54:36,336
Bret, Coop, everything good?

1347
01:54:36,505 --> 01:54:39,144
Enough cigars, brandy,
hot water, towels?

1348
01:54:39,305 --> 01:54:42,342
-Yell if you need anything.
-Yes, Mrs. D.

1349
01:55:00,105 --> 01:55:01,902
Certainly hope
this shirt fits you.

1350
01:55:02,065 --> 01:55:04,499
It's from the best
shirtmaker in town.

1351
01:55:06,105 --> 01:55:07,743
Isn't she sweet?

1352
01:55:07,905 --> 01:55:09,702
Hell of a shirt,
but she's robbing us.

1353
01:55:09,865 --> 01:55:14,017
Look at this. Here's a lot of money
and your gun is 6 feet away from you.

1354
01:55:14,185 --> 01:55:15,140
Eight.

1355
01:55:15,705 --> 01:55:17,696
What a remarkable family.

1356
01:55:18,105 --> 01:55:19,458
How did she figure--?

1357
01:55:19,625 --> 01:55:20,580
How'd you know?

1358
01:55:20,825 --> 01:55:23,214
You don't have
the exclusive on tells.

1359
01:55:23,385 --> 01:55:25,694
You both have
the same height and build.

1360
01:55:25,865 --> 01:55:26,980
You both. . .

1361
01:55:27,145 --> 01:55:29,454
. . .kiss the same way, you both. . .

1362
01:55:30,065 --> 01:55:33,694
. . .draw your guns alike and sing
the wrong words to ""Amazing Grace. ""

1363
01:55:33,945 --> 01:55:34,821
We do not.

1364
01:55:41,145 --> 01:55:42,214
My! Such. . .

1365
01:55:42,425 --> 01:55:44,416
. . .splendid similarities.

1366
01:55:47,785 --> 01:55:50,583
From the looks of things, the lady
better bring more hot water.

1367
01:56:08,145 --> 01:56:11,137
Bret, son, you know what
we ended up with?

1368
01:56:12,345 --> 01:56:15,018
A half-million-dollar silk shirt.

1369
01:56:16,025 --> 01:56:19,301
Nope. We ended up with a
quarter-million-dollar silk shirt. . .

1370
01:56:19,465 --> 01:56:22,263
. . .because my old pappy told me,
""When you put the cart--""

1371
01:56:22,425 --> 01:56:26,020
No. ""Don't count. . . "" No.
""Don't put your eggs in one basket. ""

1372
01:56:26,185 --> 01:56:27,777
Now that, I said.

1373
01:56:28,585 --> 01:56:31,622
-So I have a boot for you.
-A boot?

1374
01:56:33,865 --> 01:56:36,504
And the other one's
twice as heavy.

1375
01:56:39,145 --> 01:56:41,534
Oh, Bret, that's my boy!

1376
01:56:41,705 --> 01:56:43,855
What are kids for?
Give back the boot.

1377
01:56:44,025 --> 01:56:44,901
Be my guest.

1378
01:56:45,065 --> 01:56:46,100
Nice boots.

1379
01:56:47,305 --> 01:56:50,342
I don't know why I left
the other half in the satchel.

1380
01:56:50,585 --> 01:56:51,620
I do.

1381
01:56:52,025 --> 01:56:53,219
So do l.

1382
01:56:53,385 --> 01:56:55,945
It'll be lots of fun
getting it back.

1383
01:56:58,345 --> 01:56:59,300
Yes, sir?

1384
01:57:00,345 --> 01:57:02,415
Something I got to know, son.

1385
01:57:05,945 --> 01:57:08,823
How did you come up
with that ace of spades?

1386
01:57:10,265 --> 01:57:11,618
You won't believe me.

1387
01:57:11,865 --> 01:57:13,935
I'm your father,
