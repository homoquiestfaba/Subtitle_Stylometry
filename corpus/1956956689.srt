1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,752
Hurry up, you guys.

2
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:12,919
If the coastguard catches
us, we're in big trouble!

3
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,632
Hey, take it easy, old man.

4
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:19,595
There was top secret Navy
material on board the Cleveland.

5
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,260
We're going down to retrieve it.

6
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,357
We're gonna sell it,

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:26,766
and we're gonna be rich.

8
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:26,366
Paco, Jose, you've only got
three minutes of air left.

9
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,135
Paco!

10
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,435
Jose!

11
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,394
Last year, you left me to
go chasing killer whales.

12
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,851
What have you got in
mind for me this year?

13
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:40,941
This year, sailing,
tennis, discoing till dawn,

14
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,358
that sort of thing.

15
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,898
If that's all right with you.

16
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,244
Yes!

17
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,939
Something smells fishy here.

18
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:22,773
Don't worry.

19
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,029
We're just gonna go say
hi to the guys, okay?

20
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,616
Billy!

21
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,128
Hi, susy.

22
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,579
Vanessa, so you finally came back.

23
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,880
You're more beautiful than ever.

24
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,258
You're quite a little
missy yourself, susy.

25
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,794
Cookie, go home now.

26
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,954
See how well I can swim now?

27
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,035
Yes, you've really gotten quite good.

28
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,327
I had two great
teachers, cookie and Daisy.

29
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,588
Come and let me introduce you to papi.

30
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,174
It's good to have you
back here with us, Billy.

31
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,478
It was terrible.

32
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,831
When we heard about the accident,

33
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,061
we just couldn't believe it.

34
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:20,891
It's a terrible thing, all right.

35
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,977
In a split second, I lost everything.

36
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,688
I lost my wife, my will to live,

37
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,852
and most of all, susy's smile.

38
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,147
She'll never be able to walk again.

39
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,860
Fortunately, she's a strong kid.

40
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,441
And here at the aquarium, she's
found some reason to live.

41
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,261
The only time she feels like a normal kid

42
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,450
is when she's out there in the water.

43
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,269
Cookie and
Daisy only listen to her.

44
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,249
And papi, he's got a crush on her.

45
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,376
So how are things here, dag?

46
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,883
Well, the overheads are high.

47
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,179
The shows are few.

48
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,019
But the season's good
when Bob wins the regatta.

49
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,340
He should come out on top.

50
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,934
I should have a
fighting chance this year.

51
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,470
I've been training all winter.

52
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,691
Hi, dag.

53
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,694
Hi, Francis.

54
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,063
What can I do for you?

55
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,404
I'm sorry, this isn't a social call.

56
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,237
I have an order to
evict from Samuel Lewis.

57
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,448
You've gotta be outta here in 30 days.

58
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,583
I'm really sorry.

59
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,411
Yeah, well, you've always
been a good friend, sheriff.

60
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,374
And besides, 30 days is a long time.

61
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,789
A lot of things can happen.

62
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:29,626
Sure.

63
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,404
All we have to do is give
him an advance on rent

64
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,634
for the next 15 years.

65
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,329
That fat, money-grubbing bastard.

66
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,471
I'd like to rip his balls off!

67
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,766
Larry.

68
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:38,723
Don't listen to him.

69
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:39,553
He's young.

70
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,387
He's hotheaded,

71
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:41,687
that's all.

72
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,604
Hey, Billy!

73
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,479
How are you doing, sheriff?

74
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,309
Fine.

75
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,268
How's your research going?

76
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,149
Pretty good.

77
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,165
This winter, I'm sailing
on the cutty shark.

78
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,569
The cutty shark?

79
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,902
That's right, that floating
madhouse for fish freaks.

80
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,068
Scientific research, 18 months at sea.

81
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,416
Hey!

82
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,209
Ronnie!

83
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,047
Ronnie, stop.

84
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,129
Get back here.

85
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,962
- Ronnie.
- You're not quick enough.

86
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,094
Hey, why don't you go
bust somebody else's balls!

87
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,092
Go take a swim.

88
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,391
What swim?

89
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,719
They're gonna go fool around.

90
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,254
Billy, I got you down here

91
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,714
because I need your opinion on this.

92
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,938
This looks like the work of
a speedboat propeller to me.

93
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:34,646
Well, I can't say anything

94
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,010
until I take a look at it, Francis.

95
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,428
Officer, have them all move back.

96
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:37,986
Okay, move back, everybody, move back.

97
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,472
Move back, make way.

98
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,110
Coming through.

99
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,413
Move back.

100
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,006
Well, what do you think?

101
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:57,419
In my opinion, it wasn't
a speedboat propeller.

102
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,178
Then what was it?

103
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,884
It could have been a shark.

104
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,264
A shark, and it did that?

105
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,765
At least that's what I think.

106
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,626
I say a shark, but it could have been a,

107
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,356
it could have been a killer whale.

108
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,768
Billy, I need a precise answer here.

109
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,673
Francis, these remains
have been in the water

110
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,732
for more than 24 hours.

111
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,648
There's no saying how many
fish have been feeding on it.

112
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,739
An autopsy's the only way you're
gonna get a precise answer.

113
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,775
Jesus!

114
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,654
Oh, my god.

115
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,692
So what do you see, Rick?

116
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,536
Not even the propeller

117
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,827
of a trans-Atlantic ocean
liner could do this.

118
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,580
It was a shark all right, and a big one.

119
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,707
Are you all out of your minds?

120
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,505
Sheriff, for heaven's sake,

121
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,338
let's not go off on a
wild goose chase here.

122
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,637
It happens.

123
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,426
People die now and then under
unfortunate circumstances.

124
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,745
You know folks around here

125
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,885
are waiting for the season to open.

126
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,647
If word gets out that a
shark tore a diver to bits,

127
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,729
hey, you can kiss the
tourist season goodbye.

128
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,356
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,259
If there is a shark
around here, gentlemen,

130
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,363
we don't have any choice.

131
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,739
We have to close the beach,

132
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,034
and we have to postpone the regatta.

133
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,287
It was an accident, just an accident.

134
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,950
No sharks involved, no fins.

135
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,791
Hey, it was the propeller
of a fishing boat.

136
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,450
What about the coroner's report?

137
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:02,047
Francis, now, the coroner
called me two minutes ago.

138
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,053
He said he could be wrong.

139
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,637
Why, hell, you know how many
people drowned in accidents?

140
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,867
Are you gonna blame
them all on sharks too?

141
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,436
Yeah, maybe.

142
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,189
There's only one shark that
can do a job like this.

143
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,569
And which one is that?

144
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,602
The tiger shark.

145
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,739
From the judge of things, it's
gonna have a mouth like this.

146
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,161
Oh, man.

147
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,913
Did you see that?

148
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:28,695
A super babe.

149
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,226
She had tits on her like watermelons.

150
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,830
Uh!

151
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,353
You like them all as
long as they're breathing.

152
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,617
Hey, it's enough, isn't it?

153
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,369
Yoo-hoo, Ronnie!

154
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,881
Well, look who's here.

155
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Yeah.

156
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,840
What a pity she hangs out with
that nerd fish doctor, Billy.

157
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:50,717
I dunno.

158
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,998
Maybe nothing will happen,
but I'm sure we'll score, man.

159
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,432
Vanessa is hot to trot.

160
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,361
Hi, Bob.

161
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,113
Oh, hi, Gloria.

162
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,133
Looks like your little sister

163
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,613
has a crush on the viking's son.

164
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:06,949
How's susy?

165
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,906
I wanna see her after the show tonight.

166
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,805
I don't think that's such a good idea.

167
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,574
There seems to be a little bad feeling

168
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,410
between your dad and mine.

169
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,290
I wouldn't wanna do anything...

170
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,917
Do you always do what
your daddy tells you to?

171
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:18,578
No.

172
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,873
Well, then I'll see you
at the aquarium at eight.

173
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:22,710
Hey, wait for me!

174
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,011
I'm coming too!

175
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:28,967
Now, hold it.

176
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:29,847
What do you want?

177
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,633
I'm the person in charge of pussy.

178
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,656
I have to, you know,
check your credentials.

179
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,020
Dick brain.

180
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,021
Dick brain.

181
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,523
Dick brain.

182
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,520
Am I disturbing you, dad?

183
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,314
No, it's all right.

184
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,617
Come onin.

185
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,202
What did Billy and
Francis want last night?

186
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,120
Ah, those crazy bastards.

187
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,291
They got it in their heads
there's a shark around here.

188
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,988
They want Godfrey to close the beaches

189
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,343
and me to call off the regatta.

190
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,846
And they wanna make the news public.

191
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,475
The result would be massive cancellations.

192
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:19,231
If you're asking me, dag
soerensen's behind this.

193
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,059
He wants to get back at you

194
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,191
because you sent him that eviction notice.

195
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,740
No, no.

196
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,698
No, he's got too much to lose.

197
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,404
Do you know that Gloria
has got a crush on Bob?

198
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,196
What?

199
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,491
He hangs around her like a bad smell.

200
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,410
Why, that dirty little bastard!

201
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,170
I'll tear his fucking balls off!

202
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,627
1 don't think that'll be necessary.

203
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,007
I've got a better idea.

204
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,975
Come on.

205
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:02,853
First, I wanna swim.

206
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,152
Why now?

207
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,237
Later.

208
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,038
No.

209
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,669
I wanna swim first.

210
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,876
Ugh, what a pain in the ass.

211
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,292
You go by yourself and I
will wait for you here.

212
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,354
You don't know what you're missing!

213
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,610
Come on, don't be so lazy.

214
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,202
Are you coming or not?

215
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,392
It's freezing!

216
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,023
Come on!

217
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,809
Let's do it in here.

218
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,551
Stop kidding around, jan.

219
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:57,891
This isn't funny.

220
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,858
That was really dumb!

221
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,683
You nearly scared me to death.

222
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,831
Katie!

223
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,126
Katie!

224
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,010
Turn around!

225
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,881
Don't be so greedy, papi.

226
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,595
You already had your dinner.

227
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,561
Where's my little Daisy?

228
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:49,894
Don't pay any attention.

229
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,194
Papi's jealous.

230
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:01,953
Good girl.

231
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,488
Where's cookie?

232
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,577
That's enough for tonight, honey.

233
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,886
It's time for supper.

234
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,345
Just a little while longer.

235
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,726
Please, daddy.

236
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,933
Gloria's having such fun.

237
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,312
It's late for Gloria too.

238
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,269
She's gonna get in trouble with her dad.

239
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,108
Isn't that right, Gloria?

240
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,271
It sure is, and he won't
let me have any dessert.

241
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,574
All right.

242
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,525
But promise me you'll come back tomorrow.

243
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,155
Take Gloria home, and don't be too long.

244
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:47,789
Good night, cookie.

245
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,582
Good night, Daisy.

246
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,841
And dad hasn't been
the same since mom died

247
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,460
and susy lost the use of her legs.

248
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:03,051
When he was young, he was a great sailor.

249
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,137
He used to hunt whales in the north sea.

250
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,603
And ever since that damn
accident, he hasn't been the same.

251
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,060
First, your dad's throwing
us out of the aquarium,

252
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,896
and then that shark.

253
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,395
Things couldn't get any worse.

254
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,529
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,363
I gotta do something.

256
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,241
I can't let susy be shacked
up in that apartment.

257
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,992
I feel so ridiculous.

258
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,904
When you see and feel certain
things, you suddenly realize

259
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,790
how futile the things you strive for are.

260
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,872
Then why'd you come tonight?

261
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,503
I wanted to see susy, and you.

262
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,647
Gloria!

263
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,941
Ronnie, Bob and I...

264
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:56,817
Go home!

265
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,978
I'll deal with you later!

266
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,276
Leave her alone!

267
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,776
She didn't do anything to you!

268
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,699
Let go of him!

269
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,075
Leave him alone!

270
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,374
Loser.

271
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,581
Keep away from my sister!

272
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,539
Go home.

273
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,422
Bob and I have things to discuss.

274
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,718
Go!

275
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,638
Go!

276
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,774
You need a lesson.

277
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,277
The world's a bad place, Bobby boy.

278
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,819
And you and your daddy are
in debt up to your necks.

279
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,699
Hey, it's just as well
we got here in time.

280
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,583
This isn't the moment to dick around.

281
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,119
We still got work.

282
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,081
I've given them a special filling,

283
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,043
strychnine nitrate with
rat poison.

284
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,176
The viking's in for a nasty
surprise in the morning, boys.

285
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,471
Oh, man.

286
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,969
Where are you, little dolphins?

287
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,383
Come here.

288
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,846
I'm gonna fix your wagons.

289
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,834
The damn fish is
gonna wake everybody up.

290
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:58,858
Quick.

291
00:21:58,901 --> 00:21:59,481
Just thrown in that stuff
and let's get outta here.

292
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:00,777
Come on, dolphins.

293
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:02,234
Here, boy.

294
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,530
Come and get it.

295
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:08,987
Let's get outta here.

296
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,721
Take it easy, Daisy.

297
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,016
What's gotten into you?

298
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,603
What's this?

299
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:44,654
Get Billy immediately.

300
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,070
Somebody's trying to poison the dolphins.

301
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,406
Sorry to wake you, sheriff.

302
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,537
Let's talk in here.

303
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,984
You better have a good
reason for waking me up

304
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,293
this early in the morning.

305
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,175
He says his girlfriend's
been eaten by a shark.

306
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,470
Eaten by a shark?

307
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,633
He must be stewed to the gills.

308
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,932
I'll give him the test

309
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,383
and then I'll throw him in the
hoosegow for drunkenness.

310
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,637
Hey, wait, wait.

311
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,937
I wanna interrogate him.

312
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,423
Okay, we're done.

313
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,598
We got 'em just in time.

314
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,141
Everything's gonna be fine now.

315
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,604
Thanks, Billy.

316
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:44,980
Oh, hi, Francis.

317
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,648
Looks like we had another
shark attack last night.

318
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,031
Where?

319
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,237
At old beach.

320
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,899
A woman, a certain Katie Adams.

321
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,363
I sent a couple of my
men down to check it out.

322
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,175
Well, if the territorial
theory is correct

323
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,871
and what I assume is true,

324
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,623
there's gonna be a lot of
trouble down there, Francis.

325
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,753
Billy, what do we know about sharks?

326
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,430
Well, we know that
they're a sort of locomotive

327
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,796
with a mouthful of butcher's knives.

328
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,090
And all they really know how to do

329
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,977
is swim, eat and make baby sharks,

330
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,939
and that's all.

331
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,756
So if we were to have the regatta,

332
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,421
it would be like saying, "help yourself."

333
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:30,445
"Chow ison."

334
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,980
And there are only two
ways to get rid of 'em.

335
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,991
Kill them or starve 'em.

336
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,534
Very clever, these dolphins, dag.

337
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:47,496
What do you want?

338
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,288
I came to show the property
to these friends of mine,

339
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,583
and I have the plans for the hotel

340
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,753
that's going to be built right here.

341
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,466
The sunset's right in front of us.

342
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,557
I mean, it is gorgeous, right there.

343
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,517
It's a beautiful sight to see.

344
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:09,734
Look,

345
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,775
if you leave right away, I'll
give you a nice hunk of cash

346
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,135
that'll keep you going for a
couple of years, all right?

347
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,866
You're some kind of
a son of a bitch, Sam.

348
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:20,696
What did you say?

349
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,316
I said you're a son of a bitch!

350
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,867
Look, if you need more
information on the sports program

351
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,831
or the entertainment programs,

352
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,416
my secretary's at your disposal.

353
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,036
Take the folks back to the hotel.

354
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:34,707
I'll be right there.

355
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,010
Okay.

356
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:37,929
That is it!

357
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,047
You're doing the wrong
thing, refusing my offer.

358
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,350
You are...

359
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,830
Not only do I refuse the
offer, but I'll beat the shit

360
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,654
out of anyone who tries
to poison my dolphins.

361
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,477
I don't even know what
you're talking about, and...

362
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,482
Don't be so wicked, Mr. Lewis.

363
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,736
Gloria cares about cookie and Daisy too.

364
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:01,363
And by the way, tell your Bob

365
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:02,862
to stay away from my daughter,

366
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,366
or you can buy another wheelchair.

367
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,428
He's nothing
but a puffed up windbag.

368
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,602
Sam.

369
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,017
You going to see the mayor too?

370
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,977
Just the man I wanted to see.

371
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,392
Come up with me.

372
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,104
Tell Godfrey we're here, Patricia.

373
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,276
You are obsessed!

374
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,070
Obsessed my ass!

375
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,784
1 won't let you speak to me like this.

376
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,874
Listen, Godfrey, this morning,

377
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,037
that loser of a viking
threw me in his pool.

378
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,749
You can't trust the man.

379
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,049
He's a madman.

380
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,966
His contract is clear.

381
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,198
He hasn't paid his rent
for three months, and I...

382
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,759
You may not have to worry about that.

383
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,719
If things keep going the way they are,

384
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,884
Hampton bay is gonna be deserted!

385
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,220
Well, you've got it in your head

386
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,185
that there's a killer shark around here.

387
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,599
What do you want us to do?

388
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,774
Godfrey, are you willing
to take responsibility

389
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,485
for condemning this town
to a winter of starvation?

390
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:27,403
Sam, mayor Jefferson, this
shark is a perfect machine,

391
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,786
a man-eating machine,

392
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,573
and it's already taken
the lives of two people!

393
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,619
Put shark nets around the
boundary of the regatta.

394
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,562
Inform the coastguard to patrol the coast

395
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,705
with helicopters and boats.

396
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,250
Call in extra officers
from nearby counties.

397
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,636
I refuse to put off the
regatta or the ceremony,

398
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,092
and I'll pay for everything.

399
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,973
That sounds like an excellent idea.

400
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,139
Well, have it your way.

401
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,770
But remember, you're the ones

402
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,977
who wanted to open up a diner for sharks.

403
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,910
J four, three, two one, go j

404
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:19,000
J get up and work >»

405
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,548
Just as well then.

406
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,649
She's early.

407
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,480
I'll just tell her to go on without me.

408
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,985
Sounds good to me.

409
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,528
Look, glenda...

410
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:48,362
Hi, Vanessa.

411
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,662
Is Billy in?

412
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:51,998
Yeah, come on in.

413
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,943
Hey, Francis, what's up?

414
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,658
Billy, we need you right now.

415
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,953
The shark cages have arrived.

416
00:29:59,256 --> 00:29:59,836
Billy's busy.

417
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,412
We're going to the club tonight.

418
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,001
No, it's okay, Vanessa.

419
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,719
You go on with glenda.

420
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,462
I'll catch up with you later on.

421
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,549
Once and for all, Billy,
it is the fish or me!

422
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:09,338
What do I have to do

423
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,007
to get you to pay attention
to me, grow gills?

424
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,311
Hey, forget about it.

425
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,320
- I'll take care of this myself.
- No, really.

426
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,686
Vanessa, it won't take very long.

427
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,342
Come on, this is really important.

428
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,901
J four, three, two, one, go >

429
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:24,648
hold on, glenda.

430
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,154
I'll be right there.

431
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,574
Billy, I want you to find the
tallest skyscraper you can

432
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:35,205
and throw yourself off it
and then go fuck yourself!

433
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,462
Nice temper.

434
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,335
Dad, why do sharks eat people?

435
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,164
Because they're hungry.

436
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,049
They're always hungry, I think.

437
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,488
Does blood come out if a shark eats you?

438
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,752
Oh, yes.

439
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,158
And you're gonna have nightmares

440
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,502
if you keep talking about sharks.

441
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,910
If a shark tried to eat me,

442
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,454
I'd punch him in the nose.

443
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,178
Don't worry.

444
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,479
No shark's gonna eat you.

445
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,098
Why not?

446
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,138
If I go swimming, I bet one will try.

447
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,354
But Daisy and cookie
will tear him to pieces.

448
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,653
That's enough.

449
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,821
Here we are.

450
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:11,700
Once upon a time, there was a
little boy called Tom thumb.

451
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,532
He lived in a small house with his parents

452
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,947
and his three little brothers and sisters.

453
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,993
They were very hungry,
because they were very poor.

454
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,296
And one night...

455
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,252
J I should have listened >»

456
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:28,338
j 'cause father knows best, you see

457
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,920
j I'm tired of running j

458
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,930
j I'll jump the train >

459
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:38,640
js but something always
drags me back again

460
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,850
- look at those two.
- Oh!

461
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,855
Ooh, everybody's here.

462
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,109
They're gonna die when they
see you dressed like this.

463
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:46,939
Look who's talking.

464
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,948
J bad attitude

465
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,235
j bad attitude

466
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,538
sexy mamas.

467
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,947
- Whoo!
- Hey!

468
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,330
I wanna dance.

469
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,626
Yeah.

470
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:07,089
You know, Tommy, you give
off a certain animal magnetism.

471
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,874
Hey, I'm a sex machine.

472
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,667
I even got a spare set of balls.

473
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,095
Does that mean you
got enough to go around?

474
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,676
Excuse me, I forgot my lifesaver.

475
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,851
I hope you drown.

476
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,481
Feeling a little depressed?

477
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,520
To tell you the truth, I'm pissed.

478
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,325
I'm bored to death.

479
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,026
Everyday, it's the same old story.

480
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,865
Aren't you going out with Billy?

481
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,745
Him, all he cares about
are groupers and flatheads.

482
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,541
What are you doing, belly dancing?

483
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,920
I'm an artist.

484
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,706
Michelangelo worked with stone,

485
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,130
Van gogh worked with canvas,

486
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,795
and you know, I...

487
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,463
What do you use for a jockstrap,

488
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,679
a walnut shell with a
piece of elastic?

489
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,389
I'm desperately lonely.

490
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,689
I'm free.

491
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,775
I'm confused.

492
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,067
I'm generous.

493
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,362
Above all,

494
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,896
I'm full of love.

495
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
It's written in my eyes.

496
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,452
You wanna go someplace else?

497
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,791
Okay.

00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,169

have you seen Vanessa?

506
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,852
Vanessa?

507
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,686
She went off with prince
charming to the beach of passion.

508
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,830
Ronnie behaves like that

509
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,287
because he wants to emulate my father.

510
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,867
My father acts the way he does

511
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,166
because your father gave
him that eviction notice.

512
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,627
We have to keep seeing
each other behind in secret.

513
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,884
I love this place.

514
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,341
To think the first time
I came here, I hated it.

515
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,809
Bob, let's run away together.

516
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:24,809
How?

517
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:25,639
Easy.

518
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:27,458
We just send everybody
to hell and we run away.

519
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,143
No, it's not...

520
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,024
I don't want you to go away.

521
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,436
I don't want you to go away.

522
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,248
Hmm.

523
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:52,628
Uh-huh.

524
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,924
Ooh.

525
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,884
Hmm.

526
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:06,968
Come on!

527
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:07,852
Wait a minute.

528
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,308
My shoes.

529
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,608
Take them off!

530
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,368
Vanessa!

531
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:23,996
Comeonin.

532
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,756
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

533
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,341
Isn't that Ronnie's car?

534
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,287
They're fooling
around in the ocean.

535
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,552
Ronnie gets 'em all.

536
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,554
Let's scare the shit out of 'em.

537
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:52,858
Good idea.

538
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,157
Hampton bay police!

539
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,820
Don't you dirty little devils know

540
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,203
you're polluting the ocean doing that?

541
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,963
I'm Ronnie Lewis, Samuel Lewis's son.

542
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,716
Is it me or are you
in shit up to your neck?

543
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,763
Wait a minute.

544
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,889
Glenda?

545
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:24,973
Tommy?

546
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,630
Is that you?

547
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,094
It's us all right.

548
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,180
And you two jerks fell for the whole thing

549
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,810
like a ton of bricks.

550
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,767
You lousy coward.

551
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,358
Oh, look out!

552
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:44,525
There's a shark that's
about to nip you on the ass!

553
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,068
You assholes.

554
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,532
Now, I'll show you the shark.

555
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,906
Oh, don't get mad, Ronnie,

556
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,370
it makes your pecker shrivel.

557
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:00,540
Wait a minute.

558
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,382
Don't get mad, Ronnie! It makes
your pecker shrivel, man.

559
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:11,014
Oh, you're all wet!

560
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,722
Oh, you're all wet.

561
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,935
I wanted to personally
reassure everyone myself,

562
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,774
and let you know that we have

563
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,485
the interest of the city at heart.

564
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,070
And now, sheriff berger
here will illustrate

565
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,031
all of the precautions that we have taken

566
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,116
to protect the regatta zone.

567
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,416
Sheriff?

568
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,457
As you can see, we
have completely protected

569
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,502
this area of the coastline
with a special shark net

570
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,796
that goes from here to here.

571
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,390
Special observations
posts have been set up

572
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,270
at strategic locations, and
armed men are on board boats

573
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,772
anchored just on the other side of the net

574
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,604
placed here, here and here.

575
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,896
So the entire area where
the regatta is going to be

576
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,236
is completely protected, 100%.

577
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,493
Ladies and gentlemen,
absolutely nothing will happen.

578
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,125
You have my word on that.

579
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:34,406
Excuse me, sir.

580
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,320
Excuse me.

581
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,490
Is this the beach where
we can see the shark from?

582
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,282
What shark?

583
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,542
The one that killed all those folks.

584
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:42,873
They said iton TV.

585
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,754
They said there's a shark
killing people right here.

586
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,630
There was a shark, but now it's gone.

587
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,840
And we hope that it doesn't come back.

588
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,348
You mean to say we came all
this way, and now, it's gone?

589
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:56,974
They didn't say that on TV.

590
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,428
There's nothing I can do about that.

591
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,268
Will you please just move on?

592
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,153
Oh, baloney.

593
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,244
But I thought we were
gonna go see the shark.

594
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,531
Ronnie, shut up.

595
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,154
Look down there.

596
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:16,455
Isn't that a shark?

597
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,946
It's him all right, that son of a bitch.

598
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,250
I'll fix him.

599
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,543
Go lower.

600
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:25,711
I have to get him first.

601
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,419
Otherwise, the bastard will
dive down and that'll be that.

602
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,773
I got him in the head.

603
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,529
We can go back to base.

604
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,530
I'll tell the boys to go retrieve him.

605
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,240
Okay, Roger.

606
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,576
We'll proceed with the
retrieval operation.

607
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,161
Good work, guys, over.

608
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,861
Quick, quick, let's follow the cop.

609
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,001
I think we're gonna see the shark.

610
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,365
Come on, gather your things up.

611
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,720
Come on.

612
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,015
Let's go.

613
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,427
What a big mouth.

614
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,847
It's bigger than the big
bad wolf, isn't it, daddy?

615
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,858
Well, it's a
tiger shark all right.

616
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,404
Daddy, does that mean
that its daddy was a shark

617
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,364
and its mommy was a tiger?

618
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,618
Call the press agencies
immediately and CBS,

619
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,999
the news networks, the radio stations.

620
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,080
And go and find Dawson
and get him over here.

621
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,191
I want pictures of
everybody around that shark.

622
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,215
Go.

623
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:50,959
Francis.

624
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:51,964
Great job, well done.

625
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,966
Thank you, thank you.

626
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,554
I'm not saying that it isn't him.

627
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,885
It probably is.

628
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,721
They're very ferocious and
very rare in these waters.

629
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,977
But the fact of the matter is, dag,

630
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,854
this jaw span just doesn't convince me.

631
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:07,684
Now, wait.

632
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:08,984
What are you saying here?

633
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,941
You're talking nonsense, boy.

634
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,773
You've been seeing too many movies.

635
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,152
You wanna be sure, mayor?

636
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,064
You wanna be sure, Mr. Lewis?

637
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,982
All you have to do then is open him up

638
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:19,571
and see what's in his stomach.

639
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:21,995
Don't talk rubbish, boy.

640
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,951
This is not the place, nor the time.

641
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:40,925
Whose boat is that?

642
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,761
It belongs to Ramon, the Cuban.

643
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,335
What happened?

644
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:08,911
We found it adrift.

645
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:10,918
It was half full of water.

646
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,374
There was nobody aboard.

647
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,520
Now, you're not gonna
try and tell me that

648
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:16,920
that was done by a shark too.

649
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:29,054
If I were you, I'd cancel this regatta.

650
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,232
Everybody knows Ramon
was into dynamite fishing.

651
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,108
It was an explosion.

652
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,756
He blew the back of his own boat off.

653
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,566
And even if it was a shark attack,

654
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,051
well, the coastguard's got it by now.

655
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,691
Have that shark carcass
towed out to sea, will you?

656
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,674
It's gonna stink up
the whole goddamn town.

657
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,259
Give me an s.

658
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:57,960
Give me an a.

659
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,261
Give me an m.

660
00:43:59,428 --> 00:43:59,917
Give me an ll.

661
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:00,801
Give me an e.

662
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:01,631
Giveme a w.

663
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:02,465
Give me an I.

664
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,765
Give me an s.

665
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,891
Sam

666
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,059
Lewis!

667
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,144
Whoo!

668
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,351
Hey, Graham.

669
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,181
Hi.

670
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:10,970
Nice to have you here.

671
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,394
I've never missed this
celebration in my whole life.

672
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,901
I bet you're a future champ

673
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,609
in the Hampton bay regatta, hmm.

674
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,777
Great day, Mr. Lewis.

675
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,240
I hope Ronnie wins.

676
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,496
Thank you, ma'am, thank you.

677
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:30,281
Mr. Lewis.

678
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,620
Oh, no, please, no, no.

679
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:34,293
We hope Ronnie Lewis

680
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,329
is gonna do himself proud again this year,

681
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,920
even though our champion is
not going to have an easy time.

682
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,552
He is gonna have to deal with
very well-trained opponents,

683
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,260
especially young Bob soerensen.

684
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,016
If you let Bob win,
then you're a nothing.

685
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,034
I'll cream him when
we round the first buoy.

686
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,069
Don't get caught in
with the first round.

687
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,031
Get the wind behind you and
wait for the right moment.

688
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,331
I'll keep that in mind.

689
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,497
Yeah, that way, you won't
make an ass of yourself.

690
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,896
As you know, this regatta

691
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,127
marks the beginning of the
summer season in Hampton bay,

692
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,959
and is sponsored by the Lewis hotel chain,

693
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,998
owned by Mr. Samuel Lewis.

694
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,702
The divers have checked the nets.

695
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,172
The buoys are in place.

696
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:26,973
The men are too.

697
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:30,266
I just don't feel right about this, though.

698
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,349
I'm afraid, Francis.

699
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,395
That motherfucker is acting so strange.

700
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,980
It's almost as if someone has trained him

701
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,486
to attack and kill.

702
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,865
Let's keep our fingers crossed.

703
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,329
Five minutes to start time.

704
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,872
Wish me luck, huh.

705
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,006
Hey, you got your motor running.

706
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,259
You just save it for
the victory celebration.

707
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:14,143
J 1 just can't figure you out

708
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,269
j "cause baby, I adore »

709
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,975
j; Baby, don't you need me j

710
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,711
I want you to watch out for Ronnie.

711
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,271
He plays dirty.

712
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,777
Papi and I will be rooting for you.

713
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,400
Don't worry.

714
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,316
I'll beat the pants off that loudmouth.

715
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,701
And with the prize money,
we'll pay off Mr. Lewis.

716
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,248
Hi, Vanessa.

717
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,291
Hi, susy.

718
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,207
Have you seen Billy?

719
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,539
He was on the pier with Francis.

720
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,955
Daddy, can I go watch
the races with Vanessa?

721
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:45,045
Sure, but keep out of the way
of the confusion, all right?

722
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:47,213
Let's go find Billy.

723
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,380
J all you wanna do is
just dance, dance, dance

724
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:54,517
j while there is rhythm,
there'll be no romance j

725
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,178
j 'cause all you wanna do is just dance

726
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,721
be careful.

727
00:46:59,025 --> 00:46:59,559
Don't worry.

728
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:00,859
I'll win for us too.

729
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,234
I'll rip his balls off
and use them for earrings!

730
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,018
I'll pulverize him!

731
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,903
You worry about winning.

732
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,438
We can take care of him later.

733
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,497
Let's shove his head
underwater and drown him.

734
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,027
All contestants to the starting line.

735
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,418
Two minutes to go.

736
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,998
I repeat, two minutes to go.

737
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,922
Bob's too far back.

738
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,262
I told him to keep back.

739
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:32,827
That way, he won't have to turn tight.

740
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:34,924
30 seconds to go.

741
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:35,761
There isn't a shark in the world

742
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:37,848
that can get through these nets.

743
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,147
I can believe it.

744
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,266
They cost $30,000.

745
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,119
13 seconds to go.

746
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,799
Ten.

747
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,103
Nine.

748
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:18,929
Eight.

749
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,230
Seven.

750
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,481
Six.

751
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:22,774
Five.

752
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,900
Four.

753
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,026
Three.

754
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,194
Two.

755
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,404
One.

756
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:47,833
Come on, Bob!

757
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,999
What are you waiting for?

758
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,850
Fuckin' hell!

759
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,636
- Go, go, go!
- Yeah!

760
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,731
Whoo!

761
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:18,865
You're disgusting!

762
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,780
You're a piece of shit!

763
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:21,788
You're vomit!

764
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,084
You're a nobody!

765
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,622
And you're a loser!

766
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,666
Come on, Bob, come on!

767
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,048
What are you waiting for?
Push him in!

768
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,648
Come on, he's the best!

769
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:59,194
You can kiss your aquarium
goodbye, Mr. dag soerensen.

770
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,087
Gloria, give me the binoculars.

771
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:23,637
Oh, my god!

772
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:24,938
What's wrong?

773
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,058
Get them out of the water, quick!

774
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:37,909
Get out of the water!

775
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,785
Everybody, get out of the water!

776
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:44,909
There's a shark!

777
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,915
Look, there's a shark!

778
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,979
Attention, attention!

779
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,396
The race has been suspended!

780
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,652
Leave your board and get in this boat!

781
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,080
Do something, Tommy!

782
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:24,995
Help them!

783
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:25,950
Save them!

784
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,660
Do you think I'm crazy?

785
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,193
Leave your boards and climb aboard.

786
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:33,913
Climb, climb aboard!

787
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,514
Get out of the water!

788
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,300
Get out of the water!

789
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,895
Get out of the water, quick!

790
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,397
Get out, get out!

791
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:53,693
Stay calm.

792
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,777
Stay calm.

793
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,518
- Somebody help them, please.
- I know, I know.

794
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,076
It's all right, honey.

795
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,116
I'm here with you.

796
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,275
Get out of my way!

797
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:37,855
Get out of my way!

798
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:25,486
Susy!

799
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,151
Where are you?

800
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,707
Susy!

801
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,543
Susy!

802
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,338
Vanessa!

803
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,173
Vanessa!

804
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,092
I got you.

805
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:53,052
Vanessa, no!

806
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,765
Help me, help me.

807
00:53:57,985 --> 00:53:58,985
Vanessa!

808
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:00,987
No!

809
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,489
No!

810
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,491
Vanessa!

811
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,292
Okay, let's go.

812
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,593
Come on.

813
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,088
Grab from the back now.

814
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,388
Let's go.

815
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:28,575
Slide her out, slide her out.

816
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,133
There we go.

817
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:29,922
Got it?

818
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,510
Okay, there we go.

819
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,849
All right,
get her in, get her in.

820
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,604
Let's go.

821
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,252
Calling Dr. Stafford.

822
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,437
Please report to the
emergency room immediately.

823
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:42,943
Calling Dr. Stafford.

824
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:47,447
Please report to the
emergency room immediately.

825
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,623
The doctor said it was
only a momentary shock.

826
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,784
Tomorrow, she can go home.

827
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,879
Is Vanessa okay?

828
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:07,759
She's just fine.

829
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,055
She's at home with Billy.

830
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,009
Sharks are really bad.

831
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,934
There are far worse animals.

832
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:19,649
Daddy?

833
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,480
What is it, honey?

834
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:26,020
Tell papi and the dolphins
not to worry about me.

835
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,323
I sure will.

836
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:35,998
I'm sorry, sir.

837
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,208
You're not allowed.

838
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,007
Hey, I'm sorry.

839
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:52,887
I couldn't...

840
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,103
You know what you gotta
do now, don't you, Sam?

841
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:55,886
What?

842
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,802
You're gonna have to
offer a reward of $100,000

843
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:01,062
to whoever brings in
the head of that shark.

844
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,225
I don't have the authority.

845
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,314
I mean, not without...

846
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,319
Without what?

847
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,027
Without what, you fat fuck?

848
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,946
Vanessa's dead because of you!

849
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,348
Everyone knows you're the one

850
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,704
who opposed the regatta
from being postponed.

851
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,787
Samuel Lewis, the
big boss of shark city.

852
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:24,578
Is that what you want the
newspapers and TV to call you?

853
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,999
Hey, I always acted in
the interest of the town.

854
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:31,339
In the best interest
of yourself, you mean.

855
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:34,925
Offer it.

856
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,510
Offer the reward.

857
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,810
Do it for Vanessa,

858
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,219
and all the kids who
lost their lives today.

859
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:45,482
You know Ronnie risked being killed
by that shark today too.

860
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,934
Killing this shark isn't gonna be easy.

861
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,478
He's a treacherous mother.

862
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,942
It's not like fishing for sardines.

863
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,198
We're dealing with a man eater here.

864
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,406
If he gets his teeth into you
and clamps down with his jaws,

865
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:58,240
you've had it.

866
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,871
Oh, come on.

867
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,887
All you gotta do is put
a bullet in its head

868
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,705
and it's fucked, right?

869
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:06,586
The tiger shark we're looking
for is a homicidal maniac.

870
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,043
It attacks here, here and
the middle of your belly,

871
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:10,343
and your guts are out.

872
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:14,048
The trouble is you're still
alive when it starts eating you.

873
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,177
Now that you know, you should
have more respect for him.

874
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:19,057
Billy, you're the expert.

875
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,353
Take over.

876
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,586
The weak points of the tiger shark

877
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,559
are here, at the base of the head,

878
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,769
and underneath the dorsal fin.

879
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,560
You must be precise.

880
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,728
Only aim at these areas.

881
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,872
And don't kid yourselves,
because if this thing

882
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:37,660
gets any idea whatsoever
that you're in its presence,

883
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,536
he's not gonna leave you alone.

884
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,991
So you have two choices.

885
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,873
One, you can get the hell out of there.

886
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,330
Or two, you can try to kill him.

887
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:50,172
Because if you don't, he's gonna kill you.

888
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,875
Are there any questions?

889
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,972
If it was your decision to
go ahead with the regatta,

890
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,107
then our friends in New York
are not gonna be very happy.

891
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,112
All right.

892
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,528
So a mistake was made,

893
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,941
but I took all the necessary precautions.

894
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,202
Now the press is sticking
their nose in our town business.

895
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,158
We don't allow for mistakes, Sam.

896
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,116
You know that.

897
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:24,777
Well, what do you want me to do,

898
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,542
jump in and kill the damn thing myself?

899
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:28,497
I offered a reward for it.

900
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,207
What else could I do?

901
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,917
Just one thing.

902
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,459
We've invested a lot of money
in real estate in this town.

903
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:36,342
So you better make sure

904
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,924
that shark is eliminated immediately.

905
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,224
Is that clear?

906
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,515
And not in a week's time.

907
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:43,811
Now.

908
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,166
In the past, I've
solved more difficult problems

909
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,555
than this for you.

910
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,474
I'll solve this one too.

911
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,777
You'd better.

912
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,074
For your own good.

913
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,297
On your back, huh.

914
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,923
If don't get rid of
that damn shark soon,

915
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,778
the prices around here are gonna crash,

916
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,462
and we are in deep trouble.

917
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:23,758
I've got a personal
grudge with that goddamn...

918
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:26,973
I'll bring his head myself.

919
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,307
Are you sure your old
man isn't gonna be mad?

920
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,897
Well, right now, he's got
other things to worry about.

921
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:37,277
Besides, when he sees us
haul that shark in the port,

922
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:38,697
he'll be too proud to be mad.

923
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:39,992
The kids of Hampton bay

924
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,677
avenge their friends and kill the shark.

925
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,233
I can already see the headlines.

926
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,407
And what if we come back empty handed?

927
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:46,726
You gotta be kidding me.

928
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,394
I bet my ass we'll be hauling that bastard

929
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:48,952
when we come back.

930
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,892
My father used to use this for hunting.

931
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,088
Let me see that.

932
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,336
Twelve Gauge, cool.

933
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:55,633
Okay, guys, let's go.

934
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,279
You know, when I used to go
whaling in the arctic ocean,

935
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,259
all the half asses
wanted to become whalers

936
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,076
so they could use the harpoon.

937
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,162
Once, I caught a whale
about 20 meters long.

938
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,201
I had to plant three harpoons in him

939
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,086
before I could bring him in.

940
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,742
These days, these whippersnappers,

941
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:22,877
they bring along radar,
sonar, even a microwave oven

942
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,422
so they can heat up their
sandwiches.

943
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:28,161
Ah, you brought a lot of mighty fine stuff

944
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,346
aboard here, Mr. Morrison,
although I don't know

945
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,102
what use that son of a bitch
of a shark's gonna have for it.

946
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:34,398
He may eat it.

947
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,849
Once, I had one try to
eat the motor off my boat.

948
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:42,358
The shark we're looking for,
dag, is no ordinary shark.

949
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:43,657
It's strange.

950
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,273
Its behavior is anomalous.

951
01:01:56,338 --> 01:01:58,338
Okay, let's get ready to
lower this in the water.

952
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,126
Here's hoping he likes it.

953
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,505
My mother's roast.

954
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,501
Okay, Tommy, start slowing down.

955
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:23,194
I'm tired of playing
with cookie and Daisy.

956
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,151
I hate this place.

957
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,781
I can't wait to go.

958
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,077
Is that so?

959
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:32,321
No, I was just building
tassels in the air.

960
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:35,115
You mean castles in
the air, you silly thing.

961
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,283
Isn't that what I said?

962
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:39,460
I don't want to leave.

963
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,212
I don't wanna leave.

964
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,214
There it is!

965
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:51,222
It's over there!

966
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:54,009
Look, you can see its fin!

967
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,552
It's enormous!

968
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:56,855
Come on, Ronnie, shoot!

969
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,438
Don't let it get away!

970
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,443
Pull over!

971
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:02,695
Pull over, you imbecile!

972
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:04,774
I can't shoot from here!

973
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:28,339
He's coming right at us!

974
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,518
It's stuck!

975
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:35,220
Now what are we gonna do?

976
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,930
Put it on full throttle!

977
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:42,818
Damn it!

978
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,227
The controls aren't responding.

979
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,295
I wanna lure him to the surface

980
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,881
and then harpoon him
as if he were a whale.

981
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:12,950
You're stupid if you
think you can get a shark

982
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,930
on a fish hook as if it were a COD.

983
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:17,705
Well, for want of anything better,

984
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,845
maybe we can catch a few
squids for tonight's dinner.

985
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,069
Let's lower the bait.

986
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,355
Maybe that'll bring him out.

987
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,063
It's the only thing for us.

988
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:49,968
Shoot!

989
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:50,750
Ronnie, shoot it, Ronnie!

990
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:52,054
Kill it!

991
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:57,761
Shoot him, Ronnie!

992
01:04:58,061 --> 01:04:59,061
Kill him!

993
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:08,271
Shoot!

994
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,571
Shoot for Christ's sake!

995
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,772
God, the line's gonna break!

996
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,670
Help me!

997
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,715
Quick, pull him out!

998
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,010
Help me!

999
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,388
Pull me up!

1000
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,142
Ronnie?

1001
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,774
Ronnie!

1002
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,360
What the hell was that?

1003
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:56,900
It's an explosion.

1004
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,484
Probably some fool hunting
the shark with depth charges.

1005
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:00,808
No, this one occurred on the surface.

1006
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:01,867
It was a big one too.

1007
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:02,781
Bob!

1008
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:05,416
Start her up, put her on
a course north, northeast.

1009
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:06,417
Full steam ahead.

1010
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:07,713
Aye-aye, sir.

1011
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,963
Sheriff, we received a
message from the coastguard.

1012
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:21,633
Lewis's boat exploded
at sea, no survivors.

1013
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:22,936
Oh, shit.

1014
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,440
Inform the coastguard

1015
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,815
that all boats are to
return to port at once.

1016
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,643
And I'll go tell Lewis the bad news.

1017
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:32,946
Okay.

1018
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:56,718
Dad, dad, hurry!

1019
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:57,718
We've broken down.

1020
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,014
The rudder's stuck.

1021
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,434
The rudder's stuck.

1022
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,150
Christ!

1023
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:24,892
I'm gonna have to go
below and take a look.

1024
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,060
Something's blocked the rudder.

1025
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:26,618
I'll go.

1026
01:07:26,918 --> 01:07:27,407
No, I'll go.

1027
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,244
I know more about mechanics.

1028
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,855
Billy, you may be a wiz kid in the lab,

1029
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,159
but at sea, you're just ballast.

1030
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:31,794
Larry, stay here and make sure

1031
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,150
the boat doesn't get under way.

1032
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,174
Okay.

1033
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,465
It's my job. I'm the helmsman.

1034
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,529
Why is he taking so long?

1035
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:03,409
I'm going down.

1036
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:04,319
Don't worry, dag.

1037
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,487
This thing will tell us if he's in danger.

1038
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,100
Hey!

1039
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,558
The ropes are tied around the propeller.

1040
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:38,048
There's just too many
half-assed fishermen around here.

1041
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,341
Bob, when you were down there,

1042
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,026
did you notice anything unusual?

1043
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:42,326
No.

1044
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,693
Well, yeah, there's a wreck down there.

1045
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:45,996
Right over there.

1046
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:47,448
It must be the Cleveland.

1047
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:50,081
We're over the banks south of cape fells.

1048
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:50,910
Attention, attention.

1049
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,530
Wasn't that the ship carrying...

1050
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,190
This is the coastguard.

1051
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:57,372
Return to the port immediately.

1052
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,712
Repeat, return to the port immediately.

1053
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,094
Something big must
have happened in town.

1054
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:10,100
Listen, dag, the Cleveland
was the ship carrying the...

1055
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:11,516
We'll talk about it later.

1056
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:12,808
Bob, we're going back in.

1057
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,129
If anything important happens,

1058
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,169
you can get in touch with me by radio.

1059
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:50,263
Okay, sheriff.

1060
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:31,174
There he is, below us!

1061
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,107
He's below us!

1062
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,708
Hold this course!

1063
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,572
He's gotta be over eight meters long!

1064
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:38,833
We need a bigger helicopter.

1065
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,802
Pull up, for Christ's sake!

1066
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:50,631
Pull up!

1067
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:51,466
I can't.

1068
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,722
The rotors are turning
as fast as they can!

1069
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:09,449
It's taking our line!

1070
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:11,816
Pull up, you idiot, pull up!

1071
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:23,494
I'm gonna shoot that motherfucker
right between his eyes.

1072
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:28,654
All right, you son of a
bitch, keep eating the line

1073
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,636
and I'll blow your fucking brains out!

1074
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:36,723
Cut the line!

1075
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,010
Cut the goddamn line!

1076
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:40,313
Oh, my god!

1077
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:59,739
We asked you to solve the problem, Sam,

1078
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,828
not create a disaster.

1079
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,582
Well, what else could I have done?

1080
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:07,547
That shark can't be taken.

1081
01:13:07,842 --> 01:13:09,628
It killed my only son.

1082
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:11,667
It's destroyed my yacht, my helicopter.

1083
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:16,548
What else can I do?

1084
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:17,851
Nothing.

1085
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:19,851
We've decided to take care

1086
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:22,979
of our business here in
Hampton bay by ourselves.

1087
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,394
What are you,

1088
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:27,399
are you saying...

1089
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,560
Hey, Sam, whatever you're thinking,

1090
01:13:29,864 --> 01:13:31,525
this isn't Chicago, you know.

1091
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,815
Listen, I brought in these
fellas to help us out.

1092
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,449
These guys are on the ball.

1093
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:37,781
They'll take care of this shark.

1094
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,741
And they can also help us sort out

1095
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,157
the situation at the aquarium.

1096
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:42,994
Listen.

1097
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:48,084
Hey, when we're done, we
won't forget you.

1098
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:49,751
You can always count on me.

1099
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:50,967
Yeah, sure.

1100
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,594
And of course, it's clear,
we'll take the $100,000 reward.

1101
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:57,589
Of course.

1102
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:58,892
Of course.

1103
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:00,143
We'll be seeing you.

1104
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:15,617
You.

1105
01:14:15,826 --> 01:14:16,906
You sent Ronnie to die

1106
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,285
because you're scared of your partners?

1107
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:23,164
I only did it for you
all, for your wellbeing.

1108
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,824
I pity you.

1109
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:25,661
Where are you going now?

1110
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,452
To warn dag soerensen.

1111
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,871
- He's the only decent...
- You're not!

1112
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,914
You're not going anywhere!

1113
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:33,218
Get up there!

1114
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,139
And you're staying locked up
in here until this is over!

1115
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,528
The Cleveland
was an oceanographic ship

1116
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:52,189
carrying a very special cargo, right?

1117
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:55,195
Yep, it ran aground on the
sand during a storm and sank.

1118
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:58,574
In exactly the same point
where we ran into trouble today.

1119
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,681
But what's the wreck
got to do with the shark?

1120
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:03,242
That ship was carrying
a shark born in captivity,

1121
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:06,283
top secret naval experiments,

1122
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,622
a death machine trained
to attack the enemy.

1123
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:13,127
Now, if the theory of
territoriality is correct,

1124
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:15,417
and I have no reason to doubt it,

1125
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,086
the wreck of the Cleveland
is where that thing lives,

1126
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:21,722
and the sea around here
is its hunting reserve.

1127
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:49,912
Here's my plan.

1128
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,440
We go down to the wreck of the Cleveland.

1129
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:53,580
We fill it with dynamite,
and we blow it to bits.

1130
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:54,417
Oh, sure.

1131
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,557
Who says the shark's
gonna be blown up with it?

1132
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,584
Well, if the territorial
theory is correct,

1133
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,048
our presence in his territory

1134
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:01,712
is gonna make him come running.

1135
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:03,342
Gloria!

1136
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:04,347
I've been looking for you everywhere.

1137
01:16:04,643 --> 01:16:05,177
My father...

1138
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:06,012
What's happened?

1139
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:07,956
Someone's trying to get
their hands on the aquarium.

1140
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,207
My father's in cahoots with them.

1141
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:09,765
They're bad people.

1142
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,066
You're in danger.

1143
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:12,936
Susy, she's all alone at the aquarium.

1144
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,612
The boss wanted us to take care of?

1145
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:27,916
That's them all right.

1146
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:28,492
What do we do?

1147
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:29,327
We follow them.

1148
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:33,040
Well, first, I wanna
have a look in there.

1149
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:45,967
Gloria and I will stay here.

1150
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,633
Bob, you stand guard on the boat.

1151
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,097
Larry, you go with him.

1152
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:51,356
Billy, go back to the
institute and get your maps.

1153
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,930
Tomorrow, we're sailing at six.

1154
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:56,442
Gloria, if you want, you can
stay the night with susy, okay?

1155
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:00,657
Hey.

1156
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:03,527
Shit!

1157
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,034
This is hot stuff.

1158
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,570
If we get there before they
do, we'll be filthy rich.

1159
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,989
But first, there's
something we've gotta do.

1160
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:19,881
Everything looks okay here.

1161
01:17:20,177 --> 01:17:21,177
Wrong!

1162
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,345
Quick, let's fix the engine.

1163
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:26,641
But what about them?

1164
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:27,851
We'll leave them here.

1165
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:29,978
Come on!

1166
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:43,700
Shit!

1167
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,300
I patched up the engine the best I can.

1168
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:29,535
Try and start her up, Larry.

1169
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,385
Shit!

1170
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,885
All right, try now.

1171
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,935
There's enough poison
here to kill an elephant.

1172
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,845
Going by the math, this is...

1173
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:56,682
Fuck!

1174
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:57,516
Be careful now.

1175
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,397
That shark's been trained by the Navy.

1176
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:00,398
You know how they do.

1177
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:01,228
Don't worry.

1178
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:02,528
I was in the marines.

1179
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,777
Oh, it figures.

1180
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,297
Goodbye, honey.

1181
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,556
Gloria will take care
of you while I'm away.

1182
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:36,969
Daddy, give that shark a
punch in the nose for me.

1183
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:37,932
You bet I will.

1184
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,232
I love you.

1185
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:44,445
Be careful.

1186
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:48,030
Whatever happens, remember, I love you.

1187
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:31,277
I'll get you, motherfucking shark!

1188
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:49,779
We're here, Larry.

1189
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:50,988
Cut the engine.

1190
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:07,535
I want you guys to be careful.

1191
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,292
If he realizes you're down there,

1192
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:10,711
he won't leave you in peace.

1193
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,920
Lay the charges quickly, light the fuses

1194
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:14,460
and get the hell outta there.

1195
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,346
God be with you, boys.

1196
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:08,424
Where's bill?

1197
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:53,886
I'll go get him.

1198
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:56,513
Yeah!

1199
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:50,733
Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please.

1200
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:52,735
Ladies and gentlemen,

1201
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:55,317
on behalf of the citizenry of Hampton bay,

1202
01:30:55,617 --> 01:31:01,283
I present this check to dag soerensen.
