1
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,913
What you want, when you want.

2
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,816
- When you want.
- KMBZ to its disposition.

3
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,878
The voice of Kansas City,
in the news.

4
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,758
Sandra Day O'Connor,
the first woman whom she integrated…

5
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,820
… the Supreme Court it presented/displayed
its letter of resignation…

6
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,196
… ending to him its race
in this court.

7
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,700
Let us go to the White House.

8
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,134
Good day.

9
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,364
I have ordered my people
that it compiles information…

10
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,738
… and it recommends, from our optics,
to potential candidates…

11
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,242
… that they interpret faithfully…

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,177
… the Constitution and the laws
of our country.

13
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,512
And I create,
that like Christian citizens…

14
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:55,543
… of this country, we must
to involve to us actively…

15
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,681
… at this moment historical.

16
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:58,757
GOD BLESSES TO THE U.S.A.

17
00:00:58,792 --> 00:00:59,918
And if in this country, the Church…

18
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,427
… the believers, are united
and they adopt a position…

19
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,089
… I believe that it would produce
a powerful one, powerful impact…

20
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,133
… in this process.

21
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,603
We do not have to fall asleep
at this moment decisive…

22
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:18,673
… because frankly, the generations
successors depend on us.

23
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,841
Let us say right now so that
the perfect will of God is fulfilled.

24
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:31,337
Today we are surrounded…

25
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:34,688
… in which they call
war of the cultures.

26
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,996
We did not initiate…

27
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:42,660
… but, by grace of God,
we will put aim to him.

28
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:44,862
And we must say: “Yes…

29
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,271
… we want to recover America
for Christ ".

30
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,126
From the pulpito,
this malintencionado message…

31
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,100
… “we against them”, it is what…

32
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,330
… the right religion
it is doing…

33
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,703
… now in the United States,
it is dividing the country.

34
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,141
- Well, we are with Tyry…
- Yes.

35
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,010
… in Hillside, Illinois,
that it listens to the WCPT.

36
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,709
What you must to say to us?

37
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:33,183
I am Christian, I am a Christian
that it believes in the Bible.

38
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,780
Of some way, these types
they do not go with the Christianity…

39
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,380
… nor with which I have learned.

40
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,155
That is to say, there is authoritarianism
in them and…

41
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,890
… there is nothing no gentile,
nor merciful…

42
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,296
… for me, they are not nothing Christian,
that is…

43
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,530
Yes. It is… It is…
It is the other way around.

44
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,662
I mean…
Yes, I am… I always…

45
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,207
… I have been Christian, and I create
that it is probably the thing…

46
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,436
… that angers to me more
of which it is happening.

47
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,308
Nothing of… Yes, nothing of this
it really has sense for me.

48
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,577
Then there is a new type
of religion there outside…

49
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,743
… somehow
the things have changed…

50
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,979
… since Mateo…
uh, wrote… uh…

51
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,420
… it wrote on the sermon
of Jesus in the mount…

52
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,220
… where Jesus said to us
that we are pacificadores.

53
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,591
And now they…
Everything what they do…

54
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,687
… and they say they do it and they say
in name of God.

55
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,289
That we must go
to the war in name of God.

56
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,926
They are saying to us
that George Bush, like no other…

57
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,869
… he is a man santo
that it has been anointed…

58
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,568
… with the task of… of…
to create a Christian society…

59
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,667
… not only in the U.S.A.,
but anywhere in the world.

60
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,577
You know… We know…
You and I know that it is a mistake.

61
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,549
East tangle of policy exists
with religion.

62
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,746
What… what lesson class
she is that for our children?

63
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:51,819
THE CAMPING DE JESUS

64
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,805
It has never had
a generation like this.

65
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,205
The Earth is filled
of died and dying…

66
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,335
… in body and spirit.

67
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,140
But now it is the moment
so that the glory…

68
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,774
… with the Gentleman the Earth covers
as the water covers the sea.

69
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,215
Now it is the moment.

70
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:15,220
We prophesied these dry bones.

71
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,314
- Elevemonos.
- Now it is the moment.

72
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,019
Hablemos the word of the Gentleman!

73
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,822
# The word of the Gentleman #

74
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,296
# The word of the Gentleman in Zion #

75
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,856
# The word of the Gentleman #

76
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,129
# The word of the Gentleman in Zion #

77
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,695
# The word of the Gentleman,
the word of the Gentleman in Zion #

78
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,765
- # Prophecy… #
- In the word of the Gentleman!

79
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,997
# Bendice the name, the generation #

80
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:45,783
# Bendice the name, the generation #

81
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,379
# Bendice the name
and the generation #

82
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:53,289
# Prophecy #

83
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,954
# We… #

84
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,194
- # Prophecy #
- He is coming!

85
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,634
# The word… #

86
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,697
- # Elevemonos #
- He will save the nation!

87
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,609
# The Gentleman in my… #

88
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,011
# Elevemonos! #

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,585
Wonderful, very well.
Thanks to come.

90
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,248
This is huge.

91
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,623
Wow!

92
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,458
It did not know how much people would come today here.

93
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,758
CONFERENCE OF INFANTILE ORATION
LEE'S SUMMIT, MISSOURI

94
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,163
They said that the audience to me
it had capacity for 500…

95
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,326
… we are making it enough good,
truth?

96
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:38,836
Very well, they listen, mothers and papas.

97
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,963
I want to tell some them of the things…

98
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,631
… that we have in the bookstore.

99
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,471
We have the Evangelical School…

100
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:46,444
… that lamentably,
so much is not sold…

101
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,413
… because people, by some reason…

102
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,177
… they create… seems to me
that they think that is…

103
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,549
… a manual of preaches at home.

104
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,248
And it is not thus.
There is a manual practitioner in the end…

105
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,087
… that teaches to them
to the boys how, eh…

106
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,821
… to initiate a conversation
with its friends…

107
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,022
… and to direct to the lost one.

108
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,999
Another thing that it wanted to announce to them…

109
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,592
… it is that our camping
it will be in August.

110
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,160
Yes.

111
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,468
And that we are going it to happen very well.

112
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,906
There are pamphlets…

113
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,534
… on the camping
waiting for them in the bookstore.

114
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,772
Single they need to choose one
and to begin to pray…

115
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,577
… on if they can arrive
or not there this year.

116
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,514
In agreement? Small and small!

117
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,075
All good seated,
the together hands…

118
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,485
… the smiling faces
watching towards here.

119
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,580
Hay somebody creates here…

120
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,420
… that God can make any thing?

121
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,722
God can do something!
Let us say: “ God, fixes the world”.

122
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:45,432
How many of you you know
that this it is an old and ill world?

123
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,473
This it is an old and ill world.

124
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,168
Then, we are going to fix it!

125
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,473
That somebody serve its tools…

126
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,446
… and we fix this old world!

127
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,177
Boys, we must change the things.

128
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,051
We have too many Christian adults…

129
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,056
… fat and sluggish.

130
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,456
They do not want to resign to its supper…

131
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,052
… they do not want to ayunar during 3 days…

132
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,892
… or 40 days or what is.

133
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,766
Saben that the Muslims
they train his children…

134
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,702
… from the 5 years of age…

135
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,331
… to ayunar during the month of the Ramadan?

136
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:29,080
Listen, we have the keys.

137
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,914
We can change the world.

138
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,249
The boys can change the world?

139
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,982
By all means.

140
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,321
By all means!

141
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:46,127
Pongamonos standing up.
# Aleluya #

142
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,395
I need are taken in serious,
that they take in serious God.

143
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,027
- They say: “God…”
- God…

144
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,661
“I am here for training to me”.

145
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:53,738
I am here for training to me.

146
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,831
“I am here for educating to me. ”

147
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,739
I am here for educating to me.

148
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,370
- “I am arranged, God. ”
- I am arranged, God.

149
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,414
“I will do what you want that does. ”

150
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,143
I will do what you want that does.

151
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,583
“I will say what you want that it says. ”

152
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,483
I will say what you want that it says.

153
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,114
- “In the name of Jesus…”
- In the name of Jesus…

154
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,987
- “Amen”.
- Amen.

155
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,763
If they do not open its mouths…

156
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,197
… the Spirit Santo will not speak.

157
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,167
, I want that all very well
raise its hands…

158
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,828
… and we will say in other languages.

159
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,462
Aleluya, we do it.

160
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,473
Oh, we loved to you, Jesus.

161
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,005
Sir.

162
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,108
Spirit Santo, sees.
Spirit Santo!

163
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,847
Feel its power.
Feel its power.

164
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,786
Let us speak a new language.

165
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,915
The Spirit Santo whispers to us
to the ear what to say.

166
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,687
Does not stop! Does not stop!

167
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,665
This it is the hugest day
of its lives…

168
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,167
… the day of your salvation.

169
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,052
It is not in critical moment,
it is not outside control…

170
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,493
… he is very conscious of which it happens.

171
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,087
It is connected the spirit…

172
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,223
… single it is concentrated.

173
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:34,869
Becky Fischer
he is infantile pentecostal minister.

174
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:41,108
It organizes conferences and a camping
of annual summer for evangelistas children.

175
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,454
I go to playgrounds
where there are children…

176
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,048
… that does not know anything
on the Christianity…

177
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,889
… I guide them towards the Gentleman
in a matter of…

178
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,193
… very just a short time,
and… and at few moments…

179
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,699
… they are having visions
and listening to the voice of God…

180
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,234
… because they are open.

181
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,793
They are very usable in the Christianity.

182
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,004
If we considered
the population of the world…

183
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,676
… one third part
of 6,700 million people…

184
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,949
… they are young minors of 15 years,
the third part.

185
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,723
Where we must put
our efforts?

186
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,589
In what we would have to be concentrated?

187
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,458
I will say to you in what they are concentrated
our enemies…

188
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,497
… in the children.

189
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,090
They penetrate in the schools.
Veto to Palestine…

190
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,498
… and I can show to you
some Web sites…

191
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,231
… that would shake completely
your foundations…

192
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,432
… and I can show to you
photos of where they take…

193
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,067
… to its children, like us
we took them campings to Biblical…

194
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,270
… they put grenades to them in the hands…

195
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,245
… they teach to them to put themselves
belt-pump…

196
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,009
… they teach to them to use guns…

197
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,879
… they teach to them to use machine guns…

198
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,919
… it is not to be strange,
that with that type of…

199
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,045
… intensive training
and disciplined…

200
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,022
… those young people are
arranged to commit suicide…

201
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,785
… by the cause of the Islam.

202
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,264
I want to see young people
so it jeopardize with the cause…

203
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,700
… of Jesus Christ

204
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,466
like those young people
they are with the Islam.

205
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,133
I want to see give them
its lives of a radical way…

206
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:20,542
… to the Gospel like…
since they do it in Pakistan…

207
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,911
… in Israel and… and Palestine…

208
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,816
… and in so many other places,
because we have…

209
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,478
… disculpame,
but we have the truth!

210
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,124
I would say that there is surroundings
more cosy now…

211
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,321
… in the United States
towards the Christianity…

212
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,387
… del that has had in all my life…

213
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,797
… and it has to do much,
in recent years…

214
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,596
… it has to do with president Bush.

215
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,832
It has brought true credibility…

216
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,204
… to the Christian faith.
It very has been opened…

217
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,368
… obviously open,
on its faith in God.

218
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,608
Today, exactly now,
a prophecy is being fulfilled.

219
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:04,179
We must raise to us
and to recover the nation.

220
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,254
Listen,
single it wanted to know them better.

221
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,231
- You came with Mark, truth?
- Yes.

222
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,530
And he are its shepherd?
But is not relatives of him?

223
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,602
- Truth?
- No

224
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,036
It will not come
to our east camping summer.

225
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,164
You also come?

226
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,571
- To Dakota of the North?
- To Dakota of the North.

227
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,973
- Yes.
- Vienen? Brilliant.

228
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,944
Viene all the family

229
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:28,570
- I believe that single we.
- Wonderful!

230
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:29,671
With my brother, my twin brother.

231
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,614
I want to know more on you.

232
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,345
How much does that they are Christian?

233
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,785
I became Christian, when she had…

234
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,686
-… to the 5 years they saved to me.
- Yes?

235
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,157
Because I tried more of the life.

236
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,887
- Yes?
- And there was nothing…

237
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,189
… that outside amused…

238
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,730
To the 5 years you thought
that there was nothing no amused?

239
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,857
- Yes. To the 5 years.
- In serious? Oh, in serious?

240
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,992
How you think that it will be
this camping?

241
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,195
What delays?

242
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,931
What hope that God does by you?

243
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,563
What I hope that God does by me?

244
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,632
- Yes, in the camping?
- I think… Oh, in the camping!

245
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,646
In the camping,
I believe that God goes to me to, you you know…

246
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,841
… to be used to to me knowing another people…

247
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,281
… because I have difficulties for that.

248
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,785
- I do not create it.
- I am timid.

249
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,912
You are timid? I cannot believe it.

250
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,890
Except with the things
that they pass in the Spirit Santo.

251
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,391
Yes, in that you are not for anything timid.

252
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,087
- No
- Oh, you are brilliant.

253
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,993
- Esteem much that has come.
- It is well.

254
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,621
I am glad to return to see them in summer.

255
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,632
Dame a hug. Very well.

256
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,668
Enchanted of conocerte, Terrene.
Enchanted of conocerte, Levi.

257
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:24,964
- We were already spoken.
- Very well.

258
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,868
Very well, good bye, good bye.

259
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:35,575
The evangelistas create
that to be saved…

260
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:40,948
… they must “return to be born”
accepting to Jesus like its rescuer.

261
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:51,525
A 43% of the evangelistas Christians
“they return to be born” before the 13 years.

262
00:13:55,467 --> 00:14:00,467
Encontremonos in my house Sunday
before the party. - God

263
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,584
Moment of creation, garden of the Eden…

264
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:22,684
… it does about 6000 years approximately.

265
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,525
Was a this explosion?

266
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,568
Venimos from pegote viscous?

267
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,570
Argh! Argh!

268
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,868
I do not create it.

269
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,537
One says that we are
the result of an explosion…

270
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:47,075
… is this truth? Is scientist?

271
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:51,020
Or is based single on a belief?

272
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,889
Levi, sees here.

273
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,824
I need that you approach.

274
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,365
It is well, we review some things.

275
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,060
To analyze the creation
with physical sciences

276
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:06,127
Something frequents that they do
the American politicians…

277
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,935
… it is to remarcar that the summers
in the United States…

278
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,772
… they are hotter
in the last years.

279
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,642
Like result,
the climatic change must be real.

280
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,648
What there is of erroneous
in this reasoning?

281
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:21,880
- That single increased 0.6 degrees.
- Ah.

282
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,252
Yes, it is not really
a great problem, no?

283
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:28,089
No. I do not believe that that
get to harm to us.

284
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,459
It is… It is a great political subject,
the climatic change.

285
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,555
And that is what really
you must…

286
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,259
-… to understand…
- The evolution also?

287
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,394
- Um, not much. At the most…
- The creacionismo?

288
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,166
Um, is becoming now.

289
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,731
What happens if you go to a school
where the teacher says…

290
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,436
… that the creacionismo is stupid…

291
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,445
… and you are stupid if you believe in that?

292
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,243
- I believe that they must… Yes.
- Well?

293
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,284
Or, what happens if you go to a school…

294
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,876
… where the teacher says
that the evolution is stupid…

295
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,546
… and you are a stupid one
if you believe in that?

296
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,386
- It would not matter to me.
- It would not matter to you.

297
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,323
If sights the creacionismo…

298
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,759
… it give account you of which it is
the only possible answer…

299
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,196
-… to all the questions.
- He is right what papa says.

300
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,996
It is the only answer
possible to all the questions.

301
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,128
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, yes.

302
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,498
Yes.

303
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,103
Entendiste the part where it says that…

304
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,511
… science nontest nothing? Ja!

305
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,209
And he is very interesting
when it sights of that form.

306
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,284
- It is It.
- It is It.

307
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,149
- Very well!
- Very well.

308
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,587
I personally believe that Galileo
he made the correct decision…

309
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,421
… when leaving science by Christ.

310
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,850
75% of the children educated in house
in EE.UU they are Christian evangelical.

311
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,299
God did not say that it had children…

312
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:52,868
… and one occurred them person to another
during 8 hours to the day.

313
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,278
And if I can teach to them in house…

314
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:59,784
… as well as it does
the state school…

315
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,788
… so that to send them to another part
8 hours to the day?

316
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:07,104
Our nation was founded…

317
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:10,352
… on judeocristianos values.

318
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,091
We know that when the things
they began to change…

319
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,157
… it was let pray in the schools, and…

320
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,999
… ah… the schools
they began to come down.

321
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,902
And now we say:

322
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,840
“Delay a minute,
where it is my country “.

323
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,006
Let us create firmly that…

324
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,911
… there are two types of people
in the world.

325
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,076
Those that they love Jesus and those that no.

326
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,677
And I want that my children grow
saying: “ Sabes what?

327
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,587
“To be Christian he is something good”.

328
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,093
… Matthew Spalding, our guest.

329
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,997
Tomorrow, Glenn Thomas
he will give a direct testimony us…

330
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,534
… of marines
involved Christians…

331
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,002
… in the Operation Freedom for Iraq…

332
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,833
… of its book God Saw Them Through.

333
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,065
Tomorrow he will be very interesting…

334
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,369
… we will see ourselves again here.

335
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,602
… # in center #

336
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:09,510
So that they teach to the children
that the global heating does not exist?

337
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,853
It is well, so that?
Watch, mistreat this world…

338
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,053
… they violate this earth,
take everything what they want of her…

339
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,153
… because, knows what?
It does not have importance.

340
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,164
We will not be long time here.

341
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:23,065
Christ will come stops
to take to us of the Earth…

342
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,832
… so they cut the trees,
use all petroleum…

343
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,465
… and they take advantage of everything
what the Earth offers to us.

344
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,475
For that reason one listens to them become jumbled…

345
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,909
… in subjects like
the global heating.

346
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,810
And… and… and… you want to shake them.

347
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,178
And to say to them: “ What… what…

348
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,773
… what is what you do not understand…

349
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,819
… of the foundations of the Christianity?

350
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,821
… By…? How you arrived here “.

351
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:46,483
Our president continues saying to him
to the Americans…

352
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,585
… that we must teach
creacionismo in the schools.

353
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:55,099
That we must teach it
at he himself level that the evolution.

354
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,397
I believe that we have become
very complacientes in this…

355
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,437
… and I believe that they are obtaining…

356
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,336
… exactly what they want.

357
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,533
Sabes what it is happening in Kansas?

358
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,940
Yes, I know it. I saw.

359
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,342
They must teach intelligent design…

360
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,346
… on a par of the evolution of Darwin.

361
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,881
Good, we think about that.

362
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:15,010
It is being lain to 600,000 children.

363
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,988
There is no conflict between both things.

364
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,182
- Good, not…
- That is religion…

365
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,725
… it is not science.

366
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,626
We have a population,
25% of the population of the U.S.A.…

367
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:28,257
… now, it is described itself
like evangelista.

368
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,166
Eh… this is near…
80 million people.

369
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,898
They are very perseverantes
and they lay way…

370
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,667
… until positions of being able in the U.S.A.

371
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,507
That is modus operandi
of… of… of a group…

372
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,274
… that…
it jeopardizes, as I say…

373
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,612
… to construct a government
with which they feel comfortable.

374
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,448
In the end it will be like a thief
at night.

375
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,080
They are crushing slowly…

376
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,319
… the separation between the Church
and the State.

377
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,387
“Jesus died, was buried…

378
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,254
… and three days later,
It rose of between deads.

379
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:32,161
… was not single Jesus a man?
No, Jesus Christ…

380
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,096
… it is All-powerful God ".

381
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,258
- Rachael?
- Rachael?

382
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,201
- Rachael, is your turn.
- I know It.

383
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,431
- Ahead, Rachael.
- We go, Rach, you do a plenary session.

384
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,065
Yes, yes.
Haz a plenary session this time!

385
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,476
Jesus Christ…

386
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,915
… your spirit will help me…

387
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,647
… to that this it is a good shot.

388
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:59,817
Ball, I order to you in name of Jesus…

389
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,518
… that leaves a good shot to me.

390
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,561
Is well, Rachael!

391
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,758
- Of this side, strips.
- It is well.

392
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,368
It follows thus. It continues making that curve.

393
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,872
It tries to begin a little more down.

394
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,743
- Hello.
- Hello.

395
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,347
God finishes saying to me that He…
that you are in his mind…

396
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,450
… and that wants llevarte
and that It wants…

397
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:40,260
… amarte, and that has plans
special for your life…

398
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,163
… and that It wants…

399
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,327
… that you can follow it
yet your heart.

400
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,770
- Mm, thanks.
- Don't mention it.

401
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,507
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

402
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:54,340
You made plenary sessions?

403
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,116
Guau! It dresses her
and right you felt that…

404
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,712
… God said to you that you were.

405
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,224
Yes, I waited for a little,
you know, to be safe…

406
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,283
-… you understand what I say?
- You felt It in your heart?

407
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,330
Aha. And later I felt
that it had chosen the indicated person.

408
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,729
Very well. Good work, Rachael.

409
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,859
It tries to be obedient.

410
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,897
I am like a priest of bowling.
Taking that.

411
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,813
When it grows, single I…

412
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,441
… I always thought
that he would be amused to be…

413
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,713
… of those people
that they paint the nails and others…

414
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:36,787
Rachael
9 years

415
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,256
… because it could have the opportunity
to speak to them on the Gentleman.

416
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:42,157
That is, calm,
Christian music of bottom…

417
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,058
… already you know, doing it,
you understand what I say?

418
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,858
He would be very relajante…

419
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,024
… and in certain way…

420
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,467
… they would not have so many, so many
walls then, you know…

421
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,801
… and they could accept it, you know?

422
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,932
Several times have made fun of of me…

423
00:22:57,008 --> 00:23:00,273
… and… and I have said myself to same me:

424
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,870
“ The decision of a man? He is not nothing.

425
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,542
The decision of God, is something ".

426
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:08,085
Creen that I am rare? It is well.

427
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,087
You are not the one who will judge…

428
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,556
… if I must go to the sky or hell.
God will be it.

429
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,923
The important thing is what
He thinks of me…

430
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:19,088
… It… does not matter what you think.

431
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:26,562
JESUS WILL COME SOON! THE SIN
IT BRINGS DEATH, GOD BRINGS ETERNAL LIFE.

432
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,019
This is my favorite part.

433
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,528
Guau!

434
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,481
My type of favorite music is like…

435
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,318
… heavy metal,
a rock and roll Christian.

436
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,621
It is centered in its bases…
aiming towards Jesus…

437
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,491
… e, even, some
of the subjects they do not say…

438
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:28,226
… “Jesus” or “our Gentleman”
or… things thus…

439
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,097
… but they have a Christian base…

440
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:34,468
… and they are focused towards Him,
and for that reason I like.

441
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:40,275
Um, and… but as much Britney Spears
like Lindsay Lohan…

442
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,073
… and another people of the sort…

443
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,581
… definitively they do not matter to me…

444
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,517
… because all its songs
they are based mainly…

445
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,748
… or in boys or girls…

446
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:54,053
… and, um… we,
like Christians, not…

447
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,752
… good, I do not believe in that.

448
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,226
- Victory?
- Yes?

449
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,199
You must finish in 5 minutes…

450
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,896
-… because you must have lunch.
- Yes.

451
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,839
When I dance I must
to assure to me that there it is God…

452
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,308
… because people will realize…

453
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,368
… when single I dance with the body.

454
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:19,110
And sometimes I do it, I admit it…

455
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,446
MY PAPA IS IN THE ARMY

456
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,578
… and really I need to surpass it.

457
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:26,055
I am not…
I am not the unique one that does…

458
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,423
People… You are not the unique one…

459
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,689
… that commits that error.

460
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:32,763
I have to Jesus in the heart

461
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,255
That you want a galletita?
It takes a galletita.

462
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,001
Very well. It is well.

463
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,764
First we say the oration
of loyalty…

464
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:44,332
… now that we are all…
before continuing.

465
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,810
Jenny? Christian?
Could be stopped, please?

466
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,369
- It is well.
- It is well.

467
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:52,644
I promise loyalty
to the Christian fight…

468
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,050
… to El Salvador whose kingdom stays.

469
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:01,550
Our brotherhood unites to the Christians
in unit and love.

470
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,651
It is well, we touched the Bible.

471
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:06,390
Right of perpetual ownership loyalty to the Bible…

472
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,897
… to the sagrada word of God.

473
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,298
It will be a lamp for my feet…

474
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,302
… and a light for my way.

475
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,167
I will hide its words in my heart…

476
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,402
… so that it cannot sin
against God.

477
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,375
Very well, all.

478
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,706
I see it I took root, and George also…

479
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,306
… our children
they are a loan of God to us…

480
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,851
… and someday we go
to have to respond before God…

481
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,887
… by the form in which we raised them.

482
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,391
I say: “Sir,
you have given this daughter me…

483
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,586
… and, how one assumes
that I must train it?

484
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:39,494
What assumes that I must do now “

485
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,829
I bring it to places
where it can learn it…

486
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,870
… of Becky, the Shepherd Carol,
of different people.

487
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,405
But the Gentleman said to me
that what I must train…

488
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,600
… it is its character.

489
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,203
Where you go?

490
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,270
I am going away to stop under rain.

491
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,781
It is well.

492
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,680
Very well, already you stopped yourself under rain.

493
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,548
- I still did not get wet.
- Well, I do not want…

494
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,588
… that you are soaked.

495
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,253
Victory, dates return
and it enters right now. Thanks.

496
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,628
8, 9, 10. They had to me to fall
10 drops of rain…

497
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,896
-… because I am 10 years old.
- You are very graceful.

498
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,062
Guau, we go.

499
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:30,972
Tori?

500
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,347
Well, we are going to empacar your things, we go.

501
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:40,353
I do not know how, but we are preparing ourselves
for the camping.

502
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,156
Tori, we must take
stock-market to sleep…

503
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,959
… the Bible, a pen
and a notebook.

504
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,192
The lantern, oh…

505
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,962
The things for the dance
of “they breathe prophesy”.

506
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,036
Yes!

507
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,901
It is well, you found the mesh?

508
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,999
It looks for in your… Yes, it looks for there.

509
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,952
In 2001, the shepherd Becky Fischer
she inaugurated the summer camping…

510
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,393
… “Young to red the alive one” in Devil's Lake,
Dakota of the North.

511
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:23,962
They attend evangelistas families
of all the country.

512
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:46,947
We are going to walk in…
between the banks and others…

513
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:50,392
… and… we will say for the chairs. Yes.

514
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,760
Yes, in the name of Jesus, we prayed by…

515
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,800
… each person who feels
in these chairs during this week…

516
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,266
… and we… Sir, we requested to you…

517
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,428
… that covers the blood to us with Jesus…

518
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,768
… that you open the hearts, Sir,
that you open the hearts.

519
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,607
Father, we prayed by
the electrical system…

520
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,545
… we requested to you that the light
it is not cut in this building…

521
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,047
… in name of Jesus…

522
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,017
… it is by storms
or for some other reason.

523
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,679
Now I am going to request by this equipment…

524
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,950
… by the presentations
in PowerPoint…

525
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,923
… the video projectors…

526
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,119
… and we say: “Demon,
we know what you like to do…

527
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,661
… in meetings like this ".

528
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,459
And we say:
“You will not do it in name of Jesus.

529
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,626
You will not avoid
that this message is transmitted…

530
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,535
… there will be no problems with the microphone
in name of Jesus ".

531
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,835
We say that, in name of Jesus.

532
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,006
Father, we asked to you you,
All-powerful Jesus…

533
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,279
… that this is a little while
decisive in its lives.

534
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:51,345
Father, I request that Jesus
be glorified in this camping.

535
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,147
You cannot enter there.

536
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,653
Billy, you cannot go there.

537
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,763
It is well. I am so…

538
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,321
This exhausts to me.

539
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,985
# Ah, yes #

540
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,499
# Nacio, was born, was born, was born, was born! #

541
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:14,402
# He was born of a virgin
call Maria the day of Christmas #

542
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,999
# He bled and died in the cross
in order to free to us of sin #

543
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,373
# High Tomalo #

544
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,309
# Tomalo under #

545
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,314
# Toma to J.C where it wants that you go #

546
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,215
# Now tell me, who is in the house? #

547
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,254
- J.C.!
# Dime who is in the house #

548
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,754
- We go.
- J.C.!

549
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:35,281
# Who is in the house? #
- J.C.!

550
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,560
# Jesus Christ is in the house today #

551
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,231
# When It is in your life
you want to dance #

552
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,861
# Saltemos, we jump by Christ #

553
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:49,464
# Bailemos, hears, friend.
Let us jump by Christ #

554
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,600
# Bailemos. Let us jump by Christ #

555
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,840
# Where you are? Let us dance.
Let us jump by Christ #

556
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,007
# I say, this is Jesus Christ #

557
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,380
# Who is in the house today #

558
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:04,217
Demonos a great one, great applause.

559
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,258
- Is well?
- Good night.

560
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,815
Vinieron!

561
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,996
What seems to them my hairdo?

562
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,132
And the nails?

563
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,169
The eyebrows?

564
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,637
And what reduces of me.

565
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:28,343
This week we will speak
of how the devil…

566
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:32,247
… it uses tactics to destroy
our lives.

567
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,013
The first tactics that use…

568
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,646
… he is tentarte to the sin.

569
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,728
Mainly when he is young…

570
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,065
… because it is indeed
when all these things begin.

571
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,536
When one is young,
the sin does not seem to be…

572
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,334
… something very important.

573
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,570
It seems something attractive, in fact
something likeable, fleecy.

574
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,079
But the sin is planned
for destruirte.

575
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,285
And you feed that baby
during long time…

576
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,592
… and it is growing in your life…

577
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,930
… until you see yourself in hardships…

578
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,993
… and you do not know how arreglartelas…

579
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,105
… and what it seemed to them very innocent…

580
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,733
… now it controls its lives.

581
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,581
The devil goes in search of the young people.

582
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,088
Of that they cannot
to fix them to it single.

583
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,682
For that reason we want to help them…

584
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,126
… we want to warn to them.

585
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,499
And speaking of that…

586
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,636
… I will say to something on Harry Potter to them.

587
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,704
The wizards are enemy of God!

588
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,111
And it does not matter to me what type of heroes is.

589
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,478
They are enemy of God…

590
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,948
… and if there were been
in the Old Testament…

591
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,815
… Potter would have occurred to death to Harry.

592
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,980
Amen!

593
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,795
The wizards are not heroes.

594
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,965
This is a generation
that it will be raised by the purity…

595
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,763
… the rectitud and the sanctity…

596
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:35,237
… and that will serve the Gentleman
every day of its life.

597
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:37,570
And we declared
all those things on you.

598
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:44,539
I believe that I have dedicated all my life…

599
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,243
… to assure to me
of which you obtain it.

600
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:58,157
Tonight I feel in my heart
what the Gentleman says…

601
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,026
… that are some boys here…

602
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,588
… that claims to be Christian…

603
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,156
… that always goes to the church…

604
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,065
… but that is a thing
when they go to the church…

605
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,865
… and another thing…

606
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,030
… when they are in the school
with its friends…

607
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,233
… they are false and hypocritical.

608
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,900
They make things that would not have to do…

609
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,774
… they are malhablados
just as other boys.

610
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,145
It is the hour to clean its acts.

611
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,377
Come here and you are washed.

612
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,817
Because we cannot have hypocrites
in the army of God.

613
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,988
If that you are, pon the hands here.

614
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,224
Oh, boy, wash your hands.

615
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,665
Father, we finished washing itself
with the water of your word.

616
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:41,000
We will not say nothing else, Demon.
Nothing else.

617
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:44,041
Say, boys and girls,
in the name of Jesus.

618
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:46,668
They know exactly
what they must regret.

619
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,338
Says it! Say it aloud.

620
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,610
Say it,
what they need to be pardoned?

621
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:56,813
# Oh- oh… Oh- oh… #

622
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:01,382
# Oh- oh… Oh- oh… #

623
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,986
Not more stupidities,
not more hipocresia.

624
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,393
Now you arrived at a place and you say…

625
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,728
… and you begin to feel
repentance here.

626
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:13,133
# Oh- oh… Oh- oh #

627
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:32,852
Uh… I… uh…
I do not have much to say.

628
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:36,484
Single I… wanted
to speak on the belief in God…

629
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:41,758
… and I have been a long time
doing this and…

630
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,796
… it is quite difficult to do this…

631
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,104
… exactly to believe in God
it is quite difficult…

632
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:55,839
… because we do not see it,
not… not…

633
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,778
… one does not know much of Him.

634
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:02,649
Sometimes not even I create
what it is written in the Bible.

635
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,918
It seems to me a lie,
and I feel like culprit…

636
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:11,655
… and badly because… God always
it has spoken to me on that…

637
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,594
… of how I have rejected it.

638
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:13,249
Bu!

639
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:21,664
It is one pretty small house.

640
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:24,599
Ahhh!

641
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,669
Ah…

642
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:29,129
- Somebody died.
- Ah… what fear.

643
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:31,174
In the dark, dark house
there was the dark, dark corridor.

644
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,301
The dark, dark corridor
it took to the dark, dark quarter.

645
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,072
In the dark, dark quarter
there was the dark, dark stairs.

646
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,671
Ay.

647
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,740
- Is all laid down?
- I no.

648
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,548
- It is well.
- I will not do it…

649
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,249
I will not make that history
of ghosts, in agreement?

650
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,316
Some very are amused,
but they do not award honor to God…

651
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,827
… and, uh, already you know,
God says that you concentrate yourself…

652
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,491
… in those things that are…
that they are true…

653
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,227
… and in those things that have beauty.

654
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:01,738
That you concentrate yourself in the good things
and the things of God, in agreement?

655
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,139
Here we go.
Lights extinguished, boys.

656
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:27,061
- To what time is it the breakfast?
- To eight.

657
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:29,292
I have the hair still wet.

658
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,062
God created the humans…

659
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,604
… that ate of
Tree of the Knowledge.

660
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:38,199
The good and badly
sin and death were in.

661
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:41,938
I have something drips blood
here in some place.

662
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,350
There, this is better.

663
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,887
And now I move these letters.

664
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,391
Thus it is better.

665
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,518
This generation in individual…

666
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,119
… it is the generation
of the Vista and the sound…

667
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,527
… and for that reason it is to them very difficult…

668
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,761
… to seat with a book,
a tablet and a pencil…

669
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,893
… and to try to learn of the form
that we have learned.

670
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:08,495
They learn visually,
by demonstration…

671
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,063
… they learn it…
modeling and all that.

672
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,633
Then, they are ours here
Adam and Eva, is not brilliant?

673
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,145
And like with the dolls
of Ken and Barbie of before…

674
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:18,909
… we taught to them how
they walked and they spoke…

675
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:21,213
… in the garden of the Eden with God…

676
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,549
… but when God
it insufflated his breath in the man…

677
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:26,556
… in its orifices,
the breath of the life…

678
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,925
Then the man
one becomes a living soul.

679
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:33,987
Now I say to them to the children…

680
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,032
… that if they want to become
in stronger Christians…

681
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,625
… and to have a human spirit
more fort…

682
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,431
… they must make certain things.

683
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,354
If they say to newspaper…

684
00:40:43,355 --> 00:40:46,204
… his spirit will fortify itself.

685
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:50,304
If they go to the church
and they learn more about God…

686
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,973
… his spirit will fortify itself.

687
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,075
If you do not read the Bible…

688
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:56,813
We go, will be debilitated.

689
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,718
Ah, a failed globe.

690
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,386
Your spirit will be debilitated.

691
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,518
Then…

692
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,788
For example,
we have a brain mold…

693
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,329
… because one of the sessions
it is going to be…

694
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,989
… to speak on our minds…

695
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,260
… and how they need to nourish itself
of the word of God.

696
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,302
It is amused, because
you can make a mold of gelatin…

697
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,734
… that seems a brain.

698
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,967
And when we say how the things
they stick to our brains…

699
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,100
… and we used these sticky fingers…

700
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:22,543
… then this will represent
the dirty things…

701
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,444
… this could represent
to oath promises…

702
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,575
… this to things
that we have seen in tele…

703
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:31,314
… or what outside that we listened,
and one sticks to our minds…

704
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,548
… and soon we must strike them.

705
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,318
- In the brain?
- Yes.

706
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,983
I do not know if it is a blow…
if one is going away to beat very well…

707
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,426
… but, one is sticking there.

708
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,624
This sticks to the brain
and he is very effective for the children.

709
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,860
That is to say, we have many
different things.

710
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:45,492
What I do is to give a return…

711
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,366
… by jugueterias…

712
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,338
… and I see something and I think:

713
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:54,241
“This could be used for… ”.
Then…

714
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:57,474
… I enter with 20 classes of objects
and prayer by one hour…

715
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,483
… you know, and people…
Other ministers of children say:

716
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,609
“ Rezar during one hour to the children”.

717
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,380
And they feel pity by the children.

718
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,115
It does not have so that
to feel pity by my children.

719
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,850
They know very well, you know…

720
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:10,018
… they know that are obtaining it,
they are obtaining it.

721
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,828
# I have Jesus, and you?
I have Jesus, and you? #

722
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,493
# I have Jesus, yes,
I have Jesus, and you? #

723
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:21,470
# I have Jesus, I yes,
I have Jesus, and you? #

724
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,600
# I have Jesus, yes,
I have Jesus, and you? #

725
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,975
# 1, 2, 3, 4,
I have Jesus, and you? #

726
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,413
Is prepared?
We are going to say again.

727
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:37,443
Very well! God, we are thankful to you
the food this morning.

728
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,455
We requested to you, Father, who you bless it…

729
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:43,687
… and suplicamos Mr. Jesus, you
your blood on our sins…

730
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,752
… and the sins of our nation.

731
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:50,061
God, finishes with the abortion
and beam that the U.S.A. appears again.

732
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,694
Thanks, Jesus, amen.

733
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:56,206
Mother, is not looked like Harry Potter?

734
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,537
Mother, he looks itself like Harry Potter.

735
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,635
- A little, yes.
- Delay a little while.

736
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,781
I cannot see it, because it has witchcrafts.

737
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,411
Yes… My mother does not want that she sees
none of the films…

738
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,921
… for that reason of the witchcraft,
but I see them in the one of my papa.

739
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:19,894
Becky Fischer.

740
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,297
Becky Fischer,
live and in colors?

741
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,358
It watches my new hairdo.

742
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,767
It will be the cover of number one…

743
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:30,773
… of Children's Ministry,
that it will leave in April.

744
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,366
It is almost like being
in the cover of Rolling Stones.

745
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,444
There we are.

746
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,352
Until now, the camping
he has been wonderful.

747
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,760
I adore to be in the presence of God.

748
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:08,141
God is not in all the churches,
that is to say, that…

749
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:10,442
There are some… There are certain churches…

750
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,947
… the calls dead churches…

751
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:15,076
… where people feel.

752
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:22,050
# We venerated to You, God,
we venerated to you, God #

753
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,890
They sing three songs
and soon they listen to a sermon.

754
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,658
The churches to which God wants
that we go they are those where…

755
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,291
… people jump, shouts her name…

756
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:33,268
… and they say Him to him.
They are not acting…

757
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,670
… they are not quiet…
# To You we venerated #

758
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,740
They are… Aleluya! God!
You already know, and…

759
00:44:42,934 --> 00:44:47,784
… and depending on how…
they invite It…

760
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,183
… it goes to be there or no.

761
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:57,153
V I c t Or r I To,
this it is the troyano shout military.

762
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,661
V I c t Or r I To,
this it is the troyano shout military.

763
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,587
I have my Bible.

764
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,820
They said to me that it went
to read a sermon tonight.

765
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,763
It enchants to me to read sermons to them to the children.

766
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,356
I have never preached
in front of a group of children…

767
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,458
… that I do not know.

768
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,570
I feel, that is to say, I feel…

769
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:51,410
… I feel that we are
a key generation, in serious.

770
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,447
I feel that…

771
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,419
that this generation
it is a key generation…

772
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,979
… so that Jesus returns.

773
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,756
This is exactly what I mean.

774
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,499
I do not write the sermon,
God writes the sermon.

775
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,366
I mean, that I feel
sometimes when I am writing…

776
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,837
… I feel it in my arm…

777
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:19,706
… somebody maintains my arm
when I am writing, truth?

778
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,245
And I feel when I go there
and I begin to preach…

779
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,678
… that the Spirit Santo
he is going to leave me.

780
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:28,013
And… it is not that it puts to me
to me to preach there…

781
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:31,646
… but that she is as if not outside I.

782
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:41,120
We cannot remain
seated all the day…

783
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:43,189
… because Satan will come to look for to us.

784
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:45,565
It is not seated either.

785
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,662
If Satan is not seated
you would not have quedarte seated.

786
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,469
Satan will deal with sacarte of your way…

787
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,136
… of your race, your course…

788
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,145
You do not leave does that.

789
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,841
In the name of Jesus,
you do not leave Satan removes to you…

790
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,077
… of the way that God
it has reserved to you.

791
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,712
We are a generation
that it needs to revolt…

792
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:07,552
… that needs to revolt
and advertirte on the time…

793
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:11,116
… advertirte with our heart,
yet what we have.

794
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,992
Yes!

795
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:23,529
Now, who is prepared
in order to amuse itself tonight?

796
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:29,738
You will not be the same person…

797
00:47:29,813 --> 00:47:31,041
… after this camping…

798
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,376
… you will be a different person…

799
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:34,849
… you will be radical, you will be to red the alive one.

800
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,878
How many of you you want
to be of that they give…

801
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:40,150
… its lives by Jesus?

802
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,131
I have my old and sacred one
ghost hammer tonight.

803
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,173
We are going to break some things
in the heights tonight.

804
00:47:57,241 --> 00:48:00,301
We are going to break the power
of the enemy in the government.

805
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,242
They enter your schools and…

806
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,779
… they remove to Jesus from your school…

807
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:04,905
… but there is something cannot do…

808
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,917
… and it is to remove to Jesus from your heart.

809
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:11,216
We cannot remain seated
and to accept a corrupt government.

810
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:12,585
I believe that God wants to put…

811
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,715
… pious and right people in the government.

812
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,316
How many of you
they want to break this glass?

813
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,692
The one of the power of the enemy
in the government.

814
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,293
To break this glass.

815
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,035
Break this thing
in name of Jesus.

816
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:34,942
The glass of the government just
by a government just.

817
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,477
Sir, sees protect
that government just.

818
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:44,654
Whenever you break a glass…

819
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,519
… there is a liberation in the spirit.

820
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,027
We break the power of the devil
in this nation.

821
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,058
In name of Jesus, one has gone away.

822
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:58,499
Strong Griten, shouts strong!
Quiero oirlos!

823
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,659
… we break its bottom.

824
00:49:02,759 --> 00:49:06,874
Fire in the world! In the world!

825
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:18,618
Jesus!

826
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,635
Tighten, boys, you tighten.

827
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:37,504
One does not treat like in McDonald's
of how fast raisins…

828
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:42,574
… by the car service.

829
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:44,237
If you want something of God…

830
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,942
… you are going to have to cook a little.

831
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:54,381
You need to leave it in the pot…

832
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:58,224
… to cook it to untimed fire
in the sacred ghost.

833
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:04,833
God touched to you tonight,
I want to hear that.

834
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:08,064
Somebody wine to say to me what happened.

835
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,166
- It says, Tori.
- It says.

836
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:12,902
It takes the microphone…

837
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,001
Sir, prayer stops
that he changes our nation…

838
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:18,411
… and we break the bows
that they have put to us…

839
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:22,885
… and… and we
we proclaimed to Leon de Judas.

840
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,630
It takes these prophecies…

841
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,731
… and you do what the apostle Pablo
it said, hazles the war.

842
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,148
This means war!

843
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:05,423
This means war!
This means war!

844
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:09,024
You are part of that or no?

845
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,065
- Excuse, I like to throw stones.
- It is well, Levi.

846
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,002
It is well, Levi.

847
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,442
When I know
to somebody nonChristian…

848
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:58,174
… you know, I always…

849
00:51:58,248 --> 00:51:59,272
… there is always something…

850
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,214
… that does not seem to me correct…

851
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:05,380
… or there is always something
that… it produces fear to me…

852
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:07,184
… a disgust sensation, already you know.

853
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:11,193
In this world, all that
that they give you is sweepings.

854
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:15,725
It is like darte caramels…

855
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,563
… but I do not want caramels,
I want food.

856
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,364
The Spirit Santo is the food.

857
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,702
A good food, one knows the food
that it needs and the one that is good.

858
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:26,765
But the caramels become ill to you…

859
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,277
… and there are many people thus
in this world, they are ill.

860
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:32,543
They are looking for something.

861
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,126
There is an enormous, immense spider, there.

862
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:49,097
- I do not go.
- Dejame to see.

863
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,691
- Where?
- There above.

864
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,862
- Muestrame.
- You see It?

865
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:58,106
Ves the great thing
that they seem its bodies?

866
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,143
I know it, is revolting.

867
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,509
I am not created different
to other children…

868
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,175
… because we know Jesus
and we are hungry of Jesus.

869
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,615
Pero you know what?

870
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,482
It would not be different from other children…

871
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,114
… if all followed their call.

872
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,018
This it is the subject with the U.S.A.

873
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:20,893
The U.S.A. assumed
that it was the nation of God, truth?

874
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:25,458
Soon the things began to twist.

875
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:30,131
And now much people in the U.S.A.
she does not follow God.

876
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:45,945
It is well, we are going to receive
to the gentleman president now.

877
00:53:49,793 --> 00:53:54,526
Let us speak to him. Let us say: “Welcome,
welcome president Bush ".

878
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,463
Welcome, president Bush.

879
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:59,127
- “We are happy that here it is. ”
- Happy that here it is.

880
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,727
I want that they give a blessing him.
That they give a blessing him.

881
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:06,572
Harian that? Raise its hands
and denle a blessing.

882
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,907
Do something on the war.

883
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:10,105
The war…

884
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:17,312
It has surrounded itself
of the full people of spirit…

885
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,356
… for that reason we pray by its spirit…

886
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:23,326
… it is here, came to visit to us.

887
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:27,725
Yes, Gentleman, thanks, Jesus.

888
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:33,102
- They say to him: “Mr. President…
- Mr. President…

889
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:35,137
… our nation under God ".

890
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,139
Mr. President…

891
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:41,541
… our nation under God!

892
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:55,987
- The days pass express, truth?
- Yes.

893
00:54:56,519 --> 00:55:01,491

I want that feel,

00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,930
… the smiling faces,
watching towards there.

898
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:17,509
Hello, boys.

899
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:23,614
I am very contented tonight,
ground to speak with great people…

900
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:28,624
… but tonight I must speak to him
perhaps to the most important generation…

901
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,785
… of the history of the U.S.A.

902
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,057
Guau! And it is not a joke.

903
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,588
Where is the young person?
The young person of long hair.

904
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,430
They see here, son.

905
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:44,774
Parate to my side, how you are called?

906
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,173
- I am called Levi.
- Levi?

907
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:49,336
Guau, is a brilliant name, Levi.

908
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:52,813
- They like that name?
- Yes.

909
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:58,247
The subject is this.
Before you were born…

910
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,583
… God already knew you.

911
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,055
He is fantastic.

912
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:05,356
He said this. He said that you would form
in the belly of your mother.

913
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,862
Noneras a portion of protoplasma…

914
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,558
… or what was.

915
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:15,035
You are not a portion of weave
in the belly of your mother.

916
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,596
You were created deliberately
by God.

917
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,811
Is not incredible?

918
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,577
God wrote a book on your life
and He wrote:

919
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:33,247
“Levi, Levi will look for
to God from early age…

920
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:38,323
… and it will be a voice
that it will move to the U.S.A. ".

921
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,021
Yes!

922
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:44,624
“And this will not finish
in its adolescence…

923
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,464
… it will go by God in those days…

924
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:48,003
… and he will be a preacher ".

925
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,005
- Yes!
- “And to its 20 years…

926
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,042
… it will begin to make things
truely important for God…

927
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,270
… in the nation.

928
00:56:55,789 --> 00:57:00,273
The dream of God, the life
of novel of Levi…

929
00:57:00,779 --> 00:57:02,264
… signed by God ".

930
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,114
What seems to you?

931
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,712
- It sounds brilliant.
- It sounds brilliant, no?

932
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:07,882
You are brilliant.

933
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,796
Now escuchenme, boys.

934
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:19,426
From 1973,
near 50 million babies…

935
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:22,596
… they have not had the opportunity
to fulfill the dreams…

936
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,503
… that God had for its lives.

937
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:26,508
It is sad, truth?

938
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:29,409
A third of its friends…

939
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,073
… it could be here tonight,
but never they did it.

940
00:57:34,106 --> 00:57:39,106
A person is a person,
she does not matter how small is.

941
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:45,585
God is a sleepy for them
as it has it for you.

942
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:49,894
You see It? He is amazing, no?
Sight that.

943
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,491
7 weeks of life.

944
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:55,766
Tonight, I create
that something is beginning…

945
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,306
… that can change the U.S.A.

946
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:01,537
Really, boys,
I believe that you are the beginning…

947
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:04,774
… of a movement that raises
the moral protests…

948
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:07,783
… that can finish with the abortion
in the U.S.A. and to change this.

949
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,581
You would like to be part
of that type of company?

950
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,678
Yes!

951
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:31,868
Jesus, I spill your blood…

952
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:35,604
… on my sins
and the sins of my nation.

953
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:39,944
God, finishes with the abortion
and beam that the U.S.A. appears again.

954
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:44,715
Upper. Jesus, I spill
your blood on my sins…

955
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,516
… and the sins of my nation.

956
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:50,423
God, finishes with the abortion
and beam that the U.S.A. appears again!

957
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:55,021
Life! Life! We demanded life, Gentleman to You,
in name of Jesus, life!

958
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,896
Satan, in name of Jesus, sueltalos.

959
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,266
You do not have to be able for apoderarte
of the life of the people…

960
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:02,964
… single God has that power.

961
00:59:03,763 --> 00:59:06,012
Not more, Sir, not more.

962
00:59:06,053 --> 00:59:10,741
Not more! Not more!

963
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:20,418
Adult, for 32 years
that we protested! Is too much!

964
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,925
Sir, we requested you by
the cuts of the U.S.A.…

965
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,927
… we requested to you because

966
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,486
… because there are right judges…

… that legislates to favor
del that not yet been born, God!

968
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:37,601
Right Judges!
Right Judges!

969
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,437
- Right Judges!
- Right Judges!

970
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:43,809
Right Judges!
Right Judges!

971
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,873
God, is children saying, God.

00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:50,419
Listening from the sky,
God, is hour.

973
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:52,010
Long time, Gentleman.

974
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,113
Right Judges!
Right Judges!

975
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,988

Right Judges!

979
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:07,096
They made a pact
with God tonight…

980
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:10,435
… to say
by the aim of the abortion in the U.S.A.

981
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:14,408
They do not take that lightly,
they do not break its promises.

982
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:17,139
They are not the one who break promises,
be hacedores of history.

983
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:54,883
Creen that knows the U.S.A.?

984
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:58,352
I mean, creates
that they know its own country?

985
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:00,855
Well, I must say to them that no.

986
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:02,948
There is a religious political army…

987
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,994
… of soldiers still on there outside…

988
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:07,495
… that is being directed
by a political right.

989
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:11,021
One is not your mind
conspiring things…

990
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,068
… is happening!

991
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:14,694
This people… you know… are…

992
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,898
They do not seem politicians…

993
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,304
… they do not seem politicians…

994
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,365
… it does not seem that they…

995
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,809
… it seems… that they
they rise the car of anyone.

996
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:24,904
I mean, are looked like your neighbor.

997
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,745
But… When you put them
to all together ones…

998
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:30,650
… what ends up happening
it is that they take the control…

999
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,655
… in small slices,
and then……

1000
01:01:33,723 --> 01:01:36,157
This is the last stage.
I will say something to them.

1001
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:40,252
They have taken
the White House, the Congress…

1002
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,695
… the magistrature
by all a generation.

1003
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,892
Together, this people
she forms a powerful one…

1004
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,798
… I mean, a powerful one
block of voters.

1005
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,829
Watch, George Bush and Karl Robs…

1006
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,671
… they must to this people
great, great moments.

1007
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,711
Been we have slept in the wheel…

1008
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,746
… as this element
conservative, politician…

1009
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,145
… fundamentalist…

1010
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:03,311
… it has gained too much control
and to be able in this country.

1011
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:06,287
It is totally
beyond my understanding…

1012
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,380
… how somebody can watch
this photo and to say:

1013
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:10,187
“Oh, you know that this… Yes…

1014
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:13,160
“It does not affect to me”.
He is absurd.

1015
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,245
It is an honor to announce the nomination…

1016
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,879
… to Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr…

1017
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:40,650
… like judge associate…

1018
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,850
… of the Supreme Court
of the United States.

1019
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,792
Definitively,
if the president treated…

1020
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:53,393
… to replace to O'Connor,
a moderate one by an extremist…

1021
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:57,235
… uh, would be the greatest fight
by the Supreme Court…

1022
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,069
… of the history of the U.S.A.

1023
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,912
This appointment of judge Alito
it is very important…

1024
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,880
… because the Church
it needed to be involved.

1025
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,314
He is everything what like Christians
it worries to us…

1026
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:11,979
… because it so is opened
with the subjects of the life…

1027
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:15,217
… and other subjects that are
so important for us.

1028
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:20,491
This he is a little while crucial, crucial.

1029
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:24,966
Judge Alito, our work
of 30 years…

1030
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:29,437
… it is arriving at its culmination,
to the consumation, now.

1031
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:33,942
Let us take to this man, Judge Alito…

1032
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:37,810
… to the Supreme Court of the United States
and we advance a step forwards…

1033
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,442
… so that the U.S.A. returns to be
a nation under God.

1034
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:43,542
That God blesses to him.

1035
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,496
Church of the New Life,
Colorado Springs

1036
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,937
Colorado Springs has…

1037
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,306
… the greater concentration of
evangelistas organizations of the U.S.A.

1038
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:12,747
At megaiglesias of the city they arrive
Christian tourists of all the country.

1039
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:17,775
# Your face is the unique thing that I see #

1040
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,254
# And your days #

1041
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:23,656
# Will be #

1042
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:26,752
# A treasure #

1043
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,354
# And my compensate #

1044
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:34,732
# The only thing, yes,
only reason why alive #

1045
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:41,568
# Oh, what incredible #

1046
01:04:42,084 --> 01:04:47,084
# A love beyond the explanation #

1047
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:53,150
# You are beautiful #

1048
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:19,439
We decided
that the Bible is the word of God.

1049
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,244
We must not have
a general assembly…

1050
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,614
… on which we create.

1051
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:24,915
It is written in the Bible, truth?

1052
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:28,047
For that reason we do not have to debate
on which we must believe…

1053
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:32,720
… on the homosexual activity,
it is written in the Bible.

1054
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,295
I believe that I know what you did last night.

1055
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:44,464
If it give 1000 dollars me,
I will not tell it wife to your.

1056
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,646
If you use something of this, I will demand to you.

1057
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:57,574
I have a rule of the 10 years
on the pairs.

1058
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:00,588
For that they are married
with somebody 30 years greater…

1059
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,715
… I hope that he dies stops
that they can remain with his money.

1060
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,020
But…

1061
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,459
The point at which I want to arrive
it is that you must be safe…

1062
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:16,869
… in its homes,
to have essential beliefs.

1063
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,338
And we, like Americans…

1064
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,466
… those that are citizen
of the United States…

1065
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,272
… they need to be safe
of which our nation…

1066
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:24,001
… it has an essential belief…

1067
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,675
… and that we establish
these philosophies correctly…

1068
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:32,850
… that our freedom
it is guaranteed. Amen?

1069
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,784
Let us say together.
Father, in the powerful name…

1070
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:38,418
… of Mr. Jesus,
we said by president Bush…

1071
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:42,726
… because it is choosing a new one
candidate for the Supreme Court.

1072
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:46,325
Damages forces
so that it lasts for always.

1073
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:49,735
Sir, you do not let to us resign,
you do not allow that this struggles.

1074
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:53,571
You do not allow that this negotiates.

1075
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:58,102
Every day is an immense war,
allow that the battle begins.

1076
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:05,049
You are understanding all this?
Yes, it is well.

1077
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,417
You need arrepentirte.

1078
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:17,157
- He is beautiful.
- Yes, he is amazing.

1079
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:20,862
When they ignite all the lights
everything will shine here.

1080
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:22,528
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, how you are called?

1081
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:24,573
- My name is Levi.
- Hello. Levi, Ted Haggard.

1082
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,575
- I am the main shepherd here.
- The main one, yes, I imagined it.

1083
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:29,474
- It is well. You imagined it.
- Yes.

1084
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,944
- How you are called?
- That was a good sermon.

1085
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,810
- Was a good sermon?
- Yes, it was it.

1086
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,110
- Dices some sermon?
- Yes.

1087
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,413
- Which is your favorite subject?
- My favorite subject?

1088
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:38,919
The one of the faith.
That is my favorite subject.

1089
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:41,149
-, Well fabulous.
- Yes, I like much the one of the faith.

1090
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,817
It likes people
to listen to your sermon?

1091
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,986
It seems to be that all
they pay more attention to him.

1092
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,724
- “ Of whom it is east sermon”
- Is by the content…

1093
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,732
… or because you are a boy?

1094
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,530
- I do not know.
- Yes. Good, already we will know it…

1095
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,661
- I believe that it is…
- We will know It when you have 30.

1096
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:58,468
I would say to you, takes advantage of this
of being a pretty boy…

1097
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,236
… until you have 30…

1098
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,743
… and by then
you will have a good content.

1099
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:09,183
Let us think that
we must make emphasis…

1100
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,344
… in people younger than you
so that your church…

1101
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,479
… it grows of a healthful form.

1102
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:16,024
The boys are it everything.

1103
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,686
They love the evangelical message,
God loves them…

1104
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,594
… the Bible is the word of God,
they are gifts of God.

1105
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,894
Because while the state school
it says to them that they are animals…

1106
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:26,298
… product of a natural selection…

1107
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:27,892
… we say to them
that God loves them.

1108
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:30,165
God has created them,
it gave an intention them in his life.

1109
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:33,299
The boys adore that.

1110
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:37,402
It is an enormous number of people
and we are growing.

1111
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,448
Churches like this…
There is a new church thus…

1112
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:41,540
… every two days in the U.S.A.

1113
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,244
This has grown as much…

1114
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,514
… that essentially
it influences in each election.

1115
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:49,786
If the evangelistas vote,
they will determine the election.

1116
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,952
Is a fabulous life!

1117
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:48,478
#… nothing except
the blood of Jesus #

1118
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:53,147
# What can do to us
absolutely again? #

1119
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:57,818
# Nothing except the blood of Jesus #

1120
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:02,993
# Oh, precious is the current #

1121
01:10:03,796 --> 01:10:08,796
# Destroys targets to Us like the snow #

1122
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:14,305
# Is no another source for me #

1123
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:19,243
- # Nothing except the blood of Jesus #
- We sing for this nation.

1124
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:24,218
# How we can wash
our sins? #

1125
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:28,689
# Nothing except the blood of Jesus #

1126
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:30,987
Amen. Well.

1127
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:36,289
The Bible says that
of the mouth of babies…

1128
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,094
… God has ordered to us to say…

1129
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:41,864
… to shut up to the enemy,
to the adversary and the avenger.

1130
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:46,704
God wants to use to smallest
in order to disturb to the wise person…

1131
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:50,404
… that the things that do not matter
they do not annul the things that yes matter.

1132
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:51,844
Viste the great towers…

1133
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,145
… the great constructions
and the great men?

1134
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:58,186
God says that the orations of the children
they can make shake to kings.

1135
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:01,280
We go, aleluya.

1136
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:46,264
They are training to us
in order to leave and to train to others…

1137
01:11:46,335 --> 01:11:49,930
… to train to others to be the Army
of God and to make the will of God…

1138
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:53,133
… what It wants that you do.

1139
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:55,836
I feel that they are to us
training to be soldiers…

1140
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:57,674
… single that of an amused way.

1141
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:01,113
Not… I do not feel
the fear sensation…

1142
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:04,050
… of which I am going to die in the battle
or something that you would feel…

1143
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:07,350
… when you really go to the war.

1144
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,789
There is peace in all this also.

1145
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:12,452
There is excitation and peace at the same time.

1146
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:13,825
He is brilliant.

1147
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:16,160
You know, much people
it dies by God and others…

1148
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:18,165
… and they…
they are not scared.

1149
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,599
They do not feel fear of that
nor of no other thing.

1150
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:23,297
And it is like…
my papa said to me…

1151
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:26,136
… when their papas were missionaries…

1152
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,972
… it had to go to a place
very dangerous…

1153
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:32,639
… they jumped and shouted:
“ Martyr, martyr”.

1154
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:35,950
He is brilliant.

1155
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:45,358
Parate.

1156
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:49,426
You are a young man, levantate.

1157
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:52,524
I know a powerful soldier for God,
thus it is, son.

1158
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:55,729
You parate there. There you go, Joseph.

1159
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:58,272
Someday you could be
the head of the government…

1160
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:02,106
… who knows, Joseph.
He dreams dreams.

1161
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:05,010
How you are called? Austin?

1162
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,843
Lights affluent with that tape in the mouth.

1163
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:12,178
We go. Very well,
here you have, youngster…

1164
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,688
… you are very enthusiastic, I love you.

1165
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:16,247
Some liberal ends…

1166
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:20,728
… they would have to watch this
and they would begin to shake in its boots.

1167
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,627
The intensity that you see in these children…

1168
01:13:22,698 --> 01:13:24,689
… doubt does not fit
of which they would have to watch this…

1169
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:28,328
… and they would say: “Oh, God mine,
it did not know that this was possible.

1170
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,373
And how they will be these children
when they grow “.

1171
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,900
It is an instinct animal that people
feel envies, you know?

1172
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:37,843
It wants to see intensity…
You want to see children…

1173
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:41,178
… enthusiastic by Christ.
Thus he is this, you know.

1174
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,410
And I must believe my heart yet…

1175
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:45,783
… that this is single
the end of iceberg.

1176
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:49,221
I believe that these children
they will have an impact in the sky.

1177
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:52,158
God listens to the weeping of the children.

1178
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:55,060
Uy! It makes me cry.

1179
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,119
We are with Becky
in Bismarck, Dakota of the North.

1180
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,992
She is shepherd of children
and she directs a summer camping…

1181
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:32,829
… for evangelistas children
there, in Dakota of the North.

1182
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:35,802
- Becky, how are you?
- I feel well.

1183
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:39,773
So that young? So that one assumes
that they are the new army of God?

1184
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:41,742
So that they use the children
in order to do that?

1185
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:43,937
Whatever it works
with children it knows that…

1186
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,173
… the reason by which
you work with children…

1187
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:47,681
… it is because what they learn…

1188
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:50,081
… at the age of 7, 8, 9 years…

1189
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,484
… it remains there
by the rest of its lives…

1190
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:54,715
… and there are statistics
that they can investigate…

1191
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,314
-… by you yourself…
- No, I… I…

1192
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:58,791
I know these statistics,
but it used the term “to learn”.

1193
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:02,126
The word “to learn”
it is different “to indoctrinate”.

1194
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:03,892
God gave a brain us…

1195
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:06,298
… God gave the freedom us to choose…

1196
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,393
… and to learn it is part of that election.

1197
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:11,166
And I believe that whenever
the fundamentalist movement, Becky…

1198
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,107
… it interferes with that,
we are making damage…

1199
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,201
… we are making damage
to the evolution of the humanity.

1200
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:19,805
I do not believe that any boy
arrive at that by election.

1201
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,646
Reason why I understood, your question was…

1202
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:25,050
… if it seems to me that it is well
that the fundamentalism…

1203
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,452
… it indoctrinates its children
with its beliefs.

1204
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,855
I believe, fundamentally, that yes.

1205
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,917
Because all the other religions
they are indoctrinating his children.

1206
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:36,055
Hello? I would like to see
more churches indoctrinating.

1207
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:38,964
To the children you can say to them
what is.

1208
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:40,899
As I say,
you can say to him to a boy…

1209
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:44,632
You can turn a boy
in a soldier whom a AK-47 loads.

1210
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,435
You can call washed it of brain…

1211
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:49,602
… but I am enthusiastic and radical
in teaching to the children…

1212
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:53,045
… on its responsibility
like Christians…

1213
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,583
… as well as the fear of God,
like Americans, if they want to arrive…

1214
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,118
Good, Becky,
dejame preguntarte this.

1215
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:00,211
How to ignore that of which
we are not creating suddenly…

1216
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:03,918
… young soldiers
for the Republican Party?

1217
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,186
What has to do this…

1218
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,852
… with which Christ said…

1219
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,658
… on how we must live
our Earth life?

1220
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:13,030
It is… I am not safe…
I do not know of any church…

1221
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:16,036
… that has a political cause.

1222
01:16:16,104 --> 01:16:18,664
I… I do not persecute
to my children politically…

1223
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,675
… but that, you know… because
at the same time I mean…

1224
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,643
… that I do not have any problem
in saying to him to my boys…

1225
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:25,043
… that we are in favor of the life.

1226
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:27,240
I say that God to them
he is observing to us…

1227
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:30,308
… God has… and I…
And God has a very special place…

1228
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:32,353
… for those people
that they damage our children.

1229
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,581
- It is not a pretty place.
- Sabes what?

1230
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:35,213
I am not going to go there, Mike.

1231
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,281
Sabes which always did
that this country was special?

1232
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,623
What it always differentiated to this country…

1233
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:42,960
… it is that there is something we called…

1234
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:45,556
… the separation between Church and State.

1235
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:47,727
Always there are outstanding for that reason…

1236
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:50,169
… and there are outstanding during 200 years.

1237
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,569
This worked.

1238
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,733
I concern your right
like fundamentalist…

1239
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:55,970
… to teach to your children
what is that you want to teach to them…

1240
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:58,638
… but you do not leave blood it
stain the public sector.

1241
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:00,511
You do not leave stains
of blood the schools.

1242
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:03,210
I am not in agreement with you,
the Christianity is important.

1243
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,082
Let us think that it is the religion
more important in the world…

1244
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,053
… because it changes the life of people.

1245
01:17:07,122 --> 01:17:10,649
Pero Becky, is a witch potion,
it will be appropriated the democracy.

1246
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,318
You know, I I believe that the democracy…

1247
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,589
… it is the political system
greater on the Earth…

1248
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,654
… but single that,
he is only… the unique one…

1249
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,700
… he is the unique thing on the Earth…

1250
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:21,201
… and in last instance it is designed
in order to destroy itself to itself…

1251
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,863
… because we must give him
to all the same freedom…

1252
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:26,533
… and in the end that
it will destroy us.

1253
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:28,838
And then the perfect world
it is not going to be perfect…

1254
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,309
… until Jesus
be the true Gentleman.

1255
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:33,644
Becky, thanks to be with us.

1256
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:35,683
Don't mention it.

1257
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:41,516
- God mine!
- I have one more an interview.

1258
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,751
At the most I listen on this…

1259
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:46,953
… that is to say, every time
he is more crazy.

1260
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:07,875
58 votes to favor, 42 against.

1261
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,880
The nomination of Samuel A. Alito Jr…

1262
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,045
… of New Jersey
to be judge associate…

1263
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,884
… of the Supreme Court
of the United States…

1264
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,856
… it is confirmed.

1265
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:37,468
Master America,
master the American style of life.

1266
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:41,272
Master to be part of century XXI.

1267
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:44,910
I wake up every day to me
with desire to make things…

1268
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,079
… but at the same time I observe
this old and ill world…

1269
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:49,180
… and I say: “God, sacanos of here”.

1270
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,901
Knowing what I know…

1271
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:06,236
… how not to dedicate all my life…

1272
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:10,210
… to help another people,
children, adolescents and adults…

1273
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,906
… that comes to save the knowledge
of Jesus Christ?

1274
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:17,140
How it could enjoy the sky…

1275
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,948
… being conscious that
that I never said to him to people…

1276
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:21,887
… that as much matters to me
who is Jesus?

1277
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,561
That is not a load, is
the greatest joy of my life.

1278
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,795
The most religious nation
in the world it is India.

1279
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:38,305
The less religious nation
in the world it is Sweden.

1280
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:41,399
We are a nation of Indians
governed by Swedish.

1281
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:46,175
Like Christians, you are the leaders,
you speak by God.

1282
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:48,944
We worried about our country.
And what I mean it is…

1283
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,212
… that we want that it is heard
our message. We can reduce it to…

1284
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:52,753
She said, to reduce…

1285
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:54,345
… your message to simple orations.

1286
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,014
I will say some simple orations to you.

1287
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:59,322
Number one, is a new day.

1288
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:03,125
Number two,
liberalism is dead.

1289
01:20:03,606 --> 01:20:08,606
Number three, most of
the Americans are preservative.

1290
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:14,070
Number four, has us
in order to show and to speak with clarity.

1291
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:19,009
And number five,
leaves Church it rises!

1292
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:25,477
Thanks, Dr Sutton.

1303
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:35,688
Hello. If you were yourself
to die right now…

1304
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:38,055
… where you think that you would go?

1305
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:42,756
- To the sky.
- In serious? You are safe?

1306
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:45,766
- Yes.
- It is well.

1307
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:51,597
# Preparate,
you know that # is an obligation

1308
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:54,608
# Tienes a friend in Jesus #

1309
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:56,041
I believe that they were Muslim.

1310
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:59,046
# Since you know
that when you die #

1311
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:02,049
# He goes to entrust your spirit to… #

1312
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:04,585
- # Spirit to the sky #
- I want darte this.

1313
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:06,848
- No, thanks.
- Thanks.

1314
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:11,621
Oh, good. It can that already is Christian.

1315
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,718
Saben what I mean?

1316
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:15,160
Piensas that people
indeed she creates

1317
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:17,596
that we are treating
to sell something to him?

1318
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:19,566
Surely that some yes.

1319
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:23,195
I say, if we are young,
what we sell?

1320
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:25,466
Pamphlets in the hands.

1321
