1
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,890
Fire!

2
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,140
Keep to your posts!

3
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,099
Prepare to launch missiles!

4
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,930
Preparing missiles!

5
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,760
It's an earthquake!

6
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,060
Fire into the glacier!

7
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,250
Repeated wars 
and\Nenvironmental disruptions...

8
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,879
As science advanced, earth's\Nenvironment 
paid the ultimate price.

9
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,060
Giant monsters began to appear.

10
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:52,210
A race of mutants, seemingly human,
\Nemerged as mankind's enemies.

11
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,560
But later joined forces 
with\Nthem to fight the monsters.

12
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,400
The Earth Defense 
Force (EDF) is born.

13
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:05,900
Possessing special physical abilities,
\Nmore mutants began to appear.

14
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,180
The EDF organized a special military\Nunit 
consisting of humans and mutants.

15
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:15,620
This elite unit is 
called Organization-M.

16
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,490
But the greatest 
enemy of the EDF...

17
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:23,750
...plunged the world into\Na 
crisis of extinction.

18
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,960
It appeared for the 
first time in 1954.

19
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,430
It's name is...

20
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,189
Can't maintain this.
 We must surface.

21
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,569
Depth is 6700 meters!

22
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:56,550
We're already beyond our limit!

23
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:16,290
Inside temperature now\Nat 
80 degrees Celsius!

24
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,329
Captain!

25
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,170
Temperature now at 90 Celsius!

26
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:29,509
Captain!
 We can't take anymore!

27
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,319
Manda in pursuit!

28
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:10,449
Automatic firing system down!

29
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,240
Manda is terminated.

30
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,389
Ship damage at 72%.

31
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,699
Colonel Gordon, were you\Nplanning 
on sinking the Gotengo?

32
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,509
You can't avoid a court 
martial this time.

33
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,620
Enough!

34
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,090
If this was a real fight,
 Ozaki would be dead.

35
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,820
Lucky for you this 
is only an exercise.

36
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,279
Kazama,
 don't get carried away.

37
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,279
But I won the fight.

38
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,889
Listen, the purpose of training is 
not\Nto become stronger than your partner.

39
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,100
Then what's the point?

40
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,470
To become stronger 
than you were yesterday.

41
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,769
Okay.

42
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,039
Ozaki...

43
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:00,399
Come to my quarters later.

44
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,870
Yes, sir!

45
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,320
Attention!

46
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:15,370
Wait!

47
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,289
Why did you hold back?

48
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,029
Were you trying to lose?

49
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,799
No. You won.

50
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,490
Listen,
 let me tell you something.

51
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,769
You can't act that way 
during a real fight.

52
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,779
Your gentleness is fatal 
on the battlefield.

53
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,730
How can you protect\Npeople 
without gentleness?

54
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,259
You are overly optimistic.

55
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,299
Don't forget,
 we are Mutants.

56
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,629
We were born not to\Nprotect people,
 but to fight.

57
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,500
It's our mission to attack.

58
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:19,460
The fossil of an unknown\Nmonster 
was found in Hokkaido...

59
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,750
...and brought to 
the Defense Museum.

60
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,659
A great scholar is coming from\Nthe 
United Nations to examine it.

61
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:30,399
You'll be the scholar's\Npersonal 
security guard.

62
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,570
Is that all?

63
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,409
Yes.
 It's an easy job.

64
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:40,750
This isn't a job 
for Organization-M.

65
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,009
The Gotengo is now in dry-dock and 
under\Nrepairs after the battle with Manda.

66
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,419
Col. Gordon was pissed off at 
the\Nconference and hit his superior.

67
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
He's in the punishment room.

68
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,360
You need a change of scenery.

69
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:03,440
Anyhow, this great scholar from the\NUN 
must be an old, argumentative...

70
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:14,769
Sorry for being 
so argumentative.

71
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:22,870
This is Ms. Miyuki Otonashi,
\Na molecular biologist.

72
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:29,730
Are you really a scholar?
\NYou look more like a model.

73
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,500
I always thought Mutants were 
dumb\Ngrunts who only know how to fight.

74
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,769
After meeting you,
 it seems that I was right.

75
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:41,139
Yeah,
 that's true.

76
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:47,110
It seems there is also a model\Nwho 
thinks she is a biologist.

77
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,509
First of all,
 let's get something clear.

78
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,120
What?

79
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,990
Don't disturb my job.

80
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,649
Don't talk to me except\Nwhen 
I ask you something.

81
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,330
But I...
\N- In fact...

82
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,230
Don't even look at me except\Nwhen 
you have business with me.

83
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:09,830
Babysitting a woman.

84
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,480
A job that suits you.

85
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:17,139
Try a little harder.

86
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,460
I've studied it thoroughly.

87
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,820
A fusion body of machine 
and living creature.

88
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,879
Should I call it 
a cyborg monster?

89
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,120
After full analysis, I'd say 
it's\Napproximately 12,000 years old.

90
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,389
Could such a creation actually\Nbe 
possible 12,000 years ago?

91
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:46,350
Not possible.
 Not on this planet, at least.

92
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,610
You mean, this monster\Ncame 
from another planet?

93
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,490
Here,
 the M-base is detected.

94
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,200
Yes. Human beings are\Nmade 
up of 4 components:

95
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,519
Adenine, guanine,
 cytosine, and chemin.

96
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:11,740
But mutants have a fifth unknown\None,
 which we call M-base.

97
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,840
M-base is detected 
in this monster, too.

98
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,669
Mutants is not mutations...

99
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:24,710
But somehow biologically related 
to\Nthis monster from 12,000 years ago.

100
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,750
That means this monster is 
kind\Nof an ancestor to you guys.

101
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:33,769
That's ridiculous.

102
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:42,779
Do you have any special thoughts,
 as the\Nfirst Japanese UN Secretary General?

103
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,259
I believe the human race has\Nthe 
ability to solve any problem.

104
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,799
The logic and science\Nthat 
we brought about...

105
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,320
And the reason and courage to 
solve\Nany mystery mankind encounters.

106
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,279
For example, the root of 
life\Nthat is not yet discovered...

107
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,909
...and overcome any 
and\Nall unknown menaces.

108
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,720
I am convinced that 
such a day is upon us.

109
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,620
Mr. Daigo, are you going\Nto 
New York after this?

110
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,070
Yes.

111
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,419
I'm traveling so much these days,
 I\Nfeel as if I were living on an airplane.

112
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:27,370
It's a pity I don't see 
Clint\Nvery much these days.

113
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,370
Clint?

114
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,120
Yes.
 He's my dog.

115
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,379
Oh,
 you have a doggy!

116
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:41,750
He hasn't changed his attitude,
 even\Nsince I became the Secretary General.

117
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,259
Prof. Jiguji,
 here it is.

118
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:54,600
Infant Island?

119
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:57,970
This...

120
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,950
That monster's name is Gigan.

121
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,349
Where are we?

122
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,640
Welcome to Infant Island.

123
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,980
We have brought you here to 
tell\Nyou something very important.

124
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:41,650
Gigan came to this island 12,
000 years\Nago and caused great destruction.

125
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,779
Mothra tried to stop it.

126
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,490
That's what this 
ancient art depicts.

127
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,079
Gigan is a wicked creature.

128
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,349
And its wicked blood 
streams down to you.

129
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,470
Me?

130
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:09,950
You have the power to 
decide\Nwhat path you will choose.

131
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:17,920
As long as you don't become an enemy\Nto 
the earth, Mothra is on your side.

132
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,849
What was that?

133
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,279
Did we all have a hallucination?

134
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,930
No.
 It wasn't a hallucination.

135
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,319
Please take this.

136
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,710
This is a charm from 
the\Nancient times of this Island.

137
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,930
Mr. Daigo. Here's 
the\Ndocument for the meeting.

138
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,660
Oh, thank you.

139
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:15,940
New York is under attack by Rodan.
\NWe've dispatched Rumbling to the scene.

140
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,970
What about Mr.
 Daigo's plane?

141
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,670
It's still missing.

142
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,559
Commander Namikawa,
 Angilas\Nhas appeared in Shanghai!

143
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,440
Dispatch Karyu right away!

144
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,410
Commander!

145
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:31,269
King Seesar has 
appeared in Okinawa!

146
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,210
Kamakiras is in Paris!

147
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,049
Sydney is under attack!

148
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:36,599
What on earth?

149
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:52,809
Damn it!
 Don't let it get the upper hand!

150
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,160
Fire missiles!

151
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:03,170
Fire Maser!

152
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,470
Don't let it get away!

153
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,309
After it!

154
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,500
Who are you?

155
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,299
I'll shoot!

156
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:48,099
Who do you think I am?

157
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,140
Grandpa,
 don't shoot him!

158
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:54,720
He's scared!

159
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,009
Grandpa!

160
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:07,289
What's going on here?

161
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,410
Damage report!

162
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,289
Captain!

163
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,599
Fire missiles!

164
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,519
Oh,
 you're strong.

165
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,650
There's an energy 
plant 1 KM away.

166
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,940
So we'll stop 'em right here!

167
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:32,250
Ozaki and Kazama make a team.

168
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,990
You guys blast the 
hell out of him.

169
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,109
Then, while it's 
preoccupied\Nwith the attack...

170
00:26:36,109 --> 00:26:38,450
Ozaki and Kazama will\Nshoot 
it with the masers.

171
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:40,690
Let's have fried 
shrimp for dinner!

172
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,819
Roger!

173
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:42,890
Go!

174
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:51,730
Fire!

175
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:43,000
We've got it now.

176
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,480
What the hell is happening?

177
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,460
A UFO in Paris!

178
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,460
Kamakiras has disappeared!

179
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,750
Also in Okinawa!
 King\NSeesar has disappeared!

180
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,849
Kumonga as well!

181
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:03,109
All the monsters 
are disappearing!

182
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:06,109
The flying objects 
are gathering.

183
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,089
What's the projected 
target area?

184
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:09,559
Point 0.00.

185
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,859
That's here!

186
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:56,720
Commander,
 you're in danger here.

187
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,910
I don't care.
 The danger\Nis the same everywhere.

188
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,180
Secretary General Daigo!

189
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:36,150
What's happening here?

190
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:44,250
They helped me make 
a narrow escape.

191
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,730
They...?

192
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,940
Yes,
 my friends...

193
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,789
You mean,
 extraterrestrials?

194
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,819
They came from a far-off planet.

195
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,569
They come in peace.

196
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:06,380
We are all about to bear\Nwitness 
to an historic moment.

197
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:28,640
Greetings.

198
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,799
Nice to meet you.

199
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,769
We come in peace.

200
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,769
How do we know that?

201
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:45,180
We've already helped you 
in\Nways you don't yet understand.

202
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,990
The monsters that were ravaging your\Nplanet,
 they're gone now, because of us.

203
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,549
We come from a place 
far\Nbeyond your solar system.

204
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:52,250
Our intentions are peaceful.

205
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:55,500
Earthlings cannot 
pronounce\Nthe name of our star.

206
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,630
So,
 you can call it Planet X.

207
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,640
What is your purpose here?

208
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:13,839
A crisis approaches the earth.

209
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:20,039
A huge asteroid will 
soon\Ncollide with your planet.

210
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:29,019
It will collide with the earth in 11,
 736\Nhours, 17 minutes and 32 seconds from now.

211
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:33,730
31, 30, 29.
 Every second it draws closer.

212
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,930
It is called Gorath.

213
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:45,359
There is only one way to stop\NGorath 
from destroying your planet.

214
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,809
With our help, you must gather all 
of\Nearth's armaments in one place and attack.

215
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:54,779
We are all witness to 
these historic events.

216
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:09,440
This is a great opportunity for us to 
advance\Nin ways we never imagined possible.

217
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,010
With the help of 
our new friends...

218
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:17,440
We can learn limitless new\Nscience,
 technology and medicine.

219
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,610
This universe has 
now become one.

220
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,400
The days of the United 
Nations are now over.

221
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,900
This is the beginning 
of the Space Nations!

222
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:57,150
This is an open area in Tokyo\Nwith 
a great view of the UFO.

223
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,650
As for the UFO,
 no one is\Npermitted to approach it...

224
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,820
...as it is now under 
the\Nmanagement of the EDF.

225
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,510
However, look.

226
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:08,860
A large number of 
people\Ncontinue flocking here...

227
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,130
...day after day,
 to have a look at the X-ians.

228
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,860
The aura of 
enthusiasm escalates!

229
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:21,150
Today's guest is... not Kenji Kohashi,
\Nbecause he's changed his name.

230
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,440
X.

231
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,710
X? Why X?

232
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,800
It's cool, isn't it.
 I became an X-ian today.

233
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:38,130
It's a kind of a collaboration between\Nplanets.
 To promote an certain unity...

234
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,170
Okay, okay,
 okay.

235
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,340
I'll just call you Girly-boy.
 That\Nsuits you better, doesn't it?

236
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,170
Yeah, it does.
\N- It sure does!

237
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,650
Isn't it great that 
the\NX-ian are visiting Japan?

238
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,750
Now we want to get reaction\Nfrom 
our celebrity panelists.

239
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,710
First, how about you,
 Mr. Otsuki?

240
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,980
There is something wrong here.

241
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,980
The purpose of an extraterrestrial\Nis 
for earth aggression...

242
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,030
You're what's wrong!

243
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:16,940
You've always clamed there were 
no\Nextraterrestrials, now here they are! Idiot!

244
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:24,610
What scientific proof do we have 
that\Nthey're actually from another planet?

245
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:30,070
You only talk about 
scientific crap and so on.

246
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,210
You're dreaming.
 Wake\Nup and smell the coffee!

247
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:35,550
This is no dream, and you usually\Nhave 
more constructive things to say.

248
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,650
Thank you!

249
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:46,590
To finally have direct contact 
with\Nextraterrestrial life is a scientist's dream...

250
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,420
I agree.

251
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,300
This could be a 
great opportunity.

252
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,400
There's no point in denying\Nthat 
they're actually here.

253
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,940
I'm not trying to deny it!
\NIf it is so, I will accept it!

254
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,780
I think we're are all in 
for\Na bad experience soon.

255
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,090
I agree with the 
middle-aged guy.

256
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,550
Soon after Gigan is discovered to 
be\Nfrom another planet, X shows up.

257
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,500
There is no proof of a 
connection\Nbetween Gigan and X.

258
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,360
You need proof,
 do you?

259
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,340
Sister!

260
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,710
Anna Otonashi!
 She's your sister!?

261
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,510
You look good,
 Miyuki.

262
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,840
And you have a cool boyfriend!

263
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,550
Boyfriend!
? No way!

264
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,840
So what proof do you have?

265
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,760
Look carefully.

266
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,070
Yes,
 there's something wrong.

267
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,460
I don't know what,
 but he's weird.

268
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,210
Notice something unusual?

269
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,280
He's not blinking.

270
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,190
It's impossible for 
a human not to blink.

271
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,630
Anyway,
 let's pay him a visit.

272
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,800
Nice to see you again.

273
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,510
Mr. Daigo.

274
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,730
Long time no see 
Secretary General Daigo.

275
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,150
Who are you?

276
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,440
I'm Anna Otonashi of Nitto TV.

277
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,110
I'm in a hurry,
 what can I do for you?

278
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,570
I think your idea about 
the\Nspace alliance is brilliant.

279
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,190
I'd like to pass the message to 
all\Nthe world through our TV program.

280
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,760
Okay,
 I'll get back to you.

281
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,300
Soon,
 if possible!

282
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,320
I don't have any time now.

283
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,460
How's your doggy?

284
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,860
Doggy?

285
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,710
Yes, your dog.

286
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,190
Oh, my dog...

287
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:25,980
X-ian devil!
 He's an X-ian devil!

288
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:36,360
He's one of them! We must kill 
them\Nbefore they kill us all! Listen to me!

289
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,300
Mr. Daigo,
 you're bleeding!

290
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,710
Are you all right?
 You should see a doctor.

291
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,340
It's no big deal.

292
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,800
You should get 
emergency first aid...

293
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,280
I said I'm fine!

294
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,650
Miyuki...

295
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,630
This... is not the 
blood of a human being!

296
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,880
I thought so...

297
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,750
There is no creature on 
earth\Nwith this blood composition.

298
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,230
Daigo must be an X alien.

299
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,940
May I come in?

300
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,510
I'm Ozaki,
 second lieutenant.

301
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,090
At ease.
 What is it?

302
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,360
Yes. This is about Mr.
 Daigo.

303
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:47,920
He has become a major\Nactivist 
for the Space Alliance.

304
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,900
There's a problem?
 Continue.

305
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:02,380
There has already been\None 
attempt on his life.

306
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:07,280
I think that we should increase\Nsecurity 
in order to protect him.

307
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,750
I'm aware of all this.
 Thank you.

308
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,280
Yes, ma'am.
 Excuse me.

309
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,210
What is it you want to say?

310
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,480
We have all these monsters and 
can\Nannihilate these people whenever we want.

311
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,880
Why are we wasting 
time like this?

312
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,980
You're still young.

313
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,650
Not every situation is 
to be settled by force.

314
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,230
Sometimes things can 
be handled peacefully.

315
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,650
However,
 if we use our power...

316
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,170
Silence!

317
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,670
About face!

318
00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:00,860
One who relies on power will\Neventually 
fall to a stronger power.

319
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,840
Remember that!

320
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:16,130
These pictures came from the same time,
\Nbut from a completely different place.

321
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,090
They look exactly the same.

322
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,610
Yes,
 they are the same.

323
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,690
When I put these photos on top of each\Nother,
 there was no difference at all.

324
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:31,340
This can't be true.
 This must\Nbe some kind of holograph.

325
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,650
You mean,
 Gorath doesn't exist?

326
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:40,320
This all may be a X-ian plot.

327
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,150
Not only Mr. Daigo,
 but\Nalso Cmdr. Namikawa...

328
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,380
Those two have been\Ntaken 
over by the X aliens?

329
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,000
We can't trust anyone.

330
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:57,630
There is one 
person we can trust.

331
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,400
Someone I know X aliens 
haven't gotten to.

332
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,210
Col. Gordon.

333
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,300
What do you mean by that?

334
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,340
Hello everyone.

335
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,570
We're broadcasting live 
from the UN building.

336
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,880
We have Secretary General Daigo\Nand 
two X representatives with us.

337
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
Thank you for coming.

338
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,670
What are you doing with Mr.
 Daigo's data?

339
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,190
You've become quite 
inquisitive lately.

340
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,280
Major General Kunikida.

341
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,380
If you study too hard,
 you'll\Nknow what needs to be done.

342
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,400
What are you going to\Ndo with me,
 Ms. X alien?

343
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,570
If you know that much,
 then you must die.

344
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,070
You finally show 
your true colors.

345
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,260
Damned humans...

346
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:13,300
We won't have our plans disrupted\Nby 
such lowly creatures like you!

347
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,650
Are you all right?

348
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,190
Are you?

349
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,380
I'm okay.

350
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,880
Mr. Daigo,
 we have a surprise visitor today.

351
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,610
Oh,
 who is that?

352
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,690
What?
 Have you forgotten?

353
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,860
Oh, that's right!
 That's my dog!

354
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,210
Go and say hello to Mr.
 Daigo.

355
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,550
Mr. Daigo, please call his\Nname.
 He'll be very happy.

356
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,510
Name?

357
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,690
Have you forgotten his name?

358
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,710
Poor thing...

359
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:52,650
Young lady, please tell\NMr.
 Daigo the dog's name.

360
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,400
Mr.
 Daigo's dog's name is Clint.

361
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,880
Yes, that's right!
 Clint!

362
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,030
Clint,
 come here!

363
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:14,460
Sorry Clint I couldn't remember\Nyour name.
 How are you, Clint?

364
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:23,860
He doesn't seem to be in a good mood\Nsince 
I haven't seen him for a long time.

365
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,630
Candy,
 come here Candy!

366
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:35,940
Your memory must be bad,
 this is my dog.

367
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,280
But you said my dog...

368
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:45,150
What? I never said 
this is your dog.

369
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,090
This is really fun!

370
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,110
What do you have to say,
 now?

371
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,960
Look at this! This is what\Nan 
X-ian really looks like!

372
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,500
Please explain this!

373
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:13,340
Well...
 there's...

374
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,860
You see,
 it's like this...

375
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,650
What an interesting 
change of events.

376
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:38,760
The fun is only just beginning.

377
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,530
I'm the new Controller.

378
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,690
Hello,
 human beings of earth...

379
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:48,480
Or should I say,
 domesticated animals.

380
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,780
You exist only to 
be dominated by us.

381
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:11,860
This face isn't too bad 
for\Na domesticated animal.

382
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,380
It is useless for 
you to resist us.

383
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,070
Both our science and 
weaponry\Nare superior to yours.

384
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,780
We have all the monsters\Nunder 
our control as well.

385
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,210
You don't have a chance.

386
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,530
Wait.

387
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,300
Stupid domesticated animals.

388
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,300
You have no idea what 
you're up against.

389
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,690
Kazama!
 What's wrong?

390
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,730
Kazama!

391
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,130
You're also a Mutant.

392
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,500
I leave this for you.

393
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:25,230
Get out of here.
 I'll handle this.

394
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:31,510
They need you.
 I'm expendable.

395
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,360
Please save the earth,
 Captain.

396
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,710
Run!

397
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:30,210
Ozaki?

398
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:24,260
Gigan, awaken!

399
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:49,550
Drop all of the 
monsters on earth!

400
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:54,510
Make these savages feel like 
the\Ndomesticated animals they are.

401
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,300
This is our playground.

402
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,030
Destroy the previous 
civilization!

403
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:37,030
Don't give up!
 Fight until the last breath!

404
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,110
Captain!
 Angilas is on the right!

405
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,570
What the...!?

406
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:11,340
Looks like things are 
well under control.

407
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:16,300
These savages are getting 
their asses kicked.

408
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,300
Useless.

409
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:37,420
Now what? Kenta,
 let's go!

410
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:39,690
By the way,
 what's his name?

411
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:42,230
Minya.
 His name is Minya.

412
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:47,760
Minya? Okay then.
 Let's\Ngo, Kenta and Minya!

413
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:17,630
All communication from 
the\Noutside has been cut off.

414
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:22,070
For some reason, they haven't\Ndiscovered 
this emergency hangar.

415
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,250
How about repairs?
 Is it fixed yet?

416
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:30,690
Yes. Gotengo is the 
only thing we have left.

417
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:40,920
You shouldn't move for a while.

418
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:46,590
Ozaki...

419
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,400
Why didn't you kill me?

420
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,730
Because you're my friend.

421
01:01:07,550 --> 01:01:10,570
They'll find this place sooner or\Nlater!
 We need to attack them!

422
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,940
Ozaki, don't become emotional.
\NGotengo is our last hope.

423
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,800
The South Pole?

424
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:29,690
Area G...

425
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:36,130
You want to awaken Godzilla?

426
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:44,380
It's too dangerous.
 Godzilla\Nwill destroy the world.

427
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,090
But if Godzilla is being 
controlled by them...

428
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:54,190
That's all right.
 Godzilla doesn't have M-base.

429
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,030
All the X aliens,
 Gigan...

430
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:04,440
...and part of Ebirah which was\Nstuck 
to Kazama's body have M-base.

431
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:06,730
And of course,
 all the Mutants, too.

432
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,760
That's right.

433
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,860
The X-ians and the 
monsters\Nhave a common gene...

434
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,650
...which give them 
power to control them.

435
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,530
Then why wasn't I affected?

436
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:27,400
You're not controlled.
\NThat's the important thing.

437
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:39,980
If we use Godzilla to 
destroy the enemy...

438
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,380
How do we deal with 
Godzilla afterwards?

439
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:48,980
It's not that easy...

440
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,400
So,
 what you're saying is...

441
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:35,960
We fight our way 
to the South Pole.

442
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:39,900
Blast Godzilla free 
and take him back.

443
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,050
Then have him 
fight the monsters.

444
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:48,130
Meantime,
 we defeat the X aliens somehow.

445
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:52,320
Then we go back to the South\NPole 
and confine Godzilla again?

446
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,690
Understood.

447
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,010
Miyuki,
 be careful.

448
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,780
You too, sis.

449
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:53,510
Please come back alive and well.

450
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,320
Well, there's still an 
interesting toy left.

451
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,820
Gigan, go.

452
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,320
Captain,
 Gigan approaching!

453
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,600
Main engine has stopped!
\NPower circuits have cut off!

454
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,350
Fire missiles!

455
01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:47,390
What is that monster?

456
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:13,279
I am your enemy.
 And Godzilla's enemy is...

457
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,220
This one!

458
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:23,529
Here he comes!

459
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:28,399
Repairs completed!

460
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,770
Start engines!

461
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:55,600
Godzilla is following us.

462
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:19,000
Where should we go?

463
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:37,600
Godzilla,
 let's see how strong you are.

464
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:22,109
Good for nothing 
tuna eating monster!

465
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:24,720
Next!

466
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,850
So earth does have 
something strong.

467
01:15:36,149 --> 01:15:37,630
Interesting.

468
01:15:40,689 --> 01:15:43,560
Why is Godzilla 
destroying that town?

469
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:51,020
Long before you were born,
\Nhumans did a terrible thing...

470
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:53,470
And made Godzilla very angry.

471
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:55,770
Terrible thing?

472
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:56,770
Yes.

473
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,970
You're to young to 
understand yet...

474
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:05,939
But humans made a huge 
fire\Nthat cause much destruction.

475
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:10,590
Godzilla never forgot 
the\Nanger he felt at that time.

476
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,220
What's the matter?

477
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,229
Hey,
 what's wrong?

478
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,430
What are you doing?

479
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:45,649
Are you okay?

480
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:58,600
In the end, all of 
my\Nresearch was meaningless.

481
01:17:10,979 --> 01:17:15,720
We can now control 
our own destiny.

482
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:25,680
Your contributions will be\Nneeded again.
.. after the war.

483
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:37,710
Hey, how come you're 
still fighting?

484
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:44,010
Even though you know 
there's no chance.

485
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:51,220
I was assigned to protect you.
 That's my job.

486
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:02,000
Hey, Minya,
 where are we going?

487
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:19,380
Now what will you do,
 Godzilla?

488
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:49,670
What are you doing?

489
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:00,220
What's the matter,
 Minya?

490
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,859
You've finally arrived.

491
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:26,300
Masers launched!

492
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,670
One of the jet 
fighters have launched.

493
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,390
I owe you a debt.

494
01:22:47,979 --> 01:22:49,109
What are you doing?

495
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:51,279
It's suicide!

496
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,520
Wait!

497
01:23:48,939 --> 01:23:51,779
I leave the rest to you,
 Ozaki.

498
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,720
Stop! Kazama!

499
01:25:03,979 --> 01:25:06,060
Coming into our 
place by drilling...

500
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,609
You're such rude 
domesticated animals.

501
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,460
Kill the useless animals.

502
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:23,970
Well, everything is 
pretty much cleaned up.

503
01:25:27,069 --> 01:25:28,399
Take them.

504
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:31,710
Just a moment.

505
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:35,350
It's no good.

506
01:27:10,109 --> 01:27:14,350
Earthlings,
 do you understand our power?

507
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:28,149
We must take a certain 
mitochondria\Nfrom your cells to survive.

508
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:34,359
In other words,
 we must harvest you alive.

509
01:27:35,399 --> 01:27:37,470
Harvest us alive?

510
01:27:38,569 --> 01:27:43,020
At first, we destroyed your civilization 
so\Nthat you didn't realize our true intentions.

511
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:45,779
We will be harvesting 
a new crop soon.

512
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:51,590
You can live here like 
a domesticated animal.

513
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:55,850
This is our ranch and you are\Nthe 
animals awaiting slaughter.

514
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,680
You're not funny.

515
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:03,000
Both civilization and\Nscience 
are useless to you.

516
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:07,770
You are doomed by your own 
destruction\Nand history of massacre anyway.

517
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:12,880
We will rule over you so 
that\Nwill never happen again.

518
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:18,640
By the way, it's almost\Ntime 
for the main event!

519
01:28:19,109 --> 01:28:22,460
Together we will all 
witness\Nthe last of Godzilla.

520
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:55,010
Godzilla isn't 
all that powerful.

521
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:04,250
Another nuisance.

522
01:31:06,109 --> 01:31:09,220
Your enemy is a new,
 more powerful Gigan!

523
01:32:15,819 --> 01:32:17,850
How are you going 
to defeat us now?

524
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:20,819
How should I kill our friends?

525
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:22,649
Friends?

526
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:27,140
X-ians and Mutants are\Nthe same,
 isn't that right?

527
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:30,890
M-base was also 
discovered in X-ian blood.

528
01:32:31,229 --> 01:32:36,010
We're not the same.
 We have\Nplenty of M-base on our planet.

529
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:41,310
M-base is a material 
influenced\Nby telepathic ability.

530
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:44,810
Therefore Mutants can be\Ncontrolled,
 as well as Gigan.

531
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:47,270
You're bright for an earthling.

532
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:53,819
Mutants are descendants 
of our ancestors.

533
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:57,600
But unfortunately,
 you couldn't control me.

534
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:02,770
You're an exception.
 Your power\Nhasn't been developed enough.

535
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:04,390
What?

536
01:33:05,060 --> 01:33:07,029
You're a Kaiser.

537
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:11,810
A Mutant that is half 
earthling half X-ian.

538
01:33:11,810 --> 01:33:15,899
The odds of such a creature\Nbeing 
born are on in thousands.

539
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,439
You and I have one 
thing is common...

540
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,430
We're both Kaisers.

541
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:34,390
You have the ability to 
surpass\Nboth human and X-ian.

542
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,029
Ozaki!

543
01:34:11,029 --> 01:34:13,359
Wake up,
 Kaiser!

544
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:32,720
Kaiser, as a start,
 kill them all.

545
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:44,520
No! Don't!

546
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:02,680
I...

547
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:12,470
This is boring.
 We should\Nkill these useless ones.

548
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:39,010
Keep your eyes on them.

549
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:52,109
This is our planet.

550
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,520
Secretary General Daigo!

551
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:18,270
Ms. Otonashi!

552
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,840
You're all okay!

553
01:40:21,069 --> 01:40:24,399
I managed to escape 
from them by myself.

554
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:31,550
They used to call me "Mr.
 Infallible."

555
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:39,520
Captain,
 please get everyone out of here.

556
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:42,319
His ass is mine.

557
01:43:03,670 --> 01:43:05,189
You wouldn't hit a lady.

558
01:43:31,020 --> 01:43:32,970
How many times must I tell you?

559
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:41,130
You only exist to be ruled.
.. as pets.

560
01:43:57,020 --> 01:43:59,180
My existence...

561
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:10,500
The only one who could\Ndecide 
my existence is me.

562
01:44:11,770 --> 01:44:14,060
We are not domesticated animals.

563
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:17,399
We are human beings.

564
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:25,470
You are a fool to support these 
animals\Nwhile having the power to control all!

565
01:46:18,859 --> 01:46:21,189
I won't die alone!

566
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:28,529
You're not taking me with you!

567
01:46:43,149 --> 01:46:44,779
Cmdr. Namikawa!

568
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:14,920
Let's go!

569
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,130
Pull that lever!
 Hurry up!

570
01:48:06,029 --> 01:48:07,630
Pull the lever 
with all your might!

571
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,720
It's sucking the life 
force out of Godzilla.

572
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:29,760
If only we can give 
power to Godzilla...

573
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:36,180
All systems negative!

574
01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:24,000
What's that!?

575
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:53,260
Hey Godzilla,
 you've done\Nenough, haven't you?

576
01:57:02,229 --> 01:57:04,029
Damn you!

577
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:10,069
What are you doing?

578
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:29,850
Minya!

579
01:59:07,930 --> 01:59:09,479
Welcome back!

580
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:43,060
Everything is finally over.

581
01:59:45,510 --> 01:59:51,560
No,
 a new war as begun...
