 screened by us.

Angie, it was a

212
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,630
So you want to
 be a movie star.

Why?

I don't know.

215
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,980
I guess it's a form
 of immortality.

216
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,650
But you probably think
 that's pretty silly.

217
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,360
No, the concept of
 immortality seem very seductive.

218
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,190
It's more than that.

219
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,260
Stars, real stars, they're
 like a separate breed.

220
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,550
They don't play by the
 rules of ordinary people.

221
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,390
I'm sure there's a flip
 side to that, though, too.

I haven't figured out why.

Why they're mostly blonde or

Both, I guess.

244
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,190
Thanks to modern technology,
 they can go into the daylight.

 they're not careful

 chase each other?

I want to make sure
 Angie's not on the spit.

00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,970
I think we should set Angie
 up with one of those studio

they never actually do
 anything with the girl.

 her up with Carl Bibbs.
