2
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:56,843
Uh! Hi.

3
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,339
Linda Sinclair
had reached her 45th year,

4
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:35,541
an unwed high school
English teacher,

5
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:38,144
with no prospect of marriage.

6
00:01:38,146 --> 00:01:43,014
Hers appeared to be
a rather ordinary life,

7
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:45,484
one of discipline...

8
00:01:45,486 --> 00:01:46,752
I have these.

9
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:49,287
Frugality...

10
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:51,022
Small indignities...

11
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:52,724
Whoa! Whoa! Oh.

12
00:01:54,193 --> 00:01:55,827
Modest hopes...

13
00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:00,232
Oh, I'm all right.

14
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:02,701
Daddy! Over here!

15
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:04,836
And disappointments.
Oh, dear.

16
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:09,173
She lived alone
in Kingston, Pennsylvania,

17
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:11,475
not far from
where she was born.

18
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:16,714
She enjoyed no great luxuries.

19
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:19,817
Preferring instead
the simple pleasures.

20
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,454
And though her life
may sound cold and dull,

21
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:28,358
let me assure you that Ms. Linda
Sinclair was neither.

22
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,593
She was a passionate woman.

23
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:32,228
A romantic.

24
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,331
That was why she was alone,

25
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,234
for she had always been alone.

26
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:41,538
As a sensitive child,

27
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,074
Linda found her sanctuary
in literature.

28
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:47,610
The great works stirred
in her an excitement,

29
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:49,412
an irrepressible thrill

30
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:52,681
that made the mundane world
seem all the more bleak.

31
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:54,750
All right, come on.
Hustle! Hustle!

32
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:58,320
She saw no reason to take
part in childish pursuits.

33
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:07,362
And her little interest in
the banal activities of youth,

34
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:09,398
her high-minded sensibility

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,466
guided Linda to her
life's purpose.

36
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:13,168
I thought you said she was
going to the library.

37
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,303
No. No, she sucks...

38
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:18,873
She would devote herself
to igniting the flames...

39
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,174
Hi, Joanna.

40
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:23,244
...of literary passion
in young minds.

41
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:26,514
She nurtured their ideals...

42
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:28,416
How do communities
approach change

43
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:30,117
when promoted
by the individual?

44
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:32,186
...valued their opinions.

45
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:33,588
Melissa.

46
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,790
They adored her.

47
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:38,258
But her uncompromising spirit,

48
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
so beloved in the classroom

49
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,529
doomed her
to a spinster's life.

50
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:43,663
Linda?

51
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:46,833
I'm Don.
It's so nice to meet you.

52
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:48,134
You too.
Sorry.

53
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:50,303
Oh, it's okay.

54
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:52,472
Oh, I... Well, you ordered
without me...

55
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:54,174
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

56
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:57,677
No, I wasn't really offended.
I was just making a joke.

57
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,180
For how could she be a
model to her students,

58
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:02,414
if she settled
for just any man?

59
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:03,716
...now I'm unemployed.

60
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:06,919
And that's actually...
It's kinda great.

61
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:11,390
I have a lot of time,
I stopped drinking ice.

62
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,159
I grew a mustache.
And, uh...

63
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:16,562
When I was divorced this whole
patch just fell right into place.

64
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:19,465
And I feel like I'm me now.

65
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,501
And, uh... I might have some ice,
actually. Could I...

66
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:25,570
She longed for a sensitive,
thoughtful man.

67
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:28,573
Do you really need to make
35-40,000 dollars a year

68
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,575
with no chance
of being fired,

69
00:04:30,577 --> 00:04:34,178
just to teach some kids how to clap
their hands and run around in a circle?

70
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,448
I mean, physical education, that ought
to be up to the parents, right?

71
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,550
So what do you
teach again? French?

72
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:42,287
Someone mature,
and soft-spoken.

73
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:44,489
Your system
doesn't work, Linda.

74
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:47,225
It's gasping for air.

75
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:48,959
And you know what...

76
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,929
Let it die.
This is common sense... Hi.

77
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,530
Thanks.

78
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:54,765
Do you mind
getting this one?

79
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:56,900
'Cause I'm a little
short on cash.

80
00:04:56,902 --> 00:05:00,971
In the end, Linda gave
up on men altogether.

81
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:03,473
Why can't we get back
to, like, the Indian days...

82
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:04,975
You know, "You give me
a piece of corn..."

83
00:05:04,977 --> 00:05:08,345
She loved her work,
she earned her keep.

84
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:10,380
Debate! Debate! Debate!

85
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:12,348
That was enough.

86
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,683
What a country...

87
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:16,419
And if there was a tragic air

88
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,888
about our stoic Ms. Sinclair,

89
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,356
so be it.

90
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:24,226
If literature had
taught her anything,

91
00:05:24,228 --> 00:05:29,365
it was that the true romantic
is always alone.

92
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,667
And must ever be on guard

93
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,636
against a dangerous world.

94
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:38,373
Hey.

95
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,608
Ow! Fuck! Ow!

96
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,879
It's me! Jason Sherwood!
I was in your class in 2006...

97
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:47,649
Ah!
Jason Sherwood?

98
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:50,385
Yeah.
What are you doing here?

99
00:05:50,387 --> 00:05:52,487
I thought you lived
in New York.

100
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:54,956
No, I don't anymore...

101
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,926
Oh. Oh, my gosh...
I am so sorry. Oh...

102
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:00,327
Let me take
you to the hospital.

103
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,662
No. I'm fine...
Jason, I insist.

104
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:03,263
We have to take you
to the emergency room...

105
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:05,265
No, no, no... Jesus, please,
no, no, no. no.

106
00:06:05,267 --> 00:06:06,934
It's fine. I'm fine.
I'm sorry...

107
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:08,969
Ah! My dad,
he works at the hospital

108
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:10,871
and I'd really rather not see him.
Okay, okay.

109
00:06:10,873 --> 00:06:12,639
Then let's get
you home, all right.

110
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:14,341
God, that burns
like a fuck!

111
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:16,010
It burned my face!
I know. I'm so sorry...

112
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:18,645
I'm so sorry... Come on,
my car is right over here.

113
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:21,614
Oh, Jesus... Who uses pepper spray
in Kingston?

114
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,858
You know, I have a clean towel
in the trunk,

115
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,926
I could get that for you.
No that's okay.

116
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:35,428
This is working fine.

117
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,963
I am so, so sorry.

118
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:38,498
Oh, don't be sorry.

119
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,400
It's my fault, I shouldn't have
startled you like that.

120
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:41,834
No, no, you were
just being friendly,

121
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,935
I should have
recognized you right away.

122
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,672
Jason Sherwood. What are you doing
back here in Kingston, Pennsylvania?

123
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,608
I thought you'd be tearing
up Broadway by now!

124
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,545
Well, you know,
it's only a matter of time.

125
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,481
You were one of the best writers
I've ever had in my class.

126
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,682
Aw, that's nice.

127
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,753
The last I heard you were in
the playwriting program in NYU.

128
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,888
Is that right?

129
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,489
Dramatic Writing.

130
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,590
Yeah, I got my degree
a couple of years ago.

131
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,460
And?
Don't keep me in suspense.

132
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,895
And nothing.

133
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,530
That's it.
I'm done with writing.

134
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,532
What?
What do you mean?

135
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,033
I mean, I'm finished.

136
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:19,403
I wrote my thesis play.
But that took me forever...

137
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,738
But I don't know,
I really believed in it.

138
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,673
Well, of course you did.
What happened?

139
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,375
I tried to get it produced.

140
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,411
And used every resource
I had just to get it read.

141
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,714
Here, you can just keep going straight.
I'm staying with my dad.

142
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:34,851
For now. Well, what does
he think of all of this?

143
00:07:34,853 --> 00:07:37,120
Uh, well. You don't
really know my dad...

144
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,122
Oh, I do, a little.
He goes to my gym.

145
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,624
Oh, that's funny.
Um...

146
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:43,660
Well, he said I should
go to law school.

147
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:44,928
Oh, no...
Yeah.

148
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,629
So I'm probably
gonna do that.

149
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:47,997
Oh, Jason...

150
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,766
I can't write.

151
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,901
Honestly, it makes me
physically ill.

152
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:55,771
And besides, I have to do something,
and law school's something.

153
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:58,640
You can make a left
at the next block.

154
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:02,644
Right here.

155
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,081
Home sweet home.
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

156
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:08,784
I am so sorry.

157
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:10,886
Oh, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

158
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,791
Jason, if I can do anything to help,
you know...

159
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:18,659
I'd love to read
your play at least.

160
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:19,861
Yeah, sure.

161
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:22,663
Uh, I could
drop it by school.

162
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:24,699
All right.
Yeah?

163
00:08:24,701 --> 00:08:26,767
Okay. Bye, Ms. Sinclair.
Thank you.

164
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:27,935
Bye.

165
00:08:34,543 --> 00:08:36,577
Thanks.

166
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:41,414
It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.

167
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:45,418
It was time
to hand in your quizzes.

168
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,558
So now that I know that you've
all finished A Tale of Two Cities,

169
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,494
let's talk about
Sydney Carton's death.

170
00:08:54,496 --> 00:08:56,830
Now why would
he switch places

171
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:59,699
with a man condemned
to the guillotine?

172
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:02,235
Why does he
sacrifice himself?

173
00:09:04,571 --> 00:09:06,105
Fallon.

174
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:07,973
I think it's really cool,
you know.

175
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:09,708
'Cause he does it
for Lucie.

176
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,611
Even though she married another guy,
he still loves her so much

177
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,547
that he'll die
to save her husband.

178
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:17,917
It's...
It's totally unselfish.

179
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,119
Very nice. Yes?

180
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:22,087
Ms. Sinclair? Have you
ever written anything?

181
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:24,123
Like a novel or a play
or something?

182
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,458
No. No, I'm not a writer.

183
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,195
I'm a reader.
And we need plenty of those.

184
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:32,564
I think it is
only a true artist

185
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:34,999
who can give voice
to the human experience.

186
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,739
I'm sorry, but if Dickens
was such an artist,

187
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:43,641
couldn't he come up
with an ending

188
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:46,211
where this guy doesn't
have to kill himself?

189
00:09:46,213 --> 00:09:48,046
I think you're
missing the point.

190
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:51,648
Sydney Carton's death is,
as Fallon said, a selfless act.

191
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,151
The only satisfaction
he receives is knowing

192
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:58,755
Now this is something that people
understood in Dickens' time.

193
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:01,925
Today we've lost touch
with classical virtues,

194
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:05,562
like honor,
selfless action,

195
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:09,066
the purity of a love
that asks for no reward...

196
00:10:10,168 --> 00:10:11,635
Oh! Hi!

197
00:10:11,637 --> 00:10:13,603
Oh, my goodness.
Sorry to interrupt.

198
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:15,504
No, no, no. Come on in.
No, no, no...

199
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:17,006
Everyone's gonna be
so excited to meet you.

200
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,174
No, no, no.
Please, please. No.

201
00:10:18,176 --> 00:10:20,810
Class, I have
a surprise for you.

202
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:24,213
This is Jason Sherwood.
He's a former student,

203
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:28,818
and a graduate of the Dramatic Writing
Program at NYU.

204
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,521
And I'm sure many of you remember
reading his wonderful story,

205
00:10:32,523 --> 00:10:33,789
The Hidden Court.

206
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,657
Oh.

207
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:37,092
Sorry about that.

208
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,793
Um, I just came
to drop this off...

209
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:40,629
Oh, that's terrific.
Thank you so much.

210
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:43,198
You're welcome to join us.
Oh, no, I'm okay.

211
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,867
I'm just gonna go.

212
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:48,203
You guys should feel very lucky to have
Ms. Sinclair as a teacher.

213
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:51,206
I had many genius
writing teachers at NYU,

214
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,907
and she's up there
with the best.

215
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:57,746
Thank you.

216
00:10:57,748 --> 00:10:59,213
Bye.
Goodbye.

217
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:03,917
Okay, I admit it.
I bribed him to say that.

218
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:07,388
All right, Noble Sacrifice.

219
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:24,203
Dr. Sherwood!
Yeah.

220
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:26,239
I saw your son today.

221
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:28,808
Uh, I'm Linda Sinclair.

222
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,643
I was Jason's English teacher...
Yeah, I know who you are.

223
00:11:30,645 --> 00:11:32,679
Yeah, Jason's back home.

224
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:34,914
He told me all about New York.
It's very sad.

225
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:38,785
You know, I think he just reached a point
where he felt like he had to stop

226
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,853
and take stock of things.
It's very normal.

227
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:43,122
But it would be such a shame for him
to give up his writing.

228
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:44,990
Because he's
so very talented.

229
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:47,726
Yeah. But that's a very,
very tough racket, you know.

230
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:49,261
Not everyone's
cut out for it.

231
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:51,997
I'm excited
to read his play.

232
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:53,598
He showed you his play?
Yes.

233
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,400
I'm very excited
to read it.

234
00:11:56,602 --> 00:11:58,236
I hope you like it.
Well, I'm sure I will.

235
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:00,005
Did you like it?

236
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,875
I can't exactly say
it was my thing.

237
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:07,145
Nice to see you,
Mrs... Miss.

238
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:08,879
Miss Sinclair.

239
00:12:11,016 --> 00:12:12,817
Ms. Sinclair.

240
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,085
Right.

241
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:33,970
Hello?
I'm calling from the...

242
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:37,173
No, thank you. And please
take me off your list.

243
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:39,109
This will only take a second.
Thank you very much.

244
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:40,377
Ma'am? Ma'am?

245
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:32,727
Jason? It's Linda Sinclair.
Did I wake you?

246
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,229
What? No.
No, no, no, no. Hi.

247
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,431
Hi.

248
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,833
How are you?
What's up?

249
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:41,168
Well, I read the play.

250
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,036
You did?

251
00:13:43,038 --> 00:13:44,971
And it's fantastic!

252
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:47,073
You like it?

253
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:48,975
I loved it!

254
00:13:48,977 --> 00:13:52,379
I've been crying
for the last half hour.

255
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:53,847
You have?

256
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:58,618
I mean how can you even think about law school,
you belong in New York.

257
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:01,354
That's so nice
of you to say.

258
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:03,256
No, no.

259
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,491
I'm not being nice.
I'm being honest.

260
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:08,294
And I can't bear the thought that
no one's gonna get to see this.

261
00:14:09,263 --> 00:14:13,866
Yeah, me too. I mean, that's just
the way it is though.

262
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:16,268
You know, uh,
it's fine, you know...

263
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:19,338
I'll be a lawyer.

264
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,241
I just...
I have to let it go.

265
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:25,878
But what if there were
a way to get it produced.

266
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,911
Right now.

267
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,279
Would you be
interested in that?

268
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:31,883
I mean, honestly,
there isn't...

269
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:34,519
Because... Do you remember
Carl Kapinas?

270
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:37,255
Mr. Ka-penis,
the drama teacher?

271
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,524
Jason, please,
he's a friend.

272
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:41,359
Sorry. Kapinas.

273
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:43,328
Well, he's always
complaining about

274
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,898
having to direct the same show
year after year

275
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,167
and I wanna give him
The Chrysalis.

276
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:51,768
Yeah, well, I'm...

277
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,072
I'm not sure really how I feel
about that exactly.

278
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:58,175
Because if he flips for it,
like I know he will...

279
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:01,345
There's a very real chance that he
could mount a production of it.

280
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:06,250
- You mean at the high school?
- Mmm-hmm.

281
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:08,919
God damn it.

282
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,454
With him directing?

283
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:16,792
He can come on a little strong, you know...
But say what you will,

284
00:15:16,794 --> 00:15:19,061
the man understands drama.

285
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:20,930
Linda,
are you in there?

286
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:22,431
Lin... Sorry.

287
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:26,836
- Linda?
- Carl.

288
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:31,874
I can't wait. I've just had the most
transcendent experience!

289
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:33,376
Did you hear me? Yeah,
I heard you. I heard you.

290
00:15:33,378 --> 00:15:35,111
Hurry!
Okay.

291
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,513
Oh, Linda... Linda...

292
00:15:38,515 --> 00:15:40,348
Oh, you liked it?
Liked it?

293
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,917
It's my story.

294
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,118
The boy wrote it for me.

295
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,220
I know! I felt
exactly the same way!

296
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:47,255
Naturally.
The tale is archetypal,

297
00:15:47,257 --> 00:15:49,057
and thus universal in its appeal.
Mmm-hmm.

298
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,359
Of course. Oh, but it's
so extraordinary.

299
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:53,295
I feel I've been
transformed...

300
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:55,363
Wait... We should use
that for the posters.

301
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:59,400
"The Chrysalis will transform you."
Period. "Forever."

302
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:01,101
Exclamation point.

303
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:02,970
Linda, I'll do such
fantastic things with it.

304
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:04,972
I see it all
so clearly up here.

305
00:16:04,974 --> 00:16:07,207
Ah, for the design,
I'm picturing a sort of

306
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:10,210
Neo-Edwardian-German-
Expressionist gestalt.

307
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:11,879
But colorful and fun.

308
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:15,449
Halle Anderson would
make an ideal lead.
Oh, yes.

309
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:18,852
And Sheila Nussbaum
as the Irish stepmother.

310
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:20,588
Oh! She excels at dialect.

311
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,924
I've harvested a bountiful and
talented crop of actors this year!

312
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:26,993
Do you really
think we can do it?

313
00:16:26,995 --> 00:16:29,228
Oh, we can.
And we must.

314
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:31,998
Don't you see?

315
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I've become
an artistic zombie,

316
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:36,302
walking lifelessly through
the same old productions

317
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:38,471
year after year
after year.

318
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:40,907
I'm supposed to direct
The Importance of Being Earnest

319
00:16:40,909 --> 00:16:43,042
this semester
for the fifth time.

320
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,378
Try breathing life into
that antiquated sitcom.

321
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,145
And how can I,
after reading this play?

322
00:16:47,147 --> 00:16:50,349
This is O'Neill meets Kafka
meets Spielberg

323
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:52,050
and then they all
walk into a bar.

324
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,220
It's fresh!
It's new! It's...

325
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,622
It's not gonna
happen, people.

326
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:59,191
And why is that, Phil?

327
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:01,893
Because this is not
a high school play, Carl!

328
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,563
What do you know about what is
and isn't a high school play?

329
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,099
I've done 38 productions.

330
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,000
Thirty-eight
over 19 years!

331
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:10,401
I believe
I'm the authority here.

332
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:12,370
No one is questioning your
authority. Oh, yeah.

333
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:14,305
All Phil is saying...
Phil would be happy

334
00:17:14,307 --> 00:17:16,474
if we put on  Our Town
twice a year.

335
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:19,010
Sue me, I like  Our Town.
I think it's wholesome.

336
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:21,078
Everybody likes it.
I... Just for me...

337
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,450
I thought we were doing The Importance
of Being Earnest  as the play.

338
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:28,586
Trudie, if I have to spend
another two months

339
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,621
making trays
of cucumber sandwiches,

340
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,289
I will curl into a fetal
position and die.

341
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:38,528
like that time you did  Oklahoma
with those idiotic masks.

342
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,698
It was in the traditional
Japanese Noh style,

343
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,170
And Lydia Plotke at the Times Leader called
it "profoundly imaginative."

344
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:49,005
Yeah, well, I thought
it profoundly stank.

345
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:51,474
This from a man who thinks
American Buffalo

346
00:17:51,476 --> 00:17:52,976
is about
an American buffalo.

347
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:56,345
Well, in the words of
David Mamet, "Fuck you!"

348
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,147
Hey, ya, pal!

349
00:17:58,149 --> 00:17:59,648
Now time out!

350
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,950
Now just dial it down
a notch.

351
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:03,485
I'm sorry.

352
00:18:03,487 --> 00:18:04,820
Accepted.

353
00:18:06,022 --> 00:18:09,558
Now as for this play,
The Chrysalis.

354
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,095
You know, I am impressed by what
this alumnus has written,

355
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:14,963
but I have to wonder...

356
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:18,067
You know, is it appropriate for
a high school audience?

357
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,367
Yes.
Right.

358
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,569
- What will the parents think?
- Exactly.

359
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:23,638
Can we clear it
before the Board?

360
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,107
I'm sorry, what's the actual
issue here?

361
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:29,143
Hello?
Have you read the thing?

362
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:31,145
It's got language,
it's got violence...

363
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:33,414
Obviously we'd tone
all of that down.

364
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,615
That goes without saying.

365
00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:39,587
Not to mention the cost,
with all these crazy special effects,

366
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:41,522
and, you know,
costumes.

367
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:45,125
Plus that girl who turns herself
into a bug-monster...

368
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:47,160
What is that?
This is not Broadway.

369
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:48,762
I'm painfully
aware of that.

370
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:51,264
We are dealing
with a limited budget.

371
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:53,033
But this is about
more than money.

372
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:55,001
This is about the kids.

373
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:59,106
to perform the work of a playwright
who used to be one of them.

374
00:18:59,108 --> 00:19:01,108
You want to sell the Board?
You want to sell the parents?

375
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,643
Then sell them
on Jason Sherwood,

376
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:06,278
a former Kingston High School
student who came back

377
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,547
to inspire
the next generation.

378
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,249
It's a great story,

379
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:12,785
and I think I know a little something
about great stories.

380
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,387
We'll double
normal ticket sales.

381
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:18,190
You'll see the people of Kingston
are hungry for something new.

382
00:19:18,192 --> 00:19:20,059
And if it does come down to money,
I'll tell you this.

383
00:19:20,061 --> 00:19:23,062
If we go one penny over budget,
I'll pay for it myself.

384
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:24,296
Out of my own pocket.

385
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:27,032
That's how much
I believe in this play.

386
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,633
Phil, what do you think?

387
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,068
All right. Okay.
Hold on now.

388
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,469
We haven't talked
about the ending.

389
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:32,570
What about the ending?

390
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,640
Oh, it's dark.

391
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,743
"Dark"? Trudie,
it's a teenage girl

392
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:42,180
who hangs herself and then her dad
blows his freakin' brains out!

393
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,782
You can't do that
on a high school stage!

394
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:46,351
But everything
hinges on the ending!

395
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,286
It's poetry.
It's Ibsen!

396
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,655
It's a lawsuit
waiting to happen!

397
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,890
The ending would
have to change.

398
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:58,095
All right.

399
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,363
We'll cut the ending.
What?

400
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,697
What?
We'll cut it.

401
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,865
Leave it ambiguous.

402
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,135
Yes. Yes, it could
heighten the mystery.

403
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,737
Leave it open
to interpretation.

404
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:07,871
I like it.

405
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:10,407
Would Jason
agree to that?

406
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,209
I'm sure he understands,
as we all do,

407
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,310
that one must be flexible
in the name of Theater.

408
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:20,149
Oh! God, I'll have to start the auditions
by Friday, assemble my crew...

409
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:22,218
Carl. Carl! So much to do,
so little time.

410
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,620
But when the inspiration is there,
it hardly seems like work.

411
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:26,789
Carl! We can't cut the ending,
we just can't.

412
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,624
It's gonna ruin
the play, it'll kill it!

413
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:31,093
Relax.
No! I won't relax.

414
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:32,862
I mean... How am I supposed to
explain this to Jason?

415
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,697
Very simply.
Don't.

416
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:37,300
Because we're not going to cut it.
We're not?

417
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,535
No, I just said that to get the go-ahead
from der Fuhrer and his wife.

418
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:42,370
That's how it works
in show business.

419
00:20:42,372 --> 00:20:45,173
It does? Keep it moving
at all costs.

420
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:48,510
Believe me, when the entire audience
is bawling on opening night,

421
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:51,646
even that sub-cretin Phil
will give it his blessing.

422
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:53,381
Really?
Really.

423
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:56,251
I give you my word.

424
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:57,886
It's a game, Linda.

425
00:20:57,888 --> 00:20:59,988
And I know
how to play it.

426
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:28,715
Oh, my goodness. You must be freezing!
Oh, I'm fine.

427
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:30,783
Let's get you some coffee to warm up.
Okay?

428
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:33,453
Oh, no. I don't want coffee.
I have an ulcer.

429
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:35,688
Oh, some herbal tea, then.
No, no, no. That's fine.

430
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,857
I don't... I don't
really want anything.

431
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:39,926
How long have
you had an ulcer?

432
00:21:39,928 --> 00:21:43,296
Um, since, uh...
Since New York, actually.

433
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:45,298
Since this play.

434
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,466
Um, speaking
of which...

435
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:49,434
Ah, yes! The play!
The play's the thing.

436
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:51,303
Um... All right.
Here's the contract.

437
00:21:51,305 --> 00:21:53,572
Well, it's not really a contract,
it's more like an informal agreement

438
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:57,442
Um... All it says is that you grant
the high school the right

439
00:21:57,444 --> 00:21:59,444
to mount a production
of your play.

440
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:02,781
I just need your signature right here,
and then we're good to go.

441
00:22:09,455 --> 00:22:11,622
Everything okay?

442
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:15,559
Um...

443
00:22:16,728 --> 00:22:18,329
I don't want
to be difficult, um...

444
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:20,564
And I know
you're only trying to help,

445
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:24,835
but this is not exactly a high
school play that I've written...

446
00:22:24,837 --> 00:22:26,504
Well, I understand that.

447
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:28,472
And as much
as I want it produced,

448
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:31,409
believe me, I do, I would just rather it
be not made at all,

449
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:32,643
than be made badly.

450
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:34,911
Well, Carl and I feel
exactly the same way.

451
00:22:34,913 --> 00:22:37,247
I...

452
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:39,616
I just don't
think I can do it.

453
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:47,791
Do you want
your father to win?

454
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:48,892
What?

455
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:51,561
I'm not stupid.
I read the play.

456
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:53,496
I know where
this came from.

457
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,432
Your father doesn't
understand you, fine.

458
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:57,232
He doesn't
support you, fine...

459
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:59,635
He'd say he does...
Well, financially, yes.

460
00:22:59,637 --> 00:23:01,770
Paying for law school.
He'll encourage you,

461
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:04,506
but only if you do
what he wants you to do.

462
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,776
Don't give in to him, Jason!
Prove him wrong.

463
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,813
Well, what if
he's not wrong?

464
00:23:10,815 --> 00:23:12,648
You know, you've just lost
confidence, that's all.

465
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,518
That can happen to any artist.
But if you do this...

466
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:19,521
...you're gonna get it back.
I promise you.

467
00:23:36,673 --> 00:23:39,407
I feel like I'm signing
my soul away.

468
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:41,309
Ja, Herr Faust!

469
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,477
It's all mine.

470
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:49,549
Sheila Nussbaum will be playing
the role of Margaret,

471
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,785
the cruel Irish stepmother.

472
00:23:51,787 --> 00:23:54,621
Sheila's been working on her Irish,
haven't you, Sheila?

473
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:57,057
I'll meet ya at the pub
on Grafton Street,

474
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,425
ya bloody eejit!

475
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:03,497
Will Traynor will play
Dr. Tim Sherman,

476
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:04,998
the cold,
alcoholic father.

477
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,770
Fallon Hughes will play our heroine's
deceased mother, Ariadne,

478
00:24:10,772 --> 00:24:13,906
who haunts our tale
as the spectral Moth Queen.

479
00:24:13,908 --> 00:24:16,709
And last,
but certainly not least,

480
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:20,713
Halle Anderson will be
Miss Jane Sherman,

481
00:24:20,715 --> 00:24:22,982
our sensitive,
misunderstood ingenue.

482
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:24,483
Hi.

483
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:26,452
And now, Mr. Sherwood,
may I say on behalf

484
00:24:26,454 --> 00:24:28,854
of the entire Kingston
High Theater Department

485
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:30,722
it is an honor
to have you with us.

486
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:34,459
And I know we have questions,
questions, questions.

487
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:36,161
So, who wants to begin?

488
00:24:37,463 --> 00:24:38,730
Halle.

489
00:24:38,732 --> 00:24:43,635
Your play really captures what it feels
like to be a teenage girl,

490
00:24:43,637 --> 00:24:46,738
not knowing who you are,
and wondering if anyone gets you.

491
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,741
And I want to be as real
as I can in my performance,

492
00:24:49,743 --> 00:24:51,910
so it would really help me to know
where Jane came from.

493
00:24:52,811 --> 00:24:55,379
What inspired you?

494
00:24:55,381 --> 00:24:56,880
You know, well...

495
00:24:56,882 --> 00:24:59,083
Everything I've written,

496
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:02,619
everything my characters
experience, is authentic.

497
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:03,720
Um...

498
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:06,490
Yep! It all happened
to me in my life.

499
00:25:06,492 --> 00:25:09,126
It's all something I've lived
through at some point.

500
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:11,528
It's a very,
very personal story.

501
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,831
Anyone else have questions?
Yeah.

502
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:16,132
Um, on page 52,

503
00:25:16,134 --> 00:25:19,202
when Tim is having
that big fight with Jane?

504
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,675
Do you really think it's necessary
for him to hit her?

505
00:25:25,677 --> 00:25:28,711
I mean, isn't the whole point
that he's too repressed

506
00:25:28,713 --> 00:25:30,646
to show any emotion?

507
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:32,982
It just seems kind of...

508
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:37,787
Kind of what?

509
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:39,521
Well, I don't know.

510
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:42,791
Trite.
Oh, really, Will...

511
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:43,925
Is that necessary?

512
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:51,633
Uh, yeah...
I'm sorry.

513
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:55,470
- Oh, dear lord.
- Will?

514
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:56,671
Will, what is wrong
with you?

515
00:25:56,673 --> 00:26:00,509
Do you know how lucky you are,
to workshop with the actual playwright?

516
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:02,042
Jason is our honored guest.

517
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:04,545
And if you can't treat him
with the respect he deserves,

518
00:26:04,547 --> 00:26:07,481
then maybe we can find someone else
to star in his play.

519
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,049
Is that what you'd like?

520
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:11,719
No.
No. I didn't think so.

521
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:13,554
Did you take
your Ritalin today?

522
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:21,162
Forget it. I think this was
a very big mistake.

523
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,531
I shouldn't have even...
I'm so sorry...

524
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:26,166
I am not going let some high school
smartass tell me that my work is trite!

525
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,835
Of course not. You know what,
he's testing boundaries.

526
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,136
I deal with
this stuff every day.

527
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:31,604
You have to,
it's your job.

528
00:26:31,606 --> 00:26:32,872
I don't have to be doing this!
No, you don't.

529
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:33,973
You don't have
to do any of this.

530
00:26:33,975 --> 00:26:35,975
We so appreciate
you being here,

531
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:38,178
and the kids are so excited,
and they love your play.

532
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,879
No, they don't.
Yes, they do. They love it.

533
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:42,048
And they'd be crushed
if you pulled out now.

534
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,552
Not what's-his-name.
Mr. Trite. Will? What...

535
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:47,654
He's intimidated by you.
Oh, come on.

536
00:26:47,656 --> 00:26:51,023
He's just an insecure kid
in Kingston, Pennsylvania.

537
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:52,724
And you're
a New York playwright.

538
00:26:52,726 --> 00:26:53,992
Are you really going
to let him get to you?

539
00:26:53,994 --> 00:26:55,861
I think you're
stronger than that.

540
00:26:55,863 --> 00:26:58,363
And, Jason,
your work is brilliant.

541
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:04,469
Thank you. I'm sorry if
I'm overreacting a little bit,

542
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:07,506
I don't really know how to react
to criticism. No, no. Do not.

543
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:10,142
It's easy to feel discouraged,
but you shouldn't be.

544
00:27:10,144 --> 00:27:12,009
Not with something
like that.

545
00:27:13,746 --> 00:27:15,713
We're back.
Good.

546
00:27:15,715 --> 00:27:18,349
Uh, let's all rejoin
the circle, shall we?

547
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:22,019
I apologize for that.
No, no, no...

548
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:27,191
It's Will, right?

549
00:27:27,193 --> 00:27:31,696
Yeah. Look, man, I'm sorry
about what I said.

550
00:27:31,698 --> 00:27:34,631
No, don't be sorry.
I am...

551
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:36,266
I'm glad you brought it up.

552
00:27:37,702 --> 00:27:40,570
You're right.
Tim is repressed.

553
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:43,573
He's spent his whole life bottling
up everything he feels.

554
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:45,108
That's why he hates
Jane so much.

555
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:48,144
Because she represents
everything he isn't.

556
00:27:48,146 --> 00:27:50,146
She is wide open,

557
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:54,050
she actually feels things,
she can't hold back.

558
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:55,719
So when he hits her,
it's like all the rage

559
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:57,853
he's been suppressing over the years
finally boils over,

560
00:27:57,855 --> 00:27:59,088
and when it happens,

561
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,190
if it plays
the way it should,

562
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:03,192
it will not be trite.

563
00:28:05,795 --> 00:28:07,062
Does that answer
your question?

564
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:10,199
Um... Yeah.

565
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:11,567
Thanks.

566
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:12,701
Yeah.

567
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,837
Any other comments?

568
00:28:16,273 --> 00:28:18,274
Wonderful.
Let's move on.

569
00:28:18,276 --> 00:28:22,777
As many of you know, I too was once
a budding young actor.

570
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:24,846
Shocking, I know.

571
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:26,981
The year was 1983.

572
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:30,084
I was living in a fifth floor
walk-up on Avenue C,

573
00:28:30,086 --> 00:28:32,020
waiting for my big break.

574
00:28:32,022 --> 00:28:34,989
And then one day
I was called in to audition

575
00:28:34,991 --> 00:28:39,027
for that living God
of Theater himself,

576
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:40,194
Mr. Stephen Sondheim.

577
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:44,998
And though
I wasn't ultimately cast,

578
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,101
I did receive a blessing
from the great man himself,

579
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:52,372
who took me aside and said three
little words that changed my life.

580
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:54,474
"Keep at it."

581
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:59,012
Well, I did keep at it,

582
00:28:59,014 --> 00:29:03,150
and that's how I found my way here,
to Kingston, and to all of you.

583
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:05,852
And now, as we embark
on that...

584
00:29:05,854 --> 00:29:08,621
...tough but oh-so-rewarding
road ahead,

585
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:11,857
I would like to honor Mr. Sondheim with
a humble blessing of my own...

586
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:15,227
And if our young documentarian
would care to commence filming...

587
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,333
Okay, hit it, George.

588
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:31,176
# Bit by bit,
putting it together

589
00:29:31,178 --> 00:29:34,346
# Piece by piece,
the only way to make
a work of art

590
00:29:34,348 --> 00:29:36,147
# Every moment
makes a contribution

591
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,383
# Every little detail
plays a part

592
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:39,884
# Piece by piece...

593
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:42,854
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

594
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,627
Shut your mouth,
you stupid girl!

595
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:51,696
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

596
00:29:51,698 --> 00:29:53,231
Let me hear it
one more time.

597
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:54,898
Shut your mouth,
you stupid girl!

598
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,101
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

599
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:00,838
All the trees.

600
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,042
Watch, watch.
If a tree falls in a hallway...

601
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:07,778
...the entire world.

602
00:30:09,248 --> 00:30:12,383
Shut your mouth,
you stupid girl!

603
00:30:12,385 --> 00:30:14,451
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

604
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:18,654
Carl, could I have a word?

605
00:30:18,656 --> 00:30:20,256
Mmm-hmm.

606
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:21,457
Um...

607
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:26,963
It seems to me... And Carl...
Jason, uh, correct me if I'm wrong

608
00:30:26,965 --> 00:30:29,799
that Margaret might
be a tad more menacing

609
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:32,068
if she were just
a tiniest bit more subdued.

610
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,836
Yes. Thank you.

611
00:30:35,672 --> 00:30:38,875
You mean like Amanda
in  The Glass Menagerie?

612
00:30:38,877 --> 00:30:41,943
Dominating her children,
but with a deceptive softness.

613
00:30:41,945 --> 00:30:43,712
The velvet glove
and the iron grip.

614
00:30:43,714 --> 00:30:44,846
Exactly.

615
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,083
Hmm... Interesting.

616
00:30:50,253 --> 00:30:51,720
Let's try it.

617
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:54,222
Sheila,
I have an idea.

618
00:30:58,227 --> 00:31:00,028
That's a good note.

619
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,731
Shut your mouth,
you stupid girl.

620
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:05,833
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

621
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:06,967
Jason!

622
00:31:08,403 --> 00:31:09,937
Oh, shit.

623
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:12,072
I don't believe this.

624
00:31:12,074 --> 00:31:14,108
I need to talk to you outside.
Let's go.

625
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,844
Excuse me, but you can't just
barge in here like this.

626
00:31:16,846 --> 00:31:20,481
Excuse me, I'm gonna
talk to my son. Now!

627
00:31:20,483 --> 00:31:22,883
Let's go! Uh, no. I don't think
you understand...

628
00:31:22,885 --> 00:31:24,251
Ms. Sinclair,
it's fine.

629
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:26,220
Just go on without me, please.

630
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:29,989
Go on without me, guys.

631
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,157
I'll be right back.

632
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:37,130
Is he gonna be okay?

633
00:31:37,132 --> 00:31:38,965
Perhaps not.

634
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:41,434
But all great art
comes from pain.

635
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,904
Remember that.

636
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,986
...making such a crazy scene
right now!

637
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:02,888
What is going on here?

638
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,291
This is my school. And when I
see someone being manhandled,

639
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:07,926
it is my business.
Now wait a second...

640
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:13,464
challenging himself in ways that
any parent would be proud of.

641
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:15,533
And you finally show up,
and what do you do...

642
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,268
Do you show
any appreciation?

643
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,036
No! You drag him
from rehearsal.

644
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,939
Ms. Sinclair.
With all due respect,

645
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,141
you have no idea
what's going on here.

646
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:27,111
On the contrary.
I know exactly what's going on.

647
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,447
What... What are you talking about?
What is she talking about?

648
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:31,148
I've dealt with men like him before,
the alpha male.

649
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,551
You may fool most people,
but you don't fool me.

650
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:38,321
No, you do need to hear this! Oh,
all right then, go. Go!

651
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,290
But know this,
you cannot stop this play!

652
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,193
Jason will have the life
he deserves, as an artist!

653
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:45,195
Fine!

654
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:47,397
Oh. Oh, Jason...
It's my ulcer.

655
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:48,465
It's totally fine.
Here.

656
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,300
All right. Okay.

657
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,102
Let's get back inside,
all right?

658
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:53,270
Let's get you inside.

659
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:54,671
Oh, no.
Thank you.

660
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,208
Come on in. I think
I have something for you.

661
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,510
Oh, where is it,
where is it?

662
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:04,980
I forgot my pills at home.
Okay.

663
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:08,350
Oh... Oh, I found it.

664
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,685
Okay.
Oh.

665
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:13,088
This is still okay.

666
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,323
Okay.

667
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:20,496
It'll be gone
in like 10 minutes.

668
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,363
Okay.
Here you go.

669
00:33:26,835 --> 00:33:28,937
Oh...

670
00:33:32,341 --> 00:33:34,108
Thank you.

671
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,411
I'm just glad
I had that bottle.

672
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:38,580
No, I mean
thank you for what
you did outside.

673
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,982
For standing up
to him like that.

674
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:42,150
Well, you know what?

675
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:45,385
and someone needs to tell
him that he's wrong.

676
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:47,387
Yeah.

677
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:50,190
Well, he's been doing
that ever since my mother...

678
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:03,036
Jason...

679
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:08,574
I'm so sorry.

680
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,577
I am so, so sorry.

681
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:14,080
It's okay.

682
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:17,550
He's an asshole.

683
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:19,652
I know. I know.

684
00:34:19,654 --> 00:34:21,153
I know.

685
00:34:28,495 --> 00:34:29,662
Mmm.

686
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:02,593
Oops, sorry.

687
00:35:13,438 --> 00:35:14,672
Okay.

688
00:35:16,307 --> 00:35:19,275
I'm going to, uh,
head home now.

689
00:35:19,277 --> 00:35:20,476
Okay.

690
00:35:22,446 --> 00:35:24,647
And we'll talk a little later.
Mmm-hmm.

691
00:35:42,532 --> 00:35:45,233
What had she done?

692
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:47,235
What had she done?

693
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,606
Of course these things
do happen.

694
00:35:52,508 --> 00:35:56,211
The pages of literature
were filled with such affairs.

695
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,550
It was only natural that
feelings would arise and...

696
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:04,585
...spill over.

697
00:36:12,494 --> 00:36:17,164
Surely no one would judge her
for such a minor indiscretion.

698
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:33,279
Linda, dear.

699
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:36,549
I have a somewhat
delicate matter

700
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:38,284
to discuss with you.

701
00:36:38,286 --> 00:36:40,019
What? What is it?

702
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:42,555
Jason and I were
talking and...

703
00:36:43,691 --> 00:36:47,694
...we agree that the backdrop
in the Moth Queen's lair,

704
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:50,563
the scarlet organza has more
oomph than the voile,

705
00:36:50,565 --> 00:36:53,732
but it puts us
a tiny bit over budget.

706
00:36:53,734 --> 00:36:56,368
I hate to ask
but you did say...

707
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,536
How much?

708
00:37:00,707 --> 00:37:02,541
We shall hang
a plaque in your honor.

709
00:37:02,543 --> 00:37:04,576
Don't worry about it,
Carl, it's fine.

710
00:37:07,113 --> 00:37:09,448
I feel like if I had a cane,
I'd look more regal.

711
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,183
Hey, Ms. Sinclair.
Hello, Will.

712
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:13,819
Hey, did you speak to Kapinas
about the backdrop?

713
00:37:13,821 --> 00:37:17,321
Yes! Yes,
I spoke with Carl.

714
00:37:17,323 --> 00:37:19,857
May I have a private
word with you?

715
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:23,261
Yes. Sure.

716
00:37:23,263 --> 00:37:25,396
Shall we?
Please excuse us, Will.

717
00:37:25,398 --> 00:37:26,697
Okay.

718
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:29,267
We can, uh, talk in here.
Sure.

719
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:42,846
And while it is possible
for people of different ages

720
00:37:42,848 --> 00:37:44,648
to have a meaningful
relationship...

721
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,083
Sure.
I think...

722
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:50,086
It is best that
what happened,

723
00:37:50,088 --> 00:37:52,222
uh, does not
happen again.

724
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:56,493
Not that we did anything wrong.
No. Not at all.

725
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:58,595
Because of the play...
The, um...

726
00:37:58,597 --> 00:38:01,497
We must be professional.

727
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:03,365
The play requires
complete commitment

728
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:05,601
with no distractions
and no complications.

729
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:09,438
And as a playwright,
you need to keep a clear head

730
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,840
from now on in.

731
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:14,276
Right. Because the play's
the thing.

732
00:38:14,278 --> 00:38:15,544
Yes! The play
is the thing.

733
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:16,846
The play's the thing.
Yes!

734
00:38:16,848 --> 00:38:18,280
I'm glad
you're in agreement.

735
00:38:18,282 --> 00:38:20,649
So we're still friends?

736
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:22,885
Oh, Jason, of course.
No. Of course we're friends.

737
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:24,452
I was just worried for a second.
No, no, no.

738
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:27,222
You have more important things
to worry about,

739
00:38:27,224 --> 00:38:30,558
like whether or not Will nails that
funeral speech in Act two.

740
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,328
Right. Because he always loses
focus in the middle. He does.

741
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,798
Yes, he does, so you should get
out there and, um...

742
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,733
And work on that, so...
Yeah.

743
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:41,402
Well, I might
need your help.

744
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:43,404
Well, all right
then, um...

745
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:44,539
You will have it.

746
00:38:45,674 --> 00:38:47,708
Thank you.
Let's do it!

747
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:52,446
Um, well, no. Let's, uh,
we'll go out, and... Yeah.

748
00:39:03,157 --> 00:39:04,892
Excuse me.

749
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:09,196
Hi.

750
00:39:09,198 --> 00:39:11,497
Just so you know...

751
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:13,900
Just for the record
I did not go to the school

752
00:39:13,902 --> 00:39:15,268
because of the play.

753
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,903
I was there because
Jason lied to me.

754
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:18,604
Dr. Sherwood, I'm not interested.
No, no, no.

755
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,506
Just so you know...
On Tuesdays and Thursdays,

756
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:23,442
he's supposed to be taking LSAT
prep test up in Scranton.

757
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,878
He told me that these rehearsals
would in no way interfere with that,

758
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,814
and now I find out not only he's
been skipping the classes altogether,

759
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:30,316
but he lied to me.
Oh, come on!

760
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:31,517
You expect me to believe this?
Oh, no.

761
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,920
He sent this to me an hour before
I saw you yesterday.

762
00:39:34,922 --> 00:39:37,822
"Hi, Dad. On my way
to LSAT prep class.

763
00:39:37,824 --> 00:39:39,357
"Be back later tonight."

764
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,928
You see that, right?

765
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,330
Well, if he lied,

766
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:48,233
it's because he feels
he has no choice.

767
00:39:48,235 --> 00:39:51,603
How can he trust you?
You are crushing his spirit.

768
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:54,739
Forcing Jason to go
to law school is like...

769
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:56,941
Like using a Shakespeare
folio for toilet paper.

770
00:39:56,943 --> 00:40:00,210
"Forcing him!" I've never forced
Jason to do anything.

771
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:02,413
Going to law school
was entirely his idea.

772
00:40:02,415 --> 00:40:03,747
I'm sure you're
begging him not to go.

773
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:05,316
This is unbelievable.
Yes, it is.

774
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:06,617
You got me all figured out,
right.

775
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:08,319
There's nothing I can say
that won't convince you

776
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:09,620
I'm not a complete asshole?

777
00:40:09,622 --> 00:40:12,957
You could start by giving Jason
the respect

778
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:15,225
and the freedom
that he deserves.

779
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:16,961
Maybe I should stop
talking to him altogether?

780
00:40:16,963 --> 00:40:19,229
Would that work for you?
That might be an improvement, yeah.

781
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:20,697
Okay, you obviously
don't have any kids!

782
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:23,433
Excuse me! Excuse me!

783
00:40:23,435 --> 00:40:24,767
I have had
hundreds of kids,

784
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:26,436
and I have had
a lot of experience...

785
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:30,239
Hey, I'm doing the best that
I can with Jason.

786
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:33,076
Perhaps your best
isn't good enough.

787
00:40:33,978 --> 00:40:35,378
Is that what you tell
your students?

788
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,548
Oh, there is no comparison!
Do you know what?

789
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,615
You...

790
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:40,717
You are an asshole!

791
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:41,985
Huh?

792
00:40:41,987 --> 00:40:43,385
Asshole.

793
00:40:43,387 --> 00:40:45,320
I'm a rascal?
I said...

794
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:57,899
Hello.

795
00:40:57,901 --> 00:41:00,435
It's Linda.
Do you have a minute?

796
00:41:00,437 --> 00:41:01,937
Hey, Linda.

797
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:03,672
I just ran into
your father and...

798
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:05,007
Is that Ms. Sinclair?

799
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,941
Hi, Ms. Sinclair!

800
00:41:06,943 --> 00:41:09,410
Who's that?
Wait, look, um...

801
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:12,279
Halle's over.
Um, we're running lines.

802
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:13,948
Over? Are...

803
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,516
Are you still at school?

804
00:41:15,518 --> 00:41:17,718
Uh, no, my place.

805
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,421
Uh, it just seemed easier.

806
00:41:20,423 --> 00:41:21,822
Uh, is everything okay?

807
00:41:21,824 --> 00:41:24,325
Oh. Everything's fine.

808
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:25,926
I'm sorry to interrupt.

809
00:41:25,928 --> 00:41:27,695
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

810
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:29,062
Uh, okay.

811
00:41:29,064 --> 00:41:30,964
Uh, see you tomorrow.

812
00:41:30,966 --> 00:41:33,633
Bye, Ms. Sinclair!
Bye.

813
00:41:33,635 --> 00:41:36,569
Uh, shall we pick it up
where we left off?

814
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:42,609
So with tax and shipping,

815
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:45,712
it comes to $433.52 cents.

816
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,614
That includes
the smoke machine

817
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:49,649
and the slightly more
expensive strobe light.

818
00:41:49,651 --> 00:41:53,886
Oh, Carl, is all this
really necessary?

819
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:56,388
Well, it is if you want the magic
of the play to work.

820
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,657
But if you're content to see
The Chrysalis undermined

821
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:02,461
I'll run out and buy two
flashlights and a Lazy Susan.

822
00:42:02,463 --> 00:42:04,329
Oh, calm down,
I was only asking.

823
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:05,497
Sorry.

824
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:13,005
Halle's doing spectacularly well,
don't you think?

825
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:14,673
Oh. Bless you.

826
00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:19,510
Stop.

827
00:42:23,649 --> 00:42:26,784
I can't believe Mr. Adams gave us
that quiz!

828
00:42:26,786 --> 00:42:28,619
Halle...

829
00:42:28,621 --> 00:42:30,788
May I speak with
you a moment, please?

830
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:36,160
Take a seat.

831
00:42:41,899 --> 00:42:43,834
Well, first of all,

832
00:42:43,836 --> 00:42:47,804
I want to tell you what a fantastic job
you're doing as Jane.

833
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:50,807
Oh! Thanks. I've been working
my butt off,

834
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:52,576
but I love it.

835
00:42:52,578 --> 00:42:56,446
I know how important
this play is to you,

836
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,749
and I wouldn't want
anything to jeopardize that.

837
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:01,784
Whoa, wait.
Am I in trouble?

838
00:43:01,786 --> 00:43:04,053
No, no, no, no.
Everything's fine.

839
00:43:04,055 --> 00:43:05,187
It's just, um...

840
00:43:06,723 --> 00:43:09,558
Well, um...

841
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,694
It's about Jason.

842
00:43:11,696 --> 00:43:13,929
Some of us have noticed,

843
00:43:13,931 --> 00:43:16,065
uh, that your behavior
with him lately

844
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:17,933
has been a little
inappropriate.

845
00:43:17,935 --> 00:43:19,135
I haven't done anything.

846
00:43:19,137 --> 00:43:20,936
I know, but appearances
are important.

847
00:43:20,938 --> 00:43:22,738
And people tend
to make assumptions.

848
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,806
Well, they shouldn't!

849
00:43:23,808 --> 00:43:26,074
I know, I know.
But...

850
00:43:26,076 --> 00:43:27,242
They do.

851
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:33,581
Now, I understand that
you want to pursue acting

852
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:35,316
as a career.
Is that true?

853
00:43:36,919 --> 00:43:39,821
May I offer
you some advice?

854
00:43:39,823 --> 00:43:41,556
As you go out
on auditions,

855
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:43,825
you'll be meeting a lot of men,
powerful men,

856
00:43:43,827 --> 00:43:47,562
who may be interested in you for
reasons other than your talent.

857
00:43:47,564 --> 00:43:49,696
Now you're a very
attractive young woman,

858
00:43:49,698 --> 00:43:52,132
and you may be tempted
to take advantage of that.

859
00:43:52,134 --> 00:43:54,434
In the short term,
that may work.

860
00:43:54,436 --> 00:43:57,804
But in the long term, people might lose
respect for you.

861
00:43:57,806 --> 00:44:00,974
And they may find
you a little, um, trashy.

862
00:44:00,976 --> 00:44:04,111
I know I sound harsh, but it's only because
I care about you,

863
00:44:04,113 --> 00:44:06,980
and I want you to earn the respect
that you deserve as a woman,

864
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:09,883
not because of your body,
but because of your mind.

865
00:44:09,885 --> 00:44:13,753
And that is why you need
to stay away from Jason.

866
00:44:13,755 --> 00:44:15,021
Am I making any sense?

867
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:21,861
It just seems really unfair.

868
00:44:21,863 --> 00:44:24,163
Guys can get away with anything,
but girls can't.

869
00:44:24,165 --> 00:44:25,865
I know. It is unfair.

870
00:44:25,867 --> 00:44:28,601
But, unfortunately, that's the world
in which we live.

871
00:44:28,603 --> 00:44:29,735
I wish it weren't.

872
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:32,538
Oh, so do I.

873
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,240
But I have learned
from experience that wishing

874
00:44:36,142 --> 00:44:37,609
doesn't always make it so.

875
00:44:37,611 --> 00:44:40,946
Changing the world is hard work,
but we can do it.

876
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:44,816
We women just have to
stick together, that's all.

877
00:44:48,488 --> 00:44:50,822
I'm so glad we had
this conversation.

878
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:54,025
Go ahead to lunch, go on.
And I'll see you at rehearsal.

879
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:55,694
Yeah.

880
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:57,095
See ya.
Okay.

881
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:11,175
And at $800, the fake fireplace
is a real bargain.

882
00:45:12,077 --> 00:45:14,211
Don't play
with that, fellas.

883
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:15,346
Sorry.

884
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,850
Oh, Linda,
what can I say.

885
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:23,653
You are like the Peggy Guggenheim of
high school theater.

886
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:24,854
But prettier.

887
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:33,963
Oh!

888
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,566
Oh! Ah!
I don't believe this.

889
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:40,003
She is a student, Jason.
Linda, Linda just hang on...

890
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:41,938
What a scummy,
sleazy thing to do!

891
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,905
I know.
And you!

892
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,207
I expected better from you.

893
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,075
I'm sorry.
No. It's too late.

894
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,611
This is going on
your permanent record.

895
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:53,582
No. You, you can forget about that
letter of recommendation.

896
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,083
What!
You can't do that!

897
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:57,085
You've left me no choice.

898
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,087
Linda.

899
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,789
Linda! Oh my God. My parents
are going to kill me!

900
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,024
No, no, no.
It's fine.

901
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:03,792
Just sit down. Relax, okay.
No, they are!

902
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,060
I'm going to go take care of it...
Linda!

903
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,228
What?

904
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:09,897
Hey, Linda.

905
00:46:09,899 --> 00:46:11,232
Can we talk
about this, please?

906
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:13,200
No. I don't need to
talk about anything.

907
00:46:13,202 --> 00:46:14,602
I know what I saw.

908
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:16,671
But we didn't do anything!
Oh, how dare you.

909
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:17,872
I catch you fooling
around with a student,

910
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:20,808
She started it.
I didn't start it.

911
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:23,778
You know, you're a
role model to these kids.

912
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,814
To take advantage
like that, that is...

913
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:28,115
Unconscionable!

914
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:33,787
I thought you were ready to be
a professional, but apparently not.

915
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:36,323
Because this was
an amateur move, Jason.

916
00:46:36,325 --> 00:46:37,657
Amateur!

917
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:38,758
This is bullshit.

918
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,893
Excuse me?

919
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:40,994
You're jealous!

920
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:46,266
As if I'd be jealous of some
dirty little make out session

921
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:47,701
in the boys'
dressing room.

922
00:46:47,703 --> 00:46:49,602
No, you'd rather have a quick fuck
in the classroom

923
00:46:49,604 --> 00:46:53,106
Is that what you want? You want me
to bend you over your desk right now?

924
00:46:53,108 --> 00:46:54,139
You are awful!
God knows you need it...

925
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:55,507
You are awful!

926
00:46:58,745 --> 00:46:59,945
Shit.

927
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:02,014
Hit me with a piece of fucking prop...

928
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:43,053
Take me off your goddamn list,
and never call me again!

929
00:48:24,961 --> 00:48:27,829
Fallon Hughes.
Here.

930
00:48:27,831 --> 00:48:29,964
Ed McKee.
Ho.

931
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:33,968
Benjamin Meyer.

932
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,804
Ho!

933
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:37,872
What is the matter
with you people?

934
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:39,707
Settle down.

935
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,509
Or you're looking at detention!
Is that clear?

936
00:49:21,782 --> 00:49:24,450
And 'cause the theme this year is
"Winter Dreamz,"

937
00:49:24,452 --> 00:49:28,254
I thought we could have giant beds
and snowmen in PJ's...

938
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:31,123
No, no, that is
a horrible idea.

939
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:33,092
I need to talk.
Linda!

940
00:49:33,094 --> 00:49:35,760
Okay, Joni, lets... Let's talk about
it tomorrow.

941
00:49:35,762 --> 00:49:37,295
But this is
"Winter Dreamz."

942
00:49:37,297 --> 00:49:38,630
Out.

943
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:43,034
Something terrible
has happened...

944
00:49:43,036 --> 00:49:48,039
you and Shakespeare doing
it in the classroom!

945
00:49:49,175 --> 00:49:53,345
Because Halle Anderson is spreading
vicious rumors about me,

946
00:49:53,347 --> 00:49:57,482
and I just caught her defacing my
classroom door with obscenities!

947
00:49:57,484 --> 00:49:59,884
Why would Halle do that?

948
00:49:59,886 --> 00:50:00,951
Why?

949
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:02,920
Because yesterday,
I caught her

950
00:50:02,922 --> 00:50:05,055
messing around with Jason Sherwood
in the boys' dressing room!

951
00:50:05,057 --> 00:50:06,190
That's why!

952
00:50:06,192 --> 00:50:09,260
Ow! Ow...
Oh, God. Oh, God...

953
00:50:09,262 --> 00:50:10,528
You should have told us.

954
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,929
I gave her a warning.

955
00:50:11,931 --> 00:50:13,464
I just... I thought that
would be enough.

956
00:50:13,466 --> 00:50:15,466
I didn't expect
all this to happen.

957
00:50:15,468 --> 00:50:16,834
Typical.

958
00:50:16,836 --> 00:50:18,836
You know, good teacher
lets a student off easy,

959
00:50:18,838 --> 00:50:20,371
she turns around
and stabs her in the back.

960
00:50:20,373 --> 00:50:23,239
And him, messing around
with one of our kids,

961
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:24,941
I'll knock his block off!

962
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:27,210
Where... Where is Halle now?
In rehearsal?

963
00:50:27,212 --> 00:50:30,280
Yes, but I don't think...

964
00:50:30,282 --> 00:50:33,249
Do we really have to do this now?
In front of everyone?

965
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:35,018
I thought you'd just pull her
into your office.

966
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:37,287
No. We've got to clean this mess up
before it gets any worse.

967
00:50:37,289 --> 00:50:40,089
These types of rumors can do real
damage to a teacher's reputation.

968
00:50:40,091 --> 00:50:43,026
Even one as sterling as yours.
But I'd really rather not...

969
00:50:43,028 --> 00:50:45,594
Damn it, Linda. These punks
took advantage of you!

970
00:50:45,596 --> 00:50:49,031
and tell them you're not going
to roll over for their B.S.

971
00:50:50,233 --> 00:50:52,134
You!

972
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,835
And you! Get over here,
right now.

973
00:50:53,837 --> 00:50:57,172
What's the meaning of this, Phil?
We're trying to rehearse.

974
00:50:57,174 --> 00:50:58,574
Yep. Well, rehearsal's
gonna wait.

975
00:50:59,576 --> 00:51:01,376
It seems
Romeo and Juliet here

976
00:51:01,378 --> 00:51:03,612
have been fooling around a little bit
after play practice, huh.

977
00:51:03,614 --> 00:51:04,913
What on earth
are you talking about?

978
00:51:04,915 --> 00:51:06,214
And to top it all off,

979
00:51:06,216 --> 00:51:08,382
sweet little Juliet
has been spreading

980
00:51:08,384 --> 00:51:10,518
some pretty nasty lies about
one of our best teachers.

981
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,119
They're not lies!

982
00:51:12,121 --> 00:51:13,921
She's just jealous,
because he's with me now!

983
00:51:13,923 --> 00:51:15,089
So you admit it?
Oh, Christ.

984
00:51:15,091 --> 00:51:17,525
Oh, Halle, really?
It's true!

985
00:51:17,527 --> 00:51:19,493
She did him in her room.
Everyone knows!

986
00:51:19,495 --> 00:51:23,197
You are digging a very
big hole for yourself, right now.

987
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:25,099
Where are you going, Halle?
You get back here, miss!

988
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:26,233
Halle...

989
00:51:26,235 --> 00:51:28,603
Hey, what's with
all the shouting?

990
00:51:28,605 --> 00:51:31,038
Oh. Traynor, what the
hell is that?

991
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,238
Oh, good Lord.

992
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,275
It's for my big
suicide at the end.

993
00:51:36,378 --> 00:51:37,877
No, sir, it is not!

994
00:51:37,879 --> 00:51:39,279
Hey, we had an agreement!

995
00:51:39,281 --> 00:51:42,082
What? I'm sorry...
What agreement?

996
00:51:42,084 --> 00:51:47,487
Don't play dumb, Romeo. Now, you know
damn well we had to cut that ending!

997
00:51:47,489 --> 00:51:48,688
What?

998
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:51,524
What? What?

999
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:54,027
Why are you even
rehearsing this ending?

1000
00:51:54,029 --> 00:51:55,628
You trying to pull
one over on me, Carl? Huh?

1001
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,162
You want to get
yourself fired?

1002
00:51:57,164 --> 00:51:59,665
You have it all wrong,
Phil, as usual.

1003
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:05,437
Yes. I wanted the actors to experience
the full darkness of Jason's play.

1004
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:07,606
But it was never my intention to
perform the ending.

1005
00:52:07,608 --> 00:52:09,508
After all,
we did agree to cut it.

1006
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:13,445
Carl, what the hell? You never said
I had to cut the ending!

1007
00:52:13,447 --> 00:52:14,947
You never said that.

1008
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:17,216
But it wasn't
my place to tell you.

1009
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,384
It was my understanding that
Linda cleared it with you

1010
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,919
when you signed the contract.
Carl. No.

1011
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:23,421
You knew?
Carl. No.

1012
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,056
You knew?
No. No...

1013
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,158
You did read the contract,
didn't you?

1014
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,927
She forced me to sign it, without
actually reading it.

1015
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:31,462
You never told me
I'd have to cut the ending,

1016
00:52:31,464 --> 00:52:33,197
because you knew I would
never agree to it!

1017
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:35,199
No, no, no...
Linda, is this true?

1018
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:36,501
No...

1019
00:52:36,503 --> 00:52:38,169
No...
Is it true?

1020
00:52:38,171 --> 00:52:39,537
Is that true?

1021
00:52:41,205 --> 00:52:43,607
Yes, but I can explain...

1022
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:47,177
As if I'd be jealous of some
dirty little make out session

1023
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:51,448
with one of your old students.
Shh. Stop it!

1024
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:55,218
God knows you need it...
You're awful! You're awful!

1025
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,620
Oh, my...
Wow...

1026
00:52:57,955 --> 00:52:59,623
Oops.

1027
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:01,024
Told you.

1028
00:53:01,026 --> 00:53:02,959
She's a lying old whore.

1029
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:05,461
She's, uh... Where...
Linda, you're fired. Oh.

1030
00:53:05,463 --> 00:53:07,363
You better run.
You hear me!

1031
00:53:07,365 --> 00:53:09,231
You are fired, lady!

1032
00:53:09,233 --> 00:53:11,300
Yeah, who's trashy now?

1033
00:53:11,302 --> 00:53:13,502
Hey, Linda! Linda!

1034
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:16,238
Leave me alone!
Don't run away from me.

1035
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,107
How could you lie
to me like that?

1036
00:53:18,109 --> 00:53:19,308
I trusted you.

1037
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,010
And you sat there
and you lied to my face!

1038
00:53:21,012 --> 00:53:23,379
Get away, get away!
Oh! Fuck! No!

1039
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:25,414
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! No!

1040
00:53:27,085 --> 00:53:28,650
Not again!

1041
00:53:29,618 --> 00:53:33,254
Fuck! I fucking
hate this school.

1042
00:54:12,528 --> 00:54:16,229
Ma'am, you've been in an accident,
okay. You're in the hospital.

1043
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:18,564
No, you're going
to be just fine.

1044
00:54:18,566 --> 00:54:19,699
No, I won't.

1045
00:54:19,701 --> 00:54:22,368
Yes, you will.
I promise.

1046
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,537
Oh. Hi, Dr. Sherwood.

1047
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:27,073
No, no, not him.
Someone else.

1048
00:54:27,075 --> 00:54:29,075
Get me someone else, please.

1049
00:54:29,077 --> 00:54:31,511
Honey, there's no one else unless
you want to wait a few hours.

1050
00:54:31,513 --> 00:54:33,346
I'll wait. I can wait.
Please...

1051
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,448
Um, I...

1052
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,616
Can you, uh,
excuse us, Nurse?

1053
00:54:37,618 --> 00:54:39,050
Oh, sure.

1054
00:54:39,052 --> 00:54:41,453
Um, I think
she's still in shock.

1055
00:54:41,455 --> 00:54:44,856
Don't worry, honey,
you're in good hands.

1056
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:51,897
This is awkward.

1057
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,401
It says here you
were in a car accident

1058
00:54:56,403 --> 00:54:59,738
after you rubbed pepper spray
into your eyes?

1059
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,541
Wow...

1060
00:55:05,777 --> 00:55:07,745
Okay.

1061
00:55:07,747 --> 00:55:09,613
Have you any dizziness?

1062
00:55:09,615 --> 00:55:11,215
No.
No?

1063
00:55:12,284 --> 00:55:13,851
Any nausea?
No.

1064
00:55:16,087 --> 00:55:18,088
Neck pain?
Yes.

1065
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,356
Where?

1066
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,859
Up here?
Mmm-hmm.

1067
00:55:23,494 --> 00:55:24,627
Does that hurt?

1068
00:55:25,763 --> 00:55:28,097
Yeah...

1069
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:30,433
How severe, as if on a scale
of one to 10?

1070
00:55:30,435 --> 00:55:33,670
I don't know.
Three? Five?

1071
00:55:33,672 --> 00:55:37,807
I don't know, it's something we have
to ask in the hospital.

1072
00:55:38,776 --> 00:55:40,844
All right, let's take
a look at this.

1073
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:46,515
Okay.

1074
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:50,118
It's going to sting.

1075
00:55:55,725 --> 00:55:58,594
Well, that's not so bad.

1076
00:55:58,596 --> 00:56:00,896
I'll have a nurse
clean this up.

1077
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:02,564
You're actually
a very lucky woman.

1078
00:56:02,566 --> 00:56:04,533
I don't think you're going to
need stitches.

1079
00:56:17,713 --> 00:56:19,280
Okay.

1080
00:56:20,682 --> 00:56:22,783
Here you are, here...

1081
00:56:22,785 --> 00:56:24,819
It's good to get
it out like that.

1082
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:27,288
Could you please leave?

1083
00:56:29,157 --> 00:56:31,292
Listen, you've been through
a very physical trauma.

1084
00:56:31,294 --> 00:56:32,692
It's perfectly
normal to have...

1085
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:34,427
No, please.
Please...

1086
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:37,264
Honestly, emotional outbursts
like this are very common.

1087
00:56:37,266 --> 00:56:39,366
Stop it. Stop being
so nice to me.

1088
00:56:39,368 --> 00:56:42,435
You hate me.
I know you hate me.

1089
00:56:42,437 --> 00:56:45,305
I don't hate you.
Ms. Sinclair, listen...

1090
00:56:45,307 --> 00:56:48,875
I know we've had our differences,
I know that.

1091
00:56:49,777 --> 00:56:52,479
But you know, I...

1092
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:56,181
Honestly, I appreciate everything
that you have done for Jason.

1093
00:56:56,183 --> 00:56:57,616
Oh, God.

1094
00:56:57,618 --> 00:57:01,787
And I can tell you right now,
you mean the world to him.

1095
00:57:06,459 --> 00:57:09,495
What? What am I saying?

1096
00:57:12,866 --> 00:57:14,767
I...

1097
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:24,475
Had sex with your son.

1098
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:27,011
What?

1099
00:57:28,213 --> 00:57:29,614
You heard me.

1100
00:57:33,886 --> 00:57:35,753
How long...

1101
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:38,756
How long has this
been going on?

1102
00:57:39,892 --> 00:57:42,893
Is it a relationship?
No! It was one time...

1103
00:57:42,895 --> 00:57:45,329
When did this happen?

1104
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:46,863
Can we be done now?

1105
00:57:46,865 --> 00:57:49,333
No. No, we can't be done.

1106
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:50,634
We're not done until...

1107
00:57:50,636 --> 00:57:52,235
What...
What's wrong with you?

1108
00:57:53,305 --> 00:57:56,573
You go around sleeping
with your old students?

1109
00:57:56,575 --> 00:57:57,908
I don't want
to talk about it.

1110
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,242
You're the one
who brought it up.

1111
00:57:59,244 --> 00:58:01,645
No, don't you have
something important to do?

1112
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:03,880
Don't you have a life
to save or something?

1113
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:10,453
I'm going to have someone
take you to orthopedics.

1114
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,862
Ma'am, your card
was denied.

1115
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:21,597
Mmm-hmm.

1116
00:58:25,402 --> 00:58:26,936
Okay, try this one.

1117
00:58:26,938 --> 00:58:28,636
Okay.

1118
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:30,538
Can someone call me a cab?

1119
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:38,680
Jason, okay, calm down.
Jason, I understand. No.

1120
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,281
Turn around. Take me back.
Take me back inside.

1121
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,816
What? What?
Take me back.

1122
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:45,653
Lady! I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

1123
00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,689
Let me call you back. Okay?
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1124
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,458
It's okay. I'm fine.
Mike. Mike.

1125
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,959
I'll take her, it's fine.
I'll wait with her.

1126
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:53,327
No, no, no.
I'm going to wait inside.

1127
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,762
No, no.
I need to talk to you.

1128
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,630
Take the chair
inside, please.

1129
00:59:00,536 --> 00:59:02,569
How's your neck?

1130
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:04,705
Just say what you need to say
and leave me alone.

1131
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,642
Is it true? Did you lie
to Jason about the play?

1132
00:59:09,944 --> 00:59:11,612
Yes. Yes, I did.

1133
00:59:12,847 --> 00:59:14,947
I don't believe it.

1134
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:17,450
What kind of
teacher are you?

1135
00:59:17,452 --> 00:59:20,653
I mean, you come at me with
this holier than thou bullshit,

1136
00:59:20,655 --> 00:59:22,922
and this is what you do?
What's wrong with you?

1137
00:59:22,924 --> 00:59:24,724
Fine, fine. I get it.
I'm horrible,

1138
00:59:24,726 --> 00:59:27,360
I'm a horrible person.
Now would you leave?

1139
00:59:27,362 --> 00:59:29,062
No. Not until you tell me what
you're going to do about this.

1140
00:59:29,064 --> 00:59:32,465
You know, I've been fired.
Isn't that enough?

1141
00:59:32,467 --> 00:59:34,434
What about the play?
Oh, who cares about the play.

1142
00:59:34,436 --> 00:59:37,103
I do! I care about the play.
I care about my son.

1143
00:59:37,105 --> 00:59:39,638
Yeah! Now you care. Fine. Now that
everything's ruined.

1144
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,475
This is all your fault. I wouldn't
even be here if it wasn't for you.

1145
00:59:43,477 --> 00:59:44,876
I don't know where
you possibly get that.

1146
00:59:44,878 --> 00:59:46,478
He never would have
written the play

1147
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,347
if you hadn't been such an abusive,
alcoholic jerk.

1148
00:59:49,349 --> 00:59:52,350
Who took out all your anger on
your son after your wife died.

1149
00:59:52,352 --> 00:59:53,952
Oh, my God.

1150
00:59:53,954 --> 00:59:55,921
Is that what
this is about?

1151
00:59:55,923 --> 00:59:58,090
You believe all that?
Don't try to deny it.

1152
00:59:58,092 --> 01:00:00,926
No, no, no. I don't drink,
for your information.

1153
01:00:00,928 --> 01:00:03,094
I haven't had a drink
since medical school.

1154
01:00:03,096 --> 01:00:04,829
Jason's mom isn't dead.

1155
01:00:04,831 --> 01:00:08,966
She lives up in Teaneck.
She's remarried.

1156
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:13,804
He... He said it was
based on his life.

1157
01:00:13,806 --> 01:00:16,740
Oh, well, jeez, if Jason said it then
it must be true, right?

1158
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:19,910
God knows there's never been a writer
that just made stuff up.

1159
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:23,714
You think he turns
into a monster as well?

1160
01:00:23,716 --> 01:00:25,381
Okay. I get it.
Do you?

1161
01:00:25,383 --> 01:00:28,551
Because for an Advanced English teacher
you seem awfully naive to me.

1162
01:00:28,553 --> 01:00:30,687
Or is your head so full
of, of these stories

1163
01:00:30,689 --> 01:00:33,523
you don't know the difference
between fact and fiction.

1164
01:00:33,525 --> 01:00:35,158
Is that why
you slept with him?

1165
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,526
Huh?

1166
01:00:36,528 --> 01:00:37,694
Thought he was Lord Byron
or something?

1167
01:00:37,696 --> 01:00:39,129
You know what?
You don't know me.

1168
01:00:39,131 --> 01:00:40,730
You don't know
anything about me.

1169
01:00:40,732 --> 01:00:43,900
Oh, shoe's on the other foot.

1170
01:00:43,902 --> 01:00:45,935
Marilyn Avenue.

1171
01:00:45,937 --> 01:00:48,437
Hey, you can't
run away from this.

1172
01:00:48,439 --> 01:00:49,638
Yes, I can.

1173
01:00:54,445 --> 01:00:58,113
Hi, it's Linda.
Leave a message.

1174
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:02,217
Linda, it's Carl.

1175
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,554
I know I behaved abominably,

1176
01:01:05,556 --> 01:01:07,823
you have every right
to be mad,

1177
01:01:07,825 --> 01:01:10,459
but please call me.

1178
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:12,226
It's about the play.

1179
01:01:13,595 --> 01:01:15,596
Hi, it's Linda.
Leave a message.

1180
01:01:17,167 --> 01:01:19,133
Linda, call me,
I beg of you.

1181
01:01:19,135 --> 01:01:21,002
I swear I'll never
deceive you again.

1182
01:01:21,004 --> 01:01:23,171
I'll be entirely
honest from now on.

1183
01:01:23,173 --> 01:01:25,606
I'll...

1184
01:01:25,608 --> 01:01:29,977
I'll even tell you
my deepest, darkest secret.

1185
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:31,579
Something
I've never told anyone.

1186
01:01:32,848 --> 01:01:34,981
My audition for Sondheim...

1187
01:01:36,618 --> 01:01:38,218
I lied.

1188
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:41,454
I... I did have
an audition, but...

1189
01:01:41,456 --> 01:01:44,991
As soon as I walked in
and saw him sitting there,

1190
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:48,995
looking at me with those dark genius eyes,
I couldn't breathe.

1191
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,864
I thought
I was going to die.

1192
01:01:50,866 --> 01:01:53,733
The last thing I remember
before I blacked out

1193
01:01:53,735 --> 01:01:57,937
was the look of utter confusion
on Sondheim's face.

1194
01:01:57,939 --> 01:02:00,906
And the sound of
the stage manager saying,

1195
01:02:00,908 --> 01:02:03,242
"I think his
name is Ka-penis."

1196
01:02:04,945 --> 01:02:07,146
It was the worst
experience of my life.

1197
01:02:09,082 --> 01:02:11,951
So there it is.

1198
01:02:12,886 --> 01:02:15,955
I stand naked before you.

1199
01:02:15,957 --> 01:02:18,490
Please come back.
Help me out.

1200
01:02:18,492 --> 01:02:24,662
Linda, I'm having
a nervous breakdown!

1201
01:02:24,664 --> 01:02:26,531
I'm having chest pains.

1202
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:28,166
And a nervous breakdown!

1203
01:02:29,235 --> 01:02:31,035
Call me!

1204
01:02:33,807 --> 01:02:35,173
Uh!

1205
01:02:42,915 --> 01:02:44,648
There has been
an emergency.

1206
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:45,782
Carl is in the hospital.

1207
01:02:45,784 --> 01:02:48,952
And, well, he keeled over
during rehearsal.

1208
01:02:48,954 --> 01:02:51,054
And the kids called 911.
They're beside themselves.

1209
01:02:51,056 --> 01:02:54,825
Well, it wasn't a heart attack,
thank goodness.

1210
01:02:54,827 --> 01:02:56,660
They think stress.
Stress.

1211
01:02:56,662 --> 01:02:58,695
But there's no way
he can finish the play.

1212
01:02:58,697 --> 01:03:01,298
And we are days away
from opening night,

1213
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,100
there's a ton
of work to do.

1214
01:03:03,102 --> 01:03:05,636
And we've sold
$18,000 in tickets.

1215
01:03:05,638 --> 01:03:09,005
We need the money.
Someone needs to step in.

1216
01:03:10,974 --> 01:03:13,142
Yeah, you
should call Jason.

1217
01:03:13,144 --> 01:03:15,011
Oh...
I did.

1218
01:03:15,013 --> 01:03:17,980
And he refuses to help unless we
restore the original ending.

1219
01:03:17,982 --> 01:03:19,949
Which, no, we cannot do.

1220
01:03:21,819 --> 01:03:25,755
No. No, no, Trudie.
No, forget it. I'm not doing it.

1221
01:03:25,757 --> 01:03:27,256
I know,
it's not ideal.

1222
01:03:27,258 --> 01:03:28,824
Ideal? You fired me!

1223
01:03:28,826 --> 01:03:30,158
Not officially, not yet.

1224
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,260
And if you agree to help,
I'm willing to let you off

1225
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:35,297
with just a little formal reprimand
and that's it...

1226
01:03:35,299 --> 01:03:37,999
Okay, two weeks' suspension.
That's if...

1227
01:03:38,001 --> 01:03:39,701
I can't. I can't.
I can't. I can't do it.

1228
01:03:39,703 --> 01:03:41,736
You started this.

1229
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:43,705
Are you going
to really sit back

1230
01:03:43,707 --> 01:03:46,241
and let everyone else
pay for your mistakes?

1231
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:49,978
I need you,
the kids need you to...

1232
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:53,681
To just step up and be a
goddamned teacher here.

1233
01:03:53,683 --> 01:03:57,184
And if you can't do that,
you have no business in a classroom.

1234
01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:05,092
I want to
think about it.

1235
01:04:05,094 --> 01:04:06,126
Oh, well...

1236
01:04:06,128 --> 01:04:08,862
I expect you
there at 3:00.

1237
01:04:10,665 --> 01:04:12,966
Okay. This is the last
chance you're gonna get.

1238
01:04:26,381 --> 01:04:30,149
Hey, Ms. Sinclair, I wanna bend you
over your desk!

1239
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:36,689
"Mother. Oh, my dear mother.
How could you..."

1240
01:04:36,691 --> 01:04:39,025
No, no. Come on. Come on.
It's got to be louder.

1241
01:04:39,027 --> 01:04:41,760
You got to get them in the cheap seats.
Come on. Loud.

1242
01:04:41,762 --> 01:04:46,231
Come on, support it. "How could
you abandon me to such a cruel..."

1243
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,870
Thank God.
All right, listen up, people.

1244
01:04:51,872 --> 01:04:55,240
Uh, Ms. Sinclair is going to
take over from here on out.

1245
01:04:55,242 --> 01:04:58,009
But listen, I'm going to be sitting
here in the front row,

1246
01:04:58,011 --> 01:05:00,679
and I don't want
any funny business, okay?

1247
01:05:00,681 --> 01:05:02,780
Is that clear?

1248
01:05:02,782 --> 01:05:04,181
Yes, Mr. Pelaski.

1249
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:13,424
Could somebody please
tell me where we are?

1250
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:16,026
We're doing the new ending.

1251
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:19,797
New ending?

1252
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:22,466
Yeah, Carl wrote it. They were
working on it when he collapsed.

1253
01:05:23,436 --> 01:05:27,837
Yeah, as long as nobody kills
themselves, it's good with me.

1254
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,480
Fine. Let's just do this.

1255
01:05:39,049 --> 01:05:40,450
Go ahead.

1256
01:05:40,452 --> 01:05:42,352
Do you have
any direction?

1257
01:05:44,455 --> 01:05:45,822
Um...

1258
01:05:45,824 --> 01:05:47,257
You're in pain.

1259
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:50,826
You're in deep,
unbearable pain.

1260
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:55,330
"Mother!
Oh, my dear mother!

1261
01:05:55,332 --> 01:05:57,833
"How could you abandon
me to such a cruel fate!"

1262
01:05:57,835 --> 01:06:00,102
Okay, Halle. "A father
who couldn't love me!

1263
01:06:00,104 --> 01:06:02,337
"A world where I'd never belong!"
That's enough.

1264
01:06:02,339 --> 01:06:04,706
"Oh, God!
I want to die..."

1265
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:07,476
No, my darling!
You must live! Live!

1266
01:06:07,478 --> 01:06:10,078
Knock it off,
both of you!

1267
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,346
Take it seriously.
Why?

1268
01:06:12,348 --> 01:06:15,249
It sucks.
This ending sucks.

1269
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:18,519
My grandparents are coming in
from Tucson to see me suck.

1270
01:06:19,455 --> 01:06:21,889
This isn't Jason's play anymore.
It's bullshit.

1271
01:06:21,891 --> 01:06:23,090
Hey! Language.

1272
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:26,260
Where's Jason?

1273
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:27,862
We want Jason back.

1274
01:06:27,864 --> 01:06:32,233
Okay, that's it.
One week detention, Miss Anderson!

1275
01:06:55,122 --> 01:06:56,923
Yes. I'm coming.

1276
01:07:02,162 --> 01:07:04,897
Jason, please don't make
me stand outside.

1277
01:07:04,899 --> 01:07:08,434
I'm gonna... I'm not going to leave
here until we talk.

1278
01:07:12,973 --> 01:07:14,773
May I come in?

1279
01:07:14,775 --> 01:07:16,008
Yeah.

1280
01:07:23,883 --> 01:07:25,416
May I have
a glass of water?

1281
01:07:36,328 --> 01:07:38,563
I'm here to ask for a favor.
Are you kidding me?

1282
01:07:38,565 --> 01:07:40,131
If you could just
write a new ending.

1283
01:07:40,133 --> 01:07:42,066
No. No. No.

1284
01:07:42,068 --> 01:07:44,235
Write a new ending?
Jason, please...

1285
01:07:44,237 --> 01:07:46,470
For what? To make it happy?
To make it cute and safe?

1286
01:07:46,472 --> 01:07:50,173
I understand that, but I'm in an
untenable situation here...

1287
01:07:50,175 --> 01:07:54,311
slap a feel-good ending
on  Death of a Salesman.

1288
01:07:54,313 --> 01:07:55,946
Does he really have to die?

1289
01:07:55,948 --> 01:07:57,314
This isn't helping anyone.

1290
01:07:57,316 --> 01:07:58,482
That's because
nothing's gonna help.

1291
01:07:58,484 --> 01:08:00,050
Everything's fucked,
and it's your fault!

1292
01:08:02,253 --> 01:08:03,820
I want to kill myself.

1293
01:08:03,822 --> 01:08:05,255
That's not an answer, Jason.

1294
01:08:06,991 --> 01:08:08,391
What makes you think
you have the answers?

1295
01:08:10,894 --> 01:08:13,362
I mean,
who are you, anyway?

1296
01:08:13,364 --> 01:08:16,265
who gets a power trip
lecturing teenagers.

1297
01:08:18,435 --> 01:08:22,305
You really think you affect their
lives by reading them Emerson?

1298
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,508
You're a joke.

1299
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:26,976
They don't respect you.

1300
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:30,646
The second they finish high school,
they forget you.

1301
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,620
Yes, um...

1302
01:08:40,456 --> 01:08:42,357
Well...

1303
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:44,259
Uh...

1304
01:08:44,261 --> 01:08:48,597
I was thinking about your ending,
and I realized that there

1305
01:08:48,599 --> 01:08:53,168
may be something that I missed
in previous readings of your play.

1306
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,969
And that is...

1307
01:08:54,971 --> 01:08:57,271
That the ending sucks.

1308
01:08:57,273 --> 01:08:59,139
What?

1309
01:08:59,141 --> 01:09:03,277
Everyone kills themselves?
That's your resolution?

1310
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,246
Jason, come on.
What do you think?

1311
01:09:08,049 --> 01:09:09,550
You said,
you loved the ending.

1312
01:09:09,552 --> 01:09:14,021
Well, you know, I do make mistakes,
as you know.

1313
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:17,191
Whatever.
I'm done with this.

1314
01:09:17,193 --> 01:09:19,559
You know, sometimes
you can't run away.

1315
01:09:19,561 --> 01:09:21,427
And you can't
go to law school.

1316
01:09:21,429 --> 01:09:24,163
And you can't
kill yourself.

1317
01:09:24,165 --> 01:09:27,600
Because sometimes you have to stay
and suck it up.

1318
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:29,569
Fuck you!
Can you just try?

1319
01:09:29,571 --> 01:09:33,573
I mean, can you imagine that
there might be another ending?

1320
01:09:33,575 --> 01:09:37,310
A different ending,
where everyone doesn't die.

1321
01:09:39,947 --> 01:09:42,280
No! Get the fuck
out of my house!

1322
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:15,069
This is horrible.
They're gonna hate it.

1323
01:11:15,071 --> 01:11:18,272
Halle... I can't, I can't,
I can't do this!

1324
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,342
No, no. I can't... I can't remember
any of my lines.

1325
01:11:21,344 --> 01:11:25,379
Just say them the way we rehearsed
them last week and you'll be terrific.

1326
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:27,415
I know. I heard you.

1327
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:29,217
All right?
Thank you.

1328
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:30,685
Yeah.
All right.

1329
01:11:30,687 --> 01:11:32,520
All right.
Five minutes.

1330
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:34,756
It's five minutes,
everyone.

1331
01:11:34,758 --> 01:11:36,490
All right, you've
worked really hard.

1332
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:38,125
And you know what to do.

1333
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,693
And you're going
to be great.

1334
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:42,629
And you should all feel
so proud of yourselves.

1335
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:46,433
Hello, my children of the night.
Mr. Kapinas!

1336
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:47,667
I'm back.

1337
01:11:47,669 --> 01:11:49,436
Mr. Kapinas, you made it.

1338
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,205
Wild horses couldn't
keep me away.

1339
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,407
Ah, dear, dear Linda.

1340
01:11:54,409 --> 01:11:57,077
I am eternally grateful
for all your help,

1341
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,146
and understanding.

1342
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,580
Aw. It was no problem.
How are you?

1343
01:12:01,582 --> 01:12:04,083
Much better, thank you.
Fully rested,

1344
01:12:04,085 --> 01:12:07,186
mildly medicated and ready
to resume my duties.

1345
01:12:07,188 --> 01:12:09,355
Well, I think,
everything's under control.

1346
01:12:09,357 --> 01:12:13,592
Oh, don't worry,
I've done this a thousand times.

1347
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:15,728
Why don't you relax?
Take a seat, enjoy the show.

1348
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:18,097
Thespians. It's time.

1349
01:12:18,099 --> 01:12:19,498
Prayer circle of love
and commitment?

1350
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,433
Prayer circle of love
and commitment.

1351
01:12:23,602 --> 01:12:26,304
My future Tony Award winners,

1352
01:12:26,306 --> 01:12:27,472
let's all take
a deep breath.

1353
01:12:29,842 --> 01:12:31,843
Let it go.

1354
01:12:31,845 --> 01:12:33,411
Focus.

1355
01:12:33,413 --> 01:12:35,246
And as Meryl Streep
once said,

1356
01:12:35,248 --> 01:12:38,183
when we were doing
Shakespeare in the Park,

1357
01:12:38,185 --> 01:12:40,084
"Speak up!"

1358
01:12:40,086 --> 01:12:41,719
Mmm...
Mmm...

1359
01:12:55,133 --> 01:12:56,767
Here we are.

1360
01:12:59,637 --> 01:13:01,905
Next year, we are definitely doing
Our Town.

1361
01:13:27,698 --> 01:13:29,799
Why are you not
at the hospital?

1362
01:13:46,816 --> 01:13:48,850
Are you going in?
I'm too nervous.

1363
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:59,526
They were pink roses. That must be
a good sign, I'm sure of it!

1364
01:13:59,528 --> 01:14:02,296
No, Jane. She's gone.

1365
01:14:02,298 --> 01:14:05,866
I don't understand, you said she was
getting better. You...

1366
01:14:05,868 --> 01:14:08,168
She took a turn.

1367
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:10,437
No. No.

1368
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:13,173
I'm sorry.
It happened so suddenly.

1369
01:14:13,175 --> 01:14:14,842
She never woke up again.

1370
01:14:14,844 --> 01:14:16,877
Then, she was gone.

1371
01:14:16,879 --> 01:14:18,345
But I never got to say goodbye.

1372
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:20,446
You told me that, I would see her
one last time.

1373
01:14:20,448 --> 01:14:21,614
Why didn't you
come get me?

1374
01:14:21,616 --> 01:14:23,583
It would not have
changed anything.

1375
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:25,718
I could have been there to tell her
that I love her.

1376
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,854
I could have held her hand so she
wouldn't have felt so alone.

1377
01:14:27,856 --> 01:14:29,856
Jane, control yourself.

1378
01:14:29,858 --> 01:14:31,958
I must prepare
for the funeral.

1379
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,593
It's time to move on.

1380
01:14:38,365 --> 01:14:39,832
I never knew my mother.

1381
01:14:39,834 --> 01:14:41,934
But she was beautiful...

1382
01:14:42,969 --> 01:14:45,671
She loved bright
and colorful things.

1383
01:14:45,673 --> 01:14:48,307
Here. I'll give you
your favorite colors.

1384
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:50,575
Green for her wings.

1385
01:14:50,577 --> 01:14:53,478
Green with flecks of gold,
just like her eyes.

1386
01:14:59,218 --> 01:15:00,752
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm Margaret.

1387
01:15:03,423 --> 01:15:06,924
Did you hear me?
I said step away!

1388
01:15:07,926 --> 01:15:09,293
Damn it, Jane!

1389
01:15:12,631 --> 01:15:13,831
That's not me.

1390
01:15:33,784 --> 01:15:36,686
Mother. I'm ready.

1391
01:15:36,688 --> 01:15:39,255
Yes, daughter.
Come away with me.

1392
01:15:39,257 --> 01:15:41,624
You'll never belong
in this world.

1393
01:15:41,626 --> 01:15:46,363
All the pain and the fear
and the loneliness.

1394
01:15:46,365 --> 01:15:48,498
We'll be together, always.

1395
01:15:50,267 --> 01:15:51,700
Jane!
Get away.

1396
01:15:51,702 --> 01:15:53,602
Please listen to me.
Get out!

1397
01:15:53,604 --> 01:15:55,671
You ruined everything.
My entire life.

1398
01:15:55,673 --> 01:15:58,407
I know, I've made mistakes.
I'm sorry.

1399
01:15:58,409 --> 01:16:01,944
I wish I could go back and change
what happened, but I can't.

1400
01:16:01,946 --> 01:16:04,813
Please, Jane,
I'm asking for another chance.

1401
01:16:04,815 --> 01:16:07,883
It's not too late...
I know you want to run away,

1402
01:16:07,885 --> 01:16:09,952
I know you want to punish me,

1403
01:16:09,954 --> 01:16:11,920
maybe I deserve it...

1404
01:16:13,456 --> 01:16:15,957
Hmm. It's better
than I thought...

1405
01:16:15,959 --> 01:16:18,426
You do deserve it!
You're the monster. Not me!

1406
01:16:18,428 --> 01:16:20,962
I know... I know, I am.
I'm so sorry...

1407
01:16:20,964 --> 01:16:22,663
What the fuck is this?

1408
01:16:22,665 --> 01:16:24,165
Jason.

1409
01:16:31,373 --> 01:16:33,041
At least in New York they didn't
give a shit about my play,

1410
01:16:33,043 --> 01:16:34,475
they didn't try
to destroy it.

1411
01:16:34,477 --> 01:16:35,977
It's not destroyed.
It's still your play.

1412
01:16:35,979 --> 01:16:37,778
You've ruined the
whole point of the story.

1413
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:41,081
Jason, I was wrong. I didn't know
what to do, or how to fix it.

1414
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:43,316
And I'm sorry.

1415
01:16:43,318 --> 01:16:46,319
I am truly, truly sorry.

1416
01:16:46,321 --> 01:16:50,223
Please don't let my mistakes stand
in the way of your success.

1417
01:17:41,841 --> 01:17:43,608
Thank you.

1418
01:17:47,045 --> 01:17:48,712
Oh, you were wonderful.

1419
01:17:53,384 --> 01:17:54,785
Whoo!

1420
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:20,810
Author! Author!

1421
01:18:24,448 --> 01:18:25,815
He means you.

1422
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:31,320
Go on.

1423
01:18:35,191 --> 01:18:36,658
There he is.

1424
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:35,949
Ms. Sinclair.

1425
01:19:37,218 --> 01:19:39,085
Nice work.

1426
01:19:39,087 --> 01:19:40,253
Thank you.

1427
01:19:41,155 --> 01:19:43,188
May I apologize
for my behavior?

1428
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:45,791
Oh, no. Forget about it, it wasn't my
finest moment either.

1429
01:19:45,793 --> 01:19:49,494
I shouldn't have believed that stuff
from the play. I was ridiculous.

1430
01:19:49,496 --> 01:19:50,729
I'm very sorry.

1431
01:19:52,232 --> 01:19:54,166
Apology accepted.

1432
01:19:54,168 --> 01:19:55,634
Thank you.

1433
01:19:55,636 --> 01:19:57,636
It's actually true.

1434
01:19:58,771 --> 01:20:00,939
Sort of.

1435
01:20:00,941 --> 01:20:03,175
About the play.

1436
01:20:03,177 --> 01:20:04,977
I wasn't a great dad.

1437
01:20:06,646 --> 01:20:10,681
Pushed him to do all the things
I wanted him to do.

1438
01:20:10,683 --> 01:20:12,316
I'm sure,
you did your best.

1439
01:20:13,252 --> 01:20:16,053
I dated some crazy women.
None of them Irish.

1440
01:20:16,055 --> 01:20:18,022
But, uh...

1441
01:20:18,024 --> 01:20:20,191
Creative license, I guess.
Mmm-hmm.

1442
01:20:20,193 --> 01:20:22,860
Anyway, we learn from
our mistakes, right?

1443
01:20:22,862 --> 01:20:24,662
Yes, we do.

1444
01:20:26,198 --> 01:20:28,366
Good luck with everything.
Thank you.

1445
01:20:34,772 --> 01:20:39,709
And so, Linda Sinclair resumed
her life as a schoolteacher.

1446
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:42,846
Though she brought a new,
modern approach to her craft.

1447
01:20:42,848 --> 01:20:45,248
Now that you've
all finished the reading,

1448
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:48,685
let's try a little
creative writing exercise.

1449
01:20:48,687 --> 01:20:52,721
I'd like you all to write a new
ending to A Tale of Two Cities.

1450
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:55,090
Now, it could be
anything you like.

1451
01:20:55,092 --> 01:20:58,227
So let your
imaginations run wild.

1452
01:20:58,229 --> 01:21:00,229
She often saw Dr. Sherwood,

1453
01:21:00,231 --> 01:21:04,566
though propriety dictated that
she maintain a respectable distance

1454
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:08,971
from the father of the young man
with whom she'd so disgraced herself.

1455
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:15,943
That's a good biography.

1456
01:21:15,945 --> 01:21:17,845
I have a copy if you
want to borrow it.

1457
01:21:18,914 --> 01:21:21,916
You're a fan?
Of Conan Doyle?

1458
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,785
Of course.
Me too.

1459
01:21:23,787 --> 01:21:25,620
Since I was a kid.

1460
01:21:25,622 --> 01:21:28,690
And that was the end of it.

1461
01:21:28,692 --> 01:21:30,692
How are you?

1462
01:21:30,694 --> 01:21:32,327
I'm pretty good, thanks.

1463
01:21:34,763 --> 01:21:37,231
Hey, would you like to grab
a cup of coffee or something?

1464
01:21:37,233 --> 01:21:38,599
Naturally...

1465
01:21:38,601 --> 01:21:39,633
Um...

1466
01:21:39,635 --> 01:21:41,134
She refused.

1467
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:43,970
Okay. Why not.

1468
01:21:43,972 --> 01:21:47,808
And so they spoke in
a strictly impersonal way.

1469
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:49,343
She did some crazy stuff.

1470
01:21:49,345 --> 01:21:52,746
She had a yard sale one time when
I was out of town,

1471
01:21:52,748 --> 01:21:55,248
and sold my entire collection of
Ellery Queen first editions.

1472
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:57,150
Oh, no!
Yes!

1473
01:21:58,286 --> 01:22:01,954
That's when I knew the marriage
was kinda over.

1474
01:22:01,956 --> 01:22:04,256
They did not
discuss the boy.

1475
01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:06,025
Jason's doing really well.
Is he?

1476
01:22:06,027 --> 01:22:08,394
Yeah, yeah, he's actually written
another piece.

1477
01:22:08,396 --> 01:22:12,231
And he's work shopping it in a
children's theater in New Jersey.

1478
01:22:12,233 --> 01:22:15,134
I mean, you may or may not realize
some references to Orwell,

1479
01:22:15,136 --> 01:22:16,635
and Kafka in the first act...

1480
01:22:16,637 --> 01:22:18,304
Oh, that's so wonderful.

1481
01:22:18,306 --> 01:22:20,072
Can I be honest
with you about something?

1482
01:22:20,074 --> 01:22:21,841
I knew it.

1483
01:22:21,843 --> 01:22:28,947
The whole time we're strolling along here,
I keep thinking...

1484
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:32,684
You know,
you slept with my son.

1485
01:22:32,686 --> 01:22:38,189
I understand that it was just one
of those things or whatever, but...

1486
01:22:39,892 --> 01:22:42,327
I guess, what I am
trying to say is...

1487
01:22:44,964 --> 01:22:46,798
I still think
you're pretty great.

1488
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,665
What?

1489
01:22:48,667 --> 01:22:50,200
Yeah.

1490
01:22:50,202 --> 01:22:53,937
And if it's not too weird...

1491
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:56,073
For you, or me...

1492
01:22:56,075 --> 01:23:00,878
Walter Mosley's speaking over at
Wilkes next week, and I thought maybe...

1493
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,248
Linda Sinclair.
What are you doing?

1494
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:07,718
You belong here.
At home. Alone.

1495
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,353
You don't want
to go out there.

1496
01:23:09,355 --> 01:23:12,355
It's a cruel and
unforgiving world.

1497
01:23:12,357 --> 01:23:13,456
Linda.

1498
01:23:13,458 --> 01:23:15,224
Hi, Linda.
Hi.

1499
01:23:15,226 --> 01:23:16,325
Linda.

1500
01:23:16,327 --> 01:23:17,860
You look great.

1501
01:23:17,862 --> 01:23:19,295
Thank you.

1502
01:23:19,297 --> 01:23:21,364
Are you ready?

1503
01:23:21,366 --> 01:23:22,999
Yes, I am.

1504
01:23:23,001 --> 01:23:25,134
Linda?
Are you listening to me?

1505
01:23:28,134 --> 01:23:32,134
