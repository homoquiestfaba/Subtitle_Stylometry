4
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,668
- Are you all right?

5
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:02,932
Are you sleepin' out here?

6
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:04,760
- What?

7
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,459
- What're you doin' out here?

8
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:13,116
Are you sleeping?
- I, I might've dozed off.

9
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:14,857
- Is that drool?

10
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,863
You've got a pillow
and a blanket.

11
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:22,256
- What's the problem?

12
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,735
- "Problem?"
- Yeah, the problem.

13
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:26,129
Why are you knocking
on my window?

14
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:30,307
- Well, if somebody's just
sittin' out here in a car,

15
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:33,136
under a blanket, I gotta check.

16
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:35,616
- Check what?

17
00:01:36,357 --> 00:01:36,966
- This is the library.

18
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:40,535
- So? What are you checking for?

19
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:41,579
Terrorists?

20
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:42,406
- What?

21
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,799
No!

22
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:46,366
I said this is the library.

23
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,978
I'm checkin' for perverts.

25
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,727

Jane, hi! What a nice surprise.

27
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,863
Oh, it's a surprise for me.

28
00:02:05,908 --> 00:02:08,389
Oh, it's not nice?

Hello?

Jane?

I'm really gonna miss you guys.

I'm so grateful.

43
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,263
I'm gonna miss you too.

44
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,442
Hi, Mary.

45
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:03,008
- Isn't that same blouse
you wore yesterday?

00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:05,837
[phone rings]

47
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,448
- Hey, Jane. It's Beta.

48
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:10,015
Just calling you back.
My phone died earlier.

49
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,365
I hope everything's okay.

50
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,846
I'm not going to be
going home tonight, FYI.

51
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,587
So just give me a call back.

52
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,936
Okay, bye.

53
00:03:19,111 --> 00:03:20,635
- Not paying you to
make phone calls.

54
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:22,245
- I'm sorry, I just got a
call from my father's ex-wife,

55
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,465
which is really unusual.
- I'm just messing with you.

56
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:25,335
[Beta chuckles]

57
00:03:26,466 --> 00:03:27,946
Surprised you even
came in today.

58
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,774
- Oh! Well, I wanted to
say goodbye to everybody.

59
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:31,994
- At least you didn't
shower, change clothes.

60
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,780
[chuckles] Just
messing with you.

61
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,129
Good luck at school.

62
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:39,480
You sure didn't give us
much time to prepare.

63
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:41,699
- I know, it was
all really sudden.

64
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,571
Some scholarship money
opened up, I guess,

65
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:46,095
so I haven't even had a
chance to tell my family yet.

66
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,358
- [Boss] Well, I don't
know what that's about,

67
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,055
but we're gonna miss
you around here.

68
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,579
- Really?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:53,058
Did you see that cake and
balloons in the conference room?

70
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,756
- Are you serious?

71
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,018
- I'm just messing.

72
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,759
[Beta chuckles]
Take it easy.

73
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,675
[footsteps recede]

74
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,242
- Hi, ZeeZee, it's me.

75
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,288
I'm calling to make sure that
we're still on for tonight.

76
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:09,205
I have some exciting
news to share

77
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,816
and I am looking
forward to seeing you.

78
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,774
Okay, bye bye.

79
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,123
Hi.

80
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:15,820
- I need you to cat
sit this weekend.

81
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:18,475
- Uh, I can't.

82
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:21,086
Remember I'm moving
to Connecticut?

83
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,914
- Maybe I'll ask Rebecca.

84
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:24,960
- Okay!

85
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,616

87
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:39,540
- Excuse me.

[knocks]

89
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,416
- Knock knock.
- Oh, hey, Brad.

90
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,462
- You're leaving us. [chuckles]

91
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,073
I'm just kidding. That's great.

92
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:52,553
That's great.

93
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:56,078
Congratulations on the
school. I'm sure it's great.

94
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,254
I mean it will be great.
- Yeah, thank you, Brad.

95
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,996
That's... That's
really sweet of you.

96
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,998
- Will you have a
drink with me tonight?

97
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,522
- Oh, um...

98
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:09,483
I'm actually getting dinner
with my sister and our father.

99
00:05:10,614 --> 00:05:11,354
I haven't even told
them the good news, so-

100
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,312
- What about tomorrow?

101
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,578
- Um, tomorrow?

102
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:18,970
I'm...

103
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:21,059
- I've met Grant. I know
you have a boyfriend.

104
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,582
I'm not trying to have
intercourse with you.

105
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:26,761
- Oh, my god, no. It's
not that. [chuckles]

106
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:30,373
[phone rings and vibrates]

107
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,682
[phone rings and vibrates]
- I'll let you take that.

108
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:39,730
Good luck with life.
[phone rings and vibrates]

109
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:41,428
[phone rings and vibrates]

110
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,299
- Jane! Finally!

111
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,345
It is so funny that
you called me today.

112
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:47,521
Yes, yes, exactly.

113
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:50,654
And, um, I know that this
is last-minute, um...

114
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,004
Okay. Oh, yeah, sure.

115
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:54,702
Sorry. Go right ahead.

116
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:03,450
What?
[somber orchestral music]

117
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:22,425
- God, it's hot.

118
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:24,906
- You said that already.

119
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:26,908
- Oh?

120
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,175
- What the fuck is this?

121
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:34,045
- Hi.

122
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:37,832
- [Pippa] Can we help you?

123
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,878
- [Beta] Yeah! I'm just
looking for my sister?

124
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:41,836
She lives here?

125
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,272
- Oh?
- I think.

126
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,579
- What's her name, sweetie?
- Zelda Foreman?

127
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:47,319
- [Olive] Ah. Is that a fact?

128
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:48,233
- [Pippa] I didn't
know she had a sister.

129
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:50,540
- You don't come by, do you?

130
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:52,412
She hasn't been out
of her room all day,

131
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:55,457
and it's hotter than an
Arab's armpit up there.

132
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:56,720
[Pippa laughs]

133
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,680
- [Pippa] She also owes
us rent. Two months now.

134
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:02,291
- Why don't you get her
to join us down here

135
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,814
for some fresh air?

136
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,729
- If she wants to
sit on this stoop,

137
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,296
she's gotta pay her rent.

138
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:09,341
- [Beta] Nice meeting you both.

139
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,474
- Hers is the room at
the end of the hall!

140
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:14,129
- The one that smells.

141
00:07:15,217 --> 00:07:19,308
[door closes]
[brooding piano music]

142
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,800
[knocks]

143
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,112
- [Beta] Zelda?

144
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:43,637
[door creaks]

145
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,796
[sighs]

146
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:33,337
[clears throat]

00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,991
[keyboard clacks]

00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,168
[sexual moaning from computer]
[window opens]

149
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,039
- What're you doing
on my computer?

150
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,825
That stuff is very private.

151
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,304
- [Beta] What are you doing?

152
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,655
- I don't like to
use the front door.

153
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,048
It's a very long story.

154
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,225
See? There, not so bad.

155
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,401
- [Beta] Why are you climbing
in through the window?

156
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:53,358
- You could try
it when you leave.

157
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:54,795
It's actually kind of fun.

158
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,799
- [Beta] Are you sneaking in
and out of your own house?

159
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:01,976
- I guess so.

160
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:06,415
I just don't like to talk
to the people out front.

161
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,465
It's funny, isn't it? That I'm
still sneaking out at my age.

162
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,425
I mean, it's not
funny, but it's sad.

163
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:19,733
It's just easier this way,

164
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:24,085
because I think they're
trying to kick me out.

165
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,392
- [Beta] They said you
owe two months rent.

166
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:28,698
- Yeah, well, I'm good for it.

167
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:31,005
I just haven't really had a job.

168
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:34,486
- I tried calling you today.
- Yeah, I know.

169
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:36,227
I mean...

170
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:39,883
Oh, you did? [chuckles]

171
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,885
I left my phone at
Henry's. I'm sorry.

172
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:45,802
- Jane called me this morning.

173
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:48,065
- [chuckles] That's why
I leave my phone places.

174
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:49,632
Not that she would ever call me.

175
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:54,898
What did old Jane want?

176
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:55,638
- Dad's dead.

177
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:57,814
- [Zelda] What?

178
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:01,426
Do you mean-
- They found him in his car.

179
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:05,866
- But the doctor said
that he was doing great.

180
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,258
See, that's why I hate doctors.

181
00:10:07,302 --> 00:10:08,738
- In the garage.

182
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,435
- Huh?

183
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,481
- The car had been
running in the garage.

184
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,488
[Zelda sighs]

185
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,972
He was probably in there
for a couple of days.

186
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:37,549
- Do you have any cigarettes?
- I don't smoke.

187
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,055
We're going to go Jane's tonight

188
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,404
and meet everyone for dinner.

189
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:07,623
- What?
- ZeeZee.

190
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,407
- Fuck that!
- ZeeZee.

191
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,061
- Who is "everyone?"

192
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:12,497
- Jane, our brothers.

193
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,673
- Half-brothers.

194
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,588
- Why don't you wanna go?
- Why do you want to?

195
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:19,026
- Because he's our
dad too, ZeeZee,

196
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:21,550
and we have just as much a right
to be there as anyone else!

197
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,161
- I wouldn't even wanna be
there, even if Dad was alive.

198
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:26,033
Like let alone right
after finding out

199
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:29,863
that he killed himself.
[Beta sighs]

200
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:31,691
- It'll be nice to
be around people.

201
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,214
- I'm a person!

202
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,130
And I'm a person that
doesn't wanna process these

203
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:40,656
initial stages of grief around
people who look down on me.

204
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:42,223
- They don't look down on you.

205
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:45,095
Jane called and
invited us to dinner.

206
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:48,185
She's making an effort and I
would really like to be there

207
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:50,710
and I would really like it
if you were there with me.

208
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,239
- Well, this is going
to be a disaster.

209
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:00,632
- Thank you.

210
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:09,032
[distant dog barks]

211
00:12:09,076 --> 00:12:10,860
- We have to leave
through the window.

212
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:17,824
[baroque harpsichord music]
[laughter]

213
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,308
- How're you doing, Ma?

214
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:27,659
Are you putting on a brave
face or are you okay?

215
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:31,141
- I'm happy to have the
whole family in one place.

216
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,448
- [Guy] You just let us
know if you need anything.

217
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:34,623
- Ouch, stop.

218
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,496
- [Keith] Are Beta
and Zelda comin'?

219
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:40,890
- Oh-oh.

220
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:41,761
I forgot.

221
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,895
Who knows?
[Keith scoffs]

222
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,028
- If they're taking Beta's car,

223
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:48,593
they probably won't
be here till morning.

224
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:53,076
[door closes]
[brothers laugh]

225
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,730
- The last time
I ran into Zelda,

226
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,776
she didn't even have shoes on.

227
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:00,040
[brothers laugh]

228
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:00,780
Oh, boy.

229
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:12,400
- How's the fruit?

230
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:13,270
- Thank you.

231
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:15,795
- It's mostly melon.

232
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,449
- Well, uh, Ellie put
dinner away already.

233
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:21,148
- That's fine. I don't
really eat anymore.

234
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:27,676
- [clears throat] I'm
sorry for your loss.

235
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:29,896
It's never easy
to lose a father.

236
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:32,463
Even if you were close to him.

237
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:34,117
You may or may not know

238
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:37,120
that there will be
no funeral, per se,

239
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:40,994
because it was
Bobby's lifelong dream

240
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:42,299
to be cremated.

241
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:48,784
- Please, go on.

242
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,048
- We will be going to
your father's house,

243
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:54,311
tomorrow at three,

244
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:57,053
to sort through and
claim his belongings,

245
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:59,577
in accordance with the will.

246
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:02,929
And of course you are
welcome to drop by.

247
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,496
- We weren't
included in the will?

248
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,063
- [Jane] Oh, of course you are!

249
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,152
- So why wouldn't we be welcome?

250
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:09,892
- You are.

251
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,765
- Thanks.

252
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:16,464
- Does anybody want this
fruit before I throw it away?

253
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,118
- Yeah, [clears throat] yeah.

254
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,294
I'll have some, Mom.

255
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,427
I love melons. [chuckles]

256
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:25,342
- Maybe your daughter
would like one.

257
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,912
- Are we talking about tomorrow?

258
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:33,176
- Your mother was just telling
us that we are very welcome.

259
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,264
- [Guy] Course you are.

260
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,526
- No one should be surprised

261
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,833
that there isn't
any money coming.

262
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:41,445
But all the blood relatives
are more than welcome

263
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:44,361
to divide any
belongings they want,

264
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,233
you know, for
sentimental reasons.

265
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:49,018
- And that's the five of us?

266
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:49,889
- And Uncle Jerry.

267
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,021
- Who?

268
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:52,761
- Uncle Jerry?

269
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,503
- Wait a minute.
Who's Uncle Jerry?

270
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,201
- Dad's brother?

271
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:01,030
- Yeah, I guess I
understand how uncles work.

272
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,990
I'm just wondering why this is
the first I'm hearing of him.

273
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:06,470
- [Zelda] Yeah, we've never
had any male role models.

274
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,995
- He's been dead
for a long time.

275
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:10,561
- Well...

276
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:11,867
We don't know he's dead.

277
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:15,523
- We believe he is dead.

278
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:18,395
- I'm having trouble
wrapping my head around this.

279
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:19,788
Dad had a brother?

280
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:21,833
- Who is dead?

281
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:22,660
- Probably.

282
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,925
- [Beta] Why have we
never heard about this?

283
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:29,015
- Your Uncle Jerry
was a religious nut.

284
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,625
Your father hardly spoke to him

285
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:33,671
and nobody has heard from
him in almost 30 years.

286
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:36,979
- [Beta] Why isn't
anyone looking for him?

287
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,415
- He's been gone, a long time!

288
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,070
- [Zelda] But Dad
included him in the will.

289
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:42,942
- Take it easy!

290
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:47,555
Yes, he is included in the will
but given the circumstances-

291
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:48,991
- So we should be
trying to find him.

292
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,211
- Will you take it easy?

293
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:53,561
Given your father's
state of mind,

294
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:56,259
who knows what was
going through his head.

295
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:57,739
- That he wanted to
include his brother

296
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,654
in the divvying up
of his belongings,

297
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:02,222
that doesn't seem very
difficult to suss out.

298
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,485
- Then go find him.

299
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:08,097
We're still going through
your father's house tomorrow.

300
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:10,621
- I will find Jerry,
and I can't wait.

301
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,319
- You are being selfish.

302
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,016
- No, you are being selfish.

303
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,975
- I'm being selfish?

304
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,194
I'm not the one
that killed myself!

305
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,806
- Well, there's still
a little bit of time.

306
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:24,461
- You have a point.

307
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:28,900
So nice to see you, Beta.

308
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,555
I'm off to bed.

309
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,644
- Goodnight, Mom.
- Goodnight, Mom.

310
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,125
[melancholy chamber music]

311
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:38,867
[brothers sigh]

312
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,055
- [Waiter] How's the tea?

313
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:54,578
- It's fine.

314
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:55,971
- Can I get you anything else?

315
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,016
- [Beta] No, thanks.

316
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,495
- Are you sure?

317
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:00,062
Some soup? String cheese?

318
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,107
[Beta chuckles]

319
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,673
Any dessert?

320
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,196
Slice of pie?

321
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,111
On the house.

322
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,678
- Uh, no.

323
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,030
- [Waiter] You have
really beautiful eyes.

324
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:14,858
- Oh!

325
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,688
Okay.

326
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:19,560
- That's not the response
I was planning for.

327
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:23,867
- I'm not in the mood
to be hit on just now,

328
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:25,695
I guess, but thank you.

329
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,611
- Must be nice to be
so selective about when

330
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,352
and where someone
pays you a compliment.

331
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,614
- My dad died today.

332
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,965
And I'll also take the
check, when you get a chance.

333
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:42,322
What do you keep doing in there?

334
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:44,846
- Douching.
[Beta chuckles]

335
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:45,890
See? Made you laugh.

336
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:50,373
- I'm not happy
with you, ZeeZee.

337
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:51,200
- That will pass.

338
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:55,378
My tea is cold.

339
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:56,945
- Well, then you
should've brought it

340
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,120
in the bathroom with you.
- Are you seriously mad at me?

341
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:00,340
- Why do you have to
be so antagonistic?

342
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:03,125
You need to learn how
to control yourself.

343
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,432
- Um, I control
myself all the time.

344
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:08,304
You're asking me to let other
people control me, and I...

345
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:12,091
I refuse to do that,
especially with them.

346
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,180
- Our opinion of them was formed

347
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,442
when we were practically
children and we now have

348
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:18,097
the opportunity to get
to know them as adults.

349
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,099
Don't you wanna be
close to your brothers?

350
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,361
- Half-brothers.
- So what?

351
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:24,190
- Um, so Keith kept
looking down my shirt.

352
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,888
- That's ridiculous.
- Um, I'm sorry.

353
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:29,978
Uh, I think what you meant to
say was "that's disgusting."

354
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:33,155
- Well, why were you wearing

355
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,809
such a low-cut shirt
to the occasion?

356
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:37,028
- Because you showed up to my
house and demanded that I go,

357
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,465
white male oppressor,

358
00:18:38,508 --> 00:18:40,031
not because I wanted my
brother to stare at my tits.

359
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,860
Jesus Christ, are
you kidding me?

360
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,384
- Okay.
- Half-brother.

361
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:48,039
- I'm sorry.
[Zelda groans]

362
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,824
- Don't you think it's selfish

363
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:53,044
that they're not even
gonna try to find him?

364
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,655
- I agree, but-

365
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:55,960
- I mean, the fact that they
assume he's dead only makes it

366
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,267
more likely that he's not dead.

367
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:00,791
I mean, like, who assumes death?

368
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:02,924
Like, that doesn't
even make sense.

369
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,230
They don't wanna find him

370
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,753
because they don't want
anything to do with him,

371
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:08,234
just like they've never
wanted anything to do with us.

372
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:10,758
They hope he's dead,
is more like it.

373
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,151
- It's weird, I agree,

374
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,544
but Dad wasn't in
contact with him either.

375
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,242
- Dad included him in his will.

376
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:23,336
He could be the family
that we never had.

377
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:27,383
I mean, what if we find
him? Do you have your phone?

378
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:28,950
- It's about to die.

379
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:30,386
[Zelda groans]

380
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:32,693
- Can we go to your place
and use your computer?

381
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,173
- Why don't we go to your place?

382
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,304
- I'm not allowed to have
people over at night.

383
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:36,827
Oh, let's go to Henry's.

384
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:38,612
He's got a computer and
that way I can get my phone.

385
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:40,570
- Who's Henry?

386
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:41,528
- The guy that I'm
sleeping with. I told you.

387
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:43,051
- You want me to go to Henry's?

388
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,663
- I mean, not if it's...
You don't want to.

389
00:19:47,534 --> 00:19:49,623
- Um, no, of course I want to.

390
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:51,755
I'm just surprised
to be asked, I guess.

391
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,322
- Well, don't make
it weird, okay?

392
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,106
Why can't like one nice happen

393
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,977
without you farting in its face?

394
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,588
- This will be fun! Or, is fun.

395
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,897
- When was the last
time that we hung out?

396
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,247
- High school?

397
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,815
- We hung out in high school?

398
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,472
[car door closes]

399
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:14,430
That waiter didn't
even look at me.

400
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:15,301
He was cute.

401
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,825
I wanna stomp on his dick.

402
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:21,045
- I'm not as sad
as I want to be.

403
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,395
- What? About Dad?

404
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,005
- Yeah.

405
00:20:24,048 --> 00:20:26,529
- That's a great quote.

406
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:28,879
"I'm not as sad
as I want to be."

407
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:31,230
- Do you know what
I mean, though?

408
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:35,408
Like, I just feel kinda guilty.
Like I'm not sad enough.

409
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,627
- Yeah, it's uh...

410
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:40,587
Hard to get sad these days.

411
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,460
[clears throat]

412
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:46,897
[car starts]

413
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,253
- This, okay, this is it?
- Yeah.

414
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:02,609
[car doors slam]

415
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,306
- What is this place?

416
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,438
- [Zelda] Henry's loft.

417
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:11,095
[door creaks]

418
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:12,401
[giggles]

419
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:13,924
- [Beta] What does Henry do?

420
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:15,578
- [Zelda] He builds sets
or something for plays.

421
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:18,277
You know, like the rooms
and bridges and stuff?

422
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,800
- [Beta] "Bridges?"

423
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:23,325
- I don't know. He's like
a carpenter but for plays.

424
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:27,503
Henry's old, by the way.

425
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:28,896
- What?

426
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,637
- Henry's an old man, just FYI.

427
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,117
Be cool.
[keys clink]

428
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,510
[door creaks]

429
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,773
- Hello. [chuckles]

430
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,601
What were you saying about me?

431
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,124
- Oh, I was just
telling Beta here

432
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:42,344
that you are not the young
man she perhaps envisioned,

433
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:44,825
but are, in fact,
an aged pre-vert.

434
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:48,045
- I've always been
that way. I'm Henry.

435
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,221
- Hi, I'm Beta.
- Nice to meet you.

436
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:51,875
You're a friend of Zorba's?

437
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,660
- Uh, actually, I'm her sister.

438
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:56,880
- Oh!

439
00:21:56,924 --> 00:21:59,492
Well, in that case, it is
actually very nice to meet you.

440
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,624
I would say "finally meet you"

441
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:02,799
but I didn't even know
that Zelda had a sister.

442
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,235
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

443
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:05,802
- I don't like to brag.

444
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,282
Did you find my phone?

445
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,979
[Beta chuckles]
- I didn't know it was here.

446
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,591
You want some apples and cheese?

447
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,680
- What're you making?
- Apples and cheese.

448
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:17,814
Sit, sit. Yeah.
[Beta chuckles]

449
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:18,685
- Thanks.

450
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:24,343
[glasses clink]

451
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:28,912
- If I'd known we were
expecting company,

452
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,001
I would've bought another apple.

453
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:32,394
- Oh, uh, just the
cheese is fine.

454
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:33,656
- I'm just joking.
- He was kidding.

455
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,310
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

456
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,618
So what've you two
little angels been up to?

457
00:22:38,661 --> 00:22:39,880
- Henry, our father died.

458
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,144
- Oh, my...

459
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:44,014
Whoa.

460
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:46,669
I thought he was doing okay?

461
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:49,542
- Yeah, he did it
himself. We think.

462
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:51,326
- Oh, my god. I'm sorry.
[Zelda chuckles]

463
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,327
- No, please don't come near me,

464
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,808
'cause I'm just gonna lose it.

465
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:00,727
- Is there anything I can do?

466
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:03,382
- No.

467
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,600
- [Beta] Thank you, Henry.

468
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:11,390
- The world is old,
but we are young.

469
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,568
- Henry, can we
use your computer?

470
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:17,570
[cork pops]

471
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:19,746
[Henry chuckles]

472
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:21,182
- I mean, by that time I'd
already been at sea for almost

473
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:24,968
three years remember, so
whatever skills I had had

474
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:27,101
at conversing civilly
with people on land

475
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:28,755
had gone completely
out the window.

476
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:31,584
And when I'd get my shore leave,
I was literally a monster,

477
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,673
crawling up out of the ocean.
[Beta and Zelda chuckle]

478
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:35,675
- How long were you
on the submarine?

479
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,241
Is it "in" or "on?"

480
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:39,243
- Uh, six years.
- Wow.

481
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,550
- And what the hell were
you doing in the Navy?

482
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:42,812
I'm assuming it
wasn't patriotism.

483
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,292
- Well, there's nothing
wrong with patriotism,

484
00:23:44,335 --> 00:23:46,076
depending on the country.

485
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,382
But, uh...
[Zelda and Beta laugh]

486
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,037
I don't know what I was
doing on that submarine.

487
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,647
I was pretty lost back then.

488
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:53,954
I mean, I think the
only thing I really had

489
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:55,738
in common with anybody
on that sewer pipe

490
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,871
was the fact that we had
all taken a long look

491
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:00,961
at our life on land and
decided to chuck it.

492
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,051
So, still nothin', huh?

493
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:08,577
- Um, well, unless he is a
real estate agent in Arizona,

494
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,756
or the murderer-rapist
Jerry the Whoreman Foreman,

495
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,279
who died in 1902,

496
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:18,413
then the internet has nothing
to say about our uncle.

497
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,893
- Maybe he is dead.

498
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:22,243
- But wouldn't there be an
online record of his death?

499
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:23,157
- [Beta] You'd think so.

500
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,419
- If Dad put him in the will,

501
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,333
then that means
that he was alive.

502
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:26,508
Dad must have known that.

503
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,031
Maybe we can find
something at the house.

504
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:29,729
- At Dad's house?
- Yeah.

505
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:32,471
Like a letter or something.

506
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,690
- Are you suggesting
we go to Dad's house?

507
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:36,823
- Yes, why? Do you not wanna go?

508
00:24:36,866 --> 00:24:40,261
- Of course I do, but
I want it to be nice.

509
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:41,654
- Well, I'm sure it won't be.

510
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:45,179
- I mean I want you
to apologize to Jane.

511
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:46,659
- For what?
- For...

512
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:49,836
For me.

513
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,622
Just say you're sorry.
You're emotional.

514
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:55,624
- I would rather
sit on Keith's face.

515
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:56,190
- Maybe there's a middle ground?

516
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:57,017
- Mm.

517
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,150
- If you don't
apologize, I'm not going.

518
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:02,239
- No!
- I'm not going!

519
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:04,154
[Zelda groans]

520
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:06,722
- [Zelda] Okay, okay, I
will apologize to Jane.

521
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,246
- You promise?

522
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:14,164
- I promise.
[brooding piano music]

523
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,165
- Thank you.

540
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:20,220

[garage door hums]

542
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:27,793
Hi.

543
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:28,663
- Hi.

544
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:35,191
- What? Are you
sleeping in here?

545
00:28:35,235 --> 00:28:36,889
- Oh, no! [chuckles] No.

546
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,239
Just in case.
- That's good thinking.

547

[seatbelt clacks]

00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:45,506
[sighs]

549
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:47,769
It's from a dog, Beta.

550
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,163
It is seriously from a
dog. Let us go, okay?

551
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,558
- Oh! Um, what'd Jane say?

552
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:55,429
Everything okay?

553
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:58,998
Did you call?

554
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:01,130
- I don't have a phone, so...

555
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:02,697
- You didn't call?

556
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,177
- I don't have a phone. I don't
know what you want me to do!

557
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,789
- Oh, my god. You have
got to be kidding me!

558
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,704
- I don't know where
it is! I told you that.

559
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,880
- Yeah, you also told me
that you would call Jane!

560
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,361
In fact, you promised me.

561
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:15,754
- How do you want me to call
Jane if I don't have a phone?

562
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,320
- [Beta] They don't have
a phone at doggy day care?

563
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:18,582
- Of course they do but I don't
know Jane's number by heart.

564
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:19,670
- Well then you
should've called me.

565
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:21,063
- I don't know your number.

566
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:23,587
- Well, [sighs] you must've
known you didn't know

567
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:25,633
anybody's number and that
you didn't have a phone when

568
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:27,940
you promised you'd call Jane
and you knew how important-

569
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:29,898
- I didn't think that far ahead!

570
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:32,248
It wasn't like it was
a conscious decision
to disobey you.

571
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:34,773
- I'm not asking you to obey me.

572
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:36,775
- Well, you don't occupy that
much space in my head, okay?

573
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,778
For me to like think ahead
of ways to disappoint you.

574
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,649
- You don't think
about me, period!

575
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:44,086
That's precisely the issue I'm
trying to highlight for you.

576
00:29:45,479 --> 00:29:47,524
You don't think about
anybody, except yourself.

577
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,788
- Well, thanks for the
ride. This is my stop.

578
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,877
- Just once I would like
to communicate with you.

579
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,835
- Maybe instead we
should just be quiet.

580
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:57,621
- Maybe you should take
my phone out of my purse,

581
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:58,492
and call Jane.

582
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,147
Right now.

583
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:07,980
[car doors slam]

584
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,680
- Hm, you know,
it would be great

585
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:14,595
if you could have like
a plastic bag for this.

586
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:17,816
Or like a cap for the brush,
because it's kind of disgusting

587
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,774
to let it roll around
loose in your bag.

588
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:22,211
- In two seconds I'm going to
use it to gouge out your eyes.

589
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:23,038
- Mm!

590
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:26,868
Whoa, you have seven
missed calls from Grant.

591
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:28,827
[Beta sighs]

592
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,178
That's a mystical
number. [chuckles]

[Beta laughs]

600
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:47,149
Hi.

601
00:30:47,193 --> 00:30:48,759
No, it's Zelda.

602
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:49,978
Yep.

603
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:51,588
One of your husband's children.

604
00:30:52,372 --> 00:30:53,634
Ex-husband, yeah.

605
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:56,680
Beta and I are on
our way to Dad's,

606
00:30:56,724 --> 00:31:00,510
and I just had to call and
apologize, because my behavior

607
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:04,514
yesterday was very
bad and inappropriate.

608
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:06,299
And so, I'm sorry.

609
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:08,910
My dad is dead and I'm sad.

610
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:12,392
Oh, really?

611
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,092
I'm sorry to hear that.

612
00:31:17,136 --> 00:31:18,398
Well, you just take it slow.

613
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:20,617
You know, it would be a
shame if you fell again.

614
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:22,881
- [Beta] What?

615
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:25,884
- We'll see you there, okay?

616
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,886
[phone clicks]

617
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:29,104
Oh, she hung up.

618
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:30,018
- What happened?

619
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:33,413
- Jane fell out of
bed and hurt her neck.

620
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:35,632
- What? Oh, my god!
- Who...

621
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:38,287
Who falls out of the bed
past the age of five?

622
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,723
Did she go poopy, too?

623
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,464
- Is she okay?

624
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:43,902
- We're gonna have to check
her underwear and find out.

625
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:48,994
[melancholy chamber music]
[car starts]

626
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:55,914
- When did Jane say
they would be here?

627
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,133
- Hm, maybe they got
into a car accident.

628
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:08,187
- I'm sorry I got so...

629
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,843
Grant and I broke up.
- What? Why?

630
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,497
- Why not?

631
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,110
- Are you still living together?

632
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,374
- I just sort of left.

633
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:24,116
- So that's why your car looks
like an episode of Hoarders.

634
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,249
- I'm also moving.

635
00:32:27,293 --> 00:32:30,731
I wanted to tell you that,
but it got kinda overshadowed.

636
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:32,951
- Oh, my god. Could we
get a place together?

637
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:40,175
- I'm moving to Connecticut.

638
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:44,832
- Oh. Um...

639
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,095
What's, what's in Con-

640
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:49,315
- Um, I got into grad school.

641
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:51,970
[Zelda chuckles]
And I'm gonna get to go.

642
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,189
- That's fucking awesome.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

643
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:57,105
- When do you leave?

644
00:32:59,194 --> 00:32:59,978
- Monday.

645
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,200
- Monday, as in
two-days-from-now Monday?

646
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:06,071
- Yeah.

647
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:13,078
- Well, we'll always have
that weekend that Dad died.

648
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,254
I'll be right back.

649
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:17,169
- Where are you going?
- Take a dump.

650
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,874
[car approaches]

651
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:41,236
- Hi.

652
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:45,501
- [groans] Jesus fuck.
- You okay, Ma?

653
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:49,331
[hushed chatter]

654
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:53,031
[car door slams]

655
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,076
There you go.

656
00:33:56,295 --> 00:33:57,383
- Ow, ow!
- I got ya, I got ya, Ma.

657
00:33:58,558 --> 00:33:59,646
- [Keith] Can you
feel your legs?

658
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:01,082
- [Guy] I could feel yours.

659
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,997
- Hi, everybody!
- Hi, Beta.

660
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:04,694
- Hi.
- Hey, hey.

661
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:05,695
- You all right?

662
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:07,523
- Let's get this over with.

663
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:08,958
Is Zelda here or not?

664
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:11,397
- Oh, um, yeah.
She's here, she's...

665
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:16,445
- Whoops.

666
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:26,063
[purse zips]

667
00:34:27,543 --> 00:34:29,023
- Are they here yet?
- Yeah.

668
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:31,982
Did you really take a dump?
- Yes.

669
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:34,159
- [Beta] Where is it?

670
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:37,813
- I buried it, you sick fuck.

671
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,648
- What was going on back there?

672
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:47,346
- [Beta] We're just
looking around.

673
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,087
[Adam sniffs]

674
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,565
- Did you just sniff me?

675
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,871
- ZeeZee.

676
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:53,612
- [Adam] I thought
you got sober, no?

677
00:34:54,222 --> 00:34:55,702
- [Zelda] What?

678
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:57,573
- Are you smoking grass out
back your old man's house?

679
00:34:57,617 --> 00:35:02,274
- No, I'm not "smoking grass
out back my old man's house."

680
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:03,579
Are you for real?

681
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:06,104
- All right, I'm sorry.

682
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:07,975
All right, no big
deal. Just checkin'.

683
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,195
I'm sorry. After you.

684
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,590
Let's just try and
behave ourselves.

685
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:15,548
- Yes, let us.

686
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:25,297
[door closes]

687
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,872
[Adam sighs]

688
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:38,440
- Well, I'm gonna hit
up the wine cellar.

689
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:41,400
[brothers laugh]

690
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:43,489
- [Jane] How are we
going to do this?

691
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:46,492
- Um, every man or...

692
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:49,103
Woman, for his or herself.

693
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,671
And if we wanna trade later,
then we can discuss it.

694
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:55,414
- [Adam] Shotgun
the VHS collection.

695
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:56,980
[Keith and Guy laugh]

696
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:58,330
I'm not joking.

697
00:35:58,373 --> 00:35:59,200
- All right.

698
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:01,202
Break!

699
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:02,943
- Help me to the couch.

700
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:05,293
- [Guy] Ma, I'm losing
valuable time here.

701
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:07,513
- Okay, if there's anything
here, it's probably downstairs,

702
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:09,428
but in the interest of
time, shall we split up?

703
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:11,081
- Okay, yeah. I'll
go check his bedroom.

704
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:13,780
- [claps] Okay.

705
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:20,743
[melancholy chamber music]

706
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,706
[doors close]

707
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:15,102
[chuckles]

708
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:24,459
[sighs]

709
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:30,683
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

710
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,868
[chuckles]

711
00:37:58,058 --> 00:37:59,625
Mama mia.

712
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:03,281
[melancholy chamber music]

713
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:02,470
- [Keith] Find anything good?

714
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:04,733
- You scared me.
[Keith chuckles]

715
00:39:04,777 --> 00:39:05,865
- I'm a creep.

716
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:06,779
- [Zelda] Got it.

717
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:10,217
- [clears throat] You
know, it's too bad

718
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:14,395
it took Dad's death to bring
us all together like this.

719
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:17,833
But regardless, nice to see ya.

720
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,836
Beta, too. [chuckles]

721
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,273
Don't you think it's silly that
we all live in the same city

722
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:24,840
and yet we never see each other?

723
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:28,670
- Kinda makes sense.
[Keith chuckles]

724
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:32,021
- Hey, we even have the same
sense of humor. [chuckles]

725
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:34,633
Look, you know, I think
you'd actually like me,

726
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:37,636
if you'd just knock that
chip off your shoulder.

727
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:38,724
I'm pretty cool.

728
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:42,510
- Narc!
[Keith laughs]

729
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:45,034
- Hoo! [laughs]

730
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:47,167
See? That's effin' funny!

731
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:48,821
Hey, look.

732
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:55,262
I'm not gonna give you
shit like Adam did outside.

733
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,307
He told me what happened.

734
00:39:57,351 --> 00:39:59,179
- I wasn't doing drugs.
- No, hey, it's okay.

735
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,574
Adam's an asshole,
everybody knows that.

736
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:05,272
But, uh...

737
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:09,755
If you did have some
pot, [clicks tongue]

738
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:12,801
I know somebody who'd
like to smoke it with ya.

739
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:16,457
[chuckles] Looks like
a cigarette, right?

740
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,894
It's a one-hitter, you know?

741
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:21,070
[inhales sharply]

742
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:22,289
[chuckles]

743
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:23,159
Brand new.

744
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,600
What the fuck?

745
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,697
- [Zelda] Ow! Get off!

746
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,743
[muffled clattering]

747
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:42,570
Don't!

748
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:44,398
Stop, don't! Ow!

749
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,747
- Quit it!
- Let go of me, asshole!

750
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:47,009
- What's going on?
- Relax!

751
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:49,098
[slap]
[groans] You stupid bitch!

752
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:52,275
- Zelda? What the hell
is going on down there?

753
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,452
- [Keith] Man, she
is crazy! [chuckles]

754
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:55,844
- [Jane] Zelda, get out.

755
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,064
- Ma.
- No.

756
00:40:58,107 --> 00:41:00,283
No, you get out of here. Why
do you have to ruin everything?

757
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:01,720
- "Why do you have
to ruin everything?"

758
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:03,243
That's all anyone
here ever says to me!

759
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:04,549
Why doesn't somebody
invite me in

760
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:06,289
and lift me up and
not just my skirt?

761
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,900
- Whoa!

762
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:12,513
- Your father, God rest his
soul, was not with your mother

763
00:41:13,732 --> 00:41:15,168
for two years before
he came back to me,

764
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:18,606
and this family has been
paying the price ever since.

765
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,000
- And how long did he
stay with you that time?

766
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:22,784
- It was mutual.

767
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:23,568
- [Beta] Did you
lift up her skirt?

768
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:25,700
- No. No, she's lying!

769
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:28,311
She cuts herself. She's
got cuts all over her legs.

770
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:30,705
And I tried to get a look,
you know, and she attacked me.

771
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:32,490
I was concerned, she
was fuckin' bleeding,

772
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,795
and she fuckin' slapped
my fuckin' face!

773
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,144
- You have no right to do that.

774
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:36,494
- Is that

775
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:39,105
a marijuana pipe?

776
00:41:39,148 --> 00:41:40,759
- It's not mine!

777
00:41:41,629 --> 00:41:42,674
- Unbelievable.
- It's not-

778
00:41:42,717 --> 00:41:44,806
- That's it!
- Adam, what is that?

779
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,679
- Okay.
- It's illegal drugs.

780
00:41:48,636 --> 00:41:51,421
[door slams]

781
00:41:52,422 --> 00:41:53,815
- Keith, are you okay?
- Yeah.

782
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:55,208
- Unbelievable.
[Jane sighs]

783
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:58,385
It's always something
with her. Unbelievable.

784
00:41:59,865 --> 00:42:03,521
- "When is someone gonna
lift me up, invite me in."

785
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:07,133
Hah! We've been inviting
her in for 20 years.

786
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:12,051
And this is the thanks
we get. [laughs]

[Keith chuckles]

788
00:42:16,229 --> 00:42:17,143
- [Beta] Excuse me.

789
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,627
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

790
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,500
- Zelda?

791
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:32,158
- [Guy] Hey, Beta!

792
00:42:33,507 --> 00:42:34,334
- What?

793
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:37,598
- I'm sorry.

794
00:42:38,947 --> 00:42:39,861
- For what?

795
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,038
- I don't know.

796
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:45,563
- Okay?

797
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:47,042
Thanks.

798
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:47,913
- Hey!

799
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:51,264
Take care of yourself, okay?

800
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:35,787

803
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,669
- [Waiter] Are you sure you
don't want any cream or sugar?

804
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:50,758
- Um, I can just use these.

805
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:52,891
- That's butter.

806
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:03,945
- You sure you
don't want anything?

807
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:09,603
- Can you, can you just
take me back to Henry's?

808
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,648
I wanna get my phone.

809
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:12,824
- Sure.

810
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:16,697
Now? I just got my coffee.

811
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:18,438
- Sorry.

812
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:21,484

00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:47,685
- Thanks for not
making me say anything.

819
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,864
- Was there anything
you wanted to say?

820
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:54,735
- That wasn't my hitter.

821
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:56,824

explain yourself to me.

got cut myself anymore.

824

wanting to cut yourself, too.

00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:46,091
Henry?

833
00:45:49,094 --> 00:45:50,835
He's probably at the theater.

834
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:54,577
He left us half
a bottle of wine.

835
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:56,057
- He's so nice.

836
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:59,017
- Yeah, what's wrong with him?

837
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:03,543
- I think he cares
a lot about you.

838

I think he's good for you.

bigger mess than I am.

842
00:46:18,297 --> 00:46:19,602
And I'm a psycho, so-

843

- You're not a psycho.
[Zelda chuckles]

844

Especially me.

I mean, look what I did today.

I'm sorry.

849
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:47,630
Not that it's any excuse
for Keith's behavior.

850
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:50,633
I mean, I don't care
what his motives are.

851
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:52,940
My body is not for
his inspection.

852

I feel like I'm

853
00:46:56,683 --> 00:46:57,640

854
00:46:58,598 --> 00:47:01,601
just by being alive.

Somebody to go to.

00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:54,219
An adult.

870
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:58,136
To help us.

- But I need help.

874
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:17,198
- If you need help
in this country,

875
00:48:17,242 --> 00:48:19,200
you're gonna have
to take it by force.

876
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,950
If you wanted a family so
bad, you could've done that

877
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:32,083
20 years ago with
someone your own age.

878
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:33,214
That would've made
sense, wouldn't it?

879
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:34,563

- No.

- Still wanna get breakfast?

896
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:35,189
- Henry didn't get what he
wanted, so he threw an tantrum.

897
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,978
They get so offended when you
take control away from them.

898

- Yes, they do.

899

set designers.

- ZeeZee, is this
what I think it is?

910
00:50:20,582 --> 00:50:22,497
- I found it with Dad's
coat and I completely forgot

911
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,064
when Keith tried to
take my batteries out.

912
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:26,066
- Oh, my god, I was too scared
to ask. Have you read it?

913

- No, I wanted to save it so
we could read it together.

it remains very difficult
to find happiness alone.

00:50:58,403 --> 00:50:59,621
Isn't that odd?

We are compelled to share our
love of God, not hoard it.

932
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:10,371
But I did not write
you to speak of God.

nickname. "Jazz."

937
00:51:22,296 --> 00:51:23,254
- Do you think he
ever wrote him back?

938
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:25,299
- Well, if they did reconnect,

939
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:25,952
then nobody ever
heard about it, so-

940
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,260
- It's sad to think
he never responded.

941
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:31,131
Is there a return address?

942
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:32,959
- No.
- What about a date?

943
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:35,440
- November 19th, 2007.

944
00:51:35,483 --> 00:51:36,615

- What does that mean?

948
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:43,752
- It means that Uncle
Jerry still lived here,

949
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:46,668
or in this state, anyway,
when he sent the letter.

00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:27,688
But he was always very open
about not having any family.

1055
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:30,604
- Uh, Heart and Sold.
Are you sure of that?

1056
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:32,432
- Not really.

1057
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,215
- [chuckles] Okay,
we'll check it out.

1058
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:34,434
- Thank you so much.

1059
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:36,436
- What's your name?

1060
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,394
- I'm Brother Blake.

1061
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:39,526
Tell him...

1062
00:56:41,267 --> 00:56:43,487
Brother Blake says "hi."

1063
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:46,881
- You got it.

1064
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:48,405
- Tell him, tell him, tell
him to come and see me.

1065
00:56:50,015 --> 00:56:51,843
- Okay.
- Tell him, I'm...

1066
00:56:53,279 --> 00:56:55,020
Here until the end of the month.

1067
00:56:55,063 --> 00:56:57,239
- Okay, we will.
Thank you, Blake.

1068
00:56:57,283 --> 00:57:00,417
- Sure you don't want
the bulletin board?

1069
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,114
Five dollars.
- [chuckles] No, that's okay.

1070
00:57:02,157 --> 00:57:04,072
- And I could throw
in some prayers.

1071
00:57:04,116 --> 00:57:05,639
- [Zelda] No.

1072
00:57:05,683 --> 00:57:09,469
- Um, actually, is there
a phone that I could use?

1073
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:10,383
- Five bucks.

1074
00:57:13,473 --> 00:57:14,779
I'm joking.
[Beta and Zelda laugh]

1075
00:57:14,822 --> 00:57:16,041
It's in the room
around the corner.

1076
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:18,391
- Okay, [chuckles] thank you.

1077
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,132
I'm gonna go check my messages.

1078
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,222
- Take your time.

1079
00:57:37,715 --> 00:57:40,065
[phone keypad bleeps]

1080
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:42,589

1081
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:50,031

1082
00:57:50,075 --> 00:57:52,294
[phone rings]

1083
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:53,644
- [Machine] Zero messages.

1084
00:57:58,997 --> 00:58:00,651
[phone clacks]

1085
00:58:00,694 --> 00:58:01,782
[phone keypad bleeps]

1086
00:58:01,826 --> 00:58:03,567
[phone rings]

1087
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:05,612
- Operator.
- Hi, yes.

1088
00:58:05,656 --> 00:58:07,484
May I be connected to-
- What city?

1089
00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:09,094
- Oh, Chicago, sorry.

1090
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:13,359
May I be connected to Heart
and Sold Piano Gallery?

1091
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,621
- One moment.
[phone rings]

1092
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:16,362
- Thank you.

1093
00:58:16,405 --> 00:58:17,624
- [Man On Phone] Heart
and Sold Piano Gallery.

1094
00:58:17,668 --> 00:58:21,367
- Hi! Uh, yes, may I
please speak to Jerry?

1095
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:22,586
- [Man On Phone] Sure. Hold on.

1096
00:58:25,023 --> 00:58:27,678
[phone clacks]

1097
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:31,508
[muffled chatter from radio]

1098
00:58:38,993 --> 00:58:40,038
- You two are sisters?

1099
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,344
- Exactly.

1100
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:44,912
- You must be the baby.

1101
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:48,525
- I'm going to wait outside now.

1102
00:58:56,184 --> 00:58:57,359
- What did I say?

1103
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:03,714
- Okay, thank you, Blake.

1104
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:04,628
- [Blake] Bye bye.

1105
00:59:13,158 --> 00:59:14,942
[door opens]

1106
00:59:14,986 --> 00:59:16,770
- Hey, I just called
the piano gallery,

1107
00:59:16,814 --> 00:59:18,076
and he's there right now.

1108
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,035
Where'd you get that cigarette?

1109
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:22,515
- Off the ground.

1110
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,996
- You lit a random
cigarette butt?

1111
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:26,040
- It wasn't a butt.

1112
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:28,565
- That's disgusting.

1113
00:59:28,608 --> 00:59:30,218
- Okay, let us go.

1114
00:59:30,262 --> 00:59:33,352
[warm chamber music]

1115
00:59:39,445 --> 00:59:40,577
- Wait for me!

1116
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,755
[door closes]

1117
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:47,714
[door opens]

1118
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:48,585
[door closes]

1119
00:59:48,628 --> 00:59:50,021
- Is he in here?
- Shh!

1120
00:59:50,064 --> 00:59:51,631
- What?
- I'm looking.

1121
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,720
- It's not for me.

1122
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:54,895
- Well, who's it for?

1123
00:59:54,939 --> 00:59:56,418
- I told you!

1124
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:58,072
For a neighbor boy.

1125
00:59:58,116 --> 00:59:59,639
- Well, perhaps you
can return with him

1126
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:01,075
and he can help you
pick something out?

1127
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,600
- It's a surprise! I told you!

1128
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:07,604
- You wanna surprise the
neighbor boy with a piano?

1129
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:09,083
- Are you deaf?

1130
01:00:09,127 --> 01:00:11,129
- A little, in one ear.

1131
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,610
But I suspect your
question was rhetorical.

1132
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:14,436
- Excuse me?

1133
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,483
- I'll be with you
as soon as I can.

1134
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:20,399
- Um, we're actually
looking for Jerry.

1135
01:00:21,313 --> 01:00:22,488
- Oh, of course.
[woman sighs]

1136
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:24,969
All day long today. What
is it, his birthday?

1137
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:26,927
Meg!
[woman sighs]

1138
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:27,711
Meg!

1139
01:00:29,277 --> 01:00:30,278
Go get Jerry.

1140
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:36,284
My daughter.

1141
01:00:36,328 --> 01:00:40,680
- I have never waited for
a piano so long in my life!

1142
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,203
- [Beta] Thank you.

1143
01:00:42,247 --> 01:00:43,465
- Sure.

1144
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:45,642
Come, I'll show you some
other things we have.

1145
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:48,819
- Let's get out of here.
- What?

1146
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:51,778
- This doesn't
happen in real life.

1147
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:53,432
People don't get what they want.

1148
01:00:55,826 --> 01:00:59,394
He doesn't wanna meet us. He
didn't even want a family.

1149
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:04,269
Who are we to track him down
and force ourselves upon him?

1150
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,185
I feel like I'm gonna puke.
- You're just scared.

1151
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:09,796
- I think I preferred looking
forward to meeting him.

1152
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:13,713
- Fear means you're alive
and anything that makes you

1153
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,672
feel alive is good,
even if it's scary.

1154
01:01:17,848 --> 01:01:19,240
- He says to come out back.

1155
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,903
[thuds]

1156
01:01:30,556 --> 01:01:33,124
[door squeaks]

1157
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:35,343
- Oh, can I help you ladies?

1158
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:37,737
- We were told to
come back here.

1159
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:39,870
- By who?
- Um, by the girl inside.

1160
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:41,915
- [chuckles] I know that.

1161
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:45,179
- Oh, okay. Um, we
are looking for Jerry.

1162
01:01:46,093 --> 01:01:48,226
- You are?
- Yeah.

1163
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:51,055
- Um, again, who told you
that Jerry would be here?

1164
01:01:51,098 --> 01:01:54,145
- Uh, we called.
I called, earlier.

1165
01:01:54,188 --> 01:01:54,972
- [Man] Why?

1166
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,366
- Maybe we should
go back inside.

1167
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,934
- I don't know you, right?
You here to buy a piano?

1168
01:02:01,456 --> 01:02:02,675
- No.

1169
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,850
- Then what the fuck
are you doin' back here?

1170
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:05,199
- We thought Jerry
was back here.

1171
01:02:05,243 --> 01:02:06,723
I'm sorry, we're looking
for Jerry. We'll leave.

1172
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:08,202
- I'm Gerry.
- What?

1173
01:02:08,246 --> 01:02:09,073
- I'm Gerry!

1174
01:02:11,075 --> 01:02:11,902
- Oh.

1175
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:13,730
Um...

1176
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:17,734
We were looking
for somebody else.

1177
01:02:17,777 --> 01:02:20,345
- You're not here to buy weed?

1178
01:02:20,388 --> 01:02:21,912
[vomit splatters]
- Oh, my god!

1179
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:35,186
- Nah, keep it.

1180
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:36,056
- Thanks.

1181
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,233
- You sure you're okay, ZeeZee?

1182
01:02:39,277 --> 01:02:42,541
- Yeah, sorry. Thank you
for cleaning that up.

1183
01:02:43,281 --> 01:02:44,804
- Oh, no problem.

1184
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,501
I've never seen anything
like that before.

1185
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,895
You just straight up
puked for no reason.

1186
01:02:49,809 --> 01:02:51,898
- Well, I was nervous, I guess.

1187
01:02:51,942 --> 01:02:53,770
- I make white girls
nervous every day.

1188
01:02:55,162 --> 01:02:56,773
All I have to do is leave
the house. [chuckles]

1189
01:02:57,948 --> 01:02:59,210
Never seen one throw
up before, though.

1190
01:02:59,253 --> 01:03:01,038
- Well, it wasn't
you. I promise.

1191
01:03:02,691 --> 01:03:04,563
- I was nervous
myself too, I guess.

1192
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:07,958
I sell a little weed, you know?

1193
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:10,395
The job doesn't pay that much.

1194
01:03:10,438 --> 01:03:13,746
See two young rich white girls
walkin' up, asking about me.

1195
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,182
Spidey senses started tinglin'.

1196
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:16,705
- We're not rich. [chuckles]

1197
01:03:16,749 --> 01:03:17,576
- You're white.

1198
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,363
- Is it okay that we're
like sitting here?

1199
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:23,843
I mean, do you have
to get back to work?

1200
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:26,759
- Oh, no, no, it's cool.
Nobody buys pianos.

1201
01:03:27,629 --> 01:03:28,282
- What was on that truck?

1202
01:03:28,326 --> 01:03:29,457
- Weed.

1203
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:31,938
[all chuckle]

1204
01:03:34,288 --> 01:03:35,986
- [Beta] Well, I
guess we should go.

1205
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:38,815
- So who are you
guys looking for?

1206
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:41,687
- [Beta] Oh, someone told
us our uncle works here.

1207
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:44,081
- You don't know how
to find your uncle?

1208
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,911
His name's Gerry?
- Yeah.

1209
01:03:49,347 --> 01:03:50,827
- Nah, nah. I'm definitely the
only Gerry that works here.

1210
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:53,220
It's pretty much
just Richard and me.

1211
01:03:53,264 --> 01:03:54,656
And Meg, if you
wanna count bodies.

1212
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,659
- Definitely nobody else?
- Nobody else.

1213
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:01,620
[door closes]

1214
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:04,188
- At least we had fun.

1215
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:06,451
- Ladies, ladies.

1216
01:04:06,494 --> 01:04:08,192
I'm going to a party later
on at a buddy's house.

1217
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:10,847
You should come with.
Have a couple of drinks.

1218
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:13,371
Still goin', what, Honore and
Wellington, in Lakeview.

1219
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:16,461
- I don't wanna play beer pong.

1220
01:04:16,504 --> 01:04:17,375
- Just take my number, you know?

1221
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:19,029
You never know what you're
gonna need in the future.

1222
01:04:20,247 --> 01:04:21,161
- Well, I don't have
a phone. [chuckles]

1223
01:04:21,205 --> 01:04:22,423
- Mine's dead.

1224
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:23,337
- You don't have
