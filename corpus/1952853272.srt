Sitting next to him there is Scott. He's the one knitting.

I wouldn't make a big deal out of it, if I were you.

Last year he made us all real nice stockings to hang on the mantle at Christmas.

Over there too, that's the big guy. His name's Moose.

And the guy that he's throttling, the guy turning purple, that's Larry.

I've decided to discontinue the research. And sell the chimp to another facility.

It had been my understanding that Dr. Kendall was planning to send the chimpanzee back to El Simion Nature Preserve.

00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:38,057
[Screams]

174
00:35:56,727 --> 00:36:12,718
[Jeering]

175
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:18,560
What's up with you guys? I mean, all you do is goof around. We get our butts kicked every game.

176
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:21,543
-So?
-Do you like losing or something?

177
00:36:22,007 --> 00:36:25,999
That's easy for you to say, man... we don't have plans to turn the country on a hockey scholarship.

178
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:30,478
-Yeah, Wonderboy. My next job is gonna be in Moosejaw pumping gas at my Uncle's station.

179
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:32,866
-Yeah, and I'll be on the farm in Speedy Creek, tossing hay.

180
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:34,859
That's what happens when you get passed up by the scouts.

181
00:36:35,007 --> 00:36:39,398
At least, you can go out there with a little bit of pride, not look like a bunch of losers. That's all I'm saying.

182
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:49,600
-Hey! Guys, I think the kid's got a point.
-Come on... Whatever.

183
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,099
Hey!

184
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:12,723
Have you seen my math book?

185
00:38:12,927 --> 00:38:13,839
No.

186
00:38:20,447 --> 00:38:22,801
You haven't seen any monkeys again, have you?

187
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,244
No, how was practice?

188
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:34,564
Practice was fine.

189
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,565
Listen, tell me if you see anything, alright?

190
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:05,759
Hey.

191
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:34,576
Jack. The monkey you saw in the woods.

192
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:37,765
I wanted to surprise everybody.

193
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:42,577
Tara, it's not a good idea. I mean, mom's not gonna let you keep him.

194
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:54,442
I guess, we can take him with us today... but, we can't keep this secret much longer. I mean, look at him.

195
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:58,880
Go get dressed, alright?

196
00:43:05,487 --> 00:43:07,521
Honey, have you seen my glasses?

197
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,702
What?

198
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:19,566
These?

199
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:35,897
There they are.

200
00:43:50,067 --> 00:43:51,963
Thanks, kids.

201
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,335
It's okay.

202
00:44:44,567 --> 00:44:47,956
Trying to teach a chimp to skate, like that's gonna happen.

203
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:14,284
[Mouthes]

204
00:46:49,187 --> 00:46:54,524
I want to assure you, that we here at the university, are dedicated to getting back Jack. Jack back.

205
00:46:54,887 --> 00:47:01,264
Is it true many of the alumni have threatened to withold
their donations this year until Jack is found unharmed?

206
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:07,284
[Stammers] ...No Comment.

207
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:22,596
[KNOCKS] Hello! Hello? Mrs. Westover! It's so nice to finally meet you. We're early.

208
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:23,362
-Oh, just an hour.

209
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:30,322
[LAUGHS] Thank you so much for allowing the use your house for the metting today. Well, usually Rosemary would have the meeting at her house...

210
00:47:30,407 --> 00:47:36,738
But, ya know... Since she's in the middle of refurbishing her sofa. [Laughs] You have a coffee stain on your shirt.

211
00:47:37,207 --> 00:47:42,916
-Oh, come on in. Hi... Welcome, Come on in.

212
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:48,118
-O...kay.

213
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:51,680
You stay here. Be good.

214
00:47:55,507 --> 00:48:02,402
If I could have everyone's attention, please. As we bring our meeting to order.

215
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:12,360
Now... the first item on our agenda is... dog stuff. Now it has been brought to my attention, that some of our neighbours have experienced...

216
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:15,843
Well, lets just call them incidences on their front lawns. [Chattering]

217
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:35,557
Thought they'd left.

218
00:48:39,287 --> 00:48:44,679
Would you please excuse me? Have to refill the tray.

219
00:48:44,887 --> 00:48:45,803
-Oh yes, of course.

220
00:48:50,547 --> 00:49:00,686
[Indistinct Chatter] ... Which she then proceeded to get all over my new carpet!

221
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:04,780
-Eileen, I think it's your turn to speak.
-Thank you.

222
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:25,405
[Screams]

223
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:47,284
Hello again everybody! This is Willy Drucker, the voice of the Nuggets. Coming from you live from the Nelson Arena.

224
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:52,439
Tonight, the Nuggets go head to head against the Kamloops Buchaneers.

225
00:49:53,647 --> 00:49:55,276
[ORGAN PLAYING quickly]

226
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:57,879
[Very unenthusiastically] Charge!

227
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:11,796
Get him Moose! Hanging waist.

228
00:50:14,007 --> 00:50:18,636
[Grunts]

229
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,764
Alright Moose! Yeah, that's it!

230
00:50:54,687 --> 00:51:00,765
Hey Bill! You keep your fingers crossed. Maybe we're gonna win one tonight. Ok?

231
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:06,879
Oh, hey!

232
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:20,522
Okay boys! Let's go! Let's hustle! Way to hustle! Yeah! You're playing like you wanna win.

233
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:27,685
Moose! Get physical, that's what I've been trying to teach ya, pal.
We stay on a track, we may actually win this game.

234
00:51:28,887 --> 00:51:32,756
[Whispers] You didn't put anything in the water, did ya, caffeine or something?
-No way!

235
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:44,877
[Cheering]
-Yeah!

236
00:51:59,007 --> 00:52:07,463
[Nervously] Uhh, Uhh... Where'd it go? Somebody help me!
-Magoo, it's in the corner.
-Thanks Moose!

237
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:09,464
This corner?

238
00:52:10,807 --> 00:52:12,561
-Okay, there it is.

239
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:48,604
The Buch's player takes posession.
He shoots, he scores!

240
00:52:48,827 --> 00:52:51,041
-These teams are knotted at 2 a piece.

241
00:53:23,247 --> 00:53:25,444
Come on guys! Skate, Skate Skate, Skate! Let's Go!

242
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:24,863
[Mouthes]

243
00:54:39,767 --> 00:54:41,361
Looks like Ripchimpski is back.

244
00:54:42,107 --> 00:54:44,201
Wait a minute. It can't be. He's on the bench.

245
00:54:46,307 --> 00:54:51,764
Whoever he is, he just intercepted a pass... and he is FLYINGGG down the wing.

246
00:54:54,167 --> 00:55:00,240
WOW! New guy is fast.
He's so little.

247
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:07,682
I think he's from California too.

248
00:55:11,887 --> 00:55:17,960
The little guy winds up... A blistering shot!
HE SCORES!
[Cheering]

249
00:55:21,127 --> 00:55:23,244
That was sweet!

250
00:55:30,447 --> 00:55:35,403
-What was that?
-Who was that?
-Holy Toledo, that guy's good.

251
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:41,167
-What a minute! It's a monkey!

252
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:43,403
[SILENCE]

253
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,801
[LAUGHING]

254
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:55,477
Looks like Coach Marlow is up to his old tricks again
[LAUGHING]

255
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:59,161
[Whistle] Ineligable Player. No Goal.

256
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:05,285
Sorry about that coach. It'll never happen again.

257
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,285
Well, that's too bad. Looked like a keeper.

258
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:36,480
-Hey Mom.
-Hey honey.

259
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:38,565
How was your meeting?

260
00:56:38,767 --> 00:56:44,644
[Sarcastically] Oh Great. Until one of the ladies
decided she saw a monkey outside the window.

261
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:52,402
Hey... Where's Tara?
-Oh... Mom.
Tara has something she wants to show you.

262
00:57:03,407 --> 00:57:05,246
Oh my goodness.

263
00:57:11,207 --> 00:57:14,358
Well, thank you for looking. Goodbye.

264
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:21,561
No one seems to be missing a Chimp.
All the chimps at the zoo seem to be accounted for.

265
00:57:26,367 --> 00:57:32,245
Let me tell you what I predict. If you do this...
You'll have so many people will be coming to the games.
You won't have enough seats to put em all in.

266
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:38,482
Wait up. Technically he's a chimp.
But they say the chimp is our closest relative.

267
00:57:38,947 --> 00:57:39,979
You may have a point there.

268
00:57:41,507 --> 00:57:44,519
It's just like your sister Mavis joining the team.

269
00:57:50,247 --> 00:57:56,566
Well, that may not be the best example.
But I know what you mean.
-Think of all the increased revenue, Harry.

270
00:57:56,687 --> 00:58:01,585
Come on. Let me lay my cards on the table here. We all know you've been
losing money for years on these teams, okay?

271
00:58:01,627 --> 00:58:07,716
We know you have a profit sharing plan. So if this works out,
it's not just the Nuggets who cash in, we're all gonna make some bucks.

272
00:58:07,907 --> 00:58:14,763
Think about it!
-Yeah Harry! Then I could be buying that Nintendo my son's been on about all year.

273
00:58:15,627 --> 00:58:16,599
I say we vote yes!

274
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:20,477
I think the coach has a relevant thing here, eh? I say at least we'll win at the Box Office.

275
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:23,319
- Well, all those in favour? Say Aye!

276
00:58:23,527 --> 00:58:24,416
[All] AYE!

277
00:58:25,647 --> 00:58:31,481
Oh-ho, You are not going to regret this. Believe me.
You will not regret this! YES!

278
00:58:35,287 --> 00:58:40,397
For those of you who haven't noticed...
our hairy little cousin has been invited to join the team.

279
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:43,323
Ohh, I thought you were talking about my cousin Ernest.

280
00:58:43,627 --> 00:58:45,524
Are we gonna have like Monkey bars in here and stuff?

281
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:51,660
-No. As of last night, the board has offiically amended the rules.
So that Jack can be part of the nuggets. [Laughs]

282
00:58:52,647 --> 00:58:59,776
What? You mean we have a monkey on our team?
- With the help of this chimp, not a monkey,
we may have a Championship season, guys.

283
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:06,747
Uh... don't you mean a "Chimp"-ionship, sir?
[LAUGHS]

284
00:59:06,647 --> 00:59:11,481
Coach, are we on Candid Camera?

285
00:59:24,207 --> 00:59:29,538
Holy Chimp!
-Man! On skates he's a bullet.

286
00:59:35,767 --> 00:59:40,564
Excuse me! Are you guys waiting for
an invitation to go practice? Get on the ice!
Let's go!

287
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:43,527
Okay guys! Give me your best shot!
Let's see what you're made of.

288
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:50,579
Hey guys! Try to hit the net,
I need some practice here!

289
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:54,436
Huh?
-Finally!

290
00:59:56,647 --> 01:00:03,683
[All] Oooohhhhhhh
[LAUGHS]

291
01:00:12,727 --> 01:00:15,465
[LAUGHING]

292
01:00:15,667 --> 01:00:16,965
Here we go! Souvenir Peanuts!

293
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:24,580
The hard hitting Vikings have entered the arena.
If they win this game, they clinch a spot for themselves
for the Playoffs.

294
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:30,657
And if the Nuggets lose, they have absolutely
no chance of making the Playoffs.

295
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:39,424
WAIT A MINUTE! The monkey is back!
The crowd is going bananas!

296
01:00:48,207 --> 01:00:50,803
Don't worry Jack. They're all cheering for you.

297
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,840
Jack! Come on, Jack!

298
01:01:26,807 --> 01:01:29,040
Come on guys! Change it up!
Hustle, Hustle, Hustle!

299
01:01:33,247 --> 01:01:36,045
Harold! You better cover that Chimp!

300
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:42,397
Uh-oh! The Vikings have sent out Harold,
their top Defenseman to cover Jack.

301
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,405
Where is he? Where is he guys?

302
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:09,001
Oh and check it out, folks!
Jack is making a monkey out of the Viking defenseman!

303
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:12,380
What's the matter Harold,
can't cover your player, eh?

304
01:02:12,847 --> 01:02:13,199
Come on now, get outta here!

305
01:02:52,527 --> 01:02:54,460
I always said, these guys are winners!

306
01:03:17,447 --> 01:03:22,280
Well folks, that's it.
The Nuggets have their first victory of the season.

307
01:03:29,447 --> 01:03:34,401
Alright, Alright! Way to Play!
Way to Hustle!
We finally won one! I knew we could do it!

308
01:03:34,567 --> 01:03:36,597
Way to go gentlemen, Way to go!

309
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:41,716
Hey! Way to play Chimp!
And you too guys... you were good.

310
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:57,766
Don't worry, Tara. You'll do just fine.
-What if they make fun of me?
-They won't.

311
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:05,365
Bye!

312
01:04:28,847 --> 01:04:39,465
His name is Jack.
He speaks with his names,
but not in ASL like me.

313
01:04:47,807 --> 01:04:54,722
His favourite foods are bananas, raisins and Jube Jubes.

314
01:05:00,047 --> 01:05:05,685
Ready Magoo? I'm gonna go top right, alright?
-Yeah! I'm ready. Just shoot.

315
01:05:16,807 --> 01:05:19,598
I scored.
-Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

316
01:05:20,407 --> 01:05:22,241
You can't see, can you?

317
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:25,099
Of course I can see.

318
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:27,305
I didn't shoot the puck Magoo.

319
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:35,466
Well, I can see the big things.
-Magoo, you're a goalie.
Come on... I've got an idea.
Let's go.

320
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:45,858
Lights out.

321
01:05:47,847 --> 01:05:50,444
Will Jack be able to stay with us forever?

322
01:05:51,527 --> 01:05:54,200
No. We can't keep Jack forever.

323
01:05:54,787 --> 01:05:57,642
I'm sure Jack has a family of his own somewhere.

324
01:05:58,847 --> 01:06:02,476
But we can keep Jack for now.

325
01:06:03,807 --> 01:06:05,467
Oh, come here, baby.

326
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:39,683
Alice, for heaven's sake.
You're never gonna get that on there.

327
01:06:52,827 --> 01:06:55,564
Hey Mark. Caching, Caching.

328
01:06:58,567 --> 01:06:59,965
Thank you sir!

329
01:07:15,867 --> 01:07:18,601
Nice save.
-Thanks, man.
-Good job!

330
01:07:19,847 --> 01:07:21,725
[Crowd Cheering] MAGOO!

331
01:07:32,487 --> 01:07:33,639
Here ya go, buddy!

332
01:08:21,767 --> 01:08:26,484
Another win for the Nuggets,
now they're just one game away from going
all the way to the Harvest Cup.

333
01:08:26,547 --> 01:08:31,762
And that's gonna be a tough one.
Because they're up against their old arch-rivals,
The Kitimat Tigers.

334
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:52,602
Scott moves up the wing. OHH!
He's bulled by the Tiger bench.

335
01:08:52,707 --> 01:08:54,724
Ohh Yeah! [Laughing]

336
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:03,759
It's 2 all with less than 14 seconds left.

337
01:09:04,367 --> 01:09:06,462
It looks like we'll be going into Overtime.

338
01:09:20,007 --> 01:09:21,883
No Goal.

339
01:09:23,487 --> 01:09:25,765
[Crowd Booing]

340
01:09:25,807 --> 01:09:27,924
Get a pair of glasses, ref!

341
01:09:34,925 --> 01:09:35,925
What's up?

342
01:09:39,627 --> 01:09:42,456
Check the net. Tara, Jack missed.

343
01:09:57,467 --> 01:10:02,596
Hold on, it appears that the Golden Nuggets
Captain has asked the referee to check the net for a hole.

344
01:10:05,907 --> 01:10:08,982
It's a goal!
[Crowd Cheering]

345
01:10:30,247 --> 01:10:34,556
The Nuggets are going all the way
to the Harvest Cup!

346
01:10:41,767 --> 01:10:48,316
I understand, sir.
The alumni will not provide funds unless
Jack is safely returned.

347
01:10:48,587 --> 01:10:52,217
[TV] And now for today's play by play.
Nelson, BC is going ape over their newest hockey hero, Jack.

348
01:10:52,487 --> 01:11:00,598
A young chimpanzee. His blistering slapshot
has helped turn around a 40 game losing streak.
Leading them to win the Junior B Championship.

349
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:04,623
[Stammering]
- [Shounting] Dr. Peabody!!

350
01:11:04,887 --> 01:11:10,960
I'll have that chimp back within 48 hours!
Get me Einsteen!

351
01:12:05,167 --> 01:12:06,245
Pete.

352
01:12:37,147 --> 01:12:39,920
Woah... Check out the size of that building!

353
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:51,402
Man... totally sure, we aren't in Kansas anymore.

354
01:13:13,867 --> 01:13:15,358
Well boys... this is it.

355
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:18,916
It's the big time.

356
01:13:19,127 --> 01:13:20,795
This is my 15 minutes of fame.

357
01:13:21,107 --> 01:13:22,721
Man, this place rocks!

358
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:26,203
Aww, man. I gotta take a seat.

359
01:13:33,407 --> 01:13:36,365
I love the smell of zamboni fumes in the morning.

360
01:13:44,047 --> 01:13:46,685
Welcome to Harvest Cup! Section 117.

361
01:13:50,207 --> 01:13:55,441
Welcome hockey fans! We're broadcasting live from GM Place in Vancouver.

362
01:13:55,887 --> 01:14:02,321
This is the final of the Harvest Cup.
Between the Nelson Golden Nuggets
and the Calgary Polar Bears.

363
01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:12,345
And who would've though, Don. That the Nelson Golden Nuggets
would be here all the way at the Harvest Cup,
after a string of loses they suffered earlier in the season.

364
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:25,964
This is a Cinderella story like few have ever seen.
These Nuggets might lose a hole, because they're up against
the toughest Junior A team in the country, The Calgary Polar Bears.

365
01:14:26,327 --> 01:14:33,525
And as usual the stands are full of scouts tonight,
as they look at the finest display of talent in Western Canada.

366
01:14:41,287 --> 01:14:44,847
Don't worry, Jack. It's just another game alright?
Play hard.

367
01:15:09,007 --> 01:15:15,725
Boy-o-Boy, it's 1-0 for the Polar Bears before the first whistle.
Your Nuggets are reeling already.

368
01:15:16,287 --> 01:15:20,803
I wouldn't count the Nuggets out yet, Don.
Remember it's not over til it's over.

369
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:40,300
Woo! Magoo is in the house!

370
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:48,645
Advantage has to go to the Polar Bears.
The Nuggets haven't mustered any offense at all.
[HORN BLARES]

371
01:15:53,767 --> 01:16:00,321
Hey, kid. Have you seen this chimp?
- Where is the Golden Nuggets locker room?

372
01:16:03,687 --> 01:16:06,636
Wait!  Come back here!

373
01:16:11,447 --> 01:16:14,637
Hey Tara! Hey Steven...
-Hey, what's up?

374
01:16:16,427 --> 01:16:19,643
Some guys want to take Jack?
-Whats going on?

375
01:16:20,547 --> 01:16:22,515
-Some guy wants to take Jack.
-There she is!

376
01:16:23,567 --> 01:16:26,758
-Dr. Peabody, Pueblo University.
-Hi, I'm Coach Marlow.

377
01:16:27,807 --> 01:16:29,759
You're not thinking about taking our star player, now are ya?

378
01:16:30,087 --> 01:16:37,203
Because that would really throw a monkey wrench into something
that these big strapping strong young hockey players
have worked a long time to work for.

379
01:16:37,567 --> 01:16:41,565
We have a court order and we're not leaving 
without that chimp!

380
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:51,459
Is that a fact? Huh?
This area by the way is only for hockey players. Which you are not.
So unless you're gonna put on some skates. You'll have to excuse me.

381
01:16:52,527 --> 01:16:56,200
-Have a nice day.
-Tootles.
-I want that... [Stammers]

382
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:09,702
Come on you guys!

383
01:17:13,607 --> 01:17:14,962
Steven! Up the middle!

384
01:17:22,463 --> 01:17:25,563
Holy Cow! What a blistering piece of rubber!

385
01:17:30,407 --> 01:17:32,284
So, what are we gonna do now?

386
01:17:34,127 --> 01:17:36,797
We'll get him at the end of the game, before he leaves the ice.

387
01:17:37,327 --> 01:17:39,685
We have all the exits covered.

388
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:51,703
What's up? Oh, there they are.
What'd they say?

389
01:17:54,704 --> 01:17:58,704
End of the game, huh? Thanks.

390
01:18:02,847 --> 01:18:09,683
Well I never would've imagined it,
but this could be the hardest fought contest
in the hardest Cup, we've seen in a long time.

391
01:18:12,927 --> 01:18:14,758
Hey, what's up?

392
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,438
What's this? This is where Jack's from?

393
01:18:35,567 --> 01:18:43,519
Jack, I know they're taking you away at the end of the game.
I was knitting this hat for you.

394
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:47,520
It's not quite done yet. But I wanted you to have it.

395
01:18:48,407 --> 01:18:50,623
I'm sure gonna miss you Jack.

396
01:18:55,287 --> 01:19:00,437
Hey, Coach. I guess you know I've been healthy for months.

397
01:19:02,687 --> 01:19:07,076
Yeah, I knew that Pete. It takes a man to admit that.
- Man, I sure love playing.

398
01:19:07,477 --> 01:19:09,077
...Maybe even as much as Jack.

399
01:19:11,527 --> 01:19:17,677
Woah, hey. You wanna stop blaming yourself?
They've got a court order to take Jack.
There's nothing you can do about it. Okay?

400
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:20,243
Yeah, I guess you're right.

401
01:19:28,787 --> 01:19:31,804
Hey Coach. I've got an idea to save Jack.

402
01:19:52,967 --> 01:19:58,481
Hello? Hi. This is Steven Westover.
I'm calling about a chimpanzee.

403
01:20:00,647 --> 01:20:02,480
Jack, yeah! That's it. Perfect.

404
01:20:04,867 --> 01:20:10,677
I don't believe it. Right Winger Gold Nuggets Top Scorer
Steven Westover is out with an injury.

405
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:15,377
And he's been replaced by Captain Pete Ripchimpski,
who's also returning from an injury.

406
01:20:15,447 --> 01:20:20,004
Well that's a real shame. Because Westover played well
in that second period and had a couple of great scoring chances.

407
01:20:21,127 --> 01:20:25,681
Jack's gonna have to step forward and
pick up his pace now that Westover's gone.

408
01:20:26,007 --> 01:20:29,836
Hey! Good to see you back on skates Ripchimpski.
-Good to be back Coach.

409
01:20:30,087 --> 01:20:33,679
What are you standing around for?
Go score me some goals! Let's Go!

410
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:04,359
Sir... Can you put the radio on to the hockey game?
If possible.

411
01:21:24,567 --> 01:21:30,639
[Radio] That save is huge!
That puck was signed, sealed and delivered. Top shelf. Right side.

412
01:21:34,847 --> 01:21:39,077
2 minutes, 30 seconds to go.
-And it's a tie game!

413
01:21:40,247 --> 01:21:42,658
Come on, let's get ready.

414
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:49,318
[Radio] The Nuggets managed just 2 shots on that Powerplay.
This game's starting to open up a bit.

415
01:21:49,287 --> 01:21:50,080
Here we go!

416
01:22:27,687 --> 01:22:30,963
It's in! It's in! Goal!

417
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:48,721
We Won! You hear that? We won!
We won the Harvest Cup! Isn't that awesome?

418
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:47,797
I am Dr. Heimlich Peabody and I have a court order to take this monkey
back to Pueblo University.

419
01:23:48,287 --> 01:23:49,944
Now who are you calling a monkey?

420
01:23:50,167 --> 01:23:51,759
It's a girl.

421
01:23:52,167 --> 01:23:56,523
[LAUGHING]

422
01:24:05,007 --> 01:24:07,796
-Thank You.
-Have a nice flight.

423
01:24:15,567 --> 01:24:25,957
Hey. Well, this is it, you're on your way home, where you belong.
With your family.

424
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:29,876
Tara asked me to give you these.

425
01:24:35,127 --> 01:24:38,326
[SPEAKER] Final Boarding Call.
-That's you.

426
01:24:40,387 --> 01:24:41,799
Gotta go now.

427
01:24:46,667 --> 01:24:48,522
We'll see you later, okay?

428
01:24:49,327 --> 01:24:50,358
Thank you.

429
01:25:45,767 --> 01:25:49,919
[CHEERING]

430
01:25:59,487 --> 01:26:01,824
How's Jack?
-He's on his way.

431
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:06,446
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

432
01:26:08,447 --> 01:26:13,663
Did you hear? Magoo just got signed by the farm team for the Mighty Ducks!
-That's Awesome!

433
01:26:15,627 --> 01:26:19,166
-Where's Jack?
-He's on his way home.

434
01:26:52,727 --> 01:26:56,683
Westover! Come on! They can take your picture later.
There's someone I want you to meet.

435
01:26:58,684 --> 01:27:02,684
This is Sam Richards, a good old friend of mine. Steven Westover.
- Nice to meet you.

436
01:27:02,947 --> 01:27:08,286
Just wanted to invite you to join the team this fall.
-He coaches a team in Vancouver, WHL.

437
01:27:08,367 --> 01:27:14,682
Now, it's a big commitment. Might want to discuss this with your folks.
-Yeah.

438
01:27:16,207 --> 01:27:21,516
-I've already thought about it, that's awesome. I'll be there.
-You call me.
-Yeah, I will.

439
01:27:22,427 --> 01:27:24,315
-Alright, man. Way to go!

440
01:28:03,447 --> 01:28:08,597
JACK! Buddy, where ya been?
What took you so long?
