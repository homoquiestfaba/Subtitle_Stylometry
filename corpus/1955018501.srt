1
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,322
(Rattling)

2
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:34,682
Priest:
God, the father of mercies,

3
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:35,783
Through the death and
resurrection of his son,

4
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,651
Has reconciled the world
to himself

5
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,654
And sent the holy spirit
among us for the forgiveness
of our sins.

6
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,790
May almighty God grant you
pardon and peace.

7
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,426
I absolve you of your sins
in the name of the father,

8
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,895
The son, and the holy spirit.

9
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,375
(Television playing)

10
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,414
Sal!

11
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,588
(Light snoring)

12
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:31,064
(Rock music blaring)

13
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:06,600
(Laughing)

14
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,203
It's the truth.

15
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,706
And all I said was...
(Laughs)

16
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,476
"Get that fat little bastard
the heck out of my rectory."

17
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:17,845
No, father, no.

18
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:27,788
Francis.

19
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,725
I was just telling
your mother about

20
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,994
Our little renovation
downtown at the church.

21
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,598
Father Gillespie here

22
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:41,001
Was kind enough to deliver
my bingo winnings personally.

23
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,003
And in return...

24
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,106
Your dear mother
was kind enough
to offer me

25
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,941
Her very gracious
hospitality.

26
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:53,547
You take care
of that lovely mother
of yours, Francis.

27
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:56,750
Oh, Francis...

28
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,153
Last week was
the first time

29
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,690
I'd seen you
in confessional for
quite some time.

30
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,759
Guess I haven't had
that mmm-mm

31
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,028
Mm-mm much to confess.

32
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,062
Oh.

33
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,601
Every day is a struggle
to redeem ourselves

34
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:16,136
In the eyes of God.

35
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,171
The heart is deceitful
above all things

36
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,040
And desperately wicked.

37
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,877
We're all
soldiers, Francis.

38
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:27,047
We're soldiers
in the battle
to redeem ourselves

39
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,749
From ourselves.

40
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:32,152
Now, let me suggest
something to you.

41
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,888
We all need

42
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:38,091
To plumb the depths of
our own imperfection.

43
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,797
We all succumb
to temptation.

44
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,899
But for those of us

45
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,901
Who struggle
to free ourselves

46
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:50,671
From the guilt
and suffering
of human frailty,

47
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:53,206
Perhaps we should ask,

48
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,809
"Have I done all I can

49
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,746
To make it worth
his time to listen?"

50
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,850
Have I truly confronted
my darker side?

51
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,852
Have I given myself cause

52
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,087
"To tell God
of my weakness?"

53
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,889
Now, you have got
to go out there...

54
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:15,663
And you gotta make
a reason for God
to listen.

55
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,698
You've gotta go into
that confessional

56
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:20,200
And have something
to say.

57
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,969
Otherwise...

58
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,171
Well, what's the point?

59
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,810
You see what
I'm getting at here,
Francis?

60
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,978
Hmm?

61
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,981
Good boy.

62
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,750
Good boy.

63
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:56,169
(Television plays)

64
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,660
Francis:
Forgive me, father,
for I have sinned.

65
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:23,063
It's been...

66
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,832
A month since my last
confession.

67
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,338
About a week ago,

68
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,340
I know it's not an excuse,

69
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,644
But it was crowded,

70
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,046
And I got on the bus
without paying.

71
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:44,818
Several...

72
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,854
Many times I've had
impure thoughts.

73
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,957
Many times I've acted on them.

74
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,732
And sometimes...

75
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:04,371
Sometimes I question
my faith...

76
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,206
In God.

77
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,211
Sometimes I feel
like I hate him.

78
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:17,250
I don't hate him,
of course.

79
00:10:17,317 --> 00:10:19,820
No. I mean, I just,

80
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:23,090
I wonder if he really
does exist,

81
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,993
How he could let

82
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,995
So many bad things happen?

83
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,098
(Hollers)

84
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:56,716
(Rock music blares)

85
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,135
(Clanking)

86
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,208
Fuck!

87
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,357
Hey there.

88
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,529
You know,
you got a leak

89
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,164
Somewhere?

90
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,635
It's, uh, you know,

91
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:51,138
Running down into
number two downstairs.

92
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,843
It's probably
the hot water tap,

93
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,546
'Cause that's
what it usually is
in these buildings.

94
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,216
You get a certain kind
of accumulation in, uh,

95
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,385
You know,
in the pipes,

96
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,220
And the pressure
builds up and bam!

97
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,521
The joints,
they just go.

98
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,465
(Television plays)

99
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,281
(Giggling)

100
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:23,123
(Boisterous laughter)

101
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:48,215
You've met Vic,
haven't you?

102
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,020
Your mother
is a laugh a minute!

103
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,155
Oh, God,
I almost forgot

104
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,489
I was on the job.

105
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,326
What job?

106
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,165
See what I mean?

107
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,503
I've asked Vic
to stay for dinner.

108
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,573
Would you go in there

109
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,243
And cook up
something nice,
will you, Francis?

110
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,049
(Television playing)

111
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,345
Hey, there.

112
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:56,349
I guess I'll be
heading out.

113
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,218
Okay.

114
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,120
Thanks for the food.
That was good.

115
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,422
It was real good.

116
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,025
My compliments
to the chef.

117
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,768
You know, your mom...

118
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,804
That's a special lady.

119
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,573
Yeah.

120
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,310
Real special lady.

121
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,050
Okay, well...

122
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,187
Take it easy.

123
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,191
(Rock music blares)

124
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,635
What the hell is this?

125
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,504
Oh, hey, Mr. haroon...

126
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,871
Hey, yourself!

127
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,708
Get your feet
off my counter!

128
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:04,244
- I didn't expect you...
- of course you didn't
expect me.

129
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,313
I don't want you
to know I'm coming.

130
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,881
That way I see
when you fuck me.

131
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,517
What you think,
I pay you all day

132
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,884
To watch comic books?

133
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:23,830
Hey!

134
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,165
Fucker!

135
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,508
Are you alright?

136
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,009
(Faint accent)
I know I shouldn't fight,

137
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,846
But I couldn't let
the little shit
get away with it.

138
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:43,250
It's a sorry comment
on the world,

139
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,517
I'll tell you that.

140
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,658
Thanks, by the way.

141
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,693
Most people
would've kept walking.

142
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,929
I know you.

143
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,899
Yeah, I've seen you before.

144
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,534
You must live
around here.

145
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,803
I live around the corner.

146
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,839
Right. Gloria.

147
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,641
Francis.

148
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,743
Can I offer you
a cup of coffee
or something?

149
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,646
- No, I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

150
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,848
I feel like
it's the least
I can do.

151
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,551
Yeah. No.

152
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,820
Okay.

153
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,822
Well, thanks again.

154
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,853
Fuck.

155
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,531
Is that you, Francis?

156
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,471
Francis?

157
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,739
(Shouts)
Francis!

158
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,140
What?

159
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,709
Why don't you answer me,
for Christ's sakes?

160
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:19,746
I could be dying of
a heart attack in here.

161
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,747
Jesus.

162
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,992
What's the holdup
in there?

163
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,961
Francis:
No holdup.

164
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,920
You've done it
again, Francis.

165
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:12,399
Pass the salt, please.

166
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:26,813
I didn't know
which one was yours.

167
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,949
Looks like
I guessed right.

168
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,084
I wanted to thank you
for last night.

169
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,853
You already did.

170
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,422
I know.
It just seems

171
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,424
Like it calls
for something more.

172
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,592
Anyway, I was hoping
you'd be my guest
for dinner.

173
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,095
I can't.
My mother,

174
00:22:43,162 --> 00:22:44,797
She doesn't like
to be alone.

175
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,833
Why don't you
bring her along?

176
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,935
I don't think so.

177
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,903
Maybe a short dinner,
then.

178
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,442
Tomorrow night?

179
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,611
Around 7:00?

180
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:04,684
I'll see you then.

181
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,019
You know the building.
I'm in 706.

182
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,892
(Television plays)

183
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,761
(Knocks)

184
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,538
Hi.

185
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,175
Come in.

186
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,687
How about a glass
of wine?

187
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:15,988
Okay.

188
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,466
Here you are.

189
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,240
To acts of heroism,
large and small.

190
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,085
- (Glass drops)
- It's alright.

191
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,887
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

192
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,058
- I'd better go.
- No, please.

193
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,159
It's alright.

194
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,028
I'd really like you
to stay.

195
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,966
I hope you aren't
a big meat fan.

196
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,069
I'm a vegetarian.
A vegan, actually.

197
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:07,206
What's a ve...
Ve... vegan?

198
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,276
It's someone who doesn't
eat animal products.

199
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,745
No meat, cheese,
eggs, butter,

200
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,747
That kind of thing.

201
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:16,282
Why?

202
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,618
I guess I'm just
not interested

203
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,186
In perpetuating
the cycle of cruelty.

204
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:25,257
Animals feel pain
just like we do.

205
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,227
If people only knew
what they do to them

206
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,130
So we can have our steak
and cheese and eggs.

207
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:37,870
Beautiful creatures
cry for mercy

208
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:40,006
As the butcher's axe
comes down.

209
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:43,643
But all they know
is a merciless blow,

210
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,379
And a sad farewell
to a life so dear

211
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:50,850
Before they land
on a table so grand,

212
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,019
And a fat old man

213
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,154
Can raise
his withered sick hand

214
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,124
And swallow
their smoking,
bloody flesh

215
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:00,559
And get heart disease
and bowel cancer.

216
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,868
- Do you like it?
- What?

217
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,102
The view.

218
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:13,439
Oh, yeah.

219
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:16,943
It's the main reason
I took the apartment.

220
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,412
Somehow I can't bring myself
to close the blinds.

221
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:24,951
Don't you worry that
ppe-pe-people can see in?

222
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,453
The windows
across the street
aren't high enough.

223
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:30,222
That's the beauty
of it, really.

224
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,660
So, tell me
about yourself.

225
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,664
Like what?

226
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,832
I don't know, like, um,

227
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,834
How long have you
lived here?

228
00:26:45,838 --> 00:26:50,076
We moved here
when I was 10.

229
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,344
Before that
we lived in a house.

230
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,686
It burnt down.

231
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:01,620
That must have been awful.

232
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,990
Yeah.

233
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,961
How about your family?

234
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:11,230
Do you have any brothers
or sisters?

235
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,199
I have a brother.

236
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:17,837
My mother and father
are dead.

237
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,806
I thought you lived
with your mother?

238
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,140
No.

239
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:23,843
I mean, no...

240
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,379
I live with my
step-m-m-mother.

241
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,015
Oh.

242
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,322
(Sighs)

243
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,662
(Loud rock music plays)

244
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,900
Gloria:
You're an interesting one.

245
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:22,902
You don't say much.

246
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:24,703
But there's something
going on in there.

247
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,307
There's definitely
something going on.

248
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,545
Have you ever thought
that you really
knew someone

249
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,915
And then one day
you discovered

250
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,917
You never really
knew them at all?

251
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:40,152
You might
have been convinced
that you knew them,

252
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,921
Really convinced.

253
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:43,923
And then they said
something

254
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,192
Or they
did something...

255
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:49,228
And you discover
it was all such
an illusion.

256
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:54,466
I guess it works
the other way around,
too.

257
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:59,505
You meet someone
who seems very different

258
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,809
And though you
barely know them...

259
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,345
You discover
you might just as well

260
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,214
Have known them
all your life.

261
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,419
Somehow I feel that way
about you.

262
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:17,223
It's funny, I know,

263
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,225
But you seem
so familiar.

264
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,500
- Sorry.
- Francis?

265
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,636
- I have to go.
- What's wrong?

266
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,905
I have to go.

267
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,876
I'm sorry.

268
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,789
Francis?

269
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,196
Francis?

270
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,799
Francis, would you please
just hear me out?

271
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,637
I'm sorry
if I offended you.

272
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,975
That was the absolute
last thing in the world
I wanted to do.

273
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:10,943
You've got to know that.

274
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:14,881
Sometimes you've got
to trust people.

275
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,350
Sometimes
you've got to have
a little faith.

276
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,158
Sal:
Is that you, Francis?

277
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,194
(Shouts)
Francis!

278
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,962
What?

279
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:21,147
I've never...

280
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,685
Now, if I were to guess,

281
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:37,256
I'd venture there was
something different
about you, Francis.

282
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,690
Oh, yes, I would.

283
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:40,026
Wouldn't you, Vic?

284
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,228
Huh?

285
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:46,065
He looks about
the same to me.

286
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,733
Oh, no, no, no.

287
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,036
There's something
about him.

288
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,738
I just can't quite
put my finger on it.

289
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,579
I know what it is.

290
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:03,315
Francis has got himself
a little girlie friend.

291
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:05,084
Isn't that it, Francis?

292
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,320
A real live
little girlie friend.

293
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:10,422
Coming and going
at all hours,

294
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,458
Hair combed over
like that.

295
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:16,695
Don't you play dumb
with me, buddy boy.

296
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,199
You can't fool
your mama.

297
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:23,602
Who would've thought
you could con some
little slut into it?

298
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,472
I gotta give you
credit for that.

299
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,874
Never underestimate
the desperation

300
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:31,210
Of the truly desperate.

301
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,212
That's what I always say.

302
00:33:33,245 --> 00:33:36,348
Very p-p-profound.

303
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:39,751
(Mocking)
Very pro-pro-profound.

304
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:42,488
I bet that goes over
real big with the chicks.

305
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,223
(Laughs)

306
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,640
- What's this?
- What?

307
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,142
This, right here.

308
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,279
A birthmark.

309
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:10,048
Looks like Spain.

310
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,386
I don't know
what Spain looks like.

311
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:18,390
It's a profile of a guy

312
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,626
With a pointy nose,

313
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,794
And a pompadour,

314
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:26,064
Sort of nibbling on
Portugal, right here.

315
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,577
What is it?

316
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:42,548
You're pretty,

317
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:45,284
And you're smart
and you're n-nice.

318
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:51,523
And I guess
I don't know why

319
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,559
Anyone like you
would want to be with

320
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,295
S-someone like me.

321
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:59,698
I want to be with you
because I like you.

322
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,500
You're a good person.

323
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,836
And I do want
to be with you.

324
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,638
Believe that.

325
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:17,683
Francis:
Forgive me, father,
for I have sinned.

326
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:21,487
It's been a month
since my last confession.

327
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:27,259
On several occasions I've taken
the lord's name in vain.

328
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,232
I found a quarter
on the floor at work

329
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,234
And I didn't tell anyone.

330
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:39,338
Many times...

331
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:42,608
I've had impure thoughts,

332
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,143
And acted on them.

333
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,550
Several times
I've fornicated.

334
00:35:56,922 --> 00:36:00,426
On one occasion,
I fed my mm-mother
cat food.

335
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,833
These are my sins
for which I am
truly sorry.

336
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:21,179
(Muffled praying)

337
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:58,550
Woman:
The thought of having
kids right now

338
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,552
Couldn't terrify me more.

339
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,688
I thought that was
your intention from
the beginning.

340
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,856
Of course it was,
but, uh,

341
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,692
A few minor technicalities
prevent it.

342
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,594
I really don't think

343
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,696
They want to hear
about that now, dear.

344
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,698
Ken's semen isn't
quite up to snuff.

345
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:15,567
His little sailors are dead
long before they hit
open water,

346
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,102
So to speak.

347
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,870
They're poorly motile.

348
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:22,674
More bharat nutloaf,
anyone?

349
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,443
Thanks, no.
It was delicious.

350
00:37:24,476 --> 00:37:25,844
Francis?

351
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:26,878
No.

352
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:31,950
Did anyone hear the story
a couple weeks back

353
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:35,454
About a couple who kept
their 16-year-old

354
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,823
In a broom closet
from the age of three?

355
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,991
When the police found him,

356
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,093
The mother said
she did it because

357
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:44,330
Jesus Christ told her to
in a vision.

358
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,365
That is awful.

359
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:48,033
The atrocities
people commit
in that man's name.

360
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,368
It's unbelievable.

361
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,004
I mean, what relevance
does somebody
like Jesus Christ

362
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,573
Have today, you know,

363
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,476
Except as an excuse
or a crutch

364
00:37:57,543 --> 00:38:01,347
For the uneducated,
the downtrodden,
and the insane?

365
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:02,948
You got that right, honey.

366
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,653
He died for our sins.

367
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:13,425
He gave his life
so that we could live.

368
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,795
Why would he do
a thing like that?

369
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,164
- Honey.
- No, really.

370
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,166
Why would anyone
walk to their death

371
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,934
To save a bunch
of nonbelievers?

372
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:29,975
Because he loved them.

373
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:38,049
I'm sorry if
I embarrassed you.

374
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:41,620
No, it was priceless.

375
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,490
Do you really believe
all that stuff

376
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:46,925
About the father
and the son
and the holy ghost?

377
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,762
I guess.

378
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:52,731
And the virgin Mary?

379
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,734
Yeah.

380
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:59,805
You're committing a sin
right now, you know.

381
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:03,842
I know.

382
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,544
Don't you feel guilty?

383
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,516
Yeah.

384
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,117
You really do,
don't you?

385
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,957
We're very d-different.

386
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,959
Not that different.

387
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,995
(Rock music blares)

388
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,044
You like it?

389
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,715
Yeah.

390
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,650
It's g-good.

391
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:01,386
It's okra.

392
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,155
I'll make a vegetarian
out of you yet.

393
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,736
(Telephone)
Operator 44.

394
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:59,370
Are you calling to report
a missing child?

395
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:04,843
Yes. I mean, no.

396
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,411
I want to report
seeing one.

397
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:10,248
Can you tell me where
you saw this individual?

398
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,250
I saw her in a photo.

399
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:16,254
I process photos,
and her picture

400
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:20,258
Was on a roll of film
someone dropped off.

401
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,828
Do you know this person?
Do you know the name?

402
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:26,998
I think the name started
with a "j,"

403
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,333
Like Jones.

404
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:40,011
May I have the salt, please?

405
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:42,113
Oh, sure.

406
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:44,149
Thank you.

407
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:48,954
Thank you.

408
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,157
You're welcome.

409
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:20,051
(Lighter won't flame)

410
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,322
You gonna tell me
what's going on

411
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,124
Between you two?

412
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:29,127
Between who?

413
00:45:29,995 --> 00:45:31,863
You and Vic.

414
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:36,968
I haven't
the slightest idea

415
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:38,970
What you're
talking about.

416
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:45,076
You nnn-know

417
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,078
What I'm talking
about.

418
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:49,014
You think
I can't see it?

419
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,020
- He likes you.
- So what?

420
00:45:57,555 --> 00:46:01,292
He lll-likes you.

421
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,494
And?

422
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:05,496
He's a man.

423
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,965
Can I help that?

424
00:46:07,032 --> 00:46:10,035
A mmm-man, sal.

425
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:13,972
And what am I supposed
to do about that?

426
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:16,307
What?

427
00:46:19,878 --> 00:46:22,247
You got a lot of nerve,

428
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:24,049
You know that?

429
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,052
What gives you the right?

430
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,389
What gives you the right
to judge me? Huh?

431
00:46:32,858 --> 00:46:34,359
He knows.

432
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,095
He knows who
he's dealing with.

433
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,230
Yes siree Bob.

434
00:46:39,264 --> 00:46:40,899
Don't you worry.

435
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:44,369
He's got a special place
in hell just for you,

436
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,371
Just for a masturbating,

437
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:49,007
Faithless little pervert
like you.

438
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,976
You don't think
he knows?

439
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:52,978
He knows
these filthy hands.

440
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:55,280
He knows this face.

441
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,083
Put a little mark there
just to remind him.

442
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,386
Better believe me.

443
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:03,454
He's got your number,
buddy boy.

444
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:07,025
Just like he got
your daddy's.

445
00:47:07,058 --> 00:47:09,094
Maybe yours too, sal.

446
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:25,176
What are you
thinking about?

447
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,377
Me?

448
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:29,380
I don't know.

449
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:34,185
Nn-nothing.

450
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,955
Nobody's ever
thinking of nothing.

451
00:47:41,292 --> 00:47:43,962
How long have you
been a... a...

452
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:46,131
A vegan?

453
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:50,501
I don't know.
About 15 years.

454
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:55,106
Doesn't it ever
bother you...

455
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:57,108
You know,
that I'm not?

456
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:58,243
No.

457
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,080
If it did bother you,
would you tell me?

458
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:04,215
But it doesn't.

459
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:08,286
Well, if it did?

460
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:12,190
If it did bother me,

461
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,092
I doubt we'd be
together, don't you?

462
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:26,237
(Coughing)

463
00:48:36,982 --> 00:48:39,184
(Coughing continues)

464
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:28,519
What did...

465
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:30,421
What did you do
last night?

466
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:32,190
Nothing much.

467
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:34,725
I went to sleep
pretty early.

468
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:37,728
Rr-really?

469
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:40,431
Yeah, I wasn't
feeling well.

470
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:42,867
How come?

471
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,869
I was a little
nauseous.

472
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:50,841
- Why?
- I don't know.
I just was.

473
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:53,611
You must have
some idea.

474
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,846
Not really, no.

475
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,683
Nobody doesn't at least
have a theory

476
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:01,552
About why they feel
nauseous.

477
00:52:01,586 --> 00:52:04,121
Well, I don't.

478
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,757
Well...

479
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,459
That's just sss-

480
00:52:08,493 --> 00:52:09,594
Stupid.

481
00:52:11,496 --> 00:52:13,464
Are you feeling
alright?

482
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:15,866
I feel fine.

483
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:19,337
You seem kind of tense.

484
00:52:19,404 --> 00:52:21,372
What m-m-makes

485
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:25,410
You th-think
I feel tense?

486
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:34,885
I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately.

487
00:52:34,919 --> 00:52:37,588
My mm-mother's
not feeling well.

488
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:40,491
I'm sorry to hear that.

489
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:42,293
It's nothing serious,
I hope.

490
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:46,364
No, it's just a...

491
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:47,932
Ff-fistula.

492
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,267
Hmm.

493
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,168
Yeah.

494
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:56,173
I got you
something today.

495
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,557
Ta-da!

496
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,661
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

497
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,603
I really better go.

498
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,507
My mother.

499
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,709
Okay.

500
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:33,478
Don't be a stranger.

501
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,039
(Door unlocks)

502
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:48,686
Shit.

503
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:14,379
Under that can...

504
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:17,047
Is the meanest,
filthiest, ugliest rat

505
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:19,517
You ever laid
your eyes on.

506
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:22,186
Took a year off my life
just trying to catch it.

507
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,188
Sent poor Vic
in for stitches

508
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:26,957
Trying to get it
with a hammer.

509
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:29,059
God only knows
how it got in.

510
00:55:30,728 --> 00:55:32,663
What do you want
m-m-me to...

511
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:34,164
Do what you want!

512
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,200
Just get it the hell
out of here.

513
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:37,968
I caught it,
for Christ's sakes.

514
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:46,544
Careful.

515
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:48,579
Careful,
he's gonna get out.

516
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:50,781
Do you wanna do this?

517
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:53,884
He'll take your hand right off
if you give him half a chance.

518
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:10,468
(Speaking Spanish)

519
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:13,971
Waiter:
No, senorita.

520
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,973
- Y Los frijoles?
- Completely vegetarian.

521
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,075
Good. I'll have that.

522
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:20,010
And a Margarita,
no salt.

523
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:23,047
Gracias.

524
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,621
Can I ask you something?

525
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:31,656
Of course.

526
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:36,126
I was just wondering,

527
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,730
Don't you ever feel
like eating meat?

528
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:42,166
Not really, no.

529
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,469
There isn't any time
when a piece of meat

530
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,871
Just looks
a little appetizing?

531
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,139
No.

532
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:51,141
You mean there's
n-n-nothing,

533
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:54,111
Not anything about
a hamburger,

534
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:57,247
That appeals to you
in any way, at any time?

535
00:56:57,482 --> 00:56:58,415
Never.

536
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:02,620
Then you must be lying.

537
00:57:02,687 --> 00:57:05,022
What?

538
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,792
Suppose you were
starving.

539
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,660
Is there something wrong?

540
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:12,763
Suppose you were starving
and there was nothing else
to eat.

541
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:14,765
Why do you ask me
these questions?

542
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,034
If you were starving
and there was nothing else
to eat,

543
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,068
And you knew you would die
if you didn't eat it.

544
00:57:18,135 --> 00:57:19,637
No.

545
00:57:19,704 --> 00:57:23,307
You mean to tell me
you'd rather give your life

546
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:26,944
For a cow, a dead cow?

547
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:30,047
Francis, why don't you
just tell me what's
bothering you?

548
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,149
What makes you think
there's anything bothering me?

549
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,218
Because I feel like
you're striking out at me.

550
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,754
Just because I question
whether or not

551
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,223
You'd really rather die
than eat a hamburger?

552
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,225
I think I know
how I feel.

553
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,028
I'm not so sure
you do.

554
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:47,064
I'm not so sure anyone
who calls themselves
a vegetarian

555
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:49,299
Really knows how they feel.

556
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:52,069
Deep down, I think
they're the most carnivorous
of us all.

557
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,304
They just deny it harder.

558
00:57:54,539 --> 00:57:56,841
They're the ones who feel
like they have to parade

559
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:58,843
Their smug,
self-righteous,

560
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,811
Sanctimonious,
holier-than-thou attitude

561
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:02,179
Before the entire world

562
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:05,349
Every day of the pathetic
miserable shams

563
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:07,685
They call lives.

564
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,188
Excuse me.

565
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:12,957
I don't feel well.

566
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:27,504
I'm sorry I made
such a scene.

567
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:30,875
It's something
that's happened
all my life.

568
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:35,045
The seizures come so rarely
I forget all about them.

569
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:41,619
Sorry if it was
because of me.

570
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,756
Is everything okay
between us?

571
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:47,658
Yeah.

572
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:50,194
Okay.

573
00:58:51,596 --> 00:58:53,030
I'm so tired.

574
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:59,737
Can you give me
an order of, uh...

575
00:58:59,804 --> 00:59:03,273
Plah pa muk,

576
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:05,743
And some of
that spicy, uh,

577
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,913
Nam prik pow.

578
00:59:10,815 --> 00:59:13,150
Yeah, whatever.

579
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,885
And, uh...

580
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:17,888
Oh, give me
an order
of that...

581
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:20,024
Yum moo Yang.

582
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:22,159
(Sal laughs)

583
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,028
And can, uh...

584
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:26,664
Yeah...

585
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:27,765
Lick my dong?

586
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,634
(Laughing)

587
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:32,970
- Yeah, lick my dong.
- (Laughing continues)

588
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:36,573
Uh, in orange sauce?

589
00:59:38,843 --> 00:59:41,045
Is that right? Yeah?

590
00:59:41,111 --> 00:59:44,348
Why don't you kiss
my ass, fuckface!

591
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:48,152
Oh, alright.
Well, fuck you, too!

592
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:50,187
Yeah, fuck you!

593
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,792
(Both laughing hysterically)

594
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:56,360
Fuck you, fuck you,
fuck you!

595
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:08,773
Francis,
how about a drink?

596
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:10,174
No.

597
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:12,209
Don't be
such a tightass.

598
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:14,211
I think
you'd better leave.

599
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:16,213
Come on, just have a little
drink. I'll pour you one.

600
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,817
I said I think you
b-b-better leave.

601
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:23,721
- Wait a minute
- why don't you have a drink?

602
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:25,823
Are you deaf?

603
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:26,824
No.

604
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:28,826
Oh, for Christ's sake

605
01:00:28,893 --> 01:00:31,361
Then get out!

606
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,363
We're just having
a little party.

607
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,398
I mean, really.

608
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,167
Well, it's over now.

609
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,073
I thought we were,
you know, buddies.

610
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:45,409
- What?
- I thought we were
friends, you and me.

611
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,344
In that case,

612
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:50,280
M-m-maybe you can tell me
what you've been doing

613
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:52,850
In there for
the last six weeks.

614
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:54,118
Where?

615
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:56,120
- The bathroom.
- The bathroom?

616
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:57,988
That's complicated,
you know.

617
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:00,958
It's a leaky pipe!

618
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,260
How complicated is that?

619
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,730
Well, if you want,
I'll show you.

620
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:07,164
Get out!

621
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:12,036
- Wait a minute, I mean...
- I said, get out!

622
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:23,113
You don't have to show Vic
the writing on the wall.

623
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:25,082
He can see it.

624
01:01:28,986 --> 01:01:30,955
(Hollers)
Hey!

625
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:37,027
You don't say much about that
girlie friend of yours, do you?

626
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:39,363
I'm beginning to wonder
if she really exists.

627
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:45,469
You gotta be a regular
chip off the old block.

628
01:03:15,592 --> 01:03:17,394
(Telephone rings)

629
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:23,167
Hello.

630
01:03:23,233 --> 01:03:24,935
Gloria:
Francis?

631
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,137
Hi.

632
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:31,308
Hi. What are you doing?

633
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:35,012
Nn-nothing much.

634
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:37,147
I thought if you weren't
doing anything

635
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:40,885
Maybe you can come over
for dinner.

636
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:43,053
- I don't think so.
- Oh.

637
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,125
My mm-mother,

638
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,827
She's not feeling well.

639
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,298
I'm sorry.
Is she okay?

640
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,566
Yeah. Fine.

641
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,937
It's just those, uh...

642
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:02,172
Those fistulas,
they're pretty tricky.

643
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,010
What exactly is
a fistula?

644
01:04:06,043 --> 01:04:09,113
It's a kind of
ho-hole.

645
01:04:10,915 --> 01:04:12,482
A kind of infected hole.

646
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,585
Can I do anything to help?

647
01:04:16,453 --> 01:04:17,621
No.

648
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:20,958
Well, call me when you can.

649
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:24,561
- Okay.
- Goodnight.

650
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:25,529
Gg-goodnight.

651
01:05:48,512 --> 01:05:49,479
Hi there.

652
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,284
(Shaking doorknob)

653
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:56,720
I say, hello?

654
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:03,327
Hi.

655
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:04,361
Hi.

656
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:09,066
Are you a friend
of Gloria's?

657
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:11,435
Yeah.

658
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:13,503
She wanted me to pick
something up for her.

659
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,108
Looks like you got
the wrong key, mate.

660
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,311
I've had some trouble
around here lately.

661
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:22,579
Seems that, uh,

662
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:25,182
Former tenants,
what they do is come back,

663
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:27,317
Use their old keys
and help themselves.

664
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:29,353
Pretty cheeky, eh?

665
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,289
Yeah.

666
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:34,358
So I've had to change
all the locks.

667
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:36,526
It's funny she didn't
tell you about that.

668
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,464
I guess she must've forgot.

669
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:41,731
Yeah.

670
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:43,733
Yeah, she must have.

671
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,403
Well, thanks.

672
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:49,206
Here, just a minute!

673
01:06:49,273 --> 01:06:50,107
Hey!

674
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:51,108
Hey!

675
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:53,277
(Coughs)

676
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:01,585
Must be difficult
going on

677
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,753
When you're not
feeling yourself.

678
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,524
On stage I banish reality
through an act of sheer will.

679
01:07:09,293 --> 01:07:11,761
Marilyn is performing
in her own one person show.

680
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,364
What is it called
again?

681
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:16,400
"Ich bin Marilyn,"

682
01:07:16,466 --> 01:07:20,104
Based on the writings
of the great Latin
American surrealist,

683
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:21,138
Dieter ulbricht.

684
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:25,275
He doesn't sound
Latin American.

685
01:07:25,342 --> 01:07:27,344
But he's Argentine,
of course.

686
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:28,878
A great artist.

687
01:07:29,113 --> 01:07:30,380
And a tremendous azhole.

688
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:31,648
A what?

689
01:07:31,681 --> 01:07:33,683
An azhole, an azhole.

690
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,784
What's that?

691
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:35,919
A shithead.

692
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:39,156
Oh, asshole.

693
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:40,390
Of course.

694
01:07:42,326 --> 01:07:47,397
After the violent convergence
of motherhead and fatherwomb,

695
01:07:47,431 --> 01:07:49,266
I emerge naked

696
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:53,670
Into the stark solitude
of human existence

697
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:55,639
Only to be
finally devoured

698
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:59,676
By a swarm of
carnivorous butterflies,

699
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:02,546
Who spread everywhere

700
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,481
Their message
of eternal light and Booty.

701
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:09,186
I'm sorry, what?

702
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:11,555
Booty. Booty.

703
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:13,390
Oh, beauty.

704
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,691
Of course.

705
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:34,311
Still hungry?

706
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:36,713
Have some of that.

707
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,316
It's yellow squash
stuffed with red pepper.

708
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:41,618
I made it last night.

709
01:08:41,685 --> 01:08:43,653
Want me to warm it up
for you?

710
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:47,957
I'd better be
getting back.

711
01:08:48,192 --> 01:08:49,726
But it's so early.

712
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,761
I know.
My mm-mother...

713
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:54,598
How is the fistula?

714
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:58,368
Better.
Still bad, but better.

715
01:08:59,403 --> 01:09:01,538
(Filing)

716
01:09:07,911 --> 01:09:09,413
(Telephone rings)

717
01:09:11,415 --> 01:09:13,483
Hello.

718
01:09:13,517 --> 01:09:15,352
Gloria:
Hi.

719
01:09:15,419 --> 01:09:16,753
Hi.

720
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,756
I'd like to see you.

721
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:21,525
I can't.

722
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:25,762
My mother is still
pretty sick.

723
01:09:25,795 --> 01:09:28,332
Looks like that
f-f-fistula

724
01:09:28,365 --> 01:09:30,300
Has grown a little.

725
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:33,270
- Okay.
- Yeah.

726
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:35,905
So I don't think
it's such a good idea.

727
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,242
Okay.

728
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:41,945
- Francis?
- Yeah?

729
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:44,781
Is everything okay?

730
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:46,716
Everything's fine.

731
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:50,654
I guess I've...

732
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,456
I've been a little
preoccupied.

733
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:58,795
(Coughing)

734
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,210
(Rock music blaring)

735
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:21,818
Yes, sir?

736
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:26,290
I want to develop these.

737
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:27,991
Okay.

738
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,994
- The name?
- Jones.

739
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:35,599
One set or two?

740
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,334
One.

741
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:41,705
Matte or glossy?

742
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:43,340
I don't care.

743
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,344
Daytime phone.

744
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:49,746
Daytime phone.

745
01:10:49,813 --> 01:10:51,515
Sir? Mr. Jones?

746
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:35,291
(Festive talking)

747
01:12:09,526 --> 01:12:11,528
(Knocking)

748
01:12:14,498 --> 01:12:16,099
May I help you?

749
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,539
Francis?

750
01:12:22,606 --> 01:12:25,575
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

751
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:27,811
What's the matter?
I'll show you what!

752
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:29,813
There's absolutely
no hostility here.

753
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:30,947
Get back!

754
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,949
No hostility, right?

755
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:34,951
I said, get back!

756
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:38,955
You hypocrites!

757
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:41,425
Just who do think
you're fooling?

758
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:43,560
Nn-not me,
that's for sure.

759
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:44,894
Nn-not me!

760
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,831
- Francis.
- Stay back!

761
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:49,699
I know all about...

762
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:52,536
I know all about
your little s-s-secret.

763
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:54,538
You didn't bother
inviting me

764
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:56,540
To this party, did you?

765
01:12:56,573 --> 01:12:58,575
You won't go anywhere
because of your mother.

766
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:00,243
Oh, right. Right.

767
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,245
Maybe there's
another reason.

768
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:04,080
Maybe it's because
you were afraid
I'd discover

769
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:06,049
Your little secret.

770
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:08,718
Some vegetarian you are.

771
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:19,929
- What's this?
- Bamati herb rolls.

772
01:13:21,164 --> 01:13:23,399
- And this?
- Tabouli salad.

773
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,001
And this?

774
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:26,503
Ummm...

775
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:28,672
Eggless artichoke
frittata.

776
01:13:34,811 --> 01:13:36,480
(Panting)

777
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:38,147
Woman:
Oh, my God!

778
01:13:41,885 --> 01:13:44,020
Look at what you've done.

779
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:46,022
Woman:
Are you happy now?

780
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:47,724
I hope you're proud
of yourself.

781
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,158
Nice work, pal.

782
01:14:02,806 --> 01:14:04,708
(Startled gasps)

783
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:24,594
(Telephone rings)

784
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:35,004
(Continues to ring)

785
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:51,855
(Knocking)

786
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:53,723
Keep your shirt on

787
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:56,225
For the bleeding sake
of sweet Jesus Christ
in heaven!

788
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:09,105
Do you know that
one of these days...

789
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:13,109
The sun is gonna
explode?

790
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:15,244
Gonna go up like a,

791
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:18,181
A frickin' dime store
firecracker.

792
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:21,184
It's gonna go supernova.

793
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,990
Fucking gonna fry us
to kingdom come.

794
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,258
Who gives
a tinker's toot?

795
01:15:30,927 --> 01:15:32,862
I'll be long dead.

796
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:42,005
What if you're
reincarnated?

797
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:44,240
You know, like as a goat
or something?

798
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,942
Hey...

799
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,981
If I'm reincarnated,

800
01:15:52,015 --> 01:15:54,818
I ain't coming back
as an old goat.

801
01:15:57,754 --> 01:16:00,289
I guess not.

802
01:16:00,323 --> 01:16:03,326
You're about
as far from a goat
as I can imagine.

803
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,832
That's right, ma'am.

804
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,202
I can't imagine
you as a goat.

805
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:19,809
Not unless
I was a he-goat,

806
01:16:19,876 --> 01:16:21,811
And you were
the prettiest
little goat

807
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:23,780
In the whole
fucking herd.

808
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,717
(Wheezing laugh)

809
01:16:29,653 --> 01:16:30,920
Hey!

810
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:35,859
(Hollers)
Ahh! Fuck!

811
01:16:38,695 --> 01:16:41,364
You little fucking
cunt bitch!

812
01:16:58,815 --> 01:17:00,149
(Groaning)

813
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:23,907
(Grunting)

814
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:54,137
Who...

815
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,538
Are you...

816
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:58,341
Calling...
A cunt?

817
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,277
(Telephone rings)

818
01:19:18,454 --> 01:19:20,023
Francis?

819
01:19:23,226 --> 01:19:26,329
Francis, I wish
you'd talk to me.

820
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:28,998
I wish you would try
and communicate.

821
01:19:31,968 --> 01:19:33,937
I'm not sure
what's happening to you.

822
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:35,371
But I'm afraid.

823
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,406
I'm afraid for you.

824
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:40,776
I want to help you.

825
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:43,847
If you'd only let me.

826
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:48,051
I love you.

827
01:19:53,857 --> 01:19:56,159
(Hangs up)

828
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:05,534
(Knocking)

829
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:11,875
Listen, Francis,

830
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:15,044
Something stinks to high heaven
in this place.

831
01:20:15,111 --> 01:20:16,579
I can't smell anything.

832
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,414
You can't smell that?
(Sniffs)

833
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,949
That stink?

834
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:23,819
Like something died.

835
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:27,056
Jesus Christ,
I think I'm gonna vomit.

836
01:20:28,524 --> 01:20:31,895
It kind of smells like
it's coming from up here.

837
01:20:31,961 --> 01:20:33,829
Well, I'll look around.

838
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:37,967
(Gagging)

839
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:44,307
Sal:
Smells like a hog farm.

840
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,375
What are we gonna do,
Francis?

841
01:20:49,112 --> 01:20:51,047
What are we gonna do?

842
01:20:51,114 --> 01:20:53,082
I don't know.

843
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:56,619
Well, we gotta do something.

844
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:01,357
Maybe we should call
the police.

845
01:21:01,424 --> 01:21:04,060
No, no, no, no!

846
01:21:04,093 --> 01:21:05,995
Then what?

847
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:10,166
Then what?

848
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:11,467
Francis...

849
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,473
I didn't kill him.

850
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:20,543
What?

851
01:21:21,577 --> 01:21:24,713
What did you say?

852
01:21:24,948 --> 01:21:27,216
It was God's will.

853
01:21:27,283 --> 01:21:29,885
God's will?

854
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:33,522
God's will?

855
01:21:36,592 --> 01:21:39,228
Is that what it was?

856
01:21:39,262 --> 01:21:42,265
And just what do you think
God's will is, sal?

857
01:21:43,666 --> 01:21:46,002
I'll tell you what it is.

858
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:49,472
He wants to make us pay,
just like he made daddy pay.

859
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:50,673
That's God's will.

860
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:53,342
No, no, no.

861
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:55,644
Whom he would destroy,
he first makes mad.

862
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:57,246
No!

863
01:21:57,313 --> 01:22:00,116
Do you think it matters
how much we pray?

864
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:02,118
Do you think
it matters how much

865
01:22:02,185 --> 01:22:04,620
We get down
on our knees and beg?

866
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:06,655
No!
God loves us.

867
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:09,358
- No, he doesn't!
- Yes, he does!

868
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:11,494
He's
a spiteful, mean,

869
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:13,662
Vengeful f-f-fucker!

870
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:16,665
And he never,
ever, ever forgets!

871
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:19,368
Oh, boy.

872
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:22,405
Oh, boy, will you ever
pay for this!

873
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:24,273
I'm ashamed
to call you my son!

874
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:25,408
I'm not your son!

875
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,276
You can deny it
all you want.

876
01:22:27,343 --> 01:22:28,677
Mama's dead, sal.
She's dead!

877
01:22:28,711 --> 01:22:31,280
No! No, no!

878
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:34,450
You loved mama, sal.
You loved mama more
than anything.

879
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:36,785
But God took her,
didn't he?

880
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:38,154
- Didn't he?
- Daddy took her!

881
01:22:38,221 --> 01:22:40,289
He made daddy take her!

882
01:22:40,323 --> 01:22:41,690
Daddy was bad.

883
01:22:41,724 --> 01:22:45,061
No, he was sick!
God made him sick!

884
01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:47,463
- Because daddy was bad!
- He wasn't bad!

885
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:51,100
Then why did God
make him sick?

886
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:53,736
Why?

887
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:58,974
Who knows why?
Who knows why he decided
to ruin our lives?

888
01:23:03,446 --> 01:23:05,648
But you know what
I say to that, sal?

889
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,984
You know what I say?

890
01:23:11,554 --> 01:23:14,990
I say God damn him.

891
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:17,826
God damn God.

892
01:23:18,061 --> 01:23:21,464
Damn the father,
damn the son.

893
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:24,233
No!
God damn the holy
fucking ghost!

894
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,469
Fuck God, sal!

895
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,704
Fuck God, sal!

896
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:31,207
Fuck God, sal!
Fuck him!

897
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,508
Fuck him!

898
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:34,510
Something's lost
that can't be found.

899
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:36,345
Please, Saint Anthony,
look around.

900
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:38,481
Saint Anthony.

901
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:40,516
Something's lost
that can't be found.

902
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,285
Oh, please, Saint Anthony,
look around.

903
01:24:16,519 --> 01:24:18,587
(Coughing)

904
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,460
(Bell sounds)

905
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,654
(Clicking through channels)

906
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:50,379
Sal:
Hey, buddy boy!

907
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:55,551
Who ever thought
it would come to this?

908
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:58,287
Huh?

909
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:02,491
Who would've guessed it?

910
01:26:04,627 --> 01:26:05,761
Would you tell me that?

911
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:07,430
Huh?

912
01:26:09,532 --> 01:26:12,235
What did we do
to deserve this?

913
01:26:16,405 --> 01:26:17,940
We aren't bad.

914
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,577
Are we?

915
01:26:23,579 --> 01:26:26,181
We didn't do anything
to anybody.

916
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:29,318
Did we?

917
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:33,589
(Shouts)
Did we?

918
01:26:42,798 --> 01:26:46,269
Something's lost
that can't be found.

919
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:50,373
Please, Saint Anthony...

920
01:26:50,406 --> 01:26:52,341
Look around.

921
01:26:56,879 --> 01:27:00,215
Something's lost
that can't be found.

922
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:04,353
Please, Saint Anthony,
look around.

923
01:27:06,289 --> 01:27:08,691
Something's lost
that can't be found.

924
01:27:08,757 --> 01:27:11,427
Please, Saint Anthony,
look around.

925
01:27:11,494 --> 01:27:13,696
(Sobbing)
Something's lost
that can't be found.

926
01:27:13,762 --> 01:27:16,332
Please, Saint Anthony,
look around.

927
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,701
Something's lost
that can't be found.

928
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:21,103
Oh, please, Saint Anthony,
look around.

929
01:27:21,337 --> 01:27:23,439
(Sobbing hysterically)

930
01:27:23,472 --> 01:27:27,676
We've looked up high,
we've looked way down.

931
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:30,379
I've looked all over
this lousy town.

932
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:31,500
Excuse me.

933
01:29:40,909 --> 01:29:42,445
Excuse me.

934
01:31:01,156 --> 01:31:03,959
(Rock music playing)

935
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,972
(Faint chatting)

936
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,565
Guests:
Ooh! Wow!

937
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:46,501
- That's nice!
- That's just gorgeous!

938
01:33:43,318 --> 01:33:46,221
(Silence)

939
01:35:34,129 --> 01:35:35,864
Noooo!

940
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:02,157
Hi.

941
01:36:03,325 --> 01:36:05,994
Where is he?

942
01:36:06,061 --> 01:36:08,030
- What are you talking about?
- Get inside.

943
01:36:09,832 --> 01:36:11,033
Nn-now!

944
01:36:17,305 --> 01:36:19,441
- Where is he?
- Who?

945
01:36:33,255 --> 01:36:35,223
You must've
finished him off

946
01:36:35,257 --> 01:36:36,424
P-p-pretty fast.

947
01:36:36,491 --> 01:36:38,393
What are you
talking about?

948
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,162
- Where did you put him?
- Who?

949
01:36:40,228 --> 01:36:41,864
Him!

950
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:43,565
Francis, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

951
01:36:46,601 --> 01:36:48,536
In the kitchen.

952
01:36:48,603 --> 01:36:50,205
Nn-now!

953
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:35,150
Francis, you're sick.
You need help.

954
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:37,285
Oh, I'm sick.
I'm the sick one.

955
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:38,586
That's good.

956
01:37:38,653 --> 01:37:40,956
At least I don't
eat people.

957
01:37:41,023 --> 01:37:42,524
Where have you gotten
these ideas?

958
01:37:44,459 --> 01:37:45,727
I've ss-seen it!

959
01:37:45,961 --> 01:37:48,263
There, in the window!

960
01:37:52,334 --> 01:37:55,003
- You've been watching me?
- Yes!

961
01:37:56,138 --> 01:37:58,373
You didn't bet on that,
did you?

962
01:38:00,275 --> 01:38:01,609
No.

963
01:38:07,649 --> 01:38:09,084
You must think I'm

964
01:38:09,117 --> 01:38:11,353
P-p-pretty stupid
to actually believe

965
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:13,121
You could've
cared about me.

966
01:38:26,368 --> 01:38:28,003
(Panting)

967
01:39:05,307 --> 01:39:07,309
I love you, Francis.

968
01:39:10,012 --> 01:39:11,646
I know you don't
believe that.

969
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,581
I know you never have.

970
01:39:13,648 --> 01:39:16,084
But I do,
and I always will.

971
01:39:18,086 --> 01:39:20,422
I've tried to be
as honest with you
as I can.

972
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:24,526
It's been hard,
you know, because,

973
01:39:24,559 --> 01:39:26,461
I care what
you think of me.

974
01:39:26,528 --> 01:39:28,396
But I've tried.

975
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:30,398
And I just hope,

976
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:33,168
I just hope you
can believe that.

977
01:39:33,201 --> 01:39:35,237
It's so hard
to see you like this.

978
01:39:58,293 --> 01:40:00,462
He wants to make me crazy.

979
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:01,996
Who does?

980
01:40:05,567 --> 01:40:07,069
God.

981
01:40:13,141 --> 01:40:14,542
(Sniffs)
It's true.

982
01:40:16,478 --> 01:40:19,114
I've watched you.

983
01:40:22,484 --> 01:40:24,419
But what I saw
wasn't real...

984
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:32,560
Because he hates me.

985
01:40:37,299 --> 01:40:39,033
He shows me things.

986
01:40:40,135 --> 01:40:42,036
Things that aren't real.

987
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,442
Bad things.

988
01:40:52,514 --> 01:40:54,316
But I don't care.

989
01:40:57,652 --> 01:40:59,821
Because if God
doesn't love me...

990
01:41:03,158 --> 01:41:06,528
At least I know
that y-y...

991
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:08,530
You do.
