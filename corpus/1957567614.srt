177
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,458
That was terrible.

178
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,127
That was kinda terrible.

179
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,295
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

180
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,547
Have a good night.

181
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,423
(CHUCKLES) Okay. You, too.

182
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,222
You know what? Fuck it.

183
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,142
I'm already ruining this,
so I'm just gonna keep goin'.

184
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,978
Do you think
I could have your number?

185
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,605
- Oh.
- It's really just so I have a story

186
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,357
for my sister and my niece
when I see them.

187
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,651
Because I think we're
gonna talk about the grapes.

188
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,319
Oh, of course. Yeah.

189
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,405
Then I can tell them
that I met someone else

190
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,657
who feels the same way.

191
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,242
Sure. Makes sense, yeah.

192
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,035
Okay.

193
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,166
We can meet here next week
to talk about the broccoli if you want.

194
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,667
(CHUCKLES) Sounds good.

195
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,837
Oh.

196
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,381
- Mist.
- Rain forest.

(NOA CHUCKLES)

198
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,093
Always good to have a little mist, Noa.

199
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,636
- Yes, mystery.
- Yeah.

200
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,305
I'm Steve.

201
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,057
- It's nice to meet you.
- You, too.

202
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,768
I'm not gonna text you,
but I'll really want to.

203
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,938
Good night.

204
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,148
Good night.

NOA: <i>Yeah.</i>

206

NOA: <i>Yeah.</i>

208
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,699

NOA: <i>Yes.</i>

telling me today?</i>

When you think you had a friend.

212
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,164
No, I just think it was weird,
you know? He was...

213
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,251
He was cute and funny and...

214
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,336
Mmm. Okay.

215
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,631
I didn't think people met people
in real life anymore, you know?

216
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,091
He's probably married.
(LAUGHS)

217
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,135
Thank you for that.
Yes, he's probably married.

218
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,386
Probably.

219
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,347
Like, I'm already thinking
about the fact

220
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,057
- he hasn't texted.
- Mmm.

221
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,768
That's one of the things
I love about dating women.

222
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,647
Less games, more emotional dependence,
you know?

223
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,523
(BOTH LAUGH)

224
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,025
So don't play the games,

225
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,402
just be you straight out the gate.
Fuck it.

226
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,487
Maybe.

227
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,073
Hey, do you want to come over later?

228
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,492
- I could use some emotional dependence.
- Aww.

229
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,328
Well, my emotional dependence
ain't cheap, boo.

230
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,038
- Let me tell you.
- (LAUGHS)

231
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,101
- Hi.
- STEVE: Hey!

232
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,937
How you doin'?

233
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,690
- Good, thanks. How are you?
- Good. Good.

234
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,692
This place is really nice.

235
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,568
- Yeah.
- The bears are, you know...

236
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,572
Yeah. It's like the perfect amount
of, you know, grimy, but hip.

237
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,657
Exactly.

238
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,619
- You guys know what you want?
- NOA: Hi. Um...

239
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:11,332
Can I get a Manhattan with, like,
as many cherries as you can spare, please?

240
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,960
- Cherries. I like that.
- I love cherries.

241
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,837
Yeah. I'll do
one more of these, thank you.

00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,932
Noa.

00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,058
Um...

250
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,687
All right, so, uh...
Here come the dumb questions.

251
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,105
Where are you from?

252
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,025
Um, (CHUCKLES)
I'm from the East Coast originally,

253
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,151
- yeah.
- Nice.

254
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,402
What about you?

255
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,487
- I'm from Texas. Yeah.
- Oh. Cool.

256
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,864
What brought you out here?

257
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,490
My second residency.

258
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,492
- Oh! Residency.
- Yeah.

259
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,869
Are you a doc...

260
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,370
- A doctor?
- I'm a doctor. Yeah.

261
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,538
Oh! Wow!

262
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,041
- Yeah. Yeah. Um...
- That's impressive.

263
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:57,253
I just... I work
in reconstructive surgery.

264
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,797
You mean, um, plastic surgery.

265
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,382
- Yup. That's the one.
- Right.

266
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,884
- There's only one.
- Okay.

(BOTH LAUGH)

268
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,553
But it's not all nose jobs.

269

No, of course.
You got, you know...

270

- Boob jobs.
- Boob jobs.

271

But you know, once in a while

274
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,105
I get to help somebody,
which is nice though.

275
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,858
There was this kid
the other day who came in,

276
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,194
who had an accident
and he was badly burned.

277
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,988
So there's that, too.

278
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,490
I was just kidding. Sorry.

- Thank you.

- Wow. Yes.
- That do the trick?

00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,500
- 'Cause that's all we got.
- I'm sorry. That's...

STEVE: Perfect.

285
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,544
I only meant, like, a couple.
Thank you.

- (GLASSES CLINK)
- Cheers.

287
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,175
So, what about your family?

288
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,388
Uh... Well, I, um,
I don't have any siblings

289
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,015
and my dad died a while back, so...

290
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:55,061
I'm not sure where my mom is anymore
because we don't talk.

291
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,105
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

- What about your family?
- Oh...

294

My dad is in Texas
and my mom passed away, actually.

295
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,490
- Sorry.
- So... But it's...

296
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,409
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

297
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,078
Well, we have something
in common, I guess.

298
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,996
- Yeah, dead parents.
- Yeah.

299
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,123
