00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,631
<i>Translate, boy.</i>
<i>What did she say?</i>

2
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,007
<i>Could you say something into</i>
<i>the microphone?</i>

3
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,755
<i>One, two, three...</i>

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,672
MARCH 1952

5
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,916
MEXICO CITY
JULY 1955

6
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,759
Do what you want,
but don't mess with the Americans.

7
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,829
It's pretty simple.
All we have to do...

8
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,116
...is organize a coup.

9
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,592
What did Batista do? He led
a coup and took power in one day.

10
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,317
The main issue is to control power.
The rest is nonsense.

11
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,273
It's not about taking power,
but knowing what to do with it.

12
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,117
That's right.

13
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,436
That coup must be based
on principles.

14
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,515
Let's eat. Fidel is late.

15
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,870
Argentine!
Could you give me a hand?

16
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,715
It's not about making concessions
but establishing conditions.

17
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,471
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's about time!

18
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,837
Good evening.
Sorry I'm late.

19
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,037
This is Ernesto.

20
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,675
- The Argentine doctor.
- Pleased to meet you.

21
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,599
- My pleasure.
- Let's eat!

22
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,751
Twenty percent of all Cubans
are permanently unemployed.

23
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,194
1.6 percent of the landowners
control 46 percent of the land.

24
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,077
Half the population has no electricity.
Over half live in bohíos.

25
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,309
Sorry, what's a "bohío"?

26
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,518
What's a hovel in Argentina?

27
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,273
A shack.

28
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,400
37 percent can't read or write.

29
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,154
Infant mortality is through the roof.

30
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,192
What's more...

31
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,711
...while the thugs
of the dictatorship...

32
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,594
...gun down anyone
who speaks out...

33
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,713
...most corrupt officials...

34
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,793
...steal hundreds of millions of
dollars from the public treasury...

35
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,798
...and deposit it into
U.S. and European banks.

36
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,880
It's the same
in all Latin American countries.

37
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,877
In the last few years...

38
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,509
...the balance of payments
between the U.S. and Cuba...

39
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,717
...has been favorable to the U.S.
by one billion dollars.

40
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,039
What does this mean?

41
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,475
That this poor Caribbean island...

42
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,712
...is helping to support the economy

43
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,797
of the most developed country
in the world.

44
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,154
As Martí used to say,
if the U.S. takes Spain out of Cuba...

45
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,551
...then we would have to
take out the U.S.

46
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,079
Do you have a boat?

47
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,998
Money?

48
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,194
Not yet.

49
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,153
Fighters?

50
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,548
We've smuggled thirty into Mexico.
We'll get some more.

51
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,357
Do you think I'm crazy?

52
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,639
A little.

53
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,953
Well...

54
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,196
...some craziness is good.

55
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,355
<i>Fidel had extraordinary faith...</i>

56
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,551
<i>that once we left for Cuba,</i>

57
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,474
<i>we would make it there.</i>

58
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,115
<i>And that once we made it to Cuba,</i>
<i>we would fight.</i>

59
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,909
<i>And that in fighting,</i>

60
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,795
<i>we would win.</i>

61
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,110
<i>And so it was that</i>
<i>in November of 56</i>

62
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,994
<i>we left Mexico...</i>

63
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,918
<i>... in a leaky boat</i>

64
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,317
<i>with 82 men on board.</i>

65
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,314
<i>And of those 82,</i>

66
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,113
<i>only 12 would survive</i>
<i>to witness our victory.</i>

67
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,117
NEW YORK
DECEMBER 1964

68
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,315
Murderer! Assassin!

69
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,234
Get out of Cuba, Che! Murderer!

70
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,950
MARCH 1957
398 MILES FROM HAVANA

71
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,268
<i>Well, from this point forward,</i>
<i>we experienced ten bitter days.</i>

72
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,117
<i>The only way I could walk was</i>
<i>to hold myself up with the trees...</i>

73
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,479
<i>... or by leaning on my rifle butt.</i>

74
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,113
<i>As if that weren't enough,</i>
<i>I was traveling with a soldier...</i>

75
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,790
<i>... who panicked</i>
<i>every time my asthma</i>

76
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,514
<i>made me cough.</i>

77
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,038
Soldiers! Soldiers are coming!
There's a lot of them!

78
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,879
They're going to kill us!
We have to hide!

79
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,158
That's Epifanio's house!

80
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,393
Close the door.

81
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,712
Where's Fidel?

82
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,713
My name is Ernesto Guevara.
What's yours?

83
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,876
Jorge Sotús, why?

84
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,834
I have orders
from Fidel to command you...

85
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,715
...and your men,
and lead you to where he is.

86
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,828
Where are you from?

87
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,393
Argentina.

88
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,193
I don't trust anyone. I'm the
only one leading these troops.

89
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,475
Frank País said to deliver these men
to Fidel, personally.

90
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,840
Listen! We'll stop for five minutes.

91
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,198
Sit down, everyone.

92
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,472
Hey, what's going on?

93
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,315
- Fidel is coming!
- Go and tell the doctor.

94
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,599
- Stand up, come on!
- Fidel is coming.

95
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,952
Stand up.

96
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,550
Come on, up! Grab your rifle.

97
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,077
Finally!

98
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,712
Good to see you. Are you all right?

99
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,639
This is Epifanio.

100
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,194
- Raúl
- How are you?

101
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,713
Very good.

102
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,078
Camilo.

103
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,992
- How was your vacation?
- Vacation? What vacation?

104
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,473
Almeida.

105
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,273
Hello, Ramiro.

106
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,316
- Hi, Vilma.
- Good to see you.

107
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,468
Vilo.

108
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,873
- How are you, Che?
- Hello, Celia.

109
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,074
Thanks.

110
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,079
Listen.

111
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,113
Fidel wants to talk to you
about what happened with Sotús.

112
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,553
Let him speak.

113
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,673
If you say something,
it could sound defensive...

114
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,916
...and he's not going to like that.

115
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,994
I left you in charge
of the reinforcements.

116
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,799
I don't have anything
against Jorge Sotús...

117
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,718
...but how can you let someone
with no experience

118
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,194
take charge of the troops?

119
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,078
You still have this complex about
being foreign, and it's pointless.

120
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,032
You trained with us...

121
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,397
...you came in the boat with us,
you were wounded fighting with us.

122
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,392
You are as Cuban and revolutionary
as everyone here.

123
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,157
We are forming three columns.

124
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,113
Raúl will lead the first one.

125
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,150
Almeida will be
in charge of the second one.

126
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,231
And Jorge Sotús
will command the third one.

127
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,558
I did all my studies,
finished high school...

128
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,997
...then I worked as a mechanic
for two or three years.

129
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,950
I then delivered milk around the area.
Also worked as a boxer.

130
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,518
And in a circus, working as
a magician, among other things.

131
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,270
In a circus? How old are you?

132
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,276
Twenty.

133
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,156
- Who gave them to you?
- The one and only Celia Sánchez!

134
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,958
He looks like John Wayne.

135
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,358
- A cowboy from the wild west.
- The Little Cowboy.

136
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,878
That's it: "The Little Cowboy"!

137
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,875
The army keeps moving up
and down the road, Fidel.

138
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,311
It would be pretty easy
to hunt a couple of patrols.

139
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,353
- We must be patient.
- I agree, it would be easy to do.

140
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,949
- We could do it fast and safely.
- No, listen a second.

141
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,790
If we attack one of the trucks...

142
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,279
...then the army would say
it was a crash on the road.

143
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,116
But if we launch a full attack
on the Uvero barracks...

144
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,549
...it will be impossible
for them to deny our victory.

145
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:36,398
It will have a huge psychological
impact. Do you understand?

146
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,800
MAY 28, 1957

147
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,558
Sotús isn't in position...

148
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,714
...but he can't move because
it's getting light out.

149
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,270
I don't know about the others.
It's hard to see because...

150
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,716
Fuck, I missed!

151
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,790
Get down!

152
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,195
I have a saint watching over me!
He protects me from everything!

153
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,590
Are you okay?

154
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,031
- It's my arm and leg.
- Stay calm.

155
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,833
Don't fall asleep.

156
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,629
<i>In War and Peace,</i>

157
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,798
<i>Tolstoy remarks</i>
<i>that military science assumes...</i>

158
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,309
<i>... that bigger armies</i>
<i>with more men</i>

159
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,358
<i>wield greater force.</i>

160
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,633
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>only vaguely, do they recognize...</i>

161
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,551
<i>... that during military combat</i>
<i>the final strength of an army...</i>

162
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,554
<i>... is also its true physical capacity</i>
<i>multiplied by one unknown variable.</i>

163
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,639
<i>One unknown variable.</i>

164
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,588
<i>This variable is none other</i>
<i>that the spirit of the troops...</i>

165
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,679
<i>... measured as their greater</i>
<i>or lesser desire to fight</i>

166
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,438
<i>and confront danger.</i>

167
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,075
<i>Men with the desire to fight</i>

168
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,989
<i>who also understand</i>
<i>why they are fighting...</i>

00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,509
<i>... and so they will win.</i>

176
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,269
Light this up! Come on!

177
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,277
What are we going to do, now?

178
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,589
Take the barracks.

179
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,553
Come on!

180
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,275
Take this, motherfuckers!

181
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,155
<i>From them on,</i>

182
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,399
<i>Batista began shutting down</i>
<i>his Sierra Maestra barracks.</i>

183
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,789
<i>Fidel was right.</i>

184
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,670
<i>It was exactly</i>
<i>as José Martí said...</i>

185
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,036
<i>... whoever takes</i>
<i>the Sierra Maestra,</i>

186
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,719
<i>takes Cuba.</i>

187
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,714
On our side, six comrades are dead
and 17 are wounded.

188
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,831
Of the seventeen, six can't walk.

189
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,994
- How is Almeida?
- He's fine. He's being treated.

190
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,394
Get the prisoners.
They're coming with us.

191
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,070
Excuse me, doctor. I have no
experience in this kind of situation.

192
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,756
There's a man
over there who is choking.

193
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,516
Okay, guys, we got to get out of
here. Come on, they're coming.

194
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,034
Let's go, guys.

195
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,639
Leave that.

196
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,152
You're okay. Help him.

197
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,595
Che, we have to leave right now.

198
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,314
Hey, shithead. Leave that.

199
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,477
We have to go! Come on!

200
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,396
Israel Pardo's farm is not far.

201
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,434
- Ernesto can take the wounded there.
- No.

202
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,557
When they recover...

203
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,876
...we can meet up with you later.

204
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,231
That could be very dangerous.

205
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,108
They're going to flood
this area with troops now.

206
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,111
We don't have a choice.

207
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,671
Let's think about it.

208
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,680
Anyway, give him the best weapons.

209
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,597
<i>A real revolutionary goes</i>
<i>where he's needed,</i>

210
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,597
<i>it may not be direct combat.</i>

211
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,155
<i>Sometimes it's about doing</i>
<i>others task...</i>

212
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,035
<i>... finding food,</i>

213
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,916
<i>dressing wounds,</i>
<i>carrying comrades for miles...</i>

214
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,791
<i>... and then,</i>

215
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,195
<i>taking care of them until</i>
<i>they can take care of themselves.</i>

216
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,674
<i>This is what it means.</i>

217
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,950
I always knew
why I was fighting...

218
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,238
<i>But I can tell you...</i>

219
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,750
<i>... that it was during</i>
<i>the March of the Wounded</i>

220
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,678
<i>in June of 1957...</i>

221
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,874
<i>... that I became the fighter</i>
<i>I am today.</i>

222
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,231
<i>And once that happens,</i>
<i>it leaves you only one path.</i>

223
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,951
<i>I don't have any plans to retire.</i>

224
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,393
It's infected.

225
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,389
We'll have to leave it uncovered.

226
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,470
I have to walk with my ass naked?

227
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,272
Fuck!

228
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,316
(Vilo smells something.)

229
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,874
<i>Let's pick some</i>
<i>guavas before going back.</i>

230
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,919
Stop there, buddy.

231
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,839
What are you two doing here?

232
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,871
- We're from here.
- What's your name?

233
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,793
- Israel.
- Israel what?

234
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,429
Israel Pardo.

235
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,470
- What's his name?
- He's my brother, Guile.

236
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,113
- Ernesto Guevara.
- Did we scare you?

237
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,475
Guile.

238
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,997
Good, man, good.

239
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,998
We have to take him to a hospital.

240
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,038
Give me a swig.

241
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,074
Can we trust anyone
to take him out of here?

242
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,714
Difficult.

243
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,912
Soldiers tell people that the rebels
kill them and steal their food.

244
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,154
My mother is from here
and my father came from Haiti.

245
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,237
When he met my mother...

246
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,310
...we moved to a farm that belonged
to Juanito Echevarría.

247
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,837
He gave us a piece
of land to grow coffee.

248
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,517
But we had to clear it
and plant the seeds.

249
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,074
And we had to give
him a third of our crop.

250
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,276
And one day Juanito
decided to kick us out.

251
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,154
When my father knew
he had to leave...

252
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,552
...he stood in front
of Juanito Echevarría and said:

253
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,473
"I'll leave if you want,
but you have to pay...

254
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,754
...you have to pay me for
the four years that I worked here."

255
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,349
Do you know

256
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,630
what Juanito Echevarría
paid us for four years of work?

257
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,159
One hundred pesos.

258
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,150
My old man got
one hundred pesos for four years.

259
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,149
Be careful.

260
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,356
Okay.

261
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,554
This is the bullet
I removed from your body.

262
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,355
You're a champ.

263
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,109
- I'm going to get better now.
- Yes.

264
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,750
Maybe a little powder.

265
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,396
<i>... and from that comes...</i>

266
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,909
If I don't work, I don't eat.
And you are on welfare.

267
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,116
Go back to work in Cuba.

268
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,718
What's the point of the U.N. if our
fate is determined by the O.A. S...

269
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,158
...an organization that expelled us
and to which we no longer have ties?

270
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,795
Excuse me, Comandante.
Will you need me tonight?

271
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,749
Little boy, no one is so necessary,
or indispensable in this life.

272
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,674
Don't go thinking
that you are indispensable.

273
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,309
Go, do what you need to do.

274
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,716
I am going
to give you a little checkup...

275
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,911
...beginning with your ears.

276
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,917
Is that okay?

277
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,713
Too much work
and not enough to eat.

278
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,709
Maria, try to eat meat
whenever you can.

279
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,392
- Alright?
- Thanks, doctor.

280
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,756
- Let's go, Laura.
- Goodbye.

281
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,308
Mommy, that guy's a liar.
He says the same thing to everyone.

282
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,195
- Where does it hurt?
- Nothing really hurts.

283
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,916
I just came to see you because
I've never seen a doctor before.

284
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,397
Well, you've seen one now.
I'm here for you.

285
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,755
Excuse me.

286
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,991
Can I have your canteen,
so I can fill it?

287
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,473
Thank you, Guile.

288
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,918
Listen, Doctor.

289
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,518
I want to go with you all.

290
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,835
First you have to
learn to read and write, man.

291
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,149
I can learn.

292
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,468
Very good, Guile.

293
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,957
But I still can't take you because
I don't have a gun to give you.

294
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,991
But I don't care, I want to help.

295
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,037
We need your help here.

296
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,156
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

297
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,750
- Where do you come from?
- From Bayamo.

298
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,359
All of you?

299
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,276
If you are armed, you can stay.

300
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,511
If you're not,
you have to leave right now.

301
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,918
Esteban, come here.

302
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,916
Man, didn't I tell you to only
bring men with weapons?

303
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,519
If we're attacked, how the hell
are they going to defend themselves?

304
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,872
Have you been drinking?

305
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,513
No.

306
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,031
Where did you get that from?

307
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,278
I found it.

308
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,599
Hey.

309
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,594
Listen, what's your name?

310
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,798
Cuervo.

311
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,792
How old are you?

312
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,319
Twenty.

313
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,912
They gave you
a tremendous shotgun.

314
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,636
They must like you.

315
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,239
If they liked me
they'd let me keep my rifle...

316
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,358
...and not this stupid shotgun.

317
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,791
They would have
made me leader of a column...

318
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,954
...and we would be fighting by now
instead of crossing these mountains.

319
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,791
With your permission, Doctor...

320
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,914
...we were standing guard last night
but our relief never came.

321
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,119
We stayed
until six in the morning.

322
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,914
We never found out
where they were.

323
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,715
We try to follow the rules,
but it's not easy.

324
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,358
Hey, Joel!

325
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,435
Didn't you organize
the watch last night?

326
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,758
Yes, sir. Why?

327
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,954
Omar and Carlos were on watch for
four hours and relief never showed.

328
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,958
Those guys are stupid shitheads!

329
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,118
No, you're the only shithead here.

330
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,193
Me? Why?

331
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,519
Ernesto, they should've found out
where their relief was sleeping.

332
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,591
- That's not my fault.
- What the fuck were you thinking?

333
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,990
That was your responsibility.

334
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,590
You organized the watch! You had
to guarantee the shift relief!

335
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,197
- Fuck!
- Yes, sir.

336
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,268
Tonight you'll
stand watch for four hours.

337
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,919
Stay focused!

338
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,918
It's ready, Che.

339
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,637
Esteban left to meet
Cuervo at the sentry post.

340
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,074
- When did he leave?
- Half an hour ago.

341
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,151
Those bastards are gone!

342
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,032
Bandera, come here.

343
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,155
Esteban and Cuervo took off.
We have to find both of them.

344
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,795
We're from Fidel's group.

345
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,236
We're looking for food and money.

346
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,788
You can put the money in this bag.

347
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,796
The Comandante here wants
to talk to your daughter.

348
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,991
We searched all over...

349
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,678
...but nothing.

350
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,878
Alright.

351
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,872
<i>Of course, defeating</i>
<i>imperialism is impossible...</i>

352
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,594
...if you don't recognize its source
is the United States of America.

353
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,958
<i>In capitalist system,</i>
<i>people live in an invisible cage.</i>

354
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,359
<i>For example, they accept</i>
<i>the myth of the self-made man.</i>

355
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,234
<i>But they do not understand...</i>

356
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,875
<i>that opportunities</i>
<i>for the majority...</i>

357
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,637
<i>... are determined by forces</i>
<i>completely beyond individual control.</i>

358
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,597
This is ugly.

359
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,673
I want the vanguard a hundred yards
ahead of us at all times.

360
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,233
We should bury them.

361
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,916
Because yours is the kingdom,
the power and glory forever and ever.

362
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,279
Amen.

363
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,636
Locals say there's a terrible battle
in the Estrada Palma military base.

364
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,636
They say Raúl is wounded and that
the army is coming toward us.

365
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,390
Forget about it. We're surrounded.

366
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,191
The only way out of here...

367
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,751
...is to cut through El Turquino.

368
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,039
I'm ready to take the mountain.

369
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,673
That was a good party.

370
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,994
Vilo.

371
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,510
- He says he wants to talk to you.
- I'm sorry.

372
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,836
The problem is that one of your men
who says he is Lalo Sardiñas...

373
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,314
...is down there
with a group of rebels...

374
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,436
...and if a patrol arrives...

375
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,911
...they're going to burn my shack,
and kill my family.

376
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,073
And that can't happen! No way!

377
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,949
Pleased to meet you.
My name is Ernesto Guevara.

378
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,113
- What's your name?
- Emilio Cabrera.

379
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,511
Emilio, don't worry.
No one is going to touch anything.

380
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,910
Vilo, tell people to get ready,
they're about to meet Fidel Castro.

381
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,672
No, now listen to me.

382
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,993
Raúl wasn't really wounded. We were
the ones surrounding the army.

383
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,913
And those bastards escaped.

384
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,275
Boy!

385
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,518
Come on, motherfucker.
Give me a hand.

386
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,232
How are you?

387
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,473
Here.

388
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,633
Welcome.

389
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,549
- Where did you get those peasants?
- Those are my troops, man.

390
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,552
They're working out all right.

391
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,350
I don't speak out loud
because they'll get big heads.

392
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,238
We've missed you.

393
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,428
Some coffee?

394
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,594
Hey, Joel.

395
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,360
Fidel asked me why I
hadn't made you lieutenant.

396
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,552
I told him because you didn't know
how to read or write.

397
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,514
Well, I want to learn.

398
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,080
But I need someone to teach me.

399
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,674
Then get a pencil
and a pair of notebooks...

400
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,031
...and put them in your backpack.

401
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,668
Look, Che.

402
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,718
This is the new recruit I wanted
to introduce to you.

403
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,350
Doctor Martínez Páez.

404
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,799
Pleased to meet you.

405
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,311
I have a present here.

406
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,196
From now on...

407
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,198
...I stop being the medic
to become a guerrilla.

408
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,391
What, are you giving up your job?

409
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,271
Yes, sir.

410
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,390
- Who are they?
- Chibás and Pazos.

411
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,152
They're signing an agreement.

412
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,078
What agreement?

413
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,831
A political alliance.

414
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,514
<i>I would say that</i>
<i>the only conflict we had</i>

415
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,870
<i>was with Batista and his allies...</i>

416
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,031
<i>We differed in our tactics.</i>

417
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,277
<i>They wanted to oust Batista</i>
<i>with a general strike...</i>

418
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,792
<i>... and we wanted to overthrow him</i>
<i>with an armed struggle.</i>

419
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,115
<i>As you can see</i>

420
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,915
<i>our method proved effective</i>
<i>for removing Batista.</i>

421
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,631
All right, gentlemen.

422
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,956
The provisional government, first...

423
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,558
...will free all political
prisoners, civilian and military.

424
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,153
Second, it will guarantee freedom of
information for the radio and press...

425
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,434
...and individual and political rights
established in the 1940 Constitution.

426
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,195
The provisional government

427
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,834
will also establish terms
for the Agrarian Reform...

428
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,270
...leading to
the distribution of public lands.

429
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,753
Have a good trip.

430
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,919
Excuse me, Fidel.

431
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,112
I can't understand how you can meet
with those clowns...

432
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,119
...and much less, how you can make
an agreement with them.

433
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,517
They're fighting against
the same enemy we are.

434
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,272
No, you're fighting,
they're negotiating.

435
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,235
They have lots of followers, Ernesto.

436
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,113
People I can't afford to turn away.

437
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,356
Let's see how it goes.

438
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,913
But I'm sure that if we win the war...

439
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,350
...those guys will
hand the keys over to the U.S.

440
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:43,879
Listen, when this war is won, no
one's handing any keys to anybody.

441
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,237
I'll guarantee you that.

442
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,798
Come here, I need you
to sign something for me.

443
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,869
It's a letter
of condolence for Frank País.

444
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,710
They killed his brother in Santiago.

445
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,397
They killed his brother?

446
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,156
Sign as "Comandante."

447
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,231
Sign as "Comandante."

448
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,913
I'm forming a new column in
the eastern side of Mount Turquino.

449
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,072
You'll have three captains...

450
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,759
...Lalo Sardiñas...

451
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,115
...Ramiro Valdés...

452
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,873
...and Ciro Redondo.

453
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,192
You have to wear out
Mosquera's troops...

454
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,991
...harass them constantly.
Don't let up on them.

455
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,157
Don't even let them breathe!

456
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,318
You cannot give them a break.

457
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,870
I want you to establish a base
at El Hombrito.

458
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,195
Got it?

459
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,516
No one can leave a wounded comrade
on the battlefield.

460
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,354
Right?

461
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,236
If any of you leave weapons behind
during battle or anywhere else...

462
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,471
...you'll have to go back for it, alone.

463
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,749
And if anyone falls asleep on guard
duty, he won't eat for three days.

464
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,398
Is that clear?

465
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,398
Thank you, Ciro.

466
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,591
I want to say something else...

467
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,710
...to make myself clear.

468
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,997
We respect the peasants...

469
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,038
...so no one is allowed
to touch their harvest...

470
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,392
...or mess with them...

471
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,911
...ortheirfamilies.

472
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,717
If anyone does...

473
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,318
...he will be punished to the full
extent of the revolutionary code.

474
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,639
Luis!

475
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,437
Come here.

476
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,317
Here you go. Take care
of it like it's your girlfriend.

477
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,158
Thank you, Comandante.

478
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,156
Do you need help, Comandante?

479
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,555
No.

480
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,715
- Gustavo.
- Yes, Comandante.

481
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,673
Take your math notebook out
and do some work.

482
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,112
I'm exhausted, Comandante.

483
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,679
Okay.

484
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,229
<i>Love.</i>

485
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,711
<i>Let me tell you something</i>
<i>at the risk of sounding ridiculous.</i>

486
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,394
<i>A true revolutionary is guided</i>
<i>by great feelings of love...</i>

487
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,428
<i>... love of humanity,</i>

488
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,949
<i>justice</i>

489
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,309
<i>and truth.</i>

490
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,432
<i>It's impossible to conceive</i>
<i>of an authentic revolutionary...</i>

491
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,999
<i>... without this one quality.</i>

492
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,714
Don't move, asshole!

493
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,239
Freeze! Don't shoot!

494
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,668
I'm a doctor.

495
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,709
Che, they're shooting mortars!

496
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,033
How many men are in your troops?

497
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,674
One hundred forty.

498
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,033
Under whose command?

499
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,631
Merob Sosa.

500
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,070
- Mortars!
- Let's go.

501
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,599
- Tell me.
- Ramiro.

502
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,679
Go back and keep shooting until
Lalo Sardiñas' squad has passed.

503
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,959
We'll do a second line of resistance...

504
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,990
...up there, on the hill,
two hundred meters away.

505
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,231
- See you.
- Let's go, gentlemen.

506
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,989
That's Gustavo!

507
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,833
No, Roberto! Roberto!

508
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,715
<i>Friends?</i>

509
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,718
<i>It would be very difficult,</i>
<i>it would take a long time.</i>

510
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,592
By this I mean
with the U.S. government...

511
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,351
<i>... because we have nothing</i>
<i>against the American people.</i>

512
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,315
<i>There's not even a trace of hate in</i>
<i>our country for the American people</i>

513
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,793
Comandante, there's a page missing.

514
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,631
- How is this possible?
- The fourteenth.

515
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,312
Here is the page. It's torn out.

516
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:55,430
Excuse me, Comandante.

517
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,871
There's a small problem.

518
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,958
- What did he say?
- There's a bomb threat at the U.N.

519
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,153
They called the station
30 minutes ago, Comandante.

520
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,949
Hector, you go with Pedro and the
Cuban delegation in the second car...

521
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,309
...and I will go in the first car.

522
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,079
I think I should go with you.

523
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,872
I didn't ask your opinion.

524
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,597
Comandante, with all due respect...

525
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,832
...I came here to protect you.

526
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,072
And I'd like you to give me
that opportunity, at least.

527
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,792
- That way we'll die together if...
- No one is going to die.

528
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,035
Traitor!

529
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,795
Go away! Traitor! Murderer!

530
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,189
Not only did you desert
with yourweapon...

531
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,113
...and terrorize the area,
stealing from the poor...

532
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,311
...in the name of the revolution...

533
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,273
...but also,
because of your betrayal...

534
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:07,792
...peasants were tortured
and murdered by Batista's army.

535
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,033
Why, Esteban?

536
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,035
The punishment for treason is death.

537
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,074
And you...

538
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,990
...boasted of your authority
as a messenger for the Rebel Army...

539
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,432
...and passing yourself off
as Comandante Almeida...

540
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,989
...you raped
Juan Carlos Estévez's daughter...

541
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,751
...a teenager...

542
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,831
...and this also
deserves the death penalty.

543
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,951
Bring him here.

544
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,235
Would you like a sip of rum?

545
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,271
Roberto, give him a swig.

546
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,237
Do you have a last wish?

547
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,476
Let me confess to Father Chávez.

548
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,837
We can't bring you the priest.
He's far away, we have no time.

549
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,390
- Something else?
- Then give me another swig.

550
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,591
Give him another.

551
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,599
Ready.

552
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,197
Aim.

553
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,038
Make sure everyone knows I asked
for my last confession.

554
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,389
Fire!

555
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,315
Mr. President, fellow delegates...

556
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,752
The world has developed a great deal
in this political arena...

557
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,679
...but American imperialism,
above all...

558
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,633
...has led people to believe
that peaceful coexistence...

559
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,991
...is the exclusive right
of the world's most powerful nations.

560
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,311
Cuba, my fellow delegates,
free and sovereign...

561
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,110
...with no chains
tying it to anyone...

562
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,478
...without foreign investments
in its territory...

563
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,839
...free from occupant military bosses
determining political status...

564
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,312
...can stand tall at this assembly...

565
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,353
...and demonstrate the correctness of
the cry with which it was baptized.

566
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,758
Free territory of America!

567
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,908
The United States

568
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,954
intervenes in Latin America
claiming they defend freedom.

569
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,072
One day this assembly
will acquire enough maturity...

570
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,910
...to demand equal rights for blacks...

571
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,151
...and Latin Americans living
in this country...

572
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,350
...as they awaken
from the long,

573
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,160
brutal sleep to
which they've been subject.

574
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,079
We need to say here...

575
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,910
...something that is a known truth.

576
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,277
And this is a truth we have always
presented to the world.

577
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,509
Executions? Yes, we have executed.

578
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,351
We execute, and we'll continue
to execute when it is necessary.

579
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,071
Our fight is a fight to death.

580
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,318
These are the
conditions in which we live...

581
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,038
...because of the imposition
of American imperialism.

582
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,032
Good morning.

583
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,630
- How are you, doctor?
- Good.

584
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,916
- And my brother?
- Very good.

585
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,429
- What's your name?
- He's Enrique, my brother.

586
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,272
We're from Remedios.

587
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,838
We worked
for the 26th of July Movement.

588
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,990
My brother and I, with a group...

589
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,760
...tried to burn down the stable
at the town barracks...

590
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,750
...but one of the soldiers
identified my brother...

591
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,638
...so we came here to find Fidel.

592
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,553
- What's your name?
- Rogelio Acevedo.

593
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,474
- How old are you, Rogelio?
- Sixteen.

594
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,278
- And you?
- Fourteen.

595
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,351
Sixteen and fourteen.

596
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,196
I can't accept you, you're too young.

597
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,953
- What are you here for?
- Same reasons as you.

598
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,915
Is that so? Very good.

599
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,518
Do you know how to read and write?

600
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,035
No.

601
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,680
Raise your hands, the ones who
know how to read and write.

602
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,071
So you know how to read and write?

603
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,472
Yes, Comandante.
I made it through sixth grade.

604
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,155
We are not here in the middle
of the mountains just to fire guns.

605
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,474
A country that doesn't know
how to read and write...

606
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,474
...is easy to deceive.

607
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,231
Since none of you have weapons...

608
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:49,237
...l'm picking only eight of you.
The rest will have to go.

609
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,590
This is no piece of cake,
we're here to fight.

610
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,879
We won't eat for days. We'll sleep
on the ground in the rain...

611
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,037
...we're risking our lives here.

612
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,468
Is that clear?

613
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,591
- Yes.
- Is that absolutely clear?

614
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,233
- Sure?
- Yes.

615
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,471
Good. You will be a teacher.

616
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,350
And the rest will learn from her.
You came here to fight and to learn.

617
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,109
Okay?

618
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,313
And you?

619
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,155
- Come on, boys, you gotta go.
- No.

620
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,954
Fuck no. You have to go.

621
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,879
If I have to go back to Remedios
I'd rather shoot myself.

622
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,633
Me, too.

623
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,358
My God...

624
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,032
- Are you listening?
- Let's go, man.

625
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,676
Let's get moving.

626
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,672
Come on.

627
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,438
Wait, wait, wait!

628
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,399
You can't do that, man.

629
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,750
Stand up!
You're stopping the column!

630
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,313
- Hold my gun.
- Let's go.

631
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,795
The next letter is...

632
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,358
No, look.

633
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,676
Here. Yello...

634
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,432
Excuse me, Che.
He says he needs to talk to you.

635
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,596
What's going on?

636
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,629
Comandante, Camilo calls me a
bad word every time he sees me.

637
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,474
- What bad word?
- Something rude I don't like.

638
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,793
Go and get Camilo.
Like what?

639
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,356
I don't want to be a bother, but I'm
a man who shouldn't be disrespected.

640
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,391
Everyone is laughing
and making fun of me.

641
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,108
I don't really understand what
he's saying, but I don't like it.

642
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,557
What's going on, Comandante?

643
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,679
Albertico.

644
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,358
What's the story?

645
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,150
Okay, friend, now tell me
what Camilo's been saying to you?

646
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,669
He calls me "vanilla piss".
