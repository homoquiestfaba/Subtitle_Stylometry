Ever been bow hunting, Danny?

321
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,401
Never been hunting, period.

322
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:53,195

That's hardly a proper view, miss,

324

even tried it once.

Don't.

00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:10,755
- Fit OK?
- I'm getting used to it.

327
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,340
I knew you would.

didn't want you to come.

00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,812
before it all... happened.

333
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,151
I used to be on Wall Street.
Had a bit of a meltdown.

334
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:36,155
- Seems an appropriate reaction.
- (SCOFFS) Not everybody thought so.

Definitely not my clients.

337
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:43,954
I lost a lot of people's money.

Including Bryan's, Toni's, my own.

339

who your real friends are.

340
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,049
- The ones who stand by you.
- Maybe they think you owe them.

341
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,843
No, not them.

342
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,762
It was all so embarrassing.

343
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:02,723
You weren't suited to that nonsense.

344
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,101
On the plus side, it's how we found you.

345
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,894
What do you mean?

do Boys Gone <i>Wild.</i>

524
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,765
What do you mean?

525
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,894
- Now it's a party!
- Get that away!

526
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,147
Sick. You're sick.

527
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,358
- Come on, guys.
- Sorry.

528
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,741
- Yeah!
- Nice!

529
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:40,160
Just a minute, guys.

530
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:42,370

Wait a second. You're doing what?

534
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,403
Restoring Hobb Springs.
Top to bottom.

535
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,905
Figure we could have a grand reopening
by next summer.

536
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,450
What did you do to him last night?

537
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:46,119
- This isn't me.
- It was my decision.

538
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,413
There's something about this place.

539
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,166
Haven't you guys felt different
since you got here?

540
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:55,211
- Yeah. I've been freaking out.
- Passing out over here.

541
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:59,257
- Toni?
- No, we're really happy for you, hon.

542
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:02,761
- But this place...
- Was great. And it can be again.

543
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:07,348
Do you even know anything about...
about running a hotel, or a spa?

544
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:11,853
- I'm not just doing it for the money.
- No, we get that. We really do.

545
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,440
Rod? You said that we'd all
make a great web series.

546
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:19,277
What better way to film a group
of friends restoring a great landmark.

547
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:22,906
Yeah. I could definitely cut
a good sizzle reel together.

548
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:26,534
- Make it a rustic <i>Real</i> World.
- DANNY: And Vic?

549
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,995
You said you were game for writing a
book about the history of this place.

550
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:31,164
- Sure, but...
- See, Bry?

551
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:32,832
We build awareness.

552
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,502
The rest of it is just
simple business sense

553
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,837
and that's why they
paid us the big bucks.

554
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,380
What do you say, man?

555
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:44,719
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt
to draw up a business plan.

556
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,513
I knew you'd come around.

557
00:46:49,933 --> 00:46:51,267
I know what you're gonna say.

558
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:52,977
Then why are you gonna make me say it?

559
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:56,022
Did you look at the guy?
It's like night and day.

560
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:58,483
We were supposed to be going
back to the city.

561
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,778
It's not so easy for me
to just pack it all in, you know.

562
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:02,987
We came hereto help him.

563
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,323
I don't even know why
we're still friends with the guy!

564
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:08,451
Oh, my God!
You just don't know when to shut up!

565
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:12,997
What?

566
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:16,167
What exactly were you doing with that?

567
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:17,710
Jillian?

568
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,131
This is Staffordshire.

569
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,259
Do you have any idea
how much these are worth?

570
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,844
How much?

571
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,473
Two thousand, at least.

572
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:35,061
Cabinet's full of them. I...

573
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:38,439
I didn't think anyone would notice.

574
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:39,899
Show me.

575
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:44,529
Where else have you checked for these?

576
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:48,449
Just here. I didn't wanna look alone.

577
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:52,412
All right. I'll bring them to you,
and you catalogue them. OK?

578
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,373
Yes!

579
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:02,672
Hey.

580
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,093
Oh, yeah.

581
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:13,600
These... are perfect.

582
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:48,009
So secret passages really do exist.

583
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:54,474
JILLIAN: Yeah, but where do they lead?

584
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:10,073
Check out those cupboards.

585
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,873
Are we going down there?

586
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,834
They keep priceless antiques
out in the open.

587
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,587
Can you imagine what they
decided to hide?

588

- JILLIAN: Hey. Are they...?
- BRYAN: Yep.

589
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,463
They're screwing.

591
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,308
I think I know.

592
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,274
Get the idea?

593
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:28,443
Wait.

594
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,404
You're saying that they would just
have sex here

595
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:34,490
- while people stood by and watched?
- Mm-hm.

596
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:39,287
Geez. This is one kinky spa.

597
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,583
Whoa, whoa!

598
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,295
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm agreeing with you.

599

600
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,766

is a small miracle.

to get me back in the firm?
