1
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:37,170
- Hm.

2
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,606
Oh.

3
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,310
Ah!

4
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,086
Come explore science
as we go above...

5
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,156
- Three, two, one, zero.

6
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,359
- And beyond!

7
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,368
Close your eyes.

8
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,437
Go ahead.

9
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,207
Most people think
it's just a black abyss.

10
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:18,111
But in fact,
the universe appears.

11
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:20,515
Look closely.
Do you see it?

12
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,149
It's faint,

13
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,819
but it's there
if you concentrate.

14
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:27,889
It's probably colorful
and shifting.

15
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,357
It's evolving and growing.

16
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,225
Do you see it?

17
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,396
What you're seeing
is entirely unique to you.

18
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,566
It's a kind of fingerprint,

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,335
your own personal universe.

20
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:44,706
Now...

21
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:48,141
Open your eyes.

22
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,244
- I said, can you open
your eyes for me, Cameron?

23
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,380
Hello?

24
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,518
Oh, my God.

25
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,405
It was unbelievable.

26
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,540
- Was he dead?

27
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,441
- The ambulance guy said
he had a chance.

28
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,510
- Paramedics.

29
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:03,477
- Yeah, I know
what they're called.

30
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:04,344
- Well, was anyone else hurt?

31
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,378
- What did you do
till they showed?

32
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,315
- No, but-but-well,
I just kind of sat there,

33
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,051
uh, with him.

34
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,588
I don't know.
I just-it was weird.

35
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:17,859
What?

36
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:21,796
- It's-it's a really
crazy story, Cam.

37
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,731
It's really crazy.

38
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,635
You don't believe me, do you?

39
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,704
- I do. I do.
It's just the part

40
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,404
about falling from the sky,
you know?

41
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,674
You sure it didn't hit
the curb and then flip over?

42
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:36,443
- Well, who was he?
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

43
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,413
They didn't tell me, but he-

44
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,383
he looked like a younger,
better-looking version of me.

45
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,352
- Hm.
I bet my twin is a hot blonde

46
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,621
with big fake boobs.

47
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,990
- Oh, come on.
You're beautiful as is.

48
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,457
- Cam, you do know

49
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,627
that it sounds outlandish,
though, right?

50
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,427
- You're a man, right?
- Yeah. I understand, but it-

51
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,329
- So why is it that, like,
the standard of beauty for men

52
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,430
is, like, high heels
and a dress?

53
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,266
What is that about?

54
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,000
I mean, it doesn't make sense
to me.

55
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,067
Like, why-
- I'm just saying-

56
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:02,103
- What's wrong with, like,
a good pair of pants?

57
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,638
- I feel like
there's no reason

58
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:04,772
you can't give a rational
explanation for this.

59
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:05,706
- Because, like, at school
they make you either wear,

60
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,542
like, a skirt or pants
for your uniform-

61
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,479
- This is pressure.

62
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:13,514
Air pressure.

63
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:15,683
Air pressure makes
the wind blow

64
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,484
and allows us to breathe.

65
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:21,088
Without air pressure,
nothing could fly.

66
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:23,423
Now, look at this.

67
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:27,061
This airplane is flying.

68
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,796
Well, it was in rehearsal.

69
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,801
Air moving across the wings
is what scientists call lift.

70
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:37,939
Now, any fluid,
be it air or water,

71
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:41,642
flowing around an object
puts a force on that object.

72
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:44,779
Lift is the component
of this force

73
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:48,082
that is perpendicular
to the oncoming flow.

74
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,051
And it is
this perpendicular force

75
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:51,519
that causes airplanes...

76
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,387
- Your show's on way too late.

77
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,657
Why do they put a kids' show
on at midnight?

78
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,964
Midnight's a decent time slot.

79
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:06,167
Besides, Tony's got
some Saturday morning slot

80
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,935
opening up soon.

81
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:09,670
We'll be on
with the other kids' shows

82
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:12,039
before you know it.

83
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:15,509
- Didn't he say that
last year?

84
00:06:20,014 --> 00:06:22,116
- You know, my dad
used to always say,

85
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:25,586
"There are two kinds of people
in the world, Cameron,

86
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,723
"astronomers and astronauts.

87
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:32,960
Some look at the stars,
others swim in them."

88
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,932
- Okay.

89
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,067
- Just be happy you're young.

90
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:43,037
You could still be
an astronaut.

91
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,538
- Yeah, but I don't
wanna be an astronaut.

92
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,073
You do.

93
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,109
- No, what I mean is,

94
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:52,880
you still have time
to do something fantastic.

95
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:55,583
- What do you want me
to say here, Cameron?

96
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,885
You're calling me Cameron now?

97
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,855
- Yeah.
It's your name, isn't it?

98
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,190
- Isn't it your bedtime?

99
00:07:03,224 --> 00:07:04,225
I think it's your bedtime.

100
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,527
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

101
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,628
What'd I miss?
Come on.

102
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:09,196
- You missed the fact
of the day.

103
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,531
- No!
- Yes.

104
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,199
And that-
- That's my favorite part.

105
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,601
- Now you won't-
- What was it?

106
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,202
- You missed it.

107
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:17,038
The fact's gone.

108
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:19,106
- Ugh. Come on.

109
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,975
You don't get the fact.

110
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,640
- I talked to Larry.

111
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:56,010
He said the divorce papers
should be...

112
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,878
ready in a few weeks.

113
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:04,452
- Are we sure
we want to do this?

114
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,493
- We have to figure out
how we're gonna tell everyone.

115
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,211
- Forgot to brush my teeth.

116
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:00,668
- Hey, come on!
It's 7:15.

117
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,939
- Whoa.
- What?

118
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,040
- It's that guy.

119
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:08,275
That-that guy
from the car crash

120
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:11,812
that I saved or whatever,

121
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:14,882
He won a Copley.
He's an astronaut.

122
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,383
- What's a Coupler?
- Copley.

123
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:17,818
- It's British.
- It's a medal,

124
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:20,287
for science,
like the Nobel prize.

125
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:22,356
- Well,
except the Nobel is Swedish.

126
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,793
- Remember Bill Lang?

127
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,295
He won a Copley only
four years after graduating?

128
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:31,132
- God, who could forget
Willie Lang?

129
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:32,666
- Exactly. Ugh.
- Hang on.

130
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,968
Didn't you win a medal once?

131
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,402
- That was a Crawford.

132
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:38,072
- His father won the Copley.

133
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:41,041
- Okay, now I'm lost.
Actually, I don't care, so...

134
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,810
- All right. I'm off.

135
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:44,845
- God, this guy looks like me.

136
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,782
He totally does.

137
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:52,786
- I-I mean, like a little,
not that much, right?

138
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,756
- No, he does.
Okay. See you, Cam.

139
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,327
Does-does he look like me?

140
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,967
Not a lot though, right?

141
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:05,185
- Statistically speaking,
in a room with over 23 people,

142
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:07,988
there is more
than a 50% chance

143
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:12,092
that two people will have
the same birthday.

144
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:13,427
We've got 22 in here now,

145
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,229
but I think we've got
a pretty good shot.

146
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,898
So let's hear some birthdays,
starting in the back.

147
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,601
Mr. Cohen.

148
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:21,402
- September 8th.

149
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,170
- August 9th.

150
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,372
- November 7th.

151
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:27,274
- March 28th.

152
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,009
- December 10th.

153
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:30,978
- November 7th.

154
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,479
- April 4th.

155
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,381
- February 14th.

156
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:37,951
Valentine's Day.

157
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,387
- October 31st, Halloween.

158
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:42,089
- Ooh, October 31st.

159
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,424
Spooky.

160
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:44,992
Yes?
- Hi. Yeah.

161
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,127
I just got registered,
and they said to come here.

162
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,429
- Oh.
Welcome, welcome.

163
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,898
And what is your birthday,
good sir?

164
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,000
- October 31st.

165
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,503
- We have a match,
ladies and gentlemen.

166
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,639
Mm!
Isn't math cool?

167
00:13:57,672 --> 00:14:00,941
A Halloween destiny
has been foretold.

168
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,510
Why don't you come on in,
have a seat

169
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,211
right in front of your match.

170
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:09,651
Now, probability statistics...

171
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:21,995
- There is a certain force
of attraction in our universe

172
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,331
pulling us together.

173
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:27,301
You,

174
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,937
me,

175
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:35,042
and the TV you're watching
are all pulling on each other.

176
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,176
This...

177
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:41,081
Is gravity.

178
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:44,318
The more mass
an object has on Earth,

179
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,187
the greater pull it has
from Earth.

180
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,591
We call this pull weight.

181
00:14:49,624 --> 00:14:51,492
With all that weight
pulling down,

182
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:55,095
it's a wonder anything
or anyone has ever made it

183
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:58,533
off planet Earth
and into outer space.

184
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:04,004
You gotta go 600,000 feet up
to get there.

185
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:07,408
That's 20 times higher
than Mount Everest.

186
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:10,010
So how do you get there?

187
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,912
Rockets.

188
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,987
- That'll work.
It's a go for broadcast, Cam.

189
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,054
- You didn't watch
the whole thing.

190
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,389
- Ooh, I trust you didn't slip

191
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,191
any subliminal messages
in there.

192
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,226
Your shows are all
the same anyway, right?

193
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,295
- Um...
- Everything okay?

194
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,396
- Yeah.

195
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,132
- Man, sorry about
the Saturday slot.

196
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:35,369
- The-the what?
- The Saturday morning slot.

197
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,104
I thought you guys
really deserved it.

198
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,573
- I've got the footage-
- Mm-hmm.

199
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,708
- And we're seeing
a few problems with it...

200
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,710
- Uh, thanks.
- Yeah.

201
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:44,746
- I tried to organize it,
but...

202
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,014
Tony, did you give

203
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:49,149
the Saturday morning slot
to another show?

204
00:15:49,183 --> 00:15:50,184
- Cam, Cammy, come on in.

205
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,386
- Shonda said that-whoa.

206
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,154
- Kent Armstrong.

207
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:57,424
- But-I can't believe you're
even standing right now.

208
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,562
- Excuse me?
- The crash.

209
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:01,729
You crashed
your car yesterday.

210
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:04,264
- I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're talking about.

211
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,432
- I saw-I was-
- No, no, no.

212
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,034
Kent just moved to town.

213
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:10,638
You know him?
He's a famous-uh, uh-

214
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:12,574
wow, I'm sorry, it's just...

215
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:14,441
you two look a lot alike.

216
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,744
You know that?
- Not really.

217
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:18,646
- Relax, buddy.
It's a compliment.

218
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,047
- But-but I don't think we do,

219
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,315
not-not that much.

220
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:24,552
Can I talk to you, Tony,
for-in private?

221
00:16:24,586 --> 00:16:26,153
- Be my guest.

222
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:29,289
Nice to meet you, uh, Samuel.

223
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,026
- See you in a second.

224
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,194
- What the hell is this?

225
00:16:34,228 --> 00:16:35,663
You promised me
that Saturday slot

226
00:16:35,697 --> 00:16:37,030
for, like, two years now.

227
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,700
- Okay.
Cameron, take a seat.

228
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,270
Look. I got some good news.

229
00:16:43,303 --> 00:16:45,138
PBS called.

230
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,307
They are interested
in "Above and Beyond."

231
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,475
Network.

232
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,177
Scott from
the Columbus affiliate,

233
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,679
he sent them a VHS.

234
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:53,180
They loved it.

235
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,414
- Wh-really?

236
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,518
- "Above and Beyond"
is gonna take off.

237
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:59,621
I'm talking about lunch boxes,
key chains,

238
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:01,723
doodads, widgets,
the whole thing.

239
00:17:01,756 --> 00:17:03,290
And you are gonna be

240
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,760
an amazing
creative consultant.

241
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,330
- What does that mean?

242
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,302
- They want a different host.

243
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,037
They want Kent.

244
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,508
He won a Copley.
Did you know that?

245
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:24,177
- Did you?
- I did. I did.

246
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:28,148
- That guy?

247
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:29,216
You're joking, right?

248
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,218
I mean, I-

249
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:34,154
he's, like-he's-he's, like-

250
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,323
he's like,
my antithesis or something.

251
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,225
- Like your nemesis?
- No.

252
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,394
- Your nemesis.
- No

253
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:41,729
- Cameron.
- Antithesis.

254
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:44,566
- You're still gonna get paid.

255
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,199
- He-
- Technically, WKFH

256
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,335
still owns 51%.

257
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,337
I'm sorry.

258
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,839
The decision is final.

259
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,348
- Well, I-I don't even
know what to say.

260
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,117
- Well, the other option,
you walk right now.

261
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:07,120
I mean, hell, Cam,
maybe this is good for you.

262
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,757
You go do
what you're destined for.

263
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,159
You're always talking
about NASA.

264
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:15,295
Send them an application.

265
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,397
- It's not that simple.

266
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:24,237
- All right.
Well, I got a meeting, so...

267
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:56,136
- Go around.

268
00:18:58,372 --> 00:18:59,373
What?

269
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:32,507
Jesus.

270
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,333
- We're gonna need
two more dispatched.

271
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,569
- Copy that.

272
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:40,273
- Of course.

273
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:46,346
- Sir, I need you
to stand back.

274
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,548
- This is my house.

275
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,584
- I'm sorry.
- Cameron.

276
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:50,518
- Where have you been?
- What is this?

277
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:51,719
- You are not gonna believe
what happened.

278
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:54,321
- No, some old-ass Russian
rocket fell from outer space,

279
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:56,657
and it crashed
in our backyard.

280
00:20:56,691 --> 00:20:59,359
- What?

281
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,428
- How are you?

282
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,865
- Right. Right.

283
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:05,700
I work at
the Air and Space Museum,

284
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,702
so if I could see it,
I might actually be able

285
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:08,736
to help
with the identification.

286
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,538
- Nobody's allowed back there.

287
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:11,873
- Do you understand
how rare it is

288
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:14,341
that a piece
of this thing would fall...

289
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,044
- You're the homeowner?
Mr. Edwin?

290
00:21:17,078 --> 00:21:18,445
- Yeah.

291
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,714
- Well,
I'd say it'd be a while

292
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:21,082
before we see any progress.

293
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,750
No one knows
who should claim it

294
00:21:22,784 --> 00:21:24,451
or why it even fell
in the first place.

295
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:25,553
There's a lot
of paperwork to do

296
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:26,621
in this kind of situation.

297
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:28,388
- Can I-can I see it?

298
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,757
- See what?

299
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,926
- The rocket that fell
in our backyard.

300
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,460
I'm a-I'm an astronomer.

301
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,495
- An astronaut?

302
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,397
- No, I'm an astronomer,
but this-

303
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,934
- Look, I'm afraid the house
is SOE, a site of evidence.

304
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,369
You can't see it and you can't
move back in either.

305
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,504
Government jurisdiction.

306
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:45,540
- So-
- We'll keep you posted.

307
00:21:52,547 --> 00:21:53,581
I can't believe-

308
00:21:53,614 --> 00:21:55,950
- You smell
like dog shit, Cameron.

309
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:25,445
- Hey.
Come in, come in.

310
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,582
- How are you doing, Lin?
- Hi, Cameron.

311
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:29,050
- Hi.

312
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:34,522
- You know, in Hawaii,
they would call this "'ohana,"

313
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:35,957
which translates to

314
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,859
"the connection
of all things."

315
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:40,094
Some milk?
- Thanks, Lin.

316
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:43,396
- Cam, I can tell you're not
taking this very well.

317
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,999
You don't look so good.

318
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:47,635
You should see a doctor,

319
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:50,872
or maybe a therapist.

320
00:22:50,905 --> 00:22:53,808
- Thanks, Lin.

321
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:55,877
- Thanks for letting us
stay a while.

322
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,613
- Course. Course.

323
00:22:58,646 --> 00:23:01,515
I mean, you couldn't stay
at that house.

324
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:04,384
- They wouldn't let us.

325
00:23:06,854 --> 00:23:09,156
Okay.

326
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,459
- They're calling it
"Sputnik in suburbia."

327
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:15,428
In a one-in-a-million event,

328
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:17,765
a defunct Russian
ICBM rocket crashed

329
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:19,700
into the suburban neighborhood
of Fairview Heights

330
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:22,003
just outside
of Dayton, Ohio, today.

331
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:24,205
Neighbors in this sleepy
cul-de-sac tell us

332
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:26,874
they heard a large crash
around 7:00 p.m. this evening,

333
00:23:26,908 --> 00:23:29,442
most thinking it was just
some kind of car accident,

334
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,045
and were shocked
to hear the truth.

335
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:32,747
Local police had no comment,

336
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,850
but the FAA is investigating
its origins.

337
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:40,154
- So come explore science
as we go above-

338
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:29,136
- Hey.

339
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:32,506
- Hi.
- Hi.

340
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,608
Uh, you just moved here,
right?

341
00:24:34,642 --> 00:24:36,577
- Yeah.

342
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,745
Yeah, my dad works
for the military,

343
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:40,247
so we moved from Orlando

344
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:43,851
via Houston via...
list goes on.

345
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:47,555
We probably won't be here
that long, honestly, so...

346
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:49,156
- Oh, okay.

347
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,525
Uh, do you live this way?

348
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,662
I mean, for now, at least.

349
00:24:54,695 --> 00:24:56,496
- Yeah.
- Cool.

350
00:24:58,265 --> 00:25:02,603
- I mean, we've been staying
at a hotel until-

351
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,605
well, today's the day we move
into our new place, so-

352
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:06,240
- Oh, God, we just moved too.

353
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,842
- Oh.
- See, a Russian rocket

354
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,845
crashed into our backyard,
so we had to evacuate.

355
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:12,780
- That was you?
- Yeah.

356
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:14,015
Welcome to Fairview Heights,

357
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:16,717
the place where space junk
falls from the sky

358
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:19,253
and you have to move in with
your weird beach-loving aunt.

359
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:22,690
Every single towel
in her house is a beach towel.

360
00:25:24,025 --> 00:25:25,726
Strange.

361
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:29,563
Uh, hey, um...

362
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,567
Sorry, I just wanna
be clear here.

363
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:35,603
I'm not, like,

364
00:25:35,636 --> 00:25:37,805
flirting with you or anything.

365
00:25:37,838 --> 00:25:39,740
- No problem.

366
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:42,576
- Like, you seem interesting.
I just, um...

367
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:48,783
You're just-like, you're not

368
00:25:48,816 --> 00:25:51,152
my type, you know?

369
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:52,686
- Oh.

370
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,589
Uh, hey,
I got to run, actually.

371
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:57,258
Um...

372
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:02,063
I'll see you tomorrow?

373
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:03,364
- Yeah.

374
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,132
- Cool.
- Cool.

375
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:45,966
- Hi.

376
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,668
- Hey.

377
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:52,273
- So I heard a rocket crashed
in your backyard.

378
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:54,341
- Yeah.

379
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,843
- Can I see it?

380
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,213
- They...

381
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:04,818
Sure.

382
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,287
Come on.

383
00:28:12,993 --> 00:28:15,129
- This isn't Russian.

384
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:16,463
I think it's American.

385
00:28:16,497 --> 00:28:18,699
- Oh, yeah.
I think you're right.

386
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:23,505
- Is it Gemini, maybe?
The service module?

387
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:26,740
- Service module, yeah, but...

388
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,976
Apollo 10, I'd guess.

389
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:31,478
Can't be sure.

390
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:35,182
- Uh, sorry, do you know her?

391
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,386
- Huh.

392
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,158
Do I know you?

393
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:51,398
I guess not.

394
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:53,901
I don't know who she is.

395
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:56,070
- Wait a minute.
I recognize you.

396
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:57,304
You were the-you were the host

397
00:28:57,338 --> 00:28:59,807
of the TV show
my dad just took over.

398
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,309
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry about that.

399
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:03,978
- No one ever
watched it anyway.

400
00:29:07,214 --> 00:29:11,852
God, this is not how I thought
things would turn out.

401
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:17,891
I wanted to be an astronaut.

402
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:21,829
I wanted to do
something...fantastic.

403
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:26,568
- Hm.
Well,

404
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:28,902
I mean, you've got this pile
of rocket crap right here.

405
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:31,905
Why don't you just
build your own rocket?

406
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:36,977
It's not that simple.

407
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:39,547
- Eh, it might be.
Who knows?

408
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,818
Well, thanks for showing me.

409
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:47,288
- Yeah.
Yeah.

410
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,971
Visitor.
- Cameron, hi.

411
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:06,608
Doc has me
on a steady regimen of crafts.

412
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,108
- Oh.
- Yeah.

413
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:09,843
You know what that is? Yeah?

414
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,012
- Uh...
- Moebius strip.

415
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:16,116
See, it only has one side.

416
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:18,852
A mathematical paradox.

417
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:20,454
- Wow.
- Yeah.

418
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,856
- You know, I know
what a Mobius strip is.

419
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,992
Makes you think, right?

420
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:26,960
- It sure does.
- Yeah.

421
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:30,297
- Hey, so the craziest thing
happened yesterday.

422
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:33,300
- You know what that is?

423
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:34,935
- Uh...

424
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:41,041
What is it?
Tell me.

425
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:43,444
- A-

426
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,879
a Moebius-Moebius strip.

427
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:47,348
- Oh, it is?
- Yeah.

428
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:49,350
- What is-how many-

429
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:51,018
how many sides does it have?

430
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,420
Do you think
this is just chance,

431
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:55,322
all this happening right now?

432
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:58,992
The-the show
with the rocket crash.

433
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,295
My...I don't know,

434
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:04,498
doppelganger.

435
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:07,301
It's all pretty weird, right?

436
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:13,440
- What else would it be?

437
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:17,044
I don't know.

438
00:31:17,077 --> 00:31:18,278
Um...

439
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:23,317
Some kind of like, uh...

440
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,123
Like a-
- Look.

441
00:31:29,156 --> 00:31:31,925
You're a scientist,

442
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:35,963
and that is a chair

443
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:40,067
that you're sitting in,
and that's a stapler,

444
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,069
and this is a nursing home.

445
00:31:42,102 --> 00:31:46,306
And I am a physician
for the elderly,

446
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,209
not a therapist, not a-

447
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:51,278
a psychic.

448
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:54,982
I don't know
what these things mean.

449
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:57,985
Sometimes, they just happen.

450
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:01,221
- What are you trying to say?

451
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:06,960
- I'm not telling you
to be rational.

452
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:09,196
- Okay.
So I should be irrational.

453
00:32:09,229 --> 00:32:10,532
- No.

454
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:12,634
Absolutely not.

455
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:19,841
- But then what?

456
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:23,444
- I'm suggesting that perhaps
the universe in our heads

457
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:26,614
is more real
than reality itself.

458
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:35,989
- You got fired?
When?

459
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:38,560
How-how is that even possible?

460
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:41,061
It's our sh-your show.

461
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:42,764
- And you didn't even
come home

462
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:44,599
for dinner tonight, Cameron.

463
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:45,667
What were you doing?

464
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,202
- I was at the house.

465
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:51,138
- The house is condemned.

466
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:53,373
- Condemned?
It has tape around it.

467
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:55,008
The house is fine.

468
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:56,578
- Oh, okay.

469
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:58,345
- Linda.

470
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,016
- Erin.

471
00:33:06,186 --> 00:33:08,021
Erin, you gotta see
this rocket.

472
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:10,758
It's not Russian.
It's American.

473
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:13,293
An Apollo service module.

474
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:15,329
- What?
- I think it's a sign.

475
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,465
- A sign?
- Yeah.

476
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:20,400
- No, Cameron,

477
00:33:20,434 --> 00:33:22,069
the rocket is
government property,

478
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:22,904
and you're trespassing.

479
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,806
You can get
into real trouble here.

480
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:27,174
Are you listening to yourself?

481
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:30,344
You gotta figure out
what to do about the show.

482
00:33:30,377 --> 00:33:33,046
- Are you listening
to yourself?

483
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,848
Remember when we used to talk

484
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:38,051
about doing
something fantastic?

485
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:39,521
Whatever happened to that?

486
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:43,758
- It's not that simple.

487
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:56,270
- Gotcha.

488
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:02,476
The Apollo rockets
weren't simple,

489
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,547
but in a way, they weren't
complicated either.

490
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,782
They operated in stages.

491
00:34:07,815 --> 00:34:12,119
These first three stages
were just giant fuel tanks

492
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,821
that were discarded
as the rocket got

493
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:16,223
higher and higher
to shed payload

494
00:34:16,256 --> 00:34:20,662
and to maximize efficiency
as the atmosphere thinned out.

495
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:23,196
Pretty brilliant, right?

496
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,464
Whoa.
- It is, Cam.

497
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:26,734
But to get to the moon,

498
00:34:26,768 --> 00:34:30,103
the CS module had to detach

499
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:34,107
from these first three stages
and fire up its own engine.

500
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:35,710
This propelled the astronauts

501
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,845
almost a quarter
of a million miles-

502
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:40,147
ooh, watch out
for the asteroids-

503
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,250
and into the moon's orbit.

504
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:46,253
- Whoa.
That's a long way away.

505
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:49,657
- The view is so great
from out here, Cam.

506
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:51,425
Come see it.

507
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:54,194
- But how would I get there?

508
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:42,777
- So this is where you take

509
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,311
all your dates
to get murdered.

510
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:46,279
- Dude, I like girls.
Okay?

511
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,280
So this isn't a date.

512
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:48,248
You're just, like,

513
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:50,317
the only other normal person
in this town.

514
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,285
- This isn't bad and all.
Don't get me wrong.

515
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,187
I enjoy your company.

516
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:55,255
- Oh, how sweet of you.

517
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:56,891
- You're doing a new one?
Oh, no, no, no, no.

518
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,026
That's cheating.
- No, it's four!

519
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:00,293
- No, that doesn't exist.
- You said-I got it right!

520
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,462
It was four.

521
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,060
- It's pretty simple,
actually.

522
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:14,494
You just wanna cross-reference

523
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:16,463
the new item
with the museum database

524
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:17,932
to see if we've already
cataloged it or not.

525
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:21,936
- So since it's an engine,
we put it in which category?

526
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,471
- That would be propulsion.
Yep.

527
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:25,940
- Got it.
- Great.

528
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:29,476
Just tab through
and keep filling them in.

529
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,344
Let me know
if you have questions.

530
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:36,050
- You know,
I used to watch your show.

531
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:36,918
- Oh.

532
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:39,587
- They showed it
in class sometimes.

533
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:44,625
- Jeez.
That's embarrassing.

534
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:46,493
- Whatever happened to it?

535
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:48,796
- Oh, I haven't been involved
with it for years.

536
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,498
- Oh.

537
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:53,500
That's too bad.
- No, no, it's fine.

538
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:55,435
I had a lot of fun,
but we just weren't

539
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:57,872
really getting anywhere
with the show, so...

540
00:38:57,905 --> 00:39:00,473
a lot of work
for a lot of dead ends.

541
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:01,809
How are you liking it here?

542
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:05,513
- I love it here.
This is, like, my dream job.

543
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:08,549
- Really?
- Totally.

544
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:09,951
- Wow.
This is your dream job?

545
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:11,552
- Of course, down the road,

546
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:14,421
I'd love to be at a national
museum or something,

547
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:15,623
but what about you?

548
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:18,626
- Um, studied
aerospace engineering

549
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,161
and mathematics
in grad school.

550
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:22,495
- I mean,
what did you wanna be

551
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,565
when you grew up?

552
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,003
- Um, you know, I don't think
I really ever chose one thing.

553
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:32,439
I just kind of wanted
to leave it open,

554
00:39:32,472 --> 00:39:34,141
but I do remember
telling people

555
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:36,544
that I just wanted to do
something fantastic.

556
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:41,082
- That's amazing.
I love that.

557
00:39:41,115 --> 00:39:44,451
- Well, it's...something.

558
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:02,469
- Hey, dude.

559
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,505
Uh, hi.

560
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:07,440
- Oh, is this your friend?
- Uh-huh.

561
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:10,544
- Well, it sure is a pleasure
to meet any friend of my son.

562
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:11,879
- Uh, yeah, you too.

563
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:15,448
I-I've heard so, um, little
about you, actually.

564
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,718
- Well, he is embarrassed
of me.

565
00:40:17,752 --> 00:40:19,987
Uh, nice wheels, dude.

566
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:21,923
- Hey, nice pants.

567
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,059
- Uh, well, I mean,

568
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,861
dress code says
skirt or pants, so-

569
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:28,062
- No, I really mean it.

570
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:29,931
Some people are
too quick to judge.

571
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:32,233
Very progressive.
Feminism.

572
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,101
- Yeah.
Yeah.

573
00:40:34,135 --> 00:40:36,203
For sure, man-no, I just-
I just don't do dresses-

574
00:40:36,237 --> 00:40:38,039
- Okay.
Uh, bye, Dad.

575
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:39,607
- I-it was-
it was nice to meet you.

576
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,642
- Great to meet you.
See you after school.

577
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:43,577
- Yep.

578
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:44,812
- Why don't we ever go
to your house?

579
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:46,213
I mean,
your dad seems awesome.

580
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,049
- Yeah.

581
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:50,117
- Hey.
- Hey.

582
00:40:50,151 --> 00:40:51,619
- One of my photos
just got published

583
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:53,621
in "Metrobop Magazine."

584
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:56,324
- Nice.

585
00:40:56,357 --> 00:41:00,895
- Was thinking you might want
to pose for me sometime.

586
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,530
- Yeah, sure.

587
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:04,098
- Cool.

588
00:41:07,802 --> 00:41:08,970
- Dude, are you kidding me?

589
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:10,604
- What?
- "What?"

590
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:11,906
Oh, I don't know.

591
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:14,608
Maybe it's just because
she's the worst.

592
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:17,511
Dude, you can't be in one
of her stupid pictures.

593
00:41:17,545 --> 00:41:21,082
- No, she's just insecure.

594
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:23,517
I'm sure she's nice
in there somewhere.

595
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:25,086
- Whose side are you on?

596
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,520
- Are you jealous?

597
00:41:26,554 --> 00:41:27,788
- Jealous.

598
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:31,092
- Cameron,
I'm glad you're here.

599
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:34,795
As you've probably noticed,
the condition is declining.

600
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:39,767
Death has become
a very real possibility.

601
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,004
- Death?
- It happened on my birthday.

602
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,908
- What did?

603
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:50,678
- Does that mean
anything to you?

604
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:53,848
- To me?

605
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:55,116
- Yes.

606
00:41:56,784 --> 00:41:59,186
No.

607
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,289
- Look, it's common

608
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:04,625
for anyone
at this later stage in life

609
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:07,294
to begin to examine
their past,

610
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:09,196
to look back
at their accomplishments

611
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,232
and scrutinize their regrets-

612
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:13,000
the big picture stuff.

613
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:16,771
Most of us have no issue
with this,

614
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:21,575
but for someone
with memory issues like this,

615
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:24,011
looking back is not so easy.

616
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:26,814
The brain is actually
clogging up

617
00:42:26,847 --> 00:42:29,717
like plaque on teeth

618
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,219
without a brain toothbrush.

619
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:34,188
- So what do you
suggest we do?

620
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:37,024
- Antidepressants are
a temporary solution,

621
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:40,728
but frankly,
mental stimulation is key.

622
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:45,366
Now, the-the best way
to combat this kind of thing

623
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:48,702
is through sharing memories

624
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:51,372
with a loved one,

625
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:54,175
stories from the past.

626
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:03,684
It's all up here

627
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:06,754
in the mind.

628
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:08,289
You understand?

629
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:13,060
- Y-yeah.

630
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:15,696
- Good.

631
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:19,900
- You here
to give me a shower?

632
00:43:19,934 --> 00:43:23,270
- No, the nurses give you
showers, not me.

633
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,707
- Well, then who are you?

634
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,879
- I'm Cameron.
You know me.

635
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:35,082
- Oh, Cameron.
Oh, of course.

636
00:43:35,116 --> 00:43:36,650
Hello.
How are you?

637
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:37,952
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

638
00:43:37,985 --> 00:43:39,320
- Good.
- Yeah.

639
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:44,725
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, fine.

640
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:46,760
- Look, this is gonna
sound crazy,

641
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:49,396
but there was a rocket-
well, part of a rocket-

642
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:50,931
that fell in our backyard.

643
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:53,767
They thought it was Russian,
but it was-

644
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:57,371
- Yeah.
You told me this already.

645
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:59,140
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

646
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:02,409
Yeah, you-you told me this
the last time you visited.

647
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:05,045
- I know, but I didn't
think you'd remember.

648
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:07,748
- You know,
I used to fly rockets.

649
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:13,287
- Fly?
But you built rockets.

650
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,256
An engineer.
You didn't fly them.

651
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:17,791
- Well, not yet.

652
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,229
- Right.
Right, well-

653
00:44:24,899 --> 00:44:26,433
I'm trying
to take this rocket,

654
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:27,902
build my own rocket.

655
00:44:27,935 --> 00:44:29,170
I'm thinking maybe
you could tell me

656
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:31,772
what some of the pieces are.

657
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:34,942
You know, like,
do you know what this is?

658
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:38,245
- Yeah, it's the combine plate
for the intake mount.

659
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:39,413
- What about this one?

660
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:43,017
- That's the engine valve
for the nitrogen regulation.

661
00:44:45,186 --> 00:44:47,321
Um...

662
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:50,124
- What-what would you say
if I...

663
00:44:50,157 --> 00:44:51,792
took you home for a while?

664
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,146
You know where you are?
- Yeah, my room.

665
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,882
- That's right.
This is your old room.

666
00:45:14,915 --> 00:45:17,251
- Uh-huh.

667
00:45:23,424 --> 00:45:25,259
- You comfortable?
- Mm-hmm.

668
00:45:29,531 --> 00:45:32,866
- Do you remember
some of this stuff?

669
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,936
- I recognize it.

670
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,404
- It's nice to have you here.

671
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,049
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.

672
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,919
It's been pretty exciting.
I've been busy.

673
00:45:51,952 --> 00:45:53,187
- So you've done
a few episodes of the show?

674
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,023
- Two episodes.
They're still editing, but...

675
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:58,526
- That's amazing.
So when does the show air?

676
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,495
- Uh, tonight, Channel 34.

677
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:03,264
Uh, hopefully
you can all watch.

678
00:46:03,297 --> 00:46:05,432
Uh, this is my son.

679
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:06,800
Say hello to everyone.

680
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:08,102
- Hi.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

681
00:46:08,135 --> 00:46:09,436
- This is Father Thomas.

682
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:10,838
- Welcome.

683
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:12,172
- Where were you?

684
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:13,207
- I'm sorry.

685
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,975
- Were you with that girl?

686
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:16,243
- No, sir.

687
00:46:16,277 --> 00:46:18,279
I was working
on my application.

688
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:24,885
- So you've decided
on a branch, then.

689
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:27,054
- Air Force.

690
00:46:27,087 --> 00:46:30,090
- Good, good.
Very respectable.

691
00:46:34,228 --> 00:46:36,930
The next time you decide
to be late,

692
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:39,833
don't bother showing up
at all.

693
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:41,201
It's embarrassing.

694
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:53,914
- Hi.

695
00:46:53,947 --> 00:46:55,617
- Oh, hey.
- How's it coming?

696
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,851
- Great.
See?

697
00:46:57,885 --> 00:47:00,254
Got the LOX tank.

698
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:02,356
Fuel vent's a little burnt,

699
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:05,292
but still functional.

700
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,295
No idea how I'm gonna
get the thrust

701
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:11,065
to get this
off the ground, but...

702
00:47:11,098 --> 00:47:12,266
well, do you got any ideas?

703
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:13,934
- Oh.

704
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:16,904
I don't actually know
that much about rockets,

705
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:19,139
but Dad would know.

706
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:22,309
- Yeah.
Uh, I-I'll get there.

707
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:25,312
It's just the slosh baffles.

708
00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:29,116
And the heat diffuses somehow.

709
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:34,888
- You know,
you're a lot like him, my dad.

710
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,325
- Yeah.
I've heard.

711
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,062
- Yeah.
I mean the good parts of him.

712
00:47:42,096 --> 00:47:44,131
You're like the version of him
I wish he was.

713
00:47:48,235 --> 00:47:52,139
- Oh.
Well, thanks.

714
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:55,909
- Yeah.
I mean...

715
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:59,346
I used to want to be him,
you know.

716
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,249
I used to dress like him
and act like him.

717
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:03,984
Well,
I never really knew my mom,

718
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:08,656
so I guess he was
the only real example I had.

719
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:12,192
So...

720
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:14,662
In any case, as I get older,

721
00:48:14,696 --> 00:48:18,031
things are starting to-

722
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:21,068
well, it's complicated.

723
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,341
Yeah.

724
00:48:27,374 --> 00:48:30,077
I know the feeling.

725
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:34,582
You wanna see the rocket?

726
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:40,087
- Right, so this was all part
of the airplane that came in.

727
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,989
- But this one's
a rocket engine.

728
00:48:42,022 --> 00:48:43,090
- Yes, yes.

729
00:48:43,123 --> 00:48:45,459
This one would be attached
to the service module.

730
00:48:45,492 --> 00:48:48,061
So it's actually this guy

731
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:51,165
that propels the rocket
from Earth

732
00:48:51,198 --> 00:48:53,668
all the way to the moon
and then back again

733
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:55,737
before it detaches
from the command module,

734
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,405
which is that little pod
with the astronauts in it

735
00:48:58,439 --> 00:48:59,707
that splashed down
in the ocean.

736
00:48:59,741 --> 00:49:02,109
- So this went to space?

737
00:49:02,142 --> 00:49:03,444
- Not this one specifically,

738
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:06,046
'cause this was actually
a backup.

739
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,316
- So what happens
to the service module?

740
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:12,019
- Oh, those are normally
just cast off

741
00:49:12,052 --> 00:49:14,154
until they burn up
in the atmosphere.

742
00:49:14,188 --> 00:49:16,190
- Really?

743
00:49:16,223 --> 00:49:17,759
- Yeah.
It's kind of sad, isn't it?

744
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,262
I'll be right back.

745
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,739
- Holy.

746
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:33,307
You built this thing
in, like, a month?

747
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,142
- Yeah.

748
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:36,076
- Wow.

749
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:41,181
Is there gonna be enough room
for you in there?

750
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:42,316
- For what?

751
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:43,785
- Well, for you
to fit in there.

752
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:45,452
I mean,
it looks kind of small.

753
00:49:49,156 --> 00:49:53,126
You're the one who's gonna be
in the rocket, right?

754
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,161
- Yeah.

755
00:49:57,064 --> 00:49:59,132
- Are you excited?
- Yeah, uh, yes.

756
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:00,802
Of course I'm excited.

757
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:02,402
Thank you.
- Fantastic.

758
00:50:02,436 --> 00:50:04,572
Now, they're gonna reach out
directly with the offer.

759
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:07,074
You have about two weeks
before she retires,

760
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:08,308
so you can
get things together here.

761
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:09,476
- Sure. Yeah.
- Okay.

762
00:50:09,511 --> 00:50:12,479
I gotta go to work.
- Okay.

763
00:50:12,514 --> 00:50:15,650
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

764
00:50:15,683 --> 00:50:17,719
- So do you really think
this thing's gonna fly?

765
00:50:17,752 --> 00:50:20,120
- Eventually. Eventually.

766
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:21,756
Testing it out today.
- What, really?

767
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:24,057
- Just a test of the boosters.

768
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:26,828
I gotta make sure
this thing doesn't blow up

769
00:50:26,861 --> 00:50:28,295
when I turn it on.

770
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:31,198
This sucker is gonna prove
to the world

771
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:32,667
that I'm worth a damn.

772
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,536
Copley, here I come.

773
00:50:45,412 --> 00:50:47,849
Hey, I'm about to do a test
of the booster.

774
00:50:47,882 --> 00:50:49,249
You wanna check it out?
- Yeah.

775
00:50:49,283 --> 00:50:51,184
- I'll grab your coat.
- Oh, okay.

776
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,088
- Okay.
Here we are.

777
00:50:55,122 --> 00:50:57,224
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

778
00:50:57,257 --> 00:51:01,128
to a beautiful day
here in Fairview.

779
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:03,831
Not the most ideal conditions.

780
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:06,333
- No.
- But we are looking

781
00:51:06,366 --> 00:51:09,236
at a simple test
of the boosters.

782
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:10,270
Hold that, my friend.

783
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:14,474
Here we go.

784
00:51:16,878 --> 00:51:18,713
Ta-da!
- Whoa.

785
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:20,515
Oh.

786
00:51:20,548 --> 00:51:22,182
All right.

787
00:51:22,215 --> 00:51:24,484
Here we go.

788
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:28,322
♪ Duh, duh, duh,
duh, duh, duh ♪

789
00:51:28,355 --> 00:51:31,893
Just a test to the booster,
but here we go.

790
00:51:31,926 --> 00:51:34,294
Auxiliary power initiating.

791
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:39,199
Stand by.
- All right.

792
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:43,470
- Three, two, one.

793
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,211
- What?

794
00:51:51,244 --> 00:51:52,245
- Wait-

795
00:51:56,316 --> 00:51:57,518
Okay.

796
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:59,252
- What's going on?

797
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:01,488
- It's not working.

798
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:05,125
Oh, wow!

799
00:52:25,278 --> 00:52:28,348
Uh, h-hold this.

800
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:52,540
- The universe is factual.

801
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:57,277
It's objective, study-able,
and concrete.

802
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:02,315
It has no emotions
and no feelings.

803
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:05,787
The universe is rational.

804
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:14,327
Chemistry.

805
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,998
Mathematics.

806
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:19,534
Biology.

807
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:21,869
Earth sciences.

808
00:53:21,903 --> 00:53:23,771
Physics.

809
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:28,375
So come explore science

810
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:32,513
as we go "Above and Beyond."

811
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:38,720
What is an experiment?

812
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:42,322
An experiment
is a procedure carried out

813
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:47,394
to refute or validate
a hypothesis.

814
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:50,832
Experiments provide insight
into cause and effect

815
00:53:50,865 --> 00:53:54,669
by demonstrating
what outcomes occur

816
00:53:54,702 --> 00:53:57,772
when a particular factor
is manipulated.

817
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:59,607
- Cheers to that.

818
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,274
Thanks, Lin.

819
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:02,910
- It's just amazing.

820
00:54:02,944 --> 00:54:05,580
They're finally seeing
your potential.

821
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:12,285
What's wrong?

822
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,822
I just-

823
00:54:14,856 --> 00:54:19,026
I'm not sure
it's the right path for me.

824
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,563
You know, I think I was hoping
to transition into something

825
00:54:22,597 --> 00:54:27,034
hands-on like the technicians
department or...

826
00:54:27,068 --> 00:54:29,771
plus it's a two-hour commute
each way.

827
00:54:29,804 --> 00:54:31,371
And I don't even know
where I'm gonna be living

828
00:54:31,404 --> 00:54:33,406
once the divorce is finalized
in a couple months.

829
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,375
- But you said it yourself.

830
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:38,411
People wait their whole lives
for an opportunity like this.

831
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:40,447
- Yes.
Yes, I know.

832
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,415
I know.

833
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:45,318
- Are you worried
about Cameron?

834
00:54:45,352 --> 00:54:46,319
- No.

835
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:49,524
I mean, I think he should know
before I commit-

836
00:54:49,557 --> 00:54:52,492
- To be blunt,

837
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:54,095
he's really lost it.

838
00:54:54,128 --> 00:54:56,329
He's been sleeping in your
condemned house for weeks.

839
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:57,799
It's not rational.

840
00:54:57,832 --> 00:55:00,101
It'll be good for you
to get away from him.

841
00:55:00,134 --> 00:55:01,702
Start fresh.

842
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:06,073
Anyways, I'm just-
I'm really happy for you.

843
00:55:06,107 --> 00:55:08,643
You either take that job or...

844
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:11,378
go back
to the way things were.

845
00:55:13,648 --> 00:55:16,416
Well, I think we need
another refill here.

846
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:17,952
Maybe some champagne...

847
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:51,552
Sneaking out?

848
00:55:51,586 --> 00:55:53,688
- Nah, just going for a walk.

849
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:54,755
- Huh.

850
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:58,693
Usually, people use a door
for that kind of thing.

851
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,497
- I, uh, take it the test
didn't go so well, huh?

852
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:06,499
- Oh, it was a huge success.

853
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:08,836
Liquid oxygen froze
around the intake valve,

854
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:10,571
which built up pressure

855
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:13,708
until it popped
and sprayed everywhere.

856
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:15,710
Lit the garage on fire.

857
00:56:15,743 --> 00:56:17,377
- Hm.

858
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:23,684
At Cornell,

859
00:56:23,718 --> 00:56:27,188
I had published three articles
in the "Astrophysical Journal"

860
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:30,591
by the time I was 21.

861
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:32,627
Won the damn Crawford.

862
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:40,167
Now I'm stuck
building a DIY rocket

863
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:42,870
out of a hunk
of Apollo garbage

864
00:56:42,904 --> 00:56:45,907
just to prove
I'm worth a damn.

865
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:51,746
I'm almost 50 years old.

866
00:56:51,779 --> 00:56:55,116
Is that what I'm supposed
to be doing?

867
00:56:57,118 --> 00:56:59,553
Jesus.

868
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:02,523
Einstein came up
with the Theory of Relativity

869
00:57:02,556 --> 00:57:04,592
when he was 26.

870
00:57:08,162 --> 00:57:10,497
You know what I'm gonna
be known for?

871
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:15,636
A failed children's
television show...

872
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:22,076
And a rocket
that didn't lift off.

873
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:25,478
It's kind of poetic, really.

874
00:57:25,513 --> 00:57:28,683
Heed this warning:
do not grow old.

875
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:33,788
Huh.

876
00:57:38,993 --> 00:57:42,263
- Hey, it's that woman again.

877
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:43,597
- Yeah.

878
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:55,209
I don't know
if she's following me or you.

879
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:58,179
- Entropy,

880
00:57:58,212 --> 00:58:02,116
the gradual decaying of stuff.

881
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:03,884
Believe it or not, over time,

882
00:58:03,918 --> 00:58:06,620
we're all headed
towards chaos.

883
00:58:06,654 --> 00:58:08,522
The natural state
of the universe

884
00:58:08,556 --> 00:58:11,559
is, in fact, chaos, not order.

885
00:58:11,592 --> 00:58:13,294
- What are you doing awake?
- We can try to organize

886
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:15,696
our stuff and control it,

887
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,531
but in the end,

888
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:21,635
it will always find its way
back to chaos.

889
00:58:21,669 --> 00:58:23,637
- Well, that sounds kind of
harsh, don't you think, Erin?

890
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:26,207
- Oh, it's just
maximum entropy, Cam.

891
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,608
It's science!

892
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:34,281
Good evening, madam.

893
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:36,650
- Shut up.

894
00:58:36,684 --> 00:58:40,087
- Oh, hey.

895
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:41,789
- You good?

896
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:43,791
- Lookee what I got.

897
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:45,693
- What is this?

898
00:58:45,726 --> 00:58:48,129
I mangled it a bit. Sorry.

899
00:58:48,162 --> 00:58:51,165
"Darcy Penzone is having
a Halloween party."

900
00:58:53,667 --> 00:58:55,669
That's stupid.

901
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:57,204
- Do you want to go with?

902
00:58:57,238 --> 00:58:58,806
- No, definitely not.

903
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:01,709
Did she, like,
invite you or something?

904
00:59:01,742 --> 00:59:03,711
- Are you jealous again?

905
00:59:05,613 --> 00:59:08,682
- I mean, y-
kind of, yeah, I guess.

906
00:59:08,716 --> 00:59:11,719
- Oh, I thought
I wasn't your type.

907
00:59:11,752 --> 00:59:14,321
- No, I'm jealous
because she invited you

908
00:59:14,355 --> 00:59:15,556
and not me.

909
00:59:17,792 --> 00:59:19,794
- Huh.

910
00:59:19,827 --> 00:59:22,696
Are you sure you're gay?

911
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,632
- What?

912
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:26,967
What-yeah.

913
00:59:27,001 --> 00:59:28,836
Yes, I am.
I totally am.

914
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:31,906
- I mean, no judgment.
Just asking.

915
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:41,315
- I've never, uh-
I've never actually been

916
00:59:41,348 --> 00:59:44,618
with a guy before, so that's-

917
00:59:44,652 --> 00:59:46,253
yep, that's that.

918
00:59:46,287 --> 00:59:51,025
- So...have you been
with a girl before?

919
00:59:51,058 --> 00:59:54,295
- I made out with this girl
from Redding my freshman year.

920
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:56,664
Um, but it was like,

921
00:59:56,697 --> 00:59:58,299
some older dudes dared us to

922
00:59:58,332 --> 01:00:01,068
at this dumb
lacrosse party thing.

923
01:00:01,102 --> 01:00:02,403
- Could be some fun.

924
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:04,805
- I mean,
what did you expect, though,

925
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:06,273
asking that question,
whether I wanted

926
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:07,908
to go to Darcy Penzone's
Halloween party?

927
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:10,411
- I figured it would be a no,

928
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:12,813
but of course I'm gonna ask.

929
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:14,181
- Wow, well,
that's very polite of you.

930
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:16,383
Um, but the answer
is still no.

931
01:00:16,417 --> 01:00:17,418
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

932
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:19,954
Because I hate her guts.

933
01:00:19,987 --> 01:00:22,656
Like...

934
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,225
people wanna put you
in a box, you know,

935
01:00:24,258 --> 01:00:27,428
like, a category and...

936
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:29,897
Like, I've tried
to do that too, but, um,

937
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,832
it just-

938
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:33,667
it just seems to make it
simpler for everyone else

939
01:00:33,701 --> 01:00:36,770
and, like, way more
complicated for me.

940
01:00:36,804 --> 01:00:38,839
And I try not to care
what they think, but I do.

941
01:00:38,873 --> 01:00:40,107
I-I definitely do.

942
01:00:40,141 --> 01:00:41,742
I just, um-

943
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:42,843
in the end, it's just easier

944
01:00:42,877 --> 01:00:45,346
to go along with it all,
you know?

945
01:00:45,379 --> 01:00:47,781
But I don't know if that's
how, like, I actually feel.

946
01:00:47,815 --> 01:00:51,919
Like, I don't even know
if I have a preference.

947
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:53,821
Like, if that's even a thing.

948
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:56,724
I just, um...

949
01:00:56,757 --> 01:00:59,760
still figuring it out
or whatever.

950
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:05,666
- Hm.

951
01:01:07,902 --> 01:01:12,439
Well, I mean, I like to wear
girls' underwear sometimes.

952
01:01:12,473 --> 01:01:14,375
- You do?
- Yeah.

953
01:01:14,408 --> 01:01:17,945
So, see,
nothing is really that simple.

954
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:21,882
Plus, if it helps, I've never
been with anyone before.

955
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:24,952
So there's that.

956
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:26,754
- Really?
You?

957
01:01:26,787 --> 01:01:28,055
I thought
you would've already.

958
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:29,456
- Why's that?

959
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,492
- Because.

960
01:01:31,526 --> 01:01:34,995
Because you're...

961
01:01:35,029 --> 01:01:36,430
cute.

962
01:01:41,435 --> 01:01:43,771
- Wow.
- Shut up, dude.

963
01:01:43,804 --> 01:01:47,341
- A bona fide compliment
from the bisexual in the room.

964
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:48,375
I mean,
you can't take it back.

965
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:49,810
- No, that was a-
- There's no take-backsies.

966
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:55,783
I guess you're right then.
It's just, uh-

967
01:01:55,816 --> 01:01:58,819
it's not that simple,
is it, huh?

968
01:01:58,852 --> 01:02:01,488
- Maybe it should be.

969
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:03,357
You know?

970
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:07,895
Simply put,

971
01:02:07,928 --> 01:02:10,197
we don't fit in,

972
01:02:10,231 --> 01:02:13,834
probably never will,
but that's okay.

973
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:17,171
It's all up here, right,
in the mind?

974
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:19,139
So-
- Cheers

975
01:02:19,173 --> 01:02:21,175
to our abnormal future.

976
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,210
- Oh.

977
01:02:23,244 --> 01:02:26,514
May it always be fantastic.

978
01:02:26,548 --> 01:02:29,016
- Fantastic.
I like it.

979
01:02:30,985 --> 01:02:32,786
No.

980
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:33,821
Nope. No.

981
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:35,923
There's no way
I'm spending my-

982
01:02:35,956 --> 01:02:37,791
nay, our birthday,

983
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:40,861
what, at Darcy Penzone's
Halloween party?

984
01:02:40,894 --> 01:02:42,263
No.
No.

985
01:02:44,398 --> 01:02:47,101
Because we...

986
01:02:47,134 --> 01:02:49,803
should throw our own party.

987
01:02:49,837 --> 01:02:51,872
A, um-

988
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:54,942
a fantastic party.

989
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:58,946
Well, go on.

990
01:02:58,979 --> 01:03:02,416
- A more fantastic
Halloween party.

991
01:03:02,449 --> 01:03:04,018
- Thanks.

992
01:03:07,555 --> 01:03:09,890
- "Fantastic Halloween party"?

993
01:03:09,923 --> 01:03:11,992
What does that even mean?

994
01:03:12,026 --> 01:03:14,194
- It's, like,
totally over your head.

995
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:16,997
Don't worry.

996
01:03:17,031 --> 01:03:18,332
- Are you going to this?

997
01:03:18,365 --> 01:03:20,602
- Yeah.
I'm organizing it.

998
01:03:20,635 --> 01:03:21,935
You should come.

999
01:03:24,872 --> 01:03:27,007
I can't believe this.
Okay.

1000
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:29,176
No one's gonna go
to your dykey party

1001
01:03:29,209 --> 01:03:31,945
because they're gonna
come to mine.

1002
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:33,113
- Oh, I didn't know

1003
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:34,848
that you were throwing
a dykey party too.

1004
01:03:34,882 --> 01:03:36,050
I'm sorry.

1005
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:38,586
- You're just so funny.

1006
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:39,820
- Thanks.

1007
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:46,260
I thought it was funny.
- Well, it was worth a shot.

1008
01:03:46,293 --> 01:03:47,461
- Yeah.

1009
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:16,323
- Hey.
- What the hell happened

1010
01:04:16,357 --> 01:04:17,458
to our garage?

1011
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:19,860
- It was, um...

1012
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,065
- What is this, Cameron?

1013
01:04:26,568 --> 01:04:28,902
- I was building-

1014
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:31,238
I was trying
to build a rocket.

1015
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:36,110
- A rocket?

1016
01:04:36,143 --> 01:04:38,145
In the garage?

1017
01:04:38,178 --> 01:04:41,081
- Yeah.
But it clearly didn't work.

1018
01:04:41,115 --> 01:04:42,383
So-
- Cameron.

1019
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:46,186
This is insane.

1020
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,522
What are you
even talking about?

1021
01:04:47,555 --> 01:04:49,624
This-it's breaking the law.

1022
01:04:49,657 --> 01:04:52,326
- Since when did you care
about rules so much?

1023
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:53,961
- Well, someone had to.

1024
01:04:53,994 --> 01:04:55,597
- Look, I'll fix it all back.
It's-

1025
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:58,198
- Oh, really?

1026
01:04:58,232 --> 01:05:00,535
- Erin.

1027
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:03,036
- I-I don't-

1028
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:06,006
I just wanted to-

1029
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:10,077
I came here to talk to you
about a job, Cameron.

1030
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,614
I got a job offer
at the Wright-Patterson,

1031
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:14,649
and I just wanted
to get your...

1032
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:16,049
- Well, that's great.
- I don't know,

1033
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,519
get your second opinion
or whatever.

1034
01:05:17,552 --> 01:05:19,621
I just wanted to talk to you.

1035
01:05:21,723 --> 01:05:22,724
But I can't

1036
01:05:22,757 --> 01:05:24,958
'cause I don't know
where you are.

1037
01:05:38,472 --> 01:05:43,377
- This is the second law
of thermodynamics,

1038
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,045
and I bring this up

1039
01:05:45,078 --> 01:05:46,548
because I know
you might be thinking,

1040
01:05:46,581 --> 01:05:50,652
"Dr. Fuller,
this is a math class.

1041
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:52,019
"Come on.

1042
01:05:52,052 --> 01:05:53,755
Why are we learning
about science?"

1043
01:05:53,788 --> 01:05:59,026
Well,
this law impacts statistics,

1044
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:02,597
game theory,
systems, analytics,

1045
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,132
and even parts of linguistics.

1046
01:06:05,165 --> 01:06:07,034
It is essential

1047
01:06:07,067 --> 01:06:09,470
for understanding
how things work

1048
01:06:09,503 --> 01:06:12,372
and even how people think.

1049
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:19,046
But it's not as easy
to predict

1050
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:20,682
as you might imagine.

1051
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,086
All right, class.
Come on. Settle down.

1052
01:06:57,284 --> 01:06:59,486
- You really stepped
in there, huh?

1053
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:00,487
- Yeah, well,

1054
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:03,056
you probably would've
killed her if I didn't.

1055
01:07:04,592 --> 01:07:06,226
- That's a great point.

1056
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:11,331
You okay?

1057
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:19,641
- I don't even know
where to start.

1058
01:07:19,674 --> 01:07:20,708
What were you thinking?

1059
01:07:20,742 --> 01:07:22,242
- That those kids
were assholes.

1060
01:07:22,276 --> 01:07:23,477
I was sick of it.
- Look, maybe that wasn't

1061
01:07:23,511 --> 01:07:24,512
the best option.

1062
01:07:24,546 --> 01:07:26,079
- Yeah, sure.
- Sure?

1063
01:07:26,113 --> 01:07:28,282
This is going to be
on your permanent record,

1064
01:07:28,315 --> 01:07:30,217
and you have a 4.0.

1065
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,519
For Christ's sakes,

1066
01:07:31,553 --> 01:07:33,655
you have your interview
with MIT next month.

1067
01:07:33,688 --> 01:07:35,690
Do you just wanna
ruin all of that?

1068
01:07:35,723 --> 01:07:39,126
I-I am trying to understand
what has gotten into you.

1069
01:07:39,159 --> 01:07:41,128
- You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

1070
01:07:41,161 --> 01:07:42,764
- Is it the new boy
that you've been dating?

1071
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:44,164
- You don't even know him,
and no,

1072
01:07:44,197 --> 01:07:46,133
we're not-we're not dating.

1073
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:47,267
- Okay, fine, not dating.

1074
01:07:47,301 --> 01:07:48,201
Is it the new boy

1075
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:50,538
you have been sneaking out
at night to see?

1076
01:07:50,572 --> 01:07:52,306
- He-he's a real
good kid actually.

1077
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:53,440
- Oh, is he?

1078
01:07:53,473 --> 01:07:56,711
Then I'm sure his father
is actually upset with him.

1079
01:07:56,744 --> 01:07:59,212
- God, this is bullshit.
- Don't use that language.

1080
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:01,583
- No, I'll do whatever I want.
- I am not going to permit you

1081
01:08:01,616 --> 01:08:02,517
to hang out
with that boy anymore.

1082
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,117
- They're just friends.
- You have no say

1083
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:05,118
in this anymore, Cameron.

1084
01:08:05,152 --> 01:08:07,789
Really? When I leave,
do whatever you want.

1085
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:08,756
- Leaving?
What the hell is that about?

1086
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:11,191
- Apparently,
I'm the only one in this car

1087
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:13,160
who's even remotely
rational anymore.

1088
01:08:13,193 --> 01:08:14,729
- Rational?
Is that what you've become?

1089
01:08:14,762 --> 01:08:16,330
That's what you call it,
is rational?

1090
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:17,464
- That's enough.
- You're not rational.

1091
01:08:17,497 --> 01:08:19,767
- That is enough.

1092
01:08:19,801 --> 01:08:21,168
- How did you marry
this woman?

1093
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:23,203
I mean, like, seriously,
all she ever does

1094
01:08:23,236 --> 01:08:25,305
is sit around and complain
like some old lady.

1095
01:08:25,339 --> 01:08:26,574
- Fuck you!

1096
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,127
- So...

1097
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:53,635
What happened?

1098
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:57,939
- Nothing.
- Hm.

1099
01:08:57,972 --> 01:09:02,342
They don't send you home
for nothing.

1100
01:09:02,376 --> 01:09:04,211
- It was just a stupid fight.

1101
01:09:15,255 --> 01:09:19,292
- Is it the girl you've been
hanging out with?

1102
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:22,362
- No, sir.
It's not her.

1103
01:09:22,396 --> 01:09:23,665
- Oh.

1104
01:09:56,430 --> 01:09:59,801
I don't want you hanging out
with that girl anymore.

1105
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,304
Do you understand?

1106
01:10:06,741 --> 01:10:08,375
- Yes, sir.

1107
01:10:22,289 --> 01:10:24,291
- You're doing this
to yourself.

1108
01:10:33,366 --> 01:10:37,370
If I see you with that queer
one more time,

1109
01:10:37,404 --> 01:10:38,606
I'll kill you.

1110
01:11:12,372 --> 01:11:14,307
Let me try an experiment.

1111
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:15,643
Say I take a rubber band

1112
01:11:15,676 --> 01:11:17,745
and I stretch it out
between my finger.

1113
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:21,048
This creates
stored potential energy.

1114
01:11:21,082 --> 01:11:23,785
Now, really,
energy is the only thing

1115
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:25,953
that can counteract...

1116
01:11:25,987 --> 01:11:27,655
The effects of entropy.

1117
01:11:27,688 --> 01:11:28,890
Now, let's take a look-

1118
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,434
Thanks, buddy.

1119
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:42,804
How you doing?

1120
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:20,942
- I can't believe I said that.

1121
01:12:20,975 --> 01:12:22,877
Who does that?

1122
01:12:57,178 --> 01:12:59,379
What's happening, Cameron?

1123
01:13:06,153 --> 01:13:08,656
- Sometimes,
things just happen.

1124
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:13,426
- It's not that simple.

1125
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:23,571
- I think it might be,
actually.

1126
01:13:51,232 --> 01:13:53,634
- Want some?

1127
01:13:53,668 --> 01:13:54,902
- Yeah.

1128
01:14:18,893 --> 01:14:22,096
- So you're leaving?

1129
01:14:22,129 --> 01:14:24,065
- I got a job offer
at Wright-Patt.

1130
01:14:24,098 --> 01:14:27,768
- Wow.
Congratulations, yeah.

1131
01:14:30,838 --> 01:14:33,808
- I'm not gonna go.

1132
01:14:33,841 --> 01:14:34,909
- Why not?

1133
01:14:34,942 --> 01:14:37,945
- Because it's
someone else's dream.

1134
01:14:43,117 --> 01:14:46,120
- Um,

1135
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:48,756
I'm-

1136
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:51,125
I'm sorry about before.

1137
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:53,527
- You have nothing
to be sorry for.

1138
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:54,996
I'm the one
that needs to apologize.

1139
01:14:55,029 --> 01:14:58,733
I said something that
I so wish I could take back.

1140
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:08,843
- I don't know what I'm doing.

1141
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:11,545
- So what?

1142
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:14,615
Who cares?

1143
01:15:14,648 --> 01:15:16,183
- Yeah.

1144
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,656
- You are gonna be just fine.

1145
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:25,826
You are intelligent
and so confident

1146
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,696
and strong-willed

1147
01:15:28,729 --> 01:15:32,333
and one of the most
loyal people

1148
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:34,168
on this Earth.

1149
01:15:35,636 --> 01:15:39,106
And yeah, there's gonna be
some ups and downs,

1150
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:41,675
but I can tell you

1151
01:15:41,709 --> 01:15:44,145
that no matter
what you choose to do

1152
01:15:44,178 --> 01:15:48,649
or who you choose to be,

1153
01:15:48,682 --> 01:15:50,684
it'll be the right decision.

1154
01:15:54,388 --> 01:15:56,590
- Thanks.

1155
01:15:59,894 --> 01:16:01,896
Can I ask you something?

1156
01:16:05,232 --> 01:16:07,635
What did you wanna be
when you grew up?

1157
01:16:11,038 --> 01:16:13,641
What was your dream?

1158
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:05,920
- Hey.

1159
01:18:05,953 --> 01:18:08,989
I, uh-

1160
01:18:09,023 --> 01:18:10,858
I nabbed it from the museum.

1161
01:18:10,891 --> 01:18:13,460
It's pretty cool, huh?

1162
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:16,830
- What are you doing?

1163
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:21,001
- Something fantastic.

1164
01:18:25,472 --> 01:18:27,875
Aw, Merry Christmas
to you too, Cam.

1165
01:18:27,908 --> 01:18:30,344
- Well,
it's not Christmas yet, Erin,

1166
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:32,012
- Oh, but you were talking
about the north pole.

1167
01:18:32,046 --> 01:18:34,114
- It's Halloween.

1168
01:18:34,148 --> 01:18:36,016
- All right, well,
where's your costume then?

1169
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:37,051
- Hey, I'm home.

1170
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:39,186
- I think I'm pale
like a ghost.

1171
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,854
Our planet is filled...

1172
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:42,923
- Hello?
- With liquid molten metals.

1173
01:18:42,957 --> 01:18:44,058
- Ooh, spooky.

1174
01:18:44,091 --> 01:18:46,528
- It's my birthday, you know.
- Which turn our planet

1175
01:18:46,561 --> 01:18:50,798
into an enormous magnet.

1176
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:53,968
But our planet
isn't the only thing

1177
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:56,370
with a magnetic field.

1178
01:18:56,403 --> 01:18:58,072
Am I right, Erin?

1179
01:18:58,105 --> 01:19:01,775
- That's right, Cam.
The sun also has one.

1180
01:19:01,809 --> 01:19:05,913
And the sun's magnetic field
is much more powerful.

1181
01:19:05,946 --> 01:19:07,881
It can cause sunspots--
- Always leaving

1182
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:09,917
this dang thing on.

1183
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:13,320
- Television screen go fuzz-

1184
01:19:13,354 --> 01:19:15,289
- Hey, where is, everyone?

1185
01:19:15,322 --> 01:19:17,891
- Cameron is being
completely irrational.

1186
01:19:17,925 --> 01:19:20,294
And it seems
Erin has joined him.

1187
01:19:43,984 --> 01:19:46,554
- Well, you won't technically
have a display console,

1188
01:19:46,588 --> 01:19:47,589
but you know what?

1189
01:19:47,622 --> 01:19:49,923
Neither did John Glenn.

1190
01:19:49,957 --> 01:19:51,191
- John Glenn?
Never heard of him.

1191
01:19:51,225 --> 01:19:53,193
What are we gonna do
about propulsion?

1192
01:19:53,227 --> 01:19:54,495
- Oh, this thing
actually still had

1193
01:19:54,529 --> 01:19:56,830
a significant store
of liquid H2 in it.

1194
01:19:56,864 --> 01:19:57,965
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

1195
01:19:57,998 --> 01:20:00,200
I think it might be enough
to get you to the L point.

1196
01:20:00,234 --> 01:20:02,403
- It might be?

1197
01:20:02,436 --> 01:20:04,405
Well, that's a relief.
That is-it might be.

1198
01:20:04,438 --> 01:20:06,608
- Well, what are you gonna do?
Siphon gas out of the wagon?

1199
01:20:06,641 --> 01:20:08,008
It's gonna be fine.

1200
01:20:08,042 --> 01:20:10,244
- This is so crazy.
- Yeah.

1201
01:20:10,277 --> 01:20:12,012
- No, I agree with Cameron
on this one.

1202
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:13,947
- Hi. Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1203
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:15,617
- Great.
Thanks.

1204
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:17,951
Um, I'm decorating the house.

1205
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:18,787
I'm having a Halloween party.

1206
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:20,522
So obviously,
you're not invited.

1207
01:20:20,555 --> 01:20:21,855
Please don't come.
- Obviously.

1208
01:20:21,889 --> 01:20:23,390
Where's your witch costume?

1209
01:20:23,424 --> 01:20:25,326
- Um, yeah,
Darcy Penzone decided

1210
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:28,162
to dress as a witch today too,
so now I am costume-less.

1211
01:20:28,195 --> 01:20:29,963
- Sorry.
What are you gonna do?

1212
01:20:29,997 --> 01:20:31,265
- I was gonna
raid your closet.

1213
01:20:31,298 --> 01:20:33,901
- Sure.
Yes, of course.

1214
01:20:33,934 --> 01:20:36,003
You could just go as yourself.

1215
01:20:36,036 --> 01:20:37,572
- No.

1216
01:20:37,605 --> 01:20:40,974
- She's like a bundle
of positivity.

1217
01:20:41,008 --> 01:20:42,009
What about over here?

1218
01:21:26,153 --> 01:21:27,988
- You made it.

1219
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:31,325
- A dress?

1220
01:21:31,358 --> 01:21:34,495
- Oh, well, I mean, sort of.

1221
01:21:34,529 --> 01:21:37,064
It's my worst nightmare,
a housewife.

1222
01:21:37,097 --> 01:21:39,466
- Yeah. I mean, yeah,
you look horrific.

1223
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,568
- Wow.
Thank you.

1224
01:21:40,602 --> 01:21:43,404
- I mean, fantastic.

1225
01:21:43,437 --> 01:21:45,205
- It's for you.

1226
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:47,408
Come on, let's, uh,
find you a costume.

1227
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:48,576
Party's about to start.

1228
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:50,545
- You have an extra?

1229
01:21:58,385 --> 01:22:00,954
- Honey, where is everyone?

1230
01:22:00,988 --> 01:22:03,157
I-I thought the party
started at eight.

1231
01:22:11,165 --> 01:22:13,233
- Okay.

1232
01:22:13,267 --> 01:22:16,003
I think this is ready to go.

1233
01:22:16,036 --> 01:22:20,174
Come on.
Let's get it outside.

1234
01:22:20,207 --> 01:22:22,109
Cameron.

1235
01:22:25,412 --> 01:22:26,980
Cameron.

1236
01:22:27,014 --> 01:22:29,082
Cameron.

1237
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:36,223
- Open your eyes.

1238
01:22:36,256 --> 01:22:37,958
- Cameron.

1239
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:40,662
- Yeah.

1240
01:22:52,707 --> 01:22:54,542
- Are you sure
you wanna do this?

1241
01:22:59,046 --> 01:23:01,181
- The launch isn't
gonna happen, okay?

1242
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,620
It's not gonna work.

1243
01:23:05,653 --> 01:23:07,622
It didn't work.

1244
01:23:07,655 --> 01:23:12,426
I can't launch a rocket
from our garage.

1245
01:23:12,459 --> 01:23:15,162
It's-
- Not that simple.

1246
01:23:16,664 --> 01:23:19,634
Why do you always
tell yourself that?

1247
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:31,646
- I just wanted
to do something...

1248
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:33,313
you know.

1249
01:23:41,121 --> 01:23:42,289
- Do you know what that is?

1250
01:23:42,322 --> 01:23:44,191
- I know
what a Moebius strip is.

1251
01:23:44,224 --> 01:23:47,327
- It only has one side.

1252
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:51,131
Yeah.
It's a mathematical paradox.

1253
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:53,835
- It's not that simple.
- Oh, it might be.

1254
01:23:53,868 --> 01:23:56,236
Who knows?

1255
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:58,305
- It happened on my birthday.

1256
01:24:01,809 --> 01:24:03,243
- What did?

1257
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:10,250
- Cameron.

1258
01:24:20,728 --> 01:24:22,362
You remember me?

1259
01:24:29,369 --> 01:24:32,372
- Does that mean
anything to you?

1260
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:41,281
- Can I come to your
stupid party or whatever?

1261
01:24:44,586 --> 01:24:46,654
- Under one condition:

1262
01:24:46,688 --> 01:24:49,156
you take our photo.

1263
01:24:50,457 --> 01:24:52,192
- Whatever.

1264
01:24:52,225 --> 01:24:54,428
Fine.
Out here.

1265
01:25:02,202 --> 01:25:06,406
- It's all up here

1266
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,176
in the mind.

1267
01:25:09,209 --> 01:25:10,612
You understand?

1268
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,896
- I said, can you open
your eyes for me, Cameron?

1269
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:27,722
You're looking good.

1270
01:26:31,324 --> 01:26:32,960
Do you know who I am?

1271
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:38,231
Cameron.

1272
01:26:44,304 --> 01:26:46,206
Do you know who I am?

1273
01:26:52,747 --> 01:26:55,348
- I might.

1274
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:05,026
- Do you recognize
any of this stuff?

1275
01:27:24,478 --> 01:27:27,347
Here.

1276
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:30,551
Do you know who this is?

1277
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:35,957
That's you, Cameron.

1278
01:27:39,493 --> 01:27:41,294
Over 50 years ago.

1279
01:27:44,766 --> 01:27:48,502
And that's me.

1280
01:28:03,951 --> 01:28:06,453
Do you recognize this photo?

1281
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:22,469
- Sam.

1282
01:28:24,539 --> 01:28:26,473
- Sam?
- Yeah.

1283
01:28:28,509 --> 01:28:30,343
- Sam isn't in this picture.

1284
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:36,383
He was stillborn.
Remember?

1285
01:28:43,124 --> 01:28:46,127
- Swiss mathematician
Daniel Bernoulli...

1286
01:28:54,168 --> 01:28:58,973
We never knew
what he would look like.

1287
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:02,109
- The brain is actually
clogging up

1288
01:29:02,143 --> 01:29:05,445
like plaque on teeth

1289
01:29:05,478 --> 01:29:08,381
without a brain toothbrush.

1290
01:29:13,187 --> 01:29:17,592
- I think I know
what's happening.

1291
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:20,761
- I think you do too.

1292
01:29:20,795 --> 01:29:22,395
- I'm scared.

1293
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:27,835
- I'm here.

1294
01:29:31,572 --> 01:29:33,608
I'll always be here.

1295
01:29:49,657 --> 01:29:53,594
I show you these things
every day.

1296
01:29:53,628 --> 01:29:56,063
How we met,

1297
01:29:56,097 --> 01:29:57,698
our life together.

1298
01:29:57,732 --> 01:30:00,001
This week's
scientific discovery is...

1299
01:30:00,034 --> 01:30:04,005
Rockets!

1300
01:30:04,038 --> 01:30:06,540
- Over there, there's-there's
somebody over there for you.

1301
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:37,772
Do you know who I am?

1302
01:30:42,743 --> 01:30:46,013
Erin.

1303
01:30:46,047 --> 01:30:48,448
- Mm-hmm.
- Hi, Cam.

1304
01:30:50,184 --> 01:30:53,621
You've been here
a few weeks now.

1305
01:30:59,593 --> 01:31:01,696
Oh.

1306
01:31:01,729 --> 01:31:03,264
Your father's car.

1307
01:31:11,672 --> 01:31:13,674
Do you remember your father?

1308
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:22,116
He tried to run you over
at our Halloween party.

1309
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,756
Do you remember that?

1310
01:31:28,789 --> 01:31:30,791
Cameron?

1311
01:31:45,306 --> 01:31:46,807
Cameron?

1312
01:31:53,347 --> 01:31:55,182
- This is the end, isn't it?

1313
01:31:55,216 --> 01:31:58,552
- Don't worry. Don't worry.
The doctor's on his way.

1314
01:31:58,586 --> 01:32:00,988
- It's about to happen.

1315
01:32:01,022 --> 01:32:02,857
- What is?

1316
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:04,692
- The launch.

1317
01:32:28,082 --> 01:32:30,317
The launch.
It's about to happen.

1318
01:32:30,351 --> 01:32:32,953
- No, there-
there was no rocket launch.

1319
01:32:32,987 --> 01:32:34,655
I told you that, remember?

1320
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,590
- Time is running out, Erin.

1321
01:32:36,624 --> 01:32:37,758
We have to go.
Help me.

1322
01:32:37,792 --> 01:32:39,060
- I'm sorry.
- Help me.

1323
01:32:39,093 --> 01:32:41,762
- I'm sorry.
I can't. I can't.

1324
01:32:41,796 --> 01:32:43,697
- With the rocket.

1325
01:32:43,731 --> 01:32:45,032
- Oh, Cameron.
- The rocket.

1326
01:32:45,066 --> 01:32:47,368
- The rocket-

1327
01:33:02,383 --> 01:33:03,684
The rocket is coming.

1328
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:12,660
It's coming.

1329
01:33:22,837 --> 01:33:26,974
Come on! Cameron, hurry up.
The countdown has started.

1330
01:33:30,211 --> 01:33:32,947
Don't you worry, love.

1331
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:35,716
I'll make sure
it's there for you.

1332
01:34:03,277 --> 01:34:05,146
- Thank you.

1333
01:34:22,863 --> 01:34:24,031
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.
You can't go with him.

1334
01:34:24,064 --> 01:34:25,833
- Oh, I'm going with him.

1335
01:34:28,802 --> 01:34:31,839
- Two seats?
- Yeah. I'm coming with you.

1336
01:34:38,846 --> 01:34:40,948
- But you don't have a suit.

1337
01:34:40,981 --> 01:34:42,683
- I'll be okay.

1338
01:35:41,543 --> 01:35:43,811
- Close your eyes.

1339
01:35:43,844 --> 01:35:44,778
- Go ahead.

1340
01:35:46,447 --> 01:35:48,816
Most people think
it's just a black abyss,

1341
01:35:48,849 --> 01:35:51,452
but in fact,
the universe appears.

1342
01:35:55,456 --> 01:35:57,825
- Look closely.

1343
01:35:57,858 --> 01:35:59,293
Do you see it?

1344
01:36:00,961 --> 01:36:03,864
- It's faint, but...

1345
01:36:03,897 --> 01:36:06,267
it's there if you concentrate.

1346
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:10,204
- It's probably colorful
and shifting.

1347
01:36:10,237 --> 01:36:13,274
- It's evolving and growing.

1348
01:36:13,307 --> 01:36:15,476
Do you see it?

1349
01:36:18,012 --> 01:36:21,315
- What you're seeing
is entirely unique to you.

1350
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:28,889
- It's a kind of fingerprint,

1351
01:36:28,922 --> 01:36:31,959
your own personal universe.

1352
01:36:44,371 --> 01:36:46,006
- I used to look up to you.

1353
01:36:53,247 --> 01:36:56,518
I used to act like you,

1354
01:36:56,551 --> 01:36:58,586
dress like you.

1355
01:37:00,522 --> 01:37:02,956
I wanted to be you.

1356
01:37:04,358 --> 01:37:05,959
- I know.

1357
01:37:05,993 --> 01:37:08,429
- Then why did you do it?

1358
01:37:11,599 --> 01:37:14,001
- You did this to yourself.

1359
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:17,304
- That's not true.

1360
01:37:21,909 --> 01:37:24,345
Things are gonna be
different this time.

1361
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:26,340
Now, open your eyes.
