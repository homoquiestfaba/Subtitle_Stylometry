in Las Vegas at a convention,

and she was outside the casino.

pats her on the head,

261

stuffs a 50 in her hand,
and then runs away

262
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,923

give it back.

with their dad.

353
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,729
Oh, really?

354
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,102
His new house
has a pond,

355
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,903
and we're gonna swim
and catch leeches and stuff.

356
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,501
And we're not afraid
of those leeches, are we?

357
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,568
Not any more.

358
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,977
(CHUCKLES)
FRANK: Hey, Jim.

359
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,540
Oh, hi, Frank.

360
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,014
Oh, I don't know, ...

361
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,245
I can't get that
Nintendo working.

362
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,219
Well, thanks
for trying.

363
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,848
I wish you'd stay and have
dinner with Daniel and Josie.

364
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:41,485
Oh, nothing I'd like better,
but no can do.

365
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,962
Did I hear we're still going
on about those leeches?

366
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,192
Nope. It's all over
and settled.

367
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,565
Because, as I said, there couldn't
be that many in a spring-fed pond.

368
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,297
Anyway, all you have to remember
about leeches... Okay, Dad, it's settled.

369
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,203
You know, in the Seabees,
we used to burn "em off with cigarettes...

370
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,434
Okay, Dad, thank you!

371
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,907
Don't shush me, Megan.

372
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,675
I'm trying to explain
to the child

373
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,008
there's absolutely nothing
to be afraid of.

374
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,411

375
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,673

377
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,382

378
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,717

379
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,259
Mmm-hmm.

380
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,385

our turn driving carpool.

381
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,753

382

383

384

FRANK: Jim, uh,

386
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,803
I have to apologize for my
nephew's behavior the other day.

387
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,111
I guess every family
has its Swamp Thing.

388
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,581

you didn't have a job.

389
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,055

you were available.

390
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,092
Oh, available.
Excuse me.

391
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,217
Well, aren't you?

392
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,592
I do not need
a personal manager.

393
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:53,564
Stop repeating yourself.
You're so proud of that line.

394
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,025
Well, what's his problem,
anyway?

395
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,296
Patrick is very sweet,
and bright.

396
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,739
He's written
great screenplays,

397
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,004
which, of course,
Hollywood doesn't get.

398
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,536
He graduated the highest ever
in Peace Corps language training.

399
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,345
He's lived in Africa
and, and Russia.

400
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,851
He gave me
a phrase book.

401
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,317
Well, he speaks
it fluently.

402
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,688
He was one of the first capitalists
in there after the '91 coup.

403
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:19,816
He knows Yeltsin.

404
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,657
I could tell
from his driving.

405
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,422
You two were
always so close?

406
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,161
I was in love with him.

407
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:30,703
He was my big cousin,
you know?

408
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,539

about your marriage.

409

I don't know.

415
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:54,183
He's a very angry man.
More so every year.

417

418
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,030
Well, speaking of kids,
yours are terrific.

419
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,299
They're much more responsible
and self-assured

420
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,862
than most children
their age.

421
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,500
Well, they've had to be.

422
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,566
But thank you.

423
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,871

424
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,978

425
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,043
Well...

426
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:25,022
Kit's a great person,
and the whole thing convinced me

427
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:28,755
that I just don't want those
kinds of complications in my life.

428
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,023
Especially not at this age.

429
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,460
Boy, I'm with you there.

430
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,366

431
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,511

Oh, how's the cyst?

432
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,910
You want to see it?

433
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,976
I'd have nothing
to compare it to.

434
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,521

with a window.

435
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,818
Listen, I, I was just
wondering,

436
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,258
if possibly you could
do me a favor?

437
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:02,852
I'm gonna say this again,

438
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,362
it's not the same
old department.

you might be happy to see me working again.

447

448

"Why Katerina Stepashin?"

00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,683
I'm so sorry
about all of this.

878
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,412
Jim, what
they did to you...

879
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,751
You've got no reason I can
remember to call me Jim.

880
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,658
Koblets blames you for
not getting Miss Stepashin's

881
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,025
career on track.
Is that the assumption?

882
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:33,887
Yeah.

883
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:38,129
Things started out mediocre,
then promptly went in the toilet.

884
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,872
Ykaterina finally
split on Gennady.

885
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:46,238
That's when Mr. Dougherty hired
me to try and salvage the situation.

886
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,869
I felt bad for the guy.

887
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,413
Then he does this to Molly

888
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,143
to get back at me?

889
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,852
Koblets and Miss Stepashin hit LA,
they seek you out for representation,

890
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,982
and your fee is,
what, the usual 15%?

891
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,783
Yeah.

892
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:03,917
Well, uh...

893
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:07,088
Well what?

894
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,791
Well,

895
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:11,767
I was forced to ask Gennady
for 100,000 cash.

896
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,804
I told him I could
deliver a Golden Globe.

897
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,670
See, Ykaterina's movie,
The Guard Shack,

898
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:22,179
had a little heat on it from
the Azerbaijan Film Festival.

899
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:23,645
Oh, Patrick.

900
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,411
I'm in litigation on my
screenplay, Megs.

901
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,953
I owed $40,000 on
those overcoats.

902
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,886
The Golden Globe
isn't for sale.

903

Megs...

905
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,625
It's not my best
judgment call, I know.

906
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,570
But I am doing pretty
good at this.

907
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:52,342
Don't tell Uncle Frank about
the Golden Globe thing.

908
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,809
Oh, Patrick.

909
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:57,609

your problems right now.

a minor concussion.

if I still have the gig.

have a car any more.

he owes me two days' pay.

you something.

you sound? How I sound?

like that. He wasn't always this way.

Oh, big so what?

945
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:57,594
After high school, Patrick was accepted
at Harvard on a National Merit Scholarship,

946
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:01,161
SATs in the high 15s. There's
no shortage of fools at Harvard.

947
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,798
Especially Harvard. Everything he
achieved he did it all without a father.

948
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,308
Oh, he had your dad.

949
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:07,367
Yeah.

950
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:09,846

I'm sorry.

952

me to talk about.

953
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,150
It's all right.

954
00:49:18,222 --> 00:49:19,656
I should
probably tell you.

My parents

956
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:26,823

house in Sun Valley.

957

don't talk about it.

there we were,

959
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:34,163

friends of my parents,

960
00:49:34,238 --> 00:49:38,141

and roommates from school.

961
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:43,879

I was there,

sisters, assorted boyfriends.

967
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,826

named Tony Herndon.

969
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,832

gold flecks in his eyes,

970
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:12,842

was so amazing.

he made his
first suicide attempt.

991

like this, I'd kill myself.

but I was 15,

way to stop him from hurting himself.

01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:24,780
His girlfriend
is on the way over,

1392
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,652
they're gonna meet,
and they're gonna take off

1393
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,019
like a couple
of free birds.

1394
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,353
So?

1395
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:31,553
LA is bigger
than both our butts

1396
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:32,617

1397
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:35,525
Two Russians
from Minsk, Pinsk,

1398
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:38,863
they just find a motel
where Patrick is hiding out?

1399
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:47,469
Tell ya,
that Megan Adams.

1400
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:50,945
One beautiful woman.

1401
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:52,037
It's over, Dennis.

1402
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,513

She's getting married again.

01:16:04,093 --> 01:16:05,151
How about lunch?

1406
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:07,223

all scraped off!

Ow!

1419
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,975
Whose dog is that?

1420
01:16:55,044 --> 01:16:57,206
I can't keep him, Jimmy.
Not at my place.

1421
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,542
It's not fair to him.

1422
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,946
Oh, when did you
start sharing your oxygen

1423
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:02,541
with another life form?

1424
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:04,209
(GROANS)

1425
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,911
I thought I would do
a good deed,

1426
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,184
and I went
to the pound,

1427
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:10,726
but I was only putting
my own selfish concerns

1428
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,158
ahead of what's good
for the animal.

1429
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:13,252
It's loneliness, Jimmy.

1430
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:16,094
Yeah, what was it,
Angel? A seeing-eye scam? Jimmy...

1431
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:18,759
You're not dumping that dog on me,
you got that?

1432
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:21,098
He's your dog,
and you're gonna take care of him.

1433
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,332
If ever hear
you gave him away,

1434
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:26,102
I am gonna feed you
the rest of his Friskies,

1435
01:17:26,175 --> 01:17:28,007
and then I'm gonna
break your face!

1436
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:29,442
Okay, okay!

1437
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:33,245
Get in here.
Get this dog some water.

1438
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,413
Okay, okay.

1439
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:39,284
Oh, and there's some almost-gone
bologna in the fridge, too.

1440
01:17:39,355 --> 01:17:41,380
Oh, you mean all the time
I was working here,

1441
01:17:41,457 --> 01:17:42,982
there was food
rotting in there?

1442
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:45,824
And did I get any? No.

1443
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:48,663
Well, the only problem
I can see

1444
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:52,065
is, uh, what's gonna
happen to that dog

1445
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,659
if you get held in jail?

1446
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:57,262
What's that?

1447
01:17:57,773 --> 01:18:00,367
If the cops choose
to call it that,

1448
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:01,967
it's accessory to homicide.

1449
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:06,346
Accessory to my colon. What
are you trying to lay on me?

1450
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:08,679
Well, you gave up Patrick
Dougherty, didn't you?

1451
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:10,150
You drove him,
knew his routine.

1452
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:11,209
Is he dead?

1453
01:18:11,287 --> 01:18:13,551
Oh, I'm sure
you can make a case

1454
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,647
that the Russians
tortured you.

1455
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,887
Anyway, it's probably not a
charge that you'd get indicted on.

1456
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:21,656
I didn't twist
nobody's cap.

1457
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:25,393
You didn't point them
to Patrick's motel?

1458
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:28,230
I haven't seen Mr. D
since the accident.

1459
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:29,829
I've been in Garden a, man.

1460
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:31,339
I've been, I've been
at the poker palaces

1461
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:32,738
trying to raise your 900.

1462
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:34,936
Oh, yeah, raise me my 900.

1463
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:36,000
Well, raise a pillow.

1464
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:37,603
You'd have come in for some.

1465
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,842
Look, Jimmy, that is
what Larry is for.

1466
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,808
Frankly, I'm insulted

1467
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,445
that you would think
that I might try to...

1468
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:47,489
Shut up, Angel. Stop it.

1469
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:51,285
FRANK: Come on, come on!

1470
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,657

harder than that

to startle you.

let me in the front gate.

No, it's all right.

1484
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:30,765
I, I don't think Megan is
around right now, Jim.

1485
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,699
I think she went down
to the beach with her sister.

1486
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,930
Oh, that's all right.
I, uh...

1487
01:19:35,004 --> 01:19:37,701
I don't want to talk
to Megan yet.

01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,037
Oh? You all right?

01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:43,504
What is it?

1490
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:45,604
It has to do
with your nephew's death.

I have never seen her
this bad, ever.

1494
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:56,223
Well, Patrick was
the main character

1495
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:57,282
in the story
of her life.

1496
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:00,090
Maybe it's finally
having to accept the fact

1497
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:03,223
that it's not
going to be rewritten.

1499
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,733
come and watch
me and Daniel jump.

1500
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,396
Did, uh,

1501
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,735
Megan ever express
any anger at her cousin

1502
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,138
over the accident?

1503
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:14,198
No.

1504
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:15,700
No?

1505
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:19,481
No, I think she realized,
even as a young girl,

1506
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:21,209
that her injury
gave her the power

1507
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,081
to completely
obliterate that kid,

1508
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:25,519
and I think
it frightened her.

1509
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:27,988
Oh, she raged
at other things.

1510
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:29,786
Therapists.

1511
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:32,589

1514
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:40,935
Stayed that way.
Don't ask me how.

1515
01:20:42,071 --> 01:20:43,630
What about you?

1516
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,836
I was too harsh.

1517
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:48,434
I knew it even when
I was doing it,

1518
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,376
but I couldn't
stop myself.

1519
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:52,676
You saw it. Set him up,
knock him down.

1520

watch! That's my name, Jim.

1522

Did you tell
Gennady Koblets

1523
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:04,986
where he might
pick Patrick up?

1524
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:10,592
I mean, Patrick talked
to you constantly.

1525
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:12,634
He craved your approval.

1526
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,503
You know, I like you
well enough, Jim,

1527
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:17,938
but you better take down
that social worker shingle

1528

or you could be facing
a lawsuit.

1529

This girl that he loved
and hurt so badly,

1530
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:28,310
she couldn't give him
what he had coming to him.

1531
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,384

when their kids' school
pictures turn out badly,

Why don't you
answer me?

Oh, Daddy.

How long
could we go on?

1544
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:32,173
He was so unhappy.

Oh, my God.

No, that's the wrong question.

1550

All you can do is keep going

1551
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:50,396
and carry what
you have to carry.

1552

You didn't, Daddy.

You taught all of us
to do that,
