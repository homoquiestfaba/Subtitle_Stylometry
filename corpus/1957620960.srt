00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,392
kindly do me the service of opening the secret door behind the fireplace

189
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,465
Carry me down to the crypt, place me in my coffin.

190
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,933
Thank you much.

I've got this thing in my bed.

Hop on, we got a live one.

Get on.

201
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,349
So, describe the thing, ma'am.

202
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,552
Well, it's not exactly a man.

203
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,654
Not exactly a man in your bed.

204
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,557
What is it? A gay trucker?

205
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,094
I've never seen anyone so stiff.

206
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,566
Stiff. This calls for my immediate attention.

207
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,136
Apparently, this happens to him every day at sunrise.

208
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,507
Well, it's normal for these studs to salute in the morning, toots.

209
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,177
Normal? If what he says is true,

I'd rather not discuss him.

Oh!

735
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,874
I'm terribly sorry. I don't know what came over me.

736
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,243
Are you by any chance wearing boxers?

737
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:22,279
Uh-huh. Well, that must be it.

738
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,415
You're very uninhibited.

739
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,484

00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,063
So, uh,

744
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:44,534
tell me about those crazy capers.

745
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:48,705
I'm sure Kendall won't mind if I open the bar

747
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:54,478
What'll you have?

748
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,746
(CHUCKLES) Uh, a zombie.

749
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,718
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) A zombie?

750
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:05,122

you and zany Zachary had!

758
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:25,642
Well, one Halloween night...

759
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,210
What are you doing?

760
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,248
Well, I was looking for the ladies room.

761
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:33,250
In the fireplace?

762
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:36,686
That's the way we put the fires out in the old days.

763
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,455
John's over there.

764
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,791
So, the Halloween story.

765
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:45,128

I didn't want to drop them in the mailbox.

Kendall's a little slow on the intros.

I'm Dwight Putnam.

You work for Haagen-Dazs? No. Um...

789
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,781
We just had an ice cream cone.

790
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,552
You look...

791
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,221
...different.

792
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,560
Uh, that's because Kendall's been doing such a wonderful job

Newman. Paul Newman.

796
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:32,902
We just saw a Paul Newman movie and he wanted to dress like him.

Up north.

He's asking as many as me.

807

You're a lucky guy, Zachary. She's a wonderful girl.

808
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:05,802
The problem is she's got this fantasy about finding the perfect guy.

I don't have a job at the moment,

814
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,791
but I'm desperately looking for one.

815
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,426
I might be able to help.

816

Do you know anything about insurance?

817
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,163
Sure, we had that.

00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:37,834
You know, for six dollars, you could get a policy from Benjamin Franklin...

You know about the Benjamin Franklin six-dollar deductible policy?

820
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,174
(CHUCKLES) Hardly anyone knows that.

821
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,542
You fascinate me, Zachary.

When can I start? When can he start?

827
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:01,991
He has a health problem. You wouldn't believe his diet.

828

How bad is your health?

Well, I'm weaning myself off of blood at the moment.

01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:06,129
(LAUGHS) Onto what? Not synthetic blood?

895
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,930
Oh, no, Zacky, it has side effects.

896
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,700
I know this vampire who tried it once,

If I had a working stomach, I'd throw up.

I gave you immortality and you want to trade it in for Twinkies?

904
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,026
You gave me 200 years of heartache.

905
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,862
I only became a vampire in the first place because I was in love with you

906
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,632
and I thought you were in love with me.

907
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:45,835
Well, of course I was in love with you.
