1
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:27,443
A little girl coming in,
a third grader, covered in dirt,

2
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:32,656
has one flip-flop,
the other one busted on the way in-- this

3
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,074
was January.

4
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:38,620
I could call her mom and say,
you know, where's her shoes?

5
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:42,292
Be mad and call 241-KIDS
and say this is neglect,

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,086
or I could just find a way
to get this girl a shoe.

7
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,050
I want to do something that's
much, much

8
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,511
different than probably
a lot of principals.

9
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,306
I want the boards to
come down off the houses.

10
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,933
I want less crime and people
from outside our community

11
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,102
coming in and selling drugs.

12
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:05,815
I want to start working on
the neighborhood, the streets.

13
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:19,913
Hey.

14
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,331
I've got three young ladies who
won't be able to start school

15
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,124
till Monday.

16
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,249
Why's that?

17
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,125
Whooping cough.

18
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:25,877
All three of them?

19
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:26,710
They live in here?

20
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:26,878
Yeah.

21
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,962
And they got the cough?

22
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:28,254
Yep.

23
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,172
Keep them there till
the cough's done.

24
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,216
John,
you're trying to hide from me.

25
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,302
Yes, you are.

26
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,178
Come here.

27
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,806
You are hiding from me,
and I know exactly why.

28
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,809
I'm not hiding from you.

29
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,269
You look like a zombie.

30
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,188
You need to come into school.

31
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,688
All right?

32
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,232
I mean it.

33
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,234
Are you well enough
to come into school.

34
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,151
You only need five credits.

35
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,238
I just scoped it out.

36
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,991
We want to try to find a way
how we can stop this and make

37
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,369
the streets better.

38
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,954
I don't think it's far off.

39
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,996
I mean,
I think it's very doable.

40
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,331
I'm excited about it.

41
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,501
I've got 184 more days to go.

42
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,507
Good morning.

43
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,509
We're all a little lost here
aren't, aren't we?

44
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,055
K to six, line up right
here, high school

45
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:22,517
on the far door,
seventh and eighth grade over here.

46
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,892
Today's going to
be crazy getting

47
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,310
used to the new building.

48
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,020
But we'll get it.

49
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,729
Each day will get
better and better, OK?

50
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,149
Brand new building, brand new
door, brand new entrance,

51
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,318
everything.

52
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,653
Exciting.

53
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,742
Straight to the
cafeteria, good job.

54
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,786
Today is a monumental day.

55
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,663
We were moved out
of our community

56
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,290
for the first time
in almost 100 years

57
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,543
while they renovated and
added new construction

58
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,585
to our building.

59
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,838
Today was the first day
that we have been back

60
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,882
in over two very long years.

61
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,551
Even before this,
we tried to do a lot of stuff

62
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,843
to brighten it up.

63
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,095
It was a very gloomy place.

64
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:00,136
It was a very gloomy place.
Good morning.

65
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:00,638
Good morning.

66
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:00,889
Good morning.

67
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,556
high school.

68
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,473
Is that this way?

69
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,057
I have no idea.

70
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,226
I don't even know.

71
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,561
Me neither.

72
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,398
Lower Price Hill is
a predominately poor

73
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:11,441
Lower Price Hill is a predominately
poor white Appalachian community.

74
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,693
white Appalachian community.

75
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,905
When the coal mines and
the jobs left in Kentucky,

76
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,073
West Virginia,
a lot of the families

77
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:24,120
migrated to the urban
centers to get jobs.

78
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,707
There were hundreds of jobs
and factories around here.

79
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,626
A lot of those are gone now.

80
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,963
It's kind of become
an economic desert.

81
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:39,302
I can walk you outside the
door not even 15 steps away,

82
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,387
and I can probably get just
about any drug that I want.

83
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:42,430
and I can probably get just about any drug that
I want. I can walk you another 15 feet down,

84
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,934
I can walk you
another 15 feet down,

85
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,897
and there are our parents that
are prostituting and are hooked

86
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,565
on heroin and crack cocaine.

87
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:03,867
Assault out on
Hatmaker, right now.

88
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,452
Who?

89
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,578
I don't know.

90
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:06,996
Cops are there.

91
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,539
Was it in that
house on the right?

92
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,665
Mhm.

93
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,416
That's something we've
got to think about,

94
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,417
make sure we.

95
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,628
Lots to do today.

96
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,715
We're in this
brand new building.

97
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,175
We're riding a high.

98
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,971
Students walking
around still in awe.

99
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,515
Mr. Hockenberry got
some correspondence

100
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,933
from the state,
a letter that said

101
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:27,976
from the state, a letter that said we have
been identified as a priority school which

102
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:32,605
we have been identified
as a priority school which

103
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:37,235
means that we are in the bottom
5% of schools in the state

104
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,905
as it relates to
academic performance.

105
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,824
And then we keep reading.

106
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,411
We have to choose one of
five models for school

107
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:47,453
We have to choose one of five
models for school transformation.

108
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,745
transformation.

109
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,541
Four out of the five models
say replace the principal.

110
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,252
Up these steps, all right?

111
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,670
And then the teachers will
be right up top there.

112
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:56,713
And then the teachers will be right up top there.
The fifth model is don't replace the principal,

113
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:59,966
The fifth model is don't
replace the principal,

114
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,718
but you have to
show a proven track

115
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:02,760
but you have to show a proven track
record of academic achievement.

116
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,096
record of academic achievement.

117
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,015
And that's what
we're hoping for.

118
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,898
My initial reaction
was this will go away.

119
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:16,941
My initial reaction was this will go away. The
further away from where you are, the worse we look.

120
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,987
The further away from where you
are, the worse we look.

121
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,780
When people see the real
work that's going on,

122
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:23,823
When people see the real work that's
going on, we look absolutely fantastic.

123
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,658
we look absolutely fantastic.

124
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,662
Hi!

125
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,872
Welcome back.

126
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:31,914
Yay, yay, yay, yay.

127
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,374
My name is Raven Gribbins.

128
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,544
I am in the 12th grade.

129
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,297
I've lived in Lower
Price Hill my whole life.

130
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,344
It's been rough,
but it's been OK too.

131
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,345
Everybody used to tell
me, you're

132
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,096
not going to make it
through high school.

133
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,349
You're going to
have a baby by 16.

134
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,518
So I'm glad to prove
all of them wrong.

135
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,730
job after graduation because
I'm going to college.

136
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,522
OK.

137
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:57,899
Hi.

138
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,899
Hi, I'm Stephanie.

139
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,567
Stephanie, so nice to meet you.

140
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,152
Hi.

141
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:01,903
Crystal.

142
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,071
Crystal, so nice to meet you.

143
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,032
You are not--
you're looking down,

144
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,240
so you know I'm coming to you.

145
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:07,825
Hi.

146
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,493
Hello.

147
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,202
Hi, my name is Crystal,
nice to meet you.

148
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,661
Crystal, so nice to meet you.

149
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,579
Good handshake.

150
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,039
My name is Crystal Kornegay.

151
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,082
My name is Crystal Kornegay.
I'm a senior, and I live in Price Hill.

152
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,084
I'm a senior,
and I live in Price Hill.

153
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,794
I did not come out
of the womb knowing

154
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:18,836
I did not come out of the womb knowing
how to eat at a business lunch.

155
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,420
how to eat at a business lunch.

156
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,297
That doesn't happen.

157
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,382
What you want to do is
you want to maintain

158
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,426
a professional decorum, OK?

159
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,513
I've been attending Oyler
since the second grade.

160
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,015
Say you drop a knife.

161
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,225
Do not panic.

162
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,434
You're at a restaurant.

163
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,769
They have lots of knives.

164
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:35,812
They have lots of knives.
Sometimes you've got to fight back

165
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,688
Sometimes you've
got to fight back

166
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,981
because if you don't,
you will wind up

167
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:40,024
because if you don't, you will
wind up like the people around you.

168
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,984
like the people around you.

169
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,820
Well, the most important
thing you can do

170
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,446
is just be your best self.

171
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:51,202
I just want to leave and do
some new travel, be the oddball.

172
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,702
Everybody look at
their fingernails.

173
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,288
Clean fingernails.

174
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,624
Ladies, fingernail polish.

175
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,334
Any questions?

176
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,294
Any more questions?

177
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,628
Good morning, everybody.

178
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:01,671
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, everybody.

179
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,671
Good morning, everybody.

180
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:02,711
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning.

181
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:03,381
Good morning.

182
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,049
This is my 14th year here.

183
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,218
When I first started,
I did everything.

184
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,636
If a little girl came in
and she had head lice,

185
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,554
I scrubbed her hair.

186
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,933
If a boy came in and he
had a peanut allergy,

187
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,934
I hit him with the epi-pen.

188
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,644
Mountain Dew in the
morning, sir?

189
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,938
Don't think so.

190
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,493
If you would've been
here three years ago,

191
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,080
the floors were black, hard
concrete, no air conditioning.

192
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,414
The lockers were old.

193
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,832
The restrooms were horrid.

194
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,959
It was terrible.

195
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:01,939
We tried to create this vision
of a one-stop shop, where

196
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,858
we have services from
5:30 in the morning

197
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,233
until 10:30 at night.

198
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,944
So if a parent walks
through our door right now

199
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:07,987
So if a parent walks through our door right
now and has a child that sick, needs glasses,

200
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,823
and has a child that
sick, needs glasses,

201
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:11,866
and has a child that sick, needs glasses,
and has a mental health issue, we

202
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,533
and has a mental health
issue, we

203
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,745
can just walk them to the
different areas of our school,

204
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:16,787
can just walk them to the different areas of our
school, and then get the child back in a seat.

205
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,371
and then get the
child back in a seat.

206
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,791
In theory, there should be no
kid not getting full services

207
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:21,834
In theory, there should be no kid not
getting full services here, you know?

208
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,834
here, you know?

209
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,002
And if they're not,
then we're going

210
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,380
to address it pretty quickly.

211
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,799
We have probably one of the
largest tutoring programs

212
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:29,842
We have probably one of the largest tutoring programs
here in the Midwest that has over 400 mentors.

213
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:34,263
here in the Midwest that
has over 400 mentors.

214
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,389
Well done.

215
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,391
We have the early
childhood wing,

216
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,185
which then makes our school
from zero to five all the way

217
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,020
to 12th grade.

218
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,900
In order to
revitalize the school,

219
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:51,154
you have to go hand in hand with
revitalizing the neighborhood.

220
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,198
Is it just you?

221
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,782
Yeah, just me.

222
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,074
OK.

223
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,575
If someone from the
community needs something,

224
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,246
the only thing they have to do
is come to the school building.

225
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,121
Here you go.

226
00:08:59,163 --> 00:08:59,622
Have a good one.

227
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,539
God bless you.

228
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:00,998
You too.

229
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,375
Thank you.

230
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,583
I got my help.

231
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,584
How was your day at school?

232
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,752
It was good.

233
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,712
You have any homework?

234
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,631
Yes, I do.

235
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,341
So you going to
do your homework?

236
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:11,926
Yes, I'll do it.

237
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,094
I want to make
something with my life.

238
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,846
If my mom and dad would've
had a high school diploma,

239
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,933
their life would be
way different now.

240
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,269
My mom,
she was in and out of jail a lot.

241
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,645
She had a drug problem.

242
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,732
She used to prostitute also.

243
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,444
I talk to her every
once in a while.

244
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,321
I don't know what's
going on now.

245
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,743
My father,
he could not read or write,

246
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,372
so that's what messed him up.

247
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,331
I'm a maintenance man.

248
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,959
I do construction.

249
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,961
Not having an education,
sometimes work's hard to find.

250
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,964
You struggle.

251
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,966
I had moved in with my dad
because of a lot of problems

252
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,177
that had been going on
in Lower Price Hill.

253
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,139
She wanted to come up and stay
to get away from State Avenue

254
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,975
because it was getting a little
rough, a little violent.

255
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,145
I lived up here,
and it's a little quieter.

256
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,396
This is mine and my
little sister's room.

257
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,231
We share.

258
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,611
We kind of had growing
up a rocky relationship,

259
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,487
and I got hooked on cocaine
pretty bad and alcohol.

260
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,990
And they took
Raven away from me.

261
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,951
My mother and father
raised her for me.

262
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:19,994
My mother and father raised her for me. But
now it's a date, and I'm clean and sober.

263
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,495
But now it's a date,
and I'm clean and sober.

264
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,289
I got a second chance
and an opportunity

265
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:24,332
I got a second chance and an opportunity
to spend this last year with her.

266
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,875
to spend this last
year with her.

267
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:26,917
to spend this last year with her.
She's going to graduate from high school.

268
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,044
She's going to graduate
from high school.

269
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:29,086
She's going to graduate from high school.
Hopefully she'll go to college.

270
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,129
Hopefully she'll go to college.

271
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,172
Hopefully she'll go to college.
I mean, I'm really hoping.

272
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,922
I mean, I'm really hoping.

273
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:32,963
I mean, I'm really hoping.
She says she is.

274
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:33,716
She says she is.

275
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,634
But I hope she at least
gives it a chance.

276
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,844
Why'd you make that face?

277
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,430
Because I'm going
to go to college so

278
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,600
I can have a better
life than they had.

279
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,407
Don, what's going on, buddy?

280
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,576
I got them doing a little
story on the school,

281
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,203
just walking the neighborhood.

282
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,162
That's all right.

283
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,207
Yeah, we're doing OK.

284
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:07,249
Yeah, we're doing OK. I grew up a
block away at 2125 St. Michael Street.

285
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,086
I grew up a block away at 2125 St.
Michael Street.

286
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,131
I want to Oyler kindergarten
through sixth grade.

287
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,591
When I was growing
up, the ladies, they'd

288
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:16,634
When I was growing up, the ladies, they'd hit this
sidewalk about 7 or 8 o'clock in the evenings

289
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,386
hit this sidewalk about 7
or 8 o'clock in the evenings

290
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,845
when the sun would go
down, and it

291
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:20,888
when the sun would go down, and it would be
coffee and cigarettes and Pepsi and gossip.

292
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,807
would be coffee and cigarettes
and Pepsi and gossip.

293
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,559
These women were always out,
keeping an eye on things

294
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,562
and running this place.

295
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,146
I never feel as
good as I do when

296
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,649
I'm standing right here in front
of 21 25 St. Michael Street.

297
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,902
I probably never will.

298
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,076
I consider us a
close knit community.

299
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,911
Families that have been
here for a long time

300
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,330
have married other families that
have been here for a long time.

301
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,750
So there's a lot of, oh,
that's my daughter-in-law's family,

302
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,379
or that's my
son-in-law's family.

303
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,386
I've lived in this
neighborhood 52 years.

304
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:01,429
I've lived in this neighborhood 52 years. There's
times around here when things aren't going very good,

305
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,431
There's times around here when
things aren't going very good,

306
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:04,473
There's times around here when things aren't going
very good, but you always seem to find somebody

307
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,808
but you always seem
to find somebody

308
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,602
who can lean on and talk to.

309
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,607
Times are getting hard,
and without an education,

310
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,193
a lot of people aren't
going to make it.

311
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,119
Thank you.

312
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,050
Oyler began as only at
pre-K to sixth school,

313
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,845
then they added the seventh,
and they added the eighth grade.

314
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,473
Over time, we had saw an
ugly pattern developing.

315
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,518
85.9% of the kids
that left here never

316
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:50,561
85.9% of the kids that left here
never made it to a 10th grade seat.

317
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,562
made it to a 10th grade seat.

318
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:52,605
made it to a 10th grade seat. It was very
shocking to me, because every opening day

319
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,024
It was very shocking to me,
because every opening day

320
00:12:55,065 --> 00:13:01,112
outside my building were
20, 30, 40, 50, 60 kids that

321
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,323
should be in high school.

322
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,616
So it kind of sparked
an idea to say,

323
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:04,658
So it kind of sparked an idea to say,
could we have a high school here?

324
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,327
could we have a
high school here?

325
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:07,369
could we have a high school here? When my
own children were going to school here,

326
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,370
When my own children were
going to school here,

327
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:09,413
When my own children were going to school here,
when they got to high school or junior high,

328
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,499
when they got to high
school or junior high,

329
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:12,541
when they got to high school or junior high,
they were being bused to other high schools.

330
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,501
they were being bused
to other high schools.

331
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,960
And that was hard on them.

332
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,003
And that was hard on them. They say that
they were bullied on by other students.

333
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:20,507
They say that they were
bullied on by other students.

334
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,887
Faculty wouldn't do anything to help
them, to make it stop.

335
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,932
My kids, they would beat me
back to the neighborhood.

336
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:28,848
You know, I'd get a call.

337
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,642
Your kids aren't in school.

338
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,850
I just dropped them off.

339
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,018
So when I went to
Taft High School,

340
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,313
there was only 43 white
people in the whole school.

341
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,855
They didn't like us.

342
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,106
We didn't like them.

343
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,818
Now times have changed.

344
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,985
The prejudice is still
there, but it's not as strong

345
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,198
as it was back in the
'80s and the '90s.

346
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,995
We're starting our eighth
year as a high school.

347
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,706
We have graduated more kids
in the past three years

348
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,752
than in the collective
85 years prior.

349
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,838
For a lot of our kids,
they have grown up here.

350
00:13:59,839 --> 00:13:59,880
For a lot of our kids, they have grown up here.
They have started here as kindergartners,

351
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,049
They have started here
as kindergartners,

352
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,717
and they're going to be walking
out the doors as high school

353
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,637
graduates.

354
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,058
All right, let's set the tone
from the very first play.

355
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,103
1, 2, fire it up!

356
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,479
Come on!

357
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,731
Come on!

358
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:20,985
Let's go!

359
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,653
No, no, no,
play within the game.

360
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:23,694
No, no, no, play within the game.
You hear me?

361
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:24,363
You hear me?

362
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,077
Hey, are you guys still
were you're supposed to be?

363
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,369
Yeah.

364
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:31,954
All right.

365
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,664
Before the high school
started, we

366
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,625
had zero students graduating.

367
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,876
And the fact that
we're graduating

368
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:37,918
And the fact that we're graduating almost
upwards of 40 or 50 kids a year now

369
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,795
almost upwards of 40
or 50 kids a year now

370
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,255
is an accomplishment to us.

371
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,966
But the state has
accountability measures,

372
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,094
and we're responsible
for meeting those.

373
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,179
So that's how we fell
into that-- they're

374
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:50,222
So that's how we fell into that--
they're calling it a priority category.

375
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,100
calling it a priority category.

376
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:58,022
We were in there because our
graduation rate was below 60%.

377
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,441
They were basing the graduation
rate on a four-year model.

378
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:01,483
They were basing the graduation rate on a four-year
model. So when a kid comes in the ninth grade,

379
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,776
So when a kid comes
in the ninth grade,

380
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,237
he's got four years to graduate.

381
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,156
If it takes him
five, he's a dropout.

382
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,283
There's one right there.

383
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,075
He saw me and took off.

384
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,993
Stop, stop, stop.

385
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,953
Gentlemen,
I know where you go to school,

386
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,582
and I know where you live.

387
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,708
As we move forward
through the school year,

388
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:18,751
As we move forward through the school year, we
still have to show some kind of academic change.

389
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,587
we still have to show some
kind of academic change.

390
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,507
Office-- Alex
Chapman just took off

391
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,136
running from me
through an alley.

392
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,096
Could you contact his father
and let him know he's skipping?

393
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,141
He's also got somebody
else with him.

394
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,268
You take your eye off the ball
for one minute in Lower Price

395
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,395
Hill, one minute, and you lose.

396
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,440
Hey, Donna Jones,
we're doing an attendance sweep.

397
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,524
If you see any skippers,
let me know. $5--

398
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,984
viaduct.

399
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,946
That's where I've seen
them all yesterday.

400
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:47,862
On the viaduct?

401
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,821
I didn't think of that.

402
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,615
Let's turn around.

403
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,407
Yeah.

404
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,493
Go back.

405
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,369
I thought about that.

406
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,661
I didn't even think of that.

407
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,329
Is it they're under here?

408
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,081
Right there.

409
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:57,998
Yep.

410
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,499
How'd they get in?

411
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:58,999
Go right.

412
00:15:58,999 --> 00:15:59,708
Go right.

413
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:01,961
OK.

414
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,212
Faster.

415
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,339
You hit it.

416
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,176
All righty, Mr. Mitchell.

417
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,054
Guys, come on.

418
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,265
I know every corner,
every inch of this place, all right?

419
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,767
Do you guys understand it?

420
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,395
And I'm going to catch you
every single time you do it.

421
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,943
We're in the area of
the city where there

422
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,570
is quite a bit of pollution.

423
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,281
The pollution coming from
cars, coming from factories

424
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,576
is an easy thing to think of.

425
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,869
At first,
I wanted to switch schools,

426
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,830
but because this was
the closest school,

427
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:38,872
but because this was the closest school,
my parents wanted me to come here.

428
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,331
my parents wanted
me to come here.

429
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,876
At first I didn't like
it, but I got used to it.

430
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,633
I want to say it was like the
fourth, like--

431
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,343
The second, the second.

432
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,511
My booty is there.

433
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:53,804
I've been there.

434
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:57,390
Me and him, me and him,
we talked to people,

435
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,100
and they didn't
want to talk to us.

436
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,770
We still talked to them.

437
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,773
It took about a month
for them to say,

438
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:05,816
It took about a month for them to say, either
those people don't know where they're at,

439
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,152
either those people don't
know where they're at,

440
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:12,071
or those people just got to fit
in, and that's how it was.

441
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:12,781
Mhm.

442
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:13,949
I've got a spike.

443
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,453
Are you Crystal?

444
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,038
Yep.

445
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,246
How's it going?

446
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:20,748
Good.

447
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,165
Good.

448
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:22,205
Good. Is that for us?

449
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:22,875
Is that for us?

450
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:22,914
Is that for us? Mhm.

451
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:23,709
Mhm.

452
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,251
Awesome.

453
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,002
Come on back here.

454
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:25,836
My name is Mary.

455
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,628
Nice to meet you.

456
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:27,546
Nice to meet you too.

457
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,422
Hi, Crystal.

458
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:28,839
Hey.

459
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,381
How are you?

460
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:29,757
Good.

461
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,424
Good.

462
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,092
So today I'm going to check
your eyes and see how they work

463
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,762
and what's going on.

464
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,220
So you're a senior?

465
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:36,847
Yes.

466
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,098
What's coming up next?

467
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:38,974
College.

468
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:39,808
Oh good.

469
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,100
What are you going to
study, do you know?

470
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,101
Criminal justice.

471
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,645
Wow, good.

472
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,273
All right, so start by looking
to the green animal here.

473
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,274
Hey, Raven, how are you?

474
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:48,776
Good, how are you?

475
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,026
Dr. , nice to meet you.

476
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:50,903
Nice to meet you.

477
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,779
OK, now watch this here.

478
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,864
You see that animal?

479
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,157
Can you tell what it is?

480
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:55,824
The cat.

481
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,575
Mhm.

482
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,743
So you do have
migraines it looks like.

483
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,038
Do you get headaches after you
read, though?

484
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,954
Sometimes.

485
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,414
Do you enjoy reading?

486
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:03,832
Nope.

487
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:04,792
OK.

488
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,125
You're a senior this
year, right?

489
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,919
And are you plan to go
to school next year?

490
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,212
Mhm.

491
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,629
Where are you looking
at going to school?

492
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,005
I want to go to Mount St.
Joseph.

493
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:11,799
Oh nice.

494
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,299
So you'd be close by.

495
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,092
To be a math teacher.

496
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:13,592
Wow!

497
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,384
OK.

498
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:15,052
That's awesome.

499
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,804
Move,.

500
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,849
I've known Raven
her entire life.

501
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,310
She is hard headed.

502
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:29,941
She is also highly
intelligent, highly motivated.

503
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,109
I worry about her.

504
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,777
I worry about all of them.

505
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:32,820
I worry about all of them. She's the
epitome of what our young ladies go through

506
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,987
She's the epitome of what
our young ladies go through

507
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,988
down here.

508
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:39,659
One day she might have her
drug addicted aunt's kids,

509
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,618
taking care of them.

510
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,495
The next day,
she'll be here playing basketball

511
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:46,500
just like a normal high school
student in anytown, USA.

512
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,002
What scares me is that if she
gets an opportunity to go away

513
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,504
to college, will she take it?

514
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,174
Because you always
feel like you're

515
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,843
being pulled back in
to your family's drama.

516
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,055
Guys, we need a
little bit more space.

517
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,140
It was the first varsity game.

518
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,641
The place was sold out.

519
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,393
The coach wasn't the head coach.

520
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,938
He was just stepping in.

521
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,525
1, 2, 3, work hard, play hard!

522
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,860
Hey, know who we've got!

523
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,698
So Raven dropped off two
tickets, one for her boyfriend

524
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,366
and one for her father.

525
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,701
He never showed.

526
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,163
I don't think her boyfriend shown
either, which caused her

527
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,665
and the coach to
have some issues.

528
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,917
Two of them got into it.

529
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,922
Staying out of trouble.

530
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,842
That's going to be
the biggest one.

531
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,180
I'm used to speaking my mind.

532
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:42,222
I'm used to speaking my mind. But when
you speak your mind, sometimes that

533
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,599
But when you speak your
mind, sometimes that

534
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,851
gets you in trouble.

535
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,272
I was feisty.

536
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,775
I always have an attitude
at some point in time.

537
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,822
Get her, Raven, get her!

538
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,157
Growing up,
was a really rough neighborhood.

539
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,367
It was one of the
roughest in Cincinnati.

540
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,412
We were raised to fight.

541
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,249
This girl, she kept calling
me all types of bad name,

542
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,794
saying I sucked up the
whole football team.

543
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,795
I told her, I said,
look, you're either

544
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:14,838
I told her, I said, look, you're either
going to have to stop talking about me,

545
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,631
going to have to stop
talking about me,

546
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,592
or we're going to have to fight.

547
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,013
And somebody ended up recording
it and put it on YouTube.

548
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,063
I only got to play like two
minutes because he was so mad.

549
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,525
When you're mad,
you can't just start yelling.

550
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,445
I am Raven's mentor
here from Oyler.

551
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,280
I mean, just think,
if you were to yell like that at your boss

552
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,574
and you lose your job--

553
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,283
I see her about two to
three times a month,

554
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,496
and we text on a regular basis.

555
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,290
Try and take a deep breath
and just remove yourself

556
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,708
from the situation
is the best advice.

557
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,418
We went to a lunch.

558
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,587
It was designed to
be a business lunch.

559
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,589
Club with no tomato.

560
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,132
That's her.

561
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,010
Thank you.

562
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,138
Do we have to eat our stuff--
our fries with a fork?

563
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:11,644
My major focus with
her so far has been I

564
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,937
don't want to let her down.

565
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,815
Because of her mother being
out of her life for so much

566
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,817
when I tell her I'm
going to do something,

567
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,735
I'm going to do it.

568
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,657
Look, it's beeping because I
don't have my seat belt on.

569
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,158
No, it's beeping because
I'm just getting really

570
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,411
close to the car behind it.

571
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,746
I thought everybody was going to be
real, real dressed up,

572
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,456
so when I came in
pants, I was like, I'm

573
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,417
going to be the only
person with pants on.

574
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:35,334
I thought that too.

575
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:35,877
Oh no.

576
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,962
Did you hear about the shooting
that happened on the west side

577
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:38,672
Friday night?

578
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,381
Oh yeah.

579
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,549
After the game?

580
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,675
It was during the game too.

581
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,385
That's crazy.

582
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,885
Because the game was sold out.

583
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,595
This is what I heard.

584
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,637
The game was sold out.

585
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,347
They were mad they
couldn't get in,

586
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,809
so they started shooting
because they couldn't get in.

587
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,352
That is crazy!

588
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:53,895
Yeah.

589
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,188
They started shooting because
they couldn't get in the game.

590
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:56,648
Yeah!

591
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,942
I have never heard
of nothing like that.

592
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,444
Hi, everybody.

593
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,111
Hi, Mr. Hockenberry.

594
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,405
Hey.

595
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,698
- Mr. Hockenberry.
- classes.

596
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,869
We left for two years,
pulled out all the services,

597
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,202
and went up to Price Hill.

598
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,204
We leave,
and there's nothing to do.

599
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,707
Shot right there,
and came out there.

600
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,917
You know what I told her
about not being in school

601
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,169
and hanging out any everything?

602
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,379
Almost every night,
there was a shooting.

603
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,964
There was a rape.

604
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,760
There was a drug overdose.

605
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,928
So there was absolutely
nothing going on,

606
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,473
and I think that leads to
bad, bad decisions.

607
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,934
My son-in-law's
brother was murdered.

608
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:36,270
This was Brian's house,
the boy that was murdered.

609
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,856
Brian Thompson was
a student here,

610
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,610
and his son Brian
is now a student.

611
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,153
From what I understand,
it was just being in the wrong place

612
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,321
at the wrong time.

613
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:49,950
There was a craps game going
on over here in the water park.

614
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,953
One guy lost several
hundred dollars in the game,

615
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,997
so he called his
friends and said,

616
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,583
let's rob this guy,
get my $200 back.

617
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,667
And they shoot the guy.

618
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,878
They take the money.

619
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,421
Brian had just pulled up.

620
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:06,467
He had his hands up in the car,
and they came right this way

621
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,344
and just-- he wouldn't
get out of the car,

622
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,179
and they just unloaded
fire and shot him

623
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,224
and killed him on the face.

624
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,601
All right, guys, let's go!

625
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,895
Out of the park.

626
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,021
Mr. Wynn.

627
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,900
There was a triple shooting
up on Price Hill last night.

628
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:22,943
There was a triple shooting up on Price Hill last
night. You stay out of that stuff, you hear me?

629
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:25,153
You stay out of that
stuff, you hear me?

630
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,331
can go there, and that's

631
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:37,374
can go there, and that's where
you take your library classes.

632
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:40,126
where you take your
library classes.

633
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:40,168
where you take your library classes. you can
come here, and I'll help you directly do that,

634
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,420
you can come here,
and I'll help you directly do that,

635
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,672
but it's going to be.

636
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,757
So far, the school
year, it feels

637
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,136
like it's gone by really fast.

638
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:54,807
I have been applying to colleges
like Kent State, UC, Miami,

639
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,308
and other colleges.

640
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,228
So can I put that in this one?

641
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:58,728
Yeah.

642
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,730
Like, attending
University of Cincinnati

643
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:05,359
would help me accomplish
one of my goals.

644
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,071
Yeah, good.

645
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,450
When I came to Oyler,
there was like this complete absence

646
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,493
of college.

647
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,328
It's not a dinner table topic.

648
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:16,371
It's not a dinner table topic. I said,
one day a year, every year from here on out

649
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:20,249
I said, one day a year,
every year from here on out

650
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:20,292
I said, one day a year, every year from here
on out for as long as I'm principal, we'll

651
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,834
for as long as I'm
principal, we'll

652
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:25,379
do our one day where that's
all we talk about is college.

653
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,716
When we think about colleges,
what do we think about first?

654
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,800
Marshall?

655
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,011
We can't start
talking to students

656
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,555
from a school in
an area like this

657
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,475
when they're sophomores and
juniors about going to college.

658
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,101
You have to plant
that seed early.

659
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,687
They have to believe it and
believe it and believe it.

660
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,315
Because the sad truth
is, not only are they

661
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,650
not hearing it at home,
they may be hearing the opposite

662
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,360
at home.

663
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,569
You're not going
to go to college.

664
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,030
You're no better than me.

665
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,697
What makes you think
you can go to college?

666
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,532
Nobody from our family's
ever gone to college?

667
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,242
Why am I showing
you Hocking College?

668
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,579
Because last year,
Ashley Ward, she

669
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,997
graduated from our high school.

670
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,541
And she is now at
Hocking college.

671
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,460
This is direct
evidence that if you

672
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:09,465
graduate high school from
Oyler, you can go to college.

673
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,799
You can succeed.

674
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,386
Someone has to be the one to
break that cycle of not being

675
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,014
educated and living in poverty.

676
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,849
And our students here
at Oyler are doing that.

677
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,435
We have first generation
college students coming out

678
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,938
of our high school every year.

679
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,064
--very interested.

680
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:25,815
I'm Crystal.

681
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,066
Abby, nice to meet you.

682
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,150
Nice to meet you too.

683
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,402
I got accepted to Mount St.
Joseph.

684
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:30,779
OK.

685
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,447
And they were telling me about
their different scholarships

686
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,574
they have to offer.

687
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,200
The amount of money
that you receive,

688
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,496
does it-- like it depends
on your GPA and ACT scores

689
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,581
or just based on one?

690
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,251
Both of those combined.

691
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,884
Triangle inequality.

692
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:59,014
Absolute value of x minus
2 plus the absolute value--

693
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,140
Hi, Raven, I'm Abby.

694
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:00,475
Hi--

695
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,268
So good to meet you.

696
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,394
Nice to meet you too.

697
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,602
Hi, I'm Caitlin.

698
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,104
I'm her former college
access advisor.

699
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,856
OK, very nice to meet you.

700
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,817
She submitted an
application, right?

701
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,568
Mhm.

702
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:12,695
And with an ACT score from last
year, right?

703
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,446
Mhm.

704
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:17,117
And so she's wondering-- what
did you get on it last year?

705
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,784
16.

706
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:22,288
Our average score is a
22, but by no means does

707
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,457
that mean that everybody in that
range, above that range,

708
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,001
gets in.

709
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,960
There's people below
that that also get in.

710
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,045
Can you tell me a little
bit about your GPA

711
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,964
and where you're at
in school right now?

712
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,508
My GPA is a 2.3.

713
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,426
OK.

714
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,679
But it's going up,
though, because I've got

715
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,930
straight A's and B's right now.

716
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:40,265
You do?

717
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:40,890
That's good.

718
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,058
Yes, so it's going up.

719
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,601
Because they're making
funding decisions

720
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,685
right now,
so you want to make sure

721
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,606
you get this in before for
they decide about funding.

722
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,690
I could do that.

723
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,483
OK.

724
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,276
Maybe.

725
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,359
Maybe?

726
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,486
Just kidding.

727
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,445
I'm listening.

728
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,904
Just because I'm playing
a game-- I'm listening.

729
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,365
I just like to check.

730
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,950
Sometimes when you guys are
like texting and playing games,

731
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,078
you're listening and
sometimes you're not.

732
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,665
Ms. Burns, who you waiting on?

733
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:06,999
You all right?

734
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,417
Yeah.

735
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,376
All right.

736
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:13,756
Something's going on
here we don't know about.

737
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,509
We've got kids that haven't
shown up in 100 days, 50 days,

738
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,678
60 days.

739
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,221
They're not going to
show up on testing day,

740
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:25,352
so they're going to have an
impact on some of our scores.

741
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,353
The big elephant in the
room is the attendance.

742
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:27,937
Attendance.

743
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:31,065
That's going to have to be
a top priority because it

744
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,024
is getting low.

745
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,360
And it is hard to teach
with six kids in a classroom

746
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,486
or 10 kids in a classroom.

747
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,904
So we have to make sure--

748
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,281
But it's not a problem we
haven't ever dealt with before,

749
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:39,699
right?

750
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,911
I mean, every year we've got
that mid-year attendance issue

751
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,038
with the juniors and
seniors, and every year we

752
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,997
get them back.

753
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,166
Craig has just done so
much for this community,

754
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,212
and he deserves to be able
to stay in the position

755
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,298
that he's in.

756
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,550
He has such an enormous
vision for the neighborhood.

757
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,220
Why would that not be supported?

758
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:01,262
Why would that not be supported?

759
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,347
OK.

760
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:03,390
Just leave them here.

761
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,556
I have the directions here.

762
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,350
Well, you know,
it's very complicated.

763
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,936
I'll put it together
in just a minute.

764
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,771
I'm basically on
call 24 hours a day.

765
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,358
I mean, any given
moment, I could

766
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,986
be working till midnight
and up by 5 o'clock.

767
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,780
So it's constant,
around the clock.

768
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,823
All right, not crank it.

769
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:21,782
Keep cranking.

770
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,741
Like this?

771
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,451
Oohh.

772
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,618
As long as it doesn't
leak out anywhere.

773
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,452
I know how to do this, but--

774
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,495
What are you doing?

775
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,331
When I first saw him,
I knew that there was

776
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,500
something different about him.

777
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,835
Do you want me to
open it for you?

778
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,752
Yeah.

779
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,045
And I told him from
the very beginning,

780
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:39,008
you are destined
to change lives.

781
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:43,095
I think because he
is beyond passionate,

782
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:47,433
it's hard not to be
supportive because what

783
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,351
he does is just so admirable.

784
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,979
Sometimes I have
to literally tell

785
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,816
him to turn,
take his face out of his "CrackBerry,"

786
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,278
and give me some face time.

787
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,654
If you're not busy,
try not to stab me.

788
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,407
Oh, I think I want to try
to stab you a little bit.

789
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:03,992
OK.

790
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:04,033
OK.

791
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,618
Here we go.

792
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,454
Ow.

793
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,288
All right.

794
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:08,788
It's great.

795
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,330
Great.

796
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,792
Apparently I'm the king of
Price Hill for this year.

797
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,005
Happy Thanksgiving!

798
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:23,927
I grew up in a beautiful small
town in Northeastern Ohio.

799
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,512
Hi!

800
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:24,554
Hi! How are you?

801
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,472
How are you?

802
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,974
It was a very rural community.

803
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,601
It was in those days
when you could just

804
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,645
walk out the door in the
morning, be gone until 6:00,

805
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:36,774
7 o'clock at night,
and my parents never even blinked

806
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,318
an eye if I was safe or not.

807
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,818
Happy Thanksgiving!

808
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,236
Happy Thanksgiving!

809
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,365
Probably the exact opposite of.

810
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:46,951
Happy--

811
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,036
Happy Thanksgiving!

812
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,625
You're sleepy, aren't you?

813
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,667
You sleepy?

814
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:59,046
My dad's girlfriend Jessica,
she had my baby brother.

815
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,883
He was like three weeks early.

816
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,595
Can you hand me that
red cover right there?

817
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,095
She had a drug problem.

818
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,889
She would do something
here and there,

819
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,099
and that's the reason
why the baby had to stay

820
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,768
in the hospital an extra week.

821
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,313
He's almost up to
seven pounds now.

822
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:20,776
But she's been clean ever since
then, and she's doing good.

823
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,029
My dad and the way he
chooses to have his kids

824
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,572
is just real crazy.

825
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,032
I've got 10-year-old
sisters, then

826
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,700
I've got a two-year-old
sister, and now I've

827
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:32,162
got a new baby brother,
so we've got to be 17 years apart.

828
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:32,205
got a new baby brother, so we've got to be 17 years
apart. Oh, no, you're going to be a crybaby today.

829
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:39,629
Oh, no, you're going
to be a crybaby today.

830
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,192
Happy, happy birthday.

831
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,735
Hey!

832
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,779
Happy, happy birthday
from Applebee's to you!

833
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,031
Happy birthday!

834
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,449
Thank you!

835
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,097
It's been a tough
past two weeks,

836
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,891
and I don't anticipate
it getting any easier

837
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,435
over the next few weeks.

838
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,441
One of our parents
of three children

839
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,984
was shot and killed last night.

840
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,905
She was having some
problems with drugs.

841
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,533
Unfortunately, this is something
we're good at responding about.

842
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,536
I'd rather be good at
responding to football games

843
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,872
and basketball games.

844
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,880
There was a little
note in there.

845
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,299
She wrote, I love you, Mom.

846
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,634
I'll miss you, Mom.

847
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,803
Here's a book to read in heaven.

848
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,855
I'm going to drag those three
kids across the finish line,

849
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,565
no matter what happens.

850
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,484
Hey, Eric, how you feeling, man?

851
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,194
I'm all right.

852
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,027
Good.

853
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,987
I'm really sorry about
what happened, man.

854
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:29,489
It's all right.

855
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,490
I'm really sorry.

856
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,491
And you know,
I needed you at school today.

857
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,618
You gonna be there tomorrow for
me, for tomorrow?

858
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,494
I'll try.

859
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,079
All right.

860
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,792
This is two people,
friends that I've

861
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,002
lost to gun violence
in this neighborhood.

862
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,589
When is it gonna frickin' stop?

863
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,426
serious measures.

864
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:55,180
I want him explaining this.

865
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,723
Is Coach Lazar up here?

866
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,767
Coach is.

867
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,853
I saw half of you outside.

868
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:05,107
There was a fight that was
going to happen after school.

869
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,859
Not one person that
was in that fight

870
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,488
had anything to do
with any of you guys.

871
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,242
Not one of them talked
about your moms.

872
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,244
Not one of them hit you.

873
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,205
Not one of them stole
your girlfriend.

874
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,249
Now there's three police
cars out there, asking

875
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,459
about my basketball team.

876
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,504
Dequann,
they're saying it was you.

877
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,547
They're out there
looking for you.

878
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,674
I asked if I could
handle it myself.

879
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,051
You're his brother!

880
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:35,387
Don't let him do that stuff!

881
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,472
Tackle him.

882
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,433
Drag him in here.

883
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,435
Tie him to something.

884
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,229
This is our only chance
that we have to be winners.

885
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,440
You guys fought
every game last year.

886
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,567
You were an embarrassment.

887
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,820
And now nobody can beat
us because everybody's

888
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,905
playing together.

889
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:57,826
But one problem
throws everything off.

890
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:02,247
When a fight breaks out,
people lose their lives.

891
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,332
One wrong move in
this neighborhood,

892
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,252
and you're not going to college.

893
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,720
1, 2, 3,!

894
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,598
Let's go now.

895
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,851
Let's go!

896
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,629
All right.

897
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,298
Nobody goes on the court.

898
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,049
Got you.

899
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:53,549
Nobody.

900
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,884
OK.

901
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:06,687
Black, Gold, Black, Gold,
Black, Gold, Black, Gold!

902
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,314
O, O, O, O, O, O!

903
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,982
I don't want to play them again.

904
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,902
I do not want to play
them in the tournament.

905
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,697
I need a year off
from Riverview East.

906
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,665
The feeble fictional
creatures and animals that are

907
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:26,916
Yep.

908
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:27,749
Yep, that's it.

909
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,001
The climax.

910
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,087
There's a level of concern
right now about how

911
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,798
our scores will be.

912
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,049
We haven't thrown in the
towel yet by any means,

913
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,679
but we're definitely right
now fighting an uphill battle.

914
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:46,685
There is a lot of pressure
on teachers for test scores.

915
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,062
We spend a lot of time
preparing our children.

916
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,314
Some of our children
are very far behind.

917
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,983
Based on factual events.

918
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,403
Which one of these is
based on factual events?

919
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:59,364
Don't even tell me, nobody.

920
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:03,243
Sometimes it feels unfair to
be measured in the same way

921
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,870
as other schools in the state.

922
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,705
That's right.

923
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:06,372
Good job.

924
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,456
Exactly.

925
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,667
The human part of me that
comes in here every day

926
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,171
and sees what these students
are trying to do every day

927
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,965
and sees what these families are
trying to accomplish every day

928
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:20,261
says, this isn't fair.

929
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,887
Their performance
on those tests are

930
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,306
going to determine
whether or not

931
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,391
the state believes
that we have improved

932
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,020
enough to keep our principal.

933
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:34,942
See you, everybody.

934
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:35,484
I'll be back.

935
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:08,099
Penn,
they sent me an email saying

936
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,478
that they're looking
for new players,

937
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,898
that they really hope I'll
come out on the recruit day

938
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,235
and try out.

939
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,027
It's good,
but I'm scared I'm going

940
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,948
to get out there and like
freeze up or something.

941
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,823
I really like Raven.

942
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,116
She's very positive.

943
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,495
I think she knows
what she wants.

944
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,955
I actually used a
recruiting website

945
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,790
and saw that she was a setter.

946
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,501
She had high school experience
and just reached out her

947
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,796
to see what her
interest level might be,

948
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,129
to see if there's
any chance that we

949
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,925
would be a good fit for her.

950
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,842
You guys ready?

951
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,636
I really in my heart
believe that Raven

952
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,013
will be one of the
students who breaks away

953
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:50,267
from this neighborhood a little
bit, gets herself an education.

954
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,728
I don't see any
reason why she can't.

955
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:56,064
So the summer program
is basically free

956
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,482
if you're going
into engineering?

957
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:01,111
If you're interested in
one of those fields, right.

958
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:01,612
To me--

959
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,154
I like this place.

960
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:02,697
--this place fits you.

961
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:03,906
I think it would be good for me.

962
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,741
And it's all right here, Raven.

963
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,493
You're not going anywhere.

964
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,453
You're not going to get lost.

965
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,870
It's all right here.

966
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,248
OK, good job.

967
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,416
All right.

968
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:16,710
Whenever you have a question
and they talk about describing,

969
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,295
go back to that
section and just start

970
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,423
circling words that describe
stuff and see which ones match.

971
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:24,176
And that way you can
kind of save some time.

972
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,389
It'll make it more
like a direct answer.

973
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,350
So how are you feeling about it?

974
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,392
I'm ready to.

975
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:32,977
You're ready?

976
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,687
Yeah,
you're going to be awesome.

977
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,354
OK.

978
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,571
I think I did better on
this one than any other one.

979
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,197
I mean, I just tried my best.

980
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:51,120
If it doesn't work out,
then it doesn't work out.

981
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:01,087
Nobody is happy about
non-renewing valued

982
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,465
administrators,
especially our principals who

983
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,176
are on the front line.

984
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:20,357
We have been in a budget crisis
really for several years,

985
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,985
and this year is a
particularly bad one.

986
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,488
We need to preserve
all of the options

987
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,990
to close that really huge gap.

988
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:32,660
All of the administrators,
both at the school level

989
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:37,499
and at the district level,
whose contracts end this July,

990
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,585
have gotten non-renewal letters.

991
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,837
Everyone's jobs are on the line.

992
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,132
It doesn't matter
what the state says.

993
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:50,220
Everyone still might not have a
job, and that includes me.

994
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,722
Yesterday I got non-renewed.

995
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,724
It was a blanket
non-renewal, so they

996
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,602
non-renewed a lot of principals
throughout the district.

997
00:39:57,603 --> 00:40:01,106
"Dear Mr. Hockenberry,
thanks for your service.

998
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,608
In ordinance with
the high revise code,

999
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:08,113
this is to inform you that your
administrative contract expires

1000
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,448
and your services will
no longer be needed."

1001
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,409
You know, it happened
once before in my career.

1002
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,203
We found out the very next
day we all got brought back.

1003
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,913
But regardless,
whatever happens,

1004
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,916
one dead monkey don't stop
the circus down here at Oyler,

1005
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,293
and it's a good school.

1006
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,468
Miss Glott, or anybody with a
radio, come in, please.

1007
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:36,141
Could you ask them if they could
spot check Hatmaker Street,

1008
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,351
just so it looks nice?

1009
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,686
And if anybody else can
lend a helping hand,

1010
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,646
that would be great.

1011
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,313
I love you.

1012
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:41,981
Be careful.

1013
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,107
I love you too!

1014
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:44,983
Be careful.

1015
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,359
Mr. Hockenberry's
got some friends

1016
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,154
coming in to check out how smart we
are, what a great job

1017
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,322
we've been doing at Oyler.

1018
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,699
I expect nothing but
your best behavior.

1019
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,659
They're flying in from
Washington, DC.

1020
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,327
Whoa!

1021
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,496
And some other parts
of the country.

1022
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,666
Double check the
spelling of Weingartner

1023
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:07,338
by looking her up on the
internet not my sheet.

1024
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,339
It's fantastic!

1025
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:08,883
All right.

1026
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:11,009
Welcome to Oyler,
the pride of Cincinnati Public.

1027
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,260
All right?

1028
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,510
Thank you.

1029
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,303
Thank you.

1030
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,761
And everybody else, welcome.

1031
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,847
But yeah, I'm looking for an
assistant superintendent job,

1032
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,682
so if you need
anything, let me know.

1033
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,267
I will pack up--

1034
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,519
Let me explain something to you.

1035
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,769
We'd be happy to talk to you.

1036
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,104
Just shoot me an email.

1037
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:23,689
Yeah, I will.

1038
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,690
And I'll drop you my resume.

1039
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,358
OK.

1040
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,234
And things like that.

1041
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,027
Great.

1042
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,360
This is fantastic.

1043
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:33,114
I feel like we'll go do a ton
of things together on this.

1044
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,658
Thank you for making us come.

1045
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,243
Thank you for.

1046
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,497
Absolutely.

1047
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,581
All right, Raven.

1048
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:41,874
I'm gonna take a few here.

1049
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,389
1, 2, 3.

1050
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,396
OK, so what are you leaning to?

1051
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,273
NKU.

1052
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,815
Well,.

1053
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,234
Goodbye.

1054
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,695
Northern Kentucky University.

1055
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,446
So it's a done deal, right?

1056
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,322
All right.

1057
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,241
That's great.

1058
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,158
like this?

1059
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:17,868
All right.

1060
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,080
I like this.

1061
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,498
This is cute.

1062
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,708
Do you have favorite colors?

1063
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:29,212
Either pink, black, or blue.

1064
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,797
Pink and gray?

1065
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,090
No?

1066
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,049
OK.

1067
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,383
You want to try that one?

1068
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,426
Yeah.

1069
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,344
OK.

1070
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:37,638
I want to try every
dress there is here.

1071
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,473
Can you kind of turn from
one side to the other

1072
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:40,516
Can you kind of turn from one
side to the other and see what?

1073
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,184
and see what?

1074
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,522
Cute!

1075
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,692
Now we have to walk
around in them.

1076
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,614
Three people asked me,
but I don't know who to pick yet.

1077
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,621
"Dear Raven, on behalf of the
College of Mount St. Joseph,

1078
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,998
I am pleased to
inform you that you

1079
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:09,253
have been accepted as a
student beginning 2013 fall."

1080
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,256
All right, now we've got
to open the big, big one.

1081
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,138
OK. "Congratulations.

1082
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,099
I am pleased to
offer you admission

1083
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,687
to the College of Education for
fall 2013 at Penn State Greater

1084
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,023
Allegheny."

1085
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,650
Four years ago,
if I would have told myself

1086
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:37,488
that I was going to Penn
State for volleyball and stuff

1087
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,324
like that, I would have been
like, you're crazy.

1088
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:42,869
I would never believe it
because I was being bad.

1089
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,495
I always got suspended.

1090
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,705
I wasn't doing my work.

1091
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,875
I was always skipping school,
so I would never have believed it

1092
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,879
in a million years.

1093
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,680
I am a proud graduate of the
College of Mount St. Joe.

1094
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,933
But the truth be told,
I barely made it to the Mount.

1095
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:11,397
I was 46 out of 52
in my class ranking.

1096
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:16,486
I finished with a 1.9 GPA.

1097
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:21,407
I scored a 9 on my ACT,
and I didn't even show up

1098
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,869
for my scheduled SAT test.

1099
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,205
As the final days of
school came to an end,

1100
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,207
I was called to the
principal's office.

1101
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,543
I was greeted by a
man dressed in a suit,

1102
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,339
wearing the largest
ring I'd ever seen.

1103
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,466
The man turned
out to be a coach.

1104
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,344
He had just been
hired by the Mount

1105
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,887
to coach the first
ever football team.

1106
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,682
Essentially,
I was given a chance,

1107
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,018
one that would be taken away
if my grades didn't align

1108
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,355
with the Mount's standards.

1109
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,985
I'm going to remind you
all, every principal's worst

1110
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,570
nightmare,
that we wake up tomorrow

1111
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,530
morning and something
bad happened.

1112
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,074
So please, help each other out.

1113
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,617
Make sure you make
the right decisions.

1114
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,536
And I will be at
the after party.

1115
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,955
I heard where it is.

1116
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,498
I will be there.

1117
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,249
I can't wait.

1118
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,835
I want to see you there.

1119
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,466
Raven, it was really,
really exciting to have Raven.

1120
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:06,179
Because I remember Raven as a
five, six-year-old.

1121
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,723
I'm so proud of this girl.

1122
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,224
It's amazing to see
what you're doing.

1123
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,685
You're raising the standards
for your entire family, honey.

1124
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,728
And we're all so proud of you.

1125
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,773
Get up here,
because I have to stop now.

1126
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,950
What's up, Nate?

1127
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,786
How you doing?

1128
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:30,537
Good.

1129
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,829
Graduation tonight.

1130
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,539
Okey dokey.

1131
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,332
Big party,
big party on State Street.

1132
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,333
All righty!

1133
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,503
She forgot to come to
school this morning.

1134
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:38,879
Oh.

1135
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:41,005
Who suspended you?

1136
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:41,882
Me?

1137
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,342
It looks like they
brought me back,

1138
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,010
so we're moving in
the right direction.

1139
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:49,514
I did, indeed, find out this
week that I was coming back.

1140
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,182
It wasn't real fun,
I can tell you that.

1141
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:51,934
It was a tough time.

1142
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:53,351
But it seems like
things are moving

1143
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,686
in a very good direction.

1144
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,688
And by the time
negotiations are over,

1145
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,690
I think everything will be
working out really well.

1146
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,733
I'm looking forward to it.

1147
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,902
I was a little
confused at the salary.

1148
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,821
My pay was $10,000 less.

1149
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,157
This job's hard enough
doing around the clock work.

1150
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:12,579
I haven't had a pay raise in
six, seven years as it is.

1151
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,253
Hats aren't really
hair friendly.

1152
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,462
They really aren't.

1153
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,924
I can't believe I'm not
going to see you every day.

1154
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,217
You know,
I remember coming here when we only

1155
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,303
had two graduates at Oyler,
and here I am six years later,

1156
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,097
and there's 50
names on this list.

1157
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,057
So this really is fabulous.

1158
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,977
And you're one of the 50
fabulous, so congratulations.

1159
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:36,936
Thank you.

1160
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,938
I'm playing volley
ball for Penn State.

1161
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:39,565
Wow.

1162
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,065
Did they give you a scholarship?

1163
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,192
They gave me $4,000 this
year, but next year I'll

1164
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:43,944
be able to get more.

1165
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,028
Wonderful.

1166
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,656
Today's my favorite
day of the year.

1167
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:51,409
It's the day that every single
child at Oyler is working for,

1168
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,745
from the six week old infants
to the high school kids.

1169
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:58,249
And this is the day that eluded
their mothers, their fathers,

1170
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,251
their grandparents.

1171
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,211
Yeah, Crystal!

1172
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,588
Crystal!

1173
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,132
Go Crystal!

1174
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,762
Raven Olivia Gribbins.

1175
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,063
Richard Joseph Carter.

1176
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,111
Crystal Alexandra--

1177
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:39,499
Tassels from one
side to the other.

1178
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,465
Go Raven!

1179
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,509
I'm proud that she made it.

1180
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,095
And I can't wait to go see
her graduate from college.

1181
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:53,930
It's very special.

1182
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:57,184
She's the first one that
graduated from high school.

1183
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,645
I went to school there myself.

1184
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,188
I've got a ninth
grade education.

1185
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,272
I'm a carpenter.

1186
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,315
I do that for a living.

1187
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,567
That's what I do.

1188
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,656
Well, I had three other
sons, but this one

1189
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,990
was my first one to graduate.

1190
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,617
It was really great.

1191
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,161
I'm so proud of him.

1192
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,329
smile.

1193
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,623
Smile!

1194
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,291
Happy day!

1195
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:39,100
We talk all the time as a
staff about raising test scores

1196
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,686
and raising reading levels,
and all of that stuff

1197
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,063
is so important.

1198
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,357
But I firmly believe that
attacking the poverty

1199
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,819
is the most important
thing that we do.

1200
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,943
Yeah, yeah.

1201
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,570
I want to leave with
class, you know.

1202
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,407
There's a lot of people I'd
like to really save my mind to,

1203
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:40,036
but it won't help
anything, you know I mean?

1204
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:40,704
Yep.

1205
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:44,290
Yeah, I resigned last night
after 15 years at Oyler.

1206
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,333
So obviously you
knew about my woes.

1207
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,169
Cincinnati Public
made it pretty easy

1208
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,839
for me to make the decision,
but most importantly,

1209
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,716
the opportunity to
be a superintendent

1210
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:57,595
presented itself in
Manchester, Ohio.

1211
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,931
That should now read,
"You know I'm still sitting at my desk

1212
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,601
and crying." it's been
great being your secretary.

1213
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,395
Congratulations as
a superintendent,

1214
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,522
and now you can put
Manchester on the map

1215
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:13,111
just like you did Oyler."

1216
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,370
I'm scared I'm
going to get there,

1217
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,791
and then I'm going
to do real bad where

1218
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,126
I'm not going to get up
and be late to classes.

1219
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,129
Or like when I meet my
professors and stuff,

1220
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,466
I'm going to have a bad first
meeting, like a bad impression.

1221
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,470
Then I'm scared they're
not going to like me.

1222
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,014
It's a lot of things
you've got to think about.

1223
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,308
If you don't have your
Penn State ID yet,

1224
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,144
get some photo
identification ready.

1225
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,188
I got mine.

1226
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:54,611
Uh-oh.

1227
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,903
Uh-oh, it worked.

1228
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,488
They let you in.

1229
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,366
All right, well won't you kind
of start getting settled in.

1230
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,160
Me and your daddy
will carry it all in.

1231
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,502
Look how fluffy
them pillows are.

1232
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,672
You actually think
that bed looks OK?

1233
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:15,757
It's all right.

1234
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:17,259
She's not in the Navy.

1235
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,302
That's probably the best it's
going to look for a long time.

1236
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:20,846
Tuck it.

1237
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:22,012
Tuck it up underneath.

1238
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,807
No, because it's
supposed to be like this.

1239
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,475
Let your dad get
your TV hooked up.

1240
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,519
I know, right.

1241
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,189
going to cry again.

1242
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,275
Why are you crying?

1243
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,652
It'll be OK.

1244
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:47,706
Love you!

1245
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,550
All righty, I am out of here.

1246
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,051
I'll catch you later.

1247
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,219
Give me a call on my cellphone.

1248
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,054
Bye-bye.

1249
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,742
The test scores for
this past school

1250
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,535
year, they were troubling.

1251
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,912
There comes an opportunity
where you've just

1252
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,079
got to take ownership.

1253
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,874
Somebody's got to take
ownership of what happened,

1254
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,918
and that would be me.

1255
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,426
I'm taking each day
one day at a time

1256
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,887
because I was very,
very emotionally attached to Oyler.

1257
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,307
And I was very
protective of Oyler.

1258
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,434
I treated those kids as if
they were the last flower

1259
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,477
in the garden, you know.

1260
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,812
So it was tough.

1261
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,520
Renee.

1262
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,604
Give me a kiss.

1263
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,856
Say hi, camera.

1264
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,360
You going to wave to it?

1265
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:56,167
Miss Funk's got 14 kids who
went through my school, or 15.

1266
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,377
10.

1267
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:57,919
10.

1268
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,670
They felt like 15.

1269
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,755
Yeah, it did.

1270
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,842
Hey, Steve,
will you do me a favor?

1271
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:09,346
Walk down to Staebler,
just kind of peek down there.

1272
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,181
Because what they'll
do is they'll

1273
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,058
eventually start
balling up down there.

1274
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,853
Just see it and then come back.
