That is so Moral Majority.
You can't blame real-life

Yeah. Hello! The murderer
was wearing a ghostmask, okay?

188
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:59,689
Just like in the movie.
It's directly responsible.

189
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,276
No, it's not. Movies are not
responsible for our actions.

Life is life.
It doesn't imitate anything.

trying to make a real-life sequel?

200
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:32,989

203

- Name one.

205

Thank you. Ridley Scott rules.
Name another.

208
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:52,345
No. Allens is a classic, okay?
"Getaway from her, you bitch!"

209
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:54,932
I believe the line is
"Stay away from her, you bitch."
It's film class, right?

223
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,217
[Imitating Marlon Brando] Very good.
That's the Oscar-winning exception.

224
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:33,221

- All right, that's enough.

So, Mr Originality,
howwould you make it different?

228

I'd letthe geek getthe girl.

229

Three hundred people watched.
Nobody did anything.

230
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:55,813
They thought itwas a publicity stunt,
for Christ's sakes.

231
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,822
[With Cockney Accent]
And itwould have been a good one too.

232
00:16:57,898 --> 00:16:59,936
- It's starting again, Randy.
- It's not.

233
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,855
A lotof shit happens atthe movies.
People get robbed, shot,
maimed, murdered.

234
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,701
Multiplexes are a very dangerous place
to be these days.

235
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:07,871
Yeah, and you are
in extreme denial.

236
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,397
And you should be too.
This has nothing to do with us.

237

- You knowwhat happened
atWoodsboro, Randy.

- I know, Sid, but I don't
wantto go back there again.

241
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,383

for getting me back...

- Is Cici the girl's real name?
- Oh, uh, no.

663
00:41:43,782 --> 00:41:46,497
It's, uh, Casey.
Casey Cooper.

[Indlstlnct Chatter]

665
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:51,420
As in Casey Becker?

666
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:55,482
- [Hartley] Excuse me?
- She was a young victim in Woodsboro.

667
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:59,348
As well as her boyfriend, Steven Orth.

668
00:41:59,426 --> 00:42:01,399
As in Phil Stevens.

669
00:42:01,473 --> 00:42:05,115
Maureen Evans... Maureen Prescott.
That's Sidney's mother.

670
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:08,053
Do you think someone's
trying to duplicate Woodsboro?

671
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:10,363
It looks like it.

672
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:15,061
I think you have a copycat
on your hands, Chief.

00:42:17,565 --> 00:42:19,451
Whatare you doing
to keep Sidney safe?

675
00:42:19,516 --> 00:42:22,548
I gotmy two best
detectives guarding her.

676
00:42:22,715 --> 00:42:25,910
Do these guys have to follow
you around everywhere?

677

Oh. We're attached atthe hip.

- [Bells Chlmlng]
- How am I ever gonna getyou alone?

679
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:34,836
- [Laughs]
- You know, to be honest, Derek,

680
00:42:34,902 --> 00:42:38,130
I think itwould probably be
in your best interestto...

681
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:40,913
stay as far away
from me as possible.

682
00:42:42,677 --> 00:42:44,585
I hope thatwas an
off-the-cuff remark...

683
00:42:44,692 --> 00:42:47,822
that holds no subtextwhatsoever.

684
00:42:47,891 --> 00:42:51,631
No, actually. I mean it.

685
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:58,380
I mean, look atyou.
You already got hurt.

686
00:42:58,448 --> 00:43:01,163
I don'twantto see that happen again.

687
00:43:01,231 --> 00:43:03,084
I'll take my chances.

688
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,996
Derek, I'm serious.

689
00:43:06,063 --> 00:43:08,265
This is serious.

690
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:14,312
You are concerned with my
personal well-being and...

691
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:20,286
notwith trusting me
or anything, right?

692
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,054
Like I said, ljust don'twant
to see you get hurt.

693
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:29,533
And I don'twant
to see you get hurt.

694
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:31,459
Okay, Sid?

695
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,921
- Take care, Miss Weathers.
- All right.

696
00:43:47,617 --> 00:43:50,071
- Dewey.
- Chief.

697
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:53,085
HI.

698
00:43:53,151 --> 00:43:56,498
So, I'm heading overto admissions
to do some leg work. You game?

699
00:43:56,574 --> 00:43:59,060
I'm not here to write a book,
Miss Weathers.

00:43:59,134 --> 00:44:00,955
I'm here to help Sid.

701
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,524
I wantto help her, too.

702
00:44:05,596 --> 00:44:08,442
And help myself, of course.

703
00:44:10,395 --> 00:44:14,451
Come on, Dewey.
Smile justonce. Please?

704
00:44:16,217 --> 00:44:18,038
I'll smile when I catch the killer.

705
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:23,347
Gale, hi.
So who do you think did it?

706
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:25,747
WhataboutSidney's father?
Has he been ruled outas a suspect?

707
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:27,667
Well, he's supposedly
outofthe country on business,

708
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:29,554
butthatsounds a little fishy,
don'tyou think?

709
00:44:29,652 --> 00:44:32,650
- I'm not here to do your job, Miss Salt.
- Whataboutthis ex-cop, Dewey?

710
00:44:32,723 --> 00:44:34,958
- Kind of strange that he showed up.
- Yeah, what's he dolng here?

711
00:44:35,027 --> 00:44:38,124
Dewey's a good guy, unlike some of us.

712
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:42,478
Really?
[Sighs]

713
00:44:42,544 --> 00:44:45,990
Well, it justseems that ifthe killer
is repeating what happened in Woodsboro,

714
00:44:46,064 --> 00:44:50,818
it's quite possible thatthe killer
could be from Woodsboro, that's all.

715
00:44:52,782 --> 00:44:56,489
Derek, you think Sid will letme
interview herformy documentary?

716

Oh, yeah. You know, she turned down

- Butforyou, yeah.
- Drop it.

I've been thinking
aboutthis whole murderthing.

719
00:45:05,865 --> 00:45:07,903
- Have they checked out Randy?
- What?

720
00:45:07,976 --> 00:45:11,073
I know he's an innocentvictim the first
time around, but he's a little off.

- You knowwhat I'm saying?
- Come on. Randy? The guy's harmless.

- Guys, keep it down.

to just deal with thatand move on.

I mean, when my mom leftmy dad,
I accepted it.

That's the way the cookie crumbles.
Moms leave.

00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:11,477
Yeah, yourmom lefttown. She's not
buried in a cemetery somewhere.

793

My mom's dead, and she's
never coming back. Ever.

- Ooh, I love scary movies.

00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,606
I'll waitforvideo.
Okay, let's get down to business.

796
00:49:23,675 --> 00:49:25,648
The way I see it,
someone's outto make a sequel.

797
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,727
You know, cash in on all
the movie murder hoopla.

798
00:49:27,802 --> 00:49:30,484
So It's our job to observe
the rules ofthe sequel.

799
00:49:30,585 --> 00:49:33,039
Number one:
the body count is always bigger.

800
00:49:33,112 --> 00:49:37,365
Numbertwo: the death scenes are always
more elaborate... more blood, more gore.

801
00:49:37,463 --> 00:49:40,244
Carnage candy.
Your core audience justexpects it.

802
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:44,168
Numberthree: if you wantyour sequel
to become a franchise, never ever...

803
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:46,414
How do we find the killer, Randy?
That's what I wanna know.

804
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,904
Oh.
Let's look atthe suspects.

805
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,077
There's Derek, the obvious boyfriend.
Hello, Billy Loomis.

806
00:49:52,146 --> 00:49:54,414
The guy's premed,
and his pity-me surface wound...

807
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:57,130
conveniently missed
every majorvein and artery.

808
00:49:57,201 --> 00:50:00,396
- So you think it's Derek?
- Notso fast.

809
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,732
Let's assume the killer, or'ers,
has a half a brain.

810
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,969
He's nota Nlck At Nlte
rerun type of guy.

811
00:50:05,038 --> 00:50:06,891
He wants to break some new ground.

812
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:09,029
- Right? So forgetthe boyfriend.
- Right.

813
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:11,434
- It's tired. Who else do we got?
- There's...

814
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:14,183
Mickey, the freaky
Tarantino film student.

815
00:50:16,074 --> 00:50:19,389
But if he's a suspect, so am I.
So, let's move on.

816
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:21,319
Whoa, waita...
Let's notmove on.

817
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,839
Maybe you are a suspect.

818
00:50:23,912 --> 00:50:26,496
Well, if I'm a suspect,
you're a suspect.

819
00:50:28,424 --> 00:50:31,390
You have a point.

820
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:34,691
- Okay, let's move on to...
- Hallie.

821
00:50:34,757 --> 00:50:36,927
- Sid's roommate?
- Uh-huh.

822
00:50:36,997 --> 00:50:39,003
Serial killers
are typicallywhite males.

823
00:50:39,108 --> 00:50:42,587
That's why it's perfect. It's sort of
againstthe rules, but not really.

824
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:45,472
Mrs Voorhees was
a terrific serial killer.

825
00:50:45,538 --> 00:50:47,708
And there's always room
for Candyman's daughter.

826
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:50,427
She's sweet. She's deadly.
She's bad foryourteeth.

827
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,991
Come on, Randy.
These kids are yourfriends.

828
00:50:56,063 --> 00:50:58,298
Who do you think's the killer?

829
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:01,529
- How about Gale Weathers?
- Gale? A killer?

830
00:51:01,598 --> 00:51:05,490
- Why not?
- Well, she is vicious enough.

831
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:07,865
- She's an opportunist.
- Yeah.

832
00:51:07,963 --> 00:51:10,133
Isn't itconceivable
she's planning her next book?

833
00:51:10,203 --> 00:51:13,617
That's what reporters do, Dewey.
They stage the news.

834
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:16,536
No. Gale's a lotofthings,
but Gale's nota killer.

835
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,217
- Just because you're sweeton her...
- No, I'm not.

836
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:21,229
Please, this is me talking.
Randy,

837
00:51:21,303 --> 00:51:23,603
the unrequited love-slave
of Sidney Prescott.

838
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:26,157
I know all aboutobsession...

839
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,051
and pain.

840
00:51:28,117 --> 00:51:31,411
- You've gotyour love scarto prove it.
- And so do you.

841
00:51:31,476 --> 00:51:34,289
And what's with that limp anyway?
'Cause you were stabbed in the back.

842
00:51:34,356 --> 00:51:37,770
Severed nerve.
Look, Gale's no killer.

843
00:51:38,898 --> 00:51:41,318
Okay, okay.
Whateveryou say.

844
00:51:41,394 --> 00:51:44,458
But if she's nota killer,
she's a target.

845
00:51:46,543 --> 00:51:48,484
Joel, let's get
some establishing shots.

846
00:51:48,592 --> 00:51:50,445
Um, Gale, can we talk for a sec?

847
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:52,811
- What is it?
- Look, I'm a little confused here.

848
00:51:52,878 --> 00:51:54,851
I mean, with your given track record,

849
00:51:54,925 --> 00:51:56,963
whywould you wanna be here
when the killer strikes again?

850
00:51:57,036 --> 00:52:00,264
I mean, granted, I should've
read your book before I took this job.

851
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:02,369
But I'm reading it now,
and... Whoo!

852
00:52:02,475 --> 00:52:04,383
I read what happened
to your lastcameraman.

853
00:52:04,459 --> 00:52:07,010
The guy got gutted.
Now, me,

854
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:09,054
I'm gonna do whatany
rational human being would do,

855
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:10,916
which is getthe fuck outof here.

856
00:52:10,984 --> 00:52:15,105
Firstof all, he wasn't gutted.
I made that up. His throatwas slashed.

857
00:52:15,175 --> 00:52:19,101
Whatare you... Gale, gutted, slashed...
The guy ain't in the union no more.

858
00:52:19,174 --> 00:52:20,995
It's a job, Joel.

859
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:23,231
And like every job,
there's a few drawbacks.

860
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:26,715
Butyou're a professional cameraman.
You've gotto act like one.

861
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:29,153
Yeah, but I wanna report the news.
I don'twanna be the news.

862
00:52:29,218 --> 00:52:31,835
Besides, brothers don't last long
in situations like this.

863
00:52:31,905 --> 00:52:35,612
This is national television.
Think about it.

864
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,501
This is a big chance foryou.

865
00:52:37,568 --> 00:52:40,283
The story is monumental.
Don'tyou wanna be a part ofthat?

866
00:52:41,311 --> 00:52:43,000
Come on.

867
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:46,385
I need you.
I cannot do this withoutyou.

868
00:52:49,214 --> 00:52:51,100
Good. Come on.

869
00:52:51,164 --> 00:52:54,392
- Let's getsome work done.
- Yeah, let's go get killed.

870
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:01,422
We've been through thls before.
You knowwhat I thlnk about
your potentlal as an actress.

871
00:53:01,496 --> 00:53:03,317
I know. I know.

872
00:53:03,385 --> 00:53:06,133
It-It's justthatwith,
um, the murders...

873
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:09,427
and the movie and my life...

874
00:53:09,495 --> 00:53:12,144
I do know how difficult
it is foryou.

875
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,399
Gus, l-ljust...
I don'tthink I can do it.

876
00:53:16,468 --> 00:53:20,142
The battle forthe soul is
fought in the forum of art.

877
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:23,439
You're a fighter, Sid. That's why you're
here. That's why this is yourmajor.

878
00:53:23,507 --> 00:53:25,709
- Yeah, I'm a fighter.
- I didn't hearthat.

879
00:53:27,346 --> 00:53:30,246
- I'm a fighter.
- I don't believe you.

880
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:34,476
I don't.

881
00:53:36,238 --> 00:53:38,822
I'm a fighter.

882
00:53:38,894 --> 00:53:40,715
Okay.

883
00:53:42,733 --> 00:53:45,830
So, atthe risk of sounding
like a college drama teacher,

884
00:53:45,899 --> 00:53:48,680
if you've got pain around
this kind of material, use it.

885
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:51,298
This is your role, Sid.

Itwas herfate,
and she embraced it.

you can honestly face it...

893
00:54:15,714 --> 00:54:17,535
and fight it.

894
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:24,126
