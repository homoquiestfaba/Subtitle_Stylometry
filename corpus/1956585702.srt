It's the network.

1564
01:15:26,768 --> 01:15:28,866
They're taking your show
off the air.

1565
01:15:28,868 --> 01:15:30,031
What?

1566
01:15:30,033 --> 01:15:32,432
No. I'll be...
I'll be bankrupt.

1567
01:15:32,434 --> 01:15:33,898
Who will buy all these houses?

1568

Okay, watch this.
Now's my chance.

I think I can help you

get rid of those houses.

1572
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:46,232
- What are you talking about?
- Well, my dear,

1573
01:15:46,234 --> 01:15:49,098
you've got a bunch of houses
you need to get rid of,

1574
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,734

I need to get rid of.

1576

Excuse me. I'm Trudy.

We never officially met...

Ah, yes. The toilet woman.

01:16:03,067 --> 01:16:04,265
Right.

1583
01:16:14,868 --> 01:16:17,332
I spent time
with these people,

1584
01:16:17,334 --> 01:16:21,298
and it is true, they are odd.

1585
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:22,998
But we shouldn't judge them

1586
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,998
just because
they're different.

Howdy, neighbor.
How's the new house?

1598
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:05,399
Oh, I love it. I hope
you brought your umbrellas.

1599
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:09,232
Oh, you put in a typhoon.
What a great idea.

Who would have thought
a guy like me, a total zero,

1611
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:38,332
would have ended up with you,
an also zero?

1612
