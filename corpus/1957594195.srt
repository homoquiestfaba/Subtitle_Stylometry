1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,633
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:13,767
(surf rock music)

3
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,733
(alarm clock ringing)

4
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:32,733
- [Voiceover] Josh, you
 had better get out of bed.

5
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:34,933
You are going to
 be late for school.

6
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,100
- I'm up, mom.

7
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,533
Gotta get a smaller bed.

8
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,333
Come on, come on.

9
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:47,833
Tomorrow I'll try
 it with my shoes on.

10
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,833
- And how are we this morning?

11
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,300
- Late for science class.

12
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,900
- See man, I give you
 perfectly good cheer

13
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,767
and all you can give
 me in return is,

14
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,867
"I'm late for science class."

15
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:05,967
What's wrong?

16
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,833
- I measured myself
 this morning.

17
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:09,667
- And?

18
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,333
- I'm five foot three
 and a third inches.

19
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,333
- You measured your
hair again, didn't you?

20
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,467
- Hair counts!

21
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:19,600
Look, I'm never gonna be tall.

22
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,233
I'm 5'3", and do you
 know what that means?

23
00:04:23,233 --> 00:04:25,967
It means third grade girls
 are taller than I am.

24
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,167
I sit around on Friday nights

25
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,300
and I build my
 stupid inventions.

26
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,267
That's it, that's my
 life in a nutshell.

27
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:35,367
- Well, maybe you can
 invent a girlfriend.

28
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,533
- I'm being serious, Rudy.

29
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,333
- Josh, you've gotta
 lighten up a little.

30
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,267
I mean, there's lots of

31
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,133
undersized guys who achieved
 greatness and stuff.

32
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,067
- Like who?

33
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,733
- Napoleon.

34
00:04:58,267 --> 00:05:02,433
- Well, that's great, if
 I want to conquer Europe.

35
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,400
- Spud Webb.

36
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,533
- He's an athlete,
 so it evens out.

37
00:05:08,533 --> 00:05:09,767
Girls don't care if you're short

38
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:13,067
if you're good at
 sports, and I'm not.

39
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:16,533
- Okay, how about those midget
 guys from The Wizard of Oz?

40
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,167
I mean, they seemed to do
 pretty good by themselves.

41
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,533
They got to be in a movie,

42
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,567
they got to wear
 those cool shoes.

43
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:25,733
- Rudy, if you're trying to
 cheer me up, just forget it.

44
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,333
I'm just gonna have
 to live with people

45
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:29,733
calling me "half
 pint" and "shorty" for
 the rest of my life.

46
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,233
That's all.

47
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,133
And Courtney Wilson's
 never gonna like me.

48
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:33,967
- Whoa!

49
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:38,367
Courtney Wilson?

50
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:41,100
The hottest senior
 at our school?

51
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,067
- No, Courtney Wilson
 the U.S. senator.

52
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,867
Of course Courtney Wilson
 who goes to our school.

53
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:48,300
It doesn't matter anyways.

54
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,233
She's never gonna notice me.

55
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,233
Girls just don't
like short guys.

56
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,133
- Says who?

57
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,800
- They just don't, okay!?

58
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,467
They like big, hulking
 guys with muscles.

59
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,367
- Well then, if you
 really think that way,

60
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:04,833
maybe you should
 aim a little lower.

61
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,733
- Like who?

62
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:11,067
- Well, there's crazy
Bertha, the lunch lady.

63
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,233
(laughing)

64
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,433
Wait!

65
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,833
Wait, I haven't
 even got to the gals

66
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:23,067
at the old folks'
 home yet (laughs).

67
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,500
(school bell rings)

68
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:49,467
Do it.

69
00:07:00,467 --> 00:07:04,167
- [Josh] There it is, first
 prize at the science fair.

70
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:08,400
- Dude, if that was a chick,
 I'd marry her on the spot.

71
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,867
- Don't get too excited.

72
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:13,433
We still have to make a
few adjustments to it.

73
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,933
Props aren't working
 at full capacity

74
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:17,433
and I want to make sure
 the oxygen mix is dead on.

75
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,067
- Oxygen mix?

76
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,900
What does a model sub
need an oxygen mix for?

77
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,167
It's not like
somebody's really gonna

78
00:07:22,167 --> 00:07:23,900
ride around in it, right?

79
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,400
- Well, the whole
 point is to make

80
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,567
an absolute scale replica
 of a submersible, Rudy.

81
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:29,967
I mean, it's gotta be
 just like the real thing.

82
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:33,467
Real pressurization, real
 controls, and a real engine.

83
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:34,800
The whole works.

84
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,067
If it's not like the real thing,

85
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,267
well then we might
 as well have made it

86
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,400
out of a soda bottle
 and some rubber bands.

87
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,367
- Hey, what's wrong with soda
 bottles and rubber bands?

88
00:07:42,367 --> 00:07:43,200
- Nothing,

89
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,600
if you dig getting a
 D in science class.

90
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,933
- Hey look, guys.

91
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,733
It's the Midget Express.

92
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:53,367
(make motor sound with mouth)

93
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:56,533
(classmates laughing)

94
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,967
What's your stupid science
 project about this year?

95
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,967
How a five year old
 got into high school?

96
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,133
- Oh, give it back, Blake.

97
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,233
- Sure, you got it, Stretch.

98
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:17,400
Just reach up and grab it.

99
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:20,233
(laughing)

100
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,233
Here, I'll help you out.

101
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,367
Nope, seems like you're
still a little short.

102
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,467
- Okay, that's great.

103
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,267
You had your laugh for the day.

104
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:32,500
You made me look
 like a genetic freak

105
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,167
and everybody thinks
 you're wonderful.

106
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:37,567
Now just give me back my model
 sub and we'll call it a day.

107
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:38,600
- Sure, you got it.

108
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,267
Just do one thing for me.

109
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:41,600
- What's that?

110
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,767
- Say "Give me back me
Lucky Charms" (laughs).

111
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,767
But seriously Josh, how's
 the weather down there?

112
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,200
- Not bad, Blake.

113
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,700
How's the weather up there?

114
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,400
Partly to mostly stupid with
 a chance of steroids later on?

115
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,200
- Bad move, Tiny.

116
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,733
You wouldn't like it so
much if I crammed this

117
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:01,867
dorky crackerjack little toy
 down your throat, would ya?

118
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:04,333
(school bell rings)

119
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,700
Oops.

120
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,833
(shattering)

121
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,600
I'll get back to
you later, runt.

122
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,333
- Very impressive.

123
00:09:21,267 --> 00:09:23,633
- Thanks, Courtney.

124
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:26,133
- Let me guess, the
 Nautilus, right?

125
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:29,667
From Twenty Thousand
 Leagues Under the Sea?

126
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,833
It's amazing, Josh.

127
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,767
- Yeah, that's right.

128
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:36,733
It's a replica of the Nautilus.

129
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,600
But how did you know?

130
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,100
- How'd I know it
 was the Nautilus?

131
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,433
- Yeah, that.

132
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:45,533
- Jules Verne is
 my favorite author,

133
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:47,067
and Twenty Thousand
 Leagues Under the Sea

134
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49,067
is my all time favorite book.

135
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:49,900
- Really?

136
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,233
- I do read
occasionally, you know.

137
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:55,067
- Sorry.

138
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,733
It's just...

139
00:09:57,733 --> 00:10:00,700
See, most cheerleaders are
 too busy lookin' over the top

140
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,000
of my head at all the tall
 jocks on the other side.

141
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,300
Do you know what I mean?

142
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,567
- Maybe you just haven't been

143
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,200
meeting the right
 cheerleaders then.

144
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,033
- Maybe not.

145
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,600
- I'll tell you what,
 my parents are going

146
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,433
out of town this weekend,
 and I was kind of planning

147
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,933
on having a party
 tonight at the Water Den.

148
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,367
You know, the new under 21 club.

149
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,267
Do you think maybe
 you'd wanna come out?

150
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:27,000
'Cause I'd love
 to see you there.

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,833
- Really?

152
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,433
Well, what about your
 boyfriend Blake over there?

153
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,933
I mean, he'd stomp
 me into hamster mulch

154
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,667
if I showed up at your party.

155
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,267
- You're my guest, okay?

156
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:39,633
And Rudy too if
 he wants to come.

157
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,800
Blake won't give
 you any problems.

158
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,133
He's invited all his
 friends, so I should be able

159
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:48,167
to invite the people I like
 hanging out with too, right?

160
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,600
- I don't think it's
 such a good idea.

161
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,133
- Well, the two of you are
 invited if you'd like to come.

162
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,867
- Hey Courtney,
 you comin' or what?

163
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,733
- I gotta go.

164
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,067
Be at the party around nine.

165
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,233
- Well?

166
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,067
- Well, it doesn't
 look like Blake

167
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:14,600
broke too much on the sub.

168
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,833
- Not that, man.

169
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,200
I mean the stuff over
 there with Courtney.

170
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,367
What happened?

171
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,700
- I think she invited us to
 a party at the Water Den.

172
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,133
- That's great!

173
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,800
And you thought she
 wouldn't even notice you.

174
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,467
- Well, on the one hand,
maybe she likes me.

175
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:37,467
And then on the other hand,

176
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:39,967
maybe she just feels
 really sorry for me.

177
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,633
- Hey, don't worry, man.

178
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,967
How do you think I
 get most of my dates?

179
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,967
- Good morning, class.

180
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:51,067
- [Students] Good
 morning, Mr. Duncan.

181
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,533
- Thank you.

182
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,267
Now, as you all know,
 we will continue

183
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:58,700
our extensive preparation
 for Monday's science fair.

184
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,433
As I gaze out on
 this vast cornucopia

185
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:05,933
of high school scientific
achievement laid out before me,

186
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,867
I am confident that this
 year's first prize winner

187
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,167
will be someone in this class.

188
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,433
Who will it be?

189
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:18,633
So, let us proceed into the
mysterious realm of the unknown,

190
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,567
in the name of science.

191
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,367
- [Student] Okay,
 whatever, Mr. Duncan.

192
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:29,067
- Hey honey, is the
 project done yet?

193
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,767
- Well, we still have
 to write the report

194
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,600
that goes along
 with the experiment.

195
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,967
I mean, I could use
 some help, you know?

196
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:40,500
- Yeah but sugar, I'm really
 bad at writing reports.

197
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,833
You're so good at it, you know?

198
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,233
I mean, with football practice
 and trying to get everybody

199
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:49,400
together for the party tonight,
I just don't have the time.

200
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:52,467
I'm doing this all for you.

201
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:55,367
You know that,
 don't you Courtney?

202
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,567
- Really?

203
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,867
- Absolutely.

204
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:01,133
Nothing but the
 best for my girl.

205
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,633
- Okay, I guess I
 can take care of it.

206
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,100
- Hello.

207
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,533
Ooh, well, very
 impressive, Mr. Campbell.

208
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,433
You know, in all my
 years of teaching,

209
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:14,433
I have never seen
 such a well-made

210
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:18,067
or elaborately constructed
 science project.

211
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,067
Just between you and me,
 my man: You are a shoe-in

212
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,933
to win this year's
 science award.

213
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,667
- Thanks, Mr. Duncan.

214
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,600
- You know, it kind of
 reminds me, when I was

215
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,167
a young high school science
 student like yourself,

216
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,867
I built my very own time machine

217
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,800
in the first annual
 science fair.

218
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,433
- Wow, a time machine?

219
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:38,400
- Yeah.

220
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,367
- Did it work?

221
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:40,833
- No.

222
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,533
But it took out about half
 a block of power lines

223
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,200
when I turned it on.

224
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,567
Gone, man.

225
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:47,400
See ya.

226
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:56,767
- What are you so nervous about?

227
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:59,433
I mean, Courtney invited
 you to the party, big guy.

228
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:01,367
The hard part's over with.

229
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:04,700
- First of all, all
 my clothes look bad.

230
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,733
- Your clothes look fine, dude.

231
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,367
Your face, on the other
 hand, might be a problem.

232
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:13,367
- Oh, ha ha.

233
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:15,767
We have an hour till
 this thing starts

234
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:18,333
and I look like
 my mom dressed me.

235
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:21,067
- It's totally
 psychological, Josh.

236
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:23,200
I mean, nothing in your closet
 is gonna seem good enough

237
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,333
for Courtney as far
 as your brain goes.

238
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,633
You just need to lighten
up and be yourself.

239
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:30,833
And anyway, I might
 have a solution

240
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,200
that might impress the ladies.

241
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,233
- Yeah?

242
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:35,467
- Cell phones, dude.

243
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,233
They had a sale on 'em
down at the Circuit Hut.

244
00:14:37,233 --> 00:14:38,700
I picked up a couple.

245
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,267
We each get one, and they
 are state of the art.

246
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:46,200
- A cell phone's gonna
 make us look cool?

247
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,500
- Yes, Bob, I think we should
 set up a morning appointment

248
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,700
with the board members and
 put this deal together.

249
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,133
Hey, can you hold on a sec?

250
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,333
Why hello there, ladies.

251
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:59,233
Let me finish up this very
 important business call.

252
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,400
Then I can properly
introduce myself to you.

253
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,667
- Rudy, we're 17 years old.

254
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,400
I seriously doubt
 anybody's gonna think

255
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,633
we're a couple of
 Wall Street tycoons.

256
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,300
- Dude, you're gonna
have to take it from me.

257
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,567
I mean, I get results.

258
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,667
And besides, I mean,
 like, if nothing else,

259
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,233
we can occasionally
 buzz each other

260
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:17,667
and make like the
 dude on the other end

261
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,500
is the record company CEO.

262
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,433
- Well, there's just
 one other thing.

263
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,600
- What's that?

264
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:30,200
- Five feet three
 and a third inches.

265
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,133
- Isn't it technically just
 five feet and three inches?

266
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,333
I mean, you measured
 your hair and everything.

267
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,800
- That's not
 important right now.

268
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,367
The important thing is
 that Courtney dates Blake.

269
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:40,967
Blake's a tall guy.

270
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,200
Meanwhile, I get all
the Simon Birch chicks.

271
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,100
- So let me get this straight.

272
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,067
You think if you were
 tall, then Courtney

273
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,933
would dump Blake
 and go after you?

274
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:51,767
- Exactly.

275
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,167
- That's a real great
 plan, pal of mine,

276
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,067
except for one small hitch.

277
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,500
- What's that?

278
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,833
- It's the whole pesky "human
 beings don't grow taller

279
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,900
"in an hour" bit
 that has me worried.

280
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,367
- Stranger things have happened.

281
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:07,067
- Get a grip, Josh.

282
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,300
It can't be done.

283
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,633
I mean, the best
 thing I can do for you

284
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:10,867
is take you down to the mall

285
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,733
and we'll pick up
 some elevator loafers.

286
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:16,900
- I'm trying to impress
 Courtney, not scare her off.

287
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:23,400
Okay, so maybe it wasn't
such a great idea.

288
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,700
Maybe I am letting this
 thing go to my head a little.

289
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,133
- All I'm saying is Courtney
 asked you to the party.

290
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,533
It turns out she's great lookin'

291
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,867
and she's a halfway
 decent human being.

292
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,233
I'm gonna assume she wouldn't
 have asked you to the party

293
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:41,400
if she didn't really like you,
 so close your eyes and jump.

294
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,900
I mean, have a little
 faith in yourself.

295
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,200
- That's easy for you to say.

296
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,833
I mean, look at you.

297
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:49,100
You're normal sized.

298
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,800
All I want is just
 one time where

299
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,767
I don't have my
 size thrown at me

300
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:53,867
or have it be another reason why

301
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:56,333
I can't be like everybody else.

302
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,233
That's all.

303
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:01,067
- Well, I mean, you're
this great inventor guy.

304
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:03,200
I mean, why don't you use
 that to help yourself out?

305
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,633
- Like how, Rudy?

306
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:06,100
I work with gears
 and circuit boards,

307
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,200
not, you know, genetics or
 biology or anything like that.

308
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,833
- Maybe there's a
 way out of this.

309
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,067
I mean, if you
 really want to do it.

310
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:18,933
- What way?

311
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,267
- I don't know, I mean,
it's kind of drastic.

312
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:24,067
- Well don't tell me.

313
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:26,233
- Molly Ethersol.

314
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,633
- Molly Ethersol?

315
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,600
- If there's anything
 you need, she can get it.

316
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,067
- The Molly Ethersol?

317
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:35,400
Crazy Molly, the hacker?

318
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,800
Didn't they kick her
out of school last year

319
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,767
for changing everybody's
midterm grade to like a Z minus?

320
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,800
- That's the one.

321
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,400
- Oh boy.

322
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,733
- She's not gonna do it for
 free, but I hooked her up

323
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,267
with my cousin Freddy last year

324
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,533
when she needed a date to
 the Babylon 5 convention.

325
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:53,133
So, I'd probably get us a deal.

326
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:56,733
- I don't know about this.

327
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:59,233
- Hey, desperate times call
 for desperate measures.

328
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:01,733
Do you want to do this or not?

329
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:04,900
- Sure.

330
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:07,067
Alright.

331
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,067
What do we do now?

332
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,667
- You knock on the
garage door three times.

333
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,633
(loud knock)

334
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,400
Three times, man!

335
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,933
(loud knocking)

336
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:43,200
- I don't think she's home.

337
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:51,600
- What do you want?

338
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,067
- Hold on there, rocket ranger.

339
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:54,500
We come in peace.

340
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,267
You remember me.

341
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:58,767
Rudy.

342
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,067
I did you a solid about a
 year ago when you needed

343
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,867
an escort to the
 Babylon 5 convention.

344
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:06,100
- Yes, my sensors
 detected your presence

345
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,267
the moment you stepped
 into my driveway.

346
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:10,800
However, I'm not
 familiar with him,

347
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,233
the short one in the
 little boys' clothes.

348
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,733
- Hey!

349
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:17,200
- Yeah, that's Josh.

350
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,933
He's a little sensitive
 about the whole size thing.

351
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:21,833
- Whatever.

352
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,733
Why have you come to The Matrix?

353
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,100
- The Matrix?

354
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,933
- This is The Matrix, my domain.

355
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:32,367
And you two infidels
 are wasting my time.

356
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:37,667
- Look Molly, we need some help.

357
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,367
Josh here needs to
grow about three inches

358
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:43,433
in the next 45 minutes,
and I figured that maybe

359
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,067
you could tap into the net.

360
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,733
Crack a few government codes,
 find some restricted info

361
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:50,467
on how we might go
 about doing this.

362
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,733
- Are you for real?

363
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,467
- Well, I mean, I
 know it sounds silly.

364
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:58,867
- Everybody knows that
only the Borg possesses

365
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:02,333
the growth stimulation
 technology.

366
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:05,333
- Right, that's what I was just
telling my buddy over here,

367
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,067
but I figured that
maybe we could sit down

368
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:10,133
at your computer there
 and check into it anyway,

369
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:11,633
just for a hoot.

370
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:14,167
- I swore never to use my
 computer infiltration skills

371
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,267
for my own personal gain.

372
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,933
- There's 50 bones
 in it for you.

373
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,233
- You got a deal, babe.

374
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,367
- Wow, so you
 actually have sensors

375
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:28,900
that can detect people
 in the driveway?

376
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,733
- No.

377
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,967
- So, we're on the net now?

378
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:46,433
- Yes, we have
 entered cyberspace.

379
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:47,767
- What's happenin' now?

380
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:50,133
- I'm accessing the
 usual search engines.

381
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:51,567
We'll search for the
 proper net address

382
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,867
via the topic
 "genetic alteration."

383
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:56,200
- Genetic alteration?

384
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,767
That doesn't sound very safe.

385
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:02,567
- Would you rather it be called
"happy grow" or something?

386
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,067
- You never told me why
 your undersized friend here

387
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:05,767
needs to grow in 45 minutes.

388
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,633
- Hey, my name's Josh, okay?

389
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,167
And I'm not that undersized.

390
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:11,633
- Well, see, Josh got invited

391
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:13,633
to this party by
Courtney Wilson,

392
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:15,067
and he thinks the only way

393
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:18,367
she'll go out with
 him is if he's tall.

394
00:21:18,367 --> 00:21:19,867
- How sad.

395
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:21,667
Have you tried stilts?

396
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:25,600
- Hey, I am not gonna
 wear stilts, okay?

397
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,367
- Okay, gentlemen.

398
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:28,967
It appears I have found a place

399
00:21:28,967 --> 00:21:31,533
that might cater to your needs.

400
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:33,067
It's a little out
 of the way site

401
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:36,833
for a company called Miss
 Thang Pharmaceuticals.

402
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:42,300
They specialize in DNA
 recoding, mutation,

403
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,933
cough syrup, snack
 foods, the usual.

404
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:47,267
- Mutation?

405
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:49,333
- It might be a little
 tricky getting in.

406
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:52,133
- Wait, no one ever said
 anything about mutation, okay?

407
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:54,067
I think it would kind of defeat
the purpose if I showed up

408
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,167
to this party with like
three arms or something.

409
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,700
- Why not?

410
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,833
I think a man with three
 arms is quite attractive.

411
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:01,867
(beeping)

412
00:22:01,867 --> 00:22:03,267
Uh oh.

413
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:04,267
- Uh oh?

414
00:22:04,267 --> 00:22:05,333
What does "uh oh" mean?

415
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,167
- This is a restricted site.

416
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:08,100
Looks like I might have to cut

417
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,200
some of this ICE to get inside.

418
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,800
- ICE?

419
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,267
- ICE.

420
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:16,333
It's hacker slang for a computer
system's defensive program.

421
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:18,867
Didn't you ever read
 any William Gibson?

422
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:21,067
Neuromancer, Account Zero?

423
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,067
- I read Dr. Seuss once.

424
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:26,867
- You guys are so unhip.

425
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:29,600
It's a wonder your
 pants stay on.

426
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,733
- Hey, what's that?

427
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:37,933
- It's a codebreaker program.

428
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:39,533
I made it myself.

429
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:43,700
I drop this on their defenses
 and it's goodbye ICE.

430
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:47,367
Wow, this company must be
 buying their security soft

431
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,633
from the back of some guy's van.

432
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:51,567
It didn't even put up a fight.

433
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:53,533
- So we're in?

434
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,200
- We are totally in.

435
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:02,867
Looks like we're in some
 kind of gray ops network,

436
00:23:02,867 --> 00:23:04,967
stuff on the fringe of
 being legal and I'm guessing

437
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:09,533
none of this stuff has
 been approved by the FDA.

438
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:12,967
There it is, Growth
 Alteration Formula.

439
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:16,267
- Umm, maybe now is not a
 good time to bring this up

440
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:19,833
but are we kind of
 like breaking the law?

441
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,667
- Only if you get caught, and
 I have never gotten caught.

442
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,133
(laughing)

443
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,600
- What's so funny?

444
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,700
- Except that time you
 got kicked out of school.

445
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,700
- I was in a different
 place back then.

446
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,767
- You mean like Earth?

447
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:32,800
- Do you nonbelievers want to--

448
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,167
- Okay, okay, let's do it!

449
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:37,500
Okay, let's do it,
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

450
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,233
- That's it, that's the formula.

451
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:51,500
- You're sure?

452
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,867
- Well, it says "Growth
Alteration," doesn't it?

453
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,267
I'm pretty sure
 somebody wouldn't make

454
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,800
a secret formula to
 grow shorter, right?

455
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,633
- Why not?

456
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,133
- Look, do you want
 the formula or not?

457
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:04,600
This isn't exactly
 a deal where you can

458
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,167
shop around for a better
deal, know what I mean?

459
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:11,800
- Well, like, how do you get
 half of this stuff anyways?

460
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,967
I mean, where do you get
anionic surfactant number five?

461
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:20,267
- It's in lipstick, see?

462
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:22,500
The chemical list
 includes a corollary

463
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,267
found in household products.

464
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:25,833
That's the great part.

465
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,300
You can mix this stuff
up in your own kitchen.

466
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,967
It's not even toxic.

467
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:36,067
Well, I can print this out
 for you or I can hit "delete"

468
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:38,833
and make like this
 never happened.

469
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:43,767
- Go ahead, print it.

470
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:47,933
- Hold on a sec, space princess.

471
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:49,600
What if this stuff
 winds up turning Josh

472
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,733
into a puddle of
 goo or something?

473
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:54,833
- What do you want, a
 money back guarantee?

474
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,700
Look, whatever happens when
 you two middle class drones

475
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,667
leave my garage is totally
 your problem, not mine.

476
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,067
I just work here.

477
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:12,200
- Are you sure you
 want to do this?

478
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,400
- I'll do it.

479
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,067
(menacing organ music)

480
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,233
- [Dr. Krackle] Speak.

481
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:45,800
- Sorry to disturb you, Doctor,

482
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,900
but the computer technicians
 have just detected

483
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,267
an intruder on the mainframe.

484
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:53,400
Someone has broken the
security counter system.

485
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,300
They just finished
 downloading your data.

486
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,233
- [Dr. Krackle] What data, Olaf?

487
00:25:58,233 --> 00:26:00,433
- The formula for the
 growth alteration secret.

488
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,933
- [Dr. Krackle] No!

489
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:05,500
No one must interfere with my
 plans for world domination!

490
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:09,533
If one miserable miscreant
 were to use the formula

491
00:26:09,533 --> 00:26:11,867
and do so in the public
eye, it would destroy

492
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:13,833
everything I have built.

493
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,667
- Sorry, Dr. Krackle.

494
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:16,933
- [Dr. Krackle] And
 what has been done

495
00:26:16,933 --> 00:26:19,067
to remedy this situation?

496
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:21,900
- The intruder left
 too quickly for us

497
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
to be able to wipe
 out their system.

498
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,267
However, we were able to trace

499
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:27,733
the incoming connection
to its source.

500
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:28,733
- [Dr. Krackle] Excellent.

501
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,067
Olaf, prepare my van.

502
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:32,400
We must leave at once.

503
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,667
And as for you, Mr. Bionic.

504
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:37,233
- Yes, Doctor?

505
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,267
- [Dr. Krackle] I
 want you to make sure

506
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,633
there are no
 survivors this time.

507
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:45,400
Anyone who knows about the
 growth alteration formula

508
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,933
and my plans to take over
 the world must be eliminated.

509
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:53,333
(sinister laughing)

510
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:56,567
(menacing organ music)

511
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:04,800
- Umm, where did that
 lightning come from?

512
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,300
- I don't know, man.

513
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,767
But it kind of fits,
 don't you think?

514
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:09,833
- Yeah, sure.

515
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,100
- Let's go!

516
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,367
Chop chop, time's a wastin'.

517
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,533
- Well, either we're
 gonna end up making

518
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,067
a top secret growth formula--

519
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:21,933
- Or a tasty side dish.

("Funky Fu Manchu"

521
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,833

 sunglasses under my nose

527
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:53,433
* And if I touch people
 laughin', that's how it goes

528
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:55,800
* So don't even
 think about askin' me

529
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,733
* To cut my funky Fu Manchu

530
00:27:58,733 --> 00:28:01,133
* My funky Fu Manchu

531
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,300
* Baby that's what I brew

532
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,433
* Goin' down my jaw, down my jaw

533
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:11,333
* Funky Fu Manchu and
 what it makes me do

534
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:15,900
* Let's go and break
 the law, break the law

535
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,400
* Yeah

536
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,867
(zapping)
 (rumbling)

537
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,267
- It's an earthquake?!

538
00:28:40,267 --> 00:28:42,900
- No, it's coming
 from the microwave.

539
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,200
- Well, pull the plug!

540
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,567
- Nuh uh, forget it.

541
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:46,900
It's gonna blow!

542
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,200
- Hey, Evel Knievel,

543
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,233
be careful, okay?

544
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,667
(sniffing)

545
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:45,100
- It doesn't smell or anything.

546
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,767
- Is it supposed to?

547
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:00,067
- It almost looks like water.

548
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:01,233
- Water?

549
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,600
- Yeah.

550
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,433
Maybe it went
 through so much stuff

551
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:07,500
and there were so many
 ingredients involved,

552
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,600
we wound up makin' water.

553
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,733
Wouldn't that be funny?

554
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,467
- If we just went through
 all that rigmarole,

555
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:18,300
not to mention my $50 of
 hard-earned allowance money,

556
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,700
to make freakin' water,
you can pretty much bet

557
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,500
the last thing I'm feelin'
 right now is funny.

558
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,633
Why don't you taste it?

559
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:30,867
I mean, if it tastes like
water, we'll go back to Molly's

560
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:33,300
and we'll set her
 phaser to law suit.

561
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,600
- You're not supposed
to put it in your mouth.

562
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,900
The instructions say that
 you have to spray it on.

563
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,733
- Hmm.

564
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:40,567
Spray it on.

565
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,967
Josh, you ready yet?

566
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:06,800
Dude, I'm not even gonna ask.

567
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,333
- I didn't wanna bust
 out of my old clothes

568
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,833
when the formula took effect,

569
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,767
so I borrowed some
 of my dad's stuff.

570
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,667
- Well, I hope for
 your sake you do grow

571
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:16,267
because that just looks stupid.

572
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:21,067
And what's with the sub?

573
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:23,500
- I was gonna give
 it to Courtney.

574
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,700
- Your gonna give
 her our model sub?

575
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,933
- Well, it means a lot
to me, and she liked it.

576
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,933
So I figured, you know,
she'd appreciate it,

577
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,133
sort of like a present.

578
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,867
- What happened to
 some candy and roses?

579
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,633
- This is better
 than candy and roses.

580
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:37,833
- Yeah but that happens to be

581
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,733
our senior science
 project, Josh.

582
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:41,233
You remember the grade thing?

583
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,067
The A plus we're gonna need
 to get into a decent college?

584
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:46,200
- Well, it's my model
 sub, I built it.

585
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,833
- Yeah, but have you thought
 of what we're gonna do

586
00:31:47,833 --> 00:31:50,267
instead of the model sub
for a science project?

587
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:52,400
- Will you just back
 me up on this, please?

588
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,267
I'll cross that bridge
 when I come to it.

589
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:55,967
Hey, I'd help you
 out if it was you

590
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:57,433
that was trying to
 get a girlfriend

591
00:31:57,433 --> 00:32:01,400
with a top secret growth formula
and an HO scale model sub.

592
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,233
- I'll settle if you
 let me borrow the car.

593
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:05,300
Okay, fine, give her the sub.

594
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,467
Let's just get this goop and
 spray it on you , alright?

595
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:15,333
Are you sure you don't want to

596
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,900
try this out on something first

597
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,967
like a dog or a small
 squirrel or somethin'?

598
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:20,967
- We don't have any time, Rudy.

599
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:23,533
The party starts in 10 minutes.

600
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:43,300
- Well?

601
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,167
Am I taller?

602
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,533
- Do you feel any taller?

603
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,367
- Actually, it feels
 just sort of damp.

604
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:52,933
- You wanna know why, Josh?

605
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:55,567
You wanna know why you
just feel sort of damp?

606
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:57,133
It's water, Josh.

607
00:32:57,133 --> 00:33:00,267
We just stumbled over the
 secret formula for water.

608
00:33:00,267 --> 00:33:02,767
We're idiots, we've
 been ripped off,

609
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:06,433
and I'm gonna wring crazy
 Molly Ethersol's little neck!

610
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,300
- Well, maybe it takes a
few minutes to kick in.

611
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,667
- And maybe I'm
 the Easter Bunny!

612
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:12,067
Wake up and smell the
 gullibility, would ya?

613
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:14,500
This is all crazy
 Molly settin' us up!

614
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,933
We'd probably have
 a better chance

615
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:17,967
of flying my Chevy Nova to Mars

616
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:20,733
than mixing up a batch
of this secret formula!

617
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,167
Now, let's go to the party, man.

618
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,533
I gotta get out of
 here before I lose

619
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:26,067
the rest of my dignity.

620
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:26,900
- Wait up!

621
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,833
Well, am I taller?

622
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:36,233
- Nope.

623
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:38,333
Still look like a
 plain old moron.

624
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,167
- Hey!

625
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,267
- Face it, Josh, the
 formula didn't work.

626
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:47,500
You may have to go in there
 and be yourself to get by.

627
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,133
Heck, you may have
 to even use your wit

628
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:53,533
and personality to
 win over old Courtney.

629
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,367
I know that's a
 kooky concept, but...

630
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,367
- Well, I still
 think it might work.

631
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:11,067
- Are you absolutely
 sure you want to do this?

632
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,067
- I'm not gonna back out.

633
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:18,967
And anyways, I have
 faith in you, Rudy.

634
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:21,967
I mean, I know
 you're a real friend,

635
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,600
and that you wouldn't
 have helped me out

636
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,367
unless you thought that
 it might've really worked.

637
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,467
- Thanks, man.

638
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:40,833
So could you at least roll
 up your sleeves or somethin'?

639
00:34:53,267 --> 00:34:54,200
- Hey.

640
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,567
- Five bucks a head, dorkus.

641
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:56,500
Cough it up.

642
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,067
- Why do we have to pay?

643
00:34:58,067 --> 00:34:59,567
I thought Courtney Wilson
 was having a party here.

644
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:00,567
- Yeah?

645
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:02,300
Well, Blake decided to charge.

646
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,800
Pay, or you don't get to play.

647
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:23,067
- Well well, look what
the cat forgot to bury.

648
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:24,667
- Biff, Spike.

649
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:25,967
Can it, buttmunch.

650
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:27,200
What do you two little nobodies

651
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,700
think you're doin' here anyway?

652
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,200
- Courtney invited us.

653
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,900
- Courtney isn't in charge of
 the party guests, Blake is.

654
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,900
- Ain't that shame.

655
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,533
Besides, this party's
 for seniors, Campbell,

656
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:39,167
not for midgets.

657
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:40,400
- Come on, guys.

658
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,200
I mean, we're paying
 money to get in here,

659
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,067
you're making money off of us.

660
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:46,900
I mean, our money is as green
 as anybody else's, isn't it?

661
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,433
- Alright, I'll let you
 two little nose miners in.

662
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:51,500
20 bucks.

663
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,067
- 20 bucks!?

664
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,600
- Each.

665
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,900
- And I'm charging 30 for Josh

666
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,567
because of the
 high chair rental.

667
00:35:57,567 --> 00:35:59,767
- (laughs) High chair rental?

668
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:00,900
- Time to go home.

669
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,533
- Wait, come on, Rudy.

670
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:03,933
We gotta do this.

671
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,567
- You owe me.

672
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:09,400
I mean it.

673
00:36:13,233 --> 00:36:14,067
Let's go.

674
00:36:26,933 --> 00:36:29,267
- Have a great time, Stumpy.

675
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,967
(energetic pop punk music)

676
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,067
- You know, with the hundred
 bucks I blew on you tonight,

677
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:33,867
you better at least
 ask her to marry you.

678
00:37:33,867 --> 00:37:34,700
At least.

679
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,800
- I should go for it, huh?

680
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,900
- Rock & roll, young man.

681
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,067
- Hi Josh.

682
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:45,500
- Hi.

683
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,867
- I'm really glad you
 could make it to the party.

684
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,300
- Yeah, it sure is big.

685
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,300
- I need it.

686
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:54,800
- What?

687
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,700
- Look, I know this isn't gonna
make a whole lot of sense,

688
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,867
but did you ever set something

689
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:01,300
into motion that
 you couldn't stop?

690
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,200
I mean, something really big,

691
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,433
something you thought was
 a good idea at the time

692
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:09,233
only it just turned
 out to be rotten.

693
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:11,900
- Does this have anything
 to do with Blake?

694
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,633
- Look around, this whole
 thing has to do with Blake.

695
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:19,133
He just turned my tiny little
 get-together into Studio 54.

696
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:21,467
- You didn't want the party?

697
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,467
- Being popular isn't as easy
 as it looks, you know, Josh.

698
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:28,233
Sometimes I like
to just hang out

699
00:38:28,233 --> 00:38:30,933
with a couple friends and talk.

700
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:31,767
- Me too.

701
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,933
- What are you
 hiding back there?

702
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:36,500
- Umm...

703
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,700
It's a surprise.

704
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,867
- For me?

705
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:40,300
- Yeah, I was
 thinking, you know,

706
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,400
maybe we could go for a walk.
 (shattering)

707
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,767
- Hold that thought, Josh.

708
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:45,900
Because I do want
 to talk to you.

709
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,733
Right now, I have to
go make sure some idiot

710
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:51,900
doesn't make me lose the
 deposit I paid for the club.

711
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:05,067
- What's up?

712
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,833
- There's Blake.

713
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:09,867
- Yeah, and it doesn't
 look like Courtney

714
00:39:09,867 --> 00:39:12,733
he's smoochin' on either.

715
00:39:12,733 --> 00:39:13,567
Josh!

716
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:19,433
- Looks like somebody
 woke up the baby.

717
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:21,100
- I don't care what you
say about me, jockstrap,

718
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,100
because I'm used to it.

719
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,333
But you don't deserve her.

720
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,400
- Who? Courtney?

721
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,233
- Yeah.

722
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:26,167
- What?

723
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:28,900
You got a thing for my girl?

724
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:33,167
If you were only two feet
taller, I'd almost be concerned.

725
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:36,100
Here's the 411, pewee: A chick
 like Courtney's never gonna

726
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,567
go out with a freaky
 little GoBot like you.

727
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:41,400
You know it's true,
 I know it's true.

728
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,567
Face it, dwarf, you're nothing
 but a short, little nothing.

729
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,200
Here's a little something
 to cool you off.

730
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,400
- I'm gonna kill him, Rudy.

731
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,867
- Calm down.

732
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:07,467
I think the fighting's
 all done with for tonight.

733
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:09,033
Get washed up and
 then we'll split.

734
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:09,867
- But...

735
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,400
- I said we'll split.

736
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,233
The end.

737
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,400
Do you got me?

738
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,833
- No!

739
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:32,067
I'll never rule the
 universe with you.

740
00:40:32,067 --> 00:40:33,867
Stupid game.

741
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:35,367
(loud bang)

742
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:36,533
Two more times.

743
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:37,867
(loud bang)

744
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:38,867
One more.

745
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:41,200
(loud bang)

746
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,833
(menacing organ music)

747
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,433
- Hello there, little girl.

748
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,933
- What do you ER rejects want?

749
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:11,500
- Do all of these wonderful
 toys belong to you?

750
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,600
- They're not toys, okay?

751
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,233
- We would like to have a
 talk with you, little girl.

752
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:20,633
If you'd like, we can
 discuss flowers or bumblebees

753
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:23,500
or perhaps your favorite
 young person's musical group,

754
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,067
or even the restricted
 internet site

755
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:27,633
you've broken into with
your infernal computer!

756
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:29,500
- Who, who are you?

757
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,933
- My manners, forgive me.

758
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:34,833
I am the one they
 call Dr. Krackle.

759
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:39,300
(evil laughing)

760
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,567
- Oh boy.

761
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:42,600
- And now the time for
 pleasantries is over.

762
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,267
I have a great many
 things to ask you

763
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:46,967
and you will answer, oh yes.

764
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:50,933
Mr. Bionic, please introduce
 our young friend here

765
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:55,100
to the wonderful world of
 interrogation (laughs).

766
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:58,900
(molly screams)

767
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,067
- Why couldn't you
 just grow, huh?

768
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:53,833
It's working.

769
00:43:18,233 --> 00:43:20,500
It's working, it's working.

770
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,533
- Josh, what's
 goin' on in there!?

771
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:34,067
- It's working.

772
00:43:46,933 --> 00:43:48,100
- [Rudy] Josh!

773
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,767
- How long is that
 guy gonna be in there?

774
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:53,433
I really have to go.

775
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:21,333
- What the...

776
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:31,533
The growth formula must've
 made the sub grow but

777
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,633
where am I?

778
00:44:37,933 --> 00:44:40,100
(screams)

779
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:15,633
This is way too bizarre.

780
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,967
There's gotta be some sort
 of scientific explanation.

781
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:24,133
Let's see, the formula
 worked on the sub,

782
00:45:24,133 --> 00:45:27,267
and while the ant was
 probably on the sub,

783
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:30,333
so it works on living organisms.

784
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,767
But why didn't it work on me?

785
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,567
Wait a minute.

786
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:40,300
The ant was nowhere
 near the sub.

787
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:42,933
Oh, don't tell me.

788
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:47,500
I shrunk.

789
00:45:57,767 --> 00:45:58,600
- Josh!

790
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:09,067
What'd you do, crawl
 out a window or what?

791
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:12,100
(cell phone ringing)

792
00:46:16,867 --> 00:46:17,700
Hello.

793
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,300
- [Josh] Rudy? It's me.

794
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,200
- Josh?

795
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,867
- [Josh] Yeah, Josh.

796
00:46:21,867 --> 00:46:24,967
You're not even gonna
 believe this one.

797
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:27,067
- I can't hear you.

798
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,667
You gotta speak up, man.

799
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:30,633
You sound like you're
 a million miles away.

800
00:46:30,633 --> 00:46:33,200
- Yeah, I might as well be.

801
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,300
- [Rudy] Well, you
 pulled a real nice

802
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,200
disappearing act in here.

803
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,900
Where are you and
 what's happened, man?

804
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,067
(screams)

805
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,533
Geez, what was that, Josh?

806
00:46:45,533 --> 00:46:46,967
- Just don't move, okay?

807
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:48,167
Stand perfectly still.

808
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:50,167
Don't even breathe
 if you don't have to.

809
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:52,600
- Alright man, I'm
 standing perfectly still,

810
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,767
but you gotta tell me
 what's happening here.

811
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:56,600
- You're standing
 right next to me.

812
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,467
- Where right next to you?

813
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:00,267
I can't see anything.

814
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:03,800
What are you, like
 invisible now or something?

815
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,533
- Well, let's just say that

816
00:47:05,533 --> 00:47:08,467
the growth alteration
 formula finally kicked in.

817
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:10,100
- [Rudy] Are you serious?

818
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,833
- Yeah, but it
 worked in reverse.

819
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:16,233
I'm smaller than I was before.

820
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,433
- Oh man.

821
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:22,333
How small, like
 little bug small?

822
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,400
- Like dust mite small.

823
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,300
And the sub, it must've
 gotten some of the formula

824
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,333
sprayed on it too because
 I'm sitting in it right now.

825
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,733
- Boy, this is way too much.

826
00:47:33,733 --> 00:47:35,233
- You're tellin' me.

827
00:47:35,233 --> 00:47:37,767
What are we gonna do, Rudy?

828
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:40,833
- Well, we need to get
 you out of this party

829
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:42,900
and take you to somebody
who can help you out.

830
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,200
- But how?

831
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,500
- I've got a contact lens case.

832
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,100
I'll just scoop you up in this,

833
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,667
and then we'll split the party.

834
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:06,967
Hey Josh, could you
 wave or something?

835
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,533
- I don't think you could
 see me without a microscope,

836
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:11,600
so I'm gonna have to
 talk you through it.

837
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,067
Okay, try looking to your left.

838
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:16,500
Ugh!

839
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,100
- What's wrong?

840
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,333
- Well, the good part is
 you're lookin' right at me,

841
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,733
but your face...

842
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:23,200
- There's nothin'
 wrong with my face.

843
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,567
- Trust me, it's pretty
 scary from where I'm sitting.

844
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:28,467
- Well, I still can't see you.

845
00:48:28,467 --> 00:48:29,900
- Just scoop directly
 where you're looking

846
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,333
and you should catch the sub.

847
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,533
That's it.

848
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:38,133
Easy.

849
00:48:38,133 --> 00:48:38,967
Whoa!

850
00:48:40,467 --> 00:48:41,933
- Josh?

851
00:48:41,933 --> 00:48:43,067
Did I get ya?

852
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:44,933
- Yeah, it looks like it.

853
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:47,167
Rudy, I'm not diggin' this.

854
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:48,400
- Just hold tight, man.

855
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,633
I'm gonna get you out of here

856
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:51,467
and I'm gonna get
 away from the party.

857
00:48:51,467 --> 00:48:54,067
- [Josh] Good, because
 this is like humiliating.

858
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:55,467
- Don't worry, man.

859
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:56,933
We're gonna get you
 back to normal size.

860
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,767
Just you wait and see.

861
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,100
It's my pet fly,
 he's losing weight.

862
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:12,567
- Remove the hood.

863
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:22,300
Did you enjoy your quiet
time in the darkness?

864
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,300
- It sure beat having
 to look at you.

865
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,200
- I admire your
 spirit, little girl,

866
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,867
but I think now it's time
 to break that spirit.

867
00:49:28,867 --> 00:49:31,067
- What are you gonna
 do to me, Dr. Spackle?

868
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:32,633
- That's "Krackle" with a K!

869
00:49:32,633 --> 00:49:34,467
- I don't care!

870
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:35,967
- You will care, little girl.

871
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:37,833
You will tell me
 who has my formula

872
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:40,133
and where they are
 located or I will have to

873
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:42,800
resort to more drastic measures.

874
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:46,300
- Go ahead and torture
 me, you twisted freak!

875
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,200
I'm still not gonna tell
 you what you want to know.

876
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,200
I like pain.

877
00:49:50,367 --> 00:49:51,867
- I have ways of
 making people talk

878
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:55,300
that'll make you wish I
 had tortured you instead.

879
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,633
- Take your best
 shot, Dr. Kracker.

880
00:49:57,633 --> 00:49:59,133
- That's Krackle!!

881
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:02,533
And if you insist,
 it just so happens

882
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:04,067
that I have recently videotaped

883
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,300
a six hour One Day
 at a Time marathon

884
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,100
and I've brought along
a tape so that you and I

885
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,567
may enjoy all six
 hours of it together.

886
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:14,200
- One Day at a Time!?

887
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,367
- I can see you're a big fan

888
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:18,100
of that spunky redhead
 Bonnie Franklin.

889
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,867
And that Schneider,
what a cut up (laughs).

890
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:22,333
- You wouldn't dare!

891
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,867
- And if that doesn't
 loosen your tongue,

892
00:50:23,867 --> 00:50:27,267
then perhaps afterwards we
 can enjoy hours and hours

893
00:50:27,267 --> 00:50:30,200
of my favorite
 episodes of Blossom!

894
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:32,533
- No!

895
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:34,033
- Then you will tell
me everything you know?

896
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:35,767
- Okay, okay!

897
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,767
This guy Rudy paid
 me 50 bucks to find

898
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:40,800
a super growth formula for
 a kid named Josh Campbell!

899
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,067
- Growth formula, but--

900
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:43,367
- He's short, okay?

901
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:45,467
He wanted to go to
this party at Water Den

902
00:50:45,467 --> 00:50:47,000
and impress Courtney
 Wilson by being

903
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,633
normal sized or whatever, so
 I cracked into your system

904
00:50:49,633 --> 00:50:52,033
and downloaded
 your stupid stuff.

905
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:53,700
- Are you getting
 the sound, Olaf?

906
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,333
- Yeah, I'm running short here.

907
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:58,467
- Nevermind that, just
write it down you idiot!

908
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:01,467
So this schoolmate of
 yours, Josh Campbell,

909
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:03,500
he made the formula
 and used it on himself

910
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:06,067
thinking he would
 make himself taller?

911
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:08,433
- Yeah, I didn't even
 think it would work.

912
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:09,933
(laughing)

913
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,533
- Well, never fear.

914
00:51:12,733 --> 00:51:14,900
Soon enough, everyone
 in the world will know

915
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,700
how well my growth
alteration formula works

916
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,900
when I make every
 man, woman, and child

917
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,400
the size of a cold
 germ (laughs).

918
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,800
The whole world will
 bow down before me!

919
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,233
- You wouldn't dare!

920
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:30,700
- Wouldn't I?

921
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:34,300
Right now you will give me
 the address of this Water Den.

922
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,300
- I already told you enough!

923
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,767
- No? Hmm.

924
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:40,267
Then I know a certain
 young lady that will enjoy

925
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:44,433
hours and hours of old
 reruns of B.J. and the Bear.

926
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:46,400
- No! No!

927
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,833
- [Josh] Are we out
 of the club yet?

928
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,067
- Not yet, man.

929
00:51:58,067 --> 00:51:59,467
We're right on the dancefloor.

930
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:01,067
- You think you
 could hold it steady?

931
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:02,500
I'm starting to get sea sick.

932
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,300
- I'm doing the best I can
 with the tools I got, okay?

933
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,867
- [Josh] Just don't drop me.

934
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:07,700
- Hi Rudy.

935
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:10,500
Is that a cell phone?

936
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,267
- Oohh, I like a man who makes

937
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:15,067
important phone calls
 on his cell phone.

938
00:52:15,067 --> 00:52:16,633
- Maybe he's talking
 to a record producer.

939
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,633
(laughing)

940
00:52:18,633 --> 00:52:22,267
- Wow, the cell phone
 actually worked.

941
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:23,100
- Huh?

942
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:25,600
They both work.

943
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,667
How do you think we're
 having this conversation?

944
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:31,500
What's going on, Rudy?

945
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,067
- Something came
 up, Mr. Campbell.

946
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:36,133
I'm gonna have to
 get back to you

947
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:39,200
on those recording contracts.

948
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,700
- Hello, remember me?

949
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,233
Your best friend, the guy
 with some serious size issues.

950
00:52:45,233 --> 00:52:46,667
- Dude, they're girls.

951
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,667
I mean, you know, girls.

952
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,367
- Yeah, I know.

953
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,267
Rudy!

954
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,567
Rudy, what's the deal out there?

955
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:13,867
I think I just spiked the punch.

956
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:15,667
- What if Courtney sees us talk?

957
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:17,333
- Well, when I'm finished
 countin' up the profits

958
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:21,167
from this shindig,
 Courtney's gonna be history.

959
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:22,067
- Rudy?

960
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:26,067
- Do you like football?

961
00:53:26,067 --> 00:53:26,833
- Eww!

962
00:53:28,067 --> 00:53:29,900
- What is this garbage?

963
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,833
- Oh, sorry about that, man.

964
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:35,233
- Go on back to your little
 munchkin buddy, dork.

965
00:53:35,233 --> 00:53:36,900
- No problem, Blake.

966
00:53:54,933 --> 00:53:56,367
- Now where am I?

967
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:04,067
No way.

968
00:54:04,067 --> 00:54:05,633
Teeth?

969
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:08,400
- Josh, are you
 still there, man?

970
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:12,967
I have some severe
 bad news for you.

971
00:54:12,967 --> 00:54:16,467
- I suppose your gonna tell
 me I'm in somebody's mouth.

972
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:18,700
- You are inside
 somebody's mouth.

973
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,067
- [Josh] Who is it?

974
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:21,133
Is it somebody I know?

975
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,467
- Does it matter?

976
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,633
- [Josh] Yeah, I want
 to know whose tongue

977
00:54:23,633 --> 00:54:25,933
I'm rubbing up against.

978
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:27,867
- [Rudy] It's Blake.

979
00:54:27,867 --> 00:54:29,067
- Oh that's...

980
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:32,067
That's disgusting.

981
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:33,433
- Well, maybe you
 could fly or something

982
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:35,100
when he opens his mouth.

983
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,300
- In a sub?

984
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,167
I think that's a
 major improbability.

985
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:40,100
- Hey, don't yell at me, man.

986
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:44,267
This is my first time dealing
 with this miniature stuff.

987
00:54:45,633 --> 00:54:47,900
Did you ever see that
 movie, The Fantastic Voyage,

988
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,500
where those guys
 shrink down real small

989
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,233
and they get injected
 into some bozo?

990
00:54:52,233 --> 00:54:54,167
How'd they get out of that
 at the end of the picture?

991
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,800
- They went out
 through the tear duct,

992
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,700
but I have no idea on how
 to get there from here.

993
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,833
With my luck, I'd end up
in his small intestine.

994
00:55:01,833 --> 00:55:04,067
- Maybe make him
cough or sneeze.

995
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,833
Then he'll cough you right out

996
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:08,267
and I can just go wherever
 he coughs or sneezes onto.

997
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:10,133
- Well, that's a
 well-engineered plan.

998
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:12,633
- [Rudy] You got a better one?

999
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:16,367
- Let me see what I can do.

1000
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:33,133
I think I'm in his sinus cavity.

1001
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:34,367
There's some stringy stuff

1002
00:55:34,367 --> 00:55:36,200
but other than that
 there's not much here.

1003
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,267
Maybe it's his brain.

1004
00:55:38,267 --> 00:55:39,933
- Try and make him sneeze.

1005
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:41,333
- [Josh] How do I do that?

1006
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,667
- Well, bump into something.

1007
00:55:46,933 --> 00:55:48,767
- Bump into something.

1008
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,200
- You know what your
problem is, Blake honey?

1009
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,400
You're way too good looking
 for that mess Courtney.

1010
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,833
- What?

1011
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:08,333
Now I can treat you a
 whole lot better, handsome.

1012
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,400
What's wrong?

1013
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,100
Oh my God, your face.

1014
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:21,100
- Well, let's see what's
behind door number two.

1015
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:25,800
- What's happening to me?

1016
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:36,367
- Oh my God, it's like
 elephantitis or something.

1017
00:56:38,233 --> 00:56:41,067
- Whatever you're doin', man,
 it's not makin' him cough.

1018
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:42,633
- Well, what is
 happening out there?

1019
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,367
Am I doing anything?

1020
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,933
- You can say that.

1021
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,067
- This is some funky stuff.

1022
00:57:31,067 --> 00:57:33,233
(mumbles)

1023
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,733
- It's tight.

1024
00:57:43,733 --> 00:57:45,900
(mumbles)

1025
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:57,233
- Come on, champ, we'll
get you to the restroom.

1026
00:57:57,233 --> 00:57:59,767
- I have elephantitis.

1027
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:00,633
- I know, man.

1028
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:01,800
It's a bummer.

1029
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,067
- Oh man, I'm dying
 of elephantitis.

1030
00:58:15,067 --> 00:58:16,500
Somebody call 911!

1031
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:22,367
- [Rudy] Josh, are you okay?

1032
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:24,567
Josh.

1033
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,567
- Yeah I'm here.

1034
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:30,067
- [Rudy] Well, the bad
 news keeps on coming.

1035
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:33,767
Guess where Blake wound
up coughing you into?

1036
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,800
- The aquarium?

1037
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,767
Rudy, how am I gonna
 get out of here?

1038
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:41,900
- I haven't figured
 that out yet.

1039
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,800
I'm gonna try and call Molly
 and see if she can find

1040
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,433
an antidote for this
 stuff on the internet.

1041
00:58:47,433 --> 00:58:50,300
- My future's in the hands
 of pippilongstocking.com.

1042
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,300
- Well, we have to try, okay?

1043
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,533
Just sit tight
 and don't get into

1044
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:56,300
any trouble until
 I call you back.

1045
00:58:59,633 --> 00:59:03,267
- [Josh] I hope she
 has a fast browser.

1046
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:05,433
(screams)

1047
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:09,533
- Man, looks like we
have a fortune in this.

1048
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:10,733
- We're rich.

1049
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:12,900
(beeping)

1050
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,500
- [Biff] What do
those guys want?

1051
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:31,267
- Hey, what are you two
clowns supposed to be?

1052
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,067
- We're the cable repair guys.

1053
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:34,767
- Yeah, right.

1054
00:59:34,767 --> 00:59:38,233
- What's wrong, don't we
 look like cable repair guys?

1055
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:40,067
- Five bucks a piece, dudes.

1056
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:41,267
Or you can go back to whatever

1057
00:59:41,267 --> 00:59:43,700
costume party you
 crawled out of.

1058
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:54,167
- Hey, I'm uhh, just gonna go
 pick up my friend (mumbles).

1059
01:00:00,067 --> 01:00:03,167
(upbeat latin music)

1060
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,600
- We have to find any trace

1061
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,867
of the growth
 alteration formula's

1062
01:00:10,867 --> 01:00:13,100
unique radiation signature.

1063
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,733
(beeping)

1064
01:00:34,467 --> 01:00:37,133
(phone ringing)

1065
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,933
- Uhh, hello.

1066
01:00:50,933 --> 01:00:53,033
- Molly, I'm glad I caught you.

1067
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:55,167
We've got some major
 league problems.

1068
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,467
- Ya think?

1069
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:58,233
- Yeah, that stuff you
 found on the internet

1070
01:00:58,233 --> 01:01:00,500
shrunk Josh down to
 microscopic size,

1071
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:03,333
and now he's stuck
 in an aquarium.

1072
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:04,833
- Well, it gets worse for you.

1073
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:07,400
The guys that own the formula
 traced the download to me.

1074
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,800
They just stopped by and made
 me watch Joanie Loves Chachi

1075
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,533
until I told them
 where you two were.

1076
01:01:11,533 --> 01:01:14,100
I mean, these guys are bad news.

1077
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,333
They're gonna use this stuff
 to take over the world.

1078
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:17,767
- What do they look like?

1079
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:21,200
- Black vinyl
jumpsuits, black gloves.

1080
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,533
They look like the cast
of Horror Hospital.

1081
01:01:24,533 --> 01:01:27,233
- That's what I thought.

1082
01:01:27,233 --> 01:01:28,900
Well, they just showed
 up at Courtney's party

1083
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,333
and they just found Josh.

1084
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:31,600
I've gotta stop them.

1085
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,100
- Hold on, Rudy, you're
gonna need some back up.

1086
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,567
I'm on my way, as soon as I
 get untied from the chair.

1087
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:40,167
- Uhh, I won't even
 ask about that.

1088
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:43,067
- Just stay put
 until I get there.

1089
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,467
- Doctor, we found
 the miniature boy.

1090
01:01:49,467 --> 01:01:51,500
He's in a fish tank.

1091
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,700
- Excellent.

1092
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,133
Come and get me.

1093
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:58,067
I'll go and retrieve him
myself in the deadpod (laughs).

1094
01:01:58,067 --> 01:01:59,167
- Yes, Doctor.

1095
01:02:04,233 --> 01:02:05,500
- Who are you?

1096
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,300
You weren't invited
 to this party.

1097
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,233
- We're the cable repair guys.

1098
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:13,300
- No, see, what you are is
 a couple of trespassers.

1099
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,433
This is an under 21 club.

1100
01:02:15,433 --> 01:02:17,533
If you guys don't leave,
I'm gonna call the cops.

1101
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:20,933
My party's already too
out of control as it is.

1102
01:02:20,933 --> 01:02:23,600
- Your party, you say?

1103
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,600
You are Courtney Wilson?

1104
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,533
- Yes, I am.

1105
01:02:28,533 --> 01:02:30,067
- Then you must come with us.

1106
01:02:30,067 --> 01:02:33,233
The doctor would like
 to see you very much.

1107
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:34,300
- Doctor?

1108
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,733
- Yes, the doctor.

1109
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:37,400
Pleas step this way.

1110
01:02:40,433 --> 01:02:41,267
- Oh boy.

1111
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,633
- Hello there, little girl.

1112
01:03:00,633 --> 01:03:04,600
You must be this Courtney
Wilson I've heard so much about.

1113
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,333
Well, you must be quite a person

1114
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:08,067
for your friend Josh
 Campbell to have gone

1115
01:03:08,067 --> 01:03:10,067
through so much trouble.

1116
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:10,967
- I don't understand.

1117
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:12,267
What do you guys want?

1118
01:03:12,267 --> 01:03:13,867
What does this have
 to do with Josh?

1119
01:03:13,867 --> 01:03:14,700
- Silence!

1120
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,500
The time for talking is over.

1121
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,567
I must retrieve Josh
 Campbell, and you,

1122
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:25,067
my new little friend,
 will be the bait.

1123
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:26,967
Into the deadpod!

1124
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:29,633
(evil laughing)

1125
01:03:33,867 --> 01:03:37,200
- Where are you taking
 me in this thing?

1126
01:03:42,867 --> 01:03:47,067
- Come on, guys, I promise I'll
never eat fishsticks again.

1127
01:03:59,367 --> 01:04:00,267
Come on.

1128
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:04,667
Come on.

1129
01:04:11,967 --> 01:04:13,800
That was beyond close.

1130
01:04:38,267 --> 01:04:40,633
- I hope you like
 germs, little girl,

1131
01:04:40,633 --> 01:04:45,467
because you're about to become
 the size of one (laughs).

1132
01:04:45,467 --> 01:04:47,200
Activating pod cover.

1133
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,867
(phone ringing)

1134
01:04:56,867 --> 01:04:58,067
- Rudy?

1135
01:04:58,067 --> 01:04:59,067
- How are, Josh?

1136
01:04:59,067 --> 01:05:00,167
Are you hanging in there?

1137
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:01,367
- I just barely got away

1138
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:03,367
from a school of
 man-eating goldfish.

1139
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:04,867
Now I'm in some kind of pipe.

1140
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,767
- But other than
 that, you're okay?

1141
01:05:06,767 --> 01:05:08,500
- [Josh] I'm okay.

1142
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,433
- Listen, I'm waiting
 for Molly to show up.

1143
01:05:10,433 --> 01:05:12,567
We got all kinds of problems.

1144
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:14,667
There's a bunch of
 bad characters here,

1145
01:05:14,667 --> 01:05:17,433
and they're the ones
 who own the formula.

1146
01:05:17,433 --> 01:05:18,567
They have Courtney.

1147
01:05:18,567 --> 01:05:19,767
- What?

1148
01:05:19,767 --> 01:05:21,533
- Just hold tight
 until Molly gets here.

1149
01:05:21,533 --> 01:05:23,833
We're gonna figure a way
 to get you back to normal

1150
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:26,867
and save Courtney before
things get any worse.

1151
01:05:26,867 --> 01:05:29,767
- No, things have
gotten way out of hand.

1152
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:31,100
You better call the police.

1153
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,833
- That's fine, but they
might not come here

1154
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,867
if I mention the part
 about how my best bud

1155
01:05:34,867 --> 01:05:37,067
got shrunk down to
 the size of a plankton

1156
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:39,800
and how you're tooling
around in your toy sub.

1157
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,567
- Could you just try?

1158
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,633
Oh no.

1159
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:45,767
- What now?

1160
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:47,400
A giant crab?

1161
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,200
- My oxygen gauge.

1162
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,767
It says I only have
 10 minutes left.

1163
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:54,167
If you guys have a plan, you
 better get working on it.

1164
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:57,667
I'm gonna try and get
 back to the surface.

1165
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:13,067
- Administer the growth
alteration formula now!

1166
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:15,167
(laughs)

1167
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:32,433
(laughing)

1168
01:07:48,633 --> 01:07:50,067
- What are you guys doing?

1169
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:51,733
- Pay no attention to us.

1170
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:54,333
- We're the cable repair guys.

1171
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,800
- Dudes, I hate to
 break this to ya,

1172
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,800
but I think you two
 just screwed up.

1173
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,533
This doesn't look like
 a TV set to me at all.

1174
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,667
- Courtney.

1175
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:34,433
- Josh, no, no, Josh!

1176
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:38,067
(lasers firing)

1177
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:41,767
- Oh man, this is not happening.

1178
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:43,667
(evil laughing)

1179
01:08:43,667 --> 01:08:44,900
- Leave him alone.

1180
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,633
He didn't even do
 anything to you,

1181
01:08:46,633 --> 01:08:48,500
Dr. Whatever Your Name Is.

1182
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,467
- It's Krackle, young lady,
 and there's nothing you can do

1183
01:08:50,467 --> 01:08:52,600
to save your friend
 now (laughs).

1184
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,433
- Looks like I won't have to.

1185
01:08:54,433 --> 01:08:56,067
He's getting away.

1186
01:08:56,067 --> 01:08:58,467
- He won't stray too
 far, now that he's caught

1187
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,233
a glimpse of my little co-pilot.

1188
01:09:01,233 --> 01:09:02,067
- Go Josh!

1189
01:09:13,433 --> 01:09:14,833
- We must prepare the antidote

1190
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:17,800
for when the doctor
 retrieves the miniature boy.

1191
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,633
- Yes.

1192
01:09:28,867 --> 01:09:30,767
- There is an antidote.

1193
01:09:35,733 --> 01:09:37,700
- Smooth move, exlax.

1194
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,233
You want to get us caught?

1195
01:09:40,233 --> 01:09:41,600
- Where were you?!

1196
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,300
- I told you I was
 tied to a chair

1197
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:46,700
and had to use tai
 chi to get my way out.

1198
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,133
Anyway, I thought I
 also just told you

1199
01:09:49,133 --> 01:09:52,267
to stay put until I showed up.

1200
01:09:52,267 --> 01:09:53,500
- Well, that was
 a real swell plan

1201
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,100
except Josh only has
 10 minutes of air left

1202
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,500
in his model sub,
 and now there's

1203
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:59,067
some doctor lady after him.

1204
01:09:59,067 --> 01:10:02,533
And they were just talking
 about some antidote.

1205
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:06,700
- Well, step one, we have to
 get rid of those two losers.

1206
01:10:11,033 --> 01:10:14,233
- Uhh, gee, I seem to have left

1207
01:10:14,233 --> 01:10:17,067
my black belt at home tonight.

1208
01:10:17,067 --> 01:10:18,733
- I'm serious, Rudy!

1209
01:10:20,067 --> 01:10:21,767
Despite your fifth grade
sarcasm, there's a very easy way

1210
01:10:21,767 --> 01:10:24,767
we can take them
 out of the program.

1211
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:29,133
That guy with the
metal arm, he's bionic.

1212
01:10:30,233 --> 01:10:31,167
- Bionic?

1213
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,433
- Yeah, bionic.

1214
01:10:33,867 --> 01:10:36,800
Anyway, yeah, there are
 such things as bionic arms

1215
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,800
and legs and toes and stuff too.

1216
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,067
We just think
 they're make believe

1217
01:10:41,067 --> 01:10:43,400
because the FDA
 never approved them.

1218
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,767
You can't like buy
 them or anything.

1219
01:10:45,767 --> 01:10:48,200
- Uh huh, I'll bet.

1220
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:52,233
So is that like Vulcan
technology or Earth technology?

1221
01:10:52,233 --> 01:10:54,200
- I'm serious, Rudy!

1222
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,400
The reason the FDA
 never approved them

1223
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:59,400
is because they
 have one fatal flaw.

1224
01:11:01,067 --> 01:11:05,233
A universal TV remote
messes them up real bad.

1225
01:11:05,233 --> 01:11:06,067
Watch.

1226
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,700
It's like Rock 'em
 Sock 'em Robots.

1227
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,067
- I can't control it!

1228
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,167
- Almost done.

1229
01:11:36,533 --> 01:11:37,467
- I'm okay.

1230
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,333
I'm okay.

1231
01:11:40,233 --> 01:11:41,733
I'm not gonna die.

1232
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:44,800
Okay.

1233
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:47,867
Okay.

1234
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,933
What's goin' on?

1235
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:57,067
Ahhh, not again!

1236
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:05,067
(lasers firing)

1237
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:23,367
- Looks like this scrub
will be out for a while.

1238
01:12:23,367 --> 01:12:24,867
So will his buddy.

1239
01:12:33,167 --> 01:12:34,633
Where is it?

1240
01:12:34,633 --> 01:12:35,467
Rudy.

1241
01:12:37,267 --> 01:12:38,933
I found the scanner.

1242
01:12:42,433 --> 01:12:43,433
Where is it?

1243
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,667
- I found it!

1244
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:49,567
- How do you know?

1245
01:12:52,633 --> 01:12:53,967
Very convenient.

1246
01:12:55,067 --> 01:12:58,133
(lasers firing)

1247
01:12:58,133 --> 01:12:58,967
- Go Josh!

1248
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:33,067
- Ahhh?

1249
01:13:36,967 --> 01:13:38,300
- Did I get hit?

1250
01:13:43,467 --> 01:13:44,900
A filter.

1251
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,733
That thing will
 tear me to pieces.

1252
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:51,900
- Excellent.

1253
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:54,233
Incapacitated at last.

1254
01:13:54,233 --> 01:13:56,333
The filter will shred
 this little boy to pieces

1255
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:59,067
and I won't even have
 to lift a finger.

1256
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,133
But then what fun
 would that be, hmm?

1257
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:06,833
- Stop it, you freak!

1258
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:10,067
- Don't upset the
 doctor, little girl.

1259
01:14:23,433 --> 01:14:25,467
- I don't have enough power.

1260
01:14:25,467 --> 01:14:26,700
I need a boost.

1261
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:34,067
If I can get to the intake
 valve, I can reverse the flow.

1262
01:14:34,067 --> 01:14:36,900
If I put pressure on
the exterior (mumbles),

1263
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:40,800
I'll launch myself
 right out of here.

1264
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,067
You'd have to be pretty small

1265
01:14:42,067 --> 01:14:44,833
to fit through one
 of those things.

1266
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:47,633
In fact, you'd have to
 be a regular munchkin.

1267
01:14:47,633 --> 01:14:49,500
(phone ringing)

1268
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,433
Rudy?

1269
01:14:50,433 --> 01:14:52,567
- Josh, we found the antidote.

1270
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:54,100
- You won't make it in time.

1271
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:57,333
I'm about to get sucked into
 the tank's recycling system.

1272
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:59,833
And there's this evil chick
 after me in a killer sub.

1273
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:01,367
She's got Courtney.

1274
01:15:01,367 --> 01:15:03,967
- We're on our way right
 now to re-enlarge you guys.

1275
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:05,467
- Look, there's no time.

1276
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:07,833
There's only one way for
 me to get out of this jam.

1277
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:10,800
I'm gonna swing by and pick
 up Courtney on my way out.

1278
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,367
- [Rudy] How are
 you gonna do that?

1279
01:15:12,367 --> 01:15:15,367
- Just go inside
 and watch the tank.

1280
01:15:30,633 --> 01:15:33,300
- What does he think he's doing?

1281
01:16:54,367 --> 01:16:56,067
- Hang on, Courtney.

1282
01:17:16,867 --> 01:17:19,067
(screams)

1283
01:17:20,733 --> 01:17:21,900
- Nobody move!

1284
01:17:23,867 --> 01:17:26,067
(beeping)

1285
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,600
- There they are.

1286
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,867
- Well, here goes nothin'.

1287
01:18:01,133 --> 01:18:05,300
- Oh man, this is the best
 dance party of my life.

1288
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:11,600
- It's working!

1289
01:18:19,267 --> 01:18:22,667
- You may have saved your friend
for the moment, little boy,

1290
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:27,167
but I will still take over the
 world and no one can stop me!

1291
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:29,400
(laughing)

1292
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,067
- You know, I was getting
 real sick of all that

1293
01:18:39,067 --> 01:18:41,867
"I'm gonna take over
 the world" jazz.

1294
01:18:41,867 --> 01:18:44,100
It's like, shut up already.

1295
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,400
- I'm gonna go
 out on a limb here

1296
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,400
and assume we're
 back to normal size.

1297
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,167
- Yeah, except for your clothes.

1298
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:14,567
So, why did you take
 that formula anyway?

1299
01:19:15,867 --> 01:19:20,300
- Well, because I know
you only like tall guys,

1300
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,433
and I was hoping that the
 formula would make me taller.

1301
01:19:23,433 --> 01:19:24,600
- What?

1302
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,467
I love short guys.

1303
01:19:26,467 --> 01:19:27,300
- Huh?

1304
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,567
How could you possibly
 like short guys?

1305
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:32,633
- Because, silly, then
 I don't have to stand

1306
01:19:32,633 --> 01:19:34,967
on my tippy toes to do this.

1307
01:19:41,733 --> 01:19:45,667
- Well, I think our
 work here is done.

1308
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:47,733
- I guess I should call
 the cops, get these jerks

1309
01:19:47,733 --> 01:19:49,833
and their bad wardrobe
 out of here, huh?

1310
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:50,833
- We should.

1311
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:54,500
Hey Josh, the sub's wrecked.

1312
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:58,067
What are we gonna do
 for a science project?

1313
01:19:58,067 --> 01:20:00,167
- Boys, I am proud to inform you

1314
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:03,067
you have won the
science fair hands down.

1315
01:20:03,067 --> 01:20:05,167
The judges were so
 impressed, they were already

1316
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:07,000
callin' up the local media.

1317
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,333
What's that I'm hearing?

1318
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:09,167
MIT?

1319
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:12,100
You two gotta tell
 me how you did this.

1320
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:15,067
This is a scientific
 miracle, man.

1321
01:20:15,067 --> 01:20:16,300
- Oh, I think we're
 gonna keep that one

1322
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,333
a secret for now, Mr. Duncan.

1323
01:20:18,333 --> 01:20:20,167
- Let me out of here.

1324
01:20:20,167 --> 01:20:21,533
Campbell, you better
 let me out of here.

1325
01:20:21,533 --> 01:20:23,267
You're messin' with
 the wrong dude.

1326
01:20:23,267 --> 01:20:25,667
- Should we tell him
 about the antidote?

1327
01:20:25,667 --> 01:20:28,200
- Nah, let's give
 him a few days.

1328
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,633
Besides, I think he's
 gonna like the fact

1329
01:20:29,633 --> 01:20:30,800
that he's finally gonna get an A

1330
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,067
in science class
without having to cheat.

1331
01:20:33,067 --> 01:20:36,933
- Aww, come on, what
 did I ever do to you?

1332
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:38,767
Hey, don't kiss him!

1333
01:20:38,767 --> 01:20:41,500
What about our relationship?

1334
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:44,133
We're still goin'
 out, aren't we?

1335
01:20:44,133 --> 01:20:44,967
Courtney!

1336
