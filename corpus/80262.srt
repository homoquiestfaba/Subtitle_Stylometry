Hell no!

About time.
What the fuck took you so long?

64
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:48,272
Your mamma wouldn't let me go.

65
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:51,978
You keep talking that shit and l'm gonna
stop using Vaseline on your sister.

66
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:56,417

00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:23,674
Oh, no, no, no, no.

75
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:26,049
She don't like being
bothered while she eats.

76
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,213
Yeah, right, fool.

77
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:30,086
- Look out!

78
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:31,317
Let me handle that brew.

79
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:35,692
- Let me handle that brew, Pedro.
- You can handle these nuts.

80
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:40,098
- Hey, put this on the grill.
- Oh, now l'm Benson.

81
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:42,292
No, just kidding.

82
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:45,429
- What is it?
- Carne asada.

83
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:47,440
- Put that shit on.
- Yeah.

84
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:49,999
- Hey Brisco, you got some bones?
- Oh, hell yeah.

85
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:51,806
Oh, yeah, yeah, hold up

00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:54,678
Hey homie, take a picture

00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:57,478
Picture of the homies.

All right.

89
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,357
You can't be hangin' no dominoes.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

90
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:12,627
Fool, you can't hang.

91
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,224
That's why l beat your ass

92
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:16,963
seven games last week
and took $200 from you.

93
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:18,800
Don't act like
you are used to this.

94
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:22,171
What the fuck?
So you're a history teacher now?

95
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,574
That was last week,
l'm talking about right now.

96
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,239
You'll never beat me again,
or take another dime from me.

97
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,407
Domino, motherfucker!

98
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:31,917
Am l a history teacher?
Yeah, l do current events, too.

99
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:33,977
You owe me 200 more
dollars and l want it.

100
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,681
Whatever man,
l'll get you that.

101
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,952
- You guys be cheating!

102
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:40,425
Man, forget these dominoes,
let's get some bud.

103
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,190
Why you saying ''let's,''
like you got some money?

104
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,630
Man, l ain't had no bomb-ass bud
in about three months.

105
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,293
- Well, let's get some.
- From where?

106
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:49,597
My homie Big Will.

107
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:52,867
Wait a minute,
don't he live in 8 trays?

108
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:55,136
Man, he don't bang.
He just sell bud.

109
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,609
He may not bang, but all of them
fools around him do.

110
00:04:57,644 --> 00:04:59,703
Them 8 trays
is crazy as a motherfucker.

111
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:03,341
My homie Cesar, plenty of bud.
He'll give it us for free, too.

112
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:05,078
And his daddy is Mexican mafia.

113
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:07,450
Well, we got to do one.
We need bud.

114
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,148
l ain't fucking with them.

115
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,986
Let's roll to my boy Cesar's then.

116
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:14,050
We'll be up out of the house
before his pops knows we're there.

117
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:15,959
l'd rather do that,
because 8 trays

118
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:18,692
is feuding with the little
knuckle heads from around here.

119
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:22,600
Homie, l'd say let's just get
something to drink and kick it.

120
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:26,402
What? We got drink.
We need bud.

121
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,636
Hay Love,
do you have some money?

122
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,735
Man, y'all know
l'm waiting on my check.

123
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:33,370
l'm just trying
to hook y'all up.

124
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:37,110
l mean, l might just want
to take a little hit.

125
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,208
Just like l thought.

126
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:40,242
lf you gonna charge me
for a couple of hits,

127
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:42,311
you can have
my last two dollars.

128
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:43,879
Two dollars?

129
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,185
Hit what?

130
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:48,685
Who got the bud?

131
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:51,253
- Oh, shit!
- Ray Ray?

132
00:05:51,297 --> 00:05:54,425
- When you get out?
- Two hours ago.

133
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,765
What's up, Hay Love?

134
00:05:56,803 --> 00:06:00,239
- Uh, nothing.
- You still a bitch!

135
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:03,333
Yeah, yeah,
pretty much.

136
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,105
Roll me up a fatty, fool.

137
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:07,670
- Uh...
- You heard me, bitch!

138
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:08,806
Roll me up a joint!

139
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,543
Hold up, homie,
we ain't got no weed.

140
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,483
- Where you going?
- l don't know.

141
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,147
- Hay Love, where you going?
- l don't know.

142
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:16,780
Hey homie, we was
trying to decide

143
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:18,723
on where we were going
to get the bud from.

144
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:22,023
Either Pedro's homeboy
or Hay Love's people, Big Will.

145
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:23,723
Big Will from 8 trays?

146
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:26,095
Man, he don't bang,
he just sell bud!

147
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:28,692
Yeah, well you go on with me.

148
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:32,193
What? We haven't decided
if we goin' over there or not!

149
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:36,538
l decide! l need to handle
some of them fools anyway!

150
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,441
l don't bang.
What you want from me?

151
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,470
- Shut the fuck up, you go!
- Homie, hold up.

152
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,880
You can't just be
kidnapping people and shit.

153
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,316
That shit's foul, man.

154
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:48,912
- You just got out of jail.
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:51,116
Shit don't work
like that no more.

156
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:52,920
Times have changed.

157
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,120
People get shot
for that shit now!

158
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,095
So, should l shoot
you motherfuckers?

159
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,257
- Oh, shit!
- Ray Ray's got a gun!

160
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:05,137
You just got out two hours ago.
How'd you get a gun already?

161
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,264
Ray Ray, calm down.

162
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:10,276
Do l look nervous? Brisco!

163
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,971
Do l look nervous?

164
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:13,979
No, actually you look
pretty fucking calm.

165
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:18,416
You know why?
Hay Love, do you know why?

166
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:22,547
Because 10 years in prison made you
realize that violence is not the way?

167
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:26,719
Hell no! Smoking fools
ain't no thing to me.

168
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,786
l'd kill all you motherfuckers
then sit down and eat cheesecake.

169
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:33,128
Get one big fat-ass pastramis from
the hamburger stand down the street.

170
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,634
Pedro, they still make

00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:43,935

173
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:46,605
l have to apologize
to you, Hay Love.

174
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:49,206
Somewhere along the line
you got the impression

175
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:51,080
that you have a choice.

176
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:54,484
But if you don't get
your ass in that car,

177
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:57,581
l ain't gonna be mad,
but my gun...

00:08:14,174 --> 00:08:16,506
Man, l feel you but...

and his father really worth it?

183
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:24,349
Man, after that shit, l'd steal some
weed out of the FBl evidence room.

184
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:26,477
- You know what l'm sayin'?

185
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,510
- Well, let's do the damn thing.

186
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:37,023
Ray Ray, what you doing, man?

187
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:38,894
This is where they hang out at.

188
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,830
That's what l mean.
What the fuck are you doing?

189
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:47,103
Ray Ray, what you doing, man?

190
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:52,542
l'm gonna eat this pastrami,
then l'm gonna go over there,

191
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:56,538
and smoke either all
or some them fools.

192
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,279
- For what?
- When l was in the pen,

193
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,651
one of the homeboys
was talking shit to me.

194
00:09:01,688 --> 00:09:03,178
So where is he?

195
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:04,781
He's still locked up.

196
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:08,385
So you mean to tell me you gonna shoot
up everybody except for him?

197
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,521
That's the way it goes, player.

198
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:13,532
What you want with me?
l'm gonna run!

199
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:17,161
- Oh, you gonna run out on me?
- Man, l ain't got no gun or nothing.

200
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:19,805
There you go.

201
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,603
What the fuck you want me
to do with this, throw it?

202
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,303
That motherfucker might work.

203
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:28,041
This old-ass gun,
who's is it, Wyatt Earp's?

204
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:31,278
Don't be shaking that motherfucker
around, it might go off.

205
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,682
What?

206
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:35,882
All l'm saying is, if you got
to sneeze or something,

207
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:37,981
you better put
the motherfucker down first.

208
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:41,585
- Oh my God!
- Why you soundin' like a little bitch?

209
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:45,029
- l-- l-- uh--
- Look, when l was in the pen,

210
00:09:45,064 --> 00:09:47,999
all l could do is think
about smoking 8 trays.

211
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:50,628
When them motherfuckers
were fucking with big Ray Ray,

212
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,763
they didn't know
who they were fucking with.

213
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:54,204
- Uh-uh-uh--
- But it's too late.

214
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,731
Now l'm about to kill
all their asses.

215
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:58,539
l'm gonna go down to smoke--

216
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:00,478

217
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:02,572

Oh!

This is where my dad

00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:46,945
Fights?

245
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:49,420
Hey, man, these are my boys,

00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,706
He invites them here

252
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:13,644
then he invites some wealthy
friends over to bet on them.

253
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,375
You think we should be

Don't worry about it bro,

Well... l guess it's okay.

00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:12,847
As long as they know,
it's something

00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:15,827
that cannot be spoken about
beyond these walls.

308
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,556
You guys understand, right?

309
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:20,430
- Of course.
- Definitely.

310
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,297
Don't even worry about it, Fred.

00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,763

- Thank you for the hospitality.
- Fuck you, you little bitch.

321
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:01,263
What's wrong, Fred?

322
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:03,275
You, call me Fred

323
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:06,176
l swear l'll stick this fucking spoon
in your worthless throat, huh?

324
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:09,376
Oh my God!

325
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:12,976
l don't know how you three

326
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,080

my son means everything to me.

329
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:26,254
His mother died
when he was 11 years old,

330
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,596
God rest her soul.

331
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,294
The woman was a saint.

332
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:30,734
And after she died,

333
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,228
l protected him.
l sheltered him.

334
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:36,673
Private schools,
nannies, everything,

335
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,973
to keep him away
from losers

336
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:40,706
like you three.

337
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:46,480
Now, he's all grown, he likes,
as you would say,

338
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:48,043
to do his own thing!

339
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:51,056
And l cannot stop him,
and lf l try,

340
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,254
he will hate me.
But l can protect him.

341
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,285
So...

342
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:01,423
if he so much as catches a cold,

343
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,992
while he is around you,

344
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:06,561
that would be a vacation

345
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,334
compared to what l would do

346
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:12,777
to you three pieces
of pig shit.

347
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:16,314
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, son!

348
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:20,046
Oh, ha, hey, you boys,

349
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:23,317
better get out there--
Mariano's about to fight!

350
00:17:23,356 --> 00:17:24,846
And you know he's
your favorite, son.

351
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,858
- ( growls )
- Let's go!

352
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,767
Out of all you stupid asses,

353
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:40,294
you seem to be the least stupid.

354
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:43,331
- Uh... thank you.
- Shut up.

355
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:48,638
l'm holding you personally
responsible for my boy.

356
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,740
lf anything happens to him,

357
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:53,149
l'm just going to kill
your friends, but you--

358
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:57,747
l am going to have
a doctor on the scene.

359
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,726
And every time my men
almost beat you half to death,

360
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:04,855
l'm going to have
the doctor bring you back.

361
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:09,061
That way l'll be able
to kill you five times.

362
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:14,064
ls your little brain able
to comprehend this?

363
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:15,971
Mm-hmm.

364
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,544
Well...

365
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,037
get the fuck out of my house,
you 're stinking idiot.

366
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,857
l see you were back there
talking to my dad. He's cool, huh?

367
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:37,658
Yeah, ice cold.

368
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:42,527
Oh, here come the fighters.
This is gonna be good.

369
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:46,363
What kind of satanic shit
is this, man?

370
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,136
l don't know, but weed or not,
l'm ready to bounce.

371
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:54,476
l've been ready to bounce, let's go.

372
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:56,276
What is bounce?

373
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:01,553
Oh, it means
giving thanks to the host.

374
00:19:01,587 --> 00:19:04,818
Ahhh! l just hope you're not talking
about running out on my son.

375
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:06,950
That would make him very sad.

376
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:10,359
And when he gets sad,
l get mad.

377
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:13,353
No, sir.

378
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:14,457
Never.

379
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,365
Wouldn't think of it, sir.

380
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,500
Hey, Mariano.

381
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,371
This is gonna be good.
Let's go.

382
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:46,858
Ladies and gentlemen,

383
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:49,732
you are about
to witness a challenge

384
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:52,601
between two
major forces of nature.

385
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:53,969
Our current opponent,

386
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:57,601
weighing 260 pounds,
the Highlander...

387
00:19:57,643 --> 00:20:01,670
versus our current
champion, weighing 275,

388
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:03,204
Mariano Big Dog.

389
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:06,412
Gentlemen, let's fight!

390
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:13,149
-  How many niggas come to brawl
-  Fight music

391
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:16,218
-  Another motherfucker on the wall
-  Fight music

392
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:18,924
-  You come down right to your fall
-  Fight music

393
00:20:18,964 --> 00:20:21,762
Catching niggas
from the side of the car

394
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,598
-  How many niggas come to brawl?
-  Fight music

395
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:27,265

396
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:30,241
-  You come down right to your fall
-  Fight music

397
00:20:30,276 --> 00:20:33,370
Catching niggas
from the side of the car

398
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,710
lntroducing the man of the year

399
00:20:35,748 --> 00:20:39,275
From manic it's simply clear
when you examine you can fear

400
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:42,446
Like all of the sphere,
half cannibal half bear

401
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:45,286
Actions you spare if you know
a nigga badder than this

402
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:47,053
Laughing at all you fagots
some more

403
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:49,356
You still bat about as fast a dog

404
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:51,863
You can crash like a car...
natural fall

405
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:55,389
After the judge, rehab, and the ball
you won it all from cash wars

406
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:57,629
So you ask for a job
forget the predictions

407
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,605
Sickest niggas that listen
and even if you critics is bitchin'

408
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:03,802
My mission, pay the ammunition,
put on a hard hat

409
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:06,174
Don't call us relax
while l'm on combat

410
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:09,078
Study the opponents

411
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:11,844
Checkin the sources
for the niggas all that

412

Categorize a niggas rhymes all that

413
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:16,516

of an exclusive specimen

414

Diggin my boots in the best
of the niggas crews

415
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:22,255
No hype, no journalist writes
no sound bytes

416
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:25,092
Just a night of 1,000 mics
surrounding you sight

417
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,065
Pound for pound of might
now pounds of strikes

418
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,829
Shout out your price...

419
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,961
( chorus repeats )

420
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:00,556

434
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,751
- Stay with the pops.
- Ain't nothing like family, homie.

435
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:06,230
l've been here all day.
l want to get out for a while.

436
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:07,459
But Cesar--

437
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:10,832
Dad, you're not about to start treating
me like a child again, are you?

438
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,239
No, son, no. Go.

439
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:21,574
Go.

440
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:23,706
Thanks, Dad.

00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,580
We'll be back later.
C'mon, guys, let's go.

442
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:31,384
Yeah.

443
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:00,913
Make sure you call my sister.
Tell her what l did for you.

444
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:05,549
- Tell her to make some tacos tonight.

445
00:24:05,591 --> 00:24:07,752

Blowing trees, l tried to tell
these fools they can't keep up with me

448
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:16,094
Slippin' and slidin', drippin' and

00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:18,262
Deep, in the back

450
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:20,533
Watch at the bus stop
as my trunk drop

451
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:24,064
When l stack up, wheels lookin'
like mirrors as they creep up...

452
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:26,737
Hey, we need to hurry up
and get this motherfucker home.

453
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:29,714
We need to make sure
nothing happens to him.

454
00:24:29,748 --> 00:24:32,012
'Cause if it does,
our ass is grass.

455
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,417
Let's tell him we got to do something
and he got to go home.

456
00:24:35,454 --> 00:24:37,285
Man, that's stupid.

457
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:39,051
You got a better idea?

458

459

- Hey, this ain't gonna get us nowhere.

460
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:47,229

462
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:51,864
What're you doing? Get over here

00:24:51,904 --> 00:24:53,701
Be right there, homie.

464

You just want to smoke out

467
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:04,747
Yeah, that's why l'm here.

Yeah, dude, what the fuck?

Man, y'all ain't gonna believe--

506
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:38,327

507
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,270
( laughing )

508
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:44,998

00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:50,947
You want some weed?

00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:56,520

511
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:01,254
Man, y'all need to listen

512
00:28:01,293 --> 00:28:02,726
Hay Love, man.

513
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:05,958
What you need to do
is come over here and hit this joint

514
00:28:05,998 --> 00:28:08,489
and calm down.

515
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:10,194
On the moon.

516
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:13,097
And then tell us what happened.

517
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,971

smoking no weed.

518
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:20,775
l mean, that's what all the shit
is over-- l just wanted some weed.

519
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:26,311
( coughing )
Mama!

520
00:28:30,055 --> 00:28:31,682
Now what you get

521
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,290
They got Ray Ray.
They got him.

522
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:37,818
l tried to tell him--

523
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:41,697
l tried to tell him let's get
some weed but he wouldn't listen.

524
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:44,634
He took out a gun,
and he gave me one.

525
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:47,297
See?

526
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,534
Damn, that's a raggedy-ass gun.

527
00:28:56,648 --> 00:28:59,276
Then what happened, dawg?

528
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:02,081
Then he was talking shit to me,
and they snuck up behind us,

529
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,179
and bam!

530
00:29:04,222 --> 00:29:08,682
Blood, brains and pastrami meat

531
00:29:08,727 --> 00:29:10,490
They got Ray Ray.

532
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:12,758
How'd you get away?

533
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:15,358
You remember that ugly bitch
l got pregnant?

534
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,425
Shaniqua.

535
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:21,098
Yeah, she ugly
and her baby ugly.

536
00:29:22,641 --> 00:29:23,733
But l tell you what,

537
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:26,642

538
00:29:26,678 --> 00:29:31,274
So today, l love ugly.
Viva la ugly, viva la ugly!

539
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:34,944
Oh shit.

540
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:47,231
Ahh, shit!

541
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:50,434
Ahh, shit!

542
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,670
You stupid motherfucker.
Ahh, shit!

543
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,768
No! No! No!

544
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:02,678
Oh, shit!

545
00:30:02,714 --> 00:30:05,012
Oh, shit!

546
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,984
You killed him!

547
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:08,883
Shoot yourself.

548
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,821
- What?
- Shoot your damn self. Do it now!

549
00:30:11,857 --> 00:30:14,018
- Hold on, Brisco.
- Fuck that.

550
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:15,788
lt was an accident!

551
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:19,058
lt doesn't matter.
We're still dead!

552
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:21,895
Accident?
You are fucking accident!

553
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,230
What we gonna do?

554
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:27,697
We gonna kill Hay Love.

555
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:30,606
- No, l don't like that plan.
- What good is that gonna do?

556
00:30:30,642 --> 00:30:35,579
We call Fredrico, we'll tell him some
stupid-ass fucking retarded idiot

557
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:37,707
came in to rob us,
and he shot Cesar,

558
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:39,740
and we shot him,

559
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:42,116
and to prove it we'll take
Hay Love's dead body.

560
00:30:42,154 --> 00:30:43,416
l don't like that plan.

561
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:47,551
- We can't do it, Brisco.
- Yes we can, yes we can.

562
00:30:47,592 --> 00:30:49,389
Pedro, he trippin'.

563
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:53,454
Oh, no! Y'all gonna kill me?

564
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:55,966
Please don't kill me, please.

565
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:59,437
l'll do anything.
Wait a minute, l got a gun.

566
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:01,598
Y'all talking about
how you're gonna kill me.

567
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,471
l'll kill your motherfucker ass!

568
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:07,706
Homie, the trigger and the firing pin
fell off the gun when you shot it.

569
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:10,909
Nobody can use this gun.

570
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:14,344
We'll kill him with garden tools.

571
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:16,911
And that way
it'll look like we was mad.

572
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:19,446
We just went crazy!

573
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:21,118
Brisco, you trippin'.

574
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,525
You think of something!
lf you don't like my shit,

575
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:24,790
y'all think of something.

576
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:26,592
What you thinking, Pedro?

577
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:31,492
Just got to call Fredrico
and just tell him what happened.

578
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:35,401
You remember what he said
when we was there.

579
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:37,874
He just gonna kill y'all one time.

580
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:39,877
He gonna kill me
like five fucking times.

581
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:41,640
What?

582
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:46,274
Look, it doesn't matter.

583
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:51,688
We fucked up,
whether it was an accident or not.

584
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:56,485
His son is dead.
He deserves to know.

585
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:58,086
l ain't calling.

586
00:31:58,129 --> 00:31:59,528
Make this motherfucker call.

587
00:31:59,564 --> 00:32:01,998
- Me?
- Yeah, you stupid-- you did it.

588
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,523
l don't know what to say!

589
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:07,334
l'm gonna get that shovel, you get
the rake, let's bash his fucking head!

590
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:11,536
All right, all right, hold on, you damn
maniac gardeners, l'll do it!

591
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:14,443
Well, do it then.
Make the fucking call.

592
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:17,812
Damn, what's the number?

593
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:20,682
555-7395.

594
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:26,958
Hello, l don't know
how to tell you this but...

595
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:29,256
we accidentally
domed your son.

596
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:31,956
Oh, domed means...

597
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:34,966
shoot him in the head,
by accident though.

598
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,266
l'm sorry, but y'all need to come get
him or something-- he just lying here.

599
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,307
She taking it hard, man.

600
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:48,608
l know, ma'am, l'm sorry.
lt's fucked up.

601
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:51,878
Hey Love, who're you talking to?

602
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,180
- l guess, his mother.
- His mother?

603
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:58,588
She keep talking about ''my son, my son,
he's only eight years old!''

604
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:01,114
Does this motherfucker
look eight years old to you?

605
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:03,593
l don't know, l guess she's
delirious or something!

606
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,563
- What number did you dial?
- The number that you gave me.

607
00:33:06,598 --> 00:33:08,623
555-7395?

608
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,693
95? l thought you said 7399!

609
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:16,798
- Woman: Hello?
- Oh, never mind.

610
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:22,371
- You stupid.
- Give me the phone.

611
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:24,808
l'll do it.

612
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:37,420
Mr. Sanchez?

613
00:33:39,597 --> 00:33:41,394
There's been an accident.

614
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,862
Cesar didn't make it.

615
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:07,953
What did he say?
What did he say?

616
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:13,022
Before or after

617
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:14,622
he said
he was gonna kill us all?

618
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:19,861
Slowly, except for Brisco.

619
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:25,104
He said something about
killing you slowly times five.

620
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:30,881
And then there was just
a lot of screaming and crying.

621
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:35,015
Let's just call the police
and say it was an accident.

622
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:37,214
For what?
We still going to jail.

623
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:39,553
And they can get us
in prison just as easy.

624
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:44,053
We need help.
We got to hide.

625
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:46,996
And where are we going to hide?
They can find us anywhere we go!

626
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:50,432
- We fucked!
- We need to call Krago.

627
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:53,198
Yeah, that's your homeboy, right?

628
00:34:53,238 --> 00:34:54,830
He'll know exactly what to do.

629
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:56,431
Who's he?

630
00:34:58,476 --> 00:35:02,970
When we was kids, he used to be
in this fucked up abusive foster home,

631
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:04,743
so he ran away

632
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:07,980
and l used to take him
clothes and food and Cool-Aid and shit.

633
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:10,283
Why haven't l met him?
l never even heard of him.

634
00:35:10,321 --> 00:35:12,380
He's a criminal.
He a baller though.

635
00:35:12,424 --> 00:35:17,123
Shut up.
He's my dawg, though.

636
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:19,528
He just do his own thing
and l do mine.

637
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:22,795
- Our lifestyles just don't mix.
- Until now.

638
00:35:39,584 --> 00:35:42,610
Oh, where's mommy?

639
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:45,214
Look, look, who is that?

640
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:49,659
That's mommy.
''Hi mommy, l miss you.''

641
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,822
Want some candy?

642
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:55,696
Look, ah, oh!

643
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:57,928
Ooh, candy!

644
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:01,029
Yay!

645
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:13,042
So many hopes and dreams

646
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:15,211
cut down--

647
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:18,222
cut down by some maggots

648
00:36:18,256 --> 00:36:21,384
that don't deserve
to live another day.

649
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,421
l just want them to suffer.

650
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,802
Consistent pain
is all l want for these parasites.

651
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:07,593
Did someone call?

652
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:12,067
Can you bring them to me?

653
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,705
Sweetie, for the right price
l can find 2 Pac.

654
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:19,709
Then go,
go and do what you do.

655
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,855
Come on, come on

656
00:37:24,889 --> 00:37:26,516

657
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:30,551

660
00:37:34,232 --> 00:37:36,996
Come on, come on

661
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:39,629
Come on!

662
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,866
Seat belts on

663
00:37:41,906 --> 00:37:44,898
l wish these scary motherfuckers

664
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:47,036
Watch ya tone, bitch

665
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:49,569
Why is my hot ass attire

667
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:54,381
Hey, Krego,

00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,548
That's my nigga, man.

669
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:02,484
Spider always
wants to hit a nigga.

670
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:06,827
- What's up, Krego?
- Oh, man, l can't complain.

671
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:10,163

- Oh, yeah.

672
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:14,501
- Hey, shit, we need your help.
- Oh l know you need my help.

673
00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:15,904
lt's a long story.

674
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:18,603
Listen...

00:38:19,944 --> 00:38:25,280

680
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:39,192
Look, man, that shit was an accident,
l'm telling you, dawg.

681
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,698
l know you, man.

682
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:45,169
What l don't know is how you get
caught up in some shit like that?

683
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:46,693
Hey, what's up?!

684
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:49,502
- That answers the question.

685
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,802
Man, l got worried.

686
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:53,436
Y'all got honies back here,

You gonna get hit.

'Cause certain niggas
get you in some shit.

692
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:09,852
That's why when l did my shit,
right, l was on the low.

693
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:12,124
That's why l didn't hang out.

694
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:14,358
l know, homie,
no disrespect, dawg,

695
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:17,300
but l ain't really got time
to hear that shit right now.

696
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,668
Yeah, nigga,
you're right about that. Shit.

697
00:39:20,705 --> 00:39:21,865
So, what should we do?

698
00:39:21,906 --> 00:39:25,842
The first thing is--
this Fredrico nigga is for real, man.

699
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:28,869
- Remember that Fredrico nigga?
- Hell yeah, he wasn't no joke.

Y'all come on over here, man.

Man, l ain't talking about changing
who you niggas is, man.

754
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:34,287
Who you are

00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:36,664
And nothing
could change that, you dig?

756
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:38,965
But the outside
is what needs to be changed.

757
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:41,494
Only thing is gonna be different
is the way y'all look.

758
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:44,804
He ain't gonna make us
look all crazy and shit, is he?

They are not for play,
you understand?

772
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,702
- Fuck it, where do we got to go?
- Arizona.

773
00:43:18,743 --> 00:43:21,871
- Damn, they ain't got no local branch?
- Yeah.

774
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:24,848
Hey hell no, man,
these niggas are discreet, nigga.

775
00:43:24,882 --> 00:43:27,680
And they don't want a gang
of motherfuckers all in their mix.

776
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:30,516
Only a handful of people know
where these motherfuckers is at.

777
00:43:30,554 --> 00:43:32,681
And they wanna
keep it that way, Brisc.

00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:34,623
So, what do we do?

779
00:43:34,659 --> 00:43:38,220
Well the first thing is,
you take you some money,

780
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:41,254
and you go to this location.
l'll write it down for you.

00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:43,631
- ls that the place in Arizona?
- You're damn right.

782
00:43:43,668 --> 00:43:44,896
Then what?

783
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:48,463
Then you go to the location
and they'll tell you what to do.

784
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:54,177
Y'all move fast,
and we're so slow.

785
00:43:55,446 --> 00:43:59,883
Man, this shit sounds
like highly expensive, man.

786
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,714
How much
is all this shit gonna cost?

787
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:03,515
We'll get to that later!

788
00:44:03,554 --> 00:44:07,752
Brisc, fuck with me,

789
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,590
And the second most important
motherfucker thing,

00:44:10,628 --> 00:44:13,995
is this motherfuckin'
little dandy right here.

791
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:16,727
Let me find that shit
out of my motherfuckin' pocket.

792
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,132
Ha.

793
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:23,434
There's this card, you dig?
You understand?

794
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:26,904
Now without this card...

795
00:44:30,715 --> 00:44:34,207

and insequently,

796
00:44:34,251 --> 00:44:36,344

00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:52,760
Then how the fuck
are we supposed to get there?

803
00:44:52,803 --> 00:44:54,634
You go grab Hay Butt,

804
00:44:54,672 --> 00:44:57,402
and y'all motherfuckers

805
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:02,203

00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:39,238
Yeah.

832

Well, you just bring

You ain't never lie.

You damn right l ain't lying.

840
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:42,170
That the same thing happened
other day on 55th and Central.

841
00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:45,136
What?

842
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:49,139
The other day,
at 55th and Central.

843
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:57,281
Lijah, what the fuck
do you be saying?

844
00:47:57,321 --> 00:48:01,758
The other day
at Fifty-''fithe'' and Central.

845
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:10,898
Oh, shit!

846
00:48:10,935 --> 00:48:14,769
Could you help me up and shut the fuck
up before you say anything?

847
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:22,339
- Oh, motherfucker!
- Where is my cane?

848
00:48:22,379 --> 00:48:24,313
Do you want to just die?

849
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:26,612
Help me up! All right, nigga.

850
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:33,318
l got it, nigga.

851
00:48:33,357 --> 00:48:36,622
Oh, Superman strong now.

852
00:48:41,232 --> 00:48:44,963
- My cane.
- l can't get that motherfucker.

853
00:48:45,002 --> 00:48:46,469
Sure, get it later.

854
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:53,206
Lijah, why can nobody understand
what the hell you be saying?

855
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:55,678
Everybody understand me just fine.

856
00:48:55,713 --> 00:48:58,477
You just don't listen!
And that's your problem.

857
00:48:58,515 --> 00:48:59,607
Oh, l listen!

858
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:04,485
But it sounds like you got shit
and shoestrings all over your mouth.

859
00:49:05,756 --> 00:49:07,485
Listen!

860
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:09,219
Listen for what?

861
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,660
l already know everything!

862
00:49:11,695 --> 00:49:14,721
Only thing
somebody could tell me

863
00:49:14,765 --> 00:49:18,724
is some shit l already know.

864
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:22,728
Well, Lonnie, l swear for God,

865
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:25,708
you crazy enough
to be a maniac.

866
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:27,870
Now, the man can't listen,

867
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:30,311
and the man don't know
what he doing.

868
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:32,941
And the man who don't know
what he doing,

869
00:49:32,983 --> 00:49:36,919
and the man is going be his own demise
and the Bible said that!

870
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:39,582
- Bible said what?
- What l just said!

871
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:41,022
Listen.

872
00:49:41,058 --> 00:49:44,858
Listen for what?
l can't understand your old ass.

873
00:49:44,895 --> 00:49:46,760
You old too.

874
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:50,392
l'm 23 days younger
than your ass.

875
00:49:50,434 --> 00:49:52,766
You ignorant, too.

876
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:54,896
Lijah, l ain't thinking
about your ass.

877
00:49:54,938 --> 00:49:56,963
Yes, you are.

878
00:49:57,007 --> 00:49:58,599
You're a crazy fool.

879
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:03,306
( laughing )

880
00:50:05,949 --> 00:50:09,350
Boy, you know you love me.

881
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:15,086
Lijah, you can go pee blood on the side
of that tree for all l care.

882
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:17,218
You're the one with the bad kidney.

883
00:50:21,832 --> 00:50:23,800
Fuck you, Lijah.

884
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:28,266
Yeah, okay, well, you know what?

885
00:50:32,843 --> 00:50:37,678
Lonnie, you seem to talk
a whole lot of shit.

886
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:39,842
Oh, you got up?

887
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:42,784
Yeah, l walk.

888
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:47,985
Sometimes l really think you
think you can get some of this!

889
00:50:48,025 --> 00:50:50,926
Get some of what?
There ain't shit there!

890
00:50:52,229 --> 00:50:55,562
You're certainly like a vulture.
Come get the meat, nigga.

891
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:58,326
What's the matter with you?

892
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:00,769
You are too old to be trying
to fight a motherfucker.

893
00:51:00,804 --> 00:51:03,466
You trying to give me a case.

894
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:05,941
Now, that was amusing.

895
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:09,935
Now, l told you damn reporters
stay from around here.

896
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,973
They came and got that boy
out of here a long time ago.

897
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:15,712
Now you...

898
00:51:17,488 --> 00:51:21,584
you and your ugly-ass
cameraman turn around,

899
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:24,753
- and get the hell off my property.
- Tell 'em.

900
00:51:24,795 --> 00:51:26,592
That's what we're trying to do.

901
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,893
The boy went out
with his own family--

902
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:35,871
you need to do
your family and friends.

903
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:38,600
Can't do that.

904
00:51:38,642 --> 00:51:41,270
First l have to find
who is responsible for all this.

905
00:51:41,311 --> 00:51:45,145
Oh, hell no! Hell no!

906
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:48,709
You mean to tell me that
you understand what he's saying?

907
00:51:48,752 --> 00:51:50,014
Perfectly.

908
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:53,752
Listen!

909
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:58,455
Get the hell off my property
and take this crazy-ass fool with you.

910
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,598
Sorry, sweetie.
lt ain't that easy.

911
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:07,969
Oh, l see.
l'm gonna have to go get my pistol.

912
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,965
- What they doin'?
- l don't know.

913
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:14,034
Does this look like a pistol?

914
00:52:14,077 --> 00:52:15,544
Run, Lijah.

915
00:52:18,615 --> 00:52:21,641
Damn! You too stupid to run!

916
00:52:21,685 --> 00:52:25,712
Lonnie, l ain't gonna put
no pressure on my back leg.

917
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:29,192
Shit, l'd rather get shot than let
this bunion swell up on me again.

918
00:52:29,226 --> 00:52:32,354
We just need to ask some questions
about your tenants and his friends.

919
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:36,025
A snitch? No problem.

920
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:39,467
Lonnie, don't you dare
snitch on them boys.

921
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:43,769
Look here, Lijah.
l give a damn about being a snitch.

922
00:52:43,807 --> 00:52:45,104
We ain't in prison.

923
00:52:45,142 --> 00:52:49,408
And if we was,
l sure would cut your ass.

924
00:52:49,446 --> 00:52:52,574
There you go, there you go, trying
to be an old-ass gangster!

925
00:52:52,616 --> 00:52:53,981
Boys!

926
00:52:56,053 --> 00:52:59,250
l'm sorry, sweetie.
What is it that you need?

927
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:01,382
Where are they?

928
00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:04,019
That l couldn't tell you.
l don't know.

929
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:05,653
What can you tell me?

930
00:53:05,696 --> 00:53:08,563
l know they left.
They left everything--

931
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:11,625
checkbook, wallet and all.

932
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:16,105
Where can a man go
with no money, l.D. or nothing?

933
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:18,073
Maybe he has a friend
who has money.

934
00:53:18,108 --> 00:53:20,099
That bunch?

935
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:23,704
They couldn't put enough
together to buy a pack of ketchup.

936
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:26,841
And l guarantee that's two dollars
more than your ass got.

937
00:53:26,884 --> 00:53:29,876
Shut your ass up
before l push you.

938
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,117
Maybe he asked other friends
that might be able to give him money.

939
00:53:33,156 --> 00:53:34,953
So he can live for a while.

940
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:37,017
Oh, that l couldn't tell you.

941
00:53:38,695 --> 00:53:42,995
Ahh, yeah! There is this
one guy who lives uptown.

942
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:46,799
He'd be partying with them celebrities,
a lot of them sports stars,

943
00:53:46,837 --> 00:53:49,635
and all them other assholes.

944
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:52,767
They got a lot of money--
they don't know what to do with it.

945
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:56,770
What'd they call him? Uh...

946
00:53:56,813 --> 00:53:59,611
Damn!
What'd they call him?

947
00:54:01,418 --> 00:54:04,819
He's a ghetto superstar.
Ghetto superstar.

948
00:54:04,855 --> 00:54:06,117
How do you know this?

949
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:08,590
My nephew told me.
He around their age.

950
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,355
- And they are friends?
- No, they just talk.

951
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:12,692
But?

952
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:17,325
But when he was younger,
Brisco used to take care of him.

953
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:21,895
Will you stay your ass still--
you're makin' me nervous.

954
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:31,580
ls this them?

955
00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:34,407
That's all of them.

956
00:54:34,451 --> 00:54:36,885
And where does
this ghetto superstar live?

957
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:40,822
You go all the way
down Main until it ends,

958
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:44,293
you make a left,
and it's right there.

959
00:54:44,328 --> 00:54:47,024
My Aunt Mabel used
to own the house next door.

960
00:54:47,064 --> 00:54:48,793
Your Aunt Mabel's a ho.

961
00:54:48,832 --> 00:54:50,527
You hater.

962
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:53,092
Well, thank you, gentlemen.

963
00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:55,070
That's it.
Have a nice day.

964
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:02,875
What would
your old ass do with that?

965
00:55:02,913 --> 00:55:05,848
l'd do some tricks.
Boy, l'd flip.

966
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:08,180
Boy-- boy, you don't know me!

967
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:10,118
You don't know me.

968
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:11,643
Not like l knew your mama.

969
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:14,156
- Snitch!
- Fuck you.

970
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,255
Fuck you!

971
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:20,354
l was saving your life.

972
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:24,625
Get my cane.

973
00:55:27,337 --> 00:55:30,067
Why did l bring
this old motherfucker?

974
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:32,473
Get these
fucking directions right.

975
00:55:32,509 --> 00:55:36,309
Men, we got cheese,
a bomb-ass ride.

976
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:39,144
Homie, let's stop by the club and get
some honies or something.

977
00:55:39,182 --> 00:55:42,709
Hay Love, your life is in danger, and
all you can think about is the club?

978
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:45,244
- Man, l said honies t--
- We need to keep moving.

979
00:55:45,288 --> 00:55:48,724
You right, let's just stop by the mall
get the new joints that just come out.

980
00:55:48,759 --> 00:55:52,388
Man, we ain't going to no club,
we ain't picking up no ladies

981
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:54,920
and damn sure ain't going
to no motherfuckin' mall.

982
00:55:54,965 --> 00:55:58,196
Hay Love, you really need to shut up.
lt's your fault we in this shit.

983
00:55:58,235 --> 00:56:00,260
- My fault?
- Both: Hell yeah!

984
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:04,137
Man, y'all was the ones in the garage
smoking weed with him.

985
00:56:04,174 --> 00:56:05,698
He didn't die from too much weed.

986
00:56:05,742 --> 00:56:07,733
He died 'cause
you put a bullet in his head!

987
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:09,006
- Fuck you, Pedro!
- Huh?

988
00:56:09,446 --> 00:56:11,573
Trying to make me sound
like Dirty Harry or somebody.

989
00:56:11,615 --> 00:56:13,810
We wanted some weed,
he had the weed.

990
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:15,943
He smoked the weed,
y'all smoked the weed.

991
00:56:15,986 --> 00:56:18,454
l smoked the weed,
and because l was high off the weed,

992
00:56:18,488 --> 00:56:20,217
l accidentally split his wig.

993
00:56:20,257 --> 00:56:22,521
But, if y'all want
to blame me, fine.

994
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,754
l still think, obvious,
it was the weed.

995
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:42,838
( water splashes )

996
00:56:50,454 --> 00:56:51,819
l hope you don't mind,

997
00:56:51,855 --> 00:56:54,016
the water looks so inviting.

998
00:56:54,057 --> 00:56:56,116
Besides,
l didn't want to wake you.

999
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,252
lt's all good, baby.
Handle your business.

1000
00:56:58,295 --> 00:56:59,887
lt's your bad ass.

1001
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:11,638
Well, you're pretty calm.

1002
00:57:13,143 --> 00:57:15,805
l mean, for a man
who has a gun pointed at his head.

1003
00:57:15,846 --> 00:57:19,009
You must have had something like this
happen to you at one time or another.

1004
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:21,517
l've been there before.
lt ain't shit.

1005
00:57:22,786 --> 00:57:24,515
Well good,

1006
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:27,523
'cause l love a man
who can handle his shit under pressure.

1007
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:29,787
l'm glad you dig it.

1008
00:57:29,826 --> 00:57:32,192
l'll dig you too, shit!

1009
00:57:32,229 --> 00:57:35,926
You look real calm,
cool, and collective.

1010
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:39,868

Man, l don't think that's really

This here,

He got his head fucked up at one

1137
01:05:41,884 --> 01:05:45,376
He ran out on the dirt track when this

his favorite one,
won the competition.

1139
01:05:47,323 --> 01:05:49,621
He ran out, slipped on the mud,

1140
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:53,026
and got ran over
by one of them big ass tires.

1141
01:05:53,062 --> 01:05:57,089
And then, the exhaust
from the truck burned his face off.

1142
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:00,534
- l'm retarded.
- Boy, you're not retarded.

1143
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:03,300
Your head just got smashed

01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:05,603
But you're not retarded.
Now you shut up!

Show me something.

1340
01:17:04,133 --> 01:17:07,432
Show him you got on man drawers
so he'll shut up about the panties.

1341
01:17:09,772 --> 01:17:12,570
You, you-- you do

1342
01:17:12,608 --> 01:17:14,007
Hell yeah, l do.

1343
01:17:14,043 --> 01:17:17,342
l'm ain't about to pull down my pants
and show this vegetable shit.

1344
01:17:17,379 --> 01:17:19,244
Show him the elastic

1345
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:22,045
ls this shit worth our life,
or what? Come on!

1346
01:17:22,084 --> 01:17:23,517
Hmm?!

1347
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,019
All right, man, shut up.

1348
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:30,957
Oh! ( laughing )

1349
01:17:33,796 --> 01:17:37,391
- Man, this is some weird shit.
- And where's Brisco?

1350
01:17:37,433 --> 01:17:40,027
We only got 15 minutes left.

1351
01:17:40,069 --> 01:17:42,094
- We need to think of a plan ''B.''
- Like what?

1352
01:17:42,137 --> 01:17:43,627
l don't know, but we need
to think of--

1353
01:17:45,808 --> 01:17:47,776
What the hell is he doing?

1354
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:52,340
Boy, what the hell you doing?
Stop that!

1355
01:17:52,381 --> 01:17:54,941
l said stop that!

1356
01:17:59,421 --> 01:18:02,219
- l love her!
- Who? Who you love?

1357
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:03,952
Pink panties.

1358
01:18:03,993 --> 01:18:07,895
What the hell y'all do
to get my boy this riled up, huh?

1359
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:11,366
- We didn't do nothing.
- She showed me her panties!

1360
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,164
What kind of freaky shit
y'all got going up in here?

1361
01:18:14,203 --> 01:18:15,670
And without Rufus?

1362
01:18:15,704 --> 01:18:17,968
No, sir, you got it all wrong.

1363
01:18:18,007 --> 01:18:21,704
Oh, no.
Good looking, y'all got it wrong.

1364
01:18:21,744 --> 01:18:23,541
And y'all one hour is up.

1365
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:25,444
You sure?

1366
01:18:25,481 --> 01:18:27,210
l'm sure they'll be here
any minute!

1367
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:30,218
They're not here now,
so you know what that means?

1368
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:33,449
Y'all belong to good old Rufus.

1369
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:36,049
- Oh fuck!
- ( doorbell rings )

1370
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:38,389
Both: Come in!

1371
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:40,452
( footsteps approaching )

1372
01:18:41,964 --> 01:18:43,693
Oh, hell yeah!

1373
01:18:43,732 --> 01:18:46,929
- Here's the card.
- Damn it.

1374
01:18:46,969 --> 01:18:48,402
Give me the address.

1375
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:50,496
There you go, boy.

1376
01:18:53,976 --> 01:18:55,967
You're like a regular
old superhero, huh?

1377
01:18:56,011 --> 01:18:58,741
Comin' to save the day
at the last second.

1378
01:18:58,781 --> 01:19:01,511
- Benny!
- Yes, papa.

1379
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:03,381
Come on,
it's time for your nap.

1380
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:08,989
Goodbye forever,
my love.

1381
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:17,124
Damn, let's get as far as we can
from this freak show.

1382
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:18,997
Oh, l'm with that!

1383
01:19:19,935 --> 01:19:22,130
- Howdy boys.
- Fuck.

1384
01:19:22,171 --> 01:19:24,935
You guys aren't being very
cooperative in letting me kill you.

1385
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:27,771
As a matter of fact,
down right defiant.

1386
01:19:27,810 --> 01:19:31,405
But you know what, baby?
That's okay, l forgive you.

1387
01:19:31,447 --> 01:19:34,007
We just need to make it right.

1388
01:19:34,049 --> 01:19:36,108
We need closure, baby.

1389
01:19:36,151 --> 01:19:38,381
Rufus: Whoo-wee!

1390
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:41,355
Old Rufus has to kill
somebody today, huh?

1391
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:44,620
Well, well, well.

1392
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,026
Don't you boys
have more lives than a cat?

1393
01:19:47,062 --> 01:19:49,394
You boys go on
and handle your business.

1394
01:19:49,431 --> 01:19:51,490
Old Rufus going to handle
his business here.

1395
01:19:51,533 --> 01:19:53,160
Y'all go on, get.

1396
01:19:53,202 --> 01:19:54,999
Go on!

1397
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:03,768
Boy, you's a big motherfucker.

1398
01:20:03,812 --> 01:20:06,042
( dogs barking )

1399
01:20:13,989 --> 01:20:15,320
l wonder what happened.

1400
01:20:15,357 --> 01:20:17,985
Man, shit, who cares?
Man, let's go, let's go.

1401
01:20:20,562 --> 01:20:22,029
Shit!

1402
01:20:59,434 --> 01:21:00,560
Y'all ready?

1403
01:21:00,602 --> 01:21:02,126
As ready
as we're ever gonna be.

1404
01:21:02,171 --> 01:21:03,866
Let's do it.

1405
01:21:03,906 --> 01:21:06,136
What are we supposed to do,
call somebody?

1406
01:21:06,175 --> 01:21:07,699
Shit!

1407
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:17,210
So, you don't wanna look
like yourself anymore, huh?

1408
01:21:19,388 --> 01:21:20,821
l'm about
to make that happen.

1409
01:21:20,856 --> 01:21:24,519
Don't look nervous now, fellas.
The hard part's done.

1410
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,825
Let me get this straight, Doc.
You can make us look like anybody?

1411
01:21:27,863 --> 01:21:30,991
l can make you look different, or l can
make you look like someone else.

1412
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:33,297
- Exactly like somebody else?
- Come on, exactly!

1413
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:34,734
Oh, damn!

1414
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:37,398
Make me look like that little
faggot on Soul Train.

1415
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,602
No, make me look like Billy D.,
the young one though.

1416
01:21:40,642 --> 01:21:43,839
Oh, hell, no! Denzel.
Make me look like Denzel.

1417
01:21:43,879 --> 01:21:44,868
Wait, wait. Hold up.

1418
01:21:44,913 --> 01:21:47,507
ls it going to cost more
to make him look like Denzel?

1419
01:21:47,549 --> 01:21:49,141
A whole lot more.

1420
01:21:49,184 --> 01:21:51,277
No, just make us look
like somebody else.

1421
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:54,551
Wait a minute. What celebrity
can l look like for the cheapest?

1422
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:57,388
- Spike Lee?
- Never mind.

1423
01:21:57,426 --> 01:21:59,792
Rufus:
Go on and get your asses in there!

1424
01:22:04,433 --> 01:22:06,765
Are these the ones
you was telling me about, Rufus?

1425
01:22:06,802 --> 01:22:08,827
Yes siree, Bob.

1426
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:11,737
Well, l got special plans
for these two.

1427
01:22:11,773 --> 01:22:15,607
Ladies, take our patients in the back.
Let's get them ready.

1428
01:22:15,644 --> 01:22:17,271
This is what
l'm talking about.

1429
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:19,610
This is the way Hay Love's
supposed to be treated.

1430
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:46,936
- Damn!
- What's up, boys?

1431
01:22:46,975 --> 01:22:48,943
- Jay Rob?
- Brisco?

1432
01:22:48,977 --> 01:22:50,740
Ah shit! Pedro?

1433
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:52,679
What up?

1434
01:22:52,714 --> 01:22:54,648
Oh, look at this motherfucker.

1435
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:57,811
Man, l'm about to get me
a new driver's license,

1436
01:22:57,853 --> 01:23:00,583
social security card,
and a credit card.

1437
01:23:00,622 --> 01:23:03,955
Then like Superman,
my job here is done.

1438
01:23:03,992 --> 01:23:05,823
But if you ever need
my services...

1439
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:07,192
Thank you.

1440
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:09,663
Hey, Doc,
what happened to--

1441
01:23:09,698 --> 01:23:11,996
You mean those two
that was chasing you?

1442
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:13,058
Yeah.

1443
01:23:13,101 --> 01:23:14,932
Let's just say we made sure

1444
01:23:14,970 --> 01:23:17,029
no one's gonna be
looking for you boys.

1445
01:23:17,072 --> 01:23:19,063
l threw in a couple
of extra surgeries.

1446
01:24:23,338 --> 01:24:24,930
Wow.

1447
01:24:34,516 --> 01:24:38,384
( muffled talking )

1448
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,173
You know these people, boss?

1449
01:25:07,215 --> 01:25:08,773
l do.

1450
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:13,386
These are the guys

1451
01:25:13,422 --> 01:25:15,253
that killed my son.

1452
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:16,757
( muffled screaming )

1453
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:22,224
l remember that one being taller
and this one being shorter,

1454
01:25:22,264 --> 01:25:27,167
but will never forget their faces.

1455
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:44,349
- Take care of them.
- Sure l will.

1456
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:52,650
( muffled screaming )

1457
01:25:54,696 --> 01:25:56,220
( gunshot )

1458
01:25:59,901 --> 01:26:01,300
Where to now?

1459
01:26:01,336 --> 01:26:05,705
- lt doesn't matter.
- Let's hit the club.

1460
01:26:07,943 --> 01:26:11,106

1461
01:26:11,146 --> 01:26:12,738

1472
01:26:47,015 --> 01:26:51,042
Swig cognac and see the day go by

1473
01:26:51,086 --> 01:26:54,783
Krego try to figure out
how we fit to lay but fly

1474
01:26:54,823 --> 01:26:59,089

'Cause surviving
is the only fucking goal l see

1480
01:27:13,241 --> 01:27:17,473
Why, what the fuck, bitch
nigga, this is Compton!

1481
01:27:17,812 --> 01:27:20,474
lf this world was mad

1482
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:25,748
l would place it at your feet

1483
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:29,086
- What's up, nigga?

1484
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:32,321
Fucking around singin'. You know

1485
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,294
Hey, you know l was

1487
01:27:37,065 --> 01:27:39,659

Just stand here

1490
01:27:44,673 --> 01:27:47,540
Hey, that's your little nephew's.

1491
01:27:47,576 --> 01:27:50,272
Little bad ass.

1492
01:27:53,915 --> 01:27:56,145
Ooh-wee.

1493
01:27:56,184 --> 01:27:59,415
Thinkin' of the last time

1494
01:27:59,454 --> 01:28:01,684
You caught me with your wife.

1495
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:06,286
Last time l got high,

1497
01:28:10,231 --> 01:28:11,858
But l'm gonna tell you what...

Why you gotta bring my momma--
you know my momma's been gone.

1499
01:28:15,136 --> 01:28:16,831
You said that
like you won something.

1500
01:28:16,871 --> 01:28:20,307
You know my momma's been gone?
You know my momma's been gone, no.

1501
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:23,243
Stupid motherfucker,

1502
01:28:23,278 --> 01:28:25,712
You know what else

1504
01:28:28,516 --> 01:28:31,144
- Who you gonna kick down?
