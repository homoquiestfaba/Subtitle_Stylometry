1
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,139
Three Communist PT boats
attacked an American destroyer

2
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,201
off the coast of Vietnam
yesterday,

3
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:49,806
and today, President Johnson's
response was hard and tough.

4
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,651
He has ordered the U.S. Navy
to continue patrolling there,

5
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:58,019
and if they are attacked,
to destroy their attackers.

6
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,116
I understand the feelings

7
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:04,356
of those who regret that
we must undertake air attacks.

8
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,194
I share those feelings.

9
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,564
Some nights, we're
the only airplane going up...

10
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,624
going up into the north

11
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:11,897
and when you're thinking
you're the only Americans

12
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,233
over North Vietnam,

13
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,797
it kind of makes you wonder
just a little bit, you know.

14
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,069
"What am I doing here?"

15
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,203
We have carefully limited
those raids.

16
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,214
They've been directed
at concrete and steel

17
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,875
and not human lives.

18
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:29,819
There are at least 850
antiaircraft and missile sites

19
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,050
around Hanoi and Haiphong.

20
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,855
These figures make
Hanoi's air defense

21
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,862
the toughest in the world.

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,295
If you can get between...

23
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,229
a ridge between you
and that radar site,

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,858
they can't guide
a missile at you.

25
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,631
It's just when you get down
in the delta in the flatlands,

26
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,104
that 30-mile ring around...
the city of Hanoi,

27
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,004
it's... it's a bear.

28
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,943
Representatives of Hanoi
simply returned our message

29
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,037
in a plain envelope.

30
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,050
Residents of North Vietnam's
capital felt confident

31
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,484
in the knowledge
that their city was off-limits

32
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:01,918
to U.S. warplanes.

33
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:06,322
With American sons
in the fields far away,

34
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:10,328
I shall not seek, and l
will not accept the nomination

35
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,831
of my party for another term
as your president.

36
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,766
The greatest honor
history can bestow

37
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:19,737
is the title of peacemaker.

38
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,000
Do you think it's worth it?

39
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,439
Yeah, l... I don't know.

40
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,568
They... they say we're
fighting for something.

41
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,611
I don't know.

42
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,976
Through a long and bitter
struggle in Vietnam,

43
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,139
American fighting men

44
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,149
have served the cause
of freedom magnificently.

45
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,878
You're... you're pretty scared

46
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,182
when you have to roll in
on something out there,

47
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,519
especially when you look down,
and you see nothing

48
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,956
but a black cloud or
a white cloud down below you.

49
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,052
It's a... it's about as...
as scary a mission

50
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,528
as I've ever been on.

51
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:48,055
I think it tries you
to just about the maximum,

52
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:50,034
you know, the missions.

53
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,164
Hey, Morg.

54
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,764
Did you ever notice how...

55
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,935
how some nights you could see
more stars

56
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,445
than other nights?

57
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,482
Huh? You ever notice that?

58
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,210
Hmm?

59
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,979
The stars.

60
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,146
Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,856
I've got an update.

62
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,983
I'm cycling to
the coast-in point.

63
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,960
You're getting
in a rut.

64
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,962
You're getting in a rut.

65
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,429
I mean, did you ever
stop to think

66
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,830
you're taking your job just
a little bit too seriously?

67
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,128
Look at me--
I enjoy my work.

68
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,168
Yeah, I'll bet.

69
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,237
See, I'm happy.

70
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,327
See? Look.

71
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,767
Enemy search radar

72
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,004
Iooking for company.

73
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,604
Okay...

74
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,648
Time to get on down.

75
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,740
Here we go.

76
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,891
Black Eagle, Devil 5-0-5.
Feet dry.

77
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,957
That's a roger, 5-0-5.

78
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,511
Look at that small-arms fire
down there, Morg.

79
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:42,070
Every cousin with a rifle, huh?

80
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,184
Jesus, you call that a rifle?

81
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,688
I lost them.

82
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,690
Yeah, you hope.

83
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,521
You got that riverbend ahead?

84
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,356
Just picked it up.

85
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,554
One more minute on this heading
to the turn point.

86
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,630
23 Mike, Mike-- I see them.

87
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,258
Go active on ECM.

88
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,461
Jam 'em up.

89
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,468
ECM active.

90
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:05,595
We're jammin'.

91
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,744
Where is it?
You got it? You see it?

92
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,838
No, not yet.

93
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,680
SAM, 10:00.

94
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,515
Jam!

95
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:31,024
Ah, Jesus.

96
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,587
That was a piece of cake.

97
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,728
This is it.

98
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,268
Stepping in to attack.

99
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,462
Arm 'em.

100
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,560
Your pickle is hot.

101
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,230
Get us up to 500 feet, partner,

102
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,740
unless you want to frag
your ass.

103
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,674
Nag, nag, nag.

104
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,475
Ground lock.

105
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,276
Steady...

106
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,248
They're off!

107
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,492
If you got the time,

108
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,323
we got the beer.

109
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,164
How about it?

110
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,165
Did you see anything down there?

111
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,064
Any secondary explosions?

112
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,159
Nothing.

113
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,761
Well, that's real nice.

114
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,033
-Suspected truck park.
-Nothing!

115
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,039
Nothing.

116
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,097
Goddamn it.

117
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,040
Man, there was nothing there.

118
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,100
There never was.

119
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,112
Well, we're really raising hell

120
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,410
with the jungle tonight,
aren't we?

121
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,278
What is it?

122
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,413
What the hell is it?

123
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,252
What is it?

124
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,587
Oh, dear God.

125
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,856
-Oh, God Almighty.
-You got to help me!

126
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,055
Let go of it for a minute!

127
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,063
I don't want to...

128
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,861
Black Eagle,
this is Devil 5-0-5.

129
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,525
I'm declaring emergency!

130
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,536
My bombardier's been hit.

131
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,265
I repeat:
my bombardier's been hit.

132
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,102
Requesting a ready deck
upon arrival!

133
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,108
I'll be on the bridge outside.

134
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,246
This is the enforcer.
Make a ready deck.

135
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,610
We have an emergency inbound.

136
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,446
5-0-5, switch to button three
for approach.

137
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,050
Uh, roger that.

138
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,519
Button three, Devil 5-0-5.

139
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,215
Gear is down.

140
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,515
I got to let go
just for a second.

141
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,582
Come on.
I can do it.

142
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,356
-Got to hang on.
-I'm okay, Jakey.

143
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,954
Hang in there, shipmate.

144
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:12,998
We're gonna make it.

145
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,862
-Now keep the faith.
-I'll make it.

146
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,337
No strain, partner.

147
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,403
5-0-5, call your ball,
call your ball.

148
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,033
200 ball, six point zero.

149
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,075
Ride your ball.

150
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,839
Working 22 knots.
You're high.

151
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:29,939
We're gonna make it.

152
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,074
Gotta hang in there.

153
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,708
Oh, geez.

154
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,116
Shit, he's still too high!

155
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,046
Jakey...

156
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,612
You're too high!

157
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,952
Morg!

158
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,686
Steady your line,
steady your line.

159
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,920
Come left, Jake.

160
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,258
I'm coming in.

161
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,698
He's too high!
Wave him off!

162
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,233
5-0-5, wave off! Wave off!

163
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,571
Tie 'em down!
Tie 'em down!

164
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,239
I told you we'd make it, Morg.

165
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,145
I told you we'd make it.

166
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,685
Everything's cool...

167
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,241
We made it, Morg.

168
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,014
I told you we'd make it.

169
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,349
I got him, sir, I got him.

170
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,719
Just let go, for Christ's sake.

171
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,255
Let go!

172
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,049
Let go of him, sir!

173
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:12,624
I got him!

174
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,158
Come on, goddamn it!

175
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,660
Let go of him,
for Christ's sake!

176
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,786
Let me out,
corpsman, come on!

177
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,558
I need some pressure in here!

178
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,996
Get him out of here, goddamn it!

179
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:20,862
Medic, come on!

180
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,161
Watch, watch the head.

181
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,259
Stand by!

182
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,736
Bring it in, bring it in,
bring it in! Move it!

183
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,568
Morg!

184
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,301
He's gone, man.

185
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,637
Come on, Jake.

186
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,802
Come on.

187
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,175
Oh, Jesus Christ, man.

188
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,647
It'll be all right, Jake.

189
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,481
It's going to be all right, man.

190
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,942
Jake, we don't want any more
of this if we can help it.

191
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,013
What altitude were you at
when McPherson got hit?

192
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,173
300, 500...
something like that.

193
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,013
I'd just taken a gun out
with a snake eye.

194
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,017
300 or 500?

195
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,348
It makes a difference.

196
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,287
I don't know.

197
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,448
I'm a little shaken up
right now.

198
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,513
You're what?

199
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,287
I said I'm shaken up, sir.

200
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,520
I got Morg's blood all over me.

201
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,223
Maybe we can stop the war

202
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,697
till things get better then.

203
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,393
Nobody asked you to stop
the war, did they?

204
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,165
Put McPherson's death
behind you, Mr. Grafton.

205
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,869
Right here, right now.

206
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,879
Yes, sir.

207
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,216
Now, what altitude
were you flying at?

208
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,246
Uh... 200.

209
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,519
200 maybe, AGL.

210
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,684
I pushed the nose over...

211
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:55,886
started a shallow...

212
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:59,021
dive in on the gun
and leveled out.

213
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,793
Some SAMs had tried us
when we'd come in,

214
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:05,234
and I wanted to... to get
out of there low and fast.

215
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,828
You came out
by a different route?

216
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,632
Yeah. Yes, sir.

217
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,108
About 30 miles, I guess.

218
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,610
Lucky small-arms fire.

219
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,610
Mmm.

220
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,611
All right.

221
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,307
Just bad luck, that's all.

222
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,646
Just ran out of luck.

223
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,686
Take Mr. Grafton
off the flight schedule.

224
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,747
You got liberty in Subic
in a couple days.

225
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,816
You need the rest.

226
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,057
What was your target?

227
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,458
A suspected truck park.

228
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,464
You hit it?

229
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,567
Oh, yeah, we hit it.

230
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,567
Trees.

231
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,796
A bunch of trees.

232
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,031
There was nothing there again.

233
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,038
What's your problem?

234
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:43,701
Spit it out.

235
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,514
Well, I don't think trees
in a suspected truck park

236
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,912
is worth a man's life.

237
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,016
Targets are picked for
political consideration,

238
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,247
Mr. Grafton,

239
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,085
with the best intelligence
we have available.

240
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,681
You have any trouble with that?

241
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,351
Well, I don't think losing Morg

242
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,327
is a political
consideration, sir.

243
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,863
Look...

244
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,902
I know losing
McPherson is lousy.

245
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,937
I don't like the targets,
either.

246
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,063
I hate them.

247
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,438
But... I don't want any
blood feuds going on.

248
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,306
Half the time,
it isn't the mission

249
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,436
you're flying
that kills you,

250
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,103
it's the one before--
do you read me?

251
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,647
Yes, sir.

252
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,083
Good.

253
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,587
I want you to write
a letter to Morg's wife.

254
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,418
I'll mail it in
a couple of days

255
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,787
along with one from me.

256
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,224
Help put this thing
behind you, okay?

257
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,394
Thanks, skipper.

258
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:40,830
For what?

259
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,768
You die, son, and
I'll piss on your grave.

260
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,979
Down here, down here.

261
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,317
Hey, Jake. Jake!

262
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,377
What the hell?

263
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,287
You're not thinking
about jumping are you?

264
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,324
No, not yet.

265
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,154
You need any help,
Mr. Grafton?

266
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,521
We thought you might want
to talk or something.

267
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,787
Oh, I'm fine.
Thanks, Chief.

268
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,089
So Jake, how'd you guys do?

269
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,994
I mean, you know,
before it happened.

270
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:13,997
Trees.

271
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:14,998
Yeah, trees?

272
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:15,999
Right.

273
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,092
-Again.
-Again?

274
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,569
Hey, Jack, you were
with a Marine detachment.

275
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,105
You ever
get used to it?

276
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,333
Yeah, I got used to it.

277
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,898
I'm a doc-- that's what I do.

278
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,102
Naw, nobody gets used to it.

279
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,338
You can put your job in front
of it like the skipper,

280
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,847
or you can even joke about it,
but nobody gets used to it.

281
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,643
That's right.

282
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:32,013
How about the old man?

283
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,109
Has he always been
like he is now?

284
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,653
When he chews you out?

285
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,847
Mm-hmm.

286
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,754
Maybe he figures he might not
get another chance.

287
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:40,917
Hey, guys, come on.

288
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,824
We got a squad room meeting,
okay, Jake?

289
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:44,726
All right, all right, all right.

290
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,059
I got all night, too.

291
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,635
I want to introduce
our new replacement pilot.

292
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,068
Mr. Barlow, up front.

293
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,732
Let's hear about your life.
Come on.

294
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,274
Yeah! Yeah!

295
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,810
Up front, up front,
up front, up front,

296
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,106
up front, up front,
up front...

297
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,144
All right.

298
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:02,475
All right, all right, shut up!

299
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,948
I'm Lieutenant J.G. Jack Barlow.

300
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,678
Sit down, asshole!

301
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:07,946
How old are you, son?

302
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:09,986
24, sir.

303
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,079
You look 12.

304
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,589
Did they teach you how to shave
at the Naval Academy?

305
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,455
I didn't think so.

306
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,051
Razor.

307
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,564
Ah, that's your new
name for now: Razor.

308
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,656
Excellent name, skipper.

309
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,665
Yeah!

310
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,031
All right, Walter.

311
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,296
Thank you.

312
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,296
All right, at, uh...

313
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,271
tomorrow at 1000
on the flight deck

314
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,901
there will be a memorial service
for McPherson.

315
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,810
The uniform is tropical,
white, long.

316
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,905
Oh, yeah, one other thing.

317
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,416
Uh, somebody close that door
back there, will you?

318
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,782
Frank?

319
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,748
Now, this matter
of the phantom shitter.

320
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,091
Now, I know it's a phenomenon

321
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,322
that occurs on a
carrier in combat

322
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,421
that goes back
to World War I l,

323
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,659
but this has gotten
out of hand.

324
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,066
Last night, the
phantom left a note

325
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,661
saying he would strike,

326
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:03,504
and this morning, a turd was
found in the XO's ashtray.

327
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,770
That only means
one thing, gentlemen.

328
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,214
It is no fighter jock
or recon puke

329
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,875
who is doing this thing.

330
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,317
It is an A-6 driver,

331
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,547
because no one else
on this ship

332
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,486
can hit the XO's ashtray.

333
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:19,581
Yeah!

334
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,624
Right, right, right.

335
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,627
Hup.

336
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,891
Someone,

337
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:30,265
in this room right here,

338
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,327
is the phantom shitter.

339
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:36,067
Now, it could be your roommate,
pilot, bombardier...

340
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:38,336
Think about it.

341
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,536
Movie officer.

342
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,544
Yes, sir.

343
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,273
What's the film for tonight?

344
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,508
Uh, They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?, sir.

345
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,709
It's Jane Fonda, sir.

346
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:46,716
Any skin?

347
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:47,717
No, sir.

348
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:48,684
Cancel it.

349
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,085
Yeah!

350
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,158
Dear Sharon,

351
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,063
By now you've been notified
that Morgan is gone.

352
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,863
He was killed over Vietnam
flying a night strike

353
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,497
and... I wish I could say
that his death was necessary,

354
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,131
but... it wasn't.

355
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,511
The target we were bombing
was nonexistent,

356
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,844
and the mission was useless.

357
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,216
Too many good men have died like
Morgan these past two years.

358
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,814
I guess I knew him as well
as any man could know another.

359
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,291
He was... he was my best friend.

360
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,353
I know how heavy a burden

361
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,658
his loss is to you
and little Bobby,

362
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,291
and... and I know
how much he loved you.

363
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,064
Somehow I wish
there was something,

364
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,571
just one thing I could do

365
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,665
to make up for such a loss
as Morgan.

366
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,710
I go on, as Tennyson said,

367
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,406
and the world darkens around me,

368
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,179
"among new men, strange faces"
and other minds.

369
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,152
You have my deepest
and most sincere sympathy.

370
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,313
Jake.

371
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,090
Real sorry about Mr. McPherson,
sir.

372
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:37,989
What's this?

373
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,093
Thought he was single.

374
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,397
He was.

375
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,336
He was four days ago.

376
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,031
You know this girl, Chief?

377
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,973
Yeah, she's a looker.

378
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:56,071
Probably first piece of ass
he's ever had.

379
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,013
When did you get married, son?

380
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,551
Last time in port, sir.

381
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,280
You know you got to have
Navy permission

382
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,515
to marry a foreign national?

383
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,285
Your folks know?

384
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,690
No, sir.

385
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,524
Do you love her?

386
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,190
Well, yes, sir,
of course I do, sir.

387
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,233
I-I got a picture of
her here in my wallet.

388
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,824
No, that's all right.
It's all right.

389
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,797
You violated a major
regulation, Hardesty,

390
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,864
but I'm going to sign
your chit.

391
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,700
You realize that you're legally

392
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,541
and morally obligated
to this girl.

393
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:28,739
Do you know that?

394
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,111
Yes, sir.

395
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,706
Do you understand
what that means?

396
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:32,842
You got to support her.

397
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:33,976
Yes, sir.

398
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,253
This aircraft
has not been cleaned!

399
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,956
Why hasn't this aircraft
been cleaned?

400
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,499
I'll clean it myself, sir.

401
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,966
I'll see that it's done.

402
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,026
You do that,
you get it done!

403
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,071
Get it clean!

404
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,902
Sorry, sir, l...

405
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,343
No, don't explain, son,
just get it done.

406
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,074
Mr. Grafton won't hold it
against you.

407
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,648
He's just upset.

408
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,183
It's just that nobody's ever

409
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,877
come back dead like that, sir.

410
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:08,975
Whole ship knows about it.

411
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,020
A lot of them come down

412
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,420
just to take a look
at it, but...

413
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,117
I don't know why we
didn't clean it, sir.

414
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,691
When people die,
they're just gone.

415
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,522
But not like this, sir.

416
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,561
All right, all right.

417
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,289
That's all right, son,
that's all right.

418
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,006
This is the enforcer.

419
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,509
Stand by to recover the call.

420
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,128
Mr. Cole!
How you doing?

421
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,130
I'm Chief Poole.
You come this way.

422
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,824
Commander Camparelli
is waiting for you

423
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,832
down in the ready room.

424
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:56,833
Hold on, Chief.

425
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:57,869
All right, sir.

426
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,565
I want to smell it.

427
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,271
I've been away for a while.

428
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,547
I'm ready.

429
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:11,583
All right, sir.

430
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,782
Mr. Cole.

431
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,216
Have a seat.

432
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,759
I'm fine, sir.

433
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,899
Uh...

434
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,707
I was on the Coral Sea,
when you were on the Ranger.

435
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,934
Is that so?

436
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,274
Knew a lot of guys
in VA-35.

437
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,813
Knew Jim Becker.

438
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,210
Flew A-4s with him.

439
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,716
You went down with him,
didn't you?

440
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,684
That's right, sir.

441
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,048
And he didn't make it.

442
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,750
No, sir, he didn't.

443
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,825
I know the whole story.

444
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,957
Before and after.

445
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,025
I know a lot about you.

446
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,627
Well, I'm glad, sir,

447
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,536
because I know a lot
about you, too.

448
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:12,042
Everybody in the Navy
knows about you, sir.

449
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,543
Yeah?

450
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,772
What about me?

451
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,346
That you're a legend, sir.

452
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,510
Then that makes two of us.

453
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:23,453
And sometimes that can
be a bad influence on others.

454
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,514
I'll try and fit in, sir.

455
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,184
That's my job.

456
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,194
Make sure you do that.

457
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,195
Good evening, Mr. Cole.

458
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,891
We'll have to try
Sector A tomorrow.

459
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,933
Finding out now...

460
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,037
Mr. Grafton.

461
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,595
I'm sorry about
Mr. McPherson, sir.

462
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:43,873
Is, uh, Guffy around?

463
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:44,874
You seen him?

464
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:45,875
Uh, yes, sir.

465
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,275
He's... he's right there.

466
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,384
You wanted to see me, Guffy?

467
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,578
Yeah, just a minute.

468
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,157
Let me ask you something, Guffy.

469
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:06,493
You suppose there's anything...
anything valuable here?

470
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,762
If they had something,
it'd be up north, wouldn't it?

471
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,235
That's right, Mr. Grafton.

472
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,794
You see this?

473
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,430
This is Haiphong Harbor.

474
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,668
It's loaded with munitions.

475
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,075
They take 'em out of here,

476
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,976
and they stick 'em here,
in Hanoi.

477
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,344
But it's not for you,
it's restricted.

478
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,849
They didn't do it in '65,

479
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,010
we haven't flown
over it since '69,

480
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,815
so don't even think about it.

481
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,321
But I do have something here

482
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,914
that's gonna
brighten your day.

483
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,493
You know that strike you flew in
the south last week?

484
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,257
Yeah, we refueled at Da Nang.

485
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,262
That one?

486
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,389
Yeah.

487
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,831
Army bomb damage assessment
says you killed 37.

488
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,630
That's some body count,
eh, buddy?

489
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,706
You think I want
to know that, huh?

490
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,241
If you did what I did,
would you want to know?

491
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,301
No, for all you know,
those people were farmers.

492
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,436
You get that information,

493
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,980
you keep it to yourself,
all right?

494
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,276
I don't want to know about it.

495
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,441
Just keep it to yourself.

496
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:04,415
Do you even know who I am?

497
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,615
Yes, sir, I do, sir!

498
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,057
You're Commander Camparelli,
sir, the C.O.!

499
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,957
What kind of name
is Camparelli?!

500
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,855
It is an ltalian-
American name.

501
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,490
Have you ever met a black man
with a name like that?

502
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,728
No, you haven't.

503
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,135
I got that name

504
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,366
because somewhere in my past
there was a wop

505
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,999
in the woodpile.

506
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,237
Do I detect a smile

507
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,337
on your disgusting face,
Lieutenant Razor?

508
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,712
I thought not.

509
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:36,584
So it turns out that my family
are third-generation Mafia.

510
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,350
They were forced to make
a living in gambling,

511
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,893
extortion and murder,
so that their boy

512
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,655
could fly a jet aircraft
for the U.S. Navy.

513
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,493
So I take what I do serious.

514
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,192
Do you understand me, son?

515
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,234
Yes, sir, I do, sir.

516
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,735
Then get out of my sight.

517
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,772
Lieutenant Razor, dismissed!

518
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,906
Ah-- don't laugh.

519
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,412
He's your new wingman.

520
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,449
Just take one.

521
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,917
I'll hand it to you.

522
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:10,916
That's the one
I want you to have.

523
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:18,086
There's a pair of A-6s
going to Subic tomorrow.

524
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,688
I want you take one
with the doc.

525
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:24,532
I'll put Grafton and maybe
Boxman in the other one.

526
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,901
As soon as you get
Jake off the deck,

527
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,031
you fly him dizzy,
get him drunk,

528
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,372
anything to wind him down
before he goes up in flames.

529
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,409
Yeah...

530
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:39,510
All that guy needs is a...

531
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,949
strike on the match.

532
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,313
All right, now listen, Doc.

533
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,321
Don't touch anything.

534
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,357
Keep your hands in your lap.

535
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,357
Absolutely.

536
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,859
The only exception
is if you have to eject.

537
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,858
Eject?

538
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,258
Now, you got a yellow
and black handle

539
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,387
here and one here--
you pull it.

540
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:53,930
The command will be
"eject, eject, eject."

541
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:54,862
Three times, you got it?

542
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:55,865
Yes, "eject, eject, eject."

543
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,165
Do I say roger or...
just do it or what?

544
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,695
You even say "huh," you'll
be talking to yourself...

545
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,332
'cause I'll be gone.

546
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:07,839
Jake!

547
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,788
Give me 15 degrees lift.

548
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:27,730
We should make Luzon
in about 15 minutes.

549
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,131
You're getting pretty good
at this, aren't you?

550
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,191
I watch my BN a lot.

551
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,702
I sort of picked it up.

552
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,102
If I'm wrong, I don't know...

553
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,104
China.

554
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,902
What do you think?

555
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,636
Huh?

556
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:39,801
Swell.

557
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,742
That's good food man, good food.

558
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,781
You're my favorite pilot, Jake.

559
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:47,944
Did you know that?

560
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,010
I thought you were
your favorite pilot.

561
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,386
Hey, Sammy, how you doing
out there, man?

562
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,723
You enjoying yourself?
How's the doc?

563
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:58,854
I think Mad Jack's asleep.

564
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,760
No, I'm not.

565
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,197
Hey, follow the leader.

566
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,029
What do you think, huh?

567
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:03,930
How much?

568
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:04,660
Talk to the man.

569
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:05,667
Oh, I don't know.

570
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,830
What do you say,
five bucks, hard cash?

571
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,930
Oh, you're on, Cool Hand.

572
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,770
This is going to be
the most exciting thing

573
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,741
you've ever done
with your clothes on, Doc.

574
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,040
Oh, Jesus.

575
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,471
Oh, no.

576
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:48,673
Come on, Jake.

577
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,339
You can do better than this.

578
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,110
Now, I'm gonna have some fun.

579
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,172
Whoo!

580
00:25:58,356 --> 00:25:59,288
Come on, Jake.

581
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:00,654
Doc's falling asleep here.

582
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,454
I'm getting a little
embarrassed.

583
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,755
Sammy, you're a dick!

584
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,166
Whoo! You can fly a plane, Jake!

585
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,401
Hey, Cool Hand.

586
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,810
Where are you guys?

587
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,348
Yee-hoo!

588
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,588
Here, Doc, take some oxygen.

589
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:33,316
You'll feel better...

590
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,323
Keep both hands on the wheel!

591
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,354
It's not funny!

592
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,589
Woo, yeah.

593
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,829
We're having some fun now,
aren't we, Morg?

594
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,132
It's not Morg, Cool Hand, okay?

595
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,807
It's me.

596
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,212
You take it easy?

597
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,408
You okay, huh?

598
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:00,280
Where are you guys?

599
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,183
That's all you get
for five dollars, okay, man?

600
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:17,435
We're gonna bring it in.

601
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,130
But are the girls clean?

602
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,138
Clean?

603
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,539
You afraid of a few bugs, son?

604
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,577
You afraid of disease?

605
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:30,079
What kind of aviator are you,
Razor, huh?

606
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,615
Well, who's on for Po City?

607
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,015
Checklist, yeah,
preflight, kid.

608
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,017
Money.

609
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,075
Yeah, yeah, I'm cool.

610
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,086
Prophylactics.

611
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,213
I've got two.

612
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,221
Oh, yeah?

613
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,552
I always carry 26, myself.

614
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,728
That's not a joke.

615
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,395
No shit, Razor.

616
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,667
It is the biggest cathouse
east of Port Said, man.

617
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,731
Whole town is dedicated.

618
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,036
Know what I mean?

619
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,078
You coming, Jake?

620
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,512
Cold beer, hot women...

621
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,118
Put the war in perspective.

622
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,553
Tell you what.

623
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,454
I think I'm going to
catch you guys later.

624
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,083
I've got something
to take care of.

625
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,121
Perspective.

626
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,526
Yeah.

627
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,145
Mr. Lieutenant?

628
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,723
Oh.

629
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,559
Excuse me.
Thank you.

630
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,395
I was looking
for Mrs. McPherson.

631
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,495
Sharon's gone.

632
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,472
Her husband was killed.

633
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,675
I know.

634
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,474
You're here on a duty call.

635
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,511
They send you here
to stroke the widow?

636
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,353
Who are you?

637
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,755
Callie Troy.

638
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,156
I'm helping pack their stuff.

639
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,258
The Navy pays me to help people
like Sharon.

640
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,892
What can I tell you,
Mr. Lieutenant?

641
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,163
They were here,
but now they're gone.

642
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,501
Like a lot people these days.

643
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,074
When you get in your airplane
and fly away alone,

644
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,642
sometimes you don't come back.

645
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,711
He wasn't alone.

646
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,541
And he did come back.

647
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,682
I was with him.

648
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:10,063
Commander Cole here
decided to join our posse, Jake.

649
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,338
This is Lieutenant
Jake Grafton--

650
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:15,344
"Cool Hand."

651
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,347
Glad to meet you, Jake.

652
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,282
How do you want
to be called, Commander?

653
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,081
Cole. Virgil Cole.

654
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,388
It's his third tour, man.

655
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,788
He really knows his shit.

656
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,327
You got the DFC and
the Silver Star, don't you?

657
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,793
Does it matter?

658
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,888
Hell, no, it doesn't matter,
Cole, Virgil Cole.

659
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,099
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.

660
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,803
Put on your wings, Jake.

661
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,368
You want to relax?

662
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,209
Hey, Jake!

663
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,942
Let's relax.

664
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,948
Ain't it great
to be home, Jake?

665
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,883
Some things
never change, right?

666
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,751
Thanks, Joe.
Hope you don't get the clap.

667
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,416
Give this man another beer
immediately.

668
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,982
Boxman, Boxman!
How are you?

669
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,858
Hey! All right!

670
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,419
When'd you get back?

671
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:08,590
Hey, Carrie, how's the baby?!

672
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,497
Looks just like you!

673
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:12,725
Carmen...

674
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,271
You didn't think

675
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,670
I was coming back, did you?

676
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,606
April, oh, my goodness,
you sweet thing.

677
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:21,304
You've been working
out, I can tell.

678
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,812
Come up here.

679
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,905
Some of them
are real dogs, Boxman.

680
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,278
They're all beautiful

681
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,184
after being with you chumps
for 57 days, right?

682
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,157
...gonna buy my baby
a diamond ring...

683
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,160
If that diamond ring
don't shine...

684
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,207
Get a fighter pilot to do it!

685
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,040
Are you a fighter pilot?

686
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,911
Don't ask a man
if he's a fighter pilot.

687
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,041
If he is,
he'll let you know.

688
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,211
If he isn't,
don't embarrass him.

689
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,183
Asshole...

690
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,852
Fighter-pukes make movies.

691
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,087
Yeah.

692
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,596
Bomber pilots make history.

693
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,530
Prove it, asshole.

694
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,748
Nice carrier landing!

695
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:08,752
I don't hear
your engines running!

696
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,219
And I don't see
your salute!

697
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,990
Launch the Intruder!.

698
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,736
Yeah! Yeah!

699
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,439
Bo Diddly, Bo Diddly,
have you heard?

700
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,842
How you doing?

701
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,415
Hey, flyboy...

702
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:42,283
I think you were lucky
and I lost money.

703
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,218
Do it again, boy.

704
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,550
You boys got a problem?

705
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:46,590
What's it to you?

706
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,056
What's it to you, nigger?

707
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,753
Hey, watch your mouth, mister.

708
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,089
You gonna stop me?

709
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,865
I got to go, man.

710
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,600
If the house is a-rockin',
don't bother knockin'

711
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:04,868
If the house is a-rockin'

712
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,136
Don't bother knockin'

713
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,307
If the house is a-rockin',
don't bother, come on in...

714
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,940
Watch out, Razor!

715
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,780
Nature calls.

716
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,027
Now, repeat after me.

717
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,656
Say, "Black is beautiful."

718
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,873
Hey, Jake, this place
is a drag, man, huh?

719
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,173
Let's go, come on.

720
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:51,987
Come on.

721
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,522
You get my hat?

722
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:55,557
I don't know.

723
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:56,593
I don't know!

724
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,288
I'm gonna throw you in, anyway.

725
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:05,631
Mess call!

726
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,598
Mess call!

727
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,403
Got room in here for a six pack
and a pizza?

728
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,210
Sure, sailor, okay.

729
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:26,956
Aw, man!

730
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:30,193
Shit.

731
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,785
I'm in shit, Morg.

732
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,761
Hey, Jake, hey, man.

733
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,924
It's the Boxman, okay?

734
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,398
Come on, Jake, come on.

735
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,232
If the house is a-rockin',
don't bother knockin'...

736
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,202
Come on, man!
Come on!

737
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,273
Oh, shore patrol!

738
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,542
Saved, man.

739
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,278
We're saved, Jake.

740
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,513
Emergency egress, gentlemen.

741
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,681
Cole, Virgil Cole,
let's go, man.

742
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,234
Hey, Box...

743
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:21,244
I, uh...

744
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,143
appreciate you getting me
out of there, man.

745
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,340
I know, l...

746
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:27,043
Hey, Jake, put it
down, man, okay?

747
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,245
Morg's gone.

748
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,582
Let him go.

749
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:33,755
Okay?

750
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,020
Have some coffee.

751
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:39,960
You going back?

752
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,293
Hey, my wingman Razor's

753
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,993
still out there... alone,
you know?

754
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,599
Hey...

755
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,435
Adios, compadre.

756
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:51,141
Thanks.

757
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,142
Cole.

758
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,235
Uh, hold on, Box.

759
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:01,877
You'll be all right,

760
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,419
Mr. Grafton.

761
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,557
I'm tactical.

762
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:32,112
I know this is foolish of me...

763
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,983
but I'm a little tipsy
and l, um...

764
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,453
I made a fool of myself earlier.

765
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,454
I... I was a real...

766
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,753
Slow down, slow down.

767
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,828
And I guess I owe you one.

768
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,295
Owe me one?

769
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,465
Yeah, l...

770
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:51,865
want to make it right by you.

771
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,096
What can I do?

772
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:01,009
Uh... okay.

773
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,479
Um... dance?

774
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,617
All right.

775
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,486
I want to jump, but
I'm afraid I'll fall

776
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,720
I want to holler,
but the joint's too small...

777
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,489
I make up
all my own moves!

778
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,895
Seems like it.

779
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:27,097
I got the rockin' pneumonia
and the boogie-woogie blues...

780
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:29,332
Yeah, I learned this
when I was a hippie!

781
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:35,346
I want to kiss her,
but she's way too tall

782
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:39,144
Young man rhythm's
got ahold of me, too

783
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,774
I got the rockin' pneumonia...

784
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:53,989
Tonight you're mine,
completely

785
00:38:54,065 --> 00:39:02,996
You give your love so sweetly

786
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:14,975
Tonight, the light of love
is in your eyes

787
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:24,552
Will you still love me tomorrow?

788
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,858
Tomorrow...

789
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,454
Thank you.

790
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:02,394
Is, uh...

791
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:03,865
is that your daughter?

792
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,266
It's all right.

793
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,105
Where's her father?

794
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:11,869
He's scattered all over
North Vietnam.

795
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:18,012
He went out one day alone,
and the SAMs got him.

796
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,242
Since no one was with him

797
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,218
and his body
was never found,

798
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,051
they have him listed as MlA.

799
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,221
Of course, it isn't true.

800
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,093
You knew I was a pilot.

801
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,165
I married a pilot.

802
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,259
Didn't it make
you remember?

803
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,498
Maybe I wanted to remember.

804
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,484
Hardesty...

805
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,459
How's your wife?

806
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,291
She's fine.
She's fine, sir.

807
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,661
Really appreciate everything
you done for me, sir.

808
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,994
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Grafton.

809
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,831
Got a beautiful child, sir,

810
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,098
beautiful wife,
beautiful family.

811
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,299
Want to thank you again
for everything you done.

812
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,638
It's no trouble, Hardesty,
no trouble.

813
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,610
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Grafton.

814
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,380
"Beautiful family."

815
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,718
Callie, I know we don't want

816
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,725
to complicate things

817
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,989
any more than
we have to, but l...

818
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,530
I'd like to write to you,
if that'd be all right?

819
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,434
I'd like that.

820
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,005
It would be fine.

821
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,766
I'd like it very much.

822
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,863
Have you always been
this stupid?!

823
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,991
How did a person like you,
as stupid as you are,

824
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,091
become an aviator?!

825
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,430
Can you read?!

826
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,663
Are you that illiterate?!

827
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,535
This is no kindergarten!

828
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,006
This is no, no preschool!

829
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,702
Grafton!

830
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:28,267
Get in here.

831
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,472
You were part of this, too.

832
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,874
Sit down, both of you.

833
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:38,485
Now what's this crap

834
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,524
about you attempting
to feed a merchant seaman

835
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:41,523
to some alligators?

836
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,583
They were crocodiles, sir.

837
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,754
I don't give a damn.

838
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,057
Now go on.

839
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:48,325
Well, I attempted to throw

840
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,957
the aforementioned puke
to the crocodiles, sir,

841
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,400
when his belt caught on
the railing and I failed.

842
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,198
An altercation
then ensued, sir.

843
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,203
700 bucks damage,

844
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:56,762
30 men in the brig

845
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,807
and an alligator injured...

846
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,740
and you got away.

847
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,507
Using escape and evasion
techniques, sir,

848
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,776
I was able to avoid
being captured and, sir,

849
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,043
we didn't hurt that crocodile.

850
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,084
He was fine when we left.

851
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:09,244
Yeah, he was okay, skipper.

852
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:17,090
Damn it, stand up!

853
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,254
Who gave you permission
to sit down?

854
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:22,497
Who was with you?

855
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,624
I'd rather not say, sir.

856
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,668
That's the same thing he said.

857
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:28,699
Mr. Cole.

858
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,070
I couldn't help but overhear
the conversation,

859
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,109
and I thought
I might add something, sir.

860
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,667
Then go ahead, mister.

861
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:40,111
These men were victimized, sir.

862
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,276
"Victimized"?

863
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,979
Exactly, sir,
they were victimized.

864
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,351
We were lucky to escape.
I saw the whole thing.

865
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,014
Yes...

866
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,922
And I'm sure you'd let me know

867
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,994
if these gentlemen
were at fault.

868
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,120
That's affirmative, sir.

869
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:56,126
That'll be all, Mr. Cole.

870
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,167
Yes, sir.

871
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,163
All right.

872
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,767
All right,
I'll cover your asses--

873
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,573
both of you.

874
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,238
Because you told the truth,

875
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,679
and kept the faith.

876
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,013
But if I catch
either one of you

877
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:16,985
shitting in some
vital area on my ship,

878
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,851
you'll be keelhauled--

879
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:21,356
and that's serious
on an aircraft carrier.

880
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,583
Get out of here, Cool Hand.

881
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,788
Yes, sir.

882
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:32,601
As for you, Razor...

883
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,401
running with known
psychopaths now, huh?

884
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:37,531
Who am l, Razor?

885
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:40,076
You're third-generation
Mafia, sir.

886
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,508
Wrong!

887
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:42,738
You rodent.

888
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:44,107
I was built with this ship.

889
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,945
I am a weapons system,
and there was a cost overrun!

890
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,450
Dismissed!

891
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:56,381
Come on in.

892
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,859
Commander Cole.

893
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,589
Mr. Grafton.

894
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,756
Have you recovered yet?

895
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,632
Oh, yeah.

896
00:45:05,736 --> 00:45:07,203
Uh, I saw the duty
roster out here,

897
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:08,465
and they've got us paired up.

898
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,268
Looks like you're
going to be my new BN.

899
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,001
I thought we may have
a chance to visit

900
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,168
for a minute.

901
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,609
What do you got on your mind?

902
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,112
Well, actually, sir,

903
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:20,275
I got the word that
this is your third tour,

904
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,818
and I was... I was curious.

905
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:25,218
What makes a man come back
for the third time?

906
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,321
I like to fight.

907
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,225
Have you had a lot of pilots?

908
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,923
Oh, four or five.

909
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,897
I'm kind of hard on pilots.

910
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:45,001
Have, uh...

911
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,804
you ever been up north?

912
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,037
Sure.

913
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:51,604
In the old days,
that's where the war was.

914
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:53,910
Boy, I bet... I bet
there was something up there

915
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,544
that really made the trip
worthwhile back then, huh?

916
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,748
I mean, I figure a guy like you
ought to know, huh?

917
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,985
There was a lot up there
worth it.

918
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,425
You know that.

919
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,796
SAMs are the scene here, man.

920
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:12,632
SAM sites are the most righteous
targets we got.

921
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,328
You ever fly lronhand?

922
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,370
No.

923
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,770
No, no.

924
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,273
No, not me.

925
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,436
I... I don't let them shoot
rockets at me for sport.

926
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,174
You get to kill them.

927
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,910
It's gratifying.

928
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,612
Yeah, but I bet
it's not as gratifying

929
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,586
as what was up north, huh?

930
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,318
I get your drift.

931
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:41,930
Don't even think about it.

932
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,340
Well, I just know

933
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:53,638
it's going to be a pleasure
to fly with you, Mr. Cole.

934
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:00,981
Hot dog.

935
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,318
Well, today's your lucky day.

936
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,983
The only A-6B qualified crew,
Jackson and Greeves,

937
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,754
were scrubbed because
they didn't have a day trap.

938
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,560
So your BN volunteered you
for SAM suppression.

939
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:16,758
Ever pull lronhand duty?

940
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,766
You fly the B?

941
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:18,802
No.

942
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:19,801
Wait a minute.

943
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:20,894
I'm not B qualified.

944
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,438
I've never even sat
in the damn thing.

945
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,669
Well, it's a good thing
Mr. Cole has.

946
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:28,370
Besides, you're all we got.

947
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,187
Whoa.

948
00:47:40,591 --> 00:47:42,183
Do you know something
I don't know?

949
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,817
Maybe.

950
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,590
Maybe not.

951
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,097
Look, just relax.

952
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,633
I'll talk you through it.

953
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,726
I used to be an
instructor on the B.

954
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,201
The only difference is

955
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,069
a couple of black boxes,
and they're all mine.

956
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:01,611
So just... follow steering
and flow with it.

957
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,375
You see, lronhand's my thing.

958
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:18,786
It's simple.

959
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,625
We're the decoys.

960
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,894
We get them to turn their radar
on and shoot at us.

961
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:26,026
But then again,
we get to shoot back

962
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:28,036
and kill them
with our missiles.

963
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,700
That way, the bombers can have
a pleasant SAM-free evening

964
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,242
dropping their bombs.

965
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,371
When you shoot the shrike,
just remember not to look at it.

966
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:38,379
It'll blind you.

967
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:41,508
Otherwise, it's a simple deal.

968
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:45,715
When the SAM's radar goes on,
that's your target. You shoot.

969
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,121
They either have to shut off
and lose the missile

970
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,158
or eat the shrike.

971
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,921
Even if they do shut off,

972
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:54,361
sometimes the shrike remembers
where they're at.

973
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:56,964
Mean bastards, eh?

974
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,430
You know something?

975
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:03,234
I think that's the most I've
ever heard you say at one time.

976
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,104
Oh...

977
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:06,642
Look, man.

978
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,245
I hate SAMs.

979
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,941
I get all worked up
just thinking about them.

980
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:17,282
When I tell you to do something,
just make sure you do it.

981
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,422
Well...

982
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,992
I can tell this is going to be
a real love affair.

983
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,254
Break left.

984
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,293
All right, that's enough.

985
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,234
That's enough.

986
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,566
Just checking.

987
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,472
Devil 5-2-0, feet dry.

988
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:46,276
Roger, 5-2-0.

989
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,214
We copy, feet dry.

990
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:48,649
Good hunting, Cool Hand.

991
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,449
Let's let them know we're here.

992
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,318
Put your mask on,
it's going to be a gunfight.

993
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,429
Man, we've been made.

994
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,560
Give me 1 5 degrees, nose up.

995
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,237
A SAM just lifted off-- 1 :00.

996
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,305
Oh, Jesus,
there's another one!

997
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,783
It's not any fun until
they send up three at once.

998
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,013
Then we give the Gomers
our first rocket

999
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,247
while you dive under.

1000
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:26,721
Oh, I do, do l?

1001
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,451
Where do you get all this
confidence in my ability?

1002
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,458
Now that's four.

1003
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:35,496
Are you happy now?

1004
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:36,554
Aim at the strobe.

1005
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:37,997
Come on, come on.

1006
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,467
They're going into high PRM.

1007
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,197
Just a second.

1008
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,140
Shoot, shoot.

1009
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,473
Spread out, spread out left.

1010
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,704
I told you not to look.

1011
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,770
Hang a left and hit
the shaft, goddamn it.

1012
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,057
Two more dead ahead.

1013
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,922
Down.

1014
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:02,924
Get your nose down!

1015
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,295
Just another
flight-controlled radar.

1016
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,527
Bullshit.

1017
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:12,761
Look at that thread direction.

1018
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,360
It's coming up behind us.

1019
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:15,268
Maybe a conical missile scan.

1020
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,270
That's no missile scan;

1021
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,169
that's a MiG, baby.

1022
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,705
Black Eagle,
this is Devil 5-2-0.

1023
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,075
We got a bandit
crawling up our ass.

1024
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,011
Get those F4s over here.

1025
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,014
Expedite!

1026
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,641
And I do mean expedite.

1027
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,877
Now, let's get out of here.

1028
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,157
Give me 20 degrees, nose up.

1029
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,557
What are you, crazy, man?

1030
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:39,492
That's a MiG.
We don't even have a gun.

1031
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,588
No, but we got a shrike,
and that'll take care

1032
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:43,656
of the radar site
that's guiding the sucker.

1033
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:44,859
Come on, you crazy bastard.

1034
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,559
Goddamn it, I'm going to shoot
before he gets it.

1035
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:47,728
Not yet, not yet.

1036
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:53,534
That's it.

1037
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,439
Right there.

1038
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:55,102
Close your eyes.

1039
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:55,940
Shoot.

1040
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,683
Righteous.

1041
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,751
Drop your flares
and cut your heat signature.

1042
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:12,152
Hard right.

1043
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:23,764
Oh, God.

1044
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,670
We got a flame out.

1045
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:25,435
Engines just shut down.

1046
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,603
We got to get power
for a restart.

1047
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,286
Emergency generator on.

1048
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,551
Okay, throttle up.

1049
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,521
Here goes nothing.

1050
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,286
A thousand feet and dropping.

1051
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,189
You're decelerating.

1052
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:47,696
Come on, come on.

1053
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:48,594
Air speed 200 knots.

1054
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,461
We're going to drop

1055
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:50,397
Iike a rock at 180.

1056
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:51,900
Well, then why don't you eject?

1057
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,026
Screw it.
I came along for the ride.

1058
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,799
Come on, you sucker, light up.

1059
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,635
300.

1060
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,174
Come on, baby.

1061
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,937
250... 200.

1062
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,376
Things are coming alive.

1063
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,140
Yeah, we got restart.

1064
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:20,658
Yeah, you beautiful, wonderful
little aerodynamic wonder, you.

1065
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,459
Yeah!

1066
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,193
Whoo! Flow with it, yeah!

1067
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:27,703
This is X-Ray 201 and 2.

1068
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,500
We have your bandit in tow.

1069
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,165
He's ours, gentlemen.

1070
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,037
Cavalry's on its way.

1071
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:39,715
I've had enough fun.

1072
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,683
Let's go home.

1073
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,529
Wash the windows,
check the oil.

1074
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,122
Hey, what happened
to you guys?

1075
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,032
A couple of minutes back there
you didn't answer my calls.

1076
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,070
Oh, that.

1077
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,661
We had a MiG after us.

1078
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:05,332
We did an engine shutdown
to throw him off.

1079
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:07,672
In the middle of combat?

1080
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,609
Whew.

1081
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:11,578
Cool move.

1082
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:12,979
Cool as a jewel.

1083
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,447
That's bullshit.

1084
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,147
I pulled back on the throttles
too much.

1085
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,985
That was a major screw-up,
and you know it.

1086
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:22,524
Well, don't worry.

1087
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,856
It won't affect my decision.

1088
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,418
Your what?

1089
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:29,862
If you were a candy ass,
I'd ask for a new pilot,

1090
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,298
but I figure you'll do.

1091
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,076
Hey, Jake.

1092
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:44,113
Hey, man.

1093
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,112
Hey.

1094
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,910
What you doing up here?

1095
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:48,848
Ah, it's a good place to think.

1096
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:49,816
Oh, yeah?

1097
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:50,614
Me, too, huh.

1098
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,449
I like the noise.

1099
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:53,544
It's good, it's good.

1100
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,557
What do you got there, Box?

1101
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,751
Um...

1102
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,818
It's just some mail,
you know, outgoing.

1103
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,193
Is that all yours?

1104
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,322
Well, yeah.

1105
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,264
I got a lot of people
to write to, man.

1106
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,325
This is only Post City,
actually.

1107
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:07,802
These are my favorites.

1108
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:08,997
These I like, too.

1109
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:10,300
Now, wait a minute.

1110
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,534
You had time for this
and for evaluation?

1111
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,167
I got a lot
of responsibilities, man,

1112
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,337
you know?

1113
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,505
I'm a...

1114
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:19,741
I'm a patriarch.

1115
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:21,983
No, really.

1116
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:22,984
A patriarch.

1117
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,020
Yeah.

1118
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,678
Want to hear something?

1119
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,017
What do you got?

1120
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,557
Hold on.

1121
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,524
Wait till you hear this.

1122
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:34,688
It's something else.

1123
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:35,856
Listen to this.

1124
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:36,921
Ready?

1125
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,696
Yeah.

1126
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,041
You hear that?

1127
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,474
"Daddy."

1128
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:49,637
No, no, no.

1129
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:52,807
He said "daddy," man.
That's my son.

1130
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,747
That's my son.
It's beautiful, huh?

1131
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,285
That's your son?

1132
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,752
How'd you know?

1133
00:55:57,821 --> 00:55:59,948
I don't know, and I don't
give a shit either.

1134
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,022
He can be my son
if he wants to be.

1135
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:04,185
Why not?
Sure he can. Yes.

1136
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,693
Right? I mean,
she wants him to be.

1137
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:06,854
So do l.

1138
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,522
I mean, that's what's
important, right?

1139
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,189
That's right,
that's what's important.

1140
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,858
Right. Right.

1141
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,060
What's she like?

1142
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:14,796
She's butt ugly.

1143
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:15,860
I mean, she's ugly,

1144
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,668
but she's got a great body, man.

1145
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,368
Well, you know...

1146
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,374
You know, Jake,

1147
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:21,967
I think I could love
an ugly woman.

1148
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,444
I mean, you can trust her more.

1149
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:24,445
The pretty ones...

1150
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:26,038
they only care about
themselves, right?

1151
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,174
Yeah.

1152
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,182
Right? I mean,
you know what I mean.

1153
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,183
Yeah, sure.

1154
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:31,152
That's nice.

1155
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:33,349
Yeah?

1156
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:34,445
Yeah.

1157
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,252
Thanks a lot, Jake.

1158
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,293
Yeah. Thanks a lot, man.

1159
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:39,293
All right.

1160
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,386
I'll see you around.

1161
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,260
All right.

1162
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,375
Mr. Grafton.

1163
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,211
You wouldn't happen
to have anything

1164
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:07,380
on North Vietnam, would you?

1165
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:08,822
Like what?

1166
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,792
Oh, I don't know.

1167
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,125
Anything with...
maybe some maps?

1168
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,568
Try this Geographic.

1169
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:21,363
The map's in the back.

1170
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,370
Keep it quiet.

1171
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,805
It's not supposed to circulate.

1172
00:57:24,874 --> 00:57:27,240
All right. Thanks.

1173
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,653
You want to bomb Hanoi.

1174
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,958
You realize I could have you
court-martialed

1175
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,691
for even making the suggestion.

1176
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:50,096
That's right.

1177
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,565
You took a big risk.

1178
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:52,396
Yes, I did.

1179
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,000
Why do you want to do this?

1180
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:58,938
I think you know why.

1181
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:02,444
There's guys like Morgan...

1182
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:07,245
they're dying every day,
every single day.

1183
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,306
This war...

1184
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,545
This war's not going to end.

1185
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,018
You think it would matter?

1186
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,282
One plane?

1187
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,584
Yes, I do.

1188
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:15,817
It would matter to me.

1189
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,484
I think it would matter to Morg.

1190
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:20,755
It'd matter to all the other
guys that had gotten bagged.

1191
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,424
It would matter to you,
and you know it.

1192
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,263
So, you think putting
a couple of snake eyes

1193
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,326
in the middle of party
headquarters is the answer?

1194
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,927
Well, I don't know
if it's the answer,

1195
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,267
but I'll tell you what.

1196
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,205
It's going to get their
attention, isn't it?

1197
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,108
You'd be going
right downtown.

1198
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,475
It'd be no piece of cake.

1199
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,174
Yeah, but it would be worth it.

1200
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:42,116
And this time it's not going
to be a bunch of trees.

1201
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,153
It's not going to be
a road junction.

1202
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,620
It's going to be a
mission, a real mission.

1203
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,050
You think it would change
anything at the peace table?

1204
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,028
I don't know.

1205
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:55,064
It might.

1206
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,566
No dice.

1207
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:00,226
I've been in this war
too long

1208
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:02,429
to listen to this
idealistic bullshit.

1209
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,301
Ah...

1210
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,431
Let me tell you, friend,

1211
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,634
there's nothing up there
worth dying for.

1212
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,643
No, let me tell you something.

1213
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,838
You risk your life.

1214
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:13,849
You risk your life every
mission, every stinking mission.

1215
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,782
I do my job.

1216
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:19,288
I do my job.

1217
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,994
Don't worry.

1218
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:34,503
I'm going to forget
we even talked about this.

1219
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:40,005
Dear Callie,

1220
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,810
Last night, l...
I talked to my new bombardier

1221
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,782
about an idea I had,

1222
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,445
but he told me...
he told me it was crazy.

1223
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:52,987
Now I'm very confused.

1224
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:56,548
I know that I have to do
something about Morg's death,

1225
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,923
but I don't know what.

1226
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:03,295
Tonight we go out again to bomb
another useless target.

1227
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:07,598
I miss you and little Sally.

1228
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:08,830
I'll write again soon.

1229
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:10,566
Jake.

1230
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:14,609
All right, Jakey.

1231
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:16,042
Bring it up a little tighter.

1232
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,473
Here we go again.

1233
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,380
Another important road junction.

1234
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,717
Probably a couple of goat paths.

1235
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:31,489
Locking down,
ground lock on target.

1236
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:32,493
Okay.

1237
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:34,587
Drop and try it, Jake.

1238
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:40,930
Hack.

1239
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:42,062
Bombs away.

1240
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,806
All right, they're off.

1241
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:01,650
Anybody see any secondaries?

1242
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,750
Anybody see any secondaries?

1243
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,091
I didn't think so.

1244
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,131
Okay.

1245
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:10,358
Give me some altitude.

1246
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:11,330
Let's level off at 3,000.

1247
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,130
Right with you, Boxman.

1248
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:19,930
Oh, shit.

1249
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,738
We got SAMs at 1 :00.

1250
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:23,877
Okay, they launched.

1251
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:24,878
Anybody see anything?

1252
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:25,936
I think I saw two.

1253
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:28,882
They're under that cloud bank.

1254
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:29,781
You see it, Jake?

1255
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,217
Jake!

1256
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,720
Hard right! Hard right!

1257
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,589
Okay, there's one left.

1258
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,593
Uh, it just shut the radar down.

1259
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,253
Where is the sucker? Jesus!

1260
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,189
It's starting again.

1261
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:43,994
All right, listen to me,
Box: turn into it.

1262
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,557
Where? I can't see it!

1263
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:46,693
I can't see it!

1264
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,138
I'm hit, Jake, I'm hit!

1265
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,607
Oh, my God, Jake!

1266
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:54,836
Get out! Eject!

1267
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,674
Punch out! Punch out!

1268
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,709
He's gone.

1269
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,928
Grafton.

1270
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:26,270
Grafton...
you still with us?

1271
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:31,335
We all miss Boxman...
but he's gone, okay?

1272
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,844
Gentlemen...

1273
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:39,183
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Young and Mr. Reynolds.

1274
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,519
They're the replacement
crew from Hubie.

1275
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,888
So why don't you go ahead

1276
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:45,325
and tell us a little bit
about yourselves.

1277
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:48,426
Uh... I'm Lieutenant
Larry Young.

1278
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,693
Shut up, asshole.

1279
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,994
Well, we've got to name them.

1280
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,161
Why don't we just call 'em
"new guys."

1281
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,705
We used up all the good names.

1282
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,742
Let's just call them "new guys."

1283
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:00,934
New One, New Two.

1284
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:03,035
Very good, Razor.

1285
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,376
You just have such
a vivid imagination.

1286
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,746
Movie officer,
what's the film tonight?

1287
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:09,512
There's no movie,
sir, just news.

1288
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:12,782
Okay, news in the ready room.

1289
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:15,517
There will be a memorial service

1290
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:20,221
for Box and Letto
at 1 000 tomorrow.

1291
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,093
Dress is tropical white, long.

1292
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:23,325
That'll be all.

1293
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:29,400
A Swiss camera crew
in Hanoi, North Vietnam,

1294
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,599
took this footage
of a celebration of sorts,

1295
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:35,143
commemorating the defeat
of American air pirates.

1296
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:36,973
Here in
People's Resistance Park,

1297
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:40,311
they've set up trophies
of their victories:

1298
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:42,908
grim reminders of the losses

1299
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:47,081
taken in this seven-year-old war
over the North.

1300
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:58,267
I'll do it.

1301
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:01,996
I'll go downtown with you.

1302
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:06,164
But first I want you to know
something about me.

1303
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:12,372
I had a pilot
by the name of Jim Becker.

1304
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,915
He was a good man.

1305
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,383
We made an agreement

1306
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:19,717
that if we ever went down,
one of us got hurt,

1307
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,053
that the other guy would go on.

1308
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,993
A SAM took us out.

1309
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:30,555
We were down on the ground
for days,

1310
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:37,368
sneaking around, eating bugs,
living in holes that we dug.

1311
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,841
On the sixth day,
Becker stepped on a mine

1312
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,242
and blew half his leg off.

1313
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:48,944
I tied it off, and
he told me to go on.
