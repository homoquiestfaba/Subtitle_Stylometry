00:00:01,775 --> 00:00:04,608
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:16,942
(gentle piano music)

3
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:51,422
(soft music)

4
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:32,401
(baby crying)

5
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:34,237
- [Man] Get out in front of it.

6
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:36,625
Just get some milk and warm it up.

7
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:38,265
Every day here is the same thing.

8
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,630
This place is in utter chaos.

9
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,898
I am so tired I'm having a
hard time keeping my eyes open.

10
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:46,620
I have told you 100 times
how particular the boss is.

11
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,576
He wants me to look clean and neat.

12
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:49,820
What a joke!

13
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,869
Clean and neat does not
exist in this house.

14
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:54,800
Look at this shirt, it stinks.

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,369
I cannot wear this to the garage.

16
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,223
- [Cathy] Wear this one.

17
00:01:57,223 --> 00:01:58,540
- [Steve] It's a uniform, Cathy,

18
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,580
you have to wear the damn shirt.

19
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,535
You don't get it.

20
00:02:02,535 --> 00:02:04,601
There's nothing in the refrigerator.

21
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:05,518
Oh, dammit.

22
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:09,658
There's no food, there's
crap all over the counter.

23
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:11,524
- [Cathy] I'm sorry,
okay, I'll make it better.

24
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:13,926
- That'd be a nice change.

25
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,549
What's the matter with you?

26
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,061
What, am I supposed to do
everything around here?

27
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:18,787
Huh, is that it?

28
00:02:18,787 --> 00:02:21,073
I'm supposed to earn the money
and take care of this place?

29
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:22,903
Look at me, dammit, look at me!

30
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,250
I'm doing my part, geez, I'm working

31
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,060
my butt off all day long.

32
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,020
I am home from the
restaurant at three a.m.

33
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,530
so I can be up at six o'clock

34
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,373
to be to the garage on time.

35
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,370
I'm working three jobs here, Cathy.

36
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,949
I do not think it is to much to ask

37
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,000
for you to clean up the floor

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,498
and do the damn dishes every now and then.

39
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:43,876
(baby crying)

40
00:02:43,876 --> 00:02:46,293
(soft music)

41
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:51,968
(baby screaming)

42
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,553
- Andrea!

43
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:18,777
I'm not cleaning up this mess.

44
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:20,496
You made it, you clean it!

45
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:22,320
Clean it up now, go on!

46
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,070
(baby screaming)

47
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:33,034
(crying)

48
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:38,836
(baby screaming)

49
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:41,586
(hard breathing)

50
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:54,248
(baby crying)

51
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:03,342
- Mom.

52
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,925
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

53
00:04:07,824 --> 00:04:08,657
Mama.

54
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,676
(chattering)

55
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:18,562
(soft music)

56
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,651
(dog barking)

57
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,138
(soft music)

58
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,667
(somber music)

59
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,683
- Brad?

60
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,507
Oh, Brad, honey.

61
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:23,122
Sweetheart.

62
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,621
Come here, honey.

63
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:31,744
- I want my daddy.

64
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:33,161
- I know, I know.

65
00:06:34,536 --> 00:06:36,953
(soft music)

66
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,052
(sniffling)

67
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:03,906
(dog barking)

68
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:18,882
(dog crying)

69
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:21,632
(hard breathing)

70
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:33,133
(dog barking)

71
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,633
(dog panting)

72
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,830
- Okay, Hammer, race you home.

73
00:07:42,874 --> 00:07:45,374
(dog barking)

74
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:08,115
(rock music)

75
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:12,773
- Where's Andrea?

76
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,770
Brad.

77
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,302
- Mom.

78
00:08:19,302 --> 00:08:21,150
- Sorry, where's your sister?

79
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,610
- Coach Beebe called again.

80
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,656
He's gonna stop calling, you know.

81
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:25,967
- Oh.

82
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:28,300
You are not going to
school dressed like that.

83
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,200
Andrea, do we have to go
through this every morning?

84
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,033
- It's my body.

85
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:31,983
- No, it's not.

86
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,110
I mean, of course it is.

87
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,190
But I am your mother,
and I'm not gonna let you

88
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,163
walk outta here dressed
like some hooker, some.

89
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,700
Where did you get that anyway?

90
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,280
- Tandy, her mother bought it for her.

91
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,810
Her mother knows fashion.

92
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,130
- Oh well good for her mother.

93
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,000
Now go upstairs and put
some real clothes on.

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,410
- And what if I won't.

95
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,243
- What did you say?

96
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:54,558
- He's asked you out three times already.

97
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:55,391
- Just wait a minute.

98
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:57,510
- If you keep saying no,
he's gonna stop asking.

99
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,473
- Forget it.

100
00:09:02,964 --> 00:09:05,613
Oh.

101
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,898
(sighing)

102
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,440
Andrea, I'm not gonna say it again.

103
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,643
Go upstairs and change your clothes.

104
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,230
- [Andrea] Mother, you are so unfair.

105
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,330
- [Laura] Now, Andrea.

106
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,420
- No, we've pushed the
print date back three times

107
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,910
already, and if it doesn't get out now,

108
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,520
we'll miss Easter, and
we can't afford to miss.

109
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,310
- [Jerome] Miss Eagerton
can see you now, ma'am.

110
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,630
- Look, I've gotta go.

111
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,483
Just get me the galleys by the 15th.

112
00:09:42,807 --> 00:09:43,770
- Oh, hi.

113
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,763
- Mrs. Tennyson, how nice to see you.

114
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:50,510
- Thank you, and how is
my little empire faring?

115
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,240
- Well, we'll finish the
photos for the fajitas book

116
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,750
today, and I just finalized
the Sarah Beck deal

117
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,460
for the celebrities
cookbook, and I'm proofing

118
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,320
the galleys of Cooking in the Catskills.

119
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,270
- I feel it's time for
us to expand our list.

120
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,010
- Oh, Mrs. Tennyson, I am so glad.

121
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,110
I have just found this
great science writer.

122
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,780
- [Mrs. Tennyson] Erotic poetry.

123
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,187
His name is Appaloosa.

124
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:16,020
(door knocking)

125
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,370
- Not now, Jerome.

126
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,573
- It's the school nurse,
something to do with Andrea.

127
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,510
- Mrs. Eagerton, thank God
you're here, I'm so worried.

128
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,740
- [Laura] That's okay, Tandy, is she in?

129
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,020
- On the cot, yes.

130
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,490
And she says the pain
is just excruciating.

131
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,440
My second stepmother has the same thing,

132
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,400
and she's incapacitated
for three days every month.

133
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,020
She's doubled over in pain,
violent chills, vomiting.

134
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,300
- Tandy, would you please
go get Andrea's things

135
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,550
out of her locker for me?

136
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,033
- Andrea, I'll be right back.

137
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,103
- Sweetheart?

138
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,640
- Mom, it hurts.

139
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,030
I can't believe this happened in school,

140
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,273
especially in health class, God.

141
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:03,490
I'm so mortified.

142
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,913
- Don't be, it's just your.

143
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,190
Do you feel all right, did the nurse

144
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,497
give you an aspirin, or?

145
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,360
I feel like I should say something.

146
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,860
- Yeah.

147
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,743
- Well, congratulations, this
is an important moment in um.

148
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,823
- Guess I'm no longer a child.

149
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,203
- I guess not.

150
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:28,913
(soft music)

151
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:30,510
Oh, honey.

152
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,110
It's just nature's first step.

153
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,650
It doesn't mean you
have to be all grown up.

154
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,873
You're only 13.

155
00:11:37,112 --> 00:11:38,512
You're still my little girl.

156
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,440
- It hurts.

157
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,363
- Yeah, I know.

158
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,720
- Why did I have to come?

159
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,750
- Because school was almost out,

160
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,700
and I didn't know how long we'd be.

161
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,000
- Did you call Coach Beebe?

162
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,833
- Nope.

163
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,090
- He's gonna stop calling.

164
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,293
- Laura.

165
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,070
- So?

166
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,220
- She's got her period.

167
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,000
- [Laura] Well I know that,
but what about the cramps?

168
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,893
- They're cramps.

169
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,920
- So what am I doing here?

170
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,113
- You're indulging her.

171
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,610
She's a very sensitive young girl.

172
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:37,110
Caught up in the drama of
her reproductive system.

173
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,553
Problem?

174
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,713
- No, just work.

175
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,543
Kids, Dad, mortgage.

176
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,250
- All the incurable stuff, huh?

177
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,920
- I'm thinking about moving.

178
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,063
- What about your friends, your dad?

179
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,093
- My friends?

180
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,680
Well between Andrea's
drama and Brad's track,

181
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,520
and Dad's gone completely gaga over Annie,

182
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,633
which I just can't.

183
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,960
And work has become suddenly surreal,

184
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,280
and Brad is trying to set
me up with his track coach.

185
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,593
- So, what's wrong with this coach?

186
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,060
- I don't know, it's just,

187
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,860
it's only been two and a half years.

188
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,613
- Yeah, I know.

189
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,453
It's only been 14 for me, but.

190
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:31,210
- Look, I know Steve wasn't perfect,

191
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,770
but he was a good man, and a good dad,

192
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,420
and I'm just not ready to--

193
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,253
- Settle.

194
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:39,370
(laughing)

195
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,070
- I just had a depressing thought.

196
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,170
The closest thing to a
man in my life is my kids'

197
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,760
pediatrician, and he's
42.50 every time I walk

198
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,998
through the door.

199
00:13:47,998 --> 00:13:50,802
(laughing)

200
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:54,520
- The things you come up with, Brad.

201
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,310
Out of the mouths of babes.

202
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,920
- I'm not a babe.

203
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,753
- Would anyone like dessert?

204
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:00,410
- Oh no, Laura, you just sit.

205
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,640
You let me do the dishes.

206
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,680
- No, Annie.

207
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,350
- Oh now, come on, catch
me while you can, sweetie,

208
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,360
because once I get on that love boat

209
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,350
for our Christmas cruise, the only dish

210
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,623
I'm gonna be carrying is myself.

211
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:14,090
(laughing)

212
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,940
- Isn't she a pip?

213
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,610
- She's a pip, Dad.

214
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,730
- What's a pip?

215
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,010
- Same thing as a babe, just older.

216
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,170
- So how do you know Doreen Hinkle?

217
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,813
- Well, I don't really,
Andrea would you pass--

218
00:14:24,813 --> 00:14:26,700
- Well her number's on the fridge.

219
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,533
- Would you pass me the sugar?

220
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,480
- Doreen who?

221
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,290
- [Annie] Doreen Hinkle, honey, you know,

222
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,780
the one with the dark hair, talks a lot.

223
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,010
- The real estate lady?

224
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,760
- Yeah, the one who--

225
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,330
Oh my God, you're not thinking
about selling, are you?

226
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,420
- We are not selling this house.

227
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,010
- Can we move to California?

228
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,160
- Are you serious, Laura?

229
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,751
- No, no, Dad.

230
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,740
- We are not leaving this house.

231
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,090
- But Disneyland, Knotts
Berry Farm, Universal Studios.

232
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,460
- Honey, this is not the time
to sell, can't you stick?

233
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,970
- Of course I can stick.

234
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,110
I just got this thing in the mail

235
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,040
about a free appraisal, and I thought--

236
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,953
- I am never leaving this house.

237
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,927
- She's got cramps.

238
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:10,703
(dog barking)

239
00:15:10,703 --> 00:15:13,575
(crickets chirping)

240
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:16,325
(woodwind music)

241
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:54,298
(soft music)

242
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,371
(swing creaking)

243
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:11,788
(soft music)

244
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:34,035
(dogs barking)

245
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:41,931
(car starting)

246
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:45,316
(dramatic music)

247
00:16:45,316 --> 00:16:48,149
(tires squealing)

248
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:57,585
(dramatic music)

249
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:08,069
- Hi.

250
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,144
- Hi, I love your hat, is it new?

251
00:17:10,144 --> 00:17:10,979
- You wanna borrow it?

252
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:12,251
- Oh, yeah, like my mom would ever let me

253
00:17:12,251 --> 00:17:14,334
wear something like that.

254
00:17:45,486 --> 00:17:48,153
(clock chiming)

255
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,618
(door squeaking)

256
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,960
- Oh, Mrs. Hinkle, you scared me.

257
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,700
- I'm sorry, I--

258
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,457
- No, no, no, I'm glad you're early.

259
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,260
I really appreciate you
coming by this morning.

260
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,680
I need to get into work, and I didn't want

261
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,570
my daughter to be here.

262
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,973
She's not exactly crazy
about me selling this place.

263
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,590
Let me get rid of his, oh, and these.

264
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,293
Shall we start in the living room?

265
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,700
Like I said on the phone,

266
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,500
the house is 80 years old, and it's been

267
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,960
in my late husband's family forever.

268
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,050
Excuse me one minute.

269
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,963
I'll be right back.

270
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Now we rewired everything,
I'd say about six years ago.

271
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,210
The roof is new.

272
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,810
Now we did have some dry
rot a few years back,

273
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,600
but that's all gone now
and the ceiling, well,

274
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,120
there is some water damage
from before we fixed the roof.

275
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,880
See, it's right there.

276
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,713
But that's it.

277
00:19:01,889 --> 00:19:03,739
And the carpet's only five years old.

278
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:08,190
Oh my God, what a mess.

279
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,530
Oh, I should tell you that I repainted

280
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,300
the master bedroom and
both of the kids' bedrooms

281
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,533
and the upstairs bathroom
just last summer.

282
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,670
I didn't do the hallway,

283
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,590
because it's looking
pretty good still, I think.

284
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,740
And, uh, oh, what else?

285
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:27,138
The bathroom's in here.

286
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,083
Now the, uh,

287
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,693
the plumbing is really really old.

288
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,370
The tub's original, but the tile's new.

289
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:47,650
And the linen closet's out
here, it's a little small, but,

290
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,830
there's plenty of storage in the attic,

291
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,780
which is a good thing,
because I can never seem

292
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,033
to throw anything away.

293
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,533
Mrs. Hinkle, I'm in here.

294
00:19:57,468 --> 00:19:59,885
(soft music)

295
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:05,707
You know, this is really is a lovely room.

296
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,140
Should be a little more closet space,

297
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,340
but you can always use more closet space.

298
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,690
So you can see the
Methodist steeple from here.

299
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,280
Oh boy, it's getting late.

300
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,773
The kids' rooms are this way.

301
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,870
Now what else do I need to tell you?

302
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,680
Oh, we have forced heat.

303
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:28,283
Oh, teenagers never close a drawer.

304
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,110
Now underneath all this
carpet is a hardwood floor.

305
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,143
And it's really held up pretty well.

306
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,963
There's no mold or dry rot.

307
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,800
Although they always
inspect for termites, right?

308
00:20:45,562 --> 00:20:47,700
(soft music)

309
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,533
- Mrs. Hinkle?

310
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,407
(soft piano music)

311
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,826
- I'm sorry.

312
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,576
(dramatic music)

313
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:08,882
(car starting)

314
00:21:08,882 --> 00:21:13,070
- Mrs. Eagerton, Doreen
Hinkle, Van Adams Realty.

315
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,650
You know, this neighborhood is so sweet,

316
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,777
a little gem in the rough.

317
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,830
And folks are going gaga right now

318
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,370
for these cute old fixers.

319
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,530
Tell me, have you considered
carrying any paper?

320
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,212
Mrs. Eagerton?

321
00:21:25,212 --> 00:21:28,292
(school bell ringing)

322
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:31,125
(kids chattering)

323
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:39,854
- [Laura] Brad?

324
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:41,917
Brad?

325
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,960
Honey, hop in the car.

326
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,870
- I got practice.

327
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,070
- Just, please, just get in the car.

328
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,450
- I gotta go to practice.

329
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,290
- Hey, Lorelei, stick around for practice,

330
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,910
I'll take you out for nachos after.

331
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,088
- I'm sorry, Mike, we
really have to get home.

332
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:56,776
- Just tell her I gotta go to practice.

333
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:57,609
- He's gotta go to practice.

334
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,670
- Dammit, Brad, just get in the car.

335
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,240
- What about my bike?

336
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,010
- Get it, and I'll put it in the trunk.

337
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,167
I'm sorry, I've gotta go find Andrea.

338
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:09,184
(kids chattering)

339
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,703
(locker doors slamming)

340
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:28,451
(car starting)

341
00:22:28,451 --> 00:22:30,855
(horn honking)

342
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:33,130
(dramatic music)

343
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:33,963
- Brad?

344
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:37,873
Do you know who I am?

345
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,703
- No.

346
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,760
- I'm your mother.

347
00:22:46,673 --> 00:22:49,423
(dramatic music)

348
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:58,280
Brad!

349
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,530
- Brad, what are you doing?

350
00:23:01,392 --> 00:23:04,475
- Andrea, my God, I can't believe it.

351
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:06,863
Look how beautiful you are.

352
00:23:06,863 --> 00:23:07,696
- Go away.

353
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:08,977
- Andrea, please.
- Go away!

354
00:23:08,977 --> 00:23:10,394
- Andrea, Andrea.

355
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,990
- You stay away from them.

356
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,359
If you ever, ever try this
again, I'll call the police.

357
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,192
- I just.

358
00:23:19,192 --> 00:23:20,600
- I will have you arrested for, for.

359
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:23,787
Andrea?

360
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,786
Andrea?

361
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:28,524
- [Tandy] Andrea, what is it?

362
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:29,694
Who is it?

363
00:23:29,694 --> 00:23:32,444
(hard breathing)

364
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,073
- She's back, Tandy, she came back.

365
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,180
Oh my God.

366
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,013
- It's your mom.

367
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:42,550
- [Andrea] What is she
doing here, oh my God.

368
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,143
- [Tandy] Your mom you live with.

369
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,960
- You knew?

370
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,760
You knew, why didn't you say anything?

371
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,153
- Please, honey, let's
talk about this at home.

372
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,503
Andrea, please get in the car.

373
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,080
Honey, you don't have to
stop being angry with me,

374
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,583
just please get in.

375
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,833
Please?

376
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:11,301
(dramatic music)

377
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,090
This is the way he usually comes home.

378
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,690
He couldn't have gotten too far.

379
00:24:20,194 --> 00:24:22,944
(dramatic music)

380
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:55,794
- Brad?

381
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:02,875
Oh, honey, I,

382
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,313
I wanted to tell you at home, I wanted to.

383
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:10,333
(birds chirping)

384
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,690
Do you wanna talk?

385
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,523
- No.

386
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,610
- I think we should talk about it.

387
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,443
- Why?

388
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,543
- Because this is a big
deal, and must feel very.

389
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,610
I mean, she is your mother, and--

390
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,710
- She's not my mother.

391
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:48,797
What's for dinner?

392
00:25:53,055 --> 00:25:54,055
- I'll look.

393
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:04,182
(dramatic music)

394
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:06,621
(dog barking)

395
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:09,371
(dramatic music)

396
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:21,302
(car starting)

397
00:26:22,195 --> 00:26:24,945
(dramatic music)

398
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:32,880
- Mom, Mommy.

399
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:36,595
Mom.

400
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,345
(dramatic music)

401
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,011
Mommy, Mama, Mom, Mommy!

402
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:01,527
- It's okay, honey, it's okay, I'm here.

403
00:27:01,527 --> 00:27:02,937
I'm here, Andrea.

404
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:05,270
It's okay, honey, it's okay.

405
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,569
It's all right.

406
00:27:08,435 --> 00:27:10,826
It's all right, okay?

407
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:13,576
(dramatic music)

408
00:27:24,593 --> 00:27:27,426
(kids chattering)

409
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:33,240
- She looked very young
and thin, tragic kind of.

410
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,410
She looked like Audrey
Hepburn in that nun movie.

411
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,770
- She's not a nun.

412
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,780
- But she could be, you don't know.

413
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,430
That's one of those things
that makes it so romantic.

414
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,203
- Please, Tandy.

415
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,650
- Oh come on, you gotta
admit it's romantic.

416
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,483
Just showing up like this

417
00:27:46,483 --> 00:27:48,290
looking all thin and everything.

418
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,450
- It's not romantic, it's insulting.

419
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,360
Like, why does she just
assume that I wanna see her?

420
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,010
I don't even think about her anymore.

421
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,475
- Bull, you think about her.

422
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,308
- No I don't.

423
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,210
- You talk about her a lot.

424
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,430
- Not a lot.

425
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,263
- A lot.

426
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,420
At times.

427
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,130
You know what, Andrea?

428
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,400
You're lucky.

429
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,210
I haven't seen my mom more than five times

430
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,830
in the last three years.

431
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,590
I mean, I talk to her
once a week on the phone,

432
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,560
and she sends me a bunch of stuff.

433
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,940
Somehow, she thinks we're still together.

434
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,160
Please, like she knows
anything about my life.

435
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,380
But, Cathy, it was like this
really big thing, her leaving.

436
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,440
Definite.

437
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,188
So it's a really big
thing when she comes back.

438
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:27,743
I mean, don't you wanna know?

439
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:30,251
Don't you just wanna ask her?

440
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,147
(sighing)

441
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:38,817
(laughing)

442
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,884
- [Instructor] And, forward.

443
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:44,739
(dogs barking)

444
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:46,989
(laughing)

445
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:53,430
- [Instructor] And stop, and forward.

446
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,240
- Down, down, down, Duke.

447
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,540
- [Ed] You don't like her.

448
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,793
- [Laura] I don't count.

449
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,793
- Lord, I loved your mom.

450
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,573
With all my heart.

451
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,170
But I've,

452
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,632
I've never in my life had so much fun.

453
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:13,132
(dog barking)

454
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,363
So I'll talk to Price.

455
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,660
He doesn't practice family law,

456
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,650
but he'll know somebody good who does.

457
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,870
- Thanks, Dad.

458
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,260
- Until then, you can't get
some kind of restraining order?

459
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,490
- Laura, honey, forget all
about that legal thing.

460
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,070
- Annie, please.

461
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,540
Dad, I've talked to the
police, they said there had

462
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,390
to be cause or something,
and that I should

463
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,223
get a lawyer, so I--

464
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:39,630
- Honey, listen to me.

465
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,960
You get the law, the whole
legal system involved,

466
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,550
it's in, okay, I mean, lawyers and writs

467
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,880
and court orders and all that stuff.

468
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,920
I mean, maybe Brad and Andrea
don't wanna see her now,

469
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,020
but what about five years from now?

470
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,880
Kiddo, I'm telling you, you are better off

471
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,613
dealing with this woman one on one.

472
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:59,020
- I don't want to deal with her.

473
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,720
I don't want anything to do with her.

474
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,083
I just wanna keep her away from my kids.

475
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,690
Dad, I'll talk to you later.

476
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,473
- Oh, whew, she sure doesn't like me.

477
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,757
(soft music)

478
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,500
(sighing)

479
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:53,568
(bird calling)

480
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,430
- May I help you?

481
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,663
Ma'am?

482
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,893
Excuse me.

483
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:15,780
(bell ringing)

484
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,543
- Jerome, have you ever heard of this, um?

485
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,543
Get out.

486
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,450
- I wanna talk to them.

487
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,350
- I think you saw how much
they wanna talk to you.

488
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,750
- [Cathy] I did it all wrong.

489
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:30,930
- Damn right you did, now go.

490
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,240
- I'm getting married, I have a good job,

491
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,407
it's been a long time.

492
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:36,913
- It's been 10 years.

493
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,970
- It's taken me a long time.

494
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,880
I'm ashamed of what I did, but I'm not

495
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,030
ashamed of me now, I'm a good person.

496
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,320
I have this new life, and
I want my kids to know it,

497
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,770
to know me, and if they
don't want to, fine,

498
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,830
but I just have to try to say I'm sorry.

499
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,980
If there's anything they want from me.

500
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,920
- They don't want anything from you.

501
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,163
- Ask them.

502
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,263
- They love me.

503
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,720
I've taken care of them.

504
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,920
For eight years, I've taken care of them.

505
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,430
I've been through their
father's death with them.

506
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,058
They are my kids.

507
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:13,510
- I don't wanna take them away from you.

508
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,570
I just wanna talk to them.

509
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,423
Please.

510
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,423
Ask them.

511
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:23,763
Please.

512
00:32:32,206 --> 00:32:33,780
- I don't see why Tandy couldn't come.

513
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,933
- Andrea.

514
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:36,040
- [Andrea] I don't understand.

515
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,820
- [Laura] You see her all day.

516
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,550
You talk to her every night
on the phone for hours.

517
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,670
- [Andrea] Not hours.

518
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:43,920
- Sometimes it's nice
to be with just family.

519
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,253
Cathy came by my office today.

520
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,040
And she asked me to ask you

521
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,690
if you would like to talk to her.

522
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,750
I said I thought you'd
made it pretty clear

523
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,737
the other day, but just to be sure, I--

524
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,093
- No.

525
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,073
- Okay.

526
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,860
I'll call her and tell that--

527
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,693
- Mom.

528
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:35,551
(dramatic music)

529
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:42,863
(birds chirping)

530
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:45,589
(dogs barking)

531
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:48,339
(shower running)

532
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:01,136
(sighing)

533
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:12,473
- Honey, you want me
to come with you today?

534
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,690
- Do you wanna come?

535
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,893
- I will if you want me to.

536
00:34:20,854 --> 00:34:22,454
- Do you want me to want you to?

537
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:26,840
- What do you want?

538
00:34:28,773 --> 00:34:29,606
- No.

539
00:34:36,357 --> 00:34:37,190
But, Mom?

540
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:41,297
Could you be close?

541
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,028
- Mmm-hmm.

542
00:34:44,028 --> 00:34:46,445
(soft music)

543
00:34:56,647 --> 00:34:59,397
(birds chirping)

544
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:04,180
- Honey, she's just late.

545
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,377
- She's not coming.

546
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,713
- Andrea.

547
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:13,626
- Wait, wait.

548
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,012
I was early, and I thought.

549
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:22,762
(hard breathing)

550
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:27,156
Doughnut?

551
00:35:30,107 --> 00:35:30,940
Brad?

552
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:44,783
What time should I bring her home?

553
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,110
- We'll just wait here.

554
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:51,346
- Oh, okay.

555
00:35:57,853 --> 00:35:58,686
So.

556
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:12,602
(soft piano music)

557
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,170
- Brad, that tree doesn't
look very strong, honey.

558
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:50,003
Be careful.

559
00:36:56,002 --> 00:36:58,585
(dogs barking)

560
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,840
- [Cathy] It's a long time
since I been in this park.

561
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,380
- [Andrea] Why, where do you live?

562
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,700
- [Cathy] I live in Chicago.

563
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,263
- [Andrea] Oh, is it really that windy.

564
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,993
- Oh yeah, yeah.

565
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,530
What?

566
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,220
- Nothing, you, you just don't look like

567
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,323
your old pictures.

568
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,360
- You have pictures of me?

569
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,123
- Yeah, up in the attic, just a couple.

570
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,230
- Can I see your thumb?

571
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:04,780
You used to suck it so hard
you'd get these big blisters.

572
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,143
I was afraid they'd scar up and stay.

573
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:13,420
- No.

574
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,253
- No.

575
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,313
- We have the same hands.

576
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,803
- Long fingers.

577
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:38,333
- I'm really, really sorry
about the orange juice.

578
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:42,206
(soft piano music)

579
00:38:47,832 --> 00:38:49,915
(crying)

580
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,668
(kids yelling)

581
00:39:32,407 --> 00:39:34,490
- Ahhh, Mom, Mom, please!

582
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:39,140
Mom, Mom, Mom, please, get my mom.

583
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,490
- Brad, honey, I'm here.

584
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,350
Excuse me, honey, don't move, don't move.

585
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,880
Okay, where does it hurt?

586
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,713
- My ankle.

587
00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:46,960
- Okay, which ankle?
- Left.

588
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,390
- Okay, don't move.

589
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,800
How in God's name did you do this?

590
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,760
We need to get you to the hospital.

591
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,280
- Do you want me to call an ambulance?

592
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,750
- Yes, please.

593
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,020
Wait a minute, where's Andrea?

594
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,780
Can you stay with him for a minute?

595
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,613
- Sure, sure.

596
00:39:58,613 --> 00:39:59,446
- Don't move, honey.

597
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,859
- Man, how did you do this anyway?

598
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:02,692
- Andrea.

599
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:04,782
Andrea.

600
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,120
We can't wait.

601
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,400
Honey, don't put any weight on it.

602
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,290
- [Man] Let me get it.

603
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,980
- Great, thank you.

604
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,260
It's okay, it's okay.

605
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,177
- I got you, I got you.

606
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:23,065
- What happened?

607
00:40:23,065 --> 00:40:24,850
- I think Brad broke his leg.

608
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,080
We're going to the hospital.

609
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,970
- We'll follow you.

610
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,310
- No.

611
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,850
- Come on, Andrea.

612
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,683
- Mom.

613
00:40:32,928 --> 00:40:34,028
Do you really need me?

614
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:37,510
- Why don't I take Andrea home?

615
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,410
That way, you can concentrate on Brad.

616
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,193
- Go straight home.

617
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,020
- Now your left ear.

618
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,440
No, this is nothing.

619
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,290
People come in here all the time,

620
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,600
bones speared through the skin,

621
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,040
limbs hanging by tendons.

622
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,873
- Gross.

623
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:58,003
- Let me look in your eye.

624
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:02,460
- Ah, a casualty.

625
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,960
- Hi, Joe.

626
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,550
- So what happened to you?

627
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,833
- I jumped off a statue.

628
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,930
- Sure, why not?

629
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,660
- Hairline fracture in the tibia.

630
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,510
Some pulled ligaments, no hemorrhage.

631
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,053
- Yep.

632
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,980
So, you want plaster or one of those

633
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,810
fancy athletic braces?

634
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,280
- Athletic brace.

635
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,433
- You got it, cowboy.

636
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,350
- [P.A.] Dr. Cottrell, Dr. Janet Cottrell.

637
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:31,563
Emergency admitting.

638
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,540
- How did you meet Anthony?

639
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:38,023
- He hired me for the counter.

640
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,710
It paid well, and I always liked jewelry.

641
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,750
It's not like one of those
junky little mall chains.

642
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,453
It's a nice old family business.

643
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,160
His dad was a pearl man.

644
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,463
- So you're a salesgirl?

645
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,210
- Started that way.

646
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,760
But then I got into the
gems and wanted to move up.

647
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,200
Anthony was very supportive.

648
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,360
Even paid for me to go to
the Gemological Institute.

649
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,460
So now I have my certificate.

650
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,133
- What's this?

651
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,633
- Amethyst, Brazilian.

652
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,103
Pretty.

653
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,403
Semi-precious.

654
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,800
- Tandy gave it to me.

655
00:42:39,477 --> 00:42:42,644
- Did your dad ever tell you about me?

656
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,270
Did you ever ask?

657
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,173
- Not after a while.

658
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,680
- I left home when I was 13.

659
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:57,594
(phone ringing)

660
00:42:57,594 --> 00:43:01,720
- [P.A.] IV nurse, call the
fourth-floor nurses station.

661
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,870
- I shoulda kept an eye on him.

662
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:05,630
He was antsy, and when he
gets antsy he gets so--

663
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,630
- Laura, he's fine.

664
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,273
- No, he's not.

665
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,933
Their mother's back.

666
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,023
- What?

667
00:43:16,023 --> 00:43:17,570
- Cathy, their mother,

668
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,013
she's in town.

669
00:43:25,987 --> 00:43:29,280
(phone ringing)

670
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,330
- Have they seen her?

671
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,203
- Andrea's with her now.

672
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,210
What will this do to them?

673
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,280
- What do you mean?

674
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,113
- Emotionally.

675
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,710
Look, I know you're not a shrink,

676
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,210
but you are their doctor,
and you've known them

677
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,630
almost as long as I have,
and everything they've

678
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:48,440
been through, and this
can't be good for them.

679
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,170
This could do permanent damage, right?

680
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,990
- Look, Laura, I think we're all

681
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,193
permanently damaged by our parents.

682
00:43:57,947 --> 00:44:02,230
- [P.A] Dr. Cohen to radiology,
Dr. Cohen to radiology.

683
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,580
- You are a terrific
mom, and they love you.

684
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:09,340
But this is somebody too.

685
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,900
- Brad says she's not his mother.

686
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,441
- [Joe] Okay, so he's not
ready to deal with it yet.

687
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,900
- And Andrea's at such
an impressionable age.

688
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,850
- She's a bright girl.

689
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:15,700
- She's just a child.

690
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,788
- What are you afraid of?

691
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:18,800
- What do you think I'm afraid of?

692
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,401
This woman is going to
take away my children.

693
00:44:21,401 --> 00:44:24,690
- Laura, come on.

694
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,250
What is she to them?

695
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,870
A ghost, a mystery, a question
that needs to be answered.

696
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:30,983
But not a mother.

697
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,903
That's you.

698
00:44:35,777 --> 00:44:36,627
And they know it.

699
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,180
- How'd you meet Daddy?

700
00:44:44,095 --> 00:44:44,928
- At a car wash.

701
00:44:46,576 --> 00:44:48,583
He brought his church group or something.

702
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:52,453
He drove up in this red Camaro.

703
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,723
He was older, cute.

704
00:44:58,336 --> 00:44:59,486
- And you got pregnant?

705
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,527
- Not right away, but--

706
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:06,668
- And you got married.

707
00:45:06,668 --> 00:45:07,501
And you had me.

708
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:12,680
- Yes, I did.

709
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,833
- Then you had Brad, and then you left.

710
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:19,832
- Yeah.

711
00:45:22,092 --> 00:45:22,925
I did.

712
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:25,703
- Because you didn't love us.

713
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,150
- No.

714
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,660
- Then why, did Daddy do something?

715
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,493
- No, no.

716
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:35,208
It wasn't his fault.

717
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:37,983
He did the best he could.

718
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,640
I wasn't much older
than you when I had you.

719
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,950
I was too immature.

720
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,133
I, I couldn't.

721
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:54,589
(dog barking)

722
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:57,553
I never wanted to hurt you, Andrea.

723
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:01,843
That's why I left.

724
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:06,313
But I never stopped loving you.

725
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,295
I thought about you and Brad
every minute of every day.

726
00:46:11,295 --> 00:46:12,895
- Then why didn't you come back?

727
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:17,743
- Because I felt I didn't
have anything to give you.

728
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,263
Up to now.

729
00:46:27,822 --> 00:46:30,070
- She was supposed to be here hours ago.

730
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:30,953
I don't know.

731
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,670
Hold it.

732
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,320
Oh no, it's okay, she's here now.

733
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,630
- Where are my birthday cards?

734
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,472
(rock music)

735
00:46:41,472 --> 00:46:42,305
- What?

736
00:46:42,305 --> 00:46:43,750
- And Christmas, every year from Cathy.

737
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,880
10 years' worth of cards,

738
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,530
and I never even knew about them?

739
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,155
(rock music)

740
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:55,550
(clocking chiming)

741
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,153
- I was going to tell you.

742
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:10,923
I just.

743
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,903
Andrea, it was your dad.

744
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,320
At first, when you were
little, he thought,

745
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,820
he thought it would hurt and confuse you

746
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,653
getting cards from her, and then,

747
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,000
after he died, I felt you'd
had enough to deal with it.

748
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,382
And I thought maybe when
you were 16, I could--

749
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:33,882
- You opened them?

750
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,793
You had no right.

751
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,303
- I'm sorry, honey.

752
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:40,270
I was only doing what I
thought was best for you.

753
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,073
- Stealing the only thing
she ever sent me was best?

754
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,913
- What the hell does she know
about your seventh birthday?

755
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,763
You had the measles.

756
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,700
And I stayed up with you all night

757
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,053
putting on calamine lotion.

758
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:06,603
For my daughter on her seventh birthday.

759
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:09,783
- They were mine.

760
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,977
- When are you leaving?

761
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,630
- Friday.

762
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:35,463
- Good.

763
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,670
If I let you see Andrea
again, you will bring her home

764
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:42,690
when I tell you to bring her home,

765
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,940
or you will not be
allowed to see her at all.

766
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,930
- Why didn't you adopt them?

767
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,135
- Did she tell you that?

768
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,613
- I checked the records at county.

769
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,873
- God, you've got nerve.

770
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,960
- When Steve and I got married,

771
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,313
you wouldn't let me adopt them, remember?

772
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:10,660
- You coulda gone to court.

773
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,000
You coulda proved I abandoned them.

774
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,950
- I didn't wanna put them through that.

775
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:19,305
- Ah.

776
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:30,663
- [Laura] Why?

777
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,333
- Just curious.

778
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,900
- Well if you're curious
about anything else,

779
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,480
don't ask around at county.

780
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,810
Don't ask her.

781
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,603
Ask me, okay?

782
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:44,880
- You're so easy to talk to.

783
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,320
- What the hell do you want from me?

784
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,883
You walk in, you disrupt my life, you--

785
00:49:48,883 --> 00:49:51,760
- This is my life you got, okay?

786
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,950
My kids, my house, my life.

787
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,820
- You were the one that walked out.

788
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,560
- And you're the one who
benefited from it, okay?

789
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,550
So maybe you can treat me
with a little courtesy.

790
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:05,537
- What, you want me to say thank you?

791
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,200
- Can I take Andrea out to dinner tonight?

792
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,140
- No, it's a school night.

793
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,583
- She has to eat.

794
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,423
- I'll feed her.

795
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,933
- Laura, I'm leaving Friday.

796
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,250
- Just have her home by seven.

797
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,103
- Thank you.

798
00:50:42,227 --> 00:50:45,739
(instructor speaking French)

799
00:50:45,739 --> 00:50:49,072
(class speaking French)

800
00:50:52,364 --> 00:50:54,894
(instructor speaking French)

801
00:50:54,894 --> 00:50:58,541
(class speaking French)

802
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:01,498
(instructor speaking French)

803
00:51:01,498 --> 00:51:03,005
(class speaking French)

804
00:51:03,005 --> 00:51:04,739
- A Christmas wedding at
Anthony's country club.

805
00:51:04,739 --> 00:51:06,050
He's really rich, his dad was a pearl man.

806
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,519
- Wow.

807
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,569
(clearing throat)

808
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:13,395
(instructor speaking French)

809
00:51:13,395 --> 00:51:16,728
(class speaking French)

810
00:51:19,382 --> 00:51:20,900
- She says he's really nice,

811
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,620
really supportive of her and all.

812
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,130
She says I'm really gonna like him.

813
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,180
- Wow, weird, huh?

814
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,013
- Yeah.

815
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:28,880
What?

816
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,037
- Just that she was the screw-up,

817
00:51:30,037 --> 00:51:31,920
and your mom was the good one.

818
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,140
Now it's Cathy who's got
a great job in a big,

819
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,070
beautiful city getting
married to a rich man

820
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,313
who's crazy about her.

821
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:40,200
And then your mom lives here, God.

822
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,570
Has this little cookbook job and

823
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,640
and like no men interested in her.

824
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,480
It's just weird, huh?

825
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,313
Karma.

826
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,460
- I guess.

827
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,910
- [Laura] It's too late for a lawyer.

828
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:51,743
- It's never too late.

829
00:51:51,743 --> 00:51:53,070
- Andrea wants to see her.

830
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:55,153
If I bring a lawyer in
now, I'm the bad guy.

831
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,750
- Is that what you're worried
about, being the bad guy?

832
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,903
- I am worried about losing my daughter.

833
00:52:02,426 --> 00:52:04,410
(car starting)

834
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,210
- Then let the courts help you
set some reasonable limits.

835
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,310
- Dad, if I can't set
reasonable limits on my kids

836
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:11,883
without legal action then
I'm not much of a parent.

837
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,233
Dad.

838
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,390
- You asked me what I think,
I give you my best advice,

839
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:25,950
you throw it back in my face.

840
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:28,110
- That's how we always do it.

841
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:31,113
- Dammit, Laura, sometimes
you drive me so crazy, I.

842
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,750
- Come to dinner?

843
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:38,810
- I'm gonna go shopping
with Annie for the cruise.

844
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,193
She needs something formal.

845
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,730
- And here I thought
Spandex fit every occasion.

846
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,303
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I.

847
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:55,910
(dog barking)

848
00:53:08,325 --> 00:53:13,325
♪ Tell me why the stars do shine ♪

849
00:53:14,105 --> 00:53:16,272
♪ Tell me ♪

850
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,870
- I used to sing that to you.

851
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,000
I guess you were too young to remember.

852
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:28,750
Brad, I know you're mad at
me, and I don't blame you.

853
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:32,070
Brad, I just wanna say that
no matter what, I love you.

854
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:34,466
- Bull, you can't love me.

855
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:35,580
You don't even know me.

856
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,253
I don't know you, I don't
wanna know you, ever!

857
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:44,390
- I realize that, and
I have thought about.

858
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,223
Brad.

859
00:53:46,467 --> 00:53:48,320
- Are you stupid, what
the hell are you doing?

860
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,609
- Honey.

861
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:50,760
- [Cathy] Hello.

862
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,593
- Hi.

863
00:53:52,652 --> 00:53:53,485
Come on in.

864
00:53:53,485 --> 00:53:54,800
- Yes, Mrs. Hinkle, I'm still here.

865
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,829
- Nice outfit, love your hair.

866
00:53:56,829 --> 00:53:58,050
- Thanks, hold on a second.

867
00:53:58,050 --> 00:53:59,200
- I changed my mind.

868
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,600
- Bye, Mom.

869
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,610
- Seven o'clock.

870
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:03,550
- Promise.
- Promise.

871
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:06,313
- And, um, wait a minute, what restaurant?

872
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,080
No, I love this house, I could never sell.

873
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,053
Andrea.

874
00:54:12,213 --> 00:54:14,243
No, it was a mood, okay, it passed.

875
00:54:16,205 --> 00:54:17,539
Andrea.

876
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:20,029
(dog barking)

877
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:22,946
(soft piano music)

878
00:54:45,761 --> 00:54:47,928
(sighing)

879
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:55,031
(dramatic music)

880
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,220
- Brad, what are you doing?

881
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,053
Drop it, drop it.

882
00:55:02,053 --> 00:55:02,886
Just drop it.

883
00:55:02,886 --> 00:55:04,650
- They're mine, I can do
anything I want with them.

884
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,980
- That's true.

885
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,443
That's true, and I understand
why you wanna do this, but--

886
00:55:07,443 --> 00:55:08,943
- Then give me the matches.

887
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,900
- Look, you may not believe this now,

888
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,543
but I think that someday,
you'll probably want these.

889
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,523
- Are you gonna give me the matches?

890
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:27,663
- No.

891
00:55:28,512 --> 00:55:31,262
(dramatic music)

892
00:55:59,496 --> 00:56:01,250
- [Andrea] It was Brad's birthday.

893
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,313
We went on a picnic.

894
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:08,993
I was, I don't know, six maybe, seven.

895
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,120
You had been gone for a while.

896
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:18,023
It was her hair, mostly,
and the way she walked.

897
00:56:19,821 --> 00:56:21,310
I thought it was you.

898
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:23,060
I kept thinking, what should I say?

899
00:56:23,939 --> 00:56:24,903
Should I say hello?

900
00:56:25,903 --> 00:56:27,053
Or where have you been?

901
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:31,764
- Andrea.

902
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:32,597
Andrea.

903
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,533
Andrea.

904
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,740
- I went to a counselor
for a while after that.

905
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,723
I didn't want to, but Mom made me.

906
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,623
- She was right.

907
00:56:49,927 --> 00:56:50,920
(sighing)

908
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,093
When I first left,

909
00:56:54,892 --> 00:56:57,163
I couldn't look at little
kids without crying.

910
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,220
And then, after a year or two,

911
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,570
I started going outta
my way to be near them.

912
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,273
I'd stand outside a preschool,

913
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:12,283
or sit by a sandbox in a park.

914
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,030
And I'd pick out two kids

915
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,560
I could pretend were you and your brother.

916
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,373
I'd just watch.

917
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,823
And think to myself, no, Brad,
don't eat the sand, sweetie.

918
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,373
Or, Andrea baby, don't climb too high.

919
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,060
- There were no return addresses

920
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,890
on the cards you sent me.

921
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,067
- I wanted you to know
that I still loved you.

922
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:43,867
- But you didn't wanna hear from me?

923
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:45,960
- Your dad had remarried.

924
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,160
I thought you were better off.

925
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,630
- But you didn't know.

926
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:50,850
You didn't know if we were happy,

927
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:52,790
or if Mom was beating us or--

928
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:53,623
- Does she beat--

929
00:57:53,623 --> 00:57:54,960
- No.

930
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,653
But why did you just assume?

931
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:02,393
- I won't anymore, okay?

932
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:07,220
From now on, I'll always ask,

933
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:10,083
and you'll always tell me, okay?

934
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:24,052
Oh.

935
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:26,980
I have something for you.

936
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,890
I have something for Brad, too.

937
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,253
I wanted to wait to be
sure it was all right.

938
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:36,283
- Thank you.

939
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:45,683
It's beautiful.

940
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:48,140
- They used to say, if you put an emerald

941
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,833
under your tongue, you
could predict the future.

942
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,570
- How about this?

943
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:57,653
- Let's see.

944
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:01,515
Amethyst.

945
00:59:01,515 --> 00:59:04,823
Amethyst will protect you from betrayal.

946
00:59:07,632 --> 00:59:08,532
You're well armed.

947
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:13,253
- We better go.

948
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:15,918
- I know.

949
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,593
I could stay here all night.

950
00:59:21,374 --> 00:59:22,207
- I know.

951
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:25,263
The wedding sounds great.

952
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:29,883
And Anthony, and Chicago and everything.

953
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,833
- You'd love it.

954
00:59:40,308 --> 00:59:42,975
(clock chiming)

955
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:58,150
(car engine running)

956
01:00:06,154 --> 01:00:08,737
(door opening)

957
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:12,433
- Hi, honey.

958
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:14,890
Have a nice time?

959
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,990
- Yeah, good night, Mom.

960
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,560
- Where'd you go?

961
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,543
- City Lights at Centerpoint.

962
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,253
- Oh, was it good?

963
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,840
I've been thinking about
taking all of us there

964
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,913
for New Year's Eve.

965
01:00:32,924 --> 01:00:34,257
What'd you have?

966
01:00:35,624 --> 01:00:36,791
- Night, Mom.

967
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:45,890
(door closing)

968
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:49,057
(soft dramatic music)

969
01:01:24,626 --> 01:01:27,376
(birds chirping)

970
01:01:30,927 --> 01:01:32,471
- [P.A.] Resident on call to ER.

971
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:33,434
Resident on call to ER.

972
01:01:33,434 --> 01:01:34,417
- I got a call.

973
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:36,629
- Mrs. Eagerton, haven't
seen you in a few days.

974
01:01:36,629 --> 01:01:37,462
- What happened?

975
01:01:37,462 --> 01:01:39,120
- Don't worry, he's gonna
live, right over here.

976
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,480
Apparently, he convinced his coach

977
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,345
he could jump with the brace on.

978
01:01:42,345 --> 01:01:43,870
- Oh.

979
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:46,130
Brad, what were you thinking, honey?

980
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,530
Your leg is broken, you could have--

981
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:49,470
- Laura, he's in enough pain.

982
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,000
- But, Joe, he could have hurt himself.

983
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,770
- He's gonna be okay, why
don't you go get some coffee?

984
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,480
- I don't want coffee.

985
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,313
- Laura.

986
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,146
- [P.A.] Dr. Rosen, please dial 884.

987
01:02:00,146 --> 01:02:02,396
Dr. Rosen, please dial 884.

988
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,980
- This was not a brilliant move.

989
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,400
That hurt?

990
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,361
There?

991
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,311
- Ah.

992
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:14,144
Yeah.

993
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:16,873
- I hear things have
been pretty interesting

994
01:02:16,873 --> 01:02:18,433
around your house lately.

995
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,400
Do you remember much about her, Brad?

996
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:27,523
Your mother?

997
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,930
- My mother is getting coffee.

998
01:02:31,529 --> 01:02:34,446
(machines beeping)

999
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,300
- Remember when you fell off the roof?

1000
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:43,630
You were six years old.

1001
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,380
You broke your arm, you split your lip

1002
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:46,680
and you were making jokes.

1003
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:48,603
Tough little guy.

1004
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:52,163
But your dad,

1005
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,490
he stood in my office and he sobbed.

1006
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,323
He was so scared, so angry at himself.

1007
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,690
Just sobbed, did you know that?

1008
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:15,823
You know, it's okay to cry, Brad.

1009
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,823
It's okay to be angry.

1010
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:21,880
It's okay to hate her.

1011
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,223
It's even okay to like her.

1012
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:29,693
To be curious.

1013
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:32,957
- Can I go now?

1014
01:03:37,566 --> 01:03:38,399
- Yeah.

1015
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:44,460
- If this ever happens again, Brad,

1016
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:46,636
no more track, I mean it.

1017
01:03:46,636 --> 01:03:48,590
I have half a mind to
have your coach fired.

1018
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:49,423
- You just don't like him.

1019
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:50,256
- No, I don't.

1020
01:03:50,256 --> 01:03:53,289
And this little episode
certainly hasn't helped.

1021
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:55,560
- [Andrea] I can't believe
it, it's so beautiful.

1022
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,410
- [Laura] Andrea?

1023
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,513
- Isn't it gorgeous.

1024
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,070
- Yes, but.

1025
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:03,060
- I'm gonna wear it in the wedding.

1026
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,610
I'm gonna be the maid of honor.

1027
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,430
- I know I should have
asked you first, Laura,

1028
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:10,060
but we were shopping and saw the dress,

1029
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:10,893
and everything just--

1030
01:04:10,893 --> 01:04:14,680
- No, absolutely not.

1031
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,030
- Mom, please, I'm gonna
go on the honeymoon, too.

1032
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:19,130
We're gonna go to St. Thomas scuba diving.

1033
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,220
- Andrea, it's Christmas.

1034
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:23,500
You're supposed to spend Christmas

1035
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,280
with your family, remember?

1036
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,470
- But Grandpa Ed and
Annie are leaving anyway.

1037
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:29,510
- Go take that thing off
and get ready for dinner.

1038
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:30,343
- [Andrea] No.

1039
01:04:30,343 --> 01:04:31,176
- Andrea.

1040
01:04:31,176 --> 01:04:33,030
- I wanna go, I wanna
be the maid of honor.

1041
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,280
We already have my ticket
set and everything.

1042
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,793
- You are some piece of work.

1043
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,300
- Andrea, do what she says.

1044
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,850
- Don't help me out here, okay.

1045
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,593
Feel free to see yourself out.

1046
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,480
I'm sure you remember where the door is.

1047
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:15,070
- It's only for a couple weeks.

1048
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:16,720
Winter vacation starts Friday,

1049
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,430
so she won't miss any school.

1050
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,870
- You have really set me up here.

1051
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:24,070
Whatever I do, I'm the bad guy.

1052
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:25,640
- Believe me, Laura, in this equation

1053
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,320
you can never be the bad guy.

1054
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:30,330
- Oh, so now I'm supposed
to feel sorry for you?

1055
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:32,280
Because you screwed up,
and now you wanna make it

1056
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,930
all better, and I'm supposed to be patient

1057
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:36,423
and understanding and nice.

1058
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,083
Forget it.

1059
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,493
(train whistle blowing)

1060
01:05:57,942 --> 01:06:00,525
(kids yelling)

1061
01:06:08,305 --> 01:06:11,070
Huh, for someone so good at leaving,

1062
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:12,620
you're sure hell to get rid of.

1063
01:06:13,547 --> 01:06:16,297
(birds chirping)

1064
01:06:22,185 --> 01:06:25,768
- You wanna hear the
whole wedding fantasy?

1065
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,403
My daughter is maid of honor.

1066
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:32,840
My son is best man.

1067
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,740
- You can't blame him.

1068
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,740
- I don't blame him.

1069
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:37,993
He's just like Steve.

1070
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:42,920
Looks right through you
like you don't exist.

1071
01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:46,360
- Well I don't remember Steve doing that.

1072
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,210
What you said about me having your life.

1073
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:00,493
I've thought a lot about that, I guess.

1074
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,733
I guess every second wife does.

1075
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:06,970
Thinks about the first wife.

1076
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,920
Wonders what she left
you and why she left it.

1077
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,423
Steve was a good man.

1078
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,050
- I never said he wasn't.

1079
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:25,330
- You know, it took us
years before we could fight.

1080
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:28,063
Just,

1081
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,020
fight like married people without him

1082
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,853
making me promise I wouldn't leave.

1083
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,200
How could you do it?

1084
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,793
I mean,

1085
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,360
what gave you permission to just walk out?

1086
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,193
To just.

1087
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:55,110
- You never felt like you were drowning?

1088
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,860
- Overwhelmed, daily.

1089
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,490
But I could never leave my kids.

1090
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:01,173
- I didn't know what to do.

1091
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:04,930
I had no one to go to, I was terrified.

1092
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:05,890
- They were babies, they were terrified.

1093
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:07,421
- What did you want me to do?

1094
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:09,771
Would you rather have me
stay and beat my kids?

1095
01:08:18,077 --> 01:08:20,410
(sniffling)

1096
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,100
I'll never forgive myself
for not being stronger.

1097
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,113
But I wasn't.

1098
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,153
Then.

1099
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,203
- I knew it.

1100
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,702
- They're my kids.

1101
01:08:46,702 --> 01:08:47,560
- No.

1102
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,217
- I've talked to a lawyer,
I could get custody.

1103
01:08:49,217 --> 01:08:50,780
- No, you planned this all along.

1104
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:53,630
- No, honestly, when I came,
I just wanted to see them.

1105
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,080
But I've already missed so much.

1106
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,270
- And who's fault is that?

1107
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:59,193
- Mine, and I'm not
gonna screw it up again.

1108
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:03,249
I'm getting married to a wonderful man.

1109
01:09:03,249 --> 01:09:06,207
They'd have a mother and a father and.

1110
01:09:06,207 --> 01:09:08,957
(dramatic music)

1111
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:15,250
- You can't go.

1112
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,960
- You little twerp, get outta my room.

1113
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,730
- I won't let you.

1114
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:21,180
- I have to, she's my
mother, she's your mother.

1115
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,013
- No.

1116
01:09:22,013 --> 01:09:22,846
- She is.

1117
01:09:22,846 --> 01:09:24,890
Whether you like it or
not, she's our mother.

1118
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:26,830
And I care about her, I wanna know her.

1119
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:27,803
I wanna know who she is.

1120
01:09:27,803 --> 01:09:29,453
- Then you're not my sister.

1121
01:09:37,535 --> 01:09:39,350
(door knocking)

1122
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,850
(dog barking)

1123
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,685
(dog barking)

1124
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:54,653
- Laura.

1125
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:56,890
- Dad, your phone's been off the hook.

1126
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:58,560
I need that number.

1127
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,393
- [Ed] What number?

1128
01:09:59,393 --> 01:10:00,810
- I've been trying to call you for hours,

1129
01:10:00,810 --> 01:10:02,003
the lawyer's number.

1130
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:05,440
Cathy wants the kids.

1131
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,940
She's seeing somebody, and
she can get custody, and so,

1132
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:11,763
if you could please
just get me that number.

1133
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,250
- Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1134
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,740
Look, can I get you
some coffee or anything.

1135
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:18,160
- No, thank you.

1136
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,547
- Well, did she get an injunction or?

1137
01:10:20,547 --> 01:10:23,520
- No, Annie, Annie,
it's complicated, okay?

1138
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,160
- Well does Andrea wanna go with her?

1139
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,330
- Of course she wants to go with her.

1140
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:28,930
She thinks it's all
about being in a wedding.

1141
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,510
She doesn't realize that
Cathy wants her to stay.

1142
01:10:31,510 --> 01:10:32,350
- She doesn't?

1143
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:34,100
- Shut up, Annie, just for once.

1144
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,080
- You know, honey, you can
go get a judge that's gonna

1145
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,940
give you a piece of paper
that keeps Cathy outta town.

1146
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,580
But that's not gonna keep
Andrea from thinking about

1147
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,673
or caring about her mother.

1148
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:47,223
- I am her mother.

1149
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,270
- You know, I was born
to one hell of a bitch.

1150
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:59,800
Ooh, she was tight-fisted
and she was mean.

1151
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,300
But she clothed and she fed me.

1152
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,990
But the lady next door, my Aunt Jo,

1153
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:07,070
that was who I went to
when I needed somebody

1154
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:10,080
to cry on or take care of me.

1155
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,433
I always did right by
the woman who raised me,

1156
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,393
but I did for Aunt Jo because I loved her.

1157
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:20,943
Everybody chooses their own mother.

1158
01:11:22,468 --> 01:11:25,385
(soft piano music)

1159
01:11:27,354 --> 01:11:29,104
- I can't let her go.

1160
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:33,160
- Sounds to me like she's halfway gone.

1161
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,810
- But she's too young, she's too.

1162
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:40,650
- Honey, you can hold
this door open for her,

1163
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:44,370
or you can bolt it shut and
force her to knock it down.

1164
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:46,610
But either way, sooner or later,

1165
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:49,522
she's gonna come through this door.

1166
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:51,939
(soft music)

1167
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:23,840
- Have you done anything?

1168
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:26,123
Legally?

1169
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,633
About custody.

1170
01:12:33,587 --> 01:12:34,420
- No.

1171
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,313
- I could fight you.

1172
01:12:42,554 --> 01:12:43,763
I'd probably win.

1173
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,053
- In a year, Andrea'll be 14.

1174
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:52,170
Legally, she can decide
who she wants to live with.

1175
01:12:57,852 --> 01:13:00,019
I don't wanna go to court.

1176
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,603
I want us to work this out ourselves.

1177
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:05,823
Just you and me.

1178
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:09,693
- And then?

1179
01:13:15,236 --> 01:13:17,153
- I know you love them.

1180
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,330
And I know they love you.

1181
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:24,870
They're great kids because of you.

1182
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:29,410
I'm envious of what you've been to them,

1183
01:13:31,019 --> 01:13:33,540
and I'm also thankful.

1184
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:34,373
- Don't, just.

1185
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:42,903
I want her to come home after the wedding.

1186
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:46,070
- What about St. Thomas?

1187
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:47,893
- She doesn't know how to scuba dive.

1188
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:50,480
- I'll teach her.

1189
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,910
- Of course you will.

1190
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,373
Okay, but,

1191
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,130
I want her home in time for school.

1192
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:03,960
No matter what happens,
I want her to finish

1193
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,673
the school year, here.

1194
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:09,263
- Okay.

1195
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:11,973
I thought,

1196
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,930
if Brad wanted to, they might both come.

1197
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:20,180
- Please, let's just get through this.

1198
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,631
(sighing)

1199
01:14:32,475 --> 01:14:33,975
- Mom, Mommy, Mom.

1200
01:14:38,025 --> 01:14:38,858
Mommy.

1201
01:14:40,272 --> 01:14:43,022
(dramatic music)

1202
01:14:52,078 --> 01:14:53,843
Mom, Mommy.

1203
01:14:54,969 --> 01:14:55,802
Mom.

1204
01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:58,502
Mom.

1205
01:14:59,892 --> 01:15:00,860
- I'm here, Andrea.

1206
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:02,333
Wake up, honey, wake up.

1207
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,650
You know she wants you
to come live with her.

1208
01:15:15,619 --> 01:15:17,769
That's what this wedding
trip is all about.

1209
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,180
Showing you just how nice it would be.

1210
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,897
- I really wanna go.

1211
01:15:34,475 --> 01:15:35,877
- Okay.

1212
01:15:35,877 --> 01:15:38,294
(soft music)

1213
01:15:39,646 --> 01:15:41,979
(sniffling)

1214
01:15:43,325 --> 01:15:44,158
Okay.

1215
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:08,180
- I thought you might need these.

1216
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,797
It's her prescription
stuff for her cramps.

1217
01:16:10,797 --> 01:16:13,310
And an iron supplement, plus some cream

1218
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:16,760
for around her toenails, she
has a problem with ingrowns.

1219
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,290
And if she should break out in a rash,

1220
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:20,610
use this ointment, and
make sure that there's

1221
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:23,350
no lavender in her soap
or cologne or whatever,

1222
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,890
because she's allergic to lavender.

1223
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:26,723
- I know.

1224
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:34,393
Andrea, we better go.

1225
01:16:39,157 --> 01:16:40,290
- I almost forget.

1226
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:42,553
- No keep it, to remember me.

1227
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:45,360
- I'll bring you back something okay?

1228
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,193
- Sure.

1229
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,222
- Sweetie.

1230
01:16:50,222 --> 01:16:52,639
(soft music)

1231
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,023
- Have fun, okay?

1232
01:17:10,029 --> 01:17:11,133
- Bye, Mom.

1233
01:17:11,133 --> 01:17:11,966
- Bye.

1234
01:17:13,289 --> 01:17:15,570
You have a safe trip.

1235
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:17,800
Call me when you get there, okay?

1236
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:26,773
- Why did you say yes?

1237
01:17:26,773 --> 01:17:28,010
She's the only person in the whole world

1238
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:29,810
I really care about.

1239
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:32,400
At least you still have Brad,
but I don't have anybody.

1240
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,823
- Tandy, she's coming back, she's coming

1241
01:17:38,379 --> 01:17:39,212
back.

1242
01:17:41,731 --> 01:17:44,148
(soft music)

1243
01:18:02,868 --> 01:18:06,118
- I can't believe you're actually here.

1244
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,043
- Wow, look at the skyscrapers.

1245
01:18:10,754 --> 01:18:13,260
- You should see the view
from the top of that one.

1246
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,263
I'll take you up there later, if you like.

1247
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,170
- When do I meet Anthony?

1248
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:19,478
- Lunch.

1249
01:18:19,478 --> 01:18:20,311
- Oh.

1250
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:23,670
- Do you like this room?

1251
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:24,980
- I love it.

1252
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:25,833
- It's yours.

1253
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:28,643
- This is just amazing.

1254
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:31,690
- This is just the beginning.

1255
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:32,790
- Can I use the phone?

1256
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,533
- Sure.

1257
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:38,953
Then get dressed and I'll
take you to breakfast.

1258
01:18:44,994 --> 01:18:47,494
(busy signal)

1259
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,630
- Tandy, hi, oh my God,

1260
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:55,540
there's these incredibly high skyscrapers

1261
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,743
right outside my window.

1262
01:18:58,645 --> 01:18:59,478
(dog barking)

1263
01:18:59,478 --> 01:19:01,913
- Hey hey hey now, Duke, you cut that out.

1264
01:19:03,961 --> 01:19:04,961
- You gonna be okay?

1265
01:19:05,870 --> 01:19:07,710
I feel like I'm abandoning you.

1266
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:10,696
- I'm a grown woman,
Dad, I'm not abandonable.

1267
01:19:10,696 --> 01:19:13,029
(chuckling)

1268
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:17,943
- Where's that grandson of mine?

1269
01:19:17,943 --> 01:19:20,110
- Oh, he's out back
shoveling snow off the porch.

1270
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:22,107
- Okay, I'll take him, come on.

1271
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:25,300
- He likes the yellow one for water.

1272
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,340
Don't ask me why.

1273
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:30,203
I really appreciate you doing this, a lot.

1274
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,110
- I'm glad Dad has you.

1275
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:34,910
- Oh, no you aren't.

1276
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:36,670
- Well, I'm coming around.

1277
01:19:36,670 --> 01:19:40,053
- Oh, good, I'm glad to hear it.

1278
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,054
Now, listen, while
we're gone, can you just

1279
01:19:43,054 --> 01:19:45,780
do something nice for yourself?

1280
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,220
I mean, do something to relax,

1281
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:48,740
take your mind off everything.

1282
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,660
- Sure.

1283
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:50,943
- What do you do for fun?

1284
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,051
- Fight with my daughter.

1285
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:55,051
- Oh, honey.

1286
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,490
(diners chattering)

1287
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:01,630
- Old people, young people, kids,

1288
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,847
lovers, everyone comes
out, and there's music.

1289
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:07,580
And the voices ring across the ice.

1290
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:08,413
You'll see.

1291
01:20:08,413 --> 01:20:10,570
Right after lunch, I'll
get you some skates.

1292
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,510
- Are you gonna come, Anthony?

1293
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:16,963
- Oh no, as an athlete,
I'm a wonderful jeweler.

1294
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,457
- We'll hold you up.

1295
01:20:19,457 --> 01:20:21,490
- But you will come scuba diving, right,

1296
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:22,410
on the honeymoon?

1297
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:23,933
- Scuba diving in Vail?

1298
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:27,650
- I changed the tickets.

1299
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:30,103
I thought St. Thomas
would be more romantic

1300
01:20:30,103 --> 01:20:33,380
and fun for all of us.

1301
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:34,920
- Oh.

1302
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,960
Oh, well, I'm sure you're right.

1303
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,880
- Listen, I don't want
you guys to change if--

1304
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,453
- Not at all, I love the beach.

1305
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:44,560
- I'll be back in a minute.

1306
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,520
- Never seen her so happy.

1307
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:53,850
You know, I was very surprised

1308
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:56,610
when she told me about
you and your brother.

1309
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:58,790
- Yes, well, she's very
good at surprising people.

1310
01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:59,653
- Yes, she is.

1311
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,780
We wanna have our own family.

1312
01:21:02,780 --> 01:21:04,860
I mean, you're welcome to stay with us,

1313
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,550
and I'm sure as I get to know
you I'll come to love you,

1314
01:21:07,550 --> 01:21:10,790
but, we wanna have our own children.

1315
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:12,630
You can understand that.

1316
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:13,463
- Sure.

1317
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,590
- So this business with your brother,

1318
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:19,240
you think that'll blow over soon?

1319
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:21,824
- Well, I don't--

1320
01:21:21,824 --> 01:21:22,990
- Because there's a very good prep school

1321
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:25,200
right outside of town,
be a nice way to segue

1322
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,880
to being a family, having him close enough

1323
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,040
to visit on the weekends.

1324
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,200
He'd probably get a much better education

1325
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:31,243
than what he's getting know,

1326
01:21:31,243 --> 01:21:33,160
and there are also excellent
schools for girls here too.

1327
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,490
My nieces attended St. Meredith's.

1328
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:38,290
You can ask them about it
later at the rehearsal dinner.

1329
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,063
- Excuse me.

1330
01:21:48,287 --> 01:21:49,120
- [Daughter] I do not.

1331
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,330
- [Mother] Yes you do, two or three hours

1332
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:51,650
every night on the phone.

1333
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:52,483
- [Daughter] Mother.

1334
01:21:52,483 --> 01:21:53,430
- [Mother] And all day long at school.

1335
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:55,130
- She's my best friend, don't
you want me to have friends?

1336
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:56,770
- Why can't we spend
some time alone together

1337
01:21:56,770 --> 01:21:58,720
for once without Rebecca?

1338
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,083
Is that too much to ask?

1339
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,189
- Hi.

1340
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:06,022
- Hi.

1341
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:09,946
(water running)

1342
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,440
- You okay?

1343
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:16,463
- Yeah, it's just hot in there.

1344
01:22:33,662 --> 01:22:35,829

1359
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:51,770
- We were in the front
yard waiting for Daddy.

1360
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:53,893
And I'm barefoot.

1361
01:23:55,699 --> 01:23:58,049
And the flagstones are
so warm against my feet.

1362
01:23:59,887 --> 01:24:01,470
And we're so close.

1363
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,363
And I know Daddy's coming.

1364
01:24:05,604 --> 01:24:06,510
I just feel so,

1365
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:08,673
safe.

1366
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:12,693
You know what I mean?

1367
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:16,933
Just completely like nothing can hurt me.

1368
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:20,267
I haven't felt that way since.

1369
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,310
It's my favorite memory of you.

1370
01:24:26,357 --> 01:24:29,274
(soft piano music)

1371
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,607
- When I lived in that house,

1372
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,273
there was no flagstone walk.

1373
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:50,283
Your dad must have added it later.

1374
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:55,356
(soft piano music)

1375
01:25:12,948 --> 01:25:13,781
- Mom.

1376
01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:16,723
Mommy.

1377
01:25:17,809 --> 01:25:18,642
Mom.

1378
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,303
Mom.

1379
01:25:21,303 --> 01:25:24,553
(dramatic piano music)

1380
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:47,433
- Up up up, rise and shine.

1381
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:53,193
Good, we have tons to do today.

1382
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,160
What do you wanna do first?

1383
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:58,240
Bikinis and sarongs?

1384
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,010
Or dress pumps?

1385
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:01,560
- You're gonna be so mad at me.

1386
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,393
- What happened?

1387
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:08,518
- You should always
tell you, you said that

1388
01:26:08,518 --> 01:26:11,363
no matter what happened,
I should always tell you.

1389
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:14,610
- Sweetie, what is it?

1390
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:18,023
- I wanna go home.

1391
01:26:21,011 --> 01:26:22,344
- What happened?

1392
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,472
Did Anthony say something?

1393
01:26:24,472 --> 01:26:25,305
- No.

1394
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:26,138
- Did I do something?

1395
01:26:26,138 --> 01:26:26,971
- No.

1396
01:26:27,858 --> 01:26:29,608
I just wanna go home.

1397
01:26:30,505 --> 01:26:32,922
(soft music)

1398
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:37,510
- Okay.

1399
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:39,998
Well, after the wedding, we'll--

1400
01:26:39,998 --> 01:26:40,831
- No.

1401
01:26:43,350 --> 01:26:46,683
I really really wanna go home now.

1402
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:51,240
- Tell me what I did.

1403
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,460
Tell me what I can do.

1404
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:53,293
- Nothing.

1405
01:26:55,356 --> 01:26:59,843
I just, I miss Tandy and
the rest of my friends.

1406
01:27:00,733 --> 01:27:02,843
You know, and my house.

1407
01:27:08,684 --> 01:27:11,597
And I really miss my mom.

1408
01:27:11,597 --> 01:27:14,014
(soft music)

1409
01:27:27,472 --> 01:27:28,305
- Andrea?

1410
01:27:32,839 --> 01:27:34,756
Honey, I'm so glad to--

1411
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:40,800
What are you doing here?

1412
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,503
- Supposed to spend Christmas
with your family, remember?

1413
01:27:46,422 --> 01:27:47,273
- Oh.

1414
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,310
Wait a minute, where are you going?

1415
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:51,274
- [Andrea] Tandy's.

1416
01:27:51,274 --> 01:27:53,573
- But you just got back, Andrea.

1417
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,493
Andrea, come back here.

1418
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:00,310
(laughing)

1419
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,927
(rock music)

1420
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,170
- I brought your sister home.

1421
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,543
- I tore up your cards.

1422
01:28:36,381 --> 01:28:38,464
(crying)

1423
01:28:58,527 --> 01:29:00,998
I can't even remember you.

1424
01:29:00,998 --> 01:29:02,371
No.

1425
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:04,788
(soft music)

1426
01:29:50,929 --> 01:29:52,262
- Wait a minute.

1427
01:29:55,308 --> 01:29:56,475
What happened?

1428
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:58,870
- You were right.

1429
01:30:00,555 --> 01:30:01,555
You're their mother.

1430
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:05,603
- Cathy.

1431
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:15,023
It took you a long time to come back.

1432
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:21,103
It's gonna take them time to accept you.

1433
01:30:36,949 --> 01:30:39,949
- I wanted to say goodbye to Andrea.

1434
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,710
- She's at Tandy's.

1435
01:30:44,332 --> 01:30:47,582
(church bells ringing)

1436
01:30:51,756 --> 01:30:54,089
- I used to hate this place.

1437
01:30:56,514 --> 01:30:57,814
You've done a lot with it.

1438
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:00,613
