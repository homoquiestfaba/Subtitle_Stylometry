1
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:19,361
We spend a ot of time worrying about
career, money, what people will think of us,
and if we' ever find love.

2
00:00:19,796 --> 00:00:23,493
After all, isn't that what life is all about?

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,368
Being in love?

4
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:31,501
If it's meant to be, two people will find each
other.

5
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,979
Turning 50 makes a guy think...

6
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,070
Did I pick the right career?

7
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:40,907
Did I pick the right person?

8
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:43,152
Did I settle?

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,056
Did I force my life to go the way I think it
should have gone?

10
00:00:49,526 --> 00:00:51,494
What will I do with the rest of my life?

11
00:00:52,862 --> 00:00:55,456
I only have about 35 years left.

12
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:03,439
TV: "I won't be a minute."

13
00:01:06,843 --> 00:01:11,212
*scream*

14
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,452
*woman on television*
"I went to get the paper. I turned the latch
off!

15
00:01:19,823 --> 00:01:24,453
"I forgot to turn it on again..."
*sobs*
"He's out there... he was coming in!"

16
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:26,929
You look like you've had better days.

17
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,498
Is it because you're turning 50?

18
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:33,297
I don't know.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

19
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:36,539
I feel disconnected.

20
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:41,871
Oh my god, dude, what happened to my life?

21
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,504
How did I get to be 50?

22
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,446
There's something about those two numbers.

23
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:54,752
I was OK at 49. I didn't feel anything, but
just by those two numbers changing to 50...
It's freaking me out.

24
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:58,853
It's just a number.

25
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,297
That's what you say... until it hits you.

26
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,560
"He's going through that mid-life crisis"

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,267
I never knew what it meant. I never thought
it would be something I would have to deal
with.

28
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:09,839
I didn't think I'd live this long.

29
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:13,342
What exactly is a mid-life crisis, anyway?

30
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:19,975
From what I can tell, It's when you hit that
state of life where you question...

31
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:26,745
... if you've achieved your goals, rate your life
on how happy you are, if you did what you
set out to do by a certain age...

32
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,318
I think I'm going to throw up.

33
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:34,060
I don't guess you can understand, you're not
there yet.

34
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:36,332
Look, man. You take life way too seriously.

35
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,759
You just got to go a long for the ride.

36
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,527
I wish I could be like that.

37
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,704
I came from a poor family.
I always wanted to have more...

38
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:46,806
... for my life.

39
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:51,714
But you seem like you have everything you
could need.

40
00:02:52,315 --> 00:02:54,283
You have a career... and Greg.

41
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,514
There's a lot you don't know about me and
Greg.

42
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:00,789
Yeah, I know Greg is a complete dickhead.

43
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:05,227
I just think you can do better.

44
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:10,933
Are we still having your birthday party?

45
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,599
I guess.
I don't care.

46
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:16,472
Can I bring my cousin, from Indiana?

47
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,865
Indiana?
Yeah, I really think you guys will hit it off.

48
00:03:21,945 --> 00:03:24,277
Indiana, huh? Farm boy, no doubt.

49
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:30,742
Yeah. He's a super cool guy, he's in between
jobs right now and he wanted to come to
town for a visit.

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,088
Sure, bring him a long.

51
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:34,445
What's this?

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,328
The small town where I grew up.

53
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:46,663
My Great Grandma would take me and my
brother every day in the summer to Foster's
Freeze. She'd call it 'Foyster's Freeze'.

54
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,899
Between my Mom and my Grandparents, we
had a whole lot of love.

55
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,372
My Dad didn't seem too interested in me and
my brother.

56
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:59,145
From what Mom says, he never wanted kids.

57
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:04,876
I just don't understand what happened.

58
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:08,885
I was just 23!
Look!

59
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,260
*birds chirping happily*

60
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:27,142
# 'Anytime' plays on the radio #

61
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:56,463
So, are we going to see your parents this
summer?

62
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,936
You keep talking about it, but it never
happens.

63
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:08,908
"Never Happens"?
*scoffs*
What do you mean it never happens?

64
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:15,690
Forget it.

65
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:25,457
I know your parents would like me.
I'm sure they would, babe.

66
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:29,004
It's just...

67
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,207
It's complicated.

68
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,273
Sure it is, Greg.

69
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:40,238
Everything is complicated, isn't it?

70
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:47,154
That's what people say when, they need an
excuse.
When they can't find one.

71
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:55,121
C'mon, Babe. They're going to meet you. I
want them to meet you.

72
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:58,196
Sometime... when it's right.

73
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,370
It'll never be right.

74
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:16,875
Who's this?

75
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,114
Me.

76
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,225
That one's from my eighth birthday party.

77
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,524
My Dad thought it would be a great idea to
have a pinata. I was blindfolded.

78
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:33,595
I finally broke the pinata, a kid shoved me
out of the way to get the candy.

79
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,572
I cried, and my Dad scolded me.

80
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,907
To this day, I stil do not understand the rules
to pinata.

81
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:44,340
Why the birthday kid is blind when the candy
falls.

82
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,750
Yeah, life's real tough when you're 8 years
old.

83
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:54,179
Who's this little chubbie-wubbie?

84
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:57,326
This poor kid looks like he had too many
tacos.

85
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:58,821
That's me, Greg.

86
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:03,632
I was overweight until I was 16.

87
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:10,961
Yep, it's an uphill battle, the older we get.

88
00:07:12,008 --> 00:07:13,976
Weight.
Wrinkles.

89
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:20,205
It's only going to get harder now that you're
turning 50.

90
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:33,889
Hey, we're doing Saturday alone tomorrow,
right?
No business.

91
00:07:34,697 --> 00:07:38,861
Yeah yeah yeah babe, just pick out some
romantic movies.

92
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:45,131
I'll make breakfast for us when I get back
from the gym and we'll have our alone day
together.

93
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,364
Gym?

94
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:49,912
On your day off?

95
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:53,182
Well, yeah, I mean I'll get back early. Go
early.

96
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,042
You won't even be here to sleep in with me.
Great.

97
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:59,354
Hey, I'll be back in time for breakfast.

98
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:04,791
No, it won't be early Greg. It' be 12 or 1.
You know, it's always the same.

99
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:13,625
Go to the gym, talk to your friends, work
out, take some business calls, stop by the
office and then you'll finally make it back
here.

100
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:20,576
Look at me.
I'm going to be a fatty if I keep eating the
food and meals that you keep making for
me.

101
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,746
Alright, maybe this is OK for you, but it's not
OK for me.

102
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:31,116
That's what the gym is for Greg, to burn off
the calories.

103
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:39,627
You know, I do 2 days at the gym, and 2
days walking. I'm not going to make myself a
complete lunatic like you.

104
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,896
Look, babe. You don't have to get upset over
this, I was just stating a fact.

105
00:08:49,138 --> 00:08:52,437
Then you won't be needing this cake I made
for you.

106
00:08:57,113 --> 00:09:02,244
Hey listen. Come on, I didn't mean to make
you fee bad. OK?

107
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:04,979
It's beautiful, alright?

108
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,187
That's exactly what I'm talking about. It's...

109
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:17,156
We have cake or pie once a week, Greg.
Once a week.

110
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:20,836
Don't you think that...

111
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:42,350
Things are starting to come together on this
deal.

112
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,729
That's good, Greg. Really great.

113
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,126
How are things in the, uh...

114
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,269
Indie movie business.

115
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,999
Kinda slow. The economy.

116
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:05,544
I had an hour long call with my distributor
today.

117
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:08,010
Oh yeah?
How did that go?

118
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:11,720
It didn't go like I hoped it would.

119
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:13,612
Hows that?

120
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:19,626
DVD is dying. Everything is going streaming,
and people aren't buying.

121
00:10:21,197 --> 00:10:24,496
They said they aren't sure they can take my
next film.

122
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:29,728
They told me, in so many words, that they
aren't interested.

123
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,541
They suggested that I go with another
distributor.

124
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,972
That could be good?

125
00:10:38,748 --> 00:10:43,947
There are just some business things to work
through if I'm going to get this next movie
made.

126
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:53,218
Maybe it's time for you to start doing
something that could bring you some real
money.

127
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,332
I... don't understand.

128
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,497
I've been doing this for 12 years, I bring in
some real money.

129
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:08,708
I think it's time to stop playing Movie Guy,
and maybe get serious about your life.

130
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:11,810
Before you get too old.

131
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:18,911
Greg, I love movies. I got into this business
because I want to entertain people.

132
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,486
There are just some business things I have
to work through.

133
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:36,836
Did I ever tell you how I got into this
business?

134
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:44,004
I was 15 and some friends of mine...

135
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:49,878
You guys went and saw Jaws, I know.
You've told me.

136
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,741
Do you love me?

137
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:17,779
Do I love you?

138
00:12:22,685 --> 00:12:24,653
What kind of question is that?

139
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:36,997
Babe, I just think it's time that you do
something. Something you can enjoy the
rest of your life.

140
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:42,432
You mean something you approve of?
I don't have to approve of anything.

141
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,777
You've had your fun, you've made youre little
film projects.

142
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:58,443
Where did it get you?
Look at you. 12 years older and you're still
wishing you can be the next Spielberg.

143
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:03,617
Babe. There's on y one Spielberg.

144
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:07,859
For your information, Greg, I'm completely
aware that there is only 1 Spielberg.

145
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:15,535
You know, people aspire to be great film
makers with big ideas.

146
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:23,406
But I've always been realistic about my
career. All I ever wanted was to make decent
films.

147
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,613
I don't have to be Spielberg, I don't want to
be Spielberg.

148
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:31,378
But we see a movie like Jaws and we say
"Hey, that's what I want to do. Make
movies!".

149
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:41,694
But it's a different world, Greg, things have
changed. It's a different business... you have
no idea how this business operates.

150
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:46,493
Now I'm fairly sure you have no idea who I
am.

151
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:51,039
Look at me.

152
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:55,410
I went to college for 4 years.

153
00:13:57,146 --> 00:14:05,986
I have a degree. Because my parents kept
pushing me, to do something... to want
something better.

154
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:10,125
So I finally got throught it. I did it.

155
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,956
I made something of myself.

156
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:21,233
I just wish...
You wish I had done something with my life.

157
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:25,941
That I had taken a different road?

158
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:29,144
That I'd finally see the light?

159
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:33,114
So you could be proud of me, show me off to
your parents. Right?

160
00:14:33,482 --> 00:14:35,450
You're not proud of me.

161
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:43,682
I know you wish you didn't have to be
embarrassed of me aroudn your stuck up Ivy
League friends.

162
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,236
So I'll ask you again.

163
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:59,173
Greg, do you love me?

164
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,575
I'm sorry I hurt your feellings.

165
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,248
It wasn't my intentions.

166
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,584
What were your intentions?

167
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:17,959
I guess I have my answer.

168
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,889
Your answer. What does that mean you have
your answer?

169
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:24,196
If you love me.
Babe, you know I love you.

170
00:15:28,037 --> 00:15:33,669
Look, I have this business trip coming up.
Can we just talk about this when I get back,
please?

171
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:36,544
Yeah.

172
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:51,860
Maybe we should break up for a while, you
know?

173
00:15:53,595 --> 00:15:56,564
Just until you figure out whatever it is that
you want.

174
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:09,504
I'm here for you, if you want to talk, but you
need a break from me.

175
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:17,348
Ya know? We have so many differences.

176
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,225
You could use some time to do some soul
searching.

177
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:38,106
We could talk about it more when I get back.

178
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,508
Later.

179
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:50,106
*yawns*
I'm going to hit the sheets.

180
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:57,690
I mean, I can stay with Jack and Hannah for
a few weeks until we get us worked out.

181
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:02,230
They have an extra bedroom.

182
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:31,957
*Greg snoring*

183
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,162
OK, you look like a sad puppy today. Are you
going to tell me what's going on?

184
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:14,733
Did something happen between you and
Greg?

185
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:23,067
We broke up.
I guess.
I don't know.

186
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,047
What?

187
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:32,615
He left on a business trip. He wants me to
work on my life's plan while he is away.

188
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,460
Go ahead. Say it.
What?

189
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:51,466
Finally!
I mean... oh... God... what happened?
Didn't he like his dinner.

190
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,677
I don't know. I'll figure this all out and let
you know.

191
00:18:56,211 --> 00:19:07,418
I'm sorry. I know this must be hard for you.
I'm your best friend and I should be
supportive, but it's no secret that I did not
like Greg.

192
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,824
I don't know what you saw in him.
He is a cold bastard.

193
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,924
I'm sorry if that doesn't make you feel better,
but it makes me feel better.

194
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:22,963
Come on, you're such a genuinely nice guy
and I hate seeing you so upset all the time.

195
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:28,199
This is a good thing! You'll see!
And my cousin is still coming to visit and will
be staying with me for a while.

196
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,545
I want you to meet him.

197
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:35,509
*laughs*
What? Come on, he's a loner, you're a loner.
You guys would be great friends.

198
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,753
I just broke up and you've already got me
dating?

199
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:47,356
No, no not dating.
He's just a coold guy, and frankly... I... don't
even... know if he's into guys.

200
00:19:48,997 --> 00:19:50,965
Uh, maybe.

201
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,036
He's shy, and I think people take advantage
of him.

202
00:19:56,505 --> 00:20:00,771
I want to see him with someone great.
He means a lot to me.
OK?

203
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,978
Listen, I'll have him message you.

204
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:07,649
You know, I think you settled when it came
to Greg.

205
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,918
I didn't settle.

206
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:15,990
I don't think I did.

207
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,728
I thought I was in love with him.

208
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:27,125
James, I'm almost 50.
I'm supposed to be happy and in love.
You know?

209
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:37,476
I see this in a lot of people, you know?
People would rather be sort of OK and they'll
do whatever it takes just to not be a one.

210
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:39,847
Do you really want that?

211
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:44,982
Do you want to sort of be in love and sort of
not in love and completely unfulfilled?

212
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:52,893
You know, he always just wanted to be
romantic when it was on his terms.

213
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:58,689
I, frankly would rather be single and
libertated than unhappy and disconnected for
the rest of my life.

214
00:20:59,034 --> 00:21:01,002
There.
I said it, mister.

215
00:21:01,903 --> 00:21:05,999
I guess I never expected much because I
didn't want to let myself down.

216
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:16,017
I don't know what to do.

217
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:18,319
Things are just getting to me.

218
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,888
You know what?

219
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,292
See this, James?
Do you know what this is?

220
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,129
It's a state-issued food stamp.

221
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:32,493
My mom used to have to use these to feed
me and my brother when we were kids.

222
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,304
That's nothing to be embarrassed about.

223
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:43,203
That's great James.
The point is, I carry this with me to remind
me to work hard in my life and never et this
happen to me.

224
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:48,174
It mocks me and reminds me that if I use
this I have failed as a man.

225
00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:51,151
I don't know what the answers are, can you
tell me?

226
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:56,187
I'm going to make damn sure I don't end up
on food stamps.

227
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:00,094
I'm almost 50 years old.

228
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:02,329
I'm supposed to be financially secure.

229
00:22:02,564 --> 00:22:07,934
I'm supposed to have a husband, and a dog
and be enjoying a Doris Day Life!

230
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:14,776
I don't know.

231
00:22:19,815 --> 00:22:23,080
I guess I'll get another job to help out until
things get better.

232
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:27,488
Oh, and I got another call back from another
distributor today.

233
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:34,525
They said they will take my next movie if I'll
do a 50/50 deal plus pay all of the marketing
costs. This business is a trap!

234
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:40,565
We did you tell them no?
Of Course! It won't even cover the movie's
costs... it's ridiculous!

235
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:45,866
I just want my camera crane shot over the
Kansas wheat feilds.

236
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,036
Okay, come on.
You need a drink.

237
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:55,572
I need a drink. Great.
I'm going to be a drunk just like all the other
writers and directors.

238
00:22:55,917 --> 00:23:00,251
Well, at east you will be part of a crowd
that's lonely at the top.

239
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:03,324
Come one, things'll be OK David.

240
00:23:03,592 --> 00:23:11,465
You know, life has it's own plan, I guess.
And Greg isn't worth giving up hope for.

241
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,160
Maybe life has a new future mapped out for
you, something completely different.

242
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:19,303
A new husband, maybe?
*clink*

243
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:23,838
All my friends used to try to get me to go out
to bars and clubs.

244
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,647
"You'll never find anyone if you stay at
home."

245
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:32,079
I used to think I would be single all my life,
and I was OK with that.

246
00:23:36,324 --> 00:23:38,292
Then I met Greg.

247
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:41,829
I thought he was the one.

248
00:23:46,902 --> 00:23:53,705
You know, I jused to joke that I was holding
out for my Indiana farmboy?

249
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:58,776
Hey, you know, I'm from Indiana.
There are some really good people there.

250
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:06,511
Oh, GOD no way.
No way! Haha

251
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:11,016
I rekon the Gods have something else in
mind for us.

252
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:14,751
Come on. Let's go make some margaritas
and get smashed!

253
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,625
Things'll be OK David.
I promise.

254
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:29,138
*typing & clicking*

255
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,178
*knock knock knock*

256
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:44,167
*knock knock knock*

257
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,618
Hi, uh... Shane!

258
00:26:50,852 --> 00:26:52,786
Hi, David, yes hi. Hello.

259
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,156
It's nice to meet you, in person.
Yeah, you too. Wellcome.
Sorry, come on in.

260
00:27:03,765 --> 00:27:06,563
Can I get you a drink or something?
I've got water/coke/beer...

261
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:10,237
I'll have a beer. Thanks.
Have a seat.

262
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:22,911
So, you said on Facebook that you were
really into video games?

263
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:26,687
Yeah. Yeah, I play them a the time.

264
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:32,259
*both at once*

265
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,053
Sorry.

266
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,498
So, you like horror movies.

267
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:41,557
Yeah, mostly 40's and 50's sci-fi horror.

268
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,171
Oh, I love those. I'm a big fan of 70's horror
movies.

269
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:46,874
Race with the Devil, Piranha...

270
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:50,072
Oh my god, you are an awesome person, I
love those movies.

271
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:58,083
you know, talking to you on Facebook, I
couldn't believe the number of interests that
you and I had in common.

272
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,021
That's pretty cool.

273
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:03,224
I'm a huge Peter Cushing fan.

274
00:28:03,491 --> 00:28:04,150
Mm.

275
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:07,121
Oh, I see. You don't know who he is.

276
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:09,563
I'm embarrassed.
I should know who he is.

277
00:28:09,798 --> 00:28:10,992
It's Ok, you are younger than me by...

278
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:13,401
I guess I'm more familiar with 80's movies.

279
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:18,598
I used to sleep in the living room, so I'd
watch a lot of TV.

280
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:20,975
Oh yeah?

281
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:27,237
Yeah, my family was pretty poor, so we
always lived in small places.

282
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,384
My parents and sisters would get the
bedrooms.

283
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:34,020
I never thought much about it. I guess I
always thought it was pretty cool.

284
00:28:34,322 --> 00:28:36,813
I guess I could watch movies anytime.

285
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:40,761
I read a lot too.
I read a lot.

286
00:28:43,531 --> 00:28:45,499
Are you close with your family now?

287
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,438
Yeah, yeah I am. My parents gave me and
my sisters a lot of love. We had a pretty
good upbringing.

288
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:55,943
I had a... similar youth.

289
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:57,838
We moved a lot as kids.

290
00:28:58,146 --> 00:29:06,144
My dad decided he wanted to be a
pentecostal preacher. We lived in a lot of
towns, and a few states.

291
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:12,515
So I'd stay up late at night and watch
Creature Feature.

292
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,762
They showed a lot of horror movies.
I was hooked.

293
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,765
Eh, I'm rambling.

294
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:22,535
No no no, I like hearing you talk. I just don't
know all there is to know about horror
movies.

295
00:29:23,004 --> 00:29:25,837
The rest of my time is spent playing retro
videogames.

296
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:28,609
Oh, retro games.

297
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:32,638
Yeah, I'm a big fan of 70's and 80's games.

298
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:35,015
I have, hundreds of them.

299
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:41,815
My folks couldn't afford the cartridges. I'd
get them one or two a year.

300
00:29:42,257 --> 00:29:44,225
Birthday, Christmas...

301
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:53,030
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
I don't do well with a lot of people.
I'm very shy, I get nervous...

302
00:29:53,535 --> 00:29:55,503
Oh no, you're doing fine.
You're doing fine.

303
00:29:56,871 --> 00:30:03,037
Yeah, I'm not the most social guy myself.
I've had to be, but I don't like it much.

304
00:30:03,878 --> 00:30:08,212
Domestic type. Be in your own safe
environement, then you don't have to talk to
people.

305
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,518
Exactly. You get it.

306
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:15,923
I feel bad I've never heard of you.

307
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:17,914
You mean my movies?

308
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:20,361
Yeah.
I looked you up, and then I knew.

309
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:25,127
Don't feel bad. How would you know about
me? I'm just a small indie film maker.

310
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:30,698
I did make one thriller. It did we at first.
Then tanked.

311
00:30:31,806 --> 00:30:37,608
It was supposed to be a silly,
tounge-in-cheek ghost story.

312
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:40,114
I guess everyone wants everything perfect.
Sex, Gore...
"More sex! More Gore!"

313
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:43,140
It's hard to figure out.

314
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,187
A lot of my fans want me to make more
romance/dramas.

315
00:30:49,824 --> 00:30:53,817
Since most of them are about small-town
life, I guess I'd like to live most of them
myself.

316
00:30:54,262 --> 00:30:56,230
You should try the midwest!
Indiana? Eh?

317
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:00,701
Heh, sorry, that was stupid.

318
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:06,574
I'd like to see your movies.
Maybe on our next movie night?

319
00:31:08,776 --> 00:31:11,370
How about you watch them alone and then
you can judge them in privacy.

320
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:12,202
Ha Ha

321
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:20,444
Hey, do you got some time to stay? For
a while? I've got some frozen pizza...

322
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:21,552
Could put on some movies...

323
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:27,116
Uh, yeah. I don't have anything else to do
today. Pizza sounds great.

324
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:32,263
Yeah? You pick out the movies and I'll get the
pizza in the oven.

325
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:40,296
So you say you like older videogames.

326
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,744
Yeah, I have been doing so since I was little.

327
00:31:46,314 --> 00:31:50,410
I'm not very coordinated.
I get... stressed with videogames.

328
00:31:50,718 --> 00:31:51,878
Wanna play one?

329
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:54,622
You mean a videogame?
Right now?

330
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,924
Yeah, right now, don't look so terrified.

331
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,927
Yeah. Here.

332
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:04,927
I don't know about this.
It's all right. No one is watching and I won't
make fun of you.

333
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,293
We'll start with something easy.
Ok, what do I do?

334
00:32:09,237 --> 00:32:11,205
So... left.

335
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:13,229
Just start going forward.

336
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:15,509
Go forward. It's this one.
Oh.

337
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,978
Back... wait, no wait...
Ohhhh...

338
00:32:18,846 --> 00:32:20,814
Up?
No, gotta start over. That's alright.

339
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:22,538
Ok. Take it.

340
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:26,878
And this pushes the...
No no, go forward with that, and this steers.

341
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:28,417
Ok.

342
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:33,027
Good, Good. You have 2 lives.

343
00:32:33,728 --> 00:32:35,696
No no, come back...
No... you do it.

344
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,132
All right, watch. You push forward, I'll steer.

345
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,468
Ok, push... Ok... that's not going to work.

346
00:32:41,903 --> 00:32:43,871
Oh, no, you fire!
Please.
Ok.

347
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:46,306
Push. Ready?
Go right.

348
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:47,701
Ok, now stop.

349
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:50,144
Jump up.
See?
Yeah.

350
00:32:50,611 --> 00:32:51,635
Wait.
No.
Wait...

351
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:10,097
Great cake, David!
Happy birthday!

352
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,366
Where's the mister today?

353
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:17,060
Mmm. He's gone. On a business trip. And
from David's life. Isn't that right, David?

354
00:33:17,939 --> 00:33:19,907
What?
Thanks, James.

355
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:27,870
We're just celebrating the old days gone of
David being jerked around by Greg, and
celebrating his new life full of happiness.

356
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:31,251
How come I didn't hear about it before now?

357
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,355
Sorry Ace, I'm not sure if it's final.

358
00:33:36,824 --> 00:33:38,792
Oh, but it is final, isn't it David?

359
00:33:39,494 --> 00:33:41,860
So, what happened?
How did this come to be?

360
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:46,063
Oh, yes David.
Please tell us how this all came to be.

361
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:49,303
*sighs*
So, how's the cake?

362
00:33:52,774 --> 00:33:57,939
So, how are you doing with it, David?
Turning the big 50?

363
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,008
Scared?
Frantic?
Having panic attacks every 8 hours?

364
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:08,652
Yes, it's true.
I'm now 50.

365
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:12,326
How's that working out for you?

366
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,398
Ok, you want to know how I'm handling it?

367
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,994
Well...

368
00:34:21,502 --> 00:34:24,471
It seems life doesn't go according to plan.
Does it Ace?

369
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:26,297
No.

370
00:34:26,874 --> 00:34:30,833
By the time I was 14, I knew I wanted to
make movies.

371
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:37,181
By the time I was 16, my parents were
divorced, and I had to put my dreams aside.

372
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,153
I went to work at other jobs, to help my
mom and brother.

373
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:48,488
My dad had left us in his mid-life crisis, and
he didn't give my mom one penny to support
us.

374
00:34:49,363 --> 00:34:53,697
So, she had to work 3 jobs to raise 2 teenage
boys.

375
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:57,327
If not for my grandparents he ping us, well...

376
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:08,108
So, by 18 I had no money for film school.
I wasn't even sure, then, if that's what I
even wanted to do.

377
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:12,553
But, I knew one thing.

378
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:21,787
By age 20, I would someday meet a great
guy.

379
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,799
Have a wonderful husband.

380
00:35:26,234 --> 00:35:28,202
Three dogs.

381
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,766
A country house, complete with a Doris Day
pool and garden.
*laughs*

382
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:38,775
That's what I was sure would happen.
At least, I hoped it would, anyway.

383
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:52,087
So I've lived in four different states.
Eighteen different houses in twelve different
towns.

384
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,294
Still, I've managed to keep my vision clear
this whole time.

385
00:35:54,629 --> 00:36:00,397
Doing films, striving for that big break.
Having that house in the country and...

386
00:36:01,535 --> 00:36:03,503
... now I'm 50.

387
00:36:07,975 --> 00:36:09,943
I live in a condo.

388
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:12,145
That Greg owns.

389
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,018
And he doesn't seem to love me.

390
00:36:22,657 --> 00:36:24,625
Somehow, I don't think my life plan is going
to happen.

391
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:36,331
Is that about right?
Did I cover everything? James?

392
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:40,031
Um...

393
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:44,544
Anyone want more cake?

394
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:51,049
I guess that's what you call a mid-life crisis.

395
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:58,585
You know, I always wondered what I had to
look forward to.

396
00:36:58,826 --> 00:37:03,422
I never thought I'd get older, you know?
Especially in my early twenties, I mean, who
did?

397
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:10,331
I remember people telling me that when I
turned 25, the years would go by so...
fast.

398
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:14,074
That was 14 years ago.

399
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:19,479
God. I'm going to get older.

400
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,848
There's no way out of it.

401
00:37:22,316 --> 00:37:30,416
I just...
In 5 years from now I'm going to be in the
middle of my life.

402
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,985
I don't know how I'm going to handle that.

403
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:38,665
Oh god, now I'm depressed.

404
00:37:40,534 --> 00:37:45,369
You need some more frosting. Here, have
some more cake.
*all laughs*

405
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:51,812
You know what? If I'm going to get old and
die, why does it matter how much money I
make or how many calories I eat?

406
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:54,214
Seconds.

407
00:37:56,684 --> 00:37:58,652
Well, I keep going.
I keep trying.

408
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:01,655
I keep thinking.

409
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,791
You know? Maybe it is time I do something
else with my life.

410
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:09,856
I've got about 35 years left.
If my health holds out.

411
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:14,199
You know, I never thought I'd live to hear the
words:

412
00:38:14,435 --> 00:38:17,529
"You really should get a colon exam at your
age."
Hahahahahaha

413
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:26,003
I never thought I'd that I'd hear you saying
that you were worrying about 50.

414
00:38:27,381 --> 00:38:29,349
That has kind of taken me aback.

415
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:32,052
I don't understand.

416
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:36,023
Life is phases we go through.

417
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:39,192
50 is a phase.

418
00:38:40,895 --> 00:38:44,228
This is the great time of life, in your 50's.

419
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:46,956
Because you have this background.

420
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:49,336
Half a century of background.

421
00:38:49,737 --> 00:38:54,231
Now you can take what you learned and put
it into real use.

422
00:38:54,575 --> 00:38:56,543
We're talking about your career.

423
00:38:56,777 --> 00:38:58,711
This should be the hightlight of your career
time.

424
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,035
It should be.

425
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:04,783
And I know it probably will be if you got your
act together.

426
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:07,684
50 is irrelevant.

427
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:10,190
78 is irrelevant.

428
00:39:11,258 --> 00:39:12,691
30 is irrelevant.

429
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,257
*whispers*
And 40 is irrelevant.

430
00:39:14,495 --> 00:39:15,587
That's all.

431
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,892
Just stages.
In our life, that's all.

432
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,964
Oh god, you guys get me going on stuff like
this. Cramp.

433
00:39:24,305 --> 00:39:28,241
What am I going to do with you?
I'm going to hit you with my purse, that's
what I'm going to do with you.

434
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:33,747
But I love you, you know that.

435
00:39:34,014 --> 00:39:38,178
And I'm so glad you chose me to be your
friend.

436
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:40,780
It's the best thing in the world.

437
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:45,083
Well, I'm never getting old.

438
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:49,096
Sorry, I don't really do jokes.

439
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:53,960
I don't know.

440
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,137
To be honest, I never really minded getting
older.

441
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:04,834
I made peace with the very simple truth that
one day I'll die.

442
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:07,314
No real way of changing that.

443
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:10,707
You know, Ace, like you said. I'm in
my... uh...

444
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:13,286
I'm in my 30's.

445
00:40:13,654 --> 00:40:15,622
I'm in my 30's phase.
I'm right in the middle of that.

446
00:40:16,524 --> 00:40:18,492
It's been good so far.

447
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:23,597
I'm pretty lucky in that I have a pretty teriffic
family.

448
00:40:24,365 --> 00:40:26,333
I know that no matter what, I'm going to
always be happy.

449
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:29,325
Of which one member is sitting right in front
of me.

450
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,503
I have as good as a cousin as I could ever
hope for.

451
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:34,804
Yeah.
But... I don't know... I mean...

452
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:39,205
I guess if worse comes to worse, I could just
marry a videogame. *laughs*

453
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,516
That's pretty much the definition of my
happiness.

454
00:40:49,924 --> 00:40:51,892
Who knows, David.

455
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,923
Maybe there's a greater purpose in your life.

456
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:57,824
Maybe you just don't know it yet.

457
00:40:58,098 --> 00:41:00,259
And it's right in front of you.

458
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:13,205
David!

459

460
00:41:14,582 --> 00:41:16,072
*clears throat*

461
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,647
David?

462
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:24,024
Happy Birthday!

463
00:41:29,263 --> 00:41:30,628
Hey... uh...

464
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:39,005
I...
I didn't know if I should come by.

465
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:47,514
It's your house.

466
00:41:48,315 --> 00:41:49,441
Yeah.

467
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,485
Yeah, it's just... I want you to stay here.

468
00:41:58,092 --> 00:42:00,060
Until... uh...

469
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,862
Us.

470
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,134
If there's a future.

471
00:42:10,337 --> 00:42:12,305
Yeah.

472
00:42:17,978 --> 00:42:19,946
So, uh...

473
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:24,484
How are things?

474
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:28,255
Alright.
Yeah?

475
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:30,513
I guess.

476
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,563
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Oh yeah? You know what? Me too!

477
00:42:36,964 --> 00:42:38,932
Yeah, I've been doing a ot of thinking.

478
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:43,603
Yeah, umm... I mean...
Look...

479
00:42:44,138 --> 00:42:48,131
It was wrong of me to say some of those
things to you. I get that. I know.

480
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,781
If you want to eat junk food...
I shouldn't pick on you.

481
00:43:00,988 --> 00:43:02,956
And I should support you.

482
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,458
Your career choices.

483
00:43:06,827 --> 00:43:16,168
I know... maybe... sometimes... you can be a
little too sensitive...

484
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:20,001
I don't think I'm too sensitive.

485
00:43:22,743 --> 00:43:33,085
Even if I am...
I just want to be sure that, sometimes, my
life is the one I want with the person I want.

486
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,460
You know, Greg, I have busted my ass for
years to make somethign of my life.

487
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:52,229
I'm not sure sometimes if I'm doing it right,
but shouldn't that be OK?

488
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:56,869
If I talk it out.
If I'm allowed to express my thoughts and
my feelings.

489
00:43:57,344 --> 00:44:00,142
Yeah, fine. Look, listen... that's great.

490
00:44:00,748 --> 00:44:06,243
I want you to do that, and if you want me...
I can be that for you.

491
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:13,050
Just...

492
00:44:16,797 --> 00:44:18,765
Just give me another chance.

493
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:27,568
How about we have your birthday dinner
together.

494
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,678
Just the two of us.

495
00:44:32,112 --> 00:44:33,636
Tomorrow night.

496
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:36,416
I'll give you a break from me tonight.

497
00:44:37,751 --> 00:44:39,719
Tomorrow can be you and me.

498
00:44:40,988 --> 00:44:42,956
Alone.

499
00:44:47,928 --> 00:44:49,896
I have to think about things.

500
00:44:51,665 --> 00:44:53,633
*softly*
Think about it.

501
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:13,313
Eh?
Eh?
*laughter*

502
00:45:18,492 --> 00:45:22,258
Maybe there is hope for us.
Yeah, that's all I'm asking.

503
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,898
Come on.

504
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:29,124
You know, I'm really not as bad as your
friend James makes me out to be.

505
00:45:34,675 --> 00:45:36,643
*kiss*

506
00:45:38,946 --> 00:45:40,914
Besides...

507
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:44,417
Once you and I get worked out...

508
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:50,316
Maybe you and I can figure out how to get
you back to school...

509
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:52,256
*kiss*

510
00:45:54,027 --> 00:45:55,995
... and then work on a new career.

511
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:00,967
Improve on your life a little bit.

512
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:07,707
*kiss*

513
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:11,010
Yeah.

514
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,377
Take away some of that insecurity that you
have. You know?

515
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:22,084
I know you aren't as happy as you could be.

516
00:46:25,425 --> 00:46:27,689
You just need to make some changes.

517
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:39,873
*loud yawn*
Oh, boy.

518
00:46:40,874 --> 00:46:44,207
Well...
*sniffs*
I'd better get going.

519
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,843
It's up early, and back to they gym before
work.

520
00:46:58,125 --> 00:46:59,717
*kiss*

521
00:47:02,596 --> 00:47:04,564
*mild laughter*

522
00:47:06,066 --> 00:47:08,034
Hey, Greg...

523
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:13,006
You really had me there.

524
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:22,871
That you really care about me, my life, all of
things you said...

525
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:34,727
I think what you want is someone who...

526
00:47:35,162 --> 00:47:39,155
... you can show off.

527
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:43,129
Someone you can take home to mom and
dad.

528
00:47:44,071 --> 00:47:52,001
Someone who is pretty and well-built.
Someone who is scrubbed up and...

529
00:47:52,346 --> 00:47:54,314
... your equal.

530
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:56,943
But that person isn't me.
What are you saying?

531
00:47:57,417 --> 00:47:59,385
I like who I am.

532
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,954
I like that I was raised by my mom and my
oakie grandparents.

533
00:48:05,692 --> 00:48:08,354
I like that I come from a good upbringing.

534
00:48:08,829 --> 00:48:11,263
You know, maybe we didn't have everything,
but I had what I needed.

535
00:48:15,168 --> 00:48:17,136
You'd never want to take me home to your
parents.

536
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:19,639
I'm not from the right side of the tracks.

537
00:48:21,808 --> 00:48:24,675
You know, maybe I don't make enough
money, but maybe I never will.

538
00:48:24,978 --> 00:48:29,074
Maybe I'll always like fried baloney
sandwiches and walks in the country.

539
00:48:34,154 --> 00:48:36,122
At the end of the day I can live with my
choices.

540
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:41,594
I need to make the right choice...

541
00:48:46,566 --> 00:48:48,534
... about us.

542
00:48:55,575 --> 00:48:57,543
You're saying no?

543
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:14,617
I'll stay with James until I get this figured out
and...

544
00:49:15,062 --> 00:49:17,030
No no no no, it's fine, it's fine.

545
00:49:17,431 --> 00:49:19,399
Just stay here, whatever.
*sniff*

546
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,068
A week, two weeks, it's fine.

547
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:05,011
*water running*

548
00:51:10,677 --> 00:51:13,441
*rain, wind & thunder*

549
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,749
*honk honk*

550
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:05,855
... so I moved to Oregon, for a year to help
my grandfather.

551
00:53:08,595 --> 00:53:10,563
Wound up living there for three years.

552
00:53:11,131 --> 00:53:13,099
Wrote a few of my scripts there.

553
00:53:14,401 --> 00:53:16,369
In the cold of winter.

554
00:53:18,772 --> 00:53:20,740
I had no friends, no social life.

555
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,709
Just me and my dog.

556
00:53:26,146 --> 00:53:29,809
I was glad to do it.
Glad to help my grandpa through his final
years.

557
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:36,518
It humbles you fast when you see how fast
life goes.

558
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:40,954
When we all end up in the same position
when we're old.

559
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:43,229
You were really great to do that.

560
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,499
A lot of people would have never even gotten
involved.

561
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:52,297
My parents were really great to me and my
sisters.

562
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:54,607
I was just a happy kid playing videogames.

563
00:53:56,876 --> 00:54:00,403
Other than wanting us get good grades in
school and be good poeple,

564
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,114
They never pressured us to do anything that
didn't make us happy.

565
00:54:06,019 --> 00:54:10,820
Maybe I should have worried more about the
future, or had bigger goals.

566
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:13,326
I'm basically happy.

567
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:19,121
When I was twelve, my dad came to me and
said that we were moving again.

568
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:25,529
He had a new job, so we had to move to the
next town over and change schools.
The whole thing.

569
00:54:28,074 --> 00:54:31,339
We used to have this cool, blue Chevy van,
1980's model.

570
00:54:32,012 --> 00:54:39,043
One day, on his way to the plastics factory,
the drive train broke, so he called to say that
he would be late.

571
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:48,424
So, after three years with the company...
- Perfect job record
- Never missed a day
- Never called in late
- Never was sick

572
00:54:48,762 --> 00:54:51,287
The dickhead called him and said to not even
bother coming in.

573
00:54:56,236 --> 00:54:59,728
He always felt bad that he was just a worker
bee. He always wanted more for us.

574
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:09,945
After seeing how my dad never did much
with his life...
I wanted more.

575
00:55:13,753 --> 00:55:16,517
He called me a dreamer, told me to get real.

576
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,556
Get a job, any job.
Making movies won't pay the bills.

577
00:55:21,528 --> 00:55:23,826
You should be proud of what you have done.
It's more than most people.

578
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:26,165
It seems like you have really busted your ass
for all of these years.

579
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:31,363
Never expexted or wanted to get rich. I just
wanted to do what I love.

580
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:33,839
Aren't you doing just that?

581
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,904
Make a movie every year or so, live the life
the way you want?

582
00:55:37,477 --> 00:55:41,140
So your plan didn't take you to be a big time
Hollywood director.

583
00:55:42,148 --> 00:55:45,845
OK, so you're an Indie film maker, with some
really good films under your belt.

584
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:49,681
I mean, hey, most good films come from
guys like you.

585
00:55:50,156 --> 00:55:51,020
*thunder*

586
00:55:55,595 --> 00:55:58,621
Oh, um... I should probably get going.
You probably want to get to bed.

587
00:55:58,998 --> 00:56:02,627
Oh, no no no! I'm going to be up for hours.
I usually stay up to one or two in the
morning, playing videogames.

588
00:56:03,269 --> 00:56:05,237
Plus, it's pouring out.

589
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,006
You know what?
I'd love another beer.

590
00:56:11,311 --> 00:56:12,175
Hey, uh...
Um...

591
00:56:14,814 --> 00:56:19,842
I'm going to a film festival next weekend.
They are showing one of my movies.

592
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:26,055
They're giving me a free place to stay... and
I didn't know if you wanted to go with me
and...
Yes.

593
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:28,984
I would love to go.
That would be... cool.

594
00:56:29,496 --> 00:56:31,464
Really?

595
00:56:32,165 --> 00:56:34,133
Great!

596
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,938
*birds chirping, car tires on wet roads*

597
00:56:46,045 --> 00:56:48,013
"Looks like eight or ten out there now"

598
00:56:50,049 --> 00:56:52,017
"There are a lot out back too!"

599
00:56:55,355 --> 00:56:57,323
*glass breaking, dramatic music*

600
00:57:13,873 --> 00:57:15,841
You know, this movie really scared the crap
out of me when I was a kid.

601
00:57:16,676 --> 00:57:18,644
They're coming to get you, Barbra!

602
00:57:19,412 --> 00:57:21,380
You do that really good.
Ha! Thank you.

603
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:27,845
There you go again, making me think you
are this awesome guy that has the same
interests as me.

604
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,591
You really notice details.
You're smart.

605
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:36,395
Oh, you!
Go on.

606
00:57:38,364 --> 00:57:40,332
Plus, I don't think most people would say I'm
smart.

607
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:49,365
Sometimes people confuse social anxiety or
shyness for being dumb or stuck up, but...

608
00:57:50,276 --> 00:57:52,767
You know what... that's their issue.

609
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:56,849
I think you're a great guy.

610
00:57:57,951 --> 00:58:00,715
I've only known you a couple of weeks.

611
00:58:02,522 --> 00:58:07,016
Believe me, by the time you turn 50, you
really shouldn't care about what people think
of you.

612
00:58:10,129 --> 00:58:12,097
I really liked the movie.
Uh...
Your movie.

613
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:15,432
I liked being a part of it.
The film festival, I've never been to one.

614
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,361
It always makes me a bit anxious, having to
talk to a room of about two hundred or so
people.

615
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:22,675
You pulled it off well.

616
00:58:23,643 --> 00:58:27,602
The story really moved me.
You're a good writer... sincere.

617
00:58:28,982 --> 00:58:31,746
Small town, down home.

618
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:37,315
I've tried other styles, but I keep hitting
blocks.

619
00:58:38,925 --> 00:58:43,191
I keep coming back to small town life.
Places where most of us come from.

620
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:46,031
People must like your movies.

621
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:47,896
I don't know...
I guess.

622
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:53,861
I keep getting ripped apart in reviews, for
being sappy.

623
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:56,809
So what?
Life IS sappy at times.

624
00:58:58,144 --> 00:59:00,112
Plus, that's just some person's opinion.

625
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,148
You'd love it in Indiana.

626
00:59:03,483 --> 00:59:06,680
Perfect place to write, small town. Four
seasons means four books.

627
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,388
Indiana, huh?

628
00:59:10,256 --> 00:59:12,224
I always liked the midwest.

629
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:14,593
Small towns.

630
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:19,129
Older buildings and front porch houses.

631
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:25,030
Well, it's just something to think about.

632
00:59:30,476 --> 00:59:35,914
"Doctor Grimes, your entire staff has been
working very hard to find a solution to what's
been happening."

633
00:59:38,017 --> 00:59:42,818
You know, this is one of the first horror
movies I ever saw, back in the 70's.

634
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:48,027
Back in the olden' days.

635
00:59:48,995 --> 00:59:54,865
When movies were good, there was no cable.
Just 3 networks and a few local TV stations.

636
00:59:55,835 --> 01:00:00,465
David, that was a really really really long
time ago.

637
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,138
I know.
Ha!

638
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:07,642
I'm an old man shane.
Older than you by a lot.

639
01:00:11,584 --> 01:00:12,881
What?

640
01:00:13,386 --> 01:00:15,354
David, 50 is not that old.

641
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:20,656
Are you bugged that we can't be friends
because you are 15 years older than me?

642
01:00:20,893 --> 01:00:22,861
Age is just a number, it doesn't matter.

643
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:26,931
15 years is a pretty huge gap.

644
01:00:28,034 --> 01:00:31,902
Different tastes, different ways of thinking.

645
01:00:32,505 --> 01:00:34,473
David, age really doesn't matter.

646
01:00:35,274 --> 01:00:38,710
To me, at least. When I look at you, I don't
see your age, all right?

647
01:00:41,414 --> 01:00:45,680
*crunch crunchity crunch crunch*

648
01:00:58,097 --> 01:00:59,621
I... just have to ask you something.

649
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:01,833
I'm sorry for being so forward.

650
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:09,804
James is really concerned about me, and he
is a good friend to me and a great cousin to
you.

651
01:01:14,414 --> 01:01:16,382
But...
*exhales*

652
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:19,852
I don't know if you're straight... or... gay...

653
01:01:20,586 --> 01:01:25,387
He thought that we might get along great,
that we might be perfect as friends.

654
01:01:26,492 --> 01:01:30,428
I don't know, I never got around to asking
him. He seems to think that, maybe you are.

655
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:32,254
I guess.
I don't know.

656
01:01:37,804 --> 01:01:42,002
*sighs*
I'm sorry, you know we're just going to be...
friends, then...

657
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:45,502
... and that's good with me... that's good...

658
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:47,880
*beautiful music plays*
*kissing sounds*

659
01:01:51,918 --> 01:01:53,886
**SMACK**
AH!
Oh, I'm sorry!

660
01:01:54,153 --> 01:01:56,121
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!
No, no, It's alright!

661
01:01:56,789 --> 01:01:58,757
Are you OK?
It's OK, It's OK!

662
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:02,190
It's OK!
Kiss me, quick!

663
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:08,267
*smooching*

664
01:02:20,146 --> 01:02:22,114
*laughter*

665
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:39,097
I'm having so much fun with you.

666
01:02:40,233 --> 01:02:42,201
You know what, mister, I'm having fun with
you too.

667
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:53,039
I don't think I've had this much fun in a long,
long time.

668
01:02:55,481 --> 01:02:57,449
You're funny.
You're sweet.

669
01:02:57,683 --> 01:03:01,983
You're kind, and you're damn hot.
*laughter*

670
01:03:02,421 --> 01:03:04,389
Hot?

671
01:03:04,724 --> 01:03:06,692
Haha... that's rich!

672
01:03:07,193 --> 01:03:09,161
Look, David, you are a very hot man!

673
01:03:09,996 --> 01:03:11,964
I'm a man that's getting old.

674
01:03:12,365 --> 01:03:14,560
Oh, David, not the age thing again.
I thought we talked about this.

675
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:21,169
I don't know how to get past that.

676
01:03:26,112 --> 01:03:29,946
We've known each other for such a short
time.

677
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:37,455
I am completely and absolutely crazy about
you.

678
01:03:40,059 --> 01:03:42,027
But you are 15 years younger than me.

679
01:03:44,564 --> 01:03:49,729
I have no expectations, I mean... look, wait.
I know, I remember what it was like.

680
01:03:50,102 --> 01:03:55,130
You are just having fun, and that's OK.
David, David...

681
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:58,410
We talked about this.

682
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:00,879
Age doesn't matter to me.

683
01:04:01,247 --> 01:04:03,545
Alright?
It really, really doesn't.
Age really is just a number.

684
01:04:04,417 --> 01:04:06,385
I think James is right.

685
01:04:08,754 --> 01:04:10,722
I think we are just perfect for each other.

686
01:04:12,425 --> 01:04:14,393
And I'm crazy about you.

687
01:04:17,496 --> 01:04:22,433
I'm not going to go second guessing it
because you are too old, or because I'm too
young. Alright?

688
01:04:23,302 --> 01:04:27,398
I don't know what's been going on here since
I met you, but I... um...

689
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:33,944
I've never been this happy before in my life.

690
01:04:43,322 --> 01:04:45,290
I want you to be happy.

691
01:04:45,691 --> 01:04:48,057
David, the universe wants you to be happy.

692
01:04:49,629 --> 01:04:51,597
Alright?
Do what you want in life.

693
01:04:52,465 --> 01:04:55,764
Make a lot of money.
Make no money.
Make some money.
Make all the money.

694
01:04:56,002 --> 01:04:56,969
*laughs*

695
01:04:59,005 --> 01:05:02,532
What matters is that you have done good.

696
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:09,813
And that you have done good for others.
That can only come from having a good
heart, which you have. *sniffle*

697
01:05:20,359 --> 01:05:26,025
I just never believed I'd meet anybody that
would like me for me.

698
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:28,667
*laughter*

699
01:05:29,335 --> 01:05:31,769
That I deserved to be happy.
Why?

700
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:34,773
Oh, I don't know.

701
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:42,280
My dad...

702
01:05:44,383 --> 01:05:48,410
I guess I never felt that he approved of me.

703
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:53,155
I mean, maybe he loved me in his own way.

704
01:05:55,895 --> 01:05:57,863
If he ever told me...

705
01:05:59,265 --> 01:06:01,233
... just once...

706
01:06:02,868 --> 01:06:04,836
... if I ever meant anything to him.

707
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:10,372
I never knew if I was...

708
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:12,643
... important.

709
01:06:13,212 --> 01:06:16,511
Well you are very important to me.

710
01:06:16,782 --> 01:06:17,771
OK?

711
01:06:18,384 --> 01:06:20,352
Uh, listen.

712
01:06:23,422 --> 01:06:25,856
I know you are going through some stuff
right now.

713
01:06:26,959 --> 01:06:32,295
But, um...
I'm pretty sure I want to spend the rest of
my life with you.

714
01:06:54,253 --> 01:06:56,221
Sorry.

715
01:07:39,832 --> 01:07:41,800
How's it hanging there, guy?

716
01:07:42,368 --> 01:07:45,860
You're looking pretty serious today, whats
going on with you?

717
01:07:53,045 --> 01:07:55,013
It's Shane.

718
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,417
The young man, huh?

719
01:08:01,187 --> 01:08:03,382
It's getting really serious.

720
01:08:05,724 --> 01:08:07,692
Serious is good.

721
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:12,290
Ace, he's 15 years younger than me.

722
01:08:12,898 --> 01:08:16,425
Well, as the young people say, BFD.
You know?

723
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:25,038
You cannot look at age the same way that
society does.

724
01:08:25,411 --> 01:08:27,379
You are smarter than that.

725
01:08:29,348 --> 01:08:32,977
Patrick was 23 years younger than me.

726
01:08:34,353 --> 01:08:36,321
And guess what?

727
01:08:36,856 --> 01:08:38,289
I'm still here.

728
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:46,596
You cannot think about your mate in any
other way than just:

729
01:08:47,032 --> 01:08:52,868
'This is today! We are in love and today is
our day!'

730
01:08:53,606 --> 01:08:56,769
And you go through life every day that way.

731
01:08:57,076 --> 01:08:58,202
That's it.

732
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:01,339
Do you run into problems?
Hell yes.

733
01:09:02,915 --> 01:09:04,883
Life isn't a bowl of cherries.

734
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:07,951
It's got a lot of pits in it too.

735
01:09:10,456 --> 01:09:12,424
You know, he wants to move to Indiana?

736
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,851
Been there done that kind of thing too.
Mmhmm.

737
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:22,366
Can't tell you how many times Patrick and I
moved in those 12 years that we were
together.

738
01:09:23,102 --> 01:09:28,563
Plenty.
Was it all his, all mine? No.
It was ours.

739
01:09:29,074 --> 01:09:31,042
We had to come to an agreement.

740
01:09:31,577 --> 01:09:38,005
As far as Indiana?
I wouldn't move there.
I came from a farm in South Dakota.

741
01:09:38,284 --> 01:09:42,482
I don't want to move back to the farm
country again. As much as I love it.

742
01:09:42,888 --> 01:09:46,483
If I go to Indiana, I...
I won't be able to see you.

743
01:09:48,594 --> 01:09:53,463
Do people have... cars and trains and
airplanes now?

744
01:09:54,133 --> 01:09:56,101
*laughter*

745
01:09:56,602 --> 01:09:57,967
Aha!
Yeah. They do.

746
01:09:58,304 --> 01:10:00,499
I could see you, you could see me.

747
01:10:03,142 --> 01:10:09,775
Time is irrelevant, age is irrelevant.
It's two human souls getting together.

748
01:10:14,954 --> 01:10:16,922
You jump at it.

749
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,385
Don't you dare talk your way out of this.

750
01:10:21,093 --> 01:10:22,458
Go.

751
01:10:23,529 --> 01:10:25,497
Hello Indiana.

752
01:10:33,105 --> 01:10:36,700
David's Voice :
"We all strive for the perfect life.

753
01:10:37,009 --> 01:10:40,342
It's not about money, or fame.

754
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:43,147
It's about the kind of person we become.

755
01:10:43,382 --> 01:10:47,216
Every choice we make, takes us down a
different road.

756
01:10:47,519 --> 01:10:55,290
When I'm on my deathbed and I reflect, I
just want to be sure I made a difference in
the world.

757
01:10:55,661 --> 01:10:57,629
In someone's life.

758
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:03,267
That I didn't just... take up space."

759
01:11:05,404 --> 01:11:07,372
Hey there, mister.

760
01:11:07,806 --> 01:11:09,774
You ready to go?

761
01:11:11,343 --> 01:11:13,311
You are my best friend.

762
01:11:13,879 --> 01:11:16,905
I never dreamt the two of you would fall in
love.

763
01:11:17,516 --> 01:11:20,383
But, I'm so happy you did!
You guys mean the world to me.

764
01:11:20,686 --> 01:11:23,951
So, no long goodbyes, no tears or anything.
I love you both.

765
01:11:24,189 --> 01:11:27,283
And I just know you two will be together
forever.

766
01:11:27,526 --> 01:11:29,494
I just know these things, alright?

767
01:11:29,895 --> 01:11:31,863
I wish you'd come with us.

768
01:11:32,097 --> 01:11:34,065
You guys had better get going!

769
01:11:40,906 --> 01:11:43,932
By the way... I put in my job notice.

770
01:11:44,243 --> 01:11:48,111
I'll be there in three months.
I couldn't be without my two best friends,
now could I?

771
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:53,318
What just happened?

772
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:02,060
We're really going to do this...

773
01:12:03,128 --> 01:12:05,460
We are all packed up and moving to Indiana.

774
01:12:06,098 --> 01:12:09,898
My folks are excited to meet you and I can't
wait to show you off.

775
01:12:11,203 --> 01:12:13,569
What?
What's wrong?

776
01:12:15,274 --> 01:12:19,040
You really love me, don't you?
Because I really love you with all my heart.

777
01:12:19,812 --> 01:12:22,144
Are you sure you want to do this?
What?

778
01:12:28,153 --> 01:12:30,621
I just want to thank you.

779
01:12:31,323 --> 01:12:35,157
For giving me love and support...

780
01:12:35,461 --> 01:12:37,486
... and a new third act in my life.

781
01:12:40,299 --> 01:12:42,460
I thought I'd die alone, an old man.

782
01:12:44,103 --> 01:12:48,870
Thanks for taking care of me when I'm old
and feeble when I can't take care of myself.

783
01:12:49,641 --> 01:12:53,236
Well...
I'm just doing it for the insurance money.

784
01:12:53,512 --> 01:12:55,480
I love you.

785
01:12:55,848 --> 01:12:58,646
I love you.
No matter what we have to go through.

786
01:12:59,852 --> 01:13:03,788
I can't imagine not spending every day of
every year forever with you.

787
01:13:04,156 --> 01:13:06,124
The day I met you my world changed.

788
01:13:06,425 --> 01:13:09,588
It was lonely, I just existed.

789
01:13:17,302 --> 01:13:19,930
David's Voice:
"I actually got my farmboy from Indiana.

790
01:13:22,641 --> 01:13:25,906
I never thought it would take me 50 years to
find my true love.

791
01:13:27,446 --> 01:13:29,880
But maybe that whole fate thing is true.

792
01:13:30,315 --> 01:13:35,275
The day we met was the best day of my life.

793
01:13:35,721 --> 01:13:45,221
And now, every day is the best day ever."
