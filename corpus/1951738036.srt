JFK

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,320
<i>January, 1961.</i>

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,400
<i>President Dwight D. Eisenhower's
Farewell Address to the Nation.</i>

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,560
This conjunction of an immense military
establishment and arms industry is new...

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,560
...in the American experience.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,200
The total influence...

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,560
...economic, political, even spiritual...

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,560
...is felt in every city, every Statehouse,
every government office.

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,960
We must guard against the acquisition...

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,680
...of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought...

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,840
...by the military-industrial complex.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
We must never let the weight
of this combination...

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,880
...endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,520
<i>November, 1960.</i>

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,440
<i>Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy
of Massachusetts...</i>

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,880
<i>... wins one of the narrowest election
victories in American history...</i>

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,880
<i>... over Vice President Richard Nixon
by a little more than 100,000 votes.</i>

22
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,840
<i>Alongside his beautiful
and elegant wife, Jacqueline Bouvier...</i>

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,520
<i>... Kennedy is the symbol
of the new freedom of the 1960s...</i>

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,760
<i>... signifying change and upheaval
to the American public.</i>

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,520
"All men are created equal."

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,880
Every degree of mind and spirit
that I possess will be devoted...

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,120
...to the cause of freedom
around the world.

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,640
Today, the proudest boast is:

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,400
<i>"Ich bin ein Berliner!"</i>

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,200
<i>He inherits a secret war against the
Communist Castro dictatorship in Cuba...</i>

31
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,720
<i>... a war run by the CIA
and angry Cuban exiles.</i>

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,120
<i>Castro is a successful revolutionary...</i>

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,480
<i>... frightening to American business
interests in Latin America.</i>

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,960
<i>This war culminates in the disastrous
Bay of Pigs invasion...</i>

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
<i>... in April, 1961...</i>

36
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,680
<i>... when Kennedy refuses to provide
air cover for the exiled Cuban brigade.</i>

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>Kennedy takes public responsibility
for the failure.</i>

38
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,800
<i>He privately claims the CIA lied to him...</i>

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,760
<i>... and tried to manipulate him into ordering
an American invasion of Cuba.</i>

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,120
<i>In October, 1962...</i>

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,840
<i>... the world comes to the brink
of nuclear war...</i>

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,760
<i>... when Kennedy quarantines Cuba...</i>

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,920
<i>... after announcing the presence
of offensive Soviet nuclear missiles...</i>

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,000
<i>... 90 miles off American shores.</i>

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,320
<i>Soviet ships with more missiles
sail towards Cuba...</i>

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,600
<i>... but at the last moment they turn back.</i>

47
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,000
<i>The world breathes with relief.</i>

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,040
<i>In Washington, rumors abound
that JFK has cut a secret deal...</i>

49
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
<i>... with Russian Premier Khrushchev...</i>

50
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,600
<i>... not to invade Cuba in return
for a Russian withdrawal of missiles.</i>

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,200
<i>Suspicions abound that Kennedy
is soft on communism.</i>

52
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,160
<i>Kennedy also finds himself embroiled
in Laos and Vietnam.</i>

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,440
We've got our difficulties there.

54
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,280
Unless a greater effort is made
by the government...

55
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,040
...to win popular support,
I don't think the war can be won there.

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,960
It's their war. They're the ones
who have to win it or lose it.

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,600
<i>Early that fateful summer...</i>

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,120
<i>... Kennedy speaks of his new vision
at the American University.</i>

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,720
What kind of peace do I mean?

60
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,760
What kind of peace do we seek?

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,680
Not a "Pax Americana"...

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,400
...enforced on the world
by American weapons of war.

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,560
We must re-examine our own attitudes
towards the Soviet Union.

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,920
Our most basic, common link...

65
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,040
...is that we all inhabit...

66
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,920
...this small planet.

67
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,040
We all breathe the same air.

68
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,720
We all cherish our children's futures.

69
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,280
And we are all mortal.

70
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,920
You fucking assholes!

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,280
<i>Don't leave me here!</i>

72
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,600
They've gone to Dallas.

73
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,280
<i>Friday.</i>

74
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,520
They're going to kill...

75
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,520
<i>... Kennedy.</i>

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,360
<i>Call somebody.</i>

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,200
Stop them.

78
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,120
These are serious fucking guys.

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,640
She's been high on something
since they brought her in.

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,480
Help!

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,280
Please!

<i>In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired...</i>

<i>... at President Kennedy's motorcade

88

93
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,600
The President's been shot.

94
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,920
In Dallas. Five minutes ago.

95
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,840
Oh, no!

96
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,360
How bad?

97
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,520
No word. They think it's in the head.

<i>Three bullets were found. Gov. Connally
also appeared to have been hit.</i>

100
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,240
<i>The President was rushed to Parkland
Memorial Hospital, four miles away.</i>

101
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,200
<i>We are told the bullet entered the base
of the throat and came out the back...</i>

102
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,600
<i>... but there is no confirmation.</i>

103
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,440
<i>Blood transfusions are being given.
A priest has administered the last rites.</i>

104
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,880
There's still a chance.

105
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,320
Pull through, Jack.

106
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,480
<i>From Dallas...</i>

107
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,840
<i>... the flash, apparently official:</i>

108
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,800
<i>President Kennedy died...</i>

109
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,320
<i>... at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time...</i>

<i>... some 38 minutes ago.</i>

<i>Vice President Johnson
has left the hospital.</i>

113
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,960
<i>Presumably he will take
the oath of office shortly...</i>

114
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,720
<i>... and become the 36th President
of the United States.</i>

115
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,600
<i>He did so much for this country,
for colored people. Why?</i>

116
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,240
Good-bye, you sorry bastard! Die!

117
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,280
Shut the fuck up!

118
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm ashamed to be an American today.

119
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,840
<i>The President of the United States is dead.</i>

120
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,680
<i>I just talked to Father Oscar Hubert
of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church.</i>

<i>He told me...</i>

122
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,560
<i>... President Kennedy has been given
the last rites.</i>

123
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,120
<i>Shortly after 12:30...</i>

124
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,720
<i>... near the park in downtown Dallas...</i>

125
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,880
<i>... the shots rang out.</i>

126
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,000
<i>The President is dead.</i>

127
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,840
The bullets came up over our heads...

128
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,680
...from that fence up on the knoll.

129
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,240
I seen his face when it hit.

130
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,560
His ear blew off and he turned real white.

131
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,920
<i>He flopped over on his stomach...</i>

132
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,320
<i>... with his foot sticking out.</i>

133
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,800
<i>None of us thought it could happen
in America or any place else.</i>

134
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,240
All this blubbering over
that no-count son of a bitch!

135
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,640
They're bawling like they knew the man.
Makes me want to puke.

136
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,320
For God's sake, the President was shot.

137
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,240
A bullshit President!

138
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,960
Nobody's crying for the thousands
of Cubans...

139
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,360
...that bastard condemned to death
and torture at Bay of Pigs.

140
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,400
Goddamn peace treaties!

141
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,800
<i>I heard shots from over there.</i>

142
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,000
<i>- I heard shots from over there.
- How many?</i>

143
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,800
That's what happens
when you let the niggers vote.

144
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,040
They get together with the Jews
and the Catholics...

145
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,560
...and elect an Irish bleeding heart.

146
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,000
Chief, maybe you had too much to drink.

147
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,800
Bullshit!

148
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,640
Here's to the New Frontier.

149
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,800
Camelot in smithereens.

150
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,160
I'll drink to that.

151
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
<i>Dallas police have just announced...</i>

152
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,080
<i>... they have a suspect in the killing
of Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit...</i>

153
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,080
<i>... who was shot at 1:15 in Oak Cliff,
a Dallas suburb.</i>

154
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,960
<i>Police say there could be a tie-in
to the President's murder.</i>

155
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,760
<i>The suspect,
identified as a Lee Harvey Oswald...</i>

156
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,480
<i>... was arrested by more
than a dozen policemen...</i>

157
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,320
<i>... after a short scuffle at a movie theater
in Oak Cliff.</i>

158
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,240
<i>Officer Tippit was killed...</i>

159
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,440
<i>... by a revolver which was found
on Oswald.</i>

160
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
Shoot the bastard!

161
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,160
Give him a medal for shooting Kennedy!

162
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,080
<i>I don't know what I am charged with...</i>

163
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,800
<i>... but I emphatically deny these charges.</i>

164
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,400
The kid must've gone nuts, right?

165
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,560
I said, Oswald must've flipped.

166
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
Right?

167
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,160
Just did this crazy thing
before anybody could stop him.

168
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,920
I'm going. I've got to get home, Chief.

169
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,600
What are you talking about?

170
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Who'd have ever thought...

171
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,520
...that goofy Oswald kid would pull
a stunt like an assassination?

172
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Goes to show you can never know
about some people. Am I right, Jack?

173
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,440
Am I right, Jack?

174
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,200
Well, bless my soul.

175
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,880
All these years,
I thought you were on my team.

176
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,400
Are you kidding?

177
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,240
I couldn't be more serious, Jack.

178
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Your little red eyes have me wondering
about your loyalty.

179
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,360
Look at that, Martin.

180
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,280
Who's been going through my files?

181
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,080
You've been looking through my files,
you little weasel!

182
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,080
You're starting to get paranoid. Really!

183
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,400
You went through all my files!

184
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,800
You're a goddamn spy!

185
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,520
Why would I want to look
through your files?

186
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,600
I've seen enough here this summer
to write a book.

187
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,920
I always lock my files!

188
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,440
You're the only one here today.

189
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,200
What do you mean, you bastard?

190
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,320
You're going to write a book?

191
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,800
You know what I mean.

192
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,600
I've seen a lot of strange things here.

193
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,760
Strange people.

194
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,680
You didn't see a goddamn thing!

195
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,480
Not a goddamn thing!

196
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,440
<i>The full name is Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

197
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,080
<i>- Did you shoot the President?
- I didn't shoot anybody.</i>

198
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,080
<i>They have taken me in
because I have lived in the Soviet Union.</i>

199
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,400
<i>I'm just a patsy!</i>

200
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,240
He sure looks like a creep.

201
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,440
<i>I protested at that time I was not allowed
legal representation...</i>

202
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,000
<i>... during that very short and sweet hearing.</i>

203
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,720
<i>I really don't know...</i>

204
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,520
<i>... what this situation is about.</i>

205
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,080
<i>Nobody has told me anything
except that I am accused...</i>

206
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,880
<i>... of murdering a policeman.</i>

207
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,560
<i>I know nothing more than that.</i>

208
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,560
<i>I do request someone to come forward...</i>

209
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
<i>... to give me legal assistance.</i>

210
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,880
<i>Were you ever in the Free Cuba movement
or whatever it's called?</i>

211
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,760
<i>It's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.</i>

212
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
<i>Why were you in Russia?
What happened to your eye?</i>

213
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,360
He seems pretty cool
for a man under pressure.

214
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,920
<i>A policeman hit me.</i>

215
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,360
He gives me the willies.

216
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,160
Come on, sugarplums,
it's past your bedtimes.

217
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Mattie, honey, get a hold of yourself.

218
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,200
A fine man.

219
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,080
<i>After a stint in the Marines...</i>

220
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,600
<i>... he became fascinated by communism.
He is said to be a dedicated Marxist...</i>

221
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,080
<i>... and a fanatical supporter of Fidel Castro
and ultra left-wing causes.</i>

222
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,960
<i>He spent last summer in New Orleans
and was arrested...</i>

223
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,240
<i>... in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.</i>

224
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,360
Lou? Sorry to disturb you this late.

225
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,880
Matter of routine. Get on
this Oswald connection in New Orleans.

226
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,360
Check out his record. Find any friends
or associates from last summer.

227
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,480
Let's meet with the investigators
day after tomorrow.

228
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
<i>On Sunday?</i>

229
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,320
Sunday. 11:00.

230
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,680
Thanks, Lou.

231
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
<i>I would say that he is the killer...</i>

232
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,520
<i>... beyond a reasonable doubt
and to a moral certainty.</i>

233
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,120
<i>I thought a motorcycle had backfired.
I looked to my left.</i>

234
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,200
<i>A second shot hit him in the face.</i>

235
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,080
<i>The rifle, a cheap World War II,
Italian-made Mannlicher-Carcano...</i>

236
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,560
<i>... was ordered from
a Chicago mailing house...</i>

237
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,000
<i>... and shipped to Oswald's alias, A. Hidell...</i>

238
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,880
<i>... at a post office box in March of 1963.</i>

239
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,640
<i>This same rifle was used
to assassinate the President.</i>

240
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
That ties it up.

241
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,640
Another nut. Jesus Christ,
anybody can get a rifle in Texas!

242
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,440
As far as Oswald's associates,
one name keeps popping up: David Ferrie.

243
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Oswald was seen with him
several times last summer.

244
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,800
I know David. Strange character.

245
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,440
He's been in trouble before. He was
a hot-shot pilot for Eastern Airlines.

246
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,280
Got canned after an alleged
homosexual incident.

247
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,240
<i>These photos were found yesterday
among Oswald's possessions...</i>

248
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,200
<i>... in the garage where Marina Oswald
and her children are living.</i>

249
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Somebody mentioned Ferrie
on that Texas trip. Find that out.

250
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,880
<i>He no shoot anyone.</i>

251
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,520
<i>He good man. Good husband.</i>

252
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,680
So it seems David Ferrie drove off
on Friday afternoon for Texas.

253
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,400
A source said he might have been
a getaway pilot for Oswald.

254
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,920
Hold your horses.

255
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,760
What kind of source?

256
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The anonymous kind, Chief.

257
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,840
I remember Ferrie speaking
at a meeting of some veterans' group...

258
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,400
...ranting against Castro. Extreme stuff.

259
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,520
They're bringing him out.
Numa, turn it up.

260
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,520
<i>Here he comes!</i>

261
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,960
<i>Anything to say in your defense?</i>

262
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,880
<i>Oswald!</i>

263
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,040
He shot him!

264
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,640
He shot him on TV!

265
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,400
<i>There's a man with a gun!</i>

266
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,760
Seventy cops there.
What were they doing?

267
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,760
No trial now. Somebody just saved
the Dallas DA a pile of work.

268
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,840
Let's get David Ferrie in here anyway.

269
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,640
It's wrong. This is crazy!

270
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,680
<i>Yesterday, in the midst of sorrow,
the business of government went on.</i>

271
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,400
<i>The President met with Henry Cabot Lodge,
our Ambassador to Vietnam...</i>

272
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,040
<i>... and members of his Cabinet.</i>

273
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,320
<i>The major subject was Vietnam...</i>

274
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,160
<i>... a crisis that does not pause
for bereavement.</i>

275
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,560
<i>From this meeting...</i>

276
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,680
<i>... came affirmations that
the US would continue aiding...</i>

277
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:26,680
<i>... the new government of Vietnam in
its war against the Communist insurgents.</i>

278
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,720
David Ferrie.

279
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Come on in.

280
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,280
Thanks for coming.

281
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,040
Remember me? We met
on Carondelet Street after your election.

282
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,120
I remember.
You make quite an impression.

283
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,680
I've heard you're a first-rate pilot.

284
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,520
Legend has it you can get in
and out of the smallest field.

285
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,440
I'm a pilot myself. Flew grasshoppers
for the field artillery in the war.

286
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,840
Make yourself comfortable.

287
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,080
Mind if I smoke?

288
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
How could I?

289
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,560
As you know, President Kennedy
was assassinated on Friday.

290
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,000
A man named Lee Harvey Oswald
was arrested as a suspect...

291
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,720
...then murdered yesterday
by a man named Jack Ruby.

292
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,640
We've had reports that Oswald
spent the summer here...

293
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,360
...and that you knew Oswald.

294
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,440
I've never met anyone named Oswald.
Anyone who told you that has to be crazy.

295
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,600
He served in your Civil Air Patrol unit
when he was a teenager.

296
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,480
If he did, I don't remember him.

297
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,320
Lots of boys in and out.

298
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,680
Surely you've seen this. Perhaps
you knew him under another name?

299
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,360
I never saw him before in my life.

300
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,160
Then we must have gotten
mistaken information.

301
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,880
Thanks for straightening it out.

302
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,840
There's one other matter.

303
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,000
We heard you went to Texas
shortly after the assassination on Friday.

304
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,120
True. I drove to Houston.

305
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,600
What was so appealing about Houston?

306
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,400
I hadn't been ice-skating lately.
Some young friends and I...

307
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,200
...decided to go skating.

308
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,760
Why the urge to ice-skate in Texas...

309
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,680
...during one of the worst thunderstorms
in recent memory?

310
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,520
Spur-of-the-moment thing.

311
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,880
Storm wasn't that bad.

312
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,680
Where did you drive?

313
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,720
We went to Houston.

314
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,680
<i>Saturday we drove to Galveston,
and stayed there.</i>

315
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,960
And Sunday?

316
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,800
In the morning, we went goose hunting.

317
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,840
Did you bag any?

318
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,600
The boys got a couple.

319
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,200
Boys said they didn't get any.

320
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,280
They're right.

321
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,960
There were thousands
of geese everywhere.

322
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,120
But you couldn't approach them.
They're wise.

323
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Your friends said you had no weapons.

324
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,120
Isn't it difficult to hunt geese
without a shotgun?

325
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,080
I remember now. I'm sorry.

326
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,400
I got confused.

327
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,600
We got near the geese, then realized
we had forgotten our shotguns.

328
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,600
Stupid, right?

329
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,240
So, of course, we didn't get any geese.

330
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,320
Thank you for your time.

331
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,520
Sorry this must end inconveniently...

332
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,560
...but I must detain you for questioning
by the FBI.

333
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,840
Why? What's wrong?

334
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,440
Your story is not believable.

335
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,440
Really?

336
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,920
What part?

337
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,000
This afternoon the FBI released
David W. Ferrie...

338
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,360
...of New Orleans.

339
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,400
After extensive questioning
and a background check...

340
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,800
...the Bureau found no evidence
that Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald...

341
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,920
<i>... or had any connection
with the assassination.</i>

342
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,160
<i>The agent in charge would like
to make clear...</i>

343
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,720
<i>... that Ferrie was brought in
for questioning...</i>

344
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,240
<i>... by the District Attorney
of Orleans Parish.</i>

345
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
I thought we were on the same side.

346
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,320
Why are they saying that?

347
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,400
Pretty fast, the way they let him go.

348
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,640
They must know something we don't.

349
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,160
So let's get on with our lives.

350
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,320
We have many homegrown crimes
to prosecute.

351
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,960
<i>The President has announced...</i>

352
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,680
<i>... the creation of a commission
to probe the events in Dallas.</i>

353
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,640
<i>It will be headed
by Chief Justice Earl Warren...</i>

354
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,320
<i>... and is expected to head off
several Congressional and Texas inquiries.</i>

355
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,640
<i>On the panel are Allen Dulles,
ex-chief of the CIA...</i>

356
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,240
<i>... Representative Gerald Ford,
banker John McCloy...</i>

357
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,320
Three Years Later

358
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,400
<i>Fucking out of control.
All these hippies running around on drugs.</i>

359
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,160
You can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.

360
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,880
I saw a girl the other day. Pregnant.
You could see her whole belly.

361
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,800
You know what she had painted on it?
"Love Child."

362
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,800
Johnson Seeks $9 Billion
In Extra Viet War Funds

363
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,720
It's a mess down there, Jim.

364
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,960
We've bitten off more Vietnam
than we can chew.

365
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,160
It figures with that polecat Lyndon
in the White House.

366
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,120
I sometimes think things have gone
downhill since Kennedy died.

367
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,800
Don't get me started on that.

368
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,800
Those Warren Commission fellows
were picking gnat shit out of pepper.

369
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,480
Nobody's going to tell me that kid
shot like he did from that bookstore.

370
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,560
But the FBI test-fired the rifle
to see if it could be done.

371
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,840
Three experts and not one
of them could do it.

372
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,200
They say that Oswald got off three shots
with world-class precision...

373
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,920
...from a manual bolt-action rifle
in less than six seconds.

374
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,400
According to his Marine buddies,
he got Maggie's drawers.

375
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,120
That means he wasn't any good.

376
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,640
<i>Average man would be lucky
to shoot twice.</i>

377
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,560
<i>And the first would be the best.</i>

378
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,680
<i>Here the third shot's perfect.</i>

379
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,640
And they got that bullet zigzagging
all over the place...

380
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,200
<i>... hitting Kennedy and Connally
seven times.</i>

381
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,760
One pristine bullet? That dog don't hunt.

382
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,120
Something's always bothered me
about that from day one.

383
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,280
Think other men were involved?

384
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,040
If I was investigating the case, I'd round up
100 of the world's best riflemen...

385
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,640
...and find out which ones were
in Dallas that day.

386
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,200
You been duck hunting.
Oswald's an old-fashioned decoy.

387
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,080
What did he say? "I'm just a patsy!"
Believe it.

388
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,640
Dinner's just about ready.

389
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,440
Got a surprise for you tonight.
Tried something new.

390
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,160
- What?
- Dinner.

391
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,200
Smells good. Do you know Oswald...

392
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,360
...was interrogated for 12 hours
after the assassination...

393
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,160
...with no lawyer present,
and nobody recorded a word of it.

394
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,320
I can't believe it. An experienced
police captain and a crowd of FBI agents...

395
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,200
...had to know that with no record,
what Oswald said is inadmissible in court.

396
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,040
Let's talk at the table. It's getting cold.

397
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,040
What are you doing here?

398
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,600
Daddy said it's okay if I'm quiet.

399
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,880
Sure it is.

400
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,000
If I handled a minor felon that way,
it'd be all over the papers.

401
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,800
This is the alleged murderer
of the President.

402
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,960
Again and again
credible testimony's ignored.

403
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,520
Leads are not followed up,
conclusions are selective, no index.

404
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,080
It's the sloppiest investigation
I've ever seen.

405
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,400
Dozens of witnesses heard the shots...

406
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,080
...coming from the grassy knoll
in front of Kennedy...

407
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,000
...not the Book Depository behind him.

408
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,640
But it's broken down and spread around.
You read it, but the point is lost.

409
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,800
I never believed it.

410
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,680
I'll do the dishes. You take Eb up.

411
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,240
Elizabeth, your bedtime too!

412
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,160
That was three years ago.
We've tried to put it out of our minds.

413
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,600
You keep digging it up.

414
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,480
You're the DA of New Orleans.

415
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,520
Isn't the Kennedy assassination
a bit out of your domain?

416
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,560
All those important people studied it.

417
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,240
I can't believe a man as intelligent
as Earl Warren read those volumes.

418
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,120
Maybe you're right.

419
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,080
You got an hour to solve the case
while I get the kids in bed.

420
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,320
Then you're mine. Mr. Kennedy
will have to wait until morning.

421
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,000
Look, Dad. Look what I drew.

422
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,080
That's something. What is it?

423
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,280
It's a rhino in a cage.

424
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,160
- Can I stay up another hour?
- I don't think so, Son.

425
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,440
Pickle and Snapper, my two...

426
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,760
...dancing partners.

427
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,440
Good night, doodlebugs.

428
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,840
One hour, you hear?

429
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,280
Some Saturday-night date you are.

430
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,240
Mama warned me this would happen
if I married such a serious man as you.

431
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,440
When I come up, I'll show you
how Saturday night got invented.

432
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,720
<i>I sealed off the area and held off the trains
till they could be examined.</i>

433
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,680
<i>There were some transients taken on
at least one train.</i>

434
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,040
<i>Mr. Bowers, you already talked to us
about this matter. Is that correct?</i>

435
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,320
<i>Yes.</i>

436
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
<i>Is there anything else you told us...</i>

437
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,840
...that I haven't asked you about,
that you can think of?

438
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,520
Nothing that I can recall.

439
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,760
Witness is excused.

440
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,200
A long freight was in there...

441
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,800
...and we pulled some people off
and took them to the station.

442
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,720
<i>Do you mean some transients?</i>

443
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,120
Tramps and hobos.

444
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,880
<i>Were they questioned?</i>

445
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,160
<i>They were questioned at the station.</i>

446
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,440
<i>Ask the question.</i>

447
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,600
<i>Let's go back to that Amos Euins matter.</i>

448
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,120
<i>Traffic had been cut off
into the area since 10:00.</i>

449
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,400
<i>But three cars came in during this time...</i>

450
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,680
<i>... from around noon till the time
of the shooting.</i>

451
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,640
<i>They circled the parking lot and left.</i>

452
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,720
Like they was checking the area.

453
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,520
One of the drivers...

454
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,880
...was holding something up to his mouth.

455
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:33,360
<i>The last car came in about seven
to ten minutes before the shooting.</i>

456
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,160
<i>It was a white Chevrolet four-door Impala.</i>

457
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,520
<i>Muddy up to the windows.</i>

458
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,720
Towards the underpass, I saw two men...

459
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,680
...standing behind a picket fence...

460
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,520
<i>... looking up towards Main and Houston,
as the caravan came down.</i>

461
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,880
<i>One of them was middle-aged...</i>

462
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,840
<i>... heavyset.</i>

463
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,320
<i>The other man was younger.</i>

464
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,600
<i>Two other men were on the east end
of the parking lot.</i>

465
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,960
<i>They both had uniforms.</i>

466
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,440
<i>At the time of the shooting...</i>

467
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,760
<i>... there seemed to be some commotion.</i>

468
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,960
I'm just unable to describe...

469
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,600
<i>... a flash of light or smoke or something...</i>

470
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,680
<i>... which caused me to feel that something
out of the ordinary...</i>

471
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,880
<i>... had occurred on the embankment.</i>

472
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,600
Goddamn.

473
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,280
No!

474
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,000
- You all right?
- Honey, it's incredible.

475
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,720
What?

476
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,840
The whole thing.

477
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,040
A Lt. Colonel testifies that...

478
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,720
...Oswald had a Russian language exam
as part of his Marine training...

479
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,320
...only a few months before he defects
to the Soviet Union.

480
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,200
A Russian exam.

481
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,720
It's 4:30 in the morning!
I have five kids who'll wake up in an hour.

482
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,120
In all my years in the military, I never knew
a single man who had a Russian test.

483
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,440
Oswald was a radar operator.

484
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,760
He'd have about as much use for Russian
as a cat has for pajamas.

485
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,920
These books have gotten to your mind!

486
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,080
- Stop reading.
- He makes it sound like nothing.

487
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Oswald did badly on his test.

488
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,800
He got only two more Russian words right
than wrong.

489
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,280
That's like me saying,
Touchdown is not very intelligent...

490
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,280
...because I beat him three games
out of five when we played chess.

491
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Are you going to stay up all night,
every night? For what?

492
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,760
To be the only man who's read
all 26 volumes of the Warren Report?

493
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Do I have to spell it out for you?

494
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,320
Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.

495
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,720
He was in military intelligence,
that's why he was trained in Russian.

496
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,880
It was no accident he was in Russia.

497
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,080
- Go back to sleep.
- I've been sleeping for three years!

498
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,360
'Morning boys. Ready for a walking tour?

499
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,200
7:30 Sunday morning?
Not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing.

500
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,960
Old stains, but just as telling.

501
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,160
531 Lafayette Street.

502
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,760
Remember whose office this was in '63?

503
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,080
Sure. Guy Banister.

504
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,640
Ex-FBI man. Died a couple of years ago.

505
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,920
<i>He headed the Chicago office. When he
retired he became a private eye here.</i>

506
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,840
I used to have lunch with him.
John Birch Society, Minutemen.

507
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,040
To the right of Attila the Hun.

508
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,520
<i>Recruited students to infiltrate
radical organizations on campus.</i>

509
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,800
<i>Headed the Anti-Communist League
of the Caribbean.</i>

510
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,200
All out of this office.

511
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,320
I want to show you something.

512
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,600
Take a look here.

513
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,320
544 Camp Street.

514
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,760
531 Lafayette Street.

515
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,720
Same building, right?

516
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,960
Different addresses, different entrances,
both going to the same place...

517
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,320
...to the office upstairs.

518
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Guess who used it?

519
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,000
<i>Lee Harvey Oswald.</i>

520
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,080
<i>How do we know that?</i>

521
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,920
This address was stamped on...

522
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,840
<i>... pro-Castro leaflets he handed out
in the summer of '63 on Canal Street.</i>

523
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,480
<i>The same leaflets they found
in his garage in Dallas.</i>

524
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,760
<i>After the arrest, 544 Camp St.
Never appeared on the pamphlets again.</i>

525
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,960
He was arrested for fighting
with anti-Castro Cubans.

526
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,840
<i>But he'd contacted them already...</i>

527
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,080
<i>... as an ex-Marine trying
to join their anti-Castro crusade.</i>

528
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,720
<i>When they heard he was now pro-Castro,
they paid him a visit.</i>

529
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,600
What's this Fidel shit? You lied to me!

530
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,640
Liar! Son of a bitch!

531
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,040
Do not take this Communist propaganda!

532
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,760
If you want to hit me, hit me.

533
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,480
You pinko shit!

534
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,360
Go back to Moscow!

535
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,000
<i>There was no real fight.</i>

536
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,280
<i>The arresting Lieutenant later said
he felt it was a staged incident.</i>

537
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,680
<i>In jail, Oswald has a private session...</i>

538
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,320
<i>... with Special Agent John Quigley
of the FBI.</i>

539
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,880
<i>Oswald is released.</i>

540
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,880
<i>And Quigley destroys his notes
from the interview.</i>

541
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,120
The arrest gets Oswald a lot of publicity.

542
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,960
And he appears on a local TV debate.

543
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,760
You are a Communist, are you not?

544
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,640
No, Mr. Bringuier. I am not a Communist.
I'm a Marxist-Leninist.

545
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,600
Communist, Marxist-Leninist,
what's the difference?

546
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,760
What if I told you Oswald was trained
in the Russian language in the Marines?

547
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,080
I'd say he got intelligence training.

548
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,160
You were a Marine. Who'd run it?

549
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,560
Office of Naval Intelligence.

550
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,080
Look across the street.

551
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,720
Post Office.

552
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,160
Upstairs, in 1963,
that was the Office of Naval Intelligence.

553
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,840
By coincidence, Banister,
before he was FBI, was ONI.

554
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,520
What's their saying?

555
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,560
"Once ONI, always ONI."

556
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,640
He likes working near his old pals.

557
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,000
We are standing in the heart...

558
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,800
...of the US government's intelligence
community in New Orleans.

559
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,280
That's the FBI.

560
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,720
That's the CIA.

561
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,400
That's the Secret Service.

562
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,560
That's the ONI.

563
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,960
Isn't this a strange place...

564
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,160
...for a Communist
to spend his spare time?

565
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,960
What are you driving at?

566
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,240
We're going back into the case.

567
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,840
The murder of the President.

568
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,480
Lord, wake me. I must be dreaming.

569
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,960
You're awake. I'm deadly serious.

570
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,280
Let's track down your anonymous source
from three years ago.

571
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,520
How'd you find out David Ferrie drove
to Texas that day?

572
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,680
I can't remember last night,
let alone three years ago, Boss.

573
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,560
You're not being cross-examined.

574
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,240
I need clarification about the night
Guy Banister beat you over the head.

575
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,520
Don't tell me you don't remember.

576
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,160
You called our office from your hospital
bed. You were hopping mad about it.

577
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,080
Here's my problem.

578
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,520
You told me you and Guy were
good friends for a long time.

579
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,080
- Over ten years.
- And he never hit you before?

580
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,040
Never touched me.

581
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,200
Yet, on November 22, 1963...

582
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,560
...the day of the President's murder...

583
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,120
...the police report says...

584
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,760
...he pistol-whipped you
with a.357 Magnum.

585
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,120
It also says you argued
about the phone bill. Look!

586
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:18,840
Is an argument over a phone bill
a believable explanation to you?

587
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,240
There's more to it.

588
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,880
How much more?

589
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,320
I shouldn't talk about it.

590
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,120
I'd ask Guy. We were friendly.
Heart attack?

591
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,960
You buy what you read in the papers.

592
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,160
- You have other information?
- I didn't say that!

593
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:42,000
All I know is he died suddenly.
Just before the Warren Report came out.

594
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,600
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

595
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,160
<i>You were the only one here!</i>

596
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,520
<i>The only one here!</i>

597
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,080
<i>You didn't see a goddamn thing!</i>

598
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,960
Hell, Guy's dead, so it don't matter
no more. It was all about those...

599
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,280
...people that was hanging
around the office that summer.

600
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,320
I was never part of the operation.

601
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,320
I just handled their private-eye work
as it came in for Guy.

602
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,480
Not much did, but that's why I was there.

603
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,160
<i>It was a nuthouse.</i>

604
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,960
<i>Cubans coming, going. And Christ,
they all looked the same to me.</i>

605
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,520
You going to play with this rifle or pack it?

606
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,040
<i>Dave Ferrie.</i>

607
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,120
- You know about him?
- We know Dave. Was he there?

608
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,560
<i>He practically lived there.</i>

609
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,160
<i>The whole thing was...</i>

610
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,200
<i>... all cloak-and-dagger stuff.</i>

611
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,080
They called it "Operation Mongoose".

612
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,720
The idea was to train these Cuban exiles
for another invasion of Cuba.

613
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,520
Banister's office was part
of the supply line...

614
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,040
<i>... from Dallas through New Orleans
to Miami.</i>

615
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,320
<i>We stockpiled arms, explosives.</i>

616
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,720
<i>In view of the intelligence community
in Lafayette Square?</i>

617
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,120
<i>Yes. Everybody knew everybody.
They were all part of the network.</i>

618
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,680
<i>All worked for the CIA.</i>

619
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,040
Pilots and black operators
and civilians and the military.

620
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,920
Everybody was running guns then.

621
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,160
<i>Ft. Jefferson, Bayou Bluff,
Morgan City, you name it.</i>

622
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,760
<i>McAllen, Texas? Big gun-run operation.</i>

623
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,640
<i>Where does Banister fit in?</i>

624
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,400
<i>He was running his camp
north of Lake Pontchartrain.</i>

625
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,240
<i>Ferrie did a lot of the training.</i>

626
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,240
<i>They had a shooting range
and tropical territory, like in Cuba.</i>

627
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,560
<i>Some Americans were trained there too.</i>

628
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,440
<i>Nazi types. Mercenaries.</i>

629
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,760
<i>That Ferrie, though,
Jesus, he was the craziest.</i>

630
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,080
<i>Late summer the party was over.
Kennedy didn't want another Bay of Pigs.</i>

631
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,520
<i>He told the FBI, "Shut up the camp."</i>

632
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,520
<i>"Confiscate the napalm, C-4 and all."</i>

633
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,440
<i>The G-men were just going
through the motions.</i>

634
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,080
<i>Their hearts were still
with their old FBI buddy Banister.</i>

635
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,800
Oswald?

636
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,360
He was there too.

637
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,120
<i>Sometimes meeting with Banister.</i>

638
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,720
<i>With the door shut.</i>

639
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,480
<i>Shootin' the bull with Ferrie, whatever.
But he was there, all right.</i>

640
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,680
<i>Anything more specific, Jack?</i>

641
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,640
It's important.

642
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,080
<i>One time, the secretary got upset.</i>

643
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,400
I can't believe it, Mr. Banister,
Oswald is down on Canal Street...

644
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,120
...handing out Communist leaflets
supporting Castro.

645
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,240
It's okay, Delphine, he's with us.

646
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,720
<i>Was anyone else involved at...</i>

647
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,080
...Banister's level?

648
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,840
One guy. I don't know who.

649
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,400
<i>Big. White hair.</i>

650
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,000
<i>I saw him in the office once.
He looked out of place.</i>

651
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,440
<i>You know, a society guy.</i>

652
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,920
<i>Can't remember his name,
but Oswald was with him.</i>

653
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,680
<i>He had something to do with money,
because Banister never kissed ass...</i>

654
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,200
<i>... but he kissed his.</i>

655
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,920
<i>Clay something.</i>

656
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,840
<i>That was his name. Clay...</i>

657
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,200
- Bertrand?
- Yeah.

658
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,960
- Clay Bertrand?
- I don't know.

659
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,880
- Maybe not.
- No, that's right.

660
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,480
I must go.

661
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,320
He was in the Warren Report.
He got Oswald a lawyer.

662
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,640
Was Kennedy discussed?

663
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,640
I don't know.

664
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,440
- The assassination?
- No.

665
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,920
- Not with me. I've got to go.
- Hold on.

666
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,080
- That's all I'll say.
- What's the problem?

667
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,520
Do I have to spell it out for you?

668
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,720
Nobody knows what
we're talking about here.

669
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,840
You are so naive.

670
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,840
- When'd you do business with Bertrand?
- Pipe the bimbo in red.

671
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,080
- Lawdy.
- She's not as cute as you.

672
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,080
- You should try a legitimate business.
- Why are you dancing on my head?

673
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,320
- We've been friends since law school.
- Because you're conning me.

674
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,920
- I read your testimony.
- Grain of salt.

675
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,640
You said Clay Bertrand called you
the day after the assassination...

676
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,880
...and asked you to be Oswald's lawyer.
- Right.

677
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,000
That's pretty important.

678
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,720
You told the FBI he's 6' 2".
Then you tell the Commission he's 5' 8".

679
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,560
How the hell does a man shrink like that?

680
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,400
They put the heat on me, like you. I gave
them whatever popped in my cabeza.

681
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Truth is, I never met the dude.

682
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,120
- One likes friends that have friends.
- Indeed.

683
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,280
I don't know what that cat looks like
or where he's at.

684
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,240
All I know is sometimes
he sends me some cases.

685
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,960
One day he calls, talks to me
about repping Oswald in Dallas.

686
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,400
- You ever speak to Oswald in Dallas?
- No.

687
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,040
I told that Bertrand cat right off
this ain't my scene.

688
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,080
- I'm a hack. He needs a hot dog.
- Then how did you get in the Commission?

689
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,280
Like I told the Washington boys...

690
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,240
...Bertrand asked me that summer to help
the kid upgrade his Marine discharge.

691
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,400
Mr. Bertrand said
he would take care of any of...

692
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,200
Fine.

693
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,240
<i>- To whom am I speaking?
- Clay Bertrand. I'll pay what they owe.</i>

694
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,760
There was no conspiracy. If there was,
why didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute?

695
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,200
He was his brother.

696
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,400
How'd so many people keep such a secret?

697
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,080
- It was Oswald. He hated...
- We're having a communication problem.

698
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,840
I know you know who Clay Bertrand is.
Stop eating that crabmeat and listen.

699
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,840
I'm aware of our friendship,
but I'll call you before the grand jury.

700
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,840
You lie to them as you lied to me,
I'll charge you with perjury.

701
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,400
I took nine judges on here in New Orleans.

702
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,920
I beat them all.
Am I communicating with you?

703
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,320
Off the record?

704
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,520
In that case, let me sum it up for you.

705
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,560
If I answer that question you keep asking...

706
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,480
...if I give you the name
of the big enchilada...

707
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,040
...then it's "bon voyage", Deano.

708
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,320
Like a bullet in my head, you dig?

709
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,440
You're a mouse fighting a gorilla.
JFK's dead as that crabmeat.

710
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,440
The government's still breathing.

711
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,560
Either you give the grand jury
Clay Bertrand's real identity...

712
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,560
...or your fat behind's
going to the slammer.

713
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,240
You're as crazy as your mama.
It's in the genes.

714
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,040
Do you know what you're getting into?

715
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,840
The government will jump all over
your head and go cock-a-doodle-doo.

716
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,080
Good day to you, sir.

717
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,920
<i>District Attorney Garrison
to see Prisoner 5388.</i>

718
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,240
<i>Ward block 237B.</i>

719
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,920
We don't need gates with that swamp.

720
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,440
Many of them gone in there,
none of them came out.

721
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,360
You got visitors here.
Don't give them trouble.

722
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,840
- How you doing, Mr. Broussard?
- Let's go, Willie.

723
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,640
Thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.

724
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,080
I got nothing but time.

725
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,720
Minutes, hours, days. Years of it.

726
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,400
Time stands still here,
like a snake sunning itself.

727
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,320
Clay Bertrand?

728
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,680
I met him sometime in...

729
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,840
...June of '62. The Masquerade Bar.

730
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,120
Dave Ferrie took me there
expressly to meet him.

731
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,840
Sexual purposes?

732
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,360
Did he pay you?

733
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,800
$20 each time. Ain't no secret.
That's what I'm in here for.

734
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,400
Anything unusual about him...

735
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,720
<i>... you'd be able to describe in court?</i>

736
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,000
<i>He had something wrong with his leg,
a limp.</i>

737
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,880
<i>Don't get me wrong.
He's not one of those limp wrists.</i>

738
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,920
<i>He's a butch John. Meet him on the street,
you'd never snap.</i>

739
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,760
<i>You could play poker with him,
go fishing, you'd never snap.</i>

740
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,360
One night we were at David Ferrie's...

741
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,800
<i>... sometime late in the summer of '63.</i>

742
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,440
<i>There was about nine to ten people there.</i>

743
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,000
<i>Cuban. Friends who'd done stuff
in the bush with him. Place was a mess.</i>

744
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,240
<i>Dave's mind was a mess.
He had caged mice...</i>

745
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,880
<i>... 'cause he's working on a cancer cure.</i>

746
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,280
<i>Dave's smart, though.
Speaks five languages.</i>

747
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,000
<i>Knows philosophy, medicine,
military history, politics.</i>

748
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,200
He wanted to be a priest.
They defrocked him 'cause he was queer.

749
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,960
That's where you first met Oswald?

750
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,440
<i>Strange guy. Dave introduced him as...</i>

751
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,000
Leon Oswald.

752
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,200
How you doing?

753
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,240
What the fuck is he doing here?

754
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,600
Fuck you, motherfucker.

755
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,360
Leon's in a bad mood. Don't get excited.

756
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,040
You said Leon was actually
Lee Harvey Oswald?

757
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,040
Yeah. I have no reason to lie to you.

758
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,040
I'm already in jail.

759
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,080
Go on.

760
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,600
Finally they left
and I was alone with Dave...

761
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,160
...and this Leon...

762
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,840
...two of the Cubans,
and this guy Bertrand.

763
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,960
<i>Dave pulled out some clippings.</i>

764
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,320
<i>He'd been obsessed with Castro
and Kennedy for months.</i>

765
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,920
Little ass-wipe closed down the camps!
Took our C-4!

766
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,880
Took 10,000 rounds!
3,000 pounds of gunpowder!

767
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,920
All our weapons!

768
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,520
You want to free Cuba?
Whack out the fucking beard!

769
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,720
Kennedy won't let us.
Our hands are empty. How can we?

770
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,640
Problem is getting to him.
Informers on every block.

771
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,520
They got new stuff!

772
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,240
I could show you dozens of poisons!
Put it in his food, he'd die in three days.

773
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,360
No trace!

774
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,360
Put something in his beard,
make it fall out. He'd look ridiculous...

775
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,440
Fucking Kennedy is doing all kinds of deals
with that bastard Khrushchev.

776
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,120
Licking his ass.

777
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:02,400
An inspired act of God should happen here
and put a Texan in the White House!

778
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,480
The Cubans left. Dave was drunk.

779
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,720
<i>He started in on Kennedy again.</i>

780
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,440
I will kill! In the White House!
Stab him in the heart!

781
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,640
Somebody must get rid of him!

782
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,000
You won't get that son of a bitch!

783
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,480
It won't be long.
That fucker will get what he deserves.

784
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,720
It could be blamed on Castro,
the country will want to invade Cuba.

785
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,120
We just need to get him in the open.

786
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,080
Always some harebrained scheme.

787
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,560
Let's have some more champagne,
shall we?

788
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,440
What about the Secret Service? The cops?

789
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,120
If it's planned right, no problem.
They got close to De Gaulle.

790
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,120
Eisenhower always rode in open top.

791
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,400
We need three mechanics
in three different locations.

792
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,200
An office building, a high-powered rifle.

793
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,320
Triangulation of crossfire, that's the key.
That's the key.

794
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,280
A diversionary shot
gets the Secret Service looking one way.

795
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,920
Boom! Get the kill shot.

796
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,040
One man has to be sacrificed.

797
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,320
In the commotion, the job gets done.

798
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,720
The others leave the country.

799
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,120
Let's drop this subject.
It's one thing to banter with these kids...

800
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,880
...but this sort of thing could be
so easily misunderstood.

801
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,080
<i>I didn't think much about it then.
It's just bullshit.</i>

802
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,000
People like to act more important
than they are.

803
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,560
Especially in the homosexual underworld.

804
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,440
But when they got him...

805
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,120
...I got scared.

806
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,960
Real scared.

807
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,360
That's when I got popped.

808
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,880
The things you said will be attacked
by many people.

809
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,440
Bring them on. Bring their college degrees
in here, I got nothing to hide.

810
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,440
No one can buy me.

811
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,120
- I don't even need this parole.
- What parole?

812
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,880
You liberal, you don't know shit
'cause you never been fucked in the ass.

813
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,960
This ain't about justice!
No, this is about order!

814
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,320
Who rules? Fascism is coming back.

815
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,840
Nobody wants to buy you.
No one's promising you parole.

816
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,720
What I need to know
is why are you telling us this.

817
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,000
'Cause that motherfucker Kennedy...

818
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,880
...stole that motherfucking election,
that's why.

819
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,600
Nixon was going to be a great President
until Kennedy wrecked this country.

820
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,960
Niggers wanting rights!
Why do you think we have all this crime.

821
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,600
He promised those motherfuckers
too much!

822
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,760
Revolution's coming, bullshit!
Fascism's coming back!

823
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,400
The day that Communist son of a bitch
died was a great day!

824
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,600
A great day for this country.

825
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:39,520
I hate to think they blame it
on silly, fucking Oswald.

826
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,760
Didn't know shit, anyway.

827
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,760
People got to know.
People got to know why he was killed.

828
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,040
Because he was a Communist.

829
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,560
You go ahead, put me on the stand,
I'll tell the same goddamned story!

830
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,880
Don't matter to me!

831
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,720
All right, Willie. Thanks.

832
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,240
We'll be in touch.

833
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,160
All right.

834
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,520
You know, you're not a bad-looking man.

835
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,280
Not bad at all.

836
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,760
I get out of here, I'll come see you.
We can have fun!

837
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,040
Their testimony won't hold up in court.

838
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,480
Their reputations are lower
than crocodile piss.

839
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,680
That bothers you?

840
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,000
If a woman's a prostitute,
must she also have bad eyesight?

841
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,840
Find Clay Bertrand.
Start by checking around the Quarter.

842
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,680
The six of us,
with almost no budget and in secret...

843
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,320
...will solve a case
the Warren Commission couldn't?

844
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,200
- I didn't pick you for your legal skill.
- Thanks, Boss.

845
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,360
You're a fighter.
I like a man who's not afraid of bad odds.

846
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,280
Mr. Garrison, how are you?
Remember me?

847
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,600
You vote for me?

848
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,080
I did. We sang together
at the Royal Orleans, remember?

849
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,360
We sang:

850
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,000
"You're the cream in my coffee"

851
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,560
Haven't seen you much lately.

852
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,680
Been too busy. Elected men can't have
as much fun as they used to.

853
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,600
It's always nice to see you.
Pleasure to serve you always.

854
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,920
How are you? Nice to see you.

855
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,160
Welcome back, Lou.

856
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,640
- Think I could get a martini?
- They're waiting for you, sir.

857
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,360
Keep that table open for us.

858
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,640
Anything on the hoboes?

859
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,480
<i>"Dallas Times Herald" photographer
got great shots.</i>

860
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,720
Never published.

861
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,320
Can't say that comes as a surprise.

862
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:45,640
They took them to the sheriff's
and let them go. No record of questioning.

863
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,560
Do they look like the hoboes
you remember?

864
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,520
<i>These two look young.</i>

865
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,680
Not a frayed collar or cuff,
fresh haircuts and shaves...

866
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,920
...clean hands, new shoe leather.
- Who the hell are they then?

867
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,440
Sit down.

868
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,440
This could be it. Let's look for them.

869
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,560
What about the railroad man, Lee Bowers,
who saw the men at the picket fence?

870
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,560
<i>Graveyard. Dead. August this year.</i>

871
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,320
<i>Single-car accident on an empty road
in Midlothian, Texas.</i>

872
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,880
The doctor said he was in a strange shock
when he died.

873
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:26,960
We need to find more witnesses.

874
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,520
<i>There was Rose Cheramie, a whore.</i>

875
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,840
<i>She said she was a dope runner
for Jack Ruby.</i>

876
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,880
And that Ruby knew Oswald for years.

877
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:40,080
<i>- Can we talk to her?
- She's dead too.</i>

878
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,080
Hit and run.

879
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,000
Why don't we go to the horse's mouth?

880
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,640
Jack Ruby's been in a Dallas jail cell
for three years. Maybe he'll crack.

881
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,000
Can't. If I go to him our investigation
will hit the front pages.

882
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,200
It'll blow up in our face.
Susie, what did you find on Oswald?

883
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,440
Negative on his tax records. Classified.

884
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,600
First time a DA can't get a tax record.

885
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:14,480
<i>I asked for the CIA files on Oswald
that were part of the Warren Report.</i>

886
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,680
About 1,200 documents.
Can't get one of them.

887
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,360
<i>All classified as secret on the grounds
of national security.</i>

888
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,000
Gave me his grammar school records.
It's a study of his pubic hairs.

889
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,040
<i>Lonely kid, no father.</i>

890
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,440
<i>Joins the Marines at 17.</i>

891
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,920
Learns Russian. Acts overtly Marxist.

892
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,320
<i>But he's stationed
at a top-secret air base in Japan...</i>

893
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,720
<i>... where U-2 spy flights
over Russia originate.</i>

894
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,400
He's discharged...

895
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,880
...supposedly because his mother's sick.
Stays home three days.

896
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:51,960
<i>Then, with a $1,500 ticket from
a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow.</i>

897
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,720
<i>Mr. Oswald, do you understand...</i>

898
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,440
...the action you are about to take?
- Yes, I do, sir.

899
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,760
I wish to renounce my citizenship...

900
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,040
...and become a Soviet citizen.

901
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,160
I'll give them all the information
I have on the Marines.

902
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,840
He disappears for six weeks,
presumably with the KGB.

903
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,480
He's taken to a radio factory in Minsk...

904
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,840
...where he lives as high on the hog
as he ever has.

905
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:24,720
He's given 5,000 rubles,
a roomy apartment with a balcony.

906
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,760
<i>Has affairs with local girls.</i>

907
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,920
Makes sense. He's a spokesman.

908
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,520
But he never does any propaganda
for the Russians.

909
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,400
<i>He meets Marina.</i>

910
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,120
<i>Her uncle is a colonel
in Soviet intelligence.</i>

911
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,360
She thinks he's Russian by his speech.

912
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,520
<i>Six weeks later they marry,
have a daughter.</i>

913
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,680
Only explanation for the royal treatment
is he gave them radar secrets.

914
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,160
Or fake secrets.

915
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,280
Six months after he's in Russia...

916
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,840
<i>... Francis Gary Powers' U-2 spy flight
goes down...</i>

917
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,600
<i>... in Russia. That plane was untouchable.</i>

918
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,240
Powers hinted that Oswald...

919
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,200
...could've given the Russians
enough data to hit it.

920
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,640
As a result, the peace summit between
Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.

921
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,920
<i>Perhaps our military didn't want
the conference to happen?</i>

922
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,280
Maybe Oswald was part of that!

923
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,200
- Stick to what you can prove in court.
- You want facts?

924
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:26,560
Don't get sidetracked.
How'd he get back to the States?

925
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,000
Does he have any problems
with Uncle Sam?

926
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:32,680
No. The State Department issues him
a new passport in 48 hours...

927
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,200
...and loans him travel money.

928
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,320
He's never investigated or charged
for revealing classified information...

929
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,000
...or, as far as we know,
debriefed by the CIA.

930
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:48,080
Bastard should've been prosecuted
as a traitor when he got off the boat.

931
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,000
<i>Did Marina have problems getting out?</i>

932
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:55,040
None, though it's almost impossible
to get Russian sweethearts out.

933
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,680
This is a man who defected once already.
It's crazy. Ordinary people...

934
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,960
...get blacklisted
for having leftist affiliations.

935
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,240
Doesn't add up.

936
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,880
Next thing, he's living in Dallas-Fort Worth,
October '62...

937
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,880
<i>... working six months
at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall...</i>

938
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,400
<i>... a photographic firm that makes maps
for the US Army.</i>

939
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,760
<i>Oswald becomes chummy
with the Dallas White Russian community.</i>

940
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,960
<i>All rabid anti-Communists.</i>

941
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,960
It's odd.

942
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:27,240
His closest friend is an oilman,
named George DeMohrenschildt.

943
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:34,200
<i>He is 35 years older than Oswald,
who is only 23 and supposedly broke.</i>

944
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,160
He is a part of the Dallas Petroleum Club,
speaks five languages...

945
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,040
<i>... and was a French Vichy intelligence
during the war...</i>

946
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,920
<i>... also rumored to be a Nazi sympathizer.</i>

947
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,120
DeMohrenschildt draws a picture
of Oswald as an intellectual...

948
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:55,920
<i>... well read, speaks excellent Russian,
a man who adored JFK.</i>

949
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,360
I think he's made some mistakes
regarding Cuba.

950
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,480
I think he's doing a pretty good job.
If he succeeds, in my opinion...

951
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,960
...I think he'd make a great President
and a handsome one, too.

952
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,600
<i>That's scenery, Susie.
Now, don't get sidetracked.</i>

953
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,360
This is the same man that nailed Oswald
to the Warren Commission...

954
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,520
...as a potentially violent man
and linked him to the rifle.

955
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:23,480
Well, in that sense
Castro is an experimenter.

956
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,080
It could go any way with that country.

957
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:30,520
- It could go the way of the communism...
- What you got there?

958
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,120
Do you have rifles in there?

959
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:40,240
Tell me what I'm shooting at,
rabbits or Fascists?

960
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,120
<i>- I hunt.
- You hunt?</i>

961
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,920
We don't know he's CIA.
Let's circle him very probable.

962
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,000
Call him Oswald's handler.

963
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:53,920
<i>The Oswalds are introduced
to Janet and Bill Williams.</i>

964
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,880
<i>It's through Janet Williams,
in October '63, that Lee gets the job...</i>

965
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,960
...at the warehouse on Elm Street
at the Book Depository.

966
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:09,240
<i>So he can now exercise his intellect,
stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.</i>

967
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:14,160
<i>Marina fights with Lee about many things.</i>

968
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,840
His secrecy, their lack of money.

969
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:22,440
<i>She says that Lee is not sexually adequate.</i>

970
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,440
Lee hits her on several occasions.

971
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,920
<i>At the age of 24...</i>

972
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,560
<i>... he rents a room in Dallas
under the alias of O.H. Lee.</i>

973
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,360
Do you want to watch TV?
Are you all right?

974
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,120
No, thank you. I'm fine.

975
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,000
All I know about the Williams is
their tax returns are classified.

976
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,600
<i>Bill Williams has links to the CIA
through his family...</i>

977
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,360
<i>... and does classified work
for Bell Helicopter.</i>

978
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,800
<i>Bill's convenient separation from Janet
allows Marina to move into her house...</i>

979
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,680
<i>... where she suddenly becomes
Marina's best friend.</i>

980
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,760
<i>There Marina and Lee
have a second daughter.</i>

981
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,240
<i>I have to go away. Just for a short while.</i>

982
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,400
What's wrong with this family?

983
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:06,960
<i>I love Lee...</i>

984
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,560
<i>... and I sorry him.</i>

985
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,800
<i>Sorry for him?</i>

986
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:12,440
<i>Yes.</i>

987
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,360
When he's arrested,
Marina buries him with the public.

988
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,000
She describes him as a psychotic
and violent man.

989
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,640
I have too much facts...

990
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,800
...and facts tell me that Lee shot Kennedy.

991
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,120
After being locked away
by the feds for two months...

992
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,480
...and afraid she'd be deported...

993
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,880
...she was probably suffering
from nervous exhaustion.

994
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,920
<i>They taught her how to answer.</i>

995
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,880
When they think she's ready,
they buy her dresses...

996
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,320
...polish her appearance and wheel her out.

997
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:46,120
<i>- I'd like to thank the Warren Commission.
- Oswald was no angel.</i>

998
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,720
But who was he?

999
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,040
I'm lost. What are we saying?

1000
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,360
That when Oswald went to Russia,
he was not a real defector.

1001
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:01,040
He was an intelligence agent for our
government and remained one till he died.

1002
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,880
So, because Oswald pulled the trigger...

1003
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,080
...the intelligence community
murdered the President?

1004
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,400
I'll go you one better. Maybe Oswald...

1005
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,200
...didn't pull the trigger.

1006
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,800
Nitrate tests indicate he hadn't fired
a rifle on November 22.

1007
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,000
And they didn't bother to see
if the rifle'd been fired that day.

1008
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,800
- His palm print was on it.
- It went to the FBI.

1009
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,160
FBI didn't find a goddamn thing.

1010
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,240
It comes back a week later and a Dallas
policeman suddenly finds a palm print?

1011
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,200
<i>It could've been taken at the morgue.
There's no chain of evidence.</i>

1012
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,560
I can't figure out why he orders
a traceable weapon...

1013
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,560
...to a P.O. Box, when he can go
into any store in Texas...

1014
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,040
...give a phony name and walk out
with an untraceable rifle.

1015
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,400
To frame him, obviously!

1016
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,680
A lot of smoke, but some fire.

1017
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,680
We're talking about our government!

1018
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,560
We're talking about a crime.

1019
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,200
You must think on a different level,
like the CIA does.

1020
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,240
We're through the looking glass.

1021
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,360
White is black.

1022
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,800
And black is white.

1023
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:10,120
Maybe Oswald is just what he said he was.

1024
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,880
A patsy.

1025
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,080
Unbelievable. You were here?

1026
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,760
Yes, this is where I was sitting.

1027
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,400
Shots came from near the wooden fence
over there...

1028
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,240
...near the overpass.

1029
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,480
I saw a man run from the fence
toward those railroad cars.

1030
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,640
I made it clear to the Warren people.

1031
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,120
One of the shots came
from behind that picket fence.

1032
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,400
I heard the report and saw smoke,
six or eight feet above the ground.

1033
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,320
<i>Out from under those trees.</i>

1034
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,600
<i>All four of us railroad men...</i>

1035
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,840
<i>... seen the same thing.</i>

1036
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,880
The smoke came from behind the hedge.

1037
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:57,640
<i>I was standing next to Mary Moorman,
who took the photo when he was killed.</i>

1038
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,160
I stepped down to the curb and yelled:

1039
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,200
"Mr. President, look over here!"

1040
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,640
Then shots rang out.

1041
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:15,000
<i>Mary dropped to the ground, yelling,
"They're shooting! Get down!"</i>

1042
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,640
<i>I just stood there watching.</i>

1043
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,160
<i>The driver had stopped.</i>

1044
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,720
<i>I don't know what was wrong with him.</i>

1045
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,240
Out of the corner of my eye...

1046
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,920
...I saw a flash of light in the bushes.

1047
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,640
<i>And that last shot...</i>

1048
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,440
<i>... just ripped his head off.</i>

1049
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,360
I looked up and saw smoke coming
from over there, on the knoll.

1050
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,280
We came around to look for tracks.

1051
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:45,840
<i>It rained that morning
and we found a bunch.</i>

1052
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,080
Cigarette butts.

1053
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:51,120
<i>Someone had stood about... here.</i>

1054
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,120
That's a good spot.

1055
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,840
For the head shot.

1056
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:03,640
<i>Everything was just frozen.</i>

1057
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:09,320
<i>Like people weren't breathing.
Like you were looking at a picture.</i>

1058
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,960
<i>Except for one man.</i>

1059
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,200
<i>I saw this one man running
from the corner of the Book Depository...</i>

1060
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,760
<i>... to the parking lot.</i>

1061
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,920
<i>It was about 11:00 a.m.</i>

1062
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,960
I was driving on Elm Street
toward the underpass in a rented car.

1063
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,120
<i>A light-blue Valiant.</i>

1064
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,400
<i>I'll never forget that day.
There was a lot of traffic...</i>

1065
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,520
<i>... and I stopped
alongside a green pickup truck.</i>

1066
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,840
<i>It was very noticeable
because it had one wheel up on the curb.</i>

1067
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,320
<i>When I saw the gun, I thought...</i>

1068
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,200
<i>..."The Secret Service is not very secret."</i>

1069
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,960
<i>The next morning, I went to the FBI office.</i>

1070
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,200
<i>They showed me some pictures.</i>

1071
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,840
<i>And I picked out three pictures
that looked like the truck's driver.</i>

1072
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,320
That's the man.

1073
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,960
<i>You mean you identified Jack Ruby
on Saturday?</i>

1074
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:58,960
That's right.

1075
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,800
The day before he shot Oswald?

1076
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,360
That's right. When I saw him on TV,
I was shocked.

1077
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,040
I said to my family,
"That's the man I saw in the truck."

1078
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,160
You weren't so sure in your statement
to the Commission.

1079
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,160
What about these others?
You said one might be him?

1080
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,440
They look a bit like him,
but I'm sure this is the man.

1081
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,560
It was him I chased up the grassy knoll.

1082
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,760
<i>I thought maybe our guys had shot back
and got one of them.</i>

1083
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,200
<i>I got to the parking lot.</i>

1084
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:35,000
<i>All I saw were the railroad workers
and Dallas' finest.</i>

1085
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,560
- Secret Service. Come with us.
- No! Find the shooter!

1086
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,080
I want your pictures.

1087
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,320
Son of a bitch!
