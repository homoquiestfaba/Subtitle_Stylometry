<i>Mission Control,
we've got an E.M. disturbance</i>

00:01:03,293 --> 00:01:05,896
<i>radiating from
40 degrees port side.</i>

00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:08,667

CONTROL: <i>Roger that, I.S.S.</i>

6
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:12,236
<i>There is a signature
on your port side.</i>

7
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:14,004
<i>But JPL determines
it may be</i>

8
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,439
<i>from a low-emission
solar event.</i>

9
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:20,011
I.S.S.: <i>Copy, Control, but we
have no particle signature.</i>

10
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:22,280
<i>Captain Peters will be
conducting a maintenance walk</i>

11
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:24,180
<i>and wants to confirm clearance.</i>

12
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:25,617

a visual of something unusual</i>

13
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:28,219

14
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:29,853
<i>If Captain Peters has

15
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:32,157
<i>he may have a visual
on what it is.</i>

16
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:35,860
<i>Uh, Mission Control,
this is Captain Peters.</i>

17
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:41,066
<i>I... there is something
outside of the craft.</i>

18
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:44,169
<i>Captain, there's a large mass
just off your port side.</i>

19
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:46,304
<i>Radar and observatory
telemetry</i>

20
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,073
<i>are trying to approximate
what it is.</i>

21
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:51,676
<i>It might just be
dust blown from our fuselage</i>

22
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:53,077
<i>from the evacuator valve.</i>

23
00:01:53,144 --> 00:01:56,213
<i>Or... wait.
I do have a visual.</i>

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,051
<i>It's dark.
It appears to be...</i>

25
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:27,379
At 6:08 standard times,
Ukraine's Delta...

26
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:28,846
[feedback]

27
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:29,847
Henry, you're holding
the handset too close

28
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:31,316
to the receiver again!

29
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:38,923
What I was saying was at 6:08
a.m. Eastern Standard Time,

30
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,192
Ukraine's Delta Observatory

31
00:02:41,258 --> 00:02:43,794
recorded exactly what
you predicted:

32
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:47,799
an increase in
carbon dioxide and sodium

33
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:49,166
in the Martian troposphere.

34
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,168
You went to the P.A.
system for that?

35
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:53,538
Doesn't that confirm it
once and for all?

36
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:56,106
Well, I'm just looking
at these latest images.

37
00:02:56,173 --> 00:02:57,775
And?

38
00:02:57,842 --> 00:02:59,910
I was correct.

39
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:01,746
Mount Olympus
is going to erupt today.

40
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:04,081
See? I told you!

41
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:06,251
Yeah, it just picked a heck
of a day to do it.

42
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:07,552
I mean, that confirms it.

43
00:03:07,617 --> 00:03:09,419
I'm just trying to add
a little fanfare, babe.

44
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:10,887
You just made history!

45
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:12,790
I mean, an eruption of
Olympus Mons of this size

46
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:14,290
is unprecedented.

47
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:16,560
Most scientists thought
the volcano was dormant.

48
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:19,064
Believe me, okay?
I feel validated.

49
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:20,497
[chuckles]

50
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:23,401
After 10 years of eye strain
tracking topographical changes

51
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:25,735
and chemical signatures
on Mount Olympus,

52
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:27,739
I was not gonna miss this.

53
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:31,074
I take it Junie
didn't exactly take it okay

54
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:32,842
when you got called in.

55
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,978
She was livid.

56
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:36,381
I promised her I'd be
with her today

57
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:39,283
for her post-surgery
checkup when you called.

58
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,085
I mean, Mark's with her,

59
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:44,253
but I'm not gonna be winning a
"Stepmother of the Year" award.

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,056
[scoffs]

61
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:49,525
Look, I could take over for you.

62
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:51,528
You could give me a promotion.

63
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:53,396
I'm tired of hiding
in your shadow anyway.

64
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:55,265
Yeah, and how would that look?

65
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:57,367
I can't promote you!
You're my brother!

66
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,868
It would look like
I'm playing favorites.

67
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:01,504
Yes! You are!

68
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,174
Besides, you owe me!

69
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,308
I owe you?

70
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,876
Absolutely!

71
00:04:05,943 --> 00:04:08,112
All those times
I covered for you.

72
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,381
I turned a blind eye when
you took my Trans Am

73
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:13,050
out on your little
midnight runs... wink.

74
00:04:13,116 --> 00:04:14,718
All right, not worth
a promotion.

75
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:17,320
You were 12.

76
00:04:17,388 --> 00:04:18,322
Well, that's weird.

77
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:19,590
What is it?

78
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:21,358
Hang on. Let me get this up
on the monitor.

79
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:28,900
Our telescope
captured these three images

80
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:31,201
of Mars from 15 minutes ago.

81
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:34,038
Whoa.

82
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:35,838
Yeah, you see that?

83
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:39,343
That ejecta was traveling
incredibly fast.

84
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,312
Is that from
the initial eruption?

85
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:42,847
Looks like it.

86
00:04:44,314 --> 00:04:46,082
Wow.

87
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:49,553
The amount of force
to eject something like this

88
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,956
into the Martian orbit
must have been immense.

89
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:53,825
I mean, at that speed,
solid rock

90
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:55,692
would have disintegrated
into the atmosphere.

91
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,264
Its outer shell must have some
kind of crystallized element.

92
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,567
You know, now that it's an
asteroid, given its heading,

93
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:06,103
it could qualify as an NEO.

94
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,140
You want me to sound the alert?

95
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:10,307
[sighs]

96
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,642
Yeah.

97
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,211
Cc all agencies:
NASA, JPL,

98
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:19,082
meteorological societies,
everybody.

99
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:21,851
It's also got this really
weird chemical signature,

100
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:23,987
some kind of chloride gas.

101
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:26,456
And a huge draw-down of
nitrogen along its path.

102
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,528
I can't figure out what's
generating the chloride, though.

103
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:33,396
- [beeps]
- Wait a minute.

104
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,499
Hang on, these are all
from Washington, D.C.

105
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:39,303
"All observatories on standby
for military guidance."

106
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:53,317
Lieutenant, what's our elapsed
time since the I.S.S. impact?

107
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:54,552
11 minutes, sir.

108
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:57,355
Oh, boy.

109
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,524
Check the security system.
We've got company already.

110
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:03,793
Oh, that must be
the military guidance

111
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,161
our alert warned us about.

112
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:07,396
Any additional intel
from the Pentagon?

113
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:08,800
No, sir.

114
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:11,468
Only "Meet Dr. Allison Fisher
at Falcon Observatory

115
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:12,735
and proceed according
to briefing."

116
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:13,903
Listen to me carefully.

117
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,338
This is going to
escalate quickly.

118
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:16,906
This is a threat response
to an incoming asteroid.

119
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:18,408
- Do you understand?
- Sir.

120
00:06:18,475 --> 00:06:20,177
The Joint Chiefs did
mention that the nature of the

121
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:22,146
object remains open
until we can confirm it.

122
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:23,514
I understand that.

123
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:25,116
But if our messaging
isn't precise,

124
00:06:25,182 --> 00:06:26,884
every tinfoil hat within
100 miles will be there.

125
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:28,386
- Do you understand?
- Sir!

126
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:29,486
Let's go.

127
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:32,657
Let's go see what they want?

128
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:34,225
All right.

129
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:36,661
I just got an alert.

130
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:40,230
"The I.S.S. has
fallen off radar"?

131
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,466
What?

132
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:45,336
There were a dozen
astronauts onboard that.

133
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:47,338
I worked with those guys
for over a year.

134
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:49,472
Okay, it might just be a glitch
in the receiver somewhere.

135
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,543
No, no, no, I mean,
I know.

136
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,110
See this reading?

137
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:57,281
A large object got extremely
close to their sensor.

138
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:59,684
It's roughly the same size
of the object

139
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,418
we detected from Mars initially.

140
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:07,125
Hang on!

141
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,591
The trajectory model
just traced its path

142
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:10,661
over the past few minutes
all the way back to Mars.

143
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:13,497
This is the exact same
ejecta we just saw.

144
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:16,934
How can that be?

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,469
Come on. That takes 14 minutes
to get a radio signal from Mars.

146
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:21,604
Are you trying to tell
me something ejected

147
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:25,109
from Mount Olympus going three
million kilometers a minute?

148
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:30,514
Well, whether it's
the same object or not,

149
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:32,950
predictive model gives it
a 50% likelihood

150
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,718
of impact within
1200 miles of the city.

151
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,354
[doorbuzzer sounding]

152
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,622
What can we do for you, si...

153
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:40,990
Dr. Allison Fisher?

154
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:42,492
I'm sorry.
What's going on?

155
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,529
This facility is for
authorized personnel only!

156
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:47,064
I'm General Reed from
Fort Garrison, New York City.

157
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,164
That is Lieutenant Harris.

158
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:49,733
Okay, hold on.

159
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,501
General, General, we're
doing sensitive work here.

160
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:52,702
I need confirmation
from Command.

161
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,337
Right.

162
00:07:54,403 --> 00:07:56,240
These are our official orders
and a D.O.D. confirmation

163
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:58,140
for a national threat.

164
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,209
Here, give me these.

165
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:00,944
Excuse me, General!

166
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:03,580
Handing over this facility is
not normally something we do!

167
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:05,248
I've been briefed on
this facility

168
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:06,316
and understand that it
is state-of-the-art.

169
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:07,985
- Is that correct?
- Yeah.

170
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,487
It's equipped with
nanometric laser guidance

171
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:11,754
a Deep Field telescopic
range and meteor analysis lab.

172
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:14,057
That's exactly what we need
to find out what this is,

173
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,994
what it's made of
and where it's headed.

174
00:08:17,862 --> 00:08:20,129
NASA and the other
space stations sent out

175
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:21,564
a signal barrage with
no response from it, sir.

176
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:23,466
No response expected,
Lieutenant.

177
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,235
Give the Falcon Observatory
database a security lockdown.

178
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:26,937
Wait, wait.
What are you doing?

179
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:30,107
It will take a bit for me to
breach the observatory firewall.

180
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:32,842
But all live streams are
secure and classified.

181
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,545
You cannot shut down our system!

182
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:36,712
We need to know what
this object is made of.

183
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,281
We'll have a spectral analysis
of it in a minute.

184
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:39,817
And what its dimensions are.

185
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:42,385
Okay. Well, initial data
indicates that it's oblong...

186
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:44,520
Wait. What did you just do
to our shared database?

187
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:46,756
We're closing the live
international feed so deployment

188
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:49,092
of our military assets won't
be compromised to our enemies.

189
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,626
Okay?

190
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:52,663
We need you to take us to
your Command Center, now.

191
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,498
Christ.

192
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,433
No...

193
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,402
We fall under
the UN Security clause.

194
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:01,272
All data between observatories
has to flow both ways!

195
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:04,174
We can't gather data
on a closed system!

196
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:06,711
Sir, Doctor Fisher
does have a point:

197
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:09,213
If she receives updates
from observatories further east,

198
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,549
she can precede our
visual confirmation.

199
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:14,485
Lieutenant, protocol
demands that we do not

200
00:09:14,552 --> 00:09:15,686
advertise orbital security.

201
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:17,321
Yes, sir!

202
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:20,557
General, I strongly advise
against locking down our system!

203
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:21,692
Doctor, I'm aware.

204
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,461
This is a matter
of national security.

205
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:26,363
General, we have an open
database for a reason!

206
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:28,665
Our counterparts in Ukraine
were able to stream a burst

207
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,333
of carbon dioxide
and sodium an hour

208
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,835
before we could detect
it ourselv...

209
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:33,737
Dr. Fisher, it is imperative
that we treat this

210
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:36,307
for what it is,
a natural disaster

211
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:38,509
addressed by the
United States military!

212
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:40,845
General, I need
this database open!

213
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,413
Henry, please advise
your sister not to mistake

214
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,217
her expertise in astronomy
for a command position!

215
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:50,187
Sir, Henry is
orbital reconnaissance.

216
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:51,622
I advise him!

217
00:09:51,688 --> 00:09:54,224
I am the lead astronomer
here and this is physics.

218
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,494
The more you devote to
defense against humans,

219
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,661
the less you devote to defense
against this threat.

220
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:01,531
Now I cannot... I will
not let you in here

221
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:04,200
until this database is open
and under my control!

222
00:10:04,268 --> 00:10:08,105
It's yours, Dr. Fisher,
it's yours.

223
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:10,274
Get me an updated heading.

224
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,113
Okay.

225
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:18,615
I've run an open-source
program to ensure

226
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:22,186
that this database
remains open... permanently.

227
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:25,389
Confirmed.
Data is global.

228
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:28,158
Okay, I'll need
continuous updates.

229
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:30,193
Hey, I just received an APB.

230
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,663
Space Force and my former
commander are saying

231
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,563
they can't keep up
with this object.

232
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,632
This thing made a
90-degree turn

233
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,469
seconds after entering
the atmosphere.

234
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:40,070
I don't want to jump
to conclusions here

235
00:10:40,136 --> 00:10:44,106
but anything over a 30-degree
trajectory adjustment,

236
00:10:44,173 --> 00:10:45,241
that's a UFO.

237
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:47,077
Okay, it's an unusual descent,

238
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:49,547
but that doesn't necessarily
mean it's a spacecraft.

239
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:53,115
Oh, that can't be right.

240
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:54,784
[alarm blares]

241
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:56,653
This says the object
is slowing down.

242
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:59,023
JPL and NASA confirm
that the object

243
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,559
is down to 800 kilometers
an hour.

244
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,994
New projected updates,
58% likelihood

245
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:06,396
it's gonna impact D.C.

246
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:08,899
Something else has ejected
from the Martian surface.

247
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,366
What?

248
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:14,403
This says nine objects
flying in a V formation.

249
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:17,307
Come on, Allie,
these are spacecraft.

250
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,411
Pentagon,
Command Level Omega.

251
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:26,149
Orbital intel records
incoming, zero-9 objects.

252
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:27,817
We've received priority alert.

253
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:30,888
All agencies have confirmed
and all units are activated.

254
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:33,490
Standing by for
coordinated response.

255
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:35,792
Okay. Henry, pull up
a trajectory model.

256
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:38,396
Make it a sliding-base algorithm
based on its current speed.

257
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:42,798
General, with this object
in our atmosphere

258
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:44,800
and these nine other
craft on the way,

259
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:47,405
this is no longer
a natural disaster.

260
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:49,539
Okay, doctor, get me data
on its propulsion.

261
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:50,707
The Air Force will need to know

262
00:11:50,774 --> 00:11:52,309
the limits of its
maneuverability.

263
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,943
Run a multi-source algorithm
on a trajectory.

264
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,646
Map it to all known means
of propulsion here on earth.

265
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:01,350
Done. This algorithm
defaults to zero.

266
00:12:01,418 --> 00:12:04,488
The thermal signature is zero.

267
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:08,291
I mean, it doesn't have
an atmospheric wake.

268
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,927
It's like it doesn't
have a propulsion system.

269
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:16,567
Okay. I'm reducing
the polarized filter

270
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:19,870
and narrowing the lens aperture.

271
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:20,971
Try it again.

272
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:23,941
Nothing.

273
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:26,244
Come on, this telescope
isn't missing anything.

274
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,081
Harris, make sure Command knows
to get those jets in the air.

275
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:33,283
Sir!

276
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,018
<i>Attention, all units!</i>

277
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:38,822
<i>This is Command Omega.
We need all birds in the sky.</i>

278
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:41,024
<i>I need ground units
there five minutes ago!</i>

279
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:42,925
<i>I repeat, all units, move out.</i>

280
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:45,429
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

281
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:48,130
<i>This is B-2 Spirit, en route.</i>

282
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:50,033
What's our updated ETA?

283
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,702
40 minutes to impact to D.C.

284
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:55,338
Okay. Spectral imaging
reports are complete

285
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:58,474
and no traces of ionization.

286
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,344
Thermal imaging
still shows nothing.

287
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,378
Sir, the DOD says
they need immediate intel

288
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:03,781
on the object's hull.

289
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:06,417
There's no way to tell,
not yet anyway.

290
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:08,085
And according to the angle
of its descent,

291
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:11,221
it's no longer heading
to Washington, D.C.

292
00:13:11,288 --> 00:13:12,822
It's going straight
to New York City.

293
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,325
How can we be certain
these bogeys

294
00:13:14,392 --> 00:13:15,992
aren't from Russia or China?

295
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:17,493
General, nothing on Earth is
capable of moving that fast

296
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:18,995
without breaking
the sound barrier.

297
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:21,498
It's triggered a full
global threat response!

298
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:24,067
The DOD is sending
Air Force Captain Ogilvy

299
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:26,937
to manage logistics at
the projected landing site.

300
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:30,206
These craft could be trying out
the closest viable planet...

301
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:31,674
Earth.

302
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:33,076
Look, there are
too many unknowns.

303
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,411
If the Pentagon gives the order,

304
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:36,178
all military will move
to annihilate it.

305
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:37,280
Hang on!

306
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:39,716
It readjusted its heading again!

307
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:41,817
Okay. Predictive model show
a 91% chance it's going

308
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,419
to land at
Rockefeller State Park.

309
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:46,789
That's 25 miles north
of Manhattan.

310
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:48,991
Look, we need firsthand intel
on the ground

311
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,593
to assess its vulnerabilities.

312
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,829
Dr. Fisher? You're the expert
on Mars environment.

313
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:55,365
What can you tell us
from the field?

314
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:57,668
I can run telemetric
scans to measure

315
00:13:57,734 --> 00:13:59,235
its structural integrity,

316
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:01,437
maybe even get some
samples of whatever life form

317
00:14:01,504 --> 00:14:02,706
might be inside.

318
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:04,074
Hey, look.
I served with Ogilvy.

319
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,307
If anybody's
going to the landing site,

320
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,677
it's going to be me.

321
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:08,144
What? No.

322
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:10,179
Henry, you don't even know
what kind of data I need.

323
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:11,481
- You're Recon.
- Exactly.

324
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,149
Okay, that's my point.

325
00:14:13,216 --> 00:14:14,918
We have nine incoming craft.

326
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:19,389
We need to supply real time
scan data to the ground troops.

327
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:21,390
I can go there.
I can set it up.

328
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:23,961
I can assess.
I can do the tests.

329
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:25,495
It's your program.

330
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:28,564
Given Henry's
prior military status,

331
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,734
it saves us time
getting him clearance.

332
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:33,836
Doctor, I recommend you help us
track the other nine objects.

333
00:14:33,903 --> 00:14:36,572
You can join your brother after
the landing zone is secure.

334
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,375
Okay, Henry, when you get
to the landing site,

335
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:41,177
just send us live telemetrics
of the ship's hull's density

336
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:42,745
and whatever else
might be inside.

337
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:44,548
I'll keep it on
a continuous scan.

338
00:14:45,883 --> 00:14:47,716
Just be careful.

339
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:49,586
You're the only brother I got.

340
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:11,206
Pull back! Pull back!
Let's go!

341
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:14,043
Fisher, you're with me.
Get back to the perimeter.

342
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,511
Command said that
the Falcon Observatory

343
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:16,947
was sending you over.

344
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:18,347
I was wondering how long
it would take for you

345
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:20,783
to come back to Space Force.

346
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,619
I loved my time on the I.S.S.

347
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,153
But I figured I was
better served in Recon.

348
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,923
Well, you made
the right choice today.

349
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,658
I.S.S. has been destroyed.
We lost over a dozen men.

350
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:30,760
You didn't know.

351
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:34,096
Sorry, Henry.

352
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:38,634
I was afraid that was
the case when we lost contact.

353
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:40,971
Look, we're gonna
want payback for the I.S.S:

354
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:43,472
you, me, the DOD.

355
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:46,476
But honestly it
doesn't make sense

356
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,946
to escalate a fight with
nine incoming craft.

357
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,249
Okay, I'm live here
at the landing site!

358
00:15:52,316 --> 00:15:53,917
It's been over an hour
since I started streaming.

359
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:55,384
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Get outta here!

360
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:57,419
Get outta here!
Get out!

361
00:15:57,486 --> 00:16:00,557
This area's closed.
Escort.

362
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:01,825
See what we're
dealing with here?

363
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,260
I'm telling you,
this whole situation

364
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:05,495
could blow up in our faces
in a heartbeat.

365
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:06,795
We're shooing kids out of here,

366
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:08,566
getting people out of
their houses

367
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:10,566
while the DOD is holding fire
to cut the risk of retaliation.

368
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,202
If they decide to attack,
what's the plan?

369
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:14,670
Pull back by 200, artillery.

370
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,540
Then every heavy weapon
we have but a nuke.

371
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:18,207
And if that doesn't work?

372
00:16:18,274 --> 00:16:20,076
<i>Captain, the Pentagon
says the other nine craft</i>

373
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:21,979
<i>are incoming northwest,
10 degrees.</i>

374
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,453
Copy, Graves.
Maintain combat formation.

375
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,355
Sustain the perimeter.

376
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:33,691
If heavy weapons don't work?

377
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:37,093
I don't know.
Okay?

378
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,562
We've exhausted all
possible signals

379
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:41,130
and frequencies trying
to contact this thing.

380
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:42,765
Now I'm down to a
speaker and a spotlight.

381
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,634
Look, I need to
learn everything I can

382
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:47,771
about the creatures
and their craft.

383
00:16:47,837 --> 00:16:50,039
I need you to get me as close
to that thing as possible.

384
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:51,741
I can take you to
the front line.

385
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:54,211
But, remember,
we're going in blind, Henry.

386
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:55,778
We don't know what could happen.

387
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:57,714
It's just sitting there waiting.

388
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,149
What do you think?

389
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:03,886
Listen, you were a scary man
back in basic.

390
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:07,156
But this?
We don't mess with this.

391
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:10,594
Get in, get your readings,
get out, okay?

392
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:13,396
Yeah.

393
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:15,531
- Ready?
- Yeah.

394
00:17:15,597 --> 00:17:16,966
I'll take point position.

395
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:22,338
Sir? I received a request
from 22nd Infantry.

396
00:17:22,404 --> 00:17:26,175
OC says, quote, "General Reed
knows we need to tear

397
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,845
"the throats out of
whatever's on that ship.

398
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:29,913
Forward the strike
request to Joint Chiefs."

399
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,583
Tell their CO
to hold their fire.

400
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,150
We might be able to deescalate.

401
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:35,384
Sir.

402
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:37,354
Dr. Fisher, any updates?

403
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,622
Uh, yeah, uh...

404
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,458
I've got Henry
sending live data.

405
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:44,227
Looks like radio
waves are nominal,

406
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:49,232
infrared, thermal,
optical, microwave...

407
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:52,568
Wait a minute.

408
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,037
We're getting a thermal reading.

409
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:56,673
There's movement
inside the craft!

410
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:04,047
Okay.

411
00:18:04,114 --> 00:18:05,848
Remember, if this goes south,

412
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:07,784
we've got the whole world
ready to toast this thing.

413
00:18:07,851 --> 00:18:11,821
I got soldiers posted there...
there... and there.

414
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:13,389
News crews are about
two hundred yards

415
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:15,158
behind us behind a barricade.

416
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,461
Take that as the initial
fallback marker.

417
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:20,663
<i>This is Pentagon, Omega,
for General Reed.</i>

418
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,231
Go for General Reed!

419
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:25,000
<i>General, assets will be
engaging the target</i>

420
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,703
<i>before it begins
its next maneuver.</i>

421
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:28,403
<i>We have an Air Force
coalition running</i>

422
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:30,740
<i>timed maneuvers spanning
the entire northeast region.</i>

423
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:34,310
<i>If Falcon detects any further
incoming, we may issue Defcon.</i>

424
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:36,545
Copy, Omega.

425
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:38,480
Okay, they're at 28,000 feet.

426
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:43,720
Now they're circling back
on New York, ETA 28 minutes.

427
00:18:43,787 --> 00:18:45,655
Henry, their ships
are closing in fast!

428
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:47,257
If you're gonna make contact,
do it now!

429
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:49,092
Fisher, if we don't hear
from these ships in 30 seconds,

430
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,694
there's a good chance the DOD

431
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,261
will launch a scorched-earth
assault on them.

432
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:55,331
The line between action and
intel is razor thin here.

433
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:57,300
Omega, we're standing by.

434
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:59,935
<i>Copy. Astronomical intel will
guide strategic response</i>

435
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:01,770
<i>until we decide otherwise.</i>

436
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:05,209
<i>We cannot afford loss of life
even by an extraterrestrial.</i>

437
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:10,813
Okay.

438
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:13,383
Let's try two short pulses
with the light,

439
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,152
then one long pulse.

440
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:21,924
Okay.

441
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:22,992
Now try the same
with the speaker.

442
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:25,295
Pull back! Pull back!

443
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:29,199
[howling]

444
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:31,000
That sound came from
under the ship!

445
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:34,503
There's something moving
from under there,

446
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,805
but I can't tell what it is.

447
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:50,688
Thank you.

448
00:19:59,797 --> 00:20:02,065
One of the spaceships
is in the park now.

449
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:04,301
Dad, when is Allison
coming home?

450
00:20:06,002 --> 00:20:09,772
The news is saying that the
ships actually came from Mars.

451
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,907
Wait. Is Allison still
at the observatory?

452
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:14,711
That's what I'm trying
to find out, honey.

453
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:15,813
Hey, how's your leg?

454
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:17,446
One to 10?

455
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:20,115
A seven. But, Dad, I don't
wanna stay here.

456
00:20:20,182 --> 00:20:21,784
I'd rather just deal
with it at home.

457
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:24,621
Is Allison gonna have
to go out there?

458
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:28,192
No, honey.
She studies planets.

459
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:31,260
She doesn't have to deal
with anything, you know...

460
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:32,362
dangerous.

461
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:34,364
Well, if you talk to her,
can you tell her

462
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,566
that I'm not mad that she wasn't
here while they fixed my leg?

463
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:39,736
And they're saying that the
spaceships could be hostile.

464
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:42,272
And just... What if she...

465
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:45,775
Honey, Allie knows
what she's doing.

466
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:49,112
She's safe, all right?

467
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,315
And she knows why you're upset.

468
00:20:52,915 --> 00:20:55,785
Dad! Oh, my God!
Look at this!

469
00:20:55,853 --> 00:20:57,888
My God, the ship is opening.

470
00:21:04,894 --> 00:21:08,331
Henry, you need to tell me
what's going on down there now!

471
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:12,869
<i>There's some kind of opening
in the bottom of the ship.</i>

472
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:14,837
<i>I think they're
coming out of the ship!</i>

473
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,274
Look, Henry don't do
anything stupid, okay?

474
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,810
Just get the data
and get back here!

475
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:23,480
<i>Henry, what do you see?</i>

476
00:21:27,784 --> 00:21:29,153
[shouting]

477
00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:36,226
I think they're trying
to communicate with us.

478
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:40,230
If they act aggressive,
I'm gonna have to open fire.

479
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:50,906
Just make sure you do
whatever it takes

480
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:53,576
to get away
and get clear, okay?

481
00:21:56,945 --> 00:22:00,817
<i>Allie, we just made contact.</i>

482
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:02,251
They're real.

483
00:22:03,987 --> 00:22:05,521
Wait a minute!

484
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:07,124
That's Uncle Henry!

485
00:22:15,664 --> 00:22:17,901
Captain, get out of there!

486
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:34,449
Henry, what's going on?

487
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:35,952
Ogilvy!

488
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:40,624
<i>Open fire! Open fire!</i>

489
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:42,326
[gunfire]

490
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:55,003
Ah!

491
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,939
Sir! The craft fired a weapon

492
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:58,575
and destroyed all of our
ground units completely!

493
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:01,510
<i>All units! Pull back to
perimeter within one mile!</i>

494
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:03,445
<i>Get all civilians in
the vicinity inside!</i>

495
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:05,848
Sir, I have received
confirmation

496
00:23:05,915 --> 00:23:08,250
that everything in
that area is lost!

497
00:23:08,317 --> 00:23:11,788
All the attack helicopters,
all artillery,

498
00:23:11,855 --> 00:23:15,224
and about 100 men...
missing, sir.

499
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:18,027
Be prepared to evacuate!

500
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:20,462
Doctor, we need that data now.

501
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:22,699
Henry, do you copy?

502
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:24,001
Henry, come in!

503
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:27,069
<i>Allie, they fired a weapon!</i>

504
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:28,471
<i>Some kind of laser!</i>

505
00:23:28,538 --> 00:23:30,941
<i>Everything is on fire
right now!</i>

506
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:34,711
Everything's been vaporized!

507
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:37,380
<i>Did you get the reading?</i>

508
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:39,615
Yeah.
Yeah, I got a reading.

509
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:43,819
It's five times more powerful
than a bolt of lightning.

510
00:23:43,886 --> 00:23:46,990
Their weapon system
is electrical.

511
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:55,031
They're powering up again.

512
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:57,567
They're gonna fire their laser
into the sky this time!

513
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:00,869
Ah!

514
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:02,738
[shouts]

515
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:04,973
<i>Henry, were you able to assess
the structure of the craft?</i>

516
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,277
Yes!

517
00:24:07,344 --> 00:24:10,212
They opened a portal of some
kind in the front of the craft,

518
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,281
though it appears seamless.

519
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:14,383
When the creature
came out, it looks like

520
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,319
they were trying to acclimate
themselves to our environment.

521
00:24:17,386 --> 00:24:20,522
You know, they changed colors,
kind of like an octopus.

522
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:21,857
Okay.

523
00:24:21,924 --> 00:24:24,626
Look, I ran an initial profile
of the data you sent.

524
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:26,695
Looks like their hulls appear
to be made of

525
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,932
a calcium, iron, carbon alloy.

526
00:24:28,998 --> 00:24:31,601
It's interacting with some
kind of biological matter.

527
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:36,005
But it also emitted massive
amounts of chlorine.

528
00:24:37,374 --> 00:24:39,675
<i>But's not producing
any ozone.</i>

529
00:24:39,742 --> 00:24:41,577
<i>Okay, what about the skin?</i>

530
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:44,213
<i>You said it was changing
colors like an octopus?</i>

531
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:47,817
Henry?

532
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:50,019
Henry, come in!

533
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:52,889
<i>Omega, C-double-zero...
all units!</i>

534
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:55,625
<i>The target has... the city!</i>

535
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:58,495
<i>All nine targets are descending
to 50,000 feet...!</i>

536
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:01,597
<i>Theta Command,
NASA, Falcon,</i>

537
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:03,566
<i>pull back to
Bravo Point Garrison!</i>

538
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,434
Sir, they're scrapping
field reconnaissance

539
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:07,769
and ordering all posts
to fall back.

540
00:25:07,836 --> 00:25:11,339
Doctor, you should pack up
whatever provisions you need

541
00:25:11,406 --> 00:25:13,076
and leave with us immediately.

542
00:25:14,376 --> 00:25:16,445
General, I can't leave with you!

543
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:18,413
If you want me to stay
and process data,

544
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,984
I need the telescope,
the imaging programs,

545
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,385
the laboratory!

546
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:25,020
Doctor, this city,
this whole area,

547
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:26,422
may be reduced to ashes soon.

548
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:28,191
They're starting
to evacuate the city now.

549
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:31,528
But my family is in the city.
I can't leave them.

550
00:25:31,595 --> 00:25:33,863
I understand, but you're
a mission critical resource.

551
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,199
I can't let you just go out
into an active military zone.

552
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:39,336
Well, you're not
detaining me, are you?

553
00:25:39,402 --> 00:25:41,805
No, absolutely not.
You are a civilian.

554
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:44,207
You're under no obligation
to follow orders.

555
00:25:44,273 --> 00:25:47,242
I am imploring you,
work with me

556
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:49,512
and you will save lives.

557
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:55,250
I'm sorry, General.
I can't go with you.

558
00:25:55,317 --> 00:25:57,220
Look, I can pack up
some equipment

559
00:25:57,287 --> 00:25:59,055
and set up a makeshift lab
once my family's safe

560
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:00,056
and out of the city.

561
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:01,825
But I can't go with you.

562
00:26:01,892 --> 00:26:03,326
Okay, look.

563
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:05,662
Take your radio,
stay in contact with me.

564
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:07,130
Do what you can.

565
00:26:07,196 --> 00:26:09,465
Any info you can give
to me will be helpful.

566
00:26:09,532 --> 00:26:10,567
Okay.

567
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:13,702
Let's go!

568
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:18,875
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

569
00:26:18,942 --> 00:26:20,410
<i>Are you and Henry safe?</i>

570
00:26:20,477 --> 00:26:23,245
Henry was at the landing zone.
He made it out alive.

571
00:26:23,311 --> 00:26:25,347
I'm heading over
to pick you up right now.

572
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:27,383
If the other spacecraft
head to the city

573
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,519
and something happens
to either one of us...

574
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:32,087
[sighs]

575
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:33,221
Is Junie okay?

576
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:34,789
<i>Yeah, she's doing better,</i>

577
00:26:34,856 --> 00:26:37,193
<i>but I think her leg is
still bothering her.</i>

578
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:38,927
Getting her in and
out of the cab this morning

579
00:26:38,994 --> 00:26:40,562
didn't help either.

580
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,299
Well, let her know I'm coming
to pick both of you up.

581
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:45,201
<i>I'm going to take you guys
to the bunker</i>

582
00:26:45,268 --> 00:26:46,236
<i>at your family's farm.</i>

583
00:26:46,301 --> 00:26:47,369
So we're evacuating then?

584
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:49,239
<i>Yes, we're evacuating asap!</i>

585
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:50,907
<i>Look, have her ready,
I'm almost there.</i>

586
00:26:50,973 --> 00:26:52,274
Okay. Hey, listen.

587
00:26:52,342 --> 00:26:54,076
Be careful.

588
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:56,211
- I love you.
- <i>I love you.</i>

589
00:26:56,278 --> 00:26:58,347
<i>All stations prepare to move
all non-critical patients...</i>

590
00:26:58,413 --> 00:27:00,416
Dad, what's going on?

591
00:27:03,385 --> 00:27:05,187
We gotta get out of
here right away.

592
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,459
Is Allison coming?

593
00:27:09,526 --> 00:27:11,294
Yep, she's on her way right now.

594
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,162
And we're gonna go
to Grandma and Grandpa's farm

595
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:14,998
until it's safer to come back.

596
00:27:15,064 --> 00:27:16,533
You ready?
Hold on to me.

597
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:40,390
Falcon intel?
This is Fisher. Do you copy?

598
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,363
Falcon, this is Fisher.
Do you copy?

599
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:51,333
I was worried you weren't
gonna make it back.

600
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:52,769
There are a lot of
people working really hard

601
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:54,971
to make sure all of us are okay,
including me.

602
00:27:55,037 --> 00:27:56,471
Hey, Allie, you really
think running into gridlock's

603
00:27:56,538 --> 00:27:57,740
the best way to go?

604
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,442
Honey, I hear what
you're saying,

605
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:00,410
but staying here is not
gonna help us either.

606
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:01,912
You see what they did?

607
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:04,180
Yeah, I did.
We both did.

608
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:05,582
We gotta get out
before they lock us down

609
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,683
and the ships start
attacking the city.

610
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,518
How's your leg?

611
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:09,885
I'm doing okay right now.

612
00:28:09,952 --> 00:28:11,654
They only had to put
in four more pins.

613
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:13,222
Only four, huh?

614
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:17,860
If I move too quick,
it's like a stabbing pain.

615
00:28:17,926 --> 00:28:20,996
We're gonna get you somewhere
safe and sound.

616
00:28:21,063 --> 00:28:23,199
And promise me you're not
gonna do any more rail slides

617
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:24,934
off of three flights
of stairs?

618
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,568
Okay, it's called a grind

619
00:28:26,635 --> 00:28:29,838
and it was only one flight
of stairs, and I promise.

620
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:35,044
Are we even gonna
make it out of here?

621
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:38,982
Yeah. We'll be okay once we get
past the Queensboro Bridge.

622
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:42,251
They're they are!

623
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:43,853
They're flying in formation.

624
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:58,867
[howling]

625
00:29:07,476 --> 00:29:10,813
Dispatch! This is Captain Fisher
from Falcon intel!

626
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,981
Come in!

627
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:14,683
<i>Captain, this is
Command Dispatch.</i>

628
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,420
<i>[static]
We... all incoming...</i>

629
00:29:17,487 --> 00:29:18,888
Command Dispatch,
this is Captain Fisher.

630
00:29:18,954 --> 00:29:21,089
All of our transport's
been destroyed!

631
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:23,491
We need Evac now! Come in!

632
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:27,163
<i>This is General Reed.
Go for Henry Fisher.</i>

633
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:29,432
This is Fisher!
Go, go!

634
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:31,300
<i>Presence of the nine
of craft is creating</i>

635
00:29:31,366 --> 00:29:34,269
<i>an electromagnetic
disturbance...</i>

636
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:37,039
Get out now!
Get out now!

637
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,110
Please, this is our only
way out of the city.

638
00:29:42,178 --> 00:29:44,780
Get out, both of you, now! Now!

639
00:29:44,846 --> 00:29:47,017
[grunts]

640
00:29:49,318 --> 00:29:51,319
You okay?

641
00:29:51,386 --> 00:29:54,256
- Yeah, okay.
- Are you okay?

642
00:29:54,324 --> 00:29:57,527
Hey, are you heading south?

643
00:29:57,594 --> 00:29:59,495
I'm sorry. We can't take
you where you need to go.

644
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:01,229
Rebecca, we need to get
to my mom.

645
00:30:01,297 --> 00:30:02,265
Come on!
No, no, no, no!

646
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,332
This is my ID right here.

647
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,035
I'm a former military officer.

648
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:09,105
Please. I just came
from the landing site.

649
00:30:09,171 --> 00:30:10,506
I work in an observatory!

650
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:13,209
We're doing research
on the attack.

651
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:14,611
Please?

652
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:17,446
He did just stop us
from getting mugged.

653
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:18,981
But you said
we're out of gas.

654
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:21,417
We're not stopping for gasoline!

655
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:25,355
- Okay, get in.
- Thank you.

656
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:38,099
<i>The first ship to land
just joined the other nine.</i>

657
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,701
You guys, look at this.

658
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:42,270
<i>I'm so scared.
I don't know what to tell you.</i>

659
00:30:42,337 --> 00:30:44,240
They made it into the city.

660
00:30:44,307 --> 00:30:46,041
There's no way of
attacking them now

661
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:47,776
without endangering everyone.

662
00:30:47,844 --> 00:30:51,580
<i>I've seen like 50 fighter jets
keep circling around.</i>

663
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:54,716
<i>I don't know what
they're gonna do.</i>

664
00:30:54,784 --> 00:30:59,455
<i>People are, like, evacuating.</i>

665
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:01,057
<i>The city is in chaos!</i>

666
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,730
The bunker is around back.

667
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:09,432
Well, make yourself at home.

668
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:16,004
- You okay?
- Yeah.

669
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:21,377
Do you really think we're
gonna be able to stop them?

670
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:24,981
Don't worry about that
right now, okay?

671
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:26,816
The military is doing
everything they can

672
00:31:26,882 --> 00:31:28,751
to keep us safe
and I'm trying to help.

673
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:36,726
What are you setting up?

674
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:39,594
A lab, kind of
like we have at work.

675
00:31:39,662 --> 00:31:42,664
It doesn't look
like much of a lab.

676
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:45,567
Oh, yeah?
How many labs did you bring?

677
00:31:53,643 --> 00:31:56,211
What is that?

678
00:31:56,278 --> 00:31:58,180
This is a picture of what
NASA believes to be

679
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:02,919
bacteria taken from the sample
from our Mars Rover Opportunity.

680
00:32:02,984 --> 00:32:05,620
And this is from
the meteorite that hit earth

681
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:08,524
about a year ago verified
to be from Mars.

682
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:13,028
And this is a picture of the
ship's hull taken this morning.

683
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:16,332
When I saw the hull,
I wanted to compare them.

684
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,033
They all look the same.

685
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:19,602
Yeah.

686
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,037
Yeah, that's because
the ship's hull

687
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:23,605
is an iron, calcium,
carbon protein alloy.

688
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,208
And then both
the Rover sample

689
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:29,077
and the meteorite samples
show these vacuoles of calcium

690
00:32:29,144 --> 00:32:33,016
left behind from some
unidentified chemical process.

691
00:32:38,186 --> 00:32:40,423
But see, this calcification
process occurred

692
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,824
extremely rapidly.

693
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:44,127
I mean, over days, not years.

694
00:32:45,827 --> 00:32:47,863
I think the aliens
might have sent this meteorite

695
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,833
to test how our atmosphere
would affect them.

696
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,704
Which could give us clues
on how to stop them.

697
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,574
Allison, look at this!

698
00:33:24,232 --> 00:33:26,067
What's... What's going on?

699
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:27,502
What's that?

700
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:29,071
The car's dead.

701
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:36,678
It's an electromagnetic pulse.

702
00:33:36,746 --> 00:33:39,381
Luckily this device
is shielded from EMPs.

703
00:33:39,448 --> 00:33:42,418
Yeah, but why are they shooting
straight up into the sky?

704
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:45,221
Well, their weapons give off
a huge electrical charge.

705
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:49,391
But I mean,
it could be deliberate,

706
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:50,793
to give off those EMPs,

707
00:33:50,858 --> 00:33:53,596
to knock out electricity
as far as possible.

708
00:33:53,663 --> 00:33:56,531
Allie? Come in, Allie.
This is Henry.

709
00:33:56,598 --> 00:33:59,034
Looks like they're headed east.
Can you confirm that?

710
00:33:59,102 --> 00:34:00,236
Allie?

711
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:04,173
- Any signal?
- Nothing.

712
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:05,674
It's dead.

713
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:08,876
Did you see that?

714
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:11,047
Our weapons barely
scratched them!

715
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,820
Yeah, it's like
they have some sort of shield.

716
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:19,621
You know, Henry managed
to get a reading from

717
00:34:19,688 --> 00:34:21,690
the actual blast off
the ship's heat ray.

718
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:23,492
He said the charge
was electrical,

719
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:25,260
but didn't generate any ozone.

720
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:28,731
Isn't that the smell you
get after a lightning strike?

721
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:30,699
Yes, that's right.

722
00:34:30,766 --> 00:34:33,903
But it generated
a ton of chlorine.

723
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,338
[sighs]

724
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:38,306
Okay.

725
00:34:38,373 --> 00:34:40,775
All right, so they fire
electricity straight up

726
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:44,413
into the air
not to create ozone

727
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:47,082
but because they know
will interact with the sodium

728
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,619
in our water vapor
in our atmosphere.

729
00:34:51,887 --> 00:34:54,890
They're trying to create
their own chlorofluorocarbons

730
00:34:54,956 --> 00:34:56,391
to destroy our ozone layer!

731
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,161
Yeah, but why would
they want to do that?

732
00:34:58,226 --> 00:35:00,261
Because Mars doesn't
have an ozone layer.

733
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:01,997
They know they won't
survive unless they can

734
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:03,799
turn earth into
a new Mars!

735
00:35:03,865 --> 00:35:07,302
I mean, the ozone elimination,
the nitrogen depletion,

736
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:09,172
thinning of the atmosphere?

737
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:11,272
That's why they have
the energy shields!

738
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,175
Because they know that
their organic systems

739
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:15,711
will most likely fail when
exposed to our atmosphere,

740
00:35:15,777 --> 00:35:17,179
leaving behind calcium deposits

741
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:19,615
just like the ones
in that picture!

742
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,152
[howling]

743
00:35:28,724 --> 00:35:32,327
All the electronics were knocked
out by an electromagnetic pulse.

744
00:35:41,903 --> 00:35:44,739
How could an electromagnetic
pulse knock out my car?

745
00:35:44,806 --> 00:35:46,074
I don't get it.

746
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:48,676
Look, a pulse like that
is far-reaching.

747
00:35:48,744 --> 00:35:51,146
It affects the earth's
magnetic field.

748
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:54,516
It's like a solar flare
or an atomic bomb.

749
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:57,552
You're not saying they detonated
a nuclear weapon, are you?

750
00:35:57,619 --> 00:35:59,121
Oh, no, no.

751
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:00,756
They would have taken us
out with that.

752
00:36:00,822 --> 00:36:03,558
Listen, the Department
of Defense is trying

753
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:06,362
every tactical maneuver to
come up with a good defense.

754
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:08,664
Dropping a nuclear bomb
on New York City

755
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:10,232
doesn't make
any sense right now.

756
00:36:10,298 --> 00:36:12,367
My mom's in a nursing
home on the island.

757
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:13,769
Alina...

758
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:15,670
That smell is much
stronger out here now.

759
00:36:15,737 --> 00:36:16,739
Are we getting
poisoned right now?

760
00:36:16,806 --> 00:36:17,807
No, listen.

761
00:36:17,873 --> 00:36:19,375
Given their advanced technology,

762
00:36:19,442 --> 00:36:21,677
if they were really gonna
deploy some sort of agent,

763
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:24,113
it would have killed us already.

764
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:26,514
Look, if we can make
it to the observatory,

765
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:29,451
it's protected by the military.

766
00:36:29,518 --> 00:36:33,956
And once it's safe,
we can go find your mom.

767
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:35,591
Alina, you saw the video
of what that ship

768
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:37,359
did to those helicopters.

769
00:36:37,425 --> 00:36:39,061
Now there's 10 of them.

770
00:36:39,128 --> 00:36:40,997
Well, we have no radio.
The car battery's fried.

771
00:36:41,063 --> 00:36:43,031
The observatory's only
a few miles away.

772
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,001
It's time to start walking.

773
00:36:53,275 --> 00:36:56,012
Thank you for helping us
to the observatory.

774
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,414
And thank you for
helping us back there.

775
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:01,117
Thanks for giving me a ride.

776
00:37:01,182 --> 00:37:03,452
I just don't understand
why they're attacking us.

777
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:05,319
Well, since there haven't
been any more than

778
00:37:05,387 --> 00:37:06,755
the initial 10 aircraft,

779
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:08,157
I suspect they're using
New York City

780
00:37:08,222 --> 00:37:11,360
as a trial run for
a much larger attack.

781
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:15,164
If that's the case, that means
they intend on staying here.

782
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:17,166
And if they intend on
staying here,

783
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:19,368
they're gonna have
to make this place a lot more

784
00:37:19,434 --> 00:37:21,302
habitable like Mars.

785
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,137
How do you
know they're from Mars?

786
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:26,375
We confirmed it through our
telescopes at the observatory.

787
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,113
Their ships produce a chloride
gas which kills nitrogen.

788
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:34,482
If they wanna make
this more habitable,

789
00:37:34,548 --> 00:37:37,286
they're gonna have to make
our atmosphere ozone-free.

790
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:38,921
But that would take
a long time, wouldn't it?

791
00:37:38,987 --> 00:37:41,923
'Cause there's only
10 of them, right?

792
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,492
Not necessarily.

793
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:46,762
I mean, their ships produce
a chlorofluorocarbon gas.

794
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:50,332
This gas rapidly destroys
our atmosphere.

795
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:54,536
And if they're gonna make earth
more habitable like Mars,

796
00:37:54,603 --> 00:37:56,771
they're gonna have
to eliminate the ozone

797
00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:59,041
and leave nothing but oxygen.

798
00:37:59,108 --> 00:38:01,910
And that would affect the mass
of the entire planet?

799
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:03,545
That can't be possible.

800
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:05,847
If they ignite the oxygen,
it will burn off the oceans.

801
00:38:05,914 --> 00:38:07,449
And the earth is mostly ocean.

802
00:38:07,516 --> 00:38:09,518
Which would make
the Earth's gravitational pull

803
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:10,853
the same as Mars.

804
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:16,025
I can't get what I need here.

805
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:18,560
I have to go back.

806
00:38:29,036 --> 00:38:30,505
What are you doing?

807
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:33,276
I need to go to the observatory.
It's the only way.

808
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:35,277
What?

809
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,181
Look, we're safe here
for a while,

810
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:42,284
but not forever,
and not for long.

811
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:45,054
They had troops, Air Force,
heavy weapons

812
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,088
all surrounding them,
all firing at them

813
00:38:47,155 --> 00:38:49,258
trying to stop them,
and it did nothing.

814
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:51,359
- Allie...
- And now they are on the move

815
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:52,961
and we don't know where
they're going or how fast

816
00:38:53,027 --> 00:38:55,096
or what else they can do.

817
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:58,567
But we know they want to wipe us
out, as much as possible.

818
00:38:58,634 --> 00:39:00,769
Someone's gotta stop them.

819
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:02,403
Allie...

820
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:03,905
I have to stop them.

821
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:09,912
Allison, you cannot
go back out there!

822
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:12,914
Listen, when they
evacuated us this morning,

823
00:39:12,981 --> 00:39:15,382
I wanted the military
just to wipe them out!

824
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:19,721
I thought they would,
but they didn't.

825
00:39:19,788 --> 00:39:23,626
Look, they sent one of their top
generals to me this morning

826
00:39:23,692 --> 00:39:25,860
because NASA doesn't even know
what they're doing.

827
00:39:25,927 --> 00:39:28,297
They consulted me.

828
00:39:28,364 --> 00:39:29,865
The only way to make
sure the aliens

829
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:32,601
don't get to you and Junie
is to stop them!

830
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:38,975
I have been studying
Mars my entire life.

831
00:39:40,842 --> 00:39:42,143
I can beat them.

832
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:48,217
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

833
00:39:51,686 --> 00:39:52,922
Allie...

834
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,129
The car's parked underground.

835
00:40:00,195 --> 00:40:01,929
It shouldn't have been
affected by the EMP.

836
00:40:01,996 --> 00:40:03,565
Allison, no!

837
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:10,605
Honey, I know, okay?
I know.

838
00:40:10,672 --> 00:40:13,541
But we have to be strong to get
through this together, okay?

839
00:40:14,909 --> 00:40:16,311
- Yeah.
- Okay.

840
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:28,423
You guys will
be safe here, okay?

841
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,930
- I love you.
- I love you.

842
00:40:42,103 --> 00:40:43,571
I am coming back.

843
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:01,958
[sirens blaring]

844
00:41:07,663 --> 00:41:08,896
Sir, I can't get

845
00:41:08,963 --> 00:41:10,599
our communication systems
back online.

846
00:41:10,664 --> 00:41:13,534
We need to establish a new
perimeter outside of the city.

847
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:15,170
No. No.

848
00:41:15,237 --> 00:41:17,206
You saw the footage
with your own eyes.

849
00:41:17,273 --> 00:41:19,408
Our troops were routed every
time they went to engage them.

850
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:23,711
Sir... the D.O.D. has evacuated
several military installations

851
00:41:23,778 --> 00:41:25,414
throughout New York State,

852
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:28,351
with transport straight
to the Pentagon.

853
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:30,685
We may want
to consider doing the same.

854
00:41:30,753 --> 00:41:32,188
Did they evacuate this one?

855
00:41:33,655 --> 00:41:35,290
No, sir.

856
00:41:35,356 --> 00:41:36,458
It's just that some of the
other officers recommended...

857
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:40,061
What? What?
That we evacuate?

858
00:41:41,362 --> 00:41:43,465
Sir.

859
00:41:43,532 --> 00:41:48,170
Until the Pentagon gives
the order, we stay!

860
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,340
You saved the data from the
observatory, pull it up.

861
00:41:52,407 --> 00:41:53,708
Yes, sir.

862
00:41:57,012 --> 00:41:58,714
Lieutenant...

863
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,682
Lieutenant, listen to me.

864
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,121
We can run.
I hear you.

865
00:42:06,186 --> 00:42:09,990
We can run or we can stay

866
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:12,059
and defend peoples' lives.

867
00:42:12,126 --> 00:42:14,096
These creatures have
an energy shield.

868
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:18,632
Nothing would through it,
but it isn't perfect.

869
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:21,335
I don't care what enemy
we're dealing with.

870
00:42:21,402 --> 00:42:24,606
No one has unlimited resources.

871
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:28,176
We will find out
their imperfection

872
00:42:28,242 --> 00:42:31,313
and we will use it
to destroy them.

873
00:42:34,182 --> 00:42:36,318
This is Fisher to Falcon
Observatory!

874
00:42:37,885 --> 00:42:39,554
Fisher to Falcon Observatory!

875
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:40,722
Come in, Falcon!

876
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:46,494
[crash]

877
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:12,454
[howling]

878
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:32,842
[howling, explosions]

879
00:43:40,481 --> 00:43:41,550
Sir!
Sir, excuse me.

880
00:43:41,617 --> 00:43:43,018
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

881
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:44,786
I have to get back...

882
00:43:44,853 --> 00:43:47,322
New York is under a mandatory
evacuation or shelter in place.

883
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:49,057
There's no foot
traffic through here!

884
00:43:49,123 --> 00:43:51,726
I have business with General
Reed at the Falcon Observatory.

885
00:43:51,793 --> 00:43:53,261
I'm Dr. Allison Fisher.

886
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:54,295
This is an active war
zone admitting

887
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:55,530
only authorized personnel.

888
00:43:55,597 --> 00:43:56,831
Okay.

889
00:44:01,603 --> 00:44:03,438
The observatory's
quite a way away,

890
00:44:03,505 --> 00:44:05,507
probably another five miles.

891
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:08,244
Has anyone been able to
reestablish communication?

892
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:10,711
There's some generators,
most of them fried.

893
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:14,115
But we were able to charge up
some of the radios.

894
00:44:14,181 --> 00:44:15,683
They're huddling back up.

895
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:19,488
They split apart, attack us
and huddle back up.

896
00:44:19,554 --> 00:44:21,623
They're Tripods, That's what
the Command called them.

897
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,393
[howling]

898
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,528
Easton?
What do you see?

899
00:44:26,594 --> 00:44:28,496
They're about two miles out
from me, Sergeant.

900
00:44:28,563 --> 00:44:32,166
I saw them just above
the tree line.

901
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:33,735
Yeah.

902
00:44:35,003 --> 00:44:39,340
They started attacking
some residential areas.

903
00:44:39,407 --> 00:44:42,878
It was a slaughterhouse.

904
00:44:42,943 --> 00:44:44,813
We weren't able
to retreat fast enough.

905
00:44:45,681 --> 00:44:48,250
Planes dropping out of the sky,

906
00:44:48,317 --> 00:44:51,286
bodies everywhere like shadows.

907
00:44:51,353 --> 00:44:53,355
Ashes everywhere.

908
00:44:56,958 --> 00:44:59,527
You heard the radio.
It's about two miles that way.

909
00:44:59,594 --> 00:45:01,296
What's your business
with the general?

910
00:45:01,362 --> 00:45:04,766
I... I have to get
to the observatory.

911
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:07,202
I have intel on the Martians
that might help us

912
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:08,736
develop a weapon
to use against them.

913
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:12,141
But I have to get to the
observatory lab to run the test!

914
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,843
This is Sergeant Holleran
to Intel One.

915
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:16,777
<i>Intel One, go!</i>

916
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:18,512
I have Dr. Allison Fisher
from Falcon requesting

917
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:20,047
transpo to the theater.

918
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:21,715
<i>The enemy got within
three hundred yards</i>

919
00:45:21,782 --> 00:45:23,617
<i>of the observatory
about an hour ago.</i>

920
00:45:23,684 --> 00:45:25,653
<i>Without planes or satellites,
we can't tell if</i>

921
00:45:25,721 --> 00:45:27,722
<i>the observatory's
still standing.</i>

922
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,859
[howling]

923
00:45:31,927 --> 00:45:34,229
Sergeant, have any
of your units been able

924
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:35,764
to inflict damage
on the Tripods?

925
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:37,465
Not that I've seen,
but we'll get them.

926
00:45:37,532 --> 00:45:39,300
We're sending in some big tanks
with big guns

927
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:41,702
like you've never seen before,
heavy-duty stuff,

928
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:43,070
top secret stuff.

929
00:45:43,137 --> 00:45:44,905
I need you to take me
straight to the front line.

930
00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:46,307
Trust me, you don't want to see
what those things can do.

931
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:48,077
I know exactly what they can do!

932
00:45:48,143 --> 00:45:50,711
Right now, I need to get
close enough to study them

933
00:45:50,778 --> 00:45:52,579
to get a good idea
how they operate,

934
00:45:52,646 --> 00:45:54,415
what their weaknesses are.

935
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:55,949
Otherwise, there's
a good chance our weapons

936
00:45:56,016 --> 00:45:57,385
won't even scratch them.

937
00:45:59,855 --> 00:46:01,121
[gasps]

938
00:46:01,188 --> 00:46:02,724
We have to move now!

939
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,663
Look!

940
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:12,468
They're powering up again.
Get down!

941
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:14,169
They're gonna fire into
the atmosphere!

942
00:46:14,235 --> 00:46:15,670
Get down!
Get down!

943
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,750
Stay back.
Stay right there.

944
00:46:30,851 --> 00:46:33,120
They're spreading apart
right now, you see?

945
00:46:33,188 --> 00:46:34,490
They're about to attack.

946
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:36,858
I don't get it.

947
00:46:36,925 --> 00:46:38,393
Our weapons are not
even affecting them!

948
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,262
They will.
We have more coming in.

949
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:43,332
You have to stay here,
stay safe.

950
00:46:43,398 --> 00:46:44,767
You have to make it
to the observatory.

951
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,902
Wait, wait!
Where are you going?

952
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:50,838
Those are my men.
I gotta do my part.

953
00:46:50,905 --> 00:46:52,373
Wait, no!

954
00:47:04,284 --> 00:47:05,520
Oh!

955
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:12,961
Are they going to fire again?

956
00:47:16,597 --> 00:47:20,001
- Run! Go!
- [screams]

957
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:35,649
Please!
Help me, please!

958
00:47:35,717 --> 00:47:38,052
Get it off me!
Help me, please!

959
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:39,621
- Come on.
- Get it off me!

960
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:42,390
- Please get it off me, please!
- Pull, pull!

961
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:44,492
Get it off me!
Get it off me!

962
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:47,195
- Please, get it off me!
- Pull!

963
00:47:47,262 --> 00:47:50,065
Get it off me!
Ah!

964
00:47:51,032 --> 00:47:52,800
Go, go!
Come on.

965
00:47:59,574 --> 00:48:01,242
Those creatures or whatever
they were,

966
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:03,644
how were they able to
take down an entire bridge?

967
00:48:03,711 --> 00:48:05,313
Seemed like they were
drawn straight to us,

968
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,314
like they were trying
to kill us!

969
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,748
Okay, hold on.

970
00:48:07,815 --> 00:48:10,451
I think they're drawn
to anything organic.

971
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:13,053
You see, it's like a
Kudzu vine on steroids.

972
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:14,722
Wait. What does that mean?

973
00:48:14,789 --> 00:48:16,557
When I was stationed in Japan,

974
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:18,092
they had these vines,
these Kudzu vines.

975
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:20,828
And the locals had
to constantly prune them down

976
00:48:20,896 --> 00:48:22,964
or kill them,
or anything.

977
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,199
Otherwise, they would
overtake the village.

978
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:27,469
So the Martians planted
an invasive species?

979
00:48:27,536 --> 00:48:29,403
They're trying to.
That's basically it.

980
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:31,139
By feeding on nitrogen,

981
00:48:31,206 --> 00:48:33,142
they could have this placed
terraformed in a week.

982
00:48:39,114 --> 00:48:40,882
[howling]

983
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:55,497
[gasps]

984
00:48:57,532 --> 00:49:00,135
[coughing]

985
00:49:12,313 --> 00:49:15,783
Just stick to the tree line
and be quiet.

986
00:49:19,353 --> 00:49:21,088
Run!

987
00:49:21,155 --> 00:49:22,858
Come on!

988
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:32,100
[howling]

989
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:34,670
Come on! In here!
Come here, come here!

990
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:51,752
Go! Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

991
00:49:51,818 --> 00:49:53,621
That way.
That way... now!

992
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,900
[coughing]

993
00:50:10,472 --> 00:50:13,842
Come on! Get inside!
Get inside!

994
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:16,344
Get cloth under the door!
Block the windows!

995
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:17,945
There's still people out there!

996
00:50:22,184 --> 00:50:25,452
- Open the door!
- No! Don't open it!

997
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:26,454
Don't open the door!

998
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:28,823
What do we do now?

999
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:31,625
I don't know, but I have
to get to the observatory

1000
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:34,763
or all of this data
is for nothing.

1001
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:37,398
Play the footage
from Central Park again.

1002
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:39,468
You can see it.
Here.

1003
00:50:39,534 --> 00:50:41,403
An F-35 collides
with the shield.

1004
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:42,903
No effect on the spacecraft.

1005
00:50:42,971 --> 00:50:44,204
Wait. Stop right there.

1006
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:45,673
What's that?

1007
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:47,175
It's an interference pattern
on the screen.

1008
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,244
It can't always
handle high-resolution images

1009
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:50,578
from the observatory.

1010
00:50:50,646 --> 00:50:51,946
It stops right
beyond the spacecraft.

1011
00:50:52,012 --> 00:50:53,114
What's the resolution
on this laptop?

1012
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:54,650
1080.

1013
00:50:54,715 --> 00:50:56,483
And these are interference
wavelengths, Lieutenant?

1014
00:50:56,550 --> 00:51:00,121
The energy shield is vibrating
at an incredibly high frequency.

1015
00:51:00,188 --> 00:51:03,925
If conventional weapons won't
work in a frequency this dense,

1016
00:51:03,992 --> 00:51:06,861
then not even radiation
will break through.

1017
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:11,165
We'd need something measuring
400 kilojoules at least,

1018
00:51:11,233 --> 00:51:12,934
and an ultrahigh Hertz.

1019
00:51:13,001 --> 00:51:15,136
We have laser weapons both here
and at the Pentagon, right?

1020
00:51:15,202 --> 00:51:16,838
All our military-grade
laser weapons

1021
00:51:16,905 --> 00:51:18,973
have been disabled from the EMP.

1022
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:21,143
The Falcon Observatory
has a laser.

1023
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:23,444
Can it be modified
to fire on them?

1024
00:51:23,512 --> 00:51:26,648
Theoretically, we could route
all the energy to the laser

1025
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:30,251
and recalibrate it to fire at
an extremely high frequency.

1026
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:32,620
But all the observatory systems
are shut down

1027
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:33,688
because of the EMP.

1028
00:51:33,753 --> 00:51:35,089
Doesn't matter.

1029
00:51:35,155 --> 00:51:37,291
Send a priority alert
over their network

1030
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:38,592
repeating every 15 minutes.

1031
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:39,827
Give them the specifications.

1032
00:51:39,894 --> 00:51:41,862
Let's just hope one of them,

1033
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:44,231
you know, makes it back
in time to receive it.

1034
00:51:44,298 --> 00:51:45,333
Sir.

1035
00:51:54,742 --> 00:51:57,077
Hey, hey, hey!
Over here, over here.

1036
00:51:57,144 --> 00:51:59,079
Get down!

1037
00:51:59,146 --> 00:52:01,349
I know where there's shelter.

1038
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:03,385
- I'm Chris.
- Allison.

1039
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,588
[screaming]

1040
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:08,422
Those are the others.

1041
00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:12,059
We were on the south bridge
when these gigantic red vines

1042
00:52:12,126 --> 00:52:14,596
pulled the whole bridge down.

1043
00:52:14,663 --> 00:52:16,297
Me and a few others made it out.

1044
00:52:16,364 --> 00:52:20,434
But the machines, they just
kept following

1045
00:52:20,501 --> 00:52:22,771
and killing us in herds.

1046
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:26,307
They've been hunting and
killing us since the bridge.

1047
00:52:26,373 --> 00:52:32,313
They followed us right into the
trees and started eating us.

1048
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,516
Wait. That's...

1049
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:35,849
That's why they didn't
just start

1050
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:37,485
spraying the planet
and planting.

1051
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:38,953
They don't have any food,

1052
00:52:39,021 --> 00:52:42,256
so they have to eat us
to keep going.

1053
00:52:42,322 --> 00:52:44,960
You said the vines were red
and they move independently?

1054
00:52:45,027 --> 00:52:46,226
Yeah.

1055
00:52:46,293 --> 00:52:47,661
They just kept...

1056
00:52:47,728 --> 00:52:49,664
[stomping]

1057
00:53:13,655 --> 00:53:16,758
There it is.
We're almost there.

1058
00:53:17,657 --> 00:53:19,094
Okay, let's go.

1059
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:32,706
Hey, Chris?
What are you doing?

1060
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:35,143
I'm an aircraft mechanic.

1061
00:53:35,208 --> 00:53:38,312
I worked for a company in
New Mexico for over 30 years.

1062
00:53:41,248 --> 00:53:44,251
The engine looked intact
from outside.

1063
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:48,188
The fuel gauge would show
empty if there's a leak.

1064
00:53:48,255 --> 00:53:52,025
This plane's off because a
circuit was broken on impact.

1065
00:53:52,092 --> 00:53:54,795
And generally, there's
a small tool kit

1066
00:53:54,862 --> 00:53:57,732
up above the copilot side
for emergency fixes.

1067
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:05,272
And if you can give me a
hand and maybe it moves off...

1068
00:54:07,574 --> 00:54:10,811
you can seal the connection
to the fuel regulator.

1069
00:54:14,849 --> 00:54:16,485
[grunts]

1070
00:54:18,585 --> 00:54:20,221
Chris, keep it down.

1071
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,329
I'm pretty sure they're gone.

1072
00:54:28,396 --> 00:54:30,198
[howling]

1073
00:54:39,173 --> 00:54:40,976
Please, please,
please, please.

1074
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:02,297
Chris, they're right outside.

1075
00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:06,833
Okay, quick!

1076
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,168
Shut all the blinds!

1077
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:08,969
[thud]

1078
00:55:09,036 --> 00:55:10,504
Keep it down!

1079
00:55:15,043 --> 00:55:16,478
Don't let them hear us.

1080
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:28,990
What's it doing?

1081
00:55:29,056 --> 00:55:30,559
It's just standing there.

1082
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:39,766
The sun's starting to go down.

1083
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,835
It's not even moving.
It's just...

1084
00:55:41,902 --> 00:55:43,571
It's like it's
standing at attention.

1085
00:55:46,407 --> 00:55:48,809
I can't stay here.

1086
00:55:48,876 --> 00:55:51,046
I've got
to get to the observatory.

1087
00:55:51,112 --> 00:55:52,579
But I know if one of us
goes out there,

1088
00:55:52,646 --> 00:55:55,615
it's just gonna pick us
right off on the grass.

1089
00:55:55,682 --> 00:55:57,351
[grunts]

1090
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:07,394
Well, we can't just leave it out
there waiting for it to kill us.

1091
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:19,441
It's just like
it's guarding the plane.

1092
00:56:23,811 --> 00:56:26,581
We're just going to have
to stay here until it leaves.

1093
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:28,617
Try to keep quiet.

1094
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:35,890
Hey.

1095
00:56:35,956 --> 00:56:37,391
Where are you going?

1096
00:56:39,793 --> 00:56:41,161
Chris?

1097
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:43,265
Chris?

1098
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:46,634
What are you doing?

1099
00:56:46,701 --> 00:56:49,704
Looks like they got
cold turkey sandwiches.

1100
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:51,106
Want one?

1101
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:54,409
Kinda.

1102
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:57,946
Thanks.

1103
00:57:03,317 --> 00:57:04,985
[coughs]

1104
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:11,458
The cockpit radio's broken,

1105
00:57:11,525 --> 00:57:15,128
but I think I can fix
a couple shorted wires.

1106
00:57:15,195 --> 00:57:17,197
Lets wait until
they're gone to do that.

1107
00:57:18,831 --> 00:57:20,367
It's a good idea, though.

1108
00:57:23,903 --> 00:57:25,338
[grunts]

1109
00:57:25,405 --> 00:57:27,041
Things hurting
pretty bad, huh?

1110
00:57:27,108 --> 00:57:30,278
Yeah. It still hurts pretty bad.

1111
00:57:33,914 --> 00:57:35,182
Okay, hang on.

1112
00:57:45,092 --> 00:57:46,560
Here.

1113
00:57:51,132 --> 00:57:53,001
Here.
Lift your arm.

1114
00:57:57,639 --> 00:57:59,541
It still stings.

1115
00:58:06,447 --> 00:58:09,451
You think those Tripod
creatures sleep?

1116
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:13,721
Just close your eyes.

1117
00:58:13,786 --> 00:58:15,356
Try to get some rest.

1118
00:58:16,956 --> 00:58:18,659
I'll take the first watch.

1119
00:58:18,726 --> 00:58:21,429
No, no.
I'll do it.

1120
00:58:21,496 --> 00:58:23,731
You're with
the Defense Department.

1121
00:58:23,797 --> 00:58:26,768
You'll need to focus.

1122
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:28,569
I'll take the first watch

1123
00:58:30,338 --> 00:58:32,240
I'll wake you up
in a few hours.

1124
00:58:40,947 --> 00:58:42,516
Thanks.

1125
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:52,660
[grunts]

1126
00:59:05,105 --> 00:59:08,074
- [boom]
- What was that?

1127
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:09,409
It's moving again!

1128
00:59:09,476 --> 00:59:11,512
And it just fired
at something outside!

1129
00:59:12,914 --> 00:59:14,782
Chris!

1130
00:59:14,849 --> 00:59:16,284
Chris, no!
We gotta go!

1131
00:59:19,052 --> 00:59:22,623
I fixed the plane and we ain't
going out without a fight!

1132
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,791
Let's see them stop
a flying missile!

1133
00:59:24,858 --> 00:59:26,193
No, Chris, stop!

1134
00:59:29,463 --> 00:59:30,831
Shit!

1135
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:41,142
[explosion]

1136
01:00:11,938 --> 01:00:13,406
Sure you're all right?

1137
01:00:13,474 --> 01:00:15,009
Yeah. You know I can't
just lay there.

1138
01:00:15,074 --> 01:00:16,409
I'll drive me insane.

1139
01:00:16,476 --> 01:00:18,712
Well, just watch the leg then.

1140
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:24,585
I don't know what the hell
those things did,

1141
01:00:24,652 --> 01:00:28,155
but the wiring around
the house is totally fried.

1142
01:00:30,791 --> 01:00:32,493
Even with the generator,
it's gonna take days

1143
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:33,994
before I can get this
place back up and running

1144
01:00:34,061 --> 01:00:35,430
without an electrician.

1145
01:00:35,496 --> 01:00:38,699
Well, I'm sure Uncle Henry
could fix it.

1146
01:00:38,766 --> 01:00:41,735
Yeah. I could do it too if I had
all the time in the world.

1147
01:00:41,802 --> 01:00:44,838
So, what?
Your schedule's packed now?

1148
01:00:44,905 --> 01:00:45,839
Totally packed.

1149
01:00:45,905 --> 01:00:49,543
[grunts]

1150
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:53,080
Hey, take it easy, will you?

1151
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:54,916
I don't want you
to hurt yourself again.

1152
01:00:54,983 --> 01:00:56,550
I mean, I know you're bored

1153
01:00:56,617 --> 01:00:58,586
and you want to help out,
but you don't have to rush.

1154
01:00:59,853 --> 01:01:01,855
Do you think Allison's
gonna be okay?

1155
01:01:01,922 --> 01:01:04,257
I hope so, Junie.

1156
01:01:04,324 --> 01:01:07,960
We'll just have to wait
'til she gets back.

1157
01:01:08,027 --> 01:01:09,663
She'll make it back.

1158
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:21,474
Oh, my God!

1159
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:23,244
It's an arm from one
of the machines!

1160
01:01:23,311 --> 01:01:25,180
Get down! Get on the floor.

1161
01:01:27,981 --> 01:01:29,416
[glass breaks]

1162
01:01:33,922 --> 01:01:36,657
[screams]

1163
01:01:44,065 --> 01:01:45,465
Junie, did it hurt you?

1164
01:01:45,532 --> 01:01:47,768
No. I'm fine.
It didn't hurt me.

1165
01:01:47,835 --> 01:01:49,070
Are you okay?

1166
01:01:49,137 --> 01:01:50,705
Yeah, I am.

1167
01:01:57,744 --> 01:01:59,880
It sounded like something
was calling to it.

1168
01:02:01,148 --> 01:02:03,983
Either way, Dad,
you saved my life.

1169
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,987
That was incredible.

1170
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:14,796
Just get some rest.

1171
01:02:45,793 --> 01:02:48,730
[blaring]

1172
01:03:05,246 --> 01:03:07,014
The smoke's cleared.

1173
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:10,251
Now, the observatory's
a mile down the main road.

1174
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:12,119
I'm sorry.
We can't go with you, Henry.

1175
01:03:12,186 --> 01:03:15,454
Even if there might
still be danger in Manhattan,

1176
01:03:15,521 --> 01:03:16,757
we have to go there.

1177
01:03:18,057 --> 01:03:18,992
Thanks for helping me.

1178
01:03:19,059 --> 01:03:20,795
Thank you for helping us.

1179
01:03:22,061 --> 01:03:23,463
Be safe.

1180
01:03:35,342 --> 01:03:36,577
[groans]

1181
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:13,714
[clattering]

1182
01:04:17,918 --> 01:04:19,820
[grunts]

1183
01:04:31,331 --> 01:04:32,567
Ah!

1184
01:04:41,007 --> 01:04:42,710
Ah!

1185
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,115
Allie?

1186
01:04:51,918 --> 01:04:53,121
Are you in here?

1187
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:01,227
Allie, this is Henry.

1188
01:05:01,295 --> 01:05:02,797
Come in.

1189
01:05:05,632 --> 01:05:09,503
Allie, this is Henry!
Come in!

1190
01:05:19,045 --> 01:05:23,016
[jets flying]

1191
01:05:27,788 --> 01:05:30,858
Stay where you are,
wherever you are.

1192
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:40,401
Please, just give me something,
give me something!

1193
01:05:40,467 --> 01:05:42,068
I need to know you're there!

1194
01:05:48,108 --> 01:05:49,577
Allie...

1195
01:05:51,378 --> 01:05:52,846
I'm going
to the engine room.

1196
01:05:54,648 --> 01:05:56,083
I'm gonna check the lighting.

1197
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,608
Ha!

1198
01:06:21,675 --> 01:06:23,211
[glass breaks, clatter]

1199
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:30,517
- Allie!
- Henry!

1200
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:32,886
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so glad you made it.

1201
01:06:34,856 --> 01:06:37,024
Where are Junie and Mark?
Are they okay?

1202
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,125
God, I hope so.

1203
01:06:38,192 --> 01:06:39,693
I had to leave them
at the farmhouse.

1204
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,128
I haven't been able
to check on them.

1205
01:06:41,193 --> 01:06:42,728
But, Henry, I saw one.

1206
01:06:42,795 --> 01:06:44,163
I saw one of the Martians.

1207
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:45,599
Outside the machine?

1208
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:49,536
No, face-to-face,
just outside their cockpit.

1209
01:06:49,603 --> 01:06:51,105
Wait. Have you seen
the red weeds?

1210
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:53,373
Yeah. One of them tried
to choke me out

1211
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,074
in the middle of the woods.

1212
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:57,510
They tried to kill us
on the south bridge.

1213
01:06:57,577 --> 01:06:59,346
Who's us?

1214
01:06:59,413 --> 01:07:02,449
Well, I spent the day yesterday
traveling with two girls.

1215
01:07:02,516 --> 01:07:05,920
We traveled together, then
I spent the night in a cabin.

1216
01:07:05,987 --> 01:07:07,121
Where did you guys hide out?

1217
01:07:07,188 --> 01:07:08,588
Long story.

1218
01:07:08,655 --> 01:07:10,190
But you know what
the Martians are doing, right?

1219
01:07:10,257 --> 01:07:12,659
Yes. They're trying to change
earth into a new Mars.

1220
01:07:12,726 --> 01:07:14,827
They're trying to destroy
all the nitrogen

1221
01:07:14,894 --> 01:07:18,632
in the atmosphere by planting
nitrogen-gobbling crops.

1222
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:20,233
Once they're down to
nothing but oxygen,

1223
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,567
they'll ignite the atmosphere

1224
01:07:21,635 --> 01:07:23,436
and that's going
to vaporize the ocean.

1225
01:07:23,503 --> 01:07:25,072
That reduces earth's mass!

1226
01:07:25,139 --> 01:07:28,175
Yeah, and that, in addition to
breaking up our ozone layer,

1227
01:07:28,242 --> 01:07:30,945
ought to make our planet
pretty much like home to them.

1228
01:07:31,012 --> 01:07:32,580
Okay.

1229
01:07:32,646 --> 01:07:34,181
So I took this
specimen about an hour ago

1230
01:07:34,248 --> 01:07:35,749
and it's jet black, right?

1231
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:38,551
If my theory is correct,
when it's exposed to bacteria,

1232
01:07:38,617 --> 01:07:40,453
it'll turn white and die.

1233
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:41,956
I saw it happen to this Martian

1234
01:07:42,021 --> 01:07:43,824
that consumed a man
with a badly infected arm.

1235
01:07:43,891 --> 01:07:45,226
Eww.

1236
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:46,592
Yeah, it just turned bone white
and died within minutes.

1237
01:07:46,659 --> 01:07:48,194
- [ping]
- Is that an alert?

1238
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:51,798
I opened the message board,
it's from 12 hours ago.

1239
01:07:51,865 --> 01:07:54,134
Here, hold on.
The whole system is scrambled.

1240
01:07:54,201 --> 01:07:55,670
I have to let it run
before I can restart it.

1241
01:07:55,735 --> 01:07:57,203
All right.

1242
01:07:57,271 --> 01:07:59,907
So Mars has half the oxygen
content than earth does.

1243
01:07:59,972 --> 01:08:02,509
So its species have
to over-produce hemoglobin

1244
01:08:02,576 --> 01:08:04,378
to take in as much oxygen
as possible.

1245
01:08:04,445 --> 01:08:07,981
So like our blood, the iron is
critical for oxygen absorption.

1246
01:08:08,047 --> 01:08:09,816
So they create twice
as much of it.

1247
01:08:09,882 --> 01:08:11,684
Now you were able to run
a scan on their skin

1248
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:13,621
before the first attack,
remember?

1249
01:08:13,688 --> 01:08:14,988
Yeah.

1250
01:08:15,054 --> 01:08:16,556
It was calcium, carbon,
protein and iron.

1251
01:08:16,623 --> 01:08:18,824
Now I suspect when
these creatures die,

1252
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,827
their vascular system seizes,

1253
01:08:20,894 --> 01:08:23,764
and then drains all
the iron from its body.

1254
01:08:23,829 --> 01:08:26,000
Sort of like how our
lymphatic system pushes fluid.

1255
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:27,667
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

1256
01:08:27,734 --> 01:08:29,870
So all we have to do
is isolate what bacteria

1257
01:08:29,936 --> 01:08:31,572
the Martians are susceptible to.

1258
01:08:31,637 --> 01:08:32,872
When the iron drains,

1259
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:33,806
it's just gonna
leave the calcium,

1260
01:08:33,873 --> 01:08:35,507
turning them bone white.

1261
01:08:35,574 --> 01:08:36,710
Just like when they retreated
back into the ship, right?

1262
01:08:36,777 --> 01:08:38,444
That's right.

1263
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:40,947
So we can ID them one by one
with the library's ID function

1264
01:08:41,014 --> 01:08:43,083
until we identify
which bacterium

1265
01:08:43,149 --> 01:08:48,121
is acidic enough to
kill the living skin tissue.

1266
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:49,556
[ping]

1267
01:08:49,622 --> 01:08:51,023
All right, Yeah, how do we
know that's even gonna work?

1268
01:08:51,091 --> 01:08:52,659
Because their
vascular structure

1269
01:08:52,725 --> 01:08:55,261
is a closed system
just like ours.

1270
01:08:55,328 --> 01:08:58,599
They need twice the iron to
deliver oxygen on Mars, right?

1271
01:08:58,666 --> 01:08:59,967
Okay.

1272
01:09:00,033 --> 01:09:01,634
So that's twice
the red blood cells.

1273
01:09:01,702 --> 01:09:03,804
That'll only leave half
the room for white blood cells.

1274
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:06,039
Henry, they have
no immune system.

1275
01:09:19,353 --> 01:09:22,322
Okay, so I've separated
a single bacterium.

1276
01:09:22,389 --> 01:09:25,792
You run the program and
tell me how it identifies it.

1277
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:27,494
Okay, got it.

1278
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:29,828
The program says...
Clostridium perfrigens.

1279
01:09:29,895 --> 01:09:31,698
Common name is gangrene.

1280
01:09:31,765 --> 01:09:33,500
That's perfect.

1281
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:37,471
The alien I took the sample off
of died seconds later.

1282
01:09:37,537 --> 01:09:40,307
So it's must have only had
trace amounts of gangrene.

1283
01:09:41,442 --> 01:09:44,110
- Okay, that's not it.
- That's not it.

1284
01:09:44,177 --> 01:09:45,445
Let's try again.

1285
01:09:45,511 --> 01:09:47,014
All right, let me get
another sample up here.

1286
01:09:47,881 --> 01:09:51,050
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

1287
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:53,154
Okay, this one
is Pleomorphic bacteria.

1288
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:54,954
That's just common
blood-borne bacterium.

1289
01:09:55,021 --> 01:09:58,257
All right, here goes nothing...

1290
01:09:58,324 --> 01:09:59,326
and it did nothing.

1291
01:09:59,393 --> 01:10:01,095
There's got to be at
least 12 strains

1292
01:10:01,162 --> 01:10:02,695
of bacteria on this sample.

1293
01:10:02,761 --> 01:10:04,363
- [explosion]
- Oh, Jesus.

1294
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,765
They're getting closer.

1295
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:07,367
Can we do three or
four of these at a time?

1296
01:10:07,434 --> 01:10:08,668
No, unfortunately not.

1297
01:10:08,734 --> 01:10:11,037
That would compromise
the results.

1298
01:10:11,104 --> 01:10:12,805
Okay, go!

1299
01:10:12,872 --> 01:10:14,673
Okay, That is...
streptococcus.

1300
01:10:14,740 --> 01:10:16,277
That's the common strep.

1301
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:17,478
All right.

1302
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:23,149
That's it!
That's it.

1303
01:10:23,216 --> 01:10:26,486
Well, okay, no,
that's just the first sample.

1304
01:10:26,552 --> 01:10:28,756
That's just the control.

1305
01:10:28,823 --> 01:10:30,324
Now I've gotta reproduce
the experiment.

1306
01:10:33,493 --> 01:10:34,929
And...

1307
01:10:36,896 --> 01:10:39,032
- That's it! Right there!
- There it is.

1308
01:10:39,099 --> 01:10:40,900
- It's the strep.
- Oh, God!

1309
01:10:40,967 --> 01:10:42,935
- [explosion]
- Jesus.

1310
01:10:43,002 --> 01:10:44,971
<i>This is U2 Spirit, over.</i>

1311
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:46,906
<i>Is anyone else still flying?</i>

1312
01:10:46,972 --> 01:10:49,109
<i>Copy, Spirit.
This is Rex, over.</i>

1313
01:10:52,445 --> 01:10:55,349
<i>Copy, Rex, I have
visual on the Tripods.</i>

1314
01:10:55,414 --> 01:10:56,850
<i>Payload is primed.</i>

1315
01:10:56,917 --> 01:10:59,520
<i>This close to the city?
Are you sure?</i>

1316
01:11:00,921 --> 01:11:03,390
<i>Rex!</i>

1317
01:11:03,457 --> 01:11:06,994
<i>That's it! Weapons hot!
Let's smoke these bastards!</i>

1318
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:18,539
[explosion]

1319
01:11:33,587 --> 01:11:34,822
[ping]

1320
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:36,890
What we got?

1321
01:11:36,957 --> 01:11:38,191
Okay. Well, that's
from the last EMT.

1322
01:11:38,257 --> 01:11:39,559
I mean, it glitched
the whole system.

1323
01:11:39,626 --> 01:11:40,894
It's still formatting.

1324
01:11:40,961 --> 01:11:42,628
- What's it say?
- It's four columns.

1325
01:11:42,695 --> 01:11:45,532
The first one is 400, 400.

1326
01:11:45,599 --> 01:11:46,600
That's just over and over again.

1327
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:49,601
And KJ, KJ, repeat KJ.

1328
01:11:49,668 --> 01:11:51,238
Okay, that's kilojoules.

1329
01:11:51,305 --> 01:11:52,405
Boom.

1330
01:11:52,472 --> 01:11:53,405
[explosion]

1331
01:11:53,472 --> 01:11:54,774
Oof.

1332
01:11:54,841 --> 01:11:56,076
Okay, that's definitely
a fire fight.

1333
01:11:56,143 --> 01:11:57,543
They're definitely
getting closer.

1334
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,211
Would imagine there are
troops on the ground

1335
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:00,514
that are probably just
trying to hold their position.

1336
01:12:00,581 --> 01:12:02,449
What's the third column say?

1337
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:06,286
181818 and then khz, khz.

1338
01:12:06,353 --> 01:12:07,386
That's kilohertz.

1339
01:12:07,453 --> 01:12:09,288
So they're talking about
the heat ray?

1340
01:12:09,355 --> 01:12:11,724
No. This is five times the
strength of an electrical bolt.

1341
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:13,360
Electricity doesn't
cycle that fast.

1342
01:12:13,426 --> 01:12:14,627
This is light-based.

1343
01:12:14,694 --> 01:12:16,764
Okay, so what were they
saying about kilojoules?

1344
01:12:16,829 --> 01:12:18,532
Well, the 400 is 400.

1345
01:12:18,599 --> 01:12:21,368
The 18 is five times the
frequency of a light ray.

1346
01:12:21,435 --> 01:12:24,003
If they're not
talking about a heat ray,

1347
01:12:24,069 --> 01:12:25,905
they're talking about a laser.

1348
01:12:27,307 --> 01:12:29,208
Okay, okay, and the last column?

1349
01:12:29,275 --> 01:12:33,145
Just "Reed" over and over again,
every 15 minutes for hours.

1350
01:12:33,212 --> 01:12:34,814
The fact that there's
a frequency

1351
01:12:34,881 --> 01:12:37,016
that's corresponding to
a high-powered laser tells me

1352
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:39,752
this is a weapon
we can use against the aliens.

1353
01:12:39,819 --> 01:12:41,988
So if we max out our laser,

1354
01:12:42,055 --> 01:12:43,624
we could penetrate
their energy shields.

1355
01:12:43,689 --> 01:12:46,025
I mean, theoretically.

1356
01:12:46,092 --> 01:12:47,426
I mean it could.

1357
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:49,762
It could, it could, it could.
It could!

1358
01:12:49,829 --> 01:12:52,099
Ours is designed
for guidance, though.

1359
01:12:52,164 --> 01:12:53,600
I mean, it's not
meant as a weapon.

1360
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:56,302
We could maybe get one,
maybe two, shots off.

1361
01:12:56,369 --> 01:12:58,070
Then the whole thing's
just gonna melt down

1362
01:12:58,137 --> 01:12:59,773
- and we'll be sitting ducks.
- Right, right, right.

1363
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,307
Okay, if you could fire on
one of them and breach its hull,

1364
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:05,845
I could use their smoke delivery
system and fire on the rest.

1365
01:13:05,912 --> 01:13:07,814
You mean climb
inside the machine?

1366
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:09,182
Yeah.

1367
01:13:09,248 --> 01:13:10,550
When I took the sample
from the alien,

1368
01:13:10,617 --> 01:13:12,286
I saw the smoke container
in its cockpit.

1369
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:14,988
I could use the reagents
to make a lethal dose.

1370
01:13:15,055 --> 01:13:19,059
I think 500 parts per
milliliter should do it.

1371
01:13:19,126 --> 01:13:21,695
Yeah, I could spray it into
the smoke delivery system

1372
01:13:21,761 --> 01:13:24,163
in the Tripod and then fire
on the rest of them.

1373
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,465
Oh, God!

1374
01:13:25,532 --> 01:13:28,001
We may deploy their smoke,
that will kill you.

1375
01:13:28,068 --> 01:13:29,403
No. We have all this
lab equipment.

1376
01:13:29,469 --> 01:13:32,005
We got chemical
protective masks.

1377
01:13:32,072 --> 01:13:34,140
We have the sprayer
we spray on meteorites.

1378
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,943
- We could protect ourselves.
- Okay.

1379
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,511
Here.

1380
01:13:40,247 --> 01:13:41,682
Fill this up to the top.

1381
01:13:41,747 --> 01:13:44,817
By the time they get here,
we will generate enough.

1382
01:13:44,885 --> 01:13:46,320
Okay.

1383
01:13:46,386 --> 01:13:47,653
And working.

1384
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:51,791
I wish we could do something
to lure them right here.

1385
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:53,560
Use the PA system.

1386
01:13:53,627 --> 01:13:57,130
You get the mic close enough
to the receiver, it feeds back.

1387
01:13:57,197 --> 01:13:58,332
You think that's gonna work?

1388
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:00,367
It's not gonna sound human.

1389
01:14:02,202 --> 01:14:04,570
That's strep,
be careful of it.

1390
01:14:15,782 --> 01:14:17,318
Let's give it a shot.

1391
01:14:53,252 --> 01:14:55,655
All right, let's see if
they take the bait.

1392
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:58,225

1393
01:15:04,064 --> 01:15:06,400
[howling]

1394
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,369
<i>It's on its way.</i>

1395
01:15:27,787 --> 01:15:32,292
Allie, the power to
the laser is on maximum.

1396
01:15:32,359 --> 01:15:34,528
Power resources say
it's gonna hold.

1397
01:15:34,594 --> 01:15:36,563
<i>I can see it!
It's just over the tree line!</i>

1398
01:15:36,628 --> 01:15:38,097
<i>I'm driving the solution,
heading outside!</i>

1399
01:15:38,164 --> 01:15:39,431
Shit!

1400
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:41,167
Allie, don't go!
It's not holding!

1401
01:15:41,234 --> 01:15:44,337
The circuit didn't hold!
Don't go! Hold still!

1402
01:15:45,404 --> 01:15:47,039
Henry, we don't have much time!

1403
01:15:47,106 --> 01:15:51,244
They're gonna be within range to
fire their heat rays any second!

1404
01:15:58,784 --> 01:16:01,054
Okay...

1405
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:03,390
[grunts]

1406
01:16:26,845 --> 01:16:30,316
Okay, I rerouted all
the power from everything

1407
01:16:30,382 --> 01:16:32,552
that is not the laser.

1408
01:16:32,618 --> 01:16:34,487
I mean, there's no telling
how many times

1409
01:16:34,555 --> 01:16:37,257
I can fire this thing
before it just blows up.

1410
01:16:37,323 --> 01:16:39,791
<i>Just do it.
It's all we got.</i>

1411
01:16:39,859 --> 01:16:41,562
What's their trajectory?

1412
01:16:41,627 --> 01:16:44,965
<i>Aim the laser directly east.
You'll see it any second.</i>

1413
01:16:45,032 --> 01:16:47,234
[blaring]

1414
01:16:48,001 --> 01:16:50,471
Henry, it's here.

1415
01:16:55,507 --> 01:16:56,609
God.

1416
01:17:10,224 --> 01:17:11,891
I got it.

1417
01:17:11,957 --> 01:17:13,559
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1418
01:17:21,167 --> 01:17:22,736
Yes!

1419
01:17:52,865 --> 01:17:54,701
[screeching]

1420
01:18:00,439 --> 01:18:03,676
Allie, are you there?
I just wanna hear from you.

01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:05,811
[blaring]

1422
01:18:15,454 --> 01:18:16,957
Ready to fire.

1423
01:18:29,336 --> 01:18:30,771
Henry!

1424
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:54,894
Aah!

1425
01:18:54,961 --> 01:18:56,997
[grunts]

1426
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:01,301
Oh!

1427
01:19:06,072 --> 01:19:07,807
Ah!

1428
01:19:15,314 --> 01:19:17,317

1431
01:19:53,819 --> 01:19:55,188
No!

1432
01:19:55,253 --> 01:19:57,122
Over here!

1433
01:19:57,189 --> 01:19:58,724
Come on, over here!

1434
01:19:59,525 --> 01:20:01,360
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1435
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:10,971
General Reed!
General Reed!

1436
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:12,105
Over here!

1437
01:20:12,171 --> 01:20:14,473
Their shields are down!

1438
01:20:16,176 --> 01:20:17,110
[gunfire]

1439
01:20:17,176 --> 01:20:18,478
Here!

1440
01:20:18,545 --> 01:20:19,779
No! Over here!

1441
01:20:20,947 --> 01:20:22,916
[howling]

1442
01:20:26,051 --> 01:20:28,054
We saw the laser firing on the
ridge all the way from the base!

1443
01:20:28,121 --> 01:20:29,555
We knew you were trying
to take them out!

1444
01:20:29,622 --> 01:20:31,358
- Keep circling!
- Over here!

1445
01:20:33,693 --> 01:20:37,497
Over here!
Over here!

1446
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:40,067
Guys, look at me!

1447
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:47,373

1450
01:21:46,032 --> 01:21:47,400
Come on.

1451
01:21:49,735 --> 01:21:51,771
Ugh! Oh!

1452
01:21:59,511 --> 01:22:01,014
[beeps]

1453
01:22:25,305 --> 01:22:27,039
Allie!

1454
01:22:39,286 --> 01:22:40,520
Allie!

1455
01:22:41,319 --> 01:22:42,922
Come here.

1456
01:22:44,823 --> 01:22:46,525
I knew you could do it.

1457
01:22:46,591 --> 01:22:49,595
Come here.
Come here, sit down.

1458
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:55,268
I told you, you're
the only brother I got.

1459
01:22:55,335 --> 01:22:58,371
We did it!
I knew we would!

1460
01:22:58,438 --> 01:23:01,507
You're pretty smart.
Runs in the family, I think.

1461
01:23:01,573 --> 01:23:02,942
Shut up, Henry.

1462
01:23:39,345 --> 01:23:41,481
You made it.
Thank God.

1463
01:23:41,547 --> 01:23:43,282
Wait, Junie!

1464
01:23:43,349 --> 01:23:44,382
Is Junie okay?

1465
01:23:44,449 --> 01:23:46,152
- Mom!
- Baby.

1466
01:23:46,217 --> 01:23:48,622
I was afraid you
weren't gonna make it back!

1467
01:23:51,457 --> 01:23:52,859
How's your leg?

1468
01:23:52,926 --> 01:23:55,795
It's better.
Everything feels better.

1469
01:23:55,862 --> 01:23:58,998
I agree, everything
feels better.

1470
01:23:59,064 --> 01:24:01,067
Hey.
How are you doing?

1471
01:24:01,132 --> 01:24:03,235
Oh my God.
