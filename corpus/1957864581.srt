1
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,953
<i>Which floor?</i>

2
00:00:29,455 --> 00:00:31,218
<i>Third... fifth floor.</i>

3
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,621
<i>- Let's go.</i>
<i>- This place sucks.</i>

4
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,127
<i>- Here's Number 13.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

5
00:00:40,232 --> 00:00:41,995
<i>- Two more floors to go.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

6
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,208
<i>- I can't catch my breath.</i>
<i>- Shit. You should quit smoking.</i>

7
00:00:57,116 --> 00:00:59,209
<i>Fourteen, 15.</i>

8
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:01,252
<i>- Over there.</i>
<i>- Is it the one we just passed?</i>

9
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:06,624
Ming Ding

10
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:10,454
- Ming Ding, wake up.
- Someone's there.

11
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,797
Ming Ding.

12
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:20,294
- Damn. Everyone's still in bed.
- Who are you looking for?

13
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:21,896
Ming Ding.

14
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:24,308
Is Ming Ding here?

15
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,968
What do you want?

16
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:27,773
- What do you want?
- Out of the way.

17
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:31,539
- Check that room.
- What are you doing?

18
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,777
We're looking for Ming Ding.
None of your business.

19
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:40,659
- Is that Ming Ding?
- No.

20
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,031
- Ming Ding
- What are you doing?

21
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:58,302
He's outside.

22
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:01,212
- There.
- There he is.

23
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:03,110
- Bring him out.
- Get up.

24
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:12,182
Go to your room.
This is none of your business.

25
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,883
Sit down.

26
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:19,789
Ming Ding, do you know why we're here?

27
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,535
You know why we're here today?

28
00:02:34,713 --> 00:02:37,147
Do you know that Mr. Jiang
wants to double your debt?

29
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:38,876
I don't know what you're talking about.

30
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:41,318
You don't know?

31
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,251
You need an explanation?

32
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,089
Okay, wait.

33
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,125
I had to send some money
home to China.

34
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,595
I've been here six months
and haven't sent a dime back to my wife.

35
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:01,533
The whole reason I came here
was to make money.

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,168
The interest Mr. Jiang charges
makes it impossible to save anything.

37
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:07,745
That's your problem.

38
00:03:07,846 --> 00:03:09,814
When you borrow money,
you have to pay it back.

39
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:12,611
The interest and due date were set.

40
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:15,313
Mr. Jiang isn't running a charity.

41
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:19,119
- I just couldn't make my last two payments.
- Stop acting.

42
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:22,851
Where's the money?

43
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:26,120
- In the refrigerator.
- The refrigerator?

44
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,823
Are you trying to keep it fresh?

45
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:32,097
There's no money.

46
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:33,865
No, the other one.

47
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,595
Got it.

48
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:09,272
- How much is there?
- About a grand.

49
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,103
Where is the rest?

50
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,440
I told you I don't have it right now.

51
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,841
Don't act.

52
00:04:15,948 --> 00:04:17,939
This is the deal.

53
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,213
You give us $800 tonight

54
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:25,115
or your debt is doubled.

55
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:32,931
$800 by tonight, then we'll
talk about a new payment plan.

56
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:45,004
A little lesson
so you'll never forget your payment.

57
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,546
- Don't hit me.
- You won't forget to pay again.

58
00:04:48,647 --> 00:04:51,115
- Don't move.
- Don't hit me. Please.

59
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,585
$800 tonight.

60
00:04:58,056 --> 00:04:59,523
Let's go.

61
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:02,182
See you tonight.

62
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:28,134
Keep it down.

63
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:32,743
We only have $500.
Cheng asks you to be careful.

64
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,981
- You're welcome.
- Oh, thank you.

65
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:11,563
Damn. You trying to kill me?

66
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:14,769
What's wrong?
A little edgy this morning?

67
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,340
Nothing.

68
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,387
Rough night?

69
00:10:39,197 --> 00:10:40,164
Me too.

70
00:10:41,132 --> 00:10:42,724
On the phone with my wife last night.

71
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,237
Thousands of miles away,

72
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:50,001
on the other side of the earth,
and we still find a way to fight.

73
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,101
That stinking bitch said...

74
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:55,408
she said...

75
00:10:56,414 --> 00:11:00,373
that I'm not focused.

76
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:06,313
That stinking bitch.
Always yapping. So annoying.

77
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:09,693
Is your wife the same?

78
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:19,570
Oh, by the way.

79
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:38,013
I just found a new phone card.

80
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,020
250 minutes for two dollars. Here.

81
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:48,191
It's the Asia Universal card.

82
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:53,398
She's pretty cute, huh? Look.

83
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,803
Are you all right?

84
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,113
You know, calling cards
are a booming business.

85
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:09,311
I heard about one guy who sells
20,000 of these things a day.

86
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:12,253
20,000 cards a day.

87
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,450
Rich overnight.

88
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:18,055
I have to look into this.

89
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,425
Make a killing.

90
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,164
Let me ask you.

91
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:29,900
How's your payment going?

92
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:35,939
I'm almost done with it.

93
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,481
Four to five months. Then I'm done.

94
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,647
How long did it take you?

95
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:43,243
Around four years,

96
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:45,414
because I spent extra money

97
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:46,990
on the trip to Europe.

98
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:49,083
Then from England to here.

99
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,758
Why do you ask?

100
00:12:54,366 --> 00:12:56,163
No reason. Just curious.

101
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:00,601
Your payments going all right?

102
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:02,963
All right.

103
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:34,029
Looks like it will rain all day.

104
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:41,576
You two are earlier than me today.

105
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:44,181
- Time to work.
- Yep, time to work.

106
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:48,344
Ma, defrost the shrimp
and don't forget to cut the broccoli.

107
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:54,643
The keys.

108
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:18,971
- Good morning.
- Morning.

109
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:23,310
- Big Sister, good morning.
- Good morning.

110
00:15:35,093 --> 00:15:37,994
Big Sister, don't forget
to order pork tonight.

111
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,929
Ma, get the flour.

112
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:23,874
Young, get the MSG.

113
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:50,864
Slowly...

114
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:56,600
Slow down.

115
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:59,469
What's wrong?

116
00:17:00,678 --> 00:17:01,645
Nothing.

117
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:04,271
- Can't get it up? Impotent?
- Fuck you.

118
00:17:12,023 --> 00:17:13,581
Wait.

119
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,683
What's wrong with you?

120
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,160
Can you lend me some money?

121
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:22,529
How much?

122
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,101
$300.

123
00:17:24,969 --> 00:17:27,028
Why do you need to borrow money?

124
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:32,702
It's an emergency.
Just lend me some money.

125
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:37,010
I just sent money home this morning.

126
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:40,277
I only have $150 left.

127
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:43,577
Tell me why you need money.

128
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,787
- Will you lend it to me or not?
- I didn't say I wouldn't.

129
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,258
- Why do you need the money?
- Why so many questions?

130
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:54,325
I owe money to a loan shark.

131
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,360
Why do you owe them money?

132
00:17:57,468 --> 00:17:59,333
Why do you owe them money?

133
00:17:59,437 --> 00:18:01,667
- Are you gambling?
- No.

134
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:03,240
I'll tell you another time.

135
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:04,808
Let's go.

136
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:08,870
Will you lend me the money or not?

137
00:18:18,156 --> 00:18:20,181
What are you going to do
for the other $150?

138
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:25,454
Do you want to borrow
from Big Sister, Ma or Wei?

139
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,764
Don't tell them.

140
00:18:27,865 --> 00:18:29,332
Why not?

141
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:30,901
I just don't want them to know.

142
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:33,766
Go. Just go.

143
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:48,308
I got it.

144
00:19:20,017 --> 00:19:22,713
Big Sister,
when is your daughter coming to visit?

145
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,481
Not for a while.

146
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,417
- When is your wife coming over?
- I'm not married.

147
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:30,426
Today you're not married, right?

148
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,168
Small house special Lo-Mein.

149
00:19:47,278 --> 00:19:48,768
Make it spicy.

150
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,044
So how did you get yourself into this?

151
00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:57,247
I borrowed money from those guys.

152
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:58,822
Why?

153
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:02,688
I wanted to pay back my family in full.

154
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:04,785
What's your problem?

155
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,330
Because they already had
my brother's debt to deal with.

156
00:20:09,433 --> 00:20:11,094
It's tough on them.

157
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:15,505
What's the interest?

158
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:18,233
Thirty percent.

159
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,903
Thirty percent? Are you crazy?
Why didn't you do the math?

160
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,481
I thought I did.

161
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:29,015
I don't know what you're doing.

162
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:36,258
Families are expected
to borrow money for the debt.

163
00:20:36,794 --> 00:20:38,261
You're not expected
to pay it back right away.

164
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,728
You have to figure out a way
or you'll be in debt forever.

165
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,732
I know.

166
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,338
So, what are you going to do?

167
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:02,982
The most tips
I've ever made in a day is $90.

168
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,746
Take my deliveries today.

169
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:08,223
- What?
- Make all the deliveries today.

170
00:21:10,695 --> 00:21:13,027
- No, I feel bad.
- It's all right.

171
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,098
Do all the deliveries.

172
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:18,101
Really?

173
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:19,829
Really.

174
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,475
I'm fine.

175
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:30,343
Plus, I don't want to work in this weather.

176
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,041
It's good that it's raining.

177
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:37,643
More rain, more deliveries.

178
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:40,851
The more rain, the better.

179
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:44,618
- More deliveries, more money.
- Delivery.

180
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,608
What are you doing there?

181
00:24:56,153 --> 00:24:57,745
You're taking up space.

182
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:48,538
Two Mexican squid with extra shrimp.

183
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:05,978
Did you know that-

184
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,557
Big Sister.

185
00:26:07,658 --> 00:26:10,593
Eating too many carrots will turn
the whites of your eyes orange?

186
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,162
Right, eat more.

187
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,726
Why are you here all day?

188
00:26:18,469 --> 00:26:20,232
Don't you have deliveries to make?

189
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:21,964
Ming is doing them.

190
00:26:22,072 --> 00:26:23,664
Why is Ming doing all of them?

191
00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:26,334
He needs the exercise to lose weight.

192
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,869
- I think you're the one who needs exercise.
- Fuck you.

193
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,447
Look at your stomach.

194
00:29:55,786 --> 00:29:58,016
So, did Lin-Xing call you again?

195
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:00,215
Yeah, last night.

196
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,558
Is he here?

197
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:04,524
No, he's still in China.

198
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:07,090
Has he gotten a green card yet?

199
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:09,757
No, he's still trying.

200
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:12,559
Getting the illegitimate marriage?

201
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,071
He doesn't have the money for that.

202
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:17,697
How much does that cost now?

203
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:19,605
$40,000.

204
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,200
$150,000?

205
00:30:21,311 --> 00:30:22,778
$40,000.

206
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,138
$40,000.

207
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:26,841
Isn't that expensive?

208
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,781
No, that's cheap.

209
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:31,280
Doesn't he have the money?

210
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:35,381
He has 120,000
to 130,000 yuan.

211
00:30:35,492 --> 00:30:40,191
But he spends a lot of money
on those name-brand clothes.

212
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,095
Just a pair of underwear
costs him around 600 yuan.

213
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,997
Hey, don't knock it.

214
00:30:45,102 --> 00:30:48,162
Underwear is the most important
article of clothing on a person.

215
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:50,400
It says the most about you.

216
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:53,772
Boxers, tighty whities or thongs.

217
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:57,036
Wei, are you wearing your thong today?

218
00:30:58,015 --> 00:30:59,744
Do your work.

219
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,216
Just kidding.

220
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,997
Seriously,
I've been saving for two months.

221
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:39,735
Two months.

222
00:33:41,612 --> 00:33:44,012
- Big wonton soup.
- Two months?

223
00:33:44,114 --> 00:33:46,241
It will take you forever.

224
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,817
No, not forever.

225
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:50,045
Maybe a couple more years.

226
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:53,112
How long did it take the boss
to get this place?

227
00:33:55,792 --> 00:33:57,453
Ten years.

228
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:59,461
Ten years? Pretty good.

229
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,166
Perfect. I've been working for four years.
Six more years and I'll be a boss too.

230
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:07,600
I won't forget you guys
when I'm the big boss.

231
00:34:07,704 --> 00:34:10,264
Wei, you'll be my restaurant manager.

232
00:34:10,374 --> 00:34:13,207
No, not manager. The chef.

233
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,868
We'll see.

234
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,012
Ma, you'll be my chef. Screw Wei.

235
00:34:19,116 --> 00:34:21,914
Sounds good to me.

236
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:28,117
- Delivery.
- Ask Ming.

237
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,182
Ming is out on a delivery.

238
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:34,923
Big Sister, you're coming with me, right?

239
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:36,624
Go, go, go.

240
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:41,397
Big Sister, you're going to be
my restaurant manager, right?

241
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,937
There are too many orders,
I have to help. But I will take it slow.

242
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,255
Why did you mess up my order?

243
00:36:06,356 --> 00:36:07,823
What are you talking about?

244
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:10,893
I have to make two trips
because you messed up the order.

245
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:13,258
Psycho, I don't know
what you're talking about.

246
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:15,854
The delivery I just made.
The guy didn't want chicken.

247
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,967
Ask Big Sister, I followed the order.

248
00:36:18,068 --> 00:36:19,535
I can't afford a mistake today.

249
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,469
What are you talking about?
I'll redo your order.

250
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:25,473
Are you deaf?
How did you mess up chicken and beef?

251
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:28,939
I don't think you're cut out for this.
Why don't you go back to China?

252
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:32,310
- You have a hearing problem?
- Watch your attitude.

253
00:36:32,415 --> 00:36:34,610
- Watch out, I'll smack you.
- Psycho.

254
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:38,779
If you don't want to work,
go back to China. New guy.

255
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:41,858
- What do you mean "new guy"?
- Don't fight.

256
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:47,725
He didn't do it on purpose.
Just a little mistake.

257
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:50,925
Stop fighting. Get out if you want to fight.
I can't hear a thing.

258
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:53,798
He can't afford a mistake today.
What the hell does that mean?

259
00:38:02,873 --> 00:38:08,140
Ming, why do you look sad?
What's on your mind?

260
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,601
Fuck.

261
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,110
Fuck.

262
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,472
How can you see it?

263
00:39:43,573 --> 00:39:46,007
Don't worry, I'll fix it for you.

264
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:47,576
Just wait over there.

265
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,280
Who broke it?

266
00:39:57,721 --> 00:40:00,246
It doesn't go down.

267
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:02,587
What the hell. Is it broken?

268
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:07,921
I'll fix it in no time.

269
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:09,965
Okay, okay.

270
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,825
Small fried rice, no vegetables.

271
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,493
Only one dollar?

272
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:44,960
Not even one dollar.

273
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,592
Sometimes just a few coins.

274
00:40:46,703 --> 00:40:50,104
It'll get better later.

275
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:52,674
To your next customer, say...

276
00:40:58,515 --> 00:41:00,574
What? I don't want to.

277
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:05,017
He'll give you a bigger tip.

278
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:11,156
You have to smile.

279
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:25,001
Your eyes have to smile.
Your eyes are not smiling.

280
00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:31,271
Damn, you're crazy.

281
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:35,215
You want to make money.
You have to try harder.

282
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:39,755
You have to smile.

283
00:41:39,856 --> 00:41:41,346
Didn't you hear?

284
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:44,689
How can I smile
when I'm in a bad mood?

285
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,620
Big Sister always says...

286
00:41:53,403 --> 00:41:55,871
You're nuts.

287
00:41:56,906 --> 00:41:58,498
So you have to smile.

288
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,177
No.

289
00:42:03,546 --> 00:42:05,537
I don't think that will help.

290
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,515
- Trust me.
- Okay.

291
00:42:08,618 --> 00:42:11,781
- That's how I do it.
- I'll try my best next time.

292
00:42:11,888 --> 00:42:13,856
You have to do it.

293
00:42:14,891 --> 00:42:16,586
You never listen to me.

294
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:23,389
Ming, delivery.

295
00:42:27,904 --> 00:42:29,963
Remember to smile...

296
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:33,733
Fine, I will.

297
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,019
I put it there.

298
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:34,697
Why?

299
00:44:35,398 --> 00:44:38,424
Because there wasn't any room.

300
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:40,236
Really?

301
00:44:40,336 --> 00:44:43,134
Really, there wasn't any space.

302
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:44,729
Why didn't you make room?

303
00:44:45,275 --> 00:44:47,470
I told you there was no room.

304
00:44:49,612 --> 00:44:51,477
Make room if there's no room.

305
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:54,277
What's the big deal?

306
00:44:54,384 --> 00:44:58,377
Guys, please. Every day.
I'm getting a headache here.

307
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,616
It's not a big deal.
He just likes to fight.

308
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,221
I like to fight with him.

309
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:08,161
If he didn't mess up my system,
I wouldn't care.

310
00:45:09,732 --> 00:45:11,029
Is it that hard?

311
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:14,228
Cooked food on the top.

312
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:16,630
Raw beef on the second shelf.

313
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:18,673
Raw chicken on the third shelf.

314
00:45:18,775 --> 00:45:21,300
Chopped vegetables on the bottom shelf.

315
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:25,379
I know.
You've told me many times.

316
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:27,847
But there was no space.

317
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,611
Is your brain in your ass?

318
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,186
Didn't you think of making room?

319
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:35,519
Yes, I thought of it. Then I thought
it would be more fun to piss you off.

320
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:42,227
My cousin should be arriving
in the States at the end of the month.

321
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:45,961
- Really?
- Is he going to do it Ma style?

322
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:51,333
"Don't send me back. Communism is so bad.
I can only have one kid."

323
00:45:55,278 --> 00:45:56,745
You don't understand.

324
00:45:56,846 --> 00:45:58,438
You guys got here before 9/11.

325
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:01,449
It's much harder after 9/11.

326
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:04,076
Ming, you got here after 9/11?

327
00:46:04,187 --> 00:46:05,154
Yeah.

328
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:07,884
He didn't get caught.

329
00:46:08,424 --> 00:46:09,391
Really?

330
00:46:10,927 --> 00:46:13,327
Must've had a good smuggler.

331
00:46:14,497 --> 00:46:17,330
Where did you come in?

332
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:20,334
- Canada.
- Really, Canada? Not bad.

333
00:46:20,436 --> 00:46:22,267
Ma wasn't that lucky.

334
00:46:22,372 --> 00:46:24,932
Ma's boat got nabbed
off the California coast.

335
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:26,065
Yeah.

336
00:46:26,175 --> 00:46:29,633
We all had to apply for political asylum.

337
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,641
So you got traveling papers?

338
00:46:32,749 --> 00:46:35,684
Yeah. While I wait for a hearing.

339
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:40,215
When is the court date?

340
00:46:40,323 --> 00:46:42,018
End of the month.

341
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:43,820
You're going to California?

342
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,992
No. Are you kidding me?

343
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:49,428
I'll wait for the next amnesty program
in a few years.

344
00:46:49,532 --> 00:46:52,160
No trip to any court.

345
00:46:52,702 --> 00:46:54,533
You'll wait forever.

346
00:46:55,872 --> 00:46:58,102
Small broccoli chicken.

347
00:47:04,514 --> 00:47:08,211
Broccoli chicken.

348
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:21,355
Yesterday a black guy
was here to sell a bike again.

349
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,557
- Which one?
- Which black guy?

350
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:26,100
Number 100. Who knows?

351
00:47:26,202 --> 00:47:29,603
There was a black guy here last week.
He was trying to sell me a bike.

352
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:35,744
The bike he tried to sell me
was the one stolen from me last time.

353
00:47:35,845 --> 00:47:37,642
- It was your bike?
- Yeah.

354
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:39,671
It's all your fault.

355
00:47:39,782 --> 00:47:40,908
Why?

356
00:47:42,084 --> 00:47:43,346
Why?

357
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,549
The blacks rip a bike off
from one restaurant

358
00:47:47,657 --> 00:47:49,352
and then sell it to another restaurant.

359
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:52,986
And because you buy them,
you create the demand.

360
00:47:53,095 --> 00:47:54,653
Of course it's your fault.

361
00:47:55,631 --> 00:47:59,533
So we should spend $100 on a new bike
every time we get ripped off?

362
00:49:14,977 --> 00:49:17,468
Wonton soup. Large, not small.

363
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,135
Boneless chicken and roast pork fried rice.

364
00:49:46,242 --> 00:49:48,802
Hurry up, I have other orders.

365
00:50:05,194 --> 00:50:07,219
No, I don't know.

366
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,628
Those are extra.

367
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,901
It's hot, open the door.

368
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:20,901
Young, still sleeping?
Take this delivery.

369
00:50:21,711 --> 00:50:24,805
Ming is out and I have too many orders.
Take some deliveries.

370
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:41,490
Fuck.

371
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:50,456
Don't you knock first?

372
00:52:21,097 --> 00:52:22,587
One fried rice.

373
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:46,444
Delivery.

374
00:54:32,027 --> 00:54:34,120
Ming, spread the menus.

375
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,697
I don't have time today.

376
00:54:35,798 --> 00:54:37,959
You still have to do it.

377
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:46,190
What's wrong with Ming today?

378
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:48,133
Stop fighting with him!

379
00:55:48,771 --> 00:55:50,432
I'm not fighting with him.

380
00:55:51,373 --> 00:55:53,637
You were the same as him
when you first got here.

381
00:55:54,176 --> 00:55:57,304
Knew nothing.
Only thinking about the money.

382
00:55:57,413 --> 00:55:59,074
Just trying to be nice.

383
00:56:09,925 --> 00:56:11,688
I can take your picture.

384
00:56:11,794 --> 00:56:13,989
When you call me,
your picture will appear.

385
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:18,289
- I don't know this brand.
- Your brand is shitty.

386
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,095
I can't read it.

387
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:22,397
My brand is better. Look. Picture.

388
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,439
What's going on with you?
Did you fall into a puddle?

389
00:56:26,775 --> 00:56:28,402
Look at him.

390
00:57:02,411 --> 00:57:05,107
Ming, delivery. Next door.

391
00:57:47,389 --> 00:57:49,755
One hour to go.
You'll be fine.

392
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:52,827
A boat straightens its course
when it gets to a bridge.

393
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,892
It stopped raining.

394
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:37,238
Two spring rolls.

395
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,164
Fuck you.

396
01:01:05,053 --> 01:01:09,786
That bitch at 845 West End.

397
01:01:53,402 --> 01:01:56,200
Bald bastard, I'll slap you.

398
01:02:42,284 --> 01:02:44,809
One case of chicken.
Three cases of chicken wings.

399
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,252
Two cases of broccoli.
Three pounds of bean sprouts.

400
01:02:47,356 --> 01:02:49,984
Three pounds of noodles.
One dozen scallions.

401
01:02:50,092 --> 01:02:51,559
One dozen packs of tofu.

402
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,127
One hundred pounds of pork.

403
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,036
Give me a cigarette.

404
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:10,507
Where is Ming?

405
01:03:11,046 --> 01:03:12,513
I don't know.

406
01:03:12,614 --> 01:03:15,742
You've been yapping and smoking all day.
Don't you have deliveries?

407
01:03:16,485 --> 01:03:20,182
There's something wrong with my bike.
I have to get a new one tomorrow.

408
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:22,654
Did he get himself into trouble?

409
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:28,425
He has a big bruise. I saw it.

410
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,191
Did he get into a fight?

411
01:03:30,732 --> 01:03:32,256
I don't know.

412
01:03:33,535 --> 01:03:35,002
How would I know?

413
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,594
You're so close to him.
Why wouldn't you know?

414
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:41,400
Since when do you care about Ming?

415
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:43,102
Small broccoli chicken.

416
01:03:43,979 --> 01:03:46,174
Is he in trouble?

417
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,112
It's none of your business.

418
01:03:48,216 --> 01:03:50,446
- Why do you have that attitude with me?
- Attitude?

419
01:03:50,552 --> 01:03:52,520
For three years,
I've had nothing but attitude from you.

420
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:54,418
Don't talk to me about attitude.

421
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,093
If Ming is in trouble...

422
01:04:03,198 --> 01:04:05,063
Hurry up, small broccoli chicken.

423
01:04:05,167 --> 01:04:07,658
Forget about it. There's no problem.

424
01:04:10,238 --> 01:04:11,796
Don't worry.

425
01:04:44,272 --> 01:04:46,672
Aren't you coming over to help?

426
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:18,228
Fried rice.

427
01:05:22,777 --> 01:05:24,608
10 A, Next door.

428
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:26,180
Number 250.

429
01:05:32,354 --> 01:05:35,482
Oh, this pack scared me.

430
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:49,820
Who took the hot sauce?

431
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,099
Not me.

432
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,361
What the hell,
blaming me for everything.

433
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,960
What's wrong with you?

434
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:42,074
I told you.

435
01:07:42,617 --> 01:07:44,949
Things always work out.

436
01:07:46,388 --> 01:07:50,324
This is called, "A boat straightens
its course when it gets to a bridge."

437
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:52,622
Do you agree with me?

438
01:07:52,727 --> 01:07:54,558
That's life.

439
01:07:54,663 --> 01:07:56,392
Philosophy.

440
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:21,082
Sometimes...

441
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:24,652
I wish I'd never come here.

442
01:08:26,027 --> 01:08:29,258
It would be great to be home
with my wife and my son.

443
01:08:32,634 --> 01:08:36,331
I got here before my son was born.

444
01:08:37,005 --> 01:08:39,337
He never saw his father.

445
01:08:46,147 --> 01:08:51,278
It will all pay off.

446
01:08:53,621 --> 01:08:55,248
I hope so.

447
01:09:14,676 --> 01:09:16,405
Don't think too much.

448
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:19,072
Four years isn't that long.

449
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:23,110
Look at me, I'm almost free of debt.

450
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,422
I can bring my wife and kids here soon.

451
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:33,354
You'll be okay, too.

452
01:09:34,262 --> 01:09:37,789
Time flies.

453
01:09:37,899 --> 01:09:39,594
Flies fast.

454
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:05,224
Ming, your money.

455
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:07,624
Young, your money.

456
01:10:35,323 --> 01:10:38,224
Young, only $15?

457
01:10:38,326 --> 01:10:39,793
That little?

458
01:10:39,894 --> 01:10:41,794
Ming, you made a lot of money.

459
01:10:41,896 --> 01:10:43,659
A lot of money.

460
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:21,618
Ming, do you want to take this delivery?

461
01:12:29,337 --> 01:12:32,272
Two small broccoli chicken and a fried rice.

462
01:13:11,913 --> 01:13:14,108
- Noodle?
- No.

463
01:13:14,215 --> 01:13:15,807
- Wonton skin?
- We have that.

464
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:18,681
- We don't have fries, right?
- Yes.

465
01:13:38,506 --> 01:13:40,633
We don't need flour? How about wine?

466
01:13:40,742 --> 01:13:42,403
Yes.

467
01:14:21,482 --> 01:14:23,916
Two bags of rice. Three tins of oil.

468
01:14:24,018 --> 01:14:26,851
One dozen bottles of wine.
One case of soy sauce.

469
01:14:26,954 --> 01:14:28,979
One case of flour.

470
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:32,355
One case of MSG. Two cases of shrimp.

471
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:13,408
- Are you going out?
- No, I don't want to.

472
01:18:13,514 --> 01:18:15,505
I've been in Chinatown
for more than 10 years.

473
01:18:15,616 --> 01:18:17,914
Not Chinatown.
You should go somewhere else.

474
01:18:18,019 --> 01:18:23,321
Like New Jersey or
the casinos in Connecticut.

475
01:18:23,424 --> 01:18:27,588
I don't have money for gambling.

476
01:18:27,695 --> 01:18:28,821
Gamble away.

477
01:19:40,101 --> 01:19:42,331
I told him I'm taking a day off.

478
01:19:44,372 --> 01:19:46,169
Is your daughter
also taking tomorrow off?

479
01:19:46,273 --> 01:19:47,831
Today and tomorrow.

480
01:19:49,009 --> 01:19:51,477
Her job is a little more relaxed.

481
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:52,773
A little more relaxed.

482
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,314
Working in a Japanese restaurant is easier.

483
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:57,317
More money?

484
01:19:57,418 --> 01:20:00,012
Yeah, she makes more money.

485
01:20:00,121 --> 01:20:01,713
You should go work there then.

486
01:20:01,822 --> 01:20:03,289
I don't want to work there.

487
01:20:03,391 --> 01:20:06,292
- Why not?
- I don't like waitressing.

488
01:20:47,067 --> 01:20:48,557
Be here earlier tomorrow.

489
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:50,103
How early?

490
01:20:50,204 --> 01:20:53,435
You have to make chicken halves
and chicken wings.

491
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:55,008
Be here earlier tomorrow.

492
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,770
Hey, Ming, shut the gate.

493
01:21:22,636 --> 01:21:24,103
Did you check the stoves and the lights?

494
01:21:24,205 --> 01:21:26,002
Yeah, everything is turned off.

495
01:21:26,106 --> 01:21:27,300
Okay. Let's go.

496
01:21:39,553 --> 01:21:42,545
- Good-bye.
- There goes another day.

497
01:21:43,657 --> 01:21:46,649
Tomorrow I'm off.
See you all the day after tomorrow.

498
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,456
- Ming, are you coming?
- I have a stomachache. You go first.

499
01:21:49,563 --> 01:21:51,622
All right, hurry home and sleep.

500
01:21:51,732 --> 01:21:53,290
Don't think too much.
See you tomorrow.

501
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:43,708
Hey.

502
01:22:46,554 --> 01:22:48,419
How much do you need?

503
01:22:48,522 --> 01:22:51,491
- What?
- How much do you need?

504
01:23:44,078 --> 01:23:45,545
How did you know?

505
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:47,113
It wasn't hard to figure out.

506
01:23:50,618 --> 01:23:52,449
I'll pay you back.

507
01:23:52,553 --> 01:23:54,851
Don't worry.
Take your time.

508
01:23:54,955 --> 01:23:56,786
I've been there.
I know what it's like.

509
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:05,723
All right, see you tomorrow.
I'm headed to the subway.
