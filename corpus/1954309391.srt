00:00:04,955 --> 00:00:07,056
<i>Alan Ball: What is it about vampires</i>

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,591
that people love so much?

4
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:10,743
(growls)

5
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:14,514
Vampires took over the entertainment world.

6
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,617
It talks about our society and our humanity

7
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,252
by looking at monsters.

8
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,687
(growls, barks)

9
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:23,256
It's the pathos of the human condition,

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,292
which is really, ultimately
everybody's search for love.

11
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,145
<i>(music playing)</i>

12
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:32,966
It's so hard to talk about the
show without talking about sex.

13
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:35,969
I was just in awe

14
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:39,305
that I was able to get
this type of opportunity.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,008
It's been the best job
I've ever had in my life.

16
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,311
This was a situation of extraordinary,

17
00:00:45,346 --> 00:00:47,981
sublime talent.

18
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:50,717
It sort of was this amazing amalgamation

19
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,952
of creativity.

20
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:54,921
It's changed my life.

21
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,260
<i>Alexander Skarsgard: It's
gonna be very emotional</i>

22
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,663
<i>now that we wrap up the final season.</i>

23
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,765
It'll be a real good-bye.

24
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,813
(tires screeching)

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,952
- I had a dentist appointment in the Valley.
- Oh, God.

26
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:28,254
- I think it was in Encino.
- (laughing)

27
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,391
For once in my life I was early

28
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,925
and I had, like, 20 minutes to kill,

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,360
so I went into a Barnes & Noble

30
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:38,097
<i>and I saw a little paperback
by Charlaine Harris,</i>

31
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,832
and the tagline on the front was

32
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:44,203
"Maybe having a vampire for a
boyfriend isn't such a good idea."

33
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,838
And I thought, "That's funny."

34
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:48,841
<i>I'd never read any vampire fiction before,</i>

35
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,510
but I could not put it down.

36
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:54,280
It was funny and smart and
very authentically Southern.

37
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,749
And I'm Southern, so I responded to that.

38
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:01,020
And I thought, "You know what, this
would make a really good TV show."

39
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:04,924
Hey, y'all have Tru Blood, for real?

40
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,492
You get vamps in here?

41
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,094
I didn't even think we
had any in Louisiana.

42
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,397
I think the idea of vampires
having come out of the coffin

43
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:15,568
and trying to assimilate
into mainstream society

44
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,103
is a pretty brilliant idea.

45
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,971
You two need to leave.

46
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,174
All right, fuck you, Billy Bob.

47
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,142
Fuck me?

48
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:31,220
<i>Ball: It's certainly an angle
on the vampire story that,</i>

49
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:33,356
to me, when I first read
it, felt incredibly fresh

50
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,526
and it made it sort of mundane,

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,130
which I think is what is so great
about her books and about the show.

52
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:44,500
<i>Deborah Ann Woll: I remember
when they first called me</i>

53
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:46,002
<i>to tell me that I was cast.</i>

54
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:48,571
<i>I was alone, I was staying
at a friend's house,</i>

55
00:02:48,605 --> 00:02:52,375
and I remember just wanting
to celebrate so badly

56
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:55,445
and there was no one there
in this, like, empty house

57
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,213
and just kind of doing this little dance

58
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:59,315
by myself in the living room.

59
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:02,819
<i>It was just a dream come true.</i>

60
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:08,791
<i>Brian Buckner: Casting's
always kind of funny</i>

61
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:10,993
<i>- 'cause you'll start to doubt the sides.
- Ball: Yes.</i>

62
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:13,663
And then somebody comes
in and makes it work

63
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:15,865
and then it becomes very obvious.

64
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:18,367
It's true. Sometimes
you're sitting there going,

65
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,536
"Oh, I thought this scene
worked, but it really doesn't... "

66
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:22,939
- Uh-huh.
- "... And I'm gonna have to completely rewrite this."

67
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:25,074
And then the person comes
in who makes it work.

68
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:27,310
<i>- Thank God I don't have to do anything.
- Ball: Absolutely.</i>

69
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:29,712
- (all laughing)
- Thank God I don't have to work any more

70
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:31,681
than is absolutely necessary.

71
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:34,584
<i>Lafayette: John, check the catfish.</i>

72
00:03:34,618 --> 00:03:36,919
<i>Ball: I remember the
casting director called me</i>

73
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:38,921
and she said, "Would you be
interested in Anna Paquin?"

74
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:41,257
<i>I was like, "Isn't she too big
for this? Would she do this?"</i>

75
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,159
I don't... I'm confused.

76
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:45,595
<i>They said, "No, she really read
it, she really responded to it.</i>

77
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:47,063
She'll come in and read for you."

78
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:49,432
And you did and we made
you jump through the hoops.

79
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:51,334
A little bit, yeah, but that's fine.

80
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,835
All the jobs I've ever really loved

81
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,304
were the ones that I had
to do some hoop jumping.

82
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,039
Otherwise, what the hell's the point?

83
00:03:57,074 --> 00:03:59,942
I remember being very nervous asking you,

84
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:02,411
"How do you feel about
dying your hair blond?"

85
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:04,147
I don't know why, but I
thought you would say, like,

86
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:06,282
- "I'm not gonna do that."
- That's really funny.

87
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:06,975
I know.

88
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,780
I know, and your answer
was like, "Sure, whatever."

89
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:10,340
(all laughing)

90
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:11,950
I said I can't guarantee
I'll look good as a blonde,

91
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:14,225
- but I'll totally do it.
- (laughing)

92
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:21,733
<i>Ball: We had a really
hard time casting Bill.</i>

93
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:23,771
We had actually taken a
couple of people to the network

94
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:26,007
and they had said, "That's
not the right person."

95
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,009
And I was thinking, "How
are we gonna find this guy?"

96
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:34,457
I was in London and I
had just returned home

97
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,527
ignominiously with having
been fired from a pilot.

98
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:39,629
I had just decided that that
was it and I had given up.

99
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:41,898
<i>I told my manager I didn't
want to read anything,</i>

100
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:43,733
and then she said,
"Okay, there's one script.

101
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,002
Read this script and I won't
make you read any others."

102
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,104
<i>And that was your script.</i>

103
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:51,474
That morning I went in... it's the first
time I'd ever done the Southern accent.

104
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:52,975
I hadn't practiced it.

105
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,178
I just walked into the
casting suite in London

106
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,779
and put myself on tape.

107
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,415
The size of that file was about this big.

108
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,751
It was about the size of a postage stamp.

109
00:05:01,785 --> 00:05:03,686
And the minute I started
watching it, I kinda went,

110
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,388
"Oh, okay, we found him."

111
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,957

<i>Sookie: Who's that?</i>

113
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,764
Oh, you noticed him, did ya?

114
00:05:11,798 --> 00:05:13,332
No, it's not like that. I just...

115
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:14,667
Everyone does.

116
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:16,168
That's Eric.

117
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:17,970
<i>He's the oldest thing in this bar.</i>

118
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:20,606
Man: Three, two, one, go!

119
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,441
Ahh!

120
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:27,880
<i>Ball: I remember the first time I
met you, you had really long hair.</i>

121
00:05:27,914 --> 00:05:30,716
<i>- And the second time...
- Not wig long, but like... </i>

122
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,318
No, it was long. You had long hair.

123
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:35,454
I thought you looked like
a Scandinavian farmer.

124
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:37,623
- Okay.
- (all laughing)

125
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:40,059
- Thank you.
- You came in to read for Bill.

126
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:41,994
Yeah, I read the first book

127
00:05:42,028 --> 00:05:44,363
and I was like, "I'm
gonna audition for Bill?

128
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:47,199
There's, like, a Viking, Swedish guy here."

129
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:49,001
(all laughing)

130
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:51,370
"But, hey, why not?" You know?

131
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:53,038
That was for the pilot.

132
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:55,341
- Eric doesn't show up until the fourth episode.
- Right, right.

133
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,577
But when you walked in, I
kinda went, "Oh, that's Eric."

134
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,116
- My life sucks.
- Tara, don't you be feelin' sorry for yourself.

135
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:06,685
- That's just lazy.
- Well, why can't I keep a job?

136
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,654
Maybe because you can't
keep your mouth shut.

137
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,623
Bitch, who asked you?

138
00:06:10,657 --> 00:06:13,692
I'll never forget when I came into
that first scene I did with you

139
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:16,662
and you just kind of opened
your arms and you welcomed me.

140
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:19,632
And I cannot tell you
how safe I felt to work

141
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,201
and be okay even though
I was really nervous.

142
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:23,769
(laughing) I was really nervous.

143
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:25,070
I was like, "Please don't fire me."

144
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:26,605
- (all laughing)
- "Please don't fire me."

145
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,107
I still worry about that.

146
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:30,109
(laughing) Yeah.

147
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,144
- Buckner: I remember their first day.
- Yeah, it was down in...

148
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:33,579
- at Alex's Bar.
- In Long Beach.

149
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:35,648
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Parking lot in Long Beach.

150
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:39,151
- You had just flown in from...
- The Philippines.

151
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:40,953
- Literally just flown in.
- Literally.

152
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:43,789
Went to a fang fitting, went to wardrobe.

153
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:46,859
They strapped me into that
corset I couldn't sit down in.

154
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,360
<i>Met Anna and Stephen.</i>

155
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:50,296
- Who's the doll?
- Pam, this is Sookie.

156
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,125
- Sookie, this is Pam.
- Pleased to meet you.

157

<i>Van Straten: And I
remember being so out of it</i>

158
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,528

00:06:57,562 --> 00:07:00,364
(speaking Swedish)

160
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,833
... and I remember saying to you,

161
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:05,469
- "Is that Cambodian?"
- (all laughing)

162
00:07:06,638 --> 00:07:09,306
- And you went, "No."
- "Yes."

163
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:11,375
Yeah! (Laughing)

164
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,377
- I'm half Cambodian.
- And you probably thought,

165
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:15,880
"Who is this chick I'm stuck with?"

166
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:18,149
And I was like, "I think
he's kind of serious."

167

(all laughing)

168
00:07:21,052 --> 00:07:22,720
I don't know if it was the first day,

169
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:25,122
but one of the days on the pilot

close to their lines."

- (laughing)

195

That's totally okay.

196
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:28,563
With the nature of the show, too,

197
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:31,199
because it is not necessarily
that episodic classic

198
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,268
where you sort of go
back to where you start

199
00:08:33,302 --> 00:08:36,404
that we, as actors, have a chance to play

200
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:39,307
breadth and silence and
live with these moments.

201
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:41,242
It's about creating yourself.

202
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:45,313

something of a journey to go towards.

209
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:07,319

210
00:09:07,354 --> 00:09:09,788

211

basically I was on the phone

302
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,836
I would not have been able
to pull that out of my ass.

303

- No.
- That's pretty good.

304
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:24,109
And ultimately, I think, that
actually is what this show is about.

305
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:28,080
How could a show about the horrors
of intimacy not address love

306
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:29,848
and being in love and what that means?

307
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:33,485
Because to me vampires are
kind of a metaphor for sex.

308
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,688
You know, I read in "Hustler"
everybody should have sex

00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:02,140
- through sex in the show.
- She has.

337
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:03,942
- Yes, she has.
- Arlene, not so much.

338
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:05,677
- Um...
- (Ball laughing)

339
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:08,480
- You know, in an orgy with black contact lenses.
- I remember that.

340
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:10,649
- That was a good sex scene.
- (laughing)

341
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:13,385
- (music playing)
- (people moaning)

342
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,921
<i>- Buckner: The night of the orgy.
- Oh, God.</i>

343
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:17,956
- Which orgy?
- (laughing)

344
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:20,425
<i>Buckner: There was just
this moment where Alan and I</i>

345
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,660
were sitting behind the monitors

346
00:15:21,694 --> 00:15:23,562
<i>and we kind of couldn't believe</i>

347
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:26,031
how fucking out of control
this thing had gotten.

348
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:26,832
(moaning)

349
00:15:26,867 --> 00:15:29,035
I think whole relationships were had

350
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,737
within the three days of that.

351
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:34,573
I saw a lot of things that
I cannot burn from my memory.

352
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:36,409
- Cannot unthink.
- Yes.

353
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:41,480
(speaking Greek)

354
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:44,717
The thing about Maryann
is what she was preaching

355
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:47,320
was basically a life of sensual fulfillment

356
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,689
with no guilt and no shame.

357
00:15:49,723 --> 00:15:52,058
(chanting)

358
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:54,727
There is actually something
kind of appealing about that

359
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:57,730
because, I mean, wouldn't it
be great to just sort of, like,

360
00:15:57,764 --> 00:16:01,233
let some hot, sexy
creature just devour you?

361
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:04,337
- Okay, we don't want that to happen in real life.
- Really?

362
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:07,506
- (laughs)
- Well, some of us don't.

363
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,843
But I think, in a way, the show lets people

364
00:16:10,877 --> 00:16:14,313
sort of vicariously experience that

365
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,917
through all the crazy things
that happen to all the characters.

366
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:19,952
<i>Buckner: That's part of
why the finale is daunting.</i>

367
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:22,321
As the person tasked with
bringing this thing home,

368
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:27,693
I'm very conscious of
bringing it back to a center.

369
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:29,462
I think we had a lot of wild sex.

370
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:32,765
<i>We really let go of convention,</i>

371
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,101
but I think people will sort of feel like

372
00:16:35,135 --> 00:16:37,269
this was a love story
at the end of the day.

373
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:38,337
What about a song and dance number?

374
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,905
People love song and dance numbers.

375
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,074
They love that. Let's chuck
the finale and just do that.

376
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:44,210
- That always works.
- Yeah.

377
00:16:44,244 --> 00:16:45,644
- When in doubt...
- Are you game?

378
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,647
- Bucky, you know I'm game.
- Okay.

379
00:16:48,682 --> 00:16:50,916
<i>(music playing)</i>

380
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:52,618
(screaming)

381
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:07,900
The villains on this show
have never been "just evil."

382
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:11,637
Everybody has something
primal inside of them.

383
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:14,373
You know, how many of us would
love to, like, just... you know,

384
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,050
somebody pisses us off, wouldn't
it be great just to behead them?

385
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:19,979
A lot of times there's
good and there's bad.

386
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:23,116
And good must vanquish bad.

387
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,719
But our show's about all
of the stuff in between.

388
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,555
<i>Skarsgard: That's what... I had
so much fun with Eric's character.</i>

389
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,057
He's presented as the "bad guy."

390
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:35,695
People are quite lazy in a way,
or they want to be fed in a way.

391
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,399
It's like, "Okay, easy... good
guy, bad guy and the girl, great."

392
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,360
And you eat your popcorn.

393
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:42,399
<i>But then when Godric appeared,</i>

394
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:45,835
you realize, "Wait a
minute, he actually cares

395
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,471
about this guy and
there's warmth in there."

396
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:51,408
Godric.

397
00:17:51,442 --> 00:17:53,743
<i>Skarsgard: I find that
dramatically very interesting</i>

398
00:17:53,778 --> 00:17:56,713
because then people go, like,
"Wait, no, no, no. That was...

399
00:17:56,747 --> 00:17:58,268
I was rooting for this guy,
but this was a bad guy."

400
00:17:58,302 --> 00:18:01,438
Yeah, everybody's done something horrible.

401
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:03,473
Yeah, we love our vampires, but...

402
00:18:03,508 --> 00:18:05,275
they can be pretty fucking savage.

403
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:07,777
It's that vampire... Russell...

404
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:09,412
what's his face?!

405
00:18:09,447 --> 00:18:11,381
Edgington.

406
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:14,885
Peace is for pussies.

407
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,554
Russell Edgington, as played by

408
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:20,590
the absolutely extraordinary Denis O'Hare,

409
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,658
is a total badass.

410
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:24,561
Put your fangs away.

411
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:26,263
He just had so much fun with that part.

412
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:28,365
Fantastic!

413
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:32,235
From watching him do Russell
was just an absolute joy.

414
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:36,806
Ooh, they will suffer for
their sins, my beloved.

415
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:38,708
I swear...

416
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,344
- Like, he was doing Shakespeare.
- Yeah.

417
00:18:41,379 --> 00:18:42,343
(groans)

418
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:44,500
We will eat you

419
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:46,936
after we eat your children.

420
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:51,173
Now time for the weather. Tiffany?

421
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,509
<i>Moyer: When that episode
went out, the next day</i>

422
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:57,947
Obama came into a huge press briefing

423
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:01,183
and opened with, "Did anybody
see 'True Blood' last night?"

424

<i>- (all laughing)

427
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:08,791
I like that scene when Sam is the fly

428
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:10,126
and then he goes inside and then...

429
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,328
<i>- Oh, yeah.

<i>Buckner: That's correct.</i>

440
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:30,941
She's like, "Should I
take it in the mouth?"

441
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:32,742
<i>- Van Straten: Yeah.
- "Should my mouth be open?"</i>

442

<i>Van Straten: It was a hose
up the side of Longshadow.</i>

444
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:40,776
And then if you followed the hose,

445
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,412
there was a big orange ladder
with, like, two construction workers

446
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,481
pouring gallons of blood
into this huge funnel,

447
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:46,949
like shoving it in there.

448
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,553

like a minute or two.

<i>- 'cause I had that recently.
- Paquin: Actually, it's not.</i>

452
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:58,232
Do you know why? 'Cause nobody
had ever had it before on the show,

453

it was a very emotional moment.

461
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:21,221

469
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,438

holding this blood bag

471
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:42,175

'Cause of your smile.

482
00:21:13,878 --> 00:21:15,579
That just has always stuck in my mind

483
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:18,515
as one of the most beautiful,
well-acted scenes in the show.

484
00:21:21,385 --> 00:21:22,752
<i>Lauren Bowles: One of my favorite episodes</i>

485

babies was great fun.</i>

489
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:41,204
And my favorite line I've ever gotten
to say was in that episode as well,

490
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,672
where I just got to look at Andy and say...

491
00:21:42,707 --> 00:21:44,574
You're a dick.

492
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:50,547

493
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:54,451

and Jesus got to go on.

494

- Your teeth is wobbling.
- (laughing)

495
00:21:58,856 --> 00:22:00,290

497
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:05,262
<i>We were attached together</i>

498
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:07,230

499

<i>And so we were spinning
with it and moving around.</i>

500
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:16,473
Once you see it edited, it looks so trippy.

501

my favorite experiences.

00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:27,884
My favorite scene was where Steve
came out of the closet to Jason.

505
00:22:27,918 --> 00:22:29,986
You know, there's something
that I've been gathering up

506
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:31,888
the courage to tell you
ever since the moment

507
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:35,325
I found out you were sleeping with my wife.

508
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,562
What hurt me was that
she got to sleep with you.

509
00:22:39,597 --> 00:22:41,865
<i>McMillian: That was,
really, for the first time,</i>

510
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:46,102
Steve Newlin revealed who
he was and what his truth was

511
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:47,871
and what his real feelings were.

512
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:51,308
I'm a gay vampire American.

513
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:55,145
(sighs)

514
00:22:56,547 --> 00:22:58,682
And I love you, Jason Stackhouse.

515
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:03,553
- It's insanity!
- Our existence is insanity.

516
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:07,590
<i>Skarsgard: We had about 15 minutes
to shoot Godric's death scene</i>

517
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:10,360
'cause it was as the sun was coming up.

518
00:23:10,394 --> 00:23:11,518
_

519
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:16,171
_

520
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,435
<i>Skarsgard: We rehearsed it for three hours.</i>

521
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:21,371
We blocked it and then
waited till the right time.

522
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:23,473
When we knew that it was six minutes

523
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:26,943
<i>before you would see
the sun on the horizon.</i>

524
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:30,613
- Let me go.
- (crying)

525
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:33,783
<i>Skarsgard: That was the only
moment, so far on the show,</i>

526
00:23:33,818 --> 00:23:36,386
where we knew we had three
takes and that was it.

527
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:55,505
The difficult thing about
really coming to terms

528
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:58,608
with the fact that this show
is ending is that it's ending.

529
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:00,276
(laughs)

530
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:02,445
And, um, it's not another script

531
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,181
or plot point or story line.

532
00:24:05,216 --> 00:24:06,850
It's actually ending.

533
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,821
<i>Buckner: I hope that it is thought of</i>

534
00:24:11,856 --> 00:24:15,550
as more than just
another supernatural show.

535
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:19,206
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, I hope that people go, "It said something."

536
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,131
I would love for it to
be remembered as the show

537
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:22,866
that brought about world peace.

538
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,035
(all laughing)

539
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:28,605
To me, it's been the most
fun thing I ever worked on.

540
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:31,708
That's not to say all the
other things weren't fun,

541
00:24:31,776 --> 00:24:34,544
but, this one is the most fun, yeah.

542
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:36,546
<i>Moyer: I completely concur.</i>

543
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:39,249
Obviously, I met Anna that first day

544
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:41,184
and you don't expect to meet the person

545
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:44,554
that you're gonna get married
to on the job that you're doing

546
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:46,189
and have as much fun on the job as well.

547
00:24:46,224 --> 00:24:48,758
The first season I was like,

548
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:49,993
"This set... everyone's so great.

549
00:24:50,027 --> 00:24:51,328
Everyone's so nice and welcoming."

550
00:24:51,362 --> 00:24:53,396
You were like, "This
doesn't happen all the time."

551
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:54,965
- (all laughing)
- You were like,

552
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:56,900
"This is special. This is rare."

553
00:24:56,934 --> 00:24:59,569
And I've just treasured that

554
00:24:59,604 --> 00:25:01,738
the whole seven years.

555
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:04,841
It's been... I think, being on the
show has meant everything to me.

556
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:08,011
I felt like I was nostalgic
in the second season.

557
00:25:08,045 --> 00:25:10,046
- You know, it's...
- (all laughing)

558
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:13,183
I was already dreading the end then.

559
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:15,519
It's gonna be very emotional,

560
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:18,989
I'm sure, now towards the
end of this final season.

561
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:22,092
<i>Ellis: Yeah, it's gonna
be hard walking away</i>

562
00:25:22,126 --> 00:25:24,161
from Lafayette's shoes.

563
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:27,097
- I'm gonna miss...
- I'm sure they'll give you the shoes.

564
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:28,899
(all laugh)

565
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:32,002
<i>Ellis: I'm gonna miss the makeup.</i>

566
00:25:32,036 --> 00:25:35,972
I loved, loved, loved, loved,
loved playing Lafayette.

567
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:37,474
My friends, sometimes, would be like,

568
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:39,242
"Dude, you walkin' like Lafayette, stop."

569
00:25:39,277 --> 00:25:40,510
(all laughing)

570
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:42,879
Or out of... all of a sudden I'll be like,

571
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:44,381
"Well, you know what we gon' do?"

572
00:25:44,415 --> 00:25:47,284
And I go, "Oh, that's a...
that's a Lafayette thing."

573
00:25:47,318 --> 00:25:49,119
(all laughing)

574
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:53,757
<i>Woll: It'll be really
hard to say good-bye.</i>

575
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:57,494
Even when a character
dies or leaves the show,

576
00:25:57,528 --> 00:25:59,129
you know, a little piece of you goes,

577
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:03,200
"Oh, God, I'll never see
that character again."

578
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:08,271
And a piece of that
will also be sad for me.

579
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:11,274
<i>Van Straten: It's actually
hard to encapsulate</i>

580
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:15,312
what being part of a show
like this means to me.

581
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:17,547
(voice breaking) I'll cry.

582
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:20,383
My husband was saying,

583
00:26:20,418 --> 00:26:23,853
"That's longer than high
school and junior high."

584
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:27,891
You know, except we don't
have any of those bad people.

585
00:26:27,925 --> 00:26:29,859
<i>Manganiello: It was a
childhood dream for me</i>

586
00:26:29,894 --> 00:26:33,964
as a kid who grew up watching horror movies

587
00:26:33,998 --> 00:26:37,534
to get to play a monster.

588
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:40,437
<i>McMillian: I will remember and
miss the people that I worked with</i>

589
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:45,008
on the show until my final days.

590
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:47,210
<i>Bowles: This little moment in time has been</i>

591
00:26:47,245 --> 00:26:50,814
an absolute dream...
dream, dream come true.

592
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:54,251
<i>Paquin: This show has changed my life.</i>

593
00:26:54,285 --> 00:26:57,220
I will miss it terribly.

594
00:26:57,255 --> 00:26:58,555
(kisses)

595
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:05,562
