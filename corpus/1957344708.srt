00:42:48,138 --> 00:42:49,538
Down there.

734
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:51,104
I live down there too.

735
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:51,938
See you!

736
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:58,971
That kid's lucky I didn't
punch him in the face.

737
00:42:59,004 --> 00:43:04,004
[singing in foreign language]
[light orchestral music]

738
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:16,238
You kids behave
yourselves today.

739
00:43:16,271 --> 00:43:17,171
Okay?

740
00:43:17,204 --> 00:43:18,104
Beaux can't take care of you.

741
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:20,171
He has got his own stuff.

742
00:43:20,204 --> 00:43:21,138
And no sulking.

743
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:22,071
No sulking around.

744
00:43:22,104 --> 00:43:23,904
It will only piss him off.

745
00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:25,104
All right.

746
00:43:25,138 --> 00:43:26,538
He's not used to you
kids and all the energy

747
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:29,138
that you bring to the party.

748
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:33,104
And I really think one or
both of you needs to apologize

749
00:43:33,138 --> 00:43:35,171
for upsetting him
in the first place.

750
00:43:35,204 --> 00:43:36,471
All right?

751
00:43:36,505 --> 00:43:37,138
Why?

752
00:43:39,505 --> 00:43:41,938
I just think that things
would go a lot smoother

753
00:43:41,971 --> 00:43:44,204
if you apologize so
he can feel better

754
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:47,138
about you guys
ruining his time off.

755
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:52,138
- He didn't sign up for this.
- Whoo!

756
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:56,138
Come on, baby.

757
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:58,204
Okay, okay, okay, stop it.

758
00:43:58,238 --> 00:44:00,704
Sticky bun in the oven
and coffee's right there.

759
00:44:00,737 --> 00:44:02,004
It's fresh.

760
00:44:02,038 --> 00:44:03,971
[Beaux] I'm starving.

761
00:44:09,871 --> 00:44:10,704
What?

762
00:44:12,204 --> 00:44:15,737
They would like to
apologize for last night.

763
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:18,104
I think they're
just feeling too shy

764
00:44:18,138 --> 00:44:20,038
or a little too ungrateful

765
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:22,071
right now to make
the effort right now.

766
00:44:22,104 --> 00:44:23,238
No apologies necessary.

767
00:44:23,272 --> 00:44:27,038
We are 100% cool, right guys?

768
00:44:27,071 --> 00:44:30,538
- He asked you a question.
- Ease off 'em a little, huh?

769
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:31,771
I get it.

770
00:44:31,804 --> 00:44:33,204
My old man beat
the shit outta me

771
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:37,004
when I got outta line
and I forgave him.

772
00:44:37,038 --> 00:44:40,704
Plus me and the kid are
going fishing today.

773
00:44:42,272 --> 00:44:45,038
Set everything straight,
okay with you kid?

774
00:44:45,071 --> 00:44:46,671
With worms?

775
00:44:46,704 --> 00:44:48,704
With any goddamn
thing that works.

776
00:44:48,737 --> 00:44:51,637
[Eve] What do you say, Nico?

777
00:44:51,671 --> 00:44:52,904
Thank you.

778
00:44:52,938 --> 00:44:55,871
You are most certainly
welcome, young man.

779
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,138

get a pedicure later.

You have a beautiful voice.

794
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:15,537
You know that Billy Holiday

795
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,004
was born in a house
of ill repute?

796
00:46:19,038 --> 00:46:20,004
You like her?

Hard not to if you like her.

798
00:46:21,104 --> 00:46:22,604
She was beautiful.

799
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,004
My dad named me after her.

800
00:46:26,038 --> 00:46:29,637
Is your dad the guy
with the chunky arms?

801
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:31,139
That's not my dad.

802
00:46:32,505 --> 00:46:34,239
Do you wanna do something?

I caught it.

He was next to me the
whole time, the little guy.

He pulled out his penis.

What?

851
00:49:50,972 --> 00:49:52,139

to know something.

I need to get
these clothes off.

caught something of her own.

faster than her mother.

Did he give you weed?

872
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:42,105
No, he made Nico look at him.

873
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:44,239
Did what?

874
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:47,172
He made Nico
touch his privates.

to bring you here.

wants to join us for dinner.

knows all about that.

smokes for god's sake.

store to pick up some smokes.

get cigarettes and beer.

Get your things, we're going.

out, wherever you are.

01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:37,504
[light orchestral music]

1098
01:09:37,537 --> 01:09:39,039
- What did you see?
- You ending my life.

1099
01:09:39,072 --> 01:09:41,005
[all laughing]

1100
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:44,872
[all chattering indistinctly]

1101
01:09:47,772 --> 01:09:49,704
[Billy] Try it again.

1102
01:09:58,637 --> 01:10:00,805
[Nico] What did you see?

1103
01:10:07,072 --> 01:10:09,204
[Billy] Try it again.

1104
01:10:24,772 --> 01:10:27,570
[Malik urinating]

1105
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:37,838
I can swim better than anyone.

1106
01:10:37,872 --> 01:10:39,972
And I'm only 11.

1107
01:10:40,005 --> 01:10:42,637
[Malik] Let's get out of here.

1108
01:10:46,772 --> 01:10:49,872
[light guitar music]

1109
01:10:52,905 --> 01:10:55,039
Three four, shut the door.

1110
01:10:56,672 --> 01:10:58,772
Five six, pick up sticks.

1111
01:11:08,138 --> 01:11:10,071
[all chattering]

1112
01:11:10,104 --> 01:11:11,905
Other than the fact it's
the most disturbing thing

1113
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:13,171
I have ever done?

1114
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,504
It's not that bad.

1115
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:18,138
Oh very cool.

1116
01:11:18,171 --> 01:11:20,071
In fact, fucking amazing.

1117
01:11:23,604 --> 01:11:25,071
[Nico] I'm hungry.

1118
01:11:45,972 --> 01:11:46,838
Yo, come on guys!

1119
01:11:46,872 --> 01:11:47,872
Check it out!

1120
01:11:47,905 --> 01:11:48,738
Hurry up!

1121
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,104
You're mad slow.

1122
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:53,204
Come on.

1123
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:01,138
Smells like dog food.

1124
01:12:03,838 --> 01:12:05,038
[Nico] Tastes good.

1125
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:08,838
Imagine your favorite
food and take a bite.

1126
01:12:08,872 --> 01:12:10,204
[Nico] Shrimp tempura.

1127
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:11,138
Calamari.

1128
01:12:15,838 --> 01:12:18,570
[Billy coughing]

1129
01:12:27,838 --> 01:12:29,605
[Billy] So where
are we going to go?

1130
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:30,470
South.

1131
01:12:31,271 --> 01:12:33,470
My dad lives in Florida.

1132
01:12:38,104 --> 01:12:42,038
It's practically like a
different country down there.

1133
01:12:42,071 --> 01:12:43,872
hey have snakes as long as cars,

1134
01:12:43,905 --> 01:12:46,138
monkeys, and trees.

1135
01:12:46,171 --> 01:12:49,905
- Can I have one as a pet?
- What about our dad?

1136
01:12:49,938 --> 01:12:51,571
[Malik] We can send for him.

1137
01:12:51,605 --> 01:12:53,838
He can make old friends.

1138
01:12:53,872 --> 01:12:56,738
[Billy] Do you think they
have good schools for Nico?

1139
01:12:56,772 --> 01:12:58,004
[Malik] Shit, how do I know?

1140
01:12:58,038 --> 01:13:00,672
Can't be any worse than
the ones we got here.

1141
01:13:00,705 --> 01:13:03,705
[Nico] I want to
be home-schooled.

1142
01:13:06,504 --> 01:13:08,138
[Malik] I think Billie
Holiday spent the last years

1143
01:13:08,171 --> 01:13:10,138
of her life down there.

1144
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:11,271
[Billy] Really?

1145
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:15,138
[Malik] Probably not but
it's way nicer than here.

1146
01:13:35,038 --> 01:13:36,004
[Nico] Can we go?

1147
01:13:36,038 --> 01:13:36,938
It's really cold

1148
01:13:36,971 --> 01:13:38,204
I think we should just
go back to the boat.

1149
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:39,104
It's a really bad idea.

1150
01:13:39,138 --> 01:13:40,171
Shhhhh.

1151
01:13:41,605 --> 01:13:42,571
Everybody!

1152
01:13:42,605 --> 01:13:43,171
Shhh.

1153
01:13:43,204 --> 01:13:44,672
Keep it down, okay?

1154
01:13:44,705 --> 01:13:46,505
I don't want her to
know I am out here.

1155
01:13:46,538 --> 01:13:47,672
Don't you know that by now?

1156
01:13:47,705 --> 01:13:48,871
We gotta go.

1157
01:13:50,772 --> 01:13:51,571
[grunting]

1158
01:13:51,605 --> 01:13:53,805
We gotta get going now.

1159
01:13:53,838 --> 01:13:54,638
Help me.

1160
01:13:54,672 --> 01:13:55,738
Would you do that?

1161
01:13:55,772 --> 01:13:56,538
- Yeah.
- I have tremors.

1162
01:13:56,571 --> 01:13:58,838
You ever seen a tremor?

1163
01:13:58,871 --> 01:13:59,705
Ready?

1164
01:14:04,638 --> 01:14:07,538
I'm down to one,
one before dinner.

1165
01:14:09,638 --> 01:14:12,071
[Malik] Stop moving please.

1166
01:14:16,071 --> 01:14:17,471
There you go.

1167
01:14:17,505 --> 01:14:18,738
Thank you very much,
I appreciate that.

1168
01:14:18,772 --> 01:14:19,672
You're welcome.

1169
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,837
We should get going.

1170
01:14:21,871 --> 01:14:23,104
Oh yeah?

1171
01:14:23,138 --> 01:14:24,904
Well if you gotta
go, you gotta go.

1172
01:14:24,938 --> 01:14:27,071
Hey listen let me
ask you a question.

1173
01:14:27,104 --> 01:14:31,171
I'm down to one right
before dinner, you know?

1174
01:14:31,204 --> 01:14:32,004
Hey hey hey!

1175
01:14:32,038 --> 01:14:33,038
Come on.

1176
01:14:33,071 --> 01:14:33,971
What's going on?

1177
01:14:34,004 --> 01:14:36,471
Are you running from something?

1178
01:14:37,605 --> 01:14:39,672
Are you running
away from something?

1179
01:14:39,705 --> 01:14:41,871
No we're just taking a walk.

1180
01:14:41,904 --> 01:14:43,171
Can I come?

1181
01:14:43,204 --> 01:14:44,104
Can I?

1182
01:14:44,138 --> 01:14:46,238
Well, you're kind of old.

1183
01:14:46,271 --> 01:14:47,672
Kind of old?

1184
01:14:47,705 --> 01:14:49,004
Who are you kids?

1185
01:14:49,038 --> 01:14:51,004
We're renegades and outlaws.

1186
01:14:51,038 --> 01:14:53,138
Well, if you want to
stay with me, you can.

1187
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:54,605
That's if she'll have you,

1188
01:14:54,638 --> 01:14:55,571
if she'll have you.

1189
01:14:55,605 --> 01:14:56,571
That's very sweet.

1190
01:14:56,605 --> 01:14:57,571
Thank you.

1191
01:14:57,605 --> 01:14:59,038
And that's if you are hungry.

1192
01:14:59,071 --> 01:15:00,571
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

1193
01:15:00,605 --> 01:15:01,204
[Owen] Yeah?

1194
01:15:01,238 --> 01:15:02,672
You like tuna casserole?

1195
01:15:02,705 --> 01:15:04,038
- Yeah.
- You do?

1196
01:15:04,071 --> 01:15:05,071
Help me up.

1197
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:06,104
[grunting]

1198
01:15:06,138 --> 01:15:07,538
I'm down to one.

1199
01:15:07,571 --> 01:15:09,138
Don't tell her you
gotta do me that favor.

1200
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,772
- I'm not going to tell her.
- No.

1201
01:15:10,804 --> 01:15:12,004
You won't say anything either?

1202
01:15:12,038 --> 01:15:14,004
- I won't say anything.
- You wont say a word.

1203
01:15:14,038 --> 01:15:15,605
Follow me!

1204
01:15:15,638 --> 01:15:16,871
[door clicking]

1205
01:15:16,904 --> 01:15:17,738
Honey!

1206
01:15:19,204 --> 01:15:20,605
Honey!

1207
01:15:20,638 --> 01:15:22,238
Come on, come on.

1208
01:15:22,271 --> 01:15:26,138
[Louise] What have
you brought me now?

1209
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:27,672
We have company.

1210
01:15:28,638 --> 01:15:29,638
Hi, ma'am.

1211
01:15:31,104 --> 01:15:33,171
[Louise] Did my husband
promise you some food?

1212
01:15:33,204 --> 01:15:34,038
Mm-hmm.

1213
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,505
Tuna casserole.

1214
01:15:36,705 --> 01:15:41,771
Well, wash up, help yourselves
to a plate and have a seat.

1215
01:15:43,204 --> 01:15:45,038
Wash them clean now.

1216
01:15:47,204 --> 01:15:48,871
We eat fast, okay?

1217
01:15:49,904 --> 01:15:50,738
Okay.

1218
01:15:51,804 --> 01:15:52,705
[Louise] All right now.

1219
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:54,505
Be careful, take your time.

1220
01:15:54,538 --> 01:15:57,538
You don't want to get
sick, there's plenty here.

1221
01:15:57,571 --> 01:15:59,004
- It's so good.
- This food is great.

1222
01:15:59,038 --> 01:16:01,038
Well I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

1223
01:16:01,071 --> 01:16:02,672
[Malik] Delicious.

1224
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:05,971
[Louise] So are you
kids from the park?

1225
01:16:06,004 --> 01:16:08,605
No, we're just
passing through.

1226
01:16:08,638 --> 01:16:09,938
Oh, passing through?

1227
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:13,171
- Yeah, they're outlaws.
- And gangsters.

1228
01:16:13,204 --> 01:16:15,171
[Louise] Heavens,
imagine that.

1229
01:16:15,204 --> 01:16:17,171
[Owen] And soon
I'll be joining them.

1230
01:16:17,204 --> 01:16:18,672
Right?

1231
01:16:18,705 --> 01:16:19,505
Yeah.

1232
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:20,938
Well, you be my guest,

1233
01:16:20,971 --> 01:16:23,638
but if you get caught, I
won't be there to get you out.

1234
01:16:23,672 --> 01:16:25,804
We don't get caught.

1235
01:16:25,837 --> 01:16:27,004
Oh.

1236
01:16:27,038 --> 01:16:28,638
So so your parents
know you are outlaws?

1237
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:31,071
My dad's in the
hospital, getting better.

1238
01:16:31,104 --> 01:16:33,938
- Oh he's sick?
- He drinks a lot.

1239
01:16:35,104 --> 01:16:36,904
This is great food
Louise, thank you.

1240
01:16:36,938 --> 01:16:38,138
Thank you.

1241
01:16:38,171 --> 01:16:39,971
I don't believe
I know your name?

1242
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:40,804
Billy.

1243
01:16:40,837 --> 01:16:41,971
My name is Billy.

1244
01:16:42,004 --> 01:16:45,071
[Louise] With a name like
that I bet you sing, huh?

1245
01:16:45,104 --> 01:16:46,804
A little bit.

1246
01:16:46,837 --> 01:16:48,471
That is a big deal, you know?

1247
01:16:48,505 --> 01:16:50,704
That is a big deal.

1248
01:16:50,737 --> 01:16:51,737
Yes it is.

1249
01:16:53,538 --> 01:16:55,071
Have you been smoking
again, sweetheart?

1250
01:16:55,104 --> 01:16:56,871
Why do you ask me?

1251
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:58,004
He didn't smoke.

1252
01:16:58,038 --> 01:16:59,171
He wasn't smoking.

1253
01:16:59,204 --> 01:17:00,104
[Louise] Somebody was smoking.

1254
01:17:00,138 --> 01:17:02,771
That smells little
like smoke over here.

1255
01:17:02,804 --> 01:17:06,004
- Well I was outside.
- Okay.

1256
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,004
Okay.

1257
01:17:07,038 --> 01:17:07,804
Hold on for a second.

1258
01:17:07,837 --> 01:17:09,171
I think I am about
to bust a gut.

1259
01:17:09,204 --> 01:17:11,704
[laughing]

1260
01:17:11,737 --> 01:17:12,804
I'm really stuffed.

1261
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:15,804
I told you that her tuna
casserole was the best.

1262
01:17:15,837 --> 01:17:16,671
Didn't I?

1263
01:17:18,505 --> 01:17:19,938
[All] It's really good.

1264
01:17:19,971 --> 01:17:21,104
[Louise] When you're hungry,
it really tastes good too,

1265
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:22,138
doesn't it?

1266
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:23,004
Yes.

1267
01:17:23,938 --> 01:17:26,004
[Billy] Thank you
so much, it's great.

1268
01:17:26,038 --> 01:17:27,171
You're very welcome.

1269
01:17:27,204 --> 01:17:31,737
You know, when I am done
we really have to get going.

1270
01:17:31,771 --> 01:17:33,138
Well if you want to
leave, that's okay.

1271
01:17:33,171 --> 01:17:35,505
But I think I'd like to
take Billy in the back

1272
01:17:35,538 --> 01:17:37,505
and let's do something
fun with your hair, okay?

1273
01:17:37,538 --> 01:17:39,171
We're going to have some fun.

1274
01:17:39,204 --> 01:17:41,038
