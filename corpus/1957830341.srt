00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,667
I know we should've
gone in with her.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,291
Oh, come on.

7
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,750
It's only been 17 minutes.

8
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:30,125
It only takes 1 minute to say

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,709
I know you've been cheating.

10
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:35,500
She should have just
slashed his tires.

11
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,875
Okay, this is not
sophomore year of college.

12
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:44,125
Adam was so mad!

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,709
Okay, but not as mad as his dad.

14
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:47,834
It was his car, remember?

15
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:52,500
I am glad that we have matured.

16
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,375
And that Reesa decided
to handle this whole thing...

17
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,000
Reesa: Go! Go!
Melina: Whoa!

18
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:00,417
Start the car!

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,583
Oh, hey! Reesa?
What's up with the dog?

20
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,083
It is my dog!

21
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,333
He'll have to sue me for
custody.

22
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,458
- That a girl!
- Yes!

23
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:11,917
Oh. Okay.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,250
Reesa! Come back!

25
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,959
Thank you for being there
for me today.

26
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,201
I know I did the right thing,

27
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,375
but it still hurts.

28
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,792
I'm just glad you came
to your senses.

29
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:31,458
And you know what?

30
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,375
Look at it this way.

31
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:35,750
Now you can go
find your soulmate.

32
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:38,458
- Whee!
- Yeah!

33
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:40,875
I mean, he might be in Paris.

34
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,583
Yeah. You should
come with me this summer.

35
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:46,875
I can't.
I'm kind of a mom now.

36
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,083
Besides, I need to stay here
and find a full-time job.

37
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:50,834
I can't believe the gang's
breaking up.

38
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,500
I know.

39
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:56,208
Allison, maybe you should
reconsider

40
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,625
moving all the way
to North Carolina with Lionel.

41
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:01,375
Reesa: Uh-oh.

42
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,935
I told you I will come
and visit once a month.

43
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,041
I promise.

44
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,291
That's not fair.

45
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,083
You guys are the only two
Spelmanites

46
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,917
that I hang out with.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,709
- Ladies!
- Melina: What?

48
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:16,417
Our lives are just beginning!

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,460
Okay we may not do the things
we used to do but...

50
00:02:20,333 --> 00:02:22,291
Oh.

51
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,458
This is a celebration.

52
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,625
Um...

53
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:29,309
Here's to falling in love
with your fresh start.

54
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,458
To friendship.

55
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:32,333
Always.

56
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,625
Remember our song?

57
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,834
Oh, yeah!

58
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:38,250

The shade of growth.

74
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:18,041
The hue of prosperity.

75
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,125
The seed of creativity
is planted,

76
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,709
and I am blossoming into
a better me.

77
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:28,083
And from my lens,
to my landscape,

78
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,208
I'm inspired,
and the source of my power

79
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:35,125
is green.

80
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:37,959
Wow. I'm amazed at how
you just come up

81
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,125
with such beautiful words.

82
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

83
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,917
At one time, it was my um,

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,834
It was my dream to be an author.

85
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,083
I'm always learning
something new about you.

86
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,250
What happened?

87
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:57,041
I focused solely
on my teaching career

88
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,291
and then there wasn't any time.

89
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,041
It's never too late.

90
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,834
You sound like my friend Melina.

91
00:04:03,917 --> 00:04:05,542
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends.

92
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,166
Me too.

93
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,250
This girls' trip is long
overdue.

94
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,583
And I hope you have time
to meet my mom.

95
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,792
She'll be here next week
for the truffle hunt.

96
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,166
Surprise.

97
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,458
I'm honored.

98
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,458
But?

99
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:23,375
But do you think
we should be doing that

100
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:24,643
since I'm leaving
in a couple of months?

101
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,375
You're right, but she asked

102
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,208
to meet the woman
behind my smile,

103
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,291
and you're the woman.

104
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,417
Alli, this year

105
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,375
has been incredible
for all of us.

106
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,917
If I don't go back
to my students at A&T,

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,875
I might not have any.

108
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,750
Okay, got it, so I say,

109
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,542
we soak up the sun,
enjoy the summer.

110
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,959
Hmm...

111
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:50,917
And I've got two more months

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,458
to work my charm.

113
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,041
Come on. Let's go.

114
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,165
You haven't said anything
since we left the doctors.

115
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,667
There's nothing to say.
We keep trying.

116
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,768
If it's meant for us
to have a family,

117
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,000
it will happen.

118
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,208
As long as you're okay.

119
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,333
The weather is nice.

120
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,458
We'll get a lot of planting
done.

121
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:31,500
Oh. Here's my list.

122
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,458
Oh.

123
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,458
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

124
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,333
You're the first ones here.

125
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,250
Oh. Well, you know
what they say.

126
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,573
The early bird gets the azaleas.

127
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:45,125
So, what are we looking for?

128
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,208
Well, kale, collards, onions,
cucumbers,

129
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:49,041
tomatoes, squash.

130
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,458
Maybe strawberries?

131
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,750
Definitely strawberries.

132
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,291
A big gardener, I see.

133
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,750
A new one.
I'm recently retired.

134
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,351
We're trying our hand
at farm-to-table dinners.

135
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,667
Let's start in aisle 8.

136
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,792
I think this list is ambitious.

137
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:04,417
Don't be scared.

138
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,351
Hey girlie. I'm just out getting
gardening supplies. What's up?

139
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,709
Melina: I can't go to Italy.

140
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:15,250
I'm on my way.
We gotta go.

141
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,125
What? But I thought we were...

142
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,375
Sorry.

143
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay. This is my third batch.

144
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,333
This one has to be good.

145
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:39,458
Okay. Oh! I...

146
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:40,917
Oh! Great!

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,792
The smell. It's...

148
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,542
See? My mojo is off!
I told you.

149
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:48,709
Everything is wrong, alright?

150
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:51,208
Oh, my gosh, and I have had
this headache for weeks.

151
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,667
Okay. First just calm down.

152
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,375
And let's just talk it all
through.

153
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,166
I still can't believe that Tapas
is in the red.

154
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,917
I know.

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I told you, I cannot take out
another loan.

156
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,458
If I do not boost my sales by
the end of summer, I just...

157
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,792
Don't even go down
that rabbit hole.

158
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,750
That's why I'm here
to help you figure it out.

159
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:11,875
I just don't know why you didn't
say anything before today.

160
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,917
Come on, you know I've always
told you everything,

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,226
but I was such a burden
during chemo.

162
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,500
No, no, no. Stop that.

163
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,063
You know I wanted
to be there for you.

164
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:22,917
But still.

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,291
I thought business
would've picked up by now,

166
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,542
and thank you so much

167
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,333
for staying with me until
closing.

168
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:30,667
Of course.
That's what friends are for.

169
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,959
Yes.

170
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,750
Listen to me,
I know you're a fighter.

171
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:39,792
I watched you kick
cancer's butt,

172
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,333
and I know
you're gonna beat this.

173
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,875
Is this really all you need?

174
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,709
Yes, I told you.

175
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,992
Every restaurant that has been
featured in this magazine

176
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:55,083
has doubled their clientele,
okay?

177
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,184
And with their food critic
coming unannounced this month,

178
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,041
you see why I can't leave.

179
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,125
No, I don't.

180
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:03,041
Let one of the managers
handle it.

181
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,834
It's my restaurant.
It's my responsibility.

182
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:10,875
We have not seen
our girl Allison in three years,

183
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,583
and what about that cooking class
you wanted to take in Italy?

184
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,875
I know. Why do you think
I'm so upset, Reesa?

185
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,393
You gotta start
putting yourself first.

186
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,709
You need to call this magazine,

187
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,267
tell them you're gonna be gone
for two weeks.

188
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,166
Ask them if they can push it
back.

189
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,083
And then, you and I
are gonna go to Italy,

190
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,875
and visit our girl.

191
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,709
You're gonna take that
Italian cooking class

192
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:35,542
and come back with new
Italian recipes

193
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,065
that are going to
blow his socks off.

194
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:39,667
That's the-that's what
I'm looking for.

195
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,208
That's not a bad idea.

196
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,041
Hashtag breakthrough.

197
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,500
Breakthrough!
Breakthrough!

198
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,685
We nailed it!
And I love you.

199
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,208
Oh my gosh, I love you, too.

Welcome home!

Come on, Allison!

216
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,083
I can't believe
you guys are really here.

217
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,333
I can't believe it either,
but you know what?

218
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:55,458
Italy looks good on you, girl.

219
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,709
I mean your hair, your clothes.

220
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:01,166
Allison: Have some wine.

221
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,333
Have some cheese.
Relax!

222
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,542
Let me have these.

223
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,959
Last time I held your hand
was 3 years ago.

224
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,792
Hmm. Yeah.

225
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,792
And I was just coming
out of surgery,

226
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:22,208
and you leaned over
and you whispered in my ear.

227
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,542
Now do you remember
what you told me?

228
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,166
I do. I said hurry up
and get well

229
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,875
so I can buy you a sexy dress,

230
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,417
and you can show off

231
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Both: your new girls.

232
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,250
- Listen.
- Yeah?

233
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,959
I know I've said it
time and time again

234
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:40,810
but I really appreciate you
calling me every day

235
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:42,959
to check on me.

236
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,542
But how are you?
You still good?

237
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:48,125
- I'm good.
- Okay.

238
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,601
As long as I keep
the stress away, you know?

239
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,208
And getting my regular checkups.

240
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,166
The doctor says
I will be just fine.

241
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,750
It is so good
to lay eyes on you.

242
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:03,125
You look amazing.
And your hair!

243
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,208
I know. I...

244
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,542
I'm so lucky.

245
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,625
You are.

246
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,458
I missed you.

247
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:13,792

00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,667
Can you believe this is
a university rental?

253
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,208
Do you honestly have to leave?

254
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,851
I mean, that's
the million-dollar question,

255
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,667
and yeah, I do.

256
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:40,166
Did you marinade these olives
in lemon juice

257
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,208
because they are
absolutely delicious.

258
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,059
Yes, I did. That's a trick
that Nico taught me.

259
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,750
Both: Oh, Nico!

260
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:48,994
Oh, I can't wait to meet him!

261
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,625
Same.

262
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:52,935
You got this incredible food,
this breathtaking view,

263
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,417
gorgeous house, and Nico.

264
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,917
Sounds like someone

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,226
is walking away
from a perfect life.

266
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,875
Oh, no, no, no.

267
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,476
I've had a perfect life
and one messy divorce.

268
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,917
And years of therapy later.

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,083
And I am not going back
down that road.

270
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,166
Yeah. But that was
North Carolina, Allison.

271
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,917
This is Italy!

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,542
Italy!!

273
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,625
Come on. It's no comparison.

274
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,333
I've been at A&T for 12 years.

275
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,458
Dr. Barnes would have a
conniption.

276
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:22,375
Plus, you know,
I don't have a job here.

277
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:25,500
So, get one,
and then send him a text

278
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,834
with this view and hashtag

279
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,583
sorry, not sorry.

280
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,458
Higher e ducation.

281
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:35,959
I mean, it's very competitive,
and uh,

282
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,333
but who's starting over
at our age?

283
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,542
Um...

284
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,041
I just retired. So, me?

285
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:46,083
Me too.

286
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,250
I mean, my restaurant
has only been open a year.

287
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,291
Okay, well... good for you.

288
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,041
But that's not me.

289
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,834
I mean, it's a nice thought,

290
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:57,750
but it doesn't make sense.

291
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,542
You know what would
make sense right now?

292
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,834
- More food.
- Yes.

293
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:03,333
We should go to that cafe.

294
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,817
The one you're always
talking about.

295
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,083
Melina: I love this cafe.
It's super cute.

296
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,625
Yeah.

297
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,017
I'm actually really feeling
your whole new vibe.

298
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,792
You're like the old Allison

299
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,291
because you are writing again!

300
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,125
Oh, yeah, I mean,

301
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,875
I wasn't writing for years,

302
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,500
but since I came here,

303
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,291
it's just been, you know,
flowing up.

304
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,291
Italy's good for you.

305
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,434
It's stirring up your passion.

306
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,125
Oh. That part.

307
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,583
Oh...

308
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:38,333
Oh, you know what?

309
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,542
Could you write some
creative blurbs for my menu?

310
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:42,959
Of course.
You know I've got you.

311
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,583
Um, how is the restaurant?

312
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,625
It's great!

313
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,959
Yeah. Reesa,
she comes all the time.

314
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,681
She'll tell you. It's great.
Right, Reesa?

315
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:52,375
Sure, yeah. It's one of
my favorite places.

316
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,333
Allison: Oh.

317
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,750
And how's retirement?

318
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,083
Oh. You know.

319
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,417
Knocking items off the bucket
list.

320
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,750
And spending more time with
Andre.

321
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:06,125
Oh. You don't sound
too happy about that.

322
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,333
We just haven't been
clicking lately.

323
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,834
We needed some time apart.

324
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:11,417
But I'm going to enjoy
these two weeks.

325
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,083
So, all good.

326
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,959
Okay. Well, I'm here
if you want to talk.

327
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,917
Oh, that's alright.

328
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,542
Oh! Dr. Di Grado just texted me

329
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,875
to come by his office. Um...

330
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,000
do you guys want to go by
the campus

331
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,792
before we go shopping?

332
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,434
Allison: I'm so impressed
with your Italian, Reesa.

333
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,750
You know, I've been trying.

334
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,834
I figure, when in Rome...

335
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,166
What? You know like
3 words, okay?

336
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,041
That's 3 words more
than you know.

337
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,500
That's true.

338
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,417
And this place? Oh my god.

339
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,583
Everywhere we go,

340
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,542
it feels like we're in
a postcard.

341
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,208
Right? Oh, I can see why
everyone falls in love here.

342
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,000
I mean, it's so romantic.

343
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,875
That's the library.
Books floor to ceiling.

344
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,583
Oh, the chapel, it's gorgeous.

345
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,375
I taught creative writing
in this building.

346
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,875
Four classes every day.

347
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,667
Whoa. Isn't that a lot?

348
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,834
You know,
it didn't seem like it.

349
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,893
Back home I taught two English
lit classes every day,

350
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:07,309
and analyzing structure
and grading papers

351
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,291
is far more time consuming.

352
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,250
Dr. Cooper, just who
I've been looking for.

353
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,041
- Buona sera.
- Buona sera.

354
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:13,583
I was just coming to see you.

355
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:16,333
Oh.

356
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,976
These are my friends visiting
from the United States.

357
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,458
Reesa and Melina.

358
00:15:20,542 --> 00:15:22,250
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

359
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,834
I won't take much of your time.

360
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,291
Can we talk?

361
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,166
Oh, sure.

362
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,500
- We'll be over here.
- Okay.

363
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,834
My colleagues and I
were so impressed with you

364
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:38,250
that we'd like to offer you
an opportunity

365
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,917
to teach your creative
writing class full time.

366
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,709
We are requesting you commit
for one year,

367
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,750
although we'd love
to have you longer.

368
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,194
The official offer will be
emailed.

369
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:56,166
Grazie. What an honor.

370
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,834
I understand that this is
a career adjustment,

371
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,517
but know there is lots
of room for growth.

372
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's good to know.

373
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,041
Um...

374
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,291
Do I have time
to think about it?

375
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,667
Sure. But the board meets
at the end of the day

376
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,542
on next Friday.

377
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,750
If we don't have an answer
by then,

378
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,750
we will move on
to another candidate.

379
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:22,291
No, no.
You will have an answer.

380
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,917
- Okay.
- Okay.

381
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,500
- Thank you.
- Grazie.

382
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,623
- Buona sera.
- Buona sera.

383
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,917
So, what are you going to do
about the offer?

384
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,518
Well, I have to talk
with the chancellor

385
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:41,417
before I can even consider it.

386
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,750
Hey. It's an amazing
opportunity.

387
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,226
Yeah, well, I don't want
to spend all day

388
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,375
talking about it.

389
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,226
I want to take you guys
to my favorite boutique.

390
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,709
You know, I was wondering

391
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,625
if we could just go look
for cookbooks instead.

392
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,393
Are you serious right now?
Cookbooks instead of couture?

393
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:59,000
What is going on with you?

394
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,417
Mm, you should see
the Old Macdonald overalls.

395
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,417
You used to have the best style!

396
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Whoa whoa. I had the best style.

397
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:07,792
I just didn't have the money.

398
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,625
No.

399
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,959
Okay, listen. It's fine.

400
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,458
I'm just not
into fashion anymore.

401
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,500
Okay? It's okay.

402
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,834
Yeah, but this is Italy.

403
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:20,709
Home to Gucci, and Prada,
and Fendi.

404
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:23,000
Listen, Allison.

405
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,125
I have other priorities right
now.

406
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,542
Not shopping.

407
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:28,893
And I don't
want to talk about it anymore.

408
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,125
I'm gonna look over here.

409
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,417
Oh, I didn't...

410
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,750
I've already tried.
Just let it go.

411
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:40,000
Ooh! This is so cute!

412
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,476
Sugar Ray would look
so adorable in this.

413
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,542
Sugar Ray.

414
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,208
You should see
the way I dress him.

415
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:48,041
People stop us and give me
compliments all the...

416
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,375
I should start
a doggy clothing line.

417
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,959
I can get all different fabrics.
I can make all these...

418
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,834
You know what?
I'm gonna do that.

419
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:56,959
I'm gonna start
a doggy clothing line,

420
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,041
But I need to order
a sewing machine.

421
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,625
Do you sew?

422
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:03,667
I do not. I'm adding that
to the bucket list.

423
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,667
- Oh.
- Mm.

424
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,625
Oh, I have missed that smell.

425
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,625
Homemade coconut chocolate chip.

426
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:19,750
Your favorite.

427
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,458
Mm-hmm.

428
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:22,542
Did you tell Nico yet?

429
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,625
No. I do not want any pressure

430
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:28,291
while making this decision.

431
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,625
Oh, pressure.

432
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,267
Like how you pressured me
to stay in the Marines?

433
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,458
I was looking at your big
picture.

434
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:35,935
You could have retired
as a Marine Corps Major.

435
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:36,976
Well, what about
your big picture?

436
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,458
Become a writer in Italy.

437
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:42,500
I think that means...
starting over,

438
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,625
lower pay, no tenure.

439
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,709
Well, actually, you know,

440
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,142
starting over
could be a good thing.

441
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:52,250
That's a good thing. That's a
pro.

442
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:55,041
Yeah. And from what
you've told us, Allison,

443
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,184
you and Nico, you seem to really
enjoy each other's company.

444
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,291
Meanwhile, Nico has a teenage
son

445
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:02,333
who you've grown fond of.

446
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,250
I will take that con and make
it pro.

447
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,542
Thanks.

448
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,834
This isn't helping.

449
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:11,583
That's because the answer
isn't on there.

450
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,834
It's in here.

451
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,458
You're real corny today.

452
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:17,709
It's actually here

453
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,017
'cause it's four pros
and three cons.

454
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,375
So that means the pros win.

455
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:21,875
- Oh!
- Nico: Ciao, Allison!

456
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:24,750
- That's Nico.
- Oh!

457
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:25,851
- Hey!! There he is!
- Nico: Ciao.

458
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,458
Nico!! Nice to meet you.

459
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,583
Nice to meet you too.

460
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,667
And I am Melina!

461
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:39,625
Mm. Allison would always
talk about you.

462
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,750
I could just hear her beaming
through the phone.

463
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,709
And now I know why.

464
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:44,792
Ah, beaming, huh?

465
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,750
Well...

466
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:53,542
I love this wine.

467
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,959
A wine connoisseur?

468
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,417
No. I wish.

469
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,875
I um, I just took some classes

470
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,542
so I could be
familiar with the wines

471
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,458
that we sell at my restaurant.

472
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:02,417
Ah yeah, you are the chef.

473
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,875
Yes.

474
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,125
I'd love for you
to sample my cheeses.

475
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,834
I see you say that
to all the ladies.

476
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,583
Nico: She found me out.

477
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,125
Melina: So,
how did you two meet?

478
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,768
Allison:
The second week after I arrived,

479
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,000
I went to the food market,

480
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,643
and I just happened to see
Nico's booth.

481
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:31,858
He offered me samples
of his cheese.

482
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:39,709
It was the best Pecorino
I had ever had.

483
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:43,375
I went back
and bought some more.

484
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,709
She claims she came back
for more cheese,

485
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,709
but what she really wanted
was my phone number.

486
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:53,083
And now she cannot
stay away from my cheese.

487
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,834
He's right. I even help out
at the booth sometimes.

488
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:58,166
Awwww. You're such
a good girlfriend.

489
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,333
What? Did I say something wrong?

490
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,625
Well, we both agreed

491
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:05,333
that since I'm only here
for a year,

492
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,208
we would just date.

493
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,208
So... we're not a couple.

494
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,250
What?

495
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,476
Well, I can call a duck a frog,

496
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,417
but it's still a duck.

497
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,226
And all I'm hearing from
the two of you right now

498
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,250
is quack! Quack!

499
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,917
Quack!

500
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Reesa!

501
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,208
Are you okay?

502
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,625
I'm fine, I just...

503
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,333
I was a week late,
so I thought...

504
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,000
You thought you were pregnant?

505
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:52,041
No. I just was hoping...

506
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,291
maybe.

507
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,417
I didn't know you were
trying to have a baby.

508
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,208
Why didn't you say anything?

509
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,583
Because of this.

510
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:03,458
People act all weird when
they know you're trying.

511
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:04,959
Okay. I won't act weird.

512
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,834
I promise.

513
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,417
I knew you couldn't help it.

514
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,458
You're already doing it.

515
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:14,291
We've been trying for a year,

516
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,667
and Andre really wants a family,
but I'm almost 40, so...

517
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,959
Okay, Janet Jackson was 50,
and she had a baby.

518
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,476
Janet Jackson is a gazillionaire
and a goddess.

519
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,208
True. But... so are you.

520
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:31,500
Thanks. You know what?

521
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,500
If it's meant to happen,
it will happen, right?

522
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,750
Melina: Yes!

523
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,726
At least in the meantime,
I can have one of these.

524
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,500
Reesa, I'm going to be an
auntie!

525
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:39,583
Oh god.

526
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:49,917
Hello.

527
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,083
Hi! Um, I'm Melina.

528
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,458
I guess we are cooking partners.

529
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,542
Lucas Williams.

530
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,542
Oh!

531
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,643
Sorry, it's what we do in
London.

532
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,375
I'm just here visiting.

533
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:03,542
Me too. I live in California.

534
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,625
Mm-hmm.

535
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:07,709
Let's see what we
are making today.

536
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,542
Ooh. Ricotta and artichoke
ravioli.

537
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:11,250
That sounds delicious.

538
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,291
Eh, ciao a tutti.

539
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,500
Welcome to Cooking with
Contaldo.

540
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,500
Find your table,

541
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:21,166
place on your aprons,

542
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,583
and let's start our food
adventure.

543
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:26,166
Alright.

544
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,166
You have to be
a little tough with it.

545
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,583
Okay.

546
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:46,250
Here, let me help you.

547
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,834
You want to take the dough,

548
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:51,709
and you want to use your heel,
the heel of your hand

549
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,625
to push it away from you.

550
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:56,583
And then,
you gradually add the flour.

551
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:57,667
Oh. Thanks.

552
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:04,458
You must have a lot
of experience with dough.

553
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:05,291
Bread is one of my
guilty pleasures.

554
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:08,667
At my restaurant,

555
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,917
we actually make our dough
from scratch.

556
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,680
Have you always wanted
to own a restaurant?

557
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:18,542
It's been a desire of mine,

558
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,417
and a health scare
a few years ago

559
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,458
finally made me pull the
trigger.

560
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,667
So, what's your favorite dish?

561
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,625
Well, everything's excellent.

562
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:31,417
No, um, I would say, oh,

563
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,518
the flatbread with
Shrimp and Romesco Sauce.

564
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:34,625
Okay.

565
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:37,250
Yours?

566
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,250
Well, my dad
started me in the kitchen

567
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,250
as soon as I was old enough
for trousers

568
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:43,166
so I have many.

569
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,542
But it has to be his brisket
patty melt cornbread sandwich.

570
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:53,375
Okay. You put the brisket
inside the cornbread?

571
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,698
And smother it in Swiss cheese.

572
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,333
Hmm. You know,
I can't believe it,

573
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:00,125
but that actually sounds
pretty good.

574
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:01,792
Mm-hmm.

575
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,208
Kneading is done.

576
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,834
Time to cover.

577
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,417
Alright.

578
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,375
Put it in here.

579
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,458
Good job.

580
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:15,333
I love roasting these with
lemons.

581
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:19,834
Yeah, but have you ever had
sunflower artichoke turnovers?

582
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:23,000
What? No.

583
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,083
Well, I have to admit
I'm obsessed with sunflowers.

584
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:27,709
I'm googling them all the time,

585
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,351
and one time this recipe just
popped up on my browser.

586
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,500
Uh-huh.

587
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,542
I've been eating them ever
since.

588
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:37,291
Well, you have to share
that recipe.

589
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:38,709
Maybe over dinner?

590
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,375
Well, um, my schedule
is kind of tight.

591
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:49,667
So I'm not really sure about
dinner,

592
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,834
but I will definitely
give you the recipe.

593
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:52,917
Fair enough.

594
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,834
Hi, pretty.

595
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,785
I'm going to send an email to
Dr. Barnes about staying.

596
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,976
Another year is not going to
make it easier to leave.

597
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,875
Shouldn't I just cut my losses?

598
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,839
No. Anything can happen
in a year. Just send it.

599
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,709
Fine.

600
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,583
Remember when I told you

601
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,810
that Italy looks really good
on you?

602
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:30,375
Yeah.

603
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:31,917
So, I've been thinking that

604
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,667
maybe that's what I need.

605
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,750
You like this place?

606
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,792
Are you gonna move here?

607
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:42,500
What does Andre say?

608
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:45,000
I haven't told him.

609
00:26:45,083 --> 00:26:46,458
I think I need some time alone

610
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:47,333
to just, just figure things out.

611
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,417
Reesa?

612
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,333
Are you serious?
What's there to figure out?

613
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:57,375
You know what? Nothing
that will get solved today.

614
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,625
Let's just, let's focus
on your email.

615
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:00,333
I actually have the perfect intro.
It, uh...

616
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:01,542
You ready?

617
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,083
Dear Dr. Barnes.

618
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,125
Peace out.

619
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,083
Oh.

620
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,208
That's Andre.

621
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:18,667
You should take that.

622
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,184
Don't tell him about the
apartment until you're sure.

623
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:22,000
Right.

624
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,709
Yes, Andre.

625
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,333
Yeah, um, I'm looking at
ten or so boxes

626
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,041
all addressed to you.

627
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,375
Baby, what is all this stuff?

628
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:35,959
I just ordered
some gardening tools,

629
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:37,166
and a small video camera.

630
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,375
And some exercise equipment

631
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,938
and canvases for our painting
classes.

632
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,166
And I also just ordered
a sewing machine,

633
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,792
but it's probably not there yet

634
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:47,500
because guess what?

635
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,333
I'm starting
a doggie clothing line.

636
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,000
A what?

637
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,458
A clothing line for dogs.

638
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,750
Where's Sugar Ray?

639
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:57,875
You know,
I haven't seen him in days.

640
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:00,166
Maybe he's trapped
behind all of these boxes.

641
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,625
Okay, that's not funny, Andre.

642
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:02,709
So, I'm requesting...

643
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:09,291
that I extend my international
teaching position another

644
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:13,709
additional two semesters

645
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:17,583
so that I may finish
my research on the matter.

646
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:22,542
Yours truly, Dr. Allison Cooper.

647
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,250
Finished!

648
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,333
Am I doing too much?

649
00:28:27,959 --> 00:28:30,458
Huh?

650
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,935
I was just talking to Andre
about my new interests.

651
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:33,792
Uh-huh.

652
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:34,458
And he said I was doing
Ôthe most'.

653
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:37,000
Well...

654
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,250
Well, what?

655
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:43,041
You do be experimenting a lot.

656
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,333
It's called a bucket list!

657
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:46,685
It's what you do when you
retire.

658
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,667
What else am I supposed to do?

659
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,083
Okay, don't get salty with me.
You asked me.

660
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:52,886
This apartment
is looking better and better.

661
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,083
Send it. Just send it.

662
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,709
Reesa: Just send it!

663
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,905
Please don't let me lose my job.

664
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,166
Joseph Tate, the food critic

665
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,083
will visit Tapas next Monday.

666
00:29:23,166 --> 00:29:25,291
You couldn't push it back?

667
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,542
Well, they said yes,
but apparently no.

668
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,709
I've gotta go back home.

669
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:32,542
No. You can't.

670
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,351
Eileen is still the manager, right?
Let her do it.

671
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,834
Eileen quit.

672
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:38,250
She wanted a raise,

673
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:39,559
and I couldn't afford to give
her one.

674
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,959
So who's the manager?

675
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,417
This new guy, Edward,

676
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,083
who I do not trust yet.

677
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,667
Okay, you know what, Mr. Tate,

678
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,583
he doesn't come until Monday,

679
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:50,542
so I'll just fly back on Friday.

680
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:52,500
Allison, she'll just
have to understand.

681
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,542
Buongiorno!

682
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:57,208
Both: Good morning! Hi!

683
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,917
Hey. What's going on?

684
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,959
Oh, nothing.

685
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,583
I was just about
to leave for class.

686
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,542
We are going
to the spice market today.

687
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,291
You know what, I'm running late.

688
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:09,709
So, I'm just gonna meet you guys

689
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:10,041
at the vineyard later, okay?
Bye for now!

690
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,125
Bye.

691
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:15,875
Well, hi. You look great.

692
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,083
No reply from Dr. Barnes.

693
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,291
I hope I didn't upset him.

694
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,500
You just sent the email.
Give him some time.

695
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,542
He's got you so shook.

696
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,083
I'm not used to seeing you
like this.

697
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,166
He's the chancellor.
He has a lot of power.

698
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,333
And I am this close
to getting tenured.

699
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:34,059
Okay, you are overthinking
this whole thing.

700
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,542
You need to calm down.

701
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,166
And we need
to take your mind off it.

702
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,625
Why don't we
do one of your cool posts?

703
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,226
You can speak, and I'll be your
background dancer.

704
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,834
We can put it on Tik Tok.

705
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:46,375
Uh, no. We're not doing that.

706
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,250
What about this?

707
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:50,375
No. No. And aren't we
too old for Tik Tok?

708
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,125
We can ride Vespas.

709
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:54,834
I am not getting on a Vespa.

710
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:56,559
Take your life
into your hands if you want to.

711
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:59,208
Okay, you're just as bad
as Andre.

712
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:01,458
Okay.

713
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:04,250
Are you ready to talk about him?

714
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:07,750
Sure. He criticizes
everything that I do.

715
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,667
I planned this whole list
of stuff for us,

716
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,625
and he doesn't want to do
any of it.

717
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:13,792
He doesn't want to spend time
with me.

718
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:16,959
And that doesn't feel good.

719
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,241
Reesa, I know Andre loves you.

720
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,142
You need to tell him
how you feel, Reesa.

721
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,875
Yeah, it's fine.
And I'm fine.

722
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:27,041
No. Reesa...

723
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,165
Seriously, why don't we just
do this video. Come on.

724
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:42,417
I mean, look at this fruit.
It's all so fresh.

725
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,875
Yes.

726
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,875
Yeah. Look at this.

727
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:48,417
You know, being here

728
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,792
makes me want to try
all new kinds of recipes.

729
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,667
My dad would love this place.

730
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,458
He's a chef too, you know.

731
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:57,643
We hoped my daughter Noelle
would've followed in our footsteps.

732
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,875
But not even a chance.

733
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,458
She wants to be a makeup artist.

734
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:05,125
Oh, she's beautiful.

735
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,583
It's been just the two of us
for the last ten years

736
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:09,959
since my wife passed.

737
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:12,583
She's my baby
even though she's turning 21.

738
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:13,583
I see you. Proud papa.

739
00:32:13,667 --> 00:32:15,667
Mm-hmm.

740
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,834
Well, you know,
I'm really glad I came.

741
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,333
I needed this break.

742
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,583
And I had fun yesterday.

743
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:25,375
Me too.

744
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,458
I guess we should see what
we need to buy for class.

745
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:30,375
Oh, look. Spices.

746
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:33,250
And here we are.

747
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:36,166
Yeah, me too, but...

748
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,917
mine are different from yours,

749
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,184
and I haven't used
half of these.

750
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,500
Oh, wow.

751
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:43,226
I used to love experimenting
with different spices.

752
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,667
But owning a restaurant

753
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,190
gives you limited time
to experiment.

754
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,709
Okay, so what if I
challenged you today?

755
00:32:57,917 --> 00:32:59,750
Get all the things on our cards.

756
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:02,458
Mm-hmm.

757
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,935
And buy three more spices
you've never used.

758
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:04,792
Challenge accepted.

759
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,500
Okay.

760
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,875
And you know what?

761
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,750
I actually see sage over here
which is on my list.

762
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:14,875
Sage. Fresh sage.

763
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,417
Which means one down.

764
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,458
Five more to go.

765
00:33:18,542 --> 00:33:20,667
Whoa whoa whoa.
Hold on. Hold on.

766
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,500
The first one to six,
to get all six spices

767
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,834
takes the other one to dinner.

768
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,750
Um, sorry, but is that your way

769
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:32,309
of trying to ask me out
on a date again?

770
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:36,166
Well, only if you're saying yes.

771
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,959
Well, I'm already
one spice ahead of you,

772
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:42,041
so you better hurry up.

773
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:47,166
Oh, and look at that.
I have two.

774
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:47,792
Just what I was looking for.
That is on my list.

775
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,667
Oh, come on.

776
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,750
I'll have this please.

777
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,583
This region has a history
of over 1000 years.

778
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:01,166
This vineyard was a Etruscan
and Roman settlement.

779
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,850
And we will be having
our tasting inside.

780
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,792
You've been on your phone
all day.

781
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:11,834
Are you going to tell me
what's going on?

782
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,417
Oh, nothing. I just had to
handle some work stuff.

783
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,250
- I'll put it away. Sorry.
- That's okay.

784
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,333
Okay. Let's go.

785
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,542
You know, wine tasting
is really not that hard.

786
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,834
But every little step counts.

787
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,959
The way that I learned it

788
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,875
was at first
you swirl the wine around

789
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,017
in your glass just like that.
Yeah.

790
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,250
Maybe a little bit more.

791
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,083
And then you have to smell it
before you taste it.

792
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:36,667
Because the smell
is connected to the taste.

793
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,000
It's called old factory.

794
00:34:39,083 --> 00:34:41,000
Hold it up to the light,

795
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,226
you can see the depth
of the wine.

796
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,309
It's got this crimson color.

797
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,166
Here's how I figured it.

798
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,291
- Alli.
- Hi.

799
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,917
This is my cousin Mario.

800
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,750
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi.

801
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:51,542
His lovely wife, Emilia.

802
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,291
Hi.

803
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,417
And this is my Allison.

804
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,417
- Hi. Oh.
- Oh!

805
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,166
We've been traveling
so much this year,

806
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,583
but finally, we get to meet you.

807
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,667
Nico, she's beautiful.

808
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,875
Nico: I know.

809
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:09,709
Oh, well, your vineyard
is gorgeous.

810
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:11,059
You have to come back
in September

811
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,917
when we do our grape stomping.

812
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,184
Right. There's nothing
more romantic

813
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,917
than getting
in a barrel of grapes

814
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,083
and making wine together.

815
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,041
Hopefully, she'll still be here.

816
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,417
What?

817
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,041
Well, I have a job. Teaching
job back in the states.

818
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:25,351
So I may not be able
to come back.

819
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,250
- Oh.
- No. Look at you two.

820
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,250
I have to see more of this.

821
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,709
You can't go.

822
00:35:31,792 --> 00:35:33,184
You'll be at the hunt
tomorrow, yeah?

823
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,625
Yeah.

824
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:37,375
Uh, yeah.

825
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:40,417
Yes. And we will talk more about
this leaving nonsense.

826
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,208
- Good idea.
- Alright.

827
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,458
- Enjoy!
- Ciao!

828
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,542
- Ciao!
- Ciao!

829
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:48,625
My mom can't wait to meet you.

830
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:51,500
Nico...

831
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,263
I am more nervous
about meeting your mother

832
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:55,291
than I was about meeting
Lorenzo.

833
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,750
Oh, no. She's harmless.

834
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:58,935
Invite Reesa and Melina too
if you want.

835
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:01,250
Everyone is welcome.

836
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:04,333
Yeah, I will.
Um, have you seen Melina?

837
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:06,709
No. Not since she
stepped out before.

838
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:07,792
I'll be right back.

839
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,875
Tell the chef to create
a limited menu

840
00:36:11,959 --> 00:36:14,125
with the dishes that I texted
you.

841
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,142
Just please make sure we have
all of the ingredients, okay?

842
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,667
My flight lands Saturday night.

843
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:21,959
Hey. I've been looking for you.

844
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:24,166
Oh, um, yeah, Edward.

845
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,750
Thanks for checking in, okay?

846
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:27,709
And please call me
if you need anything, alright?

847
00:36:27,792 --> 00:36:30,250
Okay, bye.

848
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:33,083
Whew! Restaurant business.

849
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:35,333
You know it's always something.

850
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:36,667
What's up?

851
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,750
You tell me.

852
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:42,250
I have to leave on Friday.

853
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,709
What? Why?

854
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:46,709
The Taste of the Town critic

855
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:48,542
is coming for dinner
on Monday night,

856
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,875
and I just wanna make sure
everything's right.

857
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,199
Girl, you're the boss.
Delegate.

858
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:55,542
Well, look, if I'm not there,

859
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:57,542
I could get a bad review.

860
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,500
And anything less than 5 stars
could sink me.

861
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,583
There you ladies are.

862
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,458
I just bought a book

863
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:05,000
on how to become a sommelier!

864
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,208
Not right now, Reesa.

865
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,834
The Melina I know

866
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:09,291
would have already
bought a frame

867
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,542
for her 5-star review.

868
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:14,625
Yeah, well, that Melina was
na•ve.

869
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:16,583
And this Melina
has been through a lot.

870
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,333
No, no, no. I know.
I understand.

871
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,375
No, you do not understand,
Allison.

872
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:26,041
Listen, Tapas is the only thing
that I have,

873
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,245
and it has to be successful.

874
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,542
I mean, I put
my blood, sweat and tears

875
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,083
into that restaurant, okay?

876
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:34,643
And if I get a bad review
in that magazine,

877
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:35,667
I could lose everything.

878
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh, my gosh.

879
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:43,083
I'm changing my flight,
and that's that, so just...

880
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:08,375
Allison: What do you even wear
to a truffle hunt anyway?

881
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,458
You haven't mentioned Melina
all morning.

882
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:13,083
Melina's leaving.
What is there to say?

883
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,083
You could be more supportive.

884
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:17,458
She doesn't always confide in
me.

885
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,142
It's hard to support
what I don't understand.

886
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:20,917
You know
you should talk to her, right?

887
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,518
She's always wanted to impress
you. You know that.

888
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,875
She doesn't have to do that.
I'm her friend.

889
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,291
A friend with high expectations.

890
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:30,291
Oh. Well.

891
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,250
What is that supposed to mean?

892
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:35,853
Okay, look,
you were disappointed in me

893
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,317
when I didn't go for that
promotion.

894
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,559
I want the best
for the people I care about.

895
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,458
What's wrong with that?

896
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:43,142
It just doesn't leave
a lot of room for error.

897
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:45,208
To be fair,

898
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,434
Melina isn't always honest
with me,

899
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:48,041
so, I was blindsided

900
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,500
when she said she was leaving.

901
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,417
Yes. I... I know.

902
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:54,625
What?

903
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:59,750
- Tapas is not doing well.
- What?

904
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:00,625
And she doesn't want you
to know.

905
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:03,291
Why?

906
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,291
Because you're...
Because you're judgy.

907
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:07,083
Ish.

908
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,959
Okay, first I have high
expectations,

909
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,434
and now I'm judgy?
Thanks a lot, Reesa.

910
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:15,250
No... I. Look I'm just trying
to clear the air.

911
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,476
So that we can enjoy
the last few days

912
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,917
that Melina is here.

913
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,768
And I made an appointment
to see that apartment.

914
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,917
Do not...

915
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,083
say a word.

916
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:27,166
Okay.

917
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,630
That's what you should wear
to the truffle hunt.

918
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,583
He adores you.

919
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:44,583
- How are you?
- Good.

920
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,417
Hello, Reesa.

921
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,709
Mama. May I present Allison.

922
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:56,083
Alli, mama.

923
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:57,291
Oh, charmed!

924
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,083
And her friend Reesa.

925
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,166
Nice to meet you. Oh!

926
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,500
Lorenzo.

927
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:08,375
- Ah!
- Reesa.

928
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:09,917
- Nice to meet you!
- Hello.

929
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,291
Lorenzo!

930
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,250
Would you show our guest around?

931
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,125
Of course.

932
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,792
- Thank you.
- Okay.

933
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,792
You make my son very happy,

934
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,500
and that makes me very happy.

935
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,125
Oh...

936
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,417
Bambini venete.

937
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,625
Andiamo.

938
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,417
What?

939
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Uh, Melina's coming from class,

940
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,583
so she's gonna be a little late.

941
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:39,041
No worries, Alli.
We're in Italy.

942
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,125
We don't have schedules.

943
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,583
Oh, that's right.

944
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:45,375
You know, I knew
I'd learn a lot in our class,

945
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,000
but I had no idea
it would be this much fun.

946
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,959
Well, Chef is very entertaining,

947
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:53,208
and you, my dear,

948
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:54,371
how do we say, um, blinding.

949
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,000
Well, I hope ÒblindingÓ
means something good.

950
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,375
How would you say?

951
00:41:03,458 --> 00:41:04,643
I think in America you guys say,

952
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:05,747
something like uh, awesome?

953
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:09,917
Yeah, you're right.
I am pretty blinding.

954
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:16,375
But that's only because my
partner is blinding too.

955
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,750
Hmm. So let's keep that going.

956
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:21,291
Okay.

957
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:24,000
And take a look over there.

958
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,333
Sunflowers!

959
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,917
- It is.
- Oh my gosh! Look!

960
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,291
No more excuses.

961
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,417
I need to taste
those sunflower artichokes.

962
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,417
Oh!

963
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,041
How can you not love these
flowers?

964
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,792
I mean, look, they stand so
tall.

965
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,417
And no matter the weather,

966
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,700
they always find the sunlight.

967
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,500
I love Ôem!

968
00:42:00,917 --> 00:42:03,000
Everybody here is so welcoming.

969
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,417
You're making it so hard
for me to leave.

970
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,667
Nothing more from your school?

971
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:11,208
Oh, Dr. Barnes replied
right before I came here.

972
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:12,667
He's calling me at 8:30 our
time.

973
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:15,041
Hoping for good news.

974
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:21,792
I was thinking

975
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,768
that we could go to Sanducci
at the end of the month.

976
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:26,041
Hmm.

977
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:27,542
I could show you
where I was born,

978
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:28,810
and you could meet
more of my family.

979
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:32,291
I...

980
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:34,518
I know there is a possibility
that you are still leaving, but...

981
00:42:34,542 --> 00:42:37,625
So, should we keep
getting closer

982
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:38,125
when there's that chance?

983
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:41,667
Okay, but...

984
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:46,583
Yes. Of course I am.

985
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:50,601
There is a saying
that I hold very dear.

986
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:53,166
And it's uh,

987
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,208
Non rimpiangere mai cié

988
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:58,291
che ti ha fatto sorridere.

989
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,375
Uh...

990
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:04,041
Never regret anything
that made you smile.

991
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:05,583
Exactly.

992
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:10,625
I-oh. Ooh. Sorry.

993
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:13,000
I was just,
I was doing a cheese tour,

994
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,226
and I came to tell you
I tasted your Pecorino.

995
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,125
It changed my life.

996
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,583
Meet the ones responsible.

997
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:21,542
This is Lua, Lia, Gia, and Emma.

998
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,291
Ladies, this is Reesa.

999
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:25,959
Oh, well, I won't
remember your names,

1000
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:27,458
but nice to meet you, ladies.

1001
00:43:27,542 --> 00:43:30,667
These are his real girlfriends.

1002
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,792
I'm going to start
gathering the group

1003
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:34,017
so we can be ready
when Melina arrives, okay?

1004
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,583
Oh, okay.

1005
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:36,667
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

1006
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:41,375
Everyone here is so chill.

1007
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,851
We were supposed to start
an hour ago.

1008
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:44,226
Yeah, they don't care
about that here.

1009
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,917
Well, that would drive me crazy,

1010
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,917
but um, you seem to be adapting

1011
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,226
to the laid-back farm life
pretty well.

1012
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,500
You know, months ago,

1013
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:54,542
I had this really stressful day,

1014
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:56,583
and Nico brought me here.

1015
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,685
He told me thirty minutes
with the animals,

1016
00:43:57,709 --> 00:43:59,417
and I would forget everything.

1017
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,417
And he was right.
Emma is my favorite. Hi!

1018
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,208
Oh, you got a favorite sheep?
Come on.

1019
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,166
- Look who I found.
- I made it.

1020
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,875
So, meet Rosaria and Eve, our
guide.

1021
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:13,917
We let them roam,
and when you see them

1022
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,750
stop and start to dig,

1023
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:17,542
they've probably
found a truffle.

1024
00:44:17,625 --> 00:44:19,834
Hurry to the spot and grab it

1025
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:22,792
before they run off with it.
That's so simple.

1026
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:24,792
Nico: You know the rules,

1027
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:25,893
the team with the least amount
of truffles

1028
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:27,834
has to cook dinner.

1029
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:28,709
Tour guide:
Good luck, everybody!

1030
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,000
Alright!

1031
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:51,417
Yay! Ohh!

1032
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:07,893
I hope you're not disappointed
that we lost.

1033
00:45:07,917 --> 00:45:11,000
I lose every year.

1034
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,917
I prefer to make dinner.

1035
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,709
Lucky me, this year
both of my ladies are cooking.

1036
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:24,041
Truffles are very interesting.

1037
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:26,083
I call them the food of love.

1038
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:29,125
First...

1039
00:45:29,208 --> 00:45:32,792
they take a lot of patience
to really mature.

1040
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:35,458
Second. They require a partner.

1041
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:39,166
A partner?

1042
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,333
Yes.

1043
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:47,041
Without the tree's root
nourishing the soil,

1044
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,165
the truffle will die. Hmm.

1045
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,041
This is ready to go?

1046
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:55,959
Uh, yes.

1047
00:45:57,917 --> 00:46:00,667
Everything is done.

1048
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,959
Great. Dinner's ready,
everybody!

1049
00:46:07,709 --> 00:46:10,333
There's one more comparison.

1050
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:14,500
Uh... I've forgotten,
but it will come.

1051
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,125
This chicken is amazing.

1052
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:34,041
Oh, yes. I remember now.

1053
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,166
Truffles are like love

1054
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,792
because they are easy
to overlook.

1055
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:42,792
You could be standing
right on top

1056
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:45,166
of one of nature's precious
diamonds

1057
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,166
and not even realize it

1058
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:51,917
because you are not looking
in the right place.

1059
00:46:56,417 --> 00:46:57,417
You need anything?

1060
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,333
Yeah, I'm just enjoying...

1061
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:04,500
your family,

1062
00:47:04,583 --> 00:47:07,792
and... my friends.

1063
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,417
And you.

1064
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,417
This moment is... perfecto.

1065
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:23,125
Oh. I gotta go do my call.

1066
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:24,208
Fingers crossed.

1067
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,125
Hi, Chancellor.

1068
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:48,959
It's good to see you.

1069
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:51,625
Dr. Cooper, good to see you.

1070
00:47:51,709 --> 00:47:53,518
It's wonderful to hear
things are going well there.

1071
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:56,792
We at North Carolina A&T

1072
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,792
want to always leave
a great impression.

1073
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,291
Well, Dr. Di Grado and his team

1074
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:04,458
are very impressed
with my creative writing class,

1075
00:48:04,542 --> 00:48:07,709
so uh, they have asked me
to stay another year.

1076
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:10,458
Of course, they do,
you're one of our brightest.

1077
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:12,834
The board and I have
discussed the position there,

1078
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:14,237
but we feel
there's a greater need

1079
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,351
for you here on our campus.

1080
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,375
Okay.

1081
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:21,291
As Chair of the English
Department.

1082
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:25,166
I'm sorry. What?

1083
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:28,458
Dr. Ghazi is retiring early
for personal reasons,

1084
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:32,000
and he has endorsed you as a
candidate for his position.

1085
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,226
You will need to have
an interview with the board,

1086
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,875
but it's just a formality.

1087
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:38,333
You have my full recommendation,

1088
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:41,417
and I couldn't be more proud
to give you this standing.

1089
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,041
This will also secure your
tenure.

1090
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,125
Oh, wow.

1091
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,125
This is incredible.

1092
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:55,166
I will email you
the interview time.

1093
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,625
Right afterwards, I'll need
you back in the office.

1094
00:48:57,709 --> 00:48:58,709
Uh, right afterwards?

1095
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:02,625
Say, three weeks?

1096
00:49:02,709 --> 00:49:05,333
Congratulations, Dr. Cooper.

1097
00:49:05,417 --> 00:49:06,417
See you soon.

1098
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:13,208
♪ Give a little more space

1099
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:17,125
♪ Come a little closer

1100
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:19,048
I can't believe somebody.
You better slow down.

1101
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:24,750
Oh! Oh! Wasn't that
worth the climb, guys?

1102
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:27,083
Not worth it.

1103
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:28,917
Okay. Am I the only one
who's light-headed?

1104
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,875
Oh, oh!

1105
00:49:30,959 --> 00:49:31,709
Come here, honey.
Come sit down.

1106
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:33,667
Okay.

1107
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,667
Rest here for a minute.
Come on.

1108
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,125
I'm just glad that you
and Ree made up.

1109
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,125
I was not feeling that weird
energy.

1110
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:43,750
- I wasn't mad.
- It wasn't weird.

1111
00:49:43,834 --> 00:49:45,810
Why were you up so early moving
around this morning?

1112
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:48,125
Actually I was up late
fussing with Andre.

1113
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:50,125
He's refusing to take
the painting class,

1114
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:52,542
and then he had the nerve
to tell me I need therapy.

1115
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:53,893
He knows good and well
I do not do therapy.

1116
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:56,083
I take my problems to the altar.

1117
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:58,250
The altars don't have PhDs
though.

1118
00:49:58,333 --> 00:49:59,733
- You keep playing with him.
- Okay.

1119
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,709
Are you good?

1120
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,125
Last night I was offered the
chair

1121
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:06,667
of the English department
at A&T.

1122
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,625
What?

1123
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:10,291
Congratulations!

1124
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,917
Yeah, I didn't mention it

1125
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,917
because I just wanted
to enjoy our time together.

1126
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,166
Look. It's just a test. Stay.

1127
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,709
It's a big salary leap.

1128
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:19,583
Guarantees my job until
retirement.

1129
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:22,125
Staying is too big of a risk.

1130
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:22,834
There's nothing wrong
with taking risks.

1131
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:25,583
Risks.

1132
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:27,147
Like apartment hunting alone
in Italy.

1133
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:31,709
Oh, what apartment?

1134
00:50:31,792 --> 00:50:33,542
Okay, does Andre know?

1135
00:50:33,625 --> 00:50:34,125
- He...
- What about the baby?

1136
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:38,625
A baby?

1137
00:50:38,709 --> 00:50:39,976
Okay, see, this is why I don't
say anything to you.

1138
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,559
Because I knew you were
gonna freak out.

1139
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:42,959
Yeah, of course I'm freaking
out.

1140
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,291
You're leaving your husband.

1141
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,792
And you're having a baby?

1142
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,458
No! And I am not leaving Andre.

1143
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:49,375
An apartment in Italy
sounds like you're leaving.

1144
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:53,250
Okay.

1145
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,333
How come you couldn't tell me
you were so unhappy?

1146
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:56,709
This cannot be happening.

1147
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:59,458
I am not unhappy!

1148
00:50:59,542 --> 00:51:00,542
I'm dispirited!

1149
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:04,125
Dispirited?

1150
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:05,309
I've been doing
a lot of crosswords.

1151
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,458
Ma'am, a baby?

1152
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:08,935
We've been trying,
it hasn't been working,

1153
00:51:08,959 --> 00:51:10,959
and I need a break from it all.

1154
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:12,726
And if you'd just stay,
I could live with you.

1155
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:17,000
Reesa. You need to talk
to your husband.

1156
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:18,601
When did we start
keeping all these secrets?

1157
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:19,625
I can't.

1158
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:24,458
Take a pretty picture!

1159
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:25,792
Reesa. Whoa!

1160
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:34,000
Reesa, look I'm not mad
at you, alright?

1161
00:51:34,083 --> 00:51:35,559
I just wish you would've told
me about the apartment.

1162
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:36,834
That's all.

1163
00:51:36,917 --> 00:51:39,333
It's not that.

1164
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:41,559
Allison is on her way to tell
Dr. Digrado she's leaving.

1165
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:44,375
It's a mistake.

1166
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:48,500
I agree. But I don't want to
press her on this, okay?

1167
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:50,623
I mean, this trip has already
been a roller coaster.

1168
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:54,226
Allison said we've been keeping
secrets, and she's right.

1169
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,667
What happened to us?

1170
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,291
We used to tell each other
everything,

1171
00:51:57,375 --> 00:51:58,375
and now we don't.

1172
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:02,514
Well, here's something
that you don't know.

1173
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,375
Lucas asked me to dinner.

1174
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,458
Twice.

1175
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:10,542
And why haven't you gone?

1176
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,417
You know what?
I'm texting him.

1177
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,750
- No!
- Yes.

1178
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:18,083
Oh, come on.

1179
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:19,309
You know I haven't been out
with anyone,

1180
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:21,667
you know,
since before I got sick.

1181
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:24,083
Look, if you mess up the date,
so what?

1182
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:26,086
After this week,
you never have to see him again.

1183
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,709
Even if I did want to go,

1184
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:32,142
it's not like I have
anything to wear.

1185
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:33,917
Uh, we can fix that.
I'm calling Allison.

1186
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000

take a picture.

00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:00,458
you said that was your dream.

1242
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:02,458
But I had to put it aside

1243
00:55:02,542 --> 00:55:03,935
to pay for my
ex-husband Lionel's law school.

1244
00:55:03,959 --> 00:55:06,792
When he left us, I had nothing.

1245
00:55:06,875 --> 00:55:08,458
I had to go back to work.

1246
00:55:08,542 --> 00:55:10,542
I had to go back to school.

1247
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:13,792
And I vowed I would
take care of me and mine.

1248
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:17,125
You're not gonna
understand this, Nico.

1249
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,333
But when you're a Black woman,

1250
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:22,500
it takes extra clawing and
scratching,

1251
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,263
and many sleepless nights
just to get here.

1252
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,375
And I cannot sacrifice that
for anything.

1253
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:32,458
Or anyone.

1254
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:37,834
You're right.

1255
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,917
I will never understand
what you have been through.

1256
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:48,250
But we deserve a chance, Alli.

1257
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:51,834
Your dream deserves a chance.

1258
00:55:51,917 --> 00:55:53,597
I just want to enjoy
the time we have left.

1259
00:55:54,083 --> 00:55:56,208
But I'm not staying here.

1260
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:57,291
I can't.

1261
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:04,375
Okay.

1262
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:21,291
Thank you.

1263
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:25,709
I see you hot mama.

1264
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:28,875
I needed that makeover, okay?

1265
00:56:28,959 --> 00:56:31,083
Thank you.

1266
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:33,417
How was your date?

1267
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,166
He ordered a bunch
of different appetizers

1268
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,559
to help me find new recipes
for Tapas.

1269
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:38,875
He's so sweet.

1270
00:56:38,959 --> 00:56:40,875
I know!

1271
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,041
But did you kiss him?

1272
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:44,000
Well...

1273
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:46,875
I knew it! I knew it!

1274
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:52,583
I'm so sorry I was tripping
about you leaving.

1275
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:54,125
Life happens.

1276
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:56,875
I get it.

1277
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,083
So, you're definitely taking
that job back home?

1278
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:03,208
Oh, yeah.

1279
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:05,542
I meet with the board today.

1280
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:09,625
Well, as long as you are doing
what you...

1281
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:11,917
think is best.

1282
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,291
I am.

1283
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:14,917
And uh...

1284
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:19,959
I think we should get breakfast

1285
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:22,250
before we go to the museum.

1286
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:24,542
I'm gonna tell Andre
about the apartment today.

1287
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:26,500
And we should probably get
mimosas.

1288
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:36,166
I can't believe you
actually have a lease.

1289
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,667
It's just six months.

1290
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,625
Plus I'm signing up
for painting classes,

1291
00:57:39,709 --> 00:57:41,375
wine making, cheese making.

1292
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,375
Wow. You're going to be
so busy,

1293
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,000
you won't have time to miss Dre.

1294
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,250
That's the point.

1295
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:47,125
No.

1296
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:49,625
It's not the point, okay?

1297
00:57:49,709 --> 00:57:51,142
You are supposed to miss him,
right, Allison?

1298
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:53,625
I'm sorry, what?

1299
00:57:53,709 --> 00:57:56,458
Dr. Barnes is sending me
department requirements.

1300
00:57:56,542 --> 00:57:59,291
It's like I've already started
working.

1301
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,000
Wait. What are you gonna do

1302
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:01,959
if Andre says
you can't move to Italy?

1303
00:58:02,041 --> 00:58:04,250
He wouldn't.

1304
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:05,393
I think he'll be relieved
to have me out his hair.

1305
00:58:05,417 --> 00:58:06,959
Well, when you do talk to him,

1306
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:08,500
try not to be defensive.

1307
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:11,000
Okay, listen more.

1308
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:12,959
Okay, ladies. This is my
eat, pray, reset time.

1309
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:15,875
Okay?

1310
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,000
What did Dr. Di Grado say
when you turned him down?

1311
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:20,792
He said that my loyalty is
admirable.

1312
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:24,667
And um, he gave me these letters
my students wrote me.

1313
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,470
They're choosing another
candidate tomorrow.

1314
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:32,625
Oh, wow, look at this one.

1315
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,750
ÒDr. Cooper's
creative writing class

1316
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:37,125
Òis not only analytical,
but it's also

1317
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:39,834
Òtherapeutic. She allowed me

1318
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,837
Òto tap into parts of my psyche
that I'd buried.Ó

1319
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:46,041
Oh. ÒI will forever be
a better communicator

1320
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:48,875
Òand writer because of her.Ó
Allison.

1321
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,583
This is so sweet.

1322
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:51,583
Have you looked at these?

1323
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:53,709
A few of them. Yeah.

1324
00:58:53,792 --> 00:58:55,312
I'm sure Allison
gets letters like this

1325
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,375
from all of her students.

1326
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:58,625
I don't. Actually.

1327
00:58:58,709 --> 00:59:00,417
I just had a connection
with these students

1328
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,875
and what we were doing.

1329
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:04,083
When you get back home,

1330
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,125
I hope that you keep writing.

1331
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:08,291
Finish that book you started.

1332
00:59:08,375 --> 00:59:10,917
Reesa: Yeah. You can make time.

1333
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,083
You know, I think if I
were meant to be an author,

1334
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,375
I would already have a book.

1335
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:19,500
So, as it stands,

1336
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:22,667
I am Dr. Allison Cooper.

1337
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,625
Tenured Chair
of the English department.

1338
00:59:24,709 --> 00:59:27,000
Enough said.

1339
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:29,041
Congratulations.

1340
00:59:29,125 --> 00:59:30,125
Thanks.

1341
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:38,583
Melina: This is interesting.

1342
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:39,542
Reesa: You know what else
is interesting?

1343
00:59:39,625 --> 00:59:42,917
I found a meditation class.

1344
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,792
The brochure said
it was life changing.

1345
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:48,667
Yeah. Meditation is great
for mental clarity.

1346
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:49,750
Yeah, I...

1347
00:59:52,917 --> 00:59:55,917
Hey. I know you've already
been here with Nico,

1348
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,166
but you can pretend
to want to be here with us.

1349
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,393
Sorry. Work keeps texting me.

1350
00:59:59,417 --> 01:00:01,750
I get it.

1351
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:03,709
We just kind of
want you to hang out with us.

1352
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:06,917
Yeah. Come on, Allison.

1353
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,125
You know it's my last day here.

1354
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,518
Well, you cut your trip short
so...

1355
01:00:10,542 --> 01:00:12,917
Ew, shade.

1356
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
No, I thought you said
you weren't upset with me?

1357
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:15,542
I'm not. But don't make me
feel guilty for working.

1358
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:17,959
That was Reesa.

1359
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:19,917
You're not going to be happy
when you go back.

1360
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,166
Reesa, I have
a prestigious promotion,

1361
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,125
and a corner office.

1362
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:26,291
So. You're only taking the job

1363
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,810
because you're scared
to take a risk.

1364
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,834
Stop faking the funk.

1365
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:30,792
You should stay here, right,
Melina?

1366
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,583
Only if she wants to.

1367
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:34,834
Are we doing this right now?

1368
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:37,959
Yes. You are scared
to take a chance with Nico

1369
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:39,851
because of everything
that happened with Lionel.

1370
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:43,417
I mean, come on, Nico,
he's a good guy.

1371
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,220
Thank you. And you guys
look great together.

1372
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,250
And he treats you with respect.

1373
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:48,959
Okay, so you're staging
an intervention.

1374
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:50,667
- That is not...
- No, no, no. We are not.

1375
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:51,870
We are not, you know, but...

1376
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:57,667
Okay, okay, guys, guys!

1377
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,417
Stop, stop.
Listen, Allison.

1378
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,000
This isn't about Nico.

1379
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:04,834
Look, you're happy here.

1380
01:01:04,917 --> 01:01:07,625
I can't follow every whim
that makes me happy.

1381
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:09,583
Staying here does not make
sense.

1382
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:12,291
I don't know any other way
to say it to you.

1383
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:13,434
I just want you to be honest
with yourself.

1384
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:16,542
Honest? Really?

1385
01:01:16,625 --> 01:01:18,017
I think that's the pot
calling the kettle black

1386
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,792
because you two
have not been honest with me

1387
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,500
since you've been here.

1388
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:23,083
How have I not been honest?

1389
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:25,166
Yeah, what do you mean you two?

1390
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,050
Reesa told me
that your business is crumbling.

1391
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:29,375
And I warned you about
opening up a restaurant.

1392
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:30,810
I warned you,
but it wasn't practical

1393
01:01:30,834 --> 01:01:32,542
and now you're in debt.

1394
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:34,667
Really, Reesa? You told her?

1395
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,458
And Reesa,
you're running around here

1396
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:38,500
doing fifty-eleven things

1397
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:41,166
when you need to be focused
on your issues.

1398
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,643
Now are you
being honest about that?

1399
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:43,834
Whoa whoa.
What are my issues?

1400
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:46,458
Enlighten me, please!

1401
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:48,262
Hey, guys, you know what,
we don't need to...

1402
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:49,434
No, no, no, no.
You think you know it all.

1403
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:51,583
And it's not just me.

1404
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:52,893
Melina says the same thing.
Right, Melina?

1405
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:57,917
No, no. What I said,
you know was

1406
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,250
that Reesa was having
a hard time focusing.

1407
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:02,625
Both: Same thing.

1408
01:02:02,709 --> 01:02:04,142
Anyway, neither one of you can
tell me how to run my life

1409
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:08,417
when your life is in chaos.

1410
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,834
Chaos? That is strong.

1411
01:02:10,917 --> 01:02:13,291
Yeah. Yeah. I told you.

1412
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:14,000
This is why I said
don't say anything.

1413
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,875
You do not speak to me.

1414
01:02:15,959 --> 01:02:17,834
I need to go meditate.

1415
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:21,917
But it's my last day...

1416
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:39,709
Mmm...

1417
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:45,917
Mmm...

1418
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,500
Mmm...

1419
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:55,166
Oh m...

1420
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:10,685
I want to work out a long-distance
relationship with you

1421
01:03:10,709 --> 01:03:13,000
because...

1422
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:14,083
because I love you.

1423
01:03:16,917 --> 01:03:19,291
And I'm gonna visit you
when school's out,

1424
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,083
and you can come for the
holidays.

1425
01:03:21,166 --> 01:03:22,166
So...

1426
01:03:23,959 --> 01:03:26,792
Oh, no. Not, not you.

1427
01:03:45,834 --> 01:03:47,291
Grazie.

1428
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,750
Dr. Cooper. Good to see you.

1429
01:03:59,834 --> 01:04:02,417
Oh, well, it's good
to see everyone.

1430
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,875
You know everyone on here, so
we can skip the formalities

1431
01:04:04,959 --> 01:04:05,959
and jump right in.

1432
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,041
Sounds good.

1433
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:11,375
Why do you want to chair
the English department?

1434
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:12,291
I want to be chair
of the English department

1435
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:13,375
because um...

1436
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:20,417
Surely you know why you want
this.

1437
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,041
What are you passionate about?

1438
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:31,250
Melina:
Thanks for letting me come over.

1439
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:33,750
Do you mind if I hang out here
a little while longer?

1440
01:04:33,834 --> 01:04:36,250
You know, if you do,

1441
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:37,733
I'm going to put you
to work, right?

1442
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,959
Really?

1443
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:44,875
I'm, hey...

1444
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,250
That's good.

1445
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:57,000
Thank you.

1446
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:58,803
It's even better
than I remember it tasting.

1447
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:07,208
Okay. I'm sorry.

1448
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:08,375
I didn't offend you, did I?

1449
01:05:08,458 --> 01:05:09,458
No, no, no.

1450
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,976
It's just been hard for me
to connect with someone

1451
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
since I got sick.

1452
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,250
You never know when cancer
might come back,

1453
01:05:23,333 --> 01:05:26,500
and the last thing I want
to be is a burden.

1454
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:29,291
Or worse, you know.

1455
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:30,975
Have someone staying with me
out of pity.

1456
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:37,917
Hmm. You know,
my mum got cancer when I was 16.

1457
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:43,625
And I watched my dad
care for her every single day.

1458
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,601
She was only supposed to live
one year after her diagnosis,

1459
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:50,917
but she actually lived for
three,

1460
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
and I know it was because my dad
loved her so much.

1461
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:57,667
If I've learned nothing at all,

1462
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,875
I know for certain
that life is not guaranteed

1463
01:05:59,959 --> 01:06:02,041
and that love should never
be taken off the table.

1464
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:22,142
Mm. Just when I thought there
was no topping this meal.

1465
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:25,417
Well, I've got my mojo back.

1466
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:27,959
Hmm.

1467
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:30,166
I like the sound of that.
One second.

1468
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:38,667
Please... put that recipe

1469
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:39,750
in my book.

1470
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:46,083
You have a cookbook?

1471
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:48,834
Not quite.

1472
01:06:48,917 --> 01:06:51,291
My dad made a book of my recipes

1473
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:52,917
when I graduated culinary.

1474
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,709
He says every great chef

1475
01:06:54,792 --> 01:06:56,017
has a cookbook, and this is
mine.

1476
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:57,917
Oh, wow. Oh...

1477
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,208
is that you?

1478
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:02,750
There I am.

1479
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:03,917
So cute!

1480
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,625
Wow. This is a really good idea.

1481
01:07:07,709 --> 01:07:09,542
All my recipes are written
on index cards

1482
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,750
and tucked away
in an old shoebox.

1483
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:15,709
Hmm. You know, sometimes
I get in a space

1484
01:07:15,792 --> 01:07:17,625
where I start thinking

1485
01:07:17,709 --> 01:07:18,976
things aren't gonna work out
for me,

1486
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,583
I look back at this,

1487
01:07:20,667 --> 01:07:23,917
and I think, Ôyou're a chef'.

1488
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,250
And I know everything
is going to be alright.

1489
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:29,813
I'm gonna go grab a pen.
I'll be back.

1490
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:41,166
Hey. I'm gonna need
your help with something.

1491
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,101
I thought you were done
talking to me.

1492
01:08:18,125 --> 01:08:20,083
Where are you?

1493
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:21,166
Um...

1494
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:25,208
Nowhere special.

1495
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:27,417
Your sewing machine came.

1496
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,500
Okay.

1497
01:08:30,083 --> 01:08:33,083
What's wrong?

1498
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:36,125
The girls and I got into it.

1499
01:08:36,208 --> 01:08:38,288
Melina was talking behind my
back, and Allison, well,

1500
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:41,250
Allison was just being Allison.

1501
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:42,625
She said my life was in chaos.

1502
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,834
Well, sometimes your real
friends

1503
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,000
can see what we can't.

1504
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:53,750
So where are they now?

1505
01:08:53,834 --> 01:08:55,667
I don't know.

1506
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,250
I needed some space.

1507
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,166
I just feel off.

1508
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,250
I don't know.
It's hard to explain.

1509
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:04,667
Well, you used to be chill,

1510
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,291
and now you're anxious
all the time.

1511
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,351
Because I feel like you don't
wanna do stuff with me.

1512
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:11,291
Look, I have a job.

1513
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:13,166
I can't play with you all day.

1514
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:14,351
And you know, I feel like
you only want me around

1515
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:16,709
to do your projects.

1516
01:09:16,792 --> 01:09:18,101
And I feel like you don't
want me around at all.

1517
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:19,709
That's not true.

1518
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:21,250
It feels like that.

1519
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:23,667
That's how I feel.

1520
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,430
I mean, I see the way
you look at me and...

1521
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,750
you're frustrated.

1522
01:09:29,834 --> 01:09:31,542
That's because you're
frustrated.

1523
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,333
Andre, I'm in an apartment.

1524
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:37,917
I mean... I mean
I'm looking at an apartment.

1525
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,417
An apartment? For what?

1526
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,500
I don't know.
I thought I needed time

1527
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:43,667
to figure this out, but...

1528
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:47,667
now it just doesn't feel right.

1529
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:51,667
Time alone.

1530
01:09:54,417 --> 01:09:55,750
So what are you saying, babe?

1531
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:03,792
What if I can't get pregnant?

1532
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:05,959
Will you still want me?

1533
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:09,250
Yes!
How can you ask me that?

1534
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,542
Because I don't know.

1535
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,750
Look, Teresa,
I will always want you.

1536
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:15,375
I just...

1537
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,417
I just wish you were here.

1538
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:36,125
Hey.

1539
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:37,583
- Hi!
- Um...

1540
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,875
Thanks for returning my text.

1541
01:10:39,959 --> 01:10:43,125
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1542
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:45,333
Listen, I know we need to talk
and...

1543
01:10:45,417 --> 01:10:47,375
You know what, let me start.

1544
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:49,000
I've been doing
a lot of thinking about

1545
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:51,000
what you said about me
being scattered.

1546
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:53,000
- I said unfocused.
- Alright. Unfocused.

1547
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,685
I haven't been
the easiest person to talk to.

1548
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:56,834
I get it.

1549
01:10:56,917 --> 01:10:59,041
You seem really calm right now.

1550
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:00,959
Um, should I be scared?

1551
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:02,500
No.

1552
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,417
Did you talk to Dre?

1553
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,620
- We had a long talk.
- Okay.

1554
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:08,583
And...

1555
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:10,518
And I meditated in a field
with a bunch of strangers.

1556
01:11:10,542 --> 01:11:14,208
Oh, well, that's um, different.

1557
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:16,000
It's amazing what you can hear

1558
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,917
when you block out the noise.

1559
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,750
I miss feeling important.

1560
01:11:19,834 --> 01:11:21,834
I haven't been feeling needed,

1561
01:11:21,917 --> 01:11:23,667
and it's been driving me crazy.

1562
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,041
I'm sorry.

1563
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:28,375
That's okay.

1564
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:31,625
So, I guess you didn't
sign that lease.

1565
01:11:31,709 --> 01:11:34,542
No. Once I got there,
it just didn't feel right.

1566
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:37,875
Hmm.

1567
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:39,834
Well, look,
I'm sure when you go home,

1568
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:41,959
you and Andre can talk,

1569
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:44,417
and things will work out.

1570
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,375
Well, we have a lot
to talk about,

1571
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:47,417
but I hope so.

1572
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:48,893
And you know
you're very important to me,

1573
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:52,542
so there's that too.

1574
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:54,505
So what time are you
heading out to the airport?

1575
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:57,291
About that.

1576
01:11:57,375 --> 01:12:00,041
So I am not going.

1577
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:02,083
And what made you
change your mind?

1578
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:03,846
Reesa, I have to let go,
and trust my team.

1579
01:12:06,875 --> 01:12:07,750
And have fun in the kitchen
again.

1580
01:12:07,834 --> 01:12:10,792
Look at you!

1581
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:11,583
And to think,
you almost didn't come.

1582
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:14,000
Yeah.

1583
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:15,476
Allison is going to be really
thrilled to hear this.

1584
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,083
Hey, have you talked to her?

1585
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:18,583
No.

1586
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,427
Because I've been calling
and texting, and...

1587
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:23,083
I want to give her this.

1588
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:24,166
What?

1589
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,083
No...

1590
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:32,792
Yeah.

1591
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:36,125
Okay. Okay! Let's go!

1592
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:37,208
Check please!

1593
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:44,667
No sign of her.

1594
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:45,750
Okay. We gotta call Nico.

1595
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:50,041
Ciao.

1596
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:54,917
It's us! Allison's friends.

1597
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,125
Is Allison with you?

1598
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:59,184
No. I've been calling her,
but she hasn't answered.

1599
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,709
- Okay.
- She hasn't called us back either.

1600
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:03,583
- She's missing.
- She is not missing.

1601
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:04,935
- She is missing!
- We just don't know where she is.

1602
01:13:04,959 --> 01:13:07,291
Do you know where she is?

1603
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:09,208
She posted something
earlier this morning.

1604
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:11,166
She could still be there.

1605
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:15,875
It looks like
Canale Monterano's church.

1606
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:17,142
That's that place
she's always talking about.

1607
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:18,375
Nico, we're gonna go there.

1608
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:19,458
I'll meet you. Ciao.

1609
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,333
Allison!

1610
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:40,500
Allison?

1611
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:42,500
Are you here?

1612
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:45,291
Oh my gosh. Where...

1613
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:46,375
Allison!?

1614
01:13:48,208 --> 01:13:49,208
Both: Allison!!

1615
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:54,250
Hey!

1616
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:56,375
Allison, we have been calling
you.

1617
01:13:56,458 --> 01:13:58,792
You scared us.

1618
01:13:58,875 --> 01:14:00,542
Oh. Sorry.

1619
01:14:00,625 --> 01:14:02,542
Reception up here is spotty.

1620
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:03,542
Well, are you okay?
We're worried.

1621
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:05,625
Yeah. I'm fine.

1622
01:14:08,667 --> 01:14:09,667
What's happening?

1623
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:13,583
I thought you were leaving?

1624
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:16,583
What? No. I'm staying.

1625
01:14:16,667 --> 01:14:19,333
But we'll get to that.

1626
01:14:19,417 --> 01:14:23,625
Wow. You had us worried.
Listen.

1627
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:28,041
I'm really sorry, okay,
that I lied about Tapas.

1628
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:30,208
It's just you always have
everything together,

1629
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:32,011
and I was kind of embarrassed
that I didn't.

1630
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:38,000
Okay, well, number one.

1631
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:39,243
I am so glad you are staying.

1632
01:14:43,959 --> 01:14:44,750
Number two,
I don't always have it together.

1633
01:14:44,834 --> 01:14:45,834
Um...

1634
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:50,101
I froze on the call with the
board.

1635
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:52,166
Melina: Really?

1636
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,458
Yeah. The more I spoke,

1637
01:14:54,542 --> 01:14:57,583
the more I realized
it isn't what I want.

1638
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,046
I, Allison Cooper, am guilty
of faking the funk.

1639
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:11,417
Enjoy this moment, Reesa.

1640
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,709
You were right.

1641
01:15:13,792 --> 01:15:14,976
I'm just saying,
it's a magical place.

1642
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,375
You know what?

1643
01:15:16,458 --> 01:15:17,698
I knew you were gonna say that.

1644
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:20,373
I, too, have a confession.

1645
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:28,291
I just recently learned that
my chakras are not aligned.

1646
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:30,375
And that's the reason why
I've been so,

1647
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:31,625
so bossy and scattered.

1648
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:35,959
And I'm working on it.

1649
01:15:37,709 --> 01:15:39,208
It's not funny.

1650
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:41,208
I need something to do.

1651
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:43,250
I mean, I retired

1652
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:44,834
so that I could have a family.

1653
01:15:44,917 --> 01:15:46,041
And if I can't...

1654
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,125
No.

1655
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,500
I know a lot of good fertility
doctors in North Carolina.

1656
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:54,768
And we are going to do
whatever it takes

1657
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:56,458
for you to have
the family you want.

1658
01:15:56,542 --> 01:15:59,875
Okay.
You are going to be fine.

1659
01:15:59,959 --> 01:16:01,208
That's right. Okay, listen.

1660
01:16:01,291 --> 01:16:03,959
Positive thoughts only.

1661
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:06,667
Look!

1662
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:08,458
Miss Optimistic is back.

1663
01:16:08,542 --> 01:16:11,458
Hey!

1664
01:16:11,542 --> 01:16:12,291
Maybe somebody got her chakras
aligned last night.

1665
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:13,917
Maybe!

1666
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Nothing happened!

1667
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:19,041
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Yeah.

1668
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:20,750
I'm just saying!

1669
01:16:20,834 --> 01:16:22,114
I have to get my chakras
aligned!

1670
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:23,166
We know you would!

1671
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:28,959
Okay. Listen.

1672
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:31,500
I'm just back
to trusting the universe again.

1673
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:33,959
That's good.

1674
01:16:34,041 --> 01:16:36,083
No more waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

1675
01:16:36,166 --> 01:16:38,667
- And... no more secrets.
- Yeah.

1676
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:41,917
And no more judging.

1677
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,959
I'm sorry I haven't been the
most supportive friend.

1678
01:16:45,041 --> 01:16:46,351
Well, you know,
everyone needs that best friend

1679
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:47,735
that's gonna push them to be
great,

1680
01:16:47,792 --> 01:16:49,500
and that is who you are.

1681
01:16:50,834 --> 01:16:52,583
Listen.

1682
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:54,959
- Now it's our turn. So...
- Right.

1683
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:58,083
Remember when you said

1684
01:16:58,166 --> 01:16:59,726
if it was meant for you
to be an author,

1685
01:16:59,792 --> 01:17:01,072
you'd already have a book
by now?

1686
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,875
What is this?

1687
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:11,583
ÒUnthinkably Good ThingsÓ

1688
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:12,667
by Dr. Allison Cooper.

1689
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:22,959
Oh...

1690
01:17:23,041 --> 01:17:25,291
These are my posts.

1691
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:28,750
Or, as I like to call it, um...

1692
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:31,667
your first poetry book.

1693
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:35,959
And there are more
blank pages in there

1694
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:37,393
if you should get inspired
to write some more stuff.

1695
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:39,750
Thank you, both!

1696
01:17:39,834 --> 01:17:41,959
And I would love
to take some of the credit,

1697
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:43,583
but this was all Melina.

1698
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,333
Oh...

1699
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:46,625
Look at the last page.

1700
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:51,458
ÒFall in love

1701
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:52,542
with your fresh start.Ó

1702
01:17:54,458 --> 01:17:56,792
Did I post that?

1703
01:17:56,875 --> 01:17:59,625
No, but um, you used to say it
to us all the time.

1704
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:01,458
Mm-hmm.

1705
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:02,375
Oh, yeah. I did.

1706
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:04,625
I can't go, can I?

1707
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:06,083
- No, you cannot.
- No. Uh-uh.

1708
01:18:06,166 --> 01:18:07,166
Don't you make me cry.

1709
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:13,083
Am I starting over? Right?
Yeah?

1710
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:15,750
I'm starting over. Oh!

1711
01:18:15,834 --> 01:18:17,959
Oh, Reesa.

1712
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:21,000
Whew!

1713
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:24,083
You know, it feels like
we're back

1714
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:26,375
on that rooftop
of our old building.

1715
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:27,875
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah.

1716
01:18:27,959 --> 01:18:29,208
And remember?

1717
01:18:29,291 --> 01:18:32,000
But... this.

1718
01:18:32,083 --> 01:18:33,917
This is a much better view.

1719
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:40,625
I'm taking my freedom.

1720
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:43,000
Uh-oh.
What you gonna do with it?

1721
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:46,583
I'm pulling it off the shelf.

1722
01:18:46,667 --> 01:18:49,959
♪ I'm putting it on my chain.

1723
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:51,500
♪ I'm wearing it
around my neck. ♪

1724
01:18:51,583 --> 01:18:53,625
♪ I'm taking my freedom.

1725
01:18:53,709 --> 01:18:55,125
♪ Wherever I choose to go

1726
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:57,208
♪ It will take me far.

1727
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:59,542
♪ Wherever I choose to go

1728
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:02,625
♪ It's gonna take me far.

1729
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:04,625
♪ I'm living my life
like it's golden. ♪

1730
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:05,851
♪ Living my life like it's
golden. ♪

1731
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:08,250
♪ Living my life like it's

1732
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:10,125
♪ Living my life like
it's golden, golden ♪

1733
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:14,500
Living my life like it's golden!

1734
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:18,250
Oh, wait.
Uh, before you go.

1735
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:20,500
I gotta get those keys
to your car

1736
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:23,333
Ôcause I gotta take back
this fabric.

1737
01:19:23,417 --> 01:19:24,559
Doggy Line?
Why did you support that?

1738
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:25,583
Um...

1739
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:28,333
Okay.

1740
01:19:28,417 --> 01:19:29,959
Buongiorno.

1741
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:30,917
Um, unless you need us to stay.

1742
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,083
No, no, no.

1743
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:34,559
I think she's got it.
And I think you got it.

1744
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:36,542
Ciao!

1745
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:38,041
- Arrivederci.
- Bye!

1746
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:40,542
- Bye bye!
- Come on.

1747
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:41,625
- Get in the car.
- Bye.

1748
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,291
Ciao Alli.

1749
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,500
Allison: Ciao.

1750
01:19:51,125 --> 01:19:53,583
I'm surprised to see you.

1751
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,867
Reesa called me because she
was worried about you and...

1752
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:00,903
I wanted to see you before I
left.

1753
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:04,583
Where are you going?

1754
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,709
Sanducci, I leave tonight,

1755
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:08,875
and I'll be there a few weeks,

1756
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,709
so probably,
when I'll be back you'll...

1757
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:11,792
Can you wait?

1758
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:14,917
So...

1759
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I can join you?

1760
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:20,041
After my girl's leave?

1761
01:20:23,083 --> 01:20:26,125
Are you saying you want to
meet the rest of my family?

1762
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:28,917
- It depends.
- On what?

1763
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,917
Am I still the reason
behind your smile?

1764
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,542
More than ever.

1765
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:34,792
So...

1766
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:37,458
Wait, does this mean
you took the offer here?

1767
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:41,166
Oh, the job!

1768
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:44,250
Dr. Di Grado meets with the
board in thirty minutes.

1769
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:45,685
I have to-I have to go. I
have to get to the school.

1770
01:20:45,709 --> 01:20:47,333
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

1771
01:20:47,417 --> 01:20:49,417
- Uh...
- Come on!

1772
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,166
Where's your truck?

1773
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:51,625
Lorenzo's running errands.
Come on.

1774
01:20:51,709 --> 01:20:55,041
Um, I...

1775
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,935
If you want to stay here, we
don't have a lot of time.

1776
01:20:56,959 --> 01:20:58,375
Come on. Let's go! Let's go!

1777
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:00,208
Okay.

1778
01:21:00,291 --> 01:21:03,125
My helmet.

1779
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,625
Oh...

1780
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:07,291
- Come on, Alli.
- Okay.

1781
01:21:07,375 --> 01:21:10,375
Ready. Hug me.

1782
01:21:12,917 --> 01:21:16,166
Slow down! Slow down!

1783
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,792
Slow down! Slow down, Nico!
Slow down!

1784
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:24,875
Who is that?

1785
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:29,208
Andre!!

1786
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:31,500
Reesa!!

1787
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:34,000
I can't believe you're here!

1788
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:35,083
Yeah!

1789
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:41,959
I'm so happy to see you.

1790
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:43,241
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1791
01:21:51,166 --> 01:21:52,291
Oh... excuse me. Oh!

1792
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:57,792
Oh!

1793
01:21:57,875 --> 01:22:00,041
Dr. Cooper!
This is a surprise.

1794
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:01,834
I'm sorry to burst in like this,

1795
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,041
but I, uh,
I came to let you know

1796
01:22:04,125 --> 01:22:05,041
that I really want that
position.

1797
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,333
Oh?

1798
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:09,125
I plan to ignite
my students' creativity

1799
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:10,667
and help them find their voices

1800
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:14,041
because... proper language

1801
01:22:14,125 --> 01:22:16,166
and the richness
of English literature

1802
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,458
are important, but tapping
into a student's

1803
01:22:18,542 --> 01:22:20,709
individual expression

1804
01:22:20,792 --> 01:22:23,542
is critical
to their personal growth.

1805
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:24,500
And more than anything,

1806
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:27,667
I want to stay here,

1807
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:31,333
because I cannot imagine myself

1808
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:32,917
anywhere else.

1809
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:38,417
Well said.

1810
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,959
Does anyone here object
to Dr. Cooper

1811
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:43,375
continuing her position for,

1812
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,500
how long do you anticipate
being here?

1813
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,500
Indefinitely.

1814
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:56,375
Well. Good. No?

1815
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:05,709
Okay.

1816
01:23:05,792 --> 01:23:09,166
Sorry. How are you?
Okay.

1817
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,917
Yay me!

1818
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,500
Oh, okay. Grazie! Grazie!

1819
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,709
Buona sera!

1820
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:19,166
So?

1821
01:23:22,917 --> 01:23:25,166
Your girlfriend is staying.

1822
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,709
Are you?

1823
01:23:27,792 --> 01:23:30,542
Singer:
♪ Ohhhhh

1824
01:23:30,625 --> 01:23:32,917
♪ Yeah

1825
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I love you.

1826
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:40,834
Allison: When you're young,

1827
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:43,458
having girlfriends is simple.

1828
01:23:43,542 --> 01:23:45,667
Understand her language.
Support her bad decisions.

1829
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:47,583
Love who she loves,

1830
01:23:47,667 --> 01:23:48,827
and dislike who she dislikes.

1831
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,667
As time passes,

1832
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:57,333
and life gets complicated,

1833
01:23:57,417 --> 01:23:59,750
it's not as easy
to understand her silence,

1834
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:02,417
embrace her insecurities,

1835
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,959
and agree to disagree.

1836
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,458
But it's a choice
we make as girlfriends,

1837
01:24:08,542 --> 01:24:12,208
and it's sacred.

1838
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:16,166
I always knew there was strength
in friendship,

1839
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:19,125
but along this journey,

1840
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:21,375
I've learned there is pure magic

1841
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:25,542
in this bond we call sisterhood.

1842
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:31,000
Singer:
♪ Place me now

1843
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:34,041
