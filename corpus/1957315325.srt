1
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,890
Welcome, my little creeps,

2
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,869
to Grindhouse Ghoulia's Theatre of Terror.

3
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:48,280
Tonight, we're showing a spooky

4
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,621
little Halloween potboiler
called "Reunion Massacre".

5
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,290
It's about a young woman

6
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,500
who travels to her high school reunion,

7
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,730
only to be met by a masked madman

8
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,250
with an agenda on his mind.

9
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,900
Can she defeat the killer,

10
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,860
and earn the coveted status of final girl?

11
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,080
Watch and find out.

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,187
And join me after the shocking climax.

13
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:45,563
- Stand in front of the
eye of Master Zaltar.

14
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,380
You must be very brave for what
lies ahead of you, my dear.

15
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,780
What will be onto you,

16
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,080
as you face a trauma from your past.

17
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,367
Be warned of a coward's deception.

18
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,120
- Hello?

19
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,800
- Hey mom, how's it going?

20
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,980
- I'm fine,
how are you sweetheart?

21
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,193
- Just hanging out.

22
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,816
Feeling kinda depressed.

23
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,850
- Oh, I know
it's gonna take time.

24
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,683
- I know.

25
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,080
- And you did the right thing.

26
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,140
- Thanks,

27
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,723
I know, you're right.

28
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,630
So, I got an invite in the mail.

29
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,011
- An invitation, for what?

30
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:09,200
- My high school reunion.

31
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,220
- Gosh, it's
already been 10 years?

32
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,153
- I guess so.

33
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:16,860
I'm not sure if I really wanna go, though.

34
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,860
- Why not?

35
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,960
It could be just what you need

36
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,323
to brighten your spirits.

37
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,753
- Yeah.

38
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:23,900
Showing up alone,

39
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,870
and telling everyone
that I've been a barmaid

40
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,750
and living paycheck to paycheck.

41
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,610
- Sweetie, you
can leave all that out.

42
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,970
I just thought you might feel better

43
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,970
seeing some old friends is all.

44
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,430
- I'll think about it.

45
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,280
- I really think you should.

46
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,320
- Okay, mom. Thanks for listening.

47
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,720
Talk to you later.

48
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,600
Love you.

49
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,393
- Love you too dear, goodbye.

50
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:24,041
- Be warned
of a coward's deception.

51
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:07,814
Hey.
- Hey!

52
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:08,647
- What are you doing here?

53
00:11:08,647 --> 00:11:09,793
- I just brought some
Halloween decorations.

54
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:10,960
I thought they'd cheer you up.

55
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,860
- Well come on in.

56
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,813
- So, you're gonna go?

57
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,310
- I'm thinking about it.

58
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,450
- Oh, you totally should.

59
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,360
I bet it would help get
your mind off things.

60
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,750
- Gah, now you sound like my mother.

61
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,870
- Well, it's a good idea.

62
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,940
You really should get out.

63
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,880
You're never going to meet a guy

64
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,490
cooped up in your own house.

65
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,910
- I'm not sure if I'm ready
for another relationship yet.

66
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,609
- Who said anything about a relationship?

67
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,970
Are we putting this stuff up or what?

68
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,286
- Let's do it.

69
00:13:56,191 --> 00:13:57,524
- Looks awesome.

70
00:13:58,482 --> 00:14:00,455
- Thanks for stopping
by, I really needed this.

71
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:02,538
- Yeah, you're my bestie.

72
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,280
Well, if you end up going to the reunion,

73
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,080
you should call me and
let me know how it was.

74
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,960
- I totally will, thanks again.

75
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,860
- Yeah. Hang in there though.

76
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,930
I probably should get
going to Michael's though.

77
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,763
I don't want to be late.

78
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:14,653
So, talk soon?

79
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:16,534
- Bye.

80
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:17,367
- Bye.

81
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,810
- So much at stake,

82
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,260
all you can think of is your own feeling.

83
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,250
One woman has hurt you,

84
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,463
you'll take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

85
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:52,137
You're a coward and a weakling.

86
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:59,509
No, oh, Richard, I'm sorry.

87
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,490
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

88
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,604
If you don't help us,
we'll die in Casablanca.

89
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:07,437
- What of it?

90
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:08,930
I'm gonna die in Casablanca,

91
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,133
it's a good spot for it.

92
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,157
Now if you--

93
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:24,317
- All right, I tried to reason with you.

94
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,630
I tried everything. Now,
I want those letters.

95
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,840
Get them for me.

96
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,123
- I don't have
to. I got them right here.

97
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:33,810
- Put them on the table.

98
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,107
- No.

99
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:40,523
- For the last
time, put them on the table.

100
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,020
- If Laszlo and the cause
mean so much to you,

101
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,370
you won't stop at anything.

102
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,050
All right, I'll make it easier for you.

103
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,020
Go ahead and shoot.

104
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,759
You'll be doing me a favor.

105
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:00,992
- Richard.

106
00:16:02,148 --> 00:16:03,898
I tried to stay away.

107
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,910
I thought I would never see you again.

108
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:13,285
That you were out of my life.

109
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:18,431
- Hello?

110
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,493
Is anyone there?

111
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:24,585
Hello?

112
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,850
- What the fuck is this?

113
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,480
- I can't take it anymore.

114
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,763
- You dumb bitch.

115
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:37,978
- Oh shit.

116
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:50,181
Fuck!

117
00:26:46,361 --> 00:26:48,442
- This doesn't look right.

118
00:27:05,202 --> 00:27:06,035
What?

119
00:33:26,947 --> 00:33:29,670
- It's you.

120
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,738
- Who the fuck else did you think it was?

121
00:33:31,738 --> 00:33:34,420
- I guess I should have known it was you.

122
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,100
Why are you doing this to me?

123
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,400
Why won't you leave me alone?

124
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,090
- Because you're mine.

125
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,120
You know the old saying.

126
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,850
If I can't have you, then nobody can.

127
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,390
- You're fucking crazy.

128
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,053
- Fucking crazy about you.

129
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:55,194
- No, don't cry, I love you so much.

130
00:33:55,194 --> 00:33:56,027
Don't cry.

131
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,460
- I put up with a decade of your abuse.

132
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,523
Not anymore!

133
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:29,827
Hello?

134
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:32,227
- Hey sweetie,
how are you doing today?

135
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,343
- Um, slowly getting better.

136
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,683
A little on edge.

137
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,680
- What did the doctor say?

138
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,680
- She said I should try and
continue my normal routines

139
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,250
and time heals everything.

140
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,070
- There's a lot of truth to that.

141
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,240
Just know that I'm here if you need me.

142
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,000
- I know, thanks mom.

143
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,720
- Did you decide if
you're doing anything tonight?

144
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,713
Halloween used to be your favorite.

145
00:40:57,713 --> 00:40:59,650
- Well, I don't know if I'm ready

146
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,473
to be around a bunch of people.

147
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,570
You know, they still
haven't found his body

148
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,400
or that other girl.

149
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,810
- You know that
sheriff, blind as a bat.

150
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,050
He couldn't find himself in a mirror.

151
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,920
The bastard probably hauled
off to die somewhere.

152
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,150
And if the sheriff don't
find him, the coyotes will.

153
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,630
- Mom!

154
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,063
God, I hope they find him.

155
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,450
I hope Kaia turns up too.

156
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,010
- Kaia is a wild one.

157
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,920
Always was.

158
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,167
Don't worry too much.

159
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:29,750
Her and that boyfriend of hers

160
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,930
probably went on another one

161
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,938
of their last minute camping trips.

162
00:41:32,938 --> 00:41:34,727
- I'm sure you're right.

163
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:38,370
Regardless, it all still
makes me pretty nervous.

164
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,700
- Maybe just
take it easy then tonight.

165
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,090
Find something fun to do around the house.

166
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,620
You could just hand out candy.

167
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,090
- I suppose.

168
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,110
They're playing some
good movies on TV too,

169
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,793
So I'll probably just do that.

170
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,610
My car is still in the shop

171
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,900
so I'm pretty much stuck here anyway.

172
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,880
- Okay. Well,
I'll stop pestering you.

173
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,160
Don't be afraid to call for anything.

174
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,993
Love you.

175
00:42:01,993 --> 00:42:02,826
- All right.

176
00:42:02,826 --> 00:42:04,030
I love you too, Mom.

177
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,980
- Goodbye.

178
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:20,551
- Oh Johnny!

179
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:21,718
Help me, help!

180
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:43,990
- I wonder what happened

181
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,373
to the one from last year.

182
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,310
Each year we spend good
money on these things.

183
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,180
Then come out here and the
one from last year is gone.

184
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,707
- Well, the flowers die,

185
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:57,002
and the caretaker or
somebody takes them away.

186
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:58,490
- Yeah a
little spit and polish

187
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:02,210
you can clean this up,
and sell it next year.

188
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:04,460
Wonder how many times
we bought the same one.

189
00:49:21,677 --> 00:49:23,720
- It was
from right over there.

190
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,680
I jumped out at you from behind the tree

191
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,940
and Grandpa got all excited

192
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:27,857
and he shook his fist at me,

193
00:49:27,857 --> 00:49:31,551
and he said "boy, you'll be
damned to hell"

194
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,250
Remember that, right over there.

195
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,309
You use to really be scared here.

196
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:38,814
- Johnny.

197
00:49:38,814 --> 00:49:40,493
- You're still afraid!

198
00:49:40,493 --> 00:49:45,493
- Stop it.

199
00:49:46,373 --> 00:49:50,456
- They're
coming to get you, Barbara.

200
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:54,116
They're coming for you, Barbara.

201
00:49:55,632 --> 00:49:57,941
- Stop it,
you're acting like a child.

202
00:49:57,941 --> 00:49:59,737
- They're coming for you.

203
00:49:59,737 --> 00:50:00,820
Look,

204
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,501
there comes one of them now.

205
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,621
- He'll hear you.

206
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:05,851
- Here he comes now,

207
00:50:05,851 --> 00:50:06,951
I'm getting out of here.

208
00:50:06,951 --> 00:50:08,981
- Johnny!

209
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:19,021
- Night of total terror.

210
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:48,277
- Kids.

211
00:51:40,777 --> 00:51:42,667
Night

212
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:44,250
of the Living Dead.

213
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:13,864
- Night of

214
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,270
total terror.

215
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,853
- I mean, seriously, not funny.

216
00:52:20,325 --> 00:52:21,158
You gotta be

217
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:22,741
fucking kidding me.

218
00:55:42,894 --> 00:55:44,730
- I told you nobody could have you.

219
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,510
- Well, if that wasn't a downer,

220
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,730
then I don't know what is.

221
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,770
She got away the first time,

222
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:51,110
but that son of a bitch
just wouldn't stay down.

223
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:55,280
Brings a new meaning to
"'til death do us part".

224
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,450
If you ask me, she
could've done much better.

225
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,229
Never settle for less, kitties.

226
00:59:01,229 --> 00:59:05,318
Anywho, that's all the
time they pay me for today.

227
00:59:05,318 --> 00:59:06,530
Oops.

228
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:07,620
I mean uh,

229
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,020
that's all the time we have today.

230
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,650
Join me on the next installment

231
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,350
of "Grindhouse Goulia's Theatre of Terror"

232
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,990
from 42nd street films.

233
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,185
Pleasant screams.
