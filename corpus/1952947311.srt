2
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,685
Hi.

3
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:54,720
Hi.

4
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,556
My name is Kent.
What's your name?

5
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,691
Daphne.

6
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,560
Daphne. Beautiful name.

7
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,695
It sounds like the
name of a flower.

8
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,687
Obviously I know that it's
not a flower, but it could be.

9
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,558
I like the flowers.

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,704
Smelling them, stuff like that.
Sending them to people.

11
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,667
Where are you from?

12
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,646
Connecticut.

13
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,511
Really?
I am a big fan of it.

14
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,584
I'm a... Who isn't, right?
You're close to the city...

15
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,586
...and you can really enjoy it.

16
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,611
But also it has
a small town feel.

17
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,658
-Did you go to school there?
-Yeah. I went to Wesslam.

18
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:32,750
That's a great school.

19
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,461
-What's your major?
-Psychology.

20
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:36,695
It's great.

21
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,666
Those are really beautiful
earrings, by the way.

22
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,634
Nice job complementing...

23
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,536
I'll stop you right there.

24
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,738
Because on paper
you've done everything right.

25
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,541
Took an interest
in my personal history.

26
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,509
You've complemented
my accessories.

27
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,702
Blah, blah, blah.

28
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:56,749
If we'd met in college, our
relationship would've developed.

29
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,552
Which I'd come to regret.
I'd find out...

30
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,688
...that you're just as boring
in the bedroom...

31
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,589
...as you've been during
this awful conversation.

32
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:05,658
Okay, Daphne...

33
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,660
If I wanted a nice
sexual pen pal...

34
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,684
...you'd be on my list.

35
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:12,492
We'd just l-chat all night.
LOL. Tickles.

36
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,666
But unfortunately, that's
not what I'm looking for.

37
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,726
I want a man whose
hand doesn't shake...

38
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,497
...when he puts it up my shirt.
Do you know what I'm saying?

39
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,610
Okay.
Daphne, if I could just...

40
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,778
Save it, Kent.
I'm not looking for a BFF.

41
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,541
Daphne, please.

42
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,512
Bitch, I'm talking to you!

43
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,711
-What did you call me?
-I didn't stutter.

44
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,591
You sure can talk the talk,
you crazy little slut.

45
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,525
But, can you
deliver the goodies?

46
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,552
I don't give a damn
about Connecticut.

47
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,697
I hate those cheap buildings.

48
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,660
I'm from North Dakota and this
is how we handle our business...

49
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,601
...in the vice and state,
mamma.

50
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,741
Get your hands off me.

51
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,539
I'll take you to your knees
in this bar.

52
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,577
Promise?

53
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,688
Hold on, angel crossing!
Angel crossing!

54
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,460
Get on it. Here we come.
Watch out!

55
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,709
What a beautiful view.

56
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,749
So, this is where you live?

57
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,526
This is where
you live too, honey. Come on.

58
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,667
What do you think
about Daphne?

59
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,671
-I really liked Daphne.
-You did?

60
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,540
-Yeah.
-Definitely naughty.

61
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,633
She's a lot naughty,
but in the fun way.

62
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,611
Kent?
Did you like him?

63
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,712
-Kent was hot.
-Really?

64
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,680
I like those glasses,
nice touch.

65
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,705
You want to try
on the planes vibe?

66
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,541
Like an angry cowboy
who drives a van.

67
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,587
-Hot.
-But has ninja equipment...

68
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,689
...back in his apartment.
A lot's happening.

69
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,757
-You know?
-Yeah.

70
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,525
Like a transformer.

71
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,494
-I'd like to meet Kent again.
-Yeah, come here.

72
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,458
Toothpaste and all.

73
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,699
-I love you, Kate.
-I love you.

74
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,463
You are the best girl
in the whole world.

75
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,691
Let's get this off of you.

76
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,567
That was fun.

77
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,770
-That feels good.
-It's the acupressure.

78
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,738
-Really?
-No, I just like to rub it.

79
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,609
This stuff is connected to
stuff inside your tummy.

80
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,743
-I know.
-Push the wrong...

81
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,779
-Know what that's for?
-Until later.

82
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,746
Okay.

83
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,539
When's the big day?

84
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,584
I'm sorry?

85
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,621
We're getting married in the
spring in South Carolina.

86
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,488
-Yeah, what about you?
-We're not getting married.

87
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,660
So, why do you take
the dance classes?

88
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,563
We do a lot of stuff together.
That's one.

89
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,552
Yeah, it's fun.

90
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,733
Can't think of what
we don't do together.

91
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,667
Why you
don't wanna get married?

92
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,637
-Yeah.
-We are happy.

93
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,626
-We're happy.
-Yeah.

94
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,740
I love her.
Marriage brings pressure...

95
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,608
...and stress in stuff.

96
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,677
Don't want our relationship
to be work.

97
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,679
We're together
'cause we enjoy it.

98
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,476
Not because we have to.

99
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,743
There's a reason that they
use the expressions:

100
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,475
"Tying the knot"
or "Ball and chain".

101
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,521
Know the
words of a ceremony?

102
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,490
Like: "l promise to obey."
Or "Till death do us part."

103
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,549
I'd rather be like stuck
on an island...

104
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,529
...with some weird millionaire
trying to kill me...

105
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,689
...and trying to escape
than be...

106
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,756
...in something with that.
That's a time bomb.

107
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,770
So, what about children?
You do want to make them, no?

108
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,538
-No, no.
-No.

109
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,664
I don't wanna make them.

110
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:19,645
It just don't want to be
responsible for this kid...

111
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,510
...and disappoint them.

112
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,749
Yeah, that's our families.

113
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,751
We're both from
divorced families.

114
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,720
We've seen it. We don't
need to repeat the pattern.

115
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,587
But anyway, congratulations
on getting married.

116
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,647
That's a cool thing.
To each their own.

117
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,714
Yeah, absolutely.

118
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,756
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas!

119
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:36,757
Bye-bye.

120
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,483
-Big-bad Brad!
-Hi!

121
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,658
-How are you?
-Look at this. How are you?

122
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,489
You remember
my girlfriend.

123
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,562
-How are you? Good to see you.
-Hi.

124
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,631
What are you guys
doing for Christmas?

125
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,498
We got the entire
family flying in.

126
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,591
13 airport pick-ups.

127
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,537
4 days of listening
to how gifted my nieces are.

128
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,577
My brother thinks his daughter,
the four year old...

129
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,477
...is gonna be the next Beyonce.

130
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,512
She is bad and she sucks.

131
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,689
I'm vacationing in tropical
Albany this year...

132
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,524
...with Tricia's family.

133
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,560
They got us a cot,
which is awesome.

134
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,618
We'll end up sleeping...

135
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,763
...on the couch
in the basement with cats.

136
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,531
All seven of them.

137
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,522
We'll get to be there
the whole week.

138
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,769
Sounds like
a prison sentence.

139
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,703
Why put
yourselves through that?

140
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,569
It's Christmas, right?
Don't you have to?

141
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,775
We don't need to do it.

142
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,710
We don't.
We don't do it.

143
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,701
-We're done.
-Why, what are you doing?

144
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,441
-We're going to Fiji. Just us.
-Yeah.

145
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,447
Fiji?

146
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,517
Yeah.

147
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,751
Don't your families
get upset?

148
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,719
Not if you're doing
charity work.

149
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,455
Like building houses
in third world countries.

150
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,549
Teaching English
in Puerto Rico.

151
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,526
Helping orphans in Somalia.

152
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,563
Helping Chinese kids
capture lobsters.

153
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,535
Boil them, cut them,
clean the weird stuff out.

154
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,670
We find it that the more
details you give...

155
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,638
...kinda throws them
off the set.

156
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,675
You lie to your families
at Christmas time?

157
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,473
You really
can't do it without lies.

158
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,612
Try it.

159
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,714
But don't you
ever feel guilty?

160
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,552
For taking a vacation
on our vacation?

161
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,586
No, not really.

162
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,453
-You look sexy with a tan.
-Thanks, babe.

163
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,549
You could take this one.
This one here.

164
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,518
-Like that.
-Yeah, that's a good idea.

165
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,734
I made a couple's
massage rev for the weekend.

166
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,565
-You did? It's great.
-Yeah.

167
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,740
I'd
check us in online after this.

168
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,707
I did it.

169
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,644
You checked us in?
You're the best, sweetheart.

170
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,545
I picked up a pair of
noise-canceling headphones.

171
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,649
-You did not.
-For the next time.

172
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,640
-Oh my God.
-I'm excited.

173
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,521
We'd sign up for the scuba
boat as soon as we get there...

174
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,455
...I heard it fills up
really quick.

175
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,592
Do you feel like we've
been on this vacation before?

176
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,528
The scuba diving, we did that
in Bali and Costa Rica.

177
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,657
Yeah, but this is Fiji.
We've never been to Fiji.

178
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,637
That's a different island.
The resort is beautiful.

179
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,504
And the scuba diving
will be different.

180
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,474
It's different water and fish.

181
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,611
It's gonna be really good.
I'm excited.

182
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,613
-lt'll be amazing.
-Are you excited?

183
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,638
-I am. I'm really excited.
-I'm excited.

184
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,651
-I love you.
-I love you too.

185
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,695
Hey, Mom, merry Christmas.

186
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:05,671
Yeah.

187
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,641
Listen. Actually I'm sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

188
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,700
We're actually heading out
to Burma.

189
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:15,738
Yeah. That's exactly
the island in Asia, Burma.

190
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,743
We're inoculating babies.

191
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,644
Yeah, we'll be
helping out this kids.

192
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,790
It's such a great cause,
but honestly...

193
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,527
...it just sucks that we won't
be with you and the family.

194
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,655
You know how much...
I know it's been three years.

195
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,699
I wish I would've
called you sooner.

196
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:37,532
But Kate sent all
the gifts and stuff to you.

197
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,533
Okay.

198
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,576
That's Merry Christmas
in Burmese.

199
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,645
All right, I'll tell her.
I love you too. Bye.

200
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,673
Learned
"Merry Christmas"?

201
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,513
I gotta take everything
to the next level.

202
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,610
Come on, let's do this.
I'm excited.

203
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,578
Attention, San Francisco
passengers.

204
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,681
All flights
have been grounded...

205
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,549
...due to
weather conditions.

206
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,550
Sir, excuse me.

207
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,719
Your flight is not going out.

208
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,722
But what I can do
is get you set up for standby...

209
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,486
...on the first flight
to Fiji tomorrow. Okay?

210
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,693
Tomorrow won't be great.

211
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,761
We've scheduled
the couple's massage...

212
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,696
I'm sorry, sir. I don't make
the fog, I deal with it.

213
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,601
The best I can do is get you
a suite at the Radisson.

214
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,536
They have lovely accommodations
next to the airport.

215
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,640
You promise?
At the Radisson?

216
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,508
-Did you hear that?
-Brad.

217
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,576
No, that's terrific.

218
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,567
Would it be possible
to take us out...

219
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,545
...and get us McDonald's
as desert?

220
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,582
I'll start missing
flights often.

221
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,651
With this kind of
red carpet service.

222
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,551
-Terrific. A suite.
-Brad, please.

223
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,589
That's not helping, Brad.
Is there another airline...

224
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,625
...that you're affiliated with?
Like a sister airline?

225
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,685
-No, I'm sorry.
-Do you have a cousin airline?

226
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,663
How about one your
airline's filled out before?

227
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,600
The FAA has ruled that bay
area fog is simply too thick.

228
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,672
No flights are coming in
and no flights are going out...

229
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,640
...until at least
tomorrow morning.

230
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,710
Let's see how travelers
are coping in all of this task.

231
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,476
We have a couple over here.
Excuse me, sir?

232
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,478
Where are you headed
for this Christmas?

233
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,483
We're live on the air.

234
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,655
You look
dressed for vacation.

235
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,654
We're taking...
And we take the trips.

236
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,635
We'll take a different trip.

237
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,738
What he's trying to say is
that we plan a trip every year.

238
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,468
This is actually
ruining our Christmas.

239
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,609
You must be pretty upset.
Are you visiting family?

240
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,748
This is Kate.

241
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,639
Hi, Mom.

242
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,622
I know, Mom. All the flights
were cancelled.

243
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,756
-They're not...
-It's Dad.

244
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,526
They're not sure
if it'll be today.

245
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,661
You want me to answer it?
Do I answer or no?

246
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:17,458
Do I pick it up or not?

247
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,732
Yes, I know. I understand
you have feelings.

248
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:23,532
What? What do you want me to do?
I don't know what this means.

249
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,542
He's gonna
give you a big hug.

250
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,601
-I'm not hugging anybody.
-He's excited.

251
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,604
-We'll see you at noon.
-Noon?

252
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,750
Kate, are you crazy?
Did you commit us to go?

253
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,520
What did you want me to say?
They saw us on the news.

254
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,545
We're not
inoculating babies in Burma.

255
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,748
-No...
-We're stuck here.

256
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,725
What did you say to your dad?

257
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:49,662
I told my dad that we'll
be going over there.

258
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,562
Don't compare
your situation.

259
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,530
-You kidding?
-There's new stuff...

260
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,667
...that you're missing.

261
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,465
My Dad's a unique
animal. Your mother's not.

262
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,772
My dad, your mom.
My mom, your dad.

263
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,773
Great.

264
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,469
We'll see
4 families in one day.

265
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,669
Know what this means?
What you committed us to?

266
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,645
I know exactly
what this means.

267
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,726
Brad.

268
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:25,530
Baby.

269
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,530
I don't want to fight.

270
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,703
I don't wanna fight either.

271
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,572
-I hate this.
-We never fight. I'm sorry.

272
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,539
I love you.

273
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,611
This is what our families do
and what happens.

274
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,746
Mother makes me crazy
when I talk to her.

275
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,549
You're right.
Here's all we got to do.

276
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,584
Get through this
Four Christmases...

277
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,720
...as quickly and as painlessly
as possible.

278
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,746
Exactly. Promise me that no
matter what happens today...

279
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,750
...we'll still
have each other.

280
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,489
-Honey, of course we will.
-Okay.

281
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,564
If one of these
houses gets too intense...

282
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,643
-...we'll need a strategy.
-Yes.

283
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,579
We'll need a word that
means it's time to leave.

284
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,547
A safe word,
what it should be?

285
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,782
It's a good idea.
Mistletoe.

286
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,750
-Mistletoe is really good.
-Okay.

287
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:23,452
By the way, my father's house
can get uncomfortable.

288
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,692
Please do not feel embarrassed
if you feel the need...

289
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,683
...to pull the cord early,
say Mistletoe...

290
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,752
...if this house
gets too uncomfortable.

291
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,522
-Okay.
-Even if we're there for 10 min.

292
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,499
All right, I'll let you know.

293
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,636
I'm looking out for you.
Be cool.

294
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,572
I'm gonna go see
your dad and your brothers now.

295
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,733
Unless you're too weird
with it, then we're out.

296
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,600
-I'm going in.
-And going out would be...

297
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,581
-Mistletoe.
-Done. Let's get out of here.

298
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,744
Brad, we're going in.
Let's go.

299
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,597
Son of a bitch.
The TV stars actually came.

300
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,666
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Dad.

301
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,635
Merry Christmas.
Good to see you.

302
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,660
-Thanks for having us.
-Good to see you.

303
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,771
-Come on in.
-Okay.

304
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,607
Let's... Let's celebrate.

305
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,472
Okay. Sounds good.

306
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,649
That's a lot
of presents you sent.

307
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,514
You're trying
to outdo us?

308
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,585
The biggest
one is for you, Howard.

309
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,489
Yeah? What is it?

310
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,581
I'm not gonna tell you.

311
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:36,651
What, are you crazy?

312
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,696
-Bro.
-Hey, buddy.

313
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,469
Baby!

314
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,741
Kate, these are my brothers:
Denver and Dallas.

315
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,545
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

316
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,513
You must be Orlando's girl.

317
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,646
Orlando?

318
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,718
We're named after the cities
in which we're conceived.

319
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,687
I'm Denver, that's Dallas.
And this is Orlando.

320
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,492
Orlando?

321
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,586
My given name is Orlando.
But I changed it to Brad.

322
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,686
I'm Brad.

323
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:13,766
What?

324
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,564
Well, Merry Christmas
one and all.

325
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,635
-Ordeurs for anyone.
-Come on.

326
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,473
Who are you trying
to impress, Suze?

327
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,609
We also got beer in the back.

328
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,598
Ladies first.

329
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,533
Thank you so much.

330
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,581
What is this?
Is this cheese?

331
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,581
Yeah, spray.

332
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,723
Spray cheese from the famous
family of aerosol cheeses.

333
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,654
Give me a hand.

334
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:50,636
Here we go.

335
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,571
Do you have something
to say about my wife's cheese?

336
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,775
Hump it! Hump it!

337
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,744
I haven't seen
that in a while.

338
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,510
Shut it, soldier boy!

339
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,478
The spray cheese!
The spray cheese!

340
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,709
Bring it home, soldier boy.

341
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,695
God, honey. I'm so sorry
that you had to see that.

342
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,706
Let me
apologize for them.

343
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:31,710
If you wanna say "Mistletoe"
'cause it's too heavy, I get it.

344
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,679
I get it. Don't feel weird.

345
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,682
Need to get out, let me
know about your comfort zone.

346
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,671
That was weird.

347
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,786
Can't believe you didn't
tell me your name.

348
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,583
-What are you saying?
-l...

349
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,748
It's crazy.
We've been together for 3 years.

350
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,627
I don't know your name.
Isn't that odd?

351
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,460
No, it's not. I hated my name
so I changed it.

352
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,467
Don't say: "My name used
to be asshole, but it's Bob."

353
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,504
-Just: "My name is Bob."
-Maybe to a stranger...

354
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,771
...but to somebody close?

355
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,640
You say your real name.

356
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,642
I don't want to get into
this now.

357
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,667
This is what I was
afraid would happen.

358
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,680
This is isn't us, it's them.
We're letting them in.

359
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,650
Your name isn't asshole.
It's like your middle name.

360
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,619
Don't wanna be
blindsided again.

361
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,522
Very funny. Go ahead
and take a shot at me.

362
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,590
I have to deal
with those Neanderthals.

363
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,455
I gotta take it from you.

364
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,762
No, you shouldn't. You shouldn't
let them walk over you.

365
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,698
Kate, they're trained
USC fighters.

366
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,598
Know pressure
points on people.

367
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,502
You're twice their size.

368
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,604
They're semi-professional
cage fighters.

369
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,673
Like one person comes out,
one doesn't.

370
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,509
A cock fighting
but with dudes.

371
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,612
-Said they're personal trainers.
-They're dude cock fighters.

372
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,512
Like what you see on the PPV.

373
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,584
Exactly. Except they don't
actually get paid for it.

374
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,552
They brawl
in people's backyards...

375
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,688
...and they upload
the footage to YouTube.

376
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,488
Honey, my childhood was just
like "Shawshank Redemption".

377
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,762
Except I didn't have some kind,
older, soft spoken black man...

378
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,593
...to share my struggle with.

379
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,723
But you're not
that child anymore, okay?

380
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,463
You're a grown, strong,
confident, successful man.

381
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,604
I don't want to get into this.

382
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:11,541
Brad, just know the truth.
They're intimidated by you.

383
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,578
What you need to do
is go out there...

384
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,737
...and set some
boundaries...

385
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,449
...and demand that
they respect you. You know?

386
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,652
Hey, big city, come to
open up some presents!

387
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:23,519
-Come on, we gotta go!
-This is your opportunity.

388
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,518
You can do this, baby.

389
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:31,655
Right, right.

390
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,656
Okay, gentlemen.

391
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,601
Can we take it down
a notch, please?

392
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,671
I'm not a kid, you can't
talk to me like that.

393
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,540
We're adults.
Understand?

394
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,633
I'm a grown man
with hair on my chest, right?

395
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,678
There's gonna be certain
boundaries between us.

396
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,741
They might be invisible.
I know you won't see them...

397
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,543
...but you'll be able to respect
the fact that they're there.

398
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,518
These boundaries
are not to be crossed.

399
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,648
And if they're crossed, there's
gonna be real consequences.

400
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,631
Thank you.

401
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,470
Welcome back, stud!

402
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,540
Don't!

403
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,608
Stop!

404
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,547
Stop it!

405
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,788
Come on, can I go in?

406
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,624
No, you boys could get hurt.

407
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,625
Come in!

408
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,490
-Come on!
-Take us in!

409
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,652
-Go!
-Yes!

410
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,500
Get it!

411
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,695
Google me, bitch!

412
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:47,733
What?

413
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,737
Google. You might wanna
look me up sometime, Barbara!

414
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,507
No! Dad!

415
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,646
Stop!

416
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,672
Let's open the presents...

417
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,546
...so Orlando can get
to his other Christmases.

418
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:00,718
Let's do it.

419
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,561
Baby.

420
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,564
It's me. It's me.
Are you okay?

421
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,625
Did you break anything?

422
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,502
I am so proud of you.

423
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,598
Orlando, just go to the tree.

424
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,751
Gosh, wasn't it so
hard to find gifts...

425
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,548
...under the 10 dollar cap?

426
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,521
The first gift is to Connor.

427
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,690
-The 10 dollar what?
-10 dollar spending cap.

428
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,523
Uncle Brad and his special
friend Kate, maybe...

429
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:42,560
Brad?

430
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,558
I'll be your nice uncle...

431
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,654
...after you see what I got you.
Open it up.

432
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,467
-Brad?
-Yeah.

433
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,633
What?

434
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,538
X-Box. This is awesome.

435
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,673
Top shelf for you, pal.

436
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,665
It's got the triple core
processor, the whole deal.

437
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,745
It's a 10 dollar
spending cap.

438
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,646
How did you find
an X-Box for under 10 dollars?

439
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,551
Someone's trying to show off
how much money he makes.

440
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:07,677
His family
didn't tell him...

441
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,721
...there's a 10 dollar
spending cap.

442
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,724
Or maybe if you came home
you'd know crap like that.

443
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,726
Can we try
to stay positive here?

444
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,729
What's the problem? We're
trying to give some gifts.

445
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,599
It's Christmas. Let's keep
the momentum going.

446
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,559
The next gift is to Cody.
This is from your dad.

447
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,664
I'm sure this is
a good gift too. Okay?

448
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,472
Good, tear it up.

449
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,705
A flashlight?

450
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,477
That's it?

451
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,652
Why don't you love me,
Daddy?

452
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,755
Okay, okay. Honestly,
I think it's my fault.

453
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,723
Didn't know about the
a 10 dollars.

454
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,760
My gift from Santa Claus
better be straight cool.

455
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,630
I have a feeling that your
gift from Santa...

456
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,655
...will probably be
around 10 dollars too.

457
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,635
Why? Is Santa Claus
cheap like my daddy?

458
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,502
No, Santa is dad.
Dad is...

459
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,706
Right.

460
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:03,731
I don't understand.

461
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,545
What's happening?
What's the problem?

462
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,504
There's no Santa Claus.

463
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,683
You're joking with me, right?
You're kidding me.

464
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,554
They know there's
no Santa Claus?

465
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,657
They do now.

466
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,625
How could you lie to us, Daddy?

467
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,751
There is a Santa Claus.

468
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:22,755
Cody, come on.

469
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,554
You and Santa Claus
don't love me.

470
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,633
That's not gonna
bring back Santa. That's not...

471
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,658
When he gets hurt inside
and can't get...

472
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,568
...his emotions into words,
he takes to streaking.

473
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,575
Don't worry,
he always comes back.

474
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,507
Nobody loves me!

475
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,583
Okay, look.
I'm really, really sorry.

476
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,517
-I assumed...
-All right.

477
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,553
Let's keep it moving.

478
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,521
I'm starting to lose the balls.

479
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,722
All right?

480
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,525
What's this one here?
You're gonna love this, dad.

481
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,526
That's a satellite dish.

482
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,532
Why would I want it?

483
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,659
Not a satellite,
it's a satellite dish.

484
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,737
Terrific. You get more
channels and viewing options.

485
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,602
I don't get enough channels?

486
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,775
Well, your TV right now
is a radio, so...

487
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:11,776
Wait.

488
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,507
How much does this gift
will cost me a month?

489
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,683
Nothing.
We're paying for the services.

490
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,674
-So, nothing actually.
-Wait, wait.

491
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,588
Just because I drive
a van for a living...

492
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,613
...doesn't mean I need
a fancy lawyer son...

493
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,759
-...paying the bills for me.
-Okay, you win.

494
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,523
If you want to pay,
wherever your want.

495
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:33,564
The installation guy comes
on Tuesday, he'll install it.

496
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,700
Cancel it.
We install things ourselves.

497
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,638
Dad, I think you'll want
a professional to handle this.

498
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,471
If you think I'll allow
a sex predator...

499
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,700
...in a uniform to wander
around my house...

500
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,636
...and touch my underwear...

501
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,513
You can't... No, no.

502
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:52,710
I'll see you outside in five.

503
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,619
All three on the roof.

504
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,643
-Let's go.
-Okay.

505
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,514
To her mother.
I gotta take a grumpy.

506
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:02,615
What don't you...?

507
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,595
You wanna go over
to your mom?

508
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:10,592
Yeah, okay, come here.
Careful. There you go.

509
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,467
Ain't it nice to have
everybody home?

510
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,733
Yes, it is.

511
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,507
We're gonna make
bologna sandwiches I think.

512
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,717
Okay, here we go.

513
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,619
Okay.

514
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,722
Take her before
it explodes.

515
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:31,689
Thank you.

516
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,559
Gotta go and do
some man's work.

517
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,573
You gotta use
a lock nut.

518
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,509
I know what I'm doing.
I don't need any lock nut.

519
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,711
Sorry,
I know that you major...

520
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,612
...in a satellite dish
installation at Stanford.

521
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,549
Yeah.

522
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,652
Great, dude. Mock me
for being educated. Awesome.

523
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,584
-Hey, Grandpa!
-Hey!

524
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,648
Come play War with me!

525
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,692
Maybe later,
Grandpa is busy.

526
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,497
Grandma's boyfriend
plays with me whenever I want.

527
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:17,502
Your grandmother's boyfriend
is a first class ass sniffer.

528
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,628
You can tell him
I said so.

529
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,704
Connor, go get us
some beers, man.

530
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,710
Sounds like you and mom
really turned a corner there.

531
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:29,614
I don't want to speak ill
of her on Christmas.

532
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,581
But...

533
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,784
...she's a common street whore.

534
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,752
Okay, that's great.
Nicely said.

535
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,455
What?
What do you call a woman...

536
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:39,658
...who throws away a career,
abandons her kids...

537
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,593
...and runs off
with another man?

538
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,584
-What?
-What do you call her?

539
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,564
Dad, she was a cashier,
that's not a career.

540
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,668
That's a job. She left you
'cause you wouldn't talk to her.

541
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,737
Stopped spending time with her.
Shut her out of you life.

542
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:56,571
I put a roof over her head.
And I never lied to her face.

543
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,643
I spoiled her,
that's what I did.

544
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:00,508
Let that be
a lesson to you...

545
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,546
...about being
honest with your wives.

546
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:06,516
You can't spell "families"
without lies, am I right?

547
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,514
-Amen, Dad.
-Yeah.

548
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,524
What is she like...
two or three months?

549
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,529
-Nine.
-Wow.

550
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,689
-Yeah.
-Nine months.

551
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:22,499
She's not walking or
taking care of herself by now?

552
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:25,537
Are you kidding me?
Most days I'm lucky to get...

553
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,596
...my boob out of her mouth
so I can shower.

554
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,604
-Yeah.
-Does that hurt?

555
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:30,675
Breast feeding?

556
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:31,642
No.

557
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,612
Maybe at first, but
the nipples get tough.

558
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,548
I can hardly
feel mine anymore.

559
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,480
You wanna flick one?

560
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,687
-No.
-Please.

561
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:43,676
-No, no.
-Go ahead.

562
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,559
That's okay. I have a
set of my own. I pass.

563
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,719
-Sure. Of course.
-But thanks.

564
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,491
Okay, we're all set!

565
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,462
Hey!

566
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,563
The picture's all fuzzy.

567
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,770
Did you get me some
sort of cheap old satellite?

568
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,772
No, it's not a cheap
old satellite.

569
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:04,469
I just gotta adjust it.
How about now?

570
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,610
Even worse!

571
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,736
I can make it work!
Hold on!

572
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,446
How about now?

573
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,681
Dad...!

574
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,617
Could you hold her?
I need to bake another thing.

575
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,585
No, actually...
Okay.

576
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,621
Okay.

577
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,486
Come on,
you can't break her.

578
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:19,691
-Okay.
-Yeah.

579
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,715
Okay, you know what...?

580
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,686
You gotta
point it up at the satellite.

581
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,530
Is it better now?

582
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,464
No, it's worse.
It's still crappy.

583
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:29,726
I don't think she likes me.

584
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,628
She likes you fine.

585
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,563
Just give her a chance
to warm up to you.

586
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,503
-How about now?
-Worse. It's worse.

587
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,564
Son of a bitch.

588
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,737
Take the damn thing down. I
can do better with rabbit ears.

589
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,573
I love my rabbit ears!

590
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,721
Tell me "hot or cold".

591
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,518
-What?
-Hot or cold.

592
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:55,491
Hot or cold what?
What the hell does that mean?

593
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,562
How long until
she warms up to me?

594
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,526
Not long at all.

595
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,768
-Horrible.
-Point it up!

596
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,570
Shut up, let me work!

597
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,673
I don't want a fancy satellite.
I don't want any satellite.

598
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:12,473
It's not a satellite, genius!
It's a satellite dish!

599
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,478
Okay.

600
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,706
-Pull the thing and...
-Get off my roof!

601
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,478
Pull the damn thing!

602
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,532
It's too much.

603
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,625
Whatever you're doing,
stop it right now!

604
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,634
-Leave my TV alone!
-I'm fine!

605
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,663
She stopped crying.

606
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,640
I did it!

607
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,609
You idiot! Stop it!

608
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,605
-This is all right.
-Leave my TV alone!

609
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,484
I'm fine.

610
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:55,708
That's awesome.

611
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,652
Okay, I'm coming up.

612
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,703
Give me back my baby!

613
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,670
Mistletoe.

614
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,447
Mistletoe.

615
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,730
I can't believe I nailed
that baby's head.

616
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,498
I feel kind of bad.

617
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:43,635
That's my brother's kid. You
couldn't avoid it. It's fine.

618
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,770
I did get her
to stop crying for a second.

619
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,704
I think she kinds of likes me.

620
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,574
Yeah.

621
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,600
Know what happens to your
nipples after your breast feed?

622
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:54,779
I don't wanna know.

623
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,475
No, I don't think you do.
It's violent.

624
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,513
-They crack up like tire rubber.
-Okay.

625
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,651
Just so you know, it's a bit of
a cougar den here at my Mom's.

626
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:12,718
This is different.

627
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,467
Maybe she has
a new boyfriend.

628
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,710
Merry Christmas, Mom.

629
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,513
Merry Christmas, Kate.
Come on in.

630
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,502
Merry Christmas.

631
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,547
Give me a hug, Kate.

632
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:35,653
Oh, okay.

633
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,449
Good to see you.

634
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,624
And you must be Brad.

635
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,591
Mrs. Kincaid.

636
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,460
Call me Marilyn and get
over here...

637
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,689
...and give me a hug,
you big, fat, purple teddy bear.

638
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:47,531
Bring it!

639
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,566
-Yes, yes!
-Hey, Merry Christmas.

640
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,594
Shit, that feels good.

641
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,503
You're so tall and firm
like a giant oak.

642
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,634
He's tall.

643
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,736
-Brad, this is my aunt Sarah.
-Hi.

644
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,682
-This is my aunt Donna.
-Hi.

645
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,583
-Genuine leather.
-Nice to meet you, ladies.

646
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,722
The one in the canarian hanging
on your belt is Gram Gram.

647
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,658
Sorry, but that's my belt.
That's attached to me.

648
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,593
Sorry. Merry Christmas to you.
It's a great sweater.

649
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:17,728
I get it.

650
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:23,461
This is the den. Well,
everyone's here.

651
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,671
I can't believe you came.

652
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,673
-Hi, Courtney.
-Hi, sweetie.

653
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,509
I can't get up.
Jackson is very gassy...

654
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,744
...and I gotta keep
bouncing him.

655
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:33,745
Okay.

656
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,679
-Well, this is Brad.
-Hi.

657
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:37,681
Hi.

658
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,443
I'm Courtney.

659
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,481
-Brad. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

660
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,578
And that's Granddad.

661
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,514
And this is
Courtney's husband, Jim.

662
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,490
-Take Jackson.
-All right.

663
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,527
He's so good with kids.
Yeah.

664
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,699
-We're gonna try again.
-Well...

665
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,634
You're too cool for kids.
It ruins your independence.

666
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,505
I never said
I was too cool for kids.

667
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,740
I know you didn't say it.
But you don't have any.

668
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,574
And you have really strong
ideas about not having them.

669
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,575
Well, that's actually not...

670
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,481
I'd rather just not get into it.

671
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:12,649
Where's Kasi?

672
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,709
She's outside in the jump-jump
with the rest of the kids.

673
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,611
There's a jump-jump?

674
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:21,759
Kate hated
the jump-jump.

675
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:25,593
In the 5th grade, kids trapped
her inside of the jump-jump.

676
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,499
-She never got over it.
-I got over it.

677
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,558
They tortured her
for about an hour.

678
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,535
Why would they
trapped her in?

679
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:34,593
Because she was...

680
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,641
..."Cootie Kate".

681
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,608
Courtney.

682
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,565
Who's Cootie Kate?

683
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:42,747
-She didn't tell you?
-This isn't necessary.

684
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,616
All the kids pretended
that Kate had cooties...

685
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,447
...and no one talked to her.

686
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,787
If Kate even touched you,
you'd have to wipe it off...

687
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:52,585
...and spray with disinfectant
to get it off.

688
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,693
That sounds hurtful.
How long did that go along for?

689
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,628
Not long. I don't remember.

690
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:58,763
Seven years. Until 6th.

691
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,631
That was a long time ago.

692
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,733
I'm sure you don't
have cooties now.

693
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:03,700
Let's test it.

694
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,469
Cooties!

695
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:13,744
Pastor Phil has encouraged us
to dispense...

696
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,647
...with the commercial
trappings of the holidays.

697
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,549
-Pastor Phil?
-Mom's new beau.

698
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:19,641
It's a whole new thing.

699
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,618
So...

700
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,482
...what I had in mind
was that...

701
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,525
...we'd go around the room
and each of us...

702
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:30,756
...would speak to the spiritual
gifts that we might give.

703
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,691
A verbal gift giving of sorts.

704
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,701
Wait. There's
really no presents.

705
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,668
Kasi.

706
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,469
None that you can see.

707
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:41,729
Okay, I'll go first.

708
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,676
I'd like give more
of myself to my church...

709
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,541
...and to Pastor Phil.

710
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,641
Gram-Gram,
would you like to go next?

711
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,612
I could increase the frequency
with which...

712
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:02,624
...I pleasure Milton with
my hand and with my mouth.

713
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,525
Did she just say that?

714
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,631
Brad, why don't you go next?

715
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,470
I follow Gram-Gram
with that...

716
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,666
...hand stuff and what she
does with her... Yeah, okay?

717
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,511
I'd like to...

718
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,474
...with Kate...

719
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:25,604
...would be too...

720
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,612
Vacationing more frequently
and do in it with Kate.

721
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,656
That is lovely, Brad.

722
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:37,662
-He's so well spoken.
-Thank you. Thank you.

723
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,527
Courtney,
what would you give?

724
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,565
Well, I'd like
to give myself a gift.

725
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,691
And that is the gift
of being pregnant.

726
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,673
I know that comes with its
own challenges for 9 months...

727
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,540
...Iike getting fat and
people stare at you funny...

728
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,667
...when you sneak a cig.

729
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,680
I'd like to give
myself another gift.

730
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,705
And that is a scheduled
a C-section.

731
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,552
Don't most women want
to have a natural birth?

732
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:05,756
Yeah, women who haven't
done it before.

733
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:06,723
Right.

734
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,653
You just come here.

735
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,565
Auntie Kate,
will you please hold him?

736
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,633
What do I do?

737
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,602
You gotta hold him.
Okay, got him?

738
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,730
I'll fix myself here.
There we go.

739
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,641
-What should I do?
-See if he made a stinky.

740
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:24,630
How do I do that?

741
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:27,542
Just lift up his diaper
and see if he made one.

742
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,513
There's
something in here.

743
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,581
It's a really disgusting...

744
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,587
Jackson...

745
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,581
You project it on auntie Kate.

746
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,762
-I'm gonna vomit.
-Brad, are you okay?

747
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,525
Get him some water.

748
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,664
-I'm about to throw up.
-Oh, God.

749
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:51,728
I'll get sick. I can't be here.

750
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,659
What do I do?

751
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,706
Take it away.
Sorry. I love you.

752
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,674
You gotta get out.
I can't breathe.

753
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,633
I want to do it too!

754
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:01,702
-Kate!
-What?

755
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:10,710
Are you joking me? These
are the only clothes we have?

756
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,646
How's that possible?

757
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:16,550
It's not like you come around.
Haven't been here in... Forever.

758
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,530
Can't believe you told him
about "Cootie Kate".

759
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,565
How's I to know
you hadn't told him?

760
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,668
You'd tell Jim you're
"Cootie Courtney".

761
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,736
We know
everything there is to know.

762
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,572
He knows I slept with
the water polo team.

763
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,597
Like I know he
experimented with men.

764
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,679
-I didn't need to know that.
-My point: after three years...

765
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,580
...I'd think that
you and Brad...

766
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,673
...would know a little more
about yourselves.

767
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,745
How can you appreciate
someone for who they are...

768
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:43,746
...until you really know them?

769
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:51,595
Thank you.

770
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,623
I kind of feel like a
Saudi prince in here.

771
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,625
We're so glad that
Kate has a boyfriend.

772
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:01,501
You're the longest relationship
she's ever had with a man.

773
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:05,609
With a man?

774
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:34,661
What's this?

775
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:53,623
Oh, my God.

776
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:17,481
Who's that?

777
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:18,673
That's Josephine.

778
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,684
Everyone called her Joe.
She was Kate's only friend.

779
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,518
Last I heard, Joe coaches
women's wrestling.

780
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,596
Check that out!

781
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,562
-That's Kate?
-Yeah.

782
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,625
She looks like Shaq.

783
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,506
Hi, auntie Kate.

784
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,577
-Hi, Kasi.
-What are you doing?

785
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,520
Not much. Do you need
to use the bathroom?

786
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,453
What's this?

787
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,658
That is my
special magic marker.

788
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:11,769
What?

789
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,737
We can't
have magic markers.

790
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:17,605
-I have to tell my mom.
-No. You don't need to do it.

791
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,666
Actually, can I have it back
because...

792
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,547
Kasi.

793
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:24,514
You want this?

794
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,507
This is not a joke,
this is not game.

795
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,511
Auntie Kate needs
her marker back, okay?

796
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:34,717
Kasi, this is not funny!

797
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,587
Kasi,
please come out of there!

798
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,554
Don't make me
come and get you.

799
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,458
Kasi!

800
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:09,691
Come on!

801
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,489
Come and get it!

802
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,753
Wait.
Kate went to a fat camp?

803
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:39,519
Yeah, she lost three pounds.
It only took her all summer.

804
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,657
A pound a month.

805
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:42,559
Courtney.

806
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:47,497
Kasi, honey. Please
give back that marker!

807
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:48,732
Keep away!

808
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,571
Come and get it, old lady!

809
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,572
What?

810
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,698
Keep away! Keep away!

811
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:56,740
Give it to me!

812
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,509
"Give it to me."

813
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,743
Just give me the marker.
Okay?

814
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,507
"Just give me the marker.
Okay?"

815
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,538
Come and get it!
Sucker!

816
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,620
Get it!

817
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:16,593
Yeah!

818
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,752
-That's Kate?
-Yes.

819
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,532
Wait. Hold on.
You told me... Who's that?

820
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,625
-That's Kate.
-That's not a boy named Bjorn?

821
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,548
Can't believe it. Kate's
playing with Kasi.

822
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,675
I've never seen her
play with my kids before.

823
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,676
Hey! Okay!

824
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:47,581
Mistletoe!

825
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,517
Brad! Mistletoe!

826
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,493
Mistletoe!

827
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,567
-We're so glad you're here.
-I'm having so much fun.

828
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:01,696
What did she take so long to
bring you? Is what I wanna know.

829
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,523
I came here for a marker...

830
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,524
...and I'm not leaving
without one!

831
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:45,682
Kasi!

832
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,511
That marker in your mouth,
I peed on it!

833
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:32,462
Hey!

834
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,723
You never told me
you went to a fat camp.

835
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,502
It was: "Get fit camp".

836
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,471
I can't believe my family
is showing you the pictures.

837
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,506
My favorites are
when you're a baby...

838
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,633
...'cause it looks almost
like you're a twin...

839
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,678
-...but you ate the other baby.
-Brad.

840
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,680
-That's why you're powerful.
-Stop.

841
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,616
You ate your twin sister,
took all of her powers.

842
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,481
-Cut it out.
-Baby, I love you.

843
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,688
It doesn't bother me if you
were a really large child...

844
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,589
...with lesbian tendencies,
if that was your journey...

845
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,592
-...then I'm cool with it.
-What lesbian tendencies?

846
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,652
-I saw the pictures of Joe.
-Joe wasn't gay.

847
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,667
Haircuts don't lie.
What did you do with Joe...

848
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,770
...Iike play baseball
and ride motorcycles?

849
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,639
We're just kids.
She was really imaginative.

850
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,675
We played in the basement.
She had this game: "Sun tan".

851
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,578
Pretended we're on the
beach, she'd take lotion...

852
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,705
...she never wanted me to burn,
so she'd rub it...

853
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:28,518
Okay, listen and look at me.
You are better.

854
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,656
I'm saying it's not fun when
the shoes are in the other foot.

855
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,725
You shouldn't
have been shitty to me...

856
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,694
...when you have so many
skeletons in your own closet.

857
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,521
Do not throw rocks when
you live in the house of Joe.

858
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:42,721
I see your point.

859
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,530
I love you.
I'll see you in a little bit.

860
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,608
Mom.

861
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,745
I need to talk
to you for a sec.

862
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:58,442
I don't have time. I don't
wanna be late for Pastor Phil.

863
00:46:58,515 --> 00:46:59,482
But I just...

864
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,518
I want to talk now.

865
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:04,578
If it's important now, it'll be
important after church, right?

866
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:06,757
Yeah...

867
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,658
Clean yourself up a little,
this is a nice church.

868
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,640
And now...

869
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:28,638
...the Pastor Phil!

870
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:32,710
Hello. There's a new born King.
Hallelujah!

871
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,513
Hallelujah!

872
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,651
Praise Him!
Hallelujah!

873
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,624
Praise Him!
Talk to Him, lady!

874
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,494
Glory to the new born King!

875
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,492
Hallelujah!

876
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,691
Please be seated.

877
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,504
I've been given a note.

878
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,677
The Walshes
performed the role...

879
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,580
...of Mary and Joseph
for the last three years...

880
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,741
...they've done a great job,
but some didn't agree.

881
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:08,518
So, we'll need a pair
of volunteers...

882
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,543
...to perform the roles
of Mary and Joseph.

883
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,580
You should do it.

884
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,591
What?

885
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,630
No, I won't get in front
of a bunch of strangers.

886
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,622
You're staged trained. You
played Pippin in High School.

887
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,735
No. I wasn't Pippin,
I was in Pippin.

888
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:29,573
I played a tree because I had
a bad stage fright, remember?

889
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,667
This seems like I'm putting you
on the spot and in fact I am.

890
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,604
Honey,
Pastor Phil needs you.

891
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,615
-I'm not gonna do it.
-A volunteer?

892
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,515
Or do I still need
a volunteer?

893
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,754
Kate will play
the Virgin Mary.

894
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:44,755
What?

895
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,757
Hallelujah!
The cure of the world!

896
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,554
I just said I wouldn't.

897
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,592
Hallelujah!
Kate, you stand up!

898
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:52,719
Stand up, please!

899
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,600
Look at the joy you've brought
to this congregation...

900
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,568
...by your volunteering
to be Mary.

901
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,661
Hello.
I still need a Joseph.

902
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,628
Brad, be Joseph.

903
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,543
Not staged trained.
I never played Pippin.

904
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,636
It's not the performance.
You have to get up.

905
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:11,579
-I don't wanna be alone.
-It's not gonna happen.

906
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,706
Brad, you stand up!

907
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,582
You're a part of this, Brad!

908
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:37,572
Listen, Brad. I need
to look out for me up there.

909
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,577
Because I'm starting
to get like really nervous.

910
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:42,636
-That stage fright thing.
-How do I look?

911
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,676
-What do you think?
-You look fine. I'm trying to...

912
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,480
My man's skirt, is it
short or is okay?

913
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:50,677
-Honestly.
-Little short.

914
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,688
Okay, here's Jesus.

915
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,553
They don't use a doll?

916
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,494
-Here are your scripts.
-Scripts?

917
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,653
-I'm not ready for scripts...
-Hi, Jesus.

918
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,662
No one said
there'll be lines...

919
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,535
-Hi, Jesus.
-Actually, his name's Bernard.

920
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:07,537
Okay.
Hi, Bernard.

921
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:10,574
Okay, I got lines. I gotta
try to get my voice ready.

922
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:13,643
Red leather. Yellow leather.
Red leather. Yellow leather.

923
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,440
This is a good baby.

924
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,442
Look at this baby.

925
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,548
Baby, baby Jesus
is really kind of cute.

926
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,549
This child is a blessing
to the both of us.

927
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:24,721
Really?

928
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,681
What, do you think
I should do it bigger?

929
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:31,455
Should I do: "This child's
a blessing for the both of us.

930
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,763
I'm not angry.
I'm inspired.

931
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:35,698
Oh, my God. There's so many
ways to play this thing.

932
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,768
Can I ask you
a question seriously?

933
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:40,570
My wife is pregnant,
but is not my child.

934
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,505
But I'm cool with it because
God got her pregnant?

935
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,445
Are we ready
to see the result...

936
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,447
...of that
immaculate conception?

937
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:53,445
Hallelujah!

938
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,542
Brad, I don't feel good.

939
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,587
You should
hold the baby.

940
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,656
Sweetheart, I gotta get ready.

941
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,454
Just remember:
acting is reacting.

942
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:05,457
And Joseph and Mary,
went from Galilee...

943
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:06,757
...and out of the city
of Nazareth.

944
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:11,456
Okay, find your truth.
I'll finish this bitch.

945
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:18,574
Brad.

946
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:20,544
I can't do this.

947
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:22,671
Check it out, baby.
They're getting my walk.

948
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:34,613
Because there was no room,
they stayed in the stable.

949
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:40,497
And Mary wrapped the baby
in swaddling clothes...

950
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:41,691
...and placed him
in a manger.

951
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,779
And Mary wrapped the baby
in swaddling clothes...

952
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,509
...and placed him in a manger.

953
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,548
Put it in it.

954
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,691
Brad, help me swaddle.

955
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,716
Gotta save my line;,
losing the audience.

956
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,556
It's death out there.

957
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:12,628
Come on, Mary!

958
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:18,498
This child is a blessing
for the both of us.

959
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,570
Amen!

960
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,662
That's right!

961
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:27,710
Your line.

962
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:31,581
I forgot my line.

963
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:33,481
-What?
-I forgot my line.

964
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,708
Thank goodness
I memorize yours too.

965
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,680
We shall name him Jesus.

966
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,525
Glory to God!

967
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:46,753
And peace on earth
to the highest point on earth!

968
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:53,628
This thing isn't big
enough to swaddle him.

969
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,739
Someone's got to give
a performance.

970
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:58,606
I'm nervous. I can't feel my
legs. Don't do this.

971
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,666
It'd appear
that my wife is better at...

972
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:04,605
...making babies than
swaddling them, no? Yes?

973
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,487
Brad, you're wearing the
swaddling cloth on your belt.

974
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:15,616
Woman, do your job
and swaddle this baby!

975
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:19,496
Brad, I can't. You're wearing
the swaddle around your belt!

976
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:22,566
Enough! This child's
life is now in jeopardy.

977
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:25,558
Unfit mother, give me this baby.

978
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:33,566
And l, Joseph,
shall swaddle this baby!

979
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:38,708
And l, Joseph,
will protect this child.

980
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,512
Forgive her, son...

981
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:46,485
...for she knows not
what she's done!

982
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:53,629
Yeah!

983
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,705
Hallelujah!

984
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:04,740
That's the message
of Christmas.

985
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,634
Hallelujah!

986
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:12,673
Hallelujah!

987
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,448
Brad, that was...!

988
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,615
All is calm.

989
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:26,519
All is bright.

990
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:33,659
Round you
V.irgin Mother and Child.

991
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:40,568
Holy infant
so tender and mild.

992
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,605
I know how Celine Dion
feels after one shows.

993
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,782
You give,
you're not getting a lot back.

994
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,718
-I got back to you.
-You feel like Celine Dion?

995
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,754
How do you calm down
of such a high?

996
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,585
It's difficult to do that.

997
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,691
I can't believe
you threw me down...

998
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:56,556
...in front of the
congregation.

999
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,752
You're thinking
about you.

1000
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,530
I was thinking about
the entire show.

1001
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,698
Frankly,
with you there...

1002
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:03,566
...I brought
the thing home.

1003
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:04,555
-My God.
-I did.

1004
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,670
-ls this how it's gonna be?
-What?

1005
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,738
-What are you saying?
-I'd like to know...

1006
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,674
...you'll be
for me in a crisis.

1007
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,709
If we're on a plane,
it's going down.

1008
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:14,511
I passed out,
and say:

1009
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:15,637
"Put on your
oxygen mask."

1010
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,681
I'd like to know that you'd
put mine on, before yours.

1011
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:22,550
I wouldn't. FAA wouldn't
want me to do it either.

1012
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,688
-I'm not... FAA?
-lf you'd listen...

1013
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,747
-What?
-Do you ever listen?

1014
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,754
Or are you too busy moving
your BlackBerry?

1015
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,620
-I listen to the stewardesses.
-When they say...

1016
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:35,688
...that you're supposed to put
your mask on in an emergency...

1017
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,733
...before you try to help
out a child.

1018
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,769
-I've heard her.
-lf you pass out...

1019
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:42,672
...you're not helping.
"Put the mask on this one."

1020
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,508
Now I'm passed out.
I won't help anybody.

1021
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,566
It's not the point.

1022
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,745
What is the point? Sorry,
I got this wrong.

1023
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,474
What's your point?

1024
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,718
We're not connecting.
It's like you're not present.

1025
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:57,516
I have been present.
I've been here all day.

1026
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,655
We've been doing things
alongside.

1027
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:02,453
I'd like for us to do
things together.

1028
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:05,523
Kate, you're upset
with your family...

1029
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,495
...and you're taking
it out on me.

1030
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,532
They've been
my family for years.

1031
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,501
This is not about my family,
it's about you and me.

1032
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,602
I just...

1033
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:15,731
I just want something.

1034
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,640
-Merry Christmas.
-Mom!

1035
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:21,711
-I've missed you!
-Good to see you, Mom!

1036
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,735
It's been so long.

1037
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,715
-And you must be Kate.
-Yes.

1038
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:28,447
She's a darling.

1039
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,521
-Thanks. Nice to meet you.
-It's wonderful.

1040
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,590
-Should I call you...
-Just call me Paula.

1041
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:34,614
-Just Paula.
-Okay.

1042
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,749
I'm so glad you came.

1043
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,618
You've been
taking good care of him.

1044
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:41,531
Hasn't missed
many meals.

1045
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,533
-That's great.
-He likes a snack.

1046
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:45,535
-I do like the snack.
-Yes, he does.

1047
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:46,593
Come on in and relax.

1048
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,572
I've fixed all of your
favorite dishes, Bradford.

1049
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,574
Denver and Susan
are watching TV.

1050
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,676
Let's sit here
and catch up for a minute.

1051
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:55,735
-Your house is beautiful.
-Thank you.

1052
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:57,547
This is gorgeous.

1053
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,649
Bradford lived
with me after the divorce.

1054
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:02,585
Denver and Dallas were
comfortable with Howard.

1055
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,746
But Bradford was
the more sensitive type.

1056
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,524
-I was thinking...
-We're best friends.

1057
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:08,582
Just inseparable.

1058
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,628
God, he breastfed
until he was five.

1059
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,630
Thought l'd
take him to college.

1060
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,697
Okay, we had enough...

1061
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,699
The only who was
on my tits more...

1062
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,635
...was a professor
that I dated.

1063
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,503
Could you not say "tits"?

1064
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:23,529
-Hey, kids.
-Okay, this is Darryl.

1065
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,502
Hi, nice to meet you.

1066
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,600
It is so nice to meet you,
young lady.

1067
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,581
And always great
to see you, big guy.

1068
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,606
Hey, how was traffic
getting out here?

1069
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:37,447
Can I get your gas money?
I'd like to get your gas money.

1070
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,722
Actually, I don't need you
to get my gas money.

1071
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:41,724
Thank you. I make
more than you do.

1072
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,716
-So, no thank you.
-Bradford, be nice.

1073
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:46,719
It's okay, sweetie.

1074
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:50,733
Look...

1075
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:52,635
...Brad...

1076
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,672
...I'm not trying
to be your father.

1077
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:56,730
You got one of those.

1078
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,635
I'm just hoping for chance
to be your friend.

1079
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,545
You're my friend, Darryl.
You're my best friend.

1080
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,716
We grew up together,
we rode bikes.

1081
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,718
Used to smell
each other's hands.

1082
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:11,482
You're sleeping with my mom,
it's weird.

1083
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:12,646
Can you appreciate that?

1084
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,725
I never had a sexual thought
about her until I was 30.

1085
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:18,628
Leave it alone.
You can't be my friend anymore.

1086
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,630
You can't be sleeping
with my mom...

1087
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,564
-...and still be my friend.
-Thirsty.

1088
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,634
Kate, what can
I get you to drink?

1089
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:25,768
-I'm good.
-Your mother...

1090
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:28,601
-...is a very sexual being.
-She's a very what?

1091
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,772
She's a great lover.

1092
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:32,642
Say that again
and I'll bust your mouth open.

1093
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:35,736
Hey, look it. This is Christmas
and we're not gonna go there.

1094
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:38,681
Kate's been kind enough
to send us some games.

1095
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,707
We're gonna play them
and we'll have fun. Okay?

1096
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,762
Why are you staring
while eating?

1097
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,662
That's uncomfortable.

1098
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,502
Don't eat those brownies.

1099
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:01,527
Those are Grandma's
special brownies.

1100
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:04,741
Kate, could you be a lamb
and explain the rules?

1101
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,642
Of course. So, you try to
get your team mate...

1102
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,579
...to say the word
on the top...

1103
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,604
...but can't say any of the
words listed.

1104
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,716
And if you say any
of the words...

1105
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:15,616
-...then you get buzzed.
-Okay.

1106
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,487
That makes sense?

1107
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:19,756
I'm so excited to have
all here to play this game.

1108
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,524
It's gonna be fun.

1109
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,515
Hey, it's good to have
my friend back.

1110
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,497
So, who wants to go first?

1111
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:28,498
-I'll go.
-Okay.

1112
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,489
Brad, why don't you
buzz your mom...

1113
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,635
-...and then I'll do the timer.
-Okay.

1114
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:33,602
Thanks.

1115
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:37,596
On your mark, get set, go!

1116
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:41,575
Okay, this is a town in France.

1117
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,745
What?

1118
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,441
-Can't say "France".
-Don't buzz me.

1119
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:46,716
It's the same
for everybody.

1120
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:48,581
It's okay.
Do the next card.

1121
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,554
Okay.

1122
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,585
This me, I'm a...

1123
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,757
Cradle robber.

1124
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,657
-What did he say?
-Keep going.

1125
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:58,660
Don't worry.
You're a therapist. Go.

1126
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:01,764
-No, not Capricorn but...
-Libra.

1127
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:02,731
Yes!

1128
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:05,534
It's fun.

1129
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,570
Okay.

1130
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,698
This is what you dripped
on me.

1131
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:11,639
Wax!

1132
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:12,732
No, after that.

1133
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,477
It's brown.

1134
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:16,713
Make this stop, please.

1135
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:17,714
Chocolate.

1136
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,648
No, before that!
After the wax!

1137
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,551
-The syrup!
-Yes!

1138
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,711
Way sticky,
I wouldn't recommend that.

1139
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:27,546
-Okay.
-Okay, time.

1140
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:28,752
Time.

1141
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,517
-Good job. Good job.
-We only got two.

1142
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,686
Who wants to go next?

1143
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,593
-We'll go.
-Okay, great.

1144
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:36,622
I'll do the buzzer.

1145
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,626
Are you gonna eat
while you play that?

1146
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:42,739
-Flip the tube.
-Excuse me?

1147
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:43,728
Flip the tube.

1148
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,632
Okay. On your mark,
get set, go!

1149
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,579
-Capital of China.
-Hong Kong.

1150
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,546
Yes.

1151
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,672
Thing next to your bed
on the night stand.

1152
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:53,681
-A sock.
-Yes.

1153
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,620
Helped you come up
with this, you're drunk...

1154
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,713
...and came home from
the bar last Thursday.

1155
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:01,523
-Alibi.
-Yes.

1156
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,755
The thing I'm not
allowed to wear to Supercross.

1157
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,484
-Mini skirt.
-Yes!

1158
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,488
Me and you dry humping
on the beach.

1159
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,660
-A screensaver.
-Yes, baby!

1160
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,531
This game is so easy.

1161
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,662
The only man I'm allowed
to cheat on you with.

1162
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,698
-John Grisham.
-Yes!

1163
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,512
-Mexican dude.
-Ricardo Montealban.

1164
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,479
-Yes!
-Time.

1165
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:26,477
-Right here. Right here!
-Come on!

1166
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,653
Okay, this is like
an attack video.

1167
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,689
There's other people
uncomfortable.

1168
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,452
Stop. Oh, God.

1169
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:37,516
You guys got a lot.
How many was that?

1170
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,661
-Seven.
-Seven.

1171
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,561
-Can you do the buzzer?
-Yeah!

1172
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,632
We can do this, baby.
You ready?

1173
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:43,633
Yeah.

1174
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:45,535
Let's light a fire.

1175
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,469
-Ready? Go!
-Okay.

1176
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,605
The thing
I'm most scared of.

1177
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:50,673
-Snakes.
-No, no.

1178
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,643
-Thing I'm most scared of.
-Jump-jumps! 4 year-olds.

1179
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,668
This scares me to my core.

1180
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:58,509
Come up with something.
Use a lifeline.

1181
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,582
Spiders.
I'm scared of spiders.

1182
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,652
You don't have to say
the answer.

1183
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:06,452
You can say "eight-legged
animal" or "superhero"...

1184
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:08,725
-Can't say superhero!
-Mom, I'm not the one...

1185
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,692
Try again.

1186
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:13,459
In high-school,
my senior year spring break...

1187
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:16,599
...I was in Cancun,
wearing this bikini top...

1188
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,624
-Tourists. Skinny.
-No, no, no.

1189
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:20,603
-Thin?
-No, at the bar.

1190
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,572
-I was shaking around...
-Dancer.

1191
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,674
-My stuff fell out.
-Your what fell out?

1192
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:25,742
My stuff fell out.

1193
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,511
Everybody said
when I went to the bar:

1194
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:29,535
"Oh, here comes..."

1195
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,738
Peek-a-boo.

1196
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:36,652
Peek-a-boo.

1197
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,555
Okay, honey, you can say,
like, "look" or...

1198
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:41,657
-Can't say "look".
-I don't have the card.

1199
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,760
I'm giving examples.
I have a thing here.

1200
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,557
-See...
-Can't say "see"!

1201
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:46,763
I'm explaining
the game.

1202
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,458
Can't say "game"!

1203
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:50,726
Mom, the answer's been said.
She said the answer.

1204
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:52,702
-Let's do the next one.
-Okay.

1205
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,637
-Let's... you know?
-I get it.

1206
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:57,663
Okay, this is something
you would eat...

1207
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,643
-...you put it on a barbecue.
-Chicken.

1208
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,667
-My favorite.
-Beef.

1209
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:02,779
Can't say "beef"!

1210
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,610
I'm not saying the things!

1211
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,583
-Get that? Just shush.
-Can't say "shush."

1212
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:08,709
Okay, Mom,
I can say "shush."

1213
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,685
-You can't say "shush."
-Kebab.

1214
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:12,576
It's kebab.

1215
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,624
It says I can't say "shish"!

1216
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,751
Shish. Shish. Shish.

1217
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:18,619
I'd say it,
I don't have it.

1218
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:21,631
There's this thing
so that I can't see what it is.

1219
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,496
Let's just move on.

1220
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:25,634
Our time's up.

1221
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:29,605
What's this attitude?

1222
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,574
I don't have any.
I've shut down.

1223
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:33,709
She buzzes me,
I'm trying to explain to you...

1224
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:35,745
...how to play the game,
you don't get...

1225
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,543
...the best ways to play
and I'm shutting down.

1226
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,557
I wanna talk to you
about something.

1227
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,704
I know what you want
to talk about.

1228
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:02,705
You do?

1229
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:05,503
I don't want you to apologize
because love...

1230
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,476
...means never having to say
"I'm sorry." You know?

1231
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,444
For the record,
I do forgive you.

1232
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,647
When you're
playing board games...

1233
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,519
...you shouldn't go so
conceptual, go more literal.

1234
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,645
-How else will...?
-No, Brad.

1235
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,654
I took a pregnancy test today.

1236
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:21,680
You took what?

1237
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,559
I took a pregnancy test today.

1238
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,663
At my mom's.
It was in my sister's bag...

1239
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,597
...I was in the bathroom,
I was late...

1240
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:32,568
...and I thought I should
probably take a test.

1241
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,670
-Honey, you pulled the goalie?
-What?

1242
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,739
Can't pull the goalie
without checking.

1243
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,708
I did not. That's not
what this conversation is about.

1244
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,743
What?
What am I missing here?

1245
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:44,747
Relax, Brad. It was negative.
I'm not pregnant.

1246
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:47,717
Why don't you just hit
me with that from the start?

1247
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,753
Instead of making me take laps
around the anxiety pool.

1248
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:52,588
What is this reaction?

1249
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,556
If there's one thing
we've learned...

1250
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,524
...from being
around our families...

1251
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,651
...it's of the dangers
of procreating.

1252
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,697
That's not the things
we want in life.

1253
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,633
Brad, I realized it today.

1254
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,498
I thought
I'd always known...

1255
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,670
...I didn't want to have kids.
Took this test...

1256
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,739
...I'm waiting for
positive or negative...

1257
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,730
...and I thought...
I felt...

1258
01:05:12,608 --> 01:05:15,543
...different. You know?
I felt hopeful.

1259
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,546
Maybe it would happen...

1260
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:20,572
...and we'd be forced
to get over our fears.

1261
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:22,718
We've spent so much time...

1262
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:25,554
...creating these boundaries
and making sure...

1263
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,723
...we don't limit ourselves
with responsibility...

1264
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,487
...and I don't wanna
live like that anymore.

1265
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,685
That's not loving at all.

1266
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,630
-ls that an eighties song?
-No, Brad.

1267
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,633
-An eighties song?
-I'm tired of being one foot in.

1268
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:39,624
I want us to be open,
love each other...

1269
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,737
...however it's going to be.
If it means...

1270
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:43,773
...we get married or
if we have kids...

1271
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,742
...I feel like that's okay.
I wanna be in a relationship...

1272
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,510
...that goes
where it needs to go.

1273
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,615
Okay. I'd like the relationship
to go to Fiji.

1274
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,743
Brad, this is very important.
I wanna have this conversation.

1275
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,688
I don't want to.
I don't wanna have it.

1276
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,756
I feel the same
when we first met.

1277
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,519
I've been honest.

1278
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:04,627
I don't want a conversation
about it...

1279
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,595
...because I don't want
those things.

1280
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:12,701
Okay.

1281
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,561
You don't have
to come in.

1282
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:47,464
I'm not going
to let you go in yourself.

1283
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:49,470
I'll have my sister
drive me back.

1284
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,507
We'll go
and I'll drive you home.

1285
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:52,667
I'm not gonna go
and pretend...

1286
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:55,643
...we're something we're not.
I can't do that anymore.

1287
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:57,646
Listen to me, please.

1288
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:59,682
Let's not overreact to this.

1289
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,549
I'm not overreacting, Brad.
I get it.

1290
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:04,714
I'm the one changing
the rules.

1291
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,613
If you don't want to change
them with me, I understand.

1292
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,460
I just can't do this anymore.

1293
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:45,494
Honey?

1294
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:46,728
Coming in?

1295
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:50,522
Hey, Dad.

1296
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:52,623
She made it!

1297
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,469
Auntie Kate!
Auntie Kate!

1298
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:56,705
Merry Christmas again!

1299
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:58,607
Hi, Kasi.
Merry Christmas.

1300
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:01,508
Come see the cool stuff
Grandpa Creighton got me!

1301
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,509
Okay.

1302
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,748
Hi, I'm Cheryl,
your dad's girlfriend.

1303
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,478
-Nice to finally meet you.
-Excuse me.

1304
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:10,753
-Hey, Kate!
-Hi, Mom.

1305
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,722
I got a Dora the Explorer
backpack...

1306
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,594
...a matching Dora thermos,
a big girl necklace...

1307
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,728
...and princess shoes!

1308
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:21,491
Hey, guys!

1309
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,464
Hi, Auntie Kate.
Where's Brad?

1310
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,604
Kasi, why don't you go
tell grandpa thanks...

1311
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:29,738
...for all your new toys?

1312
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:32,508
You'd better go or
I'm going to tickle.

1313
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:33,475
Go!

1314
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:37,736
This is amazing.

1315
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:39,675
Dad and Mom
in the same room?

1316
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,545
They hated each other.

1317
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:45,610
They've been getting together
for stuff since Kasi turned one.

1318
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,525
It must be really nice
for Kasi.

1319
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,494
It's really nice for everyone.

1320
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:59,668
-Where is Brad?
-He's not going to make it.

1321
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,537
If it's all the same...

1322
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:03,672
...I'd really just rather
not talk about it.

1323
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:05,731
-I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
-It's okay.

1324
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:09,512
It's not something I want
to get into right now.

1325
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:10,706
We won't talk about him.

1326
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:17,450
I have a great idea!
Internet dating.

1327
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:18,744
Do it. It's great.

1328
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:21,683
You just pay 20 bucks,
you put in your profile.

1329
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:24,627
Susan, next door, did it.
She found her husband.

1330
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:25,628
It's great.

1331
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:27,619
He doesn't have a job,
they're on it.

1332
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:28,754
You should do it!

1333
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:31,465
-I'll think about that.
-Yes.

1334
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,499
I'm gonna take a minute.

1335
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:36,500
Okay. I got your back.
Gotcha.

1336
01:09:36,739 --> 01:09:37,706
Thanks.

1337
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:03,630
Hi, kiddo.

1338
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:06,523
Hey, Dad.

1339
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,708
Did Brad leave to get
a jumpstart...

1340
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,676
...on inoculating babies
in Burma?

1341
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:16,745
What?

1342
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:18,679
Maybe he's making
sock monkeys...

1343
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,612
...for foster kids?

1344
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,644
Or weaving ponchos
for pregnant women...

1345
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:24,743
...in the Yucatan?

1346
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,692
So, I guess you knew
we were lying?

1347
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:30,659
Oh, boy.

1348
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:34,763
Unfortunately, I've had
a lot of experience...

1349
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:38,597
...bending the truth
to avoid my family.

1350
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:42,728
And I'll tell you, honey.
I would give anything...

1351
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,673
...to have that time
back again.

1352
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:49,633
I would too.

1353
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:55,616
It's taken me a lot of years...

1354
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:59,745
...and several divorces
to learn that...

1355
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:03,716
...nothing really beats
being honest.

1356
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:08,527
Honest about who you are,
what you need...

1357
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:11,461
...all the rest tends
to work itself out.

1358
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:15,592
I was honest...

1359
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,697
...and I think he was too.

1360
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:21,676
It wasn't
what I wanted to hear.

1361
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:46,769
Cheryl made the dressing...

1362
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:48,737
...and I did some
of the cooking too.

1363
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:51,740
I put the ice cubes
in the glasses...

1364
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:53,640
...and salt
in the saltshakers.

1365
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:55,471
All right, well.

1366
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,573
Not long ago, I wouldn't
have been able...

1367
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,674
...to put this group
of people together...

1368
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,582
...in my wildest imagination.

1369
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,578
The changes we've all
been through...

1370
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,617
...the little hurts
we've given each other...

1371
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,585
...we hope we're forgiven
for them.

1372
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,597
We thank you, dear Lord...

1373
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:21,492
...because there's nothing
more important than family.

1374
01:12:23,539 --> 01:12:24,506
-Amen.
-Amen.

1375
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:25,640
Amen.

1376
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,721
What the hell
do you want?

1377
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:49,690
You forgot your tampons?

1378
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:56,468
I didn't forget anything.

1379
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:00,505
Just came by to see you.

1380
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:01,676
What for?

1381
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,580
You already destroyed
my TV and family room.

1382
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,715
You want to bust up
my kitchen as well?

1383
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,650
Look, I'm sorry
about that, Dad.

1384
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,619
I didn't mean to do all that.

1385
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:12,553
Where's tiny?
She didn't come?

1386
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,557
Kate...

1387
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:18,522
...she's not with me.

1388
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,755
Finally smelled the pathetic
on you, did she?

1389
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,501
No. In fact, she said
she wanted to get...

1390
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:27,696
...more serious with me.
She said that...

1391
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:30,539
...you know,
she loved me...

1392
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:33,575
...wanted to see herself
having a family with me...

1393
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:34,633
...having kids with me.

1394
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:39,511
Congratulations. That's what
you wanted to hear?

1395
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,573
-I said no, Dad.
-You what?

1396
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:47,546
I told her I don't want
to get married.

1397
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,455
Are you shitting me?

1398
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:57,623
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned.

1399
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,462
That's my boy.

1400
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:03,636
I always knew you were
the smart one, Lando.

1401
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:07,539
Your mind and spirit
are strong, like mine.

1402
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:10,612
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1403
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:13,513
It's always the one
you fight with the most...

1404
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:14,708
...who is the most like you.

1405
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:19,688
Why are we standing
out here for?

1406
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:21,656
Let's go inside, have a drink.

1407
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,625
Man to man.
Father to son.

1408
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:25,727
-Right. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1409
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,490
You're a big boy now.

1410
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:29,464
Let's go in.

1411
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,558
Take appraisal of the damage
you've done.

1412
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:41,577
Would anyone like
anything else?

1413
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:44,603
-No, no.
-This one's out.

1414
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,550
Dad, can you check
on Jackson?

1415
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,677
-Yeah. The blanket.
-He's got the pillow.

1416
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:52,515
-This is hers?
-Yeah.

1417
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:10,665
Hey.

1418
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:16,604
Okay, listen.

1419
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:20,538
If you get one, get two
because they're like dogs.

1420
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,512
-What are you talking about?
-Kids.

1421
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:25,673
If you leave one by itself,
you'll never leave.

1422
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,550
You'll feel guilty
being there by itself.

1423
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,745
With two,
they got someone to play with.

1424
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:32,721
The other big thing
is school.

1425
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:35,591
A private school?
Then you got sweater vests...

1426
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,594
...and lacrosse coming at you.
But in a public school...

1427
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,687
...there's an older student,
who's hyperactive...

1428
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,765
...hopped up on medication,
and will try to shank the guy.

1429
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,567
That's uncomfortable.

1430
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:48,737
Are you having this conversation
'cause you're comfortable?

1431
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:51,607
Or because
you wanna go to Fiji?

1432
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,665
I wanna go to Fiji.

1433
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:54,643
The tickets are paid for...

1434
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:56,678
...and hotel rooms
aren't transferable.

1435
01:16:56,678 --> 01:17:00,549
But, honey,
I do feel comfortable now...

1436
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:03,484
...having this conversation
because in my heart...

1437
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,611
...I know I've found
the one person in life...

1438
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:08,520
...that I want to have
these conversations with.

1439
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,716
And that person's you.

1440
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,593
-I love you so much.
-Come here.

1441
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,570
This, like, doesn't mean
we're getting married...

1442
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,470
-...or having kids right away.
-No.

1443
01:17:23,538 --> 01:17:25,741
But we should talk,
because these things happen.

1444
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:29,472
Not that we're planning on it.
We're talking; that happens.

1445
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:31,747
And if we do have them,
then, you know...

1446
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,750
-...there's a lot of advantages.
-Yeah. They're wonderful.

1447
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,652
They make you feel love.

1448
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,745
Also, they're little
walking tax shelters.

1449
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:40,716
You can write a lot
of stuff off.

1450
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:43,485
Yeah, and the yard work.
You save money.

1451
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:46,528
At a certain age, you can have
them on the lawnmower.

1452
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:48,597
-When they're seven.
-Not slave labor.

1453
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,599
-No, no.
-It's teaching discipline.

1454
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:53,535
-Chores for money.
-We're not planning the future.

1455
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:56,605
We would've ended up in a
home playing Bingo in Florida.

1456
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:57,731
Now we can live
with them.

1457
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:01,543
-They'll take us in.
-Exciting. I never thought it.

1458
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:03,512
Feel comfortable
to talk to me...

1459
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,605
...about anything you want
to talk about.

1460
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:09,550
Unless there's, like,
a playoff game.

1461
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:11,619
We can find
an appropriate time.

1462
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,520
-I'm kidding. Kind of.
-Okay.

1463
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,580
Just to be clear,
this doesn't mean...

1464
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:18,527
...we're getting married
soon...

1465
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,586
...or having kids right away.
But we're open...

1466
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:22,687
...to let love grow
where it wants to grow.

1467
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:25,494
-Exactly.
-We're open to letting it grow.

1468
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:26,556
Doesn't mean kids.

1469
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:32,496
-I can't believe we did it.
-We did.

1470
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:36,611
I don't know what happened,
or the procedure...

1471
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:39,514
...but here's this beautiful
thing here. You know?

1472
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:41,650
I did feel
like an air traffic controller.

1473
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:44,585
Between the huffs,
and the signals and stuff...

1474
01:18:44,653 --> 01:18:46,518
...it just kind of
all happened.

1475
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,480
It's awesome, baby.
You're so awesome.

1476
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,526
You were amazing.
You were like this.

1477
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:53,662
-Thanks, babe.
-We have a baby!

1478
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:56,498
-How's she doing?
-Good. Sleeping.

1479
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:59,534
I just wanted to let you and
our new year's baby know...

1480
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:01,729
...that you're welcome
to bring family members now.

1481
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:04,495
-That won't happen.
-No, no family.

1482
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:06,733
Your families don't know?

1483
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:10,545
I think they'd be shocked
to hear Kate was pregnant.

1484
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:12,547
Our families
can be a little much.

1485
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,516
I like to think that we're
keeping it special for us...

1486
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,619
...rather than not
including them.

1487
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:18,745
Happy New Year, Bay Area!

1488
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,523
We're here live
at Pacific General...

1489
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:23,625
...where the first baby,
has just been born!

1490
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:26,458
Let's go say hello
to those lucky parents!

1491
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,597
Congratulations,
McVie family...

1492
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,699
...on having the first baby
of the New Year!

1493
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:32,462
Dad, how does it feel?

1494
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,468
We're doing great.

1495
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:43,633
There was... a vacuum.

1496
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:46,639
And then there was...

1497
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:50,552
...stretching and juices.

1498
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:53,655
What he's trying to say is
we're just beyond words excited.

1499
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:55,680
Oh, goodness.

1500
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:00,586
I got some in my mouth!

1501
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:03,656
I can't be around it!
I'm gonna do it too!
