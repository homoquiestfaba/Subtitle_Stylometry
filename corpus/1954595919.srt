1
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:18,760
- All right, Slate. Show time.

2
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:21,024
- You sure you don't wanna
go for a swim?

3
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:23,998
- Tariq told me to tell you
come back with the gold

4
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,797
or don't come back at all.

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,498
- Well, I don't think we gotta
worry about Tariq.

6
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:31,542
- No one's ever found anything
down there before.

7
00:00:31,643 --> 00:00:33,771
What makes you think
you're any different?

8
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:36,474
- Well, the Blue hole is a
bottomless pit.

9
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:38,141
Not even Cousteau can
swim the bottom.

10
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:41,984
But I can. And he
didn't have these.

11
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:43,818
- Sonars, guns, and C4.

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,859
You're gonna bury yourself
underthe sea floor and silt.

13
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,556
- Well, then I won't have to
deal with Tariq, will I?

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,724
You'll have to face him alone
and without the gold.

15
00:01:02,544 --> 00:01:04,672
( heavy breathing )

16
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:18,828
- Hey, mon, it's getting
cold over here.

17
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:24,494
- Let's keep going. The
shelf's straight ahead.

18
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:26,662
( Sonar pinging )

19
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:32,911
- It's not working.

20
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:37,717
- All right, let's head down.

21
00:01:37,784 --> 00:01:39,945
- I don't like this at all.

22
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:48,355
- How much farther?

23
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:51,194
- I'm gonna look for a spot
to set the charges.

24
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:52,427
It's where it's buried.

25
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:56,062
Cortez should be right
underneath it.

26
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:57,799
( static )

27
00:02:07,285 --> 00:02:11,244
- Okay, come here. Bring
me the charges.

28
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:18,894
I'll plant a few charges here.

29
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,761
You guys set the perimeter.

30
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:32,773
I need you goin' off
to the left.

31
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:34,643
- Let's go.

32
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,656
All right, mon. we are
set over here.

33
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:52,030
- That's what I like.

34
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:53,261

- This place is so gorgeous.

75
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:46,630
- What'd I tell you? Just wait.

76
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,564

little surprise in store.

But it's perfectly safe.
Trust me.

- Why do I need to be
reassured that it's safe?

80
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:00,209
- Come on. Can you
just chill out?

81
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:03,217
Relax and enjoy the view.
Look where we are.

82
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:06,448
This is amazing. It's gorgeous.

83
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:08,490
- We are gonna have

84
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:11,651

get checked in.

85

- Hi, Henry. How are you?

87
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,916
- Good, good.
- Good.

88
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,511
- Today is going to be a
beautiful day.

89
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,681
You heading back out to the
barrier reef today?

90
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,783
- Um, it depends.
You available?

91
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,829
I need some samples
for the lab.

92
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:46,627
- I'm actually takin' a couple
out here in the boat an hour.

93
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,191
Just snorkelin', though.

94
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,100
But I'm free for diving
this afternoon.

95
00:07:51,172 --> 00:07:52,196
One p.m. work?

96
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,364
- One p.m. is perfect.

97
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,705
- Good. See you then.

98
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:03,209
- Babe, let's go!
- I'm coming.

99
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,844
- Ready?
- Yeah.

100
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:09,358
So why didn't we spend the week
on the mainland again?

101
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:10,655
- You didn't like the
Mayan ruins?

102
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:12,195
- No, I liked it.

103
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:14,128
It's just seven days of
nonstop hiking is not

104
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:16,689
my idea of a vacation.

105
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:20,465
- You helped me plan this trip.

106
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,234
Okay, fine.

107
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,205
You get to choose all the things
we do next time.

108
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:26,677
- Oh, what makes you so sure
there's gonna be a next time?

109
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:29,977
We ought to stay here and hang
out with the locals.

110
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:33,577
- Really? You're hilarious,
you know that?

111
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,484
Are you ready to
snorkel or what?

112
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,148
( fog horn blares )

113
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,653
- Henry, right?
- Rod, yes.

114
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,992
- Hi, I'm Jane.

115
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,554
- Hey, nice to meet you guys.

116
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:45,860
- Nice to meet you too. I
hope we're not late.

117
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:47,401
- Not at all.

118
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:49,165
So you guys ready to go
snorkel at the Blue Hole?

119
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,706
- Yeah, man, yeah. We're
both really excited.

120
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:53,105
- The Blue Hole?

121
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,871
- Yes, the Blue Hole.
Welcome on board.

122
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:56,878
- Thanks.

123
00:08:56,947 --> 00:08:58,938
- Yes.

124
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,721
- So who here has gone
snorkeling before?

125
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,224
Not like this, you haven't.

126
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,884
Snorkeling at the
Lighthouse Reef

127
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,556
is unlike snorkeling
anywhere else on earth.

128
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:17,364
And if you're really daring,
you can swim across
the Blue Hole.

129
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:18,960
Most people are not.

130
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:22,303
Now the ride to the reef is
about an hour from here.

131
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:26,242
So I suggest you just relax
and enjoy the ride.

132
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,110
- What is the Blue Hole?

133
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:32,380
- It's a huge sinkhole about
three foot five feet across.

134
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:33,647
And six down.

135
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:35,552
- And you knew about this?

136
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:38,559
- You're gonna love it.
You're gonna love it.

137
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:40,322
- You're gonna love it.

138
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:41,656
- Turn on some music, Jibuti.

I don't know if he's conscious,
unconscious or what.

169
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:17,264
- We gotta get him out
of the water.

170
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:20,002
Start the engine.

171
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:34,924
There he is.

172

00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:03,515
- Is he alive?

174
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:07,790
- He's breathing, barely.

175
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:11,890
He's got a pulse. It's
kind of weak.

176
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,401
He probably had a concussion,
maybe even the bends.

177
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:17,064
We probably better get
him to a hospital.

178
00:13:17,173 --> 00:13:21,008
- No, no hospitals.

179
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:22,705
- We can take him back
to our place.

180
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,907
- Well, shouldn't a professional
come and look at him?

181
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:28,213
- I know someone we can call.

182
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:34,548
- Oh. what do you make of that?

183
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,257
- Why them boy take so long?

184
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:08,695
They should have been
back by now.

185
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,359
Find out what happened.

186
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,427
Slate double-crossed me again.

187
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:20,444
This time, he must pay
with his life.

188
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:22,605
- Let's go.

189
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
( groans )

190
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:36,284
- Hey, guys, he's waking up.

191
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:43,595
- Where am I? Who are you guys?

192
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:46,162
- We found you out there by the
reef barely breathing.

193
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:47,639
We gave you CPR.

194
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:48,835
But wasn't sure if you
were gonna make it

195
00:14:48,943 --> 00:14:50,069
for a second there.

196
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:51,737
- You gave me CPR?

197
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:54,578
- You woke up just long enough
to say ''no hospitals''.

198
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,311
So we brought you back
here to this hotel.

199
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:58,853
I'm Sarah, this is Henry.

200
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:00,513
He called me from the
boat to meet you.

201
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:02,091
And this is their place.

202
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,423
They were on the boat with Henry.

203
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:07,258
Thanks, you guys. I'm Jackson.

204
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,697
Most people just call me Jacks.

205
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,995
- All right, Jacks.
How's the head?

206
00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:14,970
- Drink the local fruit wine,
you'll figure it out.

207
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,305
I think I'll survive.

208
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,106
- So you wanna tell us what
happened out there?

209
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:23,012
- Uh, not really, no.

210
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:26,449
- What about this? You wanna
tell us about this?

211
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,285
( grunts )

212
00:15:30,356 --> 00:15:34,020
- Now I am going to ask
you one more time.

213
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:37,461
Where is Tariq's money?

214
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:40,558
- I don't know.

215
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:44,230
( grunts )

216
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,674
Oh, man, you been workin' out.
I actually felt that one.

217
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:50,041
Ah!

218
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,987
( gunshot )

219
00:15:58,055 --> 00:15:59,579
Hey! Hey!

220
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,889
- Now I'm going to ask
you one more time.

221
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,897
Where is Tariq's money?

222
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,523
- We didn't find anything,
all right?

223
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,001
We went into the jungle. There
was no Mayan gold.

224
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,560
No nothing, just death.

225
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,333
- I tell you what I think.

226
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,273
I think that you found exactly
what you were looking for

227
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,572
and decided to keep it
for yourself.

228
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,546
and kill our men!

229
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,583
You better start making sense.

230
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,083
Then where is it?

231
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:29,350
- It's at the bottom of
the Blue Hole.

232
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,584
- What the hell are you
talking about?

233
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:35,687
- I'm talking about
Spanish gold.

234
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:37,561
( laughter )

235
00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:45,603
- He's talking about Mayan
gold, the gold that

236
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:48,975
the Governor Cortez stole from
the native people.

237
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,879
No one has found it. No one
knows where it is.

238
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,285
- I know where it is.

239
00:16:57,355 --> 00:17:02,054
- All right, but I warn you.

240
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:04,426
You try anything, Slate,
anything at all,

241
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,488
I will put a bullet
in your head

242
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,067
and bury you in that
hole myself.

243
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:12,902
- Okay, I get it, I get it.

244
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:15,567
I found it snorkeling.

245
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:18,338
It's amazing what people
leave behind, huh?

246
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:20,175
- You mean, like the Mayans?

247
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:22,408
- I dove to the bottom of
the Blue Hole.

248
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:26,351
- You went to the bottom? what
else did you find?

249
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:32,656
Hey, look, man.

250
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:34,195
You don't have to tell us
anything you don't want to.

251
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:35,457
But I'm sure the police
will find this

252
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,295
all pretty interesting.

253
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:40,928
- Well, I don't wanna
involve you guys

254
00:17:41,004 --> 00:17:42,266
in anything too dangerous.

255
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:49,776
But if you really wanna know...

256
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:53,443
Get me a beer and let's go outside.

257
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:02,823
( phone rings )

258
00:18:02,895 --> 00:18:05,455
- Yes, boss?
- Any sign of them boys?

259
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:07,329
- No, boss, but the port here

260
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:10,199
around the Blue Hole shut
down and are locked.

261
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,503
The Coast Guard in there. They
find a boat missing.

262
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:17,807
Wreck smashed off the rocks.
Passengers presumed dead.

263
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,369
What else you want me to do?

264
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:21,312
- I want you to keep looking
until you find them,

265
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,750
or their bodies.

266
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,186
- Yes, boss. Raul, let's go.

267
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:33,396
- So you're saying you owe this
Tariq guy a lot of money

268
00:18:33,463 --> 00:18:34,589
and you were gonna pay him
off with the gold?

269
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,063
- Oh, forget Tariq.

270
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:37,601
As far as he knows, I'm
already dead.

271
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:40,865
That gold's still out there.
Tell you what.

272
00:18:40,938 --> 00:18:43,065
I'm willing to cut you in if
you guys help me find it.

273
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:46,077
- Aren't you
forgetting something?

274
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:49,012
Someone out there did
kill those men.

275
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:51,072
And if it wasn't you, then we
should be worried

276
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,745
about who or what.

277
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,720
- What do you mean, or what?

278
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:58,758
- I mean, right now we
don't know anything.

279
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:00,384
But Dr. Jones here has been
setting off charges

280
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:01,860
in Blue Hole.

281
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:03,556
So who knows what the hell
he's unearthed?

282
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:05,292
- What exactly are you saying?

283
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,697
- I'm saying I'm in.

284
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:09,464
I don't care about
the Spanish gold

285
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:10,970
or lost treasure.

286
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:14,064
I just wanna know what's
out there.

287
00:19:14,142 --> 00:19:16,134
- I care about the gold.

288
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:18,042
- Yes, me too. - Rod?

289
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:19,581
- Count me in.

290
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:21,583
Listen, we came out here to
dive that hole anyways.

291
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:26,112
And now I see more reasons
to go...a lot more.

292
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,556
I say we go for the gold.

293
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,256
- The police will be
patrolling the air

294
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:34,798
between here and the reef.

295
00:19:34,866 --> 00:19:36,800
- Well, we'll have to go the
long way around.

296
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:38,062
Half Moon Key, huh?

297
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,798
Help me with the rest of this.

298
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:54,417
( phone rings )

299
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:57,617
- Any sign of Edric
and the others?

300
00:19:57,692 --> 00:19:59,421
- No, boss, only Slate.

301
00:19:59,494 --> 00:20:01,655
And he's going out with some
different people.

302
00:20:01,729 --> 00:20:03,129
None of we people.

303
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:04,597
- That bastard has
double-crossed us

304
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,258
for the last time.

305
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,700
You know what to do!

306
00:20:07,803 --> 00:20:09,532
- Yes, boss, and the
rest of them?

307
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:13,200
- No witnesses, not one
to tell the tale.

308
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:16,540
- Yes, boss.

309
00:20:16,646 --> 00:20:20,481
When they curl Half Moon Key,
we're gonna wait for them.

310
00:20:20,551 --> 00:20:21,848
Let's go.

311
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:28,051
- Rod? A word?

312
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,359
Are we seriously going
through with this?

313
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,401
I mean, I don't wanna die on
some wild goose chase

314
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,969
for some lost treasure.

315
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,527
Did you forget the part
where some gangsters

316
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:40,903
are trying to kill him?

317
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:43,033
Or, like she said, there
could be something

318
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,873
out there that's even
worse than them.

319
00:20:44,945 --> 00:20:46,913
Stop acting like you're
in "The Goonies".

320
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:47,878
( chuckles )

321
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:49,246
- "The Goonies"?   Listen.

322
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,250
I think that you need
to calm down.

323
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:52,751
Change your mind and
come with us.

324
00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:54,151
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

325
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:56,384
- No, Rod, I want us to
stay together.

326
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,358
Otherwise, I'm gonna go
back to the hotel

327
00:20:58,427 --> 00:21:00,657
and you can have your little
adventure on your own.

328
00:21:00,729 --> 00:21:03,061
- Listen, I hear you.

329
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:05,033
I just think it's a little bit
too late for that.

330
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:07,001
We're already set, loaded up,
and ready to go.

331
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,935
There could be a lot of
gold out there.

332
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,737
- Look, if you go on that dive,

333
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,835
I'm gonna be really upset.

334
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:19,708
- I'm gonna go.

335
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:23,118
We'll see you back at
the hotel, okay?

336
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,403
- Is it just me?

337
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:39,769
The woman doesn't look too
happy with you.

338
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,740
- Yep.
- Don't worry.

339
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,439
She'll be a lot happier when
you bring back the gold, huh?

340
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,038
- That's the plan.

341
00:21:57,593 --> 00:21:59,994
- Raul, here they come!
See them there?

342
00:22:00,097 --> 00:22:02,156
Get ready for the shot!

343
00:22:06,304 --> 00:22:09,831
Now remember, when
they get close,

344
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:11,568
we'll pull up side of them.

345
00:22:11,643 --> 00:22:15,774
I say hello and then goodbye.

346
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:21,687
( rumbling )

347
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:23,779
- Whoa!

348
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:30,660
- Something out there!
Something big!

349
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:33,791
( growling )

350
00:22:33,868 --> 00:22:35,495
- Start up the boat, boy!
Start up the boat!

351
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:38,334
Let's go! Let's go!

352
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:41,604
Come on, boy! - I'm trying!

353
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:43,836
( gunfire )

354
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:45,039
( screaming )

355
00:22:51,854 --> 00:22:53,652
- Hurry, boy, hurry!

356
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,621
( gunshots, screaming)

357
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:04,501
- Hey! You guys see
that up ahead?

358
00:23:04,569 --> 00:23:09,633
There!

359
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:13,042
- Hey, there's some wreckage
out there!

360
00:23:13,112 --> 00:23:15,046
Check that out, take me to it.

361
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:45,238
- Just like before.

362
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:47,341
Another wrecked boat with no
sign of survivors.

363
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:49,443
Not even any bodies.

364
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,522
- What the hell is goin' on?

365
00:23:57,462 --> 00:24:00,022
- This is the Coast Guard.
Remain where you are!

366
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:02,624
- Damn!
- Great.

367
00:24:02,735 --> 00:24:06,865
We got visitors.

368
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:08,736
- Prepare to be boarded.

369
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:15,545
You people wanna tell me what
the hell you're doing out here?

370
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,810
You got a name?

371
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:19,045
- Who's asking?
- Cut the bullshit.

372
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,712
I wanna know who you people are

373
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:23,223
and what you are doing at
the Blue Hole.

374
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,815
- Blue Hole?

375
00:24:24,926 --> 00:24:26,554
- Don't play dumb with me.

376
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:29,223
That boat of yours had a
registered dive

377
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,823
out at the hole at nine
this morning.

378
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:34,301
And then there's this.

379
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:37,397
You fancy yourselves some kind
of treasure hunter?

380
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:39,772
- Look, you can't keep us here.

381
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:41,607
We haven't done anything wrong.

382
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,739
- Where do you think you are?
You think this is the U.S.?

383
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,842
I've got two boats destroyed.
Covered in blood.

384
00:24:47,952 --> 00:24:50,478
Maybe you did find something.

385
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,423
And maybe you killed your
friend over it.

386
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,154
- Okay, look. My name's
Jackson Slate.

387
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,687
I was diving the Blue Hole to
see what I could salvage.

388
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,357
The last thing I remember,
there was an earthquake.

389
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,991
When I came to, these
people rescued me.

390
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:05,971
We decided to come back out
here and investigate.

391
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,439
And that's when we found this.

392
00:25:07,508 --> 00:25:10,306
- Look, we've got a
real problem here

393
00:25:10,377 --> 00:25:13,176
and I think you know damn
well it isn't us.

394
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:16,012
- In all my years
working these parts,

395
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:20,181
I have never seen
anything like this.

396
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:21,848
- Oh, my God!

397
00:25:21,924 --> 00:25:26,327
- Let alone twice in one
goddamned day.

398
00:25:26,395 --> 00:25:27,522
Not even drug runners.

399
00:25:27,598 --> 00:25:28,963
- This wasn't drug runners.

400
00:25:29,032 --> 00:25:31,728
This was bitten off by
something big,

401
00:25:31,835 --> 00:25:33,325
something really big.

402
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:35,895
- Whatever it is, it's big enough

403
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:38,066
to tear a dive boat to shreds.

404
00:25:38,176 --> 00:25:39,700
- We need to have an advisory

405
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:42,644
and tell the people to stay
out of the water.

406
00:25:42,714 --> 00:25:43,704
- We need to go into
that Blue Hole.

407
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:45,181
Think about it.

408
00:25:45,251 --> 00:25:46,809
This all started after he
went down there.

409
00:25:46,886 --> 00:25:48,547
Maybe he disturbed something.

410
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:50,681
We need to khow what
we're dealing with

411
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,725
while we can still do
something about it.

412
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,692
- All right, Slate.

413
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,093
Look like you get to go
back and hunt

414
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:58,756
for your lost
treasure after all.

415
00:25:58,866 --> 00:25:59,924
- Yeah. What about.. .

416
00:26:00,034 --> 00:26:04,232
- Sorry. Property of Belize.

417
00:26:04,305 --> 00:26:07,332
- At least you know
where there's more.

418
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:11,679
- Any word from Rafa and Raul?

419
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:13,578
- Nothing yet, big man.

420
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:16,175
- If they are not back by sundown,

421
00:26:16,252 --> 00:26:18,015
I'll find Jackson Slate myself

422
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:20,055
and skin him and his friends alive!

423
00:26:20,123 --> 00:26:21,887
( cocks gun )

424
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,426
- So, Jackson, you left
out a few details

425
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:28,021
when you were talking
to the police.

426
00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:29,930
What do you think really
happened down there?

427
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:34,768
- Honestly, I think Tariq's
guys blew the charges early

428
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,739
and left me for dead.

429
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:38,401
But somebody came back and
took care of them.

430
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:41,241
I'm sure you got a
different theory.

431
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:43,612
- Yeah. All I know is there's
something out there

432
00:26:43,683 --> 00:26:44,946
destroying boats.

433
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:46,815
And we just happen to
be on a boat.

434
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,582
- These guys got plenty of
gun power and sonar.

435
00:26:49,656 --> 00:26:51,453
Anything comes at 'em, I'm sure
they'll take care of it.

436
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:53,790
- Tell me, how did
you get involved

437
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:55,658
with those low-life
gangsters anyway?

438
00:26:55,763 --> 00:26:58,891
And were you really gonna pay
them back the gold?

439
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:02,734
- Of course...probably.

440
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:04,773
- Probably not.

441
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,102
( chuckles )

00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:07,642

- Hey, what's up, guys?
- Oh, nothin'.

453
00:27:32,872 --> 00:27:34,806
We're just down here in Belize
for training right now.

454
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:36,774
Just kind of drinkin', relaxin'.
Kickin' with the locals.

455
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:38,504
I don't know if
you're interested.

456
00:27:38,578 --> 00:27:41,275
But my buddy, he's got a boat
right down the beach.

457
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:42,872
You wanna join us? - A boat?

458
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:44,351
- Yeah. Would you like to see it?

459
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:46,319
- Uh, no, I shouldn't.

460
00:27:46,387 --> 00:27:48,356
- Aw, come on. You can lay out.

461
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:50,687
And we'll drink tons of
champagne, have some caviar.

462
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:52,454
- You guys are full of shit.

463
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:55,463
- You'll never know unless you go.

464
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:01,029
- All right, yeah.

465
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:05,670
So what kind of boat is this?

466
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:06,343
- Sure you boys don't
wanna go for a swim?

467
00:28:06,343 --> 00:28:08,675
- Sure you boys don't
wanna go for a swim?

468
00:28:08,745 --> 00:28:12,147
- Ha! I don't get paid enough
to do anything this crazy.

469
00:28:12,216 --> 00:28:13,706
- All right.

470
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:17,050
Well, just keep a lookout,
will you?

471
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:18,214
- Good luck.

472
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,020
- Thank you.

473
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:28,696
You afraid of the dark?

474
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:31,362
- Not of the dark. Just
what's in it.

475
00:28:31,438 --> 00:28:34,203
- I told you what's in it.
Spanish gold.

476
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:36,573
- Woo-hoo! Yeah, baby.

477
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:40,444
- Or in some people's opinion,
Mayan gold.

478
00:28:40,548 --> 00:28:43,245
Gotta tell you, it's
not what's in it

479
00:28:43,318 --> 00:28:44,842
that you gotta be afraid of.

480
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,115
When you get down to
about 200 feet,

481
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:48,884
the pressure's gonna be so bad
it's gonna make your chest

482
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:50,858
feel like it's gonna explode.

483
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:55,091
Get down to 300, nitrogen
narcosis kicks in,

484
00:28:55,164 --> 00:28:56,757
you're gonna feel dizzy.

485
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,893
You're gonna think that you might
be seeing some things.

486
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:02,803
But it's nothing compared to
when you get down to 400 feet.

487
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:05,535
- You know what, Jacks? why
don't you save it?

488
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,636
- You panic and come up too
fast, you're gonna die.

489
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:14,379
So just breathe normal
and don't panic.

490
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,080
If any of you guys feel like
you need to back out now,

491
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:20,752
now's the time to tell me.

492
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:22,590
( chuckles )

493
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:27,065
- Jacks, I'm not really one to
back out of things ever.

494
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:29,330
But I think it'd be a good idea
to keep a man onboard

495
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:31,166
and keep an eye on things.

496
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:35,642
Make sure you guys are safe
while you're down there diving.

497
00:29:35,711 --> 00:29:39,442
So I think I'm gonna sit
this one out, huh?

498
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:41,312
- Yeah, sure.

499
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:44,114
- Hey, hey!

500
00:29:44,187 --> 00:29:46,985
I'll still get my cut, though,
right?

501
00:29:47,056 --> 00:29:48,318
- Yeah.

502
00:29:48,391 --> 00:29:50,359
- All right. You're a good man.

503
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:52,156
Good luck, man.

504
00:30:00,572 --> 00:30:02,267
( sonar pings )

505
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:25,222
- Shelf's right up ahead here.
Get ready to go down.

506
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:37,307
Is everyone all right?

507
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,371
- Getting deeper now.

508
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:41,508
( static )

509
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:58,335
- There's the Cortez in
her final glory.

510
00:31:01,274 --> 00:31:03,834
Okay, you guys follow me,
all right?

511
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,208
Let's go forward.

512
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,907
- Okay, I'll follow you.

513
00:31:15,322 --> 00:31:18,417
- See those?

514
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:22,452
- These are dinosaur
footprints, I think!

515
00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:32,640
Look at the eggs!

516
00:31:35,846 --> 00:31:38,748
We've got to take one
back to the lab!

517
00:31:38,816 --> 00:31:41,444
- Okay.

518
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:10,312
I've seen enough. Let's
get outta here.

519
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:13,852
( screams )

520
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:16,287
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

521
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:17,656
- Relax.

522
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,490
You all right?

523
00:32:21,497 --> 00:32:22,828
Okay?

524
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,266
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

525
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:38,538
- You guys all right?

526
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,208
You were down there for a
long time, ma'am.

527
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:41,877
I thought we lost you.

528
00:32:41,987 --> 00:32:43,545
- You nearly did.

529
00:32:43,656 --> 00:32:45,817
- Yeah.

530
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:47,449
We ran into my old crew down there.

531
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:50,519
They were torn apart,
trampled or something.

532
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:52,121
- What else did you guys
see down there?

533
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:54,895
- We saw footprints, big ones.

534
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:56,867
- Well, did you see what left them?

535
00:32:56,938 --> 00:32:59,372
- No, but we found this.

536
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,466
- What the hell's that?

537
00:33:02,543 --> 00:33:05,012
- It's what I intend
to find out.

538
00:33:08,584 --> 00:33:10,313
- The advisory is still in effect.

539
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:11,820
Stay out of the water.

540
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:13,913
- I better go try to find Jane.

541
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:15,388
She's probably worried about me.

542
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,756
- I still give you guys a
ride to the mainland

543
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:19,523
once he opens up the harbor.

544
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,757
- Hey, Jacks.

545
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,162
Wanna come back to the lab with me?

546
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,530
I could use an assistant.

547
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,263
- Uh, sure.
- Great.

548
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,405
- Hey, you still owe me a
refund for that ride, man.

549
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,876
- Hey, I did take you guys out.

550
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,538
You know where to find me.

551
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:49,388
- Yes, boss? It's me.
I found Slate.

552
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:54,731
He's with the Marine Biologist.
I'll keep an eye on them.

553
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:12,885
- I'm not crazy, that's a
big ass egg, right?

554
00:34:12,956 --> 00:34:14,254
- You're not crazy.

555
00:34:14,325 --> 00:34:17,123
But it's time we
should look inside.

556
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:22,156
( beeping )

557
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:27,466
- God, what are we lookin' at?

558
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:29,474
- No, it couldn't be.

559
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:33,103
This has all the traits of being
some kind of dinosaur!

560
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,079
An ancestor maybe?
I don't know.

561
00:34:35,148 --> 00:34:36,080
- You mean, like the extinct kind?

562
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:37,617
- Well, not entirely.

563
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:39,448
I mean, technically
crocodiles are dinosaurs.

564
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,283
Birds too.

565
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:42,652
- So you're sayin' there's more
of these out there?

566
00:34:42,723 --> 00:34:44,350
- It would seem so.

567
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,360
- And how big do you
think it might be?

568
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:49,453
- I mean, based on the size
of the footprints

569
00:34:49,531 --> 00:34:51,328
and the fact that it tore
apart two dive boats

570
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:54,494
like it was nothing, I'd say at
least 40 to 50 feet tall.

571
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,037
But to learn more, we're gonna
have to crack her open.

572
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:57,765
- Okay. You need some
help with that?

573
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,366
- Just don't break anything. -
Hey, you got any beer?

574
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:02,172
- Right in the
fridge over there.

575
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:13,182
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

576
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:16,626
- It's your beer.
- I mean, from before.

577
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:19,459
We would have died down there
had it not been for you.

578
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:21,500
- You wouldn't have been out
there unless it was for me.

579
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:24,230
- Well, that's true.

580
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,532
Now I want you to make
yourself useful.

581
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:29,575
Put this on.

582
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:31,474
- Do you really think all
this is necessary?

583
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,343
- And these gloves.

584
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:37,316
You've seen "Alien", right? Can
never be too careful.

585
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:50,722
- Okay, what do you
want me to do?

586
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,165
- That'd be great.

587
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:53,532
Now I want you to hold it
just like this.

588
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:56,596
Nice and straight. Very, very,
very gentle.

589
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:58,334
Nice and steady.

590
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:00,741
I'm just gonna chip the top.

591
00:36:08,553 --> 00:36:11,045
- Oh, God, that's awful.
what is that?

592
00:36:11,123 --> 00:36:13,091
- It's hydrogen
sulfide and methane.

593
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:16,458
A bit pungent, but nothing
you can't handle.

594
00:36:22,402 --> 00:36:23,300
( hisses )

595
00:36:23,403 --> 00:36:24,631
Careful. Not too close.

596
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:25,763
- Come on, it's eyes are closed.

597
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,205
I'm just gonna--

598
00:36:27,275 --> 00:36:28,537
Whoa! Whoa!

599
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,077
- Oh! Oh!

600
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:31,873
- Bring me the--
- ( growling )

601
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:33,209
- The what?
- Right behind you.

602
00:36:33,282 --> 00:36:34,306
It's a sedative.
Right behind you.

603
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:35,713
- Which one?

604
00:36:35,784 --> 00:36:36,876
- It's the one with
the green top.

605
00:36:36,952 --> 00:36:37,884
- Okay?
- Give me three cc's.

606
00:36:37,953 --> 00:36:39,113
- How much is that?

607
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:41,282
- Just fill it up. Hurry, hurry!

608
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:45,454
Come on, Jacks!
- Okay, okay!

609
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:47,393
- Okay, set it down.
- Okay.

610
00:36:47,464 --> 00:36:51,333
- Grab the forceps. One, two,
three.

611
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:52,663
- Oh!

612
00:36:54,772 --> 00:36:56,604
- Where is it? Where'd it go?

613
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,302
- I don't know.
- Do you see it?

614
00:36:58,377 --> 00:37:00,436
- Jacks, look in the corner by
the file cabinet!

615
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:01,979
- Where? Where?

616
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:03,071
- Oh, my God. Just be careful.

617
00:37:03,148 --> 00:37:04,309
- I got it.
- Careful.

618
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,476
- I got it.
- Careful !

619
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:10,420
- I got it.
- Oh, my God.

620
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,857
I'll get it.

621
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,257
Open the freezer, Jacks.
Open the freezer!

622
00:37:14,328 --> 00:37:15,522
- Okay.

623
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:21,527
( panting )

624
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:24,605
- Oh, my God, that was close.

625
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:38,312
- See, babe? I'm an
honest soul.

626
00:37:38,388 --> 00:37:41,687
- Yeah, right.
Could be worse, though.

627
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:44,159
- Couldn't get much better,
though, could it?

628
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,160
It's not that bad, is it?

629
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,719
- What are you doing?

630
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:47,991
- What, babe? I thought you
came here to party.

631
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,695
- I did. I just need
another Mimosa.

632
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,168
- All right, babe. I'll
be right back.

633
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:53,795
- Thanks.

634
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:09,179
( reggae music playing )

635
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:16,430
- Here you go.

636
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:19,022
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

637
00:38:21,471 --> 00:38:22,563
- Hey, can we stop
for a second?

638
00:38:22,638 --> 00:38:24,367
- What? What's wrong?

639
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,171
Hey, if you wanna go downstairs
to be more private, we can.

640
00:38:28,244 --> 00:38:30,179
- Look, dude, it's just not
gonna happen, okay?

641
00:38:30,247 --> 00:38:34,775
I have a boyfriend. I think
this party's over.

642
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:37,582
- Party's gotta end sometime,
doesn't it?

643
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,725
( screams )

644
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:53,362
- Help! Help!

645
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,771
- Oh, great.
- ( screams )

646
00:38:54,841 --> 00:38:56,308
- I guess I'll go.
- Forget it, man.

647
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:00,107
( screams )

648
00:39:00,181 --> 00:39:02,741
( shouting, screaming )

649
00:39:07,923 --> 00:39:09,220
( shouting )

650
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:14,455
- Hey, what's goin' on?

651
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:18,729
Hey, did you see what happened?

652
00:39:18,802 --> 00:39:20,599
Hey, hey, excuse me. Hey,
can I see these?

653
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,072
Thank you, thank you.

654
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:25,802
What the--?

655
00:39:25,876 --> 00:39:28,504
- It's coming!
- Go, go, go!

656
00:39:28,612 --> 00:39:30,911
( screams )

657
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:34,975
- Here. Henry!

658
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:36,452
Man, I need you to get
me out there!

659
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:38,752
- Sure. Yo, unchock the
boat real quick!

660
00:39:38,825 --> 00:39:40,190
- See the wreckage out there?
The boat?

661
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:42,420
Get us out there wide open.
Let's go!

662
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:50,593
Hey, when we get out there,
man, you keep your eyes peeled.

663
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:52,696
- Look at that.

664
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:07,682
- Predator X?

665
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:10,282
- 50 feet long and 100,000 pounds.

666
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,158
Four times more powerful than
the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

667
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:16,893
But this one had flippers.
It's not our guy.

668
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,060
- Yeah, our guy didn't have flippers.

669
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,364
( shouting )

670
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:21,666
( screams )

671
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:23,138
- Hey, take it easy!
Take it easy!

672
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:24,538
- I blow this bitch head off.
- Slow down!

673
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:28,546
- I said don't move.

674
00:40:33,052 --> 00:40:37,751
- I never knew you had the
brains for science, Slate.

675
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:39,552
( panting )

676
00:40:39,626 --> 00:40:40,855
- Where is my gold?

677
00:40:40,928 --> 00:40:42,190
( gasps )

678
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:43,821
- It's not what you think,
Tariq.

679
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:46,196
- What I think?

680
00:40:46,267 --> 00:40:49,328
What I think is you got greedy,
diveman.

681
00:40:49,404 --> 00:40:51,065
You saw that gold

682
00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:54,336
and you thought you could just
cut me out of this deal.

683
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:55,740
Again!

684
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,574
- It's not like that, okay?

685
00:40:57,647 --> 00:40:58,944
A lot of weird stuff's
been going on.

686
00:40:59,048 --> 00:41:00,538
A lot of people have
been dying lately.

687
00:41:00,616 --> 00:41:05,850
- You're right about that.

688
00:41:05,923 --> 00:41:07,515
Tell me where the gold is.

689
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:12,029
and I might let your woman
live for a while.

690
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:15,793
( shrieks )

691
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,359
- It's in the fridge.

692
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:22,407
- Check it!

693
00:41:26,946 --> 00:41:30,246
Careful. It might be a trick.

694
00:41:35,856 --> 00:41:36,788
( growls )

695
00:41:36,857 --> 00:41:38,620
( screams )

696
00:41:38,693 --> 00:41:40,092
( gunfire )

697
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:42,391
( shouting, growling )

698
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:45,456
- Kill it! Shoot it!

699
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:50,302
Kill it!

700
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:51,840
Damn you, Slate!

701
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:53,636
You'll never make it off
this island alive!

702
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,244
( growls )

703
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,477
( screams )

704
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,951
- Go, go.
- Go!

705
00:42:20,506 --> 00:42:23,032
- Do you see her?

706
00:42:23,143 --> 00:42:24,701
Do you see her?

707
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:34,818
Jane! Jane, Jane?

708
00:42:36,658 --> 00:42:38,353
Oh, my God!

709
00:42:40,763 --> 00:42:42,958
You'll be all right, Jane.
Jane?

710
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:07,153
Goddamn it!

711
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:15,992
- Sorry, man, she's gone.

712
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:19,039
She's gone.

713
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:29,016
- I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

714
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:31,246
We should be safe enough
here at the docks.

715
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,379
But we're dealing with something
pretty lethal out there.

716
00:43:33,456 --> 00:43:36,357
- I saw that thing's arms and
head sticking out of the water.

717
00:43:36,425 --> 00:43:41,022
It's a goddamned monster.

718
00:43:41,098 --> 00:43:42,793
So what do we do now?

719
00:43:42,899 --> 00:43:44,526
- I don't know.

720
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:45,932
Those little ones are like
gremlins from hell, though.

721
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:47,129
- And they won't stay
little for long.

722
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:48,967
You're right.

723
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:51,405
We should have destroyed those
eggs while we had the chance.

724
00:43:51,476 --> 00:43:52,966
- How many of those eggs
were down there?

725
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:55,638
- Two dozen.
- Oh, my God.

726
00:43:55,747 --> 00:43:57,476
If just one of those things can
do that to a sailboat,

727
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:59,210
can you imagine what two
dozen are gonna do?

728
00:43:59,284 --> 00:44:01,776
- Yeah, or how long before they
become 200 or 200,000?

729
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:05,256
- We gotta do something
right here right now.

730
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:07,725
Or else we're gonna be
dealing with--

731
00:44:07,794 --> 00:44:10,764
- A new apex predator, the top
of the food chain.

732
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:12,662
And the end of our time
as a species.

733
00:44:12,766 --> 00:44:17,431
- We gotta destroy those eggs.

734
00:44:17,506 --> 00:44:18,632
All right, guys. We're headed
back out to the hole.

735
00:44:18,707 --> 00:44:19,935
Let's go!

736
00:44:20,008 --> 00:44:21,635
- Hey, guys, get ready.
Let's go!

737
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:31,143
- So how come we never seen
this thing before?

738
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,984
- I think we have.

739
00:44:33,056 --> 00:44:35,581
Nautical tales of sea monsters
are as old as humanity itself.

740
00:44:35,659 --> 00:44:37,126
Who khows what's out there?

741
00:44:37,194 --> 00:44:39,754
I mean, for all we know, a
Poseidon Rex could have

742
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:40,991
been hibernating forthe
past 400 years

743
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:42,828
or even the last 400,000.

744
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:45,199
Maybe nobody ever saw
it and lived.

745
00:44:45,303 --> 00:44:46,964
Like the crew of the Cortez.

746
00:44:47,038 --> 00:44:48,267
- Wait. What did you call it?

747
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,968
- Poseidon Rex,
the 'King of the Ocean'.

748
00:44:51,043 --> 00:44:52,635
Just like the T-Rex was
king of the land.

749
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:55,977
P-Rex ruled the sea, only
bigger and stronger.

750
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:58,643
- So you get to name it?
- Perk of the job.

751
00:44:58,718 --> 00:45:02,984
- King of the sea, huh?
We'll see about that.

752
00:45:03,056 --> 00:45:04,718
- Make no mistake.

753
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:06,383
P-Rex may have been one of the
most fearsome creatures

754
00:45:06,494 --> 00:45:07,984
to ever walk the earth.

755
00:45:08,062 --> 00:45:10,121
Or swim the earth anyway.

756
00:45:10,198 --> 00:45:12,565
- Okay. So how do we
kill this thing?

757
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,693
- Well, even P-Rex is
just an animal.

758
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,863
It bleeds like anything else.

759
00:45:16,939 --> 00:45:19,170
- So we get guns, right?

760
00:45:47,406 --> 00:45:49,101
- Uh, I'm picking up something.

761
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:54,044
Jacks.

762
00:45:54,114 --> 00:45:58,074
- It's probably just the reef.
It means we're getting close.

763
00:46:00,288 --> 00:46:01,846
- There's something coming up
beneath us!

764
00:46:01,923 --> 00:46:03,288
Something really, really big!

765
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:07,726
- Look alive on those guns!

766
00:46:07,796 --> 00:46:11,926
- It's coming in fast!
It's almost here.

767
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:14,061
- Where is it now?

768
00:46:14,137 --> 00:46:16,230
- It's underneath us!

769
00:46:18,608 --> 00:46:20,132
- Full reverse!

770
00:46:20,243 --> 00:46:23,577
- Hold on!

771
00:46:23,648 --> 00:46:24,979
( growls )

772
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,709
- Open fire!

773
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,549
- ( gunfire )
- My God.

774
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:31,612
- Fire at its head!

775
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,624
( gunfire )

776
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:39,265
- Amazing.

777
00:46:44,538 --> 00:46:46,301
- I'm out!

778
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:49,638
- Reload!

779
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,177
- I'm not seeing anything.

780
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:52,439
- Well, I think we got him.

781
00:46:52,514 --> 00:46:54,243
- I think we just pissed it off.

782
00:46:54,316 --> 00:46:58,150
- There's no way it survived
all that.

783
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:01,951
- I've got something. I think
it's back!

784
00:47:02,024 --> 00:47:05,425
Oh, my God, Henry!

785
00:47:05,494 --> 00:47:06,518
Henry!

786
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:09,596
Henry!

787
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:11,099
- Spare me!

788
00:47:11,168 --> 00:47:12,658
No!

789
00:47:12,736 --> 00:47:15,706
- No!

790
00:47:20,645 --> 00:47:21,703
( growls )

791
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:25,181
- Jesus.

792
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,309
- Take us over there!

793
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:43,560
( roars )

794
00:47:43,671 --> 00:47:45,536
- Guys, that's not
gonna kill it!

795
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:53,540
- Yeah!

796
00:47:53,615 --> 00:47:54,844
- Yeah! I hit it!

797
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:55,884
- Great job, Jacks!

798
00:47:55,952 --> 00:47:57,852
- Well done! Good job!

799
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,547
- Yeah, man!

800
00:47:59,622 --> 00:48:03,354
- Whoa!

801
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:10,261
- Jacks, we're being dragged!

802
00:48:10,368 --> 00:48:11,892
Pull the lever!

803
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,335
- Jacks, get on it!

804
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:15,373
- It's gonna pull us under!

805
00:48:21,113 --> 00:48:22,774
Pull the lever!

806
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,846
Hold on!

807
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,188
( shrieks )

808
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:47,274
Oh, God! Oh!

809
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:49,208
- Let's get back to the dock!

810
00:48:49,279 --> 00:48:52,077
- Oh, that was close.
- Let's get off the water, huh?

811
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:10,467
- This place looks like
a ghost town.

812
00:49:10,535 --> 00:49:12,970
- Yeah. That tends to
happen when people

813
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:15,667
see a prehistoric monster come
out of the water.

814
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,265
- They got to get the hell
off the island.

815
00:49:17,343 --> 00:49:19,107
- So you're gonna call in
the cavalry, right?

816
00:49:19,179 --> 00:49:21,977
- We'll bring enough fire power to
send it back to the ice age.

817
00:49:22,049 --> 00:49:24,244
- Cretaceous period, actually.

818
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:27,254
It, uh--
( sighs )

819
00:49:27,322 --> 00:49:28,949
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

820
00:49:29,023 --> 00:49:30,957
Just don't forget those eggs
are still out there.

821
00:49:31,025 --> 00:49:32,856
- We'll nuke the goddamn
hole if we have to.

822
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:34,930
- What about us?

823
00:49:34,997 --> 00:49:38,091
- I suggest you people hide.

824
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:39,794
- Just be careful.

825
00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:42,600
- I think he knows better than
to come after us again.

826
00:49:42,672 --> 00:49:44,333
Okay, guys, let's go.

827
00:49:55,853 --> 00:49:57,845
( roars, screaming )

828
00:49:59,758 --> 00:50:01,157
( shouts )

829
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:05,861
- Guys, let's get the
hell outta here.

830
00:50:05,932 --> 00:50:07,229
- Don't worry, guys.

831
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:08,732
This is the one place
we're safe.

832
00:50:08,835 --> 00:50:09,961
I mean, P-rex rules the water,
not the land.

833
00:50:10,036 --> 00:50:13,130
- You sure about that?

834
00:50:13,206 --> 00:50:14,868
- On second thought, maybe
we'd better run.

835
00:50:14,942 --> 00:50:15,909
Definitely run.

836
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,307
- Run! Come on, let's go!

837
00:50:17,378 --> 00:50:19,676
Move, move, move!
Everybody run!

838
00:50:19,747 --> 00:50:22,376
Get out!

839
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:28,857
- Hey, here!
- Come on, go, go, go.

840
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:32,693
( roars )

841
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,535
- This is unbelievable.

842
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:42,595
- Oh, my God!

843
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,196
Upload the footage.

844
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:45,537
People need to know what's
happening here.

845
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,542
Someone must have signaled
for help.

846
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:47,543
It should be coming, right?

847
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:48,874
- I don't know.

848
00:50:48,947 --> 00:50:50,608
I kinda think we're on our own.

849
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,775
We need to get outta here
before that thing comes back.

850
00:50:52,885 --> 00:50:54,443
- And go where?

851
00:50:54,553 --> 00:50:56,350
- At Henry's boat. It's
just on the dock.

852
00:50:56,422 --> 00:50:58,049
- It's 40 miles to the mainland.
You wanna take that chance?

853
00:50:58,123 --> 00:50:59,716
- Guys, there's an old
military base

854
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:00,885
on the other side of the
island past the town.

855
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:04,556
We could hide there.

856
00:51:04,631 --> 00:51:06,895
- All right. I'll try
and distract it.

857
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:09,198
You guys make your way to
the car, okay?

858
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,862
- Good luck.

859
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:16,209
- Hey!

860
00:51:16,278 --> 00:51:17,802
Hey, over here!

861
00:51:17,913 --> 00:51:21,974
Hey, ugly! Come and get me!

862
00:51:22,084 --> 00:51:25,577
Come on, you old reptile!

863
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:28,055
( roars )

864
00:51:28,124 --> 00:51:29,250
Go! Go, go, go!

865
00:51:29,325 --> 00:51:31,089
- Okay, come on, come on!

866
00:51:48,147 --> 00:51:49,307
- No keys!

867
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:52,408
- What?
- Look for keys.

868
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:55,182
- Check the body!

869
00:51:55,288 --> 00:51:57,153
- Keys, keys.

870
00:51:57,224 --> 00:51:59,590
Got 'em, got 'em!

871
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,095
- Got 'em? Let's go, let's go!

872
00:52:02,163 --> 00:52:04,188
- No. We're not leaving
without Jacks!

873
00:52:04,298 --> 00:52:06,357
No. He'll be back any minute!

874
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:08,332
Jacks? Jacks?

875
00:52:08,403 --> 00:52:12,932
Jacks, let's go!

876
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,168
- Slate!

877
00:52:14,243 --> 00:52:17,475
- Tariq? You're, uh...

878
00:52:17,547 --> 00:52:20,983
- Alive?

879
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,349
No thanks to you, Slate.

880
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,717
Where is my gold?

881
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:27,222
- We're goin' to get
it right now.

882
00:52:27,324 --> 00:52:28,723
- Yeah?

883
00:52:28,826 --> 00:52:32,661
Now I get my gold and my revenge.

884
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:36,895
But before I do,

885
00:52:37,002 --> 00:52:39,402
I want to kill you!

886
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:44,633
( crunching )

887
00:52:44,711 --> 00:52:47,373
- Get in, let's go, let's go!
Come on, drive!

888
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:52,845
That was close.

889
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,013
Nice driving for a
marine biologist.

890
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,558
- We just follow this road for
a couple more miles.

891
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:58,922
- Yeah. I just wanna make
one more stop.

892
00:52:59,027 --> 00:53:01,928
- Where?
- Guess we'll find out.

893
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:25,278
- What is this place?
- Compound of Tariq's.

894
00:53:25,389 --> 00:53:27,085
- You mean the guy that just
tried to kill us?

895
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:28,183
- Yep.

896
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,421
- So why would you
take us here?

897
00:53:50,952 --> 00:53:54,285
- Oh, shit.
- That's why.

898
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:58,157
- Man, now that's more like it.

899
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:00,491
- I don't think we've seen the
last of that thing.

900
00:54:00,596 --> 00:54:05,591
I don't know about you, but I'm
not much for hiding.

901
00:54:05,669 --> 00:54:09,628
I say we ought to kill that
thing or die trying.

902
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:11,606
- Oh, we're gonna kill it.

903
00:54:42,877 --> 00:54:45,278
( roars )

904
00:54:45,347 --> 00:54:47,144
- We got company!

905
00:54:47,216 --> 00:54:50,344
- Shoot it!
- Oh, my God, get it!

906
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:52,217
( gunfire )

907
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:08,637
( screams )

908
00:55:08,707 --> 00:55:10,538
( tires squeal )

909
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,707
- Everybody out! Let's go!

910
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:15,974
- Run! We can lose him
in the woods!

911
00:55:16,048 --> 00:55:17,675
( gunfire )

912
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:32,199
( growling )

913
00:55:32,267 --> 00:55:33,199
- Go, go, go, go!

914
00:55:33,268 --> 00:55:34,428
Go, go!

915
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:36,696
- Jacks! What the hell
are you doing?

916
00:55:36,771 --> 00:55:38,569
- Do what I ask and go!

917
00:55:38,641 --> 00:55:40,939
- Let's go! We gotta move!

918
00:55:54,058 --> 00:55:59,018
- Careful !

919
00:55:59,096 --> 00:56:01,291
- We're not gonna outrun it!

920
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,801
It's too fast, too big!
Just keep going!

921
00:56:10,109 --> 00:56:11,974
In here! In here! Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

922
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:14,706
- Come on!

923
00:56:14,781 --> 00:56:16,078
- It's coming.

924
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,787
- Quiet.

925
00:56:20,854 --> 00:56:23,254
- Don't move a muscle.

926
00:56:23,324 --> 00:56:24,883
( growling )

927
00:56:42,145 --> 00:56:44,773
- It's gone.

928
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:49,116
- How much farther do you
think that base is?

929
00:56:49,187 --> 00:56:53,453
- Not more than a mile or so.

930
00:56:53,524 --> 00:56:55,014
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

931
00:56:55,126 --> 00:56:56,287
Let's go.

932
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:19,810
( growls )

933
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:24,825
- How old is this place?

934
00:57:24,893 --> 00:57:26,360
- I don't know. It doesn't matter.

935
00:57:26,428 --> 00:57:27,726
Hopefully, we can get a
signal out from inside

936
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:28,990
and call for help.

937
00:57:29,065 --> 00:57:30,896
- At the very least, a
place to hide.

938
00:57:54,293 --> 00:57:57,023
- This place should be running
on its own grid.

939
00:57:57,096 --> 00:57:58,724
- Oh, this place gives
me the creeps.

940
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,666
- Well, safer in here than
out there, right?

941
00:58:01,735 --> 00:58:04,203
- I guess.
- So what are we looking for?

942
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:05,864
- Power.

943
00:58:14,049 --> 00:58:15,448
Jackpot.

944
00:58:15,551 --> 00:58:16,848
- You think you'll get it
up and running?

945
00:58:16,919 --> 00:58:19,410
- We'll see.

946
00:58:25,295 --> 00:58:28,264
- I'll be back. I'm gonna go
check things out.

947
00:58:40,078 --> 00:58:42,546
- Where'd you run off to?
- Found the armory.

948
00:58:42,614 --> 00:58:44,947
- Did you find anything?
- Oh, yeah.

949
00:58:45,017 --> 00:58:48,976
Grenades, rocket launchers,
you name it.

950
00:58:53,427 --> 00:58:54,325
( gasps )

951
00:58:54,428 --> 00:58:55,918
- You did it!

952
00:58:55,996 --> 00:58:57,395
- I'm not sure how
long it'll last.

953
00:58:57,464 --> 00:58:58,556
Let's see if we can
find a radio.

954
00:58:58,632 --> 00:59:01,500
- Great.
- Okay.

955
00:59:01,603 --> 00:59:05,835
- This thing looks ancient.
- It is.

956
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,774
This is Jackson Slate on
the Ambergris Key.

957
00:59:08,844 --> 00:59:11,813
We are alone and we're
in trouble.

958
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:16,342
Anyone out there, please
respond. Over.

959
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,944
Anyone out there read me? Over.

960
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:28,764
Anyone out there? Over.

961
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,425
This is Jacks Slate of
Ambergris Key.

962
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:32,436
We are alone and in trouble.

963
00:59:32,504 --> 00:59:35,598
Anyone out there copy this,
get back. Over.

964
00:59:44,217 --> 00:59:46,686
I gotta assume we're still alone.

965
00:59:46,754 --> 00:59:49,552
Found a two-seater airplane in
the hangar next door.

966
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:53,024
If no help comes in the morning,
I'll fly that thing outta here.

967
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:55,392
- What if it comes back before then?

968
00:59:55,497 --> 01:00:01,197
- Well, then we'll give it hell.

969
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:05,366
Get some rest. I'll keep watch.

970
01:00:26,432 --> 01:00:29,868
- Sure you wanna stay out
here all by yourself?

971
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:57,088
( chuckles )

972
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:12,279
( giggles )

973
01:01:50,327 --> 01:01:52,022
- Let me know as soon--

974
01:01:52,128 --> 01:01:53,857
Got it? I don't care
what it takes.

975
01:01:53,963 --> 01:01:55,362
What's goin' on, Private?

976
01:01:55,465 --> 01:01:57,262
- Sir, something's strange.

977
01:01:57,334 --> 01:01:59,929
I received a transmission on an
old military band,

978
01:02:00,004 --> 01:02:01,972
one that hasn't been used
in over 30 years.

979
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:03,939
- That is strange.

980
01:02:04,008 --> 01:02:06,443
- Actually, that's not even
the strange part.

981
01:02:06,511 --> 01:02:09,105
- Where did it originate from?

982
01:02:09,181 --> 01:02:12,116
- Ambergris Key, the old
military base over there.

983
01:02:12,184 --> 01:02:14,380
- That outpost has been abandoned
for decades.

984
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:15,715
What did it say?

985
01:02:15,822 --> 01:02:19,849
- Actually, sir, you
won't believe this.

986
01:02:25,733 --> 01:02:28,532
- What the--?

987
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,511
- So how does one get
in the business

988
01:02:36,579 --> 01:02:38,740
of treasure hunting?

989
01:02:38,848 --> 01:02:42,477
- I think getting in is easy.

990
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:44,747
It's the getting out part
that's hard.

991
01:02:44,855 --> 01:02:46,516
- Oh, I've noticed.

992
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:48,023
( chuckles )

993
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:49,058
- And how did you end up
mixed up with a guy

994
01:02:49,126 --> 01:02:50,491
like Tariq anyway?

995
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:55,089
- Tariq?

996
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:58,327
I don't think you can say what
I do is exactly legal.

997
01:02:58,403 --> 01:03:00,895
So sometimes you need somebody
that knows

998
01:03:00,973 --> 01:03:04,409
the ins and outs of a country, right?

999
01:03:04,476 --> 01:03:07,503
- And I take it you probably
won't be turning

1000
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:10,947
any of that gold into the local
government or museum?

1001
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:13,518
- Would you?

1002
01:03:13,586 --> 01:03:15,452
- Hmm.

1003
01:03:15,556 --> 01:03:16,955
- So what about you?

1004
01:03:17,057 --> 01:03:18,456
If you're not motivated
by money,

1005
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,857
I mean, you're obviously not
motivated by danger.

1006
01:03:20,928 --> 01:03:24,888
- Hey, there's plenty of
danger in what I do.

1007
01:03:24,966 --> 01:03:25,898
( chuckles )

1008
01:03:25,967 --> 01:03:27,093
Jellyfish sting, you know.

1009
01:03:27,169 --> 01:03:28,796
- A jellyfish, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1010
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:30,634
Well, the Immortal Jellyfish,
to be exact.

1011
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,367
They live in the Blue Hole.

1012
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:35,377
I've been studying them for
the past three years.

1013
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:39,109
Do you have any idea
what you've done, by the way?

1014
01:03:39,183 --> 01:03:41,378
By setting off those explosives,

1015
01:03:41,452 --> 01:03:43,283
you've done irreparable damage
to their habitat.

1016
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:44,820
- Hey, slow down, okay?

1017
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:46,288
I think finding a ship
that's been missing

1018
01:03:46,357 --> 01:03:48,416
for over 400 years is a
little more important

1019
01:03:48,493 --> 01:03:49,755
than some jellyfish.

1020
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:52,422
- Oh, these jellyfish
live forever.

1021
01:03:52,497 --> 01:03:55,160
- Forever?
- As in immortal.

1022
01:03:55,267 --> 01:03:56,461
They never die.

1023
01:03:56,535 --> 01:03:57,729
They may hold the key
to unlocking

1024
01:03:57,803 --> 01:03:59,293
the secret of human immortality.

1025
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:01,840
Oh, I was just scratching
the surface of

1026
01:04:01,942 --> 01:04:03,739
all the secrets the Blue Hole
may have been hiding.

1027
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:06,335
- So you don't think that thing,

1028
01:04:06,446 --> 01:04:12,010
that Poseidon Rex, is
immortal as well, do you?

1029
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:16,249
- I don't really know
at this point.

1030
01:04:16,324 --> 01:04:18,122
( radio static )

1031
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:26,029
- What are you doing?
- This place is so old.

1032
01:04:26,135 --> 01:04:27,796
I figured they'd have this
stuff laying around.

1033
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:30,169
And I was right.
- What is it?

1034
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,937
- A telegraph.

1035
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:36,776
- Morse Code? Who you
trying to reach?

1036
01:04:36,847 --> 01:04:40,477
- There.
- The jungle?

1037
01:04:40,552 --> 01:04:43,487
- No. It's a U.S. Army base.

1038
01:04:43,555 --> 01:04:48,220
- How do you know it's there? -
Trust me. It's there.

1039
01:04:48,327 --> 01:04:49,885
- So now what?

1040
01:04:49,996 --> 01:04:53,523
- Now we wait.

1041
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,123
- Okay. Well, what'd
you tell 'em?

1042
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:56,635
- I told them that a 50-foot
sea monster

1043
01:04:56,703 --> 01:04:58,295
was attacking the island,
killing everybody

1044
01:04:58,372 --> 01:05:00,499
and that they needed to do
something about it.

1045
01:05:00,574 --> 01:05:02,235
- Yeah, I'm sure they're gonna
take that seriously, huh?

1046
01:05:02,342 --> 01:05:03,310
- Well, it was worth a shot.

1047
01:05:03,378 --> 01:05:05,039
( static )

1048
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:06,045
- Wait a minute.
What's that sound?

1049
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:09,015
- ( beeping ) - Shh!

1050
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,388
You're not gonna like it.

1051
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,225
They got your message last night.

1052
01:05:21,298 --> 01:05:23,391
They have satellite imaging
of the creature

1053
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:25,696
and are tracking it now.

1054
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:27,397
We have to be off the island
in 20 minutes.

1055
01:05:27,471 --> 01:05:29,564
- Why? What happens in 20 minutes?

1056
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:33,201
- It's gonna be an all-out
aerial assault.

1057
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:35,041
They're gonna level
the whole thing.

1058
01:05:35,113 --> 01:05:36,080
- What are you talking about?

1059
01:05:36,148 --> 01:05:37,410
There's still people here!

1060
01:05:37,482 --> 01:05:39,177
- What are we gonna do?

1061
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:42,085
- The airplane.

1062
01:05:42,155 --> 01:05:44,214
- But it only fits two people.

1063
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:47,885
- Yeah, well, only one of
us is going up.

1064
01:05:47,961 --> 01:05:49,053
You guys get down to the pier.

1065
01:05:49,128 --> 01:05:50,892
I'll try and distract it.

1066
01:05:53,567 --> 01:05:57,264
- One, two, three, four.

1067
01:05:57,338 --> 01:05:58,567
- You still have eyes
on the creature?

1068
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,073
- Yes, sir.

1069
01:06:00,141 --> 01:06:01,540
It's still rampaging the
entire island.

1070
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:03,908
- Bring it up on the monitors, please.

1071
01:06:03,979 --> 01:06:07,143
Zoom. Closer.

1072
01:06:07,249 --> 01:06:10,377
My God!

1073
01:06:13,657 --> 01:06:16,387
- Sir, you won't believe this.

1074
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:18,553
I just received a message from
the civilians at the base.

1075
01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:21,064
The ones from last night.
Morse Code.

1076
01:06:21,132 --> 01:06:22,724
They're still alive.

1077
01:06:22,834 --> 01:06:25,803
- I hope you told them they got
less than 20 minutes

1078
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:29,136
to get out of that area before
I glass the whole damn thing.

1079
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:31,073
- Sir, we have to give them
time to escape.

1080
01:06:31,143 --> 01:06:34,977
- I can't let that thing
get off the island.

1081
01:06:35,047 --> 01:06:39,508
Let's hope your friends can.

1082
01:06:39,619 --> 01:06:41,348
Proceed.

1083
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,777
- Come on, give me a hand!

1084
01:07:02,845 --> 01:07:06,872
Slide it open.

1085
01:07:06,983 --> 01:07:08,281
That's it.

1086
01:07:15,894 --> 01:07:17,191
( panting )

1087
01:07:18,897 --> 01:07:21,058
- Come on, come on, come on.

1088
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,794
- It needs fuel!

1089
01:07:22,868 --> 01:07:27,328
Grab the stepladder over there!

1090
01:07:27,406 --> 01:07:29,306
Try on top.

1091
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:30,843
Right on top, right up here,
right up here!

1092
01:07:30,911 --> 01:07:32,037
Okay!

1093
01:07:32,112 --> 01:07:33,511
All right, give me some slack!

1094
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,913
All right. Once he gets it in,
just pump, okay?

1095
01:07:37,017 --> 01:07:39,987
- Okay, ready? Ready?

1096
01:07:40,054 --> 01:07:43,421
- Go, go.

1097
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:49,520
Come on!

1098
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:51,031
Come on! We need more!

1099
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,032
- I'm pumping as hard and
fast as I can!

1100
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:53,568
( growls )

1101
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:58,039
- Guys? Guys? It's back!
That's it!

1102
01:07:58,108 --> 01:08:01,077
- All right, get out of here!
Get out of here!

1103
01:08:01,144 --> 01:08:03,045
- Be careful, Jacks.

1104
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:07,608
- Get off this island!

1105
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,932
( growls )

1106
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:33,709
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Let's go!

1107
01:08:47,831 --> 01:08:49,765
Let's go, let's go, get
the bow line!

1108
01:09:14,627 --> 01:09:16,117
( roars )

1109
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:25,366
- Come on, you bastard,
follow me.

1110
01:09:29,644 --> 01:09:31,703
- Come on, come on, come on!

1111
01:09:31,813 --> 01:09:33,542
( growls )

1112
01:09:39,488 --> 01:09:43,858
- T minus five minutes
to destination.

1113
01:09:43,927 --> 01:09:45,053
- Copy that, Gold Leader.

1114
01:09:45,162 --> 01:09:46,390
You are weapons free if you can

1115
01:09:46,496 --> 01:09:48,828
make visual contact with the target.

1116
01:09:58,010 --> 01:10:00,342
- Go! Light it up, light it up!

1117
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,213
( gunfire )

1118
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:08,987
- Keep shooting! Keep shooting!

1119
01:10:09,055 --> 01:10:10,579
- The son of a bitch won't die!

1120
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:12,157
- Pilot, please identify yourself.

1121
01:10:12,225 --> 01:10:14,751
- Hey, it's Jackson Slate.
Who's this?

1122
01:10:14,862 --> 01:10:16,853
- You are ordered to leave
this airspace at once.

1123
01:10:16,931 --> 01:10:18,159
- Now listen here!

1124
01:10:18,232 --> 01:10:19,756
I'm the one that called the S.O.S.

1125
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:22,029
The goddamned monster's been
attacking the island!

1126
01:10:22,104 --> 01:10:23,935
- Come here! Take the wheel !

1127
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:29,942
- Get it, Rod! Get it!

1128
01:10:30,046 --> 01:10:31,946
Be careful, Rod!

1129
01:10:32,048 --> 01:10:33,379
( roars )

1130
01:10:38,989 --> 01:10:40,513
- Whoa!

1131
01:10:40,591 --> 01:10:42,388
- You are ordered to
immediately leave the area

1132
01:10:42,459 --> 01:10:44,519
before aerial
bombardment commences.

1133
01:10:44,596 --> 01:10:46,962
- There's still people
on the island!

1134
01:10:54,006 --> 01:10:55,371
The creature's not on
land anymore.

1135
01:10:55,441 --> 01:10:56,874
It's in the water.

1136
01:10:56,943 --> 01:10:59,811
- Lieutenant, have 'em
paint the target.

1137
01:10:59,913 --> 01:11:01,813
- We're tracking your position.

1138
01:11:01,915 --> 01:11:05,544
If you continue to paint the
target, we can get a lock.

1139
01:11:05,619 --> 01:11:08,953
Do you understand, Mr. Slate?

1140
01:11:09,023 --> 01:11:11,617
- I do.

1141
01:11:15,597 --> 01:11:17,428
- Gold Leader, the Cessna 22
will paint the target.

1142
01:11:17,499 --> 01:11:20,059
Lock onto his transponder signal.

1143
01:11:20,135 --> 01:11:21,261
- Affirmative.

1144
01:11:21,337 --> 01:11:22,828
( roars )

1145
01:11:34,352 --> 01:11:35,683
- Oh!

1146
01:11:35,786 --> 01:11:36,912
( screams )

1147
01:11:36,988 --> 01:11:38,479
- No!

1148
01:11:38,557 --> 01:11:40,149
( screams )

1149
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,026
- Raptor's are nearly in
visual range, sir.

1150
01:11:53,172 --> 01:11:56,199
T minus 30 seconds.

1151
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:18,898
( growls )

1152
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:26,643
- Direct hit!
The creature is down!

1153
01:12:26,711 --> 01:12:28,235
- Yes!

1154
01:12:28,346 --> 01:12:30,337
- I repeat, the creature is down.

1155
01:12:30,415 --> 01:12:31,746
- I want a cleanup team in
there immediately.

1156
01:12:31,849 --> 01:12:33,715
Good job, good job.

1157
01:12:33,786 --> 01:12:35,686
- What about Slate?

1158
01:12:42,929 --> 01:12:44,260
( growls )

1159
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:45,661
- Sir, it's back!

1160
01:12:45,732 --> 01:12:48,258
- No! No, it's impossible!

1161
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:49,734
- Look!

1162
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:12,385
- Yeah.

1163
01:13:12,463 --> 01:13:14,090
( screams )

1164
01:13:21,139 --> 01:13:22,766
- Woo!

1165
01:13:22,841 --> 01:13:27,802
- Yes! Yes!

1166
01:13:27,913 --> 01:13:30,814
( pants )

1167
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:58,977
- Hey, there.

1168
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:03,984
- You're alive.

1169
01:14:04,053 --> 01:14:05,851
Jacks.

1170
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:11,786
- How would you like a vacation?

1171
01:14:11,862 --> 01:14:13,330
- How about a different island?

1172
01:14:13,398 --> 01:14:17,664
- Sounds good to me.

1173
01:14:17,736 --> 01:14:19,431
- Aren't we forgetting something?

1174
01:14:19,504 --> 01:14:20,802
- The gold?

1175
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:24,809
- No. I mean the eggs.

1176
01:14:44,733 --> 01:14:48,829
( rustling )

1177
01:14:48,904 --> 01:14:50,735
( growls )
