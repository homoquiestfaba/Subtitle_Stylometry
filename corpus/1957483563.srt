00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,708
- [Vince] Yeah?

27
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,083
- Vince, hey,
you're never gonna--

28
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,416
- [Vince] You know what time
it is? Dude, it's like--

29
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,083
- I know, I know it's late.

30
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,041
How fast can you get here?

00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,000

[knocking at door]

33
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,333
- You interrupted a
perfectly good card game.

34
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,541
- Come on man, this is big.

35
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,958
- Are you wearing pink too?
- It's orange.

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,166
- All right, all right, show me.

37
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,000
So?

38
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,375
- I did it.

39
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,208
- Did what?

40
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,416
It?

41
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,125
Scott, you're not supposed
to run anything without me,

42
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:52,916
that's our rule.

43
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,333
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

44
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,791
Listen, I pushed the magnetic
fields past 11 Teslas,

45
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,708
and stabilized the
proton trajectory.

46
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,958
I was able to beat

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the 13 teraelectronvolt
record exponentially.

48
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:03,125
- Hello?

49
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,708
Two people present
for all experiments.

50
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,458
Blow up the world is an actual
theoretical possibility.

51
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,958
We don't know if this thing
is an unwieldy microwave

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,541
or a black hole
planet destroyer.

53
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,333
Two people.

54
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:14,250
- Actually, we know now.

55
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,000
Look.
Look for yourself.

56
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,541
I've used four
sensors to measure

57
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,750
gravity and atmospheric pressure

58
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,208
at four points in the room.

59
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,958
Look at those spikes, Vince.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,541
It's four and a half seconds.

61
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:28,166
- Is this real?

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,083
Scott, is this really real?

63
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,041
- It's really real.

64
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,291
- Really real?

65
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,875
Like, you're not messing
with me at all in this?

66
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:35,708
- We did it.

67
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,666
Okay.

68
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:41,125
- You're sure you're
not messing with me?

69
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,208
- We did it.

70
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,666
- Let's power this bad
boy up, I wanna see it.

71
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,833
- That's the problem, that was
the four and a half seconds.

72
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,625
- Not enough power.

73
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:55,000
- It created a tear, but
it was too much heat.

74
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,958
The power we had stored
wasn't enough to keep it open

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,958
and stable, much less
investigate it safely.

76
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:03,125
- Four and a half seconds.

77
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:05,250
We gotta find a
sustainable power source

78
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,000
that can keep this
thing open longer.

79
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,291
- Did you use my coordinates?

80
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,125
- 4.994.
- And a whole bunch of zeroes?

81
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,833
- And a whole bunch of zeroes.

82
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,208
- What did you see?

83
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,125
- [Scott] This room.

84
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:18,958
Different.

85
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,500
- What if we find dinosaurs?

86
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,333
Scott, everyone's
gonna want one.

87
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,416
No more trash cans.

88
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,458
You have one of these
in your kitchen,

89
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,458
you just throw your
garbage through.

90
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,458
- Probably just stretched
every law of physics

91
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,000
beyond its known limitation,

92
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,041
and your first thoughts are
dinosaurs and waste management?

93
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,541
- Just admit that
you're curious too.

94
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,375
Dinosaurs!

95
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,208
- When do we tell
Cicero Market Tech?

96
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,541
They have deep pockets,

97
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,333
and a hunger for
this sort of thing.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,916
They can fund us.

99
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,041
I'm thinking money Scott.

100
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:52,125
No.

101
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,666
We can't, not yet.

102
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,541
We need to show we can open
this thing and keep it stable.

103
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,958
We need to get a blue core
battery from them first.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,375
[tense music]

105
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,958
You want to steal a top secret

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,333
cryonic battery from Cicero?

107
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,083
From our place of employment?

108
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,500
The very batteries we
are using on a project

109
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,708
that we are actually
being paid to work on?

110
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,166
Nevermind if they even notice,

111
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,500
it's only like 12 batteries
exist in the entire world.

112
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,250
- Yes.

113
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,083
[Vincent groans]

114
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,666
Cryonic batteries
are designed to power

115
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,750
an entire cryogenic
pod bay for a century.

116
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,625
- Yeah, and keeping people
frozen for a long time

117
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,541
is a far cry from
smashing God particles

118
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,041
to create doorways
to other dimensions!

119
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,083
- Which we just
said, by the way.

120
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,250
- This is so cool.

121
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:33,166
- We can't go any
further without them.

122
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,291
- [Vince] Okay.

123
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,208
I might have an idea.

124
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,958
I think Lennon may have
already lifted one.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,291
- Lennon?

126
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,083
Why?

127
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,708
- Who knows why.

128
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,375
But he may have sort of
bragged about having one once.

129
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,708
- He's been weird lately.

130
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,125
- Yeah, no kidding.

131
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,750
But if he has one.

132
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,125
- It's not stealing if
it's already stolen.

133
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,958
- Hi there, friends, and
welcome to The Daily Do.

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,333
Thank you for spending
just four minutes

135
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,666
of your day with me and
hopefully I can help

136
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,291
make your lives a little easier.

137
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,041
On today's episode,
I'm gonna show you

138
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,041
a few tricks on how to
remove ants from your home

139
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,708
without any poisons or sprays.

140
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,333
This is particularly beneficial.

141
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,125
Hi.

142
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,166
[laughing]

143
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,791
- Did I just mess up your video?

144
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:32,083
- Yeah, it's okay.

145
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,333
You running late?

146
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,916
- Yeah, I'm about to be.

147
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,208
- How late were you and
Vince up last night?

148
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,041
- Well.

149
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,041
I think we did it.

150
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,041
- Can you show me?

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,125
- Tonight.

152
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,041
After work, maybe, I
need one more thing.

153
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,083
Love you.

154
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,541
- [Margail] Love you.

155
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,125
- Cicero Market Technologies

156
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,000
is not only the
best in the world,

157
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:58,083
We're the only ones breaking
these scientific barriers.

158
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,125
Our reputation always makes sure

159
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,000
that we come to market first.

160
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,625
So please, give me a time-frame

161
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,000
and make it aggressive.

162
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,458
- The problem is time.

163
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,583
Until we can successfully
put somebody under ice

164
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,833
for longer than 96 days,
we'll never truly know

165
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,083
what damage the
cryo process causes.

166
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,125
- Dr. Normus.

167
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:27,541
We hired you to
create a long-term

168
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,750
storage environment
for our clients.

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,416
If you had done your job
correctly from the beginning,

170
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,333
there wouldn't be
any safety concerns.

171
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,875
- We're still
trying to find a way

172
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,125
to safely take measurements
from the inside, so that.

173
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,625
- What about the trials?

174
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,083
- Sir, results are
within parameters.

175
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:54,166
But again, nothing's made it
past the 96-day threshold yet.

176
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,791
- Tell me why.

177
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,000
- Because after 96 days,

178
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,791
they can't remember
their own names.

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,333
- The preservation
units themselves

180
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,125
are being damaged
by the process.

181
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:06,666
We need more time.

182
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:09,666
- When?

183
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,583
- Two years.

184
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,208
- Dr. Lennon, do you agree?

185
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,000
- Shit!

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So close.

187
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,000
What was your
question, Miss Fanning?

188
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,875
- Do you agree with
Scott's estimation

189
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,750
of this taking one to two years
before we can go to market?

190
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,250
- Scott's right.

191
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,958
We can spend a year figuring out

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,041
the measuring logarithms,
but the hardware as it is now

193
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,583
can't survive the freeze.

194
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,041
We already know that.

195
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,666
Priority one may be to
keep the client stable,

196
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:50,375
but that won't matter if we
can't monitor from the inside.

197
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,125
- Do you need
additional resources?

198
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,458
- One of those really
expensive espresso machines

199
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,416
in the lounge
would be fantastic.

200
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,708
- Are we disrupting
your day, Dr. Lennon,

201
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,541
because I fail to
find the humor here.

202
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,083
- I'm making a point.

203
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,000
Throwing more money
at this won't cause

204
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,833
the necessary technological
changes to just appear.

205
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,208
The time it takes is
the time it takes.

206
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,541
And you don't pay me to rush.

207
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,041
- I'm beginning to question
why we pay you at all.

208
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,708
- Because I'm Bob Lennon.

209
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,458
And the only effectual
cryotician in the world

210
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,083
who speaks English.

211
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,083
If you want to go
public now, fine.

212
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,500
But tell NASA and your
billionaire clients

213
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,500
that you can put
someone in cryo-stasis,

214
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,250
but after three months they
may, I don't know, die.

215
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,625
- Put that on a brochure.

216
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,666
- Fine.

217
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,875
You have one year.

218
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,875
But I'm growing very impatient.

219
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,125
Dr. Lennon.

220
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,416
I'm really beginning to question

221
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,333
the importance of
your role here.

222
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,083
- The other divisions
are years behind us.

223
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,958
I'm your golden goose.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,583
Cicero will be first.

225
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:13,833
- You have no idea how
easily you can be replaced.

226
00:12:16,041 --> 00:12:17,458
- All right, listen.

227
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,916
You guys are all brilliant.

228
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,125
Give us results.

229
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:25,333
Thank you, Dr. Lennon.

230
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,791
- [Lennon] My pleasure.

231
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,333
- Gentlemen.

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Is there anything
you'd like to add?

233
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,041
- No, sir.

234
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,291
- What's Project Milestone?

235
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,666
- Where'd you hear this name?

236
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,250
- Overheard someone.

237
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,000
- There are no other projects
that require your attention

238
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,000
except the one
you're currently on.

239
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,750
Thank you, gentlemen.

240
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,958
- You know they need
to steal from us.

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,083
- Of course I know that.

242
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,083
But it has to be this way.

243
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,083
And it has to be them.

244
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:21,208
- It's always them.

245
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,875
[eerie music]

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
- You sure this
is Lennon's place?

247
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,000
- Pretty sure.

248
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
I was here like two nights
ago. We play poker on Tuesdays.

249
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,583
- Lennon?

250
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,375
He hates gambling.

251
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,041
He hates people.

252
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,208
- He changed his mind?

253
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,375
- Something changed.

254
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,416
If you two are so chummy,

255
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,708
why don't you just
ask him for the thing?

256
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,541
- Hell no!

257
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,625
He's got a crazy short fuse.

258
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,375
He's like the world's
scariest math teacher.

259
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,125
Hey Lennon, you know that
thing that you stole from work?

260
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:13,333
Can I have it?

261
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,708
- I can't believe
we're doing this.

262
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:21,041
- Not stealing if
it's already stolen.

263
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,625
- You know that's not
actually true, right?

264
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:51,541
- Think you can hurry
that up a little bit?

265
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,166
What?

266
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:16,375
[spray misting]

267
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,791
So you were James
Bond in another life?

268
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,958
[tense music]

269
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,166
Is that real money?

270
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,083
What, you're a hotshot
card player now, too?

271
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:02,958
- [Vince] You check that side.

272
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,166
- [Scott] Come on, where is it?

273
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:48,750
Why does he have the blueprints
for a Large Hadron Collider?

274
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,333
- How pissed do
you think he'll be

275
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,208
when he finds out we've
that we scaled that down

276
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,000
to fifty feet in your garage?

277
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,500
- I don't think he'll
be very pissed at all.

278
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,750
- Ha.

279
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,583
Got it.

280
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,083
Why the fuck does he have that?

281
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,875
- These are all the parts
to a particle accelerator.

282
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,166
Why would he have this?

283
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,625
Did you tell him what
we're working on?

284
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,041
- Me?
No, did you?

285
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,125
- No of course not, Vince.
What the hell is going on?

286
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,166
[far off coughing]

287
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,791
[gunshot firing]

288
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,625
[Lennon groaning]

289
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,041
[Lennon gasping]

290
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,083
- [Masked Man] You
stupid son of a bitch.

291
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,166
You brought this upon yourself.

292
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,000
[Lennon groaning]

293
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,208
- No wait, where are you going?

294
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,291
- [Vince] He's gone.

295
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,083
- You don't know that.

296
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:33,125
- He's gone, come on.

297
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,500
Come on.

298
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,583
- Oh God, they took him.

299
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,166
He killed a man.

300
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:56,333
He killed him, and we
didn't do anything.

301
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,041
- He had a gun.

302
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,541
- We could have done
something, we didn't know that.

303
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,416
- He had a gun!

304
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,291
- What the hell's
going on, Vince?

305
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:08,416
- We have what we
need, let's go.

306
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,708
We were never here.

307
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,958
- Whoa, are you serious?

308
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,750
We can't.

309
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,541
We gotta call the police.

310
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:14,083
- And explain what first?

311
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,875
The breaking and entering, or
the glowing fucking battery?

312
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,583
- Unbelievable.

313
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,958
Why would they take his body?

314
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,083
- We need to go.

315
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,166
Now.

316
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,000
Scott!

317
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,916
[car beeping]

318
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,625
[birds chirping]

319
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,083
- Hey.

320
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:57,958
- You look tired, babe.

321
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,208
- Yeah, I didn't sleep too well.

322
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,458
- Is everything okay?

323
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,375
- Yeah.

324
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:08,875
Yeah, we kinda had a setback.

325
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,083
- I'm sure you'll figure it out.

326
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,708
Stargate's got nothing on you.

327
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,833
- Stargate goes to
different worlds, babe.

328
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:19,000
Theoretically, this will take us

329
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,375
to different versions
of the same world.

330
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:21,666
- [laughing] Nerd.

331
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,291
So I have to do a night
video shoot tonight.

332
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,166
I'm gonna explain snipe hunting.

333
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,375
So don't wait up.

334
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,625
- [Vince] Scott.

335
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,000
Have you heard anything?

336
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:34,875
- I haven't heard anything.
Have you heard anything?

337
00:21:34,916 --> 00:21:35,750
- I haven't heard anything.

338
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,666
Why haven't you heard anything?

339
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,958
- Gentlemen!

340
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,083
Good, you're both here.

341
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,666
Dr. Lennon would
like to talk with you

342
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:42,916
in the conference room.

343
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,250
- Oh, boys!

344
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:10,708
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior yesterday

345
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,750
in front of Miss Fanning,

346
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,583
and the head of
this establishment.

347
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,083
It was very unprofessional.

348
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,375
- Do you accept Dr.
Lennon's apology?

349
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,291
- Yeah, of course.

350
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,541
- No problem.

351
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,541
- Great.

352
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,375
With that unpleasantness
out of the way,

353
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,375
then we can all
get back to work.

354
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,041
Gentlemen.

355
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,166
- Keep up the good work, guys.

356
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,875
We'll figure this out just yet.

357
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:44,500
- What the hell?

358
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,083
Are we slipping into The
Twilight Zone or something here?

359
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:50,083
- We saw it happen.

360
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:52,250
Right?

361
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,208
We saw it.

362
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,750
- Bet your ass we did.

363
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,791
- Maybe last night was a trick

364
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,083
to mess with us for breaking in.

365
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:07,333
- I don't know.

366
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,416
- Let's hope this works.

367
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,958
- Going deeper
into the weirdness.

368
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,750
Why not?

- Coordinates?

372
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,333
- Locked, 4.994%
ordinary matter.

373
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,958
- And a whole bunch of zeroes?

374
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,041
- And a whole bunch of zeroes.

375
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,666
- [Scott] Energy level?

376
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,916
- 77 teraelectronvolts.

[tense instrumental music]

378
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,541

383
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,708
- You really did it.

384
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,000
- We really did it.

385
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,583
- How long will it stay open?

386
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,541
- With the cryonic
battery, who knows?

387
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:35,375
Maybe forever.

388
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,458
Okay. Gravity readings,
do you have any decay?

389
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
[keyboard clacking]

390
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:43,916
- Nothing.

391
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:45,875
It's like the door
isn't even there.

392
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,000
How is it the same?

393
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,041
Infinite possibilities,
and we dial into a mirror.

394
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:16,916
- I wanna cross over.

395
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,375
- I don't think we should.

396
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,458
- [Scott] What?

397
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,750
- Not there.

398
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,583
- Why not?

399
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,250
- It's the same.

400
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,333
Doesn't that bother you?

401
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,750
- Bother me how?

402
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:32,000
We just smashed particles
faster than anyone, ever.

403
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:34,125
We ripped open space and time.

404
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
- Scott, it's the same!

405
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,958
Your room, your garage,
your test dummy.

406
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,375
Same room and same
dummy means same us.

407
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,958
A trillion, trillion,

409
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:50,041
and we just happen
to dial into the one

410
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:51,500
that could have our
damn doppelgangers?

411
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:52,541
- They were your coordinates.

412
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,958
- [Vince] And I was wrong.

413
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:57,666
- No, Vince, this one's perfect.

414
00:25:58,833 --> 00:25:59,958
What happens if we
choose to open a doorway

415
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
that's 4.994% with
1,000 zeroes after it,

416
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:07,250
but a one at the very end,
instead of another zero?

417
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,958
And that leads us to some
Earth that's long gone,

418
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,333
and we turn Arizona into
a literal black hole.

419
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,375
- You know as well as I do
that we would need an extreme,

420
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:17,000
like 1% or 10% gravity
and comparative matter

421
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,250
before we find an Earth that's
populated by sand people!

422
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:21,416
- That's why this one's perfect.

423
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:23,333
We hit a home run
in our first at-bat.

424
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,000
Vince, look.

425
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,250
Between Lennon dying, and
then not dying, and now this,

426
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,833
it's been a crazy few days.
All right, we'll figure it out.

427
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,250
- Don't open it
again without me.

428
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,041
Right?

429
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,416
- Right.
- Right?

430
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,333
- Got it!

431
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:44,750
Won't open it without you.

432
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,583
- This is a nice surprise.

433
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,208
I thought you'd
be in the garage.

434
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,625
- We need to talk.

435
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,375
- What happened?

436
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:12,000
Did someone die?

[crickets chirping]

438
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,125
So why didn't you
call the police?

439
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,250
- Yeah, they're usually letting
people off with warnings

440
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:28,541
for breaking and
entering nowadays.

441
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:31,666
It doesn't matter, 'cause
apparently he's alive and fine.

442
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,333
- This is so bizarre, Scott.

443
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,791
I mean, it's gotta be
some kind of a trick.

444
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,958
Do you think he's just
messing with you guys?

445
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,125
- I don't know.

446
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,083
Maybe we're not meant
to understand it.

447
00:27:44,916 --> 00:27:48,541
- But the particle
accelerator works?

448
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,000
Like, for real?

449
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,208
- [Scott] Yeah.

450
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:55,250
- I'm so proud of you!

451
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,916
When do I get to see it?

452
00:27:58,958 --> 00:27:59,833
- Soon.

453
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,166
Vincent needs to be here.

454
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,000
- I knew you could do it.

You're gonna find out, like,
what makes the universe tick.

No, the what?

00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:25,750
- Yeah.

00:31:25,791 --> 00:31:27,000
As in two objects
of the same matter

00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,750
can't exist on the same side.

00:31:30,041 --> 00:31:32,083
If that doorway to your
matterverse closes behind you,

00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:33,833
with both of us here,

477
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,208
one of us goes, "Poof!"

It's a toss of the
dice which one of us

takes the long trip goodbye.

Still not sure where they
go, but it looks painful.

00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:45,958
- Wow.

482
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This is overwhelming.

483
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,833
- Yeah, I've heard that before.

484
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,958
Bet you're wondering about
that dummy over there.

485
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,125
Never really found
much use for it,

486
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,041
but we all seem to
buy the same dummy.

487
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,333
I bought one, because I
figured with endless universes

488
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:07,125
and endless variables,
a constant would

489
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,083
What'd you name it?

490
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,083
- What?

491
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,541
- [Other Scott] The
dummy, Jimmy or Johnny?

492
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:18,666
- Oh, Jay.

493
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,166
I named it Jay.

494
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,375
I guess I thought I
would throw it through

495
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,333
before I just walked
through on my own.

496
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,291
- Very curious.

497
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,958
The names have always been.

498
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,333
- I'm sorry, did you
say, "All of us"?

499
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:36,291
- This isn't our first
time together, Scott.

500
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:40,041
No, not the first time for
you in another version of us.

501
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,291
36 Scotts have all traveled
through space and time,

502
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,500
and into my workshop.

503
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,125
You're 37.

504
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,666
So forgive my lack
of enthusiasm,

505
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:52,708
but I think even God stopped
being surprised after a while.

506
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,375
- I never cared much for tea.

507
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,958
- I didn't make it for you.

508
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,750
[slurping tea]

509
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,250
What's your matter variable?

510
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:07,916
- Five, a bunch of
zeroes, nine, seven

511
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,250
as far as I was able to tell.

512
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:15,458
I'm sorry, why do all
of us come here to you?

513
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,333
- There's an immeasurable number

514
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:21,083
of universes out there, Scottie.

515
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,000
A different world for
every different person,

516
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:25,291
for every different outcome.

517
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:28,583
So if you take an
immeasurable number of people

518
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:30,041
and ask them to
all choose a number

519
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:32,250
between one and a million,
eventually you'll get enough

520
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:34,125
to choose the same
number, right?

521
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:38,166
And so far, 37 Scotts
have all lived lives

522
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:41,041
that lead to this machine,
to this point in time,

523
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:44,125
to the exact 4.994%
ordinary matter.

524
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,208
And a bunch of zeroes.

525
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,958
- Have you ever crossed over?

526
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,791
- No.

527
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:05,791
You can touch me, Scott.

528
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,916
Like I said,
expulsion only happens

529
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:10,291
when that doorway closes,

530
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:12,625
in which case, you
and I would be in

531
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:14,000
for one hell of a pickle.

532
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,750
- You had your own machine.

533
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,166
- I did.

534
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,000
Once.

535
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,083
Couldn't create a
sustainable power source.

536
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,166
Speaking of which,
you have any more

537
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,750
of those cryonic batteries?

538
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,750
- How do you know about that?

539
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:34,166
- It's not my first rodeo.

540
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,541
- Well no, I only have the one,

541
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:40,375
and it's being used to
power the doorway right now.

542
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:41,208
- Only one.

543
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,041
It's a shame.

544
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,666
Although, I wonder if
you could get another one

545
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,250
from Cicero before
it's too late.

546
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,708
- What do you mean?

547
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,166
- Cicero stole my
machine, Scott.

548
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,750
They manipulated it.

549
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,583
Bastardized it.

550
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,958
They gained too much
power too quickly,

551
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,666
and it was too much to control.

552
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,833
They're responsible
for the worst

553
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,250
man-made disaster of all time.

554
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,291
Countless people died.

555
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,875
Everyone in Cicero is
gone, I'm all that's left.

556
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,083
Even Vincent's gone.

557
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:22,250
- Vincent?

558
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:27,125
No, that's impossible.

559
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,875
How could they
steal my technology?

560
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,583
- You ever heard of
Project Milestone?

561
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,666
- Only rumors, whispers.

562
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:35,500
- Scott.

563
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,166
Project Milestone is you.

564
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,125
- No.

565
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,708
That's impossible.

566
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,208
- I guarantee it.

567
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,875
If your universe is
anything like mine,

568
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:51,541
they've been watching you for
a long time, studying you.

569
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,000
Waiting for you to succeed.

570
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,250
They did the same to me.

571
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,166
You're more special
than you know.

572
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,750
- What are you trying to say?

573
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,000
- Your machine is the only one

574
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,416
that can create a stable path.

575
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,708
They wanna use it to
connect everything,

576
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,166
like some master pathway.

577
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,083
But not just two worlds, Scott.

578
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,291
All of them.

579
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:19,000
Scott.

580
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:22,083
Project Milestone is
you leading Cicero

581
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:26,000
to a singularity in which
they control the multiverse.

582
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,791
- How do you know all this?

583
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,083
- Just watch yourself, Scottie.

584
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:37,500
These people you work
for turned a quarter

585
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:39,500
of my United States
into no man's land.

586
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,166
They tried here once
and they failed,

587
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,000
and now you're on the clock.

588
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,416
Be careful who you trust.

589
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:59,666
- This is a lot to take in.

590
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:03,666
I need to talk to
my wife and Vince.

591
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,458
- Your wife?

592
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,041
- [Scott] Listen, this has
been beyond amazing, thank you.

593
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:15,000
- But you will come back.

594
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:15,833
- I'll be back.

595
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,041
- [Other Scott] You always do.

596
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,666
[remote clicking]

597
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,208
[phone ringing]

598
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,958
- [Vince] This is
Vince, leave a message.

599
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,041
- Vince. Hey, call me back
when you get this, all right?

600
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,125
We need to chat.

601
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,083
Just call me back.

602
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,500
- Hello, Scott.

603
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,166
No partner in crime?

604
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:18,791
How is the family?

605
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:21,041
It's Margaret?

606
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:21,958
Margail, isn't it?

607
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,458
She's such a sweetheart.

608
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:28,208
- I really should
get back to work.

609
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,333
- You really should.

610
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,250
- Hello!

611
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,291
- Hi there.

612
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,166
- Just out enjoying my walk.

613
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,291
- I can see that.

614
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,000
You live nearby?

615
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,916
- Why, yes.

616
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:02,083
- Oh, I haven't seen you before.

617
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,333
Have you just moved in?

618
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,125
- That's a very fancy
camera you have there.

619
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,875
- Yeah, it's not great,

620
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:11,666
but it works for me.

621
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:14,416
I just make videos
and teach people

622
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,833
how to do odd jobs
around the house.

623
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:19,458
- And what does
your husband make?

624
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,625
- He works at Cicero
Market Technologies.

625
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:28,375
- Oh, that's a very large
company, like Haliburton.

626
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,041
- Something like that, yeah.

627
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,166
- Can he protect you?

628
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,541
- Excuse me?

629
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:43,625
- You're a beautiful woman.

630
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:45,375
He should be able
to protect you.

631
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:49,333
- It's been great
chatting with you,

632
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:52,166
I really gotta get
back to work here.

633
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,166
Will I be seeing you around?

634
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:56,083
- Oh yes.

635
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,125
[laughing]

636
00:39:57,166 --> 00:39:58,291
I'll keep an eye out for you!

637
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:15,541
- Oh, shit.

638
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:49,750
[dramatic music]

639
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:02,375
[metal clanking]

640
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
[suspenseful music]

641
00:42:42,666 --> 00:42:45,375
[gunshot firing]

642
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:58,125
- It doesn't have
to be this way.

643
00:42:58,166 --> 00:43:00,000
- [Masked Man] I don't
want to kill you.

644
00:43:00,041 --> 00:43:02,291
I wanted you to see how
easily someone could have.

645
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,375
- Just let me go back.

646
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,166
- [Masked Man] There is no back.

647
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:10,000
Uh-uh.

648
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,958
- What do you mean?

649
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,208
- [Masked Man] Cicero.

650
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,708
They keep trying, and
they keep screwing up.

651
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,958
You keep screwing up, and
now worlds are disappearing.

652
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,708
They're gone.

653
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,208
You have to stop him, Vincent.

654
00:43:25,125 --> 00:43:25,958
- Who?

655
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,625
- [Masked Man] Scott.

656
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:30,041
You have to stop him
before he kills everyone.

657
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:34,583
[portal buzzing]

658
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,541
- [Vince] What the
hell is going on?

659
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,125
- Do you think that
is what I think it is?

660
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,000
- Looks an awful lot like a bug.

661
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:09,500
[shoe smacking]

662
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:13,291
Well, whatever it is,
it's not working anymore.

663
00:44:14,625 --> 00:44:18,333
- Someone has planted a
bug in our house, Scott.

664
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:21,166
Someone is listening to us.

665
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,166
- Did you check the
rest of the house?

666
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:23,500
- Of course I did.

667
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:24,541
I looked everywhere.

668
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,083
Maybe it's just the one?

669
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,083
Do you think Vincent would have
like a scanner or something

670
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:38,000
that looks for bugs, like on TV?

671
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,041
- He might, but.

672
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:42,125
- [Margail] But what?

673
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:46,541
- He didn't show
up to work today,

674
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,166
and I can't get ahold of him.

675
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,083
What the hell is
going on, Scott?

676
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,791
Why would someone
wanna spy on us?

677
00:44:57,041 --> 00:44:58,083
- I may have an idea.

678
00:45:00,166 --> 00:45:02,166
There's someone I
want you to meet, but.

679
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,000
Honey, you might
wanna prepare yourself

680
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,208
for a bit of a shock.

681
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:17,541
[remote clicking]

682
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:20,375
[machine buzzing]

683
00:45:24,666 --> 00:45:25,625
- Oh, shit!

684
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:26,458
- Is that safe?

685
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,875
- Margail, it's really you.

686
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,125
After all this time,
it's really you.

687
00:45:34,083 --> 00:45:35,250
You look just like her.

688
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:38,125
- You look just like him.

689
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:39,916
- Scott.

690
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:40,750
- Yes, Scottie?

691
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,666
- How many times
have you guys talked?

692
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:47,916
- Only once.

693
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:49,625
Vincent doesn't know yet.

694
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,458
- You did this alone?

695
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,000
- I was feeling adventurous.

696
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:02,166
- Just the one?

697
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:03,750
- [Scott] Unfortunately, yes.

698
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
- Is there one of
me on your side?

699
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,166
- Sadly, no.

700
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:19,125
My Margail passed away
when we were teenagers.

701
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:21,041
I never thought
I'd see you again.

702
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,666
- What happened to her?

703
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:29,500
- She was sick.

704
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,500
That's how I originally
chose my career path

705
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,958
with Cicero Market Technologies.

706
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,208
I thought that if
I could find a way

707
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,000
to slow down or freeze
time, I could come up

708
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:41,583
with the exact timeframe
I needed to find a cure.

709
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,083
I didn't want anyone to go
through what she went through.

710
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:47,416
- [Margail] I'm so sorry.

711
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:51,333
- You're the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

712
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:57,208
- Flattered, I mean.

713
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,166
That's flattering.

714
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,625
- Scott, we need to talk
to you about Cicero.

715
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:05,000
- So you two have been
together this whole time?

716
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,750
- Scott, you said Cicero
was following you?

717
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:12,583
- Yes, spies and
electronic eavesdropping.

718
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,833
- We've found something strange.

719
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:19,208
We think it's some sort
of listening device.

720
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,708
- Well, if you found
one, it's one of many.

721
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,583
Has anyone acted
strangely around you?

722
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,708
- No.

723
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:25,750
- Yes.

724
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:26,833
A man.

725
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:27,625
- What?

726
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:29,000
Who?
When?

727
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:32,125
- Today, an old man
talked to me out front.

728
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:35,958
He asked me if I felt safe.

729
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,208
- That's them, I'm sorry.

730
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,958
All I can tell you is,

731
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,083
watch yourselves.

732
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:43,500
Don't trust anyone.

733
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:45,166
Not even Vincent.

734
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:46,625
- I trust Vincent with my life.

735
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,125
- You may have to.

736
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,208
You smell good.

737
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,375
- Perhaps that's
enough for one night.

738
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:03,750
- Perhaps.

739
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,166
- We appreciate it.

740
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:13,208
This has been bizarre,
and scary, and incredible.

741
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:16,583
- Margail.

742
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,000
If I could close that
magical door behind me

743
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:22,041
and stay here with
you forever, I would.

744
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:25,583
You're the loveliest
creature I've ever seen.

745
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:33,666
Again?

746
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:34,500
- Soon.

747
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,000
- I'll hold you to that.

748
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,916
[Margail sighs]

749
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:51,750
- Wow.

750
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,166
You did it.

751
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,166
[laughing]

752
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,458
So we're just keeping
up appearances.

753
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,083
You're not gonna confront
Cicero about this?

754
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:21,041
- Still no word from Vincent.

755
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,041
I'm starting to get
real worried, babe.

756
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:25,333
- Scott, I've been
thinking about this,

757
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:28,958
and maybe it's time to
consider that this whole thing

758
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,541
is just beyond our control.

759
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:32,333
- No, no, no, no.

760
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:33,625
No, we can't stop now.

761
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:36,166
Think of all the
technological applications.

762
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:38,708
No more landfills, no more
running out of resources.

763
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,791
- Okay, so you wanna
run a oil pipeline

764
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,750
through a portal to
an alternate reality?

765
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:47,458
- That's not exactly
what I meant.

766
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,041
- It's not exactly
what I meant either.

767
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:52,416
But I mean, people
are spying on us.

768
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:54,541
There's another Scott.

769
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:57,875
I mean, he is definitely
freaking me out

770
00:49:57,916 --> 00:50:01,000
the more I think about it,
and he's definitely not you,

771
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:02,833
regardless of the similarity.

772
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,958
- Nature versus
nurture, I guess.

773
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,041
Technically, though,
we are the same DNA.

774
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,958
- Yeah, well technically,
he still freaks me out.

775
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,083
All of this does.

776
00:50:15,416 --> 00:50:16,625
- I know, babe.

777
00:50:16,666 --> 00:50:19,666
[suspenseful music]

778
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:23,916
[buzzing]

779
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:34,666
I don't know why he
thinks Cicero will

780
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:36,541
- Maybe they really
do wanna build

781
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:38,041
an oil pipeline through it.

782
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:39,666
- No, they could
buy the IP from us

783
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:41,958
and turn it into a gold mine.

784
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,625
Now, when this goes public,

785
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,041
everyone's gonna wanna see it.

786
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:53,541
- Unless they have a
reason to keep it secret.

787
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:03,291
Okay Scott, enough with the
unlimited resources bullshit.

788
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:06,625
What's the real reason you're
so obsessed with this thing?

789
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:14,583
What's going on?

790
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:22,541
[somber music]

791
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,833
- I never told
you how Sean died.

792
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,208
- Yeah, you did.

793
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,333
I thought it was a car accident.

794
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:32,083
- No, this project.

795
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:35,125
It gives us a chance to go back.

796
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:36,208
- I don't understand.

797
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:46,750
- My grandpa collected
World War II era weapons.

798
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,333
Pistols, rifles, such.

799
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:53,208
I remember when I
was a little boy,

800
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,125
my mom spanked my
butt so hard one time

801
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:57,125
when I left the
cabinet unlocked.

802
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:58,583
Yeah, I was six years old.

803
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:01,208
I knew they were dangerous,
but I wanted to have fun.

804
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:07,125
I left it unlocked.

805
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:13,416
Sean was four years old.

806
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:15,333
He wanted to play too.

807
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:19,791
That's how my brother died.

808
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,125
The whole idea of this project
of smashing God particles

809
00:52:29,166 --> 00:52:31,291
and creating doorways
into other dimensions.

810
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,958
If there's infinite
worlds out there,

811
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,375
then there's a different world
for every different outcome,

812
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:41,833
for every different person.

813
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,916
Maybe there's a world
where I didn't do that.

814
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:55,958
I want that world, Margail.

815
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:01,083
[phone vibrating]

816
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,625
- [Margail] I'm so sorry.

817
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,125
- Vince?

818
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:10,208
We've been trying to reach.

819
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,833
Yeah.

820
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:13,708
Yeah, yeah, no.

821
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,166
I'll be right out, two minutes.

822
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:19,916
That was Vince.

823
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,208
He sounded really weird.

824
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:27,750
I gotta go.

825
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,333
- Go ahead, go talk to him.

826
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:30,708
Get to work.

827
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,125
I guess we'll just take
this one day at a time.

828
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:42,708
- Hey.

829
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:48,916
- I didn't wanna risk using a
cellphone if I didn't have to.

830
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:49,791
- What happened?

831
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,125
- You're never gonna believe me.

832
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:53,708
- I was about to
say the same thing.

833
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,125
- Well, I was shot at
and held at gunpoint

834
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,500
by a man who used
what sure as hell

835
00:53:57,541 --> 00:54:00,041
looked like a portable
version of our technology

836
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:02,083
to zip out of existence
right in front of me.

837
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:04,041
Oh, and this was
right after he told me

838
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:06,291
that you're going
to murder the world.

839
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:08,875
And my left eyelid has not
stopped fucking twitching since.

840
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,000
- He said I was
gonna kill people?

841
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:11,791
Are you sure?

842
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,000
- Yes, I'm fucking sure!

843
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:17,916
He said that you and
Cicero did something,

844
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,791
and worlds are disappearing.

845
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,708
As in more than one.

846
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,250
- Could we have caused a
decimating ripple in space time?

847
00:54:25,708 --> 00:54:27,291
How do we know this guy knows
what he's talking about?

848
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:28,458
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

849
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,083
Let's question the
credibility of the man

850
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:32,375
who conjured a portal
right in front of me.

851
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:34,583
Oh also, forgot to tel you.

852
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:36,291
I also found in
Lennon's rock garden,

853
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:37,916
because that makes sense.

854
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:39,708
There was a stack
of Cicero papers

855
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,958
with the design for our
particle accelerator,

856
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,250
and a blueprint for your house.

857
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,041
- You serious?

858
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:47,250
- Yes I'm fucking serious.

859
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:48,083
- Damn it.

860
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:51,041
- I thought we'd
have enough time,

861
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:53,708
but apparently
they already know.

862
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,125
- A portable doorway.

863
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,166
- Yeah, it was like.

864
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,416
Like this light stick he
just tossed on the ground,

865
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:02,250
and there was the door,
and then there wasn't.

866
00:55:03,416 --> 00:55:05,291
I tried to pick it
up, but it was cold,

867
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:07,041
and then it was just gone.

868
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,875
Scott, when it was open,
it was just like ours.

869
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:13,583
I think a little pee came out.

870
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:15,791
- The other Scott
said that Cicero was--

871
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:16,583
- Wait, wait, what?

872
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:17,375
What?
Wait.

873
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:18,166
Scott!

874
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:19,208
Scott who?

875
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,583
- Oh yeah, it gets better/worse.

876
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:24,083
I met a Scott from the other
side when I opened the portal.

877
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:27,125
Listen, Margail found
a listening device

878
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:31,750
- They really are
watching us, aren't they?

879
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:33,958
- We have to go back to work,
and keep up appearances.

880
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,375
- [Vince] We need to slow down.

881
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,083
- Cicero spent over
a billion dollars

882
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,500
getting us to
freeze sick people.

883
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:40,250
Why would they have any
interest in alternate universes?

884
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:42,958
- Maybe they're the ones
keeping up appearances.

885
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,541
- Maybe freezing people
and waking them up

886
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:45,833
in the future is plan B.

887
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,833
- Scott, I need
you to promise me.

888
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:55,041
Don't open the door
again without me, okay?

889
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:58,041
Things are clearly
getting out of hand.

890
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,208
- No, agreed.

891
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,750
Cicero's gonna
watch us so closely.

892
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:03,166
We gotta be extra
careful opening a

893
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:05,125
beyond space and
time in my garage.

894
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:09,083
Words I never thought
I'd say out loud.

895
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:11,375
[Vince chuckling]

896
00:56:11,416 --> 00:56:13,166
Did someone really shoot at you?

897
00:56:14,083 --> 00:56:14,875
- Yep.

898
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,833
- Man.

899
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:18,750
- Yep.

900
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:27,000
[car engine whirring]

901
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:46,708
[Margail sighing]

902
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:53,458
[suspenseful music]

903
00:57:09,916 --> 00:57:13,583
[remote buzzing and beeping]

904
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:23,166
[machines buzzing]

905
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:35,541
[dramatic music]

906
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:58,083
[suspenseful music]

907
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:15,291
- [Margail] You came back.

908
00:59:17,416 --> 00:59:19,208
- I wanted to see you.

909
00:59:21,208 --> 00:59:22,208
- Oh, I see.

910
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:41,708
- I can feel it.

911
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:51,333
- How soon?

912
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:10,000
- Well, day one of pretending
everything's normal, check.

913
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:12,125
- Scott, I've been thinking.

914
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:13,458
That guy at Lennon's rock garden

915
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,583
went out of his way
to make a point.

916
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:16,791
He could have killed me,

917
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:19,458
but instead he decided
to warn me, warn us,

918
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,291
about you.

919
01:00:23,375 --> 01:00:25,625
- So you don't trust me now?

920
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:28,708
- Maybe he didn't mean you, you.

921
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:35,083
From here on out, I have to
be present for everything.

922
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:36,083
Okay?

923
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:37,083
- Yeah, already agreed.

924
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,500
- Yeah, yeah, I
know, I know, but.

925
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:41,208
I'll come back later tonight,

926
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,041
we'll open it one
last time, and then,

927
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,041
who knows?

928
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:48,958
- You're not saying we sell it?

929
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:49,791
Shut it down?

930
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,291
- [Vince] I don't know, man.

931
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,208
- I don't know either,
Vince, but I know that

932
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:57,250
this is our baby.

933
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:02,833
All right, well look, I'll
catch you tonight, all right?

934
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:04,500
- [Vince] Okay, see you later.
- Be safe.

935
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:08,000
- Well, hello.

936
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:18,125
- Hi.
- Hi.

937
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:28,000
So, I have an idea for a video,

938
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:30,083
and I'm gonna go check out
the lighting at the dog park.

939
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:32,500
So if it works, I
may be home late.

940
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:35,166
- Yeah, just be careful.

941
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,750
Things are uncertain right now.

942
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,166
- [Margail] I will.

943
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:44,166
- Have you noticed
anything new lately?

944
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:45,500
- Yeah, that's the thing.

945
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:46,708
It's like Vince, Margail
and I are being followed.

946
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,666
I don't know what to do.

947
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:49,625
- How is Margail?

948
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,041
She's quite the one
to behold, Scott.

949
01:01:53,083 --> 01:01:54,958
You should hang on to her.

950
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,958
- Scott, I think things are
starting to escalate over here.

951
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:03,125
- The love of your life dying

952
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:04,750
can really shape
a person, Scott.

953
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:11,208
- I'm sorry you had
to experience that.

954
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:12,375
- I like you, Scottie.

955
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:16,041
This is more contact than
I've had with the others.

956
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:19,125
Our relationships have always
been somewhat abbreviated.

957
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,833
- Scott, I don't know if it
was one of those watchers

958
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,208
from Cicero, or what, but
somebody followed Vince

959
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,208
and shot at him, and then
disappeared in what he said

960
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,250
looked like a portable
version of our doorway.

961
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,166
- Portable?

962
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:37,583
Curious.

963
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:41,833
- He said something about
other worlds are disappearing.

964
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,166
- Like mine.

965
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:50,375
All the way?

966
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:53,208
- I guess.

967
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:55,625
- No.

968
01:02:57,375 --> 01:02:59,625
No, they wouldn't make
that mistake again.

969
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:02,166
- Well, says the person
who's met 37 versions of us.

970
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:06,750
- You don't keep
very good notes,

971
01:03:06,791 --> 01:03:09,083
so they can't track you down.

972
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,166
- No, it's too dangerous to
leave too much information.

973
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,458
Somehow I've always
known just to keep

974
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,166
the important stuff right here.

975
01:03:19,958 --> 01:03:20,958
Should I be worried?

976
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:24,083
About interrogation?

977
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:25,666
Will they show aggression?

978
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:26,500
- No.

979
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,333
No, they won't
hurt you, not yet.

980
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:31,958
But they will become bolder.

981
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,458
Once they're certain
of your success,

982
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:37,375
they'll come out from hiding.

983
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,458
Any day now.

984
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,250
- Why wait?

985
01:03:42,958 --> 01:03:45,791
- You can't think of them
as a corporation, Scott.

986
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:47,541
That's a false identity.

987
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:50,041
A $32 billion fake ID.

988
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:54,791
No, the money, stocks,
employees, it's all

989
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,708
a means to an end.

990
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,291
What they want is to ascend.

991
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:00,125
- Ascend?

992
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:02,958
What?
To God?

993
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:08,875
- They wanna control everything.

994
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:11,041
Think of that kind of power.

995
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:14,333
If any world doesn't comply,
they just shut 'em off.

996
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:17,916
Expel them from existence.

997
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:21,291
It's trans-human garbage theory.

998
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:24,166
They wanna become one,
physically and spiritually,

999
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:25,875
with the universe, with God.

1000
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:29,041
Turn themselves into cosmos.

1001
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:30,916
- All of this for
religious fanaticism?

1002
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:32,000
- Not religion, Scott.

1003
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:34,916
Science.

1004
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,250
Think about it.

1005
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:38,583
You can push a button, and
end up in any universe.

1006
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:42,083
Maybe somewhere down
the line is heaven.

1007
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:43,750
Or hell.

1008
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:49,458
Make no mistake, they'll
come out from hiding.

1009
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,875
They'll make themselves known,

1010
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:52,833
and they will manipulate
every Scott in every universe

1011
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:54,166
'til they get what they want.

1012
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,125
Right now that's you.

1013
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:06,166
- [Scott] I think
I'm gonna be sick.

1014
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:10,833
- Bet you feel like
you just got off

1015
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,666
the Witch's Wheel
at the county fair.

1016
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,958
- You felt it.

1017
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,083
- That's the doorway.

1018
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:21,583
The gravity has its effects,
you'll get used to it.

1019
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:30,833
- Scott, I hope you
understand if after tonight

1020
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:32,916
I choose not to pursue
this any further.

1021
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:42,833
[tense beating music]

1022
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,000
- He can't keep her from me.

1023
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:09,375
I hope you understand if I
won't pursue it any further.

1024
01:06:09,416 --> 01:06:11,708
[yelling]

1025
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:14,416
[boxes rustling]

1026
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:27,125
- [Vince] Hey.

1027
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:31,416
Are you sure?

1028
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:34,291
- One more time.

1029
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:36,708
Collect any final data we can.

1030
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:37,500
- And then?

1031
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:47,625
Where is he?

1032
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:48,875
- He's usually waiting.

1033
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:51,125
- That's comforting.

1034
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:55,833
- Scott!

1035
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,375
Let's go.

1036
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:04,083
- Whoa, Scott, hang on.

1037
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,833
Are you sure you wanna
sneak in like this?

1038
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:09,666
Is it safe?

1039
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,541
- [Scott] It's not
the first house

1040
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:12,583
we've broken into this week.

1041
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:15,041
- Yeah, and someone
died that time.

1042
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:16,375
Sort of.

1043
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:18,250
- You're just mad 'cause
we didn't find dinosaurs.

1044
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:19,500
Where is he?

1045
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:21,791
- [Vince] He's like you,
but really disorganized.

1046
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:23,666
- [Scott] Scott?

1047
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,458
- I'm starting to have a
bad feeling about this.

1048
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:28,750
- You know scientists
achieve greatness

1049
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:30,916
at their own
personal risk, right?

1050
01:07:30,958 --> 01:07:32,666
They're willing to sacrifice.

1051
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:34,958
- I let you go first, didn't I?

1052
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,083
- You're in another dimension.

1053
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:37,208
Aren't you at least
a little excited?

1054
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,958
[boxes rustling]

1055
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,708
- Exciting isn't the word I
would choose to describe it.

1056
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:51,125
What did he tell
you about Margail?

1057
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:52,583
His Margail from this side?

1058
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,291
- [Scott] She died when
they were teenagers.

1059
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,083
- This is our photo.

1060
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,291
This was taken two years ago.

1061
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,666
- What did he say about her?

1062
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:11,000
What exactly did he tell you?

1063
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:11,791
- [Scott] What?

1064
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:12,833
- What did he say?

1065
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:18,250
- He said she got sick and died

1066
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:20,208
when they were teenagers, Vince.

1067
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:22,041
- Nothing specific?
Sick from what?

1068
01:08:22,083 --> 01:08:23,166
- I didn't ask.

1069
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:28,375
[boxes rustling]

1070
01:08:32,291 --> 01:08:33,375
- But why would he have this

1071
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:36,000
if she died years
before it was taken?

1072
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:37,250
- [Vince] Because he lied.

1073
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:52,333
- There must 40 or 50
cryonic batteries in here.

1074
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:54,125
- My guess would be 36.

1075
01:08:55,916 --> 01:08:57,416
- Well, Cicero doesn't
even have this many.

1076
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:58,666
How could he have this?

1077
01:08:58,708 --> 01:08:59,916
- We need to go.

1078
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:00,750
Now.

1079
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:05,291
[box rustling]

1080
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:06,708
- [Scott] They're all dead.

1081
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,500
- Come on!

1082
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,375
Scott, come on.

1083
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,666
- What was that?

1084
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,375
And why would he
lie about Margail?

1085
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,416
- It's not safe
to go back there.

1086
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:37,083
- They're your
coordinates, Vince.

1087
01:09:37,125 --> 01:09:39,875
- I know!

1088
01:09:39,916 --> 01:09:41,083
I know.

1089
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:48,000
- Why do I feel like there's
something more to this?

1090
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:22,833
- [Margail] Hey.

1091
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:24,458
You still up, babers?

1092
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,291
- Yeah.

1093
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:31,666
- [Margail] What are you doing?

1094
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:32,875
- I'm just thinking.

1095
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:33,958
How was the shoot?

1096
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,750
- It was great.

1097
01:10:36,083 --> 01:10:36,875
You okay?

1098
01:10:38,083 --> 01:10:39,916
- Yeah, yeah.

1099
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:40,958
- You coming to bed?

1100
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:42,958
- [Scott] I'll be
there in a little bit.

1101
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,791
- Okay.

1102
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,750
[suspenseful music]

1103
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:14,208
[Scott whistling]

1104
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:50,041
[Scott humming]

1105
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:50,875
- Hey, babe!

1106
01:11:54,083 --> 01:11:54,875
How was it?

1107
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:02,375
Excuse me, ma'am, I think
you're in the wrong house.

1108
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:04,000
- I'm supposed to
ask you nicely.

1109
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:10,791
- Ask me what?

1110
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:12,083
- May I have a cup of sugar?

1111
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:17,041
- Maybe you should
go to the store.

1112
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:20,458
- Will you give us what we ask?

1113
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,041
- I don't know what you want.

1114
01:12:24,083 --> 01:12:24,875
- Yes, you do.

1115
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:30,000
- What happens when
you get what you want?

1116
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:31,250
- I'll make you a cake.

1117
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:38,958
- Are you gonna kill me?

1118
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:39,750
[knife thumping]

1119
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:42,666
[jogger screaming]

1120
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:48,041
- [Other Scott] Come on, Scott!

1121
01:12:56,166 --> 01:12:57,208
- What are you doing?

1122
01:12:58,833 --> 01:12:59,708
- [Other Scott] Shut up!

1123
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:01,416
- [Jogger] Oh my god!

1124
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:05,583
[jogger screaming]

1125
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,166
Release me!

1126
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:15,125
- Wait your turn, sweetheart.

1127
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:17,083
- Scott, what are
you doing here?

1128
01:13:17,125 --> 01:13:18,875
- Saving your life.

1129
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:19,708
She was gonna kill you.

1130
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:21,416
- You don't know that.

1131
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:22,750
- Ask her yourself.

1132
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:26,000
I told you Cicero
was gonna get bolder.

1133
01:13:30,041 --> 01:13:34,250
The question is, which
Cicero does she work for?

1134
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:38,666
- Scott, she needs
an ambulance, now!

1135
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:40,791
- No, what she needs

1136
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,000
is salvation.

1137
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:48,333
Is that what I think it is?

1138
01:13:50,041 --> 01:13:50,875
- No!

1139
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:51,666
No, no, no, no!

1140
01:13:51,708 --> 01:13:52,500
That's mine!

1141
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,708
[sparks buzzing]

1142
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:56,500
Give it back!

1143
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:00,375
- I'll take that as a yes.
- What is that thing?

1144
01:14:04,041 --> 01:14:06,000
[sighing]

1145
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:10,166
- She's not from here.

1146
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:16,041
And that was only
a matter of time.

1147
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:21,041
This device is a cluster of
tiny accelerated particles

1148
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:23,750
acting as a tether when
combined with a foreign object.

1149
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:26,125
It makes her invisible.

1150
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,791
- A tether?

1151
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:34,541
- Follow me here, Scott.

1152
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:37,583
When a foreign
object, such as her.

1153
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:39,333
[jogger screaming]

1154
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:43,125
Has this on, they get to
coexist without an open doorway,

1155
01:14:43,166 --> 01:14:44,291
with no risk of expulsion.

1156
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:47,708
Thank you.

1157
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:50,708
- Wait, wait.

1158
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:53,208
Two of her can exist in our
universe at the same time?

1159
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:55,958
- Bingo, Scottie.

1160
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
My guess is this world
was a one-way ticket.

1161
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,666
Cicero needed him to open the
portal again, didn't they?

1162
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:12,083
- How long have you
been following me?

1163
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
- It doesn't matter now.

1164
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:19,541
All that matters is
that I have this.

1165
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:23,791
And that doorway
is the only thing

1166
01:15:23,833 --> 01:15:26,875
keeping your horrible
odds of survival at bay.

1167
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:29,125
Who will the universe expel?

1168
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:30,416
You?

1169
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:32,083
Or the other version of
you, out in the world

1170
01:15:32,125 --> 01:15:33,500
and completely
oblivious to the fact

1171
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:36,541
that they currently have a
50/50 chance of survival.

1172
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,041
How fun.

1173
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:45,333
[jogger yelling]

1174
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:47,791
Flip the switch, Scott.

1175
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:49,041
- No!

1176
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:50,291
No, no.

1177
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,541
- We can't do that.

1178
01:15:55,666 --> 01:15:58,041
- Flip the switch, Scott,
she's getting away.

1179
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:04,916
- No.

1180
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:06,875
No.

1181
01:16:07,833 --> 01:16:09,291
This isn't right, Scott!

1182
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,541
- No!

1183
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,791
No!

1184
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:32,500
[jogger screaming]

1185
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,500
Help me, please!

1186
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:50,083
- [Scott] You killed her!

1187
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:53,416
- [Other Scott] I'm
disappointed I you, Scottie.

1188
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,125
- Why are you here?

1189
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:58,375
- Why are any of us here, Scott?

1190
01:16:58,416 --> 01:16:59,791
- I didn't open
that doorway, Scott,

1191
01:16:59,833 --> 01:17:01,666
how did you cross
over on your own?

1192
01:17:01,708 --> 01:17:03,250
- You better take a
kinder tone with me.

1193
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:04,791
I didn't have to save you.

1194
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:08,041
- That picture of you and
Margail, you lied to me.

1195
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,000
- That doesn't sound
like gratitude.

1196
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:13,500
- How are you so calm?

1197
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,416
I'm gonna open this door,

1198
01:17:23,458 --> 01:17:25,875
and you're gonna go back
to your side for good.

1199
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:32,208
- [Other Scott] Or what?

1200
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,416
- Or I'll rip that new
toy out of your hand

1201
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:35,041
and we'll see who the
universe likes more.

1202
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:38,375
- That hurts, Scott.

1203
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,625
But I know you.

1204
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:45,041
I've known many of you.

1205
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,041
And if there's two things
I've learned it's that one,

1206
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:51,791
you wouldn't risk
expulsion on a coin toss.

1207
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:54,000
That much pain,
those kind of odds.

1208
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,041
And two,

1209
01:17:58,291 --> 01:18:00,583
the universe always chooses me.

1210
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:07,958
Oh, so you cross
over all willy-nilly,

1211
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
and now that the shoe's
on the other foot

1212
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:10,583
you got such a problem, huh?

1213
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:12,791
- You're not right, Scott.

1214
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:13,958
You killed that woman.

1215
01:18:15,416 --> 01:18:16,208
You enjoyed it.

1216
01:18:17,416 --> 01:18:18,416
- She deserved it.

1217
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:25,458
- This is the end for us, Scott.

1218
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,583
You're gonna go back over,

1219
01:18:26,625 --> 01:18:28,291
and I'm gonna unmake
this damn machine.

1220
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,958
- No, you won't.

1221
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,625
I know you won't,
because I wouldn't.

1222
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:33,541
- Go.

1223
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:43,833
- Give Margail my love.

1224
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:45,500
- You stay the
hell away from her.

1225
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:13,250
What have we done?

1226
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:19,541
[birds chirping]

1227
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:21,500
- Well, this is some
secret agent shit.

1228
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:26,291
- I don't think
anywhere is safe.

1229
01:19:26,333 --> 01:19:27,333
- Did something happen?

1230
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:28,541
- Yeah.

1231
01:19:28,583 --> 01:19:30,583
Some woman, I guess
she worked for Cicero,

1232
01:19:30,625 --> 01:19:31,791
came into my house,

1233
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,041
and then other Scott
appeared and killed her.

1234
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,500
- Wait, what?
What?

1235
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:38,791
- He was able to open the
doorway from his side.

1236
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:41,000
I don't know how, but
now he's got some device

1237
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:42,291
that looks like
pedometer that allows him

1238
01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:44,541
to exist on both sides.

1239
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:46,458
- How did he know she was there?

1240
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,916
The woman?

1241
01:19:47,958 --> 01:19:49,708
How did he know you
were in trouble?

1242
01:19:54,041 --> 01:19:55,083
- He can see us.

1243
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,250
Once the doorway was opened,

1244
01:19:58,291 --> 01:20:00,833
if the two universes share
a tangential connection--

1245
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:02,375
- Like a connected thread
between each universe?

1246
01:20:02,416 --> 01:20:04,375
- Then he can use the quantum
and gravimetric frequencies

1247
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:05,625
to generate an image?

1248
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:07,250
- Like a
trans-dimensional X-ray.

1249
01:20:08,916 --> 01:20:10,125
- God, he could see us.

1250
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:12,708
Margail!

1251
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:32,833
- Hey you.

1252
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,500
I got home like 20 minutes
ago, where were you?

1253
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:37,166
- Doesn't matter
now, you're okay.

1254
01:20:38,458 --> 01:20:39,875
You were right, babe.

1255
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:41,833
With everything you've been
through, this is my fault.

1256
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:48,125
I could do this forever.

1257
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:50,125
- What's gotten into you?

1258
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:52,750
- I just love you so much.

1259
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:54,250
- I love you too, Scott.

1260
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:56,208
- Say it again.

1261
01:20:57,083 --> 01:20:58,250
- I love you, Scott.

1262
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:12,041
- I could look at you forever.

1263
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,041
- Someone's in a mood.

1264
01:21:13,083 --> 01:21:14,125
- I am.

1265
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:16,125
I've missed you.

1266
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:18,833
- Yeah, these last few hours

1267
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,500
have been pretty
rough for me too.

1268
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:23,458
Are you not going
into work today?

1269
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:27,750
- What if I never go back?

1270
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:31,958
- Can you grab my phone for me?

1271
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,041
- Leave it.

1272
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:34,833
I don't want any interruptions.

1273
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:35,875
[Margail chuckling]

1274
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:38,083
- You're acting kinda weird.

1275
01:21:42,041 --> 01:21:44,083
- Why did we never have kids?

1276
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:48,125
- You want kids?

1277
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:49,416
Scott, are you okay?

1278
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,625
- Hindsight's always
20/20 I guess.

1279
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:56,250
- It's not too late.

1280
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,000
We can still talk about
having kids if you want.

1281
01:21:58,041 --> 01:21:59,791
- Run away with me.

1282
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:01,041
Right now.

1283
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:02,041
- Now?

1284
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,291
- Just go!

1285
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:06,250
Don't tell anyone, pack
a few things and leave.

1286
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:07,041
What do you say?

1287
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:08,583
Be dangerous with me.

1288
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:10,458
- [Margail] That
sounds outrageous.

1289
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:19,041
- Well, be outrageous with me.

1290
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:26,041
- [Margail] But aren't you
ignoring the obvious, Scott?

1291
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:29,666
- And what's that?

1292
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:33,541
- That I know my husband,

1293
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:36,041
and you, asshole, are not him.

1294
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:39,083
[suspenseful music]

1295
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:47,250
- I know this is
out of the blue.

1296
01:22:49,083 --> 01:22:50,875
I guess it's a
little weird, huh?

1297
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,416
I just been thinking
so much lately about--

1298
01:22:53,458 --> 01:22:54,750
- No, no, no, sorry.

1299
01:23:06,083 --> 01:23:08,375
Do not move any
closer, I swear to God.

1300
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,000
Don't!

1301
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,958
- What are you doing?

1302
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,208
Babe, it's me.

1303
01:23:20,541 --> 01:23:23,250
I know this is spontaneous,
but we don't have to live

1304
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:26,041
every part of our lives
according to some detailed plan.

1305
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:29,500
We can just get away!

1306
01:23:29,541 --> 01:23:30,666
- So is that your plan?

1307
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:32,500
You wanna just get
away, and play house?

1308
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:34,250
- Yes.

1309
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:37,625
We need this.

1310
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:38,916
- Don't come any closer!

1311
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:50,041
- You know you're
really starting to

1312
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,916
- Let's see how well you do
with a knife in your chest.

1313
01:23:55,333 --> 01:23:56,333
- Is that your plan?

1314
01:23:58,083 --> 01:23:59,208
Think this is a movie?

1315
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:03,625
If you wanna stab me, you
gotta do it right here.

1316
01:24:03,666 --> 01:24:04,500
Between the ribs.

1317
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,000
And you better kill me
with the first blow,

1318
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:10,291
'cause if you don't, I'm
liable to get very angry!

1319
01:24:13,041 --> 01:24:15,416
- [Scott] Margail!

1320
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:18,791
[other Scott groaning]

1321
01:24:19,875 --> 01:24:21,333
- [Vince] Oh, shit.

1322
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:28,708
- That's the sternum!

1323
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,041
Hey, Scott.

1324
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,416
I was just talking to our wife.

1325
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:36,000
Oh.

1326
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:39,000
Hi Vincent

1327
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,000
- Hello Scott.

1328
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,166
- It's you, isn't it?

1329
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:45,666
- I should say the same to you.

1330
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:47,666
- Surprise.

1331
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,125
- What's he talking
about, Vince?

1332
01:24:50,166 --> 01:24:52,125
- It's what I was afraid of.

1333
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:53,625
- Afraid of getting caught.

1334
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:57,041
Tell me Vince,

1335
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:58,750
did you even consider the
life of the other Vincent

1336
01:24:58,791 --> 01:25:00,125
who really lived here?

1337
01:25:00,166 --> 01:25:02,083
Or was that an
equitable risk for you?

1338
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:03,125
- [Scott] Vince?

1339
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:06,208
- He's not your Vincent.

1340
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:09,291
- [Scott] How long?

1341
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:11,458
- Two years.

1342
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,958
I'm sorry, Scott.

1343
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,041
- Vincent!

1344
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:15,166
- I did what I had
to do to survive.

1345
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:18,208
He killed everyone at Cicero.

1346
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,750
He would have killed me
too if I hadn't escaped.

1347
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:23,250
- You lied to us for two years?

1348
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:26,666
You led us to him!

1349
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:27,541
- No, Scott!

1350
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:30,625
- We used your coordinates.

1351
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:32,333
- Scott, you're my friend,
that's why I stayed.

1352
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:34,000
I never thought
he would find us.

1353
01:25:35,541 --> 01:25:37,041
And those coordinates,
that wasn't his world.

1354
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:39,000
It's just where he was hiding.

1355
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:40,500
- Wasn't your world, either.

1356
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:48,791
- Scott, he killed Margail.

1357
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:55,125
- I should have killed you
while I had the chance!

1358
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:56,791
- You're mad.

1359
01:25:56,833 --> 01:25:58,208
- No, you let this happen.

1360
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:02,125
You could have dismantled that
portal at any time, but no!

1361
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:03,291
You were curious.

1362
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,291
Me?

1363
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:08,125
I've done this 36 times.

1364
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:11,375
36 bright-eyed, curious Scotts
have all come to see me!

1365
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,875
You know what I did each time?

1366
01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:17,833
I smiled.

1367
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:20,166
I conversed.

1368
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:23,625
And then I killed every
single one of 'em,

1369
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:25,416
and took their stupid batteries.

1370
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:29,333
It's an annoyingly
limited resource, Vince.

1371
01:26:31,125 --> 01:26:33,000
And then I would travel
from doorway to doorway

1372
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:36,041
looking for one where my
Margail was still alive.

1373
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:41,125
But then all the power died.

1374
01:26:41,166 --> 01:26:42,583
I wasn't hiding, Vince.

1375
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:48,625
I was stuck.

1376
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:52,166
So I decided to wait

1377
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:56,208
for another powder-white,
curious Scott to come see me.

1378
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:01,000
But you gave me something
so much more valuable.

1379
01:27:02,416 --> 01:27:06,500
You gave me a world where not
only is my love still alive,

1380
01:27:08,333 --> 01:27:09,250
but she loves me.

1381
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,791
[groaning]

1382
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Oh girl.

1383
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:25,500
I think you might have hit
something important after all.

1384
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:29,541
- How many people have you
killed since I ran from you?

1385
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:34,166
- Only myself, over and over.

1386
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:35,250
- No.

1387
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:36,583
Someone warned us.

1388
01:27:38,541 --> 01:27:41,166
- That's what it meant.

1389
01:27:41,208 --> 01:27:45,041
You've been changing
constants in every universe,

1390
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:46,750
and leaving a trail
of dead worlds.

1391
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:49,125
- No.

1392
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:51,125
Don't you get it, Scott?

1393
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:53,166
It doesn't matter.

1394
01:27:54,625 --> 01:27:56,041
None of it matters!

1395
01:27:58,166 --> 01:28:01,708
You wanna talk
about dead worlds?

1396
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:02,666
Look at me!

1397
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,000
My world is dead!

1398
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:15,125
Why did I deserve that?

1399
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:20,625
Why does your life
get to be so perfect?

1400
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,916
- We need to get him
back to his universe now,

1401
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:26,083
and shut it down for good.

1402
01:28:30,416 --> 01:28:32,000
- I think that's
probably enough.

1403
01:28:33,791 --> 01:28:36,041
- Shit, I should've
saw that coming.

1404
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:37,458
- Let's take a walk, shall we?

1405
01:28:49,958 --> 01:28:52,958
[suspenseful music]

1406
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,583
Roll call, everyone here?

1407
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:02,708
Good.

1408
01:29:04,583 --> 01:29:05,375
You know, Scott.

1409
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:08,041
Margail saved your life.

1410
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:11,708
That first night you
came into my world,

1411
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:13,000
I would have killed you.

1412
01:29:14,416 --> 01:29:16,750
But you said something
intriguing, you said, "My wife."

1413
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:19,583
That's when I decided to watch.

1414
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:21,500
To learn.

1415
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:27,041
- You wanted to replace me?

1416
01:29:27,083 --> 01:29:28,500
- [Other Scott]
It's not too late.

1417
01:29:28,541 --> 01:29:30,041
- I would rather die.

1418
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:37,083
- Everyone's a critic, Vince.

1419
01:29:37,125 --> 01:29:39,083
- What are you going
to do, asshole?

1420
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:40,458
- Oh yeah, 'cause
I'm the one who lied

1421
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,041
to my friend for
two years, right?

1422
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:43,041
- You're a psychopath.

1423
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:44,625
- It's neither here nor there.

1424
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:45,916
- Story of our lives.

1425
01:29:45,958 --> 01:29:47,958
- And I suppose I'll go
back to my adopted world

1426
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,958
at the 4.994 and
a bunch of zeroes.

1427
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,041
Yada, yada.

1428
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:56,041
Seems to be a constant
among many Scott's.

1429
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,125
So I think I belong there.

1430
01:30:01,916 --> 01:30:03,791
And I will find
you again, Margail.

1431
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,458
And next time it'll be perfect.

1432
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:10,583
On your knees.

1433
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:12,791
Now.

1434
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,208
Get down on your knees!

1435
01:30:17,583 --> 01:30:18,375
Now!

1436
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,166
- I won't let you hurt her.

1437
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,458
- Brave words for a dead man.

1438
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:33,791
[punch smacking]

1439
01:30:33,833 --> 01:30:35,666
[Margail screaming]

1440
01:30:35,708 --> 01:30:39,000
[banging and thudding]

1441
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:46,458
I should kill you right now!

1442
01:30:57,375 --> 01:30:59,125
You know, Margail.

1443
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:01,458
I don't know why you
love him so much.

1444
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,291
He's a prick.

1445
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,250
Why don't you love me?

1446
01:31:05,291 --> 01:31:06,083
- Scott.

1447
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:09,083
Just give me the gun.

1448
01:31:09,125 --> 01:31:10,250
Give me the gun, baby.

1449
01:31:11,583 --> 01:31:14,000
We can go somewhere together
and talk about this.

1450
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,250
- You'll do that for me?

1451
01:31:21,541 --> 01:31:23,958
You'll give me another chance?

1452
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,458
- I was too quick to
judge, I see that now.

1453
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:30,375
Just let me have the gun
before someone else gets hurt.

1454
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:35,083
I'll go with you
wherever you want.

1455
01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:43,333
[Margail yelling]

1456
01:31:43,375 --> 01:31:46,125
- Did you really think
I would fall for that?

1457
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:51,125
A for effort, though.

1458
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:52,208
- Scott.

1459
01:31:53,083 --> 01:31:54,833
How do scientists
achieve greatness?

1460
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:56,958
Sacrifice.

1461
01:31:58,833 --> 01:32:01,041
- [Scott] Vince, no!

1462
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:03,458
[tense music]

1463
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:08,000
[yelling]

1464
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:14,041
[remote clicking]

1465
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,833
- Who will it be, Scott?

1466
01:32:28,875 --> 01:32:30,375
Who will the universe expel?

1467
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:36,875
Let go, I can't hang on.

1468
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:42,083
- This is my world, Scott.

1469
01:32:42,125 --> 01:32:44,083
- I knew you were special.

1470
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:53,000
- I've been waiting for
you for a very long time.

1471
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:56,083
Your trail of death ends here.

1472
01:32:57,166 --> 01:33:00,083
[knife thudding]

1473
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:14,041
Listen to me very carefully.

1474
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:15,708
If, when that doorway closes,

1475
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:18,458
the universe decides to
expel him instead of you,

1476
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:24,416
take that thing,
destroy it, burn it.

1477
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:26,041
I don't care, just
get rid of it.

1478
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:29,875
- Wait!

1479
01:33:33,083 --> 01:33:36,208
There's so many of us
out there, what can I do?

1480
01:33:39,083 --> 01:33:40,000
- The right thing.

1481
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:45,125
I'm taking care of the
ones who don't listen.

1482
01:33:46,083 --> 01:33:47,500
You're different, Scott.

1483
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,875
Do as I say and
destroy that thing,

1484
01:33:54,958 --> 01:33:56,833
or I'll come back
and kill you myself.

1485
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:00,833
I'll always love
you, sweetheart.

1486
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:01,666
- Okay.

1487
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:17,916
- Scott?

1488
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:22,250
- Don't be me.

1489
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:24,625
Come on, don't be me.

1490
01:34:24,666 --> 01:34:25,458
- Scott.

1491
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:29,208
Are you okay, Scott?

1492
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:32,500
- Don't be me.

1493
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:33,541
Don't be me!

1494
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,750
- Scott, are you okay?

1495
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:44,000
- Don't be me.

1496
01:35:05,916 --> 01:35:08,875
Guess who just
dismantled the portal.

1497
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:11,375
Tell your people to stay
the hell away from me.

1498
01:35:11,416 --> 01:35:12,208
And you.

1499
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:15,166
Take whatever universe
you came from,

1500
01:35:15,208 --> 01:35:16,958
and shove it up your ass.

1501
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,208
- We can't stay here.

1502
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:19,750
- Wait, Scott!

1503
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:21,208
Wait!

1504
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:24,125
If you rebuild it, we can
give you anything you want.

1505
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:35,083
[wind gusting]

1506
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:54,583
[Vincent gasping]

1507
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:57,125
[upbeat music]

1508
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:45,000
- Shit.

1509
01:36:47,166 --> 01:36:47,958
- We don't have time for this.

1510
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,125
I'm me, you're you.

1511
01:36:49,166 --> 01:36:51,083
All right, get over it.

1512
01:36:53,166 --> 01:36:54,000
- What is this place?

1513
01:36:56,208 --> 01:36:59,833
- It's what every world will
look like if we don't stop it.

1514
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:01,083
- Stop what?

1515
01:37:01,125 --> 01:37:03,083
- The end of all creation.

1516
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:04,000
You coming?

1517
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,708
[upbeat music]

1518
01:37:59,291 --> 01:38:02,708
[children laughing]

1519
01:38:02,750 --> 01:38:05,666
[doorbell ringing]

1520
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:33,916
- Next time, girls.

1521
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,958
[dramatic music]
