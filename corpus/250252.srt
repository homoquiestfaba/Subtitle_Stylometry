1
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:29,825
I guess I knew this day would come.

2
00:00:29,867 --> 00:00:33,620
The day I have to bury a friend...

3
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:36,623
maybe my best friend.

4
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,750
We've been through a lot together,

5
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,753
some ugly moments.

6
00:00:40,794 --> 00:00:43,339
I remember when prompts came in,

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,133
the ventriloquism scare of '84.

8
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,719
Sure there were times when people 
 would make fun of you.

9
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:49,553
Imitating you...

10
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:51,638
"Hey did you ever notice?"

11
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:54,141
"What's the deal with this?"

12
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:58,187
Who are these people?

13
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:04,737
They say the hardest thing for a person 
 to do is bury a loved one.

14
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:08,032
But those people never had material like this

15
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:12,076
The Tide commercial: "if you've got a 
 T-shirt with blood stains all over it

16
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:16,664
maybe laundry isn't your biggest 
 problem right now."

17
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:29,344
I don't understand it.

18
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:32,848
He walks away from the show, 
 he walks away from his act...

19
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,849
Are you sure this kid is Jewish.

20
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:38,521
Oh, he's Jewish. And don't ask me how I know.

21
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:41,024
It's just such a waste.

22
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:45,069
I mean, it all works.

23
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:49,198
Is there any cake?

24
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:59,333
Gary, what are you doing?

25
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:03,379
Listen, I got nothing on the post office.

26
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:09,177
- All right, take it. 
 -Thanks.

27
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,139
Get outta here.

28
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,642
Did you ever see his act?

29
00:02:15,683 --> 00:02:18,519
No, not really, man.

30
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:19,938
Did you?

31
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:23,024
Yeah, yeah. He was good.

32
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:25,944
But I was full of drugs.

33
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:27,737
Ed, did you ever see his act?

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,533
Oh, he did the "Tonight Show" many, many times.

35
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:33,244
But, no.

36
00:02:33,285 --> 00:02:36,038
Jerry, thanks a lot for being here. 
 This really means a lot.

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,331
Yeah, hey, listen... when... 
 when can you do the show again?

38
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:42,377
Oh, but I... I just retired all my material.

39
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:45,757
Is Carlos around?

40
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:49,052
Why is it the best 
 landscape in the neighborhood is 
 always in the cemetery?

41
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:53,096
Everybody's dead.

42
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:56,850
That's funny. Can I do that?

43
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:59,645
- Do what? 
 - The bit. Can I do that?

44
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:02,357
Well, that's not a bit. I'm just saying'.

45
00:03:02,398 --> 00:03:04,860
I'm gonna do that. Ok?

46
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,736
You can't do it. It's my bit.

47
00:03:06,778 --> 00:03:08,446
If it's a bit, it's anybody's bit who does it.

48
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,656
No, but I said it first.

49
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:13,242
I'm gonna do it for a while anyway.

50
00:03:13,284 --> 00:03:18,290
Jerry, Alan King would like to 
 meet you on his territory.

51
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,670
He'll guarantee security.

52
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:26,799
Ok.

53
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:55,994
Hey!

54
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:00,374
Hey!

55
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:05,046
Mister, I know this is yours.

56
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:09,090
Don't you want it?

57
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,637
Sorry, kid. I don't do this joke anymore.

58
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:14,223
Oh, come on!

59
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:17,559
Look, I'm sorry. It's over.

60
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,604
But this is a solid bit! Please!

61
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:26,901
Alright. But I'm telling you for the last time.

62
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:42,500
Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry Seinfeld.

63
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:25,837
Thank you. Thank you.

64
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,631
That was very, very nice.

65
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:31,677
Thank you very much. Thank you.

66
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:38,641
Standing ovation. Now I know 
 there's always a...

67
00:05:38,684 --> 00:05:42,062
Scuse me?

68
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:46,066
Perfect start of the show. Thank you

69
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:49,527
I know it's not easy for an audience 
 to give standing ovation.

70
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,574
There's always a few people that 
 don't really wanna do it.

71
00:05:53,783 --> 00:05:57,786
I've seen those people. They're always like...

72
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:02,499
"Are we doing' this now?"

73
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:14,136
So, anyway, I'm thrilled to be back 
 here in New York.

74
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:16,346
I love how certain things 
 about New York never change.

75
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,558
They're always constant, 
 they're always there for you.

76
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,561
The cabbies and the BO.

77
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:24,147
What is with the BO and these guys?

78
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:28,192
How long are these shifts?

79
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:32,573
Can't we get this man a ten minute 
 break for a shower?

80
00:06:33,782 --> 00:06:36,158
You're in the back and it's 
 coming through the glass.

81
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,244
You're just going: "What in the..."

82
00:06:38,286 --> 00:06:41,665
Not only they put that cherry puppet 
 stuff on the dashboard

83
00:06:41,706 --> 00:06:44,835
so you get a cherry BO.

84
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:45,834
I don't know what that's supposed to be...

85
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:49,882
Even the fruit showers more often than this.

86
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:54,135
The funny thing about being in these 
 cabs is that when you're in Manhattan

87
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:58,182
for some reason you don't get scared, 
 no matter how fast the guy goes.

88
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,144
Well, you know, he's driving 
 fast and recklessly...

89
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:05,648
but he's a professional.

90
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,026
He's got a cab driver's license, 
 I can see it right there.

91
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:11,946
I don't even know what it takes to 
 get a cab driver's license.

92
00:07:11,987 --> 00:07:15,992
I think all you need is a face.

93
00:07:16,283 --> 00:07:19,244
This seems to be their big qualification.

94
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:23,291
No blank heads are allowed 
 driving cabs in this town.

95
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:27,378
Also helps to have a name with 
 like 8 consonants in a row.

96
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:31,258
Did you ever see some of 
 the letters in these names?

97
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:35,261
What is the "O" with a line through it, 
 by the way?

98
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:37,638
What planet is that from?

99
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,766
You need a chart of the elements if 
 you wanna report the guy.

100
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:44,771
"Yes, officer, his name was Amal and 
 then the symbol for Boron."

101
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:53,071
"No, it's not Manganese. 
 I had the periodic chart with me at the time."

102
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:59,245
But I love to travel. I love it whether 
 it's a car or whether it's a plane.

103
00:07:59,286 --> 00:08:02,038
I like to get out there, 
 I like to keep it moving.

104
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,542
I love airports. Feel 
 safe in the airports thanks to the high 
 caliber individuals

105
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:09,588
we have working at X-ray security.

106
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:13,801
How 'bout this crack squad of savvy 
 motivated personnel?

107
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,056
The way you wanna setup your airport's 
 security, is you want the short,

108
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:23,102
heavy set women at the front 
 with the skin tight uniform.

109
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:28,566
That's your first line of defense.

110
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:31,653
You want those pants so tight the flap 
 in front of the zipper

111
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:35,698
has pulled itself open, 
 you can see the metal tangs 
 hanging on for dear life.

112
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:45,207
Then you put the bag on the conveyor belt. 
 It goes through the little luggage car wash.

113
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:51,798
Then you have the other genius, 
 down at the other end, 
 looking at the little X-ray TV screen.

114
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:56,010
This Eistein was chosen to stand 
 in front of X-rays 14 hours a day.

115
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:59,848
It's his profession.

116
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:00,850
Looking in that thing...

117
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:04,770
I have looked in that TV screen. 
 I cannot make out one object.

118
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,063
He's standing there... 
 "What is that? A hairdryer 
 with a scope on it?"

119
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:10,942
"That looks ok. Keep it moving."

120
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:14,739
"Some sort of bowling ball candle? 
 Yeah, I got no problem with that, just..."

121
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,784
"You know, we don't wanna hold up the line."

122
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,457
So, I go to the bathroom in the airport.

123
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:28,503
What is the story on the sinks 
 in airport bathrooms

124
00:09:28,794 --> 00:09:32,132
That they will not give us a twist-it-on 
 twist-it-off, human-style faucet?

125
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:36,177
Is that too risky for the general population?

126
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:38,847
Too dangerous? 
 We gotta install the one-handed, 
 spring-loaded,

127
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:42,349
pain-in-the-ass Alcatraz-style faucet.

128
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:46,396
You know, those ones you gotta go: 
 "Hey I got a little water there"

129
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,942
"Hey I got a couple of drops."

130
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:54,070
What is it they think we 
 would do with a faucet?

131
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:56,238
Turn them all on full, 
 run out into the parking lot,

132
00:09:56,281 --> 00:10:00,285
laughing, pushing each other into the bushes?

133
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:04,790
"Come on, the water's on, let's go!"

134
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,544
"I turned it on full blast."

135
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:11,462
"You idiot! We're businessmen, 
 we're gonna miss our plane."

136
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:15,509
"Who cares! Water!"

137
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,140
That's how they think we're gonna act.

138
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:23,435
Do the people that work in these shops 
 in the airport have any idea

139
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:27,479
what the prices are every place 
 else in the world?

140
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:34,444
"Yeah, $14 a tuna sandwich. 
 We think that's fair."

141
00:10:34,487 --> 00:10:38,491
"That's what we charge in our country."

142
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:43,246
Then you get on the plane. 
 The pilot of course always has 
 to come on the PA system.

143
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:47,291
This guy is so excited about being a pilot, 
 he can't even stand himself.

144
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:51,546
"Well, I'm gonna take it up to about 20,000."

145
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:54,340
"Then I'm gonna make a left by Pittsburg."

146
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:55,843
"Then I'm gonna make a right by Chicago."

147
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:58,136
"And then I'm gonna bring it down to 15,000."

148
00:10:58,177 --> 00:11:00,973
He's giving the whole route, all his moves.

149
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:04,976
We're in the back going: "Yeah, fine."

150
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:09,689
"You know, just do whatever the hell 
 you gotta do. I don't know."

151
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:15,612
"Just end-up where it says on the ticket, 
 really."

152
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:27,249
Do I bother him with what I'm doing?

153
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:31,294
Knocking on the cockpit door: 
 "I'm having the peanuts now."

154
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:36,550
"Yeah, that's what we're doing back here."

155
00:11:36,592 --> 00:11:40,054
"I thought I'd keep you posted."

156
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:43,057
"I'm not gonna have them all now, 
 I'm just gonna have a few."

157
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:47,102
"I don't wanna finish it because 
 it's such a big bag."

158
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,234
Then the stewardesses have to come out.

159
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:55,153
They have to do their little 
 emergency equipment show.

160
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:59,199
You know, that thing they do. 
 One of them reads it, 
 the other one acts it out.

161
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:03,244
"Hey, we have seatbelts and oxygen masks."

162
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:07,291
"Things for you to use."

163
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:11,503
They show you how to use the seatbelt, 
 in case you haven't been in a car since 1965.

164
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:17,885
"Oh, you lift up on the buckle! Oh!"

165
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:23,306
"I was trying to break the metal apart."

166
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:26,769
"I thought that's how it works."

167
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,563
"I was gonna try and tear the fabric 
 part of the belt."

168
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:34,610
"I thought if I could just get it started..."

169
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:41,076
Then they're always 
 pointing out the emergency exits,

170
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:45,079
always with that very vague point though, 
 isn't it?

171
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:50,793
"Where the hell would these places be?", 
 would you say.

172
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:58,968
The plane's at a 90 degrees angle, 
 your hair is on fire,

173
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:02,763
you're looking for this.

174
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:05,850
How you think you're gonna do there?

175
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:09,896
She's thinking: 
 "I'm getting out before you're getting out."

176
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:15,902
"You're dead, you're dead, I'm gone."

177
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:24,995
Then they always have to close that 
 first class curtain, too.

178
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:29,083
They always give you that little look.

179
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:35,589
"Maybe if you would have 
 worked a little harder..."

180
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:41,094
I wouldn't have to do this.

181
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,145
It's all a tiny world on the airplane, 
 isn't it?

182
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:52,564
There's always that little tiny 
 table there, tiny computer,

183
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:55,359
little cramped seats, tiny food, tiny utensils,

184
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,738
tiny liquor bottles, tiny bathroom, 
 tiny sink, tiny mirror, tiny faucet.

185
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,656
So, there's a small problem, 
 there's gonna be a slight delay,

186
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:04,702
we're gonna be a little late.

187
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,663
I always go in the airplane's bathroom, 
 even if I don't have to go,

188
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:08,247
I gotta go in there.

189
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:11,542
It's nice. It's like your own 
 little apartment on the plane, isn't it?

190
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,045
You go in there, lock the door, 
 the light comes on after second.

191
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:18,091
It's like a little surprise party.

192
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:21,677
But I'm always impressed of 
 the amount of equipment 
 that they have in that place.

193
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,555
I mean it's little, but they got 
 tissues, towels, closets, compartments,

194
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:28,602
tiny slot for used razor blades. 
 They always have that.

195
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:34,565
Who is shaving on the plane?

196
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:38,611
And shaving so much they're 
 using up razor blades?

197
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:42,574
Is this what's happening?

198
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:45,243
What? Is the wolf man flying in there, 
 for Christ's sakes?

199
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:49,290
Who could shave that much?

200
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:04,471
So, I'm supposed to go to Florida 
 next week after we're done here.

201
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:07,767
That's where my older relatives live. 
 I don't really wanna go.

202
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:08,977
Florida...

203
00:15:09,018 --> 00:15:11,062
A lot of old people down there.

204
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:13,148
You know, they live in those 
 minimum security prisons.

205
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:15,274
That's where they put all the old people.

206
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:18,778
What's with all the security there? 
 With the guard gate, 
 with that arm coming down,

207
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,864
the guy's got a uniform, guns...

208
00:15:20,905 --> 00:15:24,868
Are the old people trying to escape? 
 Or, are people stealing old people?

209
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:28,913
What is the security problem?

210
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:32,042
I just can't drive around there. 
 You know how these old people drive...

211
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:36,087
They drive slow, they sit low. 
 That is their motto.

212
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:41,385
The state flag of Florida should be 
 just a steering wheel 
 with a hat and two knuckles on it.

213
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:52,187
And they left that turn signal on 
 since they left the house that morning.

214
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:58,819
That's a legal turn in Florida. 
 It's known as an eventual left.

215
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:03,908
You can signal this week, 
 turn any following year of your life.

216
00:16:05,617 --> 00:16:07,745
What is that age that old people 
 reach when they decide

217
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:11,791
when they back out of their driveway, 
 they're not looking anymore.

218
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:14,377
You know how they do that? 
 They just go:

219
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:18,423
"Well, I'm old and I'm coming back."

220
00:16:22,302 --> 00:16:26,306
"I survived. Let's see if you can."

221
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:32,145
One thing I like about being with my 
 older relatives is it makes me feel 
 like a kid again.

222
00:16:32,187 --> 00:16:36,192
You know, they're feeding you. 
 You're trying to steal candy.

223
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:38,944
Candy was my whole life when I was a kid. 
 That was...

224
00:16:38,985 --> 00:16:42,656
First ten years of my life, 
 I think the only clear thought I had

225
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:45,366
was: "GET CANDY!"

226
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:49,412
That was it. Family, friends, school, 
 they were just obstacles in 
 they way of the candy.

227
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:53,792
I'm out for the candy here. 
 I'm just thinking: "Get candy! Get candy!"

228
00:16:54,584 --> 00:16:57,754
That's why you have to teach kids 
 not to take candy from a stranger

229
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:01,258
if they're playing in the playground, 
 because they're such candy 
 idiot moron brains...

230
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,759
They're just: "This man has candy, 
 I'm going with him."

231
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:06,263
"Goodbye. Whatever happens to me. 
 Get candy, get candy..."

232
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:08,350
"Don't go! They'll torture you, 
 they'll kidnap you."

233
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:09,975
"It doesn't matter, he has an 'Old Henry'. 
 I have to take that chance."

234
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:14,021
"Get candy, get candy..."

235
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,193
So the first time you hear the concept 
 of Halloween when you're a kid

236
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:24,074
your brain can't even process the information.

237
00:17:24,115 --> 00:17:28,119
You're like: "What is this? What did you say?"

238
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:31,456
"What did you say about giving out candy? 
 Who's giving out candy?"

239
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:35,501
"Everyone that we know 
 is just giving out candy?"

240
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:40,048
"Are you kidding me? When is this happening? 
 Where? Why? Take me with you!"

241
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,259
"I gotta be a part of this. 
 I'll do anything that they want."

242
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:47,305
"I can wear that."

243
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:57,983
"I'll wear anything I have to wear."

244
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:01,987
"I'll do anything I'll have to do 
 to get the candy from those fools"

245
00:18:03,697 --> 00:18:06,575
"that are so stupid they're giving it away."

246
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:09,953
So, the first couple of years I made 
 my own costumes which of course sucked:

247
00:18:09,994 --> 00:18:13,957
the ghost, the hobo...

248
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,961
Then, finally, the third year, 
 begging the parents

249
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:21,006
I've got the Superman Halloween costume, 
 not surprisingly.

250
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,262
Cardboard box, self-made top, mask included.

251
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:27,054
Remember the rubber band on 
 the back of that mask?

252
00:18:27,096 --> 00:18:29,849
That was a quality item there, wasn't it?

253
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:34,896
That was good about 10 seconds before it 
 snapped out of that cheap little staple 
 they put it in there with.

254
00:18:36,105 --> 00:18:40,109
You go to your first house: "Trick or..." Snap! 
 "It broke. I don't believe it!"

255
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:44,281
"Wait up, you guys! I gotta fix it!"

256
00:18:44,322 --> 00:18:48,326
"Hey, wait up! Wait up!"

257
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:51,371
That's what kids say. 
 They don't say: "Wait!"

258
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:54,959
They say: "Wait up! Hey, wait up!"

259
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,878
'Cause when you're little, 
 your life is up, the future is up,

260
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,380
everything you want is up.

261
00:18:59,421 --> 00:19:02,048
"Wait up, hold up, shut up."

262
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:06,095
"Mamma, clean up", "Let me stay up."

263
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:08,264
For parents, of course, 
 everything is just the opposite.

264
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:13,309
Everything is down. 
 "Just calm down", "Slow down", 
 "Come down here"

265
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:17,691
"Sit down", "Put that down"

266
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:29,160
So I had my little costume, 
 I was physically ready,

267
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:33,206
I was preparing myself, 
 I did not try on the costume 
 prior to Halloween.

268
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:36,250
Do you remember... 
 This is an obscure one but...

269
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:39,754
On the side of the box, 
 I remember from my Superman costume, 
 it actually said:

270
00:19:39,796 --> 00:19:43,257
"Do not attempt to fly!"

271
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,552
They printed that as a warning

272
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:49,597
'cause kids would put it on and... 
 going off the roofs.

273
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,769
I love the idea of the kid who's 
 stupid enough to think he actually is Superman

274
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,813
but smart enough to check that box 
 before he goes off the roof.

275
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:03,362
"Let me see if it says 
 anything about me being Superman..."

276
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:07,365
"Oh, wait a second here, I..."

277
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:10,785
So, anyway, but if my hopes 
 were up I was thinking that this is probably

278
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:14,791
the same exact costume 
 that Superman wears himself.

279
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:18,377
When you put these things on, 
 it's not exactly the super-fit

280
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,172
that you are hoping for.

281
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:23,759
It looks more like Superman's pyjamas, 
 that's what it looks like.

282
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,052
It's all kinda loose and flowing.

283
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:30,097
The neck line kinda comes down about there...

284
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:33,476
flimsy little ribbon string in the back.

285
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:37,523
Plus my mother makes me wear 
 my winter coat over the costume anyway.

286
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:46,489
I don't recall Superman wearing a jacket.

287
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:50,285
Not like I had: cheap __quarteroid__, 
 phony fur.

288
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:52,454
"Boy, I'm Superman but it's a little chilly out

289
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:56,499
and I'm glad I have this cheap 
 little 10 year old kids jacket."

290
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:02,673
So I'm going out trick-or-treating 
 but the mask's rubber band keeps breaking

291
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:06,718
and keeps getting shorter. 
 I'm fixing it, it's getting 
 tighter and tighter on my face.

292
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:10,973
You know, when it starts slicing 
 into your eyeballs there and you...

293
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:15,018
you're trying to breathe 
 through that little hole...

294
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,062
getting all sweaty.

295
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:21,108
"I can't see, I can't breathe but 
 we gotta keep going, we gotta get the candy."

296
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:27,906
And a half an hour into it 
 you just take the mask: "Oh, 
 the hell with it."

297
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,204
Bing-bong! "Yeah, it's me, 
 give me the candy."

298
00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:37,709
"Yeah, I'm Superman, look 
 at the pants legs, what do you care?"

299
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:45,383
Looking at those last 
 years of trick-or-treating 
 you're getting a little too old for it.

300
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:48,053
Still out there, going through the motions.

301
00:21:48,094 --> 00:21:51,682
Bing-bong! "Come on lady, let's go."

302
00:21:51,723 --> 00:21:55,726
"Halloween, doorbells, candy, 
 let's pick it up and..."

303
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,689
They come at the door... 
 they always ask you the same stupid questions:

304
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,066
"What are you supposed to be?"

305
00:22:01,107 --> 00:22:02,651
"I'm supposed to be done by now."

306
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:06,363
"You wanna move it along 
 the three musketeers."

307
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:09,783
"I got 18 houses on this block, sweetheart."

308
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:13,829
"Just hit the bag, we hit the road. 
 That's the way it works."

309
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:16,456
Sometimes they have that 
 little white bag twisted on the top...

310
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:20,378
You know that's gonna be some crap candy.

311
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,257
Doesn't have the official 
 Halloween markings on it.

312
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:27,760
"Hold it, lady. Wait a second. What is this? 
 The orange marshmallow shaped like a peanut?"

313
00:22:27,802 --> 00:22:31,806
"Do me a favor, you keep that one."

314
00:22:32,223 --> 00:22:35,684
"We have all the doorstops we need already. 
 Thank you."

315
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:39,731
"We're going for name candy only this year."

316
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:45,779
Food is so complicated as an adult...

317
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,989
You see people in the supermarket. 
 They're just sweating out.

318
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:52,995
Nobody knows... "what do I eat... 
 the proteins, the carbs, the fat content..."

319
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,872
"Oh, my God, the fat content!"

320
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:59,917
We're just walking up to each other: 
 "You look good. What do you eat? 
 Maybe I'll eat that."

321
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,425
The whole supermarket itself is 
 designed to break down 
 your sense of having any life 
 outside the supermarket.

322
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:11,805
It's like a casino. There's no clocks, 
 no windows, no easily accessible exits...

323
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,975
Did you ever not buy anything in a 
 supermarket and try to get out of there?

324
00:23:15,016 --> 00:23:16,267
It's impossible.

325
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,563
There's no way out.

326
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,856
You can see what happens to people.

327
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:23,359
When they walk up to the supermarket, 
 they really have a whole sense of purpose.

328
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,569
"I'm gonna get this, I'm gonna get that, 
 I'm gonna pay for it,

329
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,988
I'm gonna get out of here and 
 get back to my normal life."

330
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,992
You see that same person 
 10 minutes later just...

331
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:44,881
"What aisle is this?"

332
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:47,466
"Why did I come up here?"

333
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:49,968
Always noticing something new.

334
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:54,014
"Oh, they got them in muskeet flavor now..."

335
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,560
"What is 'muskeet'?"

336
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,606
"I wonder if it's made from mosquitoes."

337
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,277
Produce section I always find challenging.

338
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,155
There's always some special thing 
 you're supposed to know.

339
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,657
You know, about each fruit...

340
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,159
"Summer time make sure your peaches are..."

341
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,078
I don't know, whatever it is.

342
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,875
You gotta fake it... you know, 
 I'm shaking stuff holding it up to the light.

343
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,920
"Yeah, that's a good one. 
 I'm sure glad I found that one."

344
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,259
Cantalopes rolling down the aisle.

345
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,680
"See the way that's fading left, 
 that one's not ready."

346
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,184
"I don't want that one."

347
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:40,229
I'm very impressed with this 
 seedless watermelon 
 product that they have for us.

348
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:44,275
They've done it. 
 We now have seedless watermelon.

349
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,193
Pretty amazing.

350
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:49,196
What are they planting 
 to grow the seedless watermelon, I wonder?

351
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:53,576
The melons aren't humping', are they? 
 They must be planting something.

352
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,871
How does this work?

353
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,664
And what kind of scientists 
 do this type of work?

354
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:02,168
I read this thing was 15 years in development.

355
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,214
In the laboratories with gene splicing or, 
 you know, whatever they do there...

356
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,384
I mean, other scientists are working on 
 AIDS, cancer, heart disease.

357
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:13,429
These guys are going: 
 "No, I'm going to devote myself to melon."

358
00:25:13,722 --> 00:25:16,182
"I think that's much more important."

359
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:20,228
"Sure thousands are dying needlessly 
 but this... that's gotta stop."

360
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:31,031
"Have you ever tried to pick a wet one 
 off the floor, it's almost impossible."

361
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:35,327
"I really think we should devote 
 the money to these studies."

362
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,663
Milk is a big problem 
 for people in the supermarket.

363
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,290
They're never quite sure 
 if they have it, if they need it.

364
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,459
They bury it way in the back 
 in the supermarket.

365
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:44,879
You gotta find it, 
 you gotta hack 
 your way through all the displays.

366
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,883
"Yeah, there it is. 
 There's the milk."

367
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:50,677
"Do we have any milk?"

368
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:53,387
People are never really 
 sure if they have milk.

369
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,265
You think you have milk, 
 you might have.

370
00:25:56,307 --> 00:25:59,894
"I know there's a carton in there, 
 I don't know how much is in it."

371
00:25:59,936 --> 00:26:02,480
"Well, what shall we do?"

372
00:26:02,522 --> 00:26:04,064
'Cause you wanna be sure.

373
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:07,068
There's nothing worse than 
 thinking you have milk and not having it.

374
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,362
You know, you got the bowl setup, 
 the cereal, the spoon,

375
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:12,073
the napkin, the TV, the newspaper, 
 everything's ready to go.

376
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:16,119
You lift up the carton and it's too light.

377
00:26:18,998 --> 00:26:22,083
"Oh, no!"

378
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:24,795
"Too light!"

379
00:26:24,836 --> 00:26:28,172
Sometimes you think you need milk: 
 "Hey we'd better pick up some milk."

380
00:26:28,215 --> 00:26:31,177
Like many of you 
 are thinking right now.

381
00:26:31,218 --> 00:26:34,680
"You know, he's right. 
 Maybe we should pick up some milk."

382
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:37,183
So you pick up some milk on your way home.

383
00:26:37,224 --> 00:26:39,767
And then you discover 
 you already have milk.

384
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:41,895
And now you got 
 way too much milk.

385
00:26:41,936 --> 00:26:45,899
That's no good either. 
 Now it's a race against the clock 
 with the expiration date.

386
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:48,193
That freaky thing.

387
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:52,198
Now your eating punchbowls 
 of cereal, three meals a day.

388
00:26:52,323 --> 00:26:54,992
You're washing your face with milk.

389
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:57,161
Bringing cats in from 
 all over the neighborhood.

390
00:26:57,203 --> 00:27:01,207
"Hurry up and drink it! 
 Come on, it's almost time!"

391
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:07,005
"Get back over here..."

392
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:11,967
How do they know that 
 that is the definite exact day?

393
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:16,014
You know, they don't say like 
 it's in the vicinity, give or take, roughly...

394
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:20,726
They brand it right 
 into the side of the carton.

395
00:27:22,729 --> 00:27:26,692
"That's your goddamn day right there."

396
00:27:26,733 --> 00:27:29,194
"Oh, don't screw with us."

397
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:32,573
"We know what day is the final day."

398
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:36,618
"And then it is so over."

399
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:39,370
Have you ever had milk 
 the day after the date?

400
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:43,416
Scares the hell out of you, doesn't it?

401
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:47,796
The spoon is trembling 
 as it comes out of the bowl.

402
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,801
"It's after the day! 
 I'm taking a big chance!"

403
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:56,430
"I smelled it, you smelled it, 
 what is it supposed to smell like?"

404
00:27:57,723 --> 00:28:01,727
"It smelled like milk to me."

405
00:28:03,437 --> 00:28:05,981
I don't know how they're so definite, though.

406
00:28:06,023 --> 00:28:09,694
Maybe the cows tip them off 
 when they're milking them.

407
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:13,739
"July 3rd"

408
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:32,968
To me the only thing tougher 
 than the supermarket is the drugstore.

409
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:37,014
The drugstore's really challenging 
 because you have no idea what 
 they're talking about.

410
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:38,682
You're just looking at the ingredients...

411
00:28:38,723 --> 00:28:40,183
I had a cold a couple of weeks ago.

412
00:28:40,224 --> 00:28:42,686
So I go in there and I'm looking...

413
00:28:42,727 --> 00:28:45,273
The entire wall is cold medication.

414
00:28:45,314 --> 00:28:48,400
And you can't understand anything so 
 you're just reading ingredients.

415
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:50,778
Did you ever catch yourself reading 
 ingredients in the drugstore?

416
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:54,824
"Oh, this has .03 tetrahydroziline! 
 It's a good amount of that."

417
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:01,163
But it's so hard to figure out. 
 Sometimes they have:

418
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:05,209
this one's quick acting, 
 this one's long lasting.

419
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:08,087
"Hmm, when do I need to feel good?"

420
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:10,298
"Now or later?"

421
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:12,174
"I don't know."

422
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:15,594
They always tell you how the medicine 
 works on TV in the commercials.

423
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:17,596
That's my favorite part, 
 with the guy that says:

424
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:21,642
"Here's the human body" and there's 
 always this guy...

425
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:28,232
No face, mouth open, this is how drug 
 companies see the public.

426
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,571
He's always got the tube coming down here

427
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:35,365
and then the circle area.

428
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:39,286
These are the complex inner workings 
 of the human body, I assume.

429
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:40,578
I'm sure, when you go to the medical school,

430
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:42,788
they put that up on the board the first day

431
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:46,835
"Ok, everyone, now remember, 
 you got your tube coming down from the mouth"

432
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:52,006
"and that goes into your circle area."

433
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:55,386
"That's pretty much all we know."

434
00:29:55,428 --> 00:29:57,180
"That's it for today."

435
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:58,180
"Don't miss tomorrow,"

436
00:29:58,221 --> 00:30:02,226
"we're gonna practice making people 
 waiting in the little room in their underwear"

437
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:05,688
"and then you'll all be doctors."

438
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:09,400
"That's all there is to it."

439
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:11,901
Then they have to show you the pain... 
 the part where they say:

440
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:13,863
"Here's where you hurt."

441
00:30:13,904 --> 00:30:17,908
Pain is usually represented by some 
 sort of lightning attacking the guy,

442
00:30:19,409 --> 00:30:21,663
glowing redness is popular,

443
00:30:21,705 --> 00:30:25,709
sometimes parts of the guys body will 
 just burst into flames...

444
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:30,630
Sometimes the whole guy is out of focus.

445
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,466
I never had a doctor saying to me:

446
00:30:33,508 --> 00:30:34,801
"-Are you having any pain?" 
 "-Yes, I am."

447
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:38,471
"Are you having any lightning with the pain?"

448
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:42,518
"Have you been in a fun-house 
 mirror at any time?"

449
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:45,270
Then they tell you about the pain 
 relieving ingredient.

450
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,272
There's always gotta be a lotta that.

451
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:51,068
Nobody wants anything less 
 than 'extra-strength'.

452
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,194
'Extra-strength' is the absolute minimum.

453
00:30:53,236 --> 00:30:55,697
You can even get 'strength'. 
 'Strength' is out now.

454
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:57,783
It's all 'extra-strength'.

455
00:30:57,824 --> 00:31:00,870
Some people are not satisfied with 'extra', 
 they want 'maximum'.

456
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:03,581
"Give me the 'maximum-strength'."

457
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:07,625
"Give me the maximum allowable human dosis."

458
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:12,340
"Figure out what will kill me and then 
 back it off a little bit."

459
00:31:19,722 --> 00:31:23,726
Why does that pharmacist have to be 
 two and a half feet higher 
 than everybody else?

460
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:26,395
Who the hell is this guy?

461
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:30,191
"Clear out, everybody. 
 I'm working with pills up here."

462
00:31:30,232 --> 00:31:34,236
"I'm taking them from this big bottle 
 and then I'm gonna put them 
 in the little bottle."

463
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,200
"That's my whole job."

464
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:42,246
"I can't be down on the floor with you people."

465
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:46,666
"Yes, I'd like to get this 
 prescription pills, please."

466
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:50,003
"All right, but you wait down there."

467
00:31:50,044 --> 00:31:54,007
"No one come up here but me."

468
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,804
There's a little bit of arrogance 
 in the medical community,

469
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:00,681
I think we can all live with that.

470
00:32:00,722 --> 00:32:04,601
Like, when you go to see the doctor, 
 you don't see the actual doctor first.

471
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,395
You must wait in the waiting room.

472
00:32:06,436 --> 00:32:07,896
There's no chance of not waiting.

473
00:32:07,938 --> 00:32:10,482
That's the name of the room.

474
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:12,068
The doctors are all back there...

475
00:32:12,109 --> 00:32:15,404
"We can't take them now, 
 we've already got this room."

476
00:32:15,446 --> 00:32:17,363
You sit there, you pretend you're 
 reading the little magazine,

477
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:21,411
you're actually looking at the other people.

478
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:26,041
"I wonder what he's got."

479
00:32:26,331 --> 00:32:30,336
"That guy is a goner."

480
00:32:31,336 --> 00:32:34,089
Then they call you... You get very 
 excited when they call you

481
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:36,301
'cause you think now you're 
 gonna see the doctor.

482
00:32:36,342 --> 00:32:37,593
But you're not.

483
00:32:37,636 --> 00:32:40,597
Now you're going into the next, 
 smaller, waiting room.

484
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:42,682
Now you don't even have your magazine.

485
00:32:42,723 --> 00:32:44,267
Now you got your pants around your ankles,

486
00:32:44,308 --> 00:32:48,313
you're sitting on that butcher paper 
 they pulled out over the table...

487
00:32:49,815 --> 00:32:53,819
Sometimes I bring a pickle with me and I put it 
 next to me right there on the table...

488
00:32:56,947 --> 00:33:00,909
...in case the doctor wants to fold 
 the whole thing up for a to-go order.

489
00:33:05,414 --> 00:33:09,000
"Get your pants off and get in there 
 and I will tell you what I think."

490
00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:10,377
Doctors always want your pants off.

491
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:14,423
"Take your pants off. 
 The doctor would like to 
 see you with no pants."

492
00:33:16,508 --> 00:33:17,468
"Just get them off."

493
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:21,513
"- It's my head." 
 "- I said, take your pants off."

494
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:26,811
But I hate the extra wait, 
 so I start screwing around 
 with some of his stuff.

495
00:33:27,228 --> 00:33:29,772
"Maybe I'll turn that thing up a little bit."

496
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:31,982
"Whatever the hell that does."

497
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:36,028
Take all the tongue depressors out, 
 lick'em all, put'em all back in.

498
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:42,868
I, too, can play at this waiting game.

499
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:44,287
Just once I would like to say to the doctor:

500
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:47,582
"You know what? I'm not ready for you yet."

501
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:51,378
"Why don't you go back in your little 
 office and I'll be in in a minute."

502
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,380
"And get YOUR pants off."

503
00:33:54,422 --> 00:33:56,882
"Then we'll see what's what."

504
00:33:56,925 --> 00:34:00,679
Why is it doctors need that 
 little office for, anyway?

505
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,306
Little books, little stupid aquarium.

506
00:34:03,348 --> 00:34:05,601
I guess he doesn't want people to 
 see him looking stuff up:

507
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:09,395
"What the hell was that?"

508
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:12,274
"Jesus Christ!"

509
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:14,985
"That was kinda gross."

510
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:19,031
"That wasn't the tube or the circle."

511
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:27,915
A friend of mine is going in for a 
 nose job next week. Guy.

512
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:33,004
You know what the technical 
 term for a nose job is?

513
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:36,299
Of course you do... It's New York. Everybody...

514
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,677
Rhinoplasty!

515
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:41,887
Rhino!

516
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:45,683
This guy is aware he has a bit of a problem...

517
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:49,604
he's obviously sensitive about it, 
 that's why he made the appointment.

518
00:34:49,645 --> 00:34:53,483
Do we need to compare him to a rhinoceros?

519
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,693
When you go for a hair 
 transplant you don't say:

520
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:59,489
"We're going to perform a 
 cue-ball-ectomy on you, mister Johnson."

521
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:03,535
"We feel the chrome-dome-ia has advanced..."

522
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:08,039
"to a level we term skin-head-ia."

523
00:35:08,748 --> 00:35:12,711
"These are all medical terms, 
 if you don't understand."

524
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,797
Of course, everybody wants to look their best,

525
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,844
they're all out there, 
 everybody wants to look good, 
 guys, gals, sexuality.

526
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:25,348
I'm a single guy, by the way, 
 there are no other guys attached to me.

527
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,477
Thank you very much.

528
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:30,604
Thank you.

529
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,773
I love you, too.

530
00:35:32,815 --> 00:35:36,819
But I do feel the need to see other people.

531
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:49,749
I was kinda engaged about 10 or so years ago.

532
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:54,003
Didn't wanna get married, 
 that was the closest I got.

533
00:35:54,044 --> 00:35:57,005
I can tell you this: if you're 
 engaged and you don't wanna get married

534
00:35:57,049 --> 00:36:00,010
it's a little tense.

535
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:01,969
It's like you're on that first 
 hill of the roller-coaster

536
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:03,972
but you don't really wanna go on the ride...

537
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:08,017
going click-click, click-click...

538
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,399
I was best man at a wedding one time 
 and that was pretty good.

539
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,692
Pretty good title, I thought... 'Best man'

540
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:16,694
I thought it was a bit much.

541
00:36:16,735 --> 00:36:19,987
I thought we had the groom and 
 the 'pretty good man'.

542
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,990
That's more than enough.

543
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:26,036
If I am the best man, why is she marrying him?

544
00:36:28,038 --> 00:36:32,042
I had to wear the tuxedo which, 
 I am convinced, was invented by a woman.

545
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:36,129
"Well, they're all the same, 
 we might as well dress them all the same."

546
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:46,849
The tuxedo also functions as a wedding 
 safety device for the bride...

547
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:50,686
...in case the groom chickens out, 
 everybody could just take one step over

548
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:53,480
and the ceremony continues.

549
00:36:53,523 --> 00:36:57,194
That's why they don't say: "Do you take 
 David Williams to be your 
 faithfully wedded husband?"

550
00:36:57,235 --> 00:37:01,239
They say: "Do you take THIS MAN?"

551
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,453
But, men and women will never understand 
 each other, we all know that.

552
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:10,581
It's just not gonna happen, just forget it.

553
00:37:10,624 --> 00:37:12,292
I know I will not understand women.

554
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:16,297
I know I will never be able to 
 understand how a woman can take 
 boiling hot wax

555
00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:20,341
pour it on her upper 
 thigh and rip the hair out by the root

556
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:25,722
and still be afraid of a spider.

557
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:36,442
I'm not spending anymore time working on that.

558
00:37:36,942 --> 00:37:38,777
And I know women don't understand men.

559
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,196
I know there are women looking at me right now

560
00:37:41,238 --> 00:37:44,200
wondering: "what goes on in that 
 little brain of his?"

561
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:48,245
"I bethca I could manipulate that brain."

562
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:52,750
I betcha you could.

563
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:56,504
I betcha women would like to know 
 what men really think...

564
00:37:56,545 --> 00:37:58,506
the truth, the honest truth.

565
00:37:58,547 --> 00:37:59,799
You wanna know what men are really thinking?

566
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,383
'Cause I could tell you.

567
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:02,302
Would you like to know?

568
00:38:02,343 --> 00:38:04,012
Alright, I'll tell you.

569
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:08,016
Nothing.

570
00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:15,900
We're not thinking anything.

571
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:19,944
We're just walking around, looking around.

572
00:38:20,237 --> 00:38:23,990
This is the only natural inclination of men.

573
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:28,036
To just kinda check stuff out.

574
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:31,081
We work because they force us to, 
 but other than that,

575
00:38:31,122 --> 00:38:34,585
this is really the only thing we wanna do.

576
00:38:34,626 --> 00:38:37,088
We like women, we want women.

577
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:39,881
But that's pretty much as far as we've thought.

578
00:38:39,924 --> 00:38:42,676
That's why we're honking car horns, 
 yelling from construction sites...

579
00:38:42,717 --> 00:38:46,722
These are the best ideas we've had so far.

580
00:38:48,224 --> 00:38:52,228
Honking the car horn amazes me! 
 This is gotta be

581
00:38:52,728 --> 00:38:55,898
just the last living 
 brain cell in this guys skull

582
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,610
that comes up with this idea.

583
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:01,404
She's on the street, he's in the car.

584
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:05,450
Beep-beep.

585
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:11,830
"I think I made my point."

586
00:39:12,123 --> 00:39:16,127
What is she supposed to do? Kick off the heel, 
 start running after the car?

587
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:19,089
Grab on to the bumper?

588
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,299
The car comes to a stop...

589
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:23,093
"It's a good thing you honked."

590
00:39:23,135 --> 00:39:27,139
"I had no idea how you felt."

591
00:39:28,723 --> 00:39:31,101
Why do men behave in these ways?

592
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:35,146
Why are we rude, obnoxious, 
 getting drunk, falling down, 
 peeling rubber, making kissing 
 noises out the window?

593
00:39:37,149 --> 00:39:38,400
Why are we like this?

594
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:39,693
I know what you ladies are thinking...

595
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:43,739
"No, no, not my guy. 
 I'm working with him, he's coming along."

596
00:39:45,157 --> 00:39:47,577
No, he's not.

597
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,496
He's not coming anywhere.

598
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:54,542
We, men, know: no matter how poorly we behave, 
 it seems we will somehow end up 
 with women anyway.

599
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:59,797
Look around this room. 
 Look at all the men you see with lovely women.

600
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:02,300
Do you think these are special men?

601
00:40:02,341 --> 00:40:05,678
Gifted men? One of a kind men?

602
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,182
They're the same jerks as any 
 of the ones that I'm talking about.

603
00:40:09,223 --> 00:40:11,685
They're doing just fine.

604
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:15,730
Men, as an organization, are getting more women 
 than any other group working 
 anywhere in the world today.

605
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:20,651
Wherever women are, we have men 
 looking into the situation right now.

606
00:40:21,527 --> 00:40:23,196
We explored the Earth looking for women.

607
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:25,907
We even went to the Moon just to see 
 if there were any women there.

608
00:40:25,948 --> 00:40:27,284
That's why we brought that little car.

609
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:31,329
Why would you bring a car, 
 unless there's some chance of going on a date?

610
00:40:36,836 --> 00:40:40,839
What the hell were they doing 
 with a car on the goddamn Moon?

611
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:45,386
You're on the Moon already!

612
00:40:45,427 --> 00:40:49,431
Isn't that far enough?

613
00:40:49,724 --> 00:40:52,601
There is no more male idea in 
 the history of the universe than:

614
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:56,647
"why don't we fly up to 
 the Moon and drive around?"

615
00:40:57,356 --> 00:41:01,360
That is the essence of male 
 thinking right there.

616
00:41:02,445 --> 00:41:06,448
All men kinda think of themselves like 
 low-level super-heroes in their own world.

617
00:41:08,034 --> 00:41:12,038
I'm not even supposed to be telling you this.

618
00:41:13,956 --> 00:41:17,084
But when men are growing up and are reading 
 about Batman, Spiderman, Superman...

619
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:18,878
these aren't fantasies.

620
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,882
These are options.

621
00:41:22,924 --> 00:41:25,718
This is the deep inner secret 
 truth of the male mind.

622
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:27,386
I'll give you a perfect example 
 of what I'm talking about.

623
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:31,433
Did you ever see a guy, out on the highway, 
 moving a mattress tied to the roof of the car?

624
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:36,354
Without fail, he's got the arm 
 out of the window holding the mattress.

625
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:41,485
This is classic male idiot super-hero thinking.

626
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:45,531
This moron believes that if the wind 
 catches this huge rectangle at 70 mph...

627
00:41:46,823 --> 00:41:50,828
"I got it! I got it!"

628
00:41:54,456 --> 00:41:56,082
"Don't worry about it."

629
00:41:56,125 --> 00:42:00,128
"I'm using my arm!"

630
00:42:03,549 --> 00:42:06,385
But I'm sure there're many dates 
 going on in this room right now...

631
00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:10,431
Dating is not easy. What is a date really 
 but a job interview that lasts all night?

632
00:42:12,641 --> 00:42:14,517
The only difference 
 between a date and a job interview is

633
00:42:14,561 --> 00:42:18,481
in not many job interviews is there a chance 
 you'll end up naked at the end of it.

634
00:42:18,523 --> 00:42:20,399
"Well, Bill, the boss thinks 
 you're the man for the position,"

635
00:42:20,442 --> 00:42:24,446
"why don't you strip down and meet 
 some of the people you'll be working with."

636
00:42:27,657 --> 00:42:31,119
Sex doesn't make anything any easier.

637
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:34,288
It only makes it more complicated.

638
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:38,335
Women have two types of 
 orgasms: the actual ones 
 and the ones that they make up on their own.

639
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:41,213
And I can give you the male 
 point of view on this.

640
00:42:41,254 --> 00:42:45,259
Which is: we're fine with it.

641
00:42:47,427 --> 00:42:51,431
"You do whatever the hell it is you gotta do."

642
00:42:54,143 --> 00:42:57,188
To a man, sex is like a car accident anyway.

643
00:42:57,229 --> 00:42:59,898
And determining a female 
 orgasm is like being asked:

644
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,985
"What did you see after the car 
 went out of control?"

645
00:43:03,026 --> 00:43:05,488
"Well, I remember I heard a lot 
 of screeching noises..."

646
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:08,908
"I was facing the wrong way at one point..."

647
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:12,953
"and in the end, my body was thrown clear."

648
00:43:20,336 --> 00:43:24,340
I'll tell you what I like 
 about Chinese people...

649
00:43:29,345 --> 00:43:32,807
They're hanging in there with the chop 
 sticks, aren't they?

650
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:35,685
You know they've seen the fork.

651
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:37,895
They're staying with the sticks.

652
00:43:37,938 --> 00:43:41,608
I'm impressed by that.

653
00:43:41,649 --> 00:43:43,317
I don't know how they missed it.

654
00:43:43,361 --> 00:43:46,613
A Chinese farmer, gets up, 
 works in the field with the shovel all day...

655
00:43:46,654 --> 00:43:49,699
Shovel... Spoon... Come on...

656
00:43:49,741 --> 00:43:51,493
There it is.

657
00:43:51,534 --> 00:43:55,539
You're not ploughing 40 acres 
 with a couple of pool cues...

658
00:44:00,627 --> 00:44:04,632
And why is McDonald's still counting?

659
00:44:04,757 --> 00:44:07,510
This is really insecure, isn't it?

660
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,221
40 gillion, 80 million, zillion, 
 billion, killion, tillion...

661
00:44:11,263 --> 00:44:13,307
What is this?

662
00:44:13,348 --> 00:44:14,892
Does it mean anything to anyone?

663
00:44:14,933 --> 00:44:16,101
89 billion sold.

664
00:44:16,144 --> 00:44:20,147
"Ok. I'll have one."

665
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,318
I would love to meet the chairman of 
 the board of McDonald's...

666
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:28,991
Just to say to him: 
 "Look, we all get it."

667
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:30,991
"You have sold a lotta hamburgers."

668
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:32,785
"Whatever the hell the number is."

669
00:44:32,826 --> 00:44:36,831
"Just put up a sign: 'McDonald's, 
 we're doing very well!'"

670
00:44:37,666 --> 00:44:41,085
"I don't need to hear about every 
 goddamn one of them."

671
00:44:41,126 --> 00:44:45,131
What is their ultimate goal? 
 To have cows just surrendering voluntarily?

672
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:48,509
Showing up at the door: 
 "We'd like to turn ourselves in."

673
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:52,556
"We see the sign... we realize we have 
 very little chance out there."

674
00:45:04,026 --> 00:45:08,030
"We'd like to be a 'Happy Meal' 
 if that's at all possible."

675
00:45:10,866 --> 00:45:13,285
I was in London about a month ago, 
 the World Cup was going on.

676
00:45:13,326 --> 00:45:16,289
I enjoy any sporting event 
 where nations get involved.

677
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:17,497
I find that the most exciting.

678
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,209
The Olympics is really my favorite 
 sporting event,

679
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,921
although I think I have a problem 
 with that silver medal.

680
00:45:23,962 --> 00:45:27,967
I think, if I was an Olympic athlete, 
 I would rather come in last 
 then win the silver.

681
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,887
If you think about it... 
 if you win the gold, you feel good.

682
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:35,599
If you win in the bronze, you think: "Well, 
 at least I got something."

683
00:45:35,642 --> 00:45:36,601
But if you win that silver, it's like:

684
00:45:36,642 --> 00:45:39,312
"Congratulations! You... almost won."

685
00:45:39,353 --> 00:45:43,358
"Of all the losers, 
 you came in first of that group."

686
00:45:44,358 --> 00:45:47,612
"You're the number one... loser."

687
00:45:47,653 --> 00:45:51,657
"No one lost... ahead of you."

688
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:57,789
And they don't loose by much. 
 These short races...

689
00:45:57,831 --> 00:45:59,791
Three hundredths of a second, 
 two hundredths of a second...

690
00:45:59,832 --> 00:46:01,919
I don't know how they live with that

691
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,002
the rest of their lives.

692
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:04,713
'Cause they gotta tell the story.

693
00:46:04,755 --> 00:46:05,922
Everyone wants to hear the story.

694
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,423
"Wow! Congratulations! Silver medal!"

695
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:11,427
"Did you trip? Did you not hear the gun go off? 
 Tell us what happened."

696
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,015
It's a hundredth of a second.

697
00:46:15,057 --> 00:46:19,061
People say: 
 "What was the difference in the margin there?"

698
00:46:25,943 --> 00:46:28,487
Eh, uh, that was it.

699
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:30,489
I trained, I worked out, 
 I exercised my entire life,

700
00:46:30,531 --> 00:46:33,117
I never had a date, I never had a drink, 
 I never had a beer,

701
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:37,121
I was doing push-ups since I was fetus, 
 I flew halfway around the world,

702
00:46:37,163 --> 00:46:39,499
everybody I knew in my whole life was there, 
 the gun was shot...

703
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:43,545
Eh, ooh!

704
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:51,593
And they always have that photo finish...

705
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:55,640
That photo finish is always: silver, gold.

706
00:46:55,765 --> 00:46:56,392
This is the whole race.

707
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:59,519
Gold, silver, bronze.

708
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,565
Dead last.

709
00:47:04,358 --> 00:47:08,362
Greatest guy in the world... 
 never heard of him.

710
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:14,410
The guy's gotta be thinking:

711
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:18,456
"If I had a pimple, I would have won!"

712
00:47:19,832 --> 00:47:22,126
Some of the events in the Olympics 
 don't make sense to me.

713
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:24,504
I don't understand the connection 
 to any reality...

714
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:28,090
Like in the Winter Olympics 
 they have that biathlon.

715
00:47:28,132 --> 00:47:32,136
That combines cross-country 
 skiing with shooting a gun.

716
00:47:32,636 --> 00:47:35,806
How many alpine snipers are into this?

717
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:39,226
Ski, shoot a gun... ski, bang, bang, bang...

718
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:42,188
It's like combining 
 swimming and strangle a guy.

719
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,606
Why don't we have that?

720
00:47:43,648 --> 00:47:45,399
That makes absolutely as much sense to me.

721
00:47:45,441 --> 00:47:49,445
Just put people in the pool at the end 
 of each lane for the swimmers...

722
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:04,919
And that other one that I love is the __looge__

723
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,089
When the guy wears this slick suit...

724
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:11,927
This is on the bob-sledge run, 
 but it's not even a sledge.

725
00:48:11,968 --> 00:48:15,097
It's just Bob.

726
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:19,017
It's just a human being 
 hanging on for their life.

727
00:48:19,058 --> 00:48:23,064
This is the whole sport.

728
00:48:25,566 --> 00:48:29,570
"Oh, he pointed his toes. 
 Oh, this guy's a tremendous athlete."

729
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,622
The __looge__ is the only sport 
 that I've ever seen

730
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:43,125
that you could have people 
 competing in it against their will

731
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:45,712
and it would be exactly the same.

732
00:48:45,753 --> 00:48:47,421
If they were just grabbing 
 people off the street...

733
00:48:47,462 --> 00:48:49,799
"Hey, hey, hey... what is this?"

734
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,011
"I don't wanna be in the __looge__."

735
00:48:53,052 --> 00:48:54,094
You put the helmet on,

736
00:48:54,137 --> 00:48:55,304
you wouldn't really hear them screaming...

737
00:48:55,345 --> 00:48:59,351
You'd just... "You're in the __looge__, buddy."

738
00:49:02,353 --> 00:49:04,897
World record.

739
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:08,192
Didn't even wanna do it.

740
00:49:08,234 --> 00:49:12,238
I wanna see that event next year: 
 'the involuntary __looge__.'

741
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:20,121
I consider myself something of a sportsman.

742
00:49:20,163 --> 00:49:22,415
I like sporty type things.

743
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:26,211
Scooba-diving. 
 Did that in Australia... that was a lotta fun.

744
00:49:26,252 --> 00:49:28,630
A great activity where your main goal is to...

745
00:49:28,671 --> 00:49:32,634
not die.

746
00:49:32,968 --> 00:49:35,305
It's really all I was thinking 
 about the entire day.

747
00:49:35,346 --> 00:49:38,431
"Don't die, don't die, don't die..."

748
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:42,435
"There's a fish. There's a rock. 
 Who cares? Don't die..."

749
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:45,605
"Let's swim, and breathe, and live..."

750
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:47,525
"Because living is good"

751
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:51,571
"and dying... not as good."

752
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,910
So I go with this guy... Mister Scooba-Guy.

753
00:49:56,951 --> 00:49:59,703
He takes me to the store, 
 makes sure I buy everything I need...

754
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:03,750
I had the waterproof wallet... nylon...

755
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:08,546
in case we run into a sea turtle 
 that can break a 50.

756
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,594
Waterproof watch...

757
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:18,640
That's important, gee... 
 "You're completely out of 
 oxygen and look at the time."

758
00:50:19,974 --> 00:50:23,937
"Geez, now I'm dead and I'm late."

759
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,318
I like these somewhat high risk 
 things: the scooba...

760
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:33,113
I've gone hand gliding, I've gone skydiving, 
 I like a little bit of risk...

761
00:50:33,154 --> 00:50:36,033
I don't know, maybe that's why I do this...

762
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:37,993
I saw a thing, actually a study that said:

763
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:42,038
speaking in front of a crowd is considered 
 the number one fear of the average person.

764
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,000
I found that amazing.

765
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:48,045
Number two, was death.

766
00:50:48,169 --> 00:50:50,506
Death is number two?

767
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,009
This means, to the average person, 
 if you have to be at a funeral,

768
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:57,054
you would rather be in the casket 
 than doing the eulogy.

769
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:09,567
Skydiving was definitely 
 the scariest thing I've ever done.

770
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,028
Let me ask you this question 
 in regards to the skydiving:

771
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:16,074
what is the point of the helmet 
 in the skydiving?

772
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:22,998
Can you kinda make it?

773
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,417
You jump out of that plane and that 
 chute doesn't open,

774
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:29,462
the helmet is now wearing you for protection.

775
00:51:30,756 --> 00:51:33,133
Later on, the helmet's talking 
 with the other helmets:

776
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:36,929
"It's a good thing he was there 
 or I would have hit the ground directly."

777
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:40,932
"You never jump out of a plane unless you got 
 a human being strapped underneath you."

778
00:51:40,975 --> 00:51:44,936
"That's basic safety."

779
00:51:45,646 --> 00:51:49,650
There are many things we can point to 
 as proof that the human being is not smart.

780
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:52,695
The helmet is my personal favorite.

781
00:51:52,737 --> 00:51:55,532
The fact that we had to invent the helmet...

782
00:51:55,573 --> 00:51:57,533
Why did we invent the helmet?

783
00:51:57,575 --> 00:52:01,536
Well, because we were participating 
 in many activities that were 
 cracking our heads.

784
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:03,914
We looked at the situation...

785
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:07,334
We chose not to avoid these activities

786
00:52:07,377 --> 00:52:09,712
but to just make little plastic hats

787
00:52:09,754 --> 00:52:13,715
so that we can continue our head 
 cracking lifestyles.

788
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:16,720
The only thing dumber than the helmet, 
 is the helmet law,

789
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:20,765
the point of which is to protect 
 a brain that is functioning so poorly

790
00:52:20,973 --> 00:52:24,978
it's not even trying to stop 
 the cracking of the head that it's in.

791
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,109
At least the helmet is functional clothing.

792
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,735
I appreciate that.

793
00:52:31,776 --> 00:52:35,321
Clothing to me, for the most part, is just 
 such a tremendous pain in the ass.

794
00:52:35,363 --> 00:52:39,368
If you think of the amount of time, 
 mental effort, physical energy,

795
00:52:40,453 --> 00:52:43,830
that goes into your clothes: 
 picking'em, buying'em, does that go with that

796
00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:45,917
I don't think I can wear that, 
 I'm missing a button, this is dirty,

797
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:49,212
I gotta get something new, 
 that's up my ass, can't wear this...

798
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:52,214
I think we should all wear the same 
 exact clothes.

799
00:52:52,255 --> 00:52:54,800
Because it seems to be what 
 happens eventually, anyway.

800
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:58,595
Anytime you see a movie or a TV-show 
 where there's people from the future

801
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:00,097
or another planet

802
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:02,808
they're all wearing the same outfit.

803
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,309
I think the decision just gets made:

804
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:08,356
"All right, everyone, from now on, 
 it's just gonna be the one piece silver suit"

805
00:53:08,439 --> 00:53:12,110
"with the V stripe and the boots."

806
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:14,403
"That's the outfit."

807
00:53:14,445 --> 00:53:18,450
"We're gonna be visiting other planets, 
 we wanna look like a team here."

808
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:22,579
"The individuality thing is over."

809
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:25,499
The dry cleaner I can't stand.

810
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,918
'Cause I don't think he's doing it.

811
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:31,963
I don't know what goes on back there but 
 I cannot conceive such a thing 
 as actual dry cleaning.

812
00:53:32,755 --> 00:53:35,925
We all accept it 'cause we 
 see the stores everywhere.

813
00:53:35,968 --> 00:53:38,219
But, think about it. Dry? What is dry?

814
00:53:38,261 --> 00:53:40,597
You can't clean something dry.

815
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:43,017
What do they do? Tap it, shake it, blow on it?

816
00:53:43,058 --> 00:53:45,310
There's gotta be some 
 kind of a liquid back there.

817
00:53:45,352 --> 00:53:48,022
Did you ever get something on your 
 clothes and get it off with your fingernail?

818
00:53:48,063 --> 00:53:50,815
That's dry cleaning.

819
00:53:50,858 --> 00:53:54,110
That is the only dry cleaning.

820
00:53:54,152 --> 00:53:56,822
I brought this guy a suede jacket...

821
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,407
got spots on it 'cause I was in the rain.

822
00:53:58,449 --> 00:53:59,909
He says: "there's nothing we can do."

823
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,035
"Water ruins leather."

824
00:54:02,078 --> 00:54:05,706
Aren't cows outdoors a lot of the time?

825
00:54:05,747 --> 00:54:07,500
What? If it rains do the cows 
 go up to the farmhouse

826
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:11,003
"Hey, let us in. 
 We're all wearing leather out here."

827
00:54:11,045 --> 00:54:15,049
"Hey, open up, man. I'm suede."

828
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:20,262
"I'm living suede."

829
00:54:21,473 --> 00:54:25,477
'Dry clean only' is definitely the only 
 warning label 
 that human beings actually respect.

830
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:30,607
They look at cigarettes: "This will 
 give you cancer, kill you an the kids."

831
00:54:30,648 --> 00:54:33,527
"It's good, I'll do whatever the hell I want."

832
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:35,612
"Don't drink this medicine and operate 
 heavy machinery."

833
00:54:35,653 --> 00:54:38,907
"Who cares. That's for people who don't 
 know what the hell they're doing."

834
00:54:38,948 --> 00:54:40,701
"I'm a pro."

835
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:43,412
But if you have something that's dry clean only 
 and somebody goes to put it in 
 the washing machine

836
00:54:43,453 --> 00:54:45,122
"Don't put it in the washing machine! 
 It's dry clean only!"

837
00:54:45,163 --> 00:54:49,168
"Are you crazy, are you out of your mind?"

838
00:54:55,674 --> 00:54:57,926
It is amazing what people will believe.

839
00:54:57,968 --> 00:54:59,803
I watch these infomercials late at night...

840
00:54:59,845 --> 00:55:03,848
If it gets late enough the products 
 start to look good to me.

841
00:55:04,642 --> 00:55:07,603
I have actually found myself 
 sitting there thinking

842
00:55:07,645 --> 00:55:11,649
"I don't think I have a knife 
 that can cut through the shoe."

843
00:55:14,361 --> 00:55:18,364
"I don't think any of my knives are good 
 enough to cut through shoes."

844
00:55:19,573 --> 00:55:23,578
"I'm gonna get this 
 knife and cut my shoes off."

845
00:55:23,744 --> 00:55:27,123
"That seems pretty good."

846
00:55:27,164 --> 00:55:29,417
I think the dumbest 
 thing you can do late at night is

847
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:33,005
"I'm gonna get this thing and get in shape."

848
00:55:33,046 --> 00:55:36,632
It's 3 in the morning, you got potato 
 chip crumbs on your shirt,

849
00:55:36,675 --> 00:55:39,927
you got one eye open, 
 one sock hanging of the foot.

850
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,805
"I'm gonna start working out with this thing."

851
00:55:41,846 --> 00:55:43,140
"I'm gonna order this thing."

852
00:55:43,181 --> 00:55:45,933
"This is all I need to get in shape."

853
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:49,980
"This is a fantastic device."

854
00:55:53,859 --> 00:55:56,611
Rip-off.

855
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:59,531
We can't stop getting ripped-off. 
 We're gonna get ripped off.

856
00:55:59,572 --> 00:56:02,826
We think we're not, we think we're very clever,

857
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:04,412
we think we're gonna foil the crooks.

858
00:56:04,453 --> 00:56:07,414
We go to the beach, go in the water, 
 put you wallet in the sneaker,

859
00:56:07,455 --> 00:56:10,334
who's gonna know?

860
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:14,380
What criminal mind could penetrate 
 this fortress of security?

861
00:56:15,046 --> 00:56:18,634
"I put it down by the toe. 
 They never look there."

862
00:56:18,676 --> 00:56:22,680
"They check the heels, they move on."

863
00:56:22,763 --> 00:56:24,515
When you have a TV set 
 in the back of your car

864
00:56:24,557 --> 00:56:26,433
and you gotta leave the car 
 in the street for a few minutes

865
00:56:26,476 --> 00:56:30,479
so you put a sweater over the TV.

866
00:56:32,273 --> 00:56:35,610
"It's a couple of sweaters, that's all."

867
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:39,656
"One of them is square with an 
 antenna coming out of it."

868
00:56:42,868 --> 00:56:46,621
So feeble the things we 
 come up with to foil the crooks!

869
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:49,832
The 'Wanted' posters at the post office...

870
00:56:49,874 --> 00:56:53,212
You're there, you got your package, 
 you're trying to mail something,

871
00:56:53,253 --> 00:56:55,839
this guy's wanted in 12 states.

872
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,425
Yeah, now what? Ok.

873
00:56:58,466 --> 00:57:01,512
I check the guy standing in line behind me...

874
00:57:01,553 --> 00:57:05,557
if it's not him, that's 
 pretty much all I can do.

875
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:09,978
Why don't they just hold on to this guy 
 when they're taking his picture.

876
00:57:17,152 --> 00:57:19,823
"The guy's there with you!"

877
00:57:19,864 --> 00:57:23,867
"Come out from behind the camera and grab him!"

878
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,705
"No, we don't do that. 
 We take their picture, we let them go."

879
00:57:27,746 --> 00:57:29,415
"That's how we get the front and side shot."

880
00:57:29,456 --> 00:57:33,462
"The front is his face, 
 the side is him leaving."

881
00:57:35,379 --> 00:57:37,340
Why don't they put the pictures 
 of the criminals on the postage stamps?

882
00:57:37,381 --> 00:57:38,424
Let the postman look for'em.

883
00:57:38,467 --> 00:57:41,510
He's out there walking around all day.

884
00:57:41,553 --> 00:57:42,720
He's got the uniform on.

885
00:57:42,761 --> 00:57:45,139
Can't he do something?

886
00:57:45,181 --> 00:57:49,185
"We got another letter for you, mister Jon..."

887
00:57:52,856 --> 00:57:56,860
"I think that's him..."---

888
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,240
So we really had a good time...

889
00:58:01,281 --> 00:58:02,616
This is the end of a long tour.

890
00:58:02,657 --> 00:58:04,117
When you're on the road

891
00:58:04,158 --> 00:58:07,203
you always have to do whatever 
 anyone suggests that day.

892
00:58:07,246 --> 00:58:09,122
Because you have nothing to do

893
00:58:09,164 --> 00:58:10,916
and you have no ideas

894
00:58:10,957 --> 00:58:13,044
so you do whatever anyone suggests.

895
00:58:13,085 --> 00:58:14,836
So, a couple of weeks we go to the track.

896
00:58:14,879 --> 00:58:17,423
I did that a couple of times in my life.

897
00:58:17,464 --> 00:58:19,425
Betting on the horses...

898
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:20,133
you can't possibly win.

899
00:58:20,175 --> 00:58:23,220
I don't understand what we're betting on...

900
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:26,808
Do the horses know that it's a race? 
 Are they aware?

901
00:58:26,849 --> 00:58:28,934
What is going on here?

902
00:58:28,976 --> 00:58:30,728
After the race are the horses 
 walking back to the stable:

903
00:58:30,769 --> 00:58:34,522
"I was third, I was first, I was ninth."

904
00:58:34,566 --> 00:58:38,569
I think they're thinking: "Oat bag, 
 I get my oat bag now!"

905
00:58:38,653 --> 00:58:42,532
"Oat bag time."

906
00:58:42,573 --> 00:58:46,118
I gotta bet on this idiot?

907
00:58:46,161 --> 00:58:50,165
I mean, I'm sure the horses have 
 some idea that the jockey is in a big hurry.

908
00:58:50,957 --> 00:58:52,833
I mean, he's on him, 
 he's hitting him with this thing.

909
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:55,129
He's going: "Come on, come on"

910
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,631
Obviously he's in a hurry, 
 the jockey's in a hurry.

911
00:58:57,672 --> 00:59:00,424
But the horse must get to the end and go:

912
00:59:00,468 --> 00:59:04,471
"We were just here! 
 What was the point of that?"

913
00:59:05,848 --> 00:59:08,307
"This is where we were."

914
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:12,354
"That was the longest possible 
 route you could take."

915
00:59:14,063 --> 00:59:18,068
"Why didn't we just stay here? 
 We would have been first!"

916
00:59:22,072 --> 00:59:24,324
I'll tell you one thing the horses 
 definitely do not know.

917
00:59:24,367 --> 00:59:27,119
They do not know that if you should 
 accidentally trip

918
00:59:27,161 --> 00:59:29,913
and break your leg at any point during the race

919
00:59:29,956 --> 00:59:33,960
we blow your brains out.

920
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:38,214
I think they're missing that little 
 tidbit of information.

921
00:59:38,256 --> 00:59:39,214
I think if they knew that

922
00:59:39,257 --> 00:59:42,843
you'd see some mighty careful stepping 
 coming down that home stretch.

923
00:59:42,885 --> 00:59:46,890
"Take it easy, take it easy."

924
00:59:46,972 --> 00:59:50,977
"You win, I'll place... whatever."

925
00:59:52,354 --> 00:59:56,357
"The important thing is your health."

926
01:00:06,368 --> 01:00:07,535
I've gone horseback riding.

927
01:00:07,577 --> 01:00:11,247
I can't do that.

928
01:00:11,289 --> 01:00:13,542
They don't give you the really good horses

929
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:16,627
when you're not good at it, I found out.

930
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:20,215
The guy says: "What level rider 
 would you say that you are?"

931
01:00:20,257 --> 01:00:24,135
I say: "I don't know... Zero, nothing, 
 whatever the system is."

932
01:00:24,176 --> 01:00:26,931
"I can't do it. Is that clear enough for you?"

933
01:00:26,972 --> 01:00:29,642
"I'm going where the horse wants to go."

934
01:00:29,684 --> 01:00:33,312
"That's my level."

935
01:00:33,353 --> 01:00:34,521
After they hear that, 
 they start looking around:

936
01:00:34,563 --> 01:00:38,567
"All right, is Glue Stick back yet?"

937
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:44,657
"How 'bout Almost Dead? 
 Why don't you saddle him up?"

938
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:50,662
So I get on this U-shaped 
 lightning-quick steed...

939
01:00:52,874 --> 01:00:56,877
I got the only horse you could put your feet 
 flat on the ground while you're riding it.

940
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:02,175
"I'm riding a hammock here."

941
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:03,927
Looking up at my friends:

942
01:01:03,968 --> 01:01:07,973
"I don't think that we all got 
 the same kind of horse here."

943
01:01:09,683 --> 01:01:10,808
It's kind of a secure feeling.

944
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:14,854
I could walk along with him if I wanted.

945
01:01:17,357 --> 01:01:20,319
And the horse wasn't too thrilled 
 with having me either.

946
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,321
'Cause I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

947
01:01:22,362 --> 01:01:24,948
So he takes control.

948
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:28,953
Going this way, going that way...

949
01:01:29,161 --> 01:01:32,623
Then they just stop.

950
01:01:32,665 --> 01:01:35,125
"What? What is it?"

951
01:01:35,168 --> 01:01:39,171
And they look up at you...

952
01:01:42,882 --> 01:01:46,888
"Chill-out hop-along. I know the trail."

953
01:01:47,763 --> 01:01:51,768
"I'm here every goddamn day, ok?"

954
01:01:52,267 --> 01:01:56,272
"And I really appreciate the kicking 
 while I'm taking a leak, too."

955
01:01:57,064 --> 01:02:01,068
"Thanks a lot. That really 
 improves the already wonderful 
 life that I have."

956
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:06,282
"People either sitting on me or 
 kicking me while I'm peeing."

957
01:02:06,866 --> 01:02:10,871
"I'm living in a paradise here at the ranch."

958
01:02:11,662 --> 01:02:13,832
I get out of a car that has 300 horsepower

959
01:02:13,874 --> 01:02:17,878
so I can sit on an animal that has one.

960
01:02:18,963 --> 01:02:20,547
Why do we even use the term 'horsepower'?

961
01:02:20,588 --> 01:02:22,716
Is that to further humiliate horses?

962
01:02:22,757 --> 01:02:25,635
The space-shuttle rockets 
 have 20 million horsepower.

963
01:02:25,677 --> 01:02:28,930
Is there any point in still comparing it...

964
01:02:28,973 --> 01:02:31,224
to the horses?

965
01:02:31,266 --> 01:02:34,311
Any chance of going back to using 
 rockets with horses,

966
01:02:34,353 --> 01:02:37,941
trying to keep track of how many 
 we're gonna need?

967
01:02:37,982 --> 01:02:39,817
"Hey, horse. There's a rocket engine that broke down."

968
01:02:39,858 --> 01:02:43,112
"Can you get 20 million friends 
 together really fast?"

969
01:02:43,153 --> 01:02:47,158
"20 million? That's a lot."

970
01:02:50,286 --> 01:02:51,912
They make glue out of horses.

971
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:54,414
I don't know who started that.

972
01:02:54,456 --> 01:02:57,042
Who saw that potential?

973
01:02:57,085 --> 01:02:58,920
That's pretty amazing to me.

974
01:02:58,961 --> 01:03:01,840
Working in a stationery store, 
 a horse walks by:

975
01:03:01,881 --> 01:03:05,884
"Hey, wait a minute!"

976
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,850
"I think he could be glue."

977
01:03:11,891 --> 01:03:13,351
"How do we pick out the really sticky ones?"

978
01:03:13,392 --> 01:03:15,811
"You leave that to me."

979
01:03:15,854 --> 01:03:16,813
"What about that one over there?"

980
01:03:16,855 --> 01:03:18,314
"He's weaving around. He looks 
 like he's out of his mind."

981
01:03:18,356 --> 01:03:22,360
"He'll be 'crazy glue'."

982
01:03:27,574 --> 01:03:31,035
To me the toughest part of that 
 horse life is that trailer.

983
01:03:31,078 --> 01:03:33,038
Why do they make the horse trailer like that?

984
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:35,541
Is that the best way to move a 
 horse out on the highway?

985
01:03:35,582 --> 01:03:39,335
With their huge fat disgusting 
 rear ends right in my face?

986
01:03:39,378 --> 01:03:41,129
Do the horses like it?

987
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:43,132
They're probably standing in the back, going:

988
01:03:43,173 --> 01:03:47,052
"Do you feel a draft, Bill?"

989
01:03:47,093 --> 01:03:51,056
"I can't see anything back there, 
 but it's awfully breezy, isn't it?"

990
01:03:51,473 --> 01:03:55,477
"You don't think our huge fat asses are 
 hanging out the back of this truck, do you."

991
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:01,317
"Why the hell would they do that to us?"

992
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,237
"They already ride us around and kick 
 us while we're peeing,

993
01:04:04,279 --> 01:04:08,283
why would they stick our ass out of a truck?"

994
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:14,622
But I have fully adjusted to the road.

995
01:04:14,664 --> 01:04:16,541
I like hotels.

996
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:18,917
I enjoy tiny soap.

997
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:22,965
I pretend that it's normal 
 soap and my muscles are huge.

998
01:04:26,468 --> 01:04:28,928
And you can always tell when you're 
 in a fine quality luxury hotel

999
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:32,974
when the TV is bolted to a solid steel 
 beam and welded into the wall.

1000
01:04:33,892 --> 01:04:35,853
Is this a big problem in the hotel business?

1001
01:04:35,895 --> 01:04:39,856
People coming up to the desk: 
 "I'd like to check out."

1002
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,028
The main thing is the bathroom, the shower,

1003
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:46,655
that's gotta be good.

1004
01:04:46,698 --> 01:04:48,740
That's why I don't like to stay 
 with people on the road.

1005
01:04:48,782 --> 01:04:49,950
I don't want to be in other people's showers.

1006
01:04:49,991 --> 01:04:52,119
I don't know how to operate them.

1007
01:04:52,161 --> 01:04:54,622
You can never get the ratios 
 right on the dials.

1008
01:04:54,664 --> 01:04:57,833
Sometimes a 16th of an inch 
 is a thousand degrees.

1009
01:04:57,875 --> 01:05:01,879
You gotta get out of the way of the water.

1010
01:05:04,172 --> 01:05:07,343
There's always that little hair 
 stuck on the wall, too.

1011
01:05:07,384 --> 01:05:10,138
And you wanna get rid of it 
 but you don't wanna touch it.

1012
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:13,641
I don't know how it got up that 
 high in the first place.

1013
01:05:13,683 --> 01:05:17,687
Maybe it's got a life of its own.

1014
01:05:18,270 --> 01:05:22,275
So you gotta aim the shower head at the hair...

1015
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:31,326
That never works.

1016
01:05:31,367 --> 01:05:35,371
You gotta get a pool of water from 
 under the shower and over to the hair.

1017
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:40,962
Get it down a foot at a time like this.

1018
01:05:41,586 --> 01:05:45,590
The hair is hanging on.

1019
01:05:49,971 --> 01:05:52,932
But... we have to fight these battles.

1020
01:05:52,973 --> 01:05:54,725
We're all alone in the bathroom.

1021
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:57,019
Whatever goes wrong you have to handle it.

1022
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,646
Did you ever go to a big party, 
 go into the bathroom,

1023
01:05:58,687 --> 01:06:02,440
flush the toilet, the water starts coming up...

1024
01:06:02,483 --> 01:06:06,320
This is the most frightening 
 moment in the life of a human being.

1025
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,823
You'll do anything to stop this.

1026
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:10,533
You'll loose your mind, 
 start talking to the toilet:

1027
01:06:10,574 --> 01:06:12,244
"No, please, don't do this to me!"

1028
01:06:12,285 --> 01:06:14,244
"No, come on, 
 you know this is not my responsibility."

1029
01:06:14,287 --> 01:06:15,621
"I didn't make this happen."

1030
01:06:15,663 --> 01:06:17,123
"I'll get you the blue thing, 
 the man in the boat,

1031
01:06:17,164 --> 01:06:19,333
just let me off the hook this one time."

1032
01:06:19,374 --> 01:06:20,251
Thank you very much.

1033
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:22,045
You've been a wonderful audience.

1034
01:06:22,086 --> 01:06:26,090
Thank you for coming.
