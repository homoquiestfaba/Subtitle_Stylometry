1
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,591
Fuck.

2
00:01:02,327 --> 00:01:05,329
<i>I race the
sun home in the morning...</i>

3
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:07,564
<i>and the moon up at night.</i>

4
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:13,470
<i>There's just today,</i>

5
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:16,840
<i>and then there's tonight.</i>

6
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:21,278
<i>Anything can happen,</i>

7
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:23,346
<i>then anything does.</i>

8
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:27,751
<i>Get through it.</i>

9
00:01:27,818 --> 00:01:32,889
You've got 10 minutes to get out of my
house before my sisters get up for school.

10
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:39,963
I... I... It's some
Jewish people holiday.

11
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:43,634
- Ain't no school.
- Then you got five minutes.

12
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:48,204
Yeah?

13
00:01:56,948 --> 00:01:58,915
All right.

14
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,696
<i>I ain't seen this one before.</i>

15
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:21,538
<i>He probably won't kill me.
It ain't happened yet.</i>

16
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:44,394
<i>But it's like when people tell
you that their dog doesn't bite.</i>

17
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:46,697
<i>How do they know?</i>

18
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:03,814
<i>Oh, and nobody's coming
to save my ass.</i>

19
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:06,717
<i>It took me a minute
to get that.</i>

20
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:10,821
<i>The man in the white hat,
the man on the white horse--</i>

21
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:14,858
<i>yeah, he ain't coming.</i>

22
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:45,589
<i>I remember when I was 10 somebody
gave me a diary for a present,</i>

23
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:48,692
<i>and I felt like
it was too late...</i>

24
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:52,529
<i>so I didn't write in it.</i>

25
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:54,631
<i>Too much had already happened.</i>

26
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:01,337
<i>So it wouldn't be
the whole story.</i>

27
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:04,240
<i>I feel that way again,</i>

28
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:06,209
<i>and I'm 14.</i>

29
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,647
<i>But nobody'd believe it.</i>

30
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,052
<i>Ain't nobody to tell.</i>

31
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:21,058
<i>If a girl falls in the city
and nobody sees it,</i>

32
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,696
<i>did it happen?</i>

33
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,002
Get up.

34
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:35,072
Shit.

35
00:04:37,274 --> 00:04:39,510
Get up.

36
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:41,812
Is it cold?

37
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,848
Not really. Wash
your face, stinky.

38
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:58,695
Where's your little sister?

39
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:16,747
Sheila's.

40
00:05:18,182 --> 00:05:20,017
What?

41
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:22,986
- That's where she's at.
- Who?

42
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:24,855
Cammie.

43
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:27,825
I asked you that,
like, an hour ago.

44
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,559
Yeah, well, she's at Sheila's.

45
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:32,863
Even though Sheila's mom says
she can't stay there no more...

46
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,799
because she can't afford to
feed seven kids, only six.

47
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,401
Like, what's the big whoop?

48
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:42,005
But Cammie keeps going over
there every day after school,

49
00:05:42,072 --> 00:05:44,507
and by the time Sheila's mom gets home
from her second job at the dog track--

50
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,409
lame...

51
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:49,546
she doesn't have enough energy to wake
Cammie up and kick her out in the street.

52
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:53,516
Cammie's fuckin' little. She
don't take up that much room.

53
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,485
Yeah, but she eats up
all their food.

54
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:57,487
Good for her.
Maybe she'll grow.

55
00:05:57,555 --> 00:06:00,323
What are you gonna do today?

56
00:06:00,391 --> 00:06:02,425
Nothing.

57
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:05,963
Well, deliver these papers.

58
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,165
Go bum food at Kelly's mom's.

59
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:13,069
Oh, and I got this book report on
a book I probably read in utero.

60
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,239
And play my sax.

61
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:19,242
How about take a bath?

62
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:21,444
- Mom here?
- Yeah.

63
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:23,446
Then no.

64
00:06:46,037 --> 00:06:48,138
Hey, Bee!
Wait up!

65
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:49,973
You coming back?

66
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,142
You making breakfast?

67
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,111
I could make
macaroni and cheese,

68
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:57,547
although we don't make
any milk or any butter.

69
00:06:57,615 --> 00:07:00,049
Orange-water macaroni?

70
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:02,919
I found some nacho cheese
Doritos from last night.

71
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:06,589
- I can smash 'em up in the bowl with water and--
- Nah. That doesn't work.

72
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:08,658
- It kinda does.
- Not!

73
00:07:08,726 --> 00:07:12,229
- Does.
- I'd rather eat dirt.

74
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:14,497
One hour.

75
00:07:14,565 --> 00:07:17,467
One hour, queer bait.

76
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:20,870
<i>Bee poured out
all the liquor in the house once.</i>

77
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:23,006
<i>That went over real well.</i>

78
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:01,197
<i>He kissed me...</i>

79
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,267
<i>about a week ago.</i>

80
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,995
Are you breaking into
people's houses now?

81
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:35,231
Fuck you.

82
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:38,335
I was rollin' bones
behind Ju-Ju's.

83
00:10:39,503 --> 00:10:41,971
Them niggers
don't know how to act.

84
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,906
Well, you tell 'em.

85
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:46,309
You win, at least?

86
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:50,847
I rolled hard eights for an
hour straight, little girl.

87
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:53,316
You didn't answer my question.

88
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:56,252
I'm trying to told you.

89
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,354
You just didn't heard me.

90
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:05,028
You count it.

91
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,352
<i>And I kissed him back.</i>

92
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:44,500
- Here, my girl.
- Supposed to start shootin' folks now?

93
00:11:44,568 --> 00:11:47,971
If you want to.
Who would you shoot first?

94
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:50,306
You.

95
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:53,042
What's the matter?
Don't like McDonald's no more?

96
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,944
I'm gonna eat it.

97
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:57,814
Don't worry about it
with your black ass.

98
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:02,451
You got jokes.

99
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,922
- Three hundred and...
- Eighty-two dollars.

100
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:10,526
Man, them niggers shouldn't mess with the kid.
Think they slick.

101
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:12,462
What day is today?

102
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,132
Well, it used to be
called Monday,

103
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:19,635
but after the rebirth
of the cool tonight--

104
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:21,571
Uh, no.

105
00:12:21,638 --> 00:12:23,639
After the rain falls down
like a mighty river--

106
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:27,810
Calm down, reverend. I got it.
You got a game tonight.

107
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:29,912
A game?

108
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,081
Baby, don't you
read the papers?

109
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:35,451
This is the ladies'
conference championship...

110
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,289
in the guise of an ass-whippin'
of biblical proportions.

111
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:48,431
Calm your narrow ass down.

112
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:55,704
I read about you
in the papers, girl.

113
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:57,706
What did it say?

114
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:00,644
That you love me.

115
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:02,612
And?

116
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:12,222
And that you was fixin' to open a can of
whup-ass on the basketball court tonight.

117
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,390
So you can read.

118
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,562
Do you still love me?

119
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:23,633
Of course I do.

120
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:32,842
What's goin' on
with the freaks?

121
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:40,883
I kicked some big-headed nigger
out of here a little while ago.

122
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,885
Alfred.

123
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,087
I didn't ask him his name.

124
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,722
Tommy.

125
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,925
- I don't know. I never saw him before.
- What?

126
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:52,061
You deaf too? I said, I
never saw him before.

127
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:54,230
Oh, hell, no.

128
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:57,600
This double-trick bitch
owes somebody some money.

129
00:14:02,873 --> 00:14:04,707
Sarah!

130
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:07,644
- Hey, baby.
- Get your ugly ass up, bitch.

131
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:10,946
- I was waiting for you.
- You got my fuckin' money?

132
00:14:11,014 --> 00:14:14,317
I don't wanna hear shit, bitch. What, you drink supper?
And open a fuckin' window!

133
00:14:14,385 --> 00:14:16,252
Smells like somebody's ass!

134
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,422
What the fuck you think this is? You
know I don't play games. Oh, come on!

135
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,957
Bitch!

136
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:24,227
<i>I don't want no
part of what goes on in there.</i>

137
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:26,396
Yeah, that's right, ho.

138
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:29,899
Shut the fuck up.

139
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:33,436
<i>But I sure do like being kissed.</i>

140
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:47,250
$442.

141
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:54,557
You ain't gon' eat it?

142
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:57,927
I don't give a fuck
about no Egg McMuffin.

143
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,929
Suit yourself, little girl.

144
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:29,024
Cammie. Cammie?

145
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,431
Mama says you gotta go.

146
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:39,135
Fuck.

147
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:41,837
- What time is it?
- Don't matter.

148
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:44,274
Mama says you gotta go.

149
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:52,948
- Go, go, go! Do it! Do it!
- Ray!

150
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:59,188
I got it!

151
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,538
Jesus! What's going on?

152
00:16:15,606 --> 00:16:18,508
Hey, y'all better stop playin'!

153
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:21,077
Mama!
Mike hit me!

154
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:24,913
God damn it, what the hell's going on?

155
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,351
Who touched my towel?

156
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:31,820
This red towel is my towel, and
it's got wet on it. Who touched it?

157
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:33,722
- Mama!
- What?

158
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,326
- Cammie, you've gotta go home.
- Okay.

159
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:38,528
Earl! Burl!

160
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:40,963
- Bye, Cammie.
- Bye, Sheila.

161
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:47,136
- Bye, Mrs. Hightower.
- Bye, little girl.

162
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:49,138
- Okay.
- Thank you.

163
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:51,073
- Bye, honey.
- Sweetheart.

164
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:53,176
Bye.

165
00:16:53,243 --> 00:16:55,044
Mama, Burl's bleeding again.

166
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:58,715
They know where the Band-Aids are.
Sit down. Eat.

167
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:00,550
<i>Earl!</i>

168
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:03,753
Well, Cammie, it looks like you and
I are working the same shift today.

169
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:07,089
- Sure does.
- What do you say we get some breakfast.

170
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:09,091
- Sounds good to me.
- All right.

171
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:12,995
- Wait a minute.
- What?

172
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:15,931
- Looks like you grew about an
inch in your sleep. - Yeah?

173
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:19,068
I don't know if I should
feed you just yet.

174
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:21,470
What... I wanna grow!

175
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:23,506
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

176
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:26,609
Oh, okay.
Well, let's get a move on.

177
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:28,411
Okay.

178
00:17:32,316 --> 00:17:34,651
I wish you was my daddy.

179
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:37,720
I couldn't be your daddy.

180
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:40,823
Yeah, I know. And you couldn't be my kid.

181
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:42,625
Yeah, I know.

182
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:44,661
You wanna know why?

183
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:47,196
Mmm, yeah, I think so.

184
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:49,298
Yeah.

185
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:51,734
- Because I'd kill ya.
- You would not!

186
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:54,303
Sure I would.
I'd kill you with kisses.

187
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:56,205
You can't kill nobody
with kisses.

188
00:17:56,273 --> 00:18:00,276
Oh, yeah, you can, actually, if
you tickle 'em at the same time.

189
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:03,012
- Nah, that wouldn't work.
- Yeah.

190
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,947
- Know what else?
- What?

191
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:09,452
If you were my kid, I'd make you
eat onion and lard sandwiches.

192
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:11,354
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

193
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:14,557
- And I'd make you sleep in the doghouse.
- No, you wouldn't!

194
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,525
You're a good guy.

195
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:24,801
News or sports?

196
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:27,002
Sports.

197
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,139
Sports it is.

198
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:16,752
I ran into a tree,
'cause we were sledding.

199
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:21,958
Where is everything?

200
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:24,660
I cleaned it up.

201
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:27,196
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

202
00:19:27,263 --> 00:19:29,264
Why?

203
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,300
You know, where...

204
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:34,336
where is my...
my stuff?

205
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:36,505
You know, people
always moving...

206
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,708
Where is my stuff?

207
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:41,877
People always moving
all my stuff!

208
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:43,979
You know, this is my house.

209
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:47,750
Can't I leave my stuff where
I want to without people,

210
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:50,853
you know, taking things, moving things?

211
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:58,694
Where the fuck is everything?

212
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:03,633
-Do you want me to make you a drink?
-Lord Jesus Christ on the cross!

213
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,869
Can't I... leave my
things where I want to?

214
00:20:06,937 --> 00:20:10,138
This is my house,
for God's sake.

215
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:13,275
People--

216
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:16,979
People taking things.

217
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:21,116
Taking things...

218
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:24,020
from me.

219
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:26,989
I guess not.

220
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:28,858
What?

221
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:33,996
Why are you always
looking at me sideways?

222
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:37,099
Let me tell you, lots
of shit you don't know.

223
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,769
You think you're all-knowing
about everything.

224
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:41,938
You don't know shit.

225
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:44,306
I ain't looking at you.

226
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:48,745
You always
looking at me.

227
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:55,051
Ain't you got nowhere to go?

228
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:57,053
Leave me alone!

229
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,055
Please.

230
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:01,791
Ohh. Ohh.

231
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,061
I ain't botherin' you.

232
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:06,996
No, no.

233
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:09,331
- I'm just saying...
- You're just saying.

234
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:13,669
- I'm saying.
- No!

235
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:15,638
Whoa.

236
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:18,106
No! Fuck!

237
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,687
Yeah.

238
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:53,041
Look.

239
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:56,345
I'm sayin'...

240
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:07,790
this big one what left...

241
00:22:09,492 --> 00:22:11,427
can fuck.

242
00:22:13,764 --> 00:22:16,365
So when you're ready...

243
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:18,233
you just tell me.

244
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:22,038
'Cause you're gonna have
to do it sooner or later.

245
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:25,141
Might as well
get it done right.

246
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:36,418
Guess we're gonna have to
figure out something soon.

247
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:40,255
One of these days.

248
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:46,362
Gotta pay to play.

249
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:49,498
'Cause you ain't gonna be...

250
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,500
14 forever.

251
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:58,607
Yeah, thank God
for small favors.

252
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:18,427
<i>It wasn't always
like this, all fucked up--</i>

253
00:23:18,494 --> 00:23:23,365
<i>the house, my mom, everything.</i>

254
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:26,068
<i>At the same
time, the disciples--</i>

255
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:28,404
<i>We were a real family once.</i>

256
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:31,373
<i>I had a dad.</i>

257
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:35,177
<i>Jesus called a little
child unto him and set him--</i>

258
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:36,712
<i>He was a preacher.</i>

259
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,815
<i>And said "Verily,
I say unto you,</i>

260
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,285
<i>"except ye be converted and
become as little children,</i>

261
00:23:43,353 --> 00:23:46,188
<i>ye shall not enter into
the kingdom of heaven."</i>

262
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:48,891
<i>I saw him heal
a guy out of a wheelchair once.</i>

263
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:53,195
<i>Dad put his two hands on him and said, "Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus!" real fast, over and over,</i>

264
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:56,132
<i>and the guy got up and walked.</i>

265
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,500
<i>The guy walked, like,
five steps,</i>

266
00:23:58,568 --> 00:24:02,071
<i>and he realized he was walking
and he fell on his face.</i>

267
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:05,708
<i>That's when I
realized this is bullshit.</i>

268
00:24:05,775 --> 00:24:07,843
<i>Believe in me.</i>

269
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,748
<i>Get in there!
Come on!</i>

270
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:14,917
<i>Usually on Sunday,</i>

271
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:18,320
<i>if the Lord had blessed us with an abundant
collection plate-- Fucking whore. Fucking whore!</i>

272
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:21,456
<i>We'd go to a fancy restaurant and
have banana splits.</i>

273
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:29,431
Get over here! What-- Hey,
get out of there! Come on!

274
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:32,635
Get over here! Get out of there!
Come on! Right now! Get out!

275
00:24:32,702 --> 00:24:35,638
Don't worry, Agnes.
I don't want you.

276
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:44,046
<i>So the police finally came
and got us out. Mom too.</i>

277
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:46,949
<i>Dad changed his shirt
'cause he got blood on it...</i>

278
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:52,921
<i>and joked with the cops as Mom and me
and Bee and Cammie drove to some motel.</i>

279
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,893
<i>Then we moved a thousand miles away
and I haven't heard from him since.</i>

280
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:03,899
<i>I did go to church again.</i>

281
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:06,401
<i>Wasn't even that long ago.</i>

282
00:25:06,469 --> 00:25:09,004
<i>Fuckin' door was locked.</i>

283
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:13,575
<i>Swear to God,
you lock the door on me,</i>

284
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:15,811
<i>I lock the door on you.</i>

285
00:25:15,878 --> 00:25:19,215
<i>Took me a while to learn that.</i>

286
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:34,163
Hey, Doc.

287
00:25:41,437 --> 00:25:43,305
All right.

288
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:50,012
Now, this here
is the breakfast of champions.

289
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,981
What you the champion of?
Trifling?

290
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,418
Uh, yeah, that
and choppin' up cows.

291
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:01,456
Excuse me, Dolly,
but got any Chex?

292
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:03,625
Not yet, babe.

293
00:26:03,693 --> 00:26:05,460
No snacks yet.

294
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:17,907
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

295
00:26:17,974 --> 00:26:20,709
Yeah.

296
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:22,544
Yeah.

297
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:25,080
Phone!

298
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:33,389
Clyde, you're
the only one in here.

299
00:26:33,456 --> 00:26:37,192
I guess I'm just a goddamn piece of shit!
Never know! Could be for me!

300
00:26:39,562 --> 00:26:41,430
Yeah?

301
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:45,000
Well, what the fuck...

302
00:26:46,302 --> 00:26:48,938
- Is he in trouble?
- Yeah.

303
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:51,439
- With God.
- All right, I'm there.

304
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:53,609
- Time for Chex Party Mix?
- Mm-mmm.

305
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:55,911
I said I'm there, goddamn it!

306
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:57,713
All right.
I said yeah.

307
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:02,951
So help me God. What does it take?
Just get 'em in.

308
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:05,787
It's just three cows.
Just three cows!

309
00:27:08,124 --> 00:27:11,894
Mother of God! Lord Jesus
fuckin' Christ almighty!

310
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:14,363
Somebody shut the door!

311
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:17,699
White girl! Is you deaf?
See to the door!

312
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:20,669
Okay, Stymie. Geez!

313
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:46,014
"No time ago or else a life,

314
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:49,885
"walking in the dark
I met Christ.

315
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:51,953
"Jesus.

316
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:55,457
"My heart flopped over and
lie still while he passed.

317
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,194
"As close as I am to you,

318
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:01,363
"yes, closer,

319
00:30:01,431 --> 00:30:04,566
made of nothing
except loneliness."

320
00:30:40,636 --> 00:30:43,205
- Come on, light for me, baby.
- Hey, Popeye!

321
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:45,841
- How you doin' this fine day?
- Shit!

322
00:30:45,908 --> 00:30:48,643
Oh, fair to middlin'.

323
00:30:48,711 --> 00:30:51,579
Let me light this one cancer
stick, and I will be golden.

324
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:54,216
How are you doing, big girl?

325
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:56,784
I'm fine too.

326
00:30:56,853 --> 00:30:58,653
- Hey, Meatball.
- Hey.

327
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:00,655
Fixing to move.

328
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:02,690
Say what?

329
00:31:02,758 --> 00:31:05,527
I was just sayin', 'cause you might
not be seeing me around much more...

330
00:31:05,594 --> 00:31:07,695
and I didn't want you to worry.

331
00:31:07,763 --> 00:31:09,564
Wait, wait, wait.

332
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:12,334
You, your mama, your sisters,

333
00:31:12,402 --> 00:31:16,505
a pimp, the Poker House and the
hooker live up in the garage?

334
00:31:16,573 --> 00:31:18,773
Where are y'all
fixin' to move to?

335
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,708
No! Just me.

336
00:31:20,776 --> 00:31:22,577
I'm moving.

337
00:31:22,645 --> 00:31:24,612
Oh. How you gonna do that?

338
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,714
Well, I talked
to my school counselor,

339
00:31:26,782 --> 00:31:28,783
and he talked to
Child Services,

340
00:31:28,851 --> 00:31:31,819
and they say they gon' put me
in a foster house.

341
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:35,224
- A foster house, huh?
- Yeah, a big one over on the north side.

342
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:38,693
'Cause you know only them rich
folk can afford foster kids.

343
00:31:38,761 --> 00:31:41,696
- Mm-hmm.
- My brother's kids got took to a foster house.

344
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:43,765
Old man
fucked every one of 'em.

345
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,768
Forget you, Meatball!
That's a fib.

346
00:31:46,836 --> 00:31:50,172
Well, anyways,
I'm waitin' to hear from 'em.

347
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:52,374
These things take time.

348
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:54,543
Damn, big girl.

349
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:57,212
You think you can get me one
of them new foster houses?

350
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,115
You're too old.
You have bad habits.

351
00:32:04,187 --> 00:32:06,721
Goddamn it!
Uh-huh! See?

352
00:32:06,789 --> 00:32:09,757
You're apin' and clownin', and you
done dropped your damn bottle.

353
00:32:09,825 --> 00:32:11,659
F*ck you, Popeye.

354
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:14,496
What I done told you about
cussin' at me, junior?

355
00:32:14,564 --> 00:32:16,631
I will cut your ass in half...

356
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:19,268
and hide the knife
in your big ass.

357
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,136
- You gonna cut me in half?
- Yeah, yeah.

358
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:24,172
Hey, Popeye, what you got?
You got yourself a chain saw?

359
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,642
Didn't know it was gonna be like this, did ya?
This is a killin' knife!

360
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,677
Killin' knife?
Yeah!

361
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:33,348
- Who you killed lately?
- Ain't killed nobody in years, but I'm 'bout to start today.

362
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:36,952
Come on. Here's your target. You see this move?
I can do this move.

363
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:39,921
What you do now? Come on and
get a little piece of this.

364
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:43,425
You want some of me? Here's a target
for you, Popeye! Come on, buddy!

365
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:45,827
You don't want nothin' about me, baby.

366
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:48,530
I'm a crazy motherfucker.

367
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:01,143
Fuck every-fuckin'-body.

368
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,279
Good morning. La-La and them
liked to got my ass busted.

369
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:08,183
I told that bitch not to fuck around,
but she wanna go start some shit.

370
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:10,252
This should do you
till the first.

371
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,389
I told her, don't go in there messin' with Darryl.
She tellin' me she can handle it.

372
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:16,158
Talkin' 'bout,
"I can handle it."

373
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:19,661
I'm tellin' her, "No, you
can't handle it neither."

374
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,336
Look at you.
You look like Chaka Khan.

375
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:29,571
Only you little,

376
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:31,573
and you ain't got no ass.

377
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:34,776
- Your mama here?
- She's asleep.

378
00:33:34,844 --> 00:33:38,046
- Duval come around this morning?
- Yep.

379
00:33:38,114 --> 00:33:39,781
He say he was looking for me?

380
00:33:39,848 --> 00:33:42,083
Nope.

381
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,586
- Ooh!
- What?

382
00:33:45,855 --> 00:33:47,856
Oh, man alive!

383
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:49,791
Needs titties, baby girl.

384
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:53,395
Look in there
for some boots I got ya.

385
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:55,564
I'm going to bed.

386
00:33:55,698 --> 00:33:59,067
What happened to La-la?

387
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:01,537
She in department store jail.

388
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:05,407
And that's just what she get for messin'
with Darryl, gettin' in his face.

389
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:08,710
-What? -La-La standin' in the middle
of the motherfuckin' parking lot.

390
00:34:08,778 --> 00:34:10,745
Arms full of stolen shit.

391
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:14,416
-Questionin' Darryl about who the fuck
he was with and when. -Get the fuck out!

392
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:18,019
Darryl blew his little whistle and
they came and got that bitch.

393
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:21,122
I tried to talk to her, but
she wasn't havin' none of it.

394
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,558
Thinks she knows
so goddamn much.

395
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:25,860
Well, she handlin' it now.
Fuck her.

396
00:34:25,928 --> 00:34:28,896
And I ain't going to
bail the bitch out neither.

397
00:34:28,964 --> 00:34:32,433
Me go to jail on purpose. That's
just stupid on top of stupid.

398
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:34,135
If Duval comes
sniffin' around here,

399
00:34:34,203 --> 00:34:37,739
you tell him I'll get with him
when I get with him.

400
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:39,741
And don't knock on my door.

401
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,743
I'm really, really tired.

402
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:01,095
He's late.

403
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:03,097
How you know he's late?

404
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:05,099
You ain't got no watch.

405
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:07,035
I know 'cause I know.

406
00:35:07,102 --> 00:35:09,037
Yeah.

407
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:12,407
Here he comes.

408
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:14,643
You know, he own
this whole block.

409
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:18,212
Worst raggedy-ass block
I ever been on.

410
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:21,783
That's how come he's rich.
He saves up all his money.

411
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:25,186
Well, if that's rich livin',
I don't want no part of it.

412
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:28,256
Looks like your master
plan's workin' out there!

413
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:33,194
Now, why you want me to cut
you so goddamn bad, huh?

414
00:35:33,262 --> 00:35:36,364
With what, them little lady
tweezers you got there?

415
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:38,834
Lady tweezers?
That's what the hell I got--

416
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:42,136
Shut up, you ugly ape! Uh,
good morning, Mr. Goldstein.

417
00:35:42,204 --> 00:35:44,138
Morning, Popeye.

418
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:46,207
What time is it?

419
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:49,143
- Time to go to work.
- Sure is!

420
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:54,349
- Like a whole lot of...
- Hey! No cuts!

421
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:56,318
Ladies first, huh?

422
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:02,457
You know you're just a
girl underneath all that.

423
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:05,026
Shut your ass up.
You a little boy.

424
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,236
Okay, so that's, uh--

425
00:36:15,304 --> 00:36:18,340
- One dollar and 50 cents.
- One dollar and 50 cents. Very good.

426
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,575
Okay.

427
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:29,718
Aw, damn, baby girl.
Come on. Hurry up, now.

428
00:36:29,786 --> 00:36:32,020
She can take her time.

429
00:36:39,294 --> 00:36:40,996
So, that do it then, Bee?

430
00:36:41,163 --> 00:36:43,999
<i>- Yeah, I think so.</i>

431
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:46,501
All right.
Thank you very much, Bee.

432
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:48,737
I will see you in the morning.

433
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:52,841
Good Lord willing and the creek don't
rise, I'll see you in the morning too.

434
00:36:54,077 --> 00:36:55,943
Uh, okay.

435
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,047
Next.

436
00:37:01,717 --> 00:37:04,352
There you go. Uh-huh.

437
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,921
Popeye.

438
00:37:06,055 --> 00:37:08,289
Molly Pitcher's Muscatel, baby.

439
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:16,097
Goldfish are so delicious.

440
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,033
Only in here though.

441
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:22,804
Sometimes I'll take 'em home in my pocket and
eat 'em, but they didn't taste good like this.

442
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,940
Know why they
call 'em Goldfish?

443
00:37:26,008 --> 00:37:27,942
'Cause long ago boys
in college fraternities,

444
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:31,012
they'd eat real, live, swimmin'
goldfish with scary eyes...

445
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:34,048
on a dare--
a double dog dare.

446
00:37:34,116 --> 00:37:37,986
And they'd have to do it, or else
they'd be killed by their teachers.

447
00:37:38,054 --> 00:37:42,624
We can eat Goldfish, too, except they aren't
alive and they're pretty good for ya.

448
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:44,559
Like some?

449
00:37:44,627 --> 00:37:48,430
That's sweet, little girl, but I don't eat that shit.
It makes the scotch taste funny.

450
00:37:48,497 --> 00:37:52,534
Dolly, ain't you got
no Tony Tiger or Colonel Crunch?

451
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:56,371
This little girl 'bout to bust a gut
fuckin' with these 'plorable things.

452
00:38:01,744 --> 00:38:04,279
I eat the head first.

453
00:38:04,346 --> 00:38:05,881
Why, you ask?

454
00:38:05,948 --> 00:38:08,182
So they don't bite ya.

455
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,018
It's kinda sad though,

456
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:12,420
leave a pile of tails and all.

457
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:16,657
Did you know goldfish
can eat themselves to death?

458
00:38:16,725 --> 00:38:19,094
It's true, it's true!
I wouldn't lie.

459
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:22,296
If you feed 'em enough, they'll
eat and eat until they explode.

460
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:24,298
For real!

461
00:38:24,366 --> 00:38:28,737
I'd like to see that, even though
it would be real sad though.

462
00:38:28,804 --> 00:38:32,874
Here.
Two packs of Valiants, lady.

463
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:50,925
He's a bad boy.

464
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:15,083
<i>Never called nobody father.</i>

465
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:17,351
<i>Why bother?</i>

466
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:19,420
<i>When you left...</i>

467
00:39:19,488 --> 00:39:22,123
<i>you took God with you.</i>

468
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:26,594
<i>Never met no preacher
who wasn't tryin' to reach her,</i>

469
00:39:26,662 --> 00:39:30,264
<i>sellin' heaven,
takin' your sin...</i>

470
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:32,133
<i>home with him.</i>

471
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,371
<i>Saw some funny hats though...</i>

472
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,842
<i>when they made the new pope,</i>

473
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,011
<i>giving the sheep hope.</i>

474
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:47,782
<i>Never called nobody father.</i>

475
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:50,385
<i>Why bother?</i>

476
00:39:50,452 --> 00:39:52,587
<i>Ain't no reverends.</i>

477
00:39:52,654 --> 00:39:55,256
<i>Anyway, revered ones...</i>

478
00:39:56,592 --> 00:39:58,592
<i>pimpin' the little ones...</i>

479
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,895
<i>who need God to be true.</i>

480
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:03,230
<i>Ain't no end
to what they'll do.</i>

481
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:09,470
<i>When you leave,
take God with you.</i>

482
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:41,302
Agnes, it's not funny!
You scared the shit out of me!

483
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:43,938
I thought you was a car
or something!

484
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:47,241
That's what you get for hanging out at
this spooky house. It's got spooks in it.

485
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:50,946
You liked to gave me
a heart attack.

486
00:40:51,013 --> 00:40:54,616
<i>A heart attack?
You're 12, Einstein.</i>

487
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:56,617
Yeah, but...

488
00:40:56,685 --> 00:40:58,686
people have been
scared to death...

489
00:40:58,821 --> 00:41:00,387
by fear!

490
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:03,792
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Okay, I'm sorry.

491
00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:10,297
Go on now. The coast is clear.
Ain't nobody up at home.

492
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:12,233
Cry-baby.

493
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,435
It's not funny, Agnes!
It's not funny at all!

494
00:41:14,503 --> 00:41:17,973
You could've been a truck or a bus
or a tree branch or somethin'!

495
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,842
Well, what are you
waitin' for, a bus?

496
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:22,944
Go on now.

497
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,918
Not funny. Stop.

498
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:42,063
I'm sorry.
I love you. Bye.

499
00:41:43,932 --> 00:41:46,034
I love you too.

500
00:43:28,804 --> 00:43:32,673
News flash! I just made Bee poop in her
pants in front of the spooky house.

501
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:35,409
This is front-page stuff, people.
Get it while it's hot.

502
00:43:35,477 --> 00:43:37,979
Hi, Agnes!
Hey, Agnes!

503
00:43:38,046 --> 00:43:41,282
Rowena?
Hi, foxy lady.

504
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,785
Pinkish fuchsia!
Thank you!

505
00:43:43,852 --> 00:43:46,454
You got it.
Hey, Petey! Hey, Bob!

506
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:50,325
Spell it backwards. Spell it forward!
It spells the same thing-- Bob!

507
00:43:50,392 --> 00:43:54,362
- Mr. Jefferies, a legend in his own behind.
- I'm fine, just fine.

508
00:43:54,496 --> 00:43:56,965
Nice suit. You look
just like a Milk Dud.

509
00:43:57,032 --> 00:43:58,900
Well, thank you, honey!

510
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:00,701
What are you doing here,
Mr. Jefferies?

511
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:05,039
I've told you a thousand times.
You're a hundred. Go home.

512
00:44:05,107 --> 00:44:07,175
What are you, nuts?

513
00:44:07,242 --> 00:44:10,011
They need me here. I'm the
only one that knows stuff.

514
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,546
Give me that.

515
00:44:14,749 --> 00:44:18,519
Why do you think they
call me Mr. Everything?

516
00:44:18,587 --> 00:44:22,857
That's right. 'Cause I've
done every job in this room.

517
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:26,161
- Go ahead. Ask me somethin'.
- I'll ask you somethin'.

518
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:28,996
- Well, go ahead then. Shoot.
- Okay.

519
00:44:29,064 --> 00:44:31,632
Where's the man?

520
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,468
Bingo!

521
00:44:33,535 --> 00:44:36,838
He's at Command Central.
He's looking for Japs.

522
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:39,174
Thanks, Mr. Jefferies.

523
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,742
Anytime, kiddo.

524
00:44:43,412 --> 00:44:45,779
All right, let's have it.

525
00:44:45,848 --> 00:44:48,149
Hold your horses.
Gee.

526
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:55,089
"A", "A"...

527
00:44:55,157 --> 00:44:57,225
It's all A's.

528
00:44:57,293 --> 00:44:59,260
I guess we'll have to keep you.

529
00:44:59,328 --> 00:45:01,963
Ah, you can keep it.
I'll make more.

530
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,131
My dear wife reminded me
this morning...

531
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,600
that you haven't been
by the house lately.

532
00:45:06,668 --> 00:45:10,671
Do you require a written invitation
to come back by for dinner?

533
00:45:10,739 --> 00:45:12,606
I guess I've been busy.

534
00:45:12,674 --> 00:45:16,511
I could come by the house, pick
you up one Saturday night.

535
00:45:16,578 --> 00:45:20,014
Wouldn't want to interfere with your
studies during the week, you know.

536
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:23,351
Well, I got basketball
and chores and stuff.

537
00:45:23,419 --> 00:45:26,220
- How are you faring with the Rimbaud?
- I like him.

538
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:28,356
I like that
e. e. cummings guy too.

539
00:45:28,423 --> 00:45:31,092
We got the same birthday.

540
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,562
Rimbaud's dead.

541
00:45:34,629 --> 00:45:36,697
Yes.
Yes, he is.

542
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:38,566
And he was a homo.

543
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:42,836
Is there anything else
I can assist you with?

544
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:45,240
Yeah. It's payday.
Pay me!

545
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,208
Right you are.
Payday it is.

546
00:45:47,276 --> 00:45:50,244
Go see Rowena in Accounting.

547
00:45:50,312 --> 00:45:52,246
You mean that desk right there?

548
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:54,348
Oh, protocol, Agnes.
Protocol!

549
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,350
Without rules of behavior,
the world's a--

550
00:45:56,418 --> 00:45:58,819
Yeah, this place
is crawling with anarchists.

551
00:45:58,887 --> 00:46:01,922
<i>You have been reading.
That's very good.</i>

552
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,425
Oh, pay the girl.
Criminies!

553
00:46:06,862 --> 00:46:09,029
Excuse me.
Is this Accounting?

554
00:46:09,098 --> 00:46:11,132
I guess!

555
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,600
- Could I have my paycheck?
- Yeah.

556
00:46:13,668 --> 00:46:15,669
Got that.

557
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:18,772
- Thank you.
- Okay.

558
00:47:21,336 --> 00:47:24,738
Right here. See, I got to have this.
Dizzy.

559
00:47:26,908 --> 00:47:28,775
Watch my bike.

560
00:47:35,317 --> 00:47:39,086
Jesus Christ! I said one more
time, and that was one more time!

561
00:47:39,154 --> 00:47:41,188
Hey, Pookie.

562
00:47:41,256 --> 00:47:44,158
Tell Rondell I'm here
to get my check.

563
00:47:44,226 --> 00:47:48,329
Y'all better quit!
I ain't playin' with you.

564
00:47:48,397 --> 00:47:51,098
Rondell, Agnes need her check.

565
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:53,734
- How's the baby?
- Fine, I guess.

566
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:56,303
What's her name again?
I call her Tamika.

567
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:58,573
She call her Shandra.

568
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,576
Ah, Pookie. You gonna be all right?
I'll be fine, I guess.

569
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:05,379
I swear for God!

570
00:48:07,716 --> 00:48:09,683
Hey!
Hey! Come on!

571
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:12,819
Get away from him.
Stop jabbin' with him.

572
00:48:29,637 --> 00:48:32,940
Hey, Agnes.
You wanna work tonight?

573
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:34,875
Semifinals.

574
00:48:36,345 --> 00:48:40,448
I got a game tonight. The most
important game of my career.

575
00:48:40,516 --> 00:48:43,351
Well, if you change
your mind, let me know.

576
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:45,586
That's it!
I'm writin' you all up!

577
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:50,124
Told you that?
Yeah, right here.

578
00:48:50,191 --> 00:48:52,593
Give me my bike. Damn!

579
00:48:54,396 --> 00:48:56,364
Got you, man.
She's crazy, man.

580
00:48:59,434 --> 00:49:02,036
I got a 427 under there.
You ain't got no 427.

581
00:49:02,103 --> 00:49:05,739
That's a 287, man. I'll tell
you right now. It's a 287.

582
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:12,747
<i>Then Alice became convinced...</i>

583
00:49:12,814 --> 00:49:16,150
<i>that the baby
Julia's carrying... is mine.</i>

584
00:49:16,218 --> 00:49:20,020
How can it be his brother's
baby when Eden loves Dax?

585
00:49:20,088 --> 00:49:23,057
<i>She told Julia and me she
didn't ever want to see us again.</i>

586
00:49:23,124 --> 00:49:25,859
Don't this little
girl live in the Poker House?

587
00:49:25,994 --> 00:49:28,062
Little girl, don't you
live in the Poker House?

588
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:31,432
Stymie, it's lunchtime. Leave her alone.
You know that's her favorite story.

589
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,167
Lunchtime? I'm gonna
tell you what time it is!

590
00:49:33,302 --> 00:49:36,637
Time for you to fix me another drink!
That's what time it is!

591
00:49:36,705 --> 00:49:39,440
Soothing even the worst parting.

592
00:49:39,508 --> 00:49:41,676
How can you have a baby
by one person...

593
00:49:41,743 --> 00:49:43,811
when someone else loves ya?

594
00:49:46,448 --> 00:49:49,584
Baby, those TV people
ain't real.

595
00:49:49,651 --> 00:49:52,886
Go on and eat now.
And something else.

596
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:55,989
You know, how come every time
somebody says "I love you"...

597
00:49:56,057 --> 00:49:58,459
to somebody that
they really don't,

598
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,595
it's the opposite.

599
00:50:00,662 --> 00:50:03,264
They're just trying to be sneaky
about somethin' else.

600
00:50:03,331 --> 00:50:06,634
<i>Seems to me people who love each other--
they don't be havin' to say it.</i>

601
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:09,236
Like, if someone
were to say, out loud,

602
00:50:09,304 --> 00:50:11,672
"Ooh, I sure love my feet,"

603
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:15,376
well, of course you love your
feet, or you'd fall down.

604
00:50:15,444 --> 00:50:18,479
Cammie, honey,
don't trouble yourself.

605
00:50:18,547 --> 00:50:20,681
Have some more
cherry orange juice.

606
00:50:20,748 --> 00:50:24,051
No, I don't want no more juice.

607
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,690
I want somebody come get me.

608
00:50:43,572 --> 00:50:45,472
Come on.
Put that up there.

609
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:48,342
All right. Whoo!

610
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,580
Oh! He shoots,
and... he misses.

611
00:50:52,648 --> 00:50:54,948
Hey, yo, we got four, niggers.
We got four.

612
00:50:55,016 --> 00:50:57,785
- I'm Clyde. I'm Clyde, y'all.
- Dooey always gotta be Clyde.

613
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:00,854
Who you gonna be?

614
00:51:00,922 --> 00:51:03,457
- Nah. Give me back my ball, boy.
- Forget you, nigger.

615
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:06,260
- Try and take it.
- Guys, we got four. Deon, you on my team.

616
00:51:06,327 --> 00:51:08,562
- Dooey and Black Tony, y'all two together.
- All right.

617
00:51:09,431 --> 00:51:11,631
We jackin' y'all.
Oh-ho!

618
00:51:11,733 --> 00:51:14,134
Wait a minute.
What team are we?

619
00:51:14,202 --> 00:51:17,605
You said you was Clyde, so
that'd make you the Knicks?

620
00:51:17,672 --> 00:51:20,941
Hoo! You got munched, boy!

621
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:23,344
Forget all y'all!

622
00:51:23,411 --> 00:51:26,581
Yeah, we the Knicks.
We jackin' y'all up!

623
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:29,283
Shut up, Doo-Doo.
Agnes, who you supposed to be?

624
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:31,385
I'm George Gervin,
the Ice Man, man.

625
00:51:31,453 --> 00:51:33,688
All right. Cool.
I'm Dr. J.

626
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:37,658
Hold on. Y'all can't be
the Rockets and the Lakers.

627
00:51:37,726 --> 00:51:39,693
It's an All-Star game.

628
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:44,498
Yeah. Man, all right. Whatever.
Let's play.

629
00:51:44,566 --> 00:51:49,236
Okay. You take the ball out, then you pass the
ball to me, I'm gonna pass it back to you.

630
00:51:49,304 --> 00:51:52,105
Then I'm gonna do my stutter
step shake-and-bake move.

631
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:54,141
When I look at you, you hit me.

632
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:56,577
Then I drive right up the middle. A'ight.

633
00:51:56,645 --> 00:51:58,312
All right. Thanks.

634
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,881
All right.
Check!

635
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:02,683
Ball!

636
00:52:10,091 --> 00:52:12,159
Foul!

637
00:52:12,227 --> 00:52:14,595
Man, why you mess up the game?
Now we can't play!

638
00:52:14,663 --> 00:52:16,464
You fouled her, man.
You fouled her.

639
00:52:16,531 --> 00:52:18,766
Man, that wasn't even no foul!
That was legal!

640
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:21,234
Since when is
a titty check legal?

641
00:52:21,303 --> 00:52:24,839
Man, I was guarding George Gervin.
George Gervin ain't got no titties.

642
00:52:24,906 --> 00:52:27,240
Well, Agnes got titties,
so that's a foul!

643
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:29,276
Man, I was goin' for the ball.

644
00:52:29,344 --> 00:52:31,679
You was goin' for Agnes.

645
00:52:31,747 --> 00:52:33,681
Black Tony likes Agnes!

646
00:52:33,749 --> 00:52:35,716
- Oh, yeah?
- Titty boy.

647
00:52:35,784 --> 00:52:38,652
You think that's funny?
I titty-check your mama.

648
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:44,991
Y'all niggers fightin' for real! Who wanna be Muhammad Ali?
Who wanna be George Foreman?

649
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:46,927
Come on! Get in there!
I'm Joe Frazier!

650
00:52:46,994 --> 00:52:50,798
Joe Frazier? Ew.

651
00:52:50,865 --> 00:52:54,134
<i>Pay up, dog.</i>

652
00:52:54,202 --> 00:52:57,037
<i>Fuck that nigger!</i>

653
00:52:57,105 --> 00:52:58,906
<i>Ooh, man. They
got up and left!</i>

654
00:52:58,974 --> 00:53:01,375
Oh, man, see, that's--

655
00:53:01,443 --> 00:53:03,477
I ain't comin' in there, man.
Where you at?

656
00:53:03,545 --> 00:53:05,445
Come on, baby. Give me $10.

657
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:09,883
Here, girl. It's supposed
to fit like that.

658
00:53:11,419 --> 00:53:14,555
You heard what happened to La-La, right?
Fuck that heifer.

659
00:53:20,328 --> 00:53:22,563
Everybody in?

660
00:53:22,631 --> 00:53:25,966
You know the deal.
Five card.

661
00:53:26,033 --> 00:53:28,569
- Deuces low, aces high.
- One-eyed jacks wild?

662
00:53:30,438 --> 00:53:32,840
Motherfucker, did I say one-eyed
jacks is wild? Hell, no.

663
00:53:32,907 --> 00:53:36,343
- Damn, man. I'm just asking.
- Ask that tricky-ass bitch of yours over there.

664
00:53:36,411 --> 00:53:40,314
Maybe she know the rules. Ante up, fool.
You holdin' up the motherfuckin' game.

665
00:53:43,518 --> 00:53:45,553
Fuck me.

666
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,422
I can't win for losin'
in this motherfucker.

667
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:52,560
More for
me, and I ain't mad.

668
00:53:52,627 --> 00:53:54,961
I ain't mad at all.

669
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:57,665
- What it look like, man?
- Look like two ladies.

670
00:53:57,732 --> 00:54:00,267
You a thievin' bastard.

671
00:54:00,334 --> 00:54:01,935
Got you, man.

672
00:54:02,003 --> 00:54:04,004
How it go?

673
00:54:04,071 --> 00:54:07,908
- This is a man's world
- Aw, fuck you, man!

674
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:11,412
Don't nobody get three kings
in motherfuckin' five-card stud.

675
00:54:11,479 --> 00:54:13,280
You know that's some bullshit.

676
00:54:24,592 --> 00:54:27,094
I just did, nigger.

677
00:54:29,464 --> 00:54:32,032
My baby is a winner.

678
00:54:37,105 --> 00:54:39,473
Son of a bitch.

679
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,008
Come on, man.

680
00:54:42,076 --> 00:54:44,745
Fuck you, nigger.
I'm a winner.

681
00:54:44,813 --> 00:54:47,648
It's only a game.

682
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,655
On your feet, motherfucker!
Hey! Hey!

683
00:54:54,723 --> 00:54:58,358
That's my friend! You
don't know him! Ow!

684
00:55:10,538 --> 00:55:14,508
Got to learn to keep your hos in check, man.
Look at your trick.

685
00:55:14,575 --> 00:55:17,678
Oh! This is my song.

686
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:19,646
Come on.
Dance with me, baby.

687
00:55:19,714 --> 00:55:21,982
Ooh. I see somethin'
I like.

688
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,951
Hey.

689
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:28,855
I'm tellin' you, man. Yeah.
Makin' me some money.

690
00:55:28,923 --> 00:55:31,157
That's five dollars.

691
00:55:31,225 --> 00:55:33,527
I told La-La, "Don't go in
there messin' with Darryl."

692
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:35,595
She tellin' me
she can handle it.

693
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:37,798
She talkin' 'bout,
"I can handle it."

694
00:55:59,955 --> 00:56:02,589
Geez! Is it your life's ambition
to try to kill me?

695
00:56:02,657 --> 00:56:04,758
I'm trying to help you.

696
00:56:04,826 --> 00:56:06,793
Help me what?
See Jesus for real?

697
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:10,497
I'm trying to help you.

698
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:12,566
When did this shit start?

699
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:14,367
How old are we?

700
00:56:14,435 --> 00:56:16,302
Is it bad yet?

701
00:56:18,273 --> 00:56:20,774
Well, no.

702
00:56:22,877 --> 00:56:24,979
It's always bad.

703
00:56:26,814 --> 00:56:29,650
Don't you have band
practice or something?

704
00:56:29,717 --> 00:56:33,286
No, it's Monday. We don't have
band practice on Mondays.

705
00:56:33,354 --> 00:56:35,689
- We don't practice today
because it is Monday. - Monday.

706
00:56:35,757 --> 00:56:37,758
Go over to Kelly's house.

707
00:56:37,825 --> 00:56:40,460
But it's Monday.
I already told you that.

708
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,631
Bee, just get out of here.

709
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:48,301
Go over to Kelly's house and don't
come back for a while, okay?

710
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:50,904
Ow! Hey, you're not
doing that right.

711
00:56:56,244 --> 00:56:58,979
You gotta do it like this.

712
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:01,081
Very clever, grasshopper.

713
00:57:09,858 --> 00:57:11,892
My girl!

714
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:15,495
Hotel room, 15 minutes.

715
00:57:15,563 --> 00:57:17,864
We got 50 cans of beer.

716
00:57:33,815 --> 00:57:35,916
Where's my lighter?

717
00:57:46,761 --> 00:57:48,762
<i>No time ago...</i>

718
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,899
<i>or else a life,</i>

719
00:57:53,835 --> 00:57:56,803
<i>walking in the dark
I met Christ.</i>

720
00:58:00,842 --> 00:58:03,010
<i>Jesus.</i>

721
00:58:05,113 --> 00:58:07,380
<i>My heart flopped over
and lay still...</i>

722
00:58:07,448 --> 00:58:09,617
<i>as he passed.</i>

723
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:12,185
<i>As close as I am to you,</i>

724
00:58:12,253 --> 00:58:14,321
<i>yes, closer,</i>

725
00:58:17,592 --> 00:58:19,559
<i>made of nothing...</i>

726
00:58:21,462 --> 00:58:23,363
<i>except loneliness.</i>

727
00:58:23,431 --> 00:58:25,299
Fuck.

728
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:30,971
Where you been?
I been looking for you.

729
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,107
Don't start no shit.

730
00:58:33,174 --> 00:58:35,242
I knew you was bullshittin'. I knew it.

731
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:37,577
Okay. Let me
holler at you.

732
00:58:45,787 --> 00:58:48,822
- Come here, girl. Let me tell you something.
- I'm fine.

733
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:53,093
I know you're fine. I said I
wanna say something to you.

734
00:58:53,161 --> 00:58:55,929
Maurice, leave that child alone.

735
00:58:55,997 --> 00:58:58,398
She don't want you.

736
00:58:58,466 --> 00:59:02,069
- Agnes, you got another game tonight?
- Yeah.

737
00:59:02,137 --> 00:59:04,805
Little as you are, got
your picture in the paper.

738
00:59:04,872 --> 00:59:07,373
Her picture in the paper?
Sure is.

739
00:59:07,441 --> 00:59:11,178
- For what?
- She a famous basketball player.

740
00:59:11,246 --> 00:59:14,915
She a girl. And she a famous writer too.

741
00:59:14,982 --> 00:59:18,419
- I ain't famous.
- Your picture in the paper?

742
00:59:18,453 --> 00:59:21,955
- Yeah. - Then you famous.
What you doin' here?

743
00:59:23,324 --> 00:59:25,192
I live here.

744
00:59:26,327 --> 00:59:28,929
You live in the Poker House.

745
00:59:28,963 --> 00:59:31,064
I guess.

746
00:59:33,768 --> 00:59:35,635
That your mama?

747
00:59:42,343 --> 00:59:44,544
Go on and play basketball,
girl.

748
00:59:49,316 --> 00:59:51,785
Look at you, gettin'
all sentimental. Shit.

749
00:59:51,852 --> 00:59:55,889
- You got a fine ass. - Yeah? I'm over here.
What you gonna do with me?

750
00:59:55,957 --> 00:59:58,191
Hmm. I'm gonna get you
to light my fire.

751
01:00:05,366 --> 01:00:07,401
Where you think you goin'?

752
01:00:07,435 --> 01:00:09,369
Fishin'.

753
01:00:15,076 --> 01:00:17,411
Why you messin' with me,
little girl?

754
01:00:18,846 --> 01:00:22,949
Don't you know
I'm a bad, bad man?

755
01:00:24,352 --> 01:00:26,619
You know where I'm goin'.

756
01:00:26,687 --> 01:00:28,688
You ain't gotta go yet.

757
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,161
Yeah, I do.

758
01:00:34,229 --> 01:00:36,230
I gotta warm up the team.

759
01:00:36,297 --> 01:00:38,332
I gotta go over the plays...

760
01:00:38,399 --> 01:00:40,533
and talk to the coach
about--

761
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:42,635
Don't go just yet.

762
01:00:42,703 --> 01:00:46,473
<i>It was his lips that wrecked me.</i>

763
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:49,276
<i>The thick skin
over sweet custard.</i>

764
01:00:49,344 --> 01:00:52,045
<i>Like... Jell-O pudding...</i>

765
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:53,847
<i>left out on the table
all night.</i>

766
01:00:53,915 --> 01:00:56,649
<i>Sweet like that.</i>

767
01:00:56,717 --> 01:00:59,052
<i>Sweet like...</i>

768
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,554
<i>whiskey and Coke.</i>

769
01:01:01,622 --> 01:01:03,590
<i>Sweet like...</i>

770
01:01:03,657 --> 01:01:06,193
Mooney, why you keep
following me around the damn place?

771
01:01:06,261 --> 01:01:09,930
Everybody know you a hot
mama, but I ain't no jive-ass nigger.

772
01:01:09,997 --> 01:01:12,232
What is it you want, Mooney?

773
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,334
I want you to help me
move shit.

774
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:16,736
You can go places I can't go.
That's all you had to say.

775
01:01:16,804 --> 01:01:18,771
You got some merchandise.
Yeah. Take half.

776
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,741
Tell motherfuckers where you got it from.
I get half?

777
01:01:21,809 --> 01:01:24,644
Half, goddamn it.
Did I stutter?

778
01:01:24,712 --> 01:01:28,348
Well, shit, that's all you had to say.
You been mad all night.

779
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:31,218
You been playin' me like a
bald-headed stepchild. Shit.

780
01:01:31,286 --> 01:01:33,453
Can't I kid you?
Oh, we partners now, huh?

781
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,689
You don't trust me?
Hell, no.

782
01:01:37,758 --> 01:01:39,693
Well, come on.

783
01:01:57,879 --> 01:02:01,047
Hey, Duval. I'm busy, man.
Tell 'em to wait.

784
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:08,121
Too live.
That's what I told him.

785
01:02:24,305 --> 01:02:25,705
Fuck that shit.

786
01:02:25,773 --> 01:02:29,042
Ain't no motherfuckin' police
taking me no-goddamn-where.

787
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:33,880
Fuckin' La-La. Ain't gonna be gettin'
no visit from my ass no time soon.

788
01:02:33,948 --> 01:02:37,451
Come on, nigger. Take me to the club.
Oh, you ready now.

789
01:02:37,518 --> 01:02:39,752
Just come on.

790
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:55,535
<i>Who fills the air
with notes so sour...</i>

791
01:02:55,603 --> 01:02:58,605
<i>and dares to challenge
Sinbad's power?</i>

792
01:03:00,808 --> 01:03:03,910
<i>Why, I'll fix 'em.</i>

793
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:17,557
<i>Rush that ship!</i>

794
01:03:23,331 --> 01:03:25,332
<i>Go.</i>

795
01:03:45,786 --> 01:03:48,888
<i>Sweet...</i>

796
01:03:48,956 --> 01:03:51,558
<i>and soft.</i>

797
01:03:51,626 --> 01:03:54,160
<i>Not like the man
who beats my mom.</i>

798
01:03:57,398 --> 01:03:59,499
<i>The man that loves me,</i>

799
01:04:02,036 --> 01:04:04,737
<i>that kisses me like this.</i>

800
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:22,689
<i>How the fuck old was I?</i>

801
01:04:22,756 --> 01:04:24,724
<i>Thirteen?</i>

802
01:04:24,792 --> 01:04:26,826
<i>No, wait. It was winter.</i>

803
01:04:26,894 --> 01:04:29,563
<i>Fourteen, almost.</i>

804
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:31,531
<i>Just.</i>

805
01:04:39,873 --> 01:04:41,741
<i>A virgin.</i>

806
01:04:42,876 --> 01:04:45,278
<i>I don't know how old he was.</i>

807
01:04:45,346 --> 01:04:47,547
<i>Duval could've been a thousand.</i>

808
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:53,720
<i>Me, a sucker for his mouth.</i>

809
01:04:53,787 --> 01:04:55,655
<i>So sweet.</i>

810
01:04:57,191 --> 01:04:59,259
<i>But that day--</i>

811
01:05:01,596 --> 01:05:03,863
<i>Oh.</i>

812
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:07,767
<i>No. No.
What--</i>

813
01:05:07,835 --> 01:05:12,839
<i>Didn't I say, "Get the fuck off me,
motherfucker"?</i>

814
01:05:12,906 --> 01:05:15,509
<i>Didn't I? Did I?</i>

815
01:05:15,576 --> 01:05:18,512
<i>Get the fuck--
This isn't happening.</i>

816
01:05:22,316 --> 01:05:24,918
<i>This doesn't count.</i>

817
01:05:46,974 --> 01:05:49,376
<i>One thousand-one,</i>

818
01:05:50,511 --> 01:05:52,412
<i>one thousand-two,
Ow!</i>

819
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:57,216
<i>One thousand-three.</i>

820
01:05:57,285 --> 01:06:02,021
<i>And now I'm sure I got one of my mom's
pimp's babies growing inside of me.</i>

821
01:06:39,326 --> 01:06:41,360
Agnes?

822
01:06:48,102 --> 01:06:50,403
Yeah?

823
01:06:52,606 --> 01:06:54,707
What are you doin'?

824
01:06:56,243 --> 01:06:58,711
Nothing.

825
01:06:58,779 --> 01:07:00,680
Mom.

826
01:07:23,704 --> 01:07:25,605
Hey.

827
01:07:28,475 --> 01:07:31,444
<i>Run down to the store
right quick.</i>

828
01:07:32,747 --> 01:07:34,748
So we need some Newports...

829
01:07:34,882 --> 01:07:37,550
and a big bottle
of Tanqueray...

830
01:07:37,618 --> 01:07:40,853
and a Mr. T's
Bloody Mary mix.

831
01:07:42,056 --> 01:07:45,392
You know I can't drink it
with the vodka.

832
01:07:45,459 --> 01:07:47,660
Don't taste like nothin'.

833
01:07:49,129 --> 01:07:52,465
Why they even make somethin'
that don't taste like nothin'?

834
01:08:01,242 --> 01:08:03,142
This the end of the soap?

835
01:08:05,045 --> 01:08:06,680
You wasteful.

836
01:08:24,365 --> 01:08:27,834
I remember when you was a baby.

837
01:08:27,968 --> 01:08:30,470
All the time all you ever
wanted me to do...

838
01:08:30,538 --> 01:08:33,372
was... read to you.

839
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:36,842
And all we had was two books.

840
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:41,448
A red one. I don't remember
what it was called.

841
01:08:43,717 --> 01:08:46,285
Some other book
'bout rabbits...

842
01:08:46,353 --> 01:08:49,589
and chickens and some shit.

843
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:53,126
You weren't even walking yet.

844
01:08:54,928 --> 01:08:58,098
But you just all the time kept saying,

845
01:08:58,165 --> 01:09:00,199
"Read me the red book.

846
01:09:01,535 --> 01:09:03,937
Read me the red book."

847
01:09:05,172 --> 01:09:08,875
I read that book
must have been a million times.

848
01:09:09,009 --> 01:09:12,946
Got sick of it, for God's sake.

849
01:09:13,013 --> 01:09:17,149
Readin' the same
goddamn story...

850
01:09:17,217 --> 01:09:19,118
over and over.

851
01:09:21,054 --> 01:09:22,989
So--

852
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:24,924
I'd just...

853
01:09:26,059 --> 01:09:28,561
sit you on my lap,

854
01:09:32,666 --> 01:09:35,168
just turn the pages,

855
01:09:37,003 --> 01:09:39,038
make up some shit.

856
01:09:43,777 --> 01:09:46,579
Makin' up my own story.

857
01:09:48,315 --> 01:09:50,517
Pretending...

858
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:55,588
like I was readin' to you.

859
01:09:56,557 --> 01:09:58,924
You weren't even
a year old yet.

860
01:10:02,763 --> 01:10:04,864
But you'd just...

861
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:08,234
turn,

862
01:10:11,104 --> 01:10:13,138
look up at me and say,

863
01:10:14,775 --> 01:10:17,243
"Read the story."

864
01:10:21,348 --> 01:10:23,650
It used to freak me out,

865
01:10:24,618 --> 01:10:26,686
you speakin'
in full sentences...

866
01:10:26,754 --> 01:10:28,855
since you could talk.

867
01:10:31,592 --> 01:10:34,794
"Read the story."

868
01:10:39,165 --> 01:10:41,033
I tried to fool you,

869
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:45,839
but I never could
ever since you was a baby.

870
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:49,709
You always knew
what I was doin'.

871
01:10:55,616 --> 01:10:58,117
What was the name of that book?

872
01:11:03,424 --> 01:11:05,591
The red one.

873
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:07,694
You remember?

874
01:11:10,964 --> 01:11:13,032
Oh, fuck it.

875
01:11:14,702 --> 01:11:16,769
It don't matter.

876
01:11:18,372 --> 01:11:20,807
Get on to the store.

877
01:11:20,874 --> 01:11:23,376
If there's change, I want it.

878
01:12:08,822 --> 01:12:10,756
There's just today.

879
01:12:10,758 --> 01:12:12,992
And then there's tonight.

880
01:12:14,828 --> 01:12:17,096
Anything can happen.

881
01:12:18,999 --> 01:12:21,267
Then anything does.

882
01:12:23,637 --> 01:12:27,339
That's some valuable pussy.

883
01:12:27,407 --> 01:12:30,043
What?

884
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:33,813
Who are you talking about?

885
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:37,416
You said it was time for
her to earn her keep.

886
01:12:39,252 --> 01:12:41,787
I'm just being agreeable,
is all.

887
01:12:41,856 --> 01:12:43,856
You're just bein' about dead.

888
01:12:43,924 --> 01:12:48,594
Oh. Look at you.

889
01:12:48,662 --> 01:12:51,697
What are you gonna do
with that thing?

890
01:12:51,765 --> 01:12:56,435
Mom, this motherfucker
just raped me!

891
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:04,110
And now he wants
to pimp me out too?

892
01:13:04,178 --> 01:13:06,779
I don't know
what you're sayin'.

893
01:13:06,847 --> 01:13:08,848
He's fine to you.

894
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:11,117
He's good--
takes care of me.

895
01:13:11,251 --> 01:13:15,088
Did you fucking
just hear me?

896
01:13:17,591 --> 01:13:21,561
Stop where you're standin', or I'll
blow the back of your head off.

897
01:13:23,163 --> 01:13:28,568
Baby girl, cool it now.
Come on.

898
01:13:28,635 --> 01:13:32,638
You don't want to spend the rest
of your natural life behind bars.

899
01:13:32,706 --> 01:13:34,974
You don't wanna do that.

900
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:37,043
You think there's a cop
on this planet...

901
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:40,113
that would lock me up
for killing you?

902
01:13:42,282 --> 01:13:44,784
You... stop it!

903
01:13:44,852 --> 01:13:47,687
Stop it!

904
01:13:47,754 --> 01:13:50,356
I can't live without him.

905
01:13:52,325 --> 01:13:54,760
So...

906
01:13:54,828 --> 01:13:56,929
I can't, and I won't.

907
01:13:57,031 --> 01:14:00,399
So, you kill me.
You kill me.

908
01:14:05,305 --> 01:14:07,406
Mom!

909
01:14:07,474 --> 01:14:10,376
He raped me,

910
01:14:10,443 --> 01:14:13,412
and he beats you,

911
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,915
and he sells you!

912
01:14:15,982 --> 01:14:19,752
<i>And now he wants
to sell me too.</i>

913
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:22,956
<i>And you want to die
in his place?</i>

914
01:14:24,557 --> 01:14:27,026
Yes.

915
01:14:30,264 --> 01:14:32,131
Y-- Yes.

916
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:48,314
I'm going to
my basketball game.

917
01:14:51,618 --> 01:14:54,386
No. No. You get out!

918
01:14:54,454 --> 01:14:58,825
You get--
You get out of my house!

919
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,630
Wait, baby.

920
01:15:39,933 --> 01:15:42,301
Wait. Don't go!

921
01:16:04,591 --> 01:16:08,594
<i>I left... my mother...</i>

922
01:16:10,096 --> 01:16:12,665
<i>and the man
I thought loved me...</i>

923
01:16:12,732 --> 01:16:14,633
<i>in that house.</i>

924
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:19,205
<i>I left my mother...</i>

925
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,043
<i>and my... rapist...</i>

926
01:16:24,111 --> 01:16:26,279
<i>in that house.</i>

927
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:29,615
<i>I left my mother...</i>

928
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,985
<i>and my mother's pimp...</i>

929
01:16:33,052 --> 01:16:35,421
<i>in that house.</i>

930
01:16:35,489 --> 01:16:38,891
<i>Look at all the people it takes
to make up a person.</i>

931
01:16:42,428 --> 01:16:44,329
<i>Ain't that nothin'?</i>

932
01:17:56,036 --> 01:17:58,271
Where the sam hell
have you been?

933
01:17:58,338 --> 01:18:01,740
I've been to the mountaintop,
and it ain't shit.

934
01:18:01,808 --> 01:18:05,311
You good to play? We ain't got time
for no warming up, getting ready.

935
01:18:05,378 --> 01:18:08,214
Give me some bull crap
excuses after you blow it,

936
01:18:08,281 --> 01:18:10,249
comin' in late with a story.

937
01:18:10,317 --> 01:18:12,885
I'm not gonna blow it, Coach.
You know me.

938
01:18:12,952 --> 01:18:14,953
Ref! Time!

939
01:18:15,022 --> 01:18:17,490
Visitor time out.

940
01:18:17,557 --> 01:18:19,725
Ridgeview Lady Stars are down by 13.
Come on! Let's go! Huddle up!

941
01:18:19,793 --> 01:18:22,628
Just under seven minutes to go,

942
01:18:22,695 --> 01:18:24,696
it's Home 47, Visitors 34. Come on!
Let's go, ladies! Get in here!

943
01:18:24,764 --> 01:18:27,499
- This one is just about over.
- Come on!

944
01:18:27,567 --> 01:18:29,968
"A" Game here finally
decided to show up.

945
01:18:30,037 --> 01:18:32,404
Maybe she can wake the dead.

946
01:18:32,472 --> 01:18:34,940
Y'all are playin' pitiful!
We are down 13.

947
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:37,209
Win, or go home!

948
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:40,213
Missy, you've been gettin'
beat all night. Sit.

949
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,915
Agnes, prove me right.

950
01:18:42,983 --> 01:18:45,351
Nobody walks!
Team on three.

951
01:18:45,418 --> 01:18:47,452
One, two, three, team!
Team!

952
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:55,061
<i>There's the boy who writes
me poems and leaves them in my locker.</i>

953
01:18:55,128 --> 01:18:57,230
<i>He thinks I don't know.</i>

954
01:18:57,297 --> 01:18:59,398
<i>His name is Peter.</i>

955
01:19:02,402 --> 01:19:05,738
<i>There's the varsity football players that
won't talk to me if anyone's around,</i>

956
01:19:05,805 --> 01:19:08,941
<i>but Terry loves discussing
poetry at the Burger King...</i>

957
01:19:09,008 --> 01:19:11,944
<i>and I give Alfred
the math quiz answers.</i>

958
01:19:12,011 --> 01:19:15,614
<i>And Mario plays one-on-one with me in
the church parking lot any time I want.</i>

959
01:19:23,156 --> 01:19:26,892
Agnes! Agnes!
Agnes! Agnes!

960
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,861
Agnes! Agnes!

961
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,574
Two points, Ridgeview!

962
01:19:42,642 --> 01:19:44,510
Way to go!
Let's get it back now!

963
01:19:53,553 --> 01:19:56,422
Lady Stars grab two more.

964
01:20:02,962 --> 01:20:05,231
Ten to 14.

965
01:20:05,298 --> 01:20:07,299
And it's Agnes again!

966
01:20:11,237 --> 01:20:13,005
Number 14 takes a hard foul.

967
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:16,108
They need these free throws
to get back into the game...

968
01:20:16,176 --> 01:20:18,577
and have a chance
at the state championship.

969
01:20:22,215 --> 01:20:24,350
Okay, Agnes! You got these.
Knock 'em down!

970
01:20:29,055 --> 01:20:31,390
There's one.

971
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:33,292
Stay calm! Stay calm!

972
01:20:44,171 --> 01:20:47,639
And wow!
Ridgeview may have a prayer!

973
01:20:49,942 --> 01:20:51,810
Here come the Lady Stars.

974
01:20:51,878 --> 01:20:53,579
Two!

975
01:20:54,614 --> 01:20:57,782
And again!
Agnes really is lighting it up.

976
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,785
Number 14 is giving
this visiting team a shock.

977
01:20:59,852 --> 01:21:04,724
Down 58-54
with 44 seconds to play.

978
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,594
End-to-end layup
to tie the game.

979
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,798
It's tied up 60-60.

980
01:21:12,865 --> 01:21:15,434
All right! Good job!

981
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:18,437
Ridgeview crosses half court.

982
01:21:18,505 --> 01:21:21,140
Five seconds.
Four seconds left to play.

983
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:23,375
Agnes puts it up.

984
01:21:28,982 --> 01:21:30,815
And it's all net!

985
01:21:30,883 --> 01:21:35,254
Ridgeview is going
to the state championship!

986
01:21:35,389 --> 01:21:37,289
Good job! Come on.

987
01:21:39,925 --> 01:21:43,629
<i>I scored over
20 points in about seven minutes.</i>

988
01:21:43,763 --> 01:21:47,366
<i>That was a tristate
record for almost seven years...</i>

989
01:21:47,434 --> 01:21:50,636
<i>until some sophomore girl from this
school on the west side broke it.</i>

990
01:21:52,272 --> 01:21:54,373
<i>Good for her.</i>

991
01:24:10,744 --> 01:24:12,778
Get in the car, bitches!

992
01:24:21,688 --> 01:24:24,723
Where have y'all
knuckleheads been?

993
01:24:27,293 --> 01:24:29,061
I ate too much Goldfishes.

994
01:24:29,128 --> 01:24:31,796
- I think I'm gonna puke my guts.
- Ew.

995
01:24:31,864 --> 01:24:35,567
I went to Kelly's, then I went to the bar,

996
01:24:35,635 --> 01:24:39,204
which I know you said
to never go to.

997
01:24:39,272 --> 01:24:41,806
But... I found Cammie.
Yeah.

998
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:44,543
So I would say fine to
that to me, if I was you,

999
01:24:44,611 --> 01:24:47,045
because we was waiting
and waiting,

1000
01:24:47,113 --> 01:24:49,080
and then we started walking,
and it was so cold...

1001
01:24:49,182 --> 01:24:52,083
Shut up!

1002
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:55,320
Agnes, did you win your game today?
What game?

1003
01:24:55,388 --> 01:24:58,423
The basketball game!
Basketball game!

1004
01:24:58,491 --> 01:25:01,293
You had a game tonight,
and you didn't take me?

1005
01:25:01,361 --> 01:25:03,462
- Who won?
- We did, of course.

1006
01:25:03,529 --> 01:25:05,664
And hear me when I tell you,

1007
01:25:05,732 --> 01:25:09,034
I scored 27 points in
the second half alone.

1008
01:25:09,101 --> 01:25:10,936
Oh, my gosh!

1009
01:25:11,003 --> 01:25:13,906
Let's celebrate. Yeah!
We have to celebrate.

1010
01:25:13,973 --> 01:25:17,042
Drive the long way home, and
then we can go through the park.

1011
01:25:17,109 --> 01:25:19,878
Nah. I got
a better idea.

1012
01:25:19,946 --> 01:25:22,247
We're fixin' to have ourselves
some dinner, children.

1013
01:25:22,315 --> 01:25:25,317
Howard Johnson's!

1014
01:25:25,384 --> 01:25:27,986
Yes! Howard Johnson's!

1015
01:25:28,054 --> 01:25:30,789
But first we gotta go to Dolly's
and cash these paychecks.

1016
01:25:32,258 --> 01:25:34,727
Dolly's?

1017
01:25:34,794 --> 01:25:37,830
Oh, no. Oh, no, Agnes.
Seriously.

1018
01:25:37,897 --> 01:25:40,399
Can I please wait
in the car or something?

1019
01:25:40,466 --> 01:25:44,703
I'll die. I mean, I was already
there for, like, 800 hours today,

1020
01:25:44,771 --> 01:25:47,906
and I also think I ate
all of Dolly's cherries.

1021
01:25:47,974 --> 01:25:49,842
Yeah.

1022
01:26:02,054 --> 01:26:04,956
 Listen, baby

1023
01:26:05,024 --> 01:26:08,760
 Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low 

1024
01:26:08,828 --> 01:26:12,430
 Ain't no river wide enough
baby 

1025
01:26:12,499 --> 01:26:16,602
 If you need me, call me
no matter where you are 

1026
01:26:16,669 --> 01:26:18,604
 No matter how far

1027
01:26:18,671 --> 01:26:20,238
 Don't worry, baby

1028
01:26:20,306 --> 01:26:23,842
 Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry 

1029
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:25,878
 You don't have to worry

1030
01:26:25,945 --> 01:26:30,582
 'Cause, baby there ain't
no mountain high enough 

1031
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:33,752
 Ain't no valley low enough

1032
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:37,922
 Ain't no river wide enough

1033
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:41,092
 To keep me from gettin'
to you, babe 

1034
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:44,496
 Remember the day
I set you free 

1035
01:26:44,564 --> 01:26:48,166
 I told you you could always
count on me, darlin' 

1036
01:26:48,234 --> 01:26:51,570
 From that day on
I made a vow 

1037
01:26:51,638 --> 01:26:53,572
 I'll be there
when you want me 

1038
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,707
 Someway, somehow 

1039
01:26:55,775 --> 01:26:57,643
 'Cause, baby, there ain't...

1040
01:27:11,324 --> 01:27:14,626
 ...no mountain high enough 

1041
01:27:14,694 --> 01:27:18,063
 Ain't no valley low enough

1042
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:21,834
 Ain't no river wide enough

1043
01:27:21,901 --> 01:27:25,069
 To keep me from gettin'
to you, babe 

1044
01:27:26,673 --> 01:27:29,073
 Oh, no, darlin'

1045
01:27:29,141 --> 01:27:32,544
 No wind or rain

1046
01:27:32,612 --> 01:27:35,948
 Or winters cold

1047
01:27:36,082 --> 01:27:37,649
 Can't stop me, baby

1048
01:27:37,717 --> 01:27:39,484
 No, baby

1049
01:27:39,552 --> 01:27:41,219
 'Cause you are my love

1050
01:27:41,287 --> 01:27:43,822
 If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double 

1051
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:48,359
 Just send for me Oh, baby 
 Oh, baby

1052
01:27:48,428 --> 01:27:50,429
 My love is alive

1053
01:27:50,496 --> 01:27:52,798
 Way down in my heart

1054
01:27:52,866 --> 01:27:54,767
 Although we are miles apart

1055
01:27:54,834 --> 01:27:57,903
 If you ever need
a helping hand 

1056
01:27:57,971 --> 01:28:01,272
 I'll be there on the double
just as fast as I can 

1057
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:05,343
 Don't you know that there
ain't no mountain high enough 

1058
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:07,546
<i>I raced the
sun home in the morning...</i>

1059
01:28:07,614 --> 01:28:09,481
<i>and the moon up at night.</i>

1060
01:28:09,549 --> 01:28:13,051
<i>Anything can happen.</i>

1061
01:28:13,118 --> 01:28:15,854
<i>And anything does.</i>

1062
01:28:15,922 --> 01:28:18,757
<i>There's just today,
and then there's tonight.</i>

1063
01:28:18,825 --> 01:28:21,326
 There ain't no mountain
high enough 

1064
01:28:21,393 --> 01:28:23,395
<i>And tonight...</i>

1065
01:28:23,463 --> 01:28:25,330
<i>is wonderful.</i>

1066
01:28:25,398 --> 01:28:28,233
 Ain't no river wide enough

1067
01:28:28,301 --> 01:28:32,804
 To keep me from gettin'
to you, babe
