There ain't no one

take it easy on him?

but coddling your
little brother,

258

ain't gonna make him a Lambda.

him into a door will?

alright Clorissa?

- The abortion.
[jarring music plays]

283
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,160

that's just urban legend, right?

- Bullshit.

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,210
It was the scandal that
closed this place down.

performed here.

[saw blade whirs]
[Christine screams]

297
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:52,728
They performed an abortion
right then and there.

No consent necessary.

- Why would they do that?

I mean abortion's like the
biggest sin in Catholicism.

304
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,307
- Rumor has it the
child was Father Ryan's.

305
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,612
- That's fucked up.

306
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:10,180
- Did the church
punish Father Ryan?

307
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:13,096
- Hardly, Christine
busted into mass one day

308
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,491
and blew them away and
then torched'em one by one.

it was fucking beautiful.

310

- So she became like,
some serial nun killer?

311
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,936
- Well she claimed they
were the devil's disciples.

312
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,852
And thus began her 30 year
vacation in the nuthouse.

313
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,462
They say that Father
Ryan and the nuns

314

still haunt this building.

little exploring of our own?

should all stay together?

that hurt me.

940

961
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:54,163
- Perhaps, with another
virginal sacrifice

962
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:56,818
we might be able to
reverse the process

963
00:41:56,862 --> 00:41:59,647
and send the demons back.

964

expect to be

Do it.

1076
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:19,488
Do it.

1077
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:23,841
- I'm getting tired of this,
guys.

1078
00:47:23,884 --> 00:47:25,799
Where's the hot chicks?

1079
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,628
- Dammnit, what is
wrong with you?

1080
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,717
Do it

1081
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,284
or it will be you.

Devil worshipers.

1086
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:46,907
- I'm sorry.

1087
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:48,996

Hello.

Hello.

00:48:49,187 --> 00:48:49,970
Hello.

1101
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:56,411
Christine, it's the convent.

1102
00:48:56,455 --> 00:48:58,457
People are dying.

1103
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,111
You need to help us.

1104
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:02,330
Please.

1105
00:49:04,158 --> 00:49:04,942
Christine.

Christine.

1114
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,527
Hello?

1115
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:00,405
Hello?

1116
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:15,159
- Stay right there, kid.

1117
00:51:15,202 --> 00:51:16,638
I've got a pump action
Winchester leveled

1118
00:51:16,682 --> 00:51:17,857
at your chest.

1119
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,207
If you don't believe
me, take a step forward.

1120
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:21,513
- Are you her?

1121
00:51:21,556 --> 00:51:22,818
Are you Christine?

1122
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:23,645
- If you came to get acquainted,

1123
00:51:23,689 --> 00:51:25,125
you came to the wrong house.

1124
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:26,561
You came to talk
about the convent,

1125
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:27,823
start yapping.

1126
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:29,216
- My friends are in trouble.

1127
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,217
They're stuck in there.

1128
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:31,871
I think some of'em
maybe be dead.

1129
00:51:31,914 --> 00:51:32,698
- Goddamnit.

1130
00:51:33,786 --> 00:51:37,094
You kids broke in there,
didn't ya?

1131
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:39,226
Let me guess the rest
of the story.

1132
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,184
You and your friends went there

1133
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:41,924
to screw and smoke dope.

1134
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:43,361
When suddenly you
awoke the forces

1135
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:45,885
of evil and they started
killing everybody, right?

1136
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:46,929
- Well,

1137
00:51:46,973 --> 00:51:47,843
kind of.

1138
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:48,931
- Yeah, well,

1139
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:51,238
save your sob story

1140
00:51:51,282 --> 00:51:52,848
for someone who gives
a rat's ass.

1141
00:51:52,892 --> 00:51:53,893
- But don't you see,

1142
00:51:53,936 --> 00:51:55,764
you're the only one
who can help us.

1143
00:51:55,808 --> 00:51:57,418
- Oh yeah, right.

1144
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:59,159
Every five years or so
you stupid kids

1145
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:00,682
think it'd be great fun

1146
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:03,511
to break into the convent and
see where it all happened.

1147
00:52:03,555 --> 00:52:05,296
Then when all hell breaks loose,

1148
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,994
you come looking for the
chick who started it.

1149
00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:09,517
Well fuck that noise.

1150
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:10,605
I've had it.

1151
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:11,954
Not this time.

1152
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:14,479
I don't need to clean up
after everybody's mess.

1153
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:15,741
- But you have to help me,

1154
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:17,395
my boyfriend, he's one of them,

1155
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:19,701
and my brother's still inside.

1156
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:20,876
- Forget about'em, they're dead.

1157
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,356
- How do you know?

1158
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,792
- I know.

1159
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:26,491
The demons can only inhabit
recently deceased bodies.

1160
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:29,146
Once they take you over it's
too late, you're already dead.

1161
00:52:29,189 --> 00:52:31,452
- But my brother might
still be alive.

1162
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:33,672
- Not unless he's a virgin.

1163
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,937
He's not a virgin, is he?

1164
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,505
- What does that have to
do with anything?

1165
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:41,854
- Straight answer, is
he a virgin?

1166
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:42,985
- Yeah.

1167
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:46,206
- Oh shit, that is just
fucking great.

1168
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,077
He's a virgin, that's perfect.

1169
00:52:48,121 --> 00:52:49,340
- So?

1170
00:52:49,383 --> 00:52:51,342
- They fucking love virgins.

1171
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:54,519
Goddamn, demons, it' always
something with a virgin.

1172
00:52:54,562 --> 00:52:55,998
- What's happening?

1173
00:52:56,042 --> 00:52:58,000
- You kids have any idea
what you've done?

1174
00:52:58,044 --> 00:52:58,958
- No, what?

1175
00:53:00,655 --> 00:53:02,918
- Let me tell ya what really
happened 40 years ago.

1177
00:53:10,752 --> 00:53:13,190
Sister Camilla was the
first to see it

1178
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:14,669
In the garden was a little girl.

1181
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:23,548
Sister Camilla thought
she was another orphan.

1182
00:53:23,591 --> 00:53:25,463
She was the first one to get it.

1183
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:28,422
The first one to get the demon.

1184
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:32,165
[Sister Camilla screams]
[demon growls]

1185
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,080
It wasn't long before it spread.

1186
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:35,473
Sister Joan was next.

[cleaver thuds against flesh]

1188
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:38,302
Then it was Sister Abigail.

[demon growls]
[water splashes]

1190
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:44,786
And on down the line.

1191
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:45,874
Sister Kay.

1192
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:48,529
[Sister Kay screams]
[demons growl]

1193
00:53:48,573 --> 00:53:49,791

[nun screams]

1197
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,059
Until there was none left.

1198
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:59,584
The place had become the
devil's convent.

1199

00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,242

knew something was wrong.

[children mumble]

1203
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:20,866
I'd only been there a few weeks.

1204
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:23,085
I was eight months
pregnant and a runaway.

1205
00:54:23,129 --> 00:54:24,478
They took me in.

1206
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:34,183
From that day on, they
started acting weird.

1207
00:54:34,227 --> 00:54:35,272
Really weird.

1208
00:54:36,664 --> 00:54:40,494
[chalk scrapes against board]

1209
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:45,282

[demon gurgles]
[vomit splashes]

1214
00:55:05,998 --> 00:55:07,391
Then after all of that,

1215
00:55:07,434 --> 00:55:09,915
nothing could have prepared
me for what happened next.

1216
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:13,571
- Is that when they performed
the abortion on you?

1217
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:15,660
- That's just the urban legend.

1218
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,706
It's not what really happened.

1219
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,273
- What did happen?

1220
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:24,103
[thunder booms]

1221
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,541
- [Christine] I was
lying in my bed,

1222
00:55:27,585 --> 00:55:29,021
my baby started coming.

1223
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:32,241
[ominous music plays]

[Christine screams]

1226
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,217
Stop it.

1227
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,047
No.

1228
00:55:56,135 --> 00:55:57,092
They wheeled me into the chapel

1229
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:59,094
and started the process.

1230
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:01,183
- [Clorissa] What process?

1231
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:04,796
- [Christine] The process
of taking my baby.

1232
00:56:06,754 --> 00:56:08,016
- What did they do with it?

1233
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,104
- They were gonna use it

1234
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:12,064
for one of their
fucking sacrifices.

1235
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,025
You see, the virgin's
blood is powerful,

1236
00:56:17,069 --> 00:56:18,636
but a baby's blood,

1237
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,202
way more powerful.

1238
00:56:20,246 --> 00:56:22,509
- Why were they going
to sacrifice it?

1239
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:25,294
- His body was gonna be the
host for their new leader.

1240
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:27,514
The son of the devil.

1241
00:56:27,558 --> 00:56:30,430
Unfortunately for them,
I had a different plan.

1242
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:31,431
[gun fires]

1243
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,955
No one is gonna take my baby.

1244
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:34,956
[gun fires]
- That's why you went

1245
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,957
in with a shot them, right?

1246
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:37,132
- [Christine] Right.

1247
00:56:37,176 --> 00:56:38,177
Although small town legend
[gun fires]

1248
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,265
has it that I went crazy
[chamber clicks]

1249
00:56:39,308 --> 00:56:41,528
because they made me
have an abortion.

1250
00:56:41,572 --> 00:56:44,096
- So your baby, did it live?

1251
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:48,100
- Yeah, he's a civil
engineer in Peoria.

1252
00:56:48,143 --> 00:56:49,797
The point of the story is
if these fuckers

1253
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:51,146
get their hands on
