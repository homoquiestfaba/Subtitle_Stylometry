1
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,466
Dad!

2
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,466
ALBION
RENEWALS

3
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,166
You're not getting many, are you?

4
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,333
Five seconds.

5
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:19,800
-Cold?
-Hungry.

6
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,000
I know.

7
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,533
I know.

8
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:30,700
I'll take you back.

9
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,000
Who do you love most in all the world,
Jimmy?

10
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,700
You, Dad.

11
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,533
Always, Jimmy. Promise. Always.

12
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,666
I promise.

13
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,266
So we went back.

14
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,366
He told the police where to find us.

15
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,300
He said he wanted us
to spend some time together...

16
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,233
...to be together.

17
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,400
They put me in another children's home
and sent Dad back to prison.

18
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:40,566
We could have stayed there
more than those eight days.

19
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
I couldn't believe
I wrote down a son...

20
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,500
...which may seem flippant to you,
but it really was important to me.

21
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:26,800
Then walking across the street here,
I noticed--

22
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,700
How does your wife feel about it?

23
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,266
-My wife? No, I'm not married.
-Oh, I see.

24
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,433
Do you have to be married
to adopt a child?

25
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:36,800
No, but it's usual.

26
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,366
-It's usual, but it's not....
-Yes.

27
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,800
It's not obligatory.

28
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,600
-Oh, well....
-Yes. Right.

29
00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:45,433
Look, may I ask you
to take some of these leaflets?

30
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,333
They could be of help to you.

31
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,700
Do your neighbors know
about this ambition of yours?

32
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,500
I thought I'd wait until I'd reached
the stage of being taken seriously.

33
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:16,633
Does it matter to you
what they might think?

34
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,300
Well, they'll have to know.

35
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,400
If I'm successful,
they'll be the boy's neighbors too.

36
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:25,533
On a scale of one to 10,
what would you estimate...

37
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:29,066
...is your degree of security
with your masculine role?

38
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,033
Sorry?

39
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,033
Are you a "cuddler"
or a "touch-me-not"?

40
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:39,000
You do realize that as a single man,
you'll only be offered the older...

41
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:41,700
...most difficult to place,
emotionally disturbed boy?

42
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,166
Very well...

43
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,266
...the department will allot someone
to assess you...

44
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,433
...in your own home.

45
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:52,033
-Someone?
-Me probably.

46
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,466
We're a bit short-staffed
at the moment.

47
00:08:57,266 --> 00:09:00,433
My name is Graham John Holt.

48
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:03,133
I am a single man, aged 42...

49
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:06,733
...attempting to adopt
a 10-year-old boy.

50
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:09,666
And to this end, I have been asked
to write about myself...

51
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,133
...as honestly as possible.

52
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:15,333
Since my mother's death
18 months ago...

53
00:09:15,466 --> 00:09:19,033
...I have been postmaster
at this village sub-post office...

54
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,133
...where I have lived all my life.

55
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,566
The stroke my father suffered...

56
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,800
...has been made more complicated
by depression following Mother's death.

57
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,166
She was a local girl.

58
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,100
Dad came from the north.

59
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,666
They were a devoted couple...

60
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,133
...who had hardly spent a night away
from each other.

61
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:43,666
At 7:45, I take Dad's breakfast to him.

62
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,200
I usually try him
with a little conversation.

63
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:50,300
They said at the hospital I should
keep doing that and not give up.

64
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,600
If there is someone in the phone box
across the road...

65
00:09:55,733 --> 00:10:00,166
...I will name the person and speculate
on whom the call might be to.

66
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,633
He never replies.

67
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,000
Cornflakes.

68
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:18,266
Eight fifty-nine on the dot...

69
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,066
...I take up position
behind the reinforced counter screen.

70
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,266
No one has held me at gunpoint
as yet.

71
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,066
Good morning.

72
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:33,133
Lynn, my part-time helper...

73
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:35,666
...lives in a caravan
with her four children.

74
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:42,066
Is that a hot water bottle
under your coat, Elsie Needhan...

75
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:44,333
...or has that husband of yours...

76
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:46,733
...still not perfected
the art of safe sex?

77
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,133
Married bliss.

78
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:00,633
Doesn't it make you wanna throw up?

79
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:04,100
Hello, Edward.

80
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:06,266
How are you today?

81
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,733
Is there anything I can do
to make you more comfortable?

82
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,666
Does he know where he is?

83
00:11:26,066 --> 00:11:28,066
I have no idea.

84
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,566
Would I be right in thinking...

85
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,800
...that there's a fair amount of bitterness
between the two of you?

86
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,133
It depends on what you think constitutes
a fair amount.

87
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:38,300
I don't consider myself crippled by it.

88
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:41,166
Just a little touchy on the subject.

89
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,633
I hope the house isn't always
as tidy as this.

90
00:11:49,766 --> 00:11:53,100
Can I see it looking a bit more lived-in
next time?

91
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,166
I'm not from the Health and Safety
Inspectorate, you know.

92
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,600
And it is a 10-year-old boy
you're hoping to have living here.

93
00:12:00,766 --> 00:12:03,466
I'm not as young as you think,
by the way.

94
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,100
Nobody's allowed to do this job
until their balls have dropped.

95
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:08,633
Which reminds me...

96
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:10,800
...you need a support system.

97
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,166
Sorry?

98
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,400
One which the adoption panel
will consider viable.

99
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,500
Support means friends.

100
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:20,366
If you haven't got any, get some fast.

101
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,566
And kids,
you need experience with kids.

102
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,000
Babysitter, youth clubs...

103
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:30,066
...Boy Scouts, dib, dib, dib.

104
00:12:32,066 --> 00:12:34,400
What have we here?

105
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:36,700
It was my mother's.

106
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,200
-For hair clips.
-Have you ever had a girlfriend?

107
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,166
Elsie Bartlett.

108
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,333
What happened?

109
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:50,066
Well, we never seemed to find anything
to say to each other.

110
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,666
She married Champion,
the Wonder Horse.

111
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,466
-Lucky girl.
-No, that was--

112
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,400
That was his nickname
when we were at school.

113
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,700
I need to know what happened
to send you scuttling inside your shell.

114
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,700
I mean, for God's sake...

115
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,533
...what have you been doing with
yourself sexually since you were 15?

116
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:13,633
No more than what's usual I suppose
for a person of my age and background.

117
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:15,233
DIY.

118
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
If that's what you wanna call it.

119
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, why haven't you put yourself
about a bit?

120
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,566
Masturbation's so unfriendly, Grae.

121
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,733
Even in my busy schedule, I've managed
to fit in one good screw a fortnight.

122
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,600
I do have a small bit of news,
if you're interested.

123
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,366
So shall we open your life story book
at the "my third year" page?

124
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,033
-Tell me the news first.
-Will you talk to me...

125
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,533
-...about what's on that page?
-I thought you didn't approve of bribery.

126
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,000
Open the book please
and look at the page.

127
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,566
I'm looking.

128
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,800
Well, we think...

129
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,566
..we might have found the name
of your maternal grandparents.

130
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:25,233
Your mother's parents.

131
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,266
I do know what maternal means,
strange as it may seem.

132
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,533
Can I close the book now?

133
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,166
No. You still haven't said anything
about that page.

134
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,533
You want me to write their name in
and another few question marks?

135
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,466
Read me what's written on the page.

136
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,533
You're joking!

137
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,566
You don't face the past because that
would mean admitting what happened.

138
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:04,466
You're nowhere near being ready to start
a new life with a new family, are you?

139
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,366
-And who's gonna stop me?
-You are.

140
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:10,500
Do you know what I see
when I look at you?

141
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:13,166
I don't see a 10-year-old.

142
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,233
I see a little 6-year-old
who's just pissed his pants...

143
00:15:16,366 --> 00:15:18,233
...and is about to burst into tears...

144
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:23,300
...so that everyone around him will say,
"Oh, shame, poor little Jamie."

145
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:31,200
You said this news came directly
from the horse's mouth.

146
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,766
From a new social worker
at the prison.

147
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:37,466
He's managed to convince your father
that if he's willing...

148
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,200
...to give his blessing
to you being adopted...

149
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:43,566
...he can't object any longer to you
knowing your mother's name...

150
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,533
...which was Connolly.

151
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:49,633
Mary Connolly.

152
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:50,800
Maiden name.

153
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,133
Look, would it be possible for you
to bring those expressive eyes...

154
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:58,500
...round this way so that I get
the pleasure of them for a minute?

155
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,033
Would you like to write her name
in your life story book?

156
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,233
Go on.

157
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,600
"This is a drawing...

158
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:42,666
...I did from memory of the house...

159
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,100
...where my parents lived...

160
00:16:46,233 --> 00:16:52,633
...when I was born.

161
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:59,200
It has five windows...

162
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,766
...at the front.

163
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,000
Catch the cushion.

164
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:06,266
The cushion is concentration.

165
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,266
Margery!

166
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,233
-Yes?
-The cushion is attention.

167
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,566
Will to succeed. Now, shout out
your own name and throw the cushion...

168
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,200
-...to someone else.
-Tina.

169
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,533
-Graham!
-Margery!

170
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,166
I hate this kind of thing.

171
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,766
Can't hear you, Janet.

172
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:29,200
She'll be wearing pink pajamas
When she comes

173
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:33,133
She'll be wearing pink pajamas
When she comes

174
00:17:33,266 --> 00:17:35,300
She'll be wearing pink pajamas

175
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,000
Wearing pink pajamas

176
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:41,166
Wearing pink pajamas
When she comes

177
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,733
Any children who might....

178
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,700
I say, might come your way...

179
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,566
...will almost certainly
have been picked on.

180
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,266
Before these sessions are through,
every one of you...

181
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,300
...will have been given the opportunity
to know just what that feels like.

182
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:28,433
Now, sometimes you have a child
of 9 or 10...

183
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:32,666
...who's stuck emotionally at 2 or 3
because he may have been caught up...

184
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,466
...in social services' favorite game,
Pass the Parcel.

185
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,300
All right. So you can accept the idea
of a child...

186
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,733
...being emotionally stuck as an idea...

187
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,666
...but can you cope
with a healthy-looking 10-year-old...

188
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,733
...who's wetting, soiling,
crying, biting one minute...

189
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:54,066
...and giggling manically the next?

190
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:56,400
Empathize.

191
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:59,000
Feel as the child feels.

192
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:03,033
Remember, the idea of permanence
is too frightening for some children.

193
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,333
Like stepping into the unknown.
They've never, ever experienced it.

194
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:16,266
Always lose one.

195
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:20,233
In fact, we've lost four.

196
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:22,266
But not you?

197
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:25,466
No second thoughts?

198
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:29,100
-You still like children?
-Very much.

199
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:31,733
I'm not sure I could eat a whole one.

200
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:38,433
I've sent someone to find him.

201
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:42,700
Don't expect too much, will you?

202
00:19:57,766 --> 00:19:58,800
If you agree...

203
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,266
...I'd like to give you a proper home...

204
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:11,100
...and look after you.

205
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,100
I think it's time your life
was a bit easier...

206
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,700
...and a bit happier.

207
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,233
Do you understand?

208
00:20:28,566 --> 00:20:32,100
We could think of it
as a kind of partnership.

209
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:35,166
I want a son...

210
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,466
...and you need a....

211
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,766
What I mean is, you need somebody...

212
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:47,433
...some one person to care about you.

213
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:56,100
A partnership will only work
if it's what you want, James.

214
00:20:56,233 --> 00:20:58,133
Excuse me.

215
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,800
Who do you love most in all the world,
Jimmy?

216
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,133
You, Dad.

217
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,233
Always, Jimmy. Promise. Always.

218
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:45,366
Never break it. Pain of death.

219
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,766
I promise.

220
00:21:51,466 --> 00:21:54,466
I was beginning to think you'd....

221
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,066
What is it they say? Done a runner?

222
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:02,100
But you hadn't, had you?

223
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,366
Well, I didn't think you'd want more food
so I....

224
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
You didn't eat much.

225
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,800
Is that because you're as nervous
as I am?

226
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:24,366
I see.

227
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,066
I suppose that's it really, isn't it?

228
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:33,700
I've chosen you, but in order for it
to be an equal partnership...

229
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
...I'd have to be the person
you would choose.

230
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,533
You look after me
when I'm old and decrepit.

231
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:45,000
You do realize that's the only reason
I'm doing this, don't you?

232
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,666
What kept you so long in the toilet?

233
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,333
Can't you guess?

234
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,366
Thank you.

235
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,433
Courting?

236
00:23:01,766 --> 00:23:02,800
Are we?

237
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:05,800
Just a friend, Mrs. Hawkins.

238
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:10,433
You know you don't think standing there
in that clean white shirt fools anybody.

239
00:23:10,566 --> 00:23:14,533
Well, you ought to be out with company
and enjoying yourself.

240
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:16,666
It's only natural.

241
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,600
See you tomorrow, Mrs. Hawkins.

242
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:22,266
-Yes, I hope so.
-Watch your step.

243
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Oh, I'm very careful with steps,
you know.

244
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:30,500
It's a funny thing.
I fall down so much.

245
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:36,733
You haven't told them yet.

246
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,366
If you live in a village,
don't tell people things too early.

247
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,166
Cautious bugger.

248
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,233
I have to know....

249
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,133
Be sure it'll happen.

250
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,700
Nothing's for sure in this life, Grae.

251
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,333
Right now, you're not even a candidate
to adopt my stick insect.

252
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,633
-I want to know about your childhood.
-Well....

253
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,700
I have the reckoning up to do.
You know, it's fiddly work.

254
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,066
-I have to concentrate.
-I'll wait.

255
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:07,400
You'll have to bear with me.

256
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,233
Well....

257
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,166
There's not much to tell.

258
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:21,000
I had a spotlessly sanitized
childhood.

259
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:24,600
...with a change of Aertex
support systems every other day.

260
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,800
Leave the light relief to me, Grae.

261
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,233
Just the facts. Your mum and dad...

262
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:32,533
...from the point of view
of their only child.

263
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:41,266
They were always touching
each other.

264
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,733
I cannot remember when I first began
to notice the looks they exchanged...

265
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,700
...full of private meaning.

266
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:52,800
Or the constant touching.

267
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,433
Not that I lacked....
I mean, they touched me.

268
00:24:57,566 --> 00:25:01,333
Of course, they touched me too.
I don't think I lacked physical contact.

269
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,033
When?

270
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,600
-What?
-When did they touch you?

271
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,166
Whenever it was necessary.

272
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,566
Whenever they felt like it.

273
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:17,800
Not often then.

274
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,600
And as a teenager?

275
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:23,266
Not at all would be my guess.

276
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,366
I was rather a disappointment
to them.

277
00:25:31,366 --> 00:25:34,566
Even when I went disco dancing
on Saturday night....

278
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,766
He's polishing his brothel creepers.

279
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,666
They're just shoes, Dad.

280
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,066
He's a one, our Graham.

281
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,400
Isn't he a one, dear?

282
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:45,566
He's always been a one.

283
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,766
Let's have a look at you then.

284
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,600
He'll break a few hearts tonight.

285
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,633
I went. I didn't dance.

286
00:25:58,466 --> 00:26:01,800
My parents never understood
that one had to be part of a group.

287
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:05,633
Either a couple of opposite sexes...

288
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:09,333
...or a small group of the--
Of the same sex.

289
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,033
After a while, I stopped going inside
the disco. I did crosswords in the car...

290
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:17,233
...then endured a cross-examination
when I got home.

291
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:18,400
Hi, Mum. Dad.

292
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,033
Did you speak to anyone?

293
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:22,300
-Any nice girl?
-You could bring home to tea...

294
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:25,133
-...to meet your mum and dad?
-Did you enjoy yourself?

295
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:27,500
You're only young once.

296
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,466
When I was in my 30's,
my parents decided...

297
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,466
...that I'd missed my moment
so I was allowed to stop going...

298
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,600
...to town on Saturday nights.

299
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,733
And then she died?

300
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,233
You make it sound sudden.

301
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,533
It took five years.

302
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:52,566
I suppose I grew up during that time.

303
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,166
Rather a delayed growing.

304
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:04,333
I arranged the funeral
and Dad wasn't making much sense.

305
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:10,400
His hands were like injured birds
looking for a safe place to roost.

306
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:17,066
So I took her place...

307
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,100
...in the kitchen...

308
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,433
...behind the counter.

309
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:33,066
Mum and Dad had never seemed
separated from each other.

310
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
But he and I were separated.

311
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,266
Dad, please.

312
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,400
Please, don't.

313
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,033
It's all right, Dad.

314
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,233
You'll be all right.

315
00:28:07,266 --> 00:28:08,333
Come on.

316
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:10,500
Dad, I'm here.

317
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:26,133
Oh, it's a scrapbook really, isn't it?

318
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:29,566
Well, that's one way of describing it,
but for obvious reasons...

319
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,433
...we don't call what,
with a help from us...

320
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:36,533
...the children put together
about themselves scrapbooks.

321
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:42,200
No, no, mine's just a photograph album.

322
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:43,566
That's not even a scrapbook.

323
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,533
Who took the pictures?

324
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:46,766
My dad had a timer.

325
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:50,100
He'd set it and then run around
and join us.

326
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,166
This one's overexposed.

327
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,200
You look like three ghosts.

328
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,800
We were a very ordinary family.

329
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,100
I think it probably takes flair
and initiative to be a ghost.

330
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:10,033
You might have been ordinary once,
but you're not now.

331
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:20,433
Not many unmarried men
want to adopt.

332
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:25,466
Have you always lived
in the same house?

333
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:28,200
Afraid so.

334
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,200
And gone to the same school?

335
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:33,133
Two schools.
Primary and comprehensive.

336
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:35,300
I went to six schools so far.

337
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I would've thought you'd won a
scholarship to a private school.

338
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,500
No, I told you, no flair.

339
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,666
What sort of things did you do
when you were my age?

340
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,700
Well, I kept my head down, I suppose.

341
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,166
I told you, nothing very exciting.

342
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:56,733
Is what's in there exciting?

343
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,033
It's more disturbing than exciting.

344
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,666
That's what they say I am: disturbed.

345
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,033
What do you say?

346
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:25,066
I like this one.
It's you when you were my age.

347
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,166
You were on a beach.
You look like a right tearaway.

348
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:43,400
May I see it?

349
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:53,500
It was on holiday alone
with my father.

350
00:30:54,033 --> 00:30:57,700
It was the only time he and I
were ever alone for any length of time.

351
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,466
Only time he and I
were ever really close.

352
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:02,733
I'm sorry.

353
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:05,500
I had forgotten about the picture.

354
00:31:06,733 --> 00:31:09,200
I really am very sorry.

355
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,300
We laughed a lot that week.

356
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:16,800
I suppose it was the feeling...

357
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,566
...that we were doing something secret
and slightly wicked.

358
00:31:20,766 --> 00:31:22,566
I felt important...

359
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,766
...almost needed.

360
00:31:29,566 --> 00:31:31,066
Listen.

361
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:34,466
West Indian Sea.

362
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,000
We'll take it home
to remind us of the fun we had.

363
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:48,533
It was the best time of my life.

364
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:51,433
It was the happiest I've ever been.

365
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:10,033
-I cried.
-So I heard.

366
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,366
Isn't it usual to phone
before you visit?

367
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,733
Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.

368
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:21,100
I like to catch people unawares.

369
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:26,633
-Anyway, there's no point now.
-Why?

370
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:28,700
I told you.

371
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:34,366
I cried in front of the child
I was hoping to adopt, and his--

372
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,000
And his-- What's it called?
His key worker.

373
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:38,633
Best thing you could've done.

374
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:41,400
Now, they're both crazy about you...

375
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:43,566
...which they certainly weren't before.

376
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,700
Better start getting yourself prepared
for a weekend visit.

377
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:55,666
It's been suggested
that I put you in a home.

378
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:04,000
They say that if I'm right
about what you feel for me...

379
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:07,300
...if you can still feel emotions,
and I don't know, Dad.

380
00:33:07,433 --> 00:33:11,066
See, I just don't know, but if you can...

381
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,000
...the sense of being beholden to me...

382
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:19,233
...must be very painful for you.

383
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:25,333
I just can't be sure about any of this,
can I?

384
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:31,500
I dearly wish you had some way
of giving me your opinion.

385
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,533
I will get your breakfast.

386
00:34:04,366 --> 00:34:06,266
Can I have a word?

387
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:11,633
His father's had another stroke
and been taken to the hospital.

388
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:15,266
I guess your first visit is gonna be
delayed for a couple of weeks.

389
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,433
Wait! Wait!

390
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:55,066
I am waiting. We stopped.

391
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,600
We're here.

392
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:04,366
-Stage fright?
-If you like.

393
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,033
I've been here before.

394
00:35:06,466 --> 00:35:07,800
I know.

395
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,466
But this is important, Jimbo.

396
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,000
And I think it's what you want.

397
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,200
Look, he's there waiting for you.

398
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,233
Get out of the car.

399
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:26,600
I'll be back to collect you after tea.

400
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,366
Hello.

401
00:35:38,366 --> 00:35:39,666
Hello.

402
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,633
First off, I thought we'd look around,
get used to the geography.

403
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:48,533
In there is my house, but....

404
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,333
On this side is the post office.

405
00:35:53,466 --> 00:35:54,666
All right. It's okay. Bye.

406
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,200
Hello, Mrs. George.

407
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,200
Thank you.

408
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:04,066
This is Lynn, my helper.

409
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,666
Lynn, James.

410
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,333
Hello.

411
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,333
We'll go into the house now.

412
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,200
It's not very big.

413
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,166
Living room.

414
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,333
I thought we'd have tea in here today,
though the kitchen's more usual.

415
00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:25,166
Living room, said that.

416
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,433
And kitchen.

417
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:32,166
You'll be seeing quite a lot of that.
Then we can go upstairs.

418
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,033
There might be something upstairs
that would interest you.

419
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:39,400
Watch your step.

420
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,533
It's your room.

421
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,533
Where is your father?

422
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,033
He got sicker
and needed to be somewhere...

423
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,366
...where they could give him
proper medical care.

424
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:57,666
In a hospital?

425
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:02,666
Well, yes. Hospital, yes.

426
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:05,533
Was he sent there because of me?

427
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,100
Would they let me come here
if he hadn't been put away?

428
00:38:13,566 --> 00:38:15,366
Possibly not.

429
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,500
Though the number of single men
who apply to adopt...

430
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:21,300
...can be counted
on the fingers of one foot.

431
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,700
You only have to look
across this table...

432
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,700
...to see they must be scraping
the bottom of the barrel.

433
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:29,266
Overdone it, haven't I?

434
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,333
You know, they call this
the honeymoon period.

435
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,400
Paper hats?

436
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,200
No.

437
00:38:44,266 --> 00:38:45,733
Perhaps not.

438
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:51,200
Have you thought yet
what you'd like to call me?

439
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,600
I thought Graham would be best
if you feel you can manage that.

440
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:08,500
-There is a chance.
-Yeah, but look, don't raise your hopes.

441
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:12,566
Round and round the garden
Like a teddy bear

442
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:22,600
Round and round the garden
Like a teddy bear

443
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:26,566
One step, two step
Tickle you under there

444
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,266
-It's not my fault. It's your own fault.
-When do you see him?

445
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,366
-When do you spend time with him?
-I see him as often as I can.

446
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:55,000
Maureen, I'm Graham Holt.

447
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,733
Well, James has decided--

448
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:01,466
Elected to remain in the car.

449
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,466
We've had a bit of a row, see.

450
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,033
I don't think he wants me poking
in his past even under his supervision.

451
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:10,400
Supervision he's now withholding
by sulking in the car, right?

452
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,333
Always difficult to know
what to do for the best, isn't it?

453
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:17,666
-Always.
-You were his key worker?

454
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,400
His housemother.

455
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,400
-Ever mention his real mother?
-No.

456
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:31,333
I've been warned not to ask
about her yet.

457
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:34,133
Or ever, would be my advice.

458
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:37,500
Tell you about the day I had him
pinned to the floor, screaming?

459
00:40:37,633 --> 00:40:39,300
He spat. He bit.

460
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:43,433
If I'd been wearing makeup,
he probably would've done himself in.

461
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,800
Been told about his constant
running away?

462
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,333
Always hiding in dark holes.

463
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:50,700
He's attempted suicide twice.

464
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,633
Yes, I've been given all the details.

465
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,766
Over here!

466
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,333
Look at the state of him.

467
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,766
Get off! No! No!

468
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:23,400
Get off!

469
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,233
Tell him I'm hurt,
he wouldn't get out of the car...

470
00:41:35,366 --> 00:41:37,166
...after all we went through.

471
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,666
If he's allowing you
to stand in for his real dad...

472
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,466
...you must be special.

473
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,766
-Still in prison, I suppose?
-Yes.

474
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:49,266
Before everything's final...

475
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:51,466
...we'll be going to meet him.

476
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:55,100
And whose idea was that?

477
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:57,733
Well, James'.

478
00:41:58,033 --> 00:41:59,133
Thought it might be.

479
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,266
-But the social worker--
-Oh, yes.

480
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,700
How old is she, 14?

481
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:06,033
You're being used...

482
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,066
...by a manipulative little boy...

483
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,800
...who wants
to get another glimpse of his dad.

484
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,133
You'll never get to adopt him.
And believe me, you're well out of it.

485
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:19,200
The moment those two meet again,
you'll be out on your ear.

486
00:42:34,766 --> 00:42:36,366
How come you used to like her...

487
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,500
...when women tend
not to be your cup of tea?

488
00:42:39,733 --> 00:42:41,366
Perhaps she's a bit of a les.

489
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,000
-Sorry?
-Lesbian. Butch.

490
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:48,300
Wasn't she wearing leather and studs
like she hadn't slept for a week?

491
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,400
No. She was a bit untidy, I suppose,
but--

492
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:58,000
There you are then, aren't you?
Not a proper woman, that's what.

493
00:42:58,466 --> 00:43:01,166
What constitutes a proper woman
then?

494
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,600
Let me out!

495
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:08,733
Tits and silk and frills!

496
00:43:09,266 --> 00:43:10,500
Makeup that stinks!

497
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:14,266
And legs that shoot apart the minute
you touch them with your little finger!

498
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,266
Get off! Get off.

499
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:27,033
You could've turned the radio off,
you know, if it was bothering you.

500
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,266
Nothing bothers me.

501
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,466
It's your radio.

502
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,533
Slow down.

503
00:44:13,666 --> 00:44:18,066
Didn't they warn you
what being a substitute parent was like?

504
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:20,733
I suppose I need help.

505
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,066
Who doesn't?

506
00:44:39,266 --> 00:44:41,766
Honeymoon's over!

507
00:44:51,266 --> 00:44:54,800
It really is very good of you.
I was going to do it myself.

508
00:44:57,366 --> 00:45:01,233
Center of attraction
at Harvest Festival.

509
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,633
Geraniums, chrysanthemums.

510
00:45:03,766 --> 00:45:05,733
Michaelmas daisies.

511
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:08,466
It looks better now, look.
It looks better, doesn't it?

512
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,333
Be with you in a moment, please.

513
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,033
I've been given three opinions
so far of what should be done.

514
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:18,166
-Putting out a suggestion box.
-What were they?

515
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,800
None of them included fostering
with a view to adoption.

516
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,033
-Where is he now?
-Still in his room.

517
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,200
-You had his grandparents' address.
-Yes, but I can't let you have it.

518
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,000
They don't want to be known.

519
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:49,800
You said I had to see as many people
in his book as I could.

520
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,766
As many as will let you see them.

521
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:55,066
I need to know.
In time, he'll need to know.

522
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,200
When that time comes,
I'll need to be able to tell him.

523
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:02,500
Growing up, aren't you?

524
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:09,366
Remember,
he's your great-grandfather.

525
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,700
He doesn't know we're coming.

526
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:15,233
That would be him.

527
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,566
I'd better talk to him first,
and then call you.

528
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,066
She came here to stay, you know,
very often when she was a little girl.

529
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,333
I never saw your dad.

530
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:36,233
Just you. Just once.

531
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,333
Oh, you look just like her.

532
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:42,633
She used to write, regular.

533
00:47:42,766 --> 00:47:44,066
Never miss.

534
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,366
And I wrote back.

535
00:47:47,133 --> 00:47:48,666
Until....

536
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,600
Suddenly she wasn't known
at that address.

537
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,500
Oh, we were very close.

538
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:59,066
Always very close.

539
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,500
That time when she stopped writing...

540
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:04,566
...I needed someone to....

541
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,666
I blamed her.

542
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:16,166
I thought she didn't want
to be bothered.

543
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,700
There's things of hers...

544
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,200
...photos and such in a box
in that bureau.

545
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:26,266
You can look if you like.

546
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,433
Take what you want.

547
00:48:35,566 --> 00:48:37,433
Go and see if he's all right.

548
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:13,100
Never break it. Pain of death.

549
00:49:44,133 --> 00:49:45,366
Want the radio?

550
00:49:48,566 --> 00:49:50,333
You okay?

551
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,366
Can we see your father next weekend?

552
00:49:54,566 --> 00:49:56,400
If you like.

553
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,800
He could have another stroke
anytime now.

554
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,500
And it's most unlikely
he'll ever be allowed home.

555
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,300
Oh, well, I am sorry. It is bad news.

556
00:50:15,433 --> 00:50:17,500
And he doesn't seem too unhappy here
with us.

557
00:50:17,633 --> 00:50:19,500
No, no, it's hard to tell really...

558
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:23,000
...but it seems he's happy here
as he ever was at home.

559
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:39,666
I miss you so much.

560
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:46,666
We need a tent...

561
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,066
...a double and single sleeping bag
and cookery pans.

562
00:51:51,766 --> 00:51:53,600
What discount do you give for cash?

563
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:56,500
My Uncle Reuben
used to go camping a lot...

564
00:51:56,633 --> 00:52:01,066
...until his hernia made rubbing
little sticks together too painful.

565
00:52:04,366 --> 00:52:07,466
Time you started
being a bit more masterful, Grae.

566
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,733
I'm not gonna be around
to nursemaid you forever, you know?

567
00:52:11,033 --> 00:52:13,566
I'd better go see what he's buying.

568
00:52:15,066 --> 00:52:17,600
Grae, if he gets you practicing knots...

569
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:21,600
...just remember,
untying them again is the hard part.

570
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,800
It's good. Come in.

571
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,533
You are freezing.

572
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:44,433
-I'm not. Do you wanna come in?
-I don't wanna come in.

573
00:52:44,566 --> 00:52:46,066
-Why not?
-I'm cold right here.

574
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,266
Go on.

575
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,533
-I was getting frozen watching you.
-I don't.

576
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,733
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

577
00:52:53,066 --> 00:52:55,766
I thought you'd lose your temper
with me.

578
00:52:57,533 --> 00:53:01,566
Particularly over that muddle
with the lining. I've always been clumsy.

579
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:05,533
Everyone's got to learn.

580
00:53:07,266 --> 00:53:09,033
If you don't turn the sausage over...

581
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:12,000
...it'll be raw on one side
and burnt on the other.

582
00:53:16,366 --> 00:53:19,366
Funny, I've always thought
of tent people as being a bit odd.

583
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:25,400
Weird, even. Overgrown Boy Scouts
or leftover hippies.

584
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:27,433
Tent people aren't odd.

585
00:53:27,566 --> 00:53:29,400
You ought to learn survival.

586
00:53:29,533 --> 00:53:31,633
All sorts of things.

587
00:53:31,766 --> 00:53:33,700
Eat worms if you have to.

588
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:40,800
No. Really?

589
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,633
Then you get your night vision
and you can go on ahead.

590
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:46,600
You know a lot about it.

591
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:49,033
I had a good teacher.

592
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,266
There's a hole in the bottom of the sea

593
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,533
There's a hole in the bottom of the sea

594
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,300
There's a hole, there's a hole

595
00:54:02,433 --> 00:54:06,333
There's a hole in the bottom of the sea

596
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,500
If you'd waited,
we could all have gone together.

597
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,466
It was his school holidays.
I had to do something with him.

598
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,533
No fun for me having him
for a full week on my own.

599
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:33,000
Terrible room, horrible food...

600
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:36,033
...and do you know what's it's like
trying to keep him amused?

601
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:52,100
Were you cold?

602
00:55:54,766 --> 00:55:56,366
You talked in your sleep.

603
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,400
What did I say?

604
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:01,000
Nothing sensible.

605
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:03,166
Just words.

606
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,666
-What have you done to yourself?
-A branch hit me.

607
00:56:48,366 --> 00:56:51,500
It looks painful. Just missed your eye.

608
00:56:52,433 --> 00:56:54,800
Must have given you
a hell of a twang.

609
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,066
You go get the first aid kit from the tent
and put some antiseptic cream on it.

610
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,633
Kiss it better, please?

611
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:12,800
Do it properly.

612
00:57:14,466 --> 00:57:16,266
How's properly?

613
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,633
Longer. Harder.

614
00:57:17,766 --> 00:57:21,366
Got to be a long kiss to make it better.

615
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:39,500
Is that better?

616
00:57:44,466 --> 00:57:46,600
Do you love me?

617
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:51,300
Yes, very much.

618
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,433
Too much for my own good, I expect.

619
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:09,433
Were you testing me?

620
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:13,000
I do test people sometimes.

621
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:43,266
Now I know why the skylark sings
like she does.

622
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:49,033
-Where's the village?
-Village?

623
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,433
Over that hill.

624
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:57,333
The moon moves further away
from the Earth...

625
00:58:57,466 --> 00:59:00,033
...by about a foot every 20 years.

626
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:02,266
Was it something we said?

627
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:29,266
What does big brother Eddie say...

628
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,333
...about you interesting yourself
in little boys?

629
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:36,533
It's not a question of little boys,
Uncle Turpin, there's only one.

630
00:59:36,666 --> 00:59:41,266
Jamie came after Dad had his first stroke
so Dad couldn't voice an opinion.

631
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,266
You picked a right sulker.

632
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:54,333
I doubt even Everton Mints
could put a smile on that fizzog.

633
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,600
Jamie wanted to meet you.
He's catching up on my family.

634
00:59:57,733 --> 00:59:59,733
Is that right?

635
01:00:00,366 --> 01:00:02,533
I'm sorry I didn't get
to your mother's funeral.

636
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:04,233
I were a bit indisposed myself.

637
01:00:04,366 --> 01:00:06,200
You and she were never very close.

638
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:08,666
-I couldn't stand the woman.
-Why not?

639
01:00:11,133 --> 01:00:12,566
It speaks.

640
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,466
It not only utters,
it asks bloody, cheeky questions.

641
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,100
Seemed a fair question to me.

642
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,800
It was all that lovey-dovey stuff
that used to sicken me.

643
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,066
They were a devoted couple.
They showed it.

644
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,700
You mean she convinced him
that she'd go to pieces...

645
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,066
...if he strayed even as far as the end
of the garden to do a widdle on his own.

646
01:00:40,133 --> 01:00:41,333
Does this one cry?

647
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:43,566
-Not as far as I know.
-Pity.

648
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,800
I like watching little boys cry.

649
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,500
Kept me attending school regular,
did that.

650
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,533
Your grandma used to see me to the gate
with me dinner money on Monday...

651
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:55,733
...and she'd say to me,
"See how many you can upset...

652
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:59,066
...and don't be late home."

653
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,000
Hadn't you better forgive him...

654
01:01:04,266 --> 01:01:07,233
...before he dies on you
and it's too late.

655
01:01:08,633 --> 01:01:11,600
Always did reckon
you took after your mother...

656
01:01:11,733 --> 01:01:14,200
...even though I had her worked out
all wrong.

657
01:01:16,266 --> 01:01:19,233
It weren't her that didn't want kids.
It were him.

658
01:01:19,366 --> 01:01:20,533
Him.

659
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:23,700
Couldn't bring himself
to poke a fire properly.

660
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:28,533
Something to do with the war.
I don't know.

661
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,666
Well, that will be why
he was always a bit cool with you.

662
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,766
There's a log in the hole
In the bottom of the sea

663
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:41,600
There's a log in the hole
In the bottom of the sea

664
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,600
-There's a log, there's a log
-Log

665
01:01:46,733 --> 01:01:50,533
-There's a log in the bottom of the sea
-There's a log in the bottom of the sea

666
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:53,500
-There's a limb on the log...
-There's a limb on the log...

667
01:01:53,633 --> 01:01:56,000
-...in the hole in the bottom of sea
-...in the hole in the bottom of sea

668
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,100
Bags first pee!

669
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,733
I'll just give my bike a bit of an exercise,
okay?

670
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:38,466
Well, don't be long.
I'll put the kettle on.

671
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,200
Yeah!

672
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:31,100
--bottom of the sea
There's a hole in the bottom of the sea

673
01:04:34,733 --> 01:04:37,633
Take your breath.
Take a breath before you drink.

674
01:04:44,066 --> 01:04:46,066
I have a letter for you.

675
01:04:51,733 --> 01:04:53,366
From your father.

676
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,266
He wrote to me too.

677
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:08,700
He wished us luck.

678
01:05:12,566 --> 01:05:16,300
He referred to you as Jimmy.
I didn't think you liked to be called that.

679
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:46,666
And you want to read your letter
in private, I expect.

680
01:05:54,266 --> 01:05:55,800
Perhaps you're right.

681
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,366
Why not read it in your room?

682
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,366
I should be with you when you read it.

683
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,466
I know it's private, but if it upsets you,
I want to be close by.

684
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:13,400
Get out of my way, please.

685
01:06:48,066 --> 01:06:49,533
Dear Jimmy...

686
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:52,733
...they tell me that there is someone
who wishes to adopt you...

687
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:54,666
...and that they trust this man...

688
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,400
...and you seem to get on well
with him.

689
01:06:58,133 --> 01:07:02,100
In ideal world, Jimmy, my love,
we would be together.

690
01:07:02,233 --> 01:07:05,233
No one would stop me
from being your father.

691
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,300
Never show weakness, Jimmy.

692
01:07:09,433 --> 01:07:12,333
If people sense it,
they just take what they want from you.

693
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,566
Then they disappear.

694
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:27,800
Please, Jimmy, you must understand that
none of what's happened is your fault.

695
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:31,333
You're not to blame, Jimmy.
Please remember that.

696
01:07:31,466 --> 01:07:36,800
I'm the one at fault, the one who's failed
his most sacred duty to be a good father.

697
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:41,533
One day, when you're old enough
to understand what forgiveness is...

698
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:44,633
...I will need all you can spare.

699
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,100
I love you most. Always, Jimmy.

700
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:50,466
Promise, always.

701
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,533
Your father.

702
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,600
Will you come home now? It's late.

703
01:08:15,033 --> 01:08:16,466
Come inside.

704
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:20,533
-You cannot stay out here all night!
-Get off me!

705
01:08:21,366 --> 01:08:23,166
Get off!

706
01:08:23,366 --> 01:08:25,100
Anger scares me.

707
01:08:25,233 --> 01:08:29,133
It's an illness, and we don't have to
look far to see who I've caught it from.

708
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:51,166
Jealousy cripples people, Jamie.
It makes them behave badly.

709
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,733
But we can't allow everything to fall
apart because you've heard from your--

710
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,766
If I say I understand how you feel,
that's just words, because I don't know.

711
01:09:00,066 --> 01:09:03,233
I haven't read your letter,
but I want to understand what you feel.

712
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:07,133
I want to know what you think about
while you stand there watching me.

713
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,633
All I can say is, Jamie,
unless you can speak to me...

714
01:09:10,766 --> 01:09:15,200
...unless you say something, unless
you can share something, I don't know.

715
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,766
There is food if you're hungry.

716
01:09:24,066 --> 01:09:28,100
I could make you a sandwich.
Tea seems rather a long time ago.

717
01:09:28,233 --> 01:09:30,266
I have a father.

718
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:37,300
Just because he's in prison
doesn't make anyone else my father.

719
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,733
His letter doesn't say anything
about us going to see him in prison.

720
01:09:42,033 --> 01:09:43,800
You can't adopt me
unless I see him first.

721
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,166
You know that, don't you?

722
01:09:47,066 --> 01:09:50,233
I had realized that was part
of the bargain you were willing to make.

723
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,200
There is something more
in this adoption...

724
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:55,466
...than a visit to your father,
isn't there?

725
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:06,700
Are you sure you want me to read it?

726
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:11,100
Wouldn't it be best to wait
and think about it for a while?

727
01:10:11,233 --> 01:10:16,466
It's only fair you should understand
why you can't ever take his place.

728
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:38,266
Little boys are cheap today

729
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,033
Cheaper than yesterday

730
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:43,633
Smaller boys are....

731
01:13:08,433 --> 01:13:11,466
Why don't you ask for the butter
if you want it?

732
01:13:26,233 --> 01:13:28,200
That's enough of that.

733
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,400
Go to your room.

734
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,533
Well, he won't look at me.

735
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,266
He doesn't talk.

736
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,733
I've insisted he says thank you
and he says it to the ceiling...

737
01:14:03,033 --> 01:14:04,133
...or to the fireplace.

738
01:14:04,266 --> 01:14:07,766
And it's been going on
three weeks now.

739
01:14:08,133 --> 01:14:11,766
I don't know why he continues with the
visits. Every day I expect a phone call...

740
01:14:12,066 --> 01:14:14,366
...to say he decided
he doesn't want the adoption.

741
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,000
-Do you wanna go on with it?
-I suppose I must.

742
01:14:17,133 --> 01:14:20,233
Otherwise, I'd pull out myself.

743
01:14:20,366 --> 01:14:21,700
But you're not sure.

744
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:27,200
Well, everything was fine
until the letter.

745
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,400
What did the one you got say?

746
01:14:29,533 --> 01:14:31,133
Nothing.

747
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:33,100
And what did the one Jamie got say?

748
01:14:33,233 --> 01:14:35,500
Oh, everything.

749
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:42,000
It was very fair, very honest,
very loving...

750
01:14:42,133 --> 01:14:45,000
...devastatingly moving letter.

751
01:14:49,566 --> 01:14:51,466
You answer it.

752
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:55,200
Hello. Pileth Post Office.

753
01:14:58,566 --> 01:14:59,800
It's the hospital.

754
01:15:57,133 --> 01:16:00,066
My father died on Thursday morning.

755
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,700
So I may not be very good company.

756
01:16:07,766 --> 01:16:13,733
I wasn't sure whether to ask you
to give this weekend a miss.

757
01:16:17,433 --> 01:16:19,366
Perhaps I should have.

758
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,166
I'm sorry.

759
01:17:41,066 --> 01:17:42,600
You'll be all right.

760
01:17:42,733 --> 01:17:44,600
Promise.

761
01:17:53,733 --> 01:17:55,500
It won't be long.

762
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:28,666
I was always a disappointment to him.

763
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:31,700
I don't think so.

764
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:54,433
I never knew
what they really wanted of me.

765
01:18:57,433 --> 01:19:00,533
Was there never a time? Ever?

766
01:19:03,766 --> 01:19:07,200
Depends on what you mean
by "a time."

767
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,266
Didn't you ever love anyone?

768
01:19:13,533 --> 01:19:15,266
I don't know.

769
01:19:15,633 --> 01:19:17,066
Maybe.

770
01:19:20,633 --> 01:19:22,066
Hi.

771
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,600
Whatever it was,
she was right out of my class.

772
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:31,800
It would never have worked.

773
01:19:34,433 --> 01:19:36,600
Go to sleep now.

774
01:19:38,433 --> 01:19:40,466
I'll still be here.

775
01:19:49,766 --> 01:19:52,533
Whether adoption goes through or not
doesn't depend on me.

776
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:56,433
But in the meantime, James is coming
up for 11 and he'll be changing schools.

777
01:19:56,566 --> 01:19:59,366
And if you adopt him,
he'll be going to your local school.

778
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,433
Silly is making you start twice.

779
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,033
So we're recommending
that in the meantime...

780
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:07,600
...you should foster James
with a view to adoption.

781
01:20:08,766 --> 01:20:12,200
-Which means?
-He comes to live with you.

782
01:20:44,433 --> 01:20:46,600
Look, there's the new boy.

783
01:20:55,766 --> 01:20:59,400
Germ warfare.
That's why the Conservative lost.

784
01:20:59,533 --> 01:21:01,133
His name was Jeremy Anthrax.

785
01:21:01,266 --> 01:21:03,600
I'm so sorry,
I don't want to interrupt anyone.

786
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:05,600
I'm sure you have lots to talk about.

787
01:21:05,733 --> 01:21:08,133
Who'd want to vote for a name
that sounds like a cough sweet?

788
01:21:08,266 --> 01:21:09,800
I just happened to be
in a teensy bit of a hurry.

789
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,400
It's the dry cleaning, is it?

790
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:15,300
I believe I did tell you, Mrs. Hilliard,
the delivery's not till Thursday.

791
01:21:15,433 --> 01:21:17,633
Please don't apologize.
It's quite all right.

792
01:21:17,766 --> 01:21:20,200
When one's used to 24-hour service....

793
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:23,233
Well, I was going to look
at some knitting wool...

794
01:21:23,366 --> 01:21:26,366
-...but everybody's in a rush.
-Oh, Lizzie, look at the wool.

795
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,700
No, I don't wanna be an inconvenience.
I'll come back tomorrow.

796
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,300
Lizzie....

797
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:34,200
No, you haven't got the time for it.

798
01:21:36,233 --> 01:21:37,566
Hilliard.

799
01:21:38,533 --> 01:21:40,766
Hilliard, dry cleaning.

800
01:21:43,433 --> 01:21:45,466
Be with you in a moment.

801
01:21:56,433 --> 01:21:57,733
I'm Jimmy's father.

802
01:22:03,533 --> 01:22:05,766
You'd better come inside.

803
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:21,633
They've released you early?

804
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:25,266
It's just one less death certificate
to write out.

805
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,066
Where's Jimmy?

806
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,600
He's at school. He'll be back at 4:30.

807
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,600
Doing well there, is he?

808
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,533
Pretty well.

809
01:22:39,233 --> 01:22:41,666
Jimmy's been there only a month.

810
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,533
Trying to work out a way...

811
01:22:44,666 --> 01:22:47,300
...where I can get a look at him
without him seeing me.

812
01:22:51,266 --> 01:22:52,666
No.

813
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,266
Sorry?

814
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,133
It won't do. That's not the way.

815
01:22:59,133 --> 01:23:00,566
What...?

816
01:23:01,666 --> 01:23:03,433
What is it?

817
01:23:05,066 --> 01:23:06,100
It's AIDS.

818
01:23:11,066 --> 01:23:12,733
Do you mind waiting here
till lunchtime?

819
01:23:13,033 --> 01:23:14,600
I've got the shop to look after.

820
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,166
I've managed to keep Jimmy thinking
I've been in prison ever since.

821
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:28,766
You hid out in the woods?

822
01:23:29,066 --> 01:23:32,300
Yeah, but I've been in and out
three times since then.

823
01:23:33,266 --> 01:23:35,166
You know how it is.

824
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,133
Petty offenses, burglary,
nicking cars...

825
01:23:39,266 --> 01:23:42,333
...receiving drugs, you know,
that kind of thing.

826
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:47,766
I'd like to have seen him,
but it seemed fairer not to.

827
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:50,233
He thought you were
a mercenary soldier.

828
01:23:52,133 --> 01:23:54,366
Now, you'd like to know
how long they've given me.

829
01:23:55,266 --> 01:23:58,433
I've got four or five months.

830
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:01,700
Now, if I could just hang around
somewhere outside the village--

831
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,333
And in a year's time, when someone
has to tell him you're dead?

832
01:24:05,466 --> 01:24:08,033
If you were that selfish,
I'd tell him the truth.

833
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:10,466
I'd tell him you could come see him
but you didn't.

834
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,600
Make sure he recognize you,
meet the bus, point you out to him.

835
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:19,000
What does it feel like, eh?
Holding all the cards?

836
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,666
Now, here's what we'll do.

837
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,066
You'll move in here.

838
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,433
We'll tell Jamie what your illness is.

839
01:24:42,566 --> 01:24:45,600
We'll give its proper name
because he has the right to know...

840
01:24:46,433 --> 01:24:49,266
...that his father
has a few months to live.

841
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:54,466
The village doesn't have to know
though they may guess or find out.

842
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,766
Only the doctor has to know.

843
01:24:57,766 --> 01:25:00,733
The Hippocratic oath
should take care of him.

844
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:04,500
Are you always like this?

845
01:25:05,766 --> 01:25:08,400
No, never. I'm not the masterful type.

846
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,100
All right, kids.

847
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,633
You've got a broody expression
like a hen with constipation.

848
01:25:21,766 --> 01:25:24,466
Well, don't,
because I've got the remedy.

849
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,500
We're going camping this weekend.

850
01:25:26,633 --> 01:25:28,800
It'll be great.

851
01:25:31,533 --> 01:25:33,266
Not this weekend.

852
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,166
Why not?

853
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:40,766
We have a visitor.

854
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,100
We never have visitors.

855
01:26:16,533 --> 01:26:18,300
Hello, Jimmy.

856
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,766
Who do you love?

857
01:26:45,766 --> 01:26:47,800
Last time I saw you...

858
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:51,266
...I said the next time we meet
will be forever.

859
01:26:53,033 --> 01:26:55,700
There's nothing forever for me and you,
Jimmy.

860
01:26:56,700 --> 01:27:00,166
I came to find you,
to make sure you're all right.

861
01:27:00,766 --> 01:27:03,033
You're a credit to me, Jimmy.

862
01:27:03,166 --> 01:27:04,766
You're a grown man, almost.

863
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:09,466
Graham says I should be honest
with you about my illness.

864
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:12,400
He said we should spend
the next few months...

865
01:27:12,533 --> 01:27:16,433
...the last few months
getting to know each other again.

866
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,733
Don't be scared.

867
01:27:21,066 --> 01:27:23,000
Don't look so frightened of me.

868
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:27,633
Oh, Jesus, God.

869
01:27:31,066 --> 01:27:34,366
Please say you're not frightened of me,
Jimmy, please.

870
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:37,500
I'm so sorry, Jimmy.

871
01:27:37,633 --> 01:27:40,533
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

872
01:27:44,433 --> 01:27:47,266
-Just give him time.
-Jimmy?

873
01:27:50,166 --> 01:27:51,666
Jimmy?

874
01:27:53,566 --> 01:27:55,766
Jimmy!

875
01:30:21,066 --> 01:30:23,433
You just need to give him a little time,
John.

876
01:30:23,566 --> 01:30:25,466
All he needs is time.

877
01:30:44,433 --> 01:30:46,000
Jamie?

878
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:53,633
Jamie!

879
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,600
Jamie!

880
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,566
Jamie.

881
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,633
It won't take long.

882
01:31:25,766 --> 01:31:28,233
Please promise you'll be a good boy.

883
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:31,633
Jamie?

884
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,166
Jimmy, be a good boy
so we can play our game.

885
01:31:40,366 --> 01:31:42,600
Hide there for me, baby.

886
01:31:44,433 --> 01:31:46,600
Hide there for me, baby.

887
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,766
Stop. Wait, don't rush. Take time.

888
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,800
Jamie!

889
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,166
Jamie.

890
01:33:25,533 --> 01:33:28,466
Jamie. Jamie.

891
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,033
There.

892
01:33:33,166 --> 01:33:36,266
Jamie. It's all right.

893
01:33:37,433 --> 01:33:39,266
Jamie.

894
01:33:40,266 --> 01:33:44,266
Jamie. Jamie. Jamie.

895
01:33:47,033 --> 01:33:48,600
Jamie.

896
01:33:51,266 --> 01:33:52,600
Jamie.

897
01:33:54,566 --> 01:33:56,300
Jamie.

898
01:34:00,433 --> 01:34:04,000
Jamie. I know where you've gone.

899
01:34:04,133 --> 01:34:06,533
I know where you're hiding.

900
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:22,100
To have nothing, to feel nothing.

901
01:34:22,566 --> 01:34:24,533
To be nothing.

902
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,266
It doesn't work. I've tried it.

903
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,200
Why him?

904
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:33,366
And not me?

905
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:36,466
We can start from day one.

906
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,733
Then we can go from good to better.

907
01:34:39,033 --> 01:34:41,433
Anything's possible, Jamie...

908
01:34:42,266 --> 01:34:44,800
...except feeling nothing.

909
01:34:45,633 --> 01:34:48,066
That's never possible.

910
01:36:27,433 --> 01:36:30,266
I won't be second best, Jamie.

911
01:36:31,566 --> 01:36:35,600
If it's going to work,
it has to be as father and son.

912
01:36:39,766 --> 01:36:42,600
Take it or leave it. It's up to you.
