00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:53,815
<I> Damn, you do not mean. </ I>

14
00:00:56,665 --> 00:01:00,138
<I> Police, open up. </ I>
- <I> Keep your damn head </ i>.

15
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:03,588
Sir, you'd better open the door.

16
00:01:03,782 --> 00:01:07,717
What can I do for you?
- We got a complaint for disturbing the peace.

17
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:10,969
It is not a disorder,
we just fight.

18
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:13,629
Man and woman hassle.
- Ma'am, are you okay ??

19
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:17,436
You do not have to talk to them.
- Sir, away from the door.

20
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:20,915
I said we just fight.
- We want to ask her.

21
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,831
You're under arrest.
- What the hell for?

22
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:30,254
For assaulting a policeman.
- Let me go.

23
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:33,084
<I> On your knees. </ I>
- <I> I have not done anything </ i>.

24
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:36,237
<I> On your knees, damn it. </ I>

25
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:39,643
<I> Ma'am, you have to ...
Stay there. </ I>

26
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:45,906
<I> Let me go. </ I>
- <I> You guys are crazy </ i>.

27
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:48,445
<I> Stay there. </ I>

28
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:53,509
<I> Would you hit a cop? </ I>

29
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:57,095
<I> No, stop </ i>

30
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:02,295
<I> Let me go. </ I>

31
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,891
<I> Stop, you're killing him. </ I>

32
00:02:08,474 --> 00:02:11,951
Badge of Honor

33
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,219
You see them?
- What?

34
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,518
They do it to their liking,
it is becoming more violent.

35
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:17,894
It's a party, mate.
Relax.

36
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,155
Yes, I'm glad I'm here.

37
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,474
Yes I know that.

38
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:35,074
Do you want some?

39
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,922
Keep it.

40
00:04:00,298 --> 00:04:03,213
Keep your mouth shut and let me talk.

41
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,516
<I> Who is this guy doing? </ I>
- <I> He is with me </ i>.

42
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,927
That's not the deal.
- Do you want this or not?

43
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:31,196
Loco, they are two? N.

44
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:00,563
What you got for me, cowboy?

45
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:03,566
Where's the money?

46
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:07,584
Give that motherfucker his money.

47
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:46,162
It better be good quality.

48
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:21,652
Viktor, I go.
- Where are you going?

49
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,630
What is this mess?

50
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:49,494
Would you cheat me, asshole?

51
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:54,167
Seattle PD.

52
00:06:58,323 --> 00:06:59,937
Get out.

53
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:23,090
Lie on your knees.

54
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,491
Mike, grab that weapon.

55
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:29,771
Keep your mouth shut.

56
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:37,629
No movement.

57
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,350
Give me your hand.

58
00:07:55,217 --> 00:07:58,707
Stay here.
Stay here, damn it.

59
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,238
Back, to the inside.
- What ...

60
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:10,856
Stop, police.

61
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:20,088
Greg, I'm that guy lost.
I want 20.

62
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,355
I'm on the fourth floor. He
leave the building and is armed.

63
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,428
I go through the stairwell.
- Roger, I'm coming your way.

64
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:26,054
I cut him off stride.

65
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,310
No movement.

66
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:55,495
No, damn it.
Shit, not dying man.

67
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,183
Jesus Christ, Mike.

68
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:59,633
I came around the corner and
it seemed that he came to me.

69
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:03,112
I ...
Call it in, call the ambulance.

70
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:06,928
Do not die, damn it.
- He's already dead.

71
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:09,597
Damn, cunt.

72
00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:16,082
Did anyone see you?
- No.

73
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,692
No.
- Ok ?.

74
00:10:20,904 --> 00:10:23,313
Give me that even with that weapon from above.
- What?

75
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,687
Give me the gun, Mike.

76
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:28,779
Ok ?, damn.

77
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:32,564
No man, no.
- Listen to me.

78
00:10:32,584 --> 00:10:34,237
Go to the side.

79
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:37,939
You were chasing the suspect
on the stairwell, ok ??

80
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:39,834
He fired twice.

81
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:45,599
Well? You shot back.

82
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:49,511
No, I do not.

83
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,874
I do not, no.
- Yes, you are.

84
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:54,062
No me ...
- Yes, you are.

85
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:59,229
You participate, listen to me.
Listen damn to me.

86
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,634
You do it, you fucking do it.

87
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:09,017
It was an accident.
- Ok ?.

88
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:14,137
You're a good cop, Mike.
And I will not let you pay for here.

89
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:20,839
What is the alternative?
He is by and you go to jail

90
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,945
and they could not retrieve him.

91
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,480
Ok ??

92
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,761
Think about your family.
Think of your child.

93
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,760
Ok ??

94
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,475
Look at me, I got you
ever abandoned?

95
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:38,894
No, until now, no.
- Ok ?, then you should trust me now.

96
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:44,520
You have to trust me now.
because I'm going to settle this, ok ??

97
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:54,654
You did good, man.
I'll settle this.

98
00:11:56,727 --> 00:12:01,503
Ok ?, you have done well.

99
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:05,648
I'll settle this.

100
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:22,631
Lewis, come on please.
- Please.

101
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:29,005
Johny,
- Captain.

102
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:32,366
Make sure you keep away the press there,
it's a mess in there.

103
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:35,865
Charlie, good to see you.
Miles.

104
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:41,287
Gallo. Why did you
not asked for backup?

105
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:45,686
We had no time, Captain.
My informant reached me shortly before

106
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:50,211
but by the time Gallo and I
were here it was already loose.

107
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:52,911
Is that right, Gallo?
- Yes, sir.

108
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,693
David, come here.

109
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:59,301
Yes.
- What happened in the stairwell?

110
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:04,491
Captain?
- That boy, what happened?

111
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:10,590
Listen, Gallo chased him and
The suspect walked into the hall

112
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:15,159
and fired twice at him.
Mike, grabbed his gun and shot him.

113
00:13:15,464 --> 00:13:18,049
That boy has shot twice?
- Yes.

114
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:21,529
And Gallo has ?? s time shot?
- Yes that's right.

115
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,690
And that boy has shot first?
Captain ...

116
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,703
Are you sure?
- That's what I've seen, sir.

117
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:33,858
Gallo, I'm sorry it's hard.
How are you?

118
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,589
It will be fine.
So the boy drew his weapon

119
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,346
while you chased him.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:41,668
And he shot twice?
- Yes.

121
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,595
How many times have you shot?
- E once.

122
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,455
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

123
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:48,121
And boy shot first?
- Sure.

124
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:52,188
Are you sure?
Well, we go back inside

125
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,859
and go after all now it all
is still fresh, ok ??

126
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,433
Lewis.

127
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,461
I've been waiting for you.

128
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:17,096
How is he?
- Good.

129
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:19,403
Your "he" could be a "she."

130
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:26,063
I shot a guy today.

131
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,467
<I> Gallo, I know you're upset. </ I>

132
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:35,265
<I> Ok ?, but you just did your job. </ I>

133
00:14:36,781 --> 00:14:42,183
He can not have been older than 15 years.
He stood in the hall

134
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:44,638
and I thought he was someone else.

135
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:51,203
<I> Half the people do not know
what we experience every day. </ i>

136
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,912
Yes, a wild night for me.

137
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,839
<I> That you had to be there
lying on the ground bleeding to death, ok ?? </ i>

138
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:06,467
I saw him breathe his last breath.

139
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:13,669
Listen to me.
I do not care the pieces

140
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:18,797
what you think, or did not.
They'll nail you to the cross.

141
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:22,718
I shot.

142
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:52,127
He came to me recently and had
a girl and said, "I like her very much

143
00:15:52,147 --> 00:15:55,884
and wants her to the ball and I want
maybe buy her flowers. '

144
00:15:55,904 --> 00:16:00,109
And then I thought: 'How sweet. '
"With what money?"

145
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,000
I told him to look for work.
- Yes?

146
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,849
You have a phone call.
Maybe my trip to Hawaii?

147
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,127
Hi, Karen.

148
00:16:22,808 --> 00:16:24,429
Where is he?

149
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:30,541
I'm really sorry, Karen.

150
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:34,201
You do not want to see him so.

151
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:57,057
Ramon, honey.

152
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:48,332
Let it go.

153
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:50,994
That's not, honey.
- Leave it to go.

154
00:17:51,021 --> 00:17:54,957
No.
- It's the office.

155
00:17:54,977 --> 00:17:57,132
Call them back.

156
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:05,936
So, when?

157
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:11,089
Jesus.
Who's the agent in charge?

158
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,080
No, I'm about an hour in the office.

159
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:23,919
What was that about?
- Your husband.

160
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:27,842
God.

161
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:48,299
Captain.
- Good morning, Aaron.

162
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,209
Good morning, thank you for coming.
- With pleasure.

163
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:56,149
We have a problem case, Daniel

164
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,043
A 15 year old boy slain in
a shoot-out with your agents.

165
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:03,444
It was a justified act, Aaron.
- You call it justified?

166
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:06,678
An official investigation is started.
- Of course, that's procedure.

167
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:09,691
I'll talk to Mattis.
- Mattis, intoxicated with a bow around it.

168
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:12,670
Why?
- Because I have someone else design.

169
00:19:12,857 --> 00:19:16,096
Jessica Dawson.
- I do not know her.

170
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:17,983
She's new.

171
00:19:20,387 --> 00:19:23,281
She just comes from detective and Office East.

172
00:19:23,301 --> 00:19:27,127
Apparently there are not her
and arrested her partner

173
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:30,399
because he is a handcuffed suspect
half-dead hit last year.

174
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:36,649
Is that a problem?
- No, we have heard a lot of that case.

175
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:44,190
Note Daniel, is there something wrong with this case.
We have just not found it yet.

176
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,801
I'm not worried Aaron.
Mike Gallo has followed the procedures.

177
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:52,081
And he's a good cop.
- They are all good policemen

178
00:19:52,634 --> 00:19:56,584
until they are no more.
- The guy pulled a gun and shot first.

179
00:19:56,604 --> 00:20:01,449
To all appearances.
- Aaron, there is a witness who confirmed.

180
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:03,555
Detective Miles?
- Yes.

181
00:20:06,043 --> 00:20:08,563
Not credible.
- What do you mean?

182
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:13,711
A long list of misdemeanors.
He is a projectile and in my opinion

183
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:18,331
he does not belong to the police.
- Fortunately, I did not board my desk

184
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:23,207
according to your opinions, Aaron.
He is one of my most effective people

185
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:26,187
and he is a decorated officer.
- They shot a little kid down

186
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:29,706
in the middle of an apartment complex, Daniel.
- They shot an intruder down

187
00:20:29,726 --> 00:20:32,035
who shot at the police.

188
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:35,714
Maybe you are right.

189
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:41,319
But that does not change the fact that an
white cop killed a black boy

190
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:43,377
without the slightest warning.

191
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:47,169
The press will have a beautiful day with this,
I must remind you that?

192
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,085
I sit on a winnable place here.
it is clear to me.

193
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:56,995
When all hell breaks loose and I
promise you that it will happen

194
00:20:57,877 --> 00:21:01,317
I'm not the one going to fool.

195
00:21:02,476 --> 00:21:06,467
Count your once good at this. I would
find annoying when you are sucked.

196
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:11,583
With respect, in connection
your upcoming retirement.

197
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,649
How long do you have, six months?
- Yes.

198
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:20,091
What do you say, Aaron?
- I'll tell you how things stand.

199
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,295
Ok ?, there is anything else?

200
00:21:25,173 --> 00:21:26,987
That's all for now.

201
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,680
Ok ?.

202
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:30,943
Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.

203
00:21:32,863 --> 00:21:35,037
Let the Morel files
bring inside, please.

204
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,859
Bianca.

205
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,939
Ms. Rivera?

206
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,570
I'm Agent Jones.
- May I now take my son?

207
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,357
Madam, Ramon was found
with a gun in his possession

208
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:15,313
when he died.
Therefore fired the agent.

209
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:19,746
What? What are you talking about,
that is not possible.

210
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:23,121
Ma'am, I understand
that this is not easy.

211
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,074
But I can assure you that very
capable people working on this.

212
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,028
Very capable?
As the one who fired at ...

213
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:33,120
I want my son.

214
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:42,199
A good student, no notes,
no contacts with gangs

215
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:48,210
No suspension from school and shoot from
close to an agent in the middle of the night.

216
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,974
Do you think that's strange, detective?

217
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:59,246
I do not have enough facts to an opinion
about having this matter, sir.

218
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,649
Why do I ask a novice detective
without any experience in internal affairs of

219
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:06,807
to conduct this research?

220
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:10,435
Sir, I can not answer.

221
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:14,966
You testified against your partner, right?
- Yes, sir.

222
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:18,814
He was found not guilty
if I remember correctly.

223
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:23,284
You were however transferred
with administrative tasks.

224
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:29,590
You are a muggenzifter,
a danger to anyone.

225
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,248
There is no executive who you
ever give a promotion.

226
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:36,898
Why they chose you?

227
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:42,625
Because internal affairs is everything
you have left.

228
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:55,027
So they just shot him down?
- Yes.

229
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:57,350
Why?
- I do not know why.

230
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,272
That boy was just standing there
and the cop shot him just down.

231
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:02,520
How often do I have to have to explain?

232
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:05,541
Does he know you've seen him?
- I do not know.

233
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:08,580
Perhaps, yes.
- Then they'll find you.

234
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,746
Do you think I know that?
- My God, Jacob

235
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:17,131
We have to leave here.
- And where can we go?

236
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:19,771
I do not know. I have a cousin in Virginia,
maybe we can go to her,

237
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,740
Virginia?
What are we doing in Virginia?

238
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:27,303
Minimum wage, work,
The ends meet.

239
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:32,474
No, we do not.
- Look how we live now.

240
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:36,742
You said that the last transaction
would be, and then no more.

241
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:39,817
You promised.
- It does not all go as planned, right?

242
00:24:39,827 --> 00:24:43,637
Let's forget it and just leave.
- We have no money, Angela.

243
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:47,629
No food, no money for the rent, nothing.
- Find a job.

244
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:51,446
Stop whining.
Jesus, I rule it.

245
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:55,600
Mom?
- It's all right, darling,

246
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,051
Mommy and Daddy are just talking, ok ??

247
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:04,108
Hey, big guy.
Did we scare you?

248
00:25:05,656 --> 00:25:09,714
Sorry.
Listen, I'll take this, okay ??

249
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,434
So let me handle it.

250
00:25:13,156 --> 00:25:15,770
<I> What we do is not bad, ok ?? </ i>

251
00:25:16,827 --> 00:25:19,016
<I> I'll take you back to bed, okay ?? </ i>

252
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:07,249
How are you?
- Pressure.

253
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:09,784
<I> Yeah, I know.
You're always busy. </ I>

254
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:11,760
What do you want, David?

255
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,471
Listen, I was hoping
I could see you tomorrow even.

256
00:26:17,548 --> 00:26:19,438
I do not think so.

257
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,898
The only thing I ask is
if you want to have lunch with me.

258
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:27,095
Yet you still know
we're divorced, right?

259
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:31,268
Yes, I do know, but I ...

260
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:34,660
I just missed you.

261
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:39,606
Please, do not.

262
00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:57,921
I had a very difficult
arrest this morning.

263
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,054
A boy was slain.
- Yes, I heard.

264
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:20,137
Look where I am.
I feel a bit alone here

265
00:27:20,157 --> 00:27:22,092
and you're the only friend I have.

266
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,455
Have you signed the papers?

267
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:34,607
David?

268
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,479
What are they ...
Yes.

269
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:44,832
David.
- I'll take them.

270
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:50,250
Well, eating lunch.
Goodbye, David.

271
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:52,910
Listen, I ...

272
00:28:16,757 --> 00:28:18,911
Bam, asshole.

273
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:31,517
Jacob, where have you been all this time?

274
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:36,331
I stayed out of sight.
It was disturbed when.

275
00:28:36,351 --> 00:28:39,516
I can not believe you
are there out alive.

276
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:43,431
Just on.
Those cops were shooting inside.

277
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:51,996
Do you know what happened to that guy?
- What guy?

278
00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:57,052
Emerging from the news, they have slain.

279
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:59,506
Yeah, I heard that he was on the police
has shot.

280
00:28:59,932 --> 00:29:03,730
Disturbed Mexican.
- That damn Mexicans.

281
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:09,270
No, that boy has done nothing.

282
00:29:09,844 --> 00:29:12,365
That cop shot him in cold blood.

283
00:29:17,144 --> 00:29:20,209
Did you see that?
- It was really weird.

284
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:26,151
Listen man, I think we are
momentarily not have to see.

285
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,954
I can not use that kind of attention
so come here but no more.

286
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:37,362
Yes that is good.

287
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,099
Maybe I'm out of town.
I am fed up.

288
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:45,491
Once I get my money I'm out.
- What?

289
00:29:45,877 --> 00:29:48,272
Your money?
- Yes man.

290
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:52,830
My part.
- There is no part.

291
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:57,820
That deal backfired.
- I know you took all that money.

292
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:00,140
So just give me my share
and then I'm gone.

293
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,599
What're you talking about?
What are you talking about, man?

294
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:08,342
You're lucky to be alive.

295
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:15,576
And how do I know it was not the informant
who betrayed us to the police?

296
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,766
Get the col? Re with your bullshit.
- I col get re?

297
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:23,582
Yes, I am not a traitor.
- The money Samuel, I have earned it.

298
00:30:28,184 --> 00:30:30,593
Turn it over.

299
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:34,900
You store not as a tone with me.

300
00:30:35,786 --> 00:30:37,563
Give me your fucking arm.

301
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:41,504
You know what we do to traitors?

302
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,292
Detective Dawson? Captain Richards wants you
like speaking in his office.

303
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:05,470
Come on in.

304
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,032
Captain.
- Yes?

305
00:32:11,052 --> 00:32:14,874
I'm Detective Dawson internal affairs.
You wanted to see me?

306
00:32:17,618 --> 00:32:22,111
Yes, please sit down.

307
00:32:22,646 --> 00:32:24,234
Thank you.

308
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:32,527
I understand that you are new.
- I'm new to this office, yes.

309
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:36,078
And new to internal affairs.
- Yes.

310
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:39,430
Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you, sir.

311
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:47,008
I do not know what you expect

312
00:32:47,028 --> 00:32:51,604
But I want you to know that at this office
Internal affairs is not a separate department.

313
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:55,964
It is not us against.
- I understand that.

314
00:32:55,984 --> 00:32:59,048
I know you have to do your job,
I must also.

315
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,733
I want as little a rampage
officer in my department than you.

316
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:06,042
I just want you to remember that we are here
all professional police men

317
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:09,571
and women too, of course.

318
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:14,228
We do our best to the community
protect and serve.

319
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:16,422
We are not the bad guys, ok ??

320
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:18,542
Of course.
- Ok ?.

321
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:23,587
So you've got the Gallo case?
- Yes.

322
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:26,496
How's it going so far?
- I did not have all the facts, sir.

323
00:33:26,516 --> 00:33:29,944
You've surely got the reports?
- I've got them.

324
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:35,988
Do agent Gallo, administrative service now?
- Yes, until further notice.

325
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:39,743
So you do not suspend him?
- No.

326
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,363
That depends on your research.

327
00:33:42,661 --> 00:33:44,486
I want to question him.
- Of course.

328
00:33:44,506 --> 00:33:49,862
And the other officer, Detective Miles.
- Yeah, are available.

329
00:33:49,882 --> 00:33:53,547
Thank you.
- And I also hope to be able to contribute.

330
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,183
Thank you, sir.

331
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:00,362
Do you have any questions?

332
00:34:01,157 --> 00:34:03,125
They will still come.

333
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,242
That's all over.
- Thank you, sir.

334
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,507
Ms. Dawson?

335
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:20,189
Unofficially. Hope you
do not mind me saying

336
00:34:20,209 --> 00:34:24,339
I did not expect such a young person.

337
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:31,153
Thank you for coming.

338
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:25,209
is that for me?
- It's probably cold.

339
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:28,787
I know I am what I leave.
I ...

340
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:33,215
I had a bad morning.
- You have chosen the time, David.

341
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:38,586
And you instead.
- This was close to both of us.

342
00:35:38,606 --> 00:35:44,595
Only close to you, Rebecca.
Have you any idea where I stay?

343
00:35:46,546 --> 00:35:49,733
You get the house back soon.
I almost moved my stuff.

344
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:54,471
I told you I do not want the house.
You can stay as long as you want.

345
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:58,714
I am OK ?.
I move in with a friend.

346
00:35:58,915 --> 00:36:00,696
A friend?

347
00:36:02,128 --> 00:36:06,669
I get it, yes.

348
00:36:10,697 --> 00:36:13,604
You're such an asshole. I do not know
why I still energy in stop.

349
00:36:15,277 --> 00:36:17,830
I'm happy for you, Rebecca.

350
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:20,250
No, I really, I ...

351
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:25,059
The single life also goes well with me.
I have all kinds of options.

352
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,654
If you are married also stopped.
- You left me.

353
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:36,632
I'm not talking to you.
Did you bring the papers?

354
00:36:37,726 --> 00:36:42,194
Damn, the papers.
I forget them, I ...

355
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:49,243
Why make this harder?

356
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:52,277
Because I still love you.

357
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,775
Rebecca, look at me.

358
00:36:59,356 --> 00:37:02,874
And tell me that you
Do not think of me.

359
00:37:05,115 --> 00:37:09,190
I have a meeting, I should go.
- Jesus Christ, we just got here.

360
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:15,200
No, you're right.
I'm a half hour there, remember?

361
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:20,560
Sign the papers and bring them along home.
- Rebecca, listen.

362
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,230
Hey guys.

363
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:49,961
Where are you going?
- I wanted to bring some stuff back home.

364
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:52,246
Why do you not come back?

365
00:37:52,266 --> 00:37:56,236
This is only a temporary situation, it is
just as long as the investigation lasts.

366
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,228
It will be fine.
- Why would not they be?

367
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:04,048
Gives you nothing in your head, man.

368
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:07,990
We do hard work and
sometimes things like this happen.

369
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:11,488
Yes, you are right.
- Detective Dawson is an honest cop.

370
00:38:11,508 --> 00:38:14,524
Just tell your side of the story.
That's all you need to do.

371
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:16,458
Ok ??
- Yes, sir.

372
00:38:16,478 --> 00:38:19,515
Leave your things here,
they are safe, come on.

373
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:26,189
Look at that.

374
00:38:26,477 --> 00:38:29,915
That's a boy, you hear that?

375
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:35,296
That's your baby's heartbeat.
A healthy boy, congratulations.

376
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:03,939
<I> Do you remember that night? </ I>
- <I> Yes </ i>.

377
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:07,472
<I> I want you to remember that this
is part of a criminal investigation. </ i>

378
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:10,746
Do you understand.
- I understand that.

379
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:14,714
I want to ensure that you do not get a
lawyer requested, is that correct?

380
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:20,587
Do I need one?
- Answer the question detective.

381
00:39:22,842 --> 00:39:26,431
Yes ma'am, that's right.

382
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:31,002
Detective, not answering my
questions or antagonizing any aspect

383
00:39:31,022 --> 00:39:34,795
This investigation or interrogation,
lead to criminal prosecution.

384
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,309
Are you new?

385
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:44,039
Everyone asks me that, does it matter?

386
00:39:47,364 --> 00:39:53,350
Do you mind that I smoke?
- Yes, it is a non-smoking building.

387
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,067
And get your gun off the table, please.

388
00:40:05,484 --> 00:40:07,711
I have some questions for you.

389
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:13,366
Who autoriseerde this operation?
- I did.

390
00:40:13,386 --> 00:40:16,542
Do you permission first
someone had from the office?

391
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:21,206
No time. I got a tip and I have there
action taken.

392
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:24,768
There is recovered any money, right?

393
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:33,696
That was in my report, yes.
- I have read it.

394
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:36,899
What time did you get
at the place of the event?

395
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:42,468
Just after nightfall, the transaction
would occur around 20:00.

396
00:40:42,584 --> 00:40:46,753
And your mission?
- We are waiting just outside the building

397
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:49,347
and Miles had the information.

398
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:52,136
How long were you with the investigation
this operation involved?

399
00:40:52,156 --> 00:40:57,682
This group popped up a year ago
and we followed them for three months.

400
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:03,969
Who gave you the details of the deal?
- I've never had that information.

401
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:06,011
You know how many suspects
were involved?

402
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:08,265
I've heard nothing about.

403
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:11,575
You knew one of the suspects
Before playing this matter?

404
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:14,519
No.
- But you identified Ramon Rivera

405
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:18,068
as one of the drug dealers.
- You ever worked himself into the field, detective?

406
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:20,014
Yes I have.
- Is there ever shot you?

407
00:41:20,034 --> 00:41:23,140
That someone wanted to kill you?
- That's irrelevant.

408
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,728
You know nothing of it, why your question
perhaps those stupid questions.

409
00:41:29,298 --> 00:41:33,076
Tell me about Ramon Rivera.
- I know nothing about him.

410
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:36,418
What happened is terrible.
but happened so many around me

411
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:40,771
and there was so much shot at me ...
- You made a mistake?

412
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:45,236
No, I defended myself.

413
00:41:45,658 --> 00:41:47,410
He shot at you first?
- Yes.

414
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:50,861
Yes.
- Yes, he shot first.

415
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:55,177
E? N times, twice?
- I saw two shots, I heard two.

416
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,494
I've fucking heard two shots.
- Heard or seen?

417
00:41:58,514 --> 00:42:02,810
He shot me, ?? n times, twice.
He had a gun and shot me.

418
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,550
And you shot back?
- Yes.

419
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,532
So you're saying that those 15 years old
boy without criminal

420
00:42:07,552 --> 00:42:09,870
was involved in this
giant drug deal?

421
00:42:13,974 --> 00:42:19,960
Cincinatti Ohio, writes a 15-year-old boy
a book report on Huckleberry Finn.

422
00:42:21,096 --> 00:42:23,628
The teacher gives him a six min.

423
00:42:24,264 --> 00:42:28,989
The next day he comes to school with the
weapon from his father and kills his teacher

424
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:31,126
and eighteen others.

425
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:35,919
Then stop that little bastard in the arm
his mouth and pulls the trigger.

426
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:39,038
There is daily violence, detective.

427
00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:44,368
So tell me no nonsense story
a great kid

428
00:42:44,388 --> 00:42:49,836
which not hurt a fly.
Because I do not care of it.

429
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:58,651
You were involved in yet so
a shooting, right?

430
00:42:59,622 --> 00:43:02,278
I am involved in a lot of shootings,
Yes.

431
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:06,674
An unarmed car driver?
You cut him?

432
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:08,621
I am acquitted.

433
00:43:09,522 --> 00:43:13,221
Not exactly. The case was settled with
the family of the boy

434
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:15,809
and you got disciplinary leave.

435
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:24,614
Did you bother to temper yourself
To maintain control, detective?

436
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,570
What do you think?

437
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:32,861
Is that why your wife
has had to impose a restraining order?

438
00:43:34,662 --> 00:43:39,405
And you're not even in a second
parting with your second wife?

439
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,898
I do not think it's relevant.

440
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:47,498
Not?

441
00:43:51,353 --> 00:43:53,276
That's all for today.

442
00:43:56,436 --> 00:43:58,673
This is for when you might
something forgotten.

443
00:44:00,912 --> 00:44:03,160
I forget nothing.

444
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:37,119
An awkward, right?
- I've seen worse.

445
00:44:37,323 --> 00:44:43,110
All that nonsense about my personal history.
Cheap bullshit.

446
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:46,883
Has she said anything that was not true?

447
00:44:49,474 --> 00:44:50,990
Do you do that?

448
00:44:55,864 --> 00:44:59,427
Do you want to ask me something, Captain?
- I asked you one direct question, David.

449
00:45:00,345 --> 00:45:03,379
Have not you said something inside
that is not true?

450
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:10,014
Do not tell me you believe that nonsense.
- What I believe is

451
00:45:10,034 --> 00:45:13,545
that there is a very clear line to us
apart from the bad guys.

452
00:45:13,565 --> 00:45:16,700
They call it honor. Your father believed
there too, until the end.

453
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,715
I have taken his place when you
graduated from the academy.

454
00:45:19,735 --> 00:45:23,104
And I supported you, even if no
otherwise this office did.

455
00:45:23,124 --> 00:45:27,309
So I ask you now, man
to man, your honor.

456
00:45:27,345 --> 00:45:30,349
Plays more in this case
then you tell me?

457
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:42,555
I can not even believe
you ask me.

458
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:16,781
You should go to the police, Jacob.

459
00:46:17,313 --> 00:46:21,475
They should listen to you.
- I can not do.

460
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:28,314
I have just this sort.

461
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:31,974
No.

462
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,996
No, I can not do this anymore.

463
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:47,572
I just need ...

464
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:51,474
I just need a few days.

465
00:46:52,126 --> 00:46:57,943
Yes, you said a few days ago.
There is nothing better.

466
00:47:00,203 --> 00:47:02,869
We do not have enough food in the fridge.

467
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:13,112
I can arrange this.

468
00:47:16,578 --> 00:47:19,679
Trust me.
- You trust?

469
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,746
What happens the day
that you do not come home?

470
00:47:30,421 --> 00:47:32,961
What should I tell Adam?

471
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,300
I'm going away, Jacob.

472
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:46,105
With or without you. I let my son
not grow up in this mess.

473
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:47,923
Angela ...

474
00:47:53,475 --> 00:47:55,437
Angela.

475
00:48:53,379 --> 00:48:57,777
No that is not necessary.
- Stay away from me.

476
00:48:58,546 --> 00:49:01,097
Or what?
Are you going to shoot me?

477
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:04,655
I'm not armed.
- What do you want?

478
00:49:08,792 --> 00:49:11,249
Think you're better than me?

479
00:49:12,344 --> 00:49:15,314
Interrogate me like I'm the bad guy?

480
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:21,520
You ask me about my temperament.
Let me tell you what makes me angry.

481
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:28,485
Bureaucrats like you have no idea
what is needed to survive on the streets.

482
00:49:30,357 --> 00:49:34,354
Why do you think the hell
you're safe at night?

483
00:49:36,247 --> 00:49:40,900
And we need that bullshit
agents as you swallow.

484
00:49:41,367 --> 00:49:45,766
Once you get into the real world
then break you.

485
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,486
What kind of cop now throws
his partner off the bus?

486
00:49:51,776 --> 00:49:56,728
A man with a wife and a child. And
Do you take him on because he does his job.

487
00:49:57,312 --> 00:50:00,511
You must be very lonely
so if you're a bitch, is not it?

488
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:09,058
Maybe that's it.
Maybe you're lonely.

489
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:12,222
Maybe I can help you with that.

490
00:50:12,435 --> 00:50:14,396
Backward.

491
00:50:15,757 --> 00:50:18,014
Backward, detective.

492
00:50:22,367 --> 00:50:24,206
You got me.

493
00:50:27,443 --> 00:50:29,287
Have a nice evening.

494
00:50:48,596 --> 00:50:52,363
<I> What kind of cop now throws
his partner out of the bus? </ i>

495
00:50:55,784 --> 00:50:59,025
<I> A man with a wife a child ... </ i>

496
00:51:05,538 --> 00:51:08,721
<I> Rodriguez, he's under control.
Stop, Trevor. </ I>

497
00:51:08,741 --> 00:51:11,138
<I> Fuck Dawson, watch your suspect. </ I>

498
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:24,901
<I> Agent Rodriguez, put the gun down. </ I>

499
00:51:31,877 --> 00:51:33,850
<I> I'm your partner. </ I>

500
00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:37,854
<I> Drop it, now. </ I>

501
00:53:27,202 --> 00:53:28,710
<I> Thank you. </ I>

502
00:53:44,111 --> 00:53:45,654
What is going on?

503
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:48,350
This is Detective Dawson. She wants
talk to you about this case.

504
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:51,726
I do not think so.
What are you doing here?

505
00:53:52,885 --> 00:53:56,802
I questioned the tenants of the building.
Ramon came there often

506
00:53:56,822 --> 00:53:59,803
to visit his friend Viktor.
That night also.

507
00:53:59,993 --> 00:54:04,192
I talked to Victor and Ramon
never had a weapon with him.

508
00:54:04,212 --> 00:54:06,203
I have nothing to say.
- Michael.

509
00:54:06,772 --> 00:54:10,589
Penny, stay out here.
I want you to leave.

510
00:54:10,609 --> 00:54:14,985
You protect your partner?
- I've already given my statement.

511
00:54:15,005 --> 00:54:16,985
I've looked at your file. Michael.
You're not like Miles.

512
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:21,821
If it was an accident, I can help you.

513
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:26,280
Ramon did not shoot you
that day, is not it?

514
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:29,244
He did not even have a weapon.

515
00:54:30,197 --> 00:54:33,180
The truth eventually comes up anyway.

516
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,770
Goodbye, detective.

517
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,037
<I> A life lost in this community </ i>

518
00:54:42,057 --> 00:54:43,857
life is too much.

519
00:54:43,877 --> 00:54:47,273
<I> That's why I will be the full force
my desk ... </ i>

520
00:54:47,938 --> 00:54:50,550
<I> And I promise you will look differently ... </ i>

521
00:54:52,562 --> 00:54:54,877
<I> Because life does matter ... </ i>

522
00:54:54,897 --> 00:54:58,586
<I> The life of Ramon matter. </ I>

523
00:55:21,009 --> 00:55:25,429
<I> Ms. Rivera, sorry
very much for your loss. </ i>

524
00:55:25,732 --> 00:55:29,463
I can not even imagine
how difficult this must be for you.

525
00:55:29,965 --> 00:55:33,243
But agent Mike Gallo, has
a clean record.

526
00:55:33,617 --> 00:55:36,713
No previous shootings.
- He's lying.

527
00:55:37,316 --> 00:55:39,142
And he had someone who could vouch for him.

528
00:55:39,162 --> 00:55:40,915
They lie both.

529
00:55:40,935 --> 00:55:43,772
Ms. Rivera.
- You all lie.

530
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:49,870
Ms. Rivera, you know that your son
drugs?

531
00:55:51,028 --> 00:55:55,592
The autopsy report shows traces of
marijuana in his blood when he died.

532
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,188
Have you never had warning signs?

533
00:56:02,168 --> 00:56:06,690
Mrs. Rivera wants to think that their children
involved in something like this.

534
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:11,616
But with this evidence, there is nothing
we can do.

535
00:56:14,384 --> 00:56:16,020
Marijuana?

536
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:22,058
You do not shoot someone down
because he used marijuana.

537
00:56:35,784 --> 00:56:40,148
Shall we make a party of it, dear?
Come here.

538
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,414
Come here.

539
00:56:45,313 --> 00:56:47,514
Wanted you so badly, does not this?

540
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,787
But calm, quiet.
Take it.

541
00:59:06,507 --> 00:59:08,689
Keep your damn head.

542
00:59:20,397 --> 00:59:22,231
Asshole.

543
00:59:25,914 --> 00:59:27,836
Sorry.
- Damn.

544
00:59:28,977 --> 00:59:31,386
Shut the fuck shut your head there.

545
00:59:36,952 --> 00:59:40,823
Get out you, damn it out.

546
00:59:44,037 --> 00:59:48,219
Sammy.
Did you hide me?

547
00:59:48,383 --> 00:59:50,638
Did you not think I'd find?

548
00:59:50,707 --> 00:59:53,369
No, I do not hide myself for you.

549
00:59:53,403 --> 00:59:56,211
I had to just get
quietly keep in a safe place.

550
00:59:56,664 --> 01:00:01,506
And this is a safe place?
- Yeah, no one gives me something here.

551
01:00:02,917 --> 01:00:04,716
Except you.

552
01:00:04,973 --> 01:00:06,920
Where is my money, damn it?

553
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,957
Under the bed.
- Yes.

554
01:00:13,961 --> 01:00:15,580
Of course.

555
01:00:20,231 --> 01:00:24,167
You had it pretty fucked up.
We could have been dead.

556
01:00:25,098 --> 01:00:29,541
I told you to come alone.
Yes fixed, you and your

557
01:00:29,561 --> 01:00:32,502
damn trigger certain friends?

558
01:00:35,562 --> 01:00:40,559
Did you say that too at your partner?
he killed a boy.

559
01:00:44,046 --> 01:00:49,161
Why? You think I did not know
you think it stopped?

560
01:00:53,227 --> 01:00:55,806
You better pay attention, man.

561
01:00:56,669 --> 01:01:00,472
Do you walk to threaten me?
- I'm just, I'm just saying.

562
01:01:00,492 --> 01:01:02,766
What did you say?
- I did not say anything.

563
01:01:02,786 --> 01:01:05,161
Who did you tell.
- I have not told anyone.

564
01:01:05,181 --> 01:01:08,994
What the hell do you know?
- I know nothing, it is Jacob.

565
01:01:09,209 --> 01:01:12,978
He tells everyone in town that you
an unarmed boy gunned down.

566
01:01:12,998 --> 01:01:15,065
Well? I have nothing ...
- Have not you seen him?

567
01:01:15,954 --> 01:01:18,533
When you said that, I have
nothing said about it.

568
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:23,470
Who the hell is Jacob?
- It's nothing, man.

569
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,504
I gave him only brought because
you said you were going to arrest anyone, ok ??

570
01:01:27,524 --> 01:01:31,465
And it's not my fault
you guys they have run.

571
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:34,693
Listen to me.
Look at me.

572
01:01:34,713 --> 01:01:37,104
Ok ?, come on, okay?

573
01:01:38,983 --> 01:01:41,037
Why would I say something.

574
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:45,807
With everything that I already know about you?
- You fucking ...

575
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,357
Damn.

576
01:01:53,301 --> 01:01:57,611
Get the col? Re, man.
What was that, damn it?

577
01:02:10,849 --> 01:02:13,419
Who is this guy?
- I do not know.

578
01:02:13,474 --> 01:02:16,316
Where is he?
- I saw him recently beaten up.

579
01:02:16,694 --> 01:02:18,886
Ok ?? No one has seen him since then.

580
01:02:22,422 --> 01:02:23,952
Damn.

581
01:02:35,288 --> 01:02:37,344
Ok ?, this is what we do.

582
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:44,310
You think that guy and makes
he keeps his mouth.

583
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:51,570
We have not agreed.
- Find him, then you get the rest.

584
01:02:52,419 --> 01:02:56,546
Look, this is bullshit. I'm not going ...
- Find him.

585
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:42,550
What are we going to do now?

586
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:47,789
The only thing we can do, Mike.

587
01:03:49,773 --> 01:03:53,221
If he has no one told
he also does not do, okay ??

588
01:03:54,602 --> 01:03:57,844
He will probably disappear.
- Are you kidding me?

589
01:03:57,864 --> 01:04:01,691
He talks all.
How do you think I found out?

590
01:04:02,259 --> 01:04:05,725
Do you want to take that risk, Mike?
Because I certainly do not want.

591
01:04:06,902 --> 01:04:11,444
We need to find that guy and care
that he no further talks.

592
01:04:19,995 --> 01:04:21,874
Are you okay?

593
01:04:26,605 --> 01:04:28,726
Richards, has suspended me.

594
01:04:30,779 --> 01:04:32,461
Yes, I heard.

595
01:04:36,705 --> 01:04:38,834
How deep is the investigation?

596
01:04:40,707 --> 01:04:42,963
As deep as needed, Mike.

597
01:06:14,652 --> 01:06:17,827
Mom?

598
01:06:19,385 --> 01:06:21,628
I made you breakfast.

599
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:57,762
I need three people for dry walls.
- Yes, here.

600
01:06:57,783 --> 01:07:00,787
Wait.
Does someone here speak English?

601
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:02,890
You, you and you.

602
01:07:10,382 --> 01:07:12,531
Gringo, you go with?
It does work though.

603
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,891
Will you come back to school?

604
01:07:22,337 --> 01:07:25,933
I do not know.
I did not feel so good.

605
01:07:26,521 --> 01:07:28,882
My grandmother is deceased last year.

606
01:07:30,143 --> 01:07:34,389
My mother said that perhaps ...

607
01:07:36,567 --> 01:07:38,819
I can see my grandmother again maybe.

608
01:07:41,634 --> 01:07:44,047
Do you think it's true?
- Yes.

609
01:07:44,768 --> 01:07:46,880
And I think you're brother
also will see again.

610
01:07:51,744 --> 01:07:57,120
I hope you come back to school.
- That I do.

611
01:08:01,855 --> 01:08:03,860
Day.
- Day.

612
01:08:27,738 --> 01:08:30,800
Hello.
- Hi.

613
01:08:31,013 --> 01:08:32,829
You must be Amanda.

614
01:08:35,207 --> 01:08:37,737
I'm Jessica Dawson.
I'm from the police.

615
01:08:37,757 --> 01:08:39,280
Is your mother home?

616
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:43,013
She is inside.

617
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:45,768
Can you tell her I want to talk to her?

618
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:50,664
She wants to talk to anyone,
She sleeps all the time.

619
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:56,756
Are the police whosoever
my brother shot?

620
01:08:57,722 --> 01:09:00,165
I want to talk to your mother about.

621
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:05,301
My brother has never done anyone any harm.

622
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:22,611
Is yours?
Yes.

623
01:09:22,985 --> 01:09:26,615
My brother taught me to drive.
- Did he really?

624
01:09:27,932 --> 01:09:29,807
He was good on the bike.

625
01:09:30,969 --> 01:09:34,700
Tried every day after school
He teach me some tricks.

626
01:09:34,989 --> 01:09:37,340
<I> Ok?. </ I>
- <I> And I know there are also a few </ i>.

627
01:09:37,495 --> 01:09:39,310
<I> I was getting better. </ I>

628
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:42,623
<I> I'm sure he would be very proud. </ I>

629
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:48,126
Can I do something for you?

630
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:52,142
Hello Mrs. Rivera, I'm Jessica Dawson.
I am of internal affairs.

631
01:09:52,162 --> 01:09:54,440
Do you mind if I ...
- Amanda, go inside.

632
01:09:56,202 --> 01:09:57,720
Now.

633
01:10:01,379 --> 01:10:05,660
I want none of you around
My daughter comes, you understand that?

634
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,566
I understand, I'm just here
to ask a few questions.

635
01:10:08,586 --> 01:10:12,879
There's nothing to talk about. You
shot and killed my son.

636
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:15,654
And now you wanna get me tell
that he was a criminal?

637
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:18,411
You can rot
in hell for me.

638
01:10:19,528 --> 01:10:23,521
Mrs. Rivera, please. I know
that your son was not a criminal.

639
01:10:23,687 --> 01:10:26,018
I'm trying to prove.

640
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,632
What you got for me?

641
01:11:06,234 --> 01:11:09,011
Jacob lives with a female
on the West Side.

642
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:13,061
Angela Flores or so.
Here is the address.

643
01:11:15,824 --> 01:11:18,389
Are you sure he's there?
Yes, he is.

644
01:11:18,409 --> 01:11:21,883
And they have a child, ok ??
So always be home.

645
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,583
He now works as dagwerker.

646
01:11:34,379 --> 01:11:37,475
Do not worry, he's terrified.

647
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:40,934
He will make no problems.

648
01:11:41,428 --> 01:11:42,948
I'm not worried about him.

649
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:52,691
Would you like to earn $ 5000?

650
01:11:55,225 --> 01:11:57,464
What should I do?

651
01:11:59,547 --> 01:12:03,604
I still have a little problem you
maybe I can help.

652
01:12:18,936 --> 01:12:21,929
Is not it strange that no money
was found at the crime scene?

653
01:12:21,949 --> 01:12:25,178
No, fieldwork is rarely
according to the book.

654
01:12:25,242 --> 01:12:28,227
This whole operation was a disaster, sir.

655
01:12:28,247 --> 01:12:32,296
Five bad guys, two dead and arrested ?? n.
Fifty pounds Meth street.

656
01:12:32,316 --> 01:12:36,212
It was a disaster for the bad guys.
- Six.

657
01:12:41,064 --> 01:12:46,605
What?
- Six including the boy, Ramon.

658
01:12:47,099 --> 01:12:48,990
You said five.

659
01:12:49,796 --> 01:12:53,482
You know that Ramon Rivera nothing
that had to do with drug deal.

660
01:12:53,927 --> 01:12:56,887
I do not know for sure, detective.

661
01:12:57,598 --> 01:13:00,242
But I want to share something with you.

662
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:05,531
We received many calls about this matter
but not one like this, sergeant.

663
01:13:08,046 --> 01:13:09,764
<I> I know who that boy has been shot. </ I>

664
01:13:09,784 --> 01:13:13,804
<I> But quietly Madam,
I do not want on the news. </ i>

665
01:13:13,824 --> 01:13:16,729
<I> He had no weapon, he had
to make it even nothing to do with. </ i>

666
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:20,737
<I> My boyfriend was there he
knows everything, he saw everything. </ i>

667
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:24,242
<I> Now they are after him

Ok ?? Then it's over.

01:14:37,381 --> 01:14:40,258
All you have to do is
bastard shoot at loggerheads.

682
01:14:40,278 --> 01:14:42,597
Shoot him at loggerheads?
Should you hear yourself.

683
01:14:42,617 --> 01:14:45,965
I'm not a murderer.
- Yes?

684
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:49,018
Tell that

685
01:14:49,563 --> 01:14:52,578
Get out you, I'm done.

686
01:14:53,887 --> 01:14:57,661
You're not finished with it when I say that.

692
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:46,497
Hello?

693
01:16:46,752 --> 01:16:49,799

694
01:16:49,819 --> 01:16:51,947
But you have to promise that you

01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:57,469
I can not do. But if you

Where did you hide my whole life?

701
01:18:13,616 --> 01:18:16,211
The big dog got you.

01:18:18,804 --> 01:18:22,480
This is just fun for you, ok ??

703
01:18:33,979 --> 01:18:36,316

01:19:41,648 --> 01:19:46,245
I'm really proud of you.

706
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:48,896
To earn a little more
and then we're gone.

707
01:19:56,644 --> 01:19:58,297
I love you.

708
01:20:02,251 --> 01:20:04,810

<I> How did you sleep without pajamas? </ I>

715
01:20:48,087 --> 01:20:49,800
Damn.

716
01:21:00,519 --> 01:21:02,113
Yes, I have license from the state
Washington State needed

01:21:02,133 --> 01:21:07,151

01:21:52,686 --> 01:21:55,091
Wait.

723
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:05,221
This guy was present at the drug deal.
What?

724
01:22:07,171 --> 01:22:10,757
Before the boy shot,
he ran away with the money.

725
01:22:24,044 --> 01:22:25,867
Yes.

726
01:22:28,064 --> 01:22:30,075
No.

727
01:22:41,091 --> 01:22:43,172
Mike, what are you doing?

728
01:22:48,936 --> 01:22:51,054
Miles is behind this.
- No.

729
01:22:51,074 --> 01:22:53,443

01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:56,145
Are you sure?
- Yes.

731
01:22:56,165 --> 01:22:59,141
I have been a hundred times in there.
There is a door in the back.

732
01:22:59,161 --> 01:23:00,862
It's a cinch.

733
01:23:02,737 --> 01:23:04,717
Michael, do not screw up.

734
01:23:04,848 --> 01:23:09,708

Go ahead.
- Can I have the location of Detective Miles?

736
01:23:21,425 --> 01:23:23,054
No one has seen him all day.

737
01:23:23,074 --> 01:23:25,511
But he asked for a license,
Two minutes ago.

738
01:23:25,521 --> 01:23:27,040

Do you know who that is?

01:24:17,233 --> 01:24:21,230
They killed Jacob. They have him
murdered and they will also murder me.

754
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:24,919
Then we have to call the police.
- No, we can not call the police.

755
01:24:24,939 --> 01:24:28,045
Police killed Jacob.
Do not you listen to me?

756
01:24:28,065 --> 01:24:31,332
I can not call the police.
- What's the matter with you?

757
01:24:31,339 --> 01:24:36,043
Mom, I need to get away.

01:25:02,011 --> 01:25:05,389
Please, we can

Why did you come here?

01:25:56,461 --> 01:25:59,157
My son, how is my son?

01:26:02,975 --> 01:26:05,105
Help me, you hear?
Help me.

779
01:26:05,187 --> 01:26:08,274
Bandits, what a situation.

780
01:26:11,297 --> 01:26:13,291
Put the damn door.

781
01:26:14,275 --> 01:26:18,925
Call, call on.
- He's from the police.

782
01:26:21,671 --> 01:26:24,266
Put the damn door.

783
01:26:27,317 --> 01:26:28,863
Beware.

784
01:26:33,102 --> 01:26:36,787
My son.
- Open the door, whore.

785
01:26:45,517 --> 01:26:50,402
Dirty whore, put that door.

786
01:26:50,723 --> 01:26:52,342
Damn.

787
01:26:53,262 --> 01:26:54,820
Zooi sucks.

788
01:27:01,023 --> 01:27:03,669
Now do the damn door, whore.

789
01:27:10,549 --> 01:27:12,214
That's his car.

790
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:16,632
David?

791
01:27:21,292 --> 01:27:22,931
David?

792
01:27:25,943 --> 01:27:28,134
Jessica, wait.

793
01:27:32,809 --> 01:27:35,289
Ok ?? Are you hit?
- No.

794
01:27:52,329 --> 01:27:56,372
Get the col? Re.
- Stay here.

795
01:28:41,913 --> 01:28:43,500
David.

796
01:30:15,610 --> 01:30:17,865
David, it's over, man.

797
01:30:19,156 --> 01:30:20,819
It's over.

798
01:30:21,905 --> 01:30:26,968
You go there lapping me, Mike?
I saved you.

799
01:30:28,128 --> 01:30:32,887
I've done all this for you.
- No David, you did it for the money.

800
01:30:33,982 --> 01:30:37,773
Yes, I know, other people know it.
You can not murder anyone.

801
01:30:39,555 --> 01:30:44,105
If you do this, we are both the dick.

802
01:30:44,503 --> 01:30:49,274
This will end. Blame it on me
it all makes me any more.

803
01:30:51,637 --> 01:30:56,003
I can not admit because I want
not sit, I can not.

804
01:30:56,023 --> 01:30:57,996
And neither do you.

805
01:31:00,062 --> 01:31:04,036
I shot the boy down.
It could have been my son

806
01:31:04,076 --> 01:31:05,866
And I can not live with.

807
01:31:15,588 --> 01:31:18,018
Do you think they'll let you go?

808
01:31:18,677 --> 01:31:21,336
Just because you've known?

809
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,195
They will burn down your damn, Mike.

810
01:31:28,611 --> 01:31:30,250
That should then.

811
01:31:32,314 --> 01:31:35,159
I'm not gonna shoot you, man.

812
01:31:37,472 --> 01:31:39,142
You're my partner.

813
01:31:40,711 --> 01:31:43,118
But I must tell the truth.

814
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:52,183
I must do it.

815
01:32:07,817 --> 01:32:09,744
I'm sorry, mate.

816
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:26,751
I can not let you do that.

817
01:32:43,018 --> 01:32:46,674
Mike.

818
01:32:49,647 --> 01:32:52,432
Mike, stay with me.
Just keep breathing, okay ??

819
01:32:57,170 --> 01:33:00,384
It was an accident.
- I know.

820
01:33:01,692 --> 01:33:03,467
I know.

821
01:33:06,382 --> 01:33:09,433
Tell my son that I did the right thing.

822
01:33:11,934 --> 01:33:16,161
Do not go away, just breathe, okay ??

823
01:33:19,327 --> 01:33:21,992
God.

824
01:33:25,584 --> 01:33:27,287
Mike?

825
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:50,481
This you bring me as your final report?
- Yes, sir.

826
01:33:53,759 --> 01:33:59,750
So you want me to believe that Detective Miles
everything done only in this case?

827
01:34:00,450 --> 01:34:02,398
It's all in the report, sir.

828
01:34:02,418 --> 01:34:07,446
And you realize that the statements
Detective Gallo even contradicts it.

829
01:34:07,466 --> 01:34:09,212
Yes, I realize.

830
01:34:11,253 --> 01:34:17,057
And in that line, you commend the Gallo
family receives full compensation

831
01:34:17,077 --> 01:34:21,085
for his outstanding service
for this community

832
01:34:21,224 --> 01:34:22,911
Yes.

833
01:34:30,389 --> 01:34:33,682
Would you these facts
defend, detective?

834
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:49,414
I can not but
then tell the truth, sir.

835
01:35:12,669 --> 01:35:17,578
I do not think we even longer
tax money to waste.

836
01:35:19,065 --> 01:35:22,958
I declare the case closed.
- Thank you, sir.
