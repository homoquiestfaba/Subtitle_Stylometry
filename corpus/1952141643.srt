1
00:00:21,987 --> 00:00:23,659
(Eerie high-pitched whirring)

2
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:25,817
Leave him alone!

3
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:27,943
Er macht viel zu viele Witze!

4
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:42,179
- Come on, Liz. We must get out of here.
- But Graz will kill us.

5
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,903
Halt.

6
00:00:54,027 --> 00:00:56,780
She's been hit. He's shot her. Killed her.

7
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:59,381
(Eerie high-pitched whirring)

8
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:02,743
Schweinhund.

9
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:05,136
- How badly is she hurt?
- She's dead.

10
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:09,379
Get her on the sofa. The sofa at once.
Come on, Simon, help me. That's it.

11
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:11,776
Slowly. Good.

12
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:16,985
We'll have to get a doctor
if there's a bullet in her.

13
00:01:17,067 --> 00:01:19,376
- Let's see how bad it is.
- lf she dies...

14
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:21,423
She won't.

15
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,623
- That's strange.
- What is?

16
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,147
- There's blood, but no mark.
- What?

17
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,423
l don't understand this.

18
00:01:32,787 --> 00:01:36,018
There's nothing.
The skin hasn't been broken.

19
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:41,981
Yes. Yes, Mr Traynor, she's over here.

20
00:01:44,827 --> 00:01:46,783
Jean? Jean?

21
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,823
She's out. Out like a light.

22
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,619
l wonder why she came here.

23
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:55,585
She must have seen something
that drew her here.

24
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,340
lt looks as if her gift
is coming into its own.

25
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:01,578
- She's coming round.
- Let's get her back to the hotel.

26
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,976
Liz. Liz.

27
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:08,857
Frank! Frank, Liz is dead.

28
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:12,622
Honest, it can't hurt.
The bullet didn't even touch you.

29
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:14,902
lt's like a knife, a red-hot knife.

30
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:19,540
But it can't be.
You haven't even been hit.

31
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:23,984
lt's queer. Your thug could hardly have
missed her at point-blank range.

32
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:25,785
Was passierte hier?

33
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,984
Sie wurde erschossen
wahrend sie fluchtete.

34
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,023
Very well. Sit her up, Simon.

35
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:34,338
- But it hurts and she's crying.
- Do as l tell you.

36
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,023
Ow!

37
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:44,455
Now, listen to me, young lady.
You've had a lucky escape.

38
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:49,701
l don't understand how. You're all right
and that will be the end of the matter.

39
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:53,575
- You can stop crying.
- l'm not all right. l've been shot.

40
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:57,455
- No, Liz, there's no mark.
- Then why does it hurt so much?

41
00:02:57,547 --> 00:03:01,096
- You are playing tricks again.
- Look, it can't hurt.

42
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:03,143
Feel it and see.

43
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:06,143
- Feel?
- Yes.

44
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:19,617
- Funny. l thought there'd be a hole.
- There isn't.

45
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:21,459
No.

46
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:25,140
And will you kindly stop
wasting my time?

47
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:28,185
How's it wasting time?
There's a mystery.

48
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:31,657
The bullet didn't hit her -
where's the blood come from?

49
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:34,022
Hmm.

50
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:41,655
This door won't lock.
l'll have to put you in the back room

51
00:03:41,747 --> 00:03:46,741
where you'll be free of the tender mercies
of Graz and out of my hair. Come on.

52
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,976
Come and sit down.

53
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,023
Jean, you must keep calm.

54
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:04,020
- Calm? How can l be calm? Liz is dead.
- No, Jean, no.

55
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:06,541
l tell you. l saw the German shoot her.

56
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:10,984
She was climbing through the window
and then he fired and she fell.

57
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:16,095
And all because that man wanted
some information and you trusted him.

58
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:21,026
Mrs Skinner, l'm asking you
to believe that your daughter is not hurt.

59
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:24,383
- How can l believe that? She's dead.
- No.

60
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:27,140
But l saw her fall, the bullet hit her.

61
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:31,664
ln a state of hallucination,
it is impossible for her to come to harm.

62
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:34,341
She's only there in a subjective sense.

63
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:38,261
But if something happened,
which she associated with harm,

64
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:43,057
like a gun going off in her direction,
she could imagine she'd been hurt.

65
00:04:43,147 --> 00:04:44,466
lmagine it?

66
00:04:44,547 --> 00:04:48,620
That gun was fired in 1940.
The bullet couldn't possibly have hit Liz.

67
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:52,256
But l saw the patch of blood.
lt spread and spread.

68
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:55,145
She couldn't imagine
something like that.

69
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:59,584
Well, l assure you it is possible,
but it is a difficult business,

70
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:02,898
so perhaps you'd better find out
the truth of the matter.

71
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:04,943
- Me?
- Yes, you.

72
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:07,177
Only you can help now. You know that.

73
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:11,340
Look, haven't we frittered away
too much time on this operation already?

74
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:14,976
You have a window on Liz's world
and you're aware of it.

75
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,183
You must take charge from now on.

76
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,223
l think you can if you choose.

77
00:05:19,307 --> 00:05:22,856
See what you want to see
when you want to see it.

78
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:33,863
Frank, are you all right?

79
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:37,417
Yes, fine. Just that muzzy feeling
in my head again.

80
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:39,463
- And you?
- Oh, great.

81
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,460
There was nothing the matter with me.
l just thought l was hurt.

82
00:05:43,547 --> 00:05:48,701
Thought it. Well, that makes us a couple
of odd bods, doesn't it? Proper cases.

83
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,223
Oh.

84
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,336
Frank, can't you remember anything
about what happened?

85
00:05:57,427 --> 00:06:00,305
You lost your memory.
There's got to be a reason.

86
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:03,504
All that's going through my mind
is l had something to do.

87
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:06,260
No, not that. That was the machine thing.

88
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:09,464
You had to dismantle it.
But Simon says you did.

89
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:12,983
What made you lose your memory?
The accident or whatever?

90
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,463
l don't know. You're a funny kid.

91
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:19,220
We are prisoners of war,
nothing to each other,

92
00:06:19,307 --> 00:06:21,662
and you worry about me. That's nice.

93
00:06:25,227 --> 00:06:28,139
Hey. Don't get upset.

94
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:33,937
lf l could tell you what you wanted to
know, l would. But l'm blessed if l can.

95
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,576
lt's just a mystery
that will never be solved, isn't it?

96
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,261
Like you bleeding
when you weren't shot.

97
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:42,383
- What?
- That's a big mystery.

98
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:45,061
A bigger mystery
than what happened to me.

99
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:48,696
There are far too many
confounded mysteries around here.

100
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:52,746
lt's time we worked a few things out.
Shouldn't be too hard.

101
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:54,943
l'm too tired to start thinking.

102
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:59,657
You said we had to find out about
those papers in the Commander's office.

103
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:03,342
- How can we do that without thinking?
- What are you on about?

104
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:07,864
The first mystery is what happened
to Liz. Then what happened to you.

105
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:10,780
- But l think l've got a clue.
- You have?

106
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:14,177
You broke out bleeding
when you hadn't been hurt.

107
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,576
l read about something like that once.

108
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,976
This man in a war was very frightened.

109
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:22,457
He had a dream about being chased
by natives with knives.

110
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:24,936
When he woke up,
there was a gash on his leg.

111
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,417
- You mean he thought there was a gash.
- No, it was there.

112
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:30,702
Only in this case, it didn't bleed.

113
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:44,263
(Eerie whirring)

114
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:49,943
(Voices echo)

115
00:07:56,307 --> 00:07:59,379
What l'm saying is
the opposite happened to Liz.

116
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:01,423
(Voices echo)

117
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,702
She thought she'd been hit by the bullet.

118
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,743
(Voices echo)

119
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,576
So even though
there wasn't any wound...

120
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,623
(Voices echo)

121
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:25,062
- She's all right.
- What happened?

122
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:27,103
Oh, Frank, Liz is all right.

123
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,901
She only imagined the bullet hit her.

124
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:34,621
l can hear what they're talking about.

125
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:36,379
Simon's saying...

126
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:39,061
- Autosuggestion.
- Auto?

127
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:41,502
All it means is you do it to yourself.

128
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,499
That's silly. How can you bleed
when there's no wound?

129
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:47,818
How did the man get a gash on his leg
when there was no knife?

130
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:52,059
l don't know. But if it is true,
l don't like it. lt sounds mad.

131
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:54,103
That's the word for it, girlie.

132
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:57,623
We were a couple of odd bods
and now we're a couple of nuts.

133
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:59,982
He isn't talking about you, Frank.

134
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,980
That's another mystery altogether.
What's the solution to that?

135
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:07,616
- Oh, l'm not so sure there.
- You're not?

136
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:12,497
Listen, remember when you dismantled
that machine after l found the cupboard?

137
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:15,659
- You still felt dizzy.
- l was only half there.

138
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:18,898
And yet you still seemed
to remember what to do.

139
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:21,581
That's peculiar. So l was wondering...

140
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:26,457
lf you tried to dismantle the machine
before, only something went wrong.

141
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:29,220
Perhaps something to do with the ray.

142
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:33,577
The ray's only a beam of light,
but very powerful.

143
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:36,340
lf it were turned on someone...

144
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:41,903
- it might...might...
- (Skinner) Yes?

145
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:46,577
Something's happened.

146
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,543
l can't seem to hear any more.

147
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,220
lt's all...

148
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,339
all...

149
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:02,575
lt's gone now. l've lost them.

150
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,023
Come and sit down.

151
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:15,982
lf the ray were turned on someone...

152
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,422
So you think that's
what happened to me.

153
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:22,341
The beam we had then was a candle
compared with what we have now.

154
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:25,942
But all the same,
if you did manage to get a touch of it...

155
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:29,576
Come on, Commander.
l've been waiting 30 years to hear this.

156
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,623
My dear chap, who can tell?

157
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,463
Brain damage perhaps.

158
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,300
- Brain damage?
- Memory cells destroyed.

159
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,298
Yes, that seems to make sense.

160
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:45,415
Your power of memory disappeared and
then came back gradually after the war.

161
00:10:45,507 --> 00:10:48,419
Yes, well, the brain
is an adaptable organism.

162
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:51,101
When one part dies,
another part takes over.

163
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:53,143
Good grief.

164
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:54,421
Frank.

165
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,225
Please, my dear.

166
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:01,816
Just so long as we know at last.
Just so long as we know.

167
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:05,024
Everything's going to be
all right from now on.

168
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:07,063
l can feel it.

169
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:40,103
(Clicking)

170
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:52,379
l was just closing down for the night,
Mr Traynor. Can l get you something?

171
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:55,140
No, l don't think so, thank you, Bradley.

172
00:11:56,187 --> 00:12:00,260
Grand old jobs. A better means
of signalling hasn't yet been devised.

173
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:02,861
- Didn't know you were in the navy.
- l wasn't.

174
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,222
But you know how to use
a signalling lamp.

175
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,458
So let's see, then,
you spent your war...here.

176
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:12,335
- ln St Oswald. Right?
- l don't see that's any of your business.

177
00:12:12,427 --> 00:12:17,103
Maybe not, but you know my passion
for mysteries, don't you, Bradley?

178
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:21,419
So you were a noncombatant,
so to speak?

179
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:34,060
By the way, l'll probably be vacating
my room some time tomorrow.

180
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:37,184
- l see, sir.
- My business here is almost completed.

181
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,622
Just a couple of loose ends to tie up.

182
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:47,098
Well, Commander,
are you going to speak at last?

183
00:13:47,187 --> 00:13:49,303
Old boy, just tell me what to say.

184
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:55,219
You are conducting
experiments with light.

185
00:13:55,307 --> 00:13:58,299
New experiments that you will
explain to me now,

186
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,696
unless you prefer l explain them to you.

187
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:03,096
You really think you've got that far?

188
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,781
l may still need to hear it
from your own lips,

189
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:08,825
but l wasn't joking when l told you
l had other proof.

190
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:13,185
Perhaps l could help you
with the experiment.

191
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:17,783
- Help me?
- Obviously it's in an imperfect state.

192
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:20,783
l've helped you in the past.

193
00:14:20,867 --> 00:14:23,381
Can't you believe anything l tell you?

194
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:27,096
l'm not here for the Nazis
or the Third Reich, but for Germany.

195
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:30,736
- Not for war, but for peace.
- l can see that you believe it.

196
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,783
Because it's true.

197
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:37,418
You know, in a funny sort of way,
l'd almost like to help you, Gottfried.

198
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:40,021
Then you will. You must.

199
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:42,780
No. Because l think you're deluded.

200
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:46,940
The Hitlers of this world aren't
overthrown without a hell of a push.

201
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:49,143
That's the reason there's a war on.

202
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:53,300
Then you give me no choice,
but to resort to my final alternative.

203
00:14:53,387 --> 00:14:54,945
What are you talking about?

204
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:59,100
Our arrangements for getting
out of England are particularly good.

205
00:14:59,187 --> 00:15:01,143
We made them with special care

206
00:15:01,227 --> 00:15:05,300
because we believed work of
unusual importance was going on here.

207
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:07,981
l shall have to leave in a short time now.

208
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:13,461
But l could always take you
with me to Germany.

209
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:18,341
- We've got to do something.
- Do what?

210
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:22,466
To find out whether the Germans
saw those papers, we've got to move.

211
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,777
What is all this about papers?

212
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:28,143
They're supposed to be in
Commander Traynor's office.

213
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,536
We have to find out
if the Germans saw them.

214
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:32,583
- ln his office?
- Yes.

215
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,623
- That's queer.
- What?

216
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:36,663
(Crashing)

217
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:40,785
- What are you doing?
- Kicking up a racket.

218
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:42,823
lf we get a guard in here...

219
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,659
- No.
- Right, Frank?

220
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:47,944
l suppose so.
Things were getting dull in here.

221
00:15:48,027 --> 00:15:50,587
You've both gone mad. Stop it. Stop.

222
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:53,140
(Eerie whirring)

223
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:56,344
- Frank. Frank.
- Can you see them again?

224
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:57,621
Yes.

225
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:01,982
Yes. They've started some trouble.

226
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:03,864
(Crashing)

227
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:06,541
They're throwing things about.

228
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,337
(Clattering)

229
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:23,983
Raus!

230
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,581
- You've got to help Frank.
- Against Graz?

231
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,784
lt's all talk with you.
We've got to do something.

232
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:32,823
Argh!

233
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,823
Simon, do something.

234
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,623
He's hurt. He's hurt again.

235
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,143
We must get to Commander Traynor.

236
00:16:43,227 --> 00:16:45,058
- But Frank...
- No time.

237
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:21,336
Commander Traynor.

238
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:27,900
l wouldn't do that if l were you, Bradley.

239
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:32,265
Murder on top of treason. They'd bring
back hanging just to oblige you.

240
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:38,856
What's your complaint? You've had
25 good years. And l'm not a policeman.

241
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:43,020
There's nothing that could be
called evidence against you.

242
00:17:43,107 --> 00:17:45,541
So run if you think that's a good idea.

243
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:47,583
Run for a long time.

244
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,056
Run forever.

245
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:52,103
Nobody cares, Bradley.

246
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,419
Frank!

247
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:08,624
Oh, Frank, please wake up.
You can't be hurt again.

248
00:18:08,707 --> 00:18:10,663
Papers, papers...

249
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:12,703
- What?
- ln the office.

250
00:18:33,747 --> 00:18:36,580
(Gottfried) The time has come.
Now we must go.

251
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:41,183
You don't seriously intend taking me
to Germany with you, Gottfried.

252
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,223
You don't imagine l'd go?

253
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:46,140
We'll silence you. Don't worry about that.

254
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:48,900
You've left me no choice. Graz!

255
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,623
Graz!

256
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:55,062
- lst Graz dort?
- Nein, Herr Kapitan.

257
00:18:58,747 --> 00:19:00,703
Hier.

258
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:14,543
Machen Sie sich so schnell als
moglich bereit. Warten Sie auf mich.

259
00:19:23,707 --> 00:19:28,223
They'll signal us when
the transport arrives. We'll wait outside.

260
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:43,185
The Commander's got the gun,
so we'll be all right.

261
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:46,384
All we have to do now is find out
about those papers.

262
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:48,423
- But we can't now.
- Why?

263
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:52,341
Gottfried's gone and he's
the only one who could have told us.

264
00:19:52,427 --> 00:19:55,021
Oh, Liz, l've been a fool. We've failed.

265
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:57,496
Papers...

266
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,342
So l've remembered what l had to do.

267
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,383
Frank, are you all right?

268
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:07,423
Yes. l'm fine.

269
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:15,544
Are those the papers
from the Commander's office?

270
00:20:15,627 --> 00:20:17,583
Yes.

271
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,623
He just said destroy the machine,

272
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:23,495
but l knew the papers would be
in danger where he put them.

273
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:27,660
So when l had a moment,
l went back to the office, took the papers,

274
00:20:27,747 --> 00:20:31,456
hung onto them, knowing l could put
them back when it was all over.

275
00:20:31,547 --> 00:20:35,381
You, Skinner,
you had the papers all the time.

276
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,345
- Me?
- Gottfried couldn't have seen them.

277
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:42,215
He was bluffing when he said he had
proof of what we were working on.

278
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:47,097
That's that, then. My work can go on.
You did a marvellous job, Skinner.

279
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,103
Marvellous?

280
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:52,337
Marvellous for you maybe.

281
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:57,421
What about me and Jean and Liz?
What about us?

282
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:01,543
Ah, the signal.

283
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:06,860
Well, l'm sorry l can't release members
of your staff we imprisoned in the shed.

284
00:21:06,947 --> 00:21:09,256
But l assure you they haven't been hurt.

285
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:11,303
You made...

286
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:22,700
- Frank.
- There's nothing more we can do now.

287
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:24,783
- We must go.
- But he's still ill.

288
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,220
You know what happens.

289
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:29,856
Commander Traynor finds him
and he goes to hospital.

290
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:33,496
And then one day he's my father.

291
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:36,303
Frank, l've got to go now.

292
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:41,898
- Go?
- Yes. But you'll be all right in the end.

293
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:44,539
Sure l will.

294
00:21:44,627 --> 00:21:49,223
Just finding that bit of memory
coming back must have been a mistake.

295
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:53,823
- Everything's getting blurred again.
- Frank.

296
00:21:53,907 --> 00:21:56,785
Oh, you fool, Traynor.

297
00:21:56,867 --> 00:22:00,576
l came here only for peace,
but you wouldn't believe me.

298
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,261
So if it's war you want, you can have war.

299
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:20,703
Why don't you kill me?

300
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:25,535
We're at war. We must die
rather than learn how to live.

301
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:37,186
You see? You don't want war after all.

302
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:41,776
But you won't have peace,
so that's where it ends.

303
00:22:41,867 --> 00:22:43,823
Until another day.

304
00:22:45,627 --> 00:22:48,744
- Gottfried.
- A better day, Commander.

305
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,783
Too late, Traynor.

306
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:53,783
Come back!

307
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:05,101
Please come round again.
l won't see you like this ever again.

308
00:23:05,187 --> 00:23:09,260
- Liz, it's no use. Let's go.
- l've got to say goodbye to him.

309
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,020
Frank, l'm going now. Really.

310
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:14,063
Going?

311
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:15,899
That's too bad.

312
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:17,943
Have a nice trip.

313
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:21,503
But, girlie, who are you?

314
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,623
(Liz sobs)

315
00:23:31,707 --> 00:23:34,380
Come on, Liz. lt's all over now. Let's go.

316
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,023
(Blizzard whooshes)

317
00:23:42,627 --> 00:23:44,583
(Gasps)

318
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:46,623
Simon?

319
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:49,463
What's the matter?

320
00:23:49,547 --> 00:23:52,664
lt's...so cold!

321
00:23:53,707 --> 00:23:56,016
l can't...breathe.
