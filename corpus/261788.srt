1
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:52,925
There's a trading post
35 miles northeast of here in the plateau.

2
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:57,831
Ten miles north of that is a landing strip.

3
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,532
We can have the film
pouched out to Delhi...

4
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:02,338
...then send it on to Calcutta.

5
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:06,612
Old Jonesy should be happy.
We're only two weeks late.

6
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:11,845
This has been such a wonderful adventure.

7
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:13,780
You made it wonderful.

8
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,760
Mark it down in your book.

9
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:27,860
September, the Amazon.
July, Egypt. Okay?

10
00:01:28,638 --> 00:01:30,731
But in the next five minutes, bed.

11
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:32,320
No!

12
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,264
Ready, boy? Come on. Come get it!

13
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:02,507
Come on. You want the ball, Thor?

14
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:05,546
You want the ball? Yeah, come on.

15
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,046
You ready?

16
00:06:07,316 --> 00:06:09,250
Go get it! Go get it!

17
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,280
Bring it back.

18
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:14,146
Come here, Thor!

19
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:17,419
Come here, give me the ball.

20
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:20,051
Come here!

21
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,897
Come back here! Give me the ball.

22
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,765
Thor, come here!

23
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,268
I'm going to get you, boy!

24
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:32,269
Where you going?

25
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,170
Where's the ball?

26
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:01,795
Nice doggy.

27
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:07,801
Nice doggy.

28
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:11,478
You're a big one.
Are you a dog or a horse?

29
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:14,447
It's not a horse. It's a German Shepherd.

30
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:18,612
He's a hell of a big German Shepherd,
ain't he?

31
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:20,814
May I help you?

32
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:25,154
- You must be the lady of the house?
- Yes, I am.

33
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,989
I see you got a young boy.

34
00:07:27,263 --> 00:07:29,754
You help him
get the best education possible?

35
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:32,766
I represent the Pacific Northwest
Magna Reading Project.

36
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:35,096
We have books
which studies have proved...

37
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:38,334
...are a major benefit towards
learning phonetics and vocabulary.

38
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:43,107
If I could have five minutes
of your time to show them to you...

39
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,440
...you won't be disappointed.

40
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:46,948
We're not interested
in buying anything right now.

41
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:48,847
No, please. Please.

42
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:52,083
Let me show you these books
my company has developed.

43
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:53,854
I have them right...

44
00:07:55,858 --> 00:07:56,847
...here.

45
00:07:58,361 --> 00:07:59,350
Whoa, lady!

46
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,958
You ever heard of a leash law?

47
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:05,365
Want to control that dog
before it bites somebody?

48
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,102
Thor!

49
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:15,101
Get off him!

50
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,475
Get him off me!

51
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:18,106
Go to the house!

52
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:19,442
Go on!

53
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,617
- Are you okay?
- No, he bit me!

54
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:28,985
Jesus!

55
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:30,355
Where did he bite you?

56
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,620
You've got a dangerous animal there, lady.

57
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:37,557
I'm suing.

58
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:42,728
You better get hold of a lawyer right away,
because you'll hear from mine!

59
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:50,968
You can talk to me.

60
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:54,147
I'm a lawyer.

61
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:00,519
Sit and stay down!

62
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:05,085
Did he bite you?

63
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:09,396
If he did, you really need to see a doctor.

64
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,923
Since you're on foot,
I'll drive you to the emergency room.

65
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:17,631
Why don't I take you to my own doctor?

66
00:09:17,707 --> 00:09:19,698
I got my own doctor.

67
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:22,937
All right.

68
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,377
I've heard enough, Flopsy.

69
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,379
Who's Flopsy?

70
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:30,652
A flopsy, Brett, is a con man
who does things like...

71
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:33,615
...pretending to get hit by cars...

72
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:38,019
...or intentionally provoking dogs
pretending to get bitten.

73
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:41,693
He threatens to sue people
or have their pets destroyed...

74
00:09:41,897 --> 00:09:43,694
...if they don't pay him money.

75
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:47,798
I've prosecuted plenty of these guys.

76
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,801
Then I'll see you in court.

77
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,800
Call Sheriff Bragg.

78
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:54,238
Tell him you're my son. He'll take the call.

79
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,711
Tell him we got a problem
and to send a deputy right away.

80
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,414
Well, Flopsy,
it's been really nice knowing you.

81
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:05,986
I guess I'll visit you in the slammer.

82
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,147
Stay!

83
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,552
My advice is to turn around
and walk away without saying a word...

84
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,425
...and without looking back.

85
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:19,667
You ain't heard the last of this.

86
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:21,661
I think I have.

87
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,531
Don't think of it as a total loss.

88
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:26,874
You learned a valuable lesson.

89
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:31,410
Do not mess with a lawyer
on her own turf.

90
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:40,945
Good night, Thor.

91
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:28,663
Lousy night shift.

92
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:32,556
Overtime.

93
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,712
23.7.

94
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,063
Hello?

95
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:52,335
Ted!

96
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,234
Hi, how are you?

97
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,642
Where are you?

98
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:02,840
You've been back that long
and you haven't called me? Creep!

99
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,411
Of course, we'd love to see you!

100
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:10,185
We'll be up to the lake in a few hours.

101
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,670
<i>I thought Uncle Ted</i>
<i>was in another country.</i>

102
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:33,779
<i>So did I.</i>

103
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:37,045
<i>He's been back three months</i>
<i>and he didn't even call me.</i>

104
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,612
<i>That flaky brother of mine!</i>

105
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:24,193
Hey, sis. How are you?

106
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:25,995
How are you?

107
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,434
Ever think of using a razor?

108
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,369
Maybe to slit my throat.

109
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:34,671
It's good to see you, Janet.

110
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:38,975
That's why you've been back two months
and don't tell me where you are.

111
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,375
You putz!

112
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,917
It's good to see you, too.

113
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:45,078
You shot up like a weed.

114
00:16:45,454 --> 00:16:47,854
Uncle Ted, can I shoot the rifle?

115
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,591
Maybe we better talk about that later.

116
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,851
Come on, let's go in and visit.

117
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:41,273
How's it going at the new firm,
Janeway and Samuels?

118
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:46,176
So far, so good. My caseload's lighter
than it was in the Chicago DA's office.

119
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:48,282
Pace is a lot easier.

120
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:52,450
And, frankly, I am so glad
to be out of criminal litigation.

121
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:56,013
How are you adjusting to small-town life?

122
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:58,117
For me, like that!

123
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,587
For Brett, it's not so easy.

124
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:03,028
He hasn't made any friends
in the neighborhood.

125
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:06,795
But Chicago's no place to raise kids.
Out here, it's safe.

126
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,995
You know, sis, I'm proud of you.

127
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,230
I have to take my hat off to you.

128
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,976
You're a full-time mom to Brett
and still work full-time at the firm.

129
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:16,475
It's just great.

130
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,819
You're not telling me something.

131
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:34,323
Things haven't been going good
since I got back from the jungle.

132
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:39,994
Marjorie's gone.

133
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:41,659
I'm sorry.

134
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:45,502
So now it's just me and...

135
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:48,404
...my shadow.

136
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:34,348
What?

137
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,561
Don't do that to me!

138
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:35,067
Good dog, Thor.

139
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:37,736
Shoot!

140
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:46,520
- I haven't seen him.
- I wouldn't worry about him.

141
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:49,751
Hey, sweetie.

142
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,930
Come say hello to your Uncle Ted.

143
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,704
That's Thor. Overprotective.

144
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,604
Maybe if he saw you more...

145
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:08,765
Come.

146
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:10,036
Come.

147
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:22,552
We're two of a kind, aren't we, old pal?

148
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:26,958
What did you do, spit in his Alpo?

149
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:29,887
He knows an old dog when he sees one.

150
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:52,581
You better get moving
if you want to get him home by bedtime.

151
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:54,415
You have a long ride ahead.

152
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:58,584
I want you to stay with us for a while.

153
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,821
I didn't realize how late it was.

154
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:02,486
I'm worried about you.

155
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:03,826
Don't worry.

156
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:05,489
- Just say yes.
- Yes.

157
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:07,760
Good. You're coming with us.

158
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:09,269
No, but I'll come by soon.

159
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:10,497
When?

160
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:11,561
I'll call you.

161
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,538
This week.

162
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:13,967
This week.

163
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:14,804
Good.

164
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:18,501
Come on.

165
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:20,504
Come on, Thor!

166
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:04,318
Hello?

167
00:24:04,493 --> 00:24:05,357
<i>Sis?</i>

168
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,893
How are you doing?

169
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:08,720
Yeah, you know...

170
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:13,728
...having you up here was really great.
It really lifted my spirits.

171
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:16,727
Frankly, sis...

172
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:17,894
...you know...

173
00:24:18,106 --> 00:24:19,266
...it's everything.

174
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:21,402
<i>It's everything.</i>

175
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:24,769
<i>I just wanted to tell you</i>
<i>how much I appreciated...</i>

176
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:26,837
<i>... your trip up here and...</i>

177
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:28,847
...family...

178
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:31,614
It's all we've got.

179
00:24:32,254 --> 00:24:34,188
Is there a problem up there?

180
00:24:34,256 --> 00:24:35,245
<i>Problem?</i>

181
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:37,685
Up here?

182
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:43,194
No problem at all.

183
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:50,869
Just...

184
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:52,930
...having you here, like I said...

185
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:55,775
...lifted my spirits.

186
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:59,040
<i>I reckon you're right.</i>

187
00:24:59,347 --> 00:25:01,577
So if it's not an imposition...

188
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:05,952
...maybe I can visit you.

189
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:09,056
Ted, you know
you are always welcome up here.

190
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:10,715
Here's what you'll do:

191
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:15,123
Park your Airstream in the backyard
and live out of my fridge.

192
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:24,969
Here's to family.

193
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,234
And having you next door to me,
like when we were kids.

194
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:31,571
It's nice to be out of the woods,
all the memories.

195
00:25:31,813 --> 00:25:33,405
I'm always right.

196
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:37,245
Yeah, it's really annoying.
Always has been.

197
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:39,916
Honestly, I'm glad you're here.

198
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:41,582
Me, too.

199
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,451
Get out of there!

200
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:56,936
Handcuffs?

201
00:25:57,005 --> 00:25:58,165
It's not what you think.

202
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,502
What are these?

203
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:03,172
"Maximum Security High-Tempered Steel."

204
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,236
- It's not what you think.
- Ooh, baby!

205
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:08,105
I think I better keep my eye on you.

206
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:10,774
It'll be interesting having you around.

207
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,453
Come on. I'll make dinner.

208
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:16,122
No, thanks, I'm going to go for a run.

209
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:20,193
I'm gonna keep a low profile tonight.
If that's all right with you?

210
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:24,125
Come and go as you please,
as long as you follow my rules.

211
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,864
Come on, Thor!

212
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:56,894
Good night, Thor.

213
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,667
What the hell?

214
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,506
What's going on?

215
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:49,583
Thor! What's wrong? What?

216
00:27:51,052 --> 00:27:54,283
Come on. You want to go outside?
Okay, out, out!

217
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:20,204
Thor, come on.

218
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,972
Good boy. Come on.

219
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:29,048
Let's go! Come on!

220
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,973
Come on!

221
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,710
What's with you?

222
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:34,878
What? What?

223
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:37,217
Let's go home. Okay?

224
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,491
You're such a baby. Come on, let's go.

225
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,821
Come on!

226
00:29:42,063 --> 00:29:45,191
What? What's the deal with you?
We've got to go home.

227
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,993
Jesus, ever heard of sleep?

228
00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:50,600
You crazy dog!

229
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:52,165
Come on.

230
00:29:57,412 --> 00:30:00,074
<i>You were at his funeral.</i>

231
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:03,574
<i>You had quite a long relationship</i>
<i>with your boyfriend.</i>

232
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,685
<i>We were together for three years.</i>

233
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:06,685
<i>Three years.</i>

234
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:10,917
Come on! Let's go!

235
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:13,360
You love baseball.

236
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:18,926
Where are you going?

237
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,374
Thor! Don't do that!

238
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:29,538
Come here, Thor.

239
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:33,536
Get over here, you knucklehead.

240
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:37,448
That wasn't very nice.

241
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:44,280
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>to bring you a special news bulletin.</i>

242
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:49,055
<i>Hunters and police are patrolling</i>
<i>a 50</i>- <i>mile square area in Timberline...</i>

243
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,462
<i>... as the curfew enters its third day.</i>

244
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,360
<i>Police revealed today the discovery</i>
<i>of a fifth dead hiker...</i>

245
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,267
<i>... in the woods near Timberline.</i>

246
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:02,076
<i>The five men and women were mutilated</i>
<i>by what authorities think is an animal...</i>

247
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:04,110
<i>... possibly a grizzly bear.</i>

248
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:08,143
<i>Hunters and bloodhounds are patrolling</i>
<i>a 50</i>- <i>mile square area...</i>

249
00:31:08,216 --> 00:31:11,117
<i>... and a curfew is now in effect</i>
<i>on Timberline.</i>

250
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:14,512
<i>This is Sarah Williams reporting for KBDL.</i>

251
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:46,448
Hi, Thor.

252
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:49,514
Come on, Thor.

253
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:50,783
Let's go.

254
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:54,522
Good morning.

255
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:56,994
Good morning, sis.

256
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:01,532
Why didn't you tell me
about the curfew up in Timberline?

257
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,195
The hikers who were killed?

258
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:05,864
That crazy animal that's loose up there?

259
00:32:06,207 --> 00:32:07,640
I just saw it on TV.

260
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,143
There were police everywhere.

261
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:13,646
Oh, that.

262
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:16,543
I was going to tell you about it
this morning.

263
00:32:17,552 --> 00:32:21,488
I guess this means you'll have to stay
until they lift the curfew.

264
00:32:23,224 --> 00:32:24,555
I guess.

265
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:26,887
You want some breakfast?

266
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:28,321
Yeah, great.

267
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:52,009
In good time, old boy.

268
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,580
In good time.

269
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:42,834
It's not funny.

270
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,969
He's turning into the Wolfman.

271
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,244
I'm sorry, it's the full moon part.

272
00:33:55,316 --> 00:33:58,979
In movies, the guy only turns
into a werewolf during a full moon.

273
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:02,181
That's the way it works.

274
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:05,157
When there's a full moon,
he turns into a werewolf.

275
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:06,955
Everyone knows that.

276
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:10,093
Why only the full moon?

277
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:11,923
Why not any moon?

278
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:16,633
Because that's the way a werewolf works.

279
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,138
You have to shoot him with a silver bullet.

280
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:22,772
I bet if you blew his head off
with a shotgun it would do nicely.

281
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:25,941
Don't you know anything
about werewolves?

282
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,842
I know you turn into one
if you get bit by one.

283
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:31,012
But the full moon part...

284
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:35,946
It's been my experience
that any moon will do the trick.

285
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,281
Werewolf-wise.

286
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:41,952
Have you ever met a werewolf?

287
00:34:43,631 --> 00:34:46,122
I've been acquainted with a few.

288
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:48,023
And you?

289
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:52,798
Come on. Everybody knows
there's no such thing as werewolves.

290
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:55,971
Well...

291
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,641
There you go.

292
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:02,982
Will you take the trash out
before breakfast, please?

293
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:05,745
Aw, Mom.

294
00:35:05,987 --> 00:35:07,978
Don't "Aw, Mom," me. Go.

295
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:23,829
So, what happened last night?

296
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:25,236
I don't know really.

297
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:29,104
Thor thought he heard something
in the woods, woke up the whole house.

298
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,344
Lucky you were in the Airstream.

299
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,510
Anyway, I finally let him out.

300
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:36,015
He ran into the woods
and he didn't come back.

301
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:39,745
I called him with that dog whistle
but he kept barking.

302
00:35:41,856 --> 00:35:43,255
So?

303
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:45,081
What did he find?

304
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,091
Nothing.

305
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,191
What do you think it was all about?

306
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:56,097
I don't know. I'm not worried.
He barks at practically anything.

307
00:35:57,872 --> 00:35:59,430
I don't know, Janet.

308
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:04,435
Big predators can travel long distances
if their habitat runs dry.

309
00:36:04,612 --> 00:36:07,547
Though there hasn't been
anything dangerous here recently...

310
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:09,639
...doesn't mean it'll always be safe.

311
00:36:10,384 --> 00:36:13,717
If I were you,
I wouldn't let Brett play out there until...

312
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:16,287
Until what?

313
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:19,526
There weren't supposed to be wolves
up where I am.

314
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,357
Look what happened to those people.

315
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,124
They said it was a grizzly bear.

316
00:36:23,464 --> 00:36:26,058
Wolves, grizzly bears, same difference!

317
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:28,567
You have to be a little more cautious.

318
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,670
Take the dog more seriously
and don't let him play out there.

319
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:35,465
Don't you think you're overdoing it?
Thor isn't helpless.

320
00:36:36,143 --> 00:36:37,906
How big is that dog?

321
00:36:38,312 --> 00:36:41,304
Get this, he's 105 pounds.

322
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:46,044
Do you know how big a gray wolf gets?
Try 200 pounds!

323
00:36:48,823 --> 00:36:50,848
Give me a break, Ted.

324
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:52,688
The dog barks at night...

325
00:36:52,827 --> 00:36:55,990
...and suddenly you've got
a 200-pound wolf at the door!

326
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,170
Are you feeling okay?

327
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:01,065
Piss off.

328
00:41:12,753 --> 00:41:14,618
Take your dog in the house, please!

329
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:17,552
I'd like to go for a run.

330
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,328
Come on.

331
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,761
Come on, it's bedtime!

332
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,703
Come on.

333
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:34,763
Come on!

334
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,410
Thor, come on!

335
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:42,679
It's bedtime!

336
00:41:43,017 --> 00:41:44,245
Come on in.

337
00:41:48,956 --> 00:41:51,254
Come on, come on. Good boy!

338
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:00,822
Come here.

339
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,593
What's up with you?

340
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:06,030
You be a good dog.

341
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,868
You be a good dog.

342
00:42:09,677 --> 00:42:12,237
Be a good dog. Yeah, I love you, too.

343
00:42:12,313 --> 00:42:13,245
Good night.

344
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,092
What's wrong, boy?

345
00:42:37,438 --> 00:42:38,928
You want to go out?

346
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,077
Hey, buddy.

347
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:57,645
Come here.

348
00:43:58,819 --> 00:43:59,979
Come on.

349
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:04,882
What happened to you?

350
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:11,563
Who cut you?

351
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:14,729
Oh, baby, who did this to you?

352
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:17,593
Come on, let's go clean you up.

353
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:20,496
Come on, it's okay.

354
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:23,536
It's all right. Come on, sweetie.

355
00:44:27,047 --> 00:44:28,981
It's okay, come on.

356
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,693
This is Janet Harrison, 43 Oak Creek Lane.

357
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,254
Hi, Sheriff.

358
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:30,065
Are you in there?

359
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,685
You in here?

360
00:46:02,042 --> 00:46:03,202
Nice, Ted.

361
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:39,004
<i>December 28, 1995.</i>

362
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:40,644
<i>Stateside.</i>

363
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,709
<i>Saw a doctor here.</i>

364
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,542
<i>Had blood test.</i>

365
00:46:44,852 --> 00:46:47,184
<i>Doctor couldn't identify strain.</i>

366
00:46:47,454 --> 00:46:49,945
<i>Some infection that isn't in the books.</i>

367
00:46:50,357 --> 00:46:52,689
<i>Had another blackout last night.</i>

368
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:54,917
<i>Woke up in the woods.</i>

369
00:46:59,366 --> 00:47:02,028
<i>December 29, 1995.</i>

370
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:04,960
<i>Blacked out again. Woke in the woods.</i>

371
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,198
<i>Blood on me.</i>

372
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:07,501
<i>Not mine.</i>

373
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:23,486
<i>May 18, 1996.</i>

374
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:28,718
<i>I have tried all medical solutions</i>
<i>to no effect.</i>

375
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:31,660
<i>There is no known cure in medicine...</i>

376
00:47:32,232 --> 00:47:33,631
<i>... but maybe...</i>

377
00:47:34,034 --> 00:47:36,730
<i>... just maybe, there's hope for me.</i>

378
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:39,798
<i>Janet and Brett came up to the lake today.</i>

379
00:47:39,907 --> 00:47:42,774
<i>To see her again did my heart good.</i>

380
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:50,506
<i>She has invited me to stay with her.</i>

381
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:54,115
<i>Perhaps if I spend time with her,</i>
<i>with my family...</i>

382
00:47:54,988 --> 00:47:57,252
<i>... this disease will go into remission.</i>

383
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,388
<i>Medicine will not stave off this disease.</i>

384
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:02,123
<i>Perhaps love...</i>

385
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:03,856
<i>... its restorative power...</i>

386
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:05,395
<i>... family love...</i>

387
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,864
<i>... will save me.</i>

388
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:09,197
<i>It's my last chance.</i>

389
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,708
Nobody...

390
00:48:55,782 --> 00:48:58,216
...makes a fucking fool out of me.

391
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,388
Here, doggie.

392
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:06,183
Here, poochie, poochie.

393
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:12,297
Come here, you frigging stupid dog.

394
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:20,534
Nice doggie.

395
00:50:17,464 --> 00:50:19,329
Where have you been?

396
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:27,169
Is this the man who approached
your place last month?

397
00:50:30,243 --> 00:50:31,642
Yes, it is.

398
00:50:32,846 --> 00:50:34,074
He's dead.

399
00:50:35,982 --> 00:50:37,973
His name is Jerry Mills.

400
00:50:39,152 --> 00:50:42,349
We found him a couple hundred yards
from your house.

401
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:46,150
He bore the marks of an animal attack.

402
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:50,323
He's been torn open
by a big animal like a wolf or...

403
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,894
Or a dog, is that it?

404
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:54,495
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:50:54,868 --> 00:50:59,271
I do recall you told me the last time
Thor almost took a bite out of him.

406
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,801
Maybe last night when Mills came back,
Thor attacked him again.

407
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,740
Thor got in a fight last night...

408
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:12,509
...with something or...

409
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:15,744
...someone.

410
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,125
He's got cuts all over him.

411
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:20,250
I see.

412
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,536
You know about these slayings
up in the Timberline area...

413
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,231
...those hikers that were killed?

414
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,040
Yes, Janet.

415
00:51:37,744 --> 00:51:40,008
That wouldn't be the same animal.

416
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,274
It would've had to travel 200 miles
from Timberline to get here.

417
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,077
That's not what I mean.

418
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,278
My question is...

419
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,248
...is it possible that...

420
00:51:52,425 --> 00:51:54,655
...they were committed by a human being?

421
00:51:57,631 --> 00:51:59,292
No chance at all, Janet.

422
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,525
They were done by a big animal.

423
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:07,267
No man could tear a person apart
the way that beast butchered those people.

424
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:10,099
The same with Mills last night.

425
00:52:10,777 --> 00:52:12,972
Wolves are the probable culprits.

426
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:15,707
Very big wolves, but not a man.

427
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,778
Not humanly possible.

428
00:52:18,618 --> 00:52:19,983
Why did you ask?

429
00:52:22,856 --> 00:52:24,050
I don't know.

430
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:31,458
I reckon that's all for now, Janet.
I'll be in touch.

431
00:52:32,499 --> 00:52:33,727
Thanks.

432
00:52:36,002 --> 00:52:36,832
One thing.

433
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:41,200
I know you love Thor.

434
00:52:42,275 --> 00:52:45,369
If he tore up Mills,
he was doing so to protect you.

435
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:51,242
Once a dog becomes a biter, gets a taste
for blood, he becomes dangerous.

436
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:54,310
I suggest you consider shopping
for another hound.

437
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:19,140
Good morning, big guy.

438
00:53:20,914 --> 00:53:22,905
How are you doing this morning?

439
00:53:23,884 --> 00:53:25,715
Want to go outside, Thor?

440
00:53:26,586 --> 00:53:28,520
Want to go outside?

441
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,863
Right to the Airstream.

442
00:54:27,914 --> 00:54:30,178
Where were you last night, Ted?

443
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,220
I went for a run.

444
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:36,953
All night?

445
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,416
You didn't see anything?

446
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,016
Hear anything?

447
00:54:47,634 --> 00:54:49,033
Get him off me!

448
00:54:49,235 --> 00:54:50,361
No! Don't!

449
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,805
Get in the trailer!

450
00:54:55,976 --> 00:54:56,965
Get him off!

451
00:54:57,978 --> 00:54:59,468
Thor, get off!

452
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:05,782
Get in the house! I can't hold him back!

453
00:55:11,124 --> 00:55:12,887
Come on! Come on!

454
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:18,863
Thor, come on! Bad dog! Bad dog!

455
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:21,896
Stop it! Come on! Calm down!

456
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,465
Get in there!

457
00:56:05,378 --> 00:56:06,208
Come on.

458
00:56:07,547 --> 00:56:09,208
Come on, sweetie.

459
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:13,512
Come on. It's okay. I'm sorry.

460
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:14,484
Come on.

461
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:15,810
Come on.

462
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,919
I'm sorry, babe.

463
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,226
Hold his head.

464
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:23,461
It's okay, Thor. Go on.

465
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,724
Okay. Good boy.

466
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,197
I got him.

467
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,798
Thor! Come back!

468
00:56:30,336 --> 00:56:31,997
Brett, come here.

469
00:56:32,072 --> 00:56:35,405
They have to take him.
There's nothing we can do about it.

470
00:56:36,076 --> 00:56:36,838
Don't go!

471
00:56:38,044 --> 00:56:39,409
They'll kill him!

472
00:56:41,214 --> 00:56:43,978
They have to take him, Brett.
He's dangerous!

473
00:56:44,084 --> 00:56:46,746
No, it's not true, Mom! It's not true!

474
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,485
Let go!

475
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,064
Mom, they're going to kill him!

476
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,565
He's going to die!

477
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:04,630
Let go!

478
00:57:07,273 --> 00:57:10,037
I'm sorry.

479
00:57:13,446 --> 00:57:14,777
It's okay.

480
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:24,879
It's okay.

481
00:57:26,893 --> 00:57:28,417
Come on! Come on!

482
00:57:37,303 --> 00:57:38,793
It's okay.

483
00:58:59,085 --> 00:59:00,746
It's probably genetic.

484
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:02,384
It happens with Shepherds.

485
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,286
It's the way they breed them.

486
00:59:08,094 --> 00:59:09,925
Thor's pedigreed.

487
00:59:10,597 --> 00:59:12,758
It doesn't happen to pedigrees.

488
00:59:21,608 --> 00:59:23,667
You'll have to see a doctor for that.

489
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:27,104
No, I won't. It's just a flesh wound.

490
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,116
No veins or tendons were cut.
Nothing I can't take care of.

491
00:59:34,554 --> 00:59:36,488
You'll need a tetanus shot.

492
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:41,123
I can give myself a tetanus shot.

493
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:48,394
Excuse me a second.

494
01:00:12,558 --> 01:00:14,719
I'm sorry about your dog, son.

495
01:00:22,335 --> 01:00:23,666
Come here.

496
01:00:28,741 --> 01:00:30,402
Come here!

497
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,194
There'll be other animals in your life.

498
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,462
It's time for bed.

499
01:01:08,114 --> 01:01:09,547
I'll be right up.

500
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,797
I guess I'll turn in, too.

501
01:01:45,752 --> 01:01:47,652
If I ask you a question...

502
01:01:49,756 --> 01:01:51,519
...will you tell me the truth?

503
01:01:52,024 --> 01:01:53,423
Of course.

504
01:01:56,262 --> 01:01:57,661
Where's Marjorie?

505
01:01:58,765 --> 01:02:00,096
Seattle.

506
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:08,542
Come on!

507
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:11,721
Shit!

508
01:05:43,155 --> 01:05:44,247
Company?

509
01:05:44,991 --> 01:05:47,050
Just what I came here to get away from.

510
01:05:50,162 --> 01:05:51,356
Sis?

511
01:05:51,998 --> 01:05:53,056
Janet?

512
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,490
Is it you?

513
01:05:55,668 --> 01:05:56,999
Yeah, Ted.

514
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,767
What the hell's going on?

515
01:06:02,775 --> 01:06:05,073
Playing Nancy Drew, are we, sis?

516
01:06:07,013 --> 01:06:09,811
You caught me
at a rather awkward moment.

517
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:11,440
I was just about to...

518
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:13,847
...restrain myself.

519
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:17,649
But now that you're here,
that might be somewhat pointless.

520
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:20,487
You're going to come clean
with me right now!

521
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:33,099
Family love, Janet.

522
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:37,835
I thought it could save me...

523
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:39,372
...but I was wrong.

524
01:06:42,214 --> 01:06:44,375
But, hey, we all make mistakes!

525
01:06:45,685 --> 01:06:48,176
You sent the dog to the pound, Janet.

526
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:51,279
I warned you.

527
01:06:51,957 --> 01:06:54,892
I told you I shouldn't be here,
but you wouldn't let me go.

528
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:58,455
You wanted to play big sister.

529
01:06:58,964 --> 01:07:00,727
You had to be right.

530
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:04,569
You always have to be right,
but this time you're wrong!

531
01:07:06,572 --> 01:07:09,234
You should have listened to the dog, Janet.

532
01:07:09,909 --> 01:07:12,139
He was trying to protect you.

533
01:07:35,434 --> 01:07:38,665
Handcuffs.
I was going to use these on myself.

534
01:07:40,506 --> 01:07:41,939
Can you believe that?

535
01:07:42,108 --> 01:07:43,370
What's happening?

536
01:07:45,277 --> 01:07:49,509
They were supposed to keep people
from finding out about my...

537
01:07:50,116 --> 01:07:51,879
...private affair.

538
01:07:52,451 --> 01:07:54,009
My mistress.

539
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,851
Oh, my God.

540
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:57,585
But, you...

541
01:07:57,957 --> 01:07:59,982
You already know, don't you, sis?

542
01:08:06,132 --> 01:08:08,191
Yes, you know...

543
01:08:10,202 --> 01:08:14,730
...the handcuffs won't keep my little secret
a secret any longer.

544
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,668
Come back here!

545
01:08:18,878 --> 01:08:21,346
You stupid bitch!

546
01:08:42,835 --> 01:08:44,325
I'll get you out!

547
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:45,659
Come on!

548
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:19,632
Come on!

549
01:09:21,006 --> 01:09:24,373
All right, Thor, come on! Quick!
You're free! Let's go!

550
01:09:39,124 --> 01:09:40,455
We've got to go!

551
01:12:37,136 --> 01:12:38,865
Get the fuck off my son!

552
01:15:10,889 --> 01:15:11,878
Do it.

553
01:15:13,825 --> 01:15:14,814
Finish it.

554
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,036
Hey, there, big guy.

555
01:15:35,581 --> 01:15:37,412
You saved us.

556
01:15:37,916 --> 01:15:40,077
You're our hero, Thor.

557
01:15:50,262 --> 01:15:51,251
Good dog.

558
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,965
Mom, is everything okay?

559
01:15:59,104 --> 01:16:00,867
Yeah, everything's okay.

560
01:16:01,006 --> 01:16:02,598
Everything's okay.

561
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:05,269
Gee, Thor, hello.

562
01:16:08,547 --> 01:16:10,105
Come here.
