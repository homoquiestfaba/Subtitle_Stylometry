did he say anything?

548

Why? Why did
he kill himself?

549
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:27,867
Because
he couldn't handle it.

550
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,764
I told him
we had to deal with it,

551

that what you would have done?

Maybe.

anything wrong.

714

Did you know that?

Yes.

716
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:42,840
If the truth were to come out
now, it would destroy her.

717
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:48,804

have told the truth.

he was asking for something.
