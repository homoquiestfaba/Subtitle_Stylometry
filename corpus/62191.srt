343
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:43,104
Wait. Where are we going?
Are you just gonna leave her here?

344
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,837

345
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,080

l"m her boyfriend.
She"s coming with me.

349
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,653
We-We"ll wait for you
in Wayne"s apartment.

350
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,126
Oh, this is so not cool.

351
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,856
- Okay, everyone, we need
everyone to step back, please.
- Come on. Let"s just go.

352
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:10,867
- Does anybody know this woman?

No! No, l"m not okay.

- You were friends with Mary.
- Mm-hmm.

356
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,922
[Sniffling]
She was a nice old lady.

357
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,655
She never caused
any problems for anyone.

358
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,039
I used to bring her food
when she"d show up.

359
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,603
Mary ever talk to you
about anything?

360
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,773
Sometimes. Why?

361
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,785
Anything in particular?

362
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,683
Where are we going?

363
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,056
- Am I under arrest or something?
- No, you"re not under arrest.

364
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,996
Look, if l"m not under arrest,
then I-I want you to take me
back to my friends now.

365
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,590
- I can"t do that.
- What?

366
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:54,229
I know my rights, okay?
I didn"t do anything.

367
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,237
You"re in protective custody, all right?
A material witness.

368
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,776
A witness to what?
I didn"t witness anything.

369
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,083
In fact, I was busy
talking with you...

370
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,710
when either of those things
happened, if I recall.

371
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,754
A lot of this probably
isn"t making much sense.

372
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,790
It"s making no sense!

373
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,952
l"m just a cop caught up
in the middle of this.

374
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,323
l"m not Mary.
I can"t do her job.

375
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:22,196
What does Mary have to do
with any of this?

376
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,958
She was protecting you.

377
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,240
The homeless lady?

378
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,638
- From what?
- All I can do is tell you
what she told me, okay?

379
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:39,547
You"re goin" through a change,
a kind of a transformation right now.

- [Growling]
- And because of that, someone"s...

381

something is trying
to track you down.

382
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:50,785
Why?

383
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,099
To mate with you.

[Gasping]

385
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,098
You"re saying...

386
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,906
that there"s
something out there...

387
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,040
who wants to hook up
with me?

388
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,617
Uh...

389
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,676
- Let me go!
- Josie! Don"t!

390
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,779
Let me go, damn it!
What do you want from me?

391
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:23,623
I understand this is a lot to deal
with right now. I understand.

392
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:27,165
Just... l"ve seen
what that thing can do.

- [DarkWolf Howling]
- Looking for you.

395
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:41,009
It"s not gonna stop...
till it finds you.

396

[Whimpering]
What am I supposed to do?

397
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:50,511
[Crying]
I didn"t ask for any of this.

398
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,752
It"s not your fault, all right?
It"s not your fault.

399
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,865
Look, I can do my best
to protect you, okay?

400
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,527
But protecting you
isn"t gonna solve the problem.

401
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,604
- I gotta find this thing.
- [Whimpers]

There"s a... a book.

407

A book Mary gave me...
I lost it.

408
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:43,641
- She gave me a book to give you.
- To give to me?

409
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:47,008
Yeah. She said it would
explain everything you
were going through tonight...

410
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,946
the transformation, the...

411
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:54,712
[Sighs] I must"ve left it back there
when I was running around.

412
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,779
Obviously, it would"ve explained
everything a hell of lot better
than I can.

- Some cop took her away in a car.

Apparently, she"s some sort
of witness or something.

- You pick up on things real fast, huh?

Oh. Yeah, I called her cell phone.
I got her voice mail.

454
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,266
She never turns it on.
So what are we gonna do, sit around?

Tell me about it.

waiting for her to call. L"m
gonna go find out where she is.

[Thud]

1033
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:36,837
Looks like some fleas are gonna
be looking for a new home tonight.

1034
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,228
We"re done. It"s over.

1035
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,574
So what do you think
you"ll do now?

1036
01:29:09,611 --> 01:29:11,511
I don"t know.

1037
01:29:11,613 --> 01:29:15,014
I don"t think l"ll
stay here after all this.

1038
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:18,552
Maybe l"ll go home and spend
some time with my family.

1039
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:21,178
- Sounds good.
- Yeah.

1040
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:23,185
Think you"ll tell them
about all this?

1041
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:25,653
[Sighs]
When they"re ready.

1042
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,694
- Yeah.
- Maybe.

1043
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:30,526
I guess no one"s really ready
for something like this, huh?

1044
01:29:30,599 --> 01:29:32,794
- No, not really.
- Yeah.

1045
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:39,563
Mary would"ve been proud.

1046
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:41,734
You were a great protector.

1047
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:44,539
Thanks.

1048
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,649
- You need a lift?
- No, l"m okay.

1049
01:29:56,758 --> 01:29:58,953
Stacey and Wayne
are gonna pick me up.

1050
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:02,621
Okay. All right.
Take care of yourself, all right?

1051
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,631
Yeah, you too.

1052
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:12,005
Hey, Pagano.

1053
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,175
Why"d the werewolf
cross the road?

1054
01:30:15,277 --> 01:30:17,006
Why?

1055
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:18,909
He saw you coming.

1056
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:22,982
No more stupid jokes, Turley.
