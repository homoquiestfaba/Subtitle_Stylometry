1
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:15,164
LIFE WITHOUT LOVE IS LIKE EATING
FRENCH FRIES WITHOUT THE KETCHUP

2
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,004
Try this. It's my Creme Brul
made with bird's nest

3
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,730
Thank you

4
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,809
Like my new toothbrush?
You can't buy these in Hong Kong yet

5
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:05,183
You know what would go
really good with this?

6
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,424
A cup of your coffee!

7
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,093
It's brewing!

8
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,323
Pick the yellow. I love yellow!

9
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,435
I'll put it away for next time

10
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,576
Helen, you're early!

11
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,100
Come on, you knew he had a girlfriend

12
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,175
You have no right to feel this way

13
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,712
Everyone says I'm wasting my time...

14
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,247
but I know things will work out
if I just believe

15
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,049
Faith... and perseverance

16
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,048
Wait...

17
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:44,720
Sorry Sorry

18
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:45,746
Jack

19
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,849
Don't walk away like that, please? Jack!

20
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,721
Jack

21
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,059
What a jerk!

22
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,095
It's amazing what some girls
let their boyfriends get away with

23
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,350
Order up!

24
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,391
Hello, Miss Chan. Your table is waiting

25
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,791
Thank you This way please

26
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,010
Hello

27
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,283
You're late. Everyone's already seated
And...

28
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,213
Here, I brought a few samples
for your beautiful girlfriend

29
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,155
Tell her to put it on
before going to bed

30
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,121
What is it?

31
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,126
It's a new alpha-hydroxy
Great for the complexion

32
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,060
Trust me. She'll love it

33
00:04:56,095 --> 00:05:00,691
on a bed of mixed greens
we add heirloom tomatoes...

34
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,627
Ah, did I mention
the heirloom tomatoes...

35
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,738
Why are you so late?

36
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,737
It's about time

37
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:24,483
Happy Birthday!

38
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,389
Thank you! Thank you!

39
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,688
Alright everyone...

40
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,694
Moon, tonight is to say thank you...

41
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,596
For agreeing to design
Chi-On's clinic... and...

42
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:33,721
Happy Birthday!

43
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,465
My turn!

44
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,425
Thank you, Helen

45
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,870
You do everything so well...
even arrange birthday parties

46
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,298
Make a wish
Hurry and find that perfect man

47
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,346
Finding a man is easy
I want someone who challenges me

48
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,183
Men are no match for us women
They spend all their time flirting

49
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,546
Right, Chi-on?

50
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,229
Jill, sit down and join us

51
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,333
Yeah. Take a break!

52
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,929
I can't. I still have to make the coffee

53
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,839
Jill, are you alright?

54
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:18,835
I'm fine

55
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,547
What are you doing there?

56
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,885
I'm here to see Jason

57
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,685
Jason? He's not here

58
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,150
Wow... what's wrong with your eye?

59
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,754
Let me guess... Cyclops... Captain Hook?

60
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,690
No? Oh! I caught you
cheating on your boyfriend!

61
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,528
I'm not in the mood for your jokes!
Do you know him?

62
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,999
Do I know him?
Maybe you should go see your doctor

63
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,532
I told you. This is Jack
the chef who'll be taking my place

64
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,906
Are you out of your mind?

65
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,470
What do you mean taking your place?

66
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,741
You're the one who's lost her mind

67
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,214
Hey! People in love
usually see the world more clearly...

68
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,585
But you're like a zombie

69
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,654
Oh... I remember you!

70
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,564
Does she always talk
like a scratched record?

71
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,530
That's her charm

72
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,963
Her name is Jill

73
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,669
Mysterious Jill

74
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,332
A nearly extinct Jill

75
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,842
So called extinct Jill

76
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,846
Helen, you've gone out
with this guy for so long...

77
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,080
Would you ever consider marrying him?

78
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,449
Yeah... why aren't you two
married already?

79
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,789
Actually, I'm thinking of dumping him

80
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,528
I'm not joking
I want to be a girlfriend...

81
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,732
not a watch dog

82
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,088
Huh? Oh, charades...

83
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,755
Nightmare on Elm Street!

84
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:19,490
Pig on a spit!

85
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,668
Oh, I know! Rain Man!

86
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,029
Bruce Lee...

87
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,501
That's what I was going to say!

88
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,837
Enter the dragon

89
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,701
Cat scratch fever? Hit you in the head?

90
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,471
Return of the Zombies!

91
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:37,707
Ms. So says...
there's light at the end of the tunnel

92
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,814
I never thought Helen would leave him

93
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,946
Don't get so excited

94
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,025
It may be a trap
to lure you out from the dark

95
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,794
Helen must know
otherwise why would she do it here?

96
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,492
Already nosing around
other people's business?

97
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,094
Don't be surprised
if you're next to get dumped

98
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,703
What did you tell her about me?

99
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,838
It's like this...

100
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,972
Jill's entire body has been infected
by a terrible virus: Love

101
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,850
Let me introduce you to someone
more normal. This is Apple

102
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,148
He means me!

103
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:16,588
Move!

104
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,586
Pure. Never been touched...

105
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,005
Tell him to take his womanizing ways
someplace else

106
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,730
Okay... It's amazing

107
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:36,935
Who wants to try? I do!

108
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,604
Me too! Ladies, wait your turn!

109
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,408
Will you take our picture first?

110
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,812
Of course... smile everyone!

111
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,548
I don't see the problem
He loves taking pictures

112
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,645
It could be good advertising
for the restaurant

113
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,680
If he loves bathing
will you put a bath tub in here?

114
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,751
Good idea

115
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,927
Hmmm... I should ask him about that

116
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,486
What is this?

117
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,358
The bottle you have...

118
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,196
that's not what I'm drinking
I'm drinking this... whiskey

119
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:06,671
That's castor oil
which I used to massage my tired legs

120
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:10,239
Hey, I hear castor oil helps get rid of
blood clots in the heart!

121
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,052
Can we get started?

122
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,317
Sure. Fatty, remind me to order the wine

123
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,989
Why are we even here?

124
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,051
We never get anything done
at these meetings!

125
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,290
What are you doing?

126
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,457
I'm SMS'ing my girlfriend
telling her you won't let us go

127
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,761
I don't want her
to bug me about not calling

128
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,798
Hello, Faye?

129
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,608
No, there's no meeting tonight

130
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,600
See you. Bye

131
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,610
Hey, what kind of a person are you?
How can you do such a thing?

132
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,173
You said she bugs you, right?

133
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,707
Okay, let's talk about the menu please

134
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,179
I have a question

135
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,955
Does anyone ever order
the Rice with Duck Blood?

136
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,828
Customers with taste will appreciate it

137
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,557
If people are looking for magic shows...

138
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,967
they can go to the circus

139
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,371
Anything else? No? Good. Meeting's over

140
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,913
That dish is why her boyfriend
always comes here

141
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,748
I can't believe you wanted
to take it off the menu!

142
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,617
Jason moved back to Hong Kong
to be with his wife

143
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,953
And Daddy turned against
his own father to marry Mom...

144
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,862
See, Fluffy, people in love
do crazy things all the time

145
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,162
Give me the bottle, please?

146
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,369
Miss, are you getting in or out?

147
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,578
I know, Fluffy, you despise him too

148
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,514
He thinks he can charm
his way out of everything

149
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,817
To love someone like that
would spell anyone's doom

150
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,548
Jackpot!

151
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,194
Fluffy, your friend has diarrhea

152
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,628
It figures...

153
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,198
It figures I'd run into you

154
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:24,442
I expect you to replace
that bottle of wine by tomorrow morning

155
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,904
This is Hungarian wine
We don't serve this in the restaurant...

156
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,313
I don't steal!

157
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,943
What is it about me that you hate?

158
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,819
What do I hate?

159
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,515
Your disregard
for other people's feelings

160
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,651
Typical woman
What does that mean?

161
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,619
It means people see
what they want to see

162
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,022
Save your acting for someone else

163
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,930
Forget it, it's useless talking to you

164
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,235
You think you're so cool!
Like you can have any woman you want

165
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,563
Fluffy, bite him!

166
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,401
Hey... what are you doing? Help!

167
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:19,593
I'M NO LONGER THE OTHER WOMAN!

168
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,395
I still can't decide

169
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,769
Coco or Chloe?

170
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,967
I'm not hungry. You go ahead

171
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,371
Are you even listening to me?

172
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,082
The telephone will not ring not matter
how hard you stare at it

173
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,716
I'm just checking for messages

174
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,087
There are 14 million SMS messages sent
every day in Hong Kong

175
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,787
If you didn't get one, that means
he's not thinking about you...

176
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,722
It used to be the wife
who waited for the husband to come home

177
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,629
Now it's the mistress...

178
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,634
who waits for a call at midnight

179
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,669
Tea, please

180
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,302
He got dumped in front of
all his friends

181
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,500
Wouldn't you be upset
if that happened to you?

182
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,506
Listen...

183
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,308
Helen was with him 5 years
and look how things ended up

184
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,147
What does that tell you?

185
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:14,951
Nothing

186
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,313
Actually, Helen never knew about me

187
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,553
That's the understanding
I have with Chi-on

188
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,398
Okay, so you and Chi-on
have an understanding

189
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,691
Pass the pickles...

190
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,429
Then tell me, are you
or aren't you his girlfriend?

191
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,535
Of course I am

192
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,096
But nobody knows, right?

193
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,074
Oh, it's supposed to be a secret

194
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:42,712
That's right

195
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,816
Cover your ears my baby!

196
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,375
Your Godmother is out of her mind

197
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:51,719
Do you realize...

198
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,024
how ridiculous you sound?

199
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,485
Privacy is important to Chi-on

200
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,929
I'm the only one who understands this

201
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,423
That's why he gave me a set of his keys...
I believe in him

202
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,696
You do?

203
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,336
Where's my Hello Kitty?

204
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,919
Excuse me. Hello

205
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,398
I went to your place this morning...

206
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:16,096
with a cake
I didn't snoop around or anything

207
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,204
I just put it in the fridge and left
Hello?

208
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,338
I'm here

209
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,045
Where did you put my new toothbrush?

210
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,176
Jill, sorry

211
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,688
I have a patient here. I can't talk. Bye

212
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,951
OK. Bye

213
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,964
What did he say?
What happened to Hello Kitty?

214
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,059
It's just a stupid toothbrush

215
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,904
Where did you go?

216
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,242
I haven't seen the Jill I love
since you met this guy

217
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,370
Hey, you used to
say how pregnant women...

218
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,007
reminded you of those little blowfish...
Now you're one of them!

219
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,711
Mr. Lau, party of four

220
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,309
Got it. We'll see you at eight...

221
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,413
Before and after... What do you think?

222
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,186
I want you to move everything back. Now!

223
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,593
I can't. It's my turn...

224
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,290
Hey, let me help!

225
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,997
We can fit in two more tables like this

226
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,199
Nothing wrong with more business
right...

227
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,266
Ready... smile!

228
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,502
By the way, your tiramisu ice cream
is a little hard today

229
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,871
He's an embarrassing, disgusting
utter fake...

230
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:37,014
What did you put
in your Black Forest cake?

231
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,688
The usual. Eggs
Bittersweet chocolate...

232
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,158
Did you use nuts of any kind?

233
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,420
You're amazing!
I used a new recipe and yes

234
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,796
The cake had peanut butter in it

235
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,130
Peanut butter?

236
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:52,501
Aren't you aware lots of people
are allergic to nuts?

237
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,405
No, I didn't Bye!

238
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,999
I have to take my friend
to the hospital now

239
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,377
Hello...

240
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,876
You know if you take
your tiramisu ice cream...

241
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,376
And add a little peanut butter
it's excellent!

242
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,787
Moon won't be joining us tonight
You know why?

243
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,322
Something terrible happened
at her boyfriend's house!

244
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,032
I know all about it!

245
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,057
You know?

246
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:29,131
Her new boyfriend fed her black forest
cake made with peanut butter inside

247
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,674
Now her face is swollen
like a real full moon!

248
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,838
A peanut butter pastry
filled by a black heart...

249
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,541
No wonder her face is red and puffy!

250
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,647
Sorry...

251
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,451
Happy Birthday!

252
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,660
Very smooth. And full bodied...

253
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,562
You like it?

254
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,122
There's lots more

255
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,327
All made with love by our Big Sister

256
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,198
You aren't having any?

257
00:18:57,236 --> 00:19:00,137
I can't! Another drop
and my heart will stop beating

258
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,230
Bye...

259
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,970
Ahhh, perfect timing

260
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,503
Remember when we first spoke?

261
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,881
I told you Jill was an unusual girl...

262
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,113
When she feels down

263
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,315
she tries not to take it out on others...

264
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,621
Instead, she takes out her aggression
by making coffee

265
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,819
That's class!

266
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,959
What's bothering her?

267
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,865
What's at the root...

268
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,534
Of any woman's unhappiness?

269
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,336
A broken heart

270
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,502
Go ask her yourself...

271
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,481
Maybe today's not a good day!

272
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,447
Wow! Very bitter

273
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,788
Are you okay?

274
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,191
Just a little concussion, that's all

275
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,593
Want to have a discussion
about that concussion?

276
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,619
Please... get lost!

277
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,188
Wait! Are you walking your dog?

278
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,961
Did Jason tell you?

279
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,161
That's sweet

280
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,467
I've seen a lot of dogs before
But never an imaginary one!

281
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,265
Hey, boy... What's your name?

282
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,900
Please. Let Go!
Fluffy hates anything fake!

283
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,411
Please!
He knows there's nothing fake here

284
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,209
Good boy...

285
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:27,484
He can probably smell
who's broken hearted, too

286
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,082
Miss So, come quick!

287
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,818
What's the matter?

288
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,111
Pliers!

289
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,516
Thanks

290
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,819
He seems very nice... and clean

291
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,854
He's a co-worker. Don't get any ideas

292
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:21,163
Look at that bottom!
Round like your father's

293
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,436
That means he's responsible

294
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:25,773
You need to pinch him to see if it's firm

295
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,110
Your father's was soft...
That's why he passed away so young

296
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:35,011
It's just a loose screw
I think I can get it

297
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,464
Do you want to date my daughter?

298
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,729
My mom says thank you very much!

299
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,138
You're welcome

300
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,575
Why do you always change my words?

301
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,306
Stop it, Mother. He's not my type

302
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,838
How will you know
if you don't meet more guys?

303
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,341
Chi-on is not the only man out there

304
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,702
Do you have a girlfriend?

305
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,431
Yes. I do

306
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,340
Is she as pretty as my daughter?

307
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,442
They're both attractive...

308
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,815
But Jill is a little cuter

309
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,525
How so?

310
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:57,227
Well, to begin with, her mother is cute!

311
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,508
You should get to sleep
I'll clean this up later

312
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,776
I like your friend

313
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,549
Not only does he have a nice bottom
He has a wonderful heart, too

314
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,813
Look at you

315
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:30,364
Do you really want a man
who makes you cry?

316
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,776
You must have been hurt before?

317
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:51,752
It was nice meeting you. Goodnight

318
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:17,070
I'm not disappointed
I just don't see any future for us

319
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,884
No. That sounds ridiculous...

320
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,512
You'll know what you had when I'm gone...

321
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,117
We're over!

322
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,487
I wanted to leave a long time ago...

323
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,261
Ha! Don't be silly!
You have your life and I have mine...

324
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,772
Hello. Did we have plans today?

325
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,364
No

326
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,171
What's the matter?

327
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,075
Nothing

328
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,409
Are you alright? I'm fine!

329
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,043
After you lose a few pounds
doing the hula...

330
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,019
I want you to come back and cook for us

331
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,455
I'm not the one who needs to lose weight!

332
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,322
Besides, no chef worth
his salt has a flat tummy!

333
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,123
Anyway, with Jack doing the cooking
what alternative is there?

334
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,392
He's like the chef of all chefs!

335
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,194
If someone else praises my food
that's fine

336
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,394
But in the master's presence
I'm only an apprentice

337
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:11,561
You know what a master is?

338
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:15,232
It's what people call you
when it's time to retire!

339
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,605
By the way

340
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,974
This hat is now officially yours

341
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:23,503
That's right! Boys do the cooking
Girls run the dining room...

342
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,810
Where's Jill?

343
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,176
Hiding again?

344
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,088
God of Gourmet, we have come to
worship in your temple!

345
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:33,891
Oh... God of Gourmet!

346
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,359
Do you know the game rules?

347
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,557
You have to eat five meals
to receive a photo coupon

348
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,328
Then for $500 more, you can be baptized

349
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,267
You want to join? Yes!

350
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,964
Kids today
They must be controlled by evil spirits!

351
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,472
Let's make a member's pass first

352
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,666
This way Great!

353
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,373
That playboy of yours misbehaving again?

354
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,113
It's like you want to cry
but can't, right?

355
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,248
I'm not that kind of person

356
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:09,192
We might be having problems
but I'm not giving up on him

357
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:13,362
Friends or lovers
I'm in it for the long haul

358
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,093
Besides, if I did start over again

359
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,929
I'd probably end up with...

360
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,268
someone even worse... like Jack!

361
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,307
I think you have the wrong idea

362
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,174
He's not what you think

363
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,373
Did you know... I know all about it!

364
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,314
I know all about it!
Tell me. You're a man...

365
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,216
How many times can a man
hurt the same woman?

366
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,651
You tell me!

367
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,780
How hurt a woman can be, I can't tell

368
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,790
But how hurt a man can be, I do know

369
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,327
I don't like talking about
my personal life

370
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,392
But I promised Jason I'd work here

371
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,768
And I don't want you to be angry with me

372
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:59,842
My girlfriend, her name is Grace
She's an air-hostess

373
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,046
Last week
she said she was flying to London

374
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,382
I found out she was actually...

375
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,319
in Hong Kong with another man

376
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,892
She came to find me wearing her uniform
her luggage in tow...

377
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,020
pretending she just came back from work

378
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,460
We've been together now
for a year and a half

379
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:30,673
I thought to myself...

380
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,236
what did I do that
made her look for someone else?

381
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,040
We sat down and had a nice talk

382
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,708
Turns out...

383
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,587
she's been with this other man
for seven years

384
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:48,854
She was cheating on you
from the very beginning...

385
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,399
She said she doesn't mind
the extra effort...

386
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,630
That she'd love me no matter what

387
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,639
What are you laughing at?

388
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:15,449
Tonight, we're officially partners

389
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,422
I never realized there were
so many heartbroken people

390
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,557
What's his name?

391
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,221
Chi-On Wai

392
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,093
No, I'm talking about the dog

393
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,097
Him?

394
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,499
Oh, Fluffy

395
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:31,859
What breed is he?

396
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:36,135
Cocker Is he a seeing eye dog, too?

397
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,439
Perfect for people like me
who have eyes but can't see

398
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,804
You have such an interesting way
of putting things

399
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,213
Interesting is the only way
to live, right?

400
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,948
Hmm... smell that?

401
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,183
Stinky tofu!

402
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,226
How long have you lived in the area?

403
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,893
About two months

404
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,162
One day my girlfriend called

405
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,896
She said she had found her dream home

406
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,769
We moved in and had everything unpacked
within three days

407
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,741
That is so sweet

408
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,144
I actually thought we'd get married

409
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,636
Listen to me;
women expect men to be the aggressors

410
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,250
It's the law of the jungle
If you want her back...

411
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,743
you have to act the part
King of the Jungle!

412
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,656
King of the Jungle, huh?

413
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,060
I don't see you fighting for your man

414
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,324
Women who fight for their men
are considered cheap

415
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:39,903
Putting pride before love-
that's also cheap

416
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,271
Swallowing your pride and
losing your love- That's even cheaper!

417
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,107
You're quite romantic, aren't you?

418
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,305
Absolutely!

419
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,508
Hey! Here's to our little club!

420
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,049
Fluffy is afraid of strangers

421
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,986
Fluffy knows me
Look, he's wagging his tail

422
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,454
Come On... No!

423
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,753
Let me hold him He doesn't like it!

424
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,590
Oh no!

425
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,927
Fluffy!

426
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,024
He's breathing...

427
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,643
He's still breathing!

428
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:26,113
Hey, he's moving. He's responding...
He's waking up!

429
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,050
Hurry, let's take him to the hospital!

430
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,347
Where's the hospital? Come on, let's go!

431
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,833
What are you doing?

432
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,996
Getting rid of old stock

433
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,630
Stop!

434
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,607
Canned food is edible for like ten years!

435
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,633
We can't use any of this

436
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,805
Would you dump your girlfriend
this easily?

437
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,213
I was the one who was dumped

438
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,717
Then let's not talk about broken hearts...

439
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,377
I'm not talking about me!

440
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,415
What's going on?

441
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,053
You're acting very strange today

442
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,063
I'm happy for you, silly...

443
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,655
There's someone here to see you...

444
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,444
Stop holding those cans!
She's waiting for you

445
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:36,476
It's not easy to come
looking for your man three times!

446
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,213
I have nothing to say to her

447
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,351
What's there to say?

448
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:46,056
Go down there and give her a kiss

449
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:49,123
Women hate men who don't know...

450
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,635
when to take action

451
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,694
Your lips are so dry!

452
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,605
See? You really do miss her

453
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,913
Mine hasn't called in two days

454
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,782
Consider yourself lucky

455
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:17,155
Men don't always know
how to express themselves

456
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:18,992
It could be he's still thinking of...

457
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,931
how to say what he's feeling

458
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,560
Trust me!

459
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:44,912
Jack is such a lady killer!

460
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,357
I would faint if
someone kissed me like that

461
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,359
Wow, looks like we're having
a French kiss marathon!

462
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,231
Look at her!

463
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,534
You'd think she's
never been kissed before

464
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:04,507
If Chi-on kissed you like that
you'd be even more excited!

465
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:10,009
Where's the fire? And who's Jill So?

466
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,678
That would be... me

467
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:37,774
THE FLOWERS ARE BEAUTIFUL...

468
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:44,305
CHI- ON IS MY SPECIAL ONE

469
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:55,883
Hello! Hi... Jill

470
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,417
I'm running late

471
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,327
Can we have dinner another time?

472
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,298
I'm already here. You want me to go back?

473
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,823
No...

474
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,697
Never mind...
I'll be there as soon as I can

475
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,668
I brought some T- Bones
and a nice bottle of...

476
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,335
I'll talk to you later, okay? Bye!

477
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,404
Okay

478
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:30,890
Where did I put my keys?

479
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,675
Am I bothering you?

480
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,609
No. What's wrong?

481
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,502
I wanted to ask you...

482
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:26,005
If a woman waited for two hours
on your front doorstep...

483
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,347
would you think she's totally cheap?

484
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,350
That depends on what she looks like!

485
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,550
Hey, if it's you, no problem

486
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,893
I'm serious

487
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,490
Chi-on said he was running late

488
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,126
But even if he called from Shanghai
he should be here by now!

489
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,068
Look at that face!

490
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,128
It's like a little child
complaining about her allowance

491
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,571
Very cheap!

492
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,940
That's better

493
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,142
If a man calls to say he's running late
he's already stressed

494
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:02,118
If he sees you with that face
he'll turn around and leave

495
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,485
When you see him, don't ask...

496
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,648
Where were you?

497
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,317
Who were you with?

498
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,485
And don't say anything about
how long you've been waiting

499
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:12,655
Trust me

500
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:15,131
He'll appreciate it

501
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,231
How's this?
Sir, here's your food delivery!

502
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,235
Give yourself a little more credit

503
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:27,300
I'm one of Charlie's Angels
and I'm here to guard your house!

504
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,346
That's too silly

505
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,282
You spent two hours in a meeting
on top of thinking about me...

506
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,118
you must be exhausted!

507
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,027
How's that?

508
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,861
Irresistible

509
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,972
You look irresistible yourself
Grace will be happy to see you

510
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,740
Who is that behind you?

511
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,208
Huh? Oh. That's my cousin

512
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,904
That's my cousin Hi!

513
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,469
Hi This is Jill

514
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,378
Jew? A Chinese Jew?

515
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,212
Cut it out! He likes to joke around

516
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,514
I have to go
Grace and I are seeing a movie tonight

517
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,747
Bye! Bye!

518
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,915
Bye! You hung up
before I could even say goodbye

519
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,117
I said it for you

520
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,349
What are you doing?

521
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,359
I want the truth
I have ways of making you talk!

522
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,591
Oh. You mean Jill?

523
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,825
Who's Jill? A friend...

524
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,798
The girl just now!

525
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,027
Does Grace know?

526
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,831
Know what? She's a co-worker

527
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,430
If she's just a co-worker
why are you sweating?

528
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,997
Look at you! Didn't you just shower?

529
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,270
I'm sweating? Really?

530
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,141
Leave me alone, will you?
There's food in the refrigerator

531
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,406
And don't drink my beer!

532
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,746
As a servant of God
I can control my desires

533
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,410
I wonder what there is to eat?

534
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,614
Your phone's been ringing

535
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,155
Really?

536
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,691
You're not going to answer it?

537
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,122
Do you want me answer the phone
or talk to you?

538
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,538
Why don't you answer your phone?
Who is it?

539
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,713
You want me to answer the phone...
or talk to you?

540
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,007
I've been waiting outside a long time

541
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,546
I know... let's eat first, okay?

542
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:55,015
I have something to ask...

543
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,890
How about if we order dessert first?

544
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:00,990
Do you love me?

545
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,295
Do you really love me?

546
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,172
You're a big part of my life

547
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:15,372
Without you, I would be devastated

548
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,943
Who do you love more? Him... or me?

549
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,317
You must know...

550
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,715
I've told you before...

551
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,659
You're the only woman
who truly understands me

552
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,259
You're avoiding my question

553
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,360
So what if I say I like him more...

554
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,929
or I like you more?

555
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,702
It doesn't make any difference

556
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,005
What matters is I love you
Isn't that enough?

557
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,572
I've worked all night

558
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,176
Can I drink some water first?

559
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,024
But it is important! It's important to me

560
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,660
What's the matter?

561
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,629
Afraid of losing me?

562
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,731
Even if you don't believe me...

563
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,835
you should believe in yourself

564
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,740
I know it's difficult at work
finding enough time to think about me

565
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,280
Sorry

566
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,249
Sorry! I just wanted to say
I know you're exhausted

567
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,285
Don't be silly

568
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,853
Actually
it's me who should be saying sorry

569
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,390
In fact...

570
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,995
Stop. Don't say it. I trust you

571
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,006
Grace...

572
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,468
Hi Hi

573
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:20,951
I think moving the tables around
has brought us bad luck

574
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:28,159
Don't spit it out!

575
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:32,498
Relax! Release your tongue
Swirl it around...

576
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,271
Taste the complexity?

577
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,874
That's my Double Shot Espresso
The Yin and the yang...

578
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:44,745
A beautiful combination of
bitter and sweet

579
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:46,814
I never looked at it that way

580
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,878
I hope Grace can appreciate it

581
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:54,186
Whoever tastes my espresso...

582
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,857
Will never be happy
with regular coffee again!

583
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,462
Hold it right there!
I want to take your picture

584
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,594
Come on! The lighting is beautiful
No

585
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,397
Stop! I look so tired

586
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,960
No you don't. Come on... No

587
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,471
Are you kidding? She doesn't look tired?

588
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:10,996
Get out of here!

589
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,478
By the way, have you met your rival?

590
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,545
No

591
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,981
Why not?

592
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,011
Scared?

593
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,313
Of what?

594
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,687
I don't know. Scared

595
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,031
I know a place near here that
has fish balls spicier than this!

596
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,431
Shall we get go some when we're done?

597
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,163
Of course you have to
treat me after this. Here!

598
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,671
You won't feel as nervous
after your tongue goes numb

599
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:48,638
Everyone should be free to choose. What
she does is actually none of my business

600
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,147
You're giving up? After all this!

601
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,007
It's not that

602
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:57,982
I just can figure out
if it's him or me who was cheated

603
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,349
This is not the time to be polite

604
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,551
You're better than him

605
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,219
Hold this

606
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:07,263
This is not a competition
but a chance for her to choose!

607
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,429
10 o'clock!

608
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,032
3 o'clock! Got it! 3 o'clock!

609
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,336
What are you doing turning right?

610
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,899
You said 3 o'clock!

611
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,774
She lied to me!
She said she was working the day shift!

612
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,110
Come on, turn right, no... turn left

613
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,638
Okay Turn left

614
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,207
Turn left
That way! Let me drive

615
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,720
Hey, no...

616
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,347
Ahhh! The fish balls!

617
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,277
Excuse me... have we met?

618
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:01,177
So you are...

619
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,319
Sorry, I have a girlfriend

620
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,197
What a coincidence

621
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,161
You two know each other?

622
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,926
This is my boyfriend, Ching-yeung Sung

623
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,599
This is Jack
He's the chef I told you about

624
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,108
Oh, that's you!

625
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,668
Grace always talks about your...

626
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,805
wonderful Italian food

627
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,408
I didn't know you make Indian food, too!

628
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,517
We'll have to try your cooking
when we get back

629
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,514
Isn't your plane leaving soon?

630
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:39,283
Right!

631
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,917
Sorry, I'm off to Shanghai
Nice meeting you!

632
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:46,794
Call me when you arrive

633
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:47,797
I will

634
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,298
Bye Bye

635
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,794
You came to see me off?

636
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,101
What's the matter?

637
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,741
This is all so complicated
Why don't you choose one of us?

638
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,716
Why?

639
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:10,686
I'm happy with how things are

640
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,949
I love you just the same as I love him

641
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:15,987
Sorry, then consider me a selfish person!

642
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,919
If you were getting married
who would you choose?

643
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,526
Say something

644
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,046
Did you really say marriage?

645
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,675
I'm so impressed

646
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:44,776
These are for you

647
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,517
I don't eat this stuff

648
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:50,754
It's not for you to eat
It's so you can channel your anger

649
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,388
I'm not angry

650
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,990
You don't have to pretend in front of me

651
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:57,633
You're a good catch
You don't deserve to be dumped

652
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,508
I'll be in the next aisle if you need me

653
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,282
I'm sorry...

654
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:19,419
Look at this!

655
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,447
Go change your smelly shirt!

656
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,190
Hi, Jill! Out shopping for clothes?

657
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,596
No, I'm here doing my laundry

658
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:35,228
You have the strangest sense of humor

659
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,570
Don't tell me
you're buying that ugly shirt

660
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:41,409
Actually, I think this is pretty nice

661
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,271
Chi-on really likes the steaks here

662
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,215
We're cooking at home tonight

663
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:50,912
Don't look so surprised

664
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,683
These things happen very quickly

665
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:01,788
It must suck being the other woman, huh?

666
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,460
You know?

667
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,567
I must say, I admire the way
you put up with the pain

668
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:12,033
Actually, I don't see
what's so special about the cook

669
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,500
What do you mean?

670
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,103
Jason told me all about him

671
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,978
He has a girlfriend, right?

672
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,841
Relationships in your business
are so complicated

673
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,953
He's a professional chef
not just an ordinary cook

674
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,717
Whatever...

675
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,752
I've got to go
Chi-on is waiting for me outside. Bye

676
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,230
What happened?

677
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,290
Nothing

678
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,962
Come on! You don't have to
pretend in front of me

679
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:41,971
I said nothing's wrong!

680
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:43,270
There must be something

681
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,274
Here. You need it more than I do

682
00:50:56,787 --> 00:51:02,987
IT'S FINISHED. THE DREAM IS OVER...

683
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,426
Should I save this
for the security guard?

684
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,737
Throw it away!

685
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:15,566
Hang on!

686
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,804
Let me handle this

687
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,104
You want to help me make a delivery?

688
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:22,578
Delivery?

689
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:24,012
That's right. Come on

690
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:33,287
Don't! He'll know it was me
when he sees the cake

691
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:35,849
That's the point
Men are different from women

692
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:38,453
He won't know what you're thinking
You don't tell him

693
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:39,621
Really?

694
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:41,487
We can ask Fluffy to keep watch

695
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,355
Fluffy, keep an eye out for us!

696
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:52,966
Nothing better than freshly- Baked cake!

697
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:54,408
Let's not do this!

698
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,234
Come on!

699
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:58,677
Take it! Ready...

700
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,308
I can't do it... I can't!

701
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:01,010
One... two...

702
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:19,098
I wish I could see his face
when he gets back

703
00:52:21,105 --> 00:52:22,003
What's up?

704
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,940
Will you help me
watch Fluffy for a second?

705
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:02,135
Go ahead. Say it

706
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:04,339
Say what?

707
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,742
I'm pathetic

708
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,119
There's nothing wrong with being in love

709
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,552
It could be he really is
your special one

710
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:21,229
No matter how serious or how casual
a relationship may be...

711
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,791
I believe there's one person specially
made for each of us...

712
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:27,831
And I'm specially made for her...

713
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:31,839
Not her, her, her or her!

714
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,943
I want to believe that...

715
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:38,207
But everyone out there is special

716
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,181
Look at him, him, him and him
They're all special

717
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,822
My first job was in a hotel in Shanghai

718
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,091
Chi-on was a voluntary doctor
in the countryside nearby

719
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,830
He would come in every night
sit at the same table

720
00:53:58,302 --> 00:53:59,894
That's how you two met?

721
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,539
What time is it?

722
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:04,666
I don't know

723
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,103
Damn! My battery ran out!

724
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:15,841
I have plenty of battery
but no one's called

725
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:18,549
That's even worse, huh Fluffy?

726
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:21,819
Let's go!

727
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,771
What are you all doing? Avoiding work?

728
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,842
Have you seen Jack
and his girlfriend in there?

729
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:42,277
That's right
His girlfriend is getting married!

730
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:45,381
Incredible!
That fool finally touched her heart

731
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,576
You got it half right. He's a fool

732
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:50,281
She's getting married, but not to Jack!

733
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,255
I can't believe she had the nerve to
bring her fiance here!

734
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,018
Two guys fighting over one girl?
We'd better call the police

735
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,823
I think we'd better call an ambulance

736
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:01,490
Look at Jack
He looks like he's ready to collapse

737
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:04,023
She even asked him
to make the wedding cake!

738
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,728
How many layers shall we get?

739
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:06,736
It's up to you

740
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:10,931
I'm sorry. We're very busy
this time of the year

741
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,839
We can't help you with your cake

742
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:15,538
But Jack already said yes

743
00:55:16,547 --> 00:55:19,038
I'm the Catering Manager
and I say we can't do it

744
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:29,451
Please. I don't mind paying more

745
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,417
I said we don't have the time!

746
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:40,193
Grace is getting married...

747
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:42,865
It's my gift to the two of you

748
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:47,238
This is probably the best wedding gift
we'll receive!

749
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,074
Thank you My pleasure

750
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,689
Wow! This is gorgeous

751
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,187
Help me put it on

752
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,353
I think if a man gave me this as a gift...

753
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,293
I would marry him right then and there!

754
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:41,896
Excuse me

755
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,163
Thank you

756
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:50,867
Would the lady like to wear it now
or should I wrap it?

757
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,972
Wrap it, please...

758
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,043
It's a wedding gift

759
00:56:58,448 --> 00:56:59,346
That's right

760
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,945
It's a wedding gift. Thanks

761
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:05,485
Thanks

762
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,586
Grace will like it, won't she?

763
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,598
Of course she will. She'll love it!

764
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,345
Don't put too much sugar in it
Grace doesn't like things too sweet

765
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:38,647
You've said that 86 times
Say it again, I'll use salt

766
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:44,689
Stop!

767
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,623
You can't use a machine
to mix the filling

768
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:48,722
You have to use... this

769
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,126
This is a four layer cake
It'll be dawn if I mix it by hand

770
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,098
That's why you're here!

771
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:56,638
I thought you expected that
Here, let me help you

772
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:41,517
No thanks

773
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,367
I wish I were Grace

774
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,602
She's getting a rich husband...

775
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:03,731
and an ex-boyfriend who still loves her

776
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:06,568
All women should be so lucky

777
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:09,736
Listen, when you get married

778
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,680
I'll make you a cake as well

779
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:15,281
I'm going to hold you to that promise!

780
00:59:22,092 --> 00:59:23,389
It's all over your face too...

781
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,929
I know I shouldn't be saying this...
What?

782
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,168
Until she says 'I do'...

783
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:35,767
You still have a chance

784
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:05,961
It's Jack!

785
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,093
What's he doing here?

786
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:08,968
Not a clue

787
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:12,841
I knew he would come for me!

788
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:30,548
Where are you going?

789
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:40,536
I was supposed to fly to Italy today...

790
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,697
I'd like to change the destination

791
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:44,704
Will you check the schedule?

792
01:00:45,342 --> 01:00:47,902
I want to go to Paris instead

793
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:50,172
When is the next flight?

794
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:56,911
Tomorrow's perfect!

795
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:58,378
Okay

796
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:19,007
Does coffee taste better in the bathroom?

797
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,174
Try it

798
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,439
You never used to drink espresso

799
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,511
And you never gave me gifts
like this before

800
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,789
Why did you ask me back?

801
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:10,518
I didn't

802
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,722
Say that again

803
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,925
I didn't ask you to come back. I'm sorry

804
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,532
You're sorry?

805
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:23,263
Didn't you just honk your horn...

806
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,866
And tell the whole world
how much you love me?

807
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,201
If it weren't for you, I'd be in Italy
right now on my honeymoon!

808
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,211
Why don't you go?

809
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:34,176
Because you showed me
you'd do anything to have me!

810
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:36,512
If I wanted a stupid necklace like this
I could tell Ching-yeung...

811
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:39,613
And he would buy
two hundred of them for me!

812
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:47,794
If that's how you feel...

813
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:50,466
this is a big mistake

814
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,258
Why did you come for me?

815
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,302
I was delivering your call

816
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:12,348
You have another woman!

817
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:29,130
Are you two lovebirds fooling around?

818
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:30,696
I'm not fooling around. I'm at home

819
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,765
You're one lucky guy...

820
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:35,203
I'm actually on a special mission

821
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:37,303
What kind of special mission?

822
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:41,581
I'm delivering a hot order
of rice with duck blood

823
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:44,217
He's back?

824
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,790
Yes. He said he was dying to have some

825
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,452
Maybe this is his way of saying sorry

826
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:53,529
Really?

827
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,724
Good luck then!

828
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,129
Okay, bye

829
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,196
Bye

830
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,703
Hello...?

831
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,812
You're a mommy now

832
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,716
I just had a nightmare...

833
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:21,117
I woke up and I couldn't find my baby!

834
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,022
That's not true. Look at this huge belly!

835
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,459
My goddaughter will be just like me
big and strong!

836
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,752
See? She's already got
my sense of humor...

837
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:30,391
She's teasing you. Don't cry

838
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:33,502
Why are you so pretty today?

839
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,263
We catered an event this afternoon

840
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:39,303
Look at me! I look like a pig beside you

841
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,768
That's not true

842
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,708
Your complexion is
as pink and flawless as ever

843
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:45,374
You're even prettier today than
when I first met you

844
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:46,712
How can a mother...

845
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,184
with such a pretty face be ugly?

846
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:50,382
Really?

847
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,281
Of course! Don't cry
The tears are ruining your smile

848
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:54,654
Wipe them off

849
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,585
You're not thinking of leaving me
are you?

850
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,355
I'm afraid you want to leave me!

851
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:09,405
Where to, miss?

852
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:10,302
Special One...

853
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,103
Is that in Hong Kong or Kowloon?

854
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:13,435
Hong Kong. I mean...

855
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:15,000
Take the tunnel to Hong Kong Island

856
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,033
Okay

857
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:41,200
Drink lots of water
I want your skin to stay soft and pretty

858
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:49,408
Bye

859
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,913
Mom, why is dating so painful?

860
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,590
I don't ever want to see
another man again

861
01:06:06,529 --> 01:06:08,690
What are you saying?

862
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:13,326
Blood is thicker than water

863
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:16,471
I still don't understand
what you're saying

864
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:20,770
I said your breasts are touching
your belly button

865
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:33,584
Did you hear the news?

866
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,348
Grace left her fiance
at the altar to be with Jack

867
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:38,651
Jack is such a charmer
I'm not surprised

868
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:41,860
Yeah, but did you hear the rest?
Jack dumped Grace

869
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,696
You've counted it so many times...

870
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:47,828
It's all there... $12,000

871
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:50,237
OK, everyone. Let's get started

872
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:54,069
I'm sure all of you know
this Thursday is my birthday

873
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,601
I don't want you to stress about
what to buy me...

874
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,273
and let it affect your work so I...

875
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,282
I already have a present

876
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,949
Last year whatever I gave her
she didn't like

877
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:05,250
So this time I got a gift certificate
Is that smart or what?

878
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:06,915
I've already done my job

879
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,548
Two years ago I bought 10 presents
So now I give you one every year

880
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:10,957
Besides, how could I forget
your birthday since...

881
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:12,621
it's the same day
as my wedding anniversary?

882
01:07:12,896 --> 01:07:15,956
Better to owe the loan sharks than
to owe her a birthday gift!

883
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:18,695
What should I get you?

884
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:22,931
I can make the cake

885
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,573
These things have been planned
for a long time ago

886
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,207
That's right!

887
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,769
Sure. Of course

888
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,170
Jack...

889
01:07:31,948 --> 01:07:34,007
how did it go the other night?

890
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,675
I... what about you?

891
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:39,448
Was Chi-on happy when he got the rice?

892
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:43,257
Uhhh, you want some coffee?

893
01:07:44,928 --> 01:07:45,519
Sure

894
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,327
What are you doing?

895
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,098
This is my secret recipe

896
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:58,505
55 beans make the perfect cup of espresso

897
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,065
Not one more...

898
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,339
Not one less

899
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,070
Sounds like a relationship

900
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,513
Two people should be equally important...

901
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:11,720
Not one more, not one less

902
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:22,363
The coffee's working
I feel much better now

903
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:25,795
Remember, the secret is 55 beans

904
01:08:35,812 --> 01:08:37,143
See you at my party?

905
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:40,849
I'll be there

906
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:58,126
Father, your friend needs help

907
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:04,602
Go get changed!
The kids are waiting for our presents

908
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,410
Hurry up!

909
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:12,079
Am I overdressed...

910
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:14,749
For a birthday party?

911
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:17,983
You look fine

912
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:21,356
Are you going to a funeral?

913
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:23,716
Oh... I can still change

914
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:25,461
Shut up!

915
01:09:25,862 --> 01:09:27,489
Wait for me at the elevator

916
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:34,202
Do you know what you look like now?

917
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:35,029
What?

918
01:09:35,138 --> 01:09:36,662
You look like
you're getting ready to see Nina

919
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:37,900
Who's Nina?

920
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,431
Your first love in high school

921
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:44,344
Very sweet, this 2nd puberty of yours
Say happy birthday for me

922
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,205
I get to change I do the packing

923
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:18,410
Wow, the food is beautiful

924
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:19,437
Wanna try?

925
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:26,488
It's delicious!

926
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:28,222
It's so good!

927
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:29,849
Chief...

928
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:32,290
you look very sexy tonight!

929
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,897
Sexy enough that you'd date me?
Definitely!

930
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:39,230
Oh! It's so tasty!
Hey! Let me take a picture of you

931
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:45,697
The forgotten boyfriend!

932
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:53,749
Surprise!
It's a birthday cake from Chi-on!

933
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:56,250
It's beautiful!

934
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:57,377
Happy birthday, Jill!

935
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,912
This cake was specially designed by
Francois De La Bouche!

936
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:09,523
I know the guy
He means Frenchy Fry de Bullshit!

937
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:14,193
The cake looks sort of brownish
doesn't it?

938
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,337
It does!

939
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:19,466
I saw this exact one in an MTR cake shop!

940
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,941
Never mind. Let's cut it!

941
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:34,217
Thanks. I'll take that!

942
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:38,912
Chief, don't you think
your hands are a little low?

943
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,253
And you seem to be...

944
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:44,691
What? Happy?

945
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:46,558
I was thinking... enchanted

946
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:48,987
Go find yourself another partner!

947
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:54,797
Hello...

948
01:12:55,638 --> 01:12:58,106
Really?

949
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,711
Everybody's enjoying your cake

950
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:18,787
I broke up with Moon. We're over

951
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:27,698
Come with me to Shanghai together...
spend a few months

952
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,428
Go where with you?

953
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,072
I thought you'd be happy

954
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:37,111
I'm extremely happy... today

955
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:41,175
Jill, I promise...

956
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:43,117
I'll make you happy forever

957
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,186
Sorry

958
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,665
You're kidding! I'll come right away

959
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:00,293
Who was it?

960
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:02,334
I have to go. It's urgent

961
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,340
Where's Jason?

962
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,445
The police decided
not to charge him with vagrancy

963
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:33,329
Hungry?

964
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:35,500
No

965
01:14:40,276 --> 01:14:41,300
What's the matter?

966
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,342
You think I'm crazy?

967
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,523
Lydia loved dancing salsa...

968
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,162
But after we got married

969
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:07,533
we never had time for dancing

970
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:14,507
I would always say...

971
01:15:17,113 --> 01:15:20,173
wait till the business settles down

972
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:26,452
When it settled down I told her...

973
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:29,952
wait till I retire

974
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:41,869
When she got sick...

975
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,430
I told her

976
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:53,682
the chemotherapy will heal you...

977
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,349
It's only six months
to our 20th anniversary...

978
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:04,121
Wait and we can gather
all our friends to dance

979
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:16,127
But she couldn't wait

980
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:19,968
Now I'm retired

981
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:26,637
She dressed like this...

982
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:30,578
Whenever we went dancing

983
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:34,847
Lydia was like my shadow

984
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:39,224
She'd know where to go
if I just moved a finger

985
01:16:40,396 --> 01:16:42,193
I used to think I chose her...

986
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:46,829
because she was the one woman
I could live with

987
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:53,541
Only later, dancing alone
did I realize...

988
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:57,172
she was my only partner

989
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:05,645
I married her because...

990
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:10,219
she's the one woman I can't live without

991
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,414
I think he'll have
a huge hangover tomorrow

992
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:10,582
Good thing your phone
still had battery when he called

993
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:01,002
I'm freezing

994
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:02,864
You feel cold?

995
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:05,106
Would you turn up the heat?

996
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:10,811
How's that?

997
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,217
I have a present for you

998
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,652
Why didn't you say so?

999
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,293
Where is my present?

1000
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:28,159
It's around here somewhere...

1001
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:34,763
What's that?

1002
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:38,735
This...

1003
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:40,968
helps promote circulation

1004
01:19:41,844 --> 01:19:44,039
I try and hang upside down
at least 20 minutes every day

1005
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:46,442
You look like spider-land

1006
01:19:46,682 --> 01:19:49,742
Spider-land? You mean Spiderman

1007
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:50,747
Are you drunk?

1008
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:54,447
Where is my present?

1009
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:05,595
Is this it?

1010
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:10,705
Let's open it

1011
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:22,783
Fluffy!

1012
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:30,658
Look! He already likes you!

1013
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:33,086
He's adorable! Yes, he is

1014
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:35,597
Do you like him?

1015
01:20:35,631 --> 01:20:36,859
I love him!

1016
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,636
Thank you
This is the best birthday present ever

1017
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:25,010
I'M NOT LOOKING
TO CHANGE THE WORLD...

1018
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:31,919
I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED
BY THE RIGHT PERSON

1019
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:03,643
Where are you going?

1020
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:05,246
I'm late

1021
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:07,614
It's six in the morning!

1022
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,123
I have a tai chi class!

1023
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:57,230
You want to have lunch today?

1024
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:02,042
Jack, I need some time

1025
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:06,843
Actually, last night when I carried you...

1026
01:23:07,249 --> 01:23:08,546
you fell asleep

1027
01:23:09,284 --> 01:23:12,082
Nothing happened

1028
01:23:19,628 --> 01:23:20,822
Hold on a second

1029
01:23:23,866 --> 01:23:26,528
It's me
Have you thought about what I said?

1030
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:28,634
What's that?

1031
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:30,532
The trip to Shanghai...

1032
01:23:35,811 --> 01:23:36,778
Listen, Chi-on...

1033
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:38,507
Jill, I won't take no for an answer

1034
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:40,514
Meet me at the restaurant
Six o'clock tonight

1035
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,385
I know everything
seems impossible right now

1036
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,455
But love is actually very simple

1037
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,195
Last night was a rising tide of emotions

1038
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:59,200
I'm afraid of getting seasick

1039
01:24:00,102 --> 01:24:01,501
Jill, I won't disappoint you

1040
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:05,640
See you at the restaurant
Six o'clock. Bye

1041
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:13,190
You're getting prettier every day

1042
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:17,970
Hurry, Fatty! It's getting good!
What's up?

1043
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,635
No way

1044
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:25,946
This is for you
You can't buy these in Hong Kong yet

1045
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:32,778
I've always been afraid of
missing out on life

1046
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:36,156
That's why my suits
are made in London...

1047
01:26:36,725 --> 01:26:37,783
My car is from Italy

1048
01:26:39,061 --> 01:26:40,926
I bet they won't break up

1049
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:42,020
I bet they will

1050
01:26:42,064 --> 01:26:43,053
I second that

1051
01:26:43,098 --> 01:26:44,395
I'm with Jason

1052
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:47,568
I bet they won't break up

1053
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:48,432
You know it!

1054
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:49,630
I still bet they will. Right?

1055
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,307
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1056
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:58,368
I want to give it a try. Just you and me!

1057
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:05,177
The problem is you don't understand me

1058
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:12,517
I used to be scared of losing you
I never had the guts to speak up

1059
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:18,064
All I want is someone who loves me

1060
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,169
I bet they don't

1061
01:27:22,204 --> 01:27:23,068
You said it!

1062
01:27:23,105 --> 01:27:24,265
I have an idea!

1063
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:26,535
Even your idea won't break them up
That's right!

1064
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:32,012
A relationship doesn't mean being with
whoever happens to be around

1065
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:36,316
It should mean being with that one person
you can't live without

1066
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:15,049
Thank you! Thanks!

1067
01:28:17,392 --> 01:28:19,019
I'm never betting on you again!

1068
01:28:20,195 --> 01:28:21,560
What's up?

1069
01:28:24,099 --> 01:28:25,191
It's beautiful

1070
01:28:26,268 --> 01:28:27,599
Were you naked when you posed for it?

1071
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:30,265
Were you at least wearing pants?

1072
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:39,138
Shoes maybe?

1073
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:09,503
No matter what happens...

1074
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:12,212
I just want to say
you'll always be my special one

1075
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:16,309
When you first put on that necklace

1076
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:19,520
I saw that smile of yours...

1077
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:29,154
I don't ever want to be
without that smile!

1078
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:36,904
Two words

1079
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:38,303
What two words?

1080
01:29:44,846 --> 01:29:45,835
Happy...

1081
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,478
Totally thrilled...

1082
01:29:54,256 --> 01:29:55,348
Very excited!

1083
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:00,487
Chicken skin!

1084
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:04,459
You think I have chicken skin?

1085
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,630
No... I think you're amazing

1086
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:15,969
Two words

1087
01:30:26,655 --> 01:30:27,917
Fluffy!

1088
01:30:30,392 --> 01:30:31,791
Good boy!

1089
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:34,056
Isn't the necklace...

1090
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:35,861
A wonderful collar for him?

1091
01:30:35,964 --> 01:30:37,124
Fluffy!

1092
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,033
I'd like the rice with duck blood, please

1093
01:30:48,343 --> 01:30:50,277
I'm sorry. We don't serve that anymore

1094
01:30:50,312 --> 01:30:53,247
We have a new dessert
'Ice Mountain on Fire'

1095
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,215
Our chef is demonstrating it
right over there!

1096
01:30:57,218 --> 01:30:59,448
It's gonna overburnt... 1, 2, 3

1097
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:03,284
I'll have one of those! Me too...

1098
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:08,255
OK Me too... Same here...

1099
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:12,865
Ice Mountain on Fire!
