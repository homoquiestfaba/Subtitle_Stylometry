what we are doing here

219
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:28,590
is completely wrong.

But has the Pi Delta
 sisterhood chosen you?

257
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:20,310
Are you worthy to wear
the badge of solidarity?

258
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,358
To forever pursue enlightenment
through partnership

259
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:25,663

- Yes.

261
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:30,581
- That was rhetorical, low life.

262

 will, for the record.

263

 adorning yourselves

265
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:42,898
in our Pi Delt letters to
 wear them with courage?

266
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:48,034
Are you ready to spit in
the eye of mediocrity?

267
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,340
And will you never get
 behind on your dues?

268

 like a response.

- It's tradition.

362
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:38,645
- It was one time and we
 know how that turned out.

363
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,168
- Do we?

364
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:41,735
That is why the
 sorority is failing.

365
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:44,781
There's a lack of
 tradition of what once

366
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:47,306
used to be a great
organization for girls.

367
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,960
This will be a
 bonding experience.

368
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,660
- You better hope that Auntie
 Snake doesn't find out.

369
00:21:56,706 --> 00:22:00,057
- Who cares? [chuckles]

370
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,368
- What do you think this
 task is all about tonight?

371
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,152
- Deathly boring, most likely.

372
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:14,245
- I want you downstairs
 and ready in five minutes.

373
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:15,421
Chop chop.

374
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:16,944
- We're missing it!

375
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,380
- You want me to kill
 myself over this?

376
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,250
- Give me that.

377
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:25,039
- Which one of you did this?

378
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,086
Was it you?

379
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:30,871
- I would never do
 something like that.

380
00:22:32,655 --> 00:22:33,830
- You?

381
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,789
- It wasn't little old me.

382
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:41,229
- Then it had to have been you.

383
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:49,803
- You guys, why does
 this have a blinking eye?

384
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,118
- Busted.

385
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,081
- You think they nailed us?

386
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:07,908
- Never.

387
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,391
- I think they nailed us.

388
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,135
- We'd love to stay
 and chat, ladies,

389
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:20,399
but we were just passing by.

390
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,227
- Just happened to be in
the neighborhood, huh?

391
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:24,751
- Yes, but not yours.

392
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:26,796
We were nowhere near
 this place, bro.

393
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:29,408
- Watching a little
 movie, were we?

394
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,713
- Movies?

395
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:32,236
Who has the time?

396
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:36,197
- No tea for me, thanks.

397
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:38,721
- So you'll have no problem
 when the police arrive.

398
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:41,245
- You called the po po?

399
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:42,246
- Oh no, no.

400
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,902
- Crapola.

401
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:49,515
- Look, busters,
 we're onto you pervs.

402
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:53,693
That was a strict violation
 of our personal privacy.

403
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:56,696
That was a severe offense
 in the eyes of the law.

404
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:58,915
- Punishable by death, fuckers.

405
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,743
- Please no, my mom
 will kill my dead body

406
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,179
if she finds out about this.

407
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:05,444
- Well, maybe there's a way out.

408
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,054
- We'll do anything.

409
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:08,229
- Anything.

410
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,100
- What do we say, sisters?

411
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,625
We give these numbskulls a
 chance to redeem themselves?

412
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,757
- I say we paddle their
asses till they cry

413
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:16,106
like little girls.

414
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,107
[boys laughing]

415
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:19,370
- Harsh, but negotiable.

416
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:23,374
- Just tell us
 what we need to do.

417
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:26,813
- You Neanderthals have a car?

418
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:28,858
- We got wheels.

419
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,862
- The three of you are
 gonna drive us somewhere.

420
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:34,385
- You kicking in for gas?

421
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:35,604
- After we kick in your ass.

422
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:37,519
- Okay, easy.

423
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:40,391
Just tell us where
 we need to go.

424
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,961
[upbeat music]

425
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:14,425
[upbeat music continues]

426
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,232
- Bowling, now?

427
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:40,016
- It's closed, you fool.

428
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:43,019
- Well, it won't
 be very fun, then.

429
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,152
- What's the task?

430
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:46,327
- I like you.

431
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:47,546
You get down to the bottom line.

432
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,025
- I like her bottom line.

433
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,638
Just sayin'.

434
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:55,336
- You all know
 the sordid history

435
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:57,991
of the Pi Epsilon
 Delta sorority.

436
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:02,996
The thievery, the unsolved
 murders of our legacy sisters.

437
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:06,260
All of that started right here.

438
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:11,265
This bowling alley is ground
 zero for all those years

439
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:13,702
of talking about us
 behind our backs,

440
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:17,532
phony baloney curses,
and body count bullshit.

441
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:20,753
All of that ends tonight.

442
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:24,060
- Piss on those
 curses and baloney.

443
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,542
- A Pi Epsilon
 Delta never wavers,

444
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:31,502
never shies from adversity
 and never gives up.

445
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,374
- Never, ever.

446
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:36,638
- Your task is the very same
 one given to those sisters

447
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,379
all those years ago.

448
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:41,904
Steal the trophy,

449
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:45,081
bring it back to the
the house, and with it,

450
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:48,694
bring back glory to the
 Pi Epsilon Delta Sorority.

451
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:50,478
- Yes! [claps]

452
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:52,219
- [Sarah] Come on
 girls, let's go.

453
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,617
Shit, I didn't count on that.

[light music]

455
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:13,414
Did you learn that in juvie?

[Bitsy exclaims mockingly]

457
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:20,769
- You coming with?

458
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:22,553
- No, we're staying out here.

459
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:23,642
This is your task.

460
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:25,905
- Suit yourself.

461
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:36,306
- Bro.

462
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,568
- It's a paradise.

463
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:41,311
- It's perfect.

464
00:27:46,142 --> 00:27:47,709
- Where's the trophy?

465
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:50,016
Let's nab it and get
 the fuck outta here.

466
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:52,018
- Yes, of course my fine lady.

467
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,281
But first?

468
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,848
- We have some fun.

469
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:57,980
- Tonight, ladies and gentlemen,

470
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,981
- [Guys] We bowl.

471
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:03,943
- I won't try nothing.

472
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:07,555
- Well, you might regret
 it if you don't. [giggles]

473
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:13,256
- Ugh, get real.

474

- They could be in
 there all night.

484
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:03,453
Are we just gonna wait out here?

485
00:30:03,453 --> 00:30:05,325
- Not even.

486
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:06,805
- We're going back to the house?

487
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,502
- We're going inside.

488
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:10,852
I had the boys from
 Sig Ep rig the place.

489
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,811
- Sweetness!

490
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:16,510
- Come on.

00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:18,773
We need to be quiet.

493
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:29,088
- What are you, my chaperone?

494
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:30,393
- People call me Turkey.

495
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:31,394
- I'll bet they do.

496
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:36,269
- You need a brewski
 to wash that down?

497
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:37,226
- Brewski?

498
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:38,227
Are you serious?

499
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:46,583
- I think I'm in love.

Right on.

503
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,864
- Hey.

504
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,604
Wanna knock the
 dust off some balls?

505
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:08,823
- Excuse me?

506
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:11,957
[laughs nervously] I don't know.

507
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,437
I haven't done it
 since I was a kid.

508
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:15,743
- You can't be worse than me.

509
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:16,570
Come on.

510
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,312
Just take the ball
 lightly, but firm.

511
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:20,835
Here, take a few steps back.

512
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,272
- Like this?

513
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:24,404
- Just like that, good form.

514
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:26,232
- What's next?

515
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:28,364
- Then you walk real fast
 and funny to the line.

516
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:31,193
Throw that thing as far
 as you can, down the lane.

517
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:32,803
- Fast and funny, huh?

518
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,893
- Hey, it's a guaranteed
strike every time.

519
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:37,634
- Well then, here goes nothing.

520
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:48,645
Your instructions kind of suck.

521
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,778
- Well, you weren't
 fast or funny enough.

but uh, you've never really
 bowled before, have you?

524
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,275
- Negative, not once.

525
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,894

- Okay, bro, you're a hustler.

529

- Now let me show
 you how to do it.

530
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:43,570
- Stand up straight.

531
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,314
A little to the left,
 and hold it like this.

[soft music]

536
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:05,287

- Duh.

538
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,597
- Duh, what?

539
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:12,816
- Obviously, I'm
 still mad at you.

540
00:33:12,816 --> 00:33:14,688
- I said I was sorry.

541
00:33:14,688 --> 00:33:17,256
- Yeah, but what you guys
 said was really crummy,

542
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:19,823
and you're only sorry
 'cause it got busted.

543
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:21,912
- It was just a college prank.

544
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:26,178
- Well, it wasn't cool and
 I did not like it at all.

545
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,702
- Just tell me what I can
 do to make it up to you.

546
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:30,834
- Probably nothing.

547
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:35,187
- I know, they say the
way to a woman's heart,

548
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,625
is a brand new pair of shoes.

549
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:42,020
But wait, there's more.

I truly am sorry.

553
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:51,072
Apology accepted?

554
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:56,121
- None of these shoes
 are even my size.

555
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,384
- Oh, gimme a break.

556
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:00,125
I'm sorry,

557
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,735

- What a bunch of boring hoes.

561
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:14,530
- I don't know, I'm
 kind of liking it.

562
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,315
Then again-

563
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:17,359
- They haven't even
 looked for the trophy yet.

564
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,058
If this doesn't pick up,

565
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,711
we may have to
 goose them a little.

566
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,501
- All right, ladies.

567
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:35,856
Where are they?

00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,394

- Your mouth says no, but your
 body says all kinds of yes.

572
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:05,146
- Be careful, big boy.

573
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,756
My daddy's in the NRA.

574
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:08,236
- Oh, no need.

575
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:10,282
I'll be a gentleman and
be on the right side

00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:11,674
of your mixed signals.

577
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,549
So is that a yes, then?

578
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:17,637
- Not exactly.

579
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:24,078
I, I shouldn't.

580
00:35:24,078 --> 00:35:25,035
- Neither should I.

 with that, call your mommy?

You'll do.

588
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:03,552
- Are you really gonna
 do this for your sisters?

589
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:05,424
I didn't think that
 was your style.

590
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:07,165
- I only look out
 for a number one.

591
00:36:08,122 --> 00:36:09,123
- I don't get it.

592
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:10,080

00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:14,737
- If you hate Pi Epsilon Delta
 so much, why'd you even join?

I could score hench on.

That, and I'm
 clearly a masochist.

You think that thing
 is real silver?

 with all the dust.

- Heavy.

599
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,233

 price of silver is nowadays.

00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,556
I wanna shit ton of cash.

722
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:56,557
Yeah, that's it.

723
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:57,732
Cash out the ass.

724
00:41:57,732 --> 00:41:59,429
- You snooze, you lose, girl.

725
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:02,171
Sir, I like your style, granted!

726
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,571
- Bro, what is this?

727
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:11,790
I specifically said
 I wanted a shit ton.

728
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,443
This isn't a shit ton, bro.

729
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:16,490
- Come to me, Devin.

730
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,275
Come inside.

731
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:20,450
- Is that really you?

732
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:23,453
The man of my dreams?

733
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:24,542
- Come to me, Devin.

734
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:28,458
I waited all my life for you.

735
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,031
I'll never leave you.

[Devin sighs]

737
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:40,122

738
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:42,603
[sighs] Whoa.

739
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:46,738

745
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:14,826
I said I wanna be
 a famous rapper.

746
00:44:14,826 --> 00:44:15,696
Where's my mic?

747
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,655

748
00:44:20,092 --> 00:44:20,919

to be a famous wrapper.

Take that, KitKat.

757
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,732
All right, who's next?

758
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,647
- You mean next to die?

759
00:44:53,647 --> 00:44:55,214
You can all stay if you
 want, but I'm outta here.

760
00:44:55,214 --> 00:44:57,956
- Um, we need to get
 Devin first, though.

761
00:44:57,956 --> 00:45:00,306

you'll miss all the fun.

- Way enough.

781
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:50,748
- We should just run
 back to the house

782
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,575
and pretend that
 this never happened.

783
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:53,446
Solid?

[intense music]

788
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:08,113

What's happened to me?

 fine young ladies.

Two more wishes.

802
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,298
What are your heart's desires?

803
00:47:04,778 --> 00:47:06,345
- I wish you would
 leave me alone.

804
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:09,696

- I'm waiting.

810
00:47:25,407 --> 00:47:27,148
- I'm not playing your game.

811
00:47:27,148 --> 00:47:28,933
- Ah, but you must.

812
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:34,416
But word to the wise, choose
 your words wisely, ha!

813
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:36,462
- Gotcha.

814
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:38,986
All right, okay.

815
00:47:38,986 --> 00:47:42,860
If I wished, for
 example, and I'm not,

816
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:45,906
for you to open this door,

817
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:47,777
it would smash me
 to bits, right?

818
00:47:47,777 --> 00:47:48,953
- Possibly.

819
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,260
- Okay.

And again, if I
 wished, and I'm not,

821
00:47:56,308 --> 00:47:58,353
to be snuggled up
 safely in my bed,

822
00:47:58,353 --> 00:48:02,880
I would be, but it would be
 on Saturn or something, right?

823
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,579
- You're very quick
 and very imaginative.

824
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:08,407
- Cool beans.
 Okay, let me think.

825

- What have you always wanted?

826
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,020
- To live forever.

827
00:48:14,108 --> 00:48:16,458
- Thy will be done. [laughs]

828

 count, does it?

- It sure does.

 nasty little shit!

00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:38,567
- I dunno, she's like, I'm
really into that guy right now.

837
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:40,221
- We need to find a weapon.

838
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:42,049
- Do you think that'll
 do us any good?

839
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:43,572
- I don't wanna find
 out if we don't.

840
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:44,399
- Okay.

00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:55,149

[Bitzy exclaims]

846
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:07,379

be Pi Epsilon Deltas.

00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:09,337

Get away from me!

 blow up this thing.

- How are we gonna get out?

856
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,897
- We have to stop him.

857
00:49:47,897 --> 00:49:48,724
But how?

858
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:53,991
- I swear over my dead body

859
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:58,169
that I'm never pledging
another sorority again.

860
00:49:58,169 --> 00:50:03,174

- From my experience with women?

873
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:44,650
It'll be another hour, at least.

Don't make us go in there.

- I kinda wanna see it, though.

879
00:51:16,856 --> 00:51:18,901
Is it really as huge
 magical as they say?

880
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:20,903
- Be my guest.

881
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:31,131
- Not a magic place,
 not a magic place.

882
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,656
Ooh, check it out.

883
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,833

He's like so into me.

888

- Oh, that's positive.

892
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:28,623
I guess we could just sit here
 and wait for the inevitable.

897
00:52:39,895 --> 00:52:41,419
I really like you.

898
00:52:41,419 --> 00:52:43,812
- And you're compelled
 to tell me this now?

899
00:52:43,812 --> 00:52:46,163
- I just needed to say it.

900
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,077
I may never get another chance.

901
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:50,079
I like you, your style.

902
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,169
