This isn't really
the broodiest.

177
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:56,964
And then, these scary black
holes open up in the ground.

178
00:07:56,966 --> 00:08:02,503
They started to suck everybody I've
ever cared about out of my life!

179

And he shouted...</i>

No!

183
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:13,548
And you disappeared
into the void,

184
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,017
never to be seen again.

185
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,585
Not bad brooding!

186

187
00:08:18,954 --> 00:08:20,322
That was definitely

No, no, no.
This is my vision of the future.

197
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:45,514
Planty's room,
[whispers] kitty cat room...

198
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:47,148
Of course, the kitchen,

199
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,951
complete with breakfast nook,
lunchtime nook, and fireman pole.

200
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:52,721

204
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:03,063
So you can have toast
or waffles at any time!

205
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:04,466
[Wyldstyle] Oh!

206
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:06,467
And out back,
a double-decker porch swing,

207
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:09,069
so we can always
hang together!

208

What do you think?

209
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:13,074
Uh... Wow. Um...

210
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:14,241
It's sweet.

211
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:16,209
It is. It's just, uh...

212
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:19,880
It's going to attract aliens
and get destroyed.

213
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:21,515
But maybe it won't.

214
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:24,084
I just thought
we could rebuild the future.

215
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:26,355

216
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,588
[sighs] Emmet...

217
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,890
You gotta stop pretending
everything is awesome.

218
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:31,193
It isn't.

219
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,861
Every morning,
you walk through town,

220
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,763
singing that terrible,
annoying, manufactured pop song!

221
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:38,231
[chuckles] That song
really seems to upset you.

222
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,334
- No, it doesn't.
- Oh, my mistake.

223
00:09:40,336 --> 00:09:43,303
That song was fine
when we were younger,

224
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:46,908
but we also have to
grow up sometime.

225
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,344
Can you do that for me?

226
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:52,914
Well, yeah. I can try.

227
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:57,052
But it's easy for you.
You were always a dark, goth rebel.

228
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,385
[scoffs] Yes, of course I was.

229
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:00,020
- Let's change the subject.
- Okay.

230
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:03,257
We have to be hardened and battle-ready.
Both of us.

231
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:04,824
Yeah. No, I get it.

232
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:07,462
And that's why I've cultivated
a totally hard-edged side

233
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:09,563
that's super tough
and... Look, look!

234

Oh, no!

00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:16,470
What? Can't think of anything
to wish for?

237
00:10:16,472 --> 00:10:17,938

for more wishes,

have enough.

693
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,281
Hey, you broke my ship.

694
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:09,549
Listen, kid,
you can build anything,

695
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:11,517
but there ain't nothing
you can't break.

696
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,319
[both laughing]

697
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:14,487
I don't get it.

698
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:16,523
How about a tour?

699
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:19,458
Behold, the <i>Rexcelsior.</i>

700
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,861
[Emmet] Whoa-ho-ho!

701
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:23,563
Are those dinosaurs?

702
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:25,468
[raptors chittering,
screeching]

703
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,806
[laughs] Whoa!

704
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:35,941
[Rex] Tell me,
what's a scrapabout like you

705
00:32:35,943 --> 00:32:38,977
doing trying to
go through the Stairgate?

706
00:32:38,979 --> 00:32:41,681
Aliens from the Systar System
kidnapped my friends.

707
00:32:41,683 --> 00:32:43,483
I'm going to get them back.

708
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:47,420
You don't wanna go anywhere near
the Systar System, trust me.

709
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:51,224
It's ruled by an alien queen,
and she'll try to brainwash your friends,

710
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:55,394
so she can use 'em in a matrimonial
ceremony to bring forth...

711
00:32:55,396 --> 00:32:57,296
- Armamageddon?
- Bingo.

712
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:00,300
You've been to the Systar System?
You can help me.

713
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:02,136
Forget it, kid.

714
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:03,937
That place is too terrible.

715
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:07,640
But I don't like to talk about
my backstory, so don't even ask.

716
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:09,542
- Oh. Okay.
- There I was,

717
00:33:09,544 --> 00:33:11,544
<i>on a galactic mission.</i>

718
00:33:11,546 --> 00:33:14,480
<i>Ended up being
more than I'd bargained for.</i>

719
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:16,449
[screaming]

720
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:18,551
[clattering]

721
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:20,986
<i>I landed
in the desolate plains</i>

722
00:33:20,988 --> 00:33:24,724
<i>of the dust planet Undar
of the Dryar System.</i>

723
00:33:24,726 --> 00:33:27,894
- [machine rumbling]
- <i>The winds were ferocious.</i>

724
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:31,430
- [wind whistling]
- <i>The isolation, intense.</i>

725
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:32,666
[indistinct chatter]

726
00:33:32,668 --> 00:33:34,301
<i>I waited for my friends.</i>

727
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,905
[chatter continues]

728
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,041
<i>Seemed to last forever.</i>

729
00:33:46,282 --> 00:33:48,117
<i>That's when I learned...</i>

730
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:53,320
There was no one
I could trust but me.

731
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,488
I'm so sorry, Rex.

732
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:58,891
Don't be. My time alone
was an awakening.

733
00:33:58,893 --> 00:34:01,694
I learned how
the universe really works.

734
00:34:01,696 --> 00:34:03,496
Yeah, I know how you feel.

735
00:34:03,498 --> 00:34:06,365
Ha! You couldn't possibly
know how it feels.

736
00:34:06,367 --> 00:34:08,034
Yeah, I do.

737
00:34:08,036 --> 00:34:10,603
Like you can't ever go back
to the person you used to be.

738
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:12,170
Even though it was
so much simpler.

739
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:15,609
- You have to find your own way.
- [raptor chirps]

740
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:17,476
But you just don't know how.

741
00:34:17,478 --> 00:34:18,712
Hold up a second.

742
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:21,448
- You have been there.
- Yeah.

743
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,951
What's your last name, Emmet?

744
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:25,152
Brickowski.

745
00:34:25,154 --> 00:34:26,752
No way.

746
00:34:26,754 --> 00:34:29,154
The visionary
double-decker-couch-building hero

747
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:31,491
who took it to Lord Business
and had the guts

748
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:32,725
to face The Man Upstairs?

749
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:35,395
That Emmet Brickowski?

750
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:36,897
Yeah.

751
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:37,763
Dude! Big fan!

752
00:34:37,765 --> 00:34:39,833
Wait, you are a fan of me?

753
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:42,502
Heck yeah. You're the reason
I started wearing vests.

754
00:34:42,504 --> 00:34:44,937
- Do you like mine?
- Yes, I do!

755
00:34:44,939 --> 00:34:47,241
- [laughing]
- [raptor roars]

756
00:34:47,243 --> 00:34:51,009
Also started wearing chaps,
which are essentially leg-vests.

757
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:54,647
Wow. You're so much more cool
and grown-up than me.

758
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:56,750
[gasps] You could teach me!

759
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:59,786
Rex, help me rescue my
friends, stop Armamageddon,

760
00:34:59,788 --> 00:35:02,288
and teach me to be like you.

761
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,924
Someone Lucy will be proud of.

762
00:35:03,926 --> 00:35:08,527
And I'll be the brother
you never had.

763
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:11,499
Unless you do have a brother.
I don't really know you that well.

764
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:16,803
All right, kid, you listen.

765
00:35:16,805 --> 00:35:18,906
You go soft,
you're playing their game.

766
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,641
You're gonna have to grow up
and grow up fast.

767
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:24,277
Are you ready to do that?

768
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:26,279
Yes, I am.

769
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:28,015
I can't hear you.

770
00:35:28,017 --> 00:35:30,049
Really? I was speaking
at normal volume.

771
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:31,851
Sorry, man. I'm just
a little hard of hearing

772
00:35:31,853 --> 00:35:33,719
from listening to
my mixtapes super loud

773
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:35,420
with no regard
for my future hearing,

774
00:35:35,422 --> 00:35:36,790
because I live in the now.

775
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:39,792
Raptors, re-coordinate.

776
00:35:39,794 --> 00:35:43,596
- Really?
- Set a course for the Systar System.

777
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:46,232
Rex, I promise
you won't regret it.

778
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:49,969
Kid, I invented the phrase
"no regrets."

779
00:35:49,971 --> 00:35:53,038
I do have one regret
of not trademarking it.

780
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,042
Space cannons.

781
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:56,743
Hyper-light-speed combustor.

782
00:35:56,745 --> 00:35:58,145
[powering up]

783
00:35:58,147 --> 00:35:59,846
[on speakers]
Super-rad ejector button.

784
00:35:59,848 --> 00:36:01,415
Whoa. Isn't there
a better place to put that?

785
00:36:01,417 --> 00:36:02,616
Raptors, power up.

786
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:03,716
Crank the warp drive up to 11.

787
00:36:03,718 --> 00:36:06,087
- Times two.
- [raptor chirps]

788
00:36:08,357 --> 00:36:10,226
Yeah!

789
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:17,065
To the Systar System.

790
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,067
[engine revving]

791
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:22,537
[Finn imitates engine revving]

792
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:25,705
[Wyldstyle] That queen
is never gonna break us.

793
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:27,774
She just wants
to throw a party.

794
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,611
It's clearly a cover
for some catastrophic event.

795
00:36:30,613 --> 00:36:31,978
Yeah. Marriage, am I right?

796
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,112
No one's tying down
this Batman forever.

797
00:36:34,114 --> 00:36:35,748
Ooh, reference!

798
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:39,252
[scoffs] No. The moment you say,
"I do," it'll unlock some...

799
00:36:39,254 --> 00:36:42,254
- What are you looking at?
- What are you hiding?

800
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:43,489
What are you hiding?

801
00:36:43,491 --> 00:36:44,623
You're the one with

802
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:45,757
the reflective mask.

803
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:46,859
Well, I asked you first.

804
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:48,261
Well, I asked you second.

805
00:36:48,263 --> 00:36:50,362
- [General Mayhem] Real mature.
- [gasps]

806
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:51,596
So, where are we going?

807
00:36:51,598 --> 00:36:53,634
[General Mayhem]
Planet Sparkles.

808
00:36:53,636 --> 00:36:55,935
Sparkles.

809
00:36:55,937 --> 00:37:00,040
There, you will get changed
in more ways than one.

810
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:01,507
Hello!

811
00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:03,009
What was that?

812
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:05,846
I said,
[in high-pitched voice] "Hello!"

813
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,781
Well, we've been talking
for a while.

814
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:09,583
I'm not sure
why you're saying hello now...

815
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:11,787
But fine. Hello to you.

816
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:24,429
Stick together.
I've got a plan.

817
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:26,366
Greetings, Bricksburgians.

818
00:37:26,368 --> 00:37:29,101
Welcome to the
Palace of Infinite Reflection.

819
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:32,371
A self-reeducation
celebrity center.

820
00:37:32,373 --> 00:37:33,906
Namaste.

821
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:36,408
Ooh! Sounds spiritual.

822
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,810
It is so spiritual.

823
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:39,812
Sounds like a trap.
This guy's a vampire.

824
00:37:39,814 --> 00:37:42,515
Attractive non-threatening
teen vampire.

825
00:37:42,517 --> 00:37:44,116
I like to talk about feelings,

826
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:46,953
and how we're in love,
but can't be together.

827
00:37:46,955 --> 00:37:48,221
Isn't that beautiful?

828
00:37:48,223 --> 00:37:50,623
I'll answer that.
It's very beautiful.

829
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:52,891
The heart wants what it wants.

830
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:57,062
I also DJ on the side
and wear women's jeans.

831
00:37:57,064 --> 00:37:58,263
Wow!

832
00:37:58,265 --> 00:38:00,799
Guys, we have to stay tough
and gritty.

833
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:02,636
Do not let them
soften you up...

834
00:38:02,638 --> 00:38:06,938
Oh, yeah. I love getting barnacles
scrubbed off me bilge pump.

835
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,507
Really? Right into it.

836
00:38:08,509 --> 00:38:09,676
[laughing] Oh, oh! It tickles.

837
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:11,511
- [whirring]
- Whee!

838
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:15,781
Oh, yeah, I carry my tortured
past in my chiseled glutes.

839
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:17,516
[scoffs] Even you?

840
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:19,685
What? I mean,
I'm not gonna turn down a free massage.

841
00:38:19,687 --> 00:38:21,788
She needs extra treatment.

842
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,489
- No!
- Yes.

843
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:24,991
- First, you'll get a hot gem massage.
- [Wyldstyle exclaiming]

844
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:27,326
Then an exfoliating
flower beatdown.

845
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,395
- Popsicle face mask and peel.
- [grunting]

846
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:31,998
- Room-temperature stone contusion.
- [muffled] Hey!

847
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,667
Vegetable observation...

848
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:35,067
And be cleansed
with a glitter scrub

849
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:36,768
- and sparkle rinse.
- Ah!

850
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,138
- Next...
- [screams]

851
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,642
- Your hair!
- It's...

852
00:38:41,142 --> 00:38:43,009
- It's beautiful.
- Wait, what?

853
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:44,710
- [all gasp]
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

854
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:46,212
- [Unikitty] What? Wow!
- [Wyldstyle chuckles nervously]

855
00:38:46,214 --> 00:38:48,114
Guys, this is not
what you think.

856
00:38:48,116 --> 00:38:50,817
It's so adorable and cute!

857
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:53,386
Are you covering up
some un-dark past?

858
00:38:53,388 --> 00:38:56,455
No. It's not who I am.
It's just hair.

859
00:38:56,457 --> 00:38:59,093
Look, if I pop it off,
am I Bruce Willis now?

860
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:00,993
I don't think so.

861
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:03,996
Well, well, well.
I thought ye were tough.

862
00:39:03,998 --> 00:39:06,031
Looks like the peg's
on the other leg.

863
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:07,799
- I didn't...
- Is she secretly cutesy?

864
00:39:07,801 --> 00:39:09,636

[General Mayhem] I've detected
a deep emptiness in him.

1206
00:53:13,714 --> 00:53:17,584
According to my calculations,
he's lonely.

1207
00:53:18,618 --> 00:53:21,122
- Among other things.
- [munching]

1208
00:53:22,656 --> 00:53:24,957
I know how he feels.

1209
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:26,792
I mean,
what a weirdo. [scoffs]

1210
00:53:26,794 --> 00:53:28,661
I totally
don't relate to that.

1211
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,429
The time
for Armamageddon nears.

1212
00:53:31,431 --> 00:53:32,998
We must find a weakness.

1213
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,368
- If he doesn't say "I do," we...
- Relax, girl.

1214
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:37,268
I got this.

1215
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:39,304

I'll just leave you two alone.

Listen, lady, don't try
any mind games.

1219
00:53:47,214 --> 00:53:52,283
Batman is a permanent
Bat-chelor.

1220
00:53:52,285 --> 00:53:55,855
Can you imagine if having a
family with someone I loved

1221
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:59,025
healed some of
my darkest trauma?

1222
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,025
Barf.

1223
00:54:00,027 --> 00:54:02,361
There is no way
I'm marrying you.

1224
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:03,728
Well, of course not.

1225
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:05,629
Oh. Uh...
Yeah, but you said that...

1226
00:54:05,631 --> 00:54:07,199
I wanted to marry you?

1227
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:08,833
No, no, no, honey.

1228
00:54:08,835 --> 00:54:10,734

1229
00:54:10,736 --> 00:54:13,339
I actually

1230
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:15,940
Good. So, I guess
we're done here or...

[chuckles] Yeah. And, um...

1234
00:54:22,015 --> 00:54:25,784
Out of curiosity, why wouldn't
you wanna marry me?

1235
00:54:25,786 --> 00:54:29,187
Just, you know, again,
purely for curiosity sake.

1236

00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:55,013
[Batman] "The union
of Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi

1373
00:59:55,015 --> 00:59:56,948
and Bruce Margolis Batman."

1374
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:59,250
I will say it is nice
that you have a vegan option,

1375
00:59:59,252 --> 01:00:02,053
but we're gonna have to
reprint these all in black.

1376
01:00:02,055 --> 01:00:04,255
- Bam!
- I like it.

1377
01:00:04,257 --> 01:00:07,826
And instead of releasing
doves, how about bats?

1378
01:00:07,828 --> 01:00:09,326
- [bats screeching]
- Ta-da!

1379
01:00:09,328 --> 01:00:11,161
Sweet! I got an idea.

1380
01:00:11,163 --> 01:00:13,931
What if, instead of throwing a
bouquet, if I throw a batarang,

1381
01:00:13,933 --> 01:00:15,433
and whoever's chest
it lodges in

1382
01:00:15,435 --> 01:00:18,069
is the next to get married?

1383
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:19,370
[chuckles] Love it, babe.

1384
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:21,906
I did not expect this
to be so much fun.

1385
01:00:21,908 --> 01:00:24,775
Who would've thought that
this incorrigible gadabout

1386
01:00:24,777 --> 01:00:26,243
would ever tie the knot?

1387
01:00:26,245 --> 01:00:29,480
People change. I change,
like, every five seconds.

1388
01:00:29,482 --> 01:00:30,582
Like this, boom.

1389
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:31,884
Oh. Uh-huh. [chuckles]

1390
01:00:31,886 --> 01:00:33,819
I mean, this morning
I was all alone.

1391
01:00:33,821 --> 01:00:37,254
Living in a giant palace with
only a fussy British servant,

1392
01:00:37,256 --> 01:00:39,290
and no one
who could really relate to me.

1393
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:41,192
I can really relate to that.

1394
01:00:41,194 --> 01:00:43,694
But along the way,
it got real.

1395
01:00:43,696 --> 01:00:45,230
So, so real.

1396
01:00:45,232 --> 01:00:47,165
Look at us,
two different worlds.

1397
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:48,866
Two people
who just need someone

1398
01:00:48,868 --> 01:00:50,134
who understands us...

1399
01:00:50,136 --> 01:00:52,036
[both] To find real happiness.

1400
01:00:52,038 --> 01:00:53,638
- Whoa! Jinx.
- Jinx!

1401
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,772
[both] Jinx.

1402
01:00:54,774 --> 01:00:56,174
And final jinx.

1403
01:00:56,176 --> 01:00:57,710
Oh, you're so jinxed,
both of you, aren't you?

1404
01:00:57,712 --> 01:01:00,045
So, let's stop this forever.

1405
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:01,779
Have you been here
the whole time?

1406
01:01:01,781 --> 01:01:04,484
Yeah. And I'm sad about it.

1407
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:09,487
[General Mayhem]
So, then the centaur says,

1408
01:01:09,489 --> 01:01:11,255
"That's not the half
I'm talking about."

1409
01:01:11,257 --> 01:01:12,591
[all laughing]

1410
01:01:12,593 --> 01:01:15,060
Okay, target detected.
I'm closing in.

1411
01:01:15,062 --> 01:01:17,062
- [Rex] <i>10-4, good buddy.</i>
- [Emmet] <i>10-4 you, good buddy.</i>

1412
01:01:17,064 --> 01:01:18,830
[Rex] <i>You're the good buddy,
buddy.</i>

1413
01:01:18,832 --> 01:01:20,364
- [Emmet] <i>Is that Bruce Willis?</i>
- [Bruce Willis] <i>Hey, guys.</i>

1414
01:01:20,366 --> 01:01:22,435
[Rex laughing]
<i>Good one, Bruce Willis!</i>

1415
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:25,837
Get to the bridal suite
without getting brainwashed.

1416
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,371
Think hard thoughts.

1417
01:01:27,373 --> 01:01:29,107
Brood. Brood. Brood!

1418
01:01:29,109 --> 01:01:30,408
Brood!

1419
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:31,643
Did you just say "brood"?

1420
01:01:31,645 --> 01:01:34,245
No, "bride"!
I need to see the bride.

1421
01:01:34,247 --> 01:01:37,181
I'm sorry, no entry allowed.
Who are you?

1422
01:01:37,183 --> 01:01:39,984
Who, me? [laughing]

1423
01:01:39,986 --> 01:01:41,386
I'm your worst nightmare.

1424
01:01:41,388 --> 01:01:43,788
You're me when I'm late
to school,

1425
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:46,792
and I forgot my homework and
my pants are made of pudding?

1426
01:01:46,794 --> 01:01:49,226
No, I don't... [grunts]

1427
01:01:49,228 --> 01:01:51,098
- [punches landing]
- [grunting]

1428
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,101
[Queen Watevra] Mayhem!
Is everything in order for the ceremony?

1429
01:01:57,103 --> 01:01:59,471
Yes, I will operate
everything here

1430
01:01:59,473 --> 01:02:02,207
from this
home entertainment center.

1431
01:02:02,209 --> 01:02:03,808
There it is.

1432
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:04,909
[Batman] You so get me.

1433
01:02:04,911 --> 01:02:06,478
No. You so get me.

1434
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,279
No, no, no. You so get me.

1435
01:02:08,281 --> 01:02:09,614
They brainwashed Batman.

1436
01:02:09,616 --> 01:02:11,382
Wow, they're good,
because he is dense.

1437
01:02:11,384 --> 01:02:13,317
Let's both say the first word
that pops in our heads

1438
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:14,486
and see if it's the same.

1439
01:02:14,488 --> 01:02:16,286
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

1440
01:02:16,288 --> 01:02:17,922
- Party!
- Batman!

1441
01:02:17,924 --> 01:02:19,658
Oh, that's crazy,
'cause Batman is all for partying.

1442
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,625
- So, that's basically the same word.
- Totally.

1443
01:02:21,627 --> 01:02:22,726
Totally.

1444
01:02:22,728 --> 01:02:23,795
- Totally.
- Totally.

1445
01:02:23,797 --> 01:02:25,596
Final totally. And end it.

1446
01:02:25,598 --> 01:02:27,199
We've gotta get upstairs.
The show's starting.

1447
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,199
Mayhem,
do the boopity-bop-bop.

1448
01:02:29,201 --> 01:02:30,603
[automated voice]
Boopity-bop-bop.

1449
01:02:34,507 --> 01:02:36,540
Bring down the house,
my queen.

1450
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:38,678
This house is about to
get tore up.

1451
01:02:49,723 --> 01:02:51,123
We've been expecting you.

1452
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:55,027
Then expect the unexpected!

1453
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:56,562
[General Mayhem]
Did you expect this?

1454
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,362
- [grunts] Yes.
- [groans]

1455
01:02:58,364 --> 01:03:01,966
[General Mayhem] Well,
I expected your expecting our expecting.

1456
01:03:01,968 --> 01:03:05,870
And I expected your expecting
of my expecting your...

1457
01:03:05,872 --> 01:03:07,408
Wait, now I'm lost.

1458
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,410
[Star Duplos] Yay! Whee!

1459
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:13,147
[both yelling]

1460
01:03:14,714 --> 01:03:16,114
[grunts]

1461
01:03:16,116 --> 01:03:18,082
[groans] I feel dizzy.

1462
01:03:18,084 --> 01:03:19,486
[retching]

1463
01:03:20,788 --> 01:03:22,790
[crowd cheering]

1464
01:03:27,995 --> 01:03:32,330
Citizens of the 11 planets
of the Systar System!

1465
01:03:32,332 --> 01:03:34,933
I ask you
to put your hands together

1466
01:03:34,935 --> 01:03:36,933
and apart, and together again

1467
01:03:36,935 --> 01:03:39,270
in a repeated fashion.

1468
01:03:39,272 --> 01:03:40,708
[rhythmic clapping]

1469
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:48,011
[Emmet] Broody Judy,
this is Stubble Trouble.

1470
01:03:48,013 --> 01:03:49,614
What's your status?

1471
01:03:49,616 --> 01:03:51,915
- Hello? Lucy?
- [static on radio]

1472
01:03:51,917 --> 01:03:53,317
She's not answering.

1473
01:03:53,319 --> 01:03:54,953
- Uh-oh.
- Is that bad?

1474
01:03:54,955 --> 01:03:56,587
An "uh-oh"? Never good.

1475
01:03:56,589 --> 01:03:58,156
I thought she might've been

1476
01:03:58,158 --> 01:04:00,025
more brainwashed
than she was letting on.

1477
01:04:00,027 --> 01:04:03,929
No. No, not Lucy.
She is the toughest there is.

1478
01:04:03,931 --> 01:04:06,300
Unless that song got stuck
in her head.

1479
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:08,833
Lucy. Lucy?

1480
01:04:08,835 --> 01:04:10,938
- <i>Come on, Lucy, where are you?</i>
- [grunting]

1481
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:14,505
Allow me to introduce...

1482
01:04:14,507 --> 01:04:15,839
The wedding party.

1483
01:04:15,841 --> 01:04:18,342
Supporting the bride
are Marie Curie...

1484
01:04:18,344 --> 01:04:20,145
Chocolate Bar...

1485
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,446
The Tin Man...

1486
01:04:21,448 --> 01:04:23,580
And Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

1487
01:04:23,582 --> 01:04:26,150
Bearing the rings, Banana.

1488
01:04:26,152 --> 01:04:28,319
Okay, okay. You can do this.

1489
01:04:28,321 --> 01:04:29,886
Don't mess this... [yelps]

1490
01:04:29,888 --> 01:04:32,257
- [crowd groans]
- I messed it up! I messed it up!

1491
01:04:32,259 --> 01:04:33,792
[grunting] No!

1492
01:04:33,794 --> 01:04:35,359
- [crowd gasps]
- I'm slipping! Don't look at me!

1493
01:04:35,361 --> 01:04:37,596
No! [groans]

1494
01:04:37,598 --> 01:04:39,964
- [crowd gasps]
- This is my nightmare!

1495
01:04:39,966 --> 01:04:42,268
I had a dream about this!
Don't look at me!

1496
01:04:43,837 --> 01:04:47,272
[Ice Cream Cone] And on the groom's
side, MetalBeard...

1497
01:04:47,274 --> 01:04:48,940
[plays trumpet] Arr!

1498
01:04:48,942 --> 01:04:50,641
- [Ice Cream Cone] Unikitty...
- Hi!

1499
01:04:50,643 --> 01:04:52,377
[Ice Cream Cone]
And that spaceman, Benny.

1500
01:04:52,379 --> 01:04:53,844
Spaceship!

1501
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:55,279
Oh, no, my friends.

1502
01:04:55,281 --> 01:04:56,681
I barely recognize them.

1503
01:04:56,683 --> 01:04:58,415
Don't worry
about your friends.

1504
01:04:58,417 --> 01:04:59,717
Don't worry about Lucy.

1505
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:02,453
Focus on what you need to do.

1506
01:05:02,455 --> 01:05:05,459
Visualize your success.
[echoing]

1507
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:09,529
[grunts]

1508
01:05:11,397 --> 01:05:13,931
- [rumbling]
- He did it!

1509
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:15,500
He's so tough!

1510
01:05:15,502 --> 01:05:17,902
We were so wrong about him.

1511
01:05:17,904 --> 01:05:19,540
Way to go, Emmet.

1512
01:05:20,372 --> 01:05:22,775
You've changed, perfectly.

1513
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:25,842
Your future is bright.

1514
01:05:25,844 --> 01:05:29,746
Right now, we gotta deal
with the present.

1515
01:05:29,748 --> 01:05:34,319
Wow! My own Rex Vest?
[laughs]

1516
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:36,788
Thanks for helping me change
for the tougher.

1517
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:38,792
Don't thank me,
thank yourself.

1518
01:05:39,759 --> 01:05:42,263
Catch you on the flip. Hey-yo!

1519
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:46,498
[Wonder Woman] Uh-oh.

1520
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,766
Ugh! I left my lasso in there!

1521
01:05:48,768 --> 01:05:52,906
And now presenting
Queen Watevra Wa'Nabi...

1522
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,373
Hey!

1523
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:56,774
[Ice Cream Cone]
And also Batman.

1524
01:05:56,776 --> 01:05:59,346
- [rock music playing]
- Commitment!

1525
01:06:00,346 --> 01:06:01,649
[powering up]

1526
01:06:06,152 --> 01:06:08,319
You look beautiful.

1527
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:09,920
You look stunning.

1528
01:06:09,922 --> 01:06:11,455
You are so right.

1529
01:06:11,457 --> 01:06:13,024
I know this is
a strange thing to say

1530
01:06:13,026 --> 01:06:14,591
to the person
I'm about to marry,

1531
01:06:14,593 --> 01:06:18,163
but I actually think
I really like you.

1532
01:06:18,165 --> 01:06:19,263
Samesies.

1533
01:06:19,265 --> 01:06:20,830
- Totally. Totally.
- Totally.

1534
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:24,134
And bring it to a merciful end.
Can we start now?

1535
01:06:24,136 --> 01:06:25,402
- Supes!
- [sighs]

1536
01:06:25,404 --> 01:06:27,471
I'm getting hitched.
Feeling jelly?

1537
01:06:27,473 --> 01:06:28,873
Not at all!

1538
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:31,576
Oh, it's burning
you up inside.

1539
01:06:31,578 --> 01:06:34,078
[General Mayhem] You don't
understand who the queen is

1540
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,547
and what we're trying to do.

1541
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:38,584
She's trying to
attack us, obviously.

1542
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:41,088
You attacked us!

1543
01:06:42,022 --> 01:06:44,022
No, you started it.

1544
01:06:44,024 --> 01:06:45,957
No, you started it.

1545
01:06:45,959 --> 01:06:46,993
[both grunting]

1546
01:06:50,196 --> 01:06:51,696
Well, now I'm gonna end it.

1547
01:06:51,698 --> 01:06:53,500
- [Heart Bomb Duplo] Hello!
- [General Mayhem] No!

1548
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:55,602
[General Mayhem screams]

1549
01:07:02,075 --> 01:07:03,544
[General Mayhem groaning]

1550
01:07:05,946 --> 01:07:07,047
[gasps]

1551
01:07:08,348 --> 01:07:10,784
Help me. Please.

1552
01:07:12,819 --> 01:07:14,786
Okay, I'm not falling for it.
No. Uh-uh.

1553
01:07:14,788 --> 01:07:15,823
No way.

1554
01:07:17,223 --> 01:07:18,792
[whimpers]

1555
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:23,995
Nope. Mmm-mmm.
Nope. Stop.

1556
01:07:23,997 --> 01:07:26,163
Uh-uh. No. Ugh!

1557
01:07:26,165 --> 01:07:28,535
No, I will not care about...

1558
01:07:34,373 --> 01:07:36,642
[gasps, screaming]

1559
01:07:38,444 --> 01:07:39,812
[panting]

1560
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:45,516
[both grunt]

1561
01:07:45,518 --> 01:07:47,054
[both panting]

1562
01:07:49,056 --> 01:07:50,455
You do care.

1563
01:07:50,457 --> 01:07:52,857
I knew there was some
sweetness under that darkness.

1564
01:07:52,859 --> 01:07:55,125
What are you talking about?
You're the bad guys, okay?

1565
01:07:55,127 --> 01:07:58,062
Maybe in your world.
But here, we don't see it that way.

1566
01:07:58,064 --> 01:07:59,598
Okay, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

1567
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,498
Your whole costume and mask

1568
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:04,703
and all the stomping around acting
like you're the boss of us...

1569
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,937
Because it's the only way
you'll listen!

1570
01:08:06,939 --> 01:08:09,073
I tried to wear a mask
and talk tough,

1571
01:08:09,075 --> 01:08:12,544
a language I thought you'd understand,
and it totally did not work.

1572
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,879
All we wanna do is
unite our worlds in peace.

1573
01:08:14,881 --> 01:08:16,380
Why didn't you guys
just tell us that?

1574
01:08:16,382 --> 01:08:18,015
We tried.

1575
01:08:18,017 --> 01:08:20,250
The queen sang a whole song
about how not evil she was.

1576
01:08:20,252 --> 01:08:21,786
That was the truth?

1577
01:08:21,788 --> 01:08:23,954
You guys
are terrible communicators.

1578
01:08:23,956 --> 01:08:25,589
[sighs] I know.

1579
01:08:25,591 --> 01:08:27,158
Come with me.

1580
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:29,526
For years, we've tried to join
you, to play with you.

1581
01:08:29,528 --> 01:08:32,563
<i>But you've always
pushed us away.</i>

1582
01:08:32,565 --> 01:08:37,134
<i>Now all of our fighting has brought
us to the brink of Armamageddon.</i>

1583
01:08:37,136 --> 01:08:39,070
But this wedding
can change all that.

1584
01:08:39,072 --> 01:08:42,440
Bring us together
and stop Armamageddon.

1585
01:08:42,442 --> 01:08:44,308
It'll make
everything awesome again.

1586
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:48,312
But everything isn't awesome,
it's, it's, uh...

1587
01:08:48,314 --> 01:08:49,512
- [gasps]
- [crowd cheering]

1588
01:08:49,514 --> 01:08:51,281
[Ice Cream Cone] And now,

1589
01:08:51,283 --> 01:08:54,587
the queen will change
into her original form.

1590
01:09:01,894 --> 01:09:03,796
- [crowd cheering]
- [gasps]

1591
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:08,499
See? Friends.

1592
01:09:08,501 --> 01:09:09,870
[Duplos] Ooh!

1593
01:09:13,139 --> 01:09:15,106
The queen was from Emmet.

1594
01:09:15,108 --> 01:09:18,075
Those bricks
inspired our world.

1595
01:09:18,077 --> 01:09:20,276
We exist because of you.

1596
01:09:20,278 --> 01:09:22,012
You started it.

1597
01:09:22,014 --> 01:09:23,647
We started it?

1598
01:09:23,649 --> 01:09:25,516
You started everything.

1599
01:09:25,518 --> 01:09:28,221
We look up to you.
Always have.

1600
01:09:29,622 --> 01:09:30,754
[MetalBeard] Wyldstyle!

1601
01:09:30,756 --> 01:09:32,557
[Benny] Where have you been?

1602
01:09:32,559 --> 01:09:34,226
- Oh, you guys aren't brainwashed?
- [upbeat music playing]

1603
01:09:34,228 --> 01:09:35,893
[laughing] Brainwashed? No!

1604
01:09:35,895 --> 01:09:38,329
We're just happy.
It's so much more fun here.

1605
01:09:38,331 --> 01:09:41,199
There are so many more
spaceships on this adventure!

1606
01:09:41,201 --> 01:09:43,033
And yet not nearly enough.

1607
01:09:43,035 --> 01:09:46,572
Wait, if you guys are good,
then who's the bad guy?

1608
01:09:48,707 --> 01:09:51,575
Stubble Trouble,
this is Alpha Wolf-Bro Dog.

1609
01:09:51,577 --> 01:09:53,777
I'm almost
in Rextraction position.

1610
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:55,311
<i>What's the color
on the ground?</i>

1611
01:09:55,313 --> 01:09:56,681
[Emmet whispers] Fuchsia.

1612
01:09:56,683 --> 01:09:57,949
Rex, I see Lucy.

1613
01:09:57,951 --> 01:09:59,984
But she isn't taking down
the shields.

1614
01:09:59,986 --> 01:10:02,286
[Rex] <i>You don't need Lucy.
You don't need anyone.</i>

1615
01:10:02,288 --> 01:10:05,557
If you focus,
you can make a punch so powerful,

1616
01:10:05,559 --> 01:10:07,924
you'll take it down,
shields and all.

1617
01:10:07,926 --> 01:10:10,427
<i>You've got the power
inside you.</i>

1618
01:10:10,429 --> 01:10:12,829
I can do this. I can do this.

1619
01:10:12,831 --> 01:10:16,034
I can't not do this.

1620
01:10:16,036 --> 01:10:18,235
So glad you aren't gonna
destroy this ceremony.

1621
01:10:18,237 --> 01:10:20,871
If anything bad were to
happen, we'd all be doomed.

1622
01:10:20,873 --> 01:10:23,309
But luckily, there's nothing
to worry about now.

1623
01:10:24,277 --> 01:10:25,677
Oh, no.

1624
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:26,880
Emmet.

1625
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,382
[gasps]

1626
01:10:31,384 --> 01:10:33,220
[grunting]

1627
01:10:35,587 --> 01:10:37,254
- Emmet!
- Lucy, what are you doing?

1628
01:10:37,256 --> 01:10:39,390
Did you draw stubble dots
on your face?

1629
01:10:39,392 --> 01:10:40,991
What? No. [chuckles]

1630
01:10:40,993 --> 01:10:43,393
Listen to me.
I was wrong about the queen.

1631
01:10:43,395 --> 01:10:44,861
No. No, no, no.

1632
01:10:44,863 --> 01:10:47,030
- Rex was right about you.
- No, you can't do this.

1633
01:10:47,032 --> 01:10:48,833
You're just stopping me
because you're brainwashed.

1634
01:10:48,835 --> 01:10:50,368
I'm not brainwashed!

1635
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:51,834
That's exactly what a
brainwashed person would say.

1636
01:10:51,836 --> 01:10:53,469
[MetalBeard] Ahoy, Emmet.

1637
01:10:53,471 --> 01:10:54,672
What happened to you?

1638
01:10:54,674 --> 01:10:57,107
A betoughening, it seems.

1639
01:10:57,109 --> 01:10:59,110
[Ice Cream Cone]
Do you, Queen Watevra,

1640
01:10:59,112 --> 01:11:02,112
take Batman to be your
special best partner?

1641
01:11:02,114 --> 01:11:03,213
I do.

1642
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:05,783
Hurry up, kid,
we're running outta time.

1643
01:11:05,785 --> 01:11:07,317
Guys, get out of my way.

1644
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:09,853
If you want to do harm
to yon wedding,

1645
01:11:09,855 --> 01:11:12,856
you will have to
get by we first.

1646
01:11:12,858 --> 01:11:15,325
I'm sorry,
but this is for your own good.

1647
01:11:15,327 --> 01:11:16,727
[yells]

1648
01:11:16,729 --> 01:11:18,699
[all screaming]

1649
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,466
Emmet! Come back!

1650
01:11:22,468 --> 01:11:23,870
[grunting]

1651
01:11:25,138 --> 01:11:26,103
Don't do this.

1652
01:11:26,105 --> 01:11:28,204
[Rex] <i>Don't listen to her!</i>

1653
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:29,339
Almost there...

1654
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:31,612
Oh, come on! No!
Not all the way down!

1655
01:11:32,711 --> 01:11:33,945
[Wyldstyle] Stop, Ems.

1656
01:11:33,947 --> 01:11:36,547
You don't know
what you're doing!

1657
01:11:36,549 --> 01:11:37,847
This isn't the real you.

1658
01:11:37,849 --> 01:11:40,484
This is the real me.

1659
01:11:40,486 --> 01:11:43,987
- The truth is, this is my real hair.
- [gasps]

1660
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:46,824
I used to sing and dance
and have colorful hair.

1661
01:11:46,826 --> 01:11:49,694
And I even loved
"Everything Is Awesome."

1662
01:11:49,696 --> 01:11:51,161
No, no. You would've told me.

1663
01:11:51,163 --> 01:11:53,298
You hate that music.
It isn't you.

1664
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:55,566
Yes, I darkened my hair
with marker,

1665
01:11:55,568 --> 01:11:58,369
'cause I wanted people to
think I was cool and grown up.

1666
01:11:58,371 --> 01:12:00,838
And then I tried to change you
into someone tough, too.

1667
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,874
And I was wrong.
I like you the way you were.

1668
01:12:04,876 --> 01:12:07,913
Sweet, innocent, kind.

1669
01:12:09,315 --> 01:12:12,184
The real Lucy
would never say that.

1670
01:12:14,754 --> 01:12:16,420
[Ice Cream Cone]
Do you, Batman,

1671
01:12:16,422 --> 01:12:18,088
take Queen Watevra

1672
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:19,990
- to be your special best partner?
- [Emmet yelling]

1673
01:12:19,992 --> 01:12:21,959
[Batman] I do, uh...

1674
01:12:21,961 --> 01:12:24,164
- Emmet!

01:12:44,783 --> 01:12:47,518
What's happening?
What did I just do?

- [rumbling]
- [gasps]

1680
01:12:49,322 --> 01:12:50,357
Lucy!

1681
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:54,024
- Come with me.
- I got you, brother.

1682
01:12:54,026 --> 01:12:56,460
- [Wyldstyle] Wait!
- [chirps]

1683

[Wyldstyle] <i>What's happening?</i>

<i>Where am I? What...</i>

1689
01:13:22,154 --> 01:13:24,489
You shouldn't take my stuff!

1690
01:13:24,491 --> 01:13:28,392
[Bianca] You crushed
my space laser cake thingy!

[Wyldstyle] <i>Emmet?</i>

1692
01:13:33,032 --> 01:13:34,731
Rex, why are we leaving?

1693
01:13:34,733 --> 01:13:36,467
We gotta save my friends.

1694
01:13:36,469 --> 01:13:39,203
Do we? They didn't come to
save us when we were all alone.

1695
01:13:39,205 --> 01:13:42,138
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

1696
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:44,275
Look a little closer.
We're not so different.

1697
01:13:44,277 --> 01:13:45,209
What, you and I?

1698
01:13:45,211 --> 01:13:46,944
- We and us.
- Huh?

1699
01:13:46,946 --> 01:13:49,379
Emmet, I'm you.

1700
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:50,914
But I'm me.

1701
01:13:50,916 --> 01:13:54,418
I'm you from the future,
all grown up.

1702
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:58,388
Wait, if you're me,
why do we sound so different?

1703
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:00,191
[in Emmet's voice]
Why do we sound so different?

1704

[gasps]

1705
01:14:01,661 --> 01:14:03,194
It's a mind-blower, I know.

1706
01:14:03,196 --> 01:14:05,896
That's why I was so cagey
in telling you my backstory.

1707
01:14:05,898 --> 01:14:07,365
Actually, you kept
bringing it up.

1708
01:14:07,367 --> 01:14:09,600
There I was, you.

1709
01:14:09,602 --> 01:14:12,669

1713
01:14:18,111 --> 01:14:21,712
[Rex] <i>There was no handsome,
older version of myself to save me.</i>

1714
01:14:21,714 --> 01:14:23,246
[Finn] Where's Emmet?

1715
01:14:23,248 --> 01:14:24,448
[The Man Upstairs] Honey,
I'm on my way out the door,

1716
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:26,150
but the kids are fighting.
Bye!

1717
01:14:26,152 --> 01:14:28,686
[Mom] Guys! Please,
find a way to play together,

1718
01:14:28,688 --> 01:14:31,054
or I'm gonna have to ask you
to put it all into storage.

1719
01:14:31,056 --> 01:14:32,623
- [Bianca] But, Mom...
- [Mom] No buts.

1720
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:34,959
This is the last time.

1721
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:37,063
[Emmet] <i>Help! Anyone?</i>

1722
01:14:37,663 --> 01:14:39,195
<i>Hello?</i>

1723
01:14:39,197 --> 01:14:41,865
[Rex] <i>No one heard me.
No one came for me.</i>

1724
01:14:41,867 --> 01:14:44,067
<i>I was left behind. Forgotten.</i>

1725
01:14:44,069 --> 01:14:47,271
<i>While the rest of my so-called
friends danced and sang</i>

1726
01:14:47,273 --> 01:14:49,943
<i>at the hands of a monster.</i>

1727
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:56,414
<i>What could I have done
to avoid such a fate?</i>

1728
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:59,049
[Wyldstyle] <i>We also have
to grow up sometime.</i>

1729
01:14:59,051 --> 01:15:02,352
[Abraham Lincoln] <i>Wyldstyle said
you're not tough enough to do this.</i>

1730
01:15:02,354 --> 01:15:04,888
[General Mayhem]
<i>This guy was a fierce warrior?</i>

1731
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:07,825
[Surfer Dave] <i>Yeah, dude,
you're a total Hufflepuff.</i>

1733
01:15:09,996 --> 01:15:13,731
[Rex] <i>I was alone with nothing</i>

1734
01:15:13,733 --> 01:15:15,199
<i>but anger.</i>

1735
01:15:15,201 --> 01:15:18,235
<i>But anger was the key
to my freedom.</i>

1736
01:15:18,237 --> 01:15:20,272
[yelling]

1737
01:15:22,608 --> 01:15:24,374

1738
01:15:24,376 --> 01:15:30,149
<i>It was time for me
to take a stand.</i>

[grunting]

1740
01:15:34,754 --> 01:15:36,420
<i>I was real.</i>

1741
01:15:36,422 --> 01:15:39,492
<i>I was no longer the
naive Emmet I used to be.</i>

1742
01:15:42,127 --> 01:15:45,495
<i>I got myself a new vest,
a new head of hair,</i>

1743
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:49,499
<i>and a petulant attitude
towards everything that's lame.</i>

1744
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:52,203
<i>I gave myself a makeover
and became Rex.</i>

1745
01:15:52,205 --> 01:15:55,172
[announcer]
<i>Radical Emmet Xtreme.</i>

1746
01:15:55,174 --> 01:15:59,511
[Rex] <i>I was all grown up,
but I still wasn't free.</i>

1747
01:16:02,214 --> 01:16:04,449
<i>I knew the only way
to move past it</i>

1748
01:16:04,451 --> 01:16:07,352
<i>was to make sure it never
happened in the first place.</i>

1749
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:08,886
[Bianca] It's a dance party!

1750
01:16:08,888 --> 01:16:10,487
[Rex] <i>And then I saw a way</i>

1751
01:16:10,489 --> 01:16:14,057
<i>to undo all the unbearable
pain I'd experienced</i>

1752
01:16:14,059 --> 01:16:16,994
<i>in one convoluted move...</i>

1753
01:16:16,996 --> 01:16:19,295
<i>Called time travel.</i>

1754
01:16:19,297 --> 01:16:21,498
Sorry, Doc,
gonna need your DeLorean.

1755
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:24,101
And, Bill, Ted,
your phone booth.

1756
01:16:24,103 --> 01:16:26,169
Doctor Who's TARDIS.
H.G. Wells' bicycle thing.

1757
01:16:26,171 --> 01:16:27,471
Whatever Skynet's been using.

1758
01:16:27,473 --> 01:16:29,073
And this hot tub.

1759
01:16:29,075 --> 01:16:30,740
<i>I built a time-traveling
spaceship</i>

1760
01:16:30,742 --> 01:16:32,978
- <i>and blasted into the past.</i>
- [electricity crackling]

1761
01:16:36,148 --> 01:16:37,684
- <i>I picked up a crew.</i>
- [raptors screeching]

1762
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:43,553
[Rex] <i>Then I traveled
to the moment right before</i>

1763
01:16:43,555 --> 01:16:48,694
<i>I was thrown into the cold,
dark truth of the world.</i>

1764
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:58,171
<i>And I found the one person
I wanted to protect.</i>

1765
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,274
- Whoa!
- [Rex] <i>Me.</i>

1766
01:17:03,643 --> 01:17:05,709
I was following everything you
said, except for...

1767
01:17:05,711 --> 01:17:09,148
Everything after the part
where you said, "I'm you."

1768
01:17:10,448 --> 01:17:12,652
Literally the first thing
I said.

1769
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,152
This time travel stuff's
always kinda confusing.

1770
01:17:16,154 --> 01:17:17,454
It's best just to go with it.

1771
01:17:17,456 --> 01:17:19,390
You tricked me
into hurting my friends?

1772
01:17:19,392 --> 01:17:23,192
I didn't trick you.
I taught you to harden your heart,

1773
01:17:23,194 --> 01:17:24,962
just like you asked me to.

1774
01:17:24,964 --> 01:17:26,830
What did you make me do?

1775
01:17:26,832 --> 01:17:30,267
What exactly is Armamageddon?

1776
01:17:30,269 --> 01:17:33,904
- [indistinct arguing]
- [Finn] You stole my guys.

1777
01:17:33,906 --> 01:17:35,039
This is your fault.

1778
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:36,473
What's going on up here?

1779
01:17:36,475 --> 01:17:38,575
[Finn] She took my guys
and she ruined them.

1780
01:17:38,577 --> 01:17:40,777
- [both arguing]
- All right, all right!

1781
01:17:40,779 --> 01:17:43,079
[Wyldstyle] <i>Armamageddon.</i>

1782

<i>Okay. Really?</i>

1784
01:17:47,854 --> 01:17:49,686
[exclaiming] Guys.

1785
01:17:49,688 --> 01:17:52,789
I know I said it was the last
time, the last time,

1786
01:17:52,791 --> 01:17:54,725
and the time before that.

1787
01:17:54,727 --> 01:17:56,927
But this is the last...

1788
01:17:56,929 --> 01:17:58,163
Last time.

1789
01:17:59,165 --> 01:18:00,763
I need... [screams]

1790
01:18:00,765 --> 01:18:02,134
I stepped on a brick.

1791
01:18:03,402 --> 01:18:05,002
[breathes deeply] I'm just...

1792
01:18:05,004 --> 01:18:09,005
I'm doing breathing,
so that it takes the pain away.

1793
01:18:09,007 --> 01:18:11,208
I need... [screaming]

1794
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:13,643
[groaning]

1795
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:15,945
Close to childbirth.

1796
01:18:15,947 --> 01:18:19,450
Very close in pain level to childbirth.
[inhales deeply]

1797
01:18:19,452 --> 01:18:21,252
You guys
know the consequences.

1798
01:18:21,254 --> 01:18:23,553
I need you guys to put
all the bricks into storage.

- No, no, no, Mom, please.
- Please, please. One more chance.

1801
01:18:27,259 --> 01:18:29,159
Finn, I want you
to go downstairs

1802
01:18:29,161 --> 01:18:32,429
and put away your
dystopian wasteland thing.

1803
01:18:32,431 --> 01:18:35,132
- It's Apocalypseburg.
- I don't care what it's called.

1804
01:18:35,134 --> 01:18:37,133
Bianca, I need you
to clean up here.

1805
01:18:37,135 --> 01:18:38,602
Mom, it's not fair.

1806
01:18:38,604 --> 01:18:40,237
[Mom] Look, I'm not
the bad guy in this story.

1807
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:41,972
I'm just an amusing
side character.

1808
01:18:41,974 --> 01:18:43,606
- And you're the one who took my guys.
- How is it my fault?

1809
01:18:43,608 --> 01:18:45,741
[Mom] Hon, I could really
use your help up here.

1810
01:18:45,743 --> 01:18:49,079
[The Man Upstairs] Kids, do the thing...
Uh, what your mother said.

1811
01:18:49,081 --> 01:18:51,684
You heard your father's
super helpful contribution.

1812
01:18:53,185 --> 01:18:54,851
[sighs]

1813
01:18:54,853 --> 01:18:56,719
You ruined everything.

1814
01:18:56,721 --> 01:18:59,158
I just wanted you
to play with me.

01:19:05,564 --> 01:19:09,768
[Wyldstyle]
<i>Emmet, what have you done?</i>

1816
01:19:11,804 --> 01:19:13,204
What have we done?

1817
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:14,871
[Rex] It's called growing up.

1818
01:19:14,873 --> 01:19:16,106
Isn't that what you wanted?

1819
01:19:16,108 --> 01:19:17,975
No. I wanna save my friends.

1820
01:19:17,977 --> 01:19:21,244
You don't have friends.
They're just pieces of plastic.

1821
01:19:21,246 --> 01:19:22,980
[chuckles] You still want to
go back

1822
01:19:22,982 --> 01:19:24,981
- to the Matrix when you know the truth?
- What's the Matrix?

1823
01:19:24,983 --> 01:19:28,151
It's a movie only cool, older,
mature dudes like us have seen.

1824
01:19:28,153 --> 01:19:30,887
It's time to put away
childish things.

1825
01:19:30,889 --> 01:19:32,623
No.

1826
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:34,356
My friends may not be real to
you, but they're real to me.

1827
01:19:34,358 --> 01:19:36,026
And they're my family.

1828
01:19:36,028 --> 01:19:37,397
I won't give up on 'em.

1829
01:19:41,367 --> 01:19:45,067
I am so disappointed
in myself.

1830
01:19:45,069 --> 01:19:48,204
I guess you're gonna have
to become me the hard way.

1831

This isn't the end!
It can't be.

1864

This isn't one of those things
with a downer cliffhanger ending.

1865
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:42,012
Uh-uh. No, no.
This needs to have a happy ending.

1866
01:22:42,014 --> 01:22:43,813
Seems like a downer to me.

1867
01:22:43,815 --> 01:22:47,183

It's no rush or anything.

No! No, no, no!
It's only over if we give up.

Well, it's over
and we're giving up.

No. It's too late.
