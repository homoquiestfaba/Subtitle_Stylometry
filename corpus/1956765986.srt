1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:07,470
Hello?

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,130
Where the hell is everybody?

3
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,120
Woo!

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,590
Save it.

5
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,370
Where the hell is everybody?

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,640
You know I just asked
 myself the same question.

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,200
Hey, Cody, how you been?

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,630
I've been in deep space so
 long I have no idea what it is.

9
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,630
Well, you're here, and
 that's all that matters.

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,570
Me?

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,080
I've been hauling carbonite in
 the matterite system so long,

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,930
I can taste it.

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,140
You ever taste carbonite?

14
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,700
I can't say that I have.

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,900
Well, you don't want to.

16
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,800
It's nasty.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,050
It tastes like
 dirty metal socks.

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,260
That's nice, and as
 much as I would love

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,900
to talk to you about this
 all I really want to know

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,800
is what in the hell
 is going on here?

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,080
I mean, where are the pilots?

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,610
Where are the gamblers?

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,340
Where are the women?

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,580
Gone, gone, and gone.

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,710
Hello, boys.

26
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,760
Been a long time.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,130
Yeah, I'll say.

28
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,330
You know, what happened?

29
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,650
What's going on?

30
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,120
The end of Andromeda.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,840
The pleasure planet is over.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,500
No, no, no,
 don't you say that.

33
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,770
I traveled half the
 galaxy to get here.

34
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,110
You said your business was fun.

35
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,730
Well, I want some
 of that business.

36
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:50,050
Hey, I wish I could oblige,
 boys, but the fun has run out.

37
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:50,750
Whoa.

38
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,510
Whoa.

39
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,210
I don't get this.

40
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,840
I mean, what's happened?

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
Times change.

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,580
People move on.

43
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:02,950
Nowadays, it's all virtual
 reality and programmable dates.

44
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,420
No one wants to do it the
 old fashioned way anymore.

45
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,310
I do.

46
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,100
Cody?

47
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,330
That is why we're here.

48
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,750
Whoa, I know what's going on.

49
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,560
In a second, everybody is going
 to jump out and yell surprise.

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,430
OK, I'm ready.

51
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,130
Surprise me.

52
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,780
Oh, man, this is bad.

53
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,670
This is horrible.

54
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,370
Mhm.

55
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,760
Woo hoo!

56
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,200
Hey, what the hell is going on?

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,640
Just take a look around, Omar.

58
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,880
It doesn't get any
 better than this?

59
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,610
What?

60
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,450
But where, how, why?

61
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,030
I was just telling
 the boys it's over.

62
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,380
People move on.

63
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,930
The old ways are just
 not in fashion anymore.

64
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,320
Nah, this isn't right.

65
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,890
This place stands for something

66
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,820
God.

67
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,800
I mean, I lost my--

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,500
Hey!

69
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,380
Well, I had a lot
 of good memories here.

70
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,150
Yeah, that's true.

71
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,230
You remember those Venetian
 girls that used to work here?

72
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,900
Remember what they could
 do with a piece of fruit?

73
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,920
I remember the time I
 was with the Saturn twins.

74
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,270
I don't think I came out
 of the room for three days.

75
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,060
Four days.

76
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,800
Right.

77
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,500
That's what I mean.

78
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,700
This place is great.

79
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,570
We can't let it go to waste.

80
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,180
I can if nobody
 wants to work here.

81
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,800
Take a look around
 I've got no girls.

82
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,440
No girls, no space jockeys.

83
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,140
No space jockeys, no business.

84
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,910
Bye bye, Andromeda.

85
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,510
We can't let this happen.

86
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,940
It's too late.

87
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,870
God.

88
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,830
Look, it's over.

89
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,420
This isn't right.

90
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,680
I mean, we've got do something.

91
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,480
It's over.

92
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,250
Wrong, it's not over
 until we say it's over.

93
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,730
We're pilots damn it.

94
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,550
OK, we travel into deep space
 and come back again, OK.

95
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,880
We've faced hostile
 aliens, Orion pirates.

96
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,730
I mean, you name it, we
 either freaking blown

97
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,440
it up or ran away from it, OK.

98
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,560
And what do we get for
 all our troubles, huh?

99
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,330
Some credits that we
 never get a chance

100
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,520
to spend in the Alliance
 Bank and a few days R and R

101
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,960
in Andromeda.

102
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,330
And now you're going
 to sit here and tell

103
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,250
me that Andromeda is no more.

104
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,360
Forget it.

105
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,950
I ain't going out like that.

106
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,890
Who's with me?

107
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,860
I am.

108
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,180
He don't even know
 what he's talking about.

109
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,510
Yeah, but, well,
 I'm with you anyway.

110
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,750
Mabel, you still got
 that wormhole transport.

111
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,520
It's a little dusty,
 but it's still work.

112
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,160
How about the returns?

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,530
Just take the pad
 with you when you go.

114
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,230
Hit return.

115
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,440
I haven't had a problem yet.

116
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,280
Perfect.

117
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,700
With that we can transport
 to any place in the galaxy.

118
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,760
What do you say we go get
 some new girls for Mabel?

119
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,460
Yeah.

120
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,870
Yeah, I'm in with that.

121
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,610
You've been in
 a vacuum to long.

122
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,880
Yeah, but will you do it.

123
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,640
Hell, yes.

124
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,460
You boys really
 don't have to do this.

125
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,300
Oh, yeah, yeah.

126
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,440
Don't you worry, Mabel.

127
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,670
We're going to
 take care of this,

128
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,350
because I know
 where the women are

129
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,530
the most beautiful and the
 most beguiling in the universe.

130
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,020
Women, they write songs about.

131
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:07,010
Women so pure that no man
 has ever touched them.

132
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,660
The one planet that's
 off limits to any male.

133
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,360
No.

134
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,300
No, no, no, no, no, no.

135
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,210
Eros.

136
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,120
Eros.

137
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,820
Eros.

138
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,550
Is this Eros?

139
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,840
This is it.

140
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,090
Excellent.

141
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,480
So what next?

142
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,440
Oh, let's split up.

143
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,270
We can cover more
 ground that way.

144
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,020
We'll meet right
 back here at sundown,

145
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,020
and guys let's be careful.

146
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,080
Just beaming here we broke about
 six intergalactic treaties.

147
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,070
Six?

148
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,990
Yeah, even though
 this planet's

149
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,470
only colonized by women,
 they all don't get along.

150
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,970
They've developed
 their own factions.

151
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,080
They make up their own rules.

152
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,170
They're completely autonomous.

153
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,460
How do you know so much?

154
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,570
It's a hobby.

155
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,180
All right, let's get moving.

156
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,760
And guys, try to
 avoid large groups, OK.

157
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,440
You'll do much
 better one on one.

158
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,440
But what happens
 in large groups?

159
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,680
You'll get captured
 and tortured to death.

160
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
Tortured.

161
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,170
Move it.

162
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:03,240
One on one is nice, but
 two on two is even better.

163
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,070
All right, who's there?

164
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,970
Cody?

165
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,180
Jeter?

166
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,210
Quit playing around.

167
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,660
Hey.

168
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,150
Hi, how's it going?

169
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:06,480
OK, look, I know I'm
 not supposed to be here.

170
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,020
I got lost.

171
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,090
I just got lost, and I just--

172
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,870
oh, well, all right.

173
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,570
That's more like it.

174
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,490
Take me to your leader.

175
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,970
But you are our leader.

176
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,170
I didn't mean to scare you.

178
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,240
I mean, you no harm.

179
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,840
I come in peace.

180
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,280
That's right.

181
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,250
You can touch me.

182
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,540
You can touch me.

183
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,560
I won't bite not unless you ask.

184
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,360
What the hell?

185
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,640
Hey, how's it going?

186
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,110
Hey, let me out of here.

187
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,710
I'm a citizen of the
 Intergalactic Alliance.

188
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,720
You can't hold me.

189
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm out of here.

190
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,610
Great.

191
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,300
No remote.

192
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,680
This is nice.

193
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
What the hell's going on?

194
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,900
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,980
I didn't mean to scare you.

196
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,590
I'm just not
 feeling like myself.

197
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,010
Kind of get that way when
 you're tied to stake you know.

198
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,040
Hey, you're from the
 Tribe, aren't you?

199
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,450
Back to nature.

200
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,850
I envy you.

201
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,800
Excuse me.

202
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,300
What's that for?

203
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,800
Hello, I'm speaking here.

204
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,660
You're in the
 forbidden jungle.

205
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,480
No man is allowed here.

206
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,200
So you can talk.

207
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,080
Tomorrow you'll be burned
 alive for your crimes.

208
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,530
What crimes?

209
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:27,060
Stupid man, trespassing.

210
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,320
Hey, stop.

211
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,450
You can't sacrifice me.

212
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,800
I just got here.

213
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
I can sacrifice you
 right now if I want.

214
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,890
It makes no difference to me.

215
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,590
OK.

216
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,070
OK.

217
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,390
Later's fine.

218
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,850
Don't I at least get a phone
 call, a lawyer, anything?

219
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,330
Well, go on.

220
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,600
I'll be here when you get back.

221
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,300
Great.

222
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,560
If this is
 torture, keep it up.

223
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,000
Our king must be anointed
 with the sacred oil

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,640
before he's crowned.

225
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,340
OK.

226
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,630
Is this pleasing
 to His Majesty?

227
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,610
Oh, yes.

228
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,310
Oh, yes.

229
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,040
How did I get picked
 to be king actually?

230
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,170
It's written in
 the sacred scrolls

231
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,380
that our king once
 banished will return.

232
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,660
The one who walks as a man who
 walks into our village is king.

233
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,710
So any guy that walked into
 the village could be king?

234
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,060
Only the chosen one.

235
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,970
Oh, right.

236
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,800
Right.

237
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,310
Right.

238
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,190
OK, so what's your name?

239
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,610
I'm called Roxy.

240
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,650
Roxy?

241
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,180
Roxy, I like that.

242
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,830
So what do you do here, Roxy.

243
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,600
I've been waiting
 for your arrival.

244
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,040
Really?

245
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,540
That's it.

246
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,220
I've been trained
 by the holy sisters

247
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,950
my entire life to serve
 the king once he returns.

248
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,420
Wow, it must have been
 pretty boring waiting for me.

249
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,680
The anticipation
 it's been terrible.

250
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,710
I'll bet.

251
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,610
I'll bet.

252
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,310
So what did these
 sisters teach you anyway?

253
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,810
Hello?

254
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,850
Anybody?

255
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,510
I have rights, you know.

256
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,550
The Intergalactic Alliance
 planetary conference clearly

257
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:59,320
states that no traveler
 traveling with an alliance base

258
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,810
shall be imprisoned
 against his will.

259
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,720
Now I don't want to have
 to get ugly on this,

260
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,020
but my cousin,
 well, he's a lawyer.

261
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,820
All right.

262
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,020
Now that's what
 I'm talking about.

263
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,090
Good morning, Mr. Jacobs,
 or can I call you Cody?

264
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,710
Who are are?

265
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,930
And what in the hell
 is going on here?

266
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,250
Language, Cody.

267
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,390
Language.

268
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,010
What is this?

269
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,460
I am prefect Alexa,
 the ruler of this sect,

270
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,580
and you were caught
 trespassing in our territory.

271
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,240
There are no men allowed.

272
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,880
Why do you think I came here?

273
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,070
There are clear
 warning beacons.

274
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,690
The Galactic
 Alliance has honored

275
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,830
our desire to stay isolated.

276
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,820
I didn't think a little
 visit would be so bad.

277
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,520
Is that right?

278
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,340
What is that?

279
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,860
A mob of anxious women
 outside this building.

280
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,520
They've heard of your
 arrival and would like

281
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,720
to see a man for themselves.

282
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,340
Really?

283
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,150
Well, bring them on.

284
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,100
I'm anxious to meet them.

285
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,330
You see, Cody.

286
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,640
I can't let that happen.

287
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,360
Leave us.

288
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:46,110
Your presence here is causing
 quite a bit of a problem.

289
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,520
Then send me back.

290
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,280
It's not that simple.

291
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,580
If I do that, the problem
 will still linger.

292
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,040
And what problem
 would that be?

293
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,160
Men are a disease.

294
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,540
They infect us, distract
 us, and generally

295
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,550
lower the standard of living.

296
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,520
Correct me if I'm
 wrong, but without men

297
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,560
there wouldn't be any women.

298
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,300
It takes two to tango
 if you get my drift.

299
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,160
Please, we perfected
 successful breeding programs

300
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,690
eons ago.

301
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,680
All we need from you is
 your essence of life.

302
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,720
We get that delivered COD.

303
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,840
Yeah, I can see how
 horrible we are.

304
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,960
Is that why you can't
 keep your hands off me?

305
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,320
I think of you as sort
 of a pet, a plaything.

306
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,940
It's been a long time since--

307
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,890
never mind.

308
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,990
I intend to prove to
 the population once

309
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:49,440
and for all exactly
 how evil men are.

310
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,240
You don't mind, do you?

311
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Please knock yourself out.

312
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,940
Thank you.

313
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,740
This conductor will
 read your brain impulses

314
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,800
and transfer them to images.

315
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,630
We'll see what's on your mind.

316
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,640
My mind's an open book.

317
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,830
That's what I'm afraid of.

318
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,120
I'll be broadcasting
 your brain

319
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,250
activity to the population.

320
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,840
They'll see for themselves.

321
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,560
Cody TV, I love it.

322
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,230
So Cody, what
 brings you to Eros?

323
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,130
I was just exploring a part of
 the galaxy I haven't been to.

324
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,410
I'm a curious guy.

325
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,390
I see.

326
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,180
So you were just in
 the neighborhood,

327
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,660
and what are your thoughts
 on our lovely planet?

328
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,890
It's nice.

329
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,980
It's a little too floral
 for my taste, but it's nice.

330
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,380
Too floral?

331
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,080
Wait a minute.

332
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,980
I wasn't finished.

333
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,240
Oh, you're finished.

334
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,910
Tomorrow you'll be put on
 trial for insurrection,

335
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:48,150
a crime punishable by death.

336
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,970
You can't do that.

337
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,410
Disgusting.

338
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,180
Guard, take this beast
 back to his cell.

339
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,880
Wait a minute.

340
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,610
What about the kiss?

341
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,310
You felt that.

342
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,150
Hey, am I glad to see you.

343
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,190
I couldn't get through
 to that other one.

344
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,550
No see, that's not
 the thing to do.

345
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,250
Listen to me.

346
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,980
Could you just stop
 that for a minute?

347
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,900
Don't do that.

348
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,120
Now I'm getting pissed.

349
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,970
You keep blabbering like
 that I'll kill you sooner.

350
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,770
Finally, somebody
 speaks to me.

351
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,210
Why were you in the
 forbidden jungle?

352
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,320
Look, it's a long story, and
 I don't have a lot of time here.

353
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,540
Could you maybe, the ropes?

354
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,230
Uh, no.

355
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,290
My name's Omar.

356
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,460
I'm called Becca.

357
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,380
Becca, that's pretty.

358
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,660
Becca, listen?

359
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't mean to hurt anybody.

360
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,760
OK.

361
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,990
I was just in
 the neighborhood.

362
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,820
I thought I'd come down
 and check out the plant.

363
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,910
See this is why we don't
 allow men here, because they

364
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,130
lie every chance they get.

365
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,830
OK.

366
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,090
OK, fine.

367
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,170
OK.

368
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,000
I came here to
 try and bring back

369
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
a couple of girls
 to planet Andromeda

370
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,990
to the serve as party girls.

371
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,540
Don't kill me.

372
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,420
Thanks.

373
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,610
Now strip.

374
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,940
Pardon me?

375
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,060
Well, if I'm going to
 save your miserable life

376
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,330
I at least want to know what
 I'm getting for my slave?

377
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,260
Slave.

378
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,020
Hold on a minute.

379
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,550
Strip or die.

380
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,680
Well, when you
 put it like that.

381
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,750
You'll do.

382
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,450
What?

383
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,340
Hey, where you going?

384
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,040
Come on, slave.

385
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,810
We have to leave before
 they kill us both.

386
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,160
What's this?

387
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,210
You carry.

388
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,140
Let's go.

389
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,690
This isn't what
 I bargained for.

390
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,390
Move it.

391
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,610
Your Majesty.

392
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,590
Roxy.

393
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,140
Is it time for another bath?

394
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,910
Time for you to rule.

395
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,080
All right, OK.

396
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,550
Tell me what I need to do.

397
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,320
You must sit-in judgment.

398
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,000
When the women of our
 village are in dispute

399
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,590
it is the king who
 decides their fate.

400
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,130
Well, what did you
 do before I got here?

401
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,190
We never decided our fate.

402
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,890
Very well.

403
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,580
So tell me what this
 dispute is all about?

404
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,980
She stole my recipe.

405
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,590
It was a family recipe,
 and I didn't still anything.

406
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,260
The same ingredients,
 the same spices,

407
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,660
how could you not steal it?

408
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,760
It's a wonder the
 women of your house

409
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,430
haven't dropped dead
 from starvation.

410
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,280
She-devil.

411
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,490
- Witch.
 - Hold it.

412
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,320
Hold it.

413
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,120
You don't need to fight.

414
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,680
Can't we all just
 get along here.

415
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,520
Come on.

416
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,340
Recipes are very
 coveted in our village.

417
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,620
To steal a recipe
 is a high crime,

418
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:58,160
and to accuse another
 falsely is also a high crime.

419
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,080
You people need to lighten up.

420
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,210
Your Majesty.

421
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,590
OK, I'll tell you what.

422
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,560
You take your recipe,
 and go bake your pie.

423
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,810
You take your recipe,
 and go bake your pie.

424
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,270
You both bring your
 pies back here.

425
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,410
I'll taste it.

426
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:18,330
And who's ever is better,
 that's the recipe.

427
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,330
You're as wise
 as you are kind.

428
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,650
I do what I can for my people.

429
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,870
You're kind.

430
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,730
I must be dreaming.

431
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,120
And I am not waking
 up anytime soon.

432
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,820
Oh, great.

433
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,520
It's you two.

434
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,570
Go away.

435
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,340
You got me into this.

436
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,480
We have never
 seen a man before.

437
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,800
Would you mind disrobing?

438
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,240
Excuse me?

439
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,460
Could we see all of you?

440
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,470
We have heard stories
 of extra appendages.

441
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,810
Hey, I do all
 right for myself.

442
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,830
No complaints so far.

443
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,040
Well, we would like
 to see for ourselves.

444
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,480
Listen, I am not a
 meat puppet on display.

445
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,180
Buzz off.

446
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,350
So what did you two
 do before I came?

447
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,730
Look.

448
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,100
Hey, you got me, but
 you really don't--

449
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,440
Hey, don't you ever rest.

450
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,230
We've got to keep moving.

451
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,090
Yeah, well, how about
 carrying some of this crap.

452
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,440
Maybe you wouldn't
 be in such a hurry.

453
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,470
That's it.

454
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,840
Look lady, I'm tired.

455
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,540
I'm hot.

456
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,840
I'm thirsty.

457
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,250
OK, I'm not taking another step.

458
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,540
You know what?

459
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,800
Go ahead and kill me.

460
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,660
OK, it's going to be better
 than this death march.

461
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,630
I wish you'd
 make up your mind.

462
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,290
I just needed to remind myself
 what I'm doing this for.

463
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,430
Very well.

464
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,940
You rest here.

465
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,460
I'm going to go get
 us some berries.

466
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,740
I'll be right back.

467
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,930
Thanks.

468
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,630
Thanks a lot.

469
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,870
And that is how
 you handle a woman.

470
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,030
That was fast, my sweet.

471
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,240
Ah, we've already
 played this game.

472
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:04,940
You!

473
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,810
Thought you could escape me.

474
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,880
It wasn't my idea really.

475
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,810
Move it up.

476
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,880
You know since we're out,
 what would be the big deal

477
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,170
of just like letting me go.

478
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,630
OK, I had this little remote
 pad with a lot of little buttons

479
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,130
on it, kind of small, you know.

480
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,010
The toy is in the cave.

481
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,820
Well, tell you what, OK.

482
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,340
I get my hands on that,
 I push a little button,

483
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,090
and I'm out of
 your life for good.

484
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:29,860
What do you say, toots?

485
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,410
Move it.

486
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,250
So I can take that as a yes?

487
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,570
You broke our lives.

488
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,880
You pay the price.

489
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,580
I guess I'm going
 to take that as a no.

490
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,280
All right.

491
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,170
All right.

492
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:39,870
Geeze.

493
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,500
How much further?

494
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,150
Quiet.

495
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,250
Another charmer.

496
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,840
How about a five minute break?

497
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,130
Keep moving.

498
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,660
Well, suppose I
 can't, you know.

499
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,770
Suppose I just stopped.

500
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,750
I just need a rest
 for five minutes.

501
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,910
You know, I'm not used
 to all this walking.

502
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,120
I'm a space pilot.

503
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,710
Technology's made you weak.

504
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:07,830
No argument.

505
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,530
I'm a weak, pathetic
 excuse for a human being.

506
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,660
For a man.

507
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,190
OK, fine, for a man, you know.

508
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,850
But for a society who shuns
 the all the evil that men do,

509
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,250
you seemed as though you've
 come up with just as much evil.

510
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,480
What do you mean?

511
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,600
I mean, killing somebody,
 because they wandered

512
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,110
into your sacred jungle.

513
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,900
How advanced is that?

514
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,790
Without the threat of
 death, men would be here.

515
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,030
And what's the crime in that?

516
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,980
We don't need them.

517
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,460
We don't want them.

518
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,380
Have you ever been with one?

519
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,080
What?

520
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,920
A man.

521
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,830
Have you ever been with a man?

522
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,530
No.

523
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,780
Well, then how do
 you know we're so evil?

524
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,430
It is written.

525
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,630
Don't believe
 everything you read.

526
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,670
Strip.

527
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,400
What?

528
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,760
Strip.

529
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,940
I want to see this myself.

530
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,690
What's a guy to do?

531
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,940
Trader, prepare to die.

532
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,290
God, will this ever end?

533
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,770
What is it lunchtime?

534
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,390
You gals cook fast.

535
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:26,120
They're ready for you to
 judge them, your Majesty.

536
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,920
So what is this recipe anyway?

537
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,380
A simple, yet exquisite pie.

538
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,680
Pie?

539
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,580
All this is over a pie?

540
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,470
Not just any pie.

541
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,600
Here taste.

542
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,620
No, taste mine first.

543
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,460
Whoa, whoa, ladies please.

544
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,750
Let's not start that again, OK.

545
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,840
I have an idea.

546
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,570
Eeny, meeny, miney, moe.

547
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,110
Oh my god, that is bad.

548
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,490
That's bad.

549
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,020
You should be
 ashamed of yourself.

550
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,590
That's--

551
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,290
OK.

552
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,200
Oh, that's even worse.

553
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,970
What is wrong with you?

554
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,420
What is wrong with you?

555
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,280
Those are inedible.

556
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,290
I can't-- are you
 trying to kill me?

557
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,440
Roxy?

558
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,140
Roxy?

559
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,640
You're a false King.

560
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,340
What?

561
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,240
What are you talking about?

562
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,630
A real King would never allow
 this in our sacred throne.

563
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,380
No, you're a false King.

564
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,670
Take him away.

565
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,510
Wait a second, no.

566
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:46,720
No, actually those pies were
 actually pretty good actually

567
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,160
now that I'm thinking about it.

568
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,430
Can I have another bite?

569
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,620
We really need to
 stop meeting like this.

570
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,760
You're causing me
 quite a bit of trouble.

571
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,370
It's what I live for.

572
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,440
Too bad you won't
 be living for long.

573
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,610
What do you mean?

574
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,580
I mean, I've met with
 the Arrows Tribunal.

575
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,570
You've been found
 guilty of insurrection.

576
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,270
Look.

577
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,370
If there's a fine, I'll pay it.

578
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,080
Just let me go, and
 I'll be on my way.

579
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,930
The fine is your life.

580
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:14,920
Excuse me?

581
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,130
You're to be executed at dawn.

582
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,750
You can't do that.

583
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,850
My planet, my rules.

584
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,440
Just because I'm a man?

585
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,900
We've worked hard
 in this society

586
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,510
not to have any
 destructive forces.

587
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,130
And we live in
 peace and harmony.

588
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,510
It's because there are no men
 that we can accomplish this.

589
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,600
Oh, great.

590
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,310
I'm sure you'll
 all be very happy.

591
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,480
We are.

592
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,820
As part of your sentence, you
 are granted one final request.

593
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,690
Let me go.

594
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,700
Afraid not.

595
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,120
Fine, then kiss me.

596
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,930
I'm sorry?

597
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:47,630
Kiss me.

598
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,760
It's my last request.

599
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,450
If I'm going to die, I want
 the taste of your lips on mine.

600
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,540
Please.

601
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:57,760
Besides what harm can it do.

602
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,390
You can live without men, right?

603
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,980
One little kiss isn't
 going to change that.

604
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,050
It's not that--

605
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:04,760
Coward.

606
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,460
Pig.

607
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,110
You know, this
 could work a lot

608
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,130
better if I could use my hands.

609
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:17,830
Of course.

610
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,690
Now are you sure you
 don't want to rethink

611
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,370
that whole execution thing?

612
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,600
You're right.

613
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,140
I should kill you tonight.

614
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,510
Guard.

615
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,830
This man has violated me.

616
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,540
Prepare him for his execution.

617
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,980
You are one mean bitch.

618
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,850
Take him now.

619
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,510
Well, this is just great.

620
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,210
He's mine.

621
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,210
He's mine.

622
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,260
Ladies please, there's
 enough of me to go around.

623
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,960
Silence

624
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,110
Silence.

625
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,910
OK.

626
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,370
I challenge you.

627
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,700
I accept.

628
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Ow.

629
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,190
Ow, my hair.

630
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,680
Stop it.

631
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,170
Ow.

632
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,960
Bitch.

633
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,660
Whore.

634
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,280
Another man on a planet.

635
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,290
It's an epidemic.

636
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,440
He is a false prophet.

637
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,660
According to our laws,
 he must be put to death.

638
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,810
And you being
 such a peace loving

639
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,020
sect cannot possibly think of
 doing such an evil-minded act.

640
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,160
Is that it?

641
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,890
You have always been the one
 to govern with a firm hand.

642
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,930
Govern him.

643
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:44,810
But when I propose
 unity, you stay away.

644
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,540
Don't you think that's a little
 bit of a double standard?

645
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,480
I just don't want
 to deal with the man.

646
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,950
He's gotten to you, hasn't he?

647
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,160
No, I was with them,
 but it meant nothing.

648
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,290
Right.

649
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:56,990
Fine.

650
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,340
I'll handle your
 dirty work for you.

651
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,720
You can't throw me in here.

652
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,790
I'm the king.

653
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,490
Jeter?

654
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,260
Is that you?

655
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,070
Cody?

656
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,720
What the hell happened?

657
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,050
How'd you get caught?

658
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,990
I don't know.

659
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,120
I mean, one
 second I'm the kind,

660
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,240
and the next thing I'm in jail.

661
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,590
How about you?

662
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,340
Long story.

663
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,210
I'm not going anywhere.

664
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,260
I only hope Omar can
 find us and bust us out.

665
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,450
Hey Omar, knows his planet.

666
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:25,660
He'll be here to rescue us.

667
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,360
Trust me.

668
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,770
I've had it.

669
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,850
First, you tie me up.

670
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,100
Then you untie me.

671
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,220
Then Becca takes me away.

672
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,080
Then Zula takes me away.

673
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,020
I'm sick and tired of running.

674
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,570
I don't know.

675
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,960
You want to spear me?

676
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,660
Go right ahead.

677
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,160
Take your best shot,
 but I'm not going

678
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,720
anywhere with either of you.

679
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,290
We want to go with you.

680
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,770
We're sick and tired of
 these primitive ways.

681
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,970
Really?

682
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,170
We're too stubborn to
 admit it to each other.

683
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,880
Our tribe traveled too
 far away from society.

684
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,800
We want to go back.

685
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,570
Then why don't you just
 join one of the other sects

686
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,540
on the planet?

687
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,360
We miss men.

688
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,470
A lot.

689
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,520
Well, what can I say?

690
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,150
Once you've had a taste of
 Omar, there's no going back.

691
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,120
Well, actually,
 we think you're

692
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,450
an excellent lover, but--

693
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,150
But.

694
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,850
But?

695
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,400
We've been so
 long without a man,

696
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,770
we have a lot of
 making up to do.

697
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:37,550
I see.

698
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,900
You're not upset, are you?

699
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,270
As a matter of fact, I might
 have a little proposition

700
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,290
for both of you.

701
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:47,250
Do one of you have that little
 remote pad that I was carrying?

702
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,210
Excellent.

703
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,340
You sure you want to go back?

704
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,490
We're sure.

705
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,280
All right, give me a hug.

706
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,320
Come on.

707
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,410
It's Andromeda.

708
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,900
Mabel, say hi to your
 two newest hostesses.

709
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,490
Oh, nice look.

710
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,070
What is this place?

711
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,830
Oh, don't worry.

712
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,320
You're safe here.

713
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,020
Are you hungry?

714
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,650
A little earthy, but
 nothing a good sonic shower

715
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,050
couldn't clean up.

716
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,130
So where are the boys?

717
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,630
I thought they were with you.

718
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,230
You, mean they
 haven't come back yet?

719
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,720
I thought I'd be
 the last one here.

720
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,180
I was starting to think
 that y'all forgot about me.

721
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,070
Something's not right.

722
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,200
I told you guys not to go
 messing with that planet.

723
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,260
Listen, will you take
 care of these two for me?

724
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,460
I'll go back, and
 I'll find out what

725
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,870
happened to Cody and Jeter.

726
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,430
What if you don't come back.

727
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,320
Well, you can automatically
 program this to return, right?

728
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,030
Sure.

729
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,500
OK, well, give me two hours.

730
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,660
Wherever I am just beam me back.

731
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,040
Hopefully, I'll
 be with the guys.

732
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,740
Wish me luck.

733
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,990
You have food for us.

734
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,060
First a little shower fun.

735
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,040
If I'm going to get
 customers back here, you two

736
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,480
cannot be stinking up my joint.

737
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,280
Excuse me, have you
 seen a man around here?

738
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,320
Don't remind us.

739
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,060
Our heart is breaking.

740
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,880
That's got to be Cody.

741
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,180
If you take me to
 him, I'm sure I could

742
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,130
put in a good word for you.

743
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,780
You did not understand.

744
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,990
He and his friend are
 scheduled to be executed.

745
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,790
That's not good.

746
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,090
Can you take me to them?

747
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,460
You'll be captured as well.

748
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,760
Well, then let's make sure
 that that doesn't happen, OK.

749
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,460
Come on.

750
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,230
It's too late.

751
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,550
But I've changed my mind.

752
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,300
I mean, I've
 reinterpreted the laws.

753
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,760
It doesn't work that way.

754
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,150
You cannot control the way
 my people live their lives.

755
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,600
I can when you
 give me that power.

756
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,320
He's a man.

757
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,680
You shouldn't have
 wasted your time.

758
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,460
That is my decision
 to make, not yours.

759
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,360
It was your decision.

760
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,850
I'm proceeding with
 the executions.

761
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,670
It's the only way we can
 keep our planet pure.

762
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,360
Has it ever occurred to you
 that this poison you call man

763
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,220
has effected all of us?

764
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:52,260
We're no better than they are,
 archaic laws, idiotic rules,

765
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,610
punishment by death.

766
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,800
What kind of society is that?

767
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,300
An orderly one.

768
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,780
You are such a man.

769
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,160
She was just so beautiful.

770
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,370
I really thought we were
 going to rule together.

771
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,770
Have you completely lost it?

772
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,650
We were supposed to find
 party girls for the cafe.

773
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,640
Did you forget?

774
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,440
No, but we just
 assumed these girls

775
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,850
were going to jump for us.

776
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,270
We didn't even think to ask.

777
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,570
How civilized is that?

778
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,910
You know, they're right.

779
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,210
All men are pigs.

780
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,730
Now I've heard everything.

781
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,960
Roxy.

782
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,670
What are you doing here?

783
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:42,090
I am so sorry for
 getting you into this.

784
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:44,070
I was so arrogant.

785
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,900
That's OK.

786
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,580
You were just
 following your laws.

787
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,440
Stupid laws.

788
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,760
You were right.

789
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,460
Jeter, who is that?

790
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,450
What's going on?

791
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,650
It's Roxy.

792
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,280
She's come to say goodbye.

793
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,590
We only have five
 minutes, my love.

794
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,300
My love?

795
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,790
Don't waste time talking.

796
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,490
Take me.

797
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,660
I must leave you now.

798
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm sorry I thought
 of you as a concubine.

799
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,740
When did you think that?

800
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,240
I mean, that's
 why we came here.

801
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,640
We were going to take
 you back to Andromeda

802
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,380
and make you a party girl.

803
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,900
But I mean, you mean so
 much more to me, and now--

804
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,390
It's too late.

805
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,740
Would this help me?

806
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,810
My God, where'd you get this?

807
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,000
It doesn't matter.
 It doesn't matter.

808
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,620
Let's go.
 Come on.

809
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,580
We can get out of here now.

810
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,990
I can't leave my people.

811
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,300
Yes, you can.

812
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,390
They won't miss you.
 Come on.

813
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,090
Let's go.

814
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,660
I can't, but you go.

815
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,660
Save yourself.

816
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,840
That would give me
 the most pleasure.

817
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,610
Roxy?

818
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,310
Go.

819
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,100
Jeter, what's going on?

820
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,540
I have the remote.

821
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,180
Well, let's get the
 hell out of here.

822
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,980
I can't leave her.

823
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,060
You want to die?

824
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,160
I don't.

825
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,860
Forget about her.

826
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,560
Come on.

827
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,120
Widen the beam to pick me up.

828
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,020
Let's do it.

829
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,720
Roxy?

830
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,850
Omar, get me out of here.

831
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,020
OK.
 OK.

832
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,720
Thanks.

833
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,500
OK, let's go.

834
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,620
I was never happier to see
 you guys in my entire life.

835
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,510
Let's get out of here.

836
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:41,570
Take us with you.

837
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,470
I can't.

838
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,170
Why?

839
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,800
Because it's wrong.

840
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,720
That a boy.

841
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,370
But we want to be
 with you and only you.

842
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,370
Really?

843
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,800
Hey, you don't get
 many offers like that.

844
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,570
But I'm a pig.

845
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,680
We don't mind.

846
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,630
We can work on that.

847
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,450
I'm licked.

848
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,180
Sorry, sister.

849
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,780
That's gotta hurt.

850
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,730
Hit it, Jeter.

851
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,830
Here is to us.

852
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:31,250
Yeah, we turned
 Andromeda around, man.

853
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,340
At least your two
 girls turned it around.

854
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,980
There is no stopping them.

855
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,960
Yeah, no, I guess living in
 a cave will do that to you.

856
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,570
Cody.

857
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,300
Cody.

858
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,610
I know that tone.

859
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,370
You want more credits?

860
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,660
There's so much
 to shop for using

861
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,640
the Alliance internet is great.

862
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,550
We can get anything we
 want beamed right to us.

863
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,430
When can you take
 us to another planet?

864
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,580
And what's wrong
 with this planet?

865
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,700
Well, nothing, but there's
 just so much more to see.

866
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,580
Yeah, can we leave tomorrow.

867
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,510
Yes, dear.

868
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,250
Whatever you like.

869
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:08,960
Great.

870
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,660
Credits.

871
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:24,420
They certainly
 domesticated you.

872
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,510
It was bound to
 happen sooner or later,

873
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:55,220
Hey, still in the dumps?

874
00:39:55,220 --> 00:40:00,220
I just can't stop
 thinking about her.

875
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,710
I want to go back.

876
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,240
You know what can
 happen if you do that.

877
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,300
It's just not fair.

878
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,430
Hang in there.

879
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,210
Hey, buy you a drink.

880
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,080
I got one.

881
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,360
Come on, buddy.

882
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,370
Cheer up.

883
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,060
I don't want to.

884
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,530
Why don't you ask Zula and
 Becca for a little company.

885
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,020
I'm sure they'd be
 happy to oblige.

886
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,200
Thanks, but no thanks.

887
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,820
You want to take a ride with
 me and the girls tomorrow?

888
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,410
Nah.

889
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,270
You're not just going
 to sit here all day?

890
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:50,970
Yeah.

891
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,890
Yeah.

892
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:55,640
Well, if you decide to come
 with, you know where we're at.

893
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,250
Buy you a drink?

894
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,320
I said no thanks.

895
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,900
Roxy.

896
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,880
What are you doing here?

897
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,480
I guess, I couldn't
 live without you.

898
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,700
What about your laws?

899
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,790
Laws are made to be rewritten.

900
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,760
Well, how did you get here?

901
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,660
Holy crap.

902
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,850
We have some unfinished
 business, Cody.

903
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,430
You can't touch me here.

904
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,130
No?

905
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,000
Fine.

906
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,670
I'll go touch somebody else.

907
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,140
What?

908
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,170
I've decided to re-evaluate
 our planet's position on men

909
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,980
visiting, and I figure
 the only way to do that

910
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:54,110
is to see how they've evolved.

911
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,720
This is as good a
 place to start as any.

912
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,290
So you want to be a hostess?

913
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:02,570
But no matter what happens,
 I'm still in control.

914
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,270
Well.

915
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,140
Men, one kiss from an
 incredible woman and they

916
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,940
turned to putty.

917
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:42,860
A constant plane in
 space circling throughout time.

918
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:50,330
A never ending chase, a
 search for the supply.

919
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,280
Catch a fleeting glance.

920
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,770
Split second and it's gone.

921
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:10,750
for one chance.

922
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:15,730
Obsession for.

923
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:19,710
On and on.

924
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,200
Oh, I'm going to find it.

925
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,690
On and on.

926
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,180
Across the milky way.

927
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,680
On and on.

928
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,170
Like a thousand light years.

929
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:32,660
On and on.

930
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,640
Throughout time and space,
 time and space, time and space,

931
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,630
time and space, time and space.

932
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,110
Relief is overdue.

933
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:52,580
I think I'm gonna crash.

934
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,560
Simulation's ending.

935
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,050
A stimulation's past.

936
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,530
On and on.

937
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:08,080
Oh, I'm trying to find it.

938
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,050
On and on.

939
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,820
Across the milky way.

940
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,190
On and on.

941
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,750
Like a thousand light years.

942
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,720
On and on.

943
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,380
Throughout time and
 space, time and space,

944
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,580
time and space, time and space,
 time and space, time and space.
