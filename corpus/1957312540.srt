1
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:37,097
- I’ll call 911.

2
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:50,153
- Doctors say I’m fine.
I trimmed down.

3
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:52,242
I reduced my triglycerides,
you know.

4
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:53,591
I took a stress test
just the other day.

5
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:54,679
I’m as healthy as you are.

6
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:57,421
- It's not what
they say or I say.

7
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:59,119
It's what the insurance
company says.

8
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,602
- I've been working in central
Pennsylvania for 30 years.

9
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:05,821
I never had a season
when I didn't write

10
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:07,039
more business,

11
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,824
never lost a line.

12
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:11,174
I never missed a week
on the road until last spring.

13
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:12,741
In all that time,

14
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,612
I averaged less than
one percent uncollectible.

15
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,920
- You're not hearing me.

16
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:20,749
It's different now.
We're part of a conglomerate.

17
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,839
- I have relationships.
These go back decades.

18
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:27,625
- The insurance company
won't cover you to carry a line.

19
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,714
- I was on the road when you
first started working here.

20
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:31,194
You were doing errands.
You remember that?

21
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,153
Would you please
be a human being about this?

22
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:36,417
- You're going to get severance.

23
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,463
If you want to work,
you can get a retail gig.

24
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:42,205
- I’m a road man.
I cannot stand behind a counter.

25
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,859
- I talked to the guys
in New York.

26
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:45,861
I told you what they said.
That's all I can do.

27
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:48,777
- Fine.

28
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,127
All right. Fine.

29
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,868
I’ll go to the Cohens.

30
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:55,436
They'll give me a line.
If they don't, Fisher will.

31
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,524
I’ll take their stuff.

32
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:57,916
I’ll go sell all my old
accounts.

33
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,266
What'll the guys in New York
think about that?

34
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:06,795
- Okay, Eddie.

35
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:09,841
Okay.

36
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:10,668
You want to go back
on the road?

37
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,236
You can go back on the road.

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,716
You can break the new guy in.

39
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,805
- What?
- You go out with him

40
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:19,024
for a month, six weeks,
whatever it takes

41
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,461
to familiarize him with the line

42
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,158
and introduce him
to the accounts.

43
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,115
If it works out,

44
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,206
I may...
This is not a promise.

45
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:29,687
I may be able
to get you something.

46
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,559
- This other guy,
does he know what he's doing?

47
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,648
- Well, he's had a diamond
course.

48
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:34,649
- What about selling?
- He took the two-week

49
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:35,867
seminar in Providence.

50
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:37,739
- He's never been on the road?

51
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:39,654
- He's been on the road
in another business,

52
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:41,395
and he scored high
on the psychological profile.

53
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,614
- You gotta be kidding me.

54
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:45,399
- Forget about it, Eddie.
Max will take the guy out.

55
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:46,748
I try to do you a favor,
and you give me shit?

56
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,576
- All right,
all right, all right.

57
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:50,795
All right.
Brad, wait a second. Look. I...

58
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,848
We'll work something out.
We'll work something out.

59
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:22,914
- Sorry I’m late, man.

60
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,786
Bobby Walker.
- Eddie Miller.

61
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,091
- It's good to meet you, bro.

62
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,832
Appreciate your help
getting me started.

63
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:29,704
- My pleasure.

64
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:31,749
Some machine you got here.
- Do you like it?

65
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,578
Chicks love this car, man.

66
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:36,928
It's like a frigging
rocket ship.

67
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,016
- Yeah. Well,

68
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,324
use it for your accounts
on the moon.

69
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:44,240
- What was that?
- I said, "we'll use my car."

70
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,635
- Well, Brad said
we could use my car.

71
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:48,984
- Look, I can't sit
in that seat.

72
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:51,726
My prostate
will be up in my throat.

73
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:53,554
Get your stuff.
I’ll open the trunk.

74
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,721
- So they said you've been
doing this for a while.

75
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:37,598
- 30 years.
- Whoo. 30 years.

76
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,340
That's older than me. Wow.

77
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,038
Pretty nice car you got here.

78
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,388
Good stereo for an old car.

79
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:48,739
Who is this anyway?

80
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:54,702
- Christopher Jordan.
- Oh, so you're a jazz man, huh?

81
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,487
Jazz man. Okay.

82
00:05:57,531 --> 00:06:00,403
That's why you're so laid back,
right?

83
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,362
I get it.

84
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:07,671
I never cared too much
for jazz myself.

85
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:10,195
Seems like mostly older guys
like it, you know?

86
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,810
I’m going to play
some of my music, okay?

87
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,856
- Knock yourself out.

88
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,380
- I will do that.

89
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:56,111
Hey, what did you say?

90
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,852
- We're almost in Shippensburg.

91
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,506
- What did you say?

92
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,899
- I say we'll be in Shippensburg
in a few minutes.

93
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:04,032
- Oh, Shippensburg, huh?

94
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:08,558
Shit-ensburg.

95
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,257
Shit-ensburg.

96
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:15,609
Good old shit-ensburg.

97
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:20,440
- Let's go.

98
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,790
This is going to be a long call.
- How long?

99
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,444
- Half a day.

100
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,315
- You know, in Providence,
they said these calls go two,

101
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,230
three hours Max.
- We're not in Providence.

102
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,014
We're in Shippensburg.
And until I tell you,

103
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,973
you just...

104
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,805
- Well, look who's here.
The king of the road.

105
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,548
I never thought i'd see you
with a line again.

106
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:43,201
- You never thought
you'd see me alive again.

107
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:45,682
- Oh, no, no. I just figured
you'd move to Florida or some...

108
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,423
- Nah. The way you treated
the last guy they sent,

109
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,990
they begged me to come back.

110
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:52,776
- Hey. Hi. I’m Bobby Walker.
I’m the new guy.

111
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,692
- Is he with you?
- No. He's with me.

112
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,609
- How's business?

113
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:01,263
- Stinks. I still got stuff
from Christmas.

114
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:04,309
- I understand. Well,
I just figured we'd drop by,

115
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:07,661
grab lunch, introduce Bobby.

116
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:10,315
- Hello again.
- Hello again.

117
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,971
- You hear about that stickup
down in Baltimore?

118
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,712
- No.
- Last week,

119
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:17,845
they hit some diamond guy.

120
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:21,196
- What'd they get?
- Over a million. Shot him too.

121
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:22,327
Dead.

122
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:27,594
- So you're taking over
the territory?

123
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,160
- Yeah.

124
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:32,033
- Ever been on the road before?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

125
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,601
I traveled for kegel foods
for three years.

126
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,951
- Isn't that a pretzel company?

127
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:41,825
- Yeah. Yeah.
I managed their vending machines

128
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,218
in Dade county.

129
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:44,175
- Oh.

130
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:51,095
- All right. Well,
you don't like that one?

131
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,576
This is very special.

132
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,971
This series has been selling
like crazy.

133
00:08:57,014 --> 00:09:00,148
Our customers are telling us...
- It's not for me.

134
00:09:00,191 --> 00:09:02,324
- Mr. Ludwig, please feel
the weight on this.

135
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,674
Come on. Give me your hand.
Feel the weight on this.

136
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:07,024
This is one solid,
solid mounting. Hold that.

137
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,548
How does that feel?
- It won't go

138
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,201
in Shippensburg, son.
- We're supporting this line

139
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:11,638
with tons of advertising
material.

140
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:12,595
Let me show you something.
- I don't like it.

141
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,292
- I’m gonna make you like it.

142
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:17,905
- Bobby, Mr. Ludwig
is not in the buying mood.

143
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:20,516
- We've got...
- Stop flapping your gums, son.

144
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,735
I don't want to buy.
- Bobby,

145
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:24,868
why don't we get ourselves
a newspaper,

146
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:26,566
and let me clean up the line.
I’ll put it away.

147
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:29,307
- Sure.

148
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,178
Yeah.

149
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,224
Okay.

150
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:37,620
You're a tough sell.
Tough sell.

151
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:38,969
Thanks.

152
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,755
- There we go.

153
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:44,279
You know, John, by the way,
we got a few close-outs

154
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:45,672
in case you wanted
to take a peek, but...

155
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:46,847
- Sure.
- Yeah?

156
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,065
- Yeah.
- Mo always said

157
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:49,414
i'd have a piece
of the business,

158
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:51,416
but three weeks
after the accident,

159
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,593
his son sold it,
and that was that.

160
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:56,813
- Have you talked to Andy
or the other guys?

161
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:58,249
- Sure.

162
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,729
I've been
every office in New York.

163
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,644
I get the same story.
Nobody wants to insure me.

164
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:03,820
- So what are you
helping them for?

165
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:06,040
- Gotta have an income.
don't wanna lose the house.

166
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:09,434
- And where'd they get him from?

167
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,527
- I don't know.

168
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:16,964
Pet shop, someplace.

169
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:22,665
- That's one hell
of a sale you got here.

170
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:25,799
How did you get
that crabby old bastard

171
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,714
to buy all of this shit?
Amazing.

172
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,985
What the hell
did you do that for?

173
00:10:38,028 --> 00:10:41,031
- Just wanted to make sure
we weren't being followed?

174
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:44,295
- Do you see any cars?

175
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,211
- You might want to be wearing
that seatbelt, by the way.

176
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:02,313
- These aren't as nice
as the ones you made last year.

177
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,532
- What are you
talking about, tip?

178
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:05,882
This is all top
shelf stuff here.

179
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:09,669
Good color, nice cut.
Look at that. It's beautiful.

180
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:11,758
- Mr. Rountree.
- Oh, I’m sorry. Mr. Rountree.

181
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:16,240
- I took this stone in trade.

182
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:19,069
Can you put it
in that mounting there?

183
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:22,203
- It looks a little bit small,
but let me...

184
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:23,900
- Why don't you let me
do that?

185
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:25,510
There we go.

186
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:26,990
That's a beauty.

187
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,950
This mounting?
Good choice.

188
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:30,690
I see no problem.

189
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:36,217
Just make it a cunt hair bigger.

190
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,175
There shouldn't be a problem.

191
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:40,003
- This is Doris. My manager.

192
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:46,618
Oh. Oh, geez.

193
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:47,315
Okay.

194
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,101
- We'll get it.
No problem. No problem.

195
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,799
- I’ll find it. One second.

196
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,543
It couldn't have gone too far.

197
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:00,328
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

198
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:06,116
I got it. I got it.

199
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,642
See it, tip? Right there.

200
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,775
- Damn. We'll have to lift
the whole grating.

201
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,211
- That's all right, tip.

202
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,170
Got a screwdriver?

203
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:19,521
- Now, there wasn't
a thing I could do.

204
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,697
It was history
before I knew about it, tip.

205
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,394
- Should've been in writing.

206
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:26,789
- Well, you know, everything
used to be a handshake.

207
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,312
- Not anymore.

208
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:29,923
- Nope.

209
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,576
- You gonna be okay?

210
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,577
- Yeah. You know me.

211
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:36,277
I could sell ice
to the Alaskans.

212
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,063
- Oh, before you go.
Take a walk back to the office.

213
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,587
I want you
to see something.

214
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:44,285
- Bobby.
I’ll meet you at the car.

215
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,377
- Just take a quick peek.

216
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:00,301
I put an ad in the paper
for part-time clerical work.

217
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:03,217
A few days later,
that comes through the door.

218
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,742
And she's got next to no skills,
but I had to hire her.

219
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,353
So a couple of weeks go by,
she's helping me with the stock,

220
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:11,616
doing a little book work,
catching on.

221
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,055
I start to notice
she's giving me this look.

222
00:13:15,098 --> 00:13:17,753
Then one day,
we're alone in the back,

223
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,059
just talking
about this and that,

224
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:21,322
and she goes nuts on me.

225
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,109
- That young girl?

226
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,458
- The other night,

227
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:29,286
we almost wrecked the office.

228
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,724
- How old are you now?

229
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,905
- Hey, sorry about that little
situation back there.

230
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:41,646
We never really handled
big stones in Providence.

231
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,869
Come on.
It wasn't that bad, was it?

232
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,392
I kinda thought we were like

233
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:50,917
having a little
bonding experience.

234
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,614
- You think so?
- Yeah.

235
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:54,790
Did you see the look
on that old guy’s face

236
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,400
when I dropped that stone?

237
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:58,315
Thought he was going to have
a frigging heart attack.

238
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,882
It's classic.

239
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,841
- Watch your fingers.

240
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,193
How do I know he's
not gonna work out?

241
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:08,369
How do you know it’s shit
when you step in it?

242
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:09,936
- You're not there
to evaluate the guy.

243
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,502
You're there to train him.

244
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,896
- I hear you.
I’m just telling you.

245
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,246
And by the way,
what is the room situation?

246
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,336
- We want you, the guy,
and the line in one room.

247
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,643
You got that?
- I got it.

248
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:26,996
- You are calling the sales?

249
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,694
- Yeah.
- All right.

250
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,392
Kicking ass, huh?

251
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,926
Hey,

252
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,623
it’s pretty good.

253
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,627
It's a suite.

254
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:56,330
Yes.

255
00:14:58,332 --> 00:14:59,159
Yes!

256
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,990
That was one hell of a day.

257
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:05,208
What do you say
we go out and celebrate?

258
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,211
- I usually have
dinner at the place

259
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:09,560
right across the street.

260
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:10,257
- That place?

261
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:14,261
I don't know
if you notice, but...

262
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:16,306
That place looks
like a real drag.

263
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,093
- It's quiet.
We can bring the line in.

264
00:15:20,136 --> 00:15:21,137
- Well, the line’s
insured, right?

265
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,446
- If it’s with us or in a store.

266
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,709
- Well, nobody knows
what’s in it.

267
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:29,015
Then what does it matter
where we go.

268
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:30,930
We'll just bring it.

269
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:34,107
- There’s over a million
in goods there, dealer’s cost.

270
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,586
- It's insured.

271
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:39,547
So what?

272
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,115
- I've been doing this
for more than 30 years.

273
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:44,160
I've never been robbed.
Never had a loss.

274
00:15:44,204 --> 00:15:45,683
You know why?

275
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:48,425
- No. No idea.

276
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,212
- I stay in out
of the way motels.

277
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:54,040
I eat in quiet,
little restaurants.

278
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,650
I don't draw attention
to myself.

279
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,739
I don't talk about
what I do.

280
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:01,612
I go into a town,
I do my business, and I leave.

281
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:04,180
I recommend
that you do the same.

282
00:16:04,224 --> 00:16:05,138
- Fine.

283
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,315
We'll eat across the street.

284
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:09,664
No problem.

285
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:18,194
This place ain’t so bad.

286
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,111
- Something smells funny.

287
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:24,853
- What? This?

288
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:28,552
No, this doesn’t
smell funny. Okay.

289
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:32,426
This, my friend, is the newest,
hottest fragrance from Europe.

290
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,297
It's a babe magnet.

291
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:36,343
Wear it every time I go out.

292
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:38,519
Should get you some.

293
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:41,087
- Hi, gentlemen. Can I get you
something to drink?

294
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,044
- Hi.

295
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:44,394
What’s that? Fran?

296
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:47,615
Hi, my name is Bobby Walker,
- hi.

297
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:50,835
- And this is my associate here,
Eduardo Miller.

298
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,793
- Hi.

299
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,927
- Fran, we’ve had one
hell of a day,

300
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:58,887
and we're really thirsty.

301
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,759
What do you got on tap?
- I got Michelob and Budweiser.

302
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:04,762
- Okay. Well, bring me
a Michelob

303
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,590
and bring him something
really stiff.

304
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:07,765
- Okay.

305
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:13,336
- Did you see that ass?

306
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,952
- Thank you, gentlemen,
and have a nice evening.

307
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:23,259
- Hey, Fran?

308
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,000
What’s the bar like over there?

309
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,219
- Well, they’ve got
a drink special,

310
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,525
and there’s a game
on the big TV.

311
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,223
- Okay. The big screen.

312
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,837
You want to have a beer
and watch the game?

313
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,099
- I’m tired.

314
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:38,448
- Okay.

315
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,148
I’ll see you later.
Thanks for dinner.

316
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,245
Hi.
- Hi.

317
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:57,989
- What time do you get off?

318
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,209
- Not till later.
I have to work the bar.

319
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:03,169
- I see.

320
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:04,387
- What is that you're wearing?

321
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:05,867
- Oh, that?

322
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,175
That's this new stuff.
It's from Europe.

323
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:12,134
- I like it.
- Yeah?

324
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:14,093
- Yeah.
- Cool.

325
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,501
- Bobby?

326
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,721
- Oh, yeah, baby.
Come on. Come on.

327
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:35,418
Oh! Yes!

328
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,171
- Let's go. We're late already.

329
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,957
- Hey, sorry about last night,
man.

330
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,832
Come on. I didn't know
she was gonna be a screamer.

331
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,104
- He should be back
in an hour or so.

332
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,325
He's installing
a grandfather clock.

333
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:14,196
- Should've been here
when he opened.

334
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,764
- So?
- So now we're gonna wait.

335
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,157
- What do you wanna do?

336
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,158
- What do you mean,
"what do you wanna do"?

337
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,463
What do you do when you wait?

338
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:21,986
You buy a cup of coffee,
you read a newspaper,

339
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,424
you pick your nose, you wait.
- All right.

340
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,820
I’m sorry, okay?

341
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:31,474
All right? I’m sorry.

342
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:34,434
I’m sorry I got a slow start.

343
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:37,176
You don't turn down pussy,
man, okay? It's not natural.

344
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:42,093
It's not like I made her do it.

345
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:44,008
She wanted me, man.

346
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:46,010
She really wanted me.

347
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:49,318
I tell you...

348
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:52,147
The girls in these shitholes,

349
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,193
they got nothing better to do.

350
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,543
It's not like they're living
in Harrisburg or something.

351
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,939
- I got a lot of good customers
in these shitholes.

352
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,506
What do you think
you're gonna do?

353
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,248
Waltz in there, and somebody’s
gonna hand you an order?

354
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,816
Who’s gonna buy from you?

355
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,339
- Your customers
are gonna buy from me.

356
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:12,080
- My customers?
- Yeah, they said

357
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,864
they were gonna give them to me.
- Oh, that’s not how it works.

358
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:15,649
They can't give you
my customers.

359
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:17,607
Same way you can't give me
your girlfriends.

360
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:20,262
It doesn’t work that way.

361
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,003
I guess they didn't cover that
in Providence.

362
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,313
- Where are you going?
- Going to get a newspaper.

363
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,188
- I don't understand.
I mean, these two stones

364
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,322
are graded the same,
and that one’s more expensive.

365
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:39,107
- Well, there are slight
differences.

366
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,065
- I don't see them.

367
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:44,286
- They’re very slight,
but they’re there.

368
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,767
- I don't see the difference.

369
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,682
- So, you know,
what you're gonna be looking for

370
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:52,990
is a very small imperfection
in the table facet.

371
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:54,949
Here, you can hold this.

372
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:58,126
Now, that’s what makes
one diamond different

373
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,606
from another,
and it affects the price.

374
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:01,956
Now, they’re all made
of the same material,

375
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:05,307
but like people, they all
have different personalities,

376
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:06,961
so you got to get
to know a few of them

377
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:08,223
before you choose one.
But just remember,

378
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,051
when you find one you like,

379
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:13,446
you're gonna have to live
with it for a long time.

380
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:14,751
Take a look at these others,
if you want.

381
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,067
- Can I ask you a question?
- Ask away.

382
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,591
- How do you do that?

383
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:30,158
The customer says
he doesn’t wanna buy,

384
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:33,683
and you turn around everytime
and sell him a big bill.

385
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,685
- It's because the customers
aren't really saying, "no."

386
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,296
They’re saying, "give me
a reason to say yes."

387
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:40,211
- Right. Okay.
But how do you do that?

388
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:43,432
What is the magic word?

389
00:21:43,476 --> 00:21:45,347
- The magic word?
- I want the magic word.

390
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:46,609
Share it with me.

391
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:52,049
- You buy yourself a box
of pencils.

392
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:54,574
You get yourself a sign
that says, "I do not speak."

393
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:57,403
You go to the airport,
you keep your mouth shut,

394
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:59,622
you sell a thousand pencils,
and then we'll talk.

395
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,715
- You know, I scored really well

396
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,543
on the customer relations
training. Thank you.

397
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,415
- Well, I give my customers
about four minutes

398
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,156
before they toss you
out the door.

399
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,349
- Look, Eddie.

400
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:34,570
I know it doesn’t seem like it,

401
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,398
but I want this job.

402
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:39,183
I really do.

403
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:41,882
This is the first chance
I ever had to make real money.

404
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:52,414
I know I’ve goofed up.

405
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:56,157
I’m... it's just that I’m afraid.

406
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,203
I’m really afraid, you know.

407
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:02,598
I never worked
with diamonds before.

408
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,340
I mean, before two weeks ago,
I never even saw a diamond.

409
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,736
I’m still afraid of the things.

410
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,696
I don't even know
why they hired me

411
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,569
for this frigging job.

412
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,005
Probably because I’m
the only yo-yo who knew

413
00:23:18,048 --> 00:23:20,268
where frigging Greencastle is.

414
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:26,230
- They said you
scored big on some test.

415
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:32,889
- That question thing, I...

416
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:38,242
My friend Tina
filled that out for me.

417
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:40,157
I didn't even take it.

418
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:43,204
I don't do good
on quizzes, tests.

419
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,732
I need your help.

420
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:51,473
I’ll do whatever
you tell me to do.

421
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,388
I’ll listen, I'll learn.

422
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,346
- All right. Okay.

423
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:10,449
I don't ever want to hear
the word "old" again.

424
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,756
Not even "old records."

425
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,454
- All right.

426
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:20,807
- That tape you were
listening to before?

427
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,243
Let me see it.

428
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,296
don't listen to that
kind of music.

429
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,298
It’ll rot your brains.

430
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:38,346
All right. So you just work
with it a little bit,

431
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:42,698
and try resting the tweezers
on your finger,

432
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,657
and you get comfortable,
and the customer

433
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,268
will be comfortable,
and that stone won't jump out

434
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,966
of the tweezer, all right?
Want to try?

435
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:56,930
If you keep both eyes opened,

436
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,627
you’ll actually see better.

437
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,632
See, what you have to realize
is that we're dealing

438
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,722
in something
that isn’t quite real.

439
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,248
What is a diamond anyway?

440
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:14,077
It's just a piece of coal.

441
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,688
It's been altered by nature,

442
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,341
a wheel,

443
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:19,300
and a guy with a tool.

444
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:22,042
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:24,044
- I never saw a guy
eat like you.

446
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:26,525
They feed you at home?

447
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,442
- Oh, Eddie.

448
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:33,357
I’m never gonna remember
half the stuff you told me.

449
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,577
- Sure, you will.

450
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:37,579
All you have to know is enough
to make an impression.

451
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:41,017
After that, it’s a matter
of them getting to know you.

452
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:44,455
- Yeah. But that’s all provided
that I can last that long.

453
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:46,980
- You will.

454
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:48,634
Oh.
- What?

455
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:51,375
- What is that? It stinks.
- Oh, shit.

456
00:25:57,207 --> 00:26:00,210
Chinese food.
- Rule one of the road,

457
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:02,604
never leave Chinese food
in an enclosed vehicle.

458
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:04,780
- Got it.

459
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:11,178
- You bet. A week or two,
I’ll get the commission check,

460
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:13,746
and I’ll make both payments.

461
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:17,663
Yes. I understand.
I just need another week.

462
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:19,273
I’ll hand deliver the check,

463
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:21,710
and I’ll send the paperwork in
right away.

464
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:23,146
Thanks.

465
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:31,502
- Hey, man.

466
00:26:33,461 --> 00:26:34,854
- What’s that?

467
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:37,465
- Oh, this? This is a print-out
of all our accounts.

468
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:40,599
Come on. Test me.

469
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:44,080
Test me!

470
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:46,300
- Mechanicsburg.
- Brady's jewelers.

471
00:26:46,343 --> 00:26:49,259
Owners are Ty and Ellen Brady,
and they sell...

472
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:51,435
No, they like to buy
loose goods.

473
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,699
- Okay. How about Lewiston?

474
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,439
- Lewiston is...

475
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,095
Breiner's jewelers...

476
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:04,100
And... oh, shit.

477
00:27:04,144 --> 00:27:06,799
I know it’s the lady
with the moustache.

478
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:12,413
Is that Lewisburg?
- No, it’s lewiston. You got it.

479
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:13,457
- I don't know her name.

480
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,938
- Eileen.
- Eileen Brenner.

481
00:27:15,982 --> 00:27:19,072
- Yes.
- Yes. Eileen Brenner.

482
00:27:19,115 --> 00:27:21,291
- Well, you learned a lot
for a weekend.

483
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:23,119
- Well, you scared
the shit out of me,

484
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:26,209
and I studied very diligently.

485
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:27,384
- You weren't out there
chasing, huh?

486
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:29,038
- No. I was out there
chasing too,

487
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:30,736
and I brought my notes with me.

488
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,130
- What are you doing there?

489
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:37,133
- Huh? This thing, man,
on my frigging finger,

490
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:40,223
it’s like a lump,

491
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,660
and I’ve ripped it off,
and it keeps coming back.

492
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,665
Where are you going?
- We'll take a little detour.

493
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:49,363
I’ll get you a band-aid,
and I need some paperwork

494
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:50,277
for the bank.

495
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,241
Got a ton of band-aids.

496
00:27:58,285 --> 00:28:01,288
My wife bought them
every time they were on sale.

497
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,554
- Nice place.

498
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:10,993
- Yeah, I guess I haven’t
been keeping it up very much.

499
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:12,516
What you're doing is going
to make it bleed more, you know.

500
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,040
- It's not gonna make it bleed.

501
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,216
This thing could be cancer
of the finger. I might die.

502
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,045
- Let me see. No.
- Look at that.

503
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:20,960
You hear about it all the time.
Some guy gets a growth.

504
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:22,875
Next thing you know, he's dead.

505
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:25,007
- It's a wart.

506
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:26,487
- How do you know it’s a...
Have you ever seen a wart

507
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,358
that looked like that?
It's ugly.

508
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:29,969
- I know about cancer.
My wife had it.

509
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:31,840
That's a wart.

510
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:33,189
- She all right?

511
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,803
- No. It killed her last may.

512
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:41,371
She was sick for quite a while.

513
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:43,939
She needed a lot
of special care,

514
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:46,159
and she didn't want to go
into a facility, because...

515
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:48,465
Well, you know...
And I don't blame her.

516
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:52,469
And that kinda wiped us out.

517
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:55,385
But the kids were out of school,
and they were off,

518
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:56,909
so what difference
does it make?

519
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,912
- How long were you guys
married?

520
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,783
- Long time.

521
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:02,784
Since I was about your age.

522
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:05,134
- Ooh,

523
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:06,527
that is a stretch.

524
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:09,791
- Have you ever lived
with a woman?

525
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:11,706
- No.

526
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,839
I don't plan on it either.

527
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:17,103
I've had 'em over
for a weekend or two.

528
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:20,106
It's like having
your mother around.

529
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:23,413
I grew up in this tiny,
little apartment.

530
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:26,939
My parents, they were always,
always on each other's ass.

531
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,679
You know, it’s...

532
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:34,076
I don't want that. You know,
I want something better.

533
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,774
- Did they ever get along?

534
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,693
- If they did, I don't remember.

535
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,304
What about you?

536
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:45,914
You got the kids.
Where are they?

537
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,830
What are they doing?

538
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,527
- I got two daughters.

539
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:53,922
One lives in London.
The other one, San Diego.

540
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,010
- They...

541
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:58,579
- Married.
- Okay.

542
00:29:58,622 --> 00:29:59,493
Just asking. Just...

543
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,416
I don't know if you notice,
but those guys across the street

544
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:10,939
are staring at us.
- Yeah, I see them.

545
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:12,811
don't look at them.
- All right.

546
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,725
- We're going to make a left
down this alley.

547
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:16,640
- What about the car?
- Just do what I ask you.

548
00:30:16,684 --> 00:30:17,946
- All right.

549
00:30:22,646 --> 00:30:24,518
- Walk ahead of me.
Keep your eyes straight.

550
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:26,694
Get to the next corner.
Go right to the store.

551
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:28,391
Understand?
- Yup.

552
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,221
What are we going to do
when we get to the store?

553
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:47,671
Eddie.

554
00:30:49,108 --> 00:30:51,153
Eddie.

555
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:52,894
- don't shoot me!
- I’m sorry.

556
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:54,113
- What are you doing
with a gun?

557
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:55,462
- I’m just trying
to protect myself.

558
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:58,247
- From what?
I got the goods. You got shit.

559
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,206
- I’m sorry.
- Those were two local bums.

560
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:02,164
If they had been pros, you
wouldn’t have seen them coming.

561
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,123
They’d have had the goods
and off in a flash.

562
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:07,256
- Eddie, I’ve carried a gun
as long as I’ve been travelling.

563
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,736
That's what the guy
in Baltimore did.

564
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,912
He had a gun. That's how he got
his head shot off.

565
00:31:12,566 --> 00:31:15,830
- All right. Fine.
No more guns, okay?

566
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,136
- Good idea.

567
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:25,187
- Why don't you let me
make it up to you, all right?

568
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,580
I’ll buy you a drink
or something.

569
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:27,581
- Nah.
- Come on.

570
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:28,887
I know this great spot.

571
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,062
There’s going to be
a lot of chicks there.

572
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:31,150
We'll have a good time.

573
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:35,632
So what do you guys do?

574
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,243
- Oh, we both work
the day shift at Sperry.

575
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:38,374
- Really? I know Sperry’s.

576
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:39,941
I used to stock
their vending machines.

577
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:42,117
The ones in the lunch room?
- Yeah, kegel snacks, right?

578
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:43,553
- Yeah.
- That was me!

579
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:45,773
I was the kegel man.
I had the hat, and the...

580
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:47,470
That was me.
I was the kegel man.

581
00:31:47,514 --> 00:31:49,124
Listen, let me introduce you
to someone.

582
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:51,126
This is my good friend Eddie.

583
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,998
Eddie’s my mentor, right?
Yeah.

584
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,825
Yes.

585
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,392
That means he's showing me
my new job.

586
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:57,959
- And what’s that?

587
00:31:58,003 --> 00:31:59,526
- We're in the diamond...
- Computers.

588
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:01,006
- Right.

589
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:02,137
- Parts.
- Computer parts

590
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:03,747
and auto supplies
business, exactly.

591
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,925
And we're just in town visiting
one of the customer,

592
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,840
and we just wanted to hang out.
- I’m gonna go to the bathroom.

593
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:11,842
- Have fun.

594
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:13,148
- I’m tired.

595
00:32:13,192 --> 00:32:15,150
- Eddie, don't go.
- No, no, no.

596
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,412
Have a good time.
- These girls are...

597
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:19,285
- Yeah. I’ll be all right.

598
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:22,505
- I’ll see you later, okay?

599
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,290
So what are you guys doing?
- What are you doing?

600
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,726
- I wanna party.
- Okay.

601
00:32:31,427 --> 00:32:33,821
- Hey.

602
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,518
don't mind me, Eddie.

603
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,573
Oh, shit.

604
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:50,925
I’ll just be a second.
One second.

605
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:57,018
Oh, man.

606
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:58,367
Fuck!

607
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,892
Dude,

608
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:03,851
do you have any rubbers?

609
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:05,505
- No.

610
00:33:07,594 --> 00:33:08,682
- Okay.

611
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:09,944
Shit.

612
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:12,555
See ya.

613
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,530
- What happened?
- When I got back,

614
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:32,227
they were gone.

615
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,057
That's what happens
when you're not prepared.

616
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:39,626
- Should've tried
the men's room.

617
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:45,414
- And you should've hung around.

618
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,416
That place was crawling
with babes, man.

619
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,463
- Wasn’t my kind of crowd.

620
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:56,382
- Were you really on the road
for 30 years?

621
00:33:57,731 --> 00:33:58,775
- Yup.

622
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,302
- You never thought
about doing nothing different?

623
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:08,307
- Well,
I thought about it, but

624
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,004
I could never think of what.

625
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,962
I had a family.

626
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:18,186
- And you never carry
rubbers around?

627
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:21,189
- No.

628
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:24,279
- Not even
for special occasions?

629
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:28,327
- Like what? My birthday?

630
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:33,114
No.

631
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,384
Re-raise. That's it.
I call.

632
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:44,125
What is it?

633
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:46,127
- Jack solo.

634
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:49,130
- Full boat.

635
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:52,220
- Three fives will do then.

636
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:56,790
- Thank you very much,
gentlemen.

637
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,270
- You’ve been pretty
feisty lately.

638
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:01,708
- Ever since he started
messing around with jailbait.

639
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:04,276
- Her name is Marcy.
She’s 26 years old

640
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:06,669
and quite mature for her age.

641
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,064
- Well, somebody said
they saw you picking her up

642
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,848
at the high school.

643
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:15,287
- What do you know?
You're old, married men.

644
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,594
- Tip, someday, that girl
is gonna make you a fine nurse.

645
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:22,120
- You change her diapers now,
she’ll change yours later.

646
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,514
- Let me tell you something.

647
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:26,776
When she first
started working for me,

648
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,778
I had her come in twice a week.

649
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:32,130
Now, I’m thinking
of putting her on full time.

650
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:34,958
- That's gotta be
pretty expensive.

651
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,265
What does she charge?
About a hundred an hour?

652
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,875
- Hey, he's too cheap for that.

653
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,877
Anyway, how much
do you use her for?

654
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:41,661
Five minutes a week?

655
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,098
- I’m just gonna say one thing.

656
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,492
Last year, the urologist
pokes around,

657
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:48,755
and tells me I’m not
getting enough sex.

658
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:51,845
A few days ago, he tells me
I’m getting too much.

659
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:53,586
How about that?

660
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,850
- Sounds like science fiction.

661
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,548
I better take a leak.

662
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,289
- Hey, sport. Where’s the beer?

663
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,422
- In the fridge out back.
Help yourself.

664
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,209
Hey, Eddie.

665
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,169
Listen to me.

666
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,736
Get yourself a young girl.
It’ll change your life.

667
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,306
- Funny you should
mention that, tip.

668
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,048
After the heart attack,
I went to this recovery group.

669
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,790
First question that got asked
was, "can I still have sex?"

670
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:26,009
Doctor said, "you can have
all the sex you want

671
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,229
with your wife."
Everybody laughed, of course,

672
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:31,189
but it left me with a question.

673
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,581
How much sex a guy can take?

674
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,498
- That's the last thing
i'd worry about.

675
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:40,372
You go out like that,
shit, you're lucky.

676
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:45,290
- Guess so.

677
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:52,427
- Come here, you.

678
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:59,260
- Hey, Fran?
- Mm-hmm?

679
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:02,002
- Do you have
any unattached girlfriends?

680
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:03,482
- Of course, I do.
- Yeah?

681
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:05,353
- Yeah.

682
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:08,617
I mean someone
really, really open-minded.

683
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:13,143
- Do you want to get it on
with me and another chick?

684
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:16,146
- Oh, yes. That would be great.

685
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,454
But that’s not
what I’m talking about.

686
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,413
Do you remember that guy
I came in with?

687
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:23,893
- Yeah, the older guy.
Yeah.

688
00:37:23,937 --> 00:37:27,332
- I want to set him up.

689
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,813
- He's a fucking dinosaur.

690
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:33,468
- That's not funny, Fran.

691
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:34,904
- None of my friends
would go out with him.

692
00:37:34,948 --> 00:37:36,341
- Why?

693
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,169
- Because he's too old.

694
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:41,824
- He's not really old.

695
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:44,087
I’m serious. He's, like, hip.

696
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,786
- Yeah. Oh, I’m sure.

697
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:49,005
But what if they were,
like, making it in the sack,

698
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,181
and he croaked.

699
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:52,792
It would be my fault.

700
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:53,923
I would feel terrible.

701
00:38:01,757 --> 00:38:03,629
Where are you going?

702
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:06,762
- don't you got to get your kids
or something?

703
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:09,069
- Nah. Not till 12.

704
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:13,378
I thought maybe we'd hang out
for a while.

705
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:17,425
- Yeah, but I got a long day
tomorrow.

706
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:22,125
I got a long ride tonight,
so I’m gonna go.

707
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:25,172
I’ll let myself out.
Talk to you later.

708
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,180
Can we stop and get a coffee?

709
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:36,966
- Should've gotten coffee
before we left.

710
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,664
- I know. I was late.
But there’s a place,

711
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:40,013
right up here, i'd like
to just run in real quick,

712
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:42,537
if you don't mind.

713
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:43,799
Thank you.

714
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:53,809
- I don't want
to go out with him.

715
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,333
He's too old for me.

716
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:58,901
- don't say "old," okay?
He's sensitive about that.

717
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,601
Come on, Sharon.

718
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:05,473
You're always complaining
about guys being jerks,

719
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,954
guys with attitudes,
guys who are broke.

720
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:10,739
Come on. He was married
for a million years,

721
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:13,394
and his wife died.

722
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,483
He's got a great job.
He's got a car.

723
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,617
He lives in a house.

724
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:22,577
Oh, Sharon. Come on.

725
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:24,144
I’m not asking you
to sleep with him.

726
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:26,973
He just needs a companion.

727
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:29,149
- Get him a dog.

728
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,500
Listen,

729
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:35,242
I’ve got customers,
okay? Bye.

730
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:42,467
- Are we seeing anyone tonight?

731
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:46,035
- No.

732
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,123
- I got some friends.

733
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:51,650
They live just outside
of Altoona.

734
00:39:51,693 --> 00:39:52,868
I was thinking
about dropping in on them.

735
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,872
- Women?

736
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:59,614
- Yeah, women.

737
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:02,530
But I think you’ll
like these women.

738
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,619
- You were just gonna
drop in on ’em.

739
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:07,796
- No, I wasn't just gonna
drop in on 'em.

740
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,536
I called them.

741
00:40:09,885 --> 00:40:11,147
Told them I was in the area.

742
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:14,455
Told them I had a friend.

743
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:17,153
They said if we have time
to "please, come by."

744
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:22,594
So what do you think?

745
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,467
- I don't know.

746
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,295
- Come on.
Your shoes are shined.

747
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:29,165
You're looking pretty dapper.

748
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:33,909
Let's do it.

749
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:37,565
All right!

750
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,611
Yes!

751
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:41,526
Come on.

752
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,491
- And who lives
all the way out here?

753
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:53,189
- My friends. Will you relax?

754
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:11,773
don't mind the exterior.
They’re fixing up the place.

755
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:27,572
- Who is it?

756
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:29,965
- It's Bobby.

757
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:32,402
- Hold on.
- Okay.

758
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:33,360
- Who lives here?

759
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:37,407
- Hi, sweetie.

760
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:40,628
- Hey.
- How you doing?

761
00:41:40,672 --> 00:41:42,369
- I’m good.
I've been working so hard.

762
00:41:42,412 --> 00:41:44,110
- Oh, that’s no fun.

763
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:46,112
- Well, it’s not so bad.
This is my friend Eddie

764
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:48,897
that I told you about.
- Hi. Tina.

765
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:50,899
Come on in.

766
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,296
Your friend’s good looking.
- Thank you.

767
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,385
- Can I get you
something to drink?

768
00:41:58,428 --> 00:42:00,996
- No, I think we're all right.

769
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,825
- I’ll take a beer. Thanks.

770
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,786
- I have a couple of new girls
starting tonight.

771
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,527
I think you’ll like 'em.

772
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,790
Great.

773
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,356
- Okay.

774
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:18,318
- Eddie.
Eddie!

775
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:21,713
Eddie, what’s the matter.

776
00:42:21,756 --> 00:42:23,149
- You didn't tell me
your friend was a hooker.

777
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:24,933
- She’s not a hooker.

778
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:26,369
They give massages in there.

779
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:28,720
- Are you kidding?

780
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:31,200
- All right. Some of the girls
perform extra services for tips,

781
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:34,639
but they do that on their own.

782
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:35,814
All right.
Eddie, listen,

783
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:38,860
listen, listen, listen.

784
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:41,036
Look, a few years ago,
Tina’s old man ran out on her

785
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,125
and her kid.
Left her with nothing.

786
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:44,866
I loaned her a few bucks
to get back on her feet

787
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,086
and start her business.
This is the place.

788
00:42:47,129 --> 00:42:49,697
- Was that before or after
you had sex with her?

789
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:51,612
- It was before.
What does that matter?

790
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,527
- It matters a lot.
- No, it does not matter.

791
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,835
Look, I didn't give her money,
so she’d have sex with me.

792
00:42:56,878 --> 00:43:00,055
She needed it. She’s my friend.

793
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:02,231
All right?
And she never forgot about it.

794
00:43:02,275 --> 00:43:05,974
She looks out for me now.
She’ll look out for you too.

795
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:07,585
- Is this the Tina that took
the test for you?

796
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:11,501
- Yes, she's a very smart girl.

797
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:14,243
- You got the keys.
- Great.

798
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:15,941
You wanna go back
to that shit motel and watch TV,

799
00:43:15,984 --> 00:43:16,985
go ahead.

800
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:23,035
All right. Wait, wait.
don't go. Don't go.

801
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:26,081
Come on, it’s lonely back there.

802
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,214
What’s with your head, Eddie?

803
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:30,608
You’d rather watch TV
in a shitty motel than hang out

804
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:33,088
with some hot chicks?

805
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:36,744
- I didn't come here to screw
some young, hot chicks.

806
00:43:36,788 --> 00:43:38,050
- You know...
- Look, I’m not saying

807
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:40,182
you have to screw anyone.

808
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:42,707
No one’s gonna make you
do anything you don't want to.

809
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,361
We're just gonna hang out
for 30 minutes, 40 minutes.

810
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:48,321
We'll unwind and relax.

811
00:43:48,364 --> 00:43:50,802
Come on. Tina’s my friend.
I want to visit with her.

812
00:43:50,845 --> 00:43:52,804
You can trust her.

813
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:54,588
You can trust her.

814
00:43:59,898 --> 00:44:02,552
Come on. Come on.

815
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:05,817
Come on.

816
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:17,655
- I thought I lost you there.

817
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:20,919
- Eddie thought he locked
the keys in the car.

818
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:22,660
- No problem.

819
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,836
Look, Eddie.
Eddie, right?

820
00:44:24,879 --> 00:44:26,446
I’m gonna take you upstairs,

821
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:28,100
show you to a nice room.

822
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:38,850
This your first time
in Altoona?

823
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,852
- No.

824
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:43,289
I've been coming through Altoona
for a long time now.

825
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:45,552
- Gee, that’s funny.

826
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:47,380
I've never seen you before.

827
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:52,037
Right this way.

828
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,082
And don't you worry.

829
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:56,302
The masseuses here
are very nice.

830
00:44:56,345 --> 00:44:57,825
College girls.

831
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:22,241
- Hi.

832
00:45:22,284 --> 00:45:24,547
I’m Amber.

833
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:27,028
- Eddie.

834
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:28,726
- Would you like a massage?

835
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:32,555
- Okay.

836
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:36,255
Make yourself comfortable,
and I’ll be right back.

837
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:55,230
You gotta take off
more than that, honey.

838
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,555
And your shorts.

839
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:25,652
How do you like it?
Hard? Soft?

840
00:46:27,872 --> 00:46:29,351
- I don't know.
It doesn’t matter.

841
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:35,140
- You're all tensed up.

842
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:41,755
You got to release all that.

843
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:52,331
Move your legs.

844
00:46:57,771 --> 00:46:58,990
Move them apart.

845
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:18,966
Okay.

846
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,228
You can turn over now.

847
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:22,013
I’ll do your front.

848
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:34,721
Looks like we're gonna
get along real good.

849
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:44,470
You need to relax more.

850
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:49,954
Just lay back.

851
00:47:49,997 --> 00:47:58,788
And don't worry.
I’ll fix this.

852
00:47:58,832 --> 00:48:00,921
- Oh, no.

853
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:05,404
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Oh, no. No. I can't do this.

854
00:48:05,447 --> 00:48:07,797
I’m awful sorry.

855
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:09,190
- No sweat.

856
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:13,847
I’ll see you later.

857
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:25,903
- Eddie. How'd it go, man?
What’s up?

858
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:28,122
- Listening to the radio.
- Yeah?

859
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,951
Did you have a good time?

860
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,910
- Yeah.

861
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:34,781
- Good.

862
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:41,919
- So did you like the girl?

863
00:48:44,486 --> 00:48:45,966
Good.

864
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:48,708
I was hoping
to get a good look at her.

865
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:51,929
She’s probably hot, huh?

866
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:53,843
She was hot, yeah?

867
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,152
You know, Eddie,
if she gave you a hard time,

868
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:00,198
you gotta tell me.
- No.

869
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:02,026
- No, you gotta tell me,
because if she did,

870
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:03,505
I’ll call Tina and bounce her
out of there.

871
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:07,945
- She was fine.
She was really fine, honestly.

872
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:11,078
- What?

873
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:13,515
- She had an eye
in the middle of her chest.

874
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:14,212
- What?

875
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:18,390
She had this tattoo
in the middle of her chest.

876
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:21,088
It was a flaming eyeball.
I...

877
00:49:21,132 --> 00:49:23,308
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

878
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:25,788
- She had an eyeball
in between her boobs?

879
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:28,226
- I’m afraid so.
I couldn't stop looking at it.

880
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:30,141
I turned away.
I didn't want to...

881
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:32,360
I didn't want to stare.

882
00:49:32,404 --> 00:49:35,320
It was awful.

883
00:49:35,363 --> 00:49:37,670
- You gotta turn around, man.

884
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:39,672
I wanna go see it!
- Nah, you don't want

885
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:41,326
to see her...
- Turn the car around!

886
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:42,936
- No, don't embarrass me.
Listen, I couldn't...

887
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,068
I could hardly not look.

888
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:45,547
I just didn't wanna look.

889
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:47,071
I didn't wanna stare
but, you know,

890
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:49,987
it was right in the middle of...
I couldn't stand it.

891
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,379
I was dying in there.

892
00:49:51,423 --> 00:49:53,599
I don't know. I don't know.

893
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:55,862
I was just so embarrassed,
I had to run.

894
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:08,570
The Altoona riding club, eh?
- Yup.

895
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:10,442
I used to take them cards,
and i'd pass them out

896
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:13,619
on all my routes
to, like, all the guys.

897
00:50:13,662 --> 00:50:15,099
And whenever i'd come back
to the towns,

898
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:17,623
the girls would be... you know,
repay the favor.

899
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:21,714
- You do this all the time?

900
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:24,108
- Nope.

901
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:25,892
Only when I get
stressed out.

902
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:28,590
Takes the edge off.

903
00:50:30,723 --> 00:50:33,508
- Yeah, well, you know,
I was with the same woman

904
00:50:33,552 --> 00:50:35,815
for so long, after all
those years, you don't just...

905
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:39,471
I don't know. Probably
has something to do with age.

906
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:42,952
- Are you saying that you

907
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:44,128
lose the urge?

908
00:50:46,304 --> 00:50:47,914
I mean, is that what happens
when you get...

909
00:50:47,957 --> 00:50:49,350
- don't say it.

910
00:50:50,743 --> 00:50:52,310
- Sorry.

911
00:50:52,353 --> 00:50:53,920
Sorry.

912
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:57,358
- No. You don't lose the urge.

913
00:50:57,402 --> 00:51:00,840
You still... you know...
You still want sex, but

914
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:04,800
you want affection.

915
00:51:08,761 --> 00:51:11,503
I don't know.
It's a little hard to describe.

916
00:51:11,546 --> 00:51:13,722
- Yeah.

917
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:16,073
I bet it is.

918
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,818
Hey, I’m sorry our little
expedition didn't work out.

919
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:24,298
- don't worry about it.

920
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:26,561
- I got something for you
to study this weekend, okay?

921
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:29,564
- Yeah?
- Guys who have regular sex

922
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:32,524
live an average of ten years
longer than those who don't.

923
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:34,830
I’m serious.
You think about that.

924
00:51:34,874 --> 00:51:35,875
- Later, pal.

925
00:51:35,918 --> 00:51:38,051
- All right.
Have a good weekend.

926
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,792
But I feel so bad for him,
you know?

927
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:42,708
He's all tensed up
and grouchy all the time.

928
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:43,926
I mean, he's gotta get laid.

929
00:51:45,406 --> 00:51:47,016
It's just... I gotta find someone

930
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,976
who can make it
romantic for him.

931
00:51:50,019 --> 00:51:52,152
- Well, I don't know if
anybody here is gonna be up

932
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:54,937
for all that, but I’ll ask.

933
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:56,374
- All right.

934
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:58,071
Oh, Tina.

935
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,160
Can you set me up with
the one with the eyeball?

936
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:04,817
- She worked here for two
nights, then she disappeared.

937
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,036
Sorry.

938
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,343
- Do you have her phone number?

939
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:13,782
- So looks like the kid’s
gonna work out after all.

940
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:15,697
- Well, he's learning.

941
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:16,742
- Yeah, I called around
to a few of the accounts.

942
00:52:16,785 --> 00:52:17,699
They like him.

943
00:52:19,048 --> 00:52:21,573
- Brad, look, we gotta talk.

944
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:23,575
He's gonna be out
on his own here before long,

945
00:52:23,618 --> 00:52:27,318
and I gotta know.
I got a mortgage.

946
00:52:27,361 --> 00:52:28,319
- Eddie, we haven’t decided
yet,

947
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:30,190
but we'll talk about it, okay?

948
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:31,626
- Brad, I need more than that.

949
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,802
- don't bust my balls, Eddie.

950
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:35,326
We'll do something, okay?

951
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:36,501
Now, I have to go.

952
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:37,197
Bye.

953
00:52:40,374 --> 00:52:41,984
- What about Eddie Miller?

954
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:43,203
- He's gone.

955
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:44,813
Corporate wants a whole
new team.

956
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:47,816
- Look, he's a good man,
and I sorta promised that...

957
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,948
- He's too good.

958
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:51,472
He gets ten percent
plus overage.

959
00:52:51,516 --> 00:52:54,258
We're not giving that anymore.

960
00:52:54,301 --> 00:52:55,781
- I mean, I know you like
the 60s,

961
00:52:55,824 --> 00:52:58,784
but you could probably also use
some three-grainers too.

962
00:52:58,827 --> 00:53:01,917
- Yeah, but I don't want
to pay for both.

963
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:04,442
- Okay, so here’s what we'll
do... we'll divide the parcel,

964
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:07,227
and we'll give you an extra
30 days to pay for it.

965
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:11,536
- Guy’s quite the diamond maven.

966
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,146
- Well, you know, he spent time
in the cutting house.

967
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,279
He knows diamonds.

968
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:16,845
- So you been around this
business a while, huh?

969
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:19,196
- Yeah.

970
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,807
- You made a good impression,

971
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,939
and you began your relationship.

972
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:26,768
- Right, but the only thing...
I never ever worked in the

973
00:53:26,812 --> 00:53:28,335
cutting house, you know that.
- Oh, doesn’t matter.

974
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:29,293
And you know, it’s harmless.

975
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:30,685
He just needs to think that

976
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:32,687
you know something
that he doesn’t know.

977
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:34,080
- All right.

978
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:35,386
You live by your wits
in this game,

979
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:39,041
and you’ll learn how.

980
00:53:39,085 --> 00:53:41,261
- Hey, baby. I got your message.
What’s up?

981
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:43,307
I found somebody
for your friend.

982
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:46,223
I appreciate it,
but after the last time,

983
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:48,790
he's not interested anymore.

984
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:50,618
- This'll make up
for all of that.

985
00:53:50,662 --> 00:53:52,098
- I can't get him to come back
there with me.

986
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:53,926
Even if I could, he is...

987
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:55,188
He doesn’t want to hang out
with those type of girls.

988
00:53:56,494 --> 00:53:57,538
- Just bring him.

989
00:53:57,582 --> 00:53:58,844
I got the girl.

990
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:01,977
- Come on. We're not gonna get
in till late.

991
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:04,893
We pass right by Altoona.

992
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:10,334
Eddie, I’m telling you,
she said this is the one.

993
00:54:10,377 --> 00:54:11,596
No flaming eyeball.

994
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:13,075
No nothing.

995
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,773
She has the girl for you.

996
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:18,037
Come on. It's a half hour
out of the way.

997
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,344
What’s the big deal?

998
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:22,824
- What would we do
with the line?

999
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:24,739
Tip’s is the closest store.
He's closed.

1000
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:46,413
- There. Satisfied?

1001
00:54:46,457 --> 00:54:48,197
We're not being followed.

1002
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:51,157
Okay?

1003
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:54,987
What is waiting for you
back in Harrisburg?

1004
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:56,031
- All right, all right.

1005
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:58,469
Listen,

1006
00:54:58,512 --> 00:55:00,079
I put this thing in my mind,

1007
00:55:00,122 --> 00:55:03,735
and I... I don't know.

1008
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:04,910
- Well, good.

1009
00:55:04,953 --> 00:55:06,346
You can't ignore it.

1010
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:07,652
The thing'll stress you out

1011
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:09,262
worse than any heart
condition will.

1012
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,704
- Where'd you hear about that?

1013
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:18,750
- The guys at the office
told me about it.

1014
00:55:25,931 --> 00:55:26,671
Look, Eddie.

1015
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,456
I knew you wouldn’t retire.

1016
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,458
I see how much
you love this job.

1017
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:33,112
So I asked 'em.

1018
00:55:33,155 --> 00:55:36,724
They told me.

1019
00:55:36,768 --> 00:55:38,944
Eddie,

1020
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:43,383
look, I’m really sorry about
what they’re doing to you.

1021
00:55:43,427 --> 00:55:46,865
I wish there was something
I could do about it,

1022
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,301
but I can't.

1023
00:56:01,749 --> 00:56:05,623
Tina says she's got someone
really great for you.

1024
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:07,755
Least we can do
is go find out.

1025
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:20,725
- Good thing you called ahead.

1026
00:56:20,768 --> 00:56:22,335
- Come with me.

1027
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,684
don't leave, okay?

1028
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:30,038
All right, are you sure
this is the right one?

1029
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:33,128
- Yes. I mean, she's not
usually what people request,

1030
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:34,913
but she's perfect
for your friend.

1031
00:56:34,956 --> 00:56:36,044
No eyeballs,

1032
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:37,481
no road maps on her ass,

1033
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:38,699
nothing crazy, right?

1034
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:39,874
- No. Trust me.

1035
00:56:39,918 --> 00:56:41,310
I got this down.

1036
00:56:41,354 --> 00:56:44,401
I even fixed up the room.

1037
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:45,619
- Okay.

1038
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:47,534
All right.

1039
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:50,972
- I got something for you too.

1040
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:54,976
- It's all set.

1041
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,543
- This is a mistake.

1042
00:56:56,587 --> 00:56:59,024
I can feel it.
- No, no. Not tonight.

1043
00:57:07,554 --> 00:57:09,513
- I’m Katie.

1044
00:57:09,556 --> 00:57:10,949
- I’m Eddie.

1045
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,431
- Is it Edward?

1046
00:57:14,474 --> 00:57:15,736
- Yes.

1047
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,783
- Well, it’s very nice
to meet you, Edward.

1048
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:27,879
I understand you've been
travelling, huh?

1049
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:30,403
- Yes, we have.

1050
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,101
- And you're tired,
and you're achy,

1051
00:57:33,145 --> 00:57:35,321
and you need to relax.

1052
00:57:37,149 --> 00:57:38,193
- I guess.

1053
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:41,458
Well, why don't you lay down,

1054
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:44,504
and let me give you a backrub?

1055
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:49,030
- You want me to undress?

1056
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:54,558
- Let's start with your tie
and your shirt.

1057
00:58:09,877 --> 00:58:12,184
- Hi.
- Hi.

1058
00:58:14,012 --> 00:58:15,317
- I’m cherry.

1059
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:18,451
- You're new.

1060
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,147
- Mm-hmm.

1061
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:23,412
Looks like you like me.

1062
00:58:27,155 --> 00:58:29,549
- Think you're right.

1063
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:31,638
- What do you want
to do about that?

1064
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:50,483
- So tell me, Edward,
are you married?

1065
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:56,750
- My wife died.

1066
00:58:56,794 --> 00:58:57,751
Last year.

1067
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:02,060
- I’m sorry.
That must've been terrible.

1068
00:59:05,106 --> 00:59:08,588
- It was actually. She was...

1069
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:11,243
We were very close.

1070
00:59:11,286 --> 00:59:12,984
- Breathe in.

1071
00:59:18,946 --> 00:59:21,732
The Buddhists say

1072
00:59:21,775 --> 00:59:24,778
that if you can just live
in the moment,

1073
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:28,260
you can see all
your troubles through.

1074
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,871
- That's interesting.

1075
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:38,052
I was a secretary for five-
years, and about a month ago,

1076
00:59:38,096 --> 00:59:42,143
they let us know that
the company was being sold.

1077
00:59:42,187 --> 00:59:45,320
The very next Friday, the entire
office was let go.

1078
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:49,150
- That must've been shock.

1079
00:59:49,194 --> 00:59:50,630
- Yeah, at first,

1080
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:53,633
but I’m really trying to just

1081
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:57,637
let the flow of life carry me,
you know?

1082
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,204
Not to resist.

1083
01:00:01,728 --> 01:00:02,424
Relax.

1084
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:11,216
- I know I got more right here.

1085
01:00:11,259 --> 01:00:13,653
I can get more from the ATM
machine, if you want to

1086
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,220
- no, that’s okay.
- You sure?

1087
01:00:15,263 --> 01:00:16,308
- Yeah, this time. That's fine.

1088
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:24,142
- You're really hot.

1089
01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:35,544
Oh, man.

1090
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:36,850
I love you.

1091
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,204
- See, we all have this

1092
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:46,207
voice inside us that’s, like,

1093
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:48,949
an inner advisor,

1094
01:00:48,993 --> 01:00:50,690
and if you can just
stay focused on it,

1095
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:53,650
it’ll keep you in touch
with your inner truth.

1096
01:00:56,043 --> 01:00:57,566
- You know a lot
about this stuff.

1097
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:59,307
Did you study it?
- No.

1098
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:03,877
I've taken yoga for 15 years.

1099
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:05,270
- Feels great.

1100
01:01:06,532 --> 01:01:08,752
- You have excellent
muscle tone, Edward.

1101
01:01:08,795 --> 01:01:10,797
You must take care of yourself,
huh?

1102
01:01:10,841 --> 01:01:13,147
- I had a heart attack actually,

1103
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:15,802
but I’m much better now.

1104
01:01:15,846 --> 01:01:16,847
- Okay.

1105
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,022
Turn over.

1106
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:31,035
Now,

1107
01:01:31,078 --> 01:01:34,212
I need you to understand
something.

1108
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:36,867
I’m here to pamper you,

1109
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:40,044
but I don't do
what some of these

1110
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:42,089
other girls here do.

1111
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:43,700
- No.

1112
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:45,963
- Are you all right with that?

1113
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:48,922
- Yes.

1114
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:50,881
- You know,

1115
01:01:50,924 --> 01:01:53,840
when I did this in a doctor’s
office, I never had to explain,

1116
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:55,886
but here...

1117
01:01:56,974 --> 01:01:58,889
- I understand.

1118
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:02,588
- Well, that’s good,

1119
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:05,939
because now I can
really relax too.

1120
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:08,289
- Me too.

1121
01:02:09,551 --> 01:02:10,683
- Oh, I love you.

1122
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,032
I do, cherry.

1123
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:13,033
Cherry,

1124
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:16,776
oh!

1125
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,908
Oh, shit.

1126
01:02:17,951 --> 01:02:19,736
Oh, fuck.

1127
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:20,432
I’m sorry.

1128
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,565
I’m sorry.

1129
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:25,916
I blew my load so fast.

1130
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:26,960
I don't usually do that.

1131
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:31,138
- don't worry, baby.
You were the best.

1132
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:34,054
- Can I do it again, like, in a
couple minutes?

1133
01:02:34,098 --> 01:02:37,188
- You know, i'd really like
that, but... um...

1134
01:02:38,276 --> 01:02:40,191
My girlfriend’s car broke down,

1135
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:42,454
and I promised
i'd pick her up from work,

1136
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:44,717
so I can't.

1137
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,588
- I can get hard really quick.

1138
01:02:46,632 --> 01:02:48,808
- I know. I’m sure you can.
I gotta go.

1139
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:51,245
I gotta go
make a phone call, okay?

1140
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:52,899
But next time,

1141
01:02:52,943 --> 01:02:57,425
why don't you reserve
the jacuzzi, okay?

1142
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:03,780
- I can't believe
how relaxed I feel.

1143
01:03:03,823 --> 01:03:06,304
- You had a lot of tension
in your chakra points.

1144
01:03:08,654 --> 01:03:11,657
- I read about those
in one of my health magazines...

1145
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,833
The shocker points.

1146
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:15,443
- Chakra.

1147
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:20,971
- Well, whatever they are,

1148
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:22,799
I can't believe
it makes such a difference.

1149
01:03:27,064 --> 01:03:29,240
- So you're sure you're
not disappointed?

1150
01:03:31,764 --> 01:03:33,853
- No.

1151
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:37,552
No, I’m fine.

1152
01:03:37,596 --> 01:03:39,076
- You know the only reason
I took this job

1153
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,034
was to pay the bills.

1154
01:03:41,078 --> 01:03:45,734
I haven’t done massage in years.
I was a little worried.

1155
01:03:45,778 --> 01:03:48,215
You made it
very easy for me, Edward.

1156
01:03:59,226 --> 01:04:01,968
- No, I don't.

1157
01:04:13,501 --> 01:04:14,981
Hey.

1158
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:17,244
Ready to go?

1159
01:04:17,288 --> 01:04:19,290
- Yeah, what took you so long?

1160
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:24,948
- Oh, hi.

1161
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:27,298
- Hi, I’m Katie.

1162
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:31,998
- So are you gonna
tell me how it went?

1163
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:34,653
- I really like her.

1164
01:04:34,696 --> 01:04:36,611
- You really liked her?

1165
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:38,570
So it worked out?

1166
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:39,266
- Yeah.

1167
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,316
- I’m so...
I am so happy for you, Eddie.

1168
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,448
I’m so happy.

1169
01:04:47,492 --> 01:04:48,623
Yes!

1170
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:52,018
Yes!

1171
01:04:52,062 --> 01:04:54,194
- I told you it would work out.

1172
01:04:54,238 --> 01:04:55,369
- I can't believe it.

1173
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:57,067
Let me ask you
a question, though.

1174
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:59,025
All that stuff she said about
her job and everything,

1175
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:00,853
that’s all true, right?

1176
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,160
Well, sort of. I mean,

1177
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:08,165
she was a secretary,
and she did lose her job, but...

1178
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:10,254
- But what?

1179
01:05:12,169 --> 01:05:14,214
Tina. But what?

1180
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,782
In her prime,

1181
01:05:16,825 --> 01:05:19,393
Kate must've serviced half
of Pittsburgh.

1182
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:21,395
A few years ago,

1183
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:23,093
she sort of retired, you know.

1184
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:25,530
She’s getting older.
There was a drinking problem,

1185
01:05:25,573 --> 01:05:27,619
but all that’s behind her now.

1186
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:32,754
- Tina.

1187
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:35,192
You told me this was
the perfect girl for him.

1188
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:38,325
- Bobby, your friend
is in good hands.

1189
01:05:38,369 --> 01:05:40,632
I promise.

1190
01:05:41,894 --> 01:05:43,417
- Hi.

1191
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:46,507
Is it possible to speak
with Katie?

1192
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:48,988
- No, I’m sorry. Can I take a
number?

1193
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:50,120
Have her call you?

1194
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:52,949
- Sure. I’m at 717...

1195
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,826
Hello?

1196
01:06:00,869 --> 01:06:05,004
- Edward?

1197
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,963
- I’d like to take you
to dinner.

1198
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:09,704
- Wow, that’s kind of
a long way for you, isn’t it?

1199
01:06:09,748 --> 01:06:12,011
- Well, tomorrow’s Sunday.

1200
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:13,665
Nice day for a drive.

1201
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,320
- You're sure you don't mind
coming that far?

1202
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:18,626
- I’d be delighted.

1203
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:20,280
Where will I pick you up?

1204
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:23,240
- Could we meet somewhere?

1205
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:27,070
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1206
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,729
- Now, this may seem impulsive,
I realize,

1207
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:38,472
but you made me feel really
comfortable,

1208
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:41,780
and it’s been so long since
I’ve been near a strange woman.

1209
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:45,218
What I mean is...

1210
01:06:45,262 --> 01:06:46,959
I've looked at a lot
of women over the years,

1211
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:50,223
but my wife and I really loved
each other, and I never strayed.

1212
01:06:51,572 --> 01:06:52,834
- You were soul mates, huh?

1213
01:06:54,923 --> 01:06:56,577
- You mean,
were we really close?

1214
01:06:56,621 --> 01:06:57,274
Yes.

1215
01:06:58,623 --> 01:07:01,843
But that was then,
and this is now,

1216
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:05,673
and I want to be open
to whatever happens next.

1217
01:07:05,717 --> 01:07:07,066
I know I’m not expressing
myself very well.

1218
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,720
- No, no.

1219
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:10,243
But you made me comfortable,

1220
01:07:10,287 --> 01:07:13,420
and I wanted to see you again,
so here I am.

1221
01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:16,249
- Well, I’m really happy
to hear that.

1222
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:22,429
You must be

1223
01:07:22,473 --> 01:07:25,258
curious about me.
- Yes,

1224
01:07:25,302 --> 01:07:26,216
of course.

1225
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,743
- God, you know,
you have the most

1226
01:07:31,786 --> 01:07:34,354
amazing aura of stability,
did you know that?

1227
01:07:34,398 --> 01:07:37,401
It's very obvious in you.

1228
01:07:37,444 --> 01:07:39,751
So, I’ve always
wanted that for myself.

1229
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:41,927
I haven’t been able to achieve
it, but...

1230
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:50,762
- Do you have children?

1231
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,070
No, I can't have them.

1232
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:55,723
I married a couple.

1233
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,684
Didn’t realize it, but...

1234
01:07:59,727 --> 01:08:02,730
No, i'd say, I have
better luck with dogs.

1235
01:08:07,605 --> 01:08:09,650
- If you could

1236
01:08:09,694 --> 01:08:11,652
wave a magic wand

1237
01:08:11,696 --> 01:08:13,828
and make things just the way
you wanted them,

1238
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:17,136
how would that be?

1239
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,921
- I’d have to think about that.

1240
01:08:19,965 --> 01:08:21,662
You know, recently,
I’ve just been

1241
01:08:21,706 --> 01:08:23,795
so glad to be able
to pay the rent,

1242
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:25,971
feed the dogs...

1243
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:29,061
I haven’t really wished
for anything more.

1244
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,889
- Wouldn’t want to be rich?
Big house?

1245
01:08:30,932 --> 01:08:34,066
Nice car?

1246
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,633
Okay, this may sound strange,

1247
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:38,940
but these days,

1248
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:42,422
I’m more concerned
with my inner life.

1249
01:08:42,466 --> 01:08:46,034
You know, staying in tune
with my senses,

1250
01:08:46,078 --> 01:08:49,690
the rest just sort of feels
like window dressing.

1251
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:55,914
- Should we order?

1252
01:08:55,957 --> 01:08:57,133
- Yeah.

1253
01:09:13,932 --> 01:09:15,977
I like you very much, Edward,

1254
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:18,850
but I can't take you home.

1255
01:09:18,893 --> 01:09:20,199
- I wouldn’t expect you to.

1256
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:23,463
- It just wouldn’t feel
comfortable, you know?

1257
01:09:27,728 --> 01:09:29,469
I should know better
than to share

1258
01:09:29,513 --> 01:09:31,036
things with people
I’ve just met,

1259
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:32,777
but you're different,

1260
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:36,476
so here goes...

1261
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,654
I still have this fantasy about
a man looking after me.

1262
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:44,876
- I understand that.

1263
01:09:44,919 --> 01:09:47,183
- Somehow I knew you would.

1264
01:09:50,273 --> 01:09:52,318
- I had a great time.

1265
01:09:52,362 --> 01:09:53,232
- So did I.

1266
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:00,674
- Drive carefully.

1267
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:01,632
- Okay.

1268
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,772
- Hey, I’m about
a half hour away.

1269
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:14,645
If I came by,
could I talk to you?

1270
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:19,432
- Why are you here
on a Sunday night?

1271
01:10:19,476 --> 01:10:20,738
- Well, it’s all sort
of complicated.

1272
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:22,914
I’m doing a half-assed
inventory.

1273
01:10:22,957 --> 01:10:24,220
That girl Marcy...

1274
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:25,264
- The one you were...

1275
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:26,961
- My little darling.

1276
01:10:27,005 --> 01:10:28,572
Things started to disappear.

1277
01:10:28,615 --> 01:10:31,923
First a few smaller pieces, then
a Ruby and diamond bracelet.

1278
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:34,665
She and Doris were the only ones
who had access to the cases,

1279
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:37,929
and Doris... well, you know, she
has been with me for 20 years.

1280
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:39,147
- You didn't catch her
in the act?

1281
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:41,367
Nah, I just got rid of her.

1282
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:44,370
Now I gotta go through
all the stock.

1283
01:10:44,414 --> 01:10:47,982
So I let my dick
get the better of me,

1284
01:10:48,026 --> 01:10:49,114
but what the hell?

1285
01:10:49,157 --> 01:10:50,507
- Could've been worse.

1286
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:51,682
- Yeah.

1287
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:56,339
Yeah, and I was having
a time there.

1288
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:59,167
- You know,
this is a coincidence.

1289
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:02,083
I think I’ve met a woman.

1290
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:04,260
I have to get to know her
a little bit better, but...

1291
01:11:05,435 --> 01:11:07,654
- I hope this isn’t
a young kid.

1292
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:09,047
You don't want to do what I did.
- No.

1293
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,178
Nothing like that.

1294
01:11:13,486 --> 01:11:15,009
The real issue is...

1295
01:11:15,053 --> 01:11:18,012
When I was getting better,

1296
01:11:18,056 --> 01:11:20,841
I had the feeling that

1297
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:23,322
the business was all I had to
keep me connected to the world.

1298
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:28,588
Sitting across from
this woman tonight,

1299
01:11:28,632 --> 01:11:32,505
I realized I wanted
my life to be different.

1300
01:11:32,549 --> 01:11:34,290
I didn't want
to be hanging onto that line

1301
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,596
until I dropped dead.

1302
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,772
- Eddie,

1303
01:11:38,816 --> 01:11:40,905
you been taking care of business
as long as I’ve known you,

1304
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:43,081
and I admire you for it.

1305
01:11:43,124 --> 01:11:45,997
You done more than your share,

1306
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,128
but when do you get yours?

1307
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:49,522
- I have very few regrets, tip.

1308
01:11:49,566 --> 01:11:51,219
- No, I know,

1309
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:53,787
but I’m talking about now,

1310
01:11:53,831 --> 01:11:55,746
because I see battles out there
that you can't win.

1311
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:04,842
- Hey, where’s those
fucking nachos.

1312
01:12:04,885 --> 01:12:05,843
- Shut up.

1313
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:07,061
- Come on, will ya?

1314
01:12:07,105 --> 01:12:08,193
I wanna eat already.

1315
01:12:13,546 --> 01:12:14,242
- Move it.

1316
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:24,557
- Let go of me you fuck.

1317
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:26,167
- Come on, be nice, huh.

1318
01:12:26,211 --> 01:12:27,908
- Let go.

1319
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,345
- don't tell me what to do.

1320
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:30,911
- The game is on. Shut up!

1321
01:12:37,396 --> 01:12:40,181
- Suppose I came up with a way
to get us a lot of money.

1322
01:12:40,225 --> 01:12:41,792
- And how are you gonna
do that?

1323
01:12:41,835 --> 01:12:44,185
You gonna work doubles
at the jerk-off palace?

1324
01:12:46,144 --> 01:12:47,537
- It's just bullshit money.

1325
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,277
- What kinda money you talking
about?

1326
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:51,236
- A lot more than you got off
that truck.

1327
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:53,281
- Yeah, sure.

1328
01:12:55,022 --> 01:12:56,720
- This guy came in to Tina’s,

1329
01:12:56,763 --> 01:12:58,678
travelling salesman.

1330
01:12:58,722 --> 01:13:00,245
He's got diamonds.

1331
01:13:00,288 --> 01:13:02,421
- How do you know?

1332
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:06,164
- Because I saw him
at the jewelry store

1333
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:08,471
when I was I the office.

1334
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:16,609
- And you're sure
this was the same guy.

1335
01:13:16,653 --> 01:13:18,785
- Yeah. He came in
with a friend of Tina’s.

1336
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:20,874
They travel together.

1337
01:13:20,918 --> 01:13:22,485
- Did he recognize you?

1338
01:13:22,528 --> 01:13:23,834
- No, he never saw me.

1339
01:13:23,877 --> 01:13:25,357
- Is he gonna come back?

1340
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:29,666
- Did you fuck him?
- No.

1341
01:13:29,709 --> 01:13:31,232
- You're lying.

1342
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:32,843
- I swear to god, I didn't.
- You think this is funny?

1343
01:13:32,886 --> 01:13:34,714
You fucking lying to me?

1344
01:13:34,758 --> 01:13:35,933
- I gave him a handjob.

1345
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:38,239
You know you're
the only one I fuck.

1346
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:40,111
don't fuck with me.

1347
01:13:40,154 --> 01:13:42,461
I hate that place. I wouldn’t
have anything to do with it,

1348
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:45,029
if you two would make a decent
score now and then.

1349
01:13:45,072 --> 01:13:46,509
- What did you say?

1350
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:47,814
- Stop it. Do you hear me?

1351
01:13:51,122 --> 01:13:53,167
- I wanna hear about
those diamonds.

1352
01:13:57,998 --> 01:14:00,436
And you gotta
be thinking all the time

1353
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:02,307
about everything,

1354
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:06,311
the weather, the customer,
the line, the road.

1355
01:14:06,354 --> 01:14:07,965
It's all part of it.

1356
01:14:08,008 --> 01:14:09,445
You see, that’s what I mean when
I say you live by your wits.

1357
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:15,625
- You really think I can do it?

1358
01:14:15,668 --> 01:14:17,017
- Why not?

1359
01:14:17,061 --> 01:14:20,020
- I don't know.

1360
01:14:20,064 --> 01:14:22,501
I’m not like you.

1361
01:14:22,545 --> 01:14:24,111
I never will be.

1362
01:14:24,155 --> 01:14:26,113
- You don't have to be like me.

1363
01:14:26,157 --> 01:14:27,288
You got personality to burn.

1364
01:14:27,332 --> 01:14:29,116
You're gonna be fine.

1365
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:44,436
- You have one new message.

1366
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,916
- Hey, Edward.

1367
01:14:45,959 --> 01:14:48,527
It's Katie.

1368
01:14:48,571 --> 01:14:50,224
You were really sweet
the other night,

1369
01:14:50,268 --> 01:14:51,748
and I hope I didn't say anything

1370
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:54,490
that gave you
the wrong impression.

1371
01:14:54,533 --> 01:14:56,927
If you're coming through,
please give me a call.

1372
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:58,885
I’d love to see you.

1373
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:02,019
My home phone is 814-368...

1374
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:03,368
- I gotta make
a phone call or two.

1375
01:15:03,411 --> 01:15:07,590
- Okay. Just going over
my notes.

1376
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:09,766
- No, I didn't think
you were being rude.

1377
01:15:09,809 --> 01:15:11,550
I thought you were
protecting yourself.

1378
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:15,380
- Do you know that
you're too nice?

1379
01:15:16,947 --> 01:15:18,862
So where are you?
Can you come by?

1380
01:15:18,905 --> 01:15:20,167
- We're on our way back.

1381
01:15:20,211 --> 01:15:21,821
Yeah, could I come
by for a little bit?

1382
01:15:21,865 --> 01:15:23,997
- I’ll make you dinner.

1383
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:26,565
- All the better. Where are you?

1384
01:15:26,609 --> 01:15:28,219
- I’m only five minutes
from Tina’s.

1385
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:30,090
- Look, when you get to town,
call me,

1386
01:15:30,134 --> 01:15:31,483
and I’ll give you directions,
okay?

1387
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,224
- Will do.

1388
01:15:36,967 --> 01:15:38,446
We're gonna be late
getting into Harrisburg.

1389
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:42,799
What would you think about
a little stop?

1390
01:15:42,842 --> 01:15:43,843
- You mean, like Altoona?

1391
01:15:47,412 --> 01:15:48,326
- I gave it a thought.

1392
01:15:52,373 --> 01:15:53,461
- Can I see the cell phone,
please?

1393
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:01,295
Hey, Tina, we're gonna be
by in a couple of hours.

1394
01:16:01,339 --> 01:16:04,037
What are the chances
of me seeing cherry?

1395
01:16:04,081 --> 01:16:05,386
- She isn’t here,

1396
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,692
but I’ll beep her.

1397
01:16:07,998 --> 01:16:10,217
- Must really be exciting, huh?

1398
01:16:10,261 --> 01:16:12,219
Starting out with a new woman
after all these years?

1399
01:16:15,527 --> 01:16:16,441
- It's different.

1400
01:16:18,748 --> 01:16:22,839
- Well, something I’ll probably
never experience.

1401
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:27,017
- For what it’s worth,

1402
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,454
all those years on the road,

1403
01:16:29,497 --> 01:16:30,934
sometimes the weather was lousy,

1404
01:16:30,977 --> 01:16:33,110
the business was lousy,

1405
01:16:33,153 --> 01:16:36,200
sometimes I didn't know what
I was doing out there anyway,

1406
01:16:36,243 --> 01:16:38,028
but I always knew
I had a good woman

1407
01:16:38,071 --> 01:16:39,333
waiting for me when I got home.

1408
01:16:39,377 --> 01:16:41,684
That's a big thing.

1409
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:46,514
- Even when they get old?

1410
01:16:46,558 --> 01:16:49,866
- Ka-pow! I’ll give you old.

1411
01:16:49,909 --> 01:16:51,258
What'd I tell you about that?

1412
01:16:51,302 --> 01:16:54,174
- I’m sorry, man.
I’m an asshole.

1413
01:16:54,218 --> 01:16:55,262
- I won't argue that.

1414
01:16:55,306 --> 01:16:57,264
I’m just telling you.

1415
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:04,358
- Listen, why don't you come in
for a second.

1416
01:17:04,402 --> 01:17:05,882
- No.
- Come on.

1417
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:10,060
She’s waiting for me to call.
I’ll pick you back up in

1418
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:11,583
a couple hours, all right?

1419
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,106
Listen, I want you to meet
this chick. She’s so hot.

1420
01:17:13,150 --> 01:17:16,457
Plus, Tina wanted to say hi.
- Two minutes.

1421
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:17,415
- All right.

1422
01:17:19,852 --> 01:17:21,637
- don't turn around.
- We got guns!

1423
01:17:26,293 --> 01:17:27,730
- What is this? A joke
or something?

1424
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:30,341
- Keep your mouth shut.
- Be quiet, Bobby.

1425
01:17:30,384 --> 01:17:31,908
- Do exactly what we say.

1426
01:17:34,606 --> 01:17:36,260
- All right.
- Shut the fuck up!

1427
01:17:36,303 --> 01:17:38,175
- All right!
- Turn around, you.

1428
01:17:41,482 --> 01:17:44,050
- Keep your head down,
you fucking goat.

1429
01:17:44,094 --> 01:17:46,618
don't you fucking look at me,
or I’ll blow your head off.

1430
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,054
- What?
- I heard you.

1431
01:17:49,142 --> 01:17:50,404
- Now open the trunk.

1432
01:17:50,448 --> 01:17:51,710
- Look, man. We don't got
nothing.

1433
01:17:51,754 --> 01:17:53,233
- Open the fucking trunk.

1434
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:54,365
- We don't have anything.
- Bobby,

1435
01:17:54,408 --> 01:17:55,801
keep quiet.

1436
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:56,715
Give him the keys.

1437
01:17:56,759 --> 01:17:59,587
- Fine.

1438
01:17:59,631 --> 01:18:02,025
- Dude, we just came
to get laid, man.

1439
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:03,635
- What?
- Yeah, man,

1440
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,289
there’s this
hot redhead chick in there.

1441
01:18:05,332 --> 01:18:06,986
- "“Hot redhead,"” huh?
- Yeah, I came to bang her.

1442
01:18:07,030 --> 01:18:08,901
- Came to get laid, huh?
- Yes.

1443
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,949
- All right. Open the trunk.
Hear me?

1444
01:18:12,992 --> 01:18:15,429
- don't set off the fucking
alarm either.

1445
01:18:18,215 --> 01:18:19,129
Jackpot.

1446
01:18:21,131 --> 01:18:23,350
Hit him.
- Why?

1447
01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:24,743
- Because I fucking said so,
that’s why. Hit him.

1448
01:18:24,787 --> 01:18:26,876
- I’m not gonna hit him.
I’ll fucking kill him.

1449
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:28,834
- Fucking hit him.
- Take the stuff, it’s yours.

1450
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:34,318
Get him off of me.

1451
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:36,973
You stupid motherfucker.

1452
01:18:42,892 --> 01:18:44,807
- Stop it!

1453
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,157
- Came here to get laid, huh,
motherfucker?

1454
01:19:06,176 --> 01:19:07,090
Bobby?

1455
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:10,310
Bobby?

1456
01:19:10,354 --> 01:19:12,225
Bobby, are you awake?

1457
01:19:12,269 --> 01:19:14,575
Can you hear me?

1458
01:19:14,619 --> 01:19:15,707
- I think so.

1459
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:17,796
- Bobby.

1460
01:19:19,842 --> 01:19:20,843
Bobby, you okay?

1461
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:22,322
- What’s that smell?

1462
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,413
It smells like someone died.

1463
01:19:26,457 --> 01:19:28,459
- That's the Chinese food.

1464
01:19:28,502 --> 01:19:30,635
You left Chinese food
in here again.

1465
01:19:30,678 --> 01:19:32,593
- Oh.

1466
01:19:32,637 --> 01:19:33,943
Sorry.

1467
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:35,901
- Get untied and help me
out here, will you?

1468
01:19:40,297 --> 01:19:41,298
- Are you tied?

1469
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:49,697
- What are you doing back
there?

1470
01:19:51,134 --> 01:19:52,135
- I’m tied back here.

1471
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:53,571
They tied me up, those punks.

1472
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:55,834
- Can you open the door?

1473
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,360
- I can't open the door.
They got the child lock on.

1474
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:03,668
- All right, let me try.

1475
01:20:05,104 --> 01:20:07,063
Aw, shit.

1476
01:20:07,106 --> 01:20:08,412
Those fucking assholes.

1477
01:20:11,545 --> 01:20:12,633
Oh, my head hurts.

1478
01:20:14,853 --> 01:20:17,029
Aw, shit!

1479
01:20:17,073 --> 01:20:18,857
- You all right?

1480
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:20,032
Bobby?

1481
01:20:20,076 --> 01:20:21,817
- The grass is wet.

1482
01:20:25,037 --> 01:20:28,214
- So what’s the value of this
jewelry?

1483
01:20:28,258 --> 01:20:30,086
- Over a million in wholesale.

1484
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:31,522
- Jesus.

1485
01:20:31,565 --> 01:20:34,612
This is a risky business
you're in.

1486
01:20:34,655 --> 01:20:36,657
Nobody knew
what we were carrying.

1487
01:20:36,701 --> 01:20:39,747
Still, I think we want to speak
to these whores.

1488
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:42,228
- They’re not whores.

1489
01:20:42,272 --> 01:20:45,231
- Sonny, I’m familiar
with the parties in question.

1490
01:20:45,275 --> 01:20:46,363
- They’re whores.

1491
01:20:52,935 --> 01:20:56,634
- So what do we do next?

1492
01:20:56,677 --> 01:20:58,679
- Why, you can kiss jewelry
business good-bye.

1493
01:21:03,293 --> 01:21:05,251
- I told 'em what I could.

1494
01:21:05,295 --> 01:21:06,905
Sorry, guys.

1495
01:21:08,298 --> 01:21:10,691
- It wasn't your fault.

1496
01:21:10,735 --> 01:21:14,260
- Nobody here knew you were
carrying all that stuff.

1497
01:21:15,653 --> 01:21:16,741
Not that it matters.

1498
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:19,700
That cherry didn't show.

1499
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:23,487
- It doesn’t matter.

1500
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:24,662
She didn't know anything.

1501
01:21:31,364 --> 01:21:33,714
- The girls are really freaked.

1502
01:21:33,758 --> 01:21:35,934
They’re not used to
talking to the cops,

1503
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:37,675
with their clothes on.

1504
01:21:43,855 --> 01:21:45,857
She gave your friend Tip's
with false information.

1505
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,467
Her real name is Michelle Bliane

1506
01:21:47,511 --> 01:21:49,687
and she's wanted on a number

1507
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:52,385
of retail thefts.

1508
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:55,214
- So she just

1509
01:21:55,258 --> 01:21:56,172
disappeared?

1510
01:21:58,043 --> 01:21:59,436
- She’ll show up.

1511
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:01,133
Sooner or later.

1512
01:22:02,482 --> 01:22:04,136
- And what about the jewelry?

1513
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:07,531
- It's probably been
fenced already.

1514
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:11,578
- And Catherine harnish.

1515
01:22:11,622 --> 01:22:14,059
The woman you are
going to visit?

1516
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:15,408
She’s not a suspect,

1517
01:22:15,452 --> 01:22:17,193
but she's not exactly
the girl next door.

1518
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,162
- Okay.

1519
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:41,565
- You know what this is going to
do with our insurance premium?

1520
01:22:41,608 --> 01:22:44,002
What were you doing going
in massage parlors?

1521
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:45,395
What were you thinking?

1522
01:22:45,438 --> 01:22:46,483
- I don't know
what happened to me.

1523
01:22:46,526 --> 01:22:48,006
- You lost your fucking mind.

1524
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:50,661
That's what happened.

1525
01:22:50,704 --> 01:22:52,141
You’ll never work in this
industry again, Eddie.

1526
01:23:00,932 --> 01:23:03,326
- Eddie.
- Bobby.

1527
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:05,371
- Hey, I’ve been
calling you, man.

1528
01:23:05,415 --> 01:23:08,287
Did you get my messages?
- Yeah, I got 'em.

1529
01:23:08,331 --> 01:23:11,856
- How you been?
- I’m fine.

1530
01:23:14,685 --> 01:23:16,730
- So, you want to get together
or something?

1531
01:23:16,774 --> 01:23:18,036
Hangout? I miss you, man.

1532
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,038
- Yeah.

1533
01:23:20,082 --> 01:23:21,518
Sure we will
we'll get together.

1534
01:23:24,434 --> 01:23:27,132
- Eddie, we just had
a bad break, you know,

1535
01:23:27,176 --> 01:23:29,047
I can't let that
keep us down, right?

1536
01:23:29,091 --> 01:23:30,744
- Bobby, I am...

1537
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:35,401
I think I need
a little time to myself.

1538
01:23:35,445 --> 01:23:38,665
- Eddie, you can bounce
back from this.

1539
01:23:38,709 --> 01:23:40,058
You're a hell of a guy.

1540
01:23:40,102 --> 01:23:41,146
I know it.

1541
01:23:42,234 --> 01:23:43,148
- Thanks.

1542
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:46,195
- I guess I’m just
trying to say

1543
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:48,197
I want to stay in touch
with you, man.

1544
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,720
- We'll do that. Don't worry.

1545
01:23:49,763 --> 01:23:51,200
We'll stay in touch.

1546
01:23:51,243 --> 01:23:54,072
I’ll give you a call, all right?

1547
01:23:54,116 --> 01:23:56,596
- Eddie.
- Take care now.

1548
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:18,270
Come on in. It's wide open.

1549
01:24:33,024 --> 01:24:34,721
- How are you, Edward?

1550
01:24:36,419 --> 01:24:38,638
- I've been better.

1551
01:24:38,682 --> 01:24:40,684
I suppose I’ve been worse.

1552
01:24:43,687 --> 01:24:45,254
- I didn't hear from you.

1553
01:24:47,647 --> 01:24:49,040
- You know, the cops,

1554
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:52,348
FBI, investigators...

1555
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:54,263
I haven’t had a lot
of time for myself.

1556
01:24:55,351 --> 01:24:56,569
- Did anything turn up?

1557
01:24:57,918 --> 01:24:59,094
- No.

1558
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:05,100
- So why didn't you phone me?

1559
01:25:05,143 --> 01:25:06,101
- I intended to.

1560
01:25:07,885 --> 01:25:10,279
- I almost did a couple
of times, it just...

1561
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:14,805
- You just...

1562
01:25:17,764 --> 01:25:20,376
- My problems have become
a little more complex.

1563
01:25:21,986 --> 01:25:23,422
- What are you talking about?

1564
01:25:25,294 --> 01:25:27,296
- I think that
whatever future I had

1565
01:25:27,339 --> 01:25:29,124
went out the window
with those diamonds.

1566
01:25:31,343 --> 01:25:34,129
- I can't believe
you think that way.

1567
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:36,522
- I don't even know
where I’m going to get a job.

1568
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:44,095
- Do you believe
in a higher power?

1569
01:25:45,183 --> 01:25:47,229
A universal spirit,

1570
01:25:47,272 --> 01:25:49,579
god, whatever?

1571
01:25:51,015 --> 01:25:52,147
- I’m not sure I do.

1572
01:25:53,844 --> 01:25:55,585
You know these last few years
have been pretty...

1573
01:25:55,628 --> 01:25:58,675
Yeah, I know. Mine have been
shitty too,

1574
01:25:58,718 --> 01:26:00,590
but Edward,

1575
01:26:00,633 --> 01:26:03,288
it doesn’t matter
what went wrong or why.

1576
01:26:03,332 --> 01:26:05,986
It's all in the past,

1577
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:07,640
and you have to move forward

1578
01:26:07,684 --> 01:26:09,947
with the flow
of your life and trust

1579
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:14,212
that a higher power
will provide the rest.

1580
01:26:14,256 --> 01:26:16,780
- I’m gonna lose this house.

1581
01:26:16,823 --> 01:26:19,043
I still have medical
bills from Sarah.

1582
01:26:19,086 --> 01:26:21,219
I’m just one step away
from the street.

1583
01:26:23,656 --> 01:26:26,050
- So you move in with me.

1584
01:26:29,619 --> 01:26:30,707
Look, Edward.

1585
01:26:31,838 --> 01:26:34,754
Eddie.

1586
01:26:34,798 --> 01:26:36,582
I didn't have to spend
a whole lot of time

1587
01:26:36,626 --> 01:26:37,801
with you to know that you are

1588
01:26:37,844 --> 01:26:41,979
the best man I’ve met in ages.

1589
01:26:42,022 --> 01:26:43,241
And you're gonna
get back on your feet.

1590
01:26:43,285 --> 01:26:44,764
I just... I know you will.

1591
01:26:44,808 --> 01:26:47,158
I mean, it may take some time,

1592
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,942
but you're gonna do it.

1593
01:26:48,986 --> 01:26:50,161
I just...

1594
01:26:52,424 --> 01:26:53,338
I know it.

1595
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:20,626
- Tina!

1596
01:27:23,673 --> 01:27:25,805
Hey.

1597
01:27:25,849 --> 01:27:28,504
Look at you.

1598
01:27:30,114 --> 01:27:32,377
You look so handsome.

1599
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:34,510
- Handsome.
- So expensive.

1600
01:27:34,553 --> 01:27:35,902
- Expensive. Thank you.

1601
01:27:35,946 --> 01:27:37,774
Yeah, I’m a big executive now.

1602
01:27:37,817 --> 01:27:40,167
- Oh, excuse me.
- Yeah, that’s right. Yup.

1603
01:27:40,211 --> 01:27:42,605
I’m in charge of all
the snack machines

1604
01:27:42,648 --> 01:27:44,302
from Boston to Miami.

1605
01:27:44,346 --> 01:27:46,826
- Oh.

1606
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:48,001
Snack machines are good.
- Yeah.

1607
01:27:48,045 --> 01:27:49,568
- Everybody snacks.

1608
01:27:49,612 --> 01:27:50,961
- That's right. That's right.

1609
01:27:51,004 --> 01:27:51,918
- Yeah.

1610
01:27:56,009 --> 01:27:58,838
- So after my first promotion.

1611
01:27:58,882 --> 01:28:00,362
- Promotion?

1612
01:28:00,405 --> 01:28:02,973
- Two promotions.

1613
01:28:03,016 --> 01:28:05,105
- Really?
- Yeah.

1614
01:28:05,149 --> 01:28:07,717
- It's big time, man.

1615
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,936
- It's going really good.

1616
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:10,981
- I’m so proud of you.

1617
01:28:11,024 --> 01:28:13,244
- Thank you. Thank you.

1618
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:16,203
- I knew you'd be okay.

1619
01:28:21,513 --> 01:28:23,298
- Do you ever hear from Katie?

1620
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:29,565
- No. I mean, she said she’d
call me when she settled down,

1621
01:28:29,608 --> 01:28:31,088
but she never did.

1622
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:34,265
- Yeah.

1623
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,136
I never hear from Eddie either.

1624
01:28:39,009 --> 01:28:40,576
I think the robbery
took a lot out of him.

1625
01:28:46,625 --> 01:28:48,540
I don't know where I'd be
without that guy.

1626
01:28:52,022 --> 01:28:53,197
He helped me a lot.

1627
01:29:00,813 --> 01:29:02,337
- Hold on a second.

1628
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,868
Here.

1629
01:29:11,911 --> 01:29:13,217
don't tell anybody
where you got it.

1630
01:29:15,959 --> 01:29:18,222
- Where... where is this?

1631
01:29:18,265 --> 01:29:20,485
- Mexico.

1632
01:29:20,529 --> 01:29:22,531
I wasn't supposed
to tell anybody,

1633
01:29:22,574 --> 01:29:24,054
but it’s been so long,

1634
01:29:24,097 --> 01:29:25,098
I figured... what the hell?

1635
01:29:27,492 --> 01:29:30,321
- Is this where Eddie is?

1636
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:31,844
- It's where Katie is,
that’s all I know.

1637
01:29:38,721 --> 01:29:40,810
So I guess this is it
for a while.

1638
01:29:45,205 --> 01:29:47,251
- I’m in Pittsburgh
all the time.

1639
01:29:47,294 --> 01:29:49,122
I’ll come back and visit.

1640
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:51,951
- I don't think so.

1641
01:29:51,995 --> 01:29:53,344
Bye, sweetie.

1642
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:22,025
- Mi nombre es Bobby.

1643
01:30:22,068 --> 01:30:24,070
Roberto Walker.

1644
01:30:26,464 --> 01:30:27,944
Como se llamas?

1645
01:30:29,032 --> 01:30:30,337
- Me llamo Felipe.

1646
01:30:30,381 --> 01:30:31,600
- Felipe.

1647
01:30:31,643 --> 01:30:34,603
Felipe,

1648
01:30:34,646 --> 01:30:36,909
donde vamos...

1649
01:30:36,953 --> 01:30:38,215
The right place?

1650
01:30:39,738 --> 01:30:40,913
- don't worry, senor.

1651
01:30:40,957 --> 01:30:42,437
I know this place.

1652
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,133
- You sure?

1653
01:30:59,628 --> 01:31:01,717
- Mira, chico.

1654
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,022
Sorry, man.

1655
01:31:04,807 --> 01:31:06,852
Keep the dinero, okay, Felipe?

1656
01:31:06,896 --> 01:31:08,811
Thanks, man.

1657
01:31:08,854 --> 01:31:10,769
- Pendejo.

1658
01:31:24,174 --> 01:31:25,088
- Katie.

1659
01:31:30,006 --> 01:31:31,964
- Bobby?

1660
01:31:32,008 --> 01:31:33,488
- Can you open the gate?

1661
01:31:35,141 --> 01:31:36,273
- It's open.

1662
01:31:43,672 --> 01:31:45,543
- Bobby?

1663
01:31:45,587 --> 01:31:47,545
Oh, my god.

1664
01:31:47,589 --> 01:31:49,895
Will you look at this?

1665
01:31:49,939 --> 01:31:52,115
How you doing, kid?
- Hey.

1666
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:54,030
How you doing?

1667
01:31:54,073 --> 01:31:55,727
- I’m confused.

1668
01:31:55,771 --> 01:31:56,728
What are you doing here?

1669
01:31:56,772 --> 01:31:57,990
Are you working?

1670
01:31:58,034 --> 01:31:59,905
I don't understand.

1671
01:31:59,949 --> 01:32:00,950
- Yeah,

1672
01:32:00,993 --> 01:32:03,692
but this is our house.

1673
01:32:05,607 --> 01:32:07,478
- This is your house?

1674
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:08,566
- What do you want to drink,
huh?

1675
01:32:08,610 --> 01:32:09,480
- I’ll get it.
What do you want?

1676
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,960
Lemonade, something stronger?

1677
01:32:11,003 --> 01:32:12,004
- Yeah, something stiff.

1678
01:32:13,876 --> 01:32:15,834
- Sit down. Come on.

1679
01:32:19,577 --> 01:32:21,361
- This is unbelievable.

1680
01:32:24,843 --> 01:32:27,411
- So did Tina tell you
where to find us?

1681
01:32:28,891 --> 01:32:30,501
- It's okay.

1682
01:32:32,068 --> 01:32:33,722
Eddie wanted
to get in touch with you,

1683
01:32:33,765 --> 01:32:34,853
and I wouldn’t let him.
I wouldn’t

1684
01:32:34,897 --> 01:32:36,289
let him talk to anybody.

1685
01:32:37,987 --> 01:32:38,988
Our situation here is

1686
01:32:39,031 --> 01:32:42,034
a little bit complicated.

1687
01:32:44,646 --> 01:32:46,430
- I just worried that Eddie

1688
01:32:46,473 --> 01:32:48,084
held me responsible
for the robbery.

1689
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:52,305
- Hey, here’s a lemonade,

1690
01:32:52,349 --> 01:32:54,481
and this one’s a little
bit stiffer.

1691
01:33:00,357 --> 01:33:03,142
- I owe you an explanation.

1692
01:33:03,186 --> 01:33:04,448
Let me show you something.

1693
01:33:10,149 --> 01:33:11,847
Remember how scared
I was about security?

1694
01:33:11,890 --> 01:33:13,588
- Yeah.
- I mean, listen,

1695
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:15,024
all my life I was worried
about just the sort of thing

1696
01:33:15,067 --> 01:33:16,242
that happened there in Altoona.

1697
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:19,768
15 years ago, I got a solution.

1698
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,860
I started having them
cut a little compartment

1699
01:33:24,903 --> 01:33:27,732
in the bottom of the trunk here

1700
01:33:27,776 --> 01:33:29,604
just big enough

1701
01:33:32,476 --> 01:33:34,870
for the line.

1702
01:33:34,913 --> 01:33:36,698
Then I got a second box,

1703
01:33:36,741 --> 01:33:39,004
filled it up with costume
jewelry and a diamond wallet

1704
01:33:39,048 --> 01:33:40,745
with some C.Z.S in it.

1705
01:33:40,789 --> 01:33:42,442
You know, they do a pretty good
job with that stuff.

1706
01:33:42,486 --> 01:33:45,315
Only a jeweler could tell
the difference.

1707
01:33:47,012 --> 01:33:50,581
And whenever I was
the least bit worried

1708
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:53,453
about where I was
or who was around,

1709
01:33:53,497 --> 01:33:55,151
I put the real diamonds
underneath

1710
01:33:55,194 --> 01:33:56,805
and the dummy case on top.

1711
01:34:05,727 --> 01:34:08,033
- So those assholes
got the dummy line?

1712
01:34:08,077 --> 01:34:10,296
- They certainly did.

1713
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:12,472
- And that means that
you got the real line.

1714
01:34:12,516 --> 01:34:15,824
- Hey, a million dollars
at wholesale

1715
01:34:15,867 --> 01:34:17,869
goes a long way down here.

1716
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:22,744
They were getting ready to toss
me away.

1717
01:34:22,787 --> 01:34:23,788
- I know.

1718
01:34:23,832 --> 01:34:24,789
- They were gonna
take the old man

1719
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:26,051
and throw him on the junk heap.

1720
01:34:26,095 --> 01:34:28,010
- You are not old, baby.

1721
01:34:28,053 --> 01:34:29,011
- You're just mature.

1722
01:34:29,054 --> 01:34:30,795
- Ooh. She’s good.

1723
01:34:30,839 --> 01:34:31,535
- Very good.
- Yeah, she's great.

1724
01:34:37,889 --> 01:34:40,805
My daughter in San Diego comes
down every couple of weeks.

1725
01:34:40,849 --> 01:34:42,677
My daughter from England
will be here next month.

1726
01:34:44,287 --> 01:34:45,201
This is heaven.

1727
01:34:50,902 --> 01:34:53,209
What is it?

1728
01:34:53,252 --> 01:34:54,645
- Nothing.

1729
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:55,733
Nothing.

1730
01:34:55,777 --> 01:34:57,082
Just taking it all in.

1731
01:35:00,782 --> 01:35:03,785
I didn't plan to steal
those diamonds.

1732
01:35:03,828 --> 01:35:04,786
It just sorta happened.

1733
01:35:04,829 --> 01:35:05,917
- I know.

1734
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:07,136
- Just turned out that way.

1735
01:35:07,179 --> 01:35:09,007
- Eddie,

1736
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:11,531
I’m glad you did.
I’m happy for you.

1737
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:20,279
- And Katie?

1738
01:35:20,323 --> 01:35:22,673
There is no better woman.

1739
01:35:25,545 --> 01:35:29,245
And I know about the backside.

1740
01:35:29,288 --> 01:35:30,899
She told me that,

1741
01:35:30,942 --> 01:35:33,466
and you know, we...

1742
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:36,165
We both left our pasts
behind us.

1743
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:37,166
You tried to get me to do that.

1744
01:35:37,209 --> 01:35:40,343
I should've listened to you.

1745
01:35:40,386 --> 01:35:45,087
And she's taught me
some things about sex

1746
01:35:45,130 --> 01:35:48,612
that I’ll bet you
even you don't know.

1747
01:35:48,655 --> 01:35:50,309
- I don't know
if i'd go that far.

1748
01:35:53,878 --> 01:35:55,097
- So you wanna dance with me?

1749
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:58,361
- I certainly do. See?

1750
01:35:58,404 --> 01:36:00,755
I’d go out and get myself
a senorita, if I were you.

1751
01:36:02,104 --> 01:36:04,062
They’re all over the place.

1752
01:36:04,106 --> 01:36:05,063
- I think I’ll do that.

1753
01:36:22,037 --> 01:36:23,342
- Ahem.

1754
01:36:35,311 --> 01:36:39,228
Ahem.
