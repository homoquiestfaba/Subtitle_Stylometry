00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,621
lovely sister Dominique!

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,429
We congratulate you on
buying our DVD or blu-ray.

5
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,070
You may now join us
for one week in our home,

6
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,104
We'll have a look behind the scenes
and of course before the scenes!

7
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,431
You'll see our uncensored
live shows and we hope

8
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,665
you'll like it. In the main menu
you can select individual shows,

9
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,911
thus skipping the rest of the guided tour!
At the end of the movie you'll find

10
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,711
contact details and
how to book and create a show!

11
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,790
Lay back and
enjoy the most erotic

12
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,423

in an 80 minute roundup!

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,111
Not at all! I'm fine, thanks!

20
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,705
Thought so!

21
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,547
Any specific reason
for you to be here?

22
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,544
No! I simply enjoy
to watch you at work!

the dirty work for Maman, too?

Come again?

26
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,983
Just asking!
Because in my books

27
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,825
that's just an overpaid clean-up job!

28
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,631
Jadé, are you looking for trouble?

29
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,351
Me? No! And what for'?
I'm fine with it!

30

Since when do we
need to plan this shit?

When you buy a little
dog, he's your property!

50
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,669
He's beneath you. Whatever
you say, it's the law.

51
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,667
Sit! And he sits.

52
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,701
Give paw! He gives paw.
I've bought you dirty whores

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,989

you'll do the planning!

cactus up your cunt then...

55
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,103
Then I'll stick a cactus up my cunt!

Is the camera team already there?

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,101
Great, I'm coming down!

72
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,710
Man is a predator and
an individual, which is fed up fast

73
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,502
with something. From time
immemorial we've been carnivores,

74
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:13,021
living on the hunt. Over time and
with the invention of supermarkets

75
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,783
we needed to find something different
to hunt. That's where the ladies came into play

76
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,390
and we men were hunting
them and there wet pussies!

77
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,265
But now we're fed up with that as well.

78
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,179
We're bored to visit
the same clubs each evening

79
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,822
waiting for the one
to take us home tonight.

80
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,870
So what now'?

81
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,223
What to do? I know.

82
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,790
Fill the niche in the market
which covers this boredom,

83
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,104
which eliminates this boredom.
Busy for one moment!

84
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,904
I bought this nightclub
from an old lady.

85
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,906
And her brilliant idea as well.

86
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,110

I'm Monsieur Mather': Maxime's wife!

an employee and then it went

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,704
pretty fast when Monsieur

00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,427

- It was!

Wonderfully said, wasn't it'?
I love her so much.

95
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,270
She's my muse, my everything.

And the two of us really
are a glamorous pair.

97
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:53,144
A pair that leaves nothing to be desired,
to dream and harbor illusions about.

98
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,904
Isn't it?
- Yes.

Well, what do you want to know'?

I've heard you can
watch the shows directly

127
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,148
on your live-stream.
Tell me about that.

128
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,951
Well, figure it that way:
when someone is in a far away country,

129
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,540
or just not around here,
he can write us

130
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,062
what he wants, we provide
the victims, prepare everything.

131
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,383
Yeah, and then it begins and he can
watch from the other end of world.

132
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,986
Live.

133
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,301
Is it interactive, too'?
- Yes.

134
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,391
How's that working?
- Well, just so. With Chat.

135
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,750
Describe just what
it was like in the past.

136
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,105
We could just describe last time.
The customer sat right here

137
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:17,151
and whispered in my ear
and she got to do it all.

138
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,060
What she demanded
was really wicked,

139
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,019
but they're doing
pretty much everything.

140
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:26,024
We've got some freaks here.
- Some freaks alright.

141
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,383
The thing with the dick
lately was pretty bad, but...

142
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,423
They're all nuts. But we do it.
We've found our small niche.

143
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,389
Or the one with the baby.
- Oh god.

144
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,027
That wasn't on at all, but we
didn't want to go into that anyway.

145
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,948
We may not talk about
it that much anyway.

146
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,185
We need to be top secret...
Like in other businesses as well.

147
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,549
We just do it and are
not really allowed lo talk about it.

148
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,471
But in essence you can have
everything here you want. Everything.

149
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,107
And also elsewhere,
via Live chat. Live stream.

150
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,703
You'll sit at your PC and tell me
Hey, now off with his dick.

151
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,550
Balls off. I don't know.
- Everything.

152
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,823
It's getting quite crazy at the
moment. But we'll manage.

153
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,626
And we get lots of
request. Amazing.

154
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,626
Do you have a live stream
we could watch today?

155
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,388
We've got one, but you're not
really allowed to watch it.

156
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,185
But today we'll make
an exception, right'?

157
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,784
Yeah, fine, but of course
it will cost you. But it's generally

158
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:29,626
not allowed for newcomers
to watch, only when paid.

159
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,751
We've even got something
special. A Jesus-torture.

160
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,950
He'll get his eyes
sewn up. And his mouth.

161
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,784
I hope you can stand it,
it's not half bad.

162
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,984
For the rest...you'll see.

163
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,262
Okay, When will it be on'?
- 18 o'clock.

164
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,141
We're looking forward to it
- Meanwhile, we'll prepare.

165
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,462
It's something special for sure.
I mean, throat cuts,

166
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,026
castrations and all that
are already well known.

167
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,545
And it's become
boring by now.

168
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,500
We enjoy when something
special happens from time to time.

169
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,027
For you it's surely something

in this, we'll do anything.

Just prepare yourself. We
won't need preparations for this.

172
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,225
Not really.
- Well then...

173
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,309
That's all?
- Yes. - Okay, cool.

174
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,191

- Yes, sure.

Is anybody there?

188
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,507
Hello?

We've seen better than that!

200
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,905
Yeah, it took some time, didn't it?
- Yes.

201
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,070
What's wrong?

202
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,704
My, just lake a look at me!

203
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,869
I'm not like you. Just look.
Something is missing.

204
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:04,947
Something very important is missing
- But you've got me.

205
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:11,149
Yes. And that's good. At least
one of us is perfect then.

206
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,743
Just look at you, how beautiful
you are. You are so wonderful.

You are a gorgeous
woman and I am not.

208
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,869
I'm not, my dear.
I want to be like you. Oh yes.

209
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,830
Oh no.

210

211
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,460

Yes, the variety is somewhat sparse today.

215
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:48,381
Yesterday evening we had
a Chinese family in here.

216
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,749
They wanted stew. That took a
considerate amount of our goods.

217
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,942
Okay, I see.

218
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,311
Why I do that?

219
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,270
Because I can afford it!

220
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,583
Because I already own everything you can own,
because I already experienced

221
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:16,350
what you could experience...

222
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,542
I'd say skydiving doesn't
attract me any more.

223
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,268
That is fun when you're 13!

224
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,549
But I'm missing the kick there.

225
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,226

Thank you.

00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,942
I'd say you get dressed

229
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,461
while we prepare everything.
You chose the cage.

230
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,424
Oh, good choice. We
had much fun in there.

231
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,985
I'm looking forward to it, loo.

232
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:51,944
You little cunt. We will play a
little now. In the cage.

233
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,387
You'll have fun. Come.

234
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,223
Bungee-Jumping bores me.

235
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,861
Man is always looking
for new challenges

236
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,107
and I take this for one!

237
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,311
The feeling of dead human
meat in your hands,

238
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,703
which you've slain yourself,
is what I want to feel.

239
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,263

240
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,464

I love saleswomen and kids.

242
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,942
For me that's something
that just doesn't figure.

243
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,191
I'm one of the good guys.

244
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,824
I'll give you a treat.

245
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,102
I will spare you each and every
embarrassing moment

246
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,629
in your screwed up life
in which you'd have to tell your kids:

247
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,419
"I'm sorry my dear, but we
haven't got any coke at home."

248
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,583
Or: "No, there's no caviar for you."

249
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,711
Although it might have felt like this.

250
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,662
Your kids will thank me
for it. Sooner or later.

251
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,341
You're still peeing yourself
now'? That's disgusting.

252
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:16,070
I could also go to war.

253
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,221
But I could gel dirty then.

254
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,986

255
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,306

258
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,547
What about it?

259
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,789
Why did the weirdo last night
only pay 18 instead of 20?

260
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,388
Because Monsieur
granted him a discount!

261
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,070
He didn't tell me anything about that!

262
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,029
He's got his secrets, loo!

263
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,981

264
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,981

hat from last Halloween.

Yes.
- For the rest vinyl clothing, right'?

297
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,151
Yes, great.

No.

and he can't pay the bill?

stick to the Halloween theme!

slowly electrocuting him

some music when cutting

316

One hour'? We'll have
to hurry up then.

320

Depends.

338
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:35,711
But it's significantly more than
a live show here in our house.

something that lasts after all.

at retail or wherever.
