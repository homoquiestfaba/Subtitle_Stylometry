1
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,077
Evelyn, did Jesus
have a big sister?

2
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:05,247
No, Dermot, he didn't.
He wasn't as lucky as you.

3
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:09,044
He had two daddies, though.
God the Father and Joseph the carpenter.

4
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,297
Did Joseph ever do a bit of painting
and decorating like my dad?

5
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:21,639
Evelyn, you take the boys home.
I'll go find your mother.

6
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:23,348
- All right, Dad.
- Good girl.

7
00:03:07,724 --> 00:03:08,851
I want the big one.

8
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:11,686
The big one's mine.
I'm the biggest. Come on.

9
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:14,856
I told you I was just going to
the pub for a Christmas drink.

10
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,357
Why kick up such a fuss?

11
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:19,526
Who was he? You were all
over him like a bloody rash.

12
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:20,777
Don't be stupid.

13
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:22,905
Sounds like Mommy
and Daddy are back.

14
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:25,074
Right in front of
all our friends, too.

15
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:28,910
Jesus.

16
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:30,704
You frozen little mites.

17
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:32,372
Come here, now.

18
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:35,750
We were arguing if the chimney
was wide enough for Santa.

19
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:39,420
It's great we're on the top floor so
Santa can park his reindeers, and that.

20
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:42,674
It is. He's got the whole roof to land on.
Say goodnight to Mommy.

21
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:44,301
When will Santa be here?

22
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:46,261
Santa's gonna be here very soon.

23
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,304
Off to bed with the lot of you.

24
00:03:48,387 --> 00:03:51,599
- Santa will come when you're asleep.
- I won't be able to sleep.

25
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:54,935
You will, love. Take your jumper
and boots off. Not up on the bed.

26
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,853
- You all right?
- Yes, Daddy.

27
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,564
Okay. All right.
Night-night.

28
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:16,330
Daddy, where's the carriages?

29
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,629
Son, Santa was a bit
strapped for cash this year.

30
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:26,340
It costs a lot of money
to feed those elves.

31
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:28,759
How much do they cost?

32
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,178
It costs lots and lots.

33
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:33,305
Happy Christmas.

34
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:34,555
Granddad!

35
00:04:38,602 --> 00:04:42,731
My little Christmas angel.
I hope you were a good girl. Were you?

36
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:45,608
- There's Granddad.
- Happy Christmas, everybody!

37
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:51,572
All right. Look at what
you've got there.

38
00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:53,657
Thanks, Granddad!

39
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:55,575
Granddad!

40
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:15,512
No money, no job.

41
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:17,722
Happy Christmas.

42
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:22,560
Look on the bright side, son.

43
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,646
Come the New Year,
you'll have a new job.

44
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,149
You and the kids will be set up.
The world will be your oyster.

45
00:05:29,525 --> 00:05:31,568
We never died a winter yet.

46
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,199
<i>Oh, of all the money</i>

47
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:40,243
<i>that ever I earned</i>

48
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,747
<i>I spent it in good company</i>

49
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:49,293
<i>And all the harm
that ever I done</i>

50
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,007
Heidi, we're going
to see Angela.

51
00:05:55,383 --> 00:05:56,676
She's my best friend.

52
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:01,013
She has a dolly, too.

53
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:03,557
I'm sure she'd
like to meet you.

54
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:07,768
Mommy's going shopping, Heidi.

55
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:10,897
Do you like her nice
new shoes and coat?

56
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:15,152
But this is St. Stephen's Day.

57
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:18,988
Mommy, come back, it's St. Stephen's Day.
The shops are shut!

58
00:06:58,192 --> 00:06:59,777
Daddy!

59
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,988
Be quiet.

60
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:04,614
- Daddy!
- What?

61
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:09,453
Mommy's gone. She was all dressed up
when she went away with a man in a car.

62
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:24,967
Jesus, don't let me down now.
Come on.

63
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,933
She's your daughter. You say you
don't know where she's gone?

64
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:34,226
She's your wife,
and you don't know, do you?

65
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,812
I always said this
would end in tears.

66
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:39,690
Should never have got stuck
with a corner boy like you.

67
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:41,108
Who's her fancy man?

68
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:43,985
Is it the bastard I saw
her with in the pub?

69
00:07:44,987 --> 00:07:47,698
- Your language is appalling.
- Your bloody...

70
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:50,033
Your bloody daughter is appalling.

71
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:53,411
I hope you don't use language like
that in front of your daughter.

72
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:55,955
Don't tell me how to bring
up my own daughter.

73
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:58,457
You obviously know
sweet F.A. about it.

74
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:00,500
Where did she meet him?
In the pub?

75
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,298
No, you're the one who spends all his time
there. No wonder she got sick of you.

76
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:07,425
- I treated her well.
- Yeah?

77
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:11,469
I never raised a hand in anger to her once,
though she gave me just cause for it.

78
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,263
Maybe that's where I went wrong.

79
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:40,914
Here you are, love.

80
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:42,416
Hot milk.

81
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:44,835
Christmas pudding.

82
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,255
You want some of this?

83
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:51,341
It's very nice.

84
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:53,635
No.

85
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:56,678
Why not?
You must be starving.

86
00:08:58,096 --> 00:08:59,640
She made it.

87
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,482
Maurice, give him the ball back.

88
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,364
I hear her fancy man is English.

89
00:09:59,739 --> 00:10:02,200
Bastard.
I might have guessed.

90
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,993
Good day, gentlemen.

91
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:06,412
I'm Inspector Logan of the SPCC.

92
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:10,082
Mrs. Daisley, your mother-in-law,
I believe, told us of your plight.

93
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:11,749
The SPCC?

94
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:16,005
The Society for Prevention
of Cruelty to Children?

95
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:17,089
That's correct.

96
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:19,550
Is she saying that I've
been cruel to my kids?

97
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,217
Not at all, Mr. Doyle.

98
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,095
We only have the children's
welfare at heart.

99
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:27,223
To lose their mother at this age
can have a traumatizing effect.

100
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:28,933
How's that any business of yours?

101
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:30,435
I'm here to help you.

102
00:10:30,726 --> 00:10:33,228
I understand you've no income
to support your family.

103
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:34,314
- Correct?
- Yeah.

104
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:36,608
Do you have any female
relatives to call upon?

105
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:39,819
Maureen.
Des' mother, died a long time ago.

106
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,073
Then, Mr. Doyle, you have no choice but
to approach the authorities for assistance.

107
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:47,367
I will arrange for the Sisters to call.

108
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:49,161
We don't need your charity.

109
00:10:49,244 --> 00:10:51,913
You have no job and no
mother for your children.

110
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:54,708
He's right, son.

111
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:00,630
All right.

112
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:03,382
Send in the nuns.

113
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:16,145
Sit still.

114
00:11:17,063 --> 00:11:18,605
But I don't like cabbage.

115
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:22,442
It is very good for you. Eat it up.
I don't want to hear about it.

116
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:31,409
You are a painter and decorator by trade,
but your attempts to secure employment...

117
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:33,954
since your wife's departure
have been unsuccessful.

118
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:35,664
Yes, sir.
Your Honor.

119
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:38,541
But it's only been
a couple of weeks.

120
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:42,044
And there's a big job coming up
at the Robert West House...

121
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,005
but that's not until
the end of March.

122
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:47,257
And you have no other
source of revenue?

123
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,469
Sir, my father, Henry,
who's sitting here, and myself...

124
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:53,389
we're setting up a
tour of the Dublin pubs.

125
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,891
Surely that will represent
expenditure rather than income.

126
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,142
No, Your Honor.

127
00:11:58,226 --> 00:12:00,562
We'll be playing music for money.

128
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,690
My father was a
professional musician.

129
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:07,068
He played for Radio Eireann
until retirement age.

130
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:09,404
Dessie has a fine voice, Your Honor.

131
00:12:09,988 --> 00:12:11,114
I'm sure he has.

132
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:15,159
But you won't be able to support
your family on that alone, will you?

133
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:19,454
Maybe not, Your Honor.

134
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:33,050
Under Section 10 of
the Children's Act, 1941...

135
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:37,680
I hereby rule that until there
is a significant improvement...

136
00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:41,726
in the domestic and financial
circumstances of Desmond Doyle...

137
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:45,855
his two sons,
Dermot and Maurice...

138
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:49,734
will be placed in care of the
Christian Brothers in Kilkenny...

139
00:12:49,817 --> 00:12:52,861
and his daughter, Evelyn Doyle...

140
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,199
will be committed to
St. Joseph's School in Dublin.

141
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:01,535
And I hope you don't have to
leave them in care for too long.

142
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:10,461
Daddy!

143
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:15,341
Come here.
Come sit down.

144
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:18,219
- I wanna go home.
- I know you wanna go home.

145
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:21,054
We're gonna go home soon.
Listen.

146
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:24,099
I love you very much.
You must understand that.

147
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:04,179
Granddad, there's St. Joseph,
Jesus' daddy!

148
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:08,432
I'll pray to him to get us home.
He'll understand.

149
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:10,977
That's right, love,
he'll understand.

150
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,916
Mr. Doyle, I'm Brother Eustace.

151
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,327
Look at the rays.

152
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,790
- Do you know what these are?
- No, Granddad.

153
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,167
Angel rays.

154
00:15:19,834 --> 00:15:22,127
- Angel rays?
- Yes.

155
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:27,508
These mean that your guardian angel is
reminding you that he's waiting to help you.

156
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,135
All you have to
do is believe in him.

157
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:34,056
Angel rays.

158
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,020
Look, pet, your favorites.

159
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:43,564
He's helping you already.

160
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:48,444
Granddad, please
don't leave me here.

161
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:51,948
I don't want to stay here with
the Sisters. I hate them!

162
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:54,992
They're the Brides of Christ.

163
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:57,453
Then why do they wear black,
horrible dresses?

164
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:59,788
Brides should wear
white dresses!

165
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:03,041
What's going on?
Have you been bold, young lady?

166
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,753
It's all right. I just dropped
a tube of fruit gums.

167
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:09,046
- Come along, now.
- No.

168
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:12,467
Granddad, please don't go.

169
00:16:12,968 --> 00:16:15,095
- Let go, now.
- Let go of me!

170
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:16,471
Please, Granddad!

171
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,934
Please be a good girl for the Sisters.
I'll come back and see you soon.

172
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:23,811
Disgraceful performance.

173
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:26,480
We'll teach you some
manners in here.

174
00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:30,401
We'll get you cleaned up,
you dirty little tinker.

175
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:32,528
Mr. Doyle.

176
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:40,702
Sister,
please don't cut her hair.

177
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:43,246
It's her father's pride and joy.

178
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:00,387
Thank you, Sister Brigid.
I'm sure we'll manage fine.

179
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:04,183
One large nun should be enough
to scrub one small girl.

180
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:05,766
Of course, Sister Felicity.

181
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,687
I was just making sure she
didn't throw another tantrum.

182
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:10,314
She's a willful one.

183
00:17:10,522 --> 00:17:12,858
Wasn't our Lord
a willful one, too?

184
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:15,610
I'm sure she'll be fine.
Won't you?

185
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:20,239
Thank you, Sister Brigid.

186
00:17:23,034 --> 00:17:24,576
Don't look so worried.

187
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,663
This is standard procedure
for new girls.

188
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:32,376
Otherwise, the place would be jumping
with lice and fleas and God knows what.

189
00:17:33,044 --> 00:17:35,003
Come on,
take your clothes off.

190
00:17:37,464 --> 00:17:39,007
Don't be shy.

191
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:40,675
After all...

192
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:44,179
bare-naked is how God
created Adam and Eve.

193
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:47,766
It's how he sent the
Baby Jesus into the world.

194
00:17:49,893 --> 00:17:51,019
Good.

195
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:54,563
We'll have you squeaky
clean in no time at all.

196
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:58,150
Come on, sit down.

197
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:00,194
Shoes.

198
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,990
You can call me Felicity.

199
00:18:06,575 --> 00:18:07,701
What's your name?

200
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:09,787
Evelyn Doyle.

201
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:11,663
Pleased to meet you.

202
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:14,499
Pleased to meet you,
Sister Felicity.

203
00:18:22,423 --> 00:18:23,800
Good afternoon, ladies.

204
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:26,886
Could you spare a few pence for
the poor black babies of Africa?

205
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,639
- Here you are.
- It's a very good cause.

206
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:32,599
Thanks, God bless you.
You're very generous.

207
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:35,561
- Give us another pint, please.
- You've had enough.

208
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:37,104
Listen to you...

209
00:18:37,187 --> 00:18:39,397
I'm sick of people
telling me what to do.

210
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:42,651
You just get us another pint.

211
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:44,987
Fine.

212
00:18:45,612 --> 00:18:48,531
- Just a few pennies from you, there?
- There you go, Father.

213
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:52,076
Those little orphans,
they really need your charity.

214
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:54,287
Father...

215
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:59,000
you lot have taken my babies!
You've made my babies orphans.

216
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:07,382
Fair play to you.

217
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:10,594
That's a great right cross
you have on you there.

218
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:13,430
Right, here we are.

219
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,315
Quiet!
Too much talking.

220
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:25,233
Just down here, love.

221
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:29,820
Down you sit.

222
00:19:30,654 --> 00:19:33,199
Don't let my teeth fool you.
I don't bite.

223
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:36,117
She's a sweetheart,
that Sister Felicity.

224
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:39,789
It's Frigid Brigid you've
got to watch out for.

225
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:43,459
She could put the fear of death
into a corpse, so she could.

226
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,336
I'm Mary.

227
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:48,505
- I'm Annette.
- I'm Lauren.

228
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:49,714
I'm Evelyn.

229
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,635
- Your soup doesn't look very good.
- You'll get used to it.

230
00:19:53,718 --> 00:19:58,139
You get used to most things here.
Half the kids in Ireland are cooped up here.

231
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:00,975
How long have
you been here for?

232
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,103
- Six months?
- Six years.

233
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:10,192
I won't be here for long.
My daddy's gonna come and get me.

234
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,236
That's what my dad told me.

235
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:21,370
I'm sorry, Desmond.

236
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:24,497
I was the seminary
boxing champion.

237
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,541
- Really?
- Let that be a lesson to you.

238
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:29,752
Never underestimate the strength
of the Church militant.

239
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:32,797
- God bless.
- Thanks, Father.

240
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:38,386
If you want your kids back that badly,
you should get a good lawyer.

241
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:40,888
They cost money.

242
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:43,557
Go and see Michael Beattie.

243
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,392
Twenty-four Upper Mount Street.

244
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:47,561
- Say I sent you.
- Fair enough.

245
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:51,690
I'll say the new barmaid at Fergal's
Pub sent me. That'll impress him.

246
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:54,693
Tell him Bernadette sent you,
you cheeky oaf.

247
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,654
Bernadette Beattie,
his little sister.

248
00:20:57,737 --> 00:21:00,197
I'm working here part-time
to help Uncle Fergal.

249
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:01,949
I'm a trainee chemist, actually.

250
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:05,161
So, you're the beautiful niece
Fergal's always bragging about.

251
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:08,038
I bet you have lots of
fellows running after you.

252
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:12,376
Yes. But none of them have
managed to catch me yet.

253
00:21:13,294 --> 00:21:16,172
You're not a bad-looking woman,
now that I look at you.

254
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,008
Of course, with this bump on my head,
I'm probably hallucinating.

255
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,223
Bless you, John.

256
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:33,188
Once again, until we
achieve unity and harmony.

257
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:35,273
Where do we say
our night prayers?

258
00:21:35,356 --> 00:21:37,108
Not in the bed...

259
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:40,652
not under the bed,
but by the bed.

260
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:43,697
Then kneel by your
beds and give thanks.

261
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:54,583
Get a move on, Evelyn.
You're keeping us all waiting.

262
00:22:05,218 --> 00:22:08,805
We do not lie like that, on our stomach.
It tempts the Devil.

263
00:22:09,347 --> 00:22:12,433
We lie on our back and
cross our arms like this.

264
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:16,186
I will check every night that
you are sleeping in this position.

265
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,105
We must not tempt Lucifer.

266
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:25,153
No more talking.
Good night, girls.

267
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:26,696
Good night, Sister.

268
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:32,202
Mr. Doyle, family law
in this jurisdiction...

269
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:36,664
is a cozy conspiracy between the
Catholic Church and the Irish State.

270
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,666
They're in cahoots.

271
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:45,172
You're saying that you're all frightened if
you take them on, you'll never work again.

272
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:46,966
Something like that.

273
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:52,304
I suggest you come back to me when
your circumstances are more favorable...

274
00:22:52,346 --> 00:22:54,222
and I'll see what I can do.

275
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:58,560
<i>On the banks of the roses,
my love and I sat down</i>

276
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:02,522
<i>And I took out my fiddle,
for to play my love a tune</i>

277
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:07,318
<i>In the middle of the tune
she sighed and she said</i>

278
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:11,239
<i>"Oh, Johnny, lovely Johnny,
why'd you leave me?"</i>

279
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:19,079
<i>Oh, when I was a young man,
I heard my father say</i>

280
00:23:19,163 --> 00:23:22,958
<i>That he'd rather see me dead
and buried in the clay</i>

281
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:26,712
<i>Sooner than be married
to any runaway</i>

282
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:30,590
<i>On the lovely sweet
banks of the roses</i>

283
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:34,469
<i>On the banks of the roses,
my love and I sat down</i>

284
00:23:34,552 --> 00:23:38,347
<i>And I took out my fiddle,
for to play my love a tune</i>

285
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:43,144
<i>In the middle of the tune
she sighed and she said</i>

286
00:23:43,227 --> 00:23:47,023
<i>"Oh, Johnny, lovely Johnny,
why'd you leave me?"</i>

287
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:53,153
"Oh, Lord, I vow never
more to offend thee...

288
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,615
"and carefully to avoid
the occasions of sin. "

289
00:23:57,073 --> 00:23:58,575
<i>...and the meadows they are gay</i>

290
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,829
<i>And me and my true love
will sit and sport and play</i>

291
00:24:05,248 --> 00:24:08,918
<i>On the lovely sweet
banks of the roses</i>

292
00:24:09,043 --> 00:24:12,838
<i>On the banks of the roses,
my love and I sat down</i>

293
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:16,634
<i>And I took out my fiddle,
for to play my love a tune</i>

294
00:24:16,675 --> 00:24:18,803
<i>In the middle of the tune</i>

295
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:21,388
- Look who's back.
- Straight from Chicago.

296
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:23,140
How's my favorite Irish colleen?

297
00:24:23,224 --> 00:24:25,434
- I'm well. How are you?
- I'm great.

298
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:40,782
Who's your man in the
sharp suit, over there?

299
00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:42,117
How should I know?

300
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:44,452
He looks like a Yank.

301
00:24:44,536 --> 00:24:47,955
Maybe he's a friend of hers.
Maybe he's a chemist.

302
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:52,876
If I can regain your
attention for a moment...

303
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,169
we'll have requests.

304
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:57,256
Apart from Nobody's Child.
We're not fond of that now.

305
00:24:57,297 --> 00:25:00,425
- Boys of Wexford.
- Whistling Gypsies.

306
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:07,765
- Are you still not talking to Grandma?
- No, I'll never speak to that woman.

307
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:10,435
She blames your father
for everything.

308
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:13,354
May she rot in Hell,
the old witch.

309
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:18,651
Jesus says we should forgive
those who trespassed against us.

310
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,194
It's in the "Our Father. "

311
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,786
- Grandma, would you like
a fruit gum? - Thanks, love.

312
00:25:30,745 --> 00:25:32,206
Granddad gave them to me.

313
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:36,209
I won't bother then, love.

314
00:25:36,626 --> 00:25:39,588
Listen, love, there is
something you must tell him.

315
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,258
It's really warm.

316
00:25:45,843 --> 00:25:47,386
...stuff it, will you?

317
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:49,054
Good girl.

318
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:53,517
Grandma's got a
letter from Sydney.

319
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:54,602
Sidney, who?

320
00:25:54,643 --> 00:25:56,645
Sydney in Australia.

321
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:59,940
- Australia?
- It's from Mommy, she's in Australia.

322
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:03,359
She didn't give her address,
but it said Sydney on the postmark thing.

323
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:04,652
I might have guessed.

324
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:07,405
She always had the wanderlust,
your mother.

325
00:26:07,739 --> 00:26:10,492
- Grandma said it's hot in Australia.
- It is.

326
00:26:11,576 --> 00:26:16,289
You can tell her it's not as hot as the
place where her daughter will end up.

327
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:18,458
Okay.

328
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:22,961
- That's it.
- Still no carriages, Dad.

329
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:24,630
No, son.

330
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:27,341
Still no carriages.

331
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:32,763
"Dear Daddy, it's great news that you have
such a good job, doing up that old house.

332
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:37,976
"I miss you and the boys
and Granddad very much...

333
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,812
"and I hope we can get
back together soon.

334
00:26:42,355 --> 00:26:45,566
"What did Granddad mean when he
told me to tell Grandma Daisley...

335
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,820
"that he hopes Mommy meets
a great white in Australia?

336
00:26:49,362 --> 00:26:52,698
"I think it's a kangaroo,
but Mary thinks it's a koala bear.

337
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:56,744
"I like most of the nuns here.

338
00:26:57,369 --> 00:26:59,830
"Sister Felicity is nice and kind...

339
00:26:59,913 --> 00:27:01,373
"and so is Sister Theresa.

340
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:04,793
"But Sister Brigid is very scary. "

341
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:08,672
Is God good, just and merciful?

342
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:11,216
Yes, Sister.

343
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:14,177
"Yes" isn't the catechism answer, is it?

344
00:27:15,762 --> 00:27:17,596
What does the catechism say?

345
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,474
It says...

346
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,855
I've had enough of you,
Annette Farrell.

347
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,522
Now...

348
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:29,316
God is infinitely good...

349
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,777
infinitely just...

350
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:33,564
- and infinitely...
- No!

351
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,033
What are you
saying to me, child?

352
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,995
I don't think you
should do that, Sister.

353
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:46,458
If God is infinitely merciful,
he wouldn't want you to do that.

354
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,002
You dare to question
me about God?

355
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,088
Insolent brat!

356
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,672
Right, outside.

357
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,005
Outside!

358
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:03,223
Never...

359
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:07,102
never talk to me like that again!

360
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:47,599
Where's my daughter, Evelyn Doyle?

361
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,142
Do you have an appointment?

362
00:28:49,184 --> 00:28:51,644
I don't need an appointment
to see my own daughter.

363
00:28:51,727 --> 00:28:54,063
- Who are you?
- I'm Sister Brigid.

364
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:55,523
Are you?

365
00:28:57,191 --> 00:29:00,027
If you ever lay a finger
on my daughter again...

366
00:29:00,194 --> 00:29:01,695
I will tear you...

367
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:03,989
limb from limb.

368
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:06,492
Now, where is she?

369
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:10,537
In the refectory,
on the first floor.

370
00:29:11,496 --> 00:29:12,664
Right.

371
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:21,005
- You shouldn't be on the premises.
- I've come for my daughter.

372
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:23,341
- You must leave.
- I'm not leaving without her.

373
00:29:23,383 --> 00:29:27,220
- You know that's impossible.
- I'm having her back. Where is she?

374
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:29,513
You cannot barge in here...

375
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:32,891
There's no bloody laws in Ireland
that will keep her away from me.

376
00:29:32,975 --> 00:29:36,271
How dare you use language
like that in front of me.

377
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:38,564
Don't speak to me like that.
I will not have it.

378
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:42,151
Daddy! Don't fight.
Don't fight with Sister Theresa!

379
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:46,071
It's all right, love.
Don't worry.

380
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:49,532
Can I see her?

381
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:53,035
Not if you're going
to run off with her.

382
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:55,038
That'll just get you arrested.

383
00:29:55,205 --> 00:29:57,206
Okay, I promise.

384
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:01,335
I just wanna hold
her for a second.

385
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:04,505
I give you my word, all right?

386
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,761
Evelyn, your daddy's
here to see you.

387
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,683
It's good to see you.

388
00:30:16,808 --> 00:30:19,352
Daddy, have you come
to take me home?

389
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:24,064
Yes.

390
00:30:25,232 --> 00:30:27,568
I'll be taking you home soon, pet.

391
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:32,032
Very soon.

392
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,129
I hear you're doing
well at your new job.

393
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:51,258
My circumstances have improved,
as you would say.

394
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:54,052
So, you'll take the case, then?

395
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,057
You've been drinking, haven't you?
I can smell it off your breath.

396
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:02,768
Since we're not planning on kissing,
I don't see a problem.

397
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:04,770
It's not going to help our case...

398
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:08,148
if the court thinks you're
drinking your pay packet.

399
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,776
Our case?

400
00:31:10,943 --> 00:31:12,569
That means you'll take it, then?

401
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:15,447
Who is this gobshite?

402
00:31:15,531 --> 00:31:18,117
This "gobshite"
is the Minister for Education.

403
00:31:18,158 --> 00:31:22,328
He's claiming we require the consent
of your wife for the release of your kids.

404
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:25,873
How can we get her consent
when she's disappeared?

405
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:29,211
Even her pudding-faced old
mother's got no address.

406
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,213
It's the law.
Yours is a unique case.

407
00:31:32,296 --> 00:31:34,507
Normally,
the wife would be deceased.

408
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,927
She ran out on her kids.
What kind of mother would do that?

409
00:31:37,969 --> 00:31:42,305
We could argue that she's emotionally
incapable of bringing up the children...

410
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:45,684
but I'm afraid all of that is,
strictly speaking, irrelevant.

411
00:31:45,725 --> 00:31:47,728
The law still requires her consent...

412
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:50,480
no matter how irresponsibly
she may have behaved.

413
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:52,649
To hell with the law.

414
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:56,194
That attitude will get
us nowhere, Desmond.

415
00:31:58,446 --> 00:32:01,115
I've done everything
I was asked to do.

416
00:32:01,198 --> 00:32:05,244
That District Judge or Justice didn't
tell me I'd need my wife's consent.

417
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:09,582
He definitely misdirected you,
which gives us a useful basis for a start.

418
00:32:09,665 --> 00:32:11,834
But it may not be
material enough...

419
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:15,588
for a challenge in law, as there
are no precedents for your case.

420
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,923
We'll make the bloody precedent!
I want justice!

421
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:23,052
The law and justice are
two entirely different things.

422
00:32:23,136 --> 00:32:25,347
Jesus.
You can say that again.

423
00:32:25,765 --> 00:32:27,932
Of course, I'm only a solicitor.

424
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:30,977
I'm not entitled to speak
in a court case like this.

425
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:33,730
We need a barrister.
And they're very expensive.

426
00:32:33,772 --> 00:32:35,773
I don't care how much it costs.

427
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:38,484
I'll work round the clock,
if I have to.

428
00:32:39,902 --> 00:32:42,864
To fight Church and State
is to fight Goliath.

429
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:49,036
David beat Goliath,
in the book I read.

430
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:56,709
- It's a first edition.
- Is it?

431
00:32:56,793 --> 00:32:57,752
Yeats.

432
00:32:57,835 --> 00:33:00,755
It'll be grand, I tell you.
I've got it all worked out, Dad.

433
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:02,800
Don't worry about it.

434
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:11,557
- Get us another pint.
- You'll have another one?

435
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:13,183
I will.

436
00:33:13,642 --> 00:33:16,186
Make mine a large one, Bernadette.
A pint for Desmond.

437
00:33:16,478 --> 00:33:18,271
You two are knocking
them back tonight.

438
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:20,858
Poor Dessie's going through
a rough time lately.

439
00:33:20,942 --> 00:33:22,400
Aren't we all fond of a drink?

440
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:26,196
That's right, Henry. You can't
hold that against a man, can you?

441
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:28,782
That lad of yours is
going through hell.

442
00:33:28,865 --> 00:33:31,992
- I think he's drinking to forget.
- You're right, Fergal.

443
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:36,580
I wonder if our American friend knows
the one thing worse than drinking to forget.

444
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:40,460
- Do you know what that is, son?
- Worse than drinking to forget? No.

445
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:42,211
Forgetting to drink.

446
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:44,296
I'll drink to that.

447
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,716
That wife of his didn't know
the meaning of the word "love. "

448
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,884
Love.

449
00:33:48,968 --> 00:33:52,303
It's strange. The Greeks have
all these different words for love.

450
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:55,181
"Philia," "agapi," "eros. "
We have just the one.

451
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:57,810
We use the same word for
our nearest and dearest...

452
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:00,228
as we do for a
packet of cigarettes.

453
00:34:00,437 --> 00:34:03,481
- It's interesting, isn't it?
- I think it's very interesting.

454
00:34:03,565 --> 00:34:07,026
Did you know that Eskimos have
over 40 different words for snow?

455
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,611
- Is that a fact?
- It's true. The wife told me that.

456
00:34:09,695 --> 00:34:11,947
She should know.
She's frigid.

457
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,408
You're an awful man.

458
00:34:19,455 --> 00:34:23,459
- I keep telling you not to drink and drive.
- I'm not drinking and driving.

459
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,544
I drank before I drove.

460
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,631
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- It's the only way, Dad.

461
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:32,467
It's the only way.

462
00:34:52,235 --> 00:34:56,074
- I can see the dormitory, there.
- We should come back some other time.

463
00:34:56,156 --> 00:34:58,992
No. I've got to rescue
the poor little mite.

464
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:01,161
Right, we've come this far.

465
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,040
Jesus.

466
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:07,708
They've greased the top of the wall.

467
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:09,293
Mind yourself, son.

468
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,034
Bernadette!

469
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,869
You're drenched!

470
00:35:45,953 --> 00:35:47,246
That'll be the rain.

471
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:48,956
You're one to talk.

472
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,418
I just...

473
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:53,836
Come in.

474
00:35:57,089 --> 00:35:59,842
- Sit yourself down.
- It's okay. I'm not staying.

475
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,218
All right. Suit yourself.

476
00:36:02,844 --> 00:36:05,179
I'll get you a towel. A clean one.

477
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:09,351
This place needs a good cleaning.
It's got more empties than Fergal's.

478
00:36:13,813 --> 00:36:16,232
Looking for a towel here somewhere. God.

479
00:36:21,111 --> 00:36:22,738
Here we go.

480
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:34,207
There it is.

481
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:38,211
You can have it, if you want.

482
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:41,380
As a reward
for putting me in touch with your brother.

483
00:36:41,464 --> 00:36:43,257
I had no idea you could do this.

484
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:47,179
There's lots of things I can do
that you don't know about.

485
00:36:47,262 --> 00:36:48,971
I'm sure there are.

486
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,807
We're saving up for a housekeeper.

487
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:54,310
You know anyone who's suitable?

488
00:36:54,393 --> 00:36:57,646
It's not a housekeeper you need.
It's a barkeeper.

489
00:36:58,521 --> 00:37:00,148
You know what your problem is?

490
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:03,401
You think all you have to do is smile
with that cheeky twinkle...

491
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:06,238
and everything will be grand.
It's time you grew up.

492
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,699
- You like my cheeky twinkle, then?
- You drink too much!

493
00:37:09,783 --> 00:37:12,368
Ridiculous.
I've got a lot on my mind.

494
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:16,581
- Like a trip to Scotland
with your kids? - What?

495
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:20,751
How do you know about that?

496
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,961
Because the tickets
fell out of your coat.

497
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:26,673
An adult and three kids?
Who could that be, I wonder?

498
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:30,302
I knew you were up to something.
You big idiot.

499
00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:32,596
Don't call me a big idiot!

500
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,474
I'll bet you want someone smooth,
like the Yank.

501
00:37:37,183 --> 00:37:40,645
Whose jokes you laugh at all the time
like he's Oscar bloody Wilde.

502
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:44,525
Nick's funny. And he's more of a
ladies' man than Oscar ever was.

503
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:46,651
I get the message.

504
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:50,363
You fancy him.

505
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,158
Don't tell me who I fancy.
That's for me to decide.

506
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:56,868
What I don't want is a drunkard...

507
00:37:56,952 --> 00:38:00,997
who has some mad notion about
sneaking off with his kids to Scotland.

508
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:04,334
Why should you care?

509
00:38:04,876 --> 00:38:06,920
What business is it of yours?

510
00:38:09,256 --> 00:38:12,342
Because I don't want to
have to visit you in prison.

511
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:16,053
Has anybody ever told you
you're a fine woman?

512
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:20,350
Lots of men.
Some of them weren't even married.

513
00:38:29,525 --> 00:38:31,944
- Not until you give me the tickets.
- What?

514
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:36,072
Give me the ferry tickets. I'll take
them back and get you a refund.

515
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,574
Jesus, woman.

516
00:38:39,076 --> 00:38:41,911
You drive a hard bargain.
Where are they?

517
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:45,039
Here you go.

518
00:38:45,165 --> 00:38:48,251
- Thanks. - I always get
sick on the ferry, anyway.

519
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:54,214
- I just think, you know, you and I...
- Do you really think I'd kiss you now?

520
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:56,258
It'd be like kissing a soggy beer-mat.

521
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,804
- But you just said...
- No. I said you have to give up the drink.

522
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:02,514
For God's sake.
That's the hardest thing to do.

523
00:39:02,598 --> 00:39:05,976
The second hardest.
Getting your family back is the hardest.

524
00:39:13,274 --> 00:39:18,238
<i>Oh, of all the money
that ever I had</i>

525
00:39:18,363 --> 00:39:22,366
<i>I spent it in good company</i>

526
00:39:23,451 --> 00:39:27,538
<i>And all the harm
that ever I've done</i>

527
00:39:27,789 --> 00:39:31,833
<i>Alas it was to none but me</i>

528
00:39:32,834 --> 00:39:37,131
<i>And if I had money
enough to spend</i>

529
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:41,009
<i>And leisure time to sit awhile</i>

530
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:45,806
<i>There is a fair maid in this town</i>

531
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:50,810
<i>Who sorely has
my heart beguiled</i>

532
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:55,941
<i>Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips</i>

533
00:39:56,525 --> 00:40:00,736
<i>I own she has
my heart in thrall</i>

534
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:06,783
<i>So, fill to me the parting glass</i>

535
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:11,871
<i>Good night and joy
be with you all</i>

536
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:22,090
Good man, Des.

537
00:40:22,674 --> 00:40:24,884
Lovely. Good man.

538
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,846
Thank you very much, everyone.

539
00:40:29,138 --> 00:40:33,101
You've been wonderful. God bless you all.
We hope to see you again next week.

540
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:35,269
Okay. God bless. Good night.

541
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:39,815
Come on.

542
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,233
You all right?

543
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:43,277
Dessie, I...

544
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,988
Look at me. Are you okay? Dad, come on.

545
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:49,657
Jesus!

546
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,119
Dad. Someone get a doctor.

547
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,579
Here, Johnny!
Go and run for a doctor, quick!

548
00:40:54,662 --> 00:40:55,913
I'm here.

549
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:58,666
- Dessie.
- I'm here, Dad.

550
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:01,711
- The kids.
- We'll get them back.

551
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:03,211
You and I, together.

552
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,507
Dad.

553
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:13,889
Henry, it's Father O'Malley.

554
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,143
If you can hear me,
say the Act of Contrition.

555
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,455
Amen.

556
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,722
Look, angel rays.

557
00:42:00,766 --> 00:42:02,309
What's angel rays, love?

558
00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:05,271
It's Granddad letting us know
he's watching over us.

559
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,108
He's our guardian angel.

560
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:12,361
He told me all about angel rays.

561
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:16,990
Good old Dad.

562
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,700
I knew he wouldn't leave us.

563
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:37,926
- Good morning, Miss Gilhooly.
- Mr. Doyle.

564
00:42:37,968 --> 00:42:40,429
- Didn't you get the letter?
- What letter?

565
00:42:40,554 --> 00:42:42,557
The one canceling this appointment.

566
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,517
I didn't get any letter.

567
00:42:44,767 --> 00:42:47,352
I've taken this morning
especially off work to see him.

568
00:42:47,436 --> 00:42:50,814
This is my family we're talking about.
Where is he?

569
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,126
Jesus.

570
00:43:31,895 --> 00:43:33,687
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

571
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,214
Lilo! Higgi!
Come on!

572
00:44:00,798 --> 00:44:02,715
Sorry, sir.
It's a trespasser.

573
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:05,301
It's all right.
This is a client of mine.

574
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:07,428
- A client, sir?
- Yes!

575
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,972
We have an appointment!

576
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:14,351
Please let us know in the future, sir,
if you're expecting visitors.

577
00:44:18,606 --> 00:44:21,942
What the hell are you smirking at?
Do you think this is funny?

578
00:44:22,943 --> 00:44:26,196
Do you think you can cancel appointments
and treat people like dirt?

579
00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:28,782
- Mr. Doyle...
- I wasn't talking to you, Yank.

580
00:44:29,407 --> 00:44:32,368
All you're good for's wearing sharp suits,
doing fancy deals...

581
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,286
and trying to get
hands on our women.

582
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,957
- And our fish!
- Desmond, be reasonable.

583
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,208
I'm sorry I missed
our appointment...

584
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:42,545
but there's really nothing more
I can do for you anymore.

585
00:44:42,795 --> 00:44:43,879
Really?

586
00:44:44,255 --> 00:44:47,800
Your being sorry isn't gonna
get my kids back, now, is it?

587
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,302
I'm sure the Yank here
is having great fun...

588
00:44:51,594 --> 00:44:55,349
seeing what a lot of bloody spineless
jellyfish we've got over here.

589
00:44:55,725 --> 00:44:58,268
But ask yourself this, Mr. Big Shot.

590
00:44:59,352 --> 00:45:01,438
What if it was your family?

591
00:45:01,604 --> 00:45:04,607
Wouldn't you fight tooth
and nail to get them back?

592
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:08,444
Or are you just another
heartless, gutless bastard?

593
00:45:48,398 --> 00:45:51,903
Congratulations.
You just found yourself a lawyer.

594
00:45:52,278 --> 00:45:53,488
Is that a fact?

595
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:55,614
Who?

596
00:45:56,073 --> 00:45:57,115
Me.

597
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:00,327
So, you're not a chemist, then?

598
00:46:00,911 --> 00:46:03,537
How come you can work
over here if you're a Yank?

599
00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:05,790
Actually, I'm Irish.

600
00:46:05,873 --> 00:46:09,086
I was born and reared
in Kilkenny till I was 9.

601
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:12,797
Then we emigrated to the States
and I subsequently came back here...

602
00:46:12,838 --> 00:46:14,382
to study law at UCD.

603
00:46:14,465 --> 00:46:16,967
So, he's qualified to
plead in Irish courts.

604
00:46:17,385 --> 00:46:20,096
Does my being a
Yank bother you?

605
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:22,472
Not at all.
I like Yanks.

606
00:46:23,056 --> 00:46:25,809
Most of them were Irish
to begin with, anyway.

607
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,188
But I can't afford to
pay you fancy money.

608
00:46:29,647 --> 00:46:32,148
I'm not doing this for the money.

609
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:35,276
You'll just have to raise enough
to cover our costs.

610
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,987
Right.

611
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,990
I really appreciate
your help, so I do.

612
00:46:43,242 --> 00:46:44,785
We'll do our best for you.

613
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:46,621
- Right. Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

614
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:55,003
- We'll do our best?
- We're in this together, my friend.

615
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:57,881
Do you think I'll take this on
with any other solicitor?

616
00:46:57,923 --> 00:47:00,883
We have no chance.
I don't know why you're taking it on.

617
00:47:00,925 --> 00:47:04,930
Because I know what he's going through,
through no one's fault but my own.

618
00:47:05,013 --> 00:47:07,307
I lost my own kids in that divorce.

619
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:11,477
- You don't realize what we're up against.
- I do realize what we're up against.

620
00:47:13,563 --> 00:47:16,065
What possible chance
do you think you have?

621
00:47:16,107 --> 00:47:17,608
You and Mr...

622
00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:20,402
- Mr. Doyle.
- Mr. Doyle, here.

623
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:23,531
A painter and what?
Decorator?

624
00:47:24,615 --> 00:47:26,576
Master tradesman, to you.

625
00:47:27,951 --> 00:47:31,038
Apart from anything else,
it will be prohibitively expensive.

626
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:32,622
Only if we lose.

627
00:47:32,956 --> 00:47:35,292
- You'll lose, Mr...
- Beattie.

628
00:47:36,376 --> 00:47:40,046
You'll lose, because if you
were to win this case...

629
00:47:40,129 --> 00:47:43,300
the whole basis of family law
would be undermined.

630
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,428
And believe me, gentlemen,
that will not be allowed to happen.

631
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:50,056
We thank you for
your advice, Mr...

632
00:47:50,806 --> 00:47:52,099
Shall we?

633
00:48:00,273 --> 00:48:02,234
By the way, Minister...

634
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:05,487
your paintwork's shite.

635
00:48:07,155 --> 00:48:11,076
What we really need is an expert
in family law to keep us right.

636
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:13,328
- You know?
- I thought you were an expert.

637
00:48:13,536 --> 00:48:17,748
I haven't done family law in 20 years.
I've only a working knowledge.

638
00:48:18,457 --> 00:48:22,629
You mean you don't know what you're
talking about? Can't you read some books?

639
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:26,256
It's not quite as simple as that.
It's a very tricky area.

640
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,886
We've still got the problem that everyone's
terrified of taking on the Establishment.

641
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:34,806
What was the name of that guy
that lectured us about family law?

642
00:48:34,889 --> 00:48:37,225
- Remember? The real character.
- Tom Connolly.

643
00:48:37,308 --> 00:48:41,021
There was a Connolly who played rugby
for Ireland until his cartilage went.

644
00:48:41,105 --> 00:48:44,148
I think he did a bit of law in his
spare time. Would that be him?

645
00:48:45,483 --> 00:48:49,904
Gentlemen, I'm flattered by your attentions,
but I retired two years ago.

646
00:48:50,655 --> 00:48:54,282
In short, I can no longer
face speaking in court.

647
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:59,122
Sir, you wouldn't have to speak in court.
Mr. Barron here will do all the speaking.

648
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:02,165
But frankly, sir, he needs your help.

649
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,751
My family law is so rusty.

650
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:08,422
Even if you could just come
on board as a consultant.

651
00:49:09,923 --> 00:49:12,425
I'm sorry to say
this to you, Mr. Doyle.

652
00:49:13,968 --> 00:49:18,223
But they'll put forward the best people
to put the case for the State.

653
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:21,517
The best that money can buy.

654
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,894
That's why they hated me.

655
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:25,896
I wouldn't be bought.

656
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,442
I believe that if there is a God,
He'll step in to help us.

657
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:35,281
I'm touched by your faith.

658
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:41,995
This is the only Holy Spirit I've found
to be of any practical assistance.

659
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:44,622
Slainte.

660
00:49:51,003 --> 00:49:53,548
You were a big hero to me as a boy,
Mr. Connolly.

661
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:55,842
To my dad, too.

662
00:49:55,925 --> 00:49:59,136
He took me to all your games.
You see that photo there?

663
00:49:59,595 --> 00:50:02,681
I was at that game.
The one where you got injured.

664
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:05,225
That was the beginning of the end.

665
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:08,519
When that big brute of a
fullback did my cartilage in.

666
00:50:08,603 --> 00:50:11,272
He was English, of course.
The bastard.

667
00:50:12,024 --> 00:50:14,234
Still, before I left the field...

668
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:17,570
I managed to boot him where his balls
would have been, if he'd any.

669
00:50:17,653 --> 00:50:19,072
Fair play to you.

670
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:21,157
Anyway, lads...

671
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:24,243
your case is interesting.

672
00:50:25,078 --> 00:50:26,745
Hopeless, but interesting.

673
00:50:27,996 --> 00:50:29,998
You really think it's hopeless?

674
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:33,127
This case is what I used to call
"a real St. Jude. "

675
00:50:33,211 --> 00:50:34,712
Why St. Jude?

676
00:50:34,796 --> 00:50:38,590
Because St. Jude is the
patron saint of hopeless cases.

677
00:50:39,758 --> 00:50:43,970
As I recall, sir, you've won
quite a few St. Judes in your time.

678
00:50:46,472 --> 00:50:49,101
I suppose I have.

679
00:50:49,893 --> 00:50:54,064
Retirement must be excruciatingly
boring for a man like yourself.

680
00:51:10,454 --> 00:51:11,831
Gentlemen...

681
00:51:13,415 --> 00:51:15,083
I propose a toast.

682
00:51:16,668 --> 00:51:18,503
Justice and St. Jude.

683
00:51:23,465 --> 00:51:24,800
I am Desmond Doyle...

684
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:29,472
father of Evelyn Doyle, who's been held
in your care without my consent.

685
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,975
I request the return of
my daughter, forthwith.

686
00:51:33,517 --> 00:51:36,020
Mr. Doyle, you cannot
have your daughter.

687
00:51:38,355 --> 00:51:41,191
In that case, my solicitor,
Mr. Michael Beattie...

688
00:51:41,233 --> 00:51:43,776
will present you with a
writ of habeas corpus...

689
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,989
drafted by my counselor,
Mr. Nicholas Barron.

690
00:51:48,532 --> 00:51:50,075
Duly presented.

691
00:51:50,826 --> 00:51:52,201
Duly witnessed.

692
00:51:52,702 --> 00:51:55,204
Thank you, Sister.
That's all we need.

693
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,922
- So, it went well, then?
- It went like a dream.

694
00:52:05,006 --> 00:52:08,134
Desmond remembered all his lines,
and spoke them beautifully.

695
00:52:08,217 --> 00:52:10,344
Laurence Olivier had
better watch out.

696
00:52:10,385 --> 00:52:13,055
- You didn't attack a nun, then?
- I did not.

697
00:52:13,138 --> 00:52:15,390
I'm learning the rules of the game.

698
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,684
- What do we do now?
- We wait.

699
00:52:18,226 --> 00:52:20,978
No. That's just what
they want us to do.

700
00:52:22,104 --> 00:52:25,359
They'll do nothing for months
and hope that we'll go away.

701
00:52:26,234 --> 00:52:29,236
Nothing will happen
unless we force their hand.

702
00:52:29,987 --> 00:52:32,740
I'll give my old friend
Hugh Canning a ring.

703
00:52:32,823 --> 00:52:33,949
Hugh Canning?

704
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:36,952
- But he's a sports commentator.
- Mostly, yes.

705
00:52:38,703 --> 00:52:40,705
But he does a bit of everything.

706
00:52:49,255 --> 00:52:51,257
May God grant you justice.

707
00:52:53,593 --> 00:52:57,054
- Take this and run along, girl.
- Thank you, Sister.

708
00:53:01,768 --> 00:53:03,144
What is it?

709
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:06,855
- Eileen, come here.
- What's going on?

710
00:53:06,939 --> 00:53:11,068
"Desmond Doyle, a painter and decorator
from Fatima Mansions, Dublin...

711
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:14,738
"is a loving father who just wants
to spend time with his children...

712
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,240
"but the powers that
be won't let him.

713
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:20,285
"Desmond's rosy-cheeked
little daughter, Evelyn... "

714
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:28,793
At least they've set a date for
the hearing. That's the first step.

715
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:31,379
A little bit of gentle
pressure did the trick.

716
00:53:31,462 --> 00:53:34,381
We had to give the Minister
a kick up his fat ass.

717
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:36,550
What do we do now?

718
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,555
You should smarten yourself up.
The press might want photos of you.

719
00:53:41,848 --> 00:53:43,890
Try combing your hair, occasionally.

720
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:45,308
Shave.

721
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:48,339
Try to look as if you haven't
just fallen out of bed.

722
00:53:48,386 --> 00:53:50,527
Use me as a role model
if you want to.

723
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:53,482
And buy a new pair of shoes
before we get to court.

724
00:53:53,983 --> 00:53:55,484
- New shoes?
- Yes.

725
00:53:55,526 --> 00:53:59,573
I've known judges who judge a man's
character by the state of his shoes.

726
00:54:07,288 --> 00:54:10,875
- Here they come. Let's get a shot.
- Especially of the little girl.

727
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:13,835
- Come on.
- Get the three of them together, now.

728
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:18,424
- Daddy, I scored a goal in Gaelic!
- Daddy.

729
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:22,218
My loves! You look wonderful.

730
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:26,014
- Daddy, I like your new shoes.
- Thanks, Evelyn.

731
00:54:27,724 --> 00:54:32,144
Ferris hasn't changed much since I knew
him. The torn-faced old poultice.

732
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,940
He's always looked like the Turin Shroud.

733
00:54:36,775 --> 00:54:39,110
We used to call him "Ferris the Ferret. "

734
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:41,487
Which is an insult to the rodent.

735
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:45,616
Mr. Barron, you're representing
the petitioner, Desmond Doyle?

736
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,368
Yes, my lord.

737
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:52,331
We contend the judge at the District Court
hearing of January 10 of this year...

738
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:55,417
misdirected the petitioner,
Mr. Desmond Doyle.

739
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:00,672
I refer you to the notes of that case
wherein the judge expressed his hope...

740
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:05,051
that Mr. Doyle would not have to leave
his children in care for too long.

741
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:07,845
Sadly, that has not been the case here.

742
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:13,518
The Children's Act of 1941 clearly states...

743
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:17,729
that unless the spouse is deceased,
which is not the case here...

744
00:55:18,063 --> 00:55:21,316
then the consent
of both parents is required.

745
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,654
This is the basis of our case,
Your Lordship.

746
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,866
Provision of the Children's Act...

747
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:33,453
must be understood in its literal,
grammatical meaning.

748
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:37,039
"Both parents" means exactly that.

749
00:55:38,207 --> 00:55:41,293
I therefore find against the petitioner,
Desmond Doyle.

750
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:44,672
Thank you, Judge Hall.

751
00:55:44,922 --> 00:55:46,297
Judge McLaughlin?

752
00:55:46,464 --> 00:55:50,344
With some reluctance,
I conclude that I, too, must find against...

753
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,390
the petitioner's application
and uphold the Minister's decision.

754
00:55:56,307 --> 00:55:59,352
- We've lost.
- That's absolutely ridiculous!

755
00:55:59,769 --> 00:56:02,939
- Order in court!
- You rotten louses. Let his babies go home.

756
00:56:03,023 --> 00:56:05,607
Silence, or I shall have the court cleared.

757
00:56:05,691 --> 00:56:09,904
- Silence in court!
- He's loving this. The rodent.

758
00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:15,534
It is incontrovertible...

759
00:56:15,617 --> 00:56:20,164
that Section 10,
Subsection 1 of the Children's Act, 1941...

760
00:56:20,414 --> 00:56:23,416
requires the consent of both parents.

761
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:27,588
In the absence of such consent,
Evelyn Doyle and her brothers...

762
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:31,425
will remain in custody
until they are 16 years of age.

763
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:32,551
Daddy!

764
00:56:32,717 --> 00:56:35,136
Furthermore, this court has decided...

765
00:56:35,178 --> 00:56:39,599
that since the Children's Act
is capable of no other interpretation...

766
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:43,101
any appeal
would be a waste of the court's time.

767
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:46,606
Right of appeal is therefore denied.

768
00:56:46,898 --> 00:56:50,151
- No, you flea-faced rat!
- Who said that?

769
00:56:54,154 --> 00:56:55,781
Was that you, Connolly?

770
00:57:00,077 --> 00:57:03,538
This is Hugh Canning,
the man who broke the Doyle story...

771
00:57:03,622 --> 00:57:06,208
covering this sensational new development.

772
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:07,668
Leave them alone.

773
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:09,336
Get your hands off my kids!

774
00:57:10,045 --> 00:57:12,213
- Leave me alone!
- Daddy!

775
00:57:12,505 --> 00:57:15,174
Unbelievable scenes here at the High Court.

776
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:17,593
I've never seen anything like it.

777
00:57:17,677 --> 00:57:21,763
Desmond Doyle struggles with the gardai
for possession of his children.

778
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:24,350
A pitiful scene to watch.

779
00:57:24,433 --> 00:57:28,187
And who wouldn't sympathize with a father
in this situation?

780
00:57:28,688 --> 00:57:29,729
Daddy!

781
00:57:30,522 --> 00:57:31,606
Children!

782
00:57:32,273 --> 00:57:33,733
Daddy, please!

783
00:58:09,434 --> 00:58:11,310
Is Desmond Doyle here?

784
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:13,813
He's sitting over there, in the booth.

785
00:58:18,651 --> 00:58:20,528
Sorry to interrupt you.

786
00:58:21,404 --> 00:58:24,240
I'm Honest Joe O'Leary, racecourse bookie.

787
00:58:25,866 --> 00:58:29,494
I owned the book
on the outcome of your court case.

788
00:58:29,745 --> 00:58:32,372
- The punters backed you heavy.
- Great.

789
00:58:32,456 --> 00:58:34,957
I didn't feel right in keeping this...

790
00:58:35,082 --> 00:58:36,959
so I want you to have it.

791
00:58:42,883 --> 00:58:44,051
Jesus.

792
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,885
My God.

793
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:50,973
It's only 600, so I thought
it might go towards your court costs.

794
00:58:54,517 --> 00:58:56,812
I don't know what to say, Mr. O'Leary.

795
00:58:56,896 --> 00:59:00,775
You don't have to say anything, Mr. Doyle.
You see, I grew up in an orphanage.

796
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,526
I wish my dad had your guts.

797
00:59:04,152 --> 00:59:06,404
Good luck to you. Good night, all.

798
00:59:06,905 --> 00:59:08,239
Good night.

799
00:59:09,324 --> 00:59:12,160
We're organizing a race next month.

800
00:59:13,035 --> 00:59:15,997
- The Desmond Doyle Benefit Sweepstake.
- Great.

801
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,585
- Put your money on Slippery Sam.
- Slippery Sam.

802
00:59:22,503 --> 00:59:24,713
Grand man. Good night, now. God bless.

803
00:59:26,382 --> 00:59:30,010
This calls for a celebration.
Another round for the table.

804
00:59:30,094 --> 00:59:31,719
Make mine a lemonade.

805
00:59:31,886 --> 00:59:34,348
What? A lemonade? Are you all right, son?

806
00:59:34,682 --> 00:59:36,684
No, I'm feeling terrible.

807
00:59:38,227 --> 00:59:40,770
But maybe it's time I tried to feel better.

808
00:59:41,854 --> 00:59:42,814
Jerry.

809
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:50,696
Keep your eye on the ball, son.

810
00:59:53,825 --> 00:59:55,284
Dig it out.

811
00:59:55,493 --> 00:59:57,245
- Dig it out.
- Thomas!

812
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:05,377
- Good reflexes, you'll need them.
- Back in the Irish strip, I see.

813
01:00:05,836 --> 01:00:09,839
It helps me to see things more clearly.
Did you play rugby yourself, Nick?

814
01:00:09,922 --> 01:00:14,136
No, I understand it's kind of
a Neanderthal version of American football.

815
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:15,846
Is that what you think?

816
01:00:15,887 --> 01:00:17,139
Hut, hut.

817
01:00:22,226 --> 01:00:23,477
Hopeless.

818
01:00:24,228 --> 01:00:25,730
So, anyway...

819
01:00:26,647 --> 01:00:29,567
why have I invited you to this sacred turf?

820
01:00:29,942 --> 01:00:32,445
- I was kind of wondering that.
- So was I.

821
01:00:32,486 --> 01:00:35,781
Me, too. It's not exactly
how I planned to spend my morning.

822
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,115
You know...

823
01:00:39,075 --> 01:00:43,496
when my cartilage went and they
were taking me off on a stretcher...

824
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,333
I looked up and I saw this father...

825
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:50,170
holding his little child
up on his shoulders.

826
01:00:51,087 --> 01:00:54,299
They thought I was a hero,
but you know something?

827
01:00:54,883 --> 01:00:58,302
I envied that man so much. He was my hero.

828
01:01:00,095 --> 01:01:04,308
All Desmond wants
is to hold his kids up on his shoulders.

829
01:01:05,142 --> 01:01:06,810
We can help you to that.

830
01:01:06,894 --> 01:01:09,897
But how, Tom? There is no right of appeal.

831
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,523
Ferris made sure of that.

832
01:01:11,607 --> 01:01:13,400
We don't need an appeal.

833
01:01:13,692 --> 01:01:16,027
Not if we bring an entirely new case...

834
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:19,197
based on an entirely different
principle of law.

835
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,367
But we're automatically barred
from bringing the same facts...

836
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:25,160
before the same court
that's already heard them.

837
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:28,581
Be it the District Courts or High Courts,
we've nowhere else to go.

838
01:01:28,706 --> 01:01:30,792
There is somewhere else to go.

839
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:32,543
The Supreme Court.

840
01:01:33,002 --> 01:01:34,670
The Supreme Court?

841
01:01:35,462 --> 01:01:37,589
We can't go there with this.

842
01:01:37,756 --> 01:01:40,926
They won't hear a case like this.
They only deal with big stuff.

843
01:01:41,009 --> 01:01:41,968
Yes.

844
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:46,223
Like laws that contravene
the Irish Constitution...

845
01:01:47,182 --> 01:01:48,892
which I've been reading.

846
01:01:52,311 --> 01:01:54,188
Wait a second. Hold on.

847
01:01:54,271 --> 01:01:58,275
Has anyone ever successfully
challenged the law on these grounds?

848
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,361
No.

849
01:02:05,074 --> 01:02:08,202
- What chance do you think we've got?
- Who knows?

850
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:12,914
But I've seen games won by teams
without any hope at all.

851
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:18,545
Bloody hopeless.

852
01:02:20,213 --> 01:02:23,508
Good evening,
and welcome to the very first edition...

853
01:02:23,842 --> 01:02:25,760
of Conversations With Canning...

854
01:02:25,844 --> 01:02:28,680
on this marvelous new medium
of the television.

855
01:02:30,222 --> 01:02:33,434
For those of you who listen to my show
on the wireless...

856
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:36,603
I hope I'm even better looking
than you thought.

857
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,817
Now, many of you...

858
01:02:42,067 --> 01:02:46,064
will remember these sad headlines
of last month:

859
01:02:46,071 --> 01:02:48,378
"Desmond's Despair. "

860
01:02:49,073 --> 01:02:51,909
Desmond certainly isn't despairing
at the moment.

861
01:02:51,951 --> 01:02:54,579
In fact, he's sitting here,
right beside me...

862
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:57,415
in our ultramodern television studio.

863
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:01,794
And he's got new reasons for being hopeful,
haven't you Desmond?

864
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,004
Yes!

865
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:07,799
It's okay. You don't have to shout,
we can hear you fine.

866
01:03:08,383 --> 01:03:09,593
Fair enough.

867
01:03:09,676 --> 01:03:12,471
Doesn't he look handsome
when he smartens himself up?

868
01:03:12,554 --> 01:03:15,682
He's learning. I've always told him
he should model himself on me.

869
01:03:15,891 --> 01:03:20,187
...that your daughter Evelyn
and your two boys are being held illegally.

870
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:21,688
Yes.

871
01:03:22,939 --> 01:03:27,276
And you'll be taking on
some pretty top people?

872
01:03:27,485 --> 01:03:30,988
Yeah. We're gonna call
the Minister of Education as a witness.

873
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:36,368
And I've often asked myself,
"What drives Desmond Doyle?"

874
01:03:36,994 --> 01:03:39,622
- Desmond?
- I love my children.

875
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:43,876
I'm sick of saying goodbye to them
all the time.

876
01:03:43,959 --> 01:03:47,379
I just don't want them
to spend their whole childhood crying.

877
01:03:47,504 --> 01:03:50,298
- Has a date been set for the trial?
- Not yet.

878
01:03:50,382 --> 01:03:53,009
But I want my kiddies home for Christmas.

879
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,262
Home for Christmas.

880
01:03:57,305 --> 01:04:00,183
That's an inspiring note on which to end...

881
01:04:00,308 --> 01:04:03,269
this little conversation with Canning.

882
01:04:03,353 --> 01:04:04,603
Holy Jesus.

883
01:04:05,187 --> 01:04:07,523
This thing will never catch on.

884
01:04:07,898 --> 01:04:10,651
...and we'll be following your case closely.

885
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:12,444
And now...

886
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:15,864
the beautiful strains of the Irish harp.

887
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:22,912
Some good news, some bad news.

888
01:04:23,204 --> 01:04:25,540
First, the good news. They've set a date.

889
01:04:25,623 --> 01:04:28,001
- Second week in December.
- Great.

890
01:04:28,918 --> 01:04:31,170
It's a great time to have a trial.

891
01:04:31,337 --> 01:04:35,550
- Even judges are sentimental at Christmas.
- Not all of them, I'm afraid.

892
01:04:35,633 --> 01:04:37,635
Guess who we've got again.

893
01:04:37,802 --> 01:04:39,512
- Ferris the Ferret?
- Yes.

894
01:04:39,595 --> 01:04:43,307
He's been elevated
to the Supreme Court, apparently.

895
01:04:43,515 --> 01:04:45,183
Lousy luck.

896
01:04:45,642 --> 01:04:47,894
Luck's got nothing to do with it.

897
01:04:48,312 --> 01:04:52,733
If you ask me, the State's planted him there
in an attempt to scupper us.

898
01:04:55,527 --> 01:04:58,113
Come on, eat up, there's plenty more.

899
01:04:59,573 --> 01:05:02,033
Here, have a nice big fat sausage.

900
01:05:02,867 --> 01:05:06,454
We're gonna make you lovely and lazy.
Might slow you up a bit.

901
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:12,627
Sorry, Sam, nothing for you.
You're gonna get your feast after the race.

902
01:05:15,004 --> 01:05:18,007
They're off, and it's a close-packed field
at the start now.

903
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,758
Come on!

904
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:25,221
Stay up there, my boy.

905
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:27,098
Stay up. Yes!

906
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:30,602
They're battling it out, neck and neck.
Slippery Sam's edged in front.

907
01:05:30,685 --> 01:05:32,771
And as they come around the bend...

908
01:05:32,854 --> 01:05:35,148
Slippery Sam putting on
a tremendous effort.

909
01:05:52,957 --> 01:05:55,292
O'Leary, how did you know?

910
01:05:55,334 --> 01:05:57,961
Let's say I knew he was hungry for a win.

911
01:05:58,044 --> 01:05:59,754
- Good man.
- Desmond?

912
01:06:00,171 --> 01:06:03,424
The readers of the Irish Times
have voted you the Man of the Year.

913
01:06:03,508 --> 01:06:06,761
- How do you feel about that?
- I'm honored. Who was second?

914
01:06:06,803 --> 01:06:08,930
- The Pope.
- Fair play to him.

915
01:06:09,013 --> 01:06:10,473
Come on, Bernadette.

916
01:06:10,556 --> 01:06:13,810
- Let's go and collect our winnings.
- Right you are.

917
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,561
Desmond, I've got a few bob, myself.

918
01:06:17,312 --> 01:06:20,315
- How's it going with Bernadette, then?
- Great.

919
01:06:20,649 --> 01:06:25,278
In fact, I asked her to come back
to America with me, when the case is over.

920
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:26,947
Really?

921
01:06:27,364 --> 01:06:28,949
What did she say?

922
01:06:29,032 --> 01:06:31,284
She said she'd think about it.

923
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,622
I asked her to move in with me.

924
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:38,499
- Really?
- Yeah.

925
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:39,834
What did she say?

926
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:41,961
She said she'd think about it.

927
01:06:46,299 --> 01:06:50,011
- Who knows what she'll do.
- Fatima Mansions versus the USA.

928
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:52,846
Tough choice.

929
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:00,770
Sister, why don't you cut my hair?

930
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:02,438
You've cut everybody else's.

931
01:07:02,521 --> 01:07:06,401
Because they are not likely
to have their photos all over the newspaper.

932
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:11,038
Why should that make a difference? I don't
think that I should be treated special

933
01:07:11,073 --> 01:07:13,004
just because my daddy's
getting famous.

934
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,743
But didn't your daddy tell us
not to cut your hair?

935
01:07:15,826 --> 01:07:18,787
Yes, and didn't he tell you
to let me go home?

936
01:07:18,912 --> 01:07:21,122
You didn't take a blind bit of notice.

937
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:22,541
Look...

938
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:26,670
If I were to cut your hair,
Sister Theresa would not be amused.

939
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,298
I'll explain to my daddy if he gets cross.

940
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:32,592
And who will explain it to Sister Theresa
if she gets cross?

941
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:34,093
You, Sister.

942
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:38,848
Hugh Canning reporting to you, live,
from outside the Supreme Court...

943
01:07:39,098 --> 01:07:42,435
on the first day of this historic case.

944
01:07:43,186 --> 01:07:46,147
A grand, official car has just arrived.

945
01:07:46,356 --> 01:07:48,983
It's the Minister of Education.

946
01:07:49,025 --> 01:07:52,110
Looks as if he'd rather be
somewhere else, this day.

947
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:56,406
This must be what soldiers feel like
just before battle.

948
01:07:57,199 --> 01:07:58,867
- Nervous?
- Nervous?

949
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:03,733
I'm only trying to make legal history,
by doing something that's never been

950
01:08:03,817 --> 01:08:06,636
done before, and if I fail,
I'm unemployable.

951
01:08:06,671 --> 01:08:09,211
But if you win, son,
you're immortal.

952
01:08:09,246 --> 01:08:11,253
You're in the history books.

953
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,716
And you'll help take this country
out of the Dark Ages.

954
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,514
Rosary beads.
I thought you weren't religious.

955
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,058
I'm not.

956
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:29,396
When the verdict comes in,
these are for counting the score.

957
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:33,650
Remember, Nick, speak from your heart.

958
01:08:34,526 --> 01:08:38,071
I'll sit up in the gallery,
out of the Ferret's eye-line.

959
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,656
Thanks, Tom.

960
01:08:40,031 --> 01:08:42,242
- Good luck, son.
- Thanks for everything.

961
01:08:44,744 --> 01:08:45,911
Right.

962
01:08:50,165 --> 01:08:52,126
Let the battle commence.

963
01:08:53,002 --> 01:08:55,170
- Is this all right?
- It's fine.

964
01:08:56,839 --> 01:08:59,633
Minister, three times now
you have refused...

965
01:08:59,717 --> 01:09:03,220
to reconsider the case of Desmond Doyle.
Is that correct?

966
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:07,098
It is. A decision subsequently upheld
by the High Court.

967
01:09:07,974 --> 01:09:12,562
Yes, but the grounds for our action now
are fundamentally different, is that not so?

968
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:15,690
I suppose it is.

969
01:09:15,773 --> 01:09:20,737
Could you tell us, Minister, to whom or
to what do you owe your eminent position?

970
01:09:21,321 --> 01:09:22,447
Pardon?

971
01:09:22,572 --> 01:09:24,406
Your job, sir. Who appointed you?

972
01:09:24,448 --> 01:09:28,577
Objection, Your Lordship.
This is irrelevant, not to say insolent.

973
01:09:28,785 --> 01:09:29,786
My lord...

974
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:34,333
counsel for the plaintiff
has indeed failed to establish relevance.

975
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:37,127
I am about to do so, Your Lordship.

976
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,338
I hope so, Mr. Barron. Proceed.

977
01:09:41,214 --> 01:09:45,468
As Minister for Education, you are
a government appointee, are you not?

978
01:09:45,676 --> 01:09:46,969
Of course I am.

979
01:09:47,053 --> 01:09:50,222
What is the document on which
the Irish government's authority...

980
01:09:50,306 --> 01:09:52,933
and therefore your authority, rests?

981
01:09:53,893 --> 01:09:55,811
The Irish Constitution.

982
01:09:56,228 --> 01:09:58,731
Have you read it recently?

983
01:09:58,814 --> 01:10:01,107
Objection, Your Lordship.
This is insufferable!

984
01:10:01,191 --> 01:10:05,153
Counsel for the plaintiff is not displaying
due deference to the witness, my lord.

985
01:10:05,236 --> 01:10:06,988
Objection sustained.

986
01:10:07,155 --> 01:10:10,492
Be careful, Mr. Barron.
The witness must be treated with respect.

987
01:10:10,617 --> 01:10:11,826
Yes, my lord.

988
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:16,247
I would be grateful
if you could read out to the Court...

989
01:10:16,289 --> 01:10:19,250
those short extracts
from the Irish Constitution...

990
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:23,128
which, we have established,
is the basis for your authority.

991
01:10:25,798 --> 01:10:27,007
"Article 1.

992
01:10:27,132 --> 01:10:31,095
"The Irish Constitution shall be consistent
with the law of God.

993
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:34,264
"Article 41.

994
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:38,434
"A parent and child have a fundamental
and God-given right...

995
01:10:38,518 --> 01:10:41,604
"to the enjoyment of each other's
mutual society.

996
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,984
"Article 42.

997
01:10:46,025 --> 01:10:49,946
"A blameless parent shall not be deprived
of his or her right...

998
01:10:50,029 --> 01:10:52,115
"to direct the child's education. "

999
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:54,784
Is it fair to say
that by consistently rejecting...

1000
01:10:54,826 --> 01:10:57,703
Desmond Doyle's application
for the return of his children...

1001
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:02,666
you have denied him
that fundamental and God-given right?

1002
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:05,877
Would it be fair to say that, Minister?

1003
01:11:08,755 --> 01:11:11,174
We are waiting for your response.

1004
01:11:11,925 --> 01:11:14,177
That is a possibility.

1005
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:15,721
Yes.

1006
01:11:15,804 --> 01:11:17,555
And is it also a possibility...

1007
01:11:17,638 --> 01:11:21,142
that you have contravened
Article 42 of the Constitution...

1008
01:11:21,225 --> 01:11:26,022
by denying Desmond Doyle the right
to direct his children's education?

1009
01:11:27,273 --> 01:11:28,316
Yes.

1010
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:31,027
That is also a possibility.

1011
01:11:32,445 --> 01:11:35,655
- That is what we are here to determine.
- Exactly.

1012
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:39,034
And we will so determine.

1013
01:11:39,117 --> 01:11:40,702
Good boy.

1014
01:11:40,994 --> 01:11:42,746
No further questions.

1015
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:44,122
Well done.

1016
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:48,418
Article 42 of the Constitution...

1017
01:11:48,501 --> 01:11:51,087
refers to a blameless parent.

1018
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,674
And we contend that this concept
is tacit also in Article 41.

1019
01:11:56,091 --> 01:11:58,427
That it is the blameless parent...

1020
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:02,641
who has a fundamental, God-given right
to his children's society.

1021
01:12:03,682 --> 01:12:04,642
This...

1022
01:12:04,725 --> 01:12:07,102
does not apply to Desmond Doyle.

1023
01:12:09,939 --> 01:12:12,982
He came barging in, unannounced,
to the main building.

1024
01:12:13,066 --> 01:12:15,401
He was in a terrible rage...

1025
01:12:15,818 --> 01:12:17,987
and he looked like a man
possessed by the Devil.

1026
01:12:18,071 --> 01:12:22,200
Objection. Your Lordship,
the witness is demonizing my client.

1027
01:12:22,283 --> 01:12:26,162
Not so, my lord. The Sister
is merely expressing herself vividly...

1028
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:29,749
using a figure of speech
appropriate to her occupation.

1029
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,751
Objection overruled. Proceed, Sister.

1030
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,504
He was like a man possessed.

1031
01:12:35,671 --> 01:12:38,090
He shouted at me, "Where is my daughter?"

1032
01:12:38,173 --> 01:12:41,718
- He yelled at the top of his voice.
- And what did you say to him, Sister?

1033
01:12:41,802 --> 01:12:45,597
- I asked him if he had an appointment.
- And what did he say?

1034
01:12:46,056 --> 01:12:49,601
He grabbed me by the throat
and almost choked the life out of me.

1035
01:12:49,685 --> 01:12:51,560
Throttling me, he was.

1036
01:12:52,061 --> 01:12:54,522
He said if I didn't tell him
where his daughter was...

1037
01:12:54,605 --> 01:12:58,192
he would tear me limb from limb.
Those were his exact words.

1038
01:12:58,276 --> 01:13:02,613
- I thought he was going to murder me.
- And what did he do then, Sister?

1039
01:13:03,572 --> 01:13:06,575
I told him where the girl was
and he ran upstairs...

1040
01:13:06,617 --> 01:13:09,119
repeating his threats as he did so.

1041
01:13:09,244 --> 01:13:12,163
My neck was black and blue
from where his thumbs had been.

1042
01:13:12,247 --> 01:13:15,000
Did you report
this deplorable incident to anyone?

1043
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:17,878
Yes, I phoned the police.
They will confirm every word.

1044
01:13:17,962 --> 01:13:22,340
Sister Theresa decided, out of the charity
of her heart, not to press charges.

1045
01:13:22,424 --> 01:13:24,634
No further questions, my lord.

1046
01:13:27,012 --> 01:13:29,013
Have I messed it up for us all, then?

1047
01:13:29,054 --> 01:13:30,806
You may have.

1048
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,476
We're just gonna have to show
that this was an isolated incident...

1049
01:13:34,518 --> 01:13:37,021
not part of a pattern of behavior.

1050
01:13:37,104 --> 01:13:40,649
- I hope that was the only such incident?
- Of course it was.

1051
01:13:40,733 --> 01:13:43,902
Apart from the time you tried to punch
Father O'Malley at Fergal's.

1052
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:44,987
That.

1053
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:49,240
- And when you tried to kidnap your kids.
- Yes, but I was drunk on both occasions.

1054
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:52,910
For God's sake, don't try to use
drunkenness as a defense.

1055
01:13:52,994 --> 01:13:54,830
It doesn't impress them.

1056
01:13:54,913 --> 01:13:58,625
Haven't you heard the phrase,
"As sober as a judge"?

1057
01:14:03,212 --> 01:14:04,963
So, you see, Your Lordship...

1058
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:09,635
I only shook Sister Brigid when
I found out she'd beaten up my little girl.

1059
01:14:09,718 --> 01:14:12,262
- I object, Your Lordship.
- Not as much as I object.

1060
01:14:12,346 --> 01:14:14,806
I object to anyone laying a finger
on my kids.

1061
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:16,767
Objection upheld.

1062
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:19,978
That's Mr. Wolfe's objection,
not yours, Mr. Doyle.

1063
01:14:20,062 --> 01:14:22,064
Continue with your testimony.

1064
01:14:22,522 --> 01:14:24,941
Wouldn't any father have done what I did?

1065
01:14:25,232 --> 01:14:27,985
Evelyn's face was all battered and bruised.

1066
01:14:29,403 --> 01:14:31,072
Silence in court.

1067
01:14:34,492 --> 01:14:37,453
Even as a very dubious kind of Catholic...

1068
01:14:37,536 --> 01:14:40,164
who finds himself throttling a nun...

1069
01:14:40,414 --> 01:14:44,292
you must know that the fundamental
building block of our society...

1070
01:14:44,376 --> 01:14:45,543
is the family...

1071
01:14:45,627 --> 01:14:48,505
whose very model is the Holy family...

1072
01:14:48,588 --> 01:14:50,548
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1073
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,594
How can you, as a single father
and as a Catholic...

1074
01:14:55,262 --> 01:14:58,473
possibly claim to bring up your children
without a mother?

1075
01:14:58,556 --> 01:15:01,226
There is absolutely no precedent for it...

1076
01:15:01,309 --> 01:15:04,436
in the religion
in which you allegedly believe.

1077
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,699
Cat got your tongue...

1078
01:15:17,533 --> 01:15:18,909
Mr. Doyle?

1079
01:15:24,956 --> 01:15:26,249
There is...

1080
01:15:28,752 --> 01:15:31,879
There is a precedent,
as you'd like to call it.

1081
01:15:31,921 --> 01:15:33,715
What are you saying?

1082
01:15:34,716 --> 01:15:38,927
The fundamental building block of our faith
is not the Holy family...

1083
01:15:39,678 --> 01:15:41,513
it's the Holy Trinity.

1084
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,433
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1085
01:15:45,434 --> 01:15:47,270
When my mother died...

1086
01:15:48,395 --> 01:15:50,981
my father brought us up on his own...

1087
01:15:51,315 --> 01:15:53,900
with only the Holy Spirit to guide him.

1088
01:15:53,942 --> 01:15:56,737
He used to say the Holy Spirit was love.

1089
01:15:56,778 --> 01:16:00,114
Doesn't the Holy Bible say,
"... faith, hope and love...

1090
01:16:01,449 --> 01:16:04,493
"but the greatest of these is love"?

1091
01:16:06,622 --> 01:16:08,581
I've given up the drink.

1092
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:13,419
I've worked all the hours God sends.

1093
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:18,089
I've become a better person to try
and fill myself with the Holy Spirit...

1094
01:16:18,214 --> 01:16:21,134
so I can bring my kids up
surrounded by love.

1095
01:16:24,889 --> 01:16:26,640
That's all I can do.

1096
01:16:28,141 --> 01:16:29,809
No man can do more.

1097
01:16:40,069 --> 01:16:41,487
Silence in court.

1098
01:16:41,654 --> 01:16:42,863
Silence!

1099
01:16:44,658 --> 01:16:46,450
No further questions.

1100
01:16:46,867 --> 01:16:49,828
Your Lordship, we would request
that the court is recalled...

1101
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:52,498
when we have subpoenaed
our next witness...

1102
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:54,874
Evelyn Doyle.

1103
01:16:56,793 --> 01:16:59,754
The bastards.
They'll intimidate the little soul.

1104
01:17:00,713 --> 01:17:05,093
Lord Jesus, I have to go to the big court
soon, to answer some questions.

1105
01:17:05,385 --> 01:17:07,345
Please let my daddy win.

1106
01:17:07,512 --> 01:17:10,974
I know you're testing him,
but I think he's getting very tired.

1107
01:17:11,057 --> 01:17:13,517
Lord, please let him win.

1108
01:17:14,184 --> 01:17:15,269
Amen.

1109
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:28,115
- Daddy!
- Hello, love.

1110
01:17:29,157 --> 01:17:30,450
Your hair.

1111
01:17:30,534 --> 01:17:32,410
I told them to cut it.

1112
01:17:32,785 --> 01:17:34,412
Don't you like it?

1113
01:17:35,663 --> 01:17:37,456
It's lovely, pet.

1114
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:38,958
It suits you.

1115
01:17:39,041 --> 01:17:41,252
You've got your new shoes on again.

1116
01:17:43,129 --> 01:17:44,547
You've got to go now.

1117
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:45,965
Bye, Daddy.

1118
01:17:46,799 --> 01:17:49,093
Silence in court.

1119
01:17:50,386 --> 01:17:52,929
The court will draw itself to order.

1120
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:02,564
Now, Evelyn Doyle...

1121
01:18:04,232 --> 01:18:08,028
do you remember the time in St. Joseph's,
when you tripped in the corridor...

1122
01:18:08,111 --> 01:18:10,571
and bashed your face,
when you fell down the stairs?

1123
01:18:10,654 --> 01:18:11,905
No, sir.

1124
01:18:12,448 --> 01:18:14,575
Think back to last March.

1125
01:18:15,242 --> 01:18:18,246
Apparently, Sister Felicity
had to give you some aspirin.

1126
01:18:18,538 --> 01:18:19,914
Isn't that correct?

1127
01:18:19,997 --> 01:18:22,416
- Yes, sir, she did.
- And why was that?

1128
01:18:22,499 --> 01:18:24,960
Because my face was all swollen
and black and blue.

1129
01:18:25,002 --> 01:18:27,671
Because you had fallen down the stairs.

1130
01:18:27,755 --> 01:18:30,340
No. That's what Sister Brigid said.

1131
01:18:30,423 --> 01:18:32,759
According to Sister Felicity,
you made no attempt...

1132
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,389
to deny the fact that you had fallen
down the stairs and bruised your face.

1133
01:18:40,642 --> 01:18:42,727
You didn't say otherwise, did you?

1134
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:43,853
No.

1135
01:18:44,145 --> 01:18:45,563
I mean, yes.

1136
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:47,064
I'm all mixed up.

1137
01:18:47,147 --> 01:18:49,608
So, what really happened...

1138
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:53,362
was exactly what Sister Brigid said
had happened.

1139
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:57,449
And you made up a story
in your letter to your father...

1140
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,868
because you wanted to get out
of St. Joseph's...

1141
01:18:59,952 --> 01:19:02,454
and you thought a little lie would help.

1142
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:05,249
I didn't lie. I didn't make it up.

1143
01:19:05,332 --> 01:19:08,918
I know it must be a frightening
experience for you, Evelyn...

1144
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:11,963
being a little girl in
a big court like this.

1145
01:19:12,296 --> 01:19:16,467
You must try not to be scared. Even though
you're alone in front of all these people.

1146
01:19:31,565 --> 01:19:34,901
I'm not scared anymore, Your Lordship,
and I'm not alone.

1147
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,946
My granddad is here with me.

1148
01:19:38,863 --> 01:19:41,408
See. He's letting us know he's here.

1149
01:19:42,367 --> 01:19:46,203
Your Lordship, the child's grandfather
died some months ago.

1150
01:19:46,245 --> 01:19:48,330
She obviously has a very...

1151
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:50,207
vivid imagination.

1152
01:19:52,419 --> 01:19:54,044
Now, child...

1153
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:57,089
let me ask you one last time...

1154
01:19:57,172 --> 01:20:01,385
do you remember falling in the corridor
and hitting your face on the stairs?

1155
01:20:01,468 --> 01:20:03,845
No, I didn't fall on the stairs.

1156
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:07,348
I was going to tell Sister Felicity
what really happened...

1157
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:10,603
but then I thought it would
only get Sister Brigid into trouble.

1158
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:13,771
So, I prayed that God
would forgive Sister Brigid for hitting me.

1159
01:20:13,855 --> 01:20:16,441
This is a preposterous assertion.

1160
01:20:16,774 --> 01:20:19,569
Why on earth
would the good Sister hit you?

1161
01:20:19,611 --> 01:20:23,363
Because I said she shouldn't belt Annette
for getting her catechism wrong.

1162
01:20:23,405 --> 01:20:25,699
Poor little innocent. Shame on you.

1163
01:20:25,782 --> 01:20:28,578
She was better off with Desmond Doyle.
I can see that now.

1164
01:20:28,661 --> 01:20:31,914
- Wait till I get you outside!
- Silence in court!

1165
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,752
Evelyn Doyle...

1166
01:20:36,835 --> 01:20:40,755
do you expect this court to believe
that after she did that to you...

1167
01:20:40,838 --> 01:20:43,424
- you prayed for her?
- Yes, I did.

1168
01:20:43,633 --> 01:20:46,093
I put it to you that you are lying.

1169
01:20:46,135 --> 01:20:48,555
Lying is a sin
against the Eighth Commandment.

1170
01:20:48,597 --> 01:20:52,183
"Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbor. "

1171
01:20:52,433 --> 01:20:55,686
I'm surprised you don't know that,
if you're a lawyer.

1172
01:20:56,103 --> 01:20:58,730
Sister Brigid told this court
the truth of the matter...

1173
01:20:58,772 --> 01:21:02,025
that she picked you up
when you fell down the stairs.

1174
01:21:02,234 --> 01:21:06,280
No. That's not true.
Hope she goes to confession soon.

1175
01:21:09,574 --> 01:21:12,494
- Wanna hear the prayer I said last night?
- We do not.

1176
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:14,120
Not so, Mr. Wolfe.

1177
01:21:14,204 --> 01:21:18,249
It is material to the court's evaluation
of the child's character.

1178
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:21,961
Evelyn, let us hear your prayer, please.

1179
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,839
"Lord God...

1180
01:21:25,465 --> 01:21:28,342
"you guide the universe
with wisdom and love.

1181
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,720
"Hear the prayer we make to you
for our country...

1182
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,181
"the beautiful country of Ireland.

1183
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:38,726
"Through the honesty of our citizens,
and the wisdom of those who govern us...

1184
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,187
"may lasting peace be delivered...

1185
01:21:41,437 --> 01:21:43,774
"and truth and justice flourish. "

1186
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,317
Amen.

1187
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,405
- She's a credit to you.
- Thank you.

1188
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,657
Thank you, Evelyn. You may step down.

1189
01:21:53,866 --> 01:21:56,618
The great day has finally arrived.

1190
01:21:56,660 --> 01:22:00,664
The day Desmond Doyle and his kids,
and indeed the whole of Ireland...

1191
01:22:00,747 --> 01:22:02,500
has been waiting for.

1192
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:06,169
The day when Desmond finds out,
once and for all...

1193
01:22:06,211 --> 01:22:08,422
whether he will get his kids back.

1194
01:22:08,505 --> 01:22:11,967
Sister, why couldn't me and the boys
go to court today?

1195
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:15,261
Because they don't want a repeat
of the scenes they had last time.

1196
01:22:15,511 --> 01:22:20,100
The Lord Mayor of Dublin has just
appeared in his official limousine...

1197
01:22:20,183 --> 01:22:22,644
and a beautiful car it is, too.

1198
01:22:23,227 --> 01:22:26,981
I would remind you, however,
that never before...

1199
01:22:27,064 --> 01:22:31,360
has a law been found repugnant
to the Irish Constitution...

1200
01:22:31,444 --> 01:22:35,864
and that has to happen today,
if Desmond Doyle is to win.

1201
01:22:42,913 --> 01:22:46,166
I now call on Justice Ferris
to deliver his judgment.

1202
01:22:47,709 --> 01:22:52,546
I am persuaded by Mr. Wolfe's argument
on behalf of the Minister for Education...

1203
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:55,090
that the term "parent"...

1204
01:22:55,174 --> 01:22:58,178
in Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution...

1205
01:22:58,637 --> 01:23:01,805
must be held to imply both parents.

1206
01:23:02,765 --> 01:23:05,267
There is no contradiction
between those Articles...

1207
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:07,686
and Section 10 of the Children's Act...

1208
01:23:08,103 --> 01:23:12,232
and said Act
is not repugnant to the Constitution.

1209
01:23:13,441 --> 01:23:17,404
I, therefore, find in favor of the
defendant, the Minister for Education.

1210
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:21,366
I'll strangle that ferret one day.

1211
01:23:23,952 --> 01:23:27,455
It's 1-0 to the Minister,
with 2 votes to go.

1212
01:23:27,747 --> 01:23:31,124
The next Judge, Justice Daley,
must vote for Desmond...

1213
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:33,543
or it's all over for the Doyles.

1214
01:23:34,211 --> 01:23:36,714
Don't despair, my child. Have faith.

1215
01:23:36,923 --> 01:23:39,591
...or there'll be rioting going on.

1216
01:23:41,802 --> 01:23:44,263
I agree with Mr. Wolfe...

1217
01:23:45,138 --> 01:23:48,266
that the Minister for Education has,
at all times...

1218
01:23:48,349 --> 01:23:51,185
acted in a reasonable
and conscientious manner...

1219
01:23:51,852 --> 01:23:54,565
within the provisions of the Children's Act.

1220
01:23:54,606 --> 01:23:58,401
I also agree with my learned
and honorable friend, Justice Ferris...

1221
01:23:59,026 --> 01:24:01,279
that there is no precedent for declaring...

1222
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,990
an Irish Statute
repugnant to the Constitution...

1223
01:24:04,073 --> 01:24:07,576
- Please God, grant us a "however. "
- ... and therefore invalid.

1224
01:24:10,161 --> 01:24:13,249
However, despite the absence
of precedent...

1225
01:24:13,791 --> 01:24:16,501
I find Mr. Barron's argument persuasive.

1226
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:20,589
In any event, with respect to
my learned friend, Mr. Ferris...

1227
01:24:20,672 --> 01:24:23,008
it is the duty of the Supreme Court...

1228
01:24:23,174 --> 01:24:25,259
not only to follow precedent...

1229
01:24:26,135 --> 01:24:27,761
but to set it.

1230
01:24:28,512 --> 01:24:30,389
On the grounds submitted...

1231
01:24:31,056 --> 01:24:34,185
that the Children's Act 1941, Section 10...

1232
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:37,021
contravenes a parent's fundamental,
God-given right...

1233
01:24:37,104 --> 01:24:38,939
to the society of his children...

1234
01:24:38,981 --> 01:24:41,525
and is therefore repugnant
to the Constitution...

1235
01:24:42,318 --> 01:24:45,403
I find in favor of the plaintiff,
Desmond Doyle.

1236
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:51,452
Marvelous! Children,
don't you stop praying now.

1237
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:55,632
...the Supreme Court.
Now it all rests on the

1238
01:24:55,667 --> 01:25:01,614
shoulders of Justice Lynch, a Kerry man.
The tension in here is almost unbearable.

1239
01:25:01,649 --> 01:25:06,089
I can't think of anything like it, since
Tom Connolly's last-second penalty goal...

1240
01:25:06,173 --> 01:25:09,302
that won Ireland the Triple Crown,
30 years ago.

1241
01:25:09,344 --> 01:25:10,887
And amazingly...

1242
01:25:11,179 --> 01:25:14,848
Connolly is now part
of Desmond Doyle's team.

1243
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:18,352
I have been impressed
by Desmond Doyle's diligence...

1244
01:25:18,435 --> 01:25:23,439
and determination in rebuilding
his financial and domestic circumstances...

1245
01:25:23,898 --> 01:25:26,609
in the wake of
his wife's unfortunate desertion.

1246
01:25:26,692 --> 01:25:29,738
I have noted, too,
the obvious bonds of love and affection...

1247
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:32,531
between Doyle and his daughter, Evelyn...

1248
01:25:33,032 --> 01:25:36,077
who made a deep impression on me,
and I'm sure, on all of us...

1249
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:39,789
- in the witness stand.
- Please, no. Don't give us a "however. "

1250
01:25:39,872 --> 01:25:43,541
However, we are officers of the law...

1251
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:46,671
and must not be guided by sentiment.

1252
01:25:47,797 --> 01:25:51,508
Though Mr. Barron
made a moving and powerful plea...

1253
01:25:51,591 --> 01:25:53,134
on behalf of his client...

1254
01:25:53,218 --> 01:25:55,428
a stirring appeal to the heart...

1255
01:25:56,763 --> 01:26:01,725
we, as law officers, must determine cases
with the head, not the heart.

1256
01:26:02,393 --> 01:26:03,769
Tom, have we lost?

1257
01:26:03,852 --> 01:26:06,398
I agree with my learned friend,
Justice Ferris...

1258
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:09,775
- Yes, unless he says another "however. "
- ... that it is regrettable...

1259
01:26:10,234 --> 01:26:15,239
that no precedent has been cited
in support of Mr. Doyle's case.

1260
01:26:18,658 --> 01:26:20,076
However...

1261
01:26:20,702 --> 01:26:24,206
though no precedent can be found
in Irish law...

1262
01:26:24,748 --> 01:26:28,710
we can argue
from an analogous English case.

1263
01:26:29,419 --> 01:26:32,463
In the Crown versus Clark, 1891...

1264
01:26:32,547 --> 01:26:36,884
the principle of a parent's inalienable
right to his or her children...

1265
01:26:37,092 --> 01:26:39,720
was enshrined in common law.

1266
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:42,932
However...

1267
01:26:44,642 --> 01:26:46,310
...the parent's right...

1268
01:26:46,393 --> 01:26:50,898
could, as common law,
be overridden by statute.

1269
01:26:54,359 --> 01:26:57,111
- However...
- Yes, dear God.

1270
01:26:57,153 --> 01:26:58,654
...unlike the English...

1271
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:02,117
we Irish have a written Constitution...

1272
01:27:02,826 --> 01:27:06,287
so that, in the words
of Evelyn Doyle's prayer:

1273
01:27:06,746 --> 01:27:09,540
"truth and justice may flourish. "

1274
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:14,086
I find it unarguably true,
as Mr. Barron contends...

1275
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:18,632
a parent has
an inalienable and God-given right...

1276
01:27:18,715 --> 01:27:20,843
to the society of his children.

1277
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:24,179
I therefore find
in favor of the plaintiff, Mr. Doyle.

1278
01:27:42,821 --> 01:27:43,948
We did it!

1279
01:27:51,955 --> 01:27:54,040
Desmond Doyle has won!

1280
01:27:56,084 --> 01:27:57,253
Glory be to God!

1281
01:28:02,549 --> 01:28:05,343
- Praise be to God!
- Sister, we've won.

1282
01:28:07,303 --> 01:28:10,223
Darling child, don't you forget me.

1283
01:28:10,597 --> 01:28:12,724
I won't, Sister. I love you.

1284
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:23,735
You'll be needing
a housekeeper now, won't you?

1285
01:28:51,928 --> 01:28:54,891
Love and glory, boys!

1286
01:28:56,058 --> 01:28:59,102
Legal history has been made.

1287
01:29:12,908 --> 01:29:16,077
Evelyn's won. We can all go home soon!

1288
01:29:34,303 --> 01:29:35,470
Daddy!

1289
01:29:37,513 --> 01:29:40,892
Oh, my love. Good to see you.

1290
01:29:54,321 --> 01:29:55,739
Let me see you.

1291
01:30:01,245 --> 01:30:03,121
You look gorgeous.

1292
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:31,148
Don't worry, Heidi. I didn't forget you.

1293
01:30:38,446 --> 01:30:41,365
Let's connect these two together now.

1294
01:30:51,041 --> 01:30:52,668
Some tea, too?

1295
01:31:07,266 --> 01:31:09,976
Children, come and sit down, turkey's ready.

1296
01:31:10,059 --> 01:31:13,605
Evelyn, Maurice, Dermot,
come and sit down, everybody.

1297
01:31:13,730 --> 01:31:16,858
- I am starving.
- Okay, crackers. Get a cracker, lads.

1298
01:31:20,075 --> 01:31:22,325
Sit down. Oh!
