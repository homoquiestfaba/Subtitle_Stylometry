176
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,293
Yeah, well,
it was impulse.

177
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,195
Hi, Mrs. Ainsworth.

178
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,632
Name's McClain.

179
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,735
She uses her maiden name,
isn't that retro?

180
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:02,042
I'm sorry.
Mother, this is Bruce.

181
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:05,613
Bruce, Mother.
Hello, Mother McClain.

182
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,247
It's nice to finally
meet you, Bruce.

183
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,982
Make room, make room.

184
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,152
Well...

185
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,027
All rise, the Honorable Judge
Kathryn McClain presiding.

186
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,667
(DOOR SLAMS)

187
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,739
(WHISPERING) Marion,
I'm going to kill you.

188
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,144
You may be seated.

189
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,312
Case on call,
 Estate vs. Daryl Cook.

190
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,383
Prosecution,
are you ready?
Yes, Your Honor.

191
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,886
Defense, you ready?
Yes, but I have a motion.

192
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,087
What's the motion?

193
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,622
Move to dismiss.

194
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,290
Grounds?

195
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,260
My client is a juvenile
and it's a direct violation of
his constitutional rights

196
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:57,030
to be tried in an adult
court where his identity
is known to the public.

197
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,799
Council, I think
you know that
as a juvenile,

198
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,268
your client has no such
constitutional rights.

199
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,170
I suggest you move on to
something more relevant.

200
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,705
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

201
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,239
I really shouldn't need
an opening argument

202
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,241
for a case that
shouldn't be in this court.

203
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,910
Nevertheless,
I suggest you find one

204
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,714
because in two seconds,
the prosecution
will have the floor.

205
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,749
Your Honor, may I
approach the bench?
No.

206
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,084
Your Honor, I...
(GAVEL THUDS)

207
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,653
This court is adjourned for
15 minutes.

208
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,822
Council,
in my chambers, please.

209
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,996
You should stay in
juvenile court, Tom,

210
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,264
you have so much
in common with your clients.
Oh, really?

211
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,035
I see what you mean.
Patronized, marginalized,
ignored by the system.

212
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,905
Have I left anything out?

213
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:41,842
Look, why would you
bring this hopeless case
into my court?

214
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,143
I thought it was Marion's.

215
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,446
It was scheduled...
Get continuance,
massage your calendar.

216
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,082
Unless, of course, you wanted
to argue in front of me.
I don't know.

217
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,885
Maybe try to take advantage
of some personal
relationship which,

218
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,154
by the way,
hasn't existed in
over a decade.

219
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,455
That would be...

220
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,390
I don't suppose
it would cross your mind
that I wanted to be here

221
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,392
because I respect you
as a judge.

222
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,862
I don't think that...
What is it about this kid
that has you so worked up?

223
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,333
Somebody's got to
cover the fringes.

224
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,201
Not all of us can be at
the center of the universe.

225
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,738
It's already
too damn crowded.
Your Honor!

226
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,773
BOTH: What?

227
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,908
The people would
understand a continuance

228
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,343
if you'd like to
recuse yourself.

229
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,410
I mean...

230
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,249
Is there a bathroom?

231
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,953
Kathryn...

232
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,120
(DOOR OPENS)

233
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,456
This kids has had
a nightmare life.

234
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,725
Sell the jury on the merits,

235
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,995
but leave out the
constitutional acrobatics.
All right.

236
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,231
I keep forgetting
how damn inconvenient
you find the constitution.

237
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,067
Oh, God,
this is so typical.

238
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,070
Yeah, well,
this is so typical of you.

239
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,272
(KNOCKING)
Uh, Your Honor?

240
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,841
Come in.

241
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,354
Listen, catch Judge McClain
before she leaves
and give that to her.

242
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,325
Hey, everybody.
Hey.

243
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,794
Hey.

244
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:11,364
Well, Marion, I hope
your weekend was worth it
because you are dead.

245
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,400
Haven't you guys ever
run into each other before?

246
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,935
It's not that big a town.

247
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,004
You must still have
some friends in common.

248
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,539
Are you kidding?
Divorce is like
cell division.

249
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,342
First the nucleus splits
and then all those
chromosomes thingies

250
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,178
swim off to one side
or the other. It's science.

251

(ALL LAUGHING)

252
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,549
Excuse me, I was asked
to give this to you.

253
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,184
I bet it's from
Daniel Klein.

254
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:34,822
Poor boy has no idea what
he's getting himself into.

255
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,990
You're just jealous
because I made the list
for court of appeal.

256
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,859
Don't try and
change the subject.

257
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,127
Since when was Tom a subject?

258
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,262
I thought I was talking
about Daniel.

259
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,832
Come on, open it.
Get a life, you guys.

260
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,766
Why? We've got yours.

261

If you don't sleep
with him, honey,

263
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,008
you could certainly
sleep with this.

264
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,577
Give me that, you slut.
Speaking of which,
Morris is very lonely.

265
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,512
Morris is a troll.
(ALL LAUGHING)

So, uh, the cabin.
Oh, don't.

(ALL LAUGHING)

268
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,120
You know, it's not that
I was nervous about it,

269
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:10,490
I just couldn't figure out
how we'd get past
the work situation.

270

Because no matter
how we feel,

271
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,196
you still have to put that
robe on every day.

It's the robe, isn't it?
I knew it was the robe.

273

Do you keep one here?

you're not kinky

before I get to kinky.

Sorry. I'm sorry.

282
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,031
That's okay.
I hope you didn't think
I was being too forward.

283
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,432
No, I didn't think,
no, not at all.

284
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,867
Because I don't
want you to think
I'm just...

285
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,235
No, I don't think that.

286
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,605
I could help you
clean up the kitchen.
I...

287
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,474
Do you want me to
clean up the kitchen?
No, the...

288
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,277
Actually that, I,
that was ordered in.

289
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,879
Really? Oh.
Yes.

290
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,249
I should go.
It's okay, you don't
have to go.

291
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:12,519
I know. I just,
I think we should
try this tomorrow.

We could try it tomorrow.
Yeah.

Is it too soon?
No, no, no.

So, Irish,

298
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,922
just which part of
my total remission
wasn't total?

299
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:29,029
Kathryn, cancer is
a vicious disease,

300
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,031
and it doesn't usually
play fair.

301
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,634
Oh, not fair.
Well, my my.

302
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,504
I guess it's time
for the gloves
to come off, hmm?

303
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:39,639
So...

304
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,509
What do we do now?

305
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,011
We start again?

306

Listen, another round
of the same sequence
will do absolutely no good.

307

What then?

00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,160

hospital in Houston.

Cutting edge young Turks
with all the new drugs.

Big clinical tests
with promising results,
all that.

00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,635
Tests?

312
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:10,437
Doesn't that mean
I could get a placebo?

313
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,704
Do you know
these doctors?

314
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,540
Yes.

They're every bit as good
as they think they are.

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,647
Hmm.
Sounds like a nightmare.

It's Daniel, isn't it?
(CHUCKLES)

319
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,189
How did he get to be
so serious?

320
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,324
Oh, come on, why do you
have to be so secretive.

321
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,293
Can't you at least tell me
where you're going?

322
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,428
Cruise? Mountains?

323
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,629
Both.

324
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,067
Daryl Cook, he's 16.

325
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,702
The facts were tried,
the sentencing guidelines
are as clear as a bell.

326
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,105
No, they're not,
they're rigid.

327
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,707
And the boy
has a good lawyer,
he'll appeal.

328
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,112
Anything special you
want me to say to Tom
when I deliver this?

329
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,581
Well, you'll think
of something.

330
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:58,118
So my mother calls me,
says can you feed the cats
for five days.

331
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:00,520
I cancel my cases,
go to Texas

332
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,790
and she waits till
I'm knee deep in
choice cuts and cheese bits

333
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,725
to mention that there's
a little cancer thing...
What?

334
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:06,793
...she needs
to take care of.

335
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,328
How did that get in there?
They hate that stuff.

336
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,630
What am I supposed
to say to that, huh?

337
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,365
Oh, cancer.
Wet food or dry food?

338
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:16,336
Michael, can you make sure
you change the litter because
I don't care what they say,

339
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,606
if you scoop, the whole place
is going to smell like a barn
by the time I get back.

340
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,374
I'm just curious, Mom.

341
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,244
If the chemo had worked
and you didn't
need a cat-sitter,

342
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,612
would you have even
mentioned it to me?

343

Don't you have
an ambulance to chase?

514

Doesn't anyone have
anywhere else
they have to be?

515
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:32,945
I'll check
on the flowers.
Okay.

516
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:39,285
Oh, brilliant.

517
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,120
I talked to an herbalist
in Chinatown.

518
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,454
He wants to see you
right away.

519
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,323
I made an appointment
for you tomorrow morning.

520
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:45,825
What nonsense.

521
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:48,160
She'll do nothing
of the kind. She's fine.

522
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,461
No, Sylvia, she's not fine.

523
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,263
Three days in bed,
she'll be back on her feet.

524
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:53,532
Sylvia, she went to Houston
for treatments.

525
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,102
That's where they send you
when they've run out of ideas.

526
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,847
You don't go to Houston
for the flu.

527
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,859
Mehitable called,
said there was some
kind of convention.

528
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,261
Well...

529
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,263
We have a quorum.

530
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,331
Happy day.

531
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,837
What kind of treatments,
Kathryn?

532
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:39,879
Please tell me
you have an ulcer.

533
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:44,250
Tell me you have a bad back.

534
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,120
What is it, Kathryn?

535
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,557
Chemotherapy?

536
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,863
Kat, I'm sorry, I...

537
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,365
You told Tom?

538
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:01,267
No, I didn't.

539
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,402
Michael, did you know?

540
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,011
(WHISPERING) How dare you.

541
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:15,047
How dare you not tell me!

543
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,485

544

This will kill me.

545
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:24,423
Oh, no. No, you do not.

546
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:27,026
You do not make my crisis
your personal agony.

547
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,896
Oh, God, did you hear that?

548
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:33,365
She just acknowledged
that I might have some
feelings about this.

549
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,601
No, Mother, I know that
you have feelings.

550

There isn't a mammal in
the northern hemisphere

551
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,339
that isn't personally
acquainted with your feelings.

552
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,108
Sylvia, why don't...
Why don't you just
give us a moment?

553
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:45,177
Oh, my God,
I'm so sick of both of you.

and here it is.

556
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:51,017
This is my disease,
do you see?

557
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,019
And I'm going to handle it
the way I want to.

out between verdicts,
I'm going to do that.

going to take your grandmother
to the courthouse

564

in the morning.

come back in the morning.

about your...

need a friend

to sit and
listen to you complain
about how unfair life is.

it was anything else.

want to help?
Of course.

What do you mean?

863
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:26,764
I mean, what's going on?

864
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:28,833
What's the rush?

865
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:32,737
What happened
with Houston?

866
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,212
Houston was an experiment.

867
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,984
When were you
gonna tell me that?

868
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:48,619
I know, I'm sorry.

869
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:50,287
You wait until
I'm in a room with Dad...
I'm sorry.

870
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,289
And then you dump that on me?
I wish I could
do this differently.

871
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,959
Do what, Mom?
What are you
trying to do?

872
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:57,828
Get it out in the open,
the three of us.
No.

873
00:59:57,862 --> 01:00:00,264
No, I am not going to be
a part of that. Okay?

874
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:02,066
He is trying to take
advantage of you

875
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,868
at the worst time
in your life.

876
01:00:03,901 --> 01:00:05,770
He's trying to help.

877
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:07,938
He's trying to clear
his conscience.

878
01:00:07,972 --> 01:00:10,107
This has nothing
to do with him.

879
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:18,115
This isn't about him.

880
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,219
Mom, you're not
making any sense.

881
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:32,096
Your dad and I...

882
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:38,736
Your dad and I...

883
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:47,845
I think we always
believed in the same
things, you know?

884
01:00:47,878 --> 01:00:50,681
I know we did,
I know we did, but...

885
01:00:50,715 --> 01:00:54,685
We never could get there
in the same way.

886
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:57,722
It wore me out.

887
01:00:57,755 --> 01:00:59,957
I just did not
have his stamina.

888
01:01:04,028 --> 01:01:07,397
When I left,
and you came with me, he...

889
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:10,100
He became the person
that you hardly ever saw.

890
01:01:10,134 --> 01:01:12,803
So you started to resent him,
that was only natural.

891
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:15,906
But, Michael,
I saw what was happening.

892
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:20,277
I saw it and I took
advantage of it.

893
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,750
You were a little kid.

894
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:29,219
You wanted
a black and white picture
and I gave you one.

895
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:34,458
You see what I'm saying?

896
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:41,832
No. No.

897
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:44,902
All my life
you've been telling me what
a bastard he is, okay,

898
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:47,404
you're not just gonna
change your mind now.
Michael.

899
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:49,840
Leave me alone.
Both of you!

900
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:05,022
I never said
he made me sick.
I know that.

901
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:10,394
How could he have
thought that all these years?

902
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:12,429
I don't know,
you'll have to ask him.

903
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,767
Oh, he won't talk to me
about that, you know that.

904
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:18,936
I'm sure you'll find a way.

so typical...

I've always loved that place.

to take me there for years.

of that, Your Honor.

a single thing right now.

how to give up.

gonna get some place
I'll never see.

Don't be so dramatic.

No, but it sure gives me
leverage in the conversation.

I'm gonna let you
win an argument

the big C, do you?

win the argument.

01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:57,567
Let's take turns.

1037
01:13:58,101 --> 01:13:59,569
Me first.

1038
01:14:03,707 --> 01:14:06,810
To the finest judge
I've ever argued before.

Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

1040
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:11,080
Here.

(LAUGHING)

1042
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,231
You're in a shoe store
and someone starts...
No!

1043
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:31,134
Tell me that you're not
going to be terrified...
No!

1044

(ALL LAUGHING)

1045
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:39,175
I just want to say to you all

1046
01:14:41,044 --> 01:14:43,146
thank you so much

1047
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:44,948
for being friends
to my daughter.

(CAT MEOWS)
Why do I keep
feeding you guys?

1049
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:05,034
You're big as a house.

1050
01:15:05,935 --> 01:15:08,237
You're going on a diet.

1051
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:10,139
Less-active kitties.

1052
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,676
SYLVIA: Well...

1053
01:15:13,309 --> 01:15:14,844
There you are.

1054
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:17,280
Hi, Mamaw. I just came
to check on the kitties.

1055
01:15:21,217 --> 01:15:22,819
(SIGHS) Well...

1056
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:27,223
You might as well
take them on home with you.

01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:42,005
Life doesn't happen to us
in the right order.

1060
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:47,611
I'm scared, too.

1061
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:50,279
But we must do what
we're called upon to do.

1062

You're mother's going
down that road,

1063
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,221
whether we go
with her or not.

1064
01:16:01,024 --> 01:16:03,192
The only thing
we can do for her now,

1065
01:16:05,361 --> 01:16:07,597
that will matter to her,

1066
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:11,134
is to be with her.

This really will be
better, Tom.

1071
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:37,961
I can put her
roll-away in the room.

1072
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:40,363
There are no
visiting hours.

1073

No.

1078
01:18:48,024 --> 01:18:49,092
Soon.

1079
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:55,899

the dogwoods.

Hey, Mom.

1082
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:39,909
I went and got
Archibald and Mehitabel.

1083
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:43,779
Two wuss cats
if I ever saw one.

1084
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:47,984
And I saw Riley,
my landlord.

1085
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:52,321
Her old calico kitty cat
is queen of the dumpster.

1086
01:19:52,355 --> 01:19:55,859
And Archibald and Mehitabel
are scared to death of her.

I'm just gonna sit here
for a while, Mom.

Okay?

I'm just gonna
sit here with you.

Hmm.

1091
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,208
What, baby?

1092
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,243
What are you saying?

going to sleep?

Right here, darling.

right here.

1102
01:22:42,658 --> 01:22:44,160
Yes, baby.

1103
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:48,431
We'll all sleep there.

Really?

1106
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:05,174
I think
we should take her.

1107
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,076
Well, we could check
with Dr. Hurley.

1108
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,245
I mean now.

1109
01:24:11,114 --> 01:24:13,582
I mean, what are they
gonna do, arrest us?

1110
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:17,720
I'm sure there's some
liability issue about it,
it could be tricky.

I don't know.

1112

The staff around here
doesn't exactly seem
like the A-Team.

1113

the term graveyard shift.

Monday, February 12th...

1117
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:44,380
So, do you have family?
My children are grown.

1118
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:45,814
Grandchildren?

1119
01:24:45,848 --> 01:24:48,384
Three.
Really? I'm the only one.

1120
01:24:49,152 --> 01:24:50,619
Grandchild, that is.

1121
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:53,356
I'm the only child,
for that matter.

My, isn't that the
prettiest shade of
lipstick you're wearing.

1123

What do you call that?
Natural.

1124
01:24:59,328 --> 01:25:01,464
Really?
Where do you get that?

1125
01:25:01,497 --> 01:25:03,266
I was born with it.

1126
01:25:06,235 --> 01:25:07,536
Nice lips.

Will you marry me?

01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:54,377
It's okay.

1134
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:55,878
It's okay, Kat.

really okay with me

1141
01:28:43,452 --> 01:28:44,587
Yeah.

1143
01:29:02,104 --> 01:29:03,472
Where you going?

1144
01:29:03,506 --> 01:29:05,374
Expressway's the shortest.

1145
01:29:05,408 --> 01:29:07,109
It's gonna be jammed.

1146
01:29:07,142 --> 01:29:09,812
All right, we'll use
the diamond lane.

1147
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:11,514
It's a three person lane.

1148
01:29:11,547 --> 01:29:14,082
That's right.

1149
01:29:14,116 --> 01:29:16,885
Ticket's like
400 hundred dollars.
Mmm-hmm.

1150
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:21,590
One, two, three.

1151
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:24,960
Oh, that's sick.

1152
01:29:24,993 --> 01:29:26,662
What if we get stopped?

1153
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:29,565
I'm promise you,
they're not gonna
check her pulse.

KATHRYN: Oh, God,
this is so typical.

1155
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:48,116
You know, Bruce's brother
tried to put a hat and coat
on his Great Dane once.
