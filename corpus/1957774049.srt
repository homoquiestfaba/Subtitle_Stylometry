1
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,800
(thunder cracking)

2
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,967
- [Jennifer Voiceover]
Maybe this isn't happening.

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,500
Maybe it's only a dream.

4
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:03,800
Just lie down in the cool,
dark water.

5
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:08,567
Just lie down, close your eyes,

6
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,367
and it will all be over soon.

7
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:16,934
(ominous music)

8
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,667
When did it all start
to fall apart?

9
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:34,700
(dramatic synth music)

10
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,500
How did it all go to hell?

11
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,367
(film projector clicking)

12
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:48,900
(moaning)

13
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,667
- Yes, oh, oh!

14
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,400
Oh yes, oh yes!

15
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:53,533
Oh yeah!

16
00:01:53,567 --> 00:01:56,633
Oh my god, oh, I didn't
know it would be like this.

17
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:57,834
- You do now, baby.

18
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,100
Live to ride, ride to live.

19
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,300
- Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah!

20
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,934
Oh yeah, give it to me!

21
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:03,934
(moaning)

22
00:02:03,967 --> 00:02:06,200
Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah!

23
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:08,633
Oh yeah, give it to me!

24
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:11,300
- [Jessica] What are you doing,
Jennifer?

25
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,567
(suspenseful music)

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,433
- Jessica?

27
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:20,767
Help her, somebody help her!

28
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,767
(yelps)

29
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:29,066
- Cut, cut cut!

30
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,934
What the fuck is this?

31
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,533
(sobbing)

32
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:37,934
(screaming)

33
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:39,400
- Let me go!

34
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,500
Okay, I'm sorry!

35
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,934
I'm sorry!

36
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,900
(water dripping)

37
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,567
(laughing)

38
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:04,600
(ominous music)

39
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:23,200
(sobbing)

40
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,900
(giggling)

41
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,667
- [Denver] How are you
feeling today, Jennifer?

42
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:58,934
- Wonderful.

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,166
- Yes, that persurambrals,
terrific stuff.

44
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,300
Truly the state of the art
in antipsychotic medicine.

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,600
It appears that a Mr. Nasty Nat

46
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,467
is dropping all criminal
charges against you.

47
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,333
- Who?

48
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:25,900
- The little fellow whose
testicles you ruptured,

49
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:28,400
and whose corneas you scratched.

50
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,133
- Oh, him.

51
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,066
- The only matter that
hasn't been resolved

52
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,367
to my satisfaction,

53
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:40,867
outside of your deeply-ingrained
sexual compulsions,

54
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,633
which led to this
highly questionable

55
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,900
and dubious form of employment,

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,934
regards the words you
screamed out

57
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:58,066
at the end of your
latest episode.

58
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,233
You said,

59
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,834
half a second, "Help her."

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,166
"Help her."
When asked by the police

61
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:14,467
to whom you were referring,
you claimed to have no

62
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,233
recollection of uttering this at
all.

63
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:22,800
- That's true, I can't
remember any of it.

64
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,467
- What do you think you meant?

65
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,333
- Jessica.

66
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:29,100
I don't know.

67
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,800
- Help whom, Jennifer?

68
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:39,967
Help whom?

69
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,633
- Myself.

70
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,066
I must have been crying
out for help,

71
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,433
and here I am now, helped.

72
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,133
- (sighs) Jennifer.

73
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:58,767
How long has it been
since you spent some time

74
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,700
with your parents?

75
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,533
- Two, three years.

76
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,100
- I've been in touch with them.

77
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,000
They've agreed to
take care of you.

78
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:17,867
I think they'd be a good
influence on you

79
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,300
at this point in your life.

80
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,433
I know I'd feel comfortable

81
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,734
signing your release
under those circumstances.

82
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,233
- That would be for the best.

83
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:36,734
- Then it's settled.

84
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,400
You promise, take your
medicine like a good girl?

85
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,967
(laughs)

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,867
- Yes, Doctor, absolutely.

87
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,100
I'll be a very good girl.

88
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,433
- Then I'm gonna take a
chance on you, a big chance.

89
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,600
Don't let us down, Jennifer.

90
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:12,233

can't go back.

111
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:30,900
I won't.

112
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,233
(ominous music)

113
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:34,100
I won't.

114
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:42,467
(cackling)

115
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,467
Those are not my
parents anymore.

116
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,166
That's not my house.

117
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,233
I don't belong here.

118
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:30,000
(relaxing music)

119
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,500
- Hey, how you doing?

120
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,467
(chuckles) Yeah.

121
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,934
Look, hey, pussy, pussy,
pussycat.

122
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,200
Come on, girl.

123
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,934
(growls)

124
00:10:43,967 --> 00:10:45,066
- Fuck off!

125
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,367
(whooping)

126
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,233
- Come on!

127
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:53,166
Yeah, come on, get over.

128
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:07,200
(engine sputters)

129
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,667
(whooping)

130
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,533
Yeah!

131
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,233
(whooping)

132
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,300
Yeah!
- Get that, boy!

133
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,400
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

134
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,166
- Go!
- Come on!

135
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,400
Yeah, I got her!

136
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:54,200
I got the trail now!

137
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,400
- Go on, Robert!
- Shake your leg,

138
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:56,467
girl, ain't you?

139
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,667
Yeah.
- Here we go, here we go.

140
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,633
- Ain't nothing wrong with her.

141
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:01,266
- Run away, little girl!

142
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,066
- Teach you to fire up, yeah!

143
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,367
(whooping)

144
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,166
Come on, baby girl!
- We got a good one today.

145
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,033
Yeah, come on, Robert!

146
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,100
- Oh yeah.
- All right.

147
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:23,300
(cackling)

148
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,834
Don't you look
precious like that?

149
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:29,433
- She don't look like
a naughty girl at all.

150
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:31,533
- Lucky we know better.

151
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,367
- Ain't it, though?

152
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,834
(engine revs)

153
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,734
(whooping)

154
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,633
- Violence Onelove in
the high desert!

155
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:44,867
- Guilty Karma on safari!

156
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,166
(energetic rock music)

157
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,934
(shouting)

158
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
- What happened to those guys?

159
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:28,467
- We ran them straight to hell.

160
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,700
How's that sound to you?

161
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:31,467
- Delightful.

162
00:13:32,533 --> 00:13:33,633
- Oh, you're bleeding.

163
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,200
- Thanks.

164
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,567
- Looks like the desert
almost gobbled you up.

165
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,934
- Yeah, they ran my car into
a ditch, and it won't start.

166
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,367
- You poor thing.

167
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,567
People these days,
they're just animals.

168
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,667
They're just animals.

169
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,633
Huh.

170
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:57,667
- What?

171
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:00,133
- I don't mean to stare,

172
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:03,934
but I've never seen eyes
quite like that before.

173
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,200
How would you
describe that color?

174
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:08,133
Dolphin magic green?

175
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,734
- Dolphin magic?

176
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:12,767
- It's what they remind me of,

177
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,400
the Mediterranean Sea at dawn,

178
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,033
shimmering liquid magic.

179
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,367
- I've never been to the
Mediterranean before.

180
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:25,934
- Neither have I, and now
I don't have to.

181
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,800
- I can't believe this.

182
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,166
My clothes are destroyed.

183
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,734
I'm in the middle of the desert.

184
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,800
What am I supposed to do?

185
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,367
- You're asking me?

186
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,700
- Yeah.

187
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:42,200
No, I don't know.

188
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,767
- Look, you can stay
with us tonight.

189
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,767
We'll drive you into town
in the morning.

190
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,166
- Oh, thanks, but I'd rather...

191
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,066
Oh wait, wait.

192
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,400
First thing in the morning?

193
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:56,600
- First thing.

194
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,300
- Oh, my medicine's in the car.

195
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,400
- Oh, don't worry about
that, I'll go get that.

196
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:05,467
In the meantime, Violence
and Guilty here

197
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,166
will escort you back
to base camp.

198
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,033
What's your name?

199
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,734
- Jennifer.

200
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,100
- Jennifer.

201
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:22,500
It's all right, sugar,
we won't bite.

202
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:23,367
- We won't?

203
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:27,567
(eerie music)

204
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,133
- Where are you guys from?

205
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,166
- Same place you're from,
cosmic oneness, baby.

206
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,500
- That's where we begin,
and where we end up.

207
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:01,200
Everything else in-between
is just a joke.

208
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,333
Just a big joke.

209
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,700
That's what Damon says.

210
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,066
- Damon?

211
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,867
- He's on fire all the time!

212
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,734
Char-boiled black with the glory

213
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,934
of the unspeakable word.

214
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:18,834
- Roasting from the inside
out, and the outside in.

215
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:22,934
Emerging in perfect grace,

216
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,700
as white as bone.

217
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,433
- Is it much farther to camp?

218
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:32,000
(laughing)

219
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:34,867
You guys.

220
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:36,734
You guys, wait up!

221
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,600
Wait up, you guys!

222
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:51,166
(psychedelic rock music)

223
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,734
- Fuck.

224
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,066
- Doc Warlock, you're one
son of a bitch.

225
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
- Have I said soup's on yet?

226
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,633
Did anybody hear me say
soup's on yet?

227
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:11,266
(wolf howling)

228
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,700
What do you know?

229
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,367
(giggling)

230
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,934
- Oh, that one is Jennifer.

231
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:23,133
She's just a little wee rabbit
we snatched from some snakes.

232
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,467
- Poor you, you're trembling.

233
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:29,734
Are you cold?

234
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:34,400
Someone get her a blanket.

235
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:35,767
Nobody ever listens to
me around here.

236
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,700
I'll get it, okay.

237
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,066
Oh, don't you worry about
a thing, not a thing.

238
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,233
We're gonna take good
care of you.

239
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,467
Oh, yes, siree.

240
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,633
(gentle strumming)

241
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,567
- Oh, you don't have to do that,
really.

242
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,633
- Oh, no, no, but I want to.

243
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,533
Let me fix you up, I
used to have this dolly

244
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:08,900
that I used to fix up
all the time.

245
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:11,133
I don't have that dolly anymore.

246
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:13,533
Are you warm enough?

247
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,533
(engine rumbling)

248
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,333
(rattling)

249
00:18:49,367 --> 00:18:50,367
- Oh, my medicine.

250
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:53,467
- Can't be too
careful with those.

251
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:57,734
Is this gonna make me puke?

252
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:58,600
- Certainly.

253
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,400
Anybody else up for a
little liquid bliss?

254
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,567
- What is it?

255
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,300
- Strength, freedom, and
a whole lot of peyote.

256
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,266
- Is that celery in there?

257
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,400
If it is, I can't drink it,
I'm so allergic to celery.

258
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:32,967
- It's not celery.

259
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,200
- And is that chicken?

260
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,800
I'm a strict vegetarian.

261
00:19:36,834 --> 00:19:38,467
- It's not chicken.

262
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,867
- I am sort of starving.

263
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,367
(ominous music)

264
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,433
What's in that stuff?

265
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:55,333
- Everything wonderful
under the sun.

266
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,967
(warbling)

267
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:43,066
Let's go listen to
Cassandra now.

268
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,200
Come on.

269
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:48,200
Come on.

270
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:55,400
- There are places on Earth

271
00:20:57,133 --> 00:21:00,533
that are simply unclean.

272
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,133
Sometimes it's a whole city,

273
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:14,133
like Sodom or Gomorrah.

274
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,567
And sometimes it's dust,

275
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,734
divel scratch in the
middle of nowhere.

276
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,900
Everybody's talking
about that McCartel girl.

277
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,934
How she's been wandering
around for a week

278
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:37,567
with half her skull missing,

279
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,667
and maggots chewing on
her brain meat.

280
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,567
Everybody knows about that.

281
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,834
But there's lots of things
they ain't talking about.

282
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:52,900
They won't talk about.

283
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,266
The house on the edge
of the woods.

284
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:04,367
They won't discuss what
happens to people

285
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:08,100
who get within a minute
of that place.

286
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:13,000
They taste ripe hell.

287
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
The man who built that house,

288
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,700
he died within six weeks
of when it was finished.

289
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:31,066
Oh, they found him, all tucked
up nice and cozy in his bed.

290
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:37,800
Drained of all his bodily
fluids, and sloppily neutered.

291
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,700
After that, his wife
went a'kilter.

292
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:47,867
She took to copulating in
public with dogs and mules.

293
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:53,133
Had to send her away.

294
00:22:57,934 --> 00:23:01,500
And then that house was empty

295
00:23:01,533 --> 00:23:04,033
for years and years.

296
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:07,233
(eerie music)

297
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:11,867
But cities get crowded,
and somehow,

298
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:16,467
three whores from San
Antone got ahold of it.

299
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,867
They were just knocking
boots in the boudoir

300
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,734
and slobbering pigs in the barn.

301
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,233
But then there was talk.

302
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,200
Ugly talk.

303
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:37,633
Now some said, some said that,

304
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:41,867
that them whores were out there,

305
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,400
dancing in the woods,
chanting hey, na, na, na.

306
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,166
Chanting odes

307
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,500
to their noxious dark gods.

308
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:59,400
The preacher's son, he
turned up missing.

309
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:03,066
The town folk saw bloody red,

310
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:07,066
and they marched
straight up there,

311
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,200
and delivered their
country brand of justice!

312
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:14,734
They took them whores,
stripped them naked,

313
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:18,066
tore in their flesh with
their meat hooks,

314
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,233
and stringing them up
by their ankles,

315
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:23,133
smoked them like swine!

316
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,767
- Those poor whores.

317
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,000
Those poor, poor whores.

318
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,700
- Stay away.

319
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:33,100
Stay away, stay away.

320
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:38,066
'Cause it is evil, that
place is evil.

321
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,233
Pure evil!

322
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,133
- Oh, where is it?
- Is it far from here?

323
00:24:43,166 --> 00:24:47,734
- Nah, just north a
ways on Highway 9.

324
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,600
Been abandoned for years now.

325
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:57,567
Years and years.

326
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,834
(coughing)

327
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,867
- [Damon] There, there,
get it all out.

328
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:07,867
That's right.

329
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:10,000
That's right.

330
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:23,166
- I feel funny,

331
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,800
like I'm floating in
outer space or something.

332
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:30,400
- You are.

333
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:31,567
We're all spinning
through the galaxy

334
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,467
at a million miles per second.

335
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,767
Can you feel it?

336
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,200
Just try, Jennifer.

337
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:37,533
Just try.

338
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:38,934
- I think I can, I think I can.

339
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:44,667
- Open up your mind and senses
to what's really going on.

340
00:25:45,567 --> 00:25:46,400
- I'm scared.

341
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,133
- That's just the fear.

342
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,367
That's just you
admitting to yourself

343
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,200
that you don't know
anything at all.

344
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,166
Anything.

345
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,200
- I don't know if I can take it,
I just...

346
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:03,100
I want it to stop.

347
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,800
- You can't stop life, Jennifer.

348
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:09,300
Not even a coffin will
keep you safe.

349
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,967
I want you to do something
for me right now, could you?

350
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Take this.

351
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:16,767
Take it.

352
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,967
I want you to open up my heart.

353
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,033
- No!
- I want you to open up

354
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:23,600
my heart.

355
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:24,834
- No!
- So you can open up

356
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:25,967
your heart to me.
- No!

357
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,667
I can't do that, no!

358
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,734
No!

359
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:32,166
(ominous music)

360
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,033
No!

361
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:02,166
(psychedelic rock music)

362
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,367

00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:16,700
- Guess that's how they
grow them in Los Angeles.

367
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,367
Folks up there think
they can just stock up

368
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,834
and toss it away like so
much stinking garbage.

369
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,600
Like so much stinking garbage.

370
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:32,467
Just look at this pump.

371
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,667
Like it ever did anything to you

372
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,767
besides keep your coils cool.

373
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,767
Mother of god.

374
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,500
- Look, can you fix it or not?

375
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,000
- Some of it.

376
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:44,233
- Will it run?

377
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,767
- Oh, it'll run.

378
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,633
- How much?

379
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:53,233
- $300.
- What?

380
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:55,633
- Maybe a little more,
I can't tell quite yet.

381
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,867
- Can you at least have
it done today?

382
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,633
- Let's see.

383
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:08,800
Gonna run to Sioux City to
pick up a new alternator.

384
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,400
Trans is gonna have to
be completely rebuilt.

385
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,934
I would say a week.

386
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,166
- A week!

387
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,100
- [Reporter] There are still
no suspects in the string

388
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,567
of brutal killings which
have taken place

389
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,533
across the state of
California recently.

390
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:24,633
Police are now saying that
there appears to be a connection

391
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,567
between these slayings and
the Hollywood homicides

392
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,867
which occurred in Los Angeles,
but refused to elaborate.

393
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,100
- Well, it's not like you
have anywhere special to be.

394
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,033
- I guess not.

395
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:38,433
But my parents, they're
still expecting me.

396
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:42,066
- Here's a dime,
there's the phone.

397
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,633
- I don't really have a choice,
do I?

398
00:29:44,667 --> 00:29:45,900
- Nope.

399
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:49,266
(classic country music)

400
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:53,934
- Hey there, buddy.

401
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:55,633
You know how to get
to Highway 9?

402
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,667
- [Jennifer's Mom] Hello?

403
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,133
Who is this?

404
00:30:04,033 --> 00:30:07,100
- [Sabbath] Come on, Jennifer,
come on!

405
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,400
- [Jennifer's Mom] Jennifer?

406
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,967
Jennifer, baby, is that you?

407
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,834
- Jennifer!
- Jennifer, speak to me,

408
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:15,266
is that you?

409
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,967
- [Sabbath] Come on!

410
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,100
- [Jennifer's Mom] Jennifer,
please--

411
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:31,133
(foreboding music)

412
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,700
- Here.

413
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:38,900
- Oh, I don't know if I should.

414
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:40,700
It might not react well
with my medicine.

415
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:42,934
- Well how many pills
did you take?

416
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:45,066
- Two.
- Then take two tokes,

417
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,967
everything will balance
out that way.

418
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,100
Did you know that
everybody's on drugs?

419
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,734
Yeah, everybody's on something.

420
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:01,633
Hey!

421
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:02,934
- Use it or lose it.

422
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,433
- [Westy] Hey, look
what's on TV.

423
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:25,700
- [Doc] Shall we?

424
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,333
(laughing)

425
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:47,567
- Hallelujah, going my way?

426
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,667
(laughing)
- Hop in.

427
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,066
- So step inside, my brother,
step inside.

428
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,834
You a man of God, Mister?

429
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,667
- Reverend, Reverend
Rich Drixel.

430
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,000
Yes, indeed, I am.

431
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:08,266
I'm just a leaf of the
lord blowing with the wind,

432
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,567
spreading the good news
along the way.

433
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,633
- We sure could use some good
news right about now, huh?

434
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,800
I mean, I'm as white as
Mary's ass, but these kids,

435
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:21,166
hoowee, I think they're
going straight to hell.

436
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
I really, really do.

437
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,066
- Well surely there's no
reason for anyone

438
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,233
to go to the lake of fire.

439
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:28,934
- There's not?

440
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,667
- No, sir, all you have to
do is accept Jesus Christ

441
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,734
as your lord and savior,
and you can save yourself

442
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:35,934
from eternal damnation.

443
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:39,900
- That's it?
- That's it.

444
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:44,000
- Huh, that sounds great,
really fabulous.

445
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:45,066
I'm in for sure.

446
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,066
What about you guys,
you in on this?

447
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,567
- Absolutely.

448
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,200
I don't want no demon
sticking pitchforks up my ass.

449
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,133
- Let me get this straight.

450
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:58,133
All I have to do is accept
Jesus as my personal savior,

451
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,834
and I get wings and a
harp and all that,

452
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:01,367
my own little cloud in Heaven?

453
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,567
- That's right.

454
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,800
- And you can guarantee that?

455
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:07,900
- It's all here, guaranteed
in writing, by golly,

456
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:09,967
and the day of
redemption is at hand.

457
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,834
All signs point to it.

458
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:13,400
- Good enough for me, I'm in.

459
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,033
- What about you ladies?

460
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:19,367
You want a piece of this
action or what?

461
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,066
- I've already been baptized,
twice.

462
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:25,166
- Okay, that covers you, then.

463
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,033
Guilty?

464
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:29,500
- My grandmother was a
Cherokee priestess.

465
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:34,500
- All right, that
takes care of you.

466
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:37,200
Sabbath, you wanna be saved?

467
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:39,667
- Hell yes. (giggles)

468
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:43,867
- That just leaves you,
Jennifer.

469
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,667
- Oh, I don't know,

470
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,767
I've done a lot of things
I'm ashamed of.

471
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,233
I made my first blue movie
when I was just 15 years old.

472
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,166
- Have you ever fucked a
complete stranger, Reverend?

473
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,533
- No, I have not.

474
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,100
- Is that a sin?

475
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,633
- It better not be.

476
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,433
I've been doing that
since Camp Winniehahoo.

477
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:05,066
- Please stop the van.

478
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,033
(laughing)
I'd like to get out now.

479
00:34:08,066 --> 00:34:09,867
Did you hear me, stop the van!

480
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,567
I'd like to get out!

481
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:13,967
Stop right now!

482
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,834
Did you hear me?

483
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,367
My bible, my bible!

484
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,800
Stop, thieves, you
took my bible!

485
00:34:33,834 --> 00:34:36,533
I've got your license
plate number, you freaks!

486
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:48,133
- Hey, Westy?

487
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,233
You wanna take care of this?

488
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:53,934
(ominous music)

489
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:28,033
- Figured maybe you'd need
this after all.

490
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,633
(foreboding music)

491
00:35:59,233 --> 00:36:00,133
- Oh no.

492
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:04,133
Oh no, what happened to you?

493
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:07,867
I'll take your feet
and your hands,

494
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,800
and we're gonna put you
back together again.

495
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:14,333
Don't you worry, it'll be okay.

496
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:16,633
It'll be okay, Mr. Monster.

Is it too Scorpio?

Come on, make up your

Oh my.

509
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:22,333
I must have had a bad dream,
I guess.

510
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,500
- I guess.

511
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:26,166
- If you can't handle
your stuff, sister...

512
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,033
- Leave her alone, haven't you
ever had a bad dream before?

513
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:30,166
- You're a bad dream.

514
00:37:31,033 --> 00:37:32,066
- Yeah, yeah.

515
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,233
- Isn't that the
reverend's bible?

516
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,133
I thought we were gonna
give it to him.

517
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:45,800
- Oh, we gave it to him,
all right.

518
00:37:45,834 --> 00:37:48,066
(giggling)

519
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,500
(eerie music)

520
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:20,967
- [Westy] Which way should I go,
Damon?

521
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,800
- [Damon] Left, always left.

522
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,867
- Wee!
- Ride them, cowboy.

523
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,967
- I just peed myself and
I'm not kidding.

524
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:43,266
- Where the bloody hell
is this place, anyway?

525
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:48,300
- Yeah, I'm antsy and horny and
I don't even know what else.

526
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:54,066
- [Damon] There it is.

527
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,834
- It's locked.

528
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,233
- So go around and check it out.

529
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:33,667
And don't break any windows
if you don't have to!

530
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,600
(glass shattering)

531
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:45,667
(knocks)
- Come on, guys,

532
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,533
let me in.

533
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:48,400
Come on!

534
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:50,200
- What's up, Westerman?

535
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,467
- [Sabbath] I know
you're in there.

536
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,100
- This place gives me the
heebie jeebies.

537
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:56,767
- We spent 72 hours laying
low in a hospital morgue

538
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,233
and this dump freaks you out?

539
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:02,033
(foreboding music)

540
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:18,967

00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:22,333
(yelps)
(giggles)

542
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,734
- Isn't this place
just the most?

543
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:25,700
- Not fair!

544
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:32,166
This way!

545
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,033
- This'll be our room.

546
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:40,333
We're gonna have the best
time of our whole lives,

547
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:41,433
I just know it.

548
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:46,000
- What do you think?

549
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:47,400
- It stinks of rot.

550
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:49,500
And madness.

551
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:51,367
- I like it.

552
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:56,600
(gentle guitar music)

553
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,300
- Oh, are you okay?

554
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,734
- Yeah.
- Maybe two tokes

555
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:01,834
was too much.

556
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,967
You know, Jennifer is
such a nice name.

557
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,200
It's the kind of name
that a girl has

558
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:16,800
and everybody likes her, and
she always has a boyfriend.

559
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,333
- What's your real name?

560
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:27,533
- Well, my Christian
name is Delores,

561
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:29,367
but Damon would have
none of that.

562
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:33,667
- What did your parents
think about Sabbath Jones?

563
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:37,000
- They don't know Sabbath Jones.

564
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:41,433
I got out of that house
as fast as I could,

565
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:46,200
find that ultra groovy street
scene I heard so much about.

566
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,333
- Well did you?

567
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:50,500
- It found me.

568
00:41:52,934 --> 00:41:56,300
I was really messed up
when Damon found me.

569
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:02,033
He's never asked me to do
anything like

570
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,166
all the other guys.
Not a single thing.

571
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,033
What about you?

572
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,233
- Oh, I had parents once,

573
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:13,000
but they went away when
my sister died,

574
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:17,033
and left these awful old
people in their place.

575
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:19,400
- How'd she die?

576
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:21,367
- She drowned.

577
00:42:23,033 --> 00:42:25,200
- She drowned?
- Yeah.

578
00:42:25,233 --> 00:42:26,700
That's a terrible way to die.

579
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:28,800
- Yeah, we were arguing
about something,

580
00:42:28,834 --> 00:42:31,967
and she took off, you
know how kids are,

581
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,800
and when I came back,
she was drowned.

582
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,834
- Do you miss her?

583
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:41,333
- Oh, terribly, every
second of every day.

584
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:45,166
It's like we had our own
secret language,

585
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,433
and she was the only person

586
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:50,100
that I could really
ever talk to.

587
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:53,967
- I'd like to have a
secret language.

588
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,834
- Yeah.

589
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,000
- Yeah.

590
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:58,867
- What is that?

591
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,133
- That's just our mark.

592
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
- What does it mean?

593
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:07,867
- I guess it means
we're a family now.

594
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,166
Hush.

595
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,033
Don't think anymore
about anything.

596
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:28,667
(shouting)

597
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:33,433
(gentle guitar music)

598
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:51,233
- I didn't know there were
still people like you out there.

599
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:52,500
- [Damon] People like us?

600
00:43:52,533 --> 00:43:53,367
- Yeah.

601
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,900
Real life flower children.

602
00:43:57,834 --> 00:43:59,867
- Well there are, and a lot more

603
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,834
than most people would
like to believe.

604
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:06,033
- Why aren't you in there?

605
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:07,633
- Me, what about you?

606
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:11,333
- I asked you first. (giggles)

607
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:12,767
- Cripples don't like water.

608
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,567
- How long have you
needed those?

609
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,533
- Since I was a kid.

610
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:21,867
Doctors told Mom I was
the very last Polio victim

611
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,667
of my generation.

612
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,700
That I was chosen by God.

613
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:29,967
- And you believed that?

614
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,100
- Yes.

615
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:38,400
- Jennifer, I need you,
Jennifer, come on!

616
00:44:38,433 --> 00:44:39,266
Jennifer!

617
00:44:41,033 --> 00:44:42,433
(whooping)

618
00:44:42,467 --> 00:44:43,133
- Go on.

619
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:46,333
This day isn't gonna
last forever, you know.

620
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,166
Go on.

621
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,467
(ominous music)

622
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:17,900
(gentle guitar music)

623
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,066
(shouting)

624
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,233
- [Jennifer Voiceover] I
can do anything I want.

625
00:45:42,266 --> 00:45:44,333
I can stay here in these
woods forever.

626
00:45:57,567 --> 00:46:00,133
(eerie music)

627
00:46:15,433 --> 00:46:18,333
(locusts chirping)

628
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:23,867
- [Whispering Voice] Jennifer.

629
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,266
- You were supposed to
be watching each other!

630
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,233
- You were supposed to
be watching each other!

631
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:30,033
That's what you're here for!

632
00:46:30,066 --> 00:46:32,834
- [Jennifer] I'm not
the bad one.

633
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:37,934
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not!

634
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,734
I'm the good one!

635
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,033
I'm the good one!

636
00:46:44,066 --> 00:46:46,400
(splashing)

637
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,600
- [Guilty] The fuck?

638
00:46:56,633 --> 00:46:58,900
(laughing)

639
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:05,667
Some people just don't know
how to have a good time!

640
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,567
- You said it, sister.

641
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,266
(ominous music)

642
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:29,700
- [Whispering Voice]
Come with us.

643
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,200
Jennifer.

644
00:47:35,367 --> 00:47:37,133
Jennifer.

645
00:47:42,367 --> 00:47:44,700
Jennifer.

646
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,967
- Should've done her
right in the desert.

647
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,100
She's not one of us.

648
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:55,233
- She is, that's the
whole problem.

649
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:28,567
(gentle music)

650
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:00,967
(eerie music)

651
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,667
(child giggling)

652
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:41,233
(gasps)

653
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:43,934
(ominous music)

654
00:52:19,633 --> 00:52:21,200
- This isn't a dream, you know.

655
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,834
It would be wonderful if
you could just wake up,

656
00:52:28,867 --> 00:52:32,200
but there's only this,
and death.

657
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,033
- Have you seen my friend?

658
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,266
- Yes.

659
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,633
But they saw her first.

660
00:53:00,633 --> 00:53:01,600
- [Jennifer] Sabbath?

661
00:53:01,633 --> 00:53:03,000
- No, no, she's resting.

662
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:05,033
She's at peace.

663
00:53:05,967 --> 00:53:07,700
You're the one that
needs to worry.

664
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:10,533
They don't like you.

665
00:53:11,934 --> 00:53:13,166
Not like they like me.

666
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,133
I'm an entertainer.

667
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:18,467
Would you like to see?

668
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,000
Lights, music, please.

669
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:25,133
(eerie circus music)

670
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:28,433
(humming)
(applauding)

671
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:30,233
You see, they love me.

672
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:42,233
Let's see how I make them smile.

673
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:48,734
(grunts)

674
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:26,467
(splashing)

675
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:57,734
- Sabbath?

676
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:02,200
(flies buzzing)

677
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:03,066
Sabbath?

678
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,967
(ominous music)

679
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:12,133
(gasps)

680
00:55:16,266 --> 00:55:17,934
- What goes on here?

681
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,000
- Oh, that's nice,
that's really nice.

682
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,467
- It wasn't me.

683
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,967
I swear it wasn't me, really,
it was...

684
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:42,400
It was the man in the hat,
and I hit him with the rock.

685
00:55:42,433 --> 00:55:43,333
- The man in the hat?

686
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,600
What kind of hat did he have?

687
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:51,667
- It was a tall, flat,
funny hat,

688
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,967
and it just floated
down the stream.

689
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:57,600
- Merrily?

690
00:56:00,633 --> 00:56:01,266
- What?

691
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:04,166
- Did it float merrily
down the stream, Jennifer,

692
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,200
or did it just kinda float?

693
00:56:06,233 --> 00:56:07,700
- No, I have to go away.

694
00:56:07,734 --> 00:56:11,333
I have to get back,
gotta go back!

695
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,567
- [Damon] What does that mean,
back?

696
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,300
Back where?

697
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:17,066
What's back there that
you're not running away from

698
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,333
as fast as you can, Jennifer?

699
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:33,133
Damn fine handiwork, actually.

700
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:36,000
- What happened, Sabbath?

701
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,467
Come on, talk to me, baby doll.

702
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,100
- [Guilty] Oh, corpses
can't talk, silly.

703
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,834
- Yes, they can.

704
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:45,667
- How?

705
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,467
- A seance.

706
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,867
- Yes, let's hold a seance.

707
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,800
- That's a damn fine idea.

708
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:53,033
It'll be just like making
a collect call

709
00:56:53,066 --> 00:56:55,166
from the other side, huh?

710
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,100
- Ah, I ain't messing with
none of that Ouija shit.

711
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:01,300
Now way, y'all can do
what you want to,

712
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:03,400
but count me out of that.

713
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,300
(ominous music)

714
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,600
- Lieutenant Westerman,
what have I told you

715
00:57:10,633 --> 00:57:14,567
about getting confused between
reality and make believe?

716
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,066
We all know where that leads,
Westy.

717
00:57:22,133 --> 00:57:24,033
Go see what poor little
Sabbath Jones has to say

718
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,633
about all of this,

719
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:27,767
'cause she sure knows
what's going on now.

720
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,200
What is that supposed to be?

721
00:57:47,233 --> 00:57:48,700
- [Guilty] Pentagram.

722
00:57:48,734 --> 00:57:53,100
- [Damon] That's not a
pentagram, it has six sides.

723
00:57:53,133 --> 00:57:54,200
- [Violence] Guilty,
you're a total idiot.

724
00:57:54,233 --> 00:57:55,767
Can't you do anything right?

725
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,967
- [Guilty] No one taught
me how to make.

726
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:00,133
- What goes down?

727
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,300
- You know, I was just thinking,
Damon.

728
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:06,333
You never listened to a
word Sabbath said

729
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:07,400
when she was alive.

730
00:58:08,467 --> 00:58:10,767
Why is she so interesting
now that she's dead?

731
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:14,500
- People are always more
interesting when they're dead.

732
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:19,333
(whispering)

733
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,367
- Can you hear that?

734
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:25,000
- Hear what?

735
00:58:30,266 --> 00:58:32,266
You wanna do this thing?

736
00:58:38,433 --> 00:58:41,333
(foreboding music)

737
00:58:49,133 --> 00:58:51,066
She looks so peaceful now.

738
00:58:53,266 --> 00:58:54,200
Thanks, Doc.

739
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,166
- Don't thank me,
thank chemicals.

740
00:59:27,934 --> 00:59:30,100
(humming)

741
00:59:42,433 --> 00:59:43,400
- Sabbath.

742
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,133
Sabbath Jones.

743
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:50,734
Speak to us.

744
00:59:52,433 --> 00:59:53,266
Give us a sign.

745
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,133
Sabbath?

746
01:00:07,133 --> 01:00:08,533
Sabbath Jones?

747
01:00:13,233 --> 01:00:14,367
Where are you, Sabbath?

748
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,066
We can feel you.

749
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:21,033
We know you're around
here somewhere, Sabbath,

750
01:00:21,066 --> 01:00:21,900
show yourself.

751
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:26,100
Sabbath Jones.

752
01:00:30,533 --> 01:00:31,367
Sabbath!

753
01:00:32,734 --> 01:00:33,567
Sabbath!

754
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:41,300
Speak to us, Sabbath.

755
01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:43,233
Speak to us.

756
01:00:47,266 --> 01:00:48,100
Rise.

757
01:00:49,834 --> 01:00:53,834
Rise from the land of
dust and shadows.

758
01:00:58,734 --> 01:00:59,567
- Liar.

759
01:01:00,867 --> 01:01:04,567
Your sister told me everything.

760
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,834
(clucking)

761
01:01:12,767 --> 01:01:16,633
I can speak your secret
language now.

762
01:01:16,667 --> 01:01:18,433
- Who did this?

763
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:20,300
- It's all your fault!

764
01:01:28,734 --> 01:01:30,934
- [Jessica] You stole
it, you stole my life.

765
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:34,233
Jessica.

766
01:01:34,266 --> 01:01:36,433
(screams)

767
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,133
- Hey, come on out.

768
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:48,734
Come on out.

769
01:01:50,033 --> 01:01:51,367
I just wanna talk with you.

770
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:53,667
All right?

771
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,500
I know you didn't wanna
kill Sabbath.

772
01:01:57,533 --> 01:01:59,400
(squeaking)

773
01:01:59,433 --> 01:02:01,367
I didn't wanna kill
that preacher, neither.

774
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,533
They just make you kill,
there's nothing you can do.

775
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:06,967
(screeching)

776
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:11,934
(grunts)

777
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:19,633
(suspenseful music)

778
01:02:34,734 --> 01:02:38,100
- Better run and hide,
you zany bitch!

779
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:39,667
- It's not that bad, Damon.

780
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,300
- Ready or not, here we come.

781
01:02:45,266 --> 01:02:47,867
(grunting)

782
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,166
- [Westy] Dying ain't that bad.

783
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,433
- Yeah?

784
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,266
Well I'll have to
try it someday.

785
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,800
(tense music)

786
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,900
(screeching)

787
01:03:55,533 --> 01:03:56,800
(shouts)

788
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:57,767
- Precious.

789
01:03:59,133 --> 01:04:02,600
It's starting to become a
bit of a buzzkill, baby.

790
01:04:03,867 --> 01:04:05,100
A real bummer.

791
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:09,133
Jennifer?

792
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,300
Jennifer, talk to me.

793
01:04:15,266 --> 01:04:17,400
I'm just feeling a
little bit lonely.

794
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,900
Where are you, sugar?

795
01:04:21,333 --> 01:04:22,834
Where are you, sugar bear?

796
01:04:24,567 --> 01:04:25,734
Sunflower.

797
01:04:31,266 --> 01:04:32,066
Precious?

798
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,967
(foreboding music)

799
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,333
- Ooh.

800
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,200
There you are.

801
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,266
Just relax.
(zipping)

802
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,233
Me and the little doctor

803
01:04:50,266 --> 01:04:52,233
are gonna take care of
you just fine.

804
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,533
The fuck?

805
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:02,867
(screaming)

806
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,300
(yelps)

807
01:05:22,033 --> 01:05:24,533
(eerie music)

808
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,600
(smooth bass music)

809
01:05:39,633 --> 01:05:41,934
- Let's just cut the static
and get back on the road.

810
01:05:41,967 --> 01:05:43,066
- Yeah, maybe we
should burn rubber

811
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,333
out of this freaky scene, man.

812
01:05:45,367 --> 01:05:48,200
- She can't hide forever.

813
01:05:51,834 --> 01:05:54,734
(foreboding music)

814
01:05:58,233 --> 01:05:59,734
- Perimeter or penetration?

815
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,400
- Penetration.

816
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,066
Jennifer.

817
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,200
Damon said we couldn't kill you,

818
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:13,667
but he never said we
couldn't play.

819
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,767
(giggling)

820
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,800
Goddamn her!

821
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:41,100
- Oh Doc.

822
01:06:41,133 --> 01:06:42,633
Oh Doc.

823
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:49,200
Oh, oh Doc, you've finally
gone and lost your mind.

824
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:57,834
Hm.

825
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:07,500
(chittering)

826
01:07:07,533 --> 01:07:09,700
(screams)

827
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,834
- Guilty?

828
01:07:41,233 --> 01:07:42,066
Guilty?

829
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,233
Guilty?

830
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:50,567
(tense music)

831
01:08:02,467 --> 01:08:04,166
- [Damon] Where's Guilty Karma?

832
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,266
- Don't you ever say
that name again!

833
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,767
- Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.

834
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:16,900
(wolf howling)

835
01:08:16,934 --> 01:08:19,934
(suspenseful music)

836
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:32,767
- Jennifer!

837
01:08:37,734 --> 01:08:39,900
(gagging)

838
01:08:43,066 --> 01:08:45,467
(chittering)

839
01:09:06,233 --> 01:09:08,500
(creaking)

840
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,700
- [Jennifer Voiceover]
Maybe this isn't happening.

841
01:09:37,734 --> 01:09:39,166
Maybe it's only a dream.

842
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,233
(somber music)

843
01:09:45,266 --> 01:09:47,100
Hush now.

844
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,333
Sleep.

845
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,367
You're close.

846
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,166
Time to sleep.

847
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,633
So close now.

848
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,166
She's awake.

849
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,066
She's waiting for you.

850
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,467
It's time, Jennifer.

851
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:10,166
Together, it's time.

852
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,133
Together, time to go home.

853
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:14,000
Together.

854
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,233
Jennifer.

855
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:27,600
Just a dream.

856
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,033
Just a beautiful dream.

857
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:39,867
Just lie down, close your eyes,

858
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,300
and it will all be over soon.

859
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:53,200
(thunder rumbling)

860
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:01,100
- Goddamn you, goddamn you!

861
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:02,900
Why Doc?

862
01:11:02,934 --> 01:11:04,800
What did he ever do to you
besides judge your little head

863
01:11:04,834 --> 01:11:07,000
of Venus for a while, huh?

864
01:11:07,033 --> 01:11:08,233
I saved you!

865
01:11:09,133 --> 01:11:10,767
I saved you, Jennifer!

866
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,266
And this is the thanks I
get, you butcher my people.

867
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,567
All of them!

868
01:11:16,867 --> 01:11:20,533
Oh, you have completely fucked
my shit up here, blondie,

869
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,367
do you know that?

870
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,367
Well do you?

871
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,767
- But I didn't kill anybody.

872
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,633
I didn't.

873
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,400
- Not even the man in
the funny hat?

874
01:11:34,934 --> 01:11:39,600
- Well maybe him, but
no one else.

875
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:41,600
- It doesn't make any sense,
Jennifer.

876
01:11:41,633 --> 01:11:43,600
You're not making any sense!

877
01:11:48,066 --> 01:11:53,033
- Damon, can we please just
get out of here, please?

878
01:11:53,066 --> 01:11:55,734
Please, Damon, let's just go,
please?

879
01:11:57,834 --> 01:12:00,400
Let me go, please, Damon.

880
01:12:00,433 --> 01:12:01,700
Please help.
- You look all scared and

881
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:05,967
innocent now, but if I let you
go,

882
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,200
you're just gonna kill again,
aren't you?

883
01:12:11,934 --> 01:12:14,266
- You're just gonna
have to trust me, Damon.

884
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:18,967
- Okay.

885
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:22,500
Okay, Jennifer.

886
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:25,533
I'm gonna trust you.

887
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:30,066
As long as you trust me.

888
01:12:31,033 --> 01:12:32,700
- What are you gonna do
with that, huh?

889
01:12:32,734 --> 01:12:35,400
(ominous music)

890
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,467
(thunder rumbles)
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

891
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:48,033
I'm not gonna do anything you
don't want me to do, Jennifer!

892
01:12:48,967 --> 01:12:52,066
'Cause that's what
trust is about.

893
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,500
I wanna trust you.

894
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:56,734
Now how are we gonna
make that happen?

895
01:12:56,767 --> 01:12:59,567
- Didn't do anything, Damon.

896
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,433
I didn't kill anybody.

897
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:06,700
- Did those ridiculous quacks
fuck your head up so bad

898
01:13:06,734 --> 01:13:09,567
that you don't know how
perfectly healthy,

899
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,033
how utterly transcendent
you really are?

900
01:13:13,433 --> 01:13:14,934
You're the ace of spades, lady,

901
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,100
the undisputed queen of
the underworld,

902
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,400
and it would be my pleasure,

903
01:13:21,467 --> 01:13:23,433
my pleasure to serve
you as your king.

904
01:13:25,133 --> 01:13:27,433
But you have to do one
thing for me first.

905
01:13:28,467 --> 01:13:31,467
You have to tell me how
it felt to kill him.

906
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:33,800
- But it...

907
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,600
- Just be my black widow mama,
Jennifer.

908
01:13:45,633 --> 01:13:46,900
Just be my black widow mama,

909
01:13:46,934 --> 01:13:48,800
and I'll love you 'till
the day we die.

910
01:13:48,834 --> 01:13:50,300
We can be together forever.

911
01:13:51,433 --> 01:13:52,934
All you have to do is tell me.

912
01:13:54,433 --> 01:13:57,100
(ominous music)

913
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:00,300
- [Whispering Voice] Jennifer.

914
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:02,300
(gasps)

915
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:07,734
- Tell me, Jennifer.

916
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,500
- They want everything.

917
01:14:12,533 --> 01:14:14,133
- Tell me everything.

918
01:14:16,967 --> 01:14:18,100
(groaning)

919
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:21,033
(thunder cracks)

920
01:14:21,066 --> 01:14:24,000
(suspenseful music)

921
01:14:24,033 --> 01:14:26,433
(wolf howls)

922
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:39,400
- Kill me!

923
01:14:40,266 --> 01:14:42,567
Why aren't you gonna kill me?

924
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,667
Huh, why not?

925
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:47,467
I'm the only one who
lost a soul!

926
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:52,867
No, it's because I'm
just like you, isn't it?

927
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,133
Isn't it, isn't it?

928
01:14:59,433 --> 01:15:01,934
(eerie music)

929
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:58,467
You look like you
could use a ride.

930
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,633
- Where you going?

931
01:16:01,667 --> 01:16:04,100
- [Jennifer] Anywhere,
how about you?

932
01:16:04,133 --> 01:16:06,400
- Well I'm just going home.

933
01:16:06,433 --> 01:16:07,934
- [Jennifer] I could
take you home.

934
01:16:08,867 --> 01:16:11,333
Go on, get in.

935
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:13,567
This day's not gonna
last forever, you know.

936
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,133
- Okay.

937
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,200
I'm Randy.

938
01:16:32,233 --> 01:16:33,600
- [Jennifer] You don't say.

939
01:16:34,734 --> 01:16:38,467
- So what's your handle,
pretty lady?

940
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:41,300
- They call me

941
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:45,967
