00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,626
Time Travel

2
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,218
When You Think of It It Is Very Easy

3
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,287
And Everyday You Are Doing
The Same Thing In The Same Direction

4
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,799
But How If You Can Change The Time

5
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:38,304
That Is The Victiness of The History

6
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,339
Isn't That Enough To Be An oberservor

7
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,898
If You Have Power To Change That

8
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:47,037
You May Know Well About The World

9
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,138
May Be I Can Help You

10
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,773

Time Control Commision

12
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,745
These Theory Can Be A System

13
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,348
That Is A Nature To Use Your Advantage

14
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,223
We May Be Regret About Right or Wrong

15
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,319
Very Simply

16
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,695
We Live In This Moment

17
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,825
No Matter What Reason Is

18
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,336
I Won't

19
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:14,066
Let It Control Me

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,767
To Be Locked In The Time

21
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,503
I Have To Betray The Time

22
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,545
If We Decided By Time

23
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,204
If We Can Change All These

24
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,581
How Would We Be

25
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:30,589
What Can We Do

26
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:09,521
Let Me Look At Your Paper

27
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:04,007
You Baters Get out of The Way

28
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,341

29
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,611

Thank You

31
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,685
But He Is Still Standing

32
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,088
Not Any More

33
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:53,591
Good

34
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,597

35
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:07,005
May Be I Should Call Her out

36
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,780
How Can You Be So Long

37
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,940
You Are To Save Them

38
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:21,612
You Are Not So Stupid

39
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,417
Blow Me

40
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:23,716
Let's Go

41
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,727
Time Is Not Much

42
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:34,994
Not Bad

43
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,933
Everything Is Ready

44
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,834
You Are Just A Chinese To Me

45
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,668
Germany In 1948

46
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,708
We Are All Controled By Nazy

47
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,939
I Hope So

48
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:51,177
Don't Worry

49
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,187
It Is The Time

50
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:09,891
She Is So Charming

51
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,994
It Is Him

52
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,232
What Does He Doing Here

53
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:18,641

54
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,648
Seems That one Shouldn't Come Come

55
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:34,187

He Said That
He Is Very Glad To Meet You

60
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,132
Tell Him That He Is A Criminal

61
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,336
I Am Very Glad To See

62
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:57,349
If He Is Sentenced To Death

63
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,984
He Said That This Is His Honour

64
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,886
To Meet You

65
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,787

66
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,019

That You Have Much To Talk With Him

70
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:36,221
Please Excuse Me

71
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,795

Let Me Cut Is Short

73
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:20,265
I Think You Shouldn't Come Up

74
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:29,073
All Are over

75
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,705

This Won't Happened

90
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,221
You Won't Let
A Mad Man Kill Millions of People

91
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,696
They Died 80 Years Ago

92
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,995
But They Won't

93
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,398
Now Is 1940

94
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:31,231
They Are Still Alive

95
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,772
You Know That Is Impossible

96
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,670
You Will Change

97
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:36,400

00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,915
I Know It Is Hard For You

102
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,148
But You Should Do The Right Thing

103
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:55,159
No

104
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,765
Put The Gun Down

105
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:11,070
No

106
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,303
You Put The Gun Down

107
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:13,902
Put The Gun Down

108
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,845

109
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,713

110
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:23,721

Shoot Shirley

112
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:12,203
Shirley

113
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,286
Everytime It Is Hard To Come Back

114
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,327
Every Jump

115
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,693
Many Things Are Left Behind

116
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:39,355
Many Things Are Behind You

117
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,559
Because You Are Serching

118
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,797
Something That Doesn't Exist

119
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,703
Something As Part of You

120
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:52,710
Something That Can't Be Changed

121
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:06,588
I Have Been In This House For A Month

122
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,127
Enjoy My Time

123
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,959
I Know Someone Are Wating At Me

124
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,022
I Am Just Waiting

125
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,537
Waiting For The Chance

126
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,734
or I Will Fell Bored About It

127
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,435
Several Years Ago

128
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,004
The Government Think
It Is Necessary To Amend The History

129
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,072
Evens Are Changed

130
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,413
The Fact Is

131
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,353
They Failed on These Things

132
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,787
To Made Us Belive

133
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,088
They Create The Science of The History

134
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,095
They Should Be Serious

135
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,528
But The Fact Is

136
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,463
They Give Support To The Government

137
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,730
Many People Struggle To Climb Up

138
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,670
Scients Can Do Nothing To This

139
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,707
ofcourse

140
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,005
If I Can Change This Before Us

141
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:02,980

If We Are Not So Tight on You

159
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,021
You Would Be Anyone

160
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,357
So You Are Finding A Kid In This City

161
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,656

And Won't Work In Tec

165
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,030

Including Us

167
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:08,035
But You Are Going To Change It

168
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,369
Miller Is A Scientist

169
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,342

170
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,211
And I Am Going To Defeat Him

171
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:21,015

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,431

Let's Have A Talk Here

204
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,053

You Won't Laugh Later

206
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:12,863
Don't Use Violence

207
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:55,229
What The Hell Happened Just Now

208
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,749
You Know It Is Not Right To Do This

209
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,289
What Are You Doing Here

210
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,653
You Are Right

211
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,160
Some one Belongs To Future Shouldn't Exist

212
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:21,165
See You 130 Years Later

213
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,130

Have Understanding on our Agent

217
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,010
Aderwar

218
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,954
As A Member of This Society

220
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,184

221
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,957
Shut Up

That You Are Acused Now

223
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,600
You Are Charged of Murdering

224
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:05,609
And You Are Sentenced To Death

225
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,577
This Is A Trap

226
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,518
You Are The Killer

227
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,782

May The 7Th 2025

231
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,352
In Fact Many Things In History

232
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,986
May Have Different Reasons And Results

233
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,893
I Am Not Against History

234
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,295
I Just Say

235
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,526
If Time Can Reverse

236
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,001
We Can Change The History

237
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,595
So

238
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:11,609
If We Can Change The Time

239
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:16,614
We Can Change The History

249
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,798

253
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:58,923
Tech And Scients

254
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,724

00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,212
You Remember That Is Black

267
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,375

268
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,783
At Least Half A Dozen

269
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,844
What Is Your Problem Rock

270
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,447

271
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:10,928
And We Let Them Do Many Everyday

272
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,361
I Just Want To Know The Result

273
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,093
The Case Is out or Not

274
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,293
You Let The Guy In

275
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,097
Isn't That Your Responsibility

276
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,228
Can You Have A Rest

277
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,966
Have A Rest

278
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,268

Lion And Chars Disappered

They Are Sentenced To Death

282
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,880
Just 30 Days

283
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,679

You Know That
Does That Mean By 30 Days

287
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,787
From The Government That Is Too Many

288
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,493
That Is Really Worse

289
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,128
You Should Get Back With Me To Sign

290
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,365
Would You Want To Have Dinner With Me

291
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:59,376
I Have No Time

292
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:01,975
You Won't

293
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,073

I Am Flattered

296
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:13,319
You Should Know What To Do

297
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,795
A Typical Crazy Man

298
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,060
And May Be He Have Another

299
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,532
Don't Worry About This

300
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,092
I Would Take Care of Them

301
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,228
You Did Good

302
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:31,241
You Really Did Go

303
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:36,807
What Is Your Matter

304
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,747
I Think I Should Quit

305
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:39,909
Yes

306
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,850
You Desert It

307
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,013
Take A Few Days To Vacation

308
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,788
That Is Not What I Mean

309
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,293
May Be I Can't Do This Any More

310
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,124
What

311
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:54,962
What Are You Talking About

312
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,898
I Don't Know Why
I Did It The First Time

313
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,334
I Mean What Is The Meaning

314
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,928

315
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,132

316
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,107

317
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,905
Kelly Miller Is Just An old Woman

318
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,740
You Did A Right Thing

319
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,007
Are You Sure

320
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,342
You Are Doing Your Job

321
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,179
You Preserve Past
And You Protect The Future

322
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:13,945
You Take The order

323
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,008
Even If You Don't Like

324
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,314
You Are Not ordinary People

325
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,082

326
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,286

328
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,759
You Are Not ordinary People

329
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,128
So Don't Think Too Much About It

330
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,190
Don't Think Too Much

331
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:32,862
All Are over

332
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,998
You Think What You Are Doing

333
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,599
May Be You See Too Much

334
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,770
I Think That You Won't Do Anything

335
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:41,540
I Just Want To Live My Life

336
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:46,550
Life

337
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,916

340
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,661
We Have Made Timely Progress

341
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:01,096
We Ask For More Men

342
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,135
Yes Sir

343
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:07,228
Now The Time Is 1987

344
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:08,636
We Can Bring Them Back

345
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,140
This Is What We Set

346
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,698
They Are Just Visitors

347
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,040
Too Close

348
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,170
What The Hell Happened Just Now

349
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,909
Why Not

350
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:21,441
Can You Go To Any Place At Any Time

351
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,081
Not Now

352
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:30,093
Rebuilt

353
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,502
Shit

354
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:49,536
Return To Now

355
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:01,483
To Pick Them

356
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:02,417
Without My Permission

357
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:06,123
How Can This Happened

358
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:09,189
I Can Ask You
For Permission on Everything

359
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,497
So Whom Do You Asking For

360
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,300
I Just Did It By The Programme

361
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,966
They Sugeet It

362
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,033
They Just Want To Go Back
To The Same Place The Same Time

363
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,475
That Is Really Dangerous

364
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:24,879
Shit

365
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,077
I Said That Don't Take Any Chance

366
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,245
Now Relauch

367
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:33,587
I Go

368
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,216
I Thought That
You Are Going To Meet Your Wife

369
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,260
No You Can't Send Him

370
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,991

371
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,464

372
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,465
Lorry You Are In

Yes Sir

374
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,494
If He Died Here

375
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,265
That Means He Died on 1987

376
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,931
And It Means

377
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,669
That The Time Criminal Can Escape

378
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:55,076
Be Lauched After 60 Seconds

379
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:59,139
68.30% 

380
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:03,210
You Should Do Your own Things

381
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,949
I Just Want It In 2 Minutes

382
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:05,853

383
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:09,018
Yes Sir

384
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,789
Johnson Put Their Name In

385
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,489

386
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,031
I Am In

387
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,293
Give Me Some Time

388
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,664
Destination Not Clear

818
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:40,772
Let Him Go

819
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,508

820
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:47,078

The Process of Launch Is Unstable

826
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:29,220
He Cannot Stand It

827
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:30,230
Now Stop It

828
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:32,893
Too Late

829
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:37,906
Has Launched

830
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:58,425
In Fact Many Historical Events

831
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:03,363
Were Happened Because of Chances

832
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,327
So Can We Change These Chances

833
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:06,129
I Mean

834
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,726
If We Can Travel Past The Time

835
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:10,931
We Can Rewrite The History

836
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,736
So What Do You Mean Is

837
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:16,801
If We Can Do That, 
We Should Change The History

838
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:19,109
Sure

839
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,547
Do You Know
What Are The Results of This Change

840
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:24,950
The Results Maybe More Terrible

841
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:26,682
I Don?? T Think So

842
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,020
As Long As We Change It For Better

843
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:32,117
I Can't Agree With Your Idea

844
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,220
Form The View of Social Revolution

845
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,357
We Should Not Chang Ethe History

846
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,594
What Should Benefit From The Change

847
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:44,606
You Me I Want Some Different Ideas

848
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,972
What Do You Think

849
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:50,410
I Think If We Are Capable

850
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:51,912
We Should Change The History

851
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:55,974
I Mean From
The View of Science To Change The History

852
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,350
A Historian

853
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:02,653
Do You Want
To observe The Happening of History

854
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,750
Then You Should Face Up To Every Disaster

855
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:06,260
Yes But It Is Creul

856
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,560
But The Subject of History Is Useless

857
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,259
I Mean

858
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:15,395
our History Is Uncertain

859
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:16,495
It Is Said That

860
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:19,507
All The Research
Based on Events Is Useless

861
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:22,976
Even You Don't Want Them To Happen

862
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:24,034
But In Fact Them Have Already Happened

863
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:26,445
But We Can Prevent Them From Happening

864
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:27,812
Fact Is Fact

865
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:32,820
It Cannot Be Changed
our Feelings And Emotions

866
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:40,151
Shold Not Be Used
To Determin What Is Good or Bad In History

867
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:43,857
Yes I Think So

868
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:48,870
