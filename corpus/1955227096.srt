1
00:00:00,534 --> 00:00:03,271
[Music playing]

2
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:20,054
And next to me, I guess, is
we have one of the producers,

3
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:22,156
Who's producer [inaudible].

4
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,026
And I think that Lloyd Kaufman
is one of the producers

5
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:27,161
That is hard to ignore.

6
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,496
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Everyone
should be paying

7
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:29,663
Attention to what we are doing.

8
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,099
It doesn't matter
what you're doing.

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:31,899
Pay attention!
MAN: OK.

10
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:32,966
Here we go.

11
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,034
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I have
to tell everybody

12
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,002
Eight times everything we do.

13
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:36,036
We got to tell
you, you, you, you.

14
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:37,004
Pay attention!

15
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,006
MAN: At Troma
Entertainment, they seem

16
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:41,975
To be everywhere all the time.

17
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:45,179
It's a very impressive
organization.

18
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,615
People who make... we call
ourselves the Troma team.

19
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,084
People are not making a
Troma movie for the money.

20
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,586
They're not making a Troma
movie to get a big hotel suite.

21
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,054
They're making art.

22
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,390
INTERVIEWER: So what have we
been waiting for right now?

23
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,059
I'm waiting to squeeze
a fart out of this PA.

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,061
MAN: He was the director
and the producer

25
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:05,065
And the writer, I believe,
of "Class of Nuke 'Em High,"

26
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:05,999
"Toxic Avenger."

27
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,769
The latest film
is "Terror Fimer."

28
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:09,737
Yes.

29
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,905
On CNN or something,
they're giving

30
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,108
Advice to up-and... filmmakers.

31
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,778
And the first thing
they said is, please

32
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,747
Don't make a movie
about making a movie.

33
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:20,848
Nobody cares.

34
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,750
It's about a Troma
film crew, right?

35
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,519
And they're shooting
"The Toxic Avenger 4."

36
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:26,320
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,155
Oh, yeah.

38
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,257
This smells like the first mask.

39
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:31,259
But there's a
serial killer that's

40
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,460
Picking them off one by one.

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,428
MAN IN BUSHES: [screaming]

42
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,229
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

43
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,197
MAN: Cut!

44
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,998
And as Lloyd Kaufman
would say, it's

45
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,400
"Henry, Portrait
of a Serial Killer"

46
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,068
Meets "Living in
Oblivion" through the eyes

47
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,770
Of Frank Capra.

48
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,475
The way this project
began was we reflected,

49
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:49,410
What is independent art?

50
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,679
What is independent cinema?

51
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,415
And in the process
of doing so, we

52
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,917
Remembered there were a lot
of interesting anecdotes

53
00:01:57,017 --> 00:02:00,454
Along the way in Tromaville
over the past 25 years.

54
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:02,390
Would you say this
is a good B movie?

55
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,724
It's gonna be a great B movie.

56
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:04,525
A great B movie?

57
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,893
A great B movie.

58
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:09,029
We had some great pyrotechnics,
explosions, people on fire,

59
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,466
Decapitations, leg
amputations, two-sex freak.

60
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,868
I can't even tell you anymore,
because if Lloyd watches

61
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,104
This thing, I just want him to
know that I'm not giving away

62
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:19,540
The ending or any
crucial plots to "Terror"

63
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,943
"Firmer," just enough to
entice people, hook 'em in.

64
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:27,581
So this movie is about a
young group of people for whom

65
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,083
The film that they
are making is the most

66
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,585
Important thing in their lives.

67
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,087
[Inaudible] the concept
of this movie isn't really

68
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,390
"Terror Firmer," it's
called... what were

69
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,158
We talking about in the van?

70
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,428
It's called "Seven Days
of Sleep Deprivation."

71
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:41,529
[Laughter]

72
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,266
They're led on their
quest to make great art

73
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:49,670
By a blind, broken down,
independent, low-budget movie

74
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,804
Director.

75
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,707
It's very close to the
storyline of this film,

76
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:54,542
You know?

77
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,444
Coffee and no cops.

78
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,978
Director getting frustrated.

79
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:59,347
Nothing happening.

80
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:01,282
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Only because the
people are too fucking lazy,

81
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:02,716
We had a goddamn day off.

82
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,218
And they use it as a day off.

83
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,087
People on the production ought
to be here doing the planning.

84
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,089
The whole fucking week
has been fucked up.

85
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,058
Actors totally out of it.

86
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,494
LLOYD KAUFMAN: You're about 10
minutes too later there, Neve.

87
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,929
The minute she turns
to move, get in there.

88
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,398
We are this movie.

89
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,632
Everything that
has been predicted

90
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,869
Is going to come true,
right down to people

91
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:25,506
Being killed onset in savage
and unprovoked murders.

92
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,408
LLOYD KAUFMAN: We're in
the fucking pickles here.

93
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,177
We're in the fuckin'... we're
never gonna finish this thing.

94
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,144
[Music playing]

95
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,112
MAN: Oh, no.

96
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,080
MAN: (DISGUSTED) Oh.

97
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,548
MAN: Pull Camera A.

98
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:35,516
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

99
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,818
MAN: (LAUGHING) Yeah, Troma.

100
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,653
[Vomiting sound]

101
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:40,754
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Where's the blood?

102
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:41,722
Where's the blood?
Dagnabbit.

103
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:42,690
Where's the blood?

104
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,691
Don't do that.

105
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:44,492
[Explosion]

106
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,627
Don't do anything like that.

107
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:47,595
[Cheers]

108
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,062
Dammit, could people
listen, please?

109
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,132
And if someone's killed on my
set, I'll blow my brains out.

110
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,002
[Music playing]

111
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,478
[Helicopter]

112
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,397
LLOYD KAUFMAN: [groaning]

113
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:25,165
What is that?

114
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,099
Can you show that to me?

115
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:29,837
What is that?

116
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:35,175
It's Toxie's head on
Lloyd's mind stick.

117
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,910
INTERVIEWER: How goes it?

118
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,011
Pretty well.

119
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,780
We're readying scene
nine right now, which

120
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,616
Is where Toxie and
Sarah are making

121
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,852
Sweet, sweet love to each
other with the cityscape

122
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:45,986
In the background.

123
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:49,457
Interesting trivia
fact about this scene

124
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:53,160
Is that right now the actor
playing the Toxic Avenger

125
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,628
Is drunk.

126
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,997
INTERVIEWER: Toxie, you
are in high spirits today.

127
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,366
Oh, absolutely.

128
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:01,669
I feel that I am especially
superheroes today.

129
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:02,970
Yeah, yeah.

130
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,271
INTERVIEWER: That's the keyword.

131
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:07,307
If there was any troubles
within the city of Manhattan

132
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:09,109
Right now, me as
the Toxic Avenger

133
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,679
Would come to the
rescue of Giuliani.

134
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,113
(IN DEEP VOICE) Looking for me?

135
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,482
You know?

136
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:20,821
So you get the technology plus
the campy Speed Racer stuff.

137
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,657
And that's pretty much
how I've conquered Toxie.

138
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,925
INTERVIEWER: Kick ass.

139
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,927
[Laughs]

140
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,469
Check out my Toxie outfit.

141
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,336
LLOYD KAUFMAN: This works.

142
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,605
WOMAN: It's too short.

143
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,339
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Why don't
we... why don't we just take

144
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,340
The scissors?

145
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:41,409
ROY DAVID: That's
what I'm thinking.

146
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,242
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.
It's up to you, Roy.

147
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,243
You tell us what you want to do.

148
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,412
ROY DAVID: It
doesn't matter to me.

149
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:45,679
Whatever makes the art the art.

150
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,448
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Just don't
cut... I think you'll be...

151
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:49,450
ROY DAVID: I do [inaudible]
drawers halfway dropped.

152
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,551
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, yeah.

153
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:51,919
No, drop the drawers.
Everything's great.

154
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,353
Just don't cut the T-shirt.
ROY DAVID: OK.

155
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,655
LLOYD KAUFMAN: That way
you can go up or down.

156
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:55,689
See?

157
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,825
The more ass I show,
the happier I am.

158
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:58,626
You know?

159
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,462
I got a good ass.

160
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,796
INTERVIEWER: How we
doing there, Steven?

161
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:03,897
We're doing pretty good.

162
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,499
We're a little bit
behind schedule today.

163
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,299
What are we doing?

164
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,267
Thank you very much.

165
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,602
We're going to
have a blocking, so

166
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,104
The actors... let's bring the
actors in for the blocking,

167
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,039
Please.

168
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,006
Could we clear
all non-essentials

169
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,242
From set, please?

170
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,276
Close set.

171
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,745
OK.
Here we go.

172
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:18,612
Picture's up.

173
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,514
Five, please. [Inaudible].

174
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,917
Ready and slate in.

175
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:24,885
Roll sound.

176
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,822
INTERVIEWER: What's that?
MAN: OK, here we go.

177
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,357
See if he gets hit.
MAN: Very quiet, please.

178
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,825
Roll the picture.

179
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,293
I can see.

180
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,294
[Gasps]

181
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,095
I can see.

182
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,263
I'm coming!

183
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,665
Oh, and I can see!

184
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,466
I'm seeing it.

185
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:39,266
I'm coming!

186
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,701
And it's so beautiful!

187
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,136
[Moans]

188
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,105
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I
see myself coming.

189
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,206
I see myself coming.

190
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,575
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
that's the funny line.

191
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:49,610
I'm coming, and I'm seeing...
I can see myself coming, right?

192
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,679
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I'm coming, I'm
coming. (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)

193
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:52,946
I could see, I could see.

194
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,783
And then a, I see myself
coming, and it's so beautiful!

195
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,184
Ah!

196
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:01,288
Well, this is when the arm goes
into the television like this.

197
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,625
What we're doing is we're
shooting it backwards.

198
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:06,794
So I'm gonna pull this,
and it's gonna come away.

199
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,128
Watch your back,
camera comin' through.

200
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:08,629
MAN: Camera moves.
Watch your backs, folks.

201
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:09,730
Watch it.

202
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,498
But when they reverse
it, it's going to be

203
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:11,465
Going into the television.

204
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,500
INTERVIEWER: So
you're going to flip

205
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,767
The camera over and shoot it?

206
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,168
And then they got
to play it backwards

207
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,136
When the guys are editing it?

208
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:17,971
Yeah.

209
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:19,673
MAN: One, two, three!

210
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,944
It's a cut.

211
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,145
MAN: Good.

212
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,446
INTERVIEWER: That's gonna
be a seamless effect.

213
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:27,648
[Clap and cheer]

214
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:33,987
Eh.

215
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:34,955
INTERVIEWER: What's up, Lloyd?

216
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,291
What are you doing?

217
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,927
Cheat sheets?

218
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:44,264
Doing the, uh... trying to
figure out how we can make up

219
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,900
98% of the day in 10 minutes.

220
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,969
We like... we've done,
like, 2% of the work.

221
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,105
And the day is 2/3 over.

222
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,010
INTERVIEWER: Any ideas?

223
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,846
We'll cut out a
lot of scenes, yeah.

224
00:07:58,946 --> 00:07:59,647
INTERVIEWER: [chuckle]

225
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,616
Sir.

226
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:09,156
Steven, uh, what... let's say we
finish with this thing at 3:00.

227
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,325
I think we should go to number
25, turn off the midget.

228
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,595
Is the midget here?

229
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:18,666
The midget's call is pretty
much in 10, 15 minutes.

230
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:21,802
So she'll be here.

231
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:25,005
I think that the midget
scene is a very simple scene.

232
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,406
All right.

233
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,776
So then let's go... let's do 25
and just tear ass through it.

234
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,444
You gotta get people
to move, though.

235
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:33,714
The midget scene could be very
nice at magic hour as well,

236
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:34,514
You know?

237
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,918
Yeah, all right.

238
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,554
Now costumes.

239
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:41,622
Who's costumes?

240
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,856
Is he gonna be OK?

241
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,157
Can you lift your
skirt like that?

242
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:44,958
MAN: Yes.

243
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:45,759
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready?

244
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,560
Nobody talk.

245
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,360
Let's just go.

246
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,528

247
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:49,329
Here we go.

248
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,531
Standing by.

249
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,901
Action.

250
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,002
Breathe, Melvin.
Breathe!

00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:55,803

252
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:56,604
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Come out.

253
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:57,705
You can do it!

254
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,206
It's coming!

255
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,643
I can feel it!

256
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:03,443
Mommy!

257
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,311
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

258
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,412
Good.

259
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:06,714
INTERVIEWER: So are you
doing a scene today?

260
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,548
Yeah, we're doing
a scene today.

261
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,450
INTERVIEWER: Which one?

262
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,089
The opening montage where the
individual, Ariel, gets his leg

263
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:17,490
Ripped off and
beaten about the head

264
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:21,128
Dramatically by the
mysterious woman.

265
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,964
INTERVIEWER: So what aspect
will you be playing in this?

266
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,198
Actually, I'm the
stunt coordinator.

267
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,366
I'm gonna make
sure that nothing...

268
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,668
INTERVIEWER: Oh!

269
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:32,640
Right now Steven, our line
producer's with an officer,

270
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,943
Discussing whether or not...
Oh, we're... they're checking

271
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:36,744
Out our permit.

272
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,114
So we got thrown off...

273
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,482
We were supposed
to film over here.

274
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,784
The police came, said that...

275
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:44,752
MAN: In your trunk?

276
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,186
WOMAN: Yes.
- that we couldn't.

277
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,187
That was basically it.

278
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,588
Now we're moving in here.

279
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:51,491
The big, fat pigs from New York
just threw us off the street

280
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,559
Where we had a permit.

281
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,363
And because of some
kind of promoting.

282
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,699
Can you imagine if it had
been Paramount of Time Warner?

283
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,100
You think they would
have thrown them off?

284
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,201
Right?

285
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,070
Having lived in Los
Angeles, I really admire

286
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,104
The New York Police Department.

287
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,072
INTERVIEWER: [laughs]

288
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,206
Believe me, they
would have shot us.

289
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,441
Now, the LAPD
would have shot us.

290
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,277

291
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,611

[Truck squealing in background]

300
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,023
Action!

301
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,291
(IN FRENCH ACCENT)
Boy, just the kind

302
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:28,929
Of king-size pussy that I like.

Hey, what are you doing?!

304
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,199
Wh... that's my leg!

320
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,433
MAN: What happened to your head?

321
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:09,036
They had to do a scene where
they pour water on my head.

322
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,838
It's like a giant
thing of water.

323
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,206
So the only little
thing is that there's

324
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,842
A big, heavy cap to the jug.

325
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,276
So they don't take the
top of the jug off.

326
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,178
So the jug hits me in the head.

327
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,114
But this is troubling.

328
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,582
Lock up the set.

329
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,484

it up, and shut up.

00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:33,693
When I say "freeze,"
use that thing.

smells like soup, right?

Yeah.

345
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:47,307
It smells like... it's
basically... we're dumping

A can of barley soup on you.

347
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,312
And then I squished
it up... like,

00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,181
There's blood chunks that we
poured into it the other night.

349

all chunky and clear.

And you gotta make
it thick enough.

I'm coming in a minute.

Just... look.

366
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,505
Just make it thick enough, so
that when it's on the ground,

367
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,273
It isn't going to
evaporate or dribbling off

368
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,374
And then it disappears.

gonna happen is when they close

Run in to non-visible land.

we'll put a shitload on him.

a lot in his mouth,

Can we do that
mouth-to-mouth again?

394
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,125
I lost my turd when I dove out.

395
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,460
I had no turd to spit out.

INTERVIEWER: What was it
like to kiss Roy David?

397
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,266
Well, I gave him
mouth-to-mouth, technically.

398
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:21,234
There was one part,
though... I know

399
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:24,771
I'm gonna get killed for this,
but when his mouth was open...

400
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:28,241
And usually when I go down,
his mouth is closed and I just,

401
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,709
Like, breathe over his mouth.

402
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,011
But his mouth was open.

403
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,013
And I think I got a little
bit tongue in there.

404
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,449
So you know, but I'm
not gay or anything.

405
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,419
I think it was actually the
fecal matter-shaped... I mean,

406
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,088
The fecal matter-shaped
Tootsie roll.

407
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,891
It might've been the terd...
But hopefully, it was the turd.

408
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,125
But I don't know.

409
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,928
But any man that would
get excited covered in shit

410
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:52,699
And still be able to be aroused,
I've got problems with that.

411
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,201
That's a fetish of some sort.

412
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,269
It's kind of soft to be the
turd, because the turd was

413
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:57,804
Already hard and painted over.

414
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,140
But I did feel flesh to flesh.

415
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,508
So I was a little concerned.

416
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:04,177
As long as Yaniv didn't have
any movement in his groin area,

417
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,446
I think we're OK on
the homosexuality wrap.

418
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,715
I'm pretty sure I'm not
gay, not that being gay's

INTERVIEWER: Can an onset
romance ever work out?

421
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,654
For Yaniv and I, I
seriously doubt it,

422
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:18,558
Because he's a
little out of shape,

423
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,562
And I prefer my men or women
a little bit more muscular.

gay for Roy David, though?

It's worse on a movie

I don't want somebody
dying on my set.

If someone dies here,
I'll blow my brains out.

It'll be your fault.
My career will be over.

Is it true that our

Um, I am not sure.

I have heard the same rumor.

And in the hospital.

624

That was a totally
different person.

OK.

He's gonna make a little speech
about this is the most squibs.

Then the squibs are going
to go off, bah-bah-bah-bah.

You definitely want to
shoot all of the stuff

00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,366

That you need.

00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,937
Because what happens is the
squibs, all the... you know,

646
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,705
They have little
cuts in the shirt.

647

They have little
cuts in the shirt.

648
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,042
Like, see how your T-shirt
looks nice and white,

649
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,610
Well, ours has little
things that probably

Stick out a little bit.

651
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,481
So anything new that
happens before the squibs

652
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,049
You definitely want to shoot.

653
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,817
Because you're gonna see
the squibs [inaudible].

654
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,486
After the squibs, it
doesn't matter, because he's

Got all the shit on him.

656
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,623
If you don't know exactly what
a squib is, it's just a patch...

657
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,058
Little packets of
blood... actually,

665

But as with anything with a
currency going through it,

666
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,541
There's a certain
sense of danger there.

667
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,776
So you got to be careful.

668
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,211
So I'm the one that's going
to be getting squibbed.

669
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,312
So a lot of charges going off.

670
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,882
And just be aware of
the safety factors here.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: It's
been said, by the way,

675
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,423
That "Troma's War" had
more squibs in that film

676

movie except perhaps

did have a woman's

more historically significant.

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,666
Indeed so.

Excellent, excellent.

00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,543
So just this one is first
so he knows what's going on.

742
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,805
So I guess we ought
to be shooting

have to be cleaned,

would be shooting this way.

I'm leaving today at 2:30.

749
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:46,252
That's why we're
shooting this way.

750
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:47,520
I don't know if you
were aware of it.

751
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,621
I'm aware of it.
And you know what?

752
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,322
Instead of starting
at the beginning,

753
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:54,527
We're gonna shoot this way, so
we can get... get your lines.

754
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:57,864
So everyone's back
behind this line.

755
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:59,532
And it all... all are yapping.

756
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,768
And then Benjamin says, are
you doing the revisions again?

757
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:02,569
Right?

758
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,970
Take it up to there.

759
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,072
And then once
Benjamin goes in here,

760
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,273
I think the other
guys probably will

761
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,809
Start moving forward a bit.

762
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,811
Oh, the other thing is we've
got to make sure... since Will's

763
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:14,180
Been put into all this
horrendous makeup,

764
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,115
That we get to a lot of stuff.

765
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,117
We've got to knock off
a lot of this dialogue.

766
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,418
But while we're
shooting this way,

767
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,521
This stuff should be
moved to that side, right?

768
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:23,656
Mm-hm.

769
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:25,625

has to leave at 2:30.

Yeah, I think it's a mistake.

774

to stay over there.

776
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,306

gotta stay in limbo,

777
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:42,108
Because at 2:30... I think
we've got to isolate you,

we've got to keep shooting.

over near that gas tank.

00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,374
Don't we have costumes here?

885
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,710
It's supposed to
be Mike and Wendy.

886
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:05,978
Mike and Wendy.

887
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,047
Those guys, the running...
The guys who are running.

888
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,716
One is in uniform,
and one isn't.

889
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:11,750
Wendy has her uniform, right?

890
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:12,551
MAN: Yeah.

891
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:13,853
She's getting into it now.

892
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,654
Bring her and the other guy
who's supposed to be Mike.

893
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:19,725
Fuck, Adam.

894
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:20,827
Come on, man.

895
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:22,728
You guys ought to be
reading the script, too.

896
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,497
Mike is the guy who
questions this, right?

897
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,465
Is his costume here?

898
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,167
He's supposed to be in uniform.

899
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,268
That's the point.
[inaudible]

900
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,602
Well, is his costume here?

901
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,371
Then someone should wear
it, whatever his costume is.

902
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,639
It's not.

903
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:35,207
That's what... it was a
suggestion just to use a guard,

904
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,276
Because we weren't sure if that
would be an acceptable double.

905
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:40,813
That was the only
question [inaudible].

906
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:41,680
Mike is a guy.

907
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,315
Just put anybody in Mike's suit.

908
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:44,350
Cover his head.

909
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,451
MAN: OK, that's
what we're doing.

910
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:46,418
Please.

911
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,320
The guard is a
big, fat guy with...

912
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,789
And I think he's
black on top of it.

913
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,491
Mike is a... you know
what Mike looks like.

914
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:53,292
You rehearsed with him.

915
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:54,126
MAN: Yup, I remember.

916
00:29:58,998 --> 00:29:59,866
MAN: How we doin'?

917
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:09,241
MAN: We've been informed
that the cop now

918
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,843
Has his uniform with him.

919
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:13,745
So we [inaudible].

920
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:14,947
Which cop do you have?

921
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,249
We have the female cop in
her uniform ready to go.

922
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:18,050
You said "his."

923
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,018
Use the male pronoun.

924
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:19,919
OK.

925
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,888
Himself.

926
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:22,688
So all right.

927
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:23,822
So Wendy's in costume.

928
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:24,857
She's heading this way.

929
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:25,958
Yes, exactly.

930
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:27,393
And the other guy, do
we have his costume?

931
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:29,495
No, the other guy
is not only not here,

932
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,030
But we don't have his costume.

933
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,698
So we wanted to [inaudible]
possibly use a guard...

934
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,100
No!

935
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,667
It's gotta look like the other
guy, whatever he's gonna wear.

936
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,170
Ask Stephanie, what is the
other guy gonna be wearing?

937
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,506
MAN: She just told me it
was going to be his uniform,

938
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:41,707
Which he was bringing with him.

939
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,774
A-ha.

940
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,776
So then bring... then
let's try the guard.

941
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:45,844
MAN: OK.

942
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:50,582
And have him cover
his... oh, does Stephanie

943
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,717
Have another cop outfit?

944
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:52,818
Supposedly not.

945
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,020
That's what we're
gonna [inaudible].

946
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,421
LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right.

947
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:56,889
Well then just see if the guard
is willing to come and do it.

948
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:58,590
I'm sorry.
All right.

949
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,691
[Helicopter flying overhead]

950
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,062
But Adam, Michael...
Michael is not... Michael

951
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:06,532
Is not wearing the suit.

952
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:08,467
He's actually going to be
wearing a policeman outfit.

953
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:09,801
Yes.
That's what I was informed.

954
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:10,536
OK.
So then let's use the guard.

955
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:10,836
Sure.
That'd be fine.

956
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:14,673
Freeze!

957
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:16,108
And don't move either!

958
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,076
Come on in there.

959
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:18,044
Joe's got a live one.

960
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,045
Hurry up, hurry up.

961

Don't move.

962
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:20,913

LLOYD KAUFMAN: He's dead.

964
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:22,581
It's been dead.

965
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:23,682
This is the end of the movie.

966
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,458
We're just going to
do that little piece,

967
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,859
So we can get to
the fire, I guess.

969
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,861

with the farting PA piece.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: Tell
everybody to start in close.

972
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,669
And then as Fart
Boy comes through,

973
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,337
Everybody goes back,
because they know there's

974
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,939
A dangerous situation coming.

975
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,307
We're in the
fuckin' pickle here.

00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:18,637
No, that's his real underwear.

00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,407
It keeps the fire off of
me, so I don't get hot.

1061
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,243
INTERVIEWER: So what are some
things you have to, like,

1062
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:39,211
Focus on when you're
going this stunt?

1063
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:40,679
[Sighs] Stay calm.

1064
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,182
No big movements at all,
because big movements...

1065
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:45,884
I move the wrong way
like this, and flames

1066
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,620
Would whip from around my
back, and whip up to my face.

1067
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,090
And there's a chance that I
could [sniffs] inhale fire.

1068
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:54,560
So you gotta be very careful.

1069
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,528
INTERVIEWER: How many of
these have you done before?

1070
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,330
Uh, this is my third one.

1071
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,265
INTERVIEWER: Still exciting?

1072
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:01,667
Of course.

1073
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,870
INTERVIEWER: Is this just a
precautionary bed or something?

1074
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,937
Yeah, just precaution.

1075
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,439
INTERVIEWER: OK, good.

1076
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,441

MAN: [inaudible] same clothes,
same build, same skin color.

1078
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,147
INTERVIEWER: I
know, it's perfect.

1079
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:18,650
MAN: Rolling.

1084
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:28,227
MAN: Set and action!

1085
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,195
You're up, kid.

1086
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:29,995
Go.

1087
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:33,098
[Screams]

1088
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:38,470
MAN: Go down.

1089
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,305
Ah!

1090
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,406
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut, cut, cut.

1091
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:44,543
MAN: That's a cut, that's a cut.

1092
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,012
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
the stunt was harrowing.

1093
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:50,716
I was so worried about
the man in the afro,

1094
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:51,683
The guy in the afro with...

1095
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:52,718
The little candle on his back.

1096
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:53,685
Tiny, little... yeah.

1097
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,521
[Laughter]

1098
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:57,423
Plus, I love the way the stunt
guys are all like cowboys.

1099
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:59,391
You know?
OK, get ready, ready.

1100
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,091
MAN: The testosterone
[inaudible].

1101
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:01,126
What was it?
OK?

1102
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:02,160
You're up, kid, go.

1103
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:03,462
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Getting all pumped up.

1104
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:04,696
And then the next thing...
It's like this little flame

1105
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:05,897
About this big.

1106
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,399
And then the guy... and
the wig was an afro, too.

1107
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,767
That was hilarious.

1108
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:12,271
There was also a wonderful piece
of you with the wall of fire

1109
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:14,873
That was like... I mean,
a lot of it looked phony,

1110
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,543
But there was one two-second
piece where, I mean,

1111
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:19,745
You really look... and your
acting was great, too.

1112
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,747
And it really looked like
you were engulfed in fire.

1113
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:22,648
MAN: That was kinda fun.

1114
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:23,449
MAN: And action!

1115
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:26,084
MAN: [wails]

1116
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,090
MAN: Be still, though,
with your face.

1117
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,991
[Wails]

1118
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:33,792
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Line?

1119
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:37,763
I just wanted to get laid.

1120
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,165
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do it again
with the flame a little lower.

1121
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:41,600
MAN: A little lower.

1122
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,270
LLOYD KAUFMAN: But the wall of
fire thing worked very good.

1123
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:48,574
MAN: Action!

1124
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,378
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Keep going.

1125
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:53,712
Go again!

1126
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:55,681
Can you do another blast?

1127
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:56,482
All right.

1128
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:01,720
MAN: Another blast is good?

1129
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,954
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut, I
think we're all right.

1130
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,523
Your makeup is horrible.

1131
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:05,324
Horrifying.

1132
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:06,558
MAN: Yeah.

1133
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,494
That was, uh... I could just
tell... when I walked out

1134
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:09,528
There and I saw everyone like...

1135
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:10,329
Go-od.

1136
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,867
That just stopped
me in my tracks.

1137
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,371
Ruth, that looks great.

1138
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,206
And your face
looks all misshapen

1139
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:23,509
'Cause of the [inaudible].

1140
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,977
MAN: You look like one of
those ghouls that came out

1141
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,614
Of the graveyard in "Thriller."

1142
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:31,149
[Laughter]

1143
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,819
Hermaphrodite.

1144
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:34,886
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh, my god.

1145
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,322
Shit, mon.

1146
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:37,423
MAN: That's a nice one, too.

1147
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:38,724
LLOYD KAUFMAN: What
the heck is that thing?

1148
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:40,225
It's from that shit.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: What is that?

1149
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:41,693
It looks like...
It's glue.

1150
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:43,962
I've tried baby oil.

1151
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,064
I've tried... I
mean, it'll come off

1152
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:47,098
The next time I have to get...

1153
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,233
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Well, I'll tell ya,

1154
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:51,236
That scene was... that
was a disturbing makeup.

1155
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:53,705
I mean... I mean now that you're
out of it, [inaudible] dead.

1156
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,240
MAN: You know, I never
got to see myself.

1157
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:56,442
So I could look
down and see that.

1158
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:59,277
But I never got to
look in the mirror.

1159
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:00,812
So it would be a
nice surprise for me.

1160
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:01,647
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It was
pretty [inaudible].

1161
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:02,681
Oh, Jesus, it was disturbing.

1162
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,916
MAN: We're picking
it up here from when

1163
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,753
Moose goes in with the knife
and continuing through.

1164
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:12,558
The whole thing with the dousing
and the lasso, [inaudible].

1165
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:13,959
[Screaming]

1166
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,093
Doing the lasso stuff.

1167
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:16,328
All that's happening now.

1168
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,330
Everyone's running
in, doing our actions.

1169
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,831
So let's set up.

1170
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,300
Let's have everybody in place.

1171
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:24,135
INTERVIEWER: What are
we waiting for here?

1172
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,972
[Makes explosion noise]

1173
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,744
This is where we're gonna blow
up... this is... I get blown up.

1174
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:33,679
I know.

1175
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,280
I've got to get
blown up later on.

1176
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,483
WOMAN: Why are you wearing
a nice shirt with jeans?

1177
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,084
Because this shirt
gets... I needed three.

1178
00:38:39,184 --> 00:38:41,387
They needed three exact
shirts to get blown up.

1179
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,254
And this dummy's going
to wear the shirt,

1180
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:45,190
So it can't be short-sleeved.

1181
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,093
It can't be... so I have to
have long sleeves, you see?

1182
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,294
MAN: It's very simple.

1183
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:51,630
You're either going
to have a dummy flying

1184
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,465
Through the air in
pieces, or you're

1185
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:54,533
Going to have a fireball.

1186
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:55,801
One or the other, right?

1187
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:58,637
Yeah, because if you can't
blow the dummy up, right,

1188
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:02,273
Like, blow it in pieces
and see it if it's

1189
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,308
In the middle of a fireball.

1190
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:04,610
MAN: Because it just
won't be visible.

1191
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,977
MAN: Right.

1192
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,547
So you have to decide if you
want to do a dummy blowing up

1193
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,181
In the air, like,
in pieces with just

1194
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,618
Some smoke and sparkle inside.

1195
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:15,487
Or you want to have a
fireball around the dummy.

1196
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,923
There's a possibility
you won't see anything

1197
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:22,494
Except for this fireball.

1198
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:23,995
And then it'll be
now you see it,

1199
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,631
Now you don't kind of thing.

1200
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:28,534
MAN: Yeah.

1201
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:30,936
MAN: What we're doing is
we're making a device that'll

1202
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,906
Save the camera from
getting any kind of debris

1203
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,977
Or any kind of flame
exposure to this explosion

1204
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,412
That we're going
to be doing today.

1205
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:41,913
Now you might want
to cover your ears.

1206
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:43,415
It's going to be very loud.

1207
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,350
MAN: Fire in the hole.

1208
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:47,318
MAN: And action!

1209
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:49,287
[Explosion]

1210
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:51,256
Holy shit.

1211
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:54,660
[Applause and cheers]

1212
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,597
The best explosion
in Troma history.

1213
00:39:58,697 --> 00:39:59,565
Awesome.

1214
00:39:59,665 --> 00:40:01,399
That was well worth the wait.

1215
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,669
That was...

1216
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:04,870
MAN: Charlotte, how
does it feel now

1217
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,538
That your father was blown up?

1218
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:07,906
I feel very proud of him.

1219
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:11,643
I fee like he really, you know,
risked his life for the camera.

1220
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,011
MAN: [laughs]

1221
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:14,045
Big explosion.

1222
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,313
Larry Benjamin jumps on top.

1223
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,448
Boom!

1224
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:19,217
And then all of a
sudden, it's raining Ben.

1225
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,819
Hallelujah.

1226
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:21,653
It was amazing.

1227
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,354
We were pleasantly surprised.

1228
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:27,092
Everything on this movie
so far has been sort of how

1229
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:28,426
We deal with disappointment.

1230
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,496
And that was one thing that
lived up to our expectations

1231
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,097
And possibly exceeded them.

1232
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:34,933
So I'm very happy
with the explosion.

1233
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:36,167
Bits of Lloyd flew everywhere.

1234
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,604
This was tremendous
gratification.

1235
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,105
I think I'm gonna
get a loop tape of it

1236
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:41,707
And just roll it over
and over and over again.

1237
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:42,741
Jesus.

1238
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:44,442
Look, it blew him
out of the sneakers.

1239
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:45,243
Damn.

1240
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,012
Or did they go up and fall?

1241
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,046
Yeah, what...

1242
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:48,980
No, he...

1243
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,115
[Inaudible] his
sneakers at all?

1244
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:51,550
No, the sneakers
were, like, attached.

1245
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,220
It's just I don't think not
too well, and just [inaudible].

1246
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,154
[Laughter]

1247
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:56,822
Blew the body out
of the sneakers.

1248
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:57,656
It's beautiful, man.

1249
00:40:57,756 --> 00:40:58,657
Blew himself out of the Nikes.

1250
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:01,493
WOMAN: These are my sneakers.

1251
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:03,729
MAN: It's, mm, almost 10:00.

1252
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,230
We have a lot of
scenes to shoot.

1253
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,867
It's our first
day in New Jersey.

1254
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:15,006
We're planning to pack in
all these people over here.

1255
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:19,177
MAN: Plus all these people
that are in the car.

1256
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,546
[Laughs]

1257
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,914
MAN: It's been a
hectic first day.

1258
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:26,451
And considering after we worked
on scene 58 for three days

1259
00:41:26,552 --> 00:41:29,054
Straight, this is
a welcome change.

1260
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:32,357
Hopefully, we will get
there and we won't all

1261
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:33,825
Get yelled at too much.

1262
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,293
Anyone from the Art department?

1263
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,228
It's supposed to be a movie set.

1264
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,363
MAN: Art department...

1265
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:41,633
Now, we need movie props
like cameras and things.

1266
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,602
And we need to get actors.

1267
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:46,037
We need to get the
running group, right?

1268
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,173
So [inaudible] should be in it.

1269
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:48,974
MAN: I'll get the cover.

1270
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:49,941
WOMAN: Front camera?

1271
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,442
Thanks.

1272
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:57,382
[Inaudible] is this scene
is... was wrongly scheduled.

1273
00:41:57,482 --> 00:42:00,418
And that it's too
big, and it should've

1274
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,753
Been put some other time.

1275
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,121
We're gonna be here forever.

1276
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,523
And Lloyd is this
close to blowing up.

1277
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:06,858
[Explosion noise]

1278
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:08,827
It looks like he wants
to go in that direction.

1279
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,829
Let's start getting
people moving around.

1280
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,298
It's after the bathroom,
right? [Inaudible].

1281
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,769
Meanwhile, the background
is being organized.

1282
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,270
The sound man is listening.

1283
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,240
So when we give
him a [inaudible],

1284
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,642
He'll have some ideas.

1285
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,744
You have any idea when they're
going to get to me tonight?

1286
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:26,978
INTERVIEWER: I do not know.

1287
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,313
We're trying to bang
out a lot of shots.

1288
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:31,016
You're definitely
getting your shot in.

1289
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:33,018
Well, if it's not done today,
I mean, I'm not going to be...

1290
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:33,919
I can't be here tomorrow.

1291
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:34,720
INTERVIEWER: Mm-hm.

1292
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,520
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hold it.

1293
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:37,689
Where's the sound guy?

1294
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,658
Get the sound guy
here, and watch this.

1295
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:41,126
Where is the sound man?

1296
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:42,127
(SHOUTING) [inaudible].

1297
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,903
I gave up a whole day's
work of money for nothing?

1298
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,705
I mean, they called me
for 9:00 this morning.

1299
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:54,940
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Working
on backgrounds,

1300
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,175
We're gonna have this
huge thing happening now.

1301
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:58,409
It's all developing.

1302
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,378
If you could shut
up and organize it,

1303
00:43:00,478 --> 00:43:02,080
The natural course
will take over

1304
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,314
And we'll get a good scene.

1305
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,783
So let's just keep working.

1306
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:05,784
Everyone concentrate.

1307
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:06,752
I took a day off from work.

1308
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:07,719
Then they tell me it's 10:00.

1309
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:09,187
Then they tell me it's 12:00.

1310
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:10,555
And then they tell me it's 2:00.

1311
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:11,890
And [inaudible].

1312
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,358
And I can't stay... and I'm
not staying till 11:00 either.

1313
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:15,326
I got to get up tomorrow
morning and go to work.

1314
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,394
LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right, folks.

1315
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:17,362
This is beautiful.

1316
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:18,363
Action.

1317
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:19,164
[Inaudible].

1318
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,802
LLOYD KAUFMAN: You're about 10
minutes too late there, Neve.

1319
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:26,471
The minute she turns
to move, get in there.

1320
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:27,272
Goddammit.

1321
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:28,740
Can people listen, please?

1322
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,742
And Adam, you listen
and translate.

1323
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:33,211
Because obviously, I'm not
speaking the same language.

1324
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:34,212
So just translate.

1325
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:35,781
Speak their... whatever
they're talking.

1326
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:37,182
ADAM: They didn't hear you.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Sorry.

1327
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,316
I'm sorry.

1328
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:39,417
It's just she was doing
the same goddamn thing.

1329
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:41,119
Otherwise, I'm on air
here for 10 minutes.

1330
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,620
No purpose on the dolly.

1331
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,089
We're setting up
the beautiful thing.

1332
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:45,090
[Interposing voices]

1333
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,091
Don't do this!

1334
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,558
Don't do anything
like that, dammit!

1335
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:50,295
It's taking that energy
away from over here.

1336
00:43:50,395 --> 00:43:52,030
Don't do anything!

1337
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,498
It's a very complicated shot.

1338
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:55,734
If this were in a Hollywood
studio, you'd be here for weeks

1339
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:57,135
Doing it.

1340
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:00,438
[Inaudible] two weeks setting
up one fucking shot like this.

1341
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:04,409
Don't do anything that
pulls away from the energy.

1342
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,077
See what she's
doing right there?

1343
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:07,112
Stop.

1344
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:09,047
Just everybody, let
this thing happen.

1345
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:09,881
Ready?

1346
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,316
MAN: Slate in.
Roll sound.

1347
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:12,317
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Don't fight it.

1348
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:13,919
Do not fight it.

1349
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:15,020
Flow with it.
[beep]

1350
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,854
MAN: Mark.

1351
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:16,822
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Part of the dao.

1352
00:44:16,922 --> 00:44:17,723
Ready?

1353
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,324
MAN: Ready.

1354
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:20,125
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

1355
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,365
Have you seen Christine?

1356
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:28,599
Uh, yeah.

1357
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,037
I think she went outside
to, uh, practice her lines.

1358
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:33,872
Fresh air improves memory.

1359
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:35,240
I knew that.

1360
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,108
Everybody thinks
I don't know shit.

1361
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,076
DJ knows shit.

1362
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:48,987
Ma, I drip like a leaky
faucet for that guy.

1363
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:50,856
No.

1364
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:51,656
MAN: Hey, coffee?

1365
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:52,991
I already have two.

1366
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:53,792
Aw, shit!

1367
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:54,726
Fuckin' hot!

1368
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:57,262
Oh-oh, it hurts, doesn't it?

1369
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,364
Well, maybe it
wouldn't hurt so bad

1370
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:00,698
If there wasn't so much of it?

1371
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:05,370
You see, when I send you to
get cups, I mean small ones.

1372
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:08,807
We use small cups, so people
don't leave huge, full cups

1373
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:10,508
Of coffee lying around.

1374
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:12,143
You understand?
(WEAKLY) Uhhuh.

1375
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:14,712
Now, what's the
rather painful lesson

1376
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:16,314
To be learned here today?

1377
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:18,817
Uh, small cups.

1378
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:19,751
Good.

1379
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:20,852
Remember next time.

1380
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,590
Switch to fuckin' decaf.

1381
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,391
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Cut.

1382
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,192
Beautiful.

1383
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:28,259
OK.

1384
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:29,460
MAN: We got to do that again.
MAN: Adam.

1385
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,762
LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right, quiet!
Quiet!

1386
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:31,596
MAN: Quiet, please, guys.

1387
00:45:31,696 --> 00:45:32,530
We need [inaudible].

1388
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,601
JOE FLEISHAKER: Why did they
have to change the schedule

1389
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:37,668
And not do my scene?

1390
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:38,904
I don't know the reasons.

1391
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:40,806
But the reasons did not
deal with... did not consider

1392
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,273
My concerns and my needs.

1393
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:43,875
So what am I 'sposed to do?

1394
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,376
Give up my job, not
do my regular job?

1395
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,744
Not go to work tomorrow?

1396
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:48,746
I can't come and be
here till midnight.

1397

MAN: We're not
planning on keeping

1398
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:50,882

00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:52,383
Right now it is a
quarter past 7:00.

1400
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:53,584
OK.

1401

MAN: We're knocking off
a quick scene with Lloyd.

1402
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,221
And then we're planning
on shooting your scene.

1403
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:57,722
Oh, that's... well,
nobody told me that.

1404
00:45:57,823 --> 00:45:59,958
I'm hearing people getting
ready to do other scenes.

1405
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:01,092
MAN: You're busy yelling.

1406
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:02,393
Well, maybe.

1407
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,795
But I wasn't yelling until
you came over to talk to me.

1408
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,596
All I hear is that you're
threatening to leave.

1409
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,465
I have to leave set in
the middle of a scene

1410
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:09,835
To come back here and tell you
that I want you in this movie?

1411
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:12,003
I was just concerned that it
seemed like other scenes were

1412
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,771
Being pushed and pushed and
pushed in between after I

1413
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,173
Already [inaudible].

1414
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:18,977
And I just can't be pushed later
and later and later, because I

1415
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:20,311
Have to get out of here.

1416
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,948
And as you well know, I
have my limitations, too.

1417
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:24,382
I get out of here
at 12:00 tonight,

1418
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:27,252
I'm not going to be able
to work on time tomorrow.

1419
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:29,921
We can do your scene as quickly
or as slowly as we need to.

1420
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:31,789
Well, [inaudible]
is not a problem.

1421
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,624
Because I want the scene to
come out right [inaudible].

1422
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:35,060
I'm not walking out [inaudible].

1423
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,434
Will made the midget cry.

1424
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,770
MAN: You wanna do the last,
full rehearsal, Lloyd?

1425
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:47,372
Is Jim leaving?

1426
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,274
Are you splitting?

1427
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:50,675
OK, thanks.

1428
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:52,743
I want him to put Theo's
makeup kit on his head,

1429
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,312
So she had some leverage.

1430
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,814
MAN: Oh, you don't want
to be in the scene?

1431
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:58,549
You don't want to
be in this film?

1432
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:13,364
MAN: Well, this is just kind of
a... it is the making of a film.

1433
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,033
So there's, like,
behind the scenes.

1434
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:15,833
Yeah.

1435
00:47:15,934 --> 00:47:17,268
[Shouting]

1436
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:18,736
MAN: You're not digging it?

1437
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,670
Not really.

1438
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:25,143
I'll come see it.

1439
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:25,944
MAN: All right.

1440
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:26,744
Good luck.

1441
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,588
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Dead cow?

1442
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:41,059
MAN: So guys, can we have
everyone here, please?

1443
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,527
LLOYD KAUFMAN: He
doesn't have to change!

1444
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:44,029
He doesn't have to change!

1445
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:47,032
Just get the one guy out, and
get Michael to lie down here.

1446
00:47:47,132 --> 00:47:48,166
And get the cow head!

1447
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:49,200
INTERVIEWER: Like, what
kind of acting technique

1448
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,601
Do you encourage?

1449
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:54,639
Meisner, Stanislavski method,
for the average actor person?

1450
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:55,974
I don't.

1451
00:47:56,074 --> 00:48:00,045
I think I just let them take
over and do their own thing.

1452
00:48:00,145 --> 00:48:03,248
We did have a scene yesterday
with one of our production

1453
00:48:03,348 --> 00:48:04,782
Assistants named Joey.

1454
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:09,287
He played a part
on the film, and...

1455
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,321
Just come in.

1456
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:11,522
Just do your entrance, right?

1457
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,723
You know the line?

1458
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,460
[Interposing voices]

1459
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:21,732
I, of course, had to get
the performance out of him.

1460
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:22,900
So...

1461
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:24,402
[Interposing voices]

1462
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:25,670
MAN: Everyone's very quiet.

1463
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,604
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action, Joey!

1464
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:28,273
[Whooshing noise]

1465
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:30,108
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Oh,
you're smiling.

1466
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,076
What am I doing?

1467
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:31,909
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Just come in oh, he

1468
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:32,810
Doesn't know what he's doing?

1469
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,145
[Interposing voices]

1470
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,146
Did anybody give him the line?

1471
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,581
Benjamin's first rule.

1472
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:39,150
[Interposing voices]

1473
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,518
OK.

1474
00:48:40,618 --> 00:48:42,487
But you understand, you're just
like trying to put him out.

1475
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,489
He's on fi... he's on fire,
and you're [inaudible].

1476
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:45,423
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Just come in.

1477
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:46,624
Just do your entrance, right?

1478
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:49,894
And action!

1479
00:48:49,995 --> 00:48:54,299
Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

1480
00:48:57,668 --> 00:48:58,536
OK.

1481
00:48:58,636 --> 00:48:59,504
Let's go back here.

1482
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:07,145
And the Oscar goes to...

1483
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:08,546
[Laughter]

1484
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,081
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I felt the best
way to do it was to just yell

1485
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,549
And scream, and...

1486
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:14,019
Just get fuckin'
serious, fuckin' scared.

1487
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,387
Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

1488
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:17,722
Do it.
Ready?

1489
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:18,723
Benjamin's first...
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Don't.

1490
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:19,857
You're smiling.
You're smiling.

1491
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,626
Benjamin's first rule
of production, safety...

1492
00:49:21,726 --> 00:49:22,227
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Enunciate.
Ready?

1493
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:23,028
Wait for action.

1494
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:24,262
And... don't smile.

1495
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:25,863
If you smile, you can eat
someone else's dinner.

1496
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:26,697
You ready?

1497
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,498
Ready?

1498
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:28,766
And action.

1499
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:31,202
Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

1500
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,470
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Bigger.

1501
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,840
Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

1502
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,709
Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

1503
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,977
LLOYD KAUFMAN: But
bigger, bigger.

1504
00:49:40,078 --> 00:49:43,414
Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

1505
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:44,682
OK.

1506
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:47,452
Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

1507
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:48,586
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.

1508
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,755
Keep... you gotta keep
the thing going, right?

1509
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:51,556
Here we go.

1510
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:52,390
Once more.

1511
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,191
Action!

1512
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,994
Benjamin's first
rule of production.

1513
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:57,995
Safety to humans.

1514
00:49:58,096 --> 00:49:58,796
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.

1515
00:49:58,896 --> 00:49:59,797
And then you'll run off.

1516
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:00,698
Again.

1517
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:01,966
Ready?

1518
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:03,134
No stupidity now. [Inaudible].

1519
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:04,435
Go back.
Do it again.

1520
00:50:04,535 --> 00:50:05,536
Again.
You still don't have it.

1521
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,038
You know, I'll yell out
at him every... right

1522
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:12,377
Before every take, act, act,
act, act, act, act, act, act!

1523
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:13,511
Now everybody else
stop stupidity.

1524
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:15,580
Right?
Just everyone close, please.

1525
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,448
You guys just don't do anything.
Right?

1526
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:18,849
He's got to concentrate.
MAN: OK, quiet.

1527
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:19,917
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Now
start acting, Joey!

1528
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:20,718
Here we go.

1529
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:21,952

1530
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,422

But you have to keep
the energy going, right?

1533
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,161
Safety to humans!

1534
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:30,961
Right?

1535
00:50:31,062 --> 00:50:31,929
You've seen cartoons, right?

1536
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:32,730
Yeah.

1537
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:33,531
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Go.

1538
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:34,399
Do it like that, right?

1539
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:35,600
Ready?
Again.

1540
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,834
Back [inaudible].
MAN: Quiet, please.

1541
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:37,735
Here we go.
Reset.

1542
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:38,669
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Start acting.

1543
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:39,637
Come on.

1544
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:40,438
Ready?

1545
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,307
Standing by.

1546
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,509
Action!

1547
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:46,010
No, you're smiling
when you come in.

1548
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:46,811
You're not smiling.

1549
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,612
You gotta act.

1550
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:48,946
Otherwise, please.

1551
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:49,880
Do the acting.

1552
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,217
Action.

1553
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:55,019
Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans!

1554
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,087
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Safety to humans.

1555
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:56,921
But keep it going.

1556
00:50:57,021 --> 00:50:57,988
You're doing, safety to humans.

1557
00:50:58,089 --> 00:50:59,390
And you don't want to be...
Or no, I want-

1558
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:00,225
WOMAN: You're going
to go... you're

1559
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:01,226
Gonna go and put the fire out.

1560
00:51:01,326 --> 00:51:02,293
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hold the emotion.

1561
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,894
Hold the emotion.
Right?

1562
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:04,729
WOMAN: I know, but...

1563
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:05,530
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Ready.

1564
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,432
Action!

1565
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:10,468
Benjamin's first rule of
production, safety to humans.

1566
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:11,902
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, that's it.
[laughter]

1567
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:13,238
Now pull the thing out.
Pull the thing out.

1568
00:51:13,338 --> 00:51:14,305
Shh...

1569
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,440
LLOYD KAUFMAN: What's
so fuckin' funny?

1570
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,474
You're losing light, and
the guy isn't acting.

1571
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:17,575
Come on.

1572
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:19,244
You... you gotta keep
in character right now.

1573
00:51:19,344 --> 00:51:22,180
We'll do one more
rehearsal for focus.

1574
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,114
Action!

1575
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,749
Act!

1576
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,784

1577
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:27,818
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.

1578
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,086
But... now, why did
you look over there?

1579
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,088
Why did you look
over to this guy?

1580
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:33,258
Because the action is back here.

1581
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:35,160
You started looking over here,
and then you looked, like,

1582
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:37,862
Over there as if somebody
was summoned there to... you

1583
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:39,096
Know what I mean?
JOEY: Yeah.

1584
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,431
I... I guess I had a [inaudible].

1585
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:41,266
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Look
in the same spot.

1586
00:51:41,366 --> 00:51:42,200
Look at this man in the glasses.

1587
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,100
Or look at my hands.

1588
00:51:43,201 --> 00:51:44,335
See where my hand is?

1589
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,670
OK.

1590
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,372
So just be looking there,
and then you'll go off frame.

1591
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:48,506
Ready?

1592
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:49,307
OK.

1593
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:50,341
Start some smoke.

1594
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,709
MAN: Let's start
the smoke, please.

1595
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:52,943
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Here
we go, everybody.

00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,331
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK.

MAN: Cut!

1608
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:16,401
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Very good.

1609
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:17,202
All right.

1610
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:21,272
That's sort of how I
did the Joey technique.

1611
00:52:21,372 --> 00:52:23,107
And indeed, he acted.

1612
00:52:23,208 --> 00:52:26,177
But that's because he had not
really been acting very much.

1613
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:29,113
Also, I don't know who's
in charge of casting.

1614
00:52:29,214 --> 00:52:31,916
But somebody should have
gotten a decent actor to play

1615
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:34,051
That part yesterday, right?

1616
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,820
We shouldn't be putting
actors in these parts

1617
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,422
Unless they can act.

1618
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:39,490
There's a shitload
of actors out there.

1619
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,159
Anybody could've done it
except for that kid, Joey.

1620
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,062
But now that he's in it,
we gotta keep him going.

1621
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,232
We have to keep him...
Tying him into this thing.

1622
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:49,133
Can you make sure
that Joey is here.

1623
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:50,801
He's supposed to be
in this next scene.

1624
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:51,902
Is here today?

1625
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,005
No, Andy... she said
she found a new monkey.

1626
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:55,973
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hey, cut, cut.

1627
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:59,877
Why are you standing up?

1628
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:01,779
WOMAN: Did you want
Joey saying something?

1629
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:02,447
Just...
No.

1630
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:03,248
WOMAN: No?
- Joey?

1631
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:04,048
No, he should just be there.

1632
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:06,684
Joey should be there, huh?

1633
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:07,685
That's my big break.

1634
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:11,222
I'm gonna fucking shoot myself.

1635
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:12,089
Let's go see the shit.

1636
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,829
Yeah, we were talking about
the shit in the costume.

1637
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:22,233
I think we should just place
the costume on top of the guy

1638
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:23,734
And pretend... like,
let's say instead

1639
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:27,171
Of putting the shit in your
pants, just you would be naked.

1640
00:53:27,272 --> 00:53:28,573
Well, you'd be in
your underpants.

1641
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:29,540
You'd lie down on the ground.

1642
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,108
You'd put the shit on your ass.

1643
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,310
Big pile of shit.

1644
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,945
And then we'd gently lay
the costume on top of you

1645
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,281
Like a blanket.

1646
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:38,616
And then we'd just sort of
like pretend it was coming off.

1647
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:47,658
INTERVIEWER: Is it good?

1648
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:48,459
Nope.

00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:54,465

00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:02,840

00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,310
This isn't chocolate...

1652
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:06,477
This isn't chocolate pudding.

1654
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:09,146

worth it for Troma.

The shit I go through
to make art for Troma.

1674
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:25,956
I love it.

00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:26,924
[Burps]

1676
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,798
Lloyd, in terms of having some
juicy scenes tomorrow, right?

1677
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:35,766
Yeah, we should
get into the juice.

1678
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:37,368
Do the PA getting
his legs cut off?

1679
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:38,469
Yeah.

1680
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:40,471
And the guy's face being
melted by the light.

1681
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:41,972
That's like two
fairly... I mean, they're

1682
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,442
Not long scenes, but the
effects and stuff, right?

1683
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:45,543
Sure, do 'em.

1684
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:48,413
You need a place where
you can dig a hole,

1685
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:52,783
Because the person has to be
there and sitting in the hole

1686
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:55,119
With his legs down below.

1687
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:56,587
Now, maybe there's a
place like right over...

1688
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:57,655
Oh, I see.

1689
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:58,956
And then his legs
have got to be buried.

1690
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:00,791
So you bury... what you do
is when you bury his legs...

1691
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:02,026
I need to figure out
somewhere outside, right?

1692
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:03,260
You're going
to have the stumps.

1693
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,629
You're going to have,
like, the stumps.

1694
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:05,863
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I understand that.

1695
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,465
Totally.

1696
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:09,266

00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,267
Legs chopped off [inaudible].

1698
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,569
Now, hold it.

1699
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:13,303
If you could just find some
grass where I [inaudible].

1700
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:14,839
And then have them dig a hole.

1701
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:17,808
But unfortunately, we need the
trucks to be able to... it's got

1702
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:20,277
To be the same kind of ground
that the trucks can come back...

1703
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,311
Or that cars can...

1704
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:22,346
Wonderful.

1705
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:23,380
INTERVIEWER: What'd
you just do there?

1706
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:24,582
You... you just found the, uh...

1707
00:56:24,682 --> 00:56:26,150
That's where the squashing
Edward [inaudible].

1708
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,621
So it starts off
you're scanning

1709
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,890
The area for hazards, right?

1710
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:35,092
You're, like, looking around.

1711
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:37,061
The crew's looking
around over here, too.

1712
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:37,962
They're a little dispersed.

1713
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,602
LLOYD KAUFMAN: On these
Troma, you ought to always

1714
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:45,636
Have some blood on set.

1715
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:46,437
OK.

1716
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:47,672
Let's just finish this off.

1717
00:56:47,772 --> 00:56:49,173
So the trucks are coming in.

1718
00:56:49,273 --> 00:56:51,442
He finishes his speech.

1719
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:53,611
And wham, bam!

1720
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:55,245
He's cut in half.

1721
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,615
He's down on the ground now.

1722
00:56:57,715 --> 00:56:59,183
And members of the crew jump up.

1723
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:00,150
MAN: And there's that line.

1724
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,952
That's when the
crew will disperse.

1725
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:03,921
A couple of people will
go to the front of the van

1726
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:05,523
To see who's driving 'em.

1727
00:57:05,623 --> 00:57:06,624
And then...

00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:07,792

1730
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,228
And then these two lines.

1731
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:13,698
Yeah, yeah, your lines.

1732
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:17,768
Why you... you guys
gotta continue the fight

1738
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:28,913

and head back to holding.

1740
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:32,349
We're going to bring
you out in a little bit

1741
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,987
When we do the reversal and we
see the legs... the [inaudible]

1742
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:38,222

except the asshole PA.

1927
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,096
INTERVIEWER: What can you
tell me about baring it all?

1928
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:28,032
Very liberating but
it ain't over yet.

1929
01:04:28,132 --> 01:04:32,602
I got to run to 42nd Street
now, Times Square, baby.

1930
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,738
MAN: The whole world will be
familiar with the geography...

1931
01:04:34,838 --> 01:04:35,572
Big Apple!

1932
01:04:35,672 --> 01:04:37,041
Of your gonads, my friend.

1933
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:37,841
YANIV SHARON: Yeah!

1934
01:04:37,942 --> 01:04:38,842
Yes, Yaniv.

1935
01:04:38,943 --> 01:04:40,510
We're filming in
the street tomorrow.

1936
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:41,311
INTERVIEWER: Yeah?

1937
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:42,412
In, like, Times Square?

1938
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:43,813
Yeah, the guy's going
to run through Times

1939
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:44,681
Square with no clothes on.

1940
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,020
INTERVIEWER: Yaniv,
how are feeling today?

1941
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,455
Nervous as hell, y'all.

1942
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:52,889
Nervous as hell.

1943
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:53,757
It's all right.

1944
01:04:53,857 --> 01:04:54,558
It's all right, though.

1945
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:55,892
It's gonna be a good scene.

1946
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:58,195
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Should be a
wide shot of this Times Square.

1947
01:04:58,295 --> 01:04:59,763
And Yaniv... it should be empty.

1948
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:02,699
And Yaniv's butt
should come into frame.

1949
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,135
And he bumps into
that post there.

1950
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,303
Go ahead.

1951
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:07,271
No.
Stop.

1952
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:08,072
Goddammit!

1953
01:05:08,172 --> 01:05:08,872
Here.

1954
01:05:08,973 --> 01:05:10,207
Just do what I do.

1955
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:11,475
Watch.

1956
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,477
You come in here, and you
do like this. [Inaudible].

1957
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:14,945
Just do like that. [Inaudible].

1958
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:20,817
It's all moving very tight here.

1959

MAN: Very quiet.

1960
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:22,786

MAN: And ready?

1962
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:25,389
Here we go, folks.

Ready and Brendan, set?

MAN: He stopped on his own
in the middle of the shot.

1968
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,178
So what?

1969
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:49,846
Don't have Edward
talk to them, right?

1970
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:50,914
Just leave it alone.

1971
01:05:51,015 --> 01:05:52,216
The guy doesn't know
where the camera is.

1972
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:53,650
See?
Now you got an angry guy.

1973
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:54,451
He's never gonna leave.

1974
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:55,752
Just let the guy alone.

1975
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:58,255
Let him walk, and get him
out of the fucking picture.

1976
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:07,831
MAN: So we might as well give
him holes for him to look.

1977
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:09,299
MAN: You don't see
the front of him.

1978
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:10,800
We just see his ass.

1979
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:12,269
Did you know that
guy wasn't an extra?

1980
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:13,070
No.

1981
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,404
I didn't see him.

1982
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:17,341
Out of nowhere, I
just... just bang.

1983
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:18,708
MAN: Oh, man.

1984
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,410

I'm ready to shoot.

1987
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:25,882
Yeah!

Out!

1989
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:27,684
Action!

1991
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:44,334

[Cheers and applause]

1994
01:07:02,086 --> 01:07:04,154
We gotta... they're gonna... you
have to wrap it up for today.

1995
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:06,556
They're not gonna let
him shoot anymore here.

1996
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:08,658
And that's about it.

1997
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,594
When I got there...
They called action.

1998
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:11,695
And I just ran.

1999
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:14,298
I did my thing, tried to
go as crazy as possible.

2000
01:07:14,398 --> 01:07:15,232
I hit the pole.

2001
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:16,433
Then I zigzagged.

2002
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:17,634
And I was running this way.

2003
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:19,536
I was looking at... to
someone to run into.

2004
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:22,639
But I couldn't... when
it was over, the whole

2005
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:23,573
People applauded in me.

2006
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:24,374
It felt great.

2007
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:25,175
It's awesome.

2008

MAN: Half straw.

2009
01:07:30,947 --> 01:07:32,116
Where could half straw be?

2010
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:35,519
WOMAN: Who wants
this up their ass?

2011
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:36,953
[Shouting]

2012
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,055
Not in my ass!

2013
01:07:39,156 --> 01:07:39,856
Dah!

2014
01:07:39,956 --> 01:07:40,657
Right?

2015
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:42,092
And you do it, Jerry, OK?

2016
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:43,460
OK.

2017
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,529
You can just bring it... hit
the table and hit... you know?

2018

So where are you gonna
[inaudible], do you think?

2026
01:07:57,507 --> 01:07:58,908
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I think
that'd be right here.

2027
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:03,513
Just kind of see a behind,
and the beautiful funnel.

2028
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:04,448
And your behind [inaudible].

2029

You feel this, too?

I mean, as much as we can
cheat that underneath, like,

2032
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,386
Your ball sack or something.

2033
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:10,487
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
No, we gotta wedge

2034
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,821
Towels in between his legs.

2035
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,890
Or if you taped... so the
thing'll stay in place.

2036
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:14,958
Whoa-oh.

2037
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:16,193

INTERVIEWER: Have you been
nude on film before, though?

2045
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:30,840
Uh, nah... on stage.

2046
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,742
There's not much call for
me to be nude on film.

2047
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,881
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Keep
it so it doesn't

2048
01:08:37,981 --> 01:08:39,015
Drip in his eyes, please.

2049
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,517
For a first stab,
this looks good.

For number one.

2059
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,833

Out of that area on the top?

2065
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:10,547
Um, she's gonna stab him.

2066
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:14,017

build something

2070
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:28,532
To hold the head stiff.

2071

It's just common sense, man.

Yeah.

If you're [inaudible] you gotta

Underneath and hold onto.

If you think you can do a better
job, then why don't you do it?

2079
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:45,014
BRENDAN: This whole
head has no support.

2080
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,750
It just collapses
like a balloon.

We should all be in
our first position.

2088
01:10:00,564 --> 01:10:03,633
I'm grabbing my balls and stuff
in our scene, can I improve?

2089
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:05,168
Because it's like I... I...

2090

Yeah, sure.

What is it that you don't like?

2092

Well, it's just like
I'm trying to hit on her,

2093
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:11,675
And there's no scene if she's
already grabbing my balls.

Do it?

2098
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:17,681
Have her talk about
the fountain first.

2099
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:19,048
She can grab my
balls after, do you

2100
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,617
Live in the house, Toadster?

2101
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:21,985
Yeah.

Hey!

Nice to see you, man.

2110
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:37,301
He's one of the principal
characters of this movie.

2111
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:39,135
And remember, it's OK to
masturbate as long as it's

2112
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,069
Not against your principle.

2113
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,104
Whoa-ho-ho-ho.

2114
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:42,372
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Come on.
Shut up.

Get out.

2116
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:44,741
I want to keep working on this.

2117
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:45,542
There goes the respect.

Quiet on set!
Where's the love?

2121
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:49,546
Where's the romance?

2122
01:10:49,646 --> 01:10:50,680
All right.
Let's go.

2123
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,481
We gotta rehearse.

2124
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:55,585
I'm gonna take him to meet Ruth.

2125
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:56,386
Right?

01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:58,422
Ruth Pongstaphone.

2127
01:10:58,522 --> 01:11:01,858
We have to block this, so we
can see what the lighting is.

2128
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:02,992
Get out of there, Catherine.

2129
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:03,793
Get out!

2130
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:04,794
Please, just wait.

2131
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:05,762
Wait two minutes.

We're just blocking.
WOMAN: OK.

2133
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:08,298
LLOYD KAUFMAN: This

I gotta do it.
So I'm not pleasant.

I'm sorry.

2136

Ready?

2137
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:12,836
MAN: We're standing
by for rehearsal.

2138
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:13,837
Very quiet.

LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Where's the stunt guy?

2140
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,273
Get Robby here.

2141
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:19,275
Tell him to stay
fucking here, all right?

2142
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:20,844
Uh, how's this feel?

2143
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:22,746
Be able to take the
shoulder down this way.

2144
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:24,914
INTERVIEWER: So have you
fallen down stairs before?

2145
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:26,015
Yes.

2146
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,183
INTERVIEWER: What are
some things you have

2147
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,018
To do to not kill yourself?

2148
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,154
Well, one thing is
what I'm doing now.

2149
01:11:31,254 --> 01:11:35,291
To allow myself the
freedom of movement.

2150
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:38,695
If I didn't have this stuff on,
then I would fall cautiously.

2151
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,163
And it would show on film.

2152
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:48,071

How's it going?
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.

01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:28,478
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Good.
I have a question for you.

2159
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:29,713
Shoot.

2160
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:31,147
LLOYD KAUFMAN: In the
flashback, you sing a song.

2161
01:12:31,247 --> 01:12:32,616
I think it should
be "Amazing Grace."

2162
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:33,550
You know?

2163
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:36,185
When Casey comes
here... and I think

2164
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:37,286
You should sing that same song.

2165
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:38,321
"Amazing Grace."

2166
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:39,523
Oh, the same thing
I sing [inaudible].

2167
01:12:39,623 --> 01:12:40,724
But now it's twisted,
because I have no tongue.

2168
01:12:40,824 --> 01:12:41,425
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah.

[Mumbles]

2170
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:43,292
LLOYD KAUFMAN: But do
you know "Amazing Grace?"

2171
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:44,160
No, but I'll learn it.

01:13:02,846 --> 01:13:04,614
You have 30 seconds to do this.

2176
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,149
The cops won't let
us do it anymore.

2177
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:09,085
We're, like, being
pulled as of, like, now.

2178
01:13:09,185 --> 01:13:11,988
So if we don't do this now
before the Sergeant comes back,

2179
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:13,490
I'd say we're in deep shit.

2180
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:14,891
They're gonna revoke
our license for good.

Excuse me, sir.

2205

I know this must be very painful
for you at a time like this.

2206
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,858
But when did you
first realize your son

2207
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,927
Was a body part-tickling
hermaphroditic lunatic?

We need everybody out of

That is a wrap.

LLOYD KAUFMAN: I don't
know why [inaudible].

2224
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,782
They tell me at the last
minute that... you know,

2225
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:14,784
Rather than telling me at
the beginning of the day,

2226
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:16,285
They tell me at the
last... like now,

2227

off by 8 o'clock.

You gotta be out by 8 o'clock.

It was marked as [inaudible].

You gotta tell me that.

2236
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,397
I don't... I'm assuming
I can shoot all day.

2237

your day ends at 8 o'clock,

01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:37,100
Let's get paper towels.

2275
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,234
Let's get water on
the set right away.

2276
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:39,235
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Excellent, Joe.

2277
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:40,937
I don't want it
dripping in my eyes.

2278
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:41,805
MAN: It's just corn syrup.

2279
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:42,739
I need it over my eyes.

2280
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:43,807
Look, it's gonna
drip into my eyes.

2281
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:45,108
MAN: There's no soap
or anything in it.

2282
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:46,442
MAN: Just water and a napkin.

2283
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,243
MAN: It won't hurt ya.

2284
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:48,044
Don't worry.

2285
01:15:48,144 --> 01:15:49,345
MAN: Water's comin' in.

2286
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:50,814
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Look how nice.
Keep goin'.

2287
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:51,648
Do it faster.

2288
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:52,649
Wee!

2289
01:15:52,749 --> 01:15:54,150
[Inaudible] so much fun.

2290
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,351
Female blood wrestling.

2291
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:56,152
That'd be great.

2292
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:03,126
MAN: 170 on Camera A.

2293
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,761
MAN: Yeah, don't chew 'em.
Just keep 'em there.

2294
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:05,829
Right.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah, that's it.

2295
01:16:05,929 --> 01:16:06,663
Just one more piece.
MAN: That's enough.

2296
01:16:06,763 --> 01:16:07,196
No.
MAN: Come on.

2297
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:08,164
One more.

2298
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:09,298
MAN: One more.

2299
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,133
MAN: It's just bread.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: OK, good.

2300
01:16:10,233 --> 01:16:10,700
All right.
Here we go.

2301
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,637
[Whirring sound]

2302
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,141
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Keep
goin', keep goin'.

2303
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:18,842
MAN: That's it.
Keep goin'.

2304
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:20,309
Ah!
MAN: Good.

2305
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,311
[Slicing noises]

2306
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:23,279
Ah!

2307
01:16:23,379 --> 01:16:26,249
[Shouting]

2308
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:27,717
MAN: OK, everyone.
MAN: That's a cut!

2309
01:16:27,817 --> 01:16:28,517
Yeah!

2310
01:16:28,618 --> 01:16:30,887
[Cheers and applause]

2311
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:32,656
MAN: Uh, Joe!

2312
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:34,157
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Hello,
Joe Fleishaker!

2313
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:36,125
[Cheers and applause]

2314
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:37,861
Joe Fleishaker!

2315
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:39,963
When you wanted to do this
part, I was skeptical.

2316
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,030
That's right, that's right.

2317
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:41,831
Very skeptical.

2318
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,232
And now how do you feel?

2319
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:44,267
Oh, I feel great.

2320
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:46,035
I'm just wondering
if viewers satisfied

2321
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:47,103
With the ultimate result?

2322
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:48,171
LLOYD KAUFMAN: More
than satisfied.

2323
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:49,305
JOE FLEISHAKER: I mean,
don't ask me today

2324
01:16:49,405 --> 01:16:50,840
Whether I'll do it again.

2325
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:51,841
Wait a couple of weeks.

2326
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:53,242
Well, this was the easy part.

2327
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:55,044
Tomorrow you'll have to do your
own stunt down the escalator.

2328
01:16:55,144 --> 01:16:56,145
We forgot to tell you that.

2329
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,214
You have to actually
fall down the escalator.

2330
01:16:58,314 --> 01:17:00,349
Oh, well, then I don't
have to wash this stuff off.

2331
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,284
[Laughter]

2332
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:02,485
I need a paper
towel for my eyes.

2333
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:04,954
I'm about to go blind.

2334
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:06,956
I am not going to be
able to wash my back,

2335
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:09,125
And wash my... you know,
get rid of the [inaudible].

2336
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:10,259
So...
WOMAN: Yeah.

2337
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:11,194
OK.

2338
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:12,161
When I'm at home,
I use a brush,

2339
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:13,897
Because I'm just a big guy.

2340
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:15,398
[Interposing voices]

2341
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:16,900
I refuse to clean up today.

2342
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:24,674
MAN: Again.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right.

2343
01:17:24,774 --> 01:17:25,775
Let them out, folks.

2344
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:27,143
MAN: Come on.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Come on out.

2345
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:27,977
Thank you so much.

2346
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:30,379
MAN: DVD, stop rolling camera.

2347
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:31,881
No, because I can't
reach everywhere anyway.

2348
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,784
So just wanted to give me
a wipe-down [inaudible].

2349
01:17:34,884 --> 01:17:35,584
Ben, can you help me?

2350
01:17:35,685 --> 01:17:37,020
Can somebody help me or what?

2351
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:37,987
MAN: What do you need?

2352
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:39,655
Yeah, can you help me?

2353
01:17:39,756 --> 01:17:40,857
MAN: Is it that much bloo...

2354
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:42,358
JOE FLEISHAKER: Just get
Gabe in here or something.

2355
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:43,860
He can do it, if you
don't mind, to help out.

2356
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,428
MAN: I ain't doing anything
with the underwear.

2357
01:17:45,528 --> 01:17:46,395
MAN: Feet... tape on his feet.

2358
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,364
Could you get the
other tape off?

2359
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:50,366
MAN: I need, like, a knife.
[inaudible] cut his legs off.

2360
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:51,434
Oh-ho-ho.

2361
01:17:51,534 --> 01:17:53,336
Yeah, I'm about to
slide off this chair.

2362
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:54,337
[Laughs]

2363
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:55,304
[Inaudible]

2364
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:56,105
[Inaudible].

2365
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:02,746
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Eh,
Adam, is there any way

2366
01:18:02,846 --> 01:18:04,748
To get all these actors who
are gonna be in the... you know,

2367
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:05,715
They haven't even
picked up Lemmy.

2368
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:06,750
Lemmy's going to be done with...

2369
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:08,718
They left to pick
up Lemmy already.

2370
01:18:08,818 --> 01:18:10,686
LLOYD KAUFMAN: No,
because I told them to.

2371
01:18:10,787 --> 01:18:13,156
So we're gonna go pick
Lemmy up at 5 o'clock.

2372
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:15,658
This is the most
horrible, horrible

2373
01:18:15,759 --> 01:18:17,626
Group I've ever... horrible.

2374
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:18,627
Horrible.

2375
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:19,763
I'm trying to
rehearse this thing

2376
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:20,964
Or we're going to
be here all night.

2377
01:18:21,064 --> 01:18:22,098
I'm getting
absolutely... you know,

2378
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,632
I'm running around
doing everything.

2379
01:18:23,733 --> 01:18:24,433
All right?

2380
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,202
I'm sorry.

2381
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:30,874
The place is a
pigsty, so there's

2382
01:18:30,974 --> 01:18:34,677
All sorts of filth and
scum all over the carpets

2383
01:18:34,778 --> 01:18:36,045
With white stuff.

2384
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:39,015
So when you have a chance, get
your crew to clean that up,

2385
01:18:39,115 --> 01:18:40,283
Too, please.
MAN: All right.

2386
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,818
That I will say
"please," because I'd

2387
01:18:41,918 --> 01:18:42,952
Have to say it eight times.

2388
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:44,821
Is there that little
microphone [inaudible]?

2389
01:18:44,921 --> 01:18:45,721
Yes, I got the table.

2390
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:47,423
Yeah, get... see
what you guys can

2391
01:18:47,523 --> 01:18:50,093
Hustle to make it kind of look
like what the script says.

2392
01:18:50,193 --> 01:18:53,196
I know that the sitting around
up there is very important.

2393
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:54,831
I can't get any of the ADs.

2394
01:18:54,931 --> 01:18:56,699
I can't get the...
You know, I think

2395
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,003
I've got everybody assembled.
[inaudible] mapped it out.

2396
01:19:00,103 --> 01:19:01,170
But there's no props.

2397
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:02,305
There's the usual.

2398
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:05,008
And nobody's told the
Art department that they

2399
01:19:05,108 --> 01:19:09,245
Need microphones and cameras.

2400
01:19:09,345 --> 01:19:10,246
[Coughing]

2401
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:13,482
Lloyd, is it
closeup on his face?

2402
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:14,450
I guess.

2403
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:15,952
Or over her shoulder
or something.

2404
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:17,420
You know?

2405
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,822
I mean, would
you want me to see

2406
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:21,524
The candy bar or just his face?

2407
01:19:21,624 --> 01:19:22,959
Yeah, if you can.

2408
01:19:23,059 --> 01:19:25,862
It seems like most of it's...
Hey, Joe, keep talking about...

2409
01:19:25,962 --> 01:19:26,863
Just improvise stuff.

2410
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:28,898
Certain chocolate
with red meat and

2411
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:31,767
White... because white chocolate
I like with [inaudible].

2412
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:33,236
MAN: Action.

2413
01:19:33,336 --> 01:19:36,672
How would you like to be in
this film I'm investing in?

2414
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,541
Would you like a piece
of, uh, chocolate?

2415
01:19:38,641 --> 01:19:39,675
I didn't think so.

2416
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,811
I eat this stuff all the
time... white chocolate,

2417
01:19:41,911 --> 01:19:42,745
Dark chocolate.

2418
01:19:42,846 --> 01:19:44,914
All right.

2419
01:19:45,014 --> 01:19:46,015
It's good.

2420
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,984
I'm worried at this
rate we won't finish.

2421
01:19:48,084 --> 01:19:49,418
We're going so
incredibly slowly.

2422
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:50,353
Yeah.

2423
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:51,554
So how... maybe
if... I don't think

2424
01:19:51,654 --> 01:19:53,356
Brendan knows how much
there is to do after this.

2425
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:54,891
In other words,
there's all this stuff.

2426
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:56,792
And Joe has to then write up.

2427
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:58,962
We've got to do the
stunt [inaudible].

2428
01:19:59,062 --> 01:20:00,363
That stuff from
behind there where

2429
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:02,832
She's... I think he just thinks
there's, like, two shots.

2430
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:04,500
I don't think there's any
concept of the work that

2431
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,902
Has to be done.

2432
01:20:06,002 --> 01:20:07,570
There's also a question
of how much coverage

2433
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,172
We do on each little scene.

2434
01:20:09,272 --> 01:20:10,573
You know?

2435
01:20:10,673 --> 01:20:12,241
We don't need to do coverage.

2436
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,077
Well, we need a shot
of the dialogue.

2437
01:20:14,177 --> 01:20:15,044
That's what we've got to get.

2438
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:15,845
But it's...

2439
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:16,946
Don't we have that already?

2440
01:20:17,046 --> 01:20:17,746
No.

2441
01:20:17,847 --> 01:20:18,848
No, I don't.

2442
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:20,383
That's the problem.

2443
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:22,451
Would you like a
square of chocolate?

2444
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:23,419
I really love chocolate.

2445

It kept going and going.

2486

The escalator thing

this, we need...

some people taking photos,

the Lemmy, Lemmy,

Been picked up a long time ago.

2514

They did go.

Yeah, they went late, though.

Yeah.

in here to do...

be in the scene.

Madame, tell me,
how did you feel

2543

When you first saw
the mangled body

2544
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,601
Of this venal, fat bastard?

2545
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:27,036
I believe my first reaction was

[Screaming]

01:23:29,538 --> 01:23:31,674

introduce myself.

Nice to meet you.

So now we have this monologue
thing we're talking about.

2554
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:41,450
We are running a little behind
schedule today, so we're not...

2555
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:42,351
LEMMY: Imagine my surprise.

2556
01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:43,652
Yeah.

2557
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:45,321
So we're not positive we're
going to get to it today.

2558
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:47,290
So rather than keep you here
the rest of the afternoon

2559
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:48,357
And just have you sit around...

2560
01:23:48,457 --> 01:23:49,325
LEMMY: Then you'll
send me the fuck home.

2561

Yeah.

2562
01:23:50,559 --> 01:23:51,560
And then if you want, we
can call you if it looks

2563
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:52,895
Like we're going to get to it.

2564
01:23:52,995 --> 01:23:55,064
We could do it another
day, possibly by tomorrow.

2565
01:23:55,164 --> 01:23:55,864
Oh, we have tomorrow.

2566
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:56,699
Yeah.

2567
01:23:56,799 --> 01:23:58,033
We could even do it [inaudible].

2568
01:23:58,134 --> 01:23:58,834
Exactly.

2569
01:23:58,934 --> 01:24:00,069
That's a really good idea.

2570
01:24:00,169 --> 01:24:01,570
Yeah.

2571
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:02,671
So...

2572
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:04,273
Just somewhere with
fucking air conditioning

2573
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:05,208
This time, would you?

2574
01:24:05,308 --> 01:24:06,109
I know, really.

2575
01:24:06,209 --> 01:24:07,743

Low budget.

2580
01:24:13,949 --> 01:24:15,284
No air conditioning.

2581
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:17,386
Usual stuff.

2582
01:24:17,486 --> 01:24:18,587
PATRICK CASSIDY:
We can get in touch

2583
01:24:18,687 --> 01:24:20,022
If you want to be touched up.

2584
01:24:20,123 --> 01:24:22,158
MAN: I think he was
pissed off that he

2585
01:24:22,258 --> 01:24:27,130
Had to wait as long as he did
for being on set yesterday.

2586
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,332
And then he never
got his stuff shot.

2587
01:24:29,432 --> 01:24:30,633
Are you sure?
Come on?

2588
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:31,634
LEMMY: [inaudible].

2589
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,242
He won't do that [inaudible].

2590
01:24:39,342 --> 01:24:40,576
If it was anything
other than that.

2591
01:24:40,676 --> 01:24:42,311
I mean... but that
was... guarantee you

2592
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:44,547
That was the reason he
wasn't gonna come in.

2593
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:47,583
And then Dave Schultz said
nah, we'll find something else.

2594
01:24:47,683 --> 01:24:49,285
And then that day... he
just doesn't want to... you

2595
01:24:49,385 --> 01:24:50,219
Know, and I don't blame him.

2596
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:51,720
That's something
that... you know,

2597
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:55,023
For a band of his image, that's
not the smartest thing to do.

2598
01:24:55,124 --> 01:24:56,459
Let's come up with
something else for him.

2599
01:24:56,559 --> 01:24:58,861
All I can tell you is, whether
it was relayed to you or not,

2600
01:24:58,961 --> 01:25:00,429
You don't leave him
for eight hours.

2601
01:25:00,529 --> 01:25:01,430
Never.

2602
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:03,766
You lose him right
there in a moment.

2603
01:25:03,866 --> 01:25:06,569
I mean, you're talking about
a guy on speed and booze.

2604
01:25:06,669 --> 01:25:07,870
You know what I mean?

2605
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:09,805
And you know, you use him
and you get him in and out.

2606
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:11,174
That's how we do it.

2607
01:25:11,274 --> 01:25:12,875
We talked to Todd
and he said that Lemmy

2608
01:25:12,975 --> 01:25:14,009
Didn't want to do
the bit that we

2609
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,411
Wrote about the hermaphrodites.

2610
01:25:15,511 --> 01:25:17,780
I didn't know that the content
was such a problem till,

2611
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:18,814
Like, a half an hour ago.

2612

01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,092
You got stuff to do.

2618
01:25:30,193 --> 01:25:31,360
Yeah, you guys are
just pissing him off.

2619
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,329
Here's the only option
I have for you guys,

2620
01:25:33,429 --> 01:25:34,597
And it can't be done here.

2621
01:25:34,697 --> 01:25:36,031
Have him do... actually, he
said he wouldn't do that.

2622
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,333
He rewrote it.

2623
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:39,302
Have Dave shoot it [inaudible].

2624
01:25:39,402 --> 01:25:40,303
Think you can do that there?

2625
01:25:40,403 --> 01:25:41,304
A good scene?

2626
01:25:41,404 --> 01:25:42,305
MAN: It will never happen.

2627
01:25:45,408 --> 01:25:46,275
WOMAN: You're welcome.

2628
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,561
INTERVIEWER: How did you hook
up with the Troma people?

2629
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,368
LEMMY: Fair enough.

2630
01:26:45,468 --> 01:26:46,569
INTERVIEWER: Fair enough.

2631
01:26:46,669 --> 01:26:48,404
I feel like an idiot
about the Lemmy thing, too.

2632
01:26:48,504 --> 01:26:49,405
I was screaming and yelling.

2633
01:26:49,505 --> 01:26:51,507
And we have to
take care of Lemmy.

2634
01:26:51,607 --> 01:26:55,378
We have to do... baby
him and then we ended

2635
01:26:55,478 --> 01:26:57,280
Up wasting a shitload of money.

2636
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,080
Yeah.

2637
01:27:08,257 --> 01:27:12,395
The stuntmen all have
wives and children.

2638
01:27:12,495 --> 01:27:15,097
Doesn't make for good stunts.

2639
01:27:15,197 --> 01:27:16,632
Supposedly they came.

2640
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:18,334
They OKed it.

2641
01:27:18,434 --> 01:27:21,203
They agreed to have
their equipment here,

2642
01:27:21,304 --> 01:27:22,170
Which isn't here.

2643
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:24,573
Now they're saying
it's more money.

2644
01:27:24,673 --> 01:27:27,476
And they're saying we lied
about how high the jump was.

2645
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,678
There was lots of
screaming and yelling.

2646
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:32,047
LLOYD KAUFMAN: I don't
know what to say except

2647
01:27:32,147 --> 01:27:34,149
Find some white prick
that maybe we can

2648
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:35,651
At least fake the [inaudible].

2649
01:27:43,659 --> 01:27:45,428
This is a jump for women.

2650
01:27:45,528 --> 01:27:47,062
LLOYD KAUFMAN: If I'm
on the ground here,

2651
01:27:47,162 --> 01:27:48,531
[Inaudible] where I
don't see as much of it.

2652
01:27:48,631 --> 01:27:50,299
I don't really
see the buildings.

2653
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:53,302
I see the boxes, but I may
not get the entire floor.

2654
01:27:53,402 --> 01:27:54,503
MAN: I think that's
OK, because we

2655
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:56,405
[Inaudible] in the [inaudible].

2656
01:27:56,505 --> 01:27:58,407
So I'd go for that [inaudible].

2657
01:27:58,507 --> 01:27:59,808
Yeah, at least we
get some height.

2658
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:01,076
MAN: Yeah.
- [inaudible] through space.

2659
01:28:03,912 --> 01:28:06,515
MAN: A dead ringer
for our actor.

2660
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,083
Steven and Adam,
I think we ought

2661
01:28:08,183 --> 01:28:09,785
To try to get this thing off.

2662
01:28:09,885 --> 01:28:10,619
MAN: OK, here we go.

2663
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,154
Very quiet, please.

2664
01:28:12,254 --> 01:28:14,490
And action!

2665
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:17,292
Oh!

2666
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:18,293
It's a cut!

2667
01:28:18,394 --> 01:28:20,363
Everyone stay clear, please.

2668
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:21,296
MAN: Don't move.

2669
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:26,068
I'm here.

2670
01:28:29,505 --> 01:28:30,272
Let's stay clear, please.

2671
01:28:30,373 --> 01:28:31,974
Everyone hold their positions.

2672
01:28:32,074 --> 01:28:33,842
MAN: This is a very tense
moment for everybody.

2673
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:34,810
What's up?

2674
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:38,313
[Applause and cheers]

2675
01:28:41,417 --> 01:28:42,518
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Yeah.

2676
01:28:42,618 --> 01:28:43,318
Yeah.

2677
01:28:43,419 --> 01:28:44,119
Lenny?

2678
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:46,789
Yes?

2679
01:28:46,889 --> 01:28:49,792
Just drink a little water.

2680
01:28:49,892 --> 01:28:51,293
[Inaudible], you think?

2681
01:28:51,394 --> 01:28:52,361
No, it's fine.

2682
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:53,562
MAN: I knew it was
gonna be a hard fall.

2683
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:54,663
And I was...
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It was great.

2684
01:28:54,763 --> 01:28:55,764
Oh, thank you.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It was great.

2685
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:57,032
I was right under there.
It was great.

2686
01:28:57,132 --> 01:28:58,367
I tried to screech my feet
like I was fighting the...

2687
01:28:58,467 --> 01:28:59,468
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It was terrific.
Yeah, you did a great job.

2688
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:00,803
Sensational.
This was the best.

2689
01:29:00,903 --> 01:29:01,637
It was the best.

2690
01:29:01,737 --> 01:29:02,538
You have shit.

2691
01:29:02,638 --> 01:29:03,606
I mean, it's boring stuff.

2692
01:29:03,706 --> 01:29:04,707
MAN: We'll work with it.

2693
01:29:04,807 --> 01:29:06,074
You know, we can work with it.

2694
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,109
It would have been better to
get somebody cheaper and better.

2695
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:08,477
Yeah.
But...

2696
01:29:08,577 --> 01:29:10,345
No, we should have just... well,
we should have just ordered

2697
01:29:10,446 --> 01:29:11,814
The... we should have
just done the stunt,

2698
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:13,982
Just hired a guy
to do a high fall

2699
01:29:14,082 --> 01:29:16,151
And paid him whatever it is.

2700
01:29:16,251 --> 01:29:16,952
MAN: Right.

2701
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:17,920
This was garbage.

2702
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:18,854
MAN: Yeah.

2703
01:29:18,954 --> 01:29:19,955
There was no bone
with these guys.

2704
01:29:20,055 --> 01:29:20,956
Everything was no good.

2705
01:29:21,056 --> 01:29:22,024
Everything was bad.

2706
01:29:22,124 --> 01:29:24,927
Steven wanted to fire
him at the armory.

2707
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:27,129
But I didn't want
to... I just didn't

2708
01:29:27,229 --> 01:29:28,296
Want to get into a fight.

2709
01:29:28,397 --> 01:29:29,732
That's after everything.

2710
01:29:29,832 --> 01:29:31,667
Steven did fire him, I think.

2711
01:29:31,767 --> 01:29:33,268
But I just didn't want
to get [inaudible].

2712
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:34,102
Here's your final check.

2713
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,370
You're fired.

2714
01:29:35,471 --> 01:29:38,106
It's not quite the... it's
not quite the same effect.

2715
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,815
We need stuff that
looks more street level.

2716
01:29:46,915 --> 01:29:49,384
I'm worried this is
going to read roof.

2717
01:29:49,485 --> 01:29:51,587
Garbage bags.

2718
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:52,688
What do we have here?

2719
01:29:52,788 --> 01:29:54,056
This sort of looks like
street-level stuff.

2720
01:29:56,759 --> 01:29:58,026
This [inaudible].

2721
01:29:58,126 --> 01:29:59,695
MAN: We used this in
the pregnant killing.

2722
01:29:59,795 --> 01:30:01,196
Yeah, but it's all
part of a movie,

2723
01:30:01,296 --> 01:30:02,064
So it'll throw people off.

2724
01:30:02,164 --> 01:30:03,799
Yeah, that's cool.

2725
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:04,933
Let's put the flat here then.

2726
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:07,035
Let's build up here, so
at least you can... yeah.

2727
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:09,304
Maybe if you wanna fall on
this thing, go right ahead.

2728
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:10,338
OK.

2729
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:11,940
[Inaudible] in front
of the door there.

2730
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,241
That's the thing,
that the garbage here

2731
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:14,076
Would have to be
away, because then

2732
01:30:14,176 --> 01:30:14,877
You don't want to [inaudible].

2733
01:30:14,977 --> 01:30:15,678
Do whatever you want.

2734
01:30:15,778 --> 01:30:17,646
Slate in, roll sound.

2735
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,081
MAN: Speed.

2736
01:30:19,181 --> 01:30:21,750
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Watch yourself.

2737
01:30:21,850 --> 01:30:22,651
MAN: Second hand.

2738
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:23,886
Ready?
Rolling?

2739
01:30:23,986 --> 01:30:24,687
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Action!

2740
01:30:30,726 --> 01:30:31,627
Cut, cut!

2741
01:30:31,727 --> 01:30:32,427
MAN: Wrap.

2742
01:30:32,528 --> 01:30:34,663
Cut!

2743
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,198
Get the first aid kit, please.

2744
01:30:36,298 --> 01:30:38,834
I think you can come
out of that mask, right?

2745
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:42,270
You wanna just grab Yaniv
running down Ninth Avenue?

2746
01:30:47,142 --> 01:30:48,744
MAN: To crush on his head.

2747
01:30:48,844 --> 01:30:50,879
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
Now we need Yaniv.

2748
01:30:50,979 --> 01:30:54,016
We need him running
and falling down.

2749
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:56,051
You better look at a Polaroid.

2750
01:30:56,151 --> 01:30:56,885
Yeah, it's not...

2751
01:30:56,985 --> 01:30:59,822
They don't have enough gauze.

2752
01:30:59,922 --> 01:31:01,189
They don't have any gauze.

2753
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:02,891
I asked two hours
ago about the gauze.

2754
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:04,326
So now you're down.

2755
01:31:04,426 --> 01:31:07,763
Now your stuff is fucked, right?

2756
01:31:07,863 --> 01:31:09,532
It's the stupidest
bunch of people I've

2757
01:31:09,632 --> 01:31:10,866
Ever worked with in my life.

2758
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,234
I hope it's on video.

2759
01:31:12,334 --> 01:31:13,702
I mean, I just don't believe it.

2760
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:15,103
I even said it,
too, before lunch.

2761
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:16,572
I said it to about eight people.

2762
01:31:16,672 --> 01:31:17,773
Now, look, you're the producer.

2763
01:31:17,873 --> 01:31:19,007
Go and solve it, Steven.

2764
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:20,876
Please.

2765
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:23,045
This is where it's
bad news, right?

2766
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:25,781
This is why I don't want
anyone working past Friday.

2767
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:27,783
I'll do it myself,
whatever it is.

2768
01:31:27,883 --> 01:31:31,787
All I know is it's a very
dumb bunch of people.

2769
01:31:31,887 --> 01:31:32,755
That's all I know.

2770
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:34,456
Lazy and dumb.

2771
01:31:34,557 --> 01:31:36,925
And I hate everybody.

2772
01:31:37,025 --> 01:31:41,363
I definitely hate Adam, and I
hate Steven, and I hate Yurgi.

2773
01:31:41,463 --> 01:31:42,364
I hate you.

2774
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,165
I understand.

2775
01:31:43,265 --> 01:31:44,366
[Laughs]

2776
01:31:44,466 --> 01:31:45,267
MAN: Eventually I'll wash.

2777
01:31:45,367 --> 01:31:46,068
I hate this man.

2778
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:47,335
That scent'll go away.

2779
01:31:47,435 --> 01:31:48,604
But there is love.

2780
01:31:48,704 --> 01:31:49,404
No.

2781
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:50,205
Definitely not.

2782
01:31:50,305 --> 01:31:51,173
I love Yaniv.

2783
01:31:51,273 --> 01:31:52,107
I love you very much.

2784
01:31:52,207 --> 01:31:52,908
YANIV: Oh.

2785
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:53,876
You want a hug?

2786
01:32:00,248 --> 01:32:02,885
Are you guys gonna have
enough to cover his mouth?

2787
01:32:02,985 --> 01:32:04,286
- I'm doing the best I can.
- OK.

2788
01:32:04,386 --> 01:32:05,353
Is that OK?

2789
01:32:05,453 --> 01:32:07,122
Well, what if you
put toilet paper, uh...

2790
01:32:07,222 --> 01:32:08,624
We don't have any,
'cause there's no toilet.

2791
01:32:08,724 --> 01:32:10,125
- Oh.
- Here's some big [inaudible].

2792
01:32:10,225 --> 01:32:11,594
Those napkins maybe
over his mouth.

2793
01:32:14,697 --> 01:32:17,165
We've lost the cock sock.

2794
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:19,802
Serious problem.

2795
01:32:19,902 --> 01:32:22,838
Somewhere around here is
lurking a piece of pantyhose

2796
01:32:22,938 --> 01:32:25,140
That once was on Yaniv's dick.

2797
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:27,475
Somebody finds that,
they're in serious trouble.

2798
01:32:27,576 --> 01:32:29,912
YANIV: I know the
second I do the shot,

2799
01:32:30,012 --> 01:32:33,281
What the fuck [inaudible].

2800
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:34,549
I know.

2801
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:36,051
YANIV: And then the cop won't
know, because I told him

2802
01:32:36,151 --> 01:32:36,852
I have...

2803
01:32:36,952 --> 01:32:38,120
Adam and Steven.

2804
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,555
Adam and Steven,
sorry to interrupt.

2805
01:32:40,656 --> 01:32:42,224
We ought to make sure
there's no confusion

2806
01:32:42,324 --> 01:32:45,393
About what's on this guy's
pee-pee and all that.

2807
01:32:45,493 --> 01:32:48,764
So look at what's on there,
and then tell the policeman.

2808
01:32:48,864 --> 01:32:51,199
Make sure that whatever
he's wearing or not wearing,

2809
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:53,435
We're in sync with
the officer, please.

2810
01:32:53,535 --> 01:32:56,304
The thing on my dick
looks ridiculous.

2811
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,406
Why don't I take it off
now, but he won't know?

2812
01:32:58,506 --> 01:32:59,842
He's not looking.
MAN: OK, here we go.

2813
01:32:59,942 --> 01:33:00,909
Ready to go.
LLOYD KAUFMAN: All right.

2814
01:33:01,009 --> 01:33:02,144
All right.
Just go over to your position.

2815
01:33:02,244 --> 01:33:03,478
You find [inaudible]
down there?

2816
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:06,448
Yes.

2817
01:33:06,548 --> 01:33:07,716
You want the towel?

2818
01:33:07,816 --> 01:33:09,317
MAN: You should just have
it covering the top of you

2819
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:10,619
For now, all right?

2820
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:15,257
MAN: No, can you tuck your
face more up into the tire?

2821
01:33:15,357 --> 01:33:18,193
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
that's gonna be great.

2822
01:33:18,293 --> 01:33:23,065
Can we... can we just
load him up with blood?

2823
01:33:23,165 --> 01:33:26,001
Just put a lot of blood
on his arms and legs.

2824
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:28,036
And on his upper torso.

2825
01:33:28,136 --> 01:33:29,938
Do you have any
cranberry sauce or any

2826
01:33:30,038 --> 01:33:32,240
Of that other
gizzards or something

2827
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:35,477
That can be laid gently on top?

2828
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:36,879
YANIV: This arm
isn't really bloody.

2829
01:33:36,979 --> 01:33:39,314
You probably need
to bloody it more.

2830
01:33:39,414 --> 01:33:41,750
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Do your
electrocution, Yaniv.

2831
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:44,219
Smack your head... smack your
hands a bit on the ground,

2832
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:46,989
Because that'll make the
blood splatter a little bit.

2833
01:33:47,089 --> 01:33:48,957
All right, standing by.

2834
01:33:49,057 --> 01:33:51,226
OK, roll Camera A.

2835
01:33:51,326 --> 01:33:52,094
[Beep]

2836
01:33:52,194 --> 01:33:53,061
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Rolling.

2837
01:33:53,161 --> 01:33:54,329
MAN: Roll Camera B.
MAN: Rolling.

2838
01:33:54,429 --> 01:33:55,130
MAN: Rolling.

2839
01:33:55,230 --> 01:33:56,865
MAN: Ready and action!

2840
01:33:56,965 --> 01:33:59,768
[Flopping]

2841
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:04,072
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Kick
your legs more, Yaniv!

2842
01:34:04,172 --> 01:34:05,674
Wiggle 'em more.
Wiggle 'em.

2843
01:34:05,774 --> 01:34:07,142
Your hands, your legs.
MAN: [inaudible].

2844
01:34:07,242 --> 01:34:08,343
LLOYD KAUFMAN: That's it.
Do more of the electrocution.

2845
01:34:08,443 --> 01:34:09,411
Don't slap so much.

2846
01:34:09,511 --> 01:34:10,212
Up!

2847
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:11,079
Up with your hands.

2848
01:34:11,179 --> 01:34:12,480
Up, up, up!

2849
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:13,882
MAN: Your legs up, too.

2850
01:34:13,982 --> 01:34:15,383
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Yeah,
yeah, your legs up.

2851
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,551
Up with your legs.
MAN: Yeah.

2852
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:17,352
MAN: There you go.

2853
01:34:17,452 --> 01:34:18,453
MAN: Oh, that's it.
Up!

2854
01:34:18,553 --> 01:34:19,855
LLOYD KAUFMAN: More of that.
More of that!

2855
01:34:19,955 --> 01:34:21,356
That's it!
That's it.

2856
01:34:21,456 --> 01:34:22,825
Die!

2857
01:34:22,925 --> 01:34:25,327
Dead, dead.

2858
01:34:25,427 --> 01:34:27,830
[Applause and cheers]

2859
01:34:27,930 --> 01:34:29,064
Heh.

2860
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:31,233
It doesn't look like there's
any penis there, though.

2861
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:32,600
The only trouble is
it looked just like...

2862
01:34:32,701 --> 01:34:33,435
It didn't... all I could...

2863
01:34:33,535 --> 01:34:34,703
MAN: NC-17.

2864
01:34:34,803 --> 01:34:35,503
MAN: Oh-ho-ho.

2865
01:34:35,603 --> 01:34:36,304
Oh.

2866
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,243
[Breathing heavily]

2867
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:42,310
INTERVIEWER: Is it cold, Yaniv?

2868
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:45,948
Yeah, it's fuckin' cold.

2869
01:34:46,048 --> 01:34:47,950
[Shivers]

2870
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:02,397
WOMAN: Cute.

2871
01:35:05,968 --> 01:35:07,870
[Laughter]

2872
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:08,871
MAN: Take a left!

2873
01:35:08,971 --> 01:35:10,338
A left!

2874
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:12,841
Oh!

2875
01:35:12,941 --> 01:35:15,844
Yeah!

2876
01:35:15,944 --> 01:35:19,314
[Applause]

2877
01:35:19,414 --> 01:35:22,317
[Cheers]

2878
01:35:24,887 --> 01:35:26,288
Thank you.

2879
01:35:26,388 --> 01:35:27,790
That was a very beautiful shot.

2880
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:28,791
That was excellent.

2881
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:29,758
Great.

2882
01:35:29,858 --> 01:35:32,260
I just wanted you
to [inaudible].

2883
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,762
I said, no, I can't.

2884
01:35:33,862 --> 01:35:35,463
I was like, yeah, New York!

2885
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:36,698
Yeah, I know.

2886
01:35:36,799 --> 01:35:39,001
If we do the thing in
post-production where we go

2887
01:35:39,101 --> 01:35:41,469
To San Gennaro Festival
and we do stuff

2888
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:42,704
During Christmas at Macy's.

2889
01:35:42,805 --> 01:35:46,274
And then maybe you do a
cartwheel or something if we

2890
01:35:46,374 --> 01:35:48,343
Get our nerve up to do that.

2891
01:35:48,443 --> 01:35:49,577
MAN: OK, guys.
Let's wrap up.

2892
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:50,378
Picture wrap.

2893
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:51,413
Let's go home.

2894
01:35:51,513 --> 01:35:52,214
MAN: Yeah.

2895
01:35:52,314 --> 01:35:53,048
MAN: All right, guys.

2896
01:35:53,148 --> 01:35:54,682
That is a wrap for this movie!

2897
01:35:54,783 --> 01:35:57,652
[Cheers and applause]

2898
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:58,620
[Pop]

2899
01:35:59,721 --> 01:36:03,058
[Music playing]

2900
01:36:12,067 --> 01:36:14,102
MAN: Last time I
heard, it was sold out,

2901
01:36:14,202 --> 01:36:16,438
So I think we're
doin' all right today.

2902
01:36:16,538 --> 01:36:18,974
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Um, again,
there are many people who have

2903
01:36:19,074 --> 01:36:20,876
Made "Terror Firmer" possible.

2904
01:36:20,976 --> 01:36:23,111
And I cannot possibly
thank them all.

2905
01:36:23,211 --> 01:36:25,313
But for Michael
Hers and for me, we

2906
01:36:25,413 --> 01:36:27,883
Are very grateful
to the entire team

2907
01:36:27,983 --> 01:36:29,251
That made this film possible.

2908
01:36:29,351 --> 01:36:33,155
The theme of this film is to
call attention to the fact

2909
01:36:33,255 --> 01:36:36,258
That the independent
spirit, independent art,

2910
01:36:36,358 --> 01:36:39,594
Independent effort, independent,
entrepreneurial, independent

2911
01:36:39,694 --> 01:36:42,797
Politics are all under assault
as they never have been.

2912
01:36:42,898 --> 01:36:46,234
The fact that so many of
you are here in this cinema

2913
01:36:46,334 --> 01:36:49,104
Is evidence of the fact that,
indeed, the independent spirit

2914
01:36:49,204 --> 01:36:51,306
Lives, and a taste
to be challenged

2915
01:36:51,406 --> 01:36:55,377
And the desire to be challenged
by art in a cinema still lives.

2916
01:36:55,477 --> 01:36:56,879
So now let's make some art.

2917
01:36:56,979 --> 01:36:57,880
Thank you.

2918
01:36:57,980 --> 01:37:00,548
[Cheers and applause]

2919
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:01,349
Woo!

2920
01:38:07,415 --> 01:38:08,583
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Let's
get through this.

2921
01:38:08,683 --> 01:38:10,218
We're never gonna finish
the goddamn scene!

2922
01:38:10,318 --> 01:38:11,286
MAN: OK, right now...
- Horse shit.

2923
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:12,587
You're spending two
hours on a scene

2924
01:38:12,687 --> 01:38:13,621
That should take a minute.

2925
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:14,456
MAN: I'll just go
over here and...

2926
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:15,457
Get all them in. [Inaudible].

2927
01:38:15,557 --> 01:38:16,959
You don't need
anything now but Moose.

2928
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:18,493
Just get all... everyone
here, everybody.

2929
01:38:18,593 --> 01:38:19,294
Everyone.

2930
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:20,362
OK.

2931
01:38:20,462 --> 01:38:21,529
Can we have all actors
over here, please?

2932
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:22,630
Here we go.

2933
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:23,798
LLOYD KAUFMAN: It's
really dangerous the way

2934
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:25,200
You're running this set.
OK, folks.

2935
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:26,168
From now on, [inaudible].

2936
01:38:26,268 --> 01:38:27,002
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
What I'm suggesting

2937
01:38:27,102 --> 01:38:27,936
Is you gotta keep looking at it.

2938
01:38:28,036 --> 01:38:29,271
MAN: I... I have
no tab, video tab.

2939
01:38:29,371 --> 01:38:30,505
I can't tell.

2940
01:38:30,605 --> 01:38:32,040
LLOYD KAUFMAN: Well, it
isn't a matter of video tab.

2941
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,775
That's like that
movie magic shit.

2942
01:38:33,875 --> 01:38:35,110
It's the same thing.

2943
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:36,178
MAN: Well, if I had a chance
to look through the cards...

2944
01:38:36,278 --> 01:38:37,279
No, it's a matter of
just being careful,

2945
01:38:37,379 --> 01:38:38,813
Letting... keeping people
away from the edges.

2946
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,682
MAN: OK.

2947
01:38:40,782 --> 01:38:43,151
I guess... so
nobody called any...

2948
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:44,519
We didn't call people or...

2949
01:38:44,619 --> 01:38:46,321
MAN: Yeah, we did call
people, but a lot of people

2950
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,256
Told us they're [inaudible].

2951
01:38:48,356 --> 01:38:49,324
Ah.

2952
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:51,193
So that means when
we get to New Jersey,

2953
01:38:51,293 --> 01:38:54,162
We'll have actually
nobody on set?

2954
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:56,598
They did their bags, right?

2955
01:38:56,698 --> 01:38:58,566
You better get your guys right.

2956
01:38:58,666 --> 01:38:59,667
MAN: Yup.

2957
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:01,903
At least have the guts
to call us at night

2958
01:39:02,004 --> 01:39:03,805
And say you're not
gonna have anybody.

2959
01:39:03,905 --> 01:39:06,174
[Inaudible] look up
that area over there.

2960
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:07,575
[Inaudible] have people.

2961
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:10,178
It's gonna fuck up... there's
already stuff in the dailies

2962
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:12,014
Where you have people
standing around

2963
01:39:12,114 --> 01:39:13,781
In the background
kind of like just

2964
01:39:13,881 --> 01:39:15,050
Standing there having coffee.

2965
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:15,850
Well, it...

2966
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,830
You shoulda paid me, man.

2967
01:39:28,930 --> 01:39:29,797
I'm tellin' you.

2968
01:39:29,897 --> 01:39:32,267
You shoulda fuckin' paid me.

2969
01:39:32,367 --> 01:39:35,203
All I wanted is a little money
to get through the summer.

2970
01:39:35,303 --> 01:39:37,605
But instead, all you do is yell.

2971
01:39:37,705 --> 01:39:39,707
Yell, yell, yell, yell.

2972
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:43,311
I can't fuckin' take it anymore.

2973
01:39:43,411 --> 01:39:44,112
What the fuck you doin' here?
