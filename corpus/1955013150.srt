1
00:00:01,769 --> 00:00:04,004
(Bagpipes play)

2
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,667
(Dramatic, fast-paced music)

3
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:38,772
(Door slams)

4
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,350
(Breathes heavily)

5
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,156
(Footsteps approach)

6
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:01,762
What's wrong with you, girl?

7
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,498
I just came to say goodnight.

8
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,834
No, you didn't.

9
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:09,337
Well.

10
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,339
Well, well, well.

11
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,374
You know.

12
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,077
Don't you?

13
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,548
You know.

14
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,351
Your fucking bitch of mother,

15
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,386
Must've passed out drunk.

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,822
Every time I come over.

17
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:30,758
Well...

18
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,594
It's gotta go somewhere.

19
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:36,430
It's man's nature.

20
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:41,435
Man cannot change

21
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:43,204
His nature.

22
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,173
[Vine] You sure about that?

23
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,509
Fuck off.

24
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,144
Ain't no junkies that
deal through here.

25
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:56,784
What you want, Vine?

26
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,820
Status quo.

27
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,823
No dead little girls
in the basement,

28
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:05,393
No building crawling with cops.

29
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,797
Dead girl, what the
fuck you talking about?

30
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:11,365
Well I figure
when she stabs you

31
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,900
With that large nail
she has in her hand,

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,802
You'll do one of two things:

33
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,838
You'll either beat her so
bad she needs an ambulance,

34
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,273
Or kill her.

35
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,809
Either way it's just not
good for business, so...

36
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,377
You know.

37
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,479
You'll have to kill
her somewhere else.

38
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:41,429
You tripping, man.

39
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,431
Girl ran off.

40
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,300
I just came to get her.
That's it.

41
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,183
Andre.

42
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:06,920
Patron Saint of lost children.

43
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:21,735
(Quiet dramatic music
building in volume)

44
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:35,616
(Sirens wail in distance)
(men shout on street)

45
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:39,487
(Gunshots)
(woman screams)

46
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,764
(Alarm wails)

47
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,901
[Cornelia] There
are signs everywhere.

48
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:58,772
A floating leaf,
a sound, a shadow.

49
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:04,011
It's not the sign, but the
meaning that concerns us.

50
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,014
[Wayne] Hold up, ho.

51
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,716
Talk to Big Wayne.

52
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:18,726
Do you understand these
are signs of deception?

53
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,861
[Maria] He's lying to me?

54
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,531
[Cornelia] No, dear,
he's cheating on you.

55
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,898
(Maria sighs)

56
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,567
Infidelity is also a sign

57
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,936
We must seek further meaning.

58
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,605
He don't love me.

59
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,006
That's the meaning.

60
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,008
That's why he go
with that whore!

61
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,746
(Speaks foreign language)
(sobs)

62
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:48,389
(Spooky, spiritual whooshing)

63
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,061
Madam Cornelia?

64
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,300
What should I do?

65
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,738
Well, let's see what
the cards tell us, next.

66
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:10,611
(Glass cracks)
(dramatic music)

67
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,583
These old cards,
they rip so easily.

68
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,650
Cristo.

69
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,419
[Cornelia] What did you say?

70
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,454
Esta negro.

71
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,690
It changed to black glass.

72
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,459
And you can see that?

73
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,597
[Maria] I don't
understand, Madam Cornelia.

74
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,635
You will, Maria, briefly.

75
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,871
I'm sorry.

76
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,008
(Dramatic music)

77
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:47,114
(Maria gasps for breath)

78
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,461
(Knocks on door)

79
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:05,365
Dooley.

80
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,079
(Cell phone key pad clicks)

81
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:57,050
(Demonic whispers)

82
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,418
[Voiceover] The obsidian sun.

83
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,087
The new Interpreter arrives.

84
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,922
[Voiceover] Who is that?

85
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,156
[Voiceover] She
is not in the UK,

86
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,992
If in fact she is a she.

87
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,760
Right, who's got it?

88
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,629
[Cornelila] Here. It is here.

89
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,931
But the card is not blue.

90
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,065
[Voiceover] Not blue...

91
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,567
What do you mean, it's not blue?

92
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,135
It's always blue.

93
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,837
The most incomparable blue.

94
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,606
The most azure blue.

95
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,908
[Cornelia] It's not blue.

96
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:25,178
(Disembodied voices
speaks foreign languages)

97
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,680
[Voiceover] What is happening?

98
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,081
- [Voiceover] You can see...
- [Voiceover] I see.

99
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,750
[Voiceover] Why
was this not foreseen?

100
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,684
What is the meaning?

101
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:31,819
[Cornelia] Relinquere.

102
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,922
(Voices fade)

103
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,093
What comes?

104
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:45,499
(Footsteps approach)

105
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:50,871
Interpreter.

106
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,218
Ah, now you're sure
she saw the card

107
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,721
Before you pierced her?

108
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,159
It's a small thing to kill
somebody over, you know?

109
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,495
None of us happens, Adam.

110
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,531
Ever.

111
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,199
Obsidian is a sign
that a new Interpreter

112
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,568
Has come to the world.

113
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:22,770
But it is always blue.

114
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,805
Humans do not see into our world

115
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,239
Without being touched.

116
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,175
Yeah, well...

117
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:31,845
You touched her.

118
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,549
I can help you with the body.

119
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,686
Not really sure
what else I can do.

120
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,188
Keep your eyes open.

121
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,891
Something has come
into our plane.

122
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,526
If it is not Fortune
seeking a new Interpreter,

123
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,228
It may be something else.

124
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,800
Look for anything unusual.

125
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,104
(Vine sighs)

126
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,872
"Unusual."

127
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:00,608
[Lisa] Come on!

128
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,575
[Frank] Lisa...

129
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,196
Hit me again, Frank.

130
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,197
I'm telling you,

131
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,735
Fucking put it down.

132
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,804
(Pan thwacks)
(Frank grunts)

133
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,005
(Body falls)

134
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,281
[Voiceover] Good
evening, America.

135
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,883
Welcome to the show.

136
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:47,254
(Voice drowned out
by tense music)

137
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,001
(Audience laughs on television)

138
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,607
(Audience applauds
on television)

139
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,113
(Water drips)

140
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,025
Vine.

141
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,327
What the fuck you doing?

142
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,163
Eavesdropping.

143
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,100
You got my money?

144
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,937
Tripp and Helo just
went to the bank.

145
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,006
Yeah, you don't have a bank.

146
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,107
Sure we do.

147
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,875
Snatch and Grab Trust.

148
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,711
(Laughs)
See?

149
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:44,411
Here they come.

150
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,913
Have a little faith, Vine.

151
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,348
[Tripp] Hi, Vine.

152
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,282
Tripp.

153
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:52,920
Madam.

154
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,758
Fuck you, you
fucking procurer.

155
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,292
Do your job and bring
us something to eat.

156
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,127
Helo!

157
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,094
I speak for us.

158
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:01,929
I do.

159
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,331
He's hungry.

160
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,767
Yeah, well they
were beating the shit

161
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,769
Out of each other next
door a minute ago.

162
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,704
Have 'em take a
snort of that, huh?

163
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,439
You know how it is, Vine.

164
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,975
Same thing day in, day
out, it gets tedious.

165
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:20,013
But that's why we like
your product so much.

166
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,449
Variety is the spice of life.

167
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,218
So they say.

168
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,355
Pay me tomorrow, no later.

169
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:39,032
You let him get
away with too much.

170
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,103
You don't tear off the
hand that feeds you, Helo.

171
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,906
The minute he stops feeding us,

172
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,275
I'll rip his heart out.

173
00:11:58,819 --> 00:11:59,787
[Man on street] Fuck you!

174
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,088
Come here, bitch.

175
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,322
I said come here, motherfucker!

176
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,125
(Siren wails in distance)

177
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,559
[Vine] "Unusual."

178
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:14,935
(Dramatic music)

179
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,058
Got any ice?

180
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,780
(Man yells)

181
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,784
I'll kill myself!

182
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,519
I swear to Christ.

183
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,956
Please!
(glass shatters)

184
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,564
(Flesh squishes)

185
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:25,038
(Dramatic music intensifies)

186
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:45,125
(Music plays from
within apartment)

187
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,428
Oh, my God.

188
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,430
Beautiful.

189
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,501
You're fricking beautiful.

190
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,236
(Amber moans)
(man grunts)

191
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:06,880
(Dramatic music)

192
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,522
Oh, shit.

193
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,026
I didn't realize
how strong this was.

194
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,963
Hey, uh, what happened?

195
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,397
[Amber] I'm done.

196
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,398
We'll just call
this one a freebie.

197
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,435
I just started my period.

198
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,103
Oh, shit, really?

199
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:44,117
(Electronic tones)

200
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,523
(Electronic tones)

201
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:56,930
(Creature screams)

202
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,608
(Voice drones on
television in background)

203
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,611
(Sara breathes quietly)

204
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,444
That's unusual.

205
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,328
[Sara] Hello?

206
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,033
What are you doing down here?

207
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,634
I'm running away.

208
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:43,570
Ah.

209
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,306
I hate to break it to you, kid,

210
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,376
But the basement
ain't exactly "away."

211
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,678
I came to get Penny.

212
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,246
I dropped her, before.

213
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:55,515
Look, kid.

214
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:58,218
I wouldn't run away.

215
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,420
There's bad things out there.

216
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,089
There's bad things here.

217
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,291
Oh, yeah?

218
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,194
Should I take that personally?

219
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,562
You deal drugs.

220
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,698
And you scare people.

221
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,700
You have a gun.

222
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,568
Yeah.

223
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:16,403
And you don't care about

224
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,570
Somebody who needs help.

225
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,707
You're worse than Andre.

226
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,577
Hm, pretty tough, huh?

227
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,646
No fear.

228
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,450
(Dramatic music)
I can make you afraid.

229
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,590
Just trying to prove a point.

230
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,426
Relax.

231
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,163
I saved your ass, before.

232
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,565
You should be thanking me.

233
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,135
You told him to kill me.

234
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,673
Yeah, well, he didn't, did he?

235
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,209
He will.

236
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,611
I can't stop him.

237
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,248
But you could.

238
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:03,383
You have a gun.

239
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:06,786
No thanks.

240
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:08,755
Why not?

241
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,191
Why won't you help me?

242
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,294
Status quo, kid.

243
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,096
What's that?

244
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,732
Hunger.

245
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,102
Everybody's hungry
for something.

246
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,472
You know, they can't control it,

247
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:26,639
And they can't ignore it.

248
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:28,175
Sometimes you're the mouth

249
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,542
And sometimes you're the meal.

250
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,246
It's just the way it is.

251
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:39,519
Sara!

252
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,491
What the hell's this, huh?

253
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:45,725
Nothing, lady.

254
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,528
I was just looking for Dooley.

255
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,798
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

256
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,132
Where you going?

257
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,567
This place ain't
good enough for you?

258
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,902
Is that it, baby? Huh?

259
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,904
You gonna go out and
find a little house,

260
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,273
With a Mommy and Daddy,

261
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,741
And a little puppy?

262
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,910
Hm?
(hand slaps)

263
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,847
Didn't happen for me, it's
not happening for you.

264
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:08,781
Pick it up!

265
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:11,651
Come on, let's go.

266
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,320
[Sara] Let me go! I hate you!

267
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,587
I hate you!

268
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,456
Kids, right?

269
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,525
They're the worst.

270
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,260
Go!

271
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,433
God damn humans.

272
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,339
(Door bangs)

273
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,348
Dooley.

274
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,598
(Wings flap)

275
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:02,735
(Suspenseful music)

276
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,836
(Door bangs)

277
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,359
(Sara screams)

278
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,765
(Doorknob rattles)

279
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,271
(Sara cries)

280
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:46,245
No use fighting this, girl.

281
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,791
(Fast-paced, dramatic music)

282
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:17,677
(Vine grunts and
breathes heavily)

283
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,578
(Sara laughs)

284
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,683
You got your books,
got your homework.

285
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,451
You got your lunch money.

286
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,387
Good. Good girl.

287
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:01,721
So what other things you got?

288
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:03,523
Only things you really need.

289
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,627
What's in here,
and what's in here.

290
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,462
Now give me some.

291
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:12,999
(Both laugh)

292
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,401
See you when you get home.

293
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,572
(Wayne laughs)
Hey.

294
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:20,873
Hey, Andre.

295
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:22,609
Looking sharp.

296
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:23,843
[Andre] Oh, Wayne,
good to see you.

297
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:24,977
Looking for work today,

298
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,446
Thought I'd dress up a little.

299
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,014
Good luck, man.

300
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:29,449
I'll let you know if
I hear of anything.

301
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:30,617
Hey, thank you, man.

302
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:33,886
Much appreciate it.

303
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,023
Good morning, Mister Vine.

304
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,459
Sorry about last night,

305
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,494
I was uh, sick.

306
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:43,730
But I'm better now.

307
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,399
Hopefully you can forgive me.

308
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:50,403
Um...

309
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:53,039
Sure.

310
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:54,807
Thank you.

311
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,476
I gotta get going.

312
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,111
Have a good day, Mister Vine.

313
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:15,394
Goodbye.

314
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,664
(Lisa yells)

315
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,672
(Lisa murmurs and laughs)

316
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:29,141
Sorry.

317
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,644
Oh, shit, dude!

318
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,780
(Laughs)
I'm sorry.

319
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,752
You don't smell sorry.

320
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,023
Yeah, um...

321
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,025
Okay.
(both laugh)

322
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:47,560
I'm Frank.

323
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,128
Vine.

324
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:50,630
Vine.

325
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,198
Cool name, dude.

326
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,534
This is Lisa.
[Lisa] Hey.

327
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,569
[Lisa] You live in 37, right?

328
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:58,004
What happened?

329
00:23:58,538 --> 00:23:59,539
Oh, uh...

330
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,108
I hit myself with a bottle.

331
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,109
I...

332
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,978
I was massively inebriated and,

333
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,482
I think I just wanted
her to open the door.

334
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,450
I locked myself
in the bedroom.

335
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,820
I was messed up.

336
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:15,454
Like...

337
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,859
Bad, but it wasn't the booze.

338
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,663
I wasn't well.

339
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,732
But you're better, now.

340
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:26,799
Yes.

341
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,601
(Lisa laughs)
Yes I am.

342
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:29,869
We both are.

343
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:33,940
You just woke up and
everything was better?

344
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,008
I can't explain it, I...

345
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,745
I just feel totally different.

346
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,148
You know, not physically...

347
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:45,952
I mean, my head hurts
like a motherfucker.

348
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:46,919
But...

349
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,489
This is gonna sound kinda dumb,

350
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,992
But psychologically.

351
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,028
Spiritually.

352
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:02,234
I just feel really, really good.

353
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:10,777
You feel it too,
don't you, Vine?

354
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,081
Well, we'd better go.

355
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:16,849
We're visiting my mom.

356
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,185
It's been like, a year.

357
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:22,655
Take care, bro.

358
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:23,956
Bye.

359
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:30,963
(Steady, mysterious music)

360
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,066
(Door creaks open)

361
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:38,671
What the hell's
going on, Vine?

362
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,209
It's the entire building.

363
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:44,777
Every floor.

364
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,813
The humans have changed.

365
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,892
Something has
come into our plane.

366
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,694
[Helo] From where?

367
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:02,862
Helo!

368
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:05,998
Sorry, Interpreter.

369
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:07,834
He doesn't know
his place, lately.

370
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,568
What do you see?

371
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,238
Disease has come,

372
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:14,707
From another plane.

373
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:17,710
Another world,
infecting the humans.

374
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,146
Well, what do we do?

375
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,349
You must stay in your rooms,

376
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,918
While the Interpretee
look for a cure.

377
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,254
No one leaves.

378
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:34,627
So, you wanna tell me what's

379
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:36,095
Really going on, Cornelia?

380
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,265
Because this ain't a disease

381
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,267
I've ever heard of.

382
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,737
This is a powerful
method of Divination.

383
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:45,938
Yeah.

384
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,274
I'm uh, I'm familiar
with oracle bones.

385
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,877
I've never seen one
with a human bone.

386
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:53,279
Is that the real
reason you killed her?

387
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,183
The sign is a circle
that doesn't close.

388
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,218
See?

389
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:02,388
And here, converging
lines that do not meet.

390
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,725
Shapes that are almost shapes,

391
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,860
Symbols that are almost symbols.

392
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,629
Disease has come across.

393
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,164
Yeah.

394
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,735
Well show me a disease

395
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,770
That can rip a man in half.

396
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:44,063
(Wings flap)

397
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:52,905
I'm talking about the humans.

398
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,874
Not a bunch of fucking drales!

399
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,943
Are you feeding,
is what I'm asking?

400
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,180
(Sighs)

401
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,483
[Television announcer] A
small town is in shock, today.

402
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,919
The deaths of two
newborn babies...

403
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,254
[Mace] He's feeding.

404
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:09,789
[Television announcer]
At Saint Joseph's Hospital,

405
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:10,723
Have been ruled homicides,
[Mace] The bastard.

406
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,058
[Television announcer]
by investigators.

407
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,492
The families have
asked for privacy

408
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:16,128
As they mourn the
loss of the infants.

409
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:21,834
There's plenty of
misery out there.

410
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:27,139
Let's go get some.

411
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,108
Feed in the wild?

412
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:30,843
It's too dangerous.

413
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:32,478
You never know whose
territory you're in,

414
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:35,214
And when you find
out, it's too late.

415
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,258
I won't let you
starve, brother.

416
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,229
I found blood at the
bottom of the stairs,

417
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,364
But it wasn't Dooley's.

418
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,267
It was weird.

419
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,105
Not quite human, but
not demon, either.

420
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,974
I'm thinking maybe he
got one good shot in

421
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,342
Before he was killed.

422
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,280
If you were asking for
something unusual, that's it.

423
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,249
Show me.

424
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:14,086
[Vine] It's gone, now.

425
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,222
Gone?

426
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,892
Yeah, well.

427
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,228
I kinda got knocked out,

428
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:24,030
And when I came to...

429
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:29,301
Wait a minute, there's
something in there.

430
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,245
Does this have any meaning?

431
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,414
Everything has meaning.

432
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,417
Not everything means
something that matters.

433
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,155
You're more than welcome
to chase bird feathers

434
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,823
And disappearing blood, Adam,

435
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:52,892
But I've got work to do.

436
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,061
What are you gonna do?

437
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:57,396
Find a cure for the humans.

438
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,898
(Laughs softly)

439
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:01,934
That's funny.

440
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:04,470
Because every human I talked to

441
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,338
Said they already found one.

442
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:13,479
(Low, mysterious music)

443
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:44,076
(Liquid boils)

444
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:32,558
Luck.

445
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,893
More luck.

446
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,366
(Knocking at door)

447
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:51,610
Hey, Ford.

448
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:53,912
What is it, Vine?

449
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:55,581
Did the humans change back?

450
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,549
No, no, I don't think so.

451
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:04,456
I have a question.

452
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:09,328
You know a thing or two
about demon science, right?

453
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,530
[Ford] You know I do.

454
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,333
Is it true?

455
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,535
Can you conjure a demon
if you know its true name?

456
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,305
[Ford] You'll need
what signifies the demon,

457
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:20,706
Not just the name.

458
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,009
Unlikely to find one,

459
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:25,111
Nearly impossible to find both.

460
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,278
Why?

461
00:32:26,645 --> 00:32:27,546
It's a demon.

462
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,615
A powerful one.

463
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:33,485
He's influencing
the humans, Ford.

464
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:49,968
Oh, my God.

465
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,604
[Ford] Told you
all you need to know,

466
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,206
Now get the hell outta here,

467
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:57,109
Before you bring me more bad
luck than you already have.

468
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:02,081
(Footsteps approach)

469
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,049
I'm building a bookcase,

470
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:07,519
Just getting a little
construction advice.

471
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,122
The Interpretee
need your help.

472
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:12,524
You need to leave the building.

473
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,762
[Vine] Why not
get Ford or Amber?

474
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:18,530
They're hungrier than I am.

475
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,166
We're worried
about what happens

476
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,400
If you don't find anything.

477
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,135
Not if you do.

478
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,704
Your lack of hunger
and your lack of fear

479
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,006
Make you the obvious choice.

480
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,077
You're the strongest
of us, Adam.

481
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:33,745
Just go around the block.

482
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,281
Shouldn't take long.

483
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,417
I'll make a debt.

484
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:41,687
I've had enough of those
outstanding, already.

485
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,623
Cost you more to keep track
of then they're worth.

486
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:08,447
(Traffic whooshes)

487
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,688
[Voiceover] Hey Vine.
(fist thunks)

488
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:21,227
(Electronic music)

489
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:25,564
(Electronic music with a beat)

490
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,645
Is this gonna hurt much?

491
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,647
Man, you gotta watch this.

492
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:43,315
With any luck.

493
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,683
I hear people
freak the fuck out.

494
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:46,152
Sheer terror.

495
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,225
Next time just ask
me to get in the car.

496
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,426
I'll say yes.

497
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,168
My apologies, Mister Vine,

498
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,803
But my instructions from
Mister Granville were...

499
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,705
Explicit.

500
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,141
Yeah, and what exactly
were your instructions?

501
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,810
Well he told me to
make you hit the canvas,

502
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,681
Which means, "to render
unconscious, or knock out"

503
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:16,648
In the parlance.

504
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,150
Yeah, I got it.

505
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:19,451
This way.

506
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,525
(Demon growls)

507
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,859
Ghoul, huh?

508
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,402
Moving up in the world, Tarqus.

509
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,604
Success has its perks.

510
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:40,239
Yeah, so...

511
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,374
To what do I owe the honor

512
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,610
Of getting my head knocked in?

513
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,744
We've been getting calls

514
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,480
About the situation
in your building.

515
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:52,150
There's no situation
in my building.

516
00:35:52,451 --> 00:35:54,186
You've been misinformed.

517
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,257
People without
shame, fear, or misery.

518
00:35:58,524 --> 00:36:00,392
We need to know if this is true.

519
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,393
"We"?

520
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:03,795
Now what would the Clades care

521
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,364
About a run-down tenement

522
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:08,700
Full of alcoholics
and wife-beaters?

523
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,903
The Clades are a
trade organization.

524
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:14,906
The Clades are
our way of life.

525
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,708
Every demon benefits from

526
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,910
Representation in
the market place.

527
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:22,414
Even a freelance misery
peddler like yourself.

528
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:25,251
Ah.
(laughs)

529
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:27,719
But not the Interpretee.

530
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,591
I mean, an Interpreter pretty
much renounces his kind,

531
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:34,426
When he assumes the role.

532
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,862
Offid, Rilk, Vorling,

533
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:38,930
Even a Moloch like you.

534
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:41,567
The Interpretee
have no allegiance

535
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,635
To anyone but themselves.

536
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:46,805
And that's a problem, isn't it?

537
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:52,444
Are you asking if what happened
in my building is true?

538
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:57,249
Or if some plan you put
in motion actually worked?

539
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,484
So...

540
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:01,953
Something is happening.

541
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:04,456
What is this, Vine?

542
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:05,624
A new drug?

543
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,493
Doesn't look like it.

544
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,796
We have to have
a long, long talk

545
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:14,366
About all the things
you're not telling me.

546
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:16,602
(Raucous laughter)

547
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:20,005
(Dramatic music)

548
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,576
Stop it! Stop it!

549
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,445
They'll shut u s down.

550
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:28,914
What do the Clades
have to do with this?

551
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,449
[Tarqus] Nothing.

552
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:32,718
I know you wanna take down
the Interpretee, Tarqus.

553
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,886
Too many demons
believe in them, now.

554
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:38,890
Yes, but does this look
like a master plan, to you?

555
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,461
(Demons growl)
(humans yell)

556
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,031
You...

557
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:47,799
She sent you.

558
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,769
Everything was fine
till you showed up.

559
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:53,539
(Tarqus grunts)

560
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,410
(Vine yells)

561
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:02,348
(Wings flap)

562
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,430
Hey, wait.

563
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:20,899
I'm Vine.

564
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,470
Pleased to meet you, I'm Ron.

565
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:28,574
How uh, how you
doing today, Ron?

566
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,041
Fine.

567
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:32,811
Yeah? I mean, uh,

568
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,947
How are you doing
today as opposed to...

569
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,517
I don't know, say,
say yesterday.

570
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,420
Um, about the same.

571
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,556
Got here 4:30am, I uh...

572
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:46,692
Came down, opened up the doors,

573
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:47,993
Worked the morning rush.

574
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,862
Cleaned the grill, prepped
for the lunch rush.

575
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:52,698
Same as yesterday.

576
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:57,803
Fascinating, huh?

577
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:01,873
Oh...

578
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:04,476
I don't feel like killing
every living thing

579
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,445
On the face of the
earth anymore, though.

580
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:08,880
Felt that way this morning,

581
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:10,882
Yesterday morning.

582
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,585
About every day before that.

583
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,087
But not now.

584
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:19,891
What came over you?

585
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:22,394
I don't know.

586
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,965
Suddenly just uh, had a thought.

587
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:30,035
Maybe all these people
are just like me?

588
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,539
They've hit a bit of trouble,

589
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:36,742
Or things didn't work out the
way they'd hoped they would.

590
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,745
They're confused, they're angry.

591
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,915
But really they're,
they're afraid.

592
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,051
When did this thought kick in?

593
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:48,754
Just a little bit ago.

594
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,390
'Bout the same time you came in,

595
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,526
Come to think of it.

596
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,430
Hey, you want a slice of pie?

597
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,698
On the house.

598
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:00,866
No, no.

599
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:02,768
I'm getting you one, anyway.

600
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,705
Nothing changed.

601
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:10,542
Nothing changed
until I showed up.

602
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:11,910
And not just at Tarqus',

603
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,079
But at the diner, too, on
the other side of town.

604
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,847
You shouldn't have gone there.

605
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,850
There's a game, and I
don't know what it is.

606
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,152
But somebody's moving
the pieces around,

607
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,088
And I don't know who
the fuck they are.

608
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,091
And all I know is I'm
one of the pieces.

609
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,059
And I don't like it.

610
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,596
Not one fucking bit, Cornelia.

611
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:31,963
Calm down, Adam.

612
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,633
Why not go to the diner?

613
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:37,536
You told me to find
some misery, right?

614
00:40:37,536 --> 00:40:39,037
I could've gone anywhere.

615
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:41,673
Unless you knew I
wouldn't make it

616
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,975
Three steps outside the door.

617
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:47,579
You called Tarqus.

618
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,682
We can see nothing, now.

619
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:53,519
You have no concept
of what it's like

620
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,986
To be blind in this way.

621
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,988
Are the Clades working
with the Interpretee?

622
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,156
No.

623
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,025
We needed information,
that's all.

624
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:04,062
So you sent me to find
out if I would infect them!

625
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:07,666
And a kiss just in case I
didn't make it back, huh?

626
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,901
Well I am really
flattered, honey.

627
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,938
You must really like me.

628
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,609
I do like you, Adam.

629
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,012
I've made that very clear.

630
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,149
I don't give a damn.

631
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:27,986
I won't be a dupe for
you or anybody else.

632
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,120
I'm sorry.

633
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:31,923
We needed to know,
and now we do.

634
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,159
What do you know?

635
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:48,574
[Cornelia] Disease has
not come to the humans.

636
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:50,141
It's come to us.

637
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:51,509
I know what that is.

638
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,112
That's Darvatian,
get away from it.

639
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,282
(Ford yells)

640
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,752
There's a protection on it!

641
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:01,887
A protection.

642
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,021
We're trapped.

643
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,857
(Cornelia screams
in very high pitch)

644
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:08,727
Silence!

645
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,664
We're all contagious.

646
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:14,933
We will not be allowed to
leave until this is resolved,

647
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,234
Or we are dead.

648
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:18,737
She sent me to a ghoul club.

649
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24,810
After I arrived, they changed.

650
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,645
Stopped suffering.

651
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,214
When the demons couldn't
feed, they slaughtered them.

652
00:42:29,615 --> 00:42:30,649
So what?

653
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,818
Humans are terminal from birth.

654
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,219
What about us?

655
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,955
So far, the plan is
we starve to death.

656
00:42:41,326 --> 00:42:44,095
Each of you must pay a visit
to a human in the building.

657
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,566
Find some shred of misery,
suffering, anything.

658
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,670
No matter how content
they may seem,

659
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,571
They have a weakness.

660
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:57,142
Find it.

661
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:03,815
(Smooth jazz music
plays on radio)

662
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,116
(Knocking at door)

663
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:12,290
Hi, I'm Amber.

664
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,693
I uh, live down the hall.

665
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:32,010
Uh, my name's Ford.

666
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:33,945
Of course you are.

667
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,246
(Laughs)

668
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,247
Come on in.

669
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:38,349
I made cookies.

670
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:40,018
Cookies!

671
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:50,095
I fucking told
you, I told you!

672
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:51,963
Calm down.

673
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,232
"One more day, let's
wait one more day."

674
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,867
Now look where we are!

675
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:00,305
Calm. Down.

676
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,208
We have to think
this thing through.

677
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:05,944
We can't let the
hunger get to us.

678
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,814
If that happens,
we're fucking done.

679
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:10,415
You understand?

680
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,886
Should we test the humans,
like the Interpreter said?

681
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:17,188
Fuck what the
Interpreter said.

682
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:20,191
That will only make us weaker.

683
00:44:20,692 --> 00:44:21,659
We stay.

684
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:24,362
We think.

685
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,899
We figure it out.

686
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,736
Figure what out?

687
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:33,238
How to break the protection.

688
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,220
(Keys clank)

689
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:53,691
[Ford Voiceover] You've gotta
draw a seven-legged scarab.

690
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:59,230
Then you'll need mercury.

691
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:06,204
Sulfur, and salt.

692
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,841
Put them on the body of
the scarab close together,

693
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,343
But don't let them touch.

694
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,115
They'll be picking you off
the ceiling if that happens.

695
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:19,985
Place the feather on top,

696
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:23,221
So that it touches all three.

697
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:27,392
Then light it on fire as you
speak the demon's true name.

698
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:30,796
(Vine whispers)
(flame hisses)

699
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:35,500
Peronga Ola Vakayah.

00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:38,103
(Ingredients explode)

701
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:43,441
Shit.

702
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:47,212
(Smooth jazz plays on radio)

703
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:48,880
I used to hate this place,

704
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,150
But all it needs is really
just a little sprucing up.

705
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:53,518
Sprucing up?

706
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:55,753
You gave this place
a full makeover.

707
00:45:56,922 --> 00:45:58,523
She has real talent.

708
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,525
She's signing up for
school in the fall.

709
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,039
So, what do you do, Amber?

710
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:36,127
("Like You" by Andrew
Kapner and Landon Newsom)

711
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:45,536
(Female singer vocalizes)

712
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:58,149
* Frustration

713
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,318
* I'm in a place of no escape

* Can't stand the
ways you manipulate

719
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:15,867
* Just to be safe I isolate

720
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:17,468
* Don't tell me this is a fey

721
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:20,138
* When I turn around
it'll dissipate

00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:23,374

00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:26,844

(Amber sighs)

733
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,994
* Aggression

734
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:17,062
* Excuses

singing in low, even voice)

Ugh, what's wrong
with you people?

00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:39,050
You don't need to
show us any more, Amber.

739
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,186
I think we understand.

740
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,088
Don't we, Frank?

741
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:45,256
Sure, it's like,

742
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:48,994
Prostitution or performance
art, or something.

743
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,436
I'll make my own damn luck.

744
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:19,690
(Electronic tones)
(Ford laughs)

745
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,093
Finally!

746
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:27,198
(Dramatic music)

747
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:28,399
What do you want?

748
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:38,509
I said, what the
hell do you want?

749
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:44,382
This is my luck, clear out!

750
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:47,385
Ah!

751
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,396
(Demon yells)
(glass breaks)

752
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,537
You're starving.

753
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:09,707
It fucks with you.

754
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,678
Don't let it, you'll
get used to it.

755
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:16,481
After a while it feels normal.

756
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,608
(Amber hisses)

757
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:46,111
(Vine growls)

758
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:52,717
Make love to me, Vine.

759
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:57,622
Okay.

760
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:03,461
(Fast-paced, dramatic music)
(demon growling)

761
00:51:17,775 --> 00:51:19,444
Do you trust the Interpreter?

762
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,481
Not entirely.

763
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,485
But I don't trust
anyone, entirely.

764
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:33,191
You know...

765
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:36,827
I knew an Interpreter
once, a long time ago.

766
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:40,265
They can't be killed.

767
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:43,768
Everything on this earth
can be killed, Amber.

768
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:46,437
No, they have to
kill themselves.

769
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,311
Fortune belongs to them.

770
00:51:56,747 --> 00:52:01,186
We're all gonna starve, and
she'll find her way out.

771
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,622
She won't even mean
to, but she will.

772
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:12,129
I need you to find
me a way out, Vine.

773
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:19,370
(Door rattles)

774
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:21,406
- [Vine] It won't open.
- [Amber] Break it in.

775
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,712
(Ford groans)

776
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:31,148
[Vine] Get Cornelia!

777
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:34,785
What happened, Ford?

778
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:36,187
What happened?

779
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:37,288
[Ford] Dark...

780
00:52:38,456 --> 00:52:40,558
So dark.

781
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:44,462
What?

782
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,171
He's starving to death.

783
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:55,273
What?

784
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:57,275
Why is this so soon?

785
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:02,280
Just die, you stupid Vorlich!

786
00:53:07,318 --> 00:53:08,253
Look at me.

787
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,291
[Ford] Thank you.

788
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:14,525
Stay with me.

789
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:18,263
Hey, Ford.
[Ford] I owe you.

790
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:20,465
[Ford] It's a debt.

791
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,601
(Amber hisses)

792
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:31,476
What's wrong with you, Vine?

793
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:33,544
You know he's never gonna pay.

794
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:50,295
Come on!

795
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:51,896
Act like a demon.

796
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:54,799
Take what you want.

797
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:56,634
You did with the Sephling.

798
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:58,703
That ugly whore.

799
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:02,239
I know you crave me, Adam.

800
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:06,243
I can smell it on you.

801
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:09,580
I smell your lust,
your violence.

802
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:10,915
Do it.

803
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:13,684
Why do you hesitate?

804
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:14,819
Do it!

805
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,421
Tear me limb from limb.

806
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:19,757
How can I?

807
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:24,995
You can't be killed,
unless you kill yourself.

808
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:30,267
What of our long kisses?

809
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:34,271
What are you and your
friends up to, huh?

810
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,041
Some experiment
with the balance?

811
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,310
You wanna know if we'll start

812
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:42,012
Killing humans when
we're starving?

813
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:46,016
The answer's yes.

814
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:48,719
I've already seen it.

815
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:50,955
[Cornelia] This is a disease.

816
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:53,924
We cure ourselves, or we die.

817
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:55,660
All of us!

818
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:59,864
There is no cure, because
there is no disease.

819
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,701
A demon is behind
this, Cornelia.

820
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:05,870
And I'm going to prove it.

821
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:13,444
Veralka Veedan Tadas.

822
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:15,646
(Ingredients explode)

823
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:25,856
(Glass shatters)

824
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:35,800
(Low, suspenseful music)

825
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:16,641
(Screams)

826
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:22,513
[Voiceover] Good
evening, good to see you.

827
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:23,848
How's it going?

828
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,588
(Knocks on door)

829
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,828
Oh, hi.

830
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:43,133
We're just about, um...

831
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:45,436
Come on in.

832
00:56:48,673 --> 00:56:49,540
You know...

833
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:51,842
My father used to say,

834
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:56,847
"Andre, folks'll tell
you, clothes make the man."

835
00:56:57,982 --> 00:56:59,116
"But don't listen to 'em."

836
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:01,085
"The man makes himself."

837
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,888
"And cloth doesn't come cheap."

838
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:05,990
I just remembered
that the other day.

839
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:07,625
(Jane laughs)

840
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:09,960
My dad said TV
rots your brain.

841
00:57:10,495 --> 00:57:11,796
[Andre] My father
said that, too.

842
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:13,698
(Andre and Jane laugh)

843
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:15,165
I like TV.

844
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,567
[Andre] Well, so do I.

845
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:18,836
Gotta have balance, is all.

846
00:57:21,506 --> 00:57:23,440
Wake up!

847
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:26,844
We are awake, silly.

848
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,815
We can see you're
upset, Mister Vine.

849
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:32,550
Is there anything we can do?

850
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:38,589
Don't you find it the
least bit disturbing

851
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:41,458
What happened in the
basement last week?

852
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:43,961
Oh, I was sick.

853
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:46,731
You understand, right pumpkin?

854
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:47,865
Of course.

855
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:51,936
And you just magically,

856
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,874
Magically got better, hm?

857
00:57:57,642 --> 00:58:01,045
Oh, no, not
magic, Mister Vine.

858
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:03,714
Miracle.

859
00:58:04,682 --> 00:58:05,816
By God, himself.

860
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:06,817
God.

861
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:10,154
And what did he look like?

862
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:15,526
I didn't see him, but
well, who else could it be?

863
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,628
[Jane] What are you
asking, Mister Vine?

864
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:22,600
Andre was going
to forcibly rape

865
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:25,002
Your 11 year old daughter, Sara.

866
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:27,672
Now surely on some level,

867
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:32,309
As a mother, you are
deeply and fundamentally

868
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:35,179
Horrified by this, aren't you?

869
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:39,617
I was a terrible mother.

870
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:43,520
Neglectful, abusive.

871
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:44,955
And thinking about it now,

872
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:49,627
I might "feel a deep,
fundamental horror," as you say.

873
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,898
Maybe I would feel shame,
or guilt, or sorrow.

874
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,668
But my question to you is this,

875
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,738
What purpose would that serve?

876
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,641
Would it change what happened?

877
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,243
Would it protect
Sara in the future?

878
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:09,013
Would it show Andre
and I how wrong it was?

879
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,685
Horror, fear, regret, shame...

880
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,222
Maybe once long ago,
they were necessary.

881
00:59:19,624 --> 00:59:21,626
When we lived in
caves like animals.

882
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,895
We don't need those
feelings anymore.

883
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:26,664
We've evolved.

884
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:28,866
We've had knowledge
and reason for

885
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,002
Thousands of years,
it's time we used them.

886
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:36,173
It's time we became truly human.

887
00:59:41,846 --> 00:59:43,848
I got a second job
interview tomorrow.

888
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:45,716
That fellow Wayne?

889
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:47,284
Put in a good word.

890
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:49,854
That's great.

891
00:59:50,955 --> 00:59:52,022
Isn't that great?

892
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:55,259
Yeah.

893
00:59:58,696 --> 00:59:59,664
Yeah.

894
01:00:00,965 --> 01:00:03,734
(Demons breathe shallowly)

895
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,657
(Mace yells)

896
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,903
You said you would
rip his heart out

897
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:41,906
The moment he
stopped feeding us!

898
01:00:43,207 --> 01:00:45,676
[Mace] It wasn't Vine's
fault, for Christ's sake.

899
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,915
You said you
wouldn't let us starve!

900
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,817
We haven't yet, have we?

901
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,119
I don't see you with any ideas.

902
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,320
It's been a week.

903
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:59,690
The humans aren't
gonna change back.

904
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:01,859
So we gotta change them back.

905
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:04,261
The balance.

906
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:06,663
Fuck Vine, fuck the balance!

907
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,803
And this one I call Penny.

908
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,204
She's Native American.

909
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:17,742
(Both laugh)

910
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:22,346
Where's your family?

911
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:25,750
I don't have a family.

912
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:28,685
Do you have friends?

913
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:31,288
I have a type.

914
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:33,090
I'm a Taryn.

915
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:35,860
It's hard to explain.

916
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:40,097
Explain it to me.

917
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:41,799
I'm a pretty good listener.

918
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:43,100
My teacher says so.

919
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,237
Why not?

920
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:51,708
I had a dream.

921
01:01:52,843 --> 01:01:56,246
We don't dream, but I had one.

922
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:59,116
And I'm wondering if
it's still happening.

923
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,786
Then it doesn't
matter, does it?

924
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,989
Anything you do in
a dream isn't real.

925
01:02:24,441 --> 01:02:29,279
(Orchestral music)

926
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,993
You're a bird man.

927
01:03:19,063 --> 01:03:20,530
It's not bad.

928
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,333
I mean, it's cool.

929
01:03:24,234 --> 01:03:25,069
Really.

930
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:26,937
Don't be sad.

931
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:30,507
Can you fly?

932
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:32,142
Yes.

933
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,079
[Sara] And people see you?

934
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:41,151
No, people can't unless
they've been pierced.

935
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:45,355
It has something to do
with the body, somehow.

936
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:49,059
Or the weight of the world
doesn't let them see us.

937
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:53,163
When we fly, they see a bird,

938
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:56,133
Or something else that
makes sense to them.

939
01:03:57,902 --> 01:04:01,605
If it doesn't make sense, they
don't see anything at all.

940
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:05,042
I think I understand.

941
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,078
Maybe it'll all work
differently one day.

942
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:10,614
It'll all make
sense to everybody.

943
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:12,549
And everybody will
see everybody else

944
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,051
The way they really are.

945
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:18,355
(Vine laughs very quietly)

946
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:39,543
Did she come with this?

947
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:41,378
No, I put it there.

948
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:43,547
Where did you get it?

949
01:04:44,114 --> 01:04:45,082
From a bird.

950
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,151
You saw it?

951
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:48,418
In the basement.

952
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:50,354
The same night I saw you.

953
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:52,456
The night I was
going to run away.

954
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:54,291
A little red bird.

955
01:04:57,527 --> 01:04:58,428
Hang on.

956
01:04:59,363 --> 01:05:00,630
Did it look like this?

957
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:02,432
No, not exactly.

958
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,235
How about that?

959
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,004
Almost, but the
wings weren't black,

960
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:08,105
It was all red.

961
01:05:10,174 --> 01:05:11,108
That's it!

962
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,510
What does it mean?

963
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:18,015
It's the status quo, kid.

964
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:20,450
(Men grunting)

965
01:05:20,717 --> 01:05:21,618
What is it?

966
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:23,587
Stay here.

967
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:28,425
(Fast-paced, dramatic music)

968
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,995
(Demons yell)
(fists punch)

969
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,331
What's wrong?

970
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:36,300
Hunger.

971
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,601
It's made them crazy.

972
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:42,706
I speak for us!

973
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,110
Not any more.

974
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:54,284
Mace!

975
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:58,955
(Flesh smacks repeatedly)

976
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:05,495
(Neck cracks)

977
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:13,470
[Helo] He speaks for us?

978
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:15,439
Does he?

979
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:19,543
(Flesh rips)

980
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:29,719
I speak for us.
(laughs)

981
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:34,391
I speak for us.
(laughs)

982
01:06:34,624 --> 01:06:36,993
I speak for us!

983
01:06:37,294 --> 01:06:39,596
It's like this with our kind.

984
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:43,100
(Yells)
(fist smacks)

985
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:50,040
Okay, Perembra.

986
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:53,343
Rubra.

987
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,421
(Wings flap)

988
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:10,427
(Wings flap)
(dramatic, eerie music)

989
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,074
Show yourself!

990
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:33,049
(Demon growls)

991
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:35,319
Please.

992
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:38,588
Please!

993
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:40,724
Show yourself!

994
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:58,342
(Demonic whispers)
(angelic music)

995
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:09,686
Wait...

996
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:13,290
(Power whines)

997
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,659
Wait, no!

998
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,527
Stop!

999
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:18,528
(High-pitched whine
grows very loud)

1000
01:08:18,528 --> 01:08:19,529
Stop!

1001
01:08:21,531 --> 01:08:22,366
(Gunshot)

1002
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:27,271
(Breathes shakily)

1003
01:08:53,897 --> 01:08:57,734
(Door creaks)

1004
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:07,611
I saw him.

1005
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,181
He was right here.

1006
01:09:18,355 --> 01:09:20,390
It's not a disease, Cornelia.

1007
01:09:21,525 --> 01:09:22,559
I know.

1008
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:26,296
This card represents you.

1009
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:44,948
The physician
represents disease.

1010
01:09:45,315 --> 01:09:47,217
Illness, death.

1011
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:50,420
Also healing, and cure.

1012
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:55,359
But above all, it
represents compassion.

1013
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:59,896
You have done what no
demon has done before.

1014
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:03,199
You have changed your
fundamental nature.

1015
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:05,735
You care for them.

1016
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,938
You have compassion
for the humans.

1017
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:11,808
It is you that brought
this into our world!

1018
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:13,810
(Vine growls)
(Cornelia hisses)

1019
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:16,513
Not me.

1020
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,214
Deny that you care for them.

1021
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:19,783
Do it.

1022
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:21,751
Lie to my face!

1023
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:31,328
Nature abhors a vacuum, Adam.

1024
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:36,666
Your compassion is a bright
hole, in your black heart.

1025
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,770
And nature has
filled it with death,

1026
01:10:41,037 --> 01:10:43,340
For you and everyone around you.

1027
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,876
You must repair your
heart, yourself.

1028
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:49,813
You must kill the girl.

1029
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:07,864
Hey...

1030
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:10,300
Ford.

1031
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:13,537
I need you to look at something.

1032
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:18,408
(Ford breathes heavily)

1033
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:21,811
[Ford] Vine, you devil-whore.

1034
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:24,748
I said it was a debt.

1035
01:11:24,748 --> 01:11:25,982
It's time to pay.

1036
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:30,987
This was lead, when I
shot it into a demon.

1037
01:11:31,521 --> 01:11:33,056
A demon made of darkness.

1038
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:35,692
Okay?

1039
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:37,727
What is it now?

1040
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:48,705
Aurum.

1041
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:50,774
It's gold.

1042
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:54,010
What kind of
demon can do that?

1043
01:11:55,345 --> 01:11:56,846
Any kind of demon.

1044
01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:00,316
Any kind of demon could do that.

1045
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,592
(Ford laughs)

1046
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:10,660
You impotent fool.

1047
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:13,363
You false prophet.

1048
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,732
You're gonna die, Vine.

1049
01:12:16,132 --> 01:12:18,735
Just like me.

1050
01:12:19,436 --> 01:12:20,537
We're immortal.

1051
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:24,808
We're all going to...
(coughs)

1052
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:45,495
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1053
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:48,632
Why are you hiding?

1054
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:54,571
I'm not hiding.

1055
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:57,707
I'm thinking.

1056
01:12:58,575 --> 01:12:59,809
There's a difference.

1057
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,646
What are you thinking about?

1058
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,881
A dream I had.

1059
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:07,517
But you can't dream.

1060
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:09,786
Only humans can dream.

1061
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:11,120
I did.

1062
01:13:11,821 --> 01:13:13,990
Are you going to kill her?

1063
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:19,429
Are you going to kill the girl?

1064
01:13:23,032 --> 01:13:24,000
Sure.

1065
01:13:24,934 --> 01:13:26,736
You're lying!

1066
01:13:28,538 --> 01:13:30,674
You're gonna choose her,

1067
01:13:31,475 --> 01:13:33,577
Over your own kind!

1068
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:38,615
Is it because you think
that she's beautiful?

1069
01:13:39,182 --> 01:13:41,618
And that we're monsters.

1070
01:13:42,519 --> 01:13:44,821
We are monsters, Amber.

1071
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:49,092
(Dramatic music)

1072
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:53,663
(Vine grunts)
(Amber yells)

1073
01:14:01,505 --> 01:14:02,872
(Vine growls)

1074
01:14:08,812 --> 01:14:10,714
(Amber yells)

1075
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:13,817
I don't wanna kill you.

1076
01:14:14,484 --> 01:14:15,184
Please...

1077
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:18,121
(Vine yells)

1078
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:20,156
(Cheerful music)
Oh, man!

1079
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,958
Whoo!

1080
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:23,226
To your new job.

1081
01:14:23,226 --> 01:14:24,728
Oh, no, baby...

1082
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:27,096
To us.

1083
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:31,000
Oh yeah.
(laughs)

1084
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,702
Hey, everybody,
thanks for coming.

1085
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:35,038
(Group cheers)

1086
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:38,474
(Cheerful music is muffled
playing through wall)

1087
01:14:38,842 --> 01:14:40,243
Found you a way out.

1088
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,885
("Surf's Up" by The Surfonics)

1089
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:50,620
(Knocks on door)

1090
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:05,869
(Door creaks open)

1091
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,548
(Gun clicks)

1092
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:31,628
Hello, Vine.

1093
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:38,134
Look, Penny lost
one of her eyes.

1094
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:48,612
You're gonna kill me, Vine.

1095
01:15:52,649 --> 01:15:53,983
I don't want you to.

1096
01:15:55,652 --> 01:15:57,621
But if you have
to, I understand.

1097
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:01,090
You do?

1098
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:03,226
Status quo.

1099
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,561
It's about killing.

1100
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,898
You have to kill
things to stay alive.

1101
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:11,868
That's what you meant, isn't it?

1102
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:17,106
(Dramatic music)

1103
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,314
(Shocking music)

1104
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:28,718
[Ford] The obsidian
sign was corrupt.

01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:32,588
But Fortune found him anyway.

1106
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:33,790
He dreamed.

1107
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,860
Vine is the Interpreter.

1108
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:39,863
He will kill us all.

1109
01:16:39,863 --> 01:16:41,631
I will have my share.

1110
01:16:58,181 --> 01:16:59,615
You okay?

1111
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:01,718
All right, I want you to
stay outta the building

1112
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:02,986
Until you see the cops.

1113
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:05,655
A lot of...
(mysterious, low squeal)

1114
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:12,628
Come on, let's go.

1115
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:41,090
[Sara] Vine,
where are we going?

1116
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,926
[Vine] I'm gonna put
you some place safe.

1117
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:55,905
Yeah, over here.

1118
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:13,356
[Cornelia] The passage.

1119
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:14,958
(Knocks on door)

1120
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:17,460
(Door squeaks open)

1121
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,296
[Vine] Okay, whatever you do,

1122
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:21,831
No matter what you hear,

1123
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:23,699
You don't come out till I
come back for you, okay?

1124
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:24,834
[Sara] Why not?

1125
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:26,235
I'm not afraid.

1126
01:18:27,771 --> 01:18:29,906
[Vine] Well I am, now come on.

1127
01:18:32,075 --> 01:18:33,242
Wait a second.

1128
01:18:37,781 --> 01:18:39,215
(Door squeaks open)
This isn't right.

1129
01:18:43,987 --> 01:18:44,988
(Door slams)

1130
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:47,490
I can see you again.

1131
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:52,261
(Dramatic orchestral music)

1132
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:15,551
Where are we?

1133
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:17,086
I don't feel right.

1134
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:18,521
I feel...

1135
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:20,824
(Eerie voice whispers)
[Voiceover] Vine...

1136
01:19:20,824 --> 01:19:22,792
- [Sara] I'm scared, Vine.
- [Vine] Shh.

1137
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:24,160
[Voiceover] She's mine...

1138
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,030
Kill her...

1139
01:19:27,030 --> 01:19:28,297
[Sara] What's happening?

1140
01:19:28,898 --> 01:19:30,800
[Voiceover] Kill the human.

1141
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:34,103
Kill her...

1142
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,906
Vine...

1143
01:19:42,846 --> 01:19:43,446
[Vine] Come on.

1144
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:48,184
(Suspenseful music)

1145
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,104
(Shocking music)
(gunshot)

1146
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:11,274
There's nowhere to go, Vine.

1147
01:20:14,944 --> 01:20:16,145
(Vine yells)

1148
01:20:18,214 --> 01:20:20,083
[Sara] Vine! Vine!

1149
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,217
Vine!

1150
01:20:22,886 --> 01:20:24,020
(Vine growls)

1151
01:20:27,456 --> 01:20:30,093
(Fist smacks)

1152
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:32,461
(Bone crunches)

1153
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:37,934
[Tripp] No!

1154
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:39,835
(Multiple gunshots)

1155
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:44,107
(Vine breathes heavily)

1156
01:20:48,144 --> 01:20:49,345
(Chains rattle)

1157
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:55,018
Safe here.

1158
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,261
That's enough.

1159
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,397
Just a little more.

1160
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,337
I'm so hungry.

1161
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:20,076
So...

1162
01:21:21,177 --> 01:21:22,045
Hungry!

1163
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:24,981
No, no, no, no!

1164
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:26,649
[Cornelila] Watch out!

1165
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:29,953
(Vine growls)

1166
01:21:30,653 --> 01:21:33,456
(Fists smack)

1167
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:36,325
Vine!

1168
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:49,072
(Helo yells)

1169
01:21:49,072 --> 01:21:53,176
(Fists smack)

1170
01:21:55,979 --> 01:21:57,080
(Neck crunches)

1171
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:02,986
(Blood drips)
(Vine breathes heavily)

1172
01:22:31,047 --> 01:22:32,648
Kill her, Interpreter!

1173
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:41,657
The sign was corrupt,
but it was correct.

1174
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:43,692
Fortune found you.

1175
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:45,728
You dreamed.

1176
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:48,231
You have been chosen to
join the Interpretee.

1177
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:50,499
Fortune has a test
for each of us.

1178
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,168
This is yours.

1179
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,603
Kill the girl, end this famine,

1180
01:22:54,603 --> 01:22:56,505
And begin your training.

1181
01:22:58,674 --> 01:22:59,975
(Vine yells)

1182
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:03,679
No!

1183
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:06,715
(Vine grunts)

1184
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:22,065
We are the disease.

1185
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:27,070
We don't belong here, Cornelia.

1186
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:28,671
Of course we belong here!

1187
01:23:29,772 --> 01:23:31,440
We see everything.

1188
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:34,377
We know everything,
we live forever.

1189
01:23:34,577 --> 01:23:36,345
We are perfect!

1190
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:38,281
We're freaks!

1191
01:23:39,082 --> 01:23:40,283
Freaks!

1192
01:23:41,317 --> 01:23:45,554
We have wings, and
claws, and horns.

1193
01:23:46,322 --> 01:23:47,556
Like animals.

1194
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:52,495
And even then, no one sees us.

1195
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:01,204
She...

1196
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,673
Is beautiful.

1197
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,145
She's perfect.

1198
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:14,783
The world belongs to her.

1199
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:23,058
Maybe there's some
world we belong.

1200
01:24:25,194 --> 01:24:26,562
But not this one.

1201
01:24:29,332 --> 01:24:31,567
There is no other world, Adam.

1202
01:24:32,635 --> 01:24:34,637
There's no where
else for us to go.

1203
01:24:41,544 --> 01:24:43,646
As above, so below.

1204
01:24:44,347 --> 01:24:46,182
As below, so above.

1205
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:50,386
(Speaks foreign language)

1206
01:24:50,386 --> 01:24:52,288
No, no, no, no!

1207
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:54,757
(Cornelia gasps)

1208
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:58,093
(Heart beats)

1209
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:09,538
(Cornelia yells)

1210
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:14,777
Vine!

1211
01:25:27,156 --> 01:25:30,226
What did you
dream, Interpreter?

1212
01:25:31,494 --> 01:25:33,262
That I saved her.

1213
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:35,264
(Bone crunches)
(Cornelia gaps)

1214
01:25:53,716 --> 01:25:54,683
Sara?

1215
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:01,156
Sara!

1216
01:26:26,949 --> 01:26:28,317
(Zipper rasps)

1217
01:26:50,473 --> 01:26:55,478
(Low, orchestral music)

1218
01:26:58,614 --> 01:27:03,486
(Vine sobs)

1219
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:42,257
Oh, my God.

1220
01:27:45,628 --> 01:27:48,831
(Vine sobs)
Oh, my God.

1221
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,049
(Wings flap)

1222
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,051
Where are you?

1223
01:28:13,589 --> 01:28:15,558
Answer me!

1224
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:53,396
Hello, Vine.

1225
01:28:53,729 --> 01:28:54,663
No.

1226
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,735
Why would you do this?

1227
01:29:00,603 --> 01:29:02,070
Because I had to be sure.

1228
01:29:02,805 --> 01:29:03,772
I looked for you.

1229
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,442
I rode on the back of Fortune,

1230
01:29:06,442 --> 01:29:07,743
Through many worlds.

1231
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:09,378
And there you were.

1232
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:11,980
Obedient. Resigned.

1233
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,949
About to become an Interpreter.

1234
01:29:15,818 --> 01:29:17,119
Do you remember the dream?

1235
01:29:19,788 --> 01:29:21,590
That I saved her.

1236
01:29:22,391 --> 01:29:23,892
A demon with a conscience.

1237
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:25,428
Who knew?

1238
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:27,563
And you killed her.

1239
01:29:27,796 --> 01:29:28,697
Not me.

1240
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:30,499
Andre kills her.

1241
01:29:31,967 --> 01:29:32,835
"Kills"?

1242
01:29:33,168 --> 01:29:35,003
Kills, kill, killed.

1243
01:29:35,003 --> 01:29:37,072
Will have killed, will kill.

1244
01:29:37,072 --> 01:29:39,074
It's all the same to me.

1245
01:29:42,945 --> 01:29:44,379
She's running away.

1246
01:29:45,848 --> 01:29:48,517
She thinks he's
asleep, but he's not.

1247
01:29:48,517 --> 01:29:49,585
(Belt jingles)

1248
01:29:50,152 --> 01:29:51,654
It was her blood.

1249
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,391
(Belt jingles)

1250
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,428
But it wasn't human.

1251
01:29:59,762 --> 01:30:00,896
Of course not.

1252
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,666
She's not a human,
she's a child.

1253
01:30:03,966 --> 01:30:05,400
She's innocent.

1254
01:30:07,936 --> 01:30:10,906
Do you want me to tell
you what he does to her
before he kills her?

1255
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:11,874
No.

1256
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:14,677
You're something else, demon.

1257
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:18,080
I will have to adjust, as
I have always adjusted.

1258
01:30:19,515 --> 01:30:21,116
Doing something
she shouldn't have,

1259
01:30:21,884 --> 01:30:24,553
Before it brought luck that
would've worked against me.

1260
01:30:24,787 --> 01:30:26,555
It won't make a
difference in the end.

1261
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:28,724
My plan's already in motion.

1262
01:30:28,724 --> 01:30:29,858
No, don't.

1263
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:32,961
Please.

1264
01:30:35,698 --> 01:30:36,765
Please, don't.

1265
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,634
Don't destroy them.

1266
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:40,969
They are flawed.

1267
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:46,041
I know, but they are
perfectly flawed!

1268
01:30:48,677 --> 01:30:50,579
It's us who don't belong.

1269
01:30:50,579 --> 01:30:51,980
None of you belong.

1270
01:30:54,717 --> 01:30:55,651
It's okay, Vine.

1271
01:30:56,652 --> 01:30:57,886
The experiment's over.

1272
01:30:59,021 --> 01:31:00,455
You're free to go.

1273
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:02,090
No.

1274
01:31:02,658 --> 01:31:03,759
Bring her back.

1275
01:31:05,694 --> 01:31:07,462
Bring her back!

1276
01:31:07,863 --> 01:31:09,598
Bring them all back!

1277
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,467
You can.

1278
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:14,737
I know you can.

1279
01:31:16,104 --> 01:31:17,906
I know your true name.

1280
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:20,475
Is that right?

1281
01:31:21,109 --> 01:31:22,010
Tell me.

1282
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:24,913
You are the one thing.

1283
01:31:26,682 --> 01:31:27,983
Ray...

1284
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:28,917
Enough!

1285
01:31:33,055 --> 01:31:34,523
They must be whole.

1286
01:31:35,524 --> 01:31:38,627
It has stripped the
body, as you said.

1287
01:31:40,629 --> 01:31:41,496
So...

1288
01:31:43,532 --> 01:31:44,900
What do I call you?

1289
01:31:47,903 --> 01:31:50,739
(Demonic whispers)

1290
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:51,940
[Voiceover] The future.

1291
01:32:21,269 --> 01:32:23,606
Shoulda ran while you
had the chance, girl.

1292
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:25,574
That doll ain't gonna save you.

1293
01:32:25,908 --> 01:32:27,843
Ain't nothing
gonna save us, now.

1294
01:32:28,777 --> 01:32:30,545
(Belt jingles)

1295
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:35,584
(Fists smack)
(Andre grunts repeatedly)

1296
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,655
Let me go, let me go!

1297
01:32:39,655 --> 01:32:40,288
[Vine] Hey, hey, hey, whoa.

1298
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:41,824
Sara, Sara, wait.

1299
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:44,827
It's really good to see you.

1300
01:32:46,194 --> 01:32:47,162
Shh, look, it's okay.

1301
01:32:47,162 --> 01:32:50,833
Sara, everything's gonna
be okay from now on.

1302
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:52,334
I promise.

1303
01:32:55,804 --> 01:32:57,139
You told him to kill me.

1304
01:32:57,773 --> 01:32:58,907
And that was a mistake.

1305
01:32:59,942 --> 01:33:01,343
Okay, a really big mistake.

1306
01:33:01,343 --> 01:33:02,845
I won't make it again.

1307
01:33:05,213 --> 01:33:06,615
You promise?

1308
01:33:07,816 --> 01:33:09,952
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1309
01:33:11,153 --> 01:33:12,187
You're safe.

1310
01:33:13,221 --> 01:33:14,056
Okay?

1311
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:17,592
Now go on back up.

1312
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:20,262
Tell your mom Andre
won't be back for awhile.

1313
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:22,698
He's got a few
things to work out.

1314
01:33:28,336 --> 01:33:29,304
Thank you.

1315
01:33:33,175 --> 01:33:34,810
(Belt jingles)

1316
01:33:40,816 --> 01:33:42,017
Hey Vine...

1317
01:33:42,985 --> 01:33:45,020
I just woke up in
the goddamn basement.

1318
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:54,797
What the hell is going on?

1319
01:33:56,832 --> 01:33:58,133
[Television announcer]

The 24 year old going
by the name Helo

1323

Was identified as Jason Miller.

1324
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:11,079
His victims are said to be two
of his fellow gang members,

1325
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:14,216
An elderly resident,
Cornelia Coranza,

1326
01:34:14,216 --> 01:34:16,952
And the building's
manager, Patrick Dooley.

1327
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:20,155
In other news, a city-wide

The police have
no leads so far...

1332
01:34:30,432 --> 01:34:31,900
Wood Lake, is
that close to here?

1333
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:34,169
No, no, nothing
like that's close.

1334
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:35,170
Not to you.

1335
01:34:37,906 --> 01:34:39,141
(Knocking at door)

1336
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:45,113
Hi.

1337
01:34:45,447 --> 01:34:47,082
Thanks for taking
care of her, Vine.

1338
01:34:47,783 --> 01:34:48,817
I wish you'd let me pay you.

1339
01:34:48,817 --> 01:34:50,953
Nah, when you get settled.

1340
01:34:51,787 --> 01:34:52,921
How was the meeting?

1341
01:34:54,056 --> 01:34:55,824
Um, it was good.

1342
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:57,760
It's tough but good.

1343
01:34:58,961 --> 01:35:00,362
I hear Andre left town.

1344
01:35:02,064 --> 01:35:03,799
Yeah?

1345
01:35:05,834 --> 01:35:08,103
I don't know, maybe
I should've given
him a second chance.

1346
01:35:09,404 --> 01:35:10,839
Well, maybe.

1347
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:13,175
But you only get so many
chances in this world.

1348
01:35:13,508 --> 01:35:14,476
Hey kiddo.

1349
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:16,244
Come on, let's get dinner.

1350
01:35:17,479 --> 01:35:18,480
[Sara] Can I come back later?

1351
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,249
[Vine] Oh, maybe, I'm
going out for a while.

1352
01:35:21,249 --> 01:35:22,384
[Sara] Where you going?

1353
01:35:22,918 --> 01:35:24,152
Just over to Wood Lake.

1354
01:35:24,386 --> 01:35:25,720
I'm gonna check something out.

1355
01:35:26,421 --> 01:35:27,355
(Hands smack)

1356
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:31,159
Thank you.

1357
01:36:00,022 --> 01:36:02,490
[Vine] There are
signs everywhere.

1358
01:36:03,792 --> 01:36:07,329
A floating leaf, a sound...

1359
01:36:08,463 --> 01:36:10,065
A shadow.

1360
01:36:14,302 --> 01:36:19,274
It's not the meaning, but
the sign that concerns us.

1361
01:36:19,274 --> 01:36:23,946
(Dramatic orchestral music)

1362
01:36:23,946 --> 01:36:25,113
Understand?

1363
01:36:32,387 --> 01:36:37,325

1364
01:36:55,911 --> 01:37:00,248
(Dramatic orchestral music)

1365
01:37:23,071 --> 01:37:26,374
