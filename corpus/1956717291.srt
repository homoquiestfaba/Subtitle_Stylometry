1
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,917
Ohh...

2
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,453
I've got a feeling

3
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,855
something special's
going to happen today.

4
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,393
Ahh.

5
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,528
Things to do today.

6
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,598
"Make check mark
on paper."

7
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,601
"Cross item out."

8
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,803
No time for that,
I'm afraid.

9
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,873
"And finally say,

10
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:31,144
'That seems pretty senseless,
but... whatever.'"

11
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,747
That seems
pretty senseless, but...

12
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,815
whatever!

13
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,920
That's odd.

14
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:46,460
Joan, honey, did you put these
trash cans on the curb?

15
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:50,364
Oh, I left the trash
out overnight.

16
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,803
Oh, dear.

17
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:59,440
Oh, no. Someone's stolen
our garbage again.

18
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,548
Oh, I just feel
so awful about this.

19
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:09,683
Darling, please.
It's not your fault.

20
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,885
It's the world
we live in today.

21
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,822
There are people out there
for whom nothing is sacred,

22
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:17,491
people who will steal
a man's garbage

23
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,693
week after week
after week.

24
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,194
We can get
through it, honey.

25
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,196
We'll borrow some garbage
till we're back on our feet.

26
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,434
Don't you see, Joan? That's
exactly what they're counting on.

27
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,438
Whoever keeps doing this knows that
people like us sit back and take it.

28
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:32,139
I won't
take it anymore.

29
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,309
Oh, Stanley, please.
Don't get involved.

30
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,311
I already am involved,
Joan.

31
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:39,713
Someone has stolen
from my family,

32
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,916
and I will not rest until
I bring them to justice.

33
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:47,955
Mmm.

34
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,405
Huh?

35
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,413
What in the world?

36
00:06:58,486 --> 00:06:59,753
They're getting away!

37
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,189
I've got to follow them,
but how?

38
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,093
Two wheels.

39
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,730
Four wheels.

40
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,501
Eight wheels.

41
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,002
All right, crooks.

42
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,705
Now you've got Stanley
Stupid on your trail.

43
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:36,123
Morning, Petunia.

44
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,357
Morning, Buster.

45
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,026
Hey, sis,
have you seen Dad?

46
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,260
Isn't he sleeping?

47
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,395
No. And he's not
outside, either.

48
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,397
I got up early
to walk my fish,

49
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,266
and he was
already gone.

50
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,601
Do you think maybe...

51
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,202
he's been kidnapped?

52
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,807
Oh, my God. We must go
to the police station!

53
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,977
Just as soon as we've
left a note for Mom.

54
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,912
Hmm?

55
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,180
Oh.

56
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,565
Take this down.

57
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,803
"We have gone
to the police."

58
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,639
Po... lice.

59
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:29,076
"Daddy's been
kidnapped."

60
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,579
Kid... napped.

61
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:34,548
"Don't worry. We'll
be back soon."

62
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:37,284
Signed...
"Your children."

63
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,621
Your children.

64
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,192
Let's move.

65
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:51,999
Stanley?

66
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,168
Buster?

67
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:56,970
Petunia?

68
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,540
Stanley?

69
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,541
Buster?

70
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,143
Petunia?

71
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,078
Where is everybody?

72
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,486
It's impossible!

73
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,555
It can't be true.

74
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,526
Hello?

75
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,062
Hello, is this
Mrs. Stupid?

76
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:22,996
Yes.

77
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,132
I'm calling from
the police station,

78
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,199
Mrs. Stupid.

79
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,436
We, uh, have your
children here, ma'am.

80
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,839
Oh, my God, it's true!

81
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,875
The police have kidnapped
my children!

82
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,997
You two just sit
tight.

83
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,933
We'll have you home
in a minute.

84
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,258
OK, mister.
It's your turn now!

85
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:44,177
- Bye! Bye! Bye!
- Bye!

86
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,749
Mom?

87
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,919
Mom?

88
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,087
Mom!

89
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,761
Mom?

90
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,495
It's no use.

91
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,264
Mom's gone, too.

92
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:08,001
And we seem to be caught in a
deadly game of cat and mouse.

93
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,117
He left without
even ringing the bell.

94
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,055
Apparently, he only
wanted us to find this.

95
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,025
What's
the Jade Palace?

96
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,694
And what does it have
to do with Dad and Mom?

97
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,096
I don't know,
Petunia.

98
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,331
But it's time we went
there and found out.

99
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,641
Friday. June fourth.

100
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,044
Today my world
turned upside down.

101
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,446
First, I discovered
my husband missing.

102
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:57,650
Then, I learned my children had
been kidnapped by the police.

103
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:02,022
Now the fate of my family
rests in my hands.

104
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,026
Note to self.

105
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,428
I must buy hand-held
tape recorder.

106
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:12,232
Then I will no longer be speaking
into the garage door opener.

107
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:24,912
Some people can be
so inconsiderate!

108
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,425
Just the two of you?

109
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,061
Why... yes.

110
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:45,098
So they have been
expecting us.

111
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,775
Ohh... oh.

112
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,331
And what can I
get for you?

113
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,568
Oh, I think you've got
a pretty good idea

114
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,136
what we're looking
for.

115
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:25,906
May I recommend
the cashew chicken?

116
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,909
You'll get your cash when
we get our parents back.

117
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,878
And don't
call us chicken.

118
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,941
Oh, no. The truck!

119
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,542
It's gone!

120
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,111
I've lost it!

121
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,413
Now it could be
anywhere!

122
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:11,184
Finding it now would be like
finding a needle in a haystack!

123
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,938
It's always the last place
you think of lookin'.

124
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:48,788
I'll never get
the hang of these things.

125
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,591
Still no sign
of Mom or Dad.

126
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,293
I don't get it,
Buster.

127
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,429
Don't worry, Petunia. Whoever
brought us here will contact us

128
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,631
when the time is right.

129
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,408
Buster,
it's a message!

130
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:14,047
"Time flies when
you're having fun."

131
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,984
"Time flies
when you're having fun"?

132
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,818
Wait a minute!

133
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:22,289
Isn't the Daily Times published
just a few blocks away?

134
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,290
Yes!

135
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,792
At the corner of
Fun Street and Fly!

136
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,261
No, it's Maple
and Fifth.

137
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,930
Close enough.
Let's move.

138
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,473
OK. Camouflage lesson
number one.

139
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,444
To look like a bush,
you have to think like a bush.

140
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,349
OK. Here I am
just being a bush,

141
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,484
just growin'
and hangin' out.

142
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,487
Yes, this is
the life for me.

143
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,690
Sure is a lot of soil
around here.

144
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,426
A lot of sunshine, too.

145
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,362
As a bush,
I notice these things.

146
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,631
Wait a minute.
What's this?

147
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,633
I have arms.

148
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,635
I am a bush with arms!

149
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,437
And legs!

150
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:15,042
I am the first bush
in history with legs!

151
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,744
I can walk!

152
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:26,786
Oh, gaze ye unbelievers
upon this miracle.

153
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,488
This walking bush...

154
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:29,722
half man, half plant...

155
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,825
he dwells in two worlds
but is the master of both!

156
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,394
Oh, man-bush,

157
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,297
you are nature's
greatest wonder!

158
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,378
Poor fools
thought I was a bush.

159
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,383
I'll lock up the bikes.
You keep a lookout.

160
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,391
Let's move.

161
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,370
My children!

162
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,416
What's the matter
with you?!

163
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:31,484
You don't know
how to drive?!

164
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,092
Police.

165
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,427
If they recognize me,

166
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,096
they're sure to
kidnap me, too.

167
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,298
What to do?

168
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:57,877
My gosh!

169
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,047
There must be thousands
of people's garbage here.

170
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,882
Tens of thousands, even.

171
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:08,388
Why, the sheer organization necessary
to pull off a heist like this...

172
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,424
I've uncovered the crime
of the century!

173
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,672
Good day, officers.

174
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,513
Yes!

175
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,849
Is that everyone?

176
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,584
Affirmative, sir.

177
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,353
It's show time.

178
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,597
Welcome, gentlemen.

179
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:30,069
I apologize for the unpleasantness
of our surroundings.

180
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,705
The setting was chosen
for its seclusion,

181
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,541
not its beauty.

182
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,479
The weapons
you are about to see

183
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:42,815
are American-made,
and, I humbly submit,

184
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,684
the world's best.

185
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,696
International law has long
kept you from acquiring them,

186
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,097
but as of now,

187
00:19:58,164 --> 00:20:01,100
I hope to help you
overcome that.

188
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,969
Lieutenant.

189
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,507
The first piece of equipment
we'd like to demonstrate

190
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,742
is the dragon
anti-tank missile.

191
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:15,348
Whether you want to foment
revolution or suppress it,

192
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:18,318
this hardware
will help you get it done.

193
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,120
Strange, indeed,
are the workings of fate.

194
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,922
How could I have known
that today I would wander

195
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:27,727
into the jaws of some kind
of super-crime?

196
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,396
Pardon me.

197
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:32,399
Chances are,
my life is already in danger,

198
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,534
yet I feel strangely,
intensely alive.

199
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,537
Every nerve is alert,
every sense working overtime.

200
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:40,307
Nothing escapes my eye.

201
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,345
'Scuse me.

202
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,282
One journey
has come to an end,

203
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:53,920
but I've got a feeling the
real adventure has just begun.

204
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,900
Buster, Petunia!

205
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,702
Aah!
Aah!

206
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,871
It's some kind of
ape woman!

207
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,340
Oh, no. It's me.

208
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,508
Your mother!

209
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:18,077
Your mother's some
kind of ape woman?!

210
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:21,348
No, no. Children,
it's a disguise.

211
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,352
They're wigs.

212
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:28,555
- Ah!
- Ah!

213
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,158
Next up
is an updated version

214
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,427
of the .45-caliber
personal sidearm.

215
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:44,704
I think you'll appreciate
the increase in stopping power.

216
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,501
Here we have
the traditional

217
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,536
M16 assault weapon

218
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:18,538
with extra-new capabilities.

219
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:20,540
Not only will it fire...

220
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:23,376
excuse me. You got a
pen I could borrow?

221
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,482
Thank you very much.

222
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,551
So what's going on
around here,

223
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:33,152
some kind of
company picnic?

224
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:37,657
Why, that's a very
festive name for it.

225
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,792
Notice all that garbage
out there?

226
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,093
It's all stolen.

227
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,963
There's something fishy
going on.

228
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,533
Frankly, our lives may
already be in danger.

229
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:48,901
I hear ya, pal.

230
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,770
At first I was pretty
tongue-tied myself.

231
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,109
Oh, Jerry, help.

232
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,946
I need a new headline for
the entertainment section.

233
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,949
"HBO has given the order
for a pair of original,

234
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:06,085
outer-space themed shows
for the new season."

235
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:08,421
Let's see.
What about...

236
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:15,294
"Two alien pilots
picked up by network."

237
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:16,228
Perfect.

238
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:18,565
I'm sending it.

239
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,735
Hey, you guys, give me a
hand in metro, will ya?

240
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:26,005
We were supposed to be
in print five minutes ago.

241
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,177
Psst!

242
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,579
Sis, over here.

243
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:34,180
I found a computer.

244
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,986
What have you got
in mind, Petunia?

245
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,922
A little ride on the information
super highway, Mom.

246
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,857
In this age
of microtechnology,

247
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,760
the computer's our gateway
to information.

248
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:51,097
Now all we've gotta do
is figure out the password.

249
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,873
How about nose?

250
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,009
It's worth a try!

251
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,547
All right, computer,

252
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,983
now tell us everything
we need to know about...

253
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,052
Stanley...

254
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,555
Stupid.

255
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:18,457
Relax, soldier.

256
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:21,160
A week from now, we'll
both be wealthy men.

257
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,495
I suppose so, sir.

258
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,296
But I can't help
wondering

259
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:28,167
what our country would
think of what we're doing.

260
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,970
This year
our country

261
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,573
refused my promotion,
Lieutenant.

262
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,943
They have only
themselves to blame now.

263
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,716
You really think
we can pull this off?

264
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,320
I gave my life
to the military.

265
00:24:48,387 --> 00:24:51,991
Nothing's gonna stop me
from getting something back.

266
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,363
Sir, I think we have a
potential situation.

267
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,998
What is it, soldier?

268
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:01,133
An individual appears to have
infiltrated the proceedings.

269
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,336
As far as we can tell, he's not
affiliated with any of the buyers.

270
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:07,640
It's the CIA. We're probably
already surrounded.

271
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,877
Negative, sir. He
appears to be alone.

272
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,144
Alone?

273
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,445
Hmm.

274
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,616
Just what kinda
cowboy agent is this guy?

275
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,700
No one is to disturb him
without my order.

276
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:36,502
The buyers must not know
anything is amiss.

277
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,705
Understood, sir.

278
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,477
If I know my business,

279
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,980
the operative
will contact us.

280
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:02,528
To walk into
a situation like this

281
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:03,963
without support...

282
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,198
this guy must be
fearless.

283
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,200
Yes.

284
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,778
And very, very smart.

285
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,884
"Business, weather,
sports."

286
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:27,186
What is it trying
to tell us?

287
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,554
It's computer jargon, Mom.

288
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,791
It's like a whole
different language.

289
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:33,525
Now hand me a photo of Dad,

290
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,829
and let's see what
we can find out.

291
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,201
It's processing the data.

292
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:47,674
What does it say?

293
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,908
"Fatal error...

294
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,677
Drive B."

295
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,278
Oh, my God!

296
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,245
What does it mean?

297
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,413
I don't know!

298
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,649
We've got to warn your father.

299
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,152
Whoa!

300
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,253
Wha!

301
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,254
Oh!

302
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,255
Oh!

303
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,456
Look out!

304
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:05,925
Let's go!

305
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,495
We'd better
get outta here.

306
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:10,930
Let's go!

307
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,980
Our bikes are gone!

308
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,419
And the cops have
surrounded my car!

309
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,421
Run for your lives!

310
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,091
Whoa!

311
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,226
Wow!

312
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,371
...Stanley Stupid!

313
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,353
Cool runnings,
my brother.

314
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,324
Bye. Thank you.

315
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:26,966
Ah. Ah.

316
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,576
Hi. Stanley Stupid.

317
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,011
Oh.

318
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:42,014
Honored to make your acquaintance, Mr.
Stupid.

319
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,616
You must be a highly
skilled investigator

320
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,618
to have discovered
all of this.

321
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,620
Actually, I knew
I was on the trail

322
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,422
of some pretty
crafty thieves,

323
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:54,026
but I had no idea there would
be this much garbage out here.

324
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:57,096
You are clearly an agent
of enormous talents.

325
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:59,832
It's a shame the government
will never reward you

326
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:01,200
as richly
as you deserve.

327
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:03,435
No. The government doesn't
even know I'm here!

328
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,839
Ah. And that's why you've
approached me, isn't it?

329
00:30:06,906 --> 00:30:08,841
To come and get
your share,

330
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,709
one way or another?

331
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:11,978
Actually, mister,

332
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:14,446
I've approached you
because I need a car.

333
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:18,317
Lieutenant, give our
friend the keys to my car.

334
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,454
A gift to the gifted.

335
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:23,990
Well, thank you
very much!

336
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,657
That's incredibly
generous!

337
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:28,060
Thanks a lot!

338
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:33,399
And to think I just
wanted a ride back to town!

339
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,004
Thanks, everybody!
I'll see ya!

340
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,880
Talk about
nerves of steel...

341
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:50,849
completely surrounded,
and he didn't even blink.

342
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:52,584
We bought him off
for now, sir,

343
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:55,354
but what's to stop him
from turning us in anyway?

344
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,623
You are, soldier.

345
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,025
Without disturbing
our clients,

346
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:00,960
follow, then terminate
the target

347
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:02,628
with extreme
prejudice.

348
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,496
Yes, sir!

349
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,601
Meaning?

350
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,403
Kill him.

351
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,504
Right.

352
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,510
Oh!

353
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,946
Boy...

354
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,915
you never realize how
many policemen there are

355
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:25,484
until the day they
turn against you.

356
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,254
This is the biggest
emergency of our lives,

357
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,322
and we can't even call 9-1-1!

358
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:34,060
A crisis like this calls for
even a higher authority.

359
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:37,263
Mom, dial 10-1-1.

360
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,066
I'm afraid that's not
good enough, children.

361
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:43,469
Your father's life
is on the line.

362
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:46,973
I'm calling 75,496-1-1.

363
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,949
Yeah.

364
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,684
Hello. My name
is Joan Stupid.

365
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,387
I'm a housewife, and I
desperately need your help.

366
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:04,290
Let me guess, lady. You've had
a hectic day runnin' around

367
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,857
taking care of
the kids,

368
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,360
and now you're panicked 'cause
your husband's due home.

369
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,595
That's right!

370
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,497
And you haven't had time
to cook dinner, right?

371
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:14,033
That's right, too!

372
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,403
I hear it every day
of the week.

373
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,705
You need our family special.
What's your address?

374
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,307
55 maple street.

375
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:24,576
Uh-huh. And does your
family like coleslaw?

376
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,378
Yes.

377
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,580
That's all the
information I need.

378
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:32,084
Relax. We'll have you taken
care of in less than an hour.

379
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33,685
Oh, bless you!

380
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:35,487
No need to worry, kids.

381
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:38,690
The most sophisticated emergency
response team in the world

382
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:40,892
is working with us now.

383
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,031
Interestingly enough, their
strategy involves coleslaw.

384
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,335
Hello?

385
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,671
Hi, honey. It's me.

386
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,173
Oh, Stanley!

387
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,508
Darling,
are you all right?

388
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:59,311
I'm fine. But you won't believe
the things I've uncovered.

389
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,447
Stanley, listen
to me closely.

390
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:05,084
You must beware
of the Drive B.

391
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,553
What's
the Drive Bee?

392
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,455
We... don't know.

393
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,890
But any error you make
with it could be fatal!

394
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:15,461
Just as I suspected. My life
may already be in jeopardy.

395
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,077
What are you saying?

396
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:33,245
There must be some kind
of interference.

397
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:35,647
Hold on. I'll turn
down the radio.

398
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,353
Oops.

399
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:48,760
Whoo! Hot!

400
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:53,699
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

401
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,700
Uh-oh!

402
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:00,739
Oh, hot!

403
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:01,773
Ooh!

404
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:08,447
Is there something about Dad
that you're not telling us,

405
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:09,815
something
about his past...

406
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,651
that would help explain
what's going on?

407
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,690
Children, I suppose
you're old enough

408
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,692
to know the truth.

409
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,694
And the truth is...

410
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:24,363
your father...

411
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,099
once worked inside
the system.

412
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,066
You mean...

413
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,735
that's right, Petunia.

414
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,104
Stanley Stupid
was a courier

415
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:34,206
for the U.S. Government.

416
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:38,310
At first it seemed like
the perfect job.

417
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:43,715
Every day brought new
and fascinating challenges.

418
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:44,816
Oh, great!

419
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,521
There you go.

420
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,428
537.

421
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,334
537.

422
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:48,780
Then, one day...

423
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:51,183
your father
discovered something.

424
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:53,452
Thank you.

425
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:11,603
That's odd.

426
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,541
Come in.

427
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,417
What is it now,
Stanley?

428
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,885
Something
very strange, sir.

429
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:29,888
It seems like an incredible
amount of letters

430
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:32,791
are being delivered to
somebody named "Sender."

431
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:33,959
Who is this "Sender"?

432
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,496
And what is he doing with
other people's mail?

433
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:40,098
I believe that this
calls for

434
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:42,501
a full-scale
investigation.

435
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:47,105
The next day,
he was fired.

436
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:49,875
They never told him why.

437
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:52,311
But of course!

438
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,645
He knew too much!

439
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,847
And my instinct
tells me...

440
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:59,718
we haven't seen the last of Mr.
Sender.

441
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,329
Is the target
neutralized?

442
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,331
I'm afraid not, sir.

443
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:15,100
It seems the enemy
repelled our assault team

444
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,902
with extreme
defensive aggression

445
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,339
in a... blowing-up-
their-car manner, sir.

446
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:22,941
So... he has
some combat skills

447
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,743
to back up
his bravado.

448
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,145
Who do we have
from Special Ops?

449
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:29,481
McClellan trained
with the S.O.F., sir.

450
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:30,949
Give him the assignment.

451
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:34,853
Let's see how our friend
handles a veteran assassin.

452
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,248
Ready?

453
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:05,551
Ready.

454
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,487
It's high time I got
myself another tattoo.

455
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,823
Just make sure
you do it clean.

456
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,426
We can't afford to leave
a trail of clues.

457
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:16,995
He'll never know
what hit him.

458
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:19,831
Did you know you had a
hole in your gas tank?

459
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:22,834
Actually, that's how
you get the gas in it.

460
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:26,405
Listen, top her off.
I'm gonna go freshen up.

461
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:16,722
Thank you for the excellent
service, old timer.

462
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:18,123
Yep.

463
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:49,354
Well?

464
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,056
I'm afraid
it's bad news.

465
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,459
Don't tell me he took
out McClellan, too!

466
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:54,926
It's uncanny, sir.

467
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,529
I've watched him dispatch
assailants effortlessly

468
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,565
with techniques that...

469
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:01,366
that defy description.

470
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:03,569
Who's our
explosives expert?

471
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,303
That would be
Martinez, sir.

472
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,973
Give him the assignment and
everything he needs to pull it off.

473
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,843
I want it done surgical
and I want it done now!

474
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,980
For God's sake,
we're military men.

475
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:18,484
Killing people
is supposed to be our job.

476
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,626
Go on!

477
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,961
Please, leave me alone.

478
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,040
What are you
trying to do, you darn bee?

479
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,809
Can'tcha see
I'm trying to drive?

480
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,745
Oh, my god!
The Drive Bee!

481
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,590
Fight, Stanley!
Fight for your life!

482
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,199
The tables have turned.

483
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:45,604
The hunter
becomes the hunted.

484
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:54,946
Mission
accomplished.

485
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,549
No one could have
survived that blast.

486
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,690
Now, that's a well-made shoe.

487
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,601
Here's your fare and a
little extra for yourself.

488
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,803
Thank you, sir.
What's the occasion?

489
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,105
It's just good
to be home.

490
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:29,080
Home.

491
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:32,183
You never know
how much it means to you

492
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,052
till you go away.

493
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,557
What are you doing
to my grass?

494
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,192
Buster?

495
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,661
Is that you?

496
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:45,563
Have I been away
so long?

497
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,298
You live next door,
Stanley.

498
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:49,067
Please, call me "Dad."

499
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:50,769
Dad!

500
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:56,174
This day keeps getting
stranger and stranger.

501
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,410
We find ourselves today
at the center of a puzzle.

502
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:02,380
At first,
all is confusing.

503
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:05,984
But as the pieces
come together, patterns emerge,

504
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:07,986
and before long
we can see

505
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:10,288
the sinister face
of conspiracy.

506
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:15,794
And it all begins
with a man named...

507
00:43:26,171 --> 00:43:27,639
Mr. Sender.

508
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,358
Letters...

509
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,861
easier to open than
pistachios.

510
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:52,630
What's inside...

511
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:54,933
is more delicious.

512
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,104
"If you still love me,
Sally,

513
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,507
tie a ribbon
'round the old oak tree."

514
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:04,309
I'm afraid the only thing

515
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:07,578
that's going to be
hanging from that tree is you...

516
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,114
"Bob."

517
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:17,823
Poor Jenny Miller.

518
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:22,127
Nobody coming
to her wedding.

519
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,936
This postal ploy
of yours

520
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,604
is the most evil caper of our age, Mr.
Sender.

521
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,540
How will you ever
top yourself?

522
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,342
With a crime
so unthinkable

523
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,611
that no one has ever
dared to attempt it:

524
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,214
to rob an entire nation

525
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:45,116
of its garbage.

526
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,187
The one resource no one
ever thinks to protect.

527
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:50,421
Yet, without it,

528
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:53,024
every hefty bag,
every trash compactor,

529
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:55,226
every rubbish bin
in America

530
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,627
will be useless.

531
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,629
Desperate men
will roam the streets

532
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,398
with empty waste baskets.

533
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:03,401
Panic and chaos
will rule the land.

534
00:45:03,468 --> 00:45:07,405
The precious balance of
civilization will be destroyed,

535
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:13,211
and then the world will
come begging for mercy...

536
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:14,946
to me.

537
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:20,018
Your job
is to kidnap anyone

538
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:23,121
who discovers
my diabolical plan...

539
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,858
including children.

540
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:35,200
This fiendishness
must be stopped!

541
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:46,778
It's not our battle
to fight.

542
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:51,049
We've got enough trouble getting
soy sauce into these tiny packets.

543
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:53,118
Maybe we can't stop
sender,

544
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,053
but I know someone
who can,

545
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,523
a bright fellow I worked
with in the postal service.

546
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,358
Are the guards
posted out front?

547
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,927
Only the best.

548
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:09,700
Well?

549
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,070
No one suspects
a thing, Mr. Sender...

550
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:14,873
unless that bush
has ears.

551
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:26,351
The joke's on you,
my friends.

552
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:27,752
Bad news, sir.

553
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:30,021
Stanley Stupid has
discovered our secret.

554
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:34,625
At last, a foe worthy
of matching wits with!

555
00:46:34,692 --> 00:46:37,996
Release the Drive Bee!

556
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:15,466
So you see,
it all begins with Mr...

557
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:19,938
Sender.

558
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:21,606
But the police
are against us,

559
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,042
and obviously we can't
go to the press.

560
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:26,811
What are we going
to do, Stanley?

561
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:29,414
We've got to take on
Sender ourselves!

562
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,418
Oh, it won't be easy
finding him,

563
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:36,021
scouring the countryside
for microscopic clues,

564
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:39,024
following trails
that are long-since cold,

565
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,026
sensing him always nearby,

566
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:44,229
yet somehow maddeningly
beyond our grasp.

567
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:45,263
Hey!

568
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:48,033
There's a Charles Sender
listed right here

569
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,500
in this phone book.

570
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:51,436
The manhunt begins.

571
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,051
The car won't start!

572
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:07,986
Maybe the battery's
dead.

573
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:10,288
It was perfectly healthy
this afternoon.

574
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:12,958
Maybe it's got
some life left in it.

575
00:48:13,024 --> 00:48:15,260
I'd better give it
mouth-to-mouth.

576
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:26,671
Not now, kitty. I've got
a battery to revive.

577
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,382
Wait a minute.
What am I doing?

578
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:40,451
I've cooked up some insane
conspiracy theory

579
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:43,388
and put myself in the middle
of an illegal weapons deal

580
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:45,390
with some of the world's
most dangerous men.

581
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:48,459
I've risked my life
and the lives of my family

582
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:52,430
in a scheme that makes
absolutely no sense at all.

583
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:54,465
Insight fading.

584
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:57,635
I must remember
not to go forward with this.

585
00:48:57,702 --> 00:49:01,306
What is it, Stanley? What are
you supposed to remember?

586
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:02,373
Um...

587
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,311
I don't know.

588
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:16,421
Let's go, everybody.
We got a job to do!

589
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:35,506
Hey, what about
the delivery?!

590
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:40,511
You can't just order food
and run off like that!

591
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,615
You have insulted the dignity
of Floyd's Delicatessen.

592
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,495
You're sure
this is the place?

593
00:49:57,562 --> 00:49:58,329
Oh, yes.

594
00:49:58,396 --> 00:50:00,331
When I called Sender's
home,

595
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:03,468
his wife said
that he works here.

596
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:06,171
A likely story.

597
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:08,506
Ha!

598
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:19,484
OK, Joan. You and Buster search
that end of the building.

599
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,087
Petunia and I
will take this end.

600
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:24,722
And remember, everybody,
use your heads.

601
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,080
Oh!

602
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,119
I found his headquarters!

603
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,090
And I've stumbled upon
his fiendish laboratory!

604
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,233
Careful, Petunia.

605
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,769
One false move,
and we could end up dead.

606
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,074
Dad?

607
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:51,876
Petunia!

608
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,944
Everything's
gone dark.

609
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,946
I can't see a thing!

610
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:59,350
Oh, my God,
it's happened!

611
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,886
We're dead.

612
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,789
I knew it!

613
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:18,436
So this is heaven.

614
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,771
It's quite lovely,
really.

615
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:24,442
Funny, isn't it?

616
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:26,511
One minute
you're tracking down

617
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:28,446
the head of a global
conspiracy,

618
00:52:28,513 --> 00:52:31,782
and the next minute,
poof... it's all over.

619
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,552
Sure puts things
in perspective.

620
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:37,722
You know who I miss
the most?

621
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:39,857
Mom and Buster.

622
00:52:39,924 --> 00:52:41,259
Don't worry, honey.

623
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:43,528
They'll be joining us
soon enough...

624
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,763
the way your mom
drives.

625
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,299
Hello.

626
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:49,700
Somebody in here?

627
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:51,636
Dad, someone's coming!

628
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:54,839
You think?

629
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:59,009
Yes, Petunia.

630
00:52:59,076 --> 00:53:01,279
It's time to meet
our creator.

631
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:08,753
Hail to thee,
oh, Lord.

632
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:12,457
Actually,
it's pronounced Lloyd.

633
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:17,595
All these years
we've been saying it wrong.

634
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:26,504
So...

635
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:30,375
this is the face of evil.

636
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:49,727
And this is the diary
of his twisted schemes!

637
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:00,705
Dates, numbers?

638
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:02,307
Years?

639
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,344
What in the world?

640
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:08,679
Buster, come on.

641
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,881
I found out where
sender's going next.

642
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,216
Just a minute, Mom.

643
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:14,452
I've discovered
a mysterious room here.

644
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:17,888
There's a strange-looking
clock over the top of it.

645
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,461
And a control panel
with a bunch of numbers.

646
00:54:23,528 --> 00:54:26,731
One would almost think
it's some kinda...

647
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,399
time machine!

648
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:34,605
Mom!

649
00:54:34,672 --> 00:54:35,840
Help!

650
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:37,508
Buster, no!

651
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,686
What buttons
did you press?

652
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:50,154
I don't know.

653
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,557
Just a bunch of
random numbers,

654
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,759
and the letters
"B-C."

655
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,461
Oh, my God!

656
00:55:22,687 --> 00:55:26,323
We've traveled back
to the age of the dinosaurs!

657
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:36,133
It's just so amazing
to meet you at last!

658
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,702
Well, thank you.

659
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:41,038
It's nice to meet someone who
appreciates the work I do.

660
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:42,473
Appreciates it?

661
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,641
Why, you're the one
that takes care

662
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,142
of the entire universe!

663
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:47,712
But you'd be surprised how
little thanks I get for it.

664
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:51,716
Most people don't even
know I exist.

665
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:54,485
This is the single
most fantastic journey

666
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:57,522
in the history
of the world!

667
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:03,260
Keep your voice down,
son.

668
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:07,364
If one of these things wakes
up, we're in real trouble.

669
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:10,000
They look absolutely
starved!

670
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:22,947
Hey, look, Mom!

671
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:25,583
The cave of some
prehistoric peoples!

672
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:34,559
Their tools seem to be...

673
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:36,627
fashioned of
a primitive Styrofoam.

674
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:38,696
We've got to be careful,
Buster.

675
00:56:38,763 --> 00:56:41,699
The slightest disturbance
to this ancient world

676
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:44,368
could affect the entire
course of history.

677
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,203
Yes.

678
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,907
The entire course
of history.

679
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,515
What are you doing?

680
00:57:01,586 --> 00:57:02,887
Just think!

681
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:05,923
My name is now the first
word ever written.

682
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:09,326
This rock will be the most
sacred mystery on earth!

683
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:11,596
Buster,
snap out of it!

684
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:13,531
When mankind
learns to read,

685
00:57:13,598 --> 00:57:15,199
I'll be worshipped!

686
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:20,337
Nations will rise
and fall in my name!

687
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:21,939
Life on earth

688
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:25,142
will be nothing but a
footnote to Buster!

689
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:29,146
We've gotta get
out of here!

690
00:57:29,213 --> 00:57:30,548
Not to be disrespectful,

691
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:33,718
but I feel that perhaps
we've come here too early.

692
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,986
The truth is, you two
shouldn't be here at all.

693
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:38,489
You're sending us
back into the world?!

694
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:40,891
I'm afraid so. But
don't get me wrong.

695
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,893
It's been a pleasure
talking to you.

696
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,029
But there's work
to be done.

697
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:48,032
So our crusade against the
world's injustice is important!

698
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:50,300
Just head through the
door marked exit.

699
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:53,671
It'll take you back to
where your car is parked.

700
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:54,905
Did you hear that,
Petunia?

701
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,774
We're getting
a second chance!

702
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:59,977
Hurray!

703
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:03,047
Do you have any final words
for us before we go?

704
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:06,050
Well, if you wanna
make my job easier,

705
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:08,452
remember, throw your gum
in the trash

706
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:10,054
when you're done
chewing it.

707
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,057
I spend a huge amount of
time cleaning up gum.

708
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:16,260
So long as we live,
we shall fight that wrong.

709
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:27,471
Sorry, Mom.

710
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:30,808
I sort of went mad
with power back there.

711
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:33,978
Well, the most important
thing is we made it.

712
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:37,014
Mom! Buster!

713
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:39,049
Joan! Buster!

714
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:43,420
Dad! Petunia!

715
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:45,923
Stanley! Petunia!

716
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:51,428
You made it!

717
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:52,830
Are you all right?

718
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:54,565
How did it go
in there?

719
00:58:54,632 --> 00:58:56,433
Joan, we had
a remarkable 20 minutes.

720
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,835
We died,
went to heaven,

721
00:58:57,902 --> 00:59:01,205
met God, and got
brought back to life.

722
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,741
But still
no sign of Sender.

723
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:05,843
What happened
to you guys?

724
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:07,444
We traveled through time
to the age of dinosaurs,

725
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:09,246
and Buster
established himself

726
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:11,949
as the most important and
mysterious figure in history.

727
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:13,183
Buster?

728
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:14,451
Sorry, Dad.

729
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:16,987
And even more
importantly,

730
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,989
we found this.

731
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:24,962
Names, places,
dates, times...

732
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:26,096
wait a minute.

733
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:28,398
There's an entry
in here for today.

734
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:30,267
"Channel Three news
at 1:00."

735
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:32,803
We passed
the Channel Three news station

736
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:33,838
on the way over here.

737
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,505
It's almost
1:00 now.

738
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,941
The trail
is still fresh!

739
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:38,108
Let's go.

740
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:05,836
We're here.

741
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,379
Somewhere
in this building

742
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,747
is the man
we're looking for.

743
01:00:16,814 --> 01:00:19,884
Let's find him
before he finds us.

744
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,096
Good news today
for culture buffs.

745
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:33,831
The new exhibit
arrives today

746
01:00:33,898 --> 01:00:35,332
at the Museum
of Natural History.

747
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:37,267
Here to tell us
about the highlights

748
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:39,436
is Museum Director,
Charles Sender.

749
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:41,038
Welcome.

750
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:42,139
Thank you.

751
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:44,441
If you love
pre-Colombian sculpture

752
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:46,010
as much as I do,

753
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:48,445
you are in for
a real surprise.

754
01:00:48,512 --> 01:00:50,047
In less
than an hour,

755
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:54,251
I will be picking up a stunning
collection of Olmec heads

756
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,554
on loan from museums
all over the world.

757
01:00:57,621 --> 01:00:59,356
I understand
it's exhibits like this

758
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:02,459
have given our museum
its most profitable year ever.

759
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:04,995
You must be
a sought-after curator.

760
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:09,666
Yes. Sometimes I feel
like a hunted man.

761
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:15,039
Try your best
to blend in, Petunia.

762
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:17,374
Remember, we can't
afford to get caught.

763
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:19,810
Excuse me, I'm looking for
the Late At Night Show.

764
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:22,747
Excuse me. I'm looking for the
set of the Late At Night Show.

765
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:24,181
I'm supposed to make
a delivery there.

766
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:26,283
I'm supposed to make
a delivery there!

767
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:28,152
Could you give this
to Doug the stage hand?

768
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:31,421
He's a big fat guy.
You can't miss him.

769
01:01:31,488 --> 01:01:32,923
Here...

770
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:36,693
this will get you backstage.
I really appreciate this.

771
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,967
I'm sorry.
They're taping a TV show.

772
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:46,170
No one gets in without
proper authorization.

773
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:48,205
Oh! Ma'am.
This way, please.

774
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:55,445
Keep your eyes peeled for
anything unusual, son.

775
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:57,481
Mr. Sender
can't be far away.

776
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,650
Just watch for the slightest
sign of strange behavior.

777
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,319
Dad?

778
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,589
They're putting make-up
on men in there.

779
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:07,357
Bull's-eye.

780
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,399
Are they ready?

781
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:16,433
Ready when you are.

782
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,735
Let's go, everyone.
We're on.

783
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:28,012
OK. Let's go.

784
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:33,750
Yeah, but Sly's
a lot taller now.

785
01:02:33,818 --> 01:02:36,153
People think it's easy
being a celebrity,

786
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:39,223
but when they canceled my
series, Malibu Beach Detective,

787
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,225
I was just
absolutely devastated.

788
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:49,233
Well, I'm sure everyone

789
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:51,235
is very sympathetic
for you.

790
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:54,238
You put so much work
into such a fine series

791
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:56,240
to have it
taken off the air.

792
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:58,843
As an artist,
I was truly crushed.

793
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:04,348
It was the most awful,
heartbreaking,

794
01:03:04,414 --> 01:03:07,818
shocking thing that's
ever happened to me!

795
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:19,997
Mom, I can't get
this light switch to work.

796
01:03:20,064 --> 01:03:21,966
Just a moment, dear.

797
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:29,439
OK. Now, let's take
a look.

798
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:39,683
Well, maybe you'd
all be happier

799
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:42,519
if there was no
prime time television.

800
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:48,525
What's going on?

801
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:58,035
You could spend every night
reading books together.

802
01:04:10,747 --> 01:04:15,052
Well, my next guest
is a world-class French chef,

803
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,055
so stay tuned everyone
and let's...

804
01:04:18,122 --> 01:04:19,856
give it to the fat guy!

805
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:23,427
Fat?

806
01:04:23,493 --> 01:04:24,428
Moi, fat?

807
01:04:44,248 --> 01:04:46,383
OK. Let's settle,
everybody.

808
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,385
We're on in 5...

809
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:50,287
4... 3...

810
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,458
Have you ever thought you
came from an unusual family?

811
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:56,860
Well, after you meet
my guests today

812
01:04:56,927 --> 01:05:00,430
you may want to adjust
your standards.

813
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:01,932
I divorced my wife

814
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:04,734
in order to date
her daughter.

815
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:09,873
I married
a Siamese twin

816
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,875
and had an affair
with her sister.

817
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:17,514
I've been engaged
to three of my cousins.

818
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:23,387
I...

819
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:26,790
well, to tell you
the truth...

820
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:28,925
I'm...

821
01:05:28,993 --> 01:05:31,261
I'm my own grandpa.

822
01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:33,530
You're your own
grandpa?

823
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:35,032
That's right.

824
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:36,200
Well, for those of us

825
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:38,202
who've never heard
of such a thing,

826
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:39,369
maybe you could explain.

827
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,005

We'll be back
after this break.

884
01:07:47,664 --> 01:07:50,234
Thanks again for coming to
the station, Mr. Sender.

885
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,536
It was a pleasure,
I assure you.

886
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:54,070
Bye-bye.

887
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:56,406
Sender!

888
01:07:57,941 --> 01:07:59,075
We meet at last.

889
01:07:59,143 --> 01:08:00,644
No time to chat,
I'm afraid.

890
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:04,481
I'm taking over the heads of
a dozen foreign countries.

891
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:10,154
My God!

892
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,888
His plans for
world domination

893
01:08:11,955 --> 01:08:13,157
are already
coming together.

894
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:19,263
You know what's
strange, Dad?

895
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:21,998
I would have thought a man
as powerful as sender

896
01:08:22,065 --> 01:08:23,800
would be surrounded
by bodyguards.

897
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:26,336
You can't see them, Buster,
but they're here,

898
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:28,338
ready to pounce
on anyone

899
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:30,240
who so much as utters
the words,

900
01:08:30,307 --> 01:08:32,276
"I'll get you yet,
Sender." Whoa!

901
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:34,244
Hey! Let go
of my dad!

902
01:08:42,986 --> 01:08:44,288
Buster!

903
01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:47,023
What happened?

904
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,559
It's Sender's men!
They captured Dad!

905
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:55,465
So where are
we going, fellas?

906
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:11,348
Fasten your seat belts.

907
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:34,070
You're a clever man,
Mr. Stupid...

908
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:36,973
if that really is your name.

909
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,543
Too clever
for your own good.

910
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:44,548
You play the innocent
most convincingly.

911
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:46,716
You thought
you'd fool me

912
01:09:46,783 --> 01:09:48,285
into thinking
you were dead

913
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:50,053
and then you'd
catch me red-handed

914
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,888
when I went
to make the sale.

915
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:54,791
A masterful
bit of strategy,

916
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:58,928
and you came dangerously
close to pulling it off.

917
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,930
We'd better
get going, sir.

918
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:03,900
We're due at Warehouse
21 in less than an hour.

919
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:05,435
Warehouse 21?

920
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:08,405
No use gathering
intelligence now, my friend.

921
01:10:08,472 --> 01:10:12,342
Our little
chess game is over.

922
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:15,779
I hope you won't find
the end game

923
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:18,248
too unpleasant.

924
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:20,917
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's nothing I can do.

925
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:37,601
It's no use.

926
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,569
They won't let anyone on
to that Army base

927
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:40,970
unless they're in
the Army.

928
01:10:41,037 --> 01:10:43,139
This is serious.
Dad's in danger.

929
01:10:43,206 --> 01:10:45,342
We've got to think
of something.

930
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:47,944
What if we form
our own army?

931
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:51,014
To do that, we'd have
to form our own country!

932
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,749
We could call it
"Stupidia,"

933
01:10:52,816 --> 01:10:54,818
a sovereign nation
with its own laws

934
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:56,620
its own customs,
its own government.

935
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:58,822
Mom, as mother
of this household

936
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:02,792
your leadership's withstood
the test of time.

937
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:05,094
I'd like to nominate
you as president.

938
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:06,396
To the polls,
everyone.

939
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:08,332
Get this
over with, already.

940
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:11,000
This guy's already
taken out three of our best.

941
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:12,001
Relax.

942
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:16,640
His hands are tied.
He's unarmed.

943
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:20,477
We've got two guards
posted outside.

944
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:22,379
I've got a gun on him.

945
01:11:22,446 --> 01:11:24,714
There's no way
he's leaving here alive.

946
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,883
Isn't that right,
Mr. Stupid?

947
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:33,056
Remember, throw your gum
in the trash

948
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,591
when you're done
chewing it.

949
01:11:34,658 --> 01:11:38,261
I spend a huge amount of
my time cleaning up gum.

950
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:40,497
In the name
of the Lloyd!

951
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:55,379
Oh, gee.

952
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:57,614
All right.
Get your hands up.

953
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:05,689
Thank you,
dear Lloyd!

954
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,892
The polls
are dead even,

955
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:10,360
give or take a vote.

956
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:16,433
If only we knew
who Dad was voting for.

957
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,602
Joan! Joan!

958
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:20,269
Congratulations, Mom.

959
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:22,138
Thank you, everyone.

960
01:12:22,205 --> 01:12:24,107
And as your president,

961
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,309
I appoint
Stanley Stupid

962
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:27,677
head of the Army!

963
01:12:29,646 --> 01:12:31,515
Your first duty is
to go to that army base

964
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:32,916
and rescue my husband.

965
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:34,451
And get our dad
while you're at it.

966
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:36,319
I'm afraid those two
will have to wait.

967
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:38,988
We've got to get
to Warehouse 21.

968
01:12:42,058 --> 01:12:43,359
Joan, give me
the keys.

969
01:12:49,933 --> 01:12:52,101
The car won't start.

970
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:54,471
Dad, you and Mom...

971
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:56,039
switch places.

972
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:12,589
Mom, hand the keys
to Dad.

973
01:13:21,698 --> 01:13:22,899
Good work, everybody!

974
01:13:44,454 --> 01:13:47,423
This must be the place.

975
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:08,945
Well, what have we here?

976
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:22,992
Shh.

977
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:24,728
Sorry.

978
01:15:19,783 --> 01:15:21,317
Excuse me, everyone.

979
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:23,687
May I have
your attention, please?

980
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:30,960
Impossible.

981
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,796
He's amazing.

982
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,564
Before you unleash strife

983
01:15:34,631 --> 01:15:36,432
and warfare upon
this planet,

984
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:38,768
please look
into your hearts.

985
01:15:40,169 --> 01:15:41,170
No guns.

986
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:44,307
Inside,
you're still human beings.

987
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:48,211
You can change
your ways.

988
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:51,080
You all could come back
from the dark side.

989
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:56,786
You. Send a squad toward the
eastern flank of the warehouse.

990
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:58,855
You. Organize a counter
to the left.

991
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:00,857
Your men will back
the first two squads

992
01:16:00,924 --> 01:16:03,492
while my men
rove on point.

993
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,395
But he's only one man.

994
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:07,530
Trust me.

995
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:10,934
You don't want
to underestimate him.

996
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,969
So turn yourselves
in, everyone.

997
01:16:13,036 --> 01:16:16,472
My family and I do not
wish to fight you.

998
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:18,441
But if you
do not give up,

999
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,777
you will leave us
no choice.

1000
01:16:20,844 --> 01:16:21,845
Are they giving up?

1001
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,013
No. As a matter of fact,

1002
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,583
they seem to be organizing
some sort of massive attack.

1003
01:16:27,651 --> 01:16:30,253
I guess they want
to do things the hard way.

1004
01:16:33,556 --> 01:16:35,692
They seem
pretty well armed, Dad.

1005
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:37,526
Yes, Buster,
but so are we.

1006
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,295
They may have
knives and guns

1007
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:40,496
and missiles
and bombs,

1008
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:42,398
but we're armed
with the fact

1009
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:44,467
that what we're
doing is right.

1010
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:46,369
Sometimes you have
to trust in that.

1011
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,679
Let the final
showdown begin.

1012
01:17:03,486 --> 01:17:05,088
Don't!

1013
01:17:19,435 --> 01:17:21,370
Get him!

1014
01:17:28,111 --> 01:17:29,045
Whoa!

1015
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:32,081
Run! Move!

1016
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:38,054
Left! Right!

1017
01:17:38,121 --> 01:17:39,055
Right!

1018
01:17:43,927 --> 01:17:46,262
- Left! Left!
- Right!

1019
01:17:50,066 --> 01:17:52,235
Left! No, no... the other left!

1020
01:17:58,775 --> 01:17:59,909
No, no!

1021
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:13,757
Take your time, men.

1022
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:15,424
He's unarmed.

1023
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:17,761
Or am I?

1024
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:24,100
Ah-ha!

1025
01:18:30,073 --> 01:18:31,107
Ah-ha!

1026
01:18:42,118 --> 01:18:44,287
I'm stuck! I'm caught.
I'm trapped.

1027
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:45,588
Somebody help me!

1028
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:46,856
I'm "cornered."

1029
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:48,858
Yes! That's the word
I'm looking for.

1030
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:49,893
I'm cornered!

1031
01:18:49,959 --> 01:18:51,727
I'll save you, Dad.

1032
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:29,265
Must...

1033
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:30,900
concentrate.

1034
01:19:30,967 --> 01:19:34,503
Focus, power of mind...

1035
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:36,072
over matter.

1036
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:44,313
Channel every ounce
of will power.

1037
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,315
It's working!

1038
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:47,683
I've done it!

1039
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:51,120
Behold the super human
strength of Buster!

1040
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:52,521
Huh?

1041
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:56,960
Grrrah.

1042
01:19:59,195 --> 01:20:00,129
Buster!

1043
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:14,143
Whoa... whoa...

1044
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:24,753
Buster...

1045
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,923
Sorry, Dad.

1046
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:29,392
What the hell
was that?

1047
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,295
Sounds like it came from
the warehouse district.

1048
01:20:47,243 --> 01:20:48,544
Phew.

1049
01:20:56,819 --> 01:20:59,555
Buster? Stanley?

1050
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:01,290
Please be careful
out there.

1051
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:05,194
There's lots of little fires
burning all over the place.

1052
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:30,219
This is the worse fire
extinguisher I've ever seen.

1053
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:07,423
How lovely.

1054
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,062
- Aah! Aah!
- Aah!

1055
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:14,397
Car 15, request back-up.

1056
01:22:14,463 --> 01:22:17,666
Send squad cars immediately
to Warehouse 21.

1057
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:20,436
Car 15,
we are on our way.

1058
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:21,937
Oh, great.

1059
01:22:22,005 --> 01:22:24,307
Fine! Just great.

1060
01:22:50,233 --> 01:22:52,201
We've got to
get out of here.

1061
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:54,970
Not to worry. The police
are on my side...

1062
01:22:55,038 --> 01:22:57,173
as far as they know.

1063
01:23:00,043 --> 01:23:01,977
How do I look?

1064
01:23:02,045 --> 01:23:05,014
Quite convincing, sir,
but what about me?

1065
01:23:05,081 --> 01:23:07,983
You, my friend...

1066
01:23:08,051 --> 01:23:10,653
are on the wrong
side of the law.

1067
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:11,687
Sir?

1068
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:15,591
Get some cuffs
over here!

1069
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:17,126
I got
the ring leader.

1070
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:26,001
Shoot to kill, boys.

1071
01:23:26,069 --> 01:23:28,471
Those are evil men
in there.

1072
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:37,080
You've got to let me
through, officer.

1073
01:23:37,146 --> 01:23:38,547
The cargo
I'm transporting

1074
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:39,948
is extremely cultural.

1075
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,350
I'm sorry, sir.

1076
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:43,686
No one's getting through
here at the moment.

1077
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:47,022
I guess I'll find
another route home.

1078
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:49,358
In the meantime, could
you pull your vehicle

1079
01:23:49,425 --> 01:23:51,627
over with the rest
of the cars?

1080
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:55,631
Oh, Stanley. You were
so brave in there.

1081
01:23:57,433 --> 01:24:00,103
Look! The police
are on our side again.

1082
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:09,812
Yes. Our work here
is done.

1083
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,914
Before we go, there's a
certain arch villain

1084
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,549
I'd like to speak to.

1085
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:16,352
I have a feeling he learned
an important lesson today.

1086
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:23,492
Well, my friend,
it seems you lost.

1087
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,561
I certainly am.

1088
01:24:25,628 --> 01:24:29,198
Problem is, you took the wrong
road right from the start.

1089
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:31,400
Can you help get me
back on the right path?

1090
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:34,270
Yes, I can.
But it won't be easy.

1091
01:24:34,337 --> 01:24:37,873
You've got to turn
yourself around.

1092
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,842
You've got
to straighten out.

1093
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,910
But as long
as you can remember

1094
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:43,846
to head toward
the light,

1095
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:46,014
you'll never go wrong.

1096
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,551
Thanks. You've really
saved me.

1097
01:24:48,617 --> 01:24:51,387
Until we meet again.

1098
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,466
It's been
quite a day.

1099
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:08,271
I have to say that I'm
glad it's finally over.

1100
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:14,877
I'm afraid
it's not over yet.

1101
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,246
You must think
you have some kind

1102
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:19,348
of guardian angel,
Stanley.

1103
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:22,351
You thought you could take
me on and pay no price...

1104
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:23,819
destroy my future...

1105
01:25:23,886 --> 01:25:28,257
and then slip through my
fingers again and again.

1106
01:25:28,324 --> 01:25:32,461
Well, not this time,
bucko!

1107
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:35,898
This time I'm gonna
take care of you myself.

1108
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:40,936
Where's your guardian
angel now?

1109
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:43,138
Betcha surprised
to see me!

1110
01:25:43,206 --> 01:25:44,407
We certainly are.

1111
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,209
And very impressed,
I might add.

1112
01:25:46,275 --> 01:25:48,244
Let this be
a lesson to you.

1113
01:25:48,311 --> 01:25:49,545
Nobody gets away
from me.

1114
01:25:49,612 --> 01:25:52,114
I've been on
the job too long.

1115
01:25:52,181 --> 01:25:53,649
Here's your bill.

1116
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:03,726
I would have thought guardian
angels worked for free.

1117
01:26:03,792 --> 01:26:07,496
Oh, Joan. You're so
wonderfully naive.

1118
01:26:09,665 --> 01:26:11,934
I assume you work
for the Lloyd?

1119
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,204
Me? No. My boss'
name is Floyd.

1120
01:26:15,271 --> 01:26:19,575
No, it's pronounced
Lloyd.

1121
01:26:27,049 --> 01:26:28,651
Hey, neighbor.

1122
01:26:28,717 --> 01:26:29,652
Hey, Stanley.

1123
01:26:29,718 --> 01:26:31,186
Didn't see you around
much this weekend.

1124
01:26:31,254 --> 01:26:32,321
Whatcha been doing?

1125
01:26:32,388 --> 01:26:33,756
This and that...

1126
01:26:33,822 --> 01:26:36,925
had breakfast, read the paper,
saved the world.

1127
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:38,093
Is that right?

1128
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,662
Today I thought
we'd have a barbeque.

1129
01:26:39,728 --> 01:26:41,730
Stop by. There's plenty
for everyone.

1130
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:44,333
Thanks, Stanley,
but I left the water

1131
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,435
running in my bathtub.

1132
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:50,366
This is gonna be
great, Dad!

1133
01:27:50,433 --> 01:27:52,134
Say, how can I help?

1134
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,702
You can flip
the burgers, son,

1135
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:56,505
but I'd better handle
the lighter fluid.

1136
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:58,307
See? "Keep out of reach
of children."

1137
01:27:58,374 --> 01:28:00,142
You've gotta
be careful.

1138
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,284
What is it, boy?

1139
01:28:13,255 --> 01:28:14,757
What is it, kitty?

1140
01:28:32,074 --> 01:28:33,008
Are you hungry?

1141
01:28:33,075 --> 01:28:34,009
You want a biscuit?

1142
01:28:38,681 --> 01:28:43,118
That poor dog doesn't know
what he wants sometimes.
