1
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:15,327
Are you the guys from Washington?

2
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:17,235
You get many other visitors out here?

3
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,898
How long you been on-site?

4
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:20,373
Since this morning.

5
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:23,104
A Russian oil team
called it in about 18 hours ago.

6
00:01:23,346 --> 00:01:25,712
How come nobody spotted it before?

7
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:27,510
It's really not that surprising.

8
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:30,111
This landscape's changing all the time.

9
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:32,050
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

10
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:34,213
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

11
00:01:34,323 --> 00:01:35,654
I don't think so.

12
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:37,783
You know, we don't have
the equipment for a job like this.

13
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:40,527
How long before
we can start craning it out?

14
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,525
I don't think you quite understand.

15
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:45,560
You guys are gonna need
one hell of a crane.

16
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:34,082
<i>Base, we're in.</i>

17
00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:41,486
<i>What is this?</i>

18
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:57,932
<i>Careful.</i>

19
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:20,125
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

20
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:24,529
<i>What is it?</i>

21
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,197
<i>My God.</i>

22
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:28,970
<i>Base, get me a line to the Colonel.</i>

23
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:31,138
<i>It's 3:00 a.m., sir.</i>

24
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,802
<i>I don't care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.</i>

25
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,739
Open it!

26
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:52,211
Quickly, before he...

27
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:08,066
It has taken me a long time
to find this place.

28
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:12,335
You should be commended.

29
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:13,430
Help him up.

30
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:21,348
I think that you are
a man of great vision.

31
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,880
And, in this way, we are much alike.

32
00:05:23,986 --> 00:05:25,419
I am nothing like you.

33
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:27,045
No, of course, but

34
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:32,683
what others see as superstition,
you and I know to be a science.

35
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:35,059
What you seek is just a legend.

36
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:37,689
Then why make such an effort
to conceal it?

37
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:02,888
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

38
00:06:07,963 --> 00:06:10,591
It is not something one buries.

39
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:15,394
But I think it is close, yes?

40
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:17,468
I cannot help you.

41
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:22,176
No. But maybe
you can help your village.

42
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:27,538
You must have some friends out there.
Some little grandchildren, perhaps?

43
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:30,650
I have no need for them to die.

44
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,391
Yggdrasil.

45
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:49,670
Tree of the world.

46
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,634
Guardian of wisdom.

47
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,579
And fate, also.

48
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:33,207
<i>And the Führer digs for trinkets
in the desert.</i>

49
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:39,621
You have never seen this, have you?

50
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:43,684
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

51
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:45,393
Exactly.

52
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:50,891
Give the order to open fire.

53
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,265
Fool!

54
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:56,200
You cannot control the power you hold.

55
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:57,329
You will burn!

56
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,169
I already have.

57
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:14,589
<i>O'Connell, Michael.</i>

58
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:17,449
Kaminsky, Henry.

59
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:19,784
Boy, a lot of guys
getting killed over there.

60
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:21,722
Rogers, Steven.

61
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:25,596
It kind of makes you think twice
about enlisting, huh?

62
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:27,261
Nope.

63
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,706
Rogers.

64
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,540
- What did your father die of?
- Mustard gas.

65
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:44,580
He was in the 107th Infantry.
I was hoping I could be assigned...

66
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:47,382
- Your mother?
- She was a nurse in a TB ward.

67
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,580
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.

68
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:56,188
- Sorry, son.
- Look, just give me a chance.

69
00:08:56,298 --> 00:08:58,858
You'd be ineligible
on your asthma alone.

70
00:08:59,334 --> 00:09:00,358
Is there anything you can do?

71
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:02,166
I'm doing it.

72
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:03,866
I'm saving your life.

73
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,378
<i>War continues to ravage Europe.</i>

74
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:13,381
<i>But help is on the way.</i>

75
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:18,779
<i>Every able-bodied young man is
lining up to serve his country.</i>

76
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,386
<i>Even little Timmy is doing his part</i>

77
00:09:24,526 --> 00:09:26,494
<i>collecting scrap metal.</i>

78
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:27,717
<i>Nice work, Timmy!</i>

79
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,092
Who cares?

80
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:31,857
Play the movie already!

81
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,662
Hey, you wanna show some respect?

82
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:35,130
<i>Meanwhile, overseas,</i>

83
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:38,297
<i>our brave boys are showing
the Axis powers that the price</i>

84
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:40,136
<i>of freedom is never too high.</i>

85
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:42,540
Let's go! Get on with it!

86
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,208
Hey, just start the cartoon!

87
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:46,440
Hey, you wanna shut up?

88
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:50,010
<i>Together with Allied forces,
we'll face any threat,</i>

89
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:51,449
<i>no matter the size.</i>

90
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:10,667
You just don't know when to give up,
do you?

91
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:13,203
I can do this all day.

92
00:10:17,613 --> 00:10:18,841
Hey!

93
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:20,414
Pick on someone your own size.

94
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:31,626
Sometimes I think
you like getting punched.

95
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,954
I had him on the ropes.

96
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,195
How many times is this?

97
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:39,559
You're from Paramus now?

98
00:10:39,835 --> 00:10:42,565
You know it's illegal to lie
on the enlistment form.

99
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,138
And seriously, Jersey?

100
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:47,373
You get your orders?

101
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,036
The 107th.

102
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:52,845
Sergeant James Barnes,

103
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:55,314
shipping out for England
first thing tomorrow.

104
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,312
I should be going.

105
00:11:03,926 --> 00:11:04,915
Come on, man.

106
00:11:05,694 --> 00:11:08,595
My last night!
I got to get you cleaned up.

107
00:11:08,697 --> 00:11:10,221
Why? Where are we going?

108
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:11,662
The future.

109
00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:18,563
I don't see what the problem is.

110
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:21,268
You're about to be
the last eligible man in New York.

111
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:23,875
You know there's
three and a half million women here?

112
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:25,207
Well, I'd settle for just one.

113
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:27,647
Good thing I took care of that.

114
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:29,341
Hey, Bucky!

115
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:33,746
What'd you tell her about me?

116
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:35,820
Only the good stuff.

117
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:40,085
<i>Welcome to
the Modern Marvels Pavilion</i>

118
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:42,823
<i>and the World of Tomorrow.</i>

119
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:47,132
<i>A greater world. A better world.</i>

120
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:52,965
Oh, my God! It's starting!

121
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:57,803
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Howard Stark!</i>

122
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:10,055
I love you, Howard!

123
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:14,226
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

124
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:19,159
<i>what if I told you that in just
a few short years, your automobile</i>

125
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:22,335
<i>won't even have to
touch the ground at all?</i>

126
00:12:24,106 --> 00:12:26,472
<i>Yes. Thanks, Mandy.</i>

127
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:28,873
<i>With Stark Gravitic
Reversion Technology</i>

128
00:12:29,277 --> 00:12:31,142
<i>you'll be able to do just that.</i>

129
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:40,750
Holy cow.

130
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:55,227
<i>I did say a few years, didn't I?</i>

131
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:07,144
Hey, Steve, what do you say
we treat these girls...

132
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,754
Come on, soldier.

133
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:24,825
Come on. You're kind of
missing the point of a double date.

134
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,400
We're taking the girls dancing.

135
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,526
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

136
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,497
You're really going to do this again?

137
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:35,098
Well, it's a fair. I'm gonna try my luck.

138
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,905
As who, Steve from Ohio?

139
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:39,344
They'll catch you.
Or worse, they'll actually take you.

140
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:41,345
Look, I know
you don't think I can do this.

141
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,815
This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.

142
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:44,881
- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?

143
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:46,817
- There are so many important jobs.
- What do you want me to do?

144
00:13:46,922 --> 00:13:48,856
Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?

145
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:50,549
- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.

146
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:53,219
Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.

147
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:56,356
I got no right to do any less than them.

148
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:59,093
That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.

149
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:02,662
Right. 'Cause you got nothing to prove.

150
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:08,407
Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?

151
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:11,441
Yes, we are.

152
00:14:17,285 --> 00:14:19,515
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

153
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:20,645
How can I?

154
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:22,954
You're taking all the stupid with you.

155
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,288
- You're a punk.
- Jerk.

156
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:30,759
Be careful.

157
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:35,660
Don't win the war till I get there!

158
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:43,710
Come on, girls.
They're playing our song.

159
00:15:03,265 --> 00:15:04,493
Wait here.

160
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:07,934
- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.

161
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:28,185
Thank you.

162
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:33,085
So,

163
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:37,265
you want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.

164
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,930
Excuse me?

165
00:15:40,302 --> 00:15:41,894
Dr. Abraham Erskine.

166
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:44,699
I represent
the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

167
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,132
Steve Rogers.

168
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:52,203
Where are you from?

169
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:56,777
Queens. 73rd Street
and Utopia Parkway.

170
00:15:57,252 --> 00:15:59,220
Before that, Germany.

171
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,120
- This troubles you?
- No.

172
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:05,251
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?

173
00:16:05,594 --> 00:16:07,289
Is it New Haven?

174
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:09,795
Or Paramus?

175
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:13,062
Five exams in five different cities.

176
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:14,192
That might not be the right file.

177
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:16,133
No, it's not the exams I'm interested in.

178
00:16:16,238 --> 00:16:18,365
It's the five tries.

179
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:23,571
But you didn't answer my question.
Do you want to kill Nazis?

180
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:27,537
Is this a test?

181
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,247
Yes.

182
00:16:33,355 --> 00:16:34,982
I don't want to kill anyone.

183
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:38,851
I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.

184
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:41,857
Well, there are already

185
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:43,897
so many big men fighting this war.

186
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:45,962
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

187
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,803
I can offer you a chance.

188
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:53,071
Only a chance.

189
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:54,903
- I'll take it.
- Good.

190
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:59,944
So where is
the little guy from? Actually?

191
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:02,279
Brooklyn.

192
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:06,920
Congratulations, soldier.

193
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,206
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?

194
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:38,312
My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.

195
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,912
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.

196
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,617
Are you certain
that those conductors of yours

197
00:17:44,726 --> 00:17:48,787
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

198
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,463
With this artifact

199
00:17:51,132 --> 00:17:52,463
I am certain of nothing.

200
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,133
I fear it may not work at all.

201
00:18:32,273 --> 00:18:33,467
Twenty percent.

202
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,041
Forty.

203
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,079
Sixty.

204
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:45,783
Stabilizing at 70%.

205
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:51,618
I have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.

206
00:19:10,178 --> 00:19:11,736
What was that?

207
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:15,441
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

208
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,713
Your designs do not disappoint.

209
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,120
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

210
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:26,122
The exchange is stable.

211
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:28,161
Amazing!

212
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,855
The energy we have just collected

213
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:33,900
could power my designs.
All my designs.

214
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:38,869
This will change the war.

215
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:41,336
Dr. Zola,

216
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:45,679
this will change the world.

217
00:19:48,216 --> 00:19:50,081
Ready, exercise!

218
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:51,948
Recruits, attention!

219
00:19:52,954 --> 00:19:54,478
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

220
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:57,450
I supervise all operations
for this division.

221
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:59,690
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?

222
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,886
I thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

223
00:20:03,064 --> 00:20:04,122
What's your name, soldier?

224
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:06,227
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

225
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,029
Step forward, Hodge.

226
00:20:09,804 --> 00:20:11,169
Put your right foot forward.

227
00:20:12,607 --> 00:20:13,938
We gonna wrassle?

228
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:18,143
'Cause I got a few moves
I know you'll like.

229
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:22,277
Agent Carter!

230
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,015
Colonel Phillips.

231
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,088
I can see that you are
breaking in the candidates. That's good!

232
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:29,084
Get your ass up out of that dirt

233
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,920
and stand in that line at attention till
somebody comes tells you what to do.

234
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:33,459
Yes, sir!

235
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,096
General Patton has said

236
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:43,296
that wars are fought with weapons,
but they are won by men.

237
00:20:43,404 --> 00:20:46,931
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

238
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:53,507
And because they are
going to get better.

239
00:20:53,615 --> 00:20:55,583
Much better.

240
00:20:56,417 --> 00:21:00,148
<i>The Strategic Scientific Reserve
is an Allied effort</i>

241
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:03,280
<i>made up of
the best minds in the free world.</i>

242
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,885
<i>Our goal is
to create the best army in history.</i>

243
00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:09,327
<i>But every army starts with one man.</i>

244
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:11,561
Rogers! Get off of there!

245
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:13,759
<i>At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.</i>

246
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:17,964
He will be the first
in a new breed of super-soldier.

247
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:26,611
Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!

248
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:31,344
And they will personally escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.

249
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:33,813
Pick up the pace, ladies!

250
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:37,947
Let's go, let's go! Double time!

251
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:41,091
Come on! Faster! Faster!

252
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:43,861
Move! Move!

253
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:46,200
Squad, halt!

254
00:21:46,868 --> 00:21:49,098
That flag means
we're only at the halfway point.

255
00:21:49,837 --> 00:21:53,238
First man to bring it to me
gets a ride back with Agent Carter.

256
00:21:53,341 --> 00:21:55,036
Move, move!

257
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,807
Come on! Get up there!

258
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,775
If that's all you got,
this army's in trouble!

259
00:22:00,882 --> 00:22:02,440
Get up there, Hodge!

260
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:05,082
Come on! Get up there!

261
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:09,188
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years!

262
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:14,153
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!

263
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:16,526
Let's go! Get back into formation!

264
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:21,262
Rogers! I said fall in!

265
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:39,076
Thank you, sir.

266
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:50,090
Faster, ladies! Come on.

267
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:52,696
My grandmother has more life in her,
God rest her soul.

268
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:55,157
Move it!

269
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,397
You're not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

270
00:22:57,505 --> 00:23:00,406
I'm more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.

271
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:03,807
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

272
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:05,310
I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."

273
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:07,108
Maybe he'd be useful to you,
like a gerbil.

274
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:08,239
I never thought you'd pick him.

275
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:09,509
Up.

276
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,352
You stick a needle in that kid's arm,
it's gonna go right through him.

277
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:16,923
- Come on, girls.
- Look at that.

278
00:23:17,892 --> 00:23:19,257
He's making me cry.

279
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,920
I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

280
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,624
Do you know how long it took
to set up this project?

281
00:23:24,732 --> 00:23:25,824
All the groveling I had to do

282
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,093
in front of Senator
What's-His-Name's committees?

283
00:23:27,201 --> 00:23:29,396
Brandt. Yes, I know.
I am well aware of your efforts.

284
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:32,735
Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

285
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,740
He's big, he's fast. He obeys orders.

286
00:23:34,842 --> 00:23:36,275
- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.

287
00:23:36,544 --> 00:23:39,274
You don't win wars
with niceness, Doctor.

288
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:45,415
You win wars with guts.

289
00:23:47,555 --> 00:23:48,715
Grenade!

290
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:54,558
Get away!

291
00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:56,461
Get back!

292
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:05,295
It was a dummy grenade.

293
00:24:06,407 --> 00:24:08,398
All clear. Back in formation.

294
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:13,772
Is this a test?

295
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,676
He's still skinny.

296
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:26,887
- May I?
- Yeah.

297
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:31,528
Can't sleep?

298
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,997
I got the jitters, I guess.

299
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:35,866
Me, too.

300
00:24:37,672 --> 00:24:39,196
Can I ask you a question?

301
00:24:39,307 --> 00:24:40,672
Just one?

302
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,309
Why me?

303
00:24:47,348 --> 00:24:50,146
I suppose that is
the only question that matters.

304
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:56,323
This is from Augsburg. My city.

305
00:24:59,026 --> 00:25:00,050
So many people forget

306
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:02,629
that the first country the Nazis invaded
was their own.

307
00:25:03,364 --> 00:25:06,765
You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.

308
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:09,769
They felt weak. They felt small.

309
00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:11,600
And then Hitler comes along
with the marching

310
00:25:11,706 --> 00:25:14,698
and the big show and the flags.

311
00:25:16,043 --> 00:25:20,036
And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.

312
00:25:20,148 --> 00:25:21,445
And he says, "You."

313
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:24,146
He says, "You will make us strong."

314
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:27,547
Well, I am not interested.

315
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,322
So he sends the head of Hydra,

316
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:33,761
his research division.

317
00:25:34,061 --> 00:25:36,689
A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.

318
00:25:36,964 --> 00:25:39,398
Now, Schmidt is
a member of the inner circle.

319
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,797
And he is ambitious.

320
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:46,502
<i>He and Hitler share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.</i>

321
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:50,267
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

322
00:25:50,378 --> 00:25:52,141
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

323
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:55,639
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced

324
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,275
that there is a great power
hidden in the earth,

325
00:25:58,386 --> 00:25:59,614
<i>left here by the gods,</i>

326
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,518
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

327
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,118
So when he hears about my formula
and what it can do, he cannot resist.

328
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:13,725
<i>Schmidt must become
that superior man.</i>

329
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,532
Did it make him stronger?

330
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:22,003
Yes.

331
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:25,344
But there were other effects.

332
00:26:29,817 --> 00:26:30,943
The serum was not ready.

333
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:35,155
But more important, the man.

334
00:26:36,123 --> 00:26:38,387
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

335
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:41,621
so good becomes great.

336
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:43,424
Bad becomes worse.

337
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:50,328
This is why you were chosen.

338
00:26:51,472 --> 00:26:54,999
Because a strong man
who has known power all his life

339
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:57,043
may lose respect for that power,

340
00:26:57,144 --> 00:27:00,307
but a weak man knows
the value of strength.

341
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:02,680
And knows

342
00:27:03,217 --> 00:27:04,514
compassion.

343
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:10,452
Thanks. I think.

344
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:19,298
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

345
00:27:22,503 --> 00:27:24,596
That you will stay who you are.

346
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:29,109
Not a perfect soldier,

347
00:27:29,477 --> 00:27:30,466
but

348
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:32,946
a good man.

349
00:27:38,152 --> 00:27:39,619
To the little guys.

350
00:27:42,256 --> 00:27:43,689
No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?

351
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:45,918
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.

352
00:27:47,194 --> 00:27:49,025
All right. We'll drink it after.

353
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:52,697
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.
Drink it after? I drink it now.

354
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:11,082
Is there something in particular
you need?

355
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:19,756
I understand you found him.

356
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:22,222
See for yourself.

357
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,865
You disapprove.

358
00:28:36,577 --> 00:28:39,603
I just don't see
why you need concern yourself.

359
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:41,443
I can't imagine he will succeed.

360
00:28:44,485 --> 00:28:45,679
Again.

361
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:50,080
His serum is the Allies' only defense
against this power we now possess.

362
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:53,786
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

363
00:28:56,998 --> 00:28:58,625
Shall I give the order?

364
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:01,634
It has been given.

365
00:29:03,838 --> 00:29:05,135
Good.

366
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:08,775
Dr. Zola!

367
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,377
What do you think?

368
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:23,155
A masterpiece.

369
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:35,162
I know this neighborhood.

370
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,065
I got beat up in that alley.

371
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:40,731
And that parking lot.

372
00:29:43,044 --> 00:29:44,944
And behind that diner.

373
00:29:45,446 --> 00:29:47,846
Did you have something against
running away?

374
00:29:50,584 --> 00:29:53,018
You start running,
they'll never let you stop.

375
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,179
You stand up, you push back.

376
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:56,586
They can't say no forever, right?

377
00:29:57,391 --> 00:30:00,849
I know a little of what that's like,
to have every door shut in your face.

378
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:04,129
I guess I just don't know
why you'd want to join the Army

379
00:30:04,231 --> 00:30:05,596
if you were a beautiful dame.

380
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,233
Or a... A woman.

381
00:30:07,435 --> 00:30:08,732
An agent. Not a dame.

382
00:30:09,136 --> 00:30:10,660
You are beautiful, but...

383
00:30:11,472 --> 00:30:13,667
You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?

384
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:16,209
I think this is the longest conversation
I've had with one.

385
00:30:17,678 --> 00:30:21,205
Women aren't exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.

386
00:30:21,615 --> 00:30:22,912
You must have danced.

387
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:25,679
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

388
00:30:26,754 --> 00:30:28,745
And the past few years, it just

389
00:30:28,856 --> 00:30:31,723
didn't seem to matter that much.
I figured I'd wait.

390
00:30:32,093 --> 00:30:33,287
For what?

391
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:36,328
The right partner.

392
00:30:50,878 --> 00:30:52,277
This way.

393
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,915
- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.

394
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:13,960
Wonderful weather this morning,
isn't it?

395
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:16,298
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

396
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:15,451
Good morning.

397
00:32:16,697 --> 00:32:18,324
Please, not now.

398
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,296
Are you ready?

399
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:29,934
Good. Take off your shirt, your tie,
and your hat.

400
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:37,276
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

401
00:32:37,384 --> 00:32:38,976
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

402
00:32:39,086 --> 00:32:40,951
We needed access to
the city's power grid.

403
00:32:41,055 --> 00:32:43,182
Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...

404
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:45,451
A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.

405
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:46,958
This is...

406
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:48,722
Fred Clemson, State Department.

407
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:50,296
If this project of yours comes through,

408
00:32:50,397 --> 00:32:53,025
we'd like to see it used
for something other than headlines.

409
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:56,864
Jesus. Somebody get that kid
a sandwich.

410
00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:10,942
Comfortable?

411
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:14,179
It's a little big.

412
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:18,081
You save me any of that schnapps?

413
00:33:19,093 --> 00:33:21,960
Not as much as I should have. Sorry.

414
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:23,660
Next time.

415
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:26,859
Mr. Stark, how are your levels?

416
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:29,197
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.

417
00:33:29,303 --> 00:33:31,271
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

418
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:34,537
but we are ready as we'll ever be.

419
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:36,566
Agent Carter?

420
00:33:36,677 --> 00:33:38,941
Don't you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

421
00:33:39,046 --> 00:33:40,638
- Yes, of course. Sorry.
- Good.

422
00:33:53,494 --> 00:33:54,859
<i>Do you hear me? Is this on?</i>

423
00:33:55,863 --> 00:33:56,955
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

424
00:33:57,698 --> 00:34:01,134
<i>today we take not another step
towards annihilation,</i>

425
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:02,762
<i>but the first step</i>

426
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:05,162
<i>on the path to peace.</i>

427
00:34:07,508 --> 00:34:10,568
<i>We begin with a series
of microinjections into</i>

428
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:14,444
<i>the subject's major muscle groups.
The serum infusion</i>

429
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:17,613
<i>will cause immediate cellular change.</i>

430
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:21,154
<i>And then, to stimulate growth,</i>

431
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:24,756
<i>the subject will be
saturated with Vita-Rays.</i>

432
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:33,591
That wasn't so bad.

433
00:34:34,268 --> 00:34:35,565
That was penicillin.

434
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:41,401
Serum infusion beginning in

435
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:42,798
five,

436
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:44,866
<i>four,</i>

437
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:47,302
three,

438
00:34:48,749 --> 00:34:50,239
two,

439
00:34:51,685 --> 00:34:52,674
one.

440
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:04,594
Now, Mr. Stark.

441
00:35:28,022 --> 00:35:30,991
Steven? Can you hear me?

442
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:34,553
It's probably too late
to go to the bathroom, right?

443
00:35:35,996 --> 00:35:37,691
We will proceed.

444
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:51,233
That's 10%.

445
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:53,402
Twenty percent.

446
00:35:53,814 --> 00:35:54,940
Thirty.

447
00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:58,642
<i>That's 40%.</i>

448
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:01,143
Vital signs are normal.

449
00:36:01,388 --> 00:36:02,377
That's 50%.

450
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,179
Sixty.

451
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:07,155
Seventy.

452
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:12,754
Steven!

453
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,300
- Steven!
- Shut it down!

454
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:17,661
Shut it down!

455
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:19,498
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark!

456
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,298
Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!

457
00:36:21,408 --> 00:36:22,705
No!

458
00:36:23,143 --> 00:36:25,703
Don't! I can do this!

459
00:36:32,653 --> 00:36:33,677
Eighty.

460
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:35,377
Ninety.

461
00:36:36,824 --> 00:36:38,758
That's 100%.

462
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,280
Mr. Stark?

463
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,060
Steven. Steven.

464
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:19,128
The son of a bitch did it.

465
00:37:25,606 --> 00:37:26,937
- I did it.
- Yeah, yeah.

466
00:37:27,708 --> 00:37:28,766
I think we did it.

467
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:30,069
You actually did it.

468
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:35,639
How do you feel?

469
00:37:38,552 --> 00:37:40,076
Taller.

470
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,421
You look taller.

471
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:46,318
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

472
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,628
I can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

473
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,294
Congratulations, Doctor.

474
00:37:55,402 --> 00:37:57,063
Thank you, sir.

475
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:09,782
Stop him!

476
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,410
What are you doing?
Buddy, are you all right?

477
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:18,143
Hey, this guy's been shot!

478
00:39:29,396 --> 00:39:30,385
I had him!

479
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,691
Sorry!

480
00:39:52,552 --> 00:39:53,917
I'm sorry!

481
00:41:06,426 --> 00:41:09,054
No! No! Not my son!

482
00:41:09,996 --> 00:41:11,463
- Stop it!
- Don't hurt him!

483
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:14,729
Get back!

484
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:17,234
Let me go!

485
00:41:20,307 --> 00:41:21,672
Let go of my son!

486
00:41:24,378 --> 00:41:25,640
Don't hurt him!

487
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:31,711
Wait, don't! Don't!

488
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:34,511
No! Don't!

489
00:41:40,594 --> 00:41:42,562
Go get him! I can swim!

490
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:37,076
- Who the hell are you?
- The first of many.

491
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:39,180
Cut off one head,

492
00:42:41,188 --> 00:42:43,053
two more shall take its place.

493
00:42:45,492 --> 00:42:47,357
Hail Hydra.

494
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,208
<i>The Führer is not accustomed
to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.</i>

495
00:43:09,316 --> 00:43:12,217
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

496
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,219
You serve at his pleasure.

497
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:17,188
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

498
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,781
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

499
00:43:19,926 --> 00:43:22,554
I no longer reflect his image
of Aryan perfection.

500
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:25,062
You think this is about appearances?

501
00:43:25,165 --> 00:43:29,568
Your Hydra division has failed to deliver
so much as a rifle in over a year.

502
00:43:29,669 --> 00:43:32,069
And we had learned
through local intelligence

503
00:43:32,172 --> 00:43:35,232
you had mounted a full-scale incursion
into Norway.

504
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:37,242
<i>The Führer feels... How does he put it?</i>

505
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:40,575
"The Red Skull has been indulged
long enough!"

506
00:43:52,626 --> 00:43:54,093
Gentlemen,

507
00:43:56,696 --> 00:44:00,154
you have come to see
the results of our work.

508
00:44:01,468 --> 00:44:02,765
Let me show you.

509
00:44:04,471 --> 00:44:07,099
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,

510
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:09,107
but he cannot feed his armies
for a month.

511
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:12,542
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

512
00:44:12,646 --> 00:44:16,673
but still he is no closer to
achieving his goals.

513
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:20,313
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

514
00:44:21,054 --> 00:44:24,854
Science. But I understand
your confusion.

515
00:44:25,325 --> 00:44:28,123
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

516
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:32,491
Hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

517
00:44:32,732 --> 00:44:36,031
wherever they are, regardless of
how many forces they possess,

518
00:44:36,136 --> 00:44:37,228
all in a matter of hours.

519
00:44:37,571 --> 00:44:38,868
Your enemies?

520
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:41,600
My weapons contain
enough destructive power

521
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:44,336
to decimate
every hostile capital on Earth.

522
00:44:46,846 --> 00:44:48,473
Quite simply, gentlemen,

523
00:44:49,416 --> 00:44:51,907
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

524
00:44:53,954 --> 00:44:55,012
Thank you, Schmidt.

525
00:44:55,121 --> 00:44:56,088
For what?

526
00:44:56,556 --> 00:44:59,787
For making it clear
how obviously mad you are.

527
00:44:59,893 --> 00:45:01,292
Berlin is on this map!

528
00:45:02,228 --> 00:45:03,752
So it is.

529
00:45:05,865 --> 00:45:08,459
You will be punished for your insolence!

530
00:45:08,568 --> 00:45:11,093
<i>You will be brought
before the Führer himself!</i>

531
00:45:20,313 --> 00:45:22,281
Schmidt...

532
00:45:27,253 --> 00:45:29,187
My apologies, Doctor,

533
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:34,249
but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in Hitler's shadow.

534
00:45:35,629 --> 00:45:36,653
Hail Hydra.

535
00:45:37,464 --> 00:45:39,159
Hail Hydra!

536
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,499
Hail Hydra!

537
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,742
Think you got enough?

538
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:04,416
Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.

539
00:46:05,058 --> 00:46:07,686
But without Dr. Erskine,
it would take years.

540
00:46:09,029 --> 00:46:10,724
He deserved more than this.

541
00:46:12,132 --> 00:46:15,590
If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.

542
00:46:18,505 --> 00:46:21,406
Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.

543
00:46:21,808 --> 00:46:23,332
Great. Why don't we start with how

544
00:46:23,443 --> 00:46:26,606
a German spy got a ride to
my secret installation in your car?

545
00:46:26,713 --> 00:46:28,203
What have we got here?

546
00:46:28,314 --> 00:46:31,340
Speaking modestly, I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

547
00:46:31,685 --> 00:46:34,347
But I don't know what's inside this thing
or how it works.

548
00:46:34,821 --> 00:46:36,288
We're not even close to this technology.

549
00:46:36,389 --> 00:46:38,016
- Then who is?
- Hydra.

550
00:46:38,658 --> 00:46:40,023
I'm sure you've been
reading our briefings.

551
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,551
I'm on a number of
committees, Colonel.

552
00:46:42,662 --> 00:46:44,857
Hydra is the Nazi deep-science division.

553
00:46:44,964 --> 00:46:48,559
It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.

554
00:46:48,668 --> 00:46:49,862
Hydra is practically a cult.

555
00:46:49,969 --> 00:46:51,561
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.

556
00:46:52,072 --> 00:46:53,232
So, what are you going to do about it?

557
00:46:54,307 --> 00:46:55,535
I spoke to the President this morning.

558
00:46:56,042 --> 00:46:59,068
- As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
- Colonel?

559
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:02,478
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

560
00:47:02,582 --> 00:47:03,879
You, too, Stark.

561
00:47:04,284 --> 00:47:05,911
We're flying to London tonight.

562
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:08,317
Sir? If you're going after Schmidt,
I want in.

563
00:47:08,621 --> 00:47:10,589
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.

564
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:12,249
The serum worked.

565
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:14,155
I asked for an army
and all I got was you.

566
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:17,355
You are not enough.

567
00:47:21,534 --> 00:47:22,831
With all due respect to the Colonel,

568
00:47:23,503 --> 00:47:25,300
I think we may be missing the point.

569
00:47:25,672 --> 00:47:29,972
I've seen you in action, Steve.
More importantly, the country's seen it.

570
00:47:30,343 --> 00:47:31,310
Paper.

571
00:47:32,278 --> 00:47:33,973
The enlistment lines
have been around the block

572
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,911
since your picture hit the newsstands.

573
00:47:36,783 --> 00:47:39,877
You don't take a soldier,
a symbol like that,

574
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,915
and hide him in a lab.

575
00:47:42,489 --> 00:47:46,391
Son, do you want to serve your country

576
00:47:46,493 --> 00:47:49,462
on the most important battlefield
of the war?

577
00:47:50,764 --> 00:47:52,755
Sir, that's all I want.

578
00:47:53,366 --> 00:47:56,767
Then, congratulations.
You just got promoted.

579
00:47:59,906 --> 00:48:01,100
I don't know if I can do this.

580
00:48:01,207 --> 00:48:05,837
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.

581
00:48:06,246 --> 00:48:07,770
You're an American hero.

582
00:48:08,014 --> 00:48:10,175
It's just not how I pictured getting there.

583
00:48:10,817 --> 00:48:12,876
The Senator has got
a lot of pull up on the Hill.

584
00:48:12,986 --> 00:48:14,112
You play ball with us,

585
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,154
you'll be leading your own platoon
in no time.

586
00:48:16,256 --> 00:48:17,746
Take the shield.

587
00:48:19,092 --> 00:48:20,150
Go.

588
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:26,158
<i>Who's strong and brave
Here to save the American way?</i>

589
00:48:27,433 --> 00:48:30,163
Not all of us can storm a beach
or drive a tank.

590
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,965
But there's still a way all of us can fight.

591
00:48:32,071 --> 00:48:36,735
<i>Who vows to fight like a man
For what's right, night and day?</i>

592
00:48:37,143 --> 00:48:38,735
Series E Defense Bonds.

593
00:48:38,845 --> 00:48:42,542
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

594
00:48:42,682 --> 00:48:46,140
<i>Who will campaign door-to-door
for America?</i>

595
00:48:46,252 --> 00:48:49,517
<i>Carry the flag shore to shore
for America?</i>

596
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:52,682
<i>From Hoboken to Spokane</i>

597
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:58,788
<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

598
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:03,897
Cut. Guys, don't look at the camera.

599
00:49:04,037 --> 00:49:08,030
<i>We can't ignore there's a threat
and a war we must win</i>

600
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:10,939
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

601
00:49:11,044 --> 00:49:16,505
<i>Who'll hang a noose on the
goose-stepping goons from Berlin?</i>

602
00:49:17,984 --> 00:49:21,283
<i>Who will redeem
Heed the call for America?</i>

603
00:49:21,521 --> 00:49:24,581
<i>Who'll rise or fall
Give his all for America?</i>

604
00:49:25,158 --> 00:49:27,991
<i>Who's here to prove that we can?</i>

605
00:49:28,094 --> 00:49:34,158
<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

606
00:49:34,634 --> 00:49:36,932
We all know this is about
trying to win the war.

607
00:49:37,036 --> 00:49:40,199
We can't do that without bullets
and bandages, tanks and tents.

608
00:49:40,306 --> 00:49:42,501
That's where you come in.
Every bond you buy

609
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:43,837
will help protect someone you love.

610
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,810
- Turn around! He's right behind you!
- Keep our boys armed and ready,

611
00:49:46,913 --> 00:49:49,643
and the Germans will think twice about
trying to get the drop on us.

612
00:49:53,553 --> 00:49:59,253
<i>Stalwart and steady and true</i>

613
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:03,696
<i>Forceful and ready to defend</i>

614
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:07,596
<i>the red, white, and blue</i>

615
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,037
<i>Who'll give the Axis the sack
and is smart as a fox?</i>

616
00:50:11,037 --> 00:50:11,594
<i>Who'll give the Axis the sack
and is smart as a fox?</i>

617
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:14,969
<i>Far as an eagle will soar</i>

618
00:50:15,074 --> 00:50:18,703
<i>Who's making Adolf
afraid to step out of his box?</i>

619
00:50:18,811 --> 00:50:21,746
<i>He knows what we're fighting for</i>

620
00:50:21,915 --> 00:50:25,282
<i>Who waked the giant
that napped in America?</i>

621
00:50:25,385 --> 00:50:28,821
<i>We know it's no one
but Captain America</i>

622
00:50:29,555 --> 00:50:30,522
Hi.

623
00:50:30,623 --> 00:50:32,420
<i>Who'll finish what they began?</i>

624
00:50:32,525 --> 00:50:39,397
<i>Who'll kick the Krauts to Japan?
The star-spangled man</i>

625
00:50:39,499 --> 00:50:42,263
<i>with a</i>

626
00:50:43,036 --> 00:50:45,834
<i>plan!</i>

627
00:50:53,813 --> 00:50:57,681
<i>How many of you are ready to
help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?</i>

628
00:51:02,388 --> 00:51:03,514
<i>Okay.</i>

629
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:08,492
<i>I need a volunteer.</i>

630
00:51:08,594 --> 00:51:10,789
I already volunteered!
How do you think I got here?

631
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:14,323
Bring back the girls!

632
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:20,669
<i>I think they only know the one song, but</i>

633
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:22,874
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

634
00:51:23,209 --> 00:51:24,870
You do that, sweetheart.

635
00:51:25,378 --> 00:51:28,006
Nice boots, Tinker Bell!

636
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:31,448
<i>Come on, guys,
we're all on the same team here.</i>

637
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:33,812
Hey, Captain! Sign this!

638
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:46,529
Bring back the girls!

639
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,798
Don't worry, pal. They'll warm up to you.
Don't worry.

640
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:03,546
Hello, Steve.

641
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:06,043
Hi.

642
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,315
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

643
00:52:09,422 --> 00:52:11,617
Officially, I'm not here at all.

644
00:52:12,091 --> 00:52:13,991
That was quite a performance.

645
00:52:14,394 --> 00:52:15,361
Yeah.

646
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:18,223
I had to improvise a little bit.

647
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:21,066
The crowds I'm used to
are usually more

648
00:52:22,668 --> 00:52:23,635
twelve.

649
00:52:23,736 --> 00:52:25,670
I understand you're
"America's New Hope."

650
00:52:25,772 --> 00:52:28,332
Bond sales take a 10% bump
in every state I visit.

651
00:52:28,441 --> 00:52:29,965
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

652
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:33,670
At least he's got me doing this.

653
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,304
Phillips would have had me
stuck in a lab.

654
00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:38,083
And these are your only two options?

655
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:40,749
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

656
00:52:41,454 --> 00:52:44,082
You were meant for more than this,
you know.

657
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:50,986
What?

658
00:52:52,365 --> 00:52:55,198
You know, for the longest time,
I dreamed about

659
00:52:55,802 --> 00:52:59,101
coming overseas
and being on the front lines,

660
00:52:59,472 --> 00:53:00,939
serving my country.

661
00:53:01,808 --> 00:53:03,776
I finally got everything I wanted

662
00:53:07,313 --> 00:53:08,337
and I'm wearing tights.

663
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:18,456
They look like they've been through hell.

664
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:20,486
These men more than most.

665
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:29,290
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.
Two hundred men went up against him,

666
00:53:30,169 --> 00:53:32,296
and less than 50 returned.

667
00:53:33,206 --> 00:53:35,606
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

668
00:53:36,509 --> 00:53:38,374
The rest were killed or captured.

669
00:53:38,578 --> 00:53:40,170
The 107th?

670
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:41,246
What?

671
00:53:41,714 --> 00:53:43,045
Come on.

672
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,117
Colonel Phillips.

673
00:53:45,218 --> 00:53:47,049
Well, if it isn't
the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.

674
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:48,415
What's your plan today?

675
00:53:48,588 --> 00:53:49,748
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

676
00:53:49,856 --> 00:53:51,153
You don't get to give me orders, son.

677
00:53:51,257 --> 00:53:54,385
I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

678
00:53:54,994 --> 00:53:57,485
You and I are gonna have a
conversation later that you won't enjoy.

679
00:53:57,597 --> 00:54:00,691
- Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...
- I can spell.

680
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:11,199
I have signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.

681
00:54:11,544 --> 00:54:13,603
But the name does sound familiar.

682
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:15,237
I'm sorry.

683
00:54:19,452 --> 00:54:21,886
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?

684
00:54:22,221 --> 00:54:23,518
Yes, it's called "winning the war."

685
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:26,547
But if you know where they are,
why not at least...

686
00:54:26,659 --> 00:54:28,388
They're 30 miles behind the lines

687
00:54:28,528 --> 00:54:31,292
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

688
00:54:31,397 --> 00:54:32,864
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

689
00:54:32,965 --> 00:54:35,627
But I don't expect you to understand that
because you're a chorus girl.

690
00:54:37,904 --> 00:54:39,303
I think I understand just fine.

691
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:41,466
Well, then understand it
somewhere else.

692
00:54:41,807 --> 00:54:46,005
If I read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

693
00:54:50,883 --> 00:54:53,511
Yes, sir. I do.

694
00:54:57,623 --> 00:55:02,617
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

695
00:55:05,865 --> 00:55:07,730
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

696
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:09,232
If that's what it takes.

697
00:55:09,335 --> 00:55:11,428
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

698
00:55:11,537 --> 00:55:12,504
You don't know that.

699
00:55:12,605 --> 00:55:14,573
Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects...

700
00:55:14,674 --> 00:55:17,472
By the time he's done that,
it could be too late.

701
00:55:17,577 --> 00:55:18,601
Steve!

702
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:29,180
You told me you thought I was meant
for more than this. Did you mean that?

703
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,187
Every word.

704
00:55:33,926 --> 00:55:34,915
Then you got to let me go.

705
00:55:38,531 --> 00:55:40,328
I can do more than that.

706
00:55:40,733 --> 00:55:43,702
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

707
00:55:45,204 --> 00:55:46,466
Where's my helmet?

708
00:55:46,572 --> 00:55:47,971
Anyone seen Rogers?

709
00:55:51,911 --> 00:55:53,879
<i>The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,</i>

710
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,971
tucked between
these two mountain ranges.

711
00:55:56,082 --> 00:55:57,140
It's a factory of some kind.

712
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,480
We should be able to
drop you right on the doorstep.

713
00:55:59,585 --> 00:56:01,280
Just get me as close as you can.

714
00:56:01,387 --> 00:56:03,048
You two are gonna be
in a lot of trouble when you land.

715
00:56:03,155 --> 00:56:04,122
And you won't?

716
00:56:04,223 --> 00:56:06,691
Where I'm going, if anybody yells at me,
I can just shoot them.

717
00:56:06,792 --> 00:56:08,419
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

718
00:56:08,527 --> 00:56:10,495
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

719
00:56:10,596 --> 00:56:11,620
Agent Carter?

720
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:13,028
If we're not in too much of a hurry,

721
00:56:13,132 --> 00:56:16,659
I thought we could stop off in Lucerne
for a late-night fondue.

722
00:56:21,941 --> 00:56:24,739
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I've ever seen.

723
00:56:25,011 --> 00:56:27,479
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.

724
00:56:29,248 --> 00:56:31,011
So, are you two... Do you...

725
00:56:33,452 --> 00:56:34,578
...fondue?

726
00:56:35,788 --> 00:56:37,949
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready

727
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,490
and the signal will lead us
straight to you.

728
00:56:41,594 --> 00:56:43,459
Are you sure this thing works?

729
00:56:43,562 --> 00:56:45,826
It's been tested more than you, pal.

730
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:53,495
Get back here!
We're taking you all the way in!

731
00:56:55,308 --> 00:56:58,277
As soon as I'm clear, you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here!

732
00:56:58,544 --> 00:57:00,512
You can't give me orders!

733
00:57:00,813 --> 00:57:03,441
The hell I can't! I'm a Captain!

734
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:26,104
<i>As you can see, production of
the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule,</i>

735
00:57:26,205 --> 00:57:28,503
even with components of this size.

736
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:31,537
Increase the output by 60%

737
00:57:31,844 --> 00:57:35,473
and see to it our other facilities
do the same.

738
00:57:36,015 --> 00:57:40,315
But these prisoners,
I'm not sure they have the strength.

739
00:57:40,686 --> 00:57:43,655
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

740
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:46,988
There are always more workers.

741
00:57:49,028 --> 00:57:50,154
Not now!

742
00:58:05,544 --> 00:58:07,341
You know, Fritz,

743
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:10,679
one of these days,
I'm gonna have a stick of my own.

744
00:58:43,816 --> 00:58:44,942
Fellas.

745
01:00:46,539 --> 01:00:47,836
Who are you supposed to be?

746
01:00:48,207 --> 01:00:51,472
I'm Captain America.

747
01:00:52,745 --> 01:00:54,178
I beg your pardon?

748
01:00:57,616 --> 01:00:59,413
What, are we taking everybody?

749
01:00:59,785 --> 01:01:01,343
I'm from Fresno, Ace.

750
01:01:01,554 --> 01:01:04,284
Is there anybody else? I'm looking
for a Sergeant James Barnes.

751
01:01:04,623 --> 01:01:07,592
There's an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.

752
01:01:07,693 --> 01:01:08,785
All right.

753
01:01:08,894 --> 01:01:10,919
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

754
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:13,225
Get out fast and give 'em hell.

755
01:01:13,332 --> 01:01:15,027
I'll meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else I find.

756
01:01:15,134 --> 01:01:17,659
Wait. You know what you're doing?

757
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:20,603
Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler
over 200 times.

758
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:47,360
You know how to use that thing?

759
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:52,337
Okay.

760
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:56,140
What is happening?

761
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:06,418
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.

762
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,854
<i>- That one. "Zündung."
- Zündung?</i>

763
01:02:10,789 --> 01:02:11,756
Get this thing going, Dugan!

764
01:02:11,857 --> 01:02:13,188
I didn't know you spoke German.

765
01:02:13,292 --> 01:02:16,489
Three semesters at Howard,
switched to French, girls much cuter.

766
01:02:16,595 --> 01:02:17,562
Didn't ask for the resume.

767
01:02:30,342 --> 01:02:31,707
- On your left!
- Up top!

768
01:02:49,328 --> 01:02:51,626
No, no! What are you doing?

769
01:02:52,731 --> 01:02:55,700
Our forces are outmatched.

770
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:23,055
Keep moving! Grab those grenades!

771
01:04:02,668 --> 01:04:05,660
Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.

772
01:04:06,772 --> 01:04:07,739
Bucky?

773
01:04:08,874 --> 01:04:09,841
Oh, my God.

774
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,447
- Is that...
- It's me.

775
01:04:16,682 --> 01:04:18,513
- It's Steve.
- Steve?

776
01:04:18,617 --> 01:04:20,050
- Come on.
- Steve.

777
01:04:24,223 --> 01:04:25,349
I thought you were dead.

778
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:27,656
I thought you were smaller.

779
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:36,625
Come on.

780
01:04:39,071 --> 01:04:41,869
- What happened to you?
- I joined the Army.

781
01:04:48,247 --> 01:04:50,306
- Did it hurt?
- A little.

782
01:04:50,749 --> 01:04:52,046
Is this permanent?

783
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:53,309
So far.

784
01:05:23,348 --> 01:05:24,975
Captain America!

785
01:05:25,203 --> 01:05:26,830
How exciting!

786
01:05:27,372 --> 01:05:30,341
I am a great fan of your films!

787
01:05:32,043 --> 01:05:36,002
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.

788
01:05:36,381 --> 01:05:38,178
Not exactly an improvement,

789
01:05:38,283 --> 01:05:41,582
but still, impressive.

790
01:05:44,389 --> 01:05:45,856
You've got no idea.

791
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,018
Haven't I?

792
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:08,702
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

793
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,177
you see, I was his greatest success!

794
01:06:25,664 --> 01:06:27,461
You don't have one of those, do you?

795
01:06:27,766 --> 01:06:30,064
You are deluded, Captain.

796
01:06:30,769 --> 01:06:33,397
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

797
01:06:33,505 --> 01:06:35,905
but in reality, you are just afraid

798
01:06:36,007 --> 01:06:39,636
to admit that
we have left humanity behind.

799
01:06:41,446 --> 01:06:44,142
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.

800
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,408
Without fear!

801
01:06:46,685 --> 01:06:47,982
Then how come you're running?

802
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:02,123
Come on, let's go. Up.

803
01:07:05,103 --> 01:07:07,435
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

804
01:07:10,976 --> 01:07:12,273
What about me?

805
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,307
Where will I sit?

806
01:07:14,946 --> 01:07:16,641
Not a scratch, Doctor.

807
01:07:16,815 --> 01:07:18,282
Not a scratch.

808
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:53,510
Let's go. One at a time.

809
01:08:22,213 --> 01:08:25,182
- Gotta be a rope or something!
- Just go! Get out of here!

810
01:08:25,283 --> 01:08:26,648
No! Not without you!

811
01:08:27,585 --> 01:08:28,882
Hell.

812
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:53,408
Senator Brandt, I regret to report that

813
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:58,312
Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing
behind enemy lines on the third.

814
01:08:58,416 --> 01:09:00,543
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

815
01:09:00,652 --> 01:09:04,611
As a result,
I must declare Captain Rogers

816
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:07,617
killed in action. Period.

817
01:09:11,663 --> 01:09:13,392
The last surveillance flight is back.

818
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:17,802
No sign of activity.

819
01:09:18,603 --> 01:09:21,367
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

820
01:09:24,009 --> 01:09:25,135
I can't touch Stark.

821
01:09:25,276 --> 01:09:28,074
He's rich and he's the Army's
number one weapons contractor.

822
01:09:28,179 --> 01:09:29,669
You are neither one.

823
01:09:29,781 --> 01:09:32,249
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.

824
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:34,011
And I don't think
Captain Rogers did, either.

825
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:36,917
What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?

826
01:09:37,022 --> 01:09:38,819
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

827
01:09:38,923 --> 01:09:42,484
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead

828
01:09:42,594 --> 01:09:43,561
'cause you had a crush.

829
01:09:43,661 --> 01:09:45,993
It wasn't that. I had faith.

830
01:09:46,531 --> 01:09:51,093
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.

831
01:09:53,638 --> 01:09:54,935
What the hell's going on out there?

832
01:10:37,882 --> 01:10:39,645
Look who it is!

833
01:11:06,811 --> 01:11:08,938
Some of these men
need medical attention.

834
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:10,947
- Medic, we got wounded.
- Right over here.

835
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:13,609
I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

836
01:11:15,053 --> 01:11:16,680
That won't be necessary.

837
01:11:20,558 --> 01:11:21,786
Yes, sir.

838
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:24,828
Faith, huh?

839
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:32,831
You're late.

840
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:38,369
Couldn't call my ride.

841
01:11:40,678 --> 01:11:42,111
Hey!

842
01:11:42,413 --> 01:11:44,040
Let's hear it for Captain America!

843
01:12:01,065 --> 01:12:04,364
<i>I am honored
to present this medal for valor</i>

844
01:12:04,502 --> 01:12:08,097
to my personal friend, Captain America!

845
01:12:10,742 --> 01:12:12,369
Captain America!

846
01:12:13,978 --> 01:12:15,946
Captain, that's your cue!

847
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:21,776
I thought he'd be taller.

848
01:12:33,798 --> 01:12:36,858
The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.

849
01:12:36,968 --> 01:12:39,095
And the sixth one was

850
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:44,597
about here, 30, 40 miles west
of the Maginot Line.

851
01:12:46,411 --> 01:12:48,276
I just got a quick look.

852
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,948
Well, nobody's perfect.

853
01:12:54,252 --> 01:12:56,618
These are the weapon factories
we know about.

854
01:12:57,088 --> 01:12:58,919
Sergeant Barnes said
that Hydra shipped

855
01:12:59,023 --> 01:13:01,548
all the parts to another facility
that isn't on this map.

856
01:13:01,659 --> 01:13:03,286
Agent Carter, coordinate with Ml6.

857
01:13:03,394 --> 01:13:06,056
I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

858
01:13:06,164 --> 01:13:07,188
What about us?

859
01:13:07,298 --> 01:13:10,062
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.

860
01:13:10,168 --> 01:13:12,136
What do you say, Rogers? It's your map.

861
01:13:12,237 --> 01:13:15,832
- You think you can wipe Hydra off it?
- Yes, sir. I'll need a team.

862
01:13:16,274 --> 01:13:18,299
We're already putting together
the best men.

863
01:13:18,676 --> 01:13:21,474
With all due respect, sir, so am I.

864
01:13:22,847 --> 01:13:24,212
So, let's get this straight.

865
01:13:24,315 --> 01:13:26,306
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

866
01:13:28,052 --> 01:13:29,280
Pretty much.

867
01:13:29,387 --> 01:13:31,685
Sounds rather fun, actually.

868
01:13:33,391 --> 01:13:34,358
I'm in.

869
01:13:47,038 --> 01:13:48,335
We're in.

870
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:52,537
Hell, I'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.

871
01:13:52,644 --> 01:13:53,633
What's that?

872
01:13:55,813 --> 01:13:56,837
Open a tab.

873
01:14:00,718 --> 01:14:02,185
Well, that was easy.

874
01:14:02,553 --> 01:14:04,987
- Another round.
- Where are they putting all this stuff?

875
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:11,187
See? I told you.

876
01:14:11,829 --> 01:14:13,797
They're all idiots.

877
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,696
How about you?

878
01:14:16,501 --> 01:14:19,527
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

879
01:14:19,837 --> 01:14:20,963
Hell, no.

880
01:14:21,072 --> 01:14:25,532
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

881
01:14:26,744 --> 01:14:28,371
I'm following him.

882
01:14:31,916 --> 01:14:33,281
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

883
01:14:36,254 --> 01:14:37,380
You know what?

884
01:14:38,556 --> 01:14:39,682
It's kind of growing on me.

885
01:14:51,169 --> 01:14:52,568
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.

886
01:14:55,306 --> 01:14:56,273
Ma'am.

887
01:14:56,374 --> 01:14:59,343
Howard has some equipment for you
to try. Tomorrow morning?

888
01:14:59,444 --> 01:15:00,741
Sounds good.

889
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:08,146
I see your top squad
is prepping for duty.

890
01:15:08,619 --> 01:15:09,586
You don't like music?

891
01:15:09,687 --> 01:15:11,052
I do, actually.

892
01:15:12,857 --> 01:15:16,315
I might even,
when this is all over, go dancing.

893
01:15:16,694 --> 01:15:17,991
Then what are we waiting for?

894
01:15:18,963 --> 01:15:20,487
The right partner.

895
01:15:21,632 --> 01:15:22,929
0800, Captain.

896
01:15:24,135 --> 01:15:26,433
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

897
01:15:26,804 --> 01:15:28,328
I'm invisible.

898
01:15:28,873 --> 01:15:31,933
I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.

899
01:15:32,543 --> 01:15:35,603
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.

900
01:15:37,315 --> 01:15:39,943
Emission signature is unusual.

901
01:15:40,485 --> 01:15:42,453
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

902
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:46,288
Though I doubt
Rogers picked up on that.

903
01:15:47,992 --> 01:15:49,289
Seems harmless enough.

904
01:15:50,661 --> 01:15:52,526
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

905
01:16:02,073 --> 01:16:03,370
Write that down.

906
01:16:05,343 --> 01:16:08,039
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Stark.

907
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:10,205
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

908
01:16:15,019 --> 01:16:17,817
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

909
01:16:25,229 --> 01:16:26,560
I read about what you did.

910
01:16:26,931 --> 01:16:28,558
Oh, the... Yeah.

911
01:16:29,367 --> 01:16:30,891
Well, that's, you know.

912
01:16:32,537 --> 01:16:33,936
Just doing what needed to be done.

913
01:16:34,272 --> 01:16:37,105
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

914
01:16:43,448 --> 01:16:45,416
Really, it's not a big deal.

915
01:16:46,317 --> 01:16:48,444
Tell that to their wives.

916
01:16:51,823 --> 01:16:53,415
I don't think they were all married.

917
01:16:53,624 --> 01:16:55,182
You're a hero.

918
01:16:55,293 --> 01:16:57,784
Well, that depends
on the definition, really.

919
01:16:57,895 --> 01:17:01,194
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

920
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,335
And seeing as they're not here...

921
01:17:14,011 --> 01:17:15,000
Captain!

922
01:17:15,112 --> 01:17:17,740
We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.

923
01:17:18,883 --> 01:17:20,350
Agent Carter, wait.

924
01:17:20,651 --> 01:17:22,778
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

925
01:17:22,887 --> 01:17:24,479
Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.

926
01:17:24,589 --> 01:17:27,183
I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

927
01:17:27,492 --> 01:17:31,121
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are, just like all the rest.

928
01:17:31,395 --> 01:17:32,487
Well, what about you and Stark?

929
01:17:32,597 --> 01:17:35,065
How do I know you two
haven't been fondue-ing?

930
01:17:40,004 --> 01:17:42,302
You still don't know
a bloody thing about women.

931
01:17:43,908 --> 01:17:45,899
<i>Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.</i>

932
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:48,808
- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.

933
01:17:48,913 --> 01:17:50,904
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head

934
01:17:51,015 --> 01:17:53,381
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

935
01:17:53,484 --> 01:17:56,146
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment

936
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:59,087
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

937
01:17:59,357 --> 01:18:01,052
Carbon polymer.

938
01:18:01,726 --> 01:18:04,092
Should withstand
your average German bayonet.

939
01:18:04,195 --> 01:18:07,653
Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.

940
01:18:08,032 --> 01:18:10,762
I hear you're kind of attached.

941
01:18:10,868 --> 01:18:12,267
It's handier than you might think.

942
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:14,497
I took the liberty
of coming up with some options.

943
01:18:15,206 --> 01:18:16,230
This one's fun.

944
01:18:17,074 --> 01:18:19,599
She's been fitted with electrical relays
that allow you to...

945
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:21,268
- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.

946
01:18:21,379 --> 01:18:23,506
- What's it made of?
- Vibranium.

947
01:18:24,615 --> 01:18:27,243
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

948
01:18:27,885 --> 01:18:30,683
It's completely vibration absorbent.

949
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:34,248
How come it's not standard issue?

950
01:18:34,358 --> 01:18:35,689
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

951
01:18:35,793 --> 01:18:37,454
What you're holding there,
that's all we've got.

952
01:18:37,562 --> 01:18:39,757
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

953
01:18:39,864 --> 01:18:41,695
I'm sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

954
01:18:41,799 --> 01:18:43,699
What do you think?

955
01:18:53,578 --> 01:18:55,546
Yes, I think it works.

956
01:19:04,855 --> 01:19:06,982
I had some ideas about the uniform.

957
01:19:07,258 --> 01:19:08,748
Whatever you want, pal.

958
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:15,783
You are failing!

959
01:21:16,687 --> 01:21:19,952
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,

960
01:21:20,057 --> 01:21:21,991
yet we are continually delayed

961
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:24,755
because you cannot outwit
a simpleton with a shield!

962
01:21:24,862 --> 01:21:26,830
This is hardly my area of expertise.

963
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:30,628
I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.

964
01:21:31,936 --> 01:21:35,201
Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.

965
01:21:35,973 --> 01:21:36,962
Sir!

966
01:21:39,276 --> 01:21:40,300
<i>I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.</i>

967
01:21:41,879 --> 01:21:43,676
We fought to the last man.

968
01:21:46,984 --> 01:21:48,952
Evidently not.

969
01:22:01,165 --> 01:22:04,362
Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?

970
01:22:04,468 --> 01:22:06,095
Yeah, and I threw up?

971
01:22:07,438 --> 01:22:08,905
This isn't payback, is it?

972
01:22:09,006 --> 01:22:10,735
Now why would I do that?

973
01:22:10,841 --> 01:22:13,571
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.

974
01:22:13,677 --> 01:22:17,204
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

975
01:22:17,314 --> 01:22:19,214
Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.

976
01:22:26,323 --> 01:22:28,689
Let's get going,
because they're moving like the devil.

977
01:22:29,326 --> 01:22:31,021
We only got about a 10-second window.

978
01:22:31,128 --> 01:22:33,688
You miss that window,
we're bugs on a windshield.

979
01:22:34,331 --> 01:22:35,298
Mind the gap.

980
01:22:35,399 --> 01:22:37,264
Better get moving, bugs!

981
01:23:45,102 --> 01:23:47,195
Stop him! Fire again!

982
01:24:39,823 --> 01:24:42,383
- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.

983
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:44,084
Get down!

984
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:47,661
Fire again!

985
01:24:48,432 --> 01:24:49,956
<i>Kill him! Now!</i>

986
01:24:57,241 --> 01:24:58,208
Bucky!

987
01:25:02,313 --> 01:25:03,746
Hang on!

988
01:25:05,482 --> 01:25:06,449
Grab my hand!

989
01:26:12,049 --> 01:26:13,346
Sit down.

990
01:26:19,823 --> 01:26:22,121
- What is this?
- Steak.

991
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,186
What is in it?

992
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:26,626
Cow.

993
01:26:29,733 --> 01:26:32,725
Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is

994
01:26:32,836 --> 01:26:35,634
to get ahold of a prime cut like that
out here?

995
01:26:37,074 --> 01:26:38,473
I don't eat meat.

996
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:40,536
Why not?

997
01:26:40,644 --> 01:26:42,305
It disagrees with me.

998
01:26:42,413 --> 01:26:45,314
How about cyanide? Does that give you
the rumbly tummy, too?

999
01:26:48,252 --> 01:26:51,415
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive

1000
01:26:51,522 --> 01:26:56,323
has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.

1001
01:26:57,361 --> 01:27:00,159
So, here is my brilliant theory.

1002
01:27:02,433 --> 01:27:03,730
You want to live.

1003
01:27:05,102 --> 01:27:07,229
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1004
01:27:07,871 --> 01:27:09,463
I bought you dinner.

1005
01:27:14,711 --> 01:27:17,771
"Given the valuable information
he has provided

1006
01:27:18,549 --> 01:27:22,110
"and in exchange for
his full cooperation,

1007
01:27:22,553 --> 01:27:25,420
"Dr. Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland"?

1008
01:27:25,522 --> 01:27:29,481
I sent that message to Washington
this morning, of course it was encoded.

1009
01:27:30,194 --> 01:27:33,789
You guys haven't broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.

1010
01:27:33,897 --> 01:27:35,865
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1011
01:27:35,966 --> 01:27:39,527
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.

1012
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:41,938
You know more about Schmidt
than anyone.

1013
01:27:42,306 --> 01:27:47,437
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1014
01:27:47,544 --> 01:27:50,479
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

1015
01:27:51,248 --> 01:27:53,876
It's you or Schmidt.

1016
01:27:54,485 --> 01:27:56,544
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1017
01:27:59,156 --> 01:28:02,250
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

1018
01:28:03,994 --> 01:28:06,792
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1019
01:28:06,897 --> 01:28:09,092
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?

1020
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:10,166
What?

1021
01:28:11,201 --> 01:28:13,396
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

1022
01:28:13,504 --> 01:28:15,631
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!

1023
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,637
What's his target?

1024
01:28:18,942 --> 01:28:21,274
His target

1025
01:28:22,846 --> 01:28:23,904
is everywhere.

1026
01:28:44,735 --> 01:28:46,362
Tomorrow,

1027
01:28:47,137 --> 01:28:50,436
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1028
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:53,676
<i>borne to victory on the wings
of the Valkyrie.</i>

1029
01:28:54,845 --> 01:28:58,747
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

1030
01:28:59,383 --> 01:29:04,343
If they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1031
01:29:08,859 --> 01:29:11,225
If they cut off one head,

1032
01:29:11,762 --> 01:29:14,526
two more shall take its place.

1033
01:29:14,898 --> 01:29:16,195
Hail Hydra.

1034
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,467
- Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra!

1035
01:29:18,168 --> 01:29:20,796
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!

1036
01:29:32,783 --> 01:29:35,581
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1037
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:37,921
<i>Please wait for the all-clear.</i>

1038
01:29:38,288 --> 01:29:43,248
<i>Your attention, please. All citizens shall
remain indoors until further notice.</i>

1039
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:47,021
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1040
01:29:55,038 --> 01:29:57,006
Dr. Erskine said that

1041
01:29:57,374 --> 01:29:59,842
the serum wouldn't
just affect my muscles,

1042
01:29:59,943 --> 01:30:02,002
it would affect my cells.

1043
01:30:03,046 --> 01:30:06,846
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

1044
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:08,577
Which means

1045
01:30:10,887 --> 01:30:12,514
I can't get drunk.

1046
01:30:14,324 --> 01:30:15,621
Did you know that?

1047
01:30:16,059 --> 01:30:20,291
Your metabolism burns four times faster
than the average person.

1048
01:30:22,032 --> 01:30:24,660
He thought it could be
one of the side effects.

1049
01:30:29,673 --> 01:30:31,641
It wasn't your fault.

1050
01:30:32,809 --> 01:30:34,436
- Did you read the report?
- Yes.

1051
01:30:35,646 --> 01:30:36,943
Then you know that's not true.

1052
01:30:37,047 --> 01:30:38,776
You did everything you could.

1053
01:30:42,185 --> 01:30:44,312
Did you believe in your friend?

1054
01:30:44,421 --> 01:30:45,888
Did you respect him?

1055
01:30:47,524 --> 01:30:49,424
Then stop blaming yourself.

1056
01:30:49,793 --> 01:30:52,125
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1057
01:30:52,529 --> 01:30:54,019
He damn well must have thought
you were worth it.

1058
01:30:56,633 --> 01:30:58,157
I'm going after Schmidt.

1059
01:30:59,803 --> 01:31:03,102
I'm not gonna stop until all of Hydra
is dead or captured.

1060
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:06,669
You won't be alone.

1061
01:31:09,313 --> 01:31:12,476
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god,

1062
01:31:12,582 --> 01:31:14,516
and he's willing to blow up
half the world to prove it,

1063
01:31:14,618 --> 01:31:16,176
starting with the USA.

1064
01:31:16,286 --> 01:31:19,380
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1065
01:31:19,489 --> 01:31:21,218
He gets across the Atlantic,

1066
01:31:21,325 --> 01:31:23,725
he will wipe out
the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1067
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:29,790
How much time we got?

1068
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,164
According to my new best friend,
under 24 hours.

1069
01:31:32,269 --> 01:31:35,238
- Where is he now?
- Hydra's last base is here.

1070
01:31:36,106 --> 01:31:39,507
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

1071
01:31:41,545 --> 01:31:42,944
So what are we supposed to do?

1072
01:31:43,046 --> 01:31:45,606
I mean, it's not like
we can just knock on the front door.

1073
01:31:46,283 --> 01:31:47,580
Why not?

1074
01:31:52,689 --> 01:31:54,850
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1075
01:34:00,484 --> 01:34:04,580
Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait,

1076
01:34:04,688 --> 01:34:06,781
but I must say,
you do it better than anyone.

1077
01:34:09,726 --> 01:34:12,354
But there are limits

1078
01:34:12,729 --> 01:34:14,993
to what even you can do, Captain.

1079
01:34:15,499 --> 01:34:18,730
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1080
01:34:18,835 --> 01:34:20,268
He told me you were insane.

1081
01:34:25,008 --> 01:34:26,976
He resented my genius

1082
01:34:27,077 --> 01:34:30,638
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.

1083
01:34:30,747 --> 01:34:32,305
But he gave you everything.

1084
01:34:34,751 --> 01:34:35,979
So,

1085
01:34:37,787 --> 01:34:40,347
what made you so special?

1086
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,686
Nothing.

1087
01:34:45,896 --> 01:34:47,420
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1088
01:34:58,975 --> 01:35:00,533
I can do this all day.

1089
01:35:00,644 --> 01:35:02,635
Of course you can, of course.

1090
01:35:02,746 --> 01:35:06,045
But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.

1091
01:35:11,755 --> 01:35:13,120
So am I.

1092
01:35:25,602 --> 01:35:28,230
Rogers! You might need this!

1093
01:35:28,705 --> 01:35:29,672
Thanks!

1094
01:35:40,917 --> 01:35:43,408
We're in! Assault team, go!

1095
01:35:43,653 --> 01:35:44,950
Move out!

1096
01:35:45,889 --> 01:35:47,618
Move!

1097
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:55,555
Keep your spacing!

1098
01:36:35,171 --> 01:36:37,332
Cut off one head, two more shall...

1099
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:40,536
Let's go find two more!

1100
01:37:07,270 --> 01:37:08,237
You're late.

1101
01:37:11,274 --> 01:37:13,242
- Weren't you about to...
- Right.

1102
01:38:27,917 --> 01:38:28,906
Get in!

1103
01:38:57,614 --> 01:38:58,911
- Keep it steady!
- Wait!

1104
01:39:04,487 --> 01:39:05,681
Go get him.

1105
01:39:07,657 --> 01:39:09,318
I'm not kissing you!

1106
01:42:48,811 --> 01:42:51,939
- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope!

1107
01:44:00,817 --> 01:44:03,377
You could have the power of the gods!

1108
01:44:04,087 --> 01:44:08,717
Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations!

1109
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:11,752
I have seen the future, Captain!

1110
01:44:12,728 --> 01:44:15,754
- There are no flags!
- Not my future!

1111
01:44:29,645 --> 01:44:30,669
What have you done?

1112
01:44:31,647 --> 01:44:32,614
No!

1113
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:42,976
<i>Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?</i>

1114
01:45:43,252 --> 01:45:44,412
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1115
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:45,919
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?

1116
01:45:46,022 --> 01:45:47,512
<i>Peggy, Schmidt's dead!</i>

1117
01:45:48,224 --> 01:45:49,748
<i>What about the plane?</i>

1118
01:45:51,627 --> 01:45:53,094
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1119
01:45:53,563 --> 01:45:55,929
Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.

1120
01:45:57,233 --> 01:45:59,326
There's not gonna be a safe landing.

1121
01:45:59,602 --> 01:46:01,194
<i>But I can try and force it down.</i>

1122
01:46:01,304 --> 01:46:03,272
I'll get Howard on the line.
He'll know what to do.

1123
01:46:03,372 --> 01:46:04,361
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

1124
01:46:04,473 --> 01:46:07,067
<i>This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.</i>

1125
01:46:11,681 --> 01:46:13,444
I got to put her in the water.

1126
01:46:13,916 --> 01:46:16,612
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

1127
01:46:16,919 --> 01:46:18,045
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1128
01:46:18,154 --> 01:46:20,554
If I wait any longer,
a lot of people are gonna die.

1129
01:46:26,095 --> 01:46:27,289
Peggy,

1130
01:46:29,098 --> 01:46:30,360
this is my choice.

1131
01:46:54,624 --> 01:46:55,750
Peggy?

1132
01:46:56,626 --> 01:46:57,923
<i>I'm here.</i>

1133
01:47:00,796 --> 01:47:03,594
I'm gonna need a rain check
on that dance.

1134
01:47:11,807 --> 01:47:12,933
All right.

1135
01:47:15,978 --> 01:47:18,344
A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

1136
01:47:19,815 --> 01:47:21,112
You got it.

1137
01:47:23,052 --> 01:47:27,011
<i>8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late. Understood?</i>

1138
01:47:29,392 --> 01:47:31,451
You know,
I still don't know how to dance.

1139
01:47:37,667 --> 01:47:40,636
I'll show you how. Just be there.

1140
01:47:42,004 --> 01:47:43,631
We'll have the band
play something slow.

1141
01:47:47,743 --> 01:47:49,301
<i>I'd hate to step on your...</i>

1142
01:47:52,348 --> 01:47:53,315
Steve?

1143
01:47:55,851 --> 01:47:57,148
Steve?

1144
01:48:00,523 --> 01:48:01,717
Steve?

1145
01:49:00,783 --> 01:49:02,250
To the Captain.

1146
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:15,397
Sir?

1147
01:49:25,541 --> 01:49:27,509
Take us to the next grid point.

1148
01:49:27,777 --> 01:49:29,836
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1149
01:49:30,546 --> 01:49:33,174
And the energy signature stops here.

1150
01:49:34,283 --> 01:49:36,012
Just keep looking.

1151
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:47,145
<i>Curve ball,
high and outside for ball one.</i>

1152
01:50:48,457 --> 01:50:51,153
<i>So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.</i>

1153
01:50:52,061 --> 01:50:54,427
<i>And the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat,</i>

1154
01:50:54,530 --> 01:50:57,397
<i>this fellow's capable of making it
a brand-new game again.</i>

1155
01:50:58,868 --> 01:51:01,996
<i>Just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at Ebbets Field.</i>

1156
01:51:02,872 --> 01:51:06,035
<i>The Phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4.</i>

1157
01:51:06,876 --> 01:51:09,174
<i>But the Dodgers have three men on.</i>

1158
01:51:13,716 --> 01:51:16,514
<i>Pearson beaned Reiser
in Philadelphia last month.</i>

1159
01:51:16,652 --> 01:51:19,780
<i>Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here
to return the favor?</i>

1160
01:51:20,222 --> 01:51:22,349
<i>Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.</i>

1161
01:51:22,725 --> 01:51:25,785
<i>Swung on. A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.</i>

1162
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:29,027
<i>Three runs will score.</i>

1163
01:51:29,398 --> 01:51:32,856
<i>Reiser heads to third.
Durocher's going to wave him in.</i>

1164
01:51:33,903 --> 01:51:36,201
<i>Here comes the relay,
but they won't get him.</i>

1165
01:51:37,673 --> 01:51:38,640
Good morning.

1166
01:51:40,676 --> 01:51:42,371
Or should I say afternoon?

1167
01:51:43,512 --> 01:51:44,536
Where am I?

1168
01:51:45,347 --> 01:51:47,338
You're in a recovery room
in New York City.

1169
01:51:49,251 --> 01:51:52,709
<i>The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers!</i>

1170
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,885
<i>Everyone is on their feet.</i>

1171
01:51:55,257 --> 01:51:58,590
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.</i>

1172
01:51:58,694 --> 01:51:59,922
Where am I really?

1173
01:52:01,263 --> 01:52:03,231
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1174
01:52:04,033 --> 01:52:05,330
The game.

1175
01:52:05,534 --> 01:52:08,401
It's from May 1941.
I know, 'cause I was there.

1176
01:52:12,441 --> 01:52:14,409
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

1177
01:52:14,977 --> 01:52:15,944
Where am I?

1178
01:52:17,313 --> 01:52:18,610
- Captain Rogers...
- Who are you?

1179
01:52:26,255 --> 01:52:27,882
Captain Rogers, wait!

1180
01:52:29,725 --> 01:52:31,420
All agents, code 13!

1181
01:52:31,927 --> 01:52:34,760
<i>I repeat. All agents, code 13!</i>

1182
01:52:55,417 --> 01:52:56,941
At ease, soldier!

1183
01:53:05,527 --> 01:53:08,428
Look, I'm sorry about that little show
back there,

1184
01:53:09,765 --> 01:53:12,734
but we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

1185
01:53:12,935 --> 01:53:14,232
Break what?

1186
01:53:16,672 --> 01:53:18,299
You've been asleep, Cap.

1187
01:53:18,807 --> 01:53:20,832
For almost 70 years.

1188
01:53:35,457 --> 01:53:36,651
You gonna be okay?

1189
01:53:37,793 --> 01:53:38,817
Yeah.

1190
01:53:39,194 --> 01:53:40,491
Yeah, I just...

1191
01:53:43,932 --> 01:53:45,422
I had a date.

1192
02:03:07,095 --> 02:03:08,722
Trouble sleeping?

1193
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:12,897
You're here with a mission, sir?

1194
02:03:13,868 --> 02:03:14,857
I am.

1195
02:03:15,604 --> 02:03:17,401
Trying to get me back in the world?

1196
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:19,868
Trying to save it.

1197
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:30,713
<i>You think you're the only hero
in the world?</i>

1198
02:03:44,966 --> 02:03:46,092
Gentlemen?

1199
02:03:46,901 --> 02:03:47,959
You're up.

1200
02:03:54,392 --> 02:03:55,359
Got a mean swing.
