00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,385
I'm six months
from retirement.

00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,089
What've you fucked
up now, Combs?

3
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,654
We got a problem.

4
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,293
The man you're looking
for is not out there.

5
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,462
What are you saying?

6
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:14,234
Mohamed Fadawi.

7
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,605
We took him into
custody three weeks ago.

8
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:20,305
So my men have been risking their asses
running through them fuckin' mountains

9
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,211
for months
chasing a ghost.

10
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,512
It was top
secret, John.

11
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,154
Where is he?

12
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,689

14
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,715
How does it feel?

15
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,550
Huh?

16
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,422
You know what
we're capable of?

17
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,985
I am the humble

How does it

22
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,086
Hey, Slab.

23
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,453
Hey, Colin, what's up?

24
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,185
Goddamn engine.

25
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,229
Got it held together with
safety pins, toothpicks.

26
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,399
You heard
any noises?

27
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,159
Like what?

28
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,932
Like people screaming.

29
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,066
Have been hearing all kinds of
weird shit for a couple of days now,

30
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,542
but I keep my nose down
and mind my own business.

31
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:00,593
You killed hundreds of
innocent women and children.

32
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:05,263
You. You've killed hundreds
and thousands of my people.

33
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,863
You are terrorists.

34
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,567
Ah!

35
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,876
Abu Ghraib. That's a paradise
compared to this, asshole.

36
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,517
Hey, hey, hey.

37
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,884
Take your hand off me.
What's going on here?

38
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,217
<i>None of your business.</i>

39
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,087
Got to speak to your
officer in charge.

40
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,719
No can do, pal.
You get lost.

41
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,936
Hey, Colin.

42
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:44,534
<i>You ever wonder why
we're out here?</i>

43
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,042
<i>This is a fucking
museum ship.</i>

44
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,283
Have you been to
the exhibition room?

45
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,252
<i>This thing's gotta be
over 50 years old.</i>

46
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,083
She floats, right?

47
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,953
Those guns, they can't
protect us from deadly squad.

48
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,754
There's something
going on.

49

<i>[muffled metallic noise]</i>

was that?

51
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:08,799
Collin, did you
hear that?

52
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,429
See, that's the shit I'm talking
about. That's what I'm talking about.

53
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,996
Relax. I'll
check it out.

54
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,103
You stay here.

[groans]

61
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:08,375
About four hours ago, I got a
distress signal from the ship,

62
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,855
and we lost
all communication.

63
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,688
I need you to go out there
and see what the hell happened.

64
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,538
General, I did a boarding
party on this ship

65
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,906
back in 65.
Did you know that?

66
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,775
This piece of shit should
be razor blades by now.

67
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,905
<i>Actually, it was
a naval museum</i>

68
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:40,214
recently commissioned to the joint
project for the CIA and the ONI.

69
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,083
It's a floating
Abu Ghraib prison.

70
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,811
I need a plumber, John.

71
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,117
Why do I smell fish?

72
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,925
Your son's on
that ship.

73
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,849
Why would he be
on this ship?

74
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,912
<i>Probably applied
for the detail.</i>

75
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,083
He doesn't volunteer
for anything.

76
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,558
Why would he be
on this?

77
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,959
Maybe he wants to
impress his father.

78
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,621
I doubt it.

79
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,657
What's the mission?

80
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:29,593
<i>I need you to escort the spooks.
They'll be searching for intel.</i>

81
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:33,655
Evac Fadawi and I need
it done in eight hours.

82
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,552
Eight hours.

83
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,155
Move to the midship. Move out.

84
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,385
Guys, we got a lot of dead
bodies here. Some recent kills.

85
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,322
I've been waiting for
this moment my entire life.

<i>What are you
talking about?</i>

87

Yeah. Looks like somebody twisted

no weapon?

did this,

did it with
their bare hands.

How in the fuck am I supposed
to know that, Swanson?

117

We're drifting due north, and straight
into Iranian territorial waters.

Two hours tops.

Is Fadawi the only
enemy, Captain?

121
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,154
There's no fuckin' way
one guy did all this shit.

Don't underestimate
this prick.

123
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,962
Our mission is to contact
the enemy, look for survivors,

124
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,863
and keep this ship from
falling into Iranian hands.

125

to that engine room.

126

See if you can
get it started.

127
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,763
Ricks and I will
look for survivors.

128
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,364

<i>Yeah, he's doing all
right. His vitals are good.</i>

He's got a serious bump on the back
of his head. Probably has a concussion.

163
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:50,208
Wake him up. Give him a shot of
adrenaline if you have to but wake him up.

164
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,749
Captain, are you sure?

165
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,251
He can take it.

00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,291
<i>Just a few. Not many but a few.</i>

<i>(Willets)

181
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,706
Holy shit.

182
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,680
How you doing, Colin?

183
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,448
You look a little
worse for the wear.

184
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,719
<i>It's been a
million years.</i>

185
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:50,466
Listen, Colin, I'm all
dressed up and no one to kill.

186
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,867
<i>We boarded this thing
and haven't fired a shot.</i>

187
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,436
What happened?

188
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:59,208
<i>What did you see?
What's happened?</i>

189
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,837
Well, after
dinner, we, uh,

190
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,579
well, we heard screaming.

191
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,119
<i>These fucking animals
were torturing someone.</i>

192
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,918
Wait a second. They were
interrogating someone.

193
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,324
Fadawi's on this ship.
Ace of spades.

194
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,124
Then you know
more than I know.

195
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,460
<i>(over the radio)
Captain Willets.</i>

196
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:22,124
Willets.

197
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,998
<i>We found another survivor.
It's the cook.</i>

198
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,906
Go ahead. So, you
heard screaming?

199
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,142
What happened?

200
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,647
I went to investigate and the next
thing I know is hell breaks loose.

201
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,910
That's the last
thing I remember.

202
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:41,248
So you didn't
see Fadawi.

203
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,014
No.

204
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,189
Take it.

205
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,784
You're gonna
need this.

206
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,598
Colin.

207
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,397
[whispers]
To be content.

208
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,131
Yes, Sir.

209
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,415
It was nice seeing
you, too, Dad.

210
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,293
All right, listen up.
It's gonna be a long night.

211
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,919
<i>It's where heavy
sweat starts.</i>

212
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,897
Mohamed Fadawi is
unaccounted for.

213
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,866
<i>Maybe he abandoned
the ship.</i>

214
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:04,993
<i>No, there are no
lifeboats missing.</i>

215
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,937
If he took off, he drifted
into Iranian waters.

216
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,600
<i>They would torture his ass
a lot worse than we would.</i>

217
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,302
<i>Just how dangerous
is this guy?</i>

218
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,140
<i>Traci, I saw a
DVD once of him</i>

219
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:16,942
<i>cutting off an Iraqi ministry's
head with a pocket knife.</i>

220
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,678
Gimme a nail file and I'll
show him how it's really done.

221
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,686
It's not funny, dude.

222
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:27,054
<i>So, 'till we find him
dead or alive, wrap him up.</i>

223
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,422
He's a threat.

224
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,552
<i>All right.
Let's get to it.</i>

225
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:35,066
Hold on a second. Slab, you and
Swanson get that engine running.

226
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:39,229
Buford, Ricks, set up
a temporary morgue.

227
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:44,901
Grubman, run a short test. Any Seal that's
not on the hunt help with the morgue.

228
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:47,740
I'm gonna offer this country
a set of commandments.

229
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:48,836

230
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:53,274
Colin, you and
Alberts team up.

231
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:57,151
<i>Chris McCloskey, Sir. I wanted to
thank everyone for saving my life.</i>

232
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:01,022
Thanks, guys. If it weren't
for you, we'd probably be dead.

233
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:04,960
I'm the ship's chef, so I was gonna make
something real special for you, guys.

234
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,590
I got steaks and other
goodies whenever you're ready.

235
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,600
<i>We chow out

<i>And remember, at dawn

237
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,739
Okay, let's move out!

238
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,910
Let's go.

239
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,798
Traci.

240
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,595
Hey.

How're you feeling?

242
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,704
Better, thanks.

243
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,266
What about you?

244
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,245
I'm okay.

245
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,940
Just wanted
to apologize.

246
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,141
It's all right.

247
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,947
So, what are
you guys doing?

248
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,217
I'm...

250
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:13,192
[whispers]
Sorry.

251
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,367
Why don't you
ask your daddy?

00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,112
Colin.

254
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,841
Where're you going?

255
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,311
You have a lot
of cleaning up to do.

256
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,417
You know, Colin, I know that
you're the Captain's kid and all

257
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,189
but you're still shit
the rag man to me.

258
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,763
<i>(Swanson) This isn't looking good I</i>

259
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,028
It'll take a while
to get enough pressure

260
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,502
and the pumps to get this
thing up and running again.

261
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,936
How long?

262
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,974
<i>A couple of
hours at least.</i>

263
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,101
Then we gotta see if the
turbines can take the heat

264
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,078
when the cooling
system is dry.

265
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,011
What do you
think crooked it?

266
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,313
I don't know. That's
the fucking mystery.

267
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,584
I'll tell you
what, Jackson.

268
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:48,456
When I joined the Navy, I thought
I'd be taken off in aircraft carriers

269
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:50,494
doing barrel
roles in F-14.

270
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,291
One, two, three.

271
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:01,669
<i>We're stuck here piling up dead
comrades after a bloody massacre.</i>

272

How's your kid, Sir?

273
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,243
She's good.

274
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,681
She was just made captain
of her soccer team.

275
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:17,017
I miss watching
those games.

276
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,751
The Seals are pretty much
the only family I've ever had.

<i>[Colin retching]</i>

278
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,265
What's the matter, kid?

279
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,235
You never saw nobody wearing
their heart on their sleeve?

280
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:49,182
Hey, Buford, where
shall I leave these?

281
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,518
There's fine.

282
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:56,049
<i>So, welcome to the Great
Persian Gulf Massacre.</i>

283
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,162
What do you
make of all this?

284
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:05,225
Well, we have a wide
variety of methods.

285
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,601
From impalement,
disembowelment,

286
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:10,266
dismemberment,
decapitation, electrocution,

287
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:14,607
<i>suffocation, and over here the
ever popular blunt force trauma.</i>

288
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,115
And the implementation of an
interesting assortment of weapons,

289
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,276
but generally whatever
seems to be handy.

290
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,751
And then of course there's
that whole dark theme

291
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,813
but using whatever the victim
has in their hands at the time.

292
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,620
And with that in mind, if
I meet up with this guy,

293
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,854
I hope I'm carrying
a sofa cushion.

294
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,092
So you figure it's
one guy, a terrorist?

295
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:38,067
The evidence points to it
all being done by one man.

296
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,797
You're kidding, right?

297
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,463
I kid you not.

298
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,507
The thing is that
the force of the blows

299
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,566
and the nature
of the injuries,

300
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,077
it's almost
as if, uh,

301
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:52,412
No, it just
seems impossible.

302
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,350
Well, anyway, you might
wanna head out 'cause it, uh,

303
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,820
it gets a little
gruesome from here on.

gonna tell me.

<i>I killed 30 of your
men with my bare hands.</i>

353
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,160
They were weak.

354
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,603
They were all cowards.

let me go,

your men will suffer
the same thing.

360
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,485
What did my men do
to deserve that?

361
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:04,687
They tortured me.
They tortured me!

362
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:08,823
They refused.
Then I felt a great power.

363
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,494
It was like God
taking over my body,

364
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,231
and giving me the strength
to strike down the savages

365

blades of grass.

god look like?

367
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,743
I never saw the face
of God myself,

368

but I felt
his presence.

369
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,585
Then I received
his gift.

370
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:32,782
To destroy and
vanquish my enemies.

371
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,415

382
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,596
No. They said they'd kill my
family if I didn't cooperate.

383
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,264
They said they'd kill my
dad, my mom, everybody.

529
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:06,113

you down here?

532
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,057
What happened?

533
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,565
He fell on me.

534
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,396
Are you okay?

535
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,833
He's dead.

536
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:29,736
Come on. Let's
get you cleaned up.

539
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:19,948
Be careful.

540
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,786
Oh, man. I don't
believe this.

541
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:26,158
First McCloskey, and then Jackson.
And now Ricks?

542
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:29,289
<i>Is everybody losing their
fucking minds or what?</i>

543
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:33,462
You know, I don't know whether
there's a ghost or a spirit,

544
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,300
but no human that I know of
can do this kind of damage.

545
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:37,931
It's a fucking ghost.

546
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,169
<i>It's not a goddamn ghost.
That's impossible.</i>

547
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:44,703
It's a fucking ghost!
It's screwing with our minds.

548
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,874
You control
yourself, soldier.

549
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,785
Suck it up.
We're gonna sink this ship.

550
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,323
We need to call for
evac right now, Sir.

551
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,723
Not 'till we finish
our mission.

552
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,727
<i>What exactly is
our mission, Captain?</i>

553
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,559
To confront and
destroy the enemy.

554
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,997
<i>You got it?</i>

555
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:06,092
C4.

556
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,363
Got it.

557
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,564
Buford, finish
your process.

558
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,472
Get these bodies
into a lifeboat.

559
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:15,340
No man gets
left behind.

560
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,312
Copy that.

561
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,547
Okay. Hey.
Hey. Hey.

562
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,918
I need you.
Okay?

563
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:28,586
<i>Swanson, okay?</i>

564
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:07,983
<i>[crack]</i>

565
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,287
Oh!
Hey.

566
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:16,126
Look at that
lifeboat food. 1945.

567
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,895
Holy Christ.

568
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,903
It used to wash ashore.

569
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:23,962
Ships getting blown
up off the coast.

570
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:34,039
Shall we?

571
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,226
Oh.

572
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,764
[both cough]

573
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,396
Good.

574
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,906
War's been
pulling me apart.

575
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,965
[coughs]

576
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:02,273
Lost countless friends.

577
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,307
My wife.

578
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,780
My son.

579
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,816
Your mother had
raven black hair.

580
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,822
You weren't born
in a hospital.

581
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:18,383
You were born
at home.

582
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,487
Your first crib was
a dresser drawer.

583
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:25,193
Had you all wrapped up in an army
blanket. You looked like a peanut.

584
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,566
Holy shit.

585
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,075
Who is he?

586
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,639
Get Grubman.

587
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:43,948
Why are my men dying?
Because of your scientific shit.

588
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,544
[shouts]
Why?

589
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,749
Your men are dying
because of an accident

590
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,792
that happened 60
fucking years ago.

591
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,759
[groans]

592
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,295
I'm good cop.
He's bad cop.

593
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,205
You see this?

594
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,936
[shouts]
Look at it!

595
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:10,077
I sailed on this ship.

596
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,046
Did a boarding party.

597
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:16,518
1965. Vietnam.
Look at it!

598
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,919
I survived because I
got knocked overboard.

599
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,859
But I remember
this face.

600
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:26,157
<i>Would you tell me
about that face?</i>

601
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,856
Come, damn it!

602
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,925
Breathe.
Breathe, breathe.

603
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:35,630
[coughs]

604
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,572
[groans and coughs]

605
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,871
Breathe.

606
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,809
Now we're talking.

607
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:45,941
Give!

608
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,210
March, 1945,
all right?

609
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,684
Navy surgeon
Richard Nolton

610
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,653
was given a top
secret mission.

611
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:58,888
<i>To sail this very ship to Chile
and pick up a Nazi SS officer.</i>

612
00:59:58,962 --> 01:00:02,454
<i>His name was Gunther Neumann.
They brought him aboard.</i>

613
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:06,332
They sequestered him in a black-ops
chamber and they interrogated him.

614
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:09,496
<i>The US had to find out how far
advanced they were technologically.</i>

615
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:13,133
<i>They were making scary shit at the
time. They had V2s, the rocket missiles.</i>

616
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:16,110
We thought they were beating
us at the Manhattan Project.

617
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,148
And this SS officer, they
thought he had the secret weapon.

618
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:27,320
Gunther Neumann was
the secret weapon.

619
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:30,416
What the fuck are
you talking about?

620
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:32,620
He was the first
participant

621
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,925
in a secret
Nazi experiment.

622
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:37,125
Eugenic conduction.

623
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,260
<i>He was their attempt to
create the perfect soldier.</i>

624
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:43,305
Highly trained. Chemically
altered. Genetically mutated.

625
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,432
Brainwashed.
Perfection.

626
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:50,276
Ultimate killing machine
with no conscience.

627
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:54,243
<i>And for science
it was beautiful.</i>

628
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,047
<i>And Nolton, he wanted
to unravel that science.</i>

629
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,645
<i>He was on a cutting
edge of electroshock</i>

630
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:03,488
<i>and neurological procedures at that
time, and he knew the power of Neumann</i>

631
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:05,390
<i>was embedded in
his nervous system.</i>

632
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:08,294
<i>So, he did these
experiments as you might say.</i>

633
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:13,233
<i>Torture. He did tests on his brain
chemistry and his genetic makeup.</i>

634
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:18,001
<i>And this strange electromagnetic
fields on the cerebral cortex.</i>

635
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,065
Just mind blowing
shit, you know.

636
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,976
<i>And it was during one
of these sessions</i>

637
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:27,278
<i>that an unexpected
electrochemical reaction occurred.</i>

638
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,875
<i>No one knew exactly what
happened, but afterwards</i>

639
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:32,750
<i>everyone on board
had been slaughtered.</i>

640
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:35,382
<i>Internal reports said
Neumann had jumped the ship</i>

641
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,323
and drowned while
trying to flee.

642
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:40,692
Doctor Nolton, he didn't buy it.
He was too fucking smart for them.

643
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:44,995
<i>He knew, he new
that Neumann's being,</i>

644
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:49,095
his, uh... energy

645
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,436
fused with this ship.

646
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,141
<i>The son of a bitch
was right.</i>

647
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,908
He was right!

648
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,026
Jesus.

649
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:16,826
<i>Listen. My orders are
to capture the entity</i>

650
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,833
and that's it.

651
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:22,962
<i>They come from General Combs, okay?
That supersedes your authority.</i>

652
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,700
Fuck him.

653
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,799
I'm gonna send this
ship to the bottom.

654
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,639
D... do you
not understand?

655
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,202
If we were able to capture
this, the-this entity,

656
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,044
if we were able to tap into
Neumann's power, harness it,

657
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:36,847
we'd have the most powerful
weapon on the planet!

658
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:40,821
<i>It could permeate any defense
system, any security perimeter.</i>

659
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,222
I n American hands
that'd be devastating.

660
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:46,125
Wrong. With that kind
of power in our hands,

661
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:49,926
we could win the war on terror. And
any good soldier would know that.

662
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:53,162
Over my dead body.

663
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:55,494
<i>(Grubman)
Listen to me.</i>

664
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:57,971
<i>It's the only way that
you can stop Neumann I</i>

665
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,769
You had your shot.

666
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:02,242
No. No, no. Listen to me.
He's too powerful.

667
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:05,576
You go after him now, and it's
suicide. Utter suicide, all right?

668
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,513
Colin!

669
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,848
Colin! Colin, stop it
and listen to me!

671
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:13,887

673
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:43,912

<i>[saw functioning]</i>

677
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:53,682
Let's say we're looking for a ghost.
How are we supposed to kill this thing?

678
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:56,520
A ghost is a
concentration of energy.

679
01:04:56,592 --> 01:05:00,688
Usually an ectoplasmic entity
unified by an electromagnetic field.

680
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:03,960
So, if you want to destroy it, first
you have to penetrate the field.

681
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,331
<i>And then disintegrate
the scepter.</i>

682
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:09,860
<i>(Slab) Is that a way of saying
that bullets can't destroy it?</i>

683
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,770
Maybe.

684
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:15,800
But even ghosts can avoid the
laws of physics and nature.

Let him go, Grubman.

705
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,393
Argh!

706
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:01,687
[groans]

707
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:29,620
Oh, shit.

708
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:31,956
Captain!

709
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,599
[shouts]
Come on, someone!

710
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,108
[shouts]

711
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:54,877

712
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,578
[shouts]

713
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,983
[whispers]
I hate ya.

714
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,956
I hate you, too.

715
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:14,886
[shouts]
Come get me!

716
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,954
[shout]
Come!

717
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,446
So, we went by
the stair again.

718
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,917
By the first exit.

719
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:41,478
Main deck, second deck,
first platform.

720
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:49,463
This doesn't
make sense.

721
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,761
What is it?

722
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:54,826
There's an empty space where
there's no exit, no entrance,

723
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,201
no staircase,
no doorway.

724
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:59,638
Beneath the
interrogation room.

725
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:06,607
I think we have
ground zero.

726
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,514
We need your help.

727
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,491
Help with what?

728
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,686
Wait, wait, wait.
Help with what?

729
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,866
[whispers]
Slab.

730
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:33,965
[grunts]

731
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,509
Get up.

732
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:39,942
[whisper]
How do you feel?

733
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:42,483
I never felt better.

734
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:44,143
Great.

735
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:47,279
Where's that bastard
ghost hunter?

736
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:48,846
Fuck!

737
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,858
I'll get you up.

738
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,494
<i>What is that?</i>

739
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:57,760
It's a reversal
electromagnetic field generator.

740
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:00,131
That shit's only supposed
to be theoretical.

741
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:01,794
It's Grubman's prototype.

742
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,337
What does it do?

743
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:05,236
<i>I've never used it,
but theoretically</i>

744
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:08,037
it's supposed to capture and
store the paranormal entity.

745
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,577
We wanna kill
this thing.

746
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:11,237
Yeah, I know.

747
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:12,678
<i>Here's what
I'm thinking.</i>

748
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:15,342
If we can harness
enough power

749
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:18,875
and focus it into one
intense EM pulse,

750
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:22,048
we might be able to disrupt
Neumann's electromagnetic field.

751
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,751
<i>(Slab) How do you
know all this shit?</i>

752
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:27,227
MIT grad computer science
and engineering.

753
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:31,198
Can you get the
engine room powered up?

754
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:32,858
Yeah.

755
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,665
<i>(Slab) Through the
transfer switches</i>

756
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:41,676

Fry the fucker's internal

759
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:48,550
Send him straight
back to hell.

760
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,244
Let's find out.

761
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:56,016
Make sure that doesn't pull on the
transformer otherwise we're fucked.

762
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:57,456
<i>(Ali)
I won't.</i>

763
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,068
Okay.

764
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:12,768
Are you ready?

765
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,240
Ready.

766
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:16,573
Okay.
Whatcha got?

767
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:18,169
<i>Nothing.</i>

768
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:19,509
<i>Fuck!
Ready?</i>

769
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:20,809
Come on.

770
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:38,723
Now.

771
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,131
We got power.

772
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,294
<i>Yeah I</i>

773
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,088

01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:08,152
<i>We got it.
Power's up.</i>

775
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,790

expecting you, Colin.

<i>You have not come

You have come

<i>You are not one of

I had a gift, Colin.

815
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:41,920
It was a very
special gift

816
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:45,391
which could've been
used to better mankind.

I understand you've been
through quite an ordeal.

I suppose this is the part where you tell
me I signed a confidentiality agreement

before taking
this mission.

You're also required to

several days.

You knew men's lives

That's not
good enough.
