1
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,230
Look out. Here he comes.

2
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,279
Probably gonna to show us
how to stack the paint.

3
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,606
Hold it, guys.

4
00:03:53,607 --> 00:03:55,943
Let me give you a hand there.

5
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,741
There we go.

6
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:04,745
Nice and tight up against the wall

7
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,580
with a one-inch interval
between the cans.

8
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:08,499
All right?

9
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,342
Let's see a double.

10
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,718
Double!

11
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,095
You got it.

12
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:23,722
You got it.

13
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,812
Hey, Al.

14
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,357
What's going on here, Soapy?

15
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,189
Nothing much.
Just a little game to pass the time.

16
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,446
I suggest that you postpone
this little game of yours

17
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:40,864
and get back to work...

18
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,282
Pronto!

19
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,743
It's a quarter to fucking 5:00.

20
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,786
That's correct.

21
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,871
Which means we have
exactly 15 more minutes

22
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,540
to get that turbine squared away

23
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:50,374
for a systems check.

24
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,751
We're on a tight schedule here, guys.

25
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,378
Come on! Work with me.

26
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,285
You got it, Al.

27
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,422
We're with you, now.
Let's break this up.

28
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,466
That turbine's going in 15 minutes.

29
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:00,759
Let's hit it!

30
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,512
All right, Fuhrman,
you take the left silicon switches.

31
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:04,346
Get them all primed.

32
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,807
You monkeys start calibrating

33
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,767
the density magnetometers.

34
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,280
Hey, Dex...

35
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,448
Poker game tonight. My room.

36
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,783
I'm there.

37
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:25,826
You come too, Taco...

38
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,160
and bring Elwood with you.

39
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,453
Now, who gonna bring the beer?

40
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,830
I'll bring the beer.

41
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,915
No, no. you brought moose piss last time.

42
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,333
Taco, you bring the beer.

43
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,793
Nothing wrong with my taste in beer.

44
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,779
Damn. I wish this place had a pool.

45
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,325
What the fuck?

46
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,160
Oh, sorry, man... I mean, Mr. Fountain.

47
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,286
It's all right. It's all right, Dex.

48
00:06:09,338 --> 00:06:10,621
There's no harm done.

49
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,624
You can call me Al, you know?

50
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:14,958
Al.

51
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,627
Hey, Elwood, wait up, man!

52
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,795
Come on.

53
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,148
Sure. I'd love to play
poker with you guys.

54
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,608
I'll bring the beer.

55
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,735
I... I insist. I'm the boss.

56
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:43,695
I'll pay for the beer.

57
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,811
Poker?

58
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,427
No, I really have no desire

59
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,991
to play poker with you guys.

60
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,451
Why?

61
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,036
Because it's a stupid game.

62
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,746
You heard me.

63
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,416
It's a stupid, stupid game!

64
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,867
Thank you.

65
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,343
Hey, Al.

66
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,063
What are you thinking
about over here?

67
00:08:00,115 --> 00:08:02,024
Oh, nothing, really.

68
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,942
I'm just thinking.

69
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,028
What can I do for you, Soapy?

70
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:06,945
I wanted to tell you

71
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,822
I was sorry about the incident today.

72
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:10,272
The guys were letting off steam.

73
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,910
- It won't happen again.
- It's all right. I understand.

74
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:14,244
Sometimes I feel like

75
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,914
letting a little steam off myself.

76
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,415
Yeah?

77
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,210
Why don't you come by the room,
play some poker tonight?

78
00:08:21,262 --> 00:08:22,419
Poker?

79
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,629
Hmm.

80
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,964
Hmm. Maybe so.

81
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,133
I got a couple things
to get squared away,

82
00:08:28,185 --> 00:08:30,552
but we'll see.

83
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:31,970
Ok.

84
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,056
I'll see you there, then.

85
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,432
Room 714.

86
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,469
Take that! Hyah!

87
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,471
Bobby, can you get that?

88
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,517
- Hello.
- Hello, Bob. It's your father.

89
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,102
What are you doing?

90
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,019
Studying.

91
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,021
Good for you. See that?

92
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,107
Summer school's not so bad, is it?

93
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,525
No, sir.

94
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,485
What's 12 times 7?

95
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,029
17?

96
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,991
I'm sorry, Bob. What did you say?

97
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,535
28?

98
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,454
No, it isn't, Bob.

99
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,748
Put your mother on.

100
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,369
- Hi, Al.
- Is he studying, Deb?

101
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,506
I don't get the sense that he's studying.

102
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,550
He's studying, Al.

103
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,343
Well, I want you to get
him some flashcards,

104
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,012
and I want him to know
his multiplication...

105
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:57,045
1 through 12... By the time I get home.

106
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,141
Did you have a bad day?
You seem a little tense.

107
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:00,559
No, Deb, I had a good day.

108
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,644
I had to get firm
with some of the men,

109
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,188
But they took it well, which is good.

110
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,174
Just trying to instill in them

111
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:08,056
a healthy respect for authority.

112
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,652
I'm sure they all like you
and respect you, Al.

113
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,655
Well, that's not my concern, Deb...

114
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,449
although they did invite me

115
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,159
to a poker game tonight.

116
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,723
That's great!

117
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:20,240
Are you gonna go?

118
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:21,653
No, I don't think so.

119
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,665
Oh, come on, Al. You should go.

120
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,084
Listen, deb, I'll go if I feel like going.

121
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,670
If I don't feel like it,
then I'm not gonna go.

122
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,088
No, that's good, Al.

123
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,174
Well, we're right on schedule here,

124
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,675
and it looks like I'll be home

125
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,093
a week from today.

126
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:36,991
So you're gonna miss the 4th?

127
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:38,555
Yep. we'll work that weekend,

128
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,098
and I'll fly out on the 5th.

129
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,185
I should get into O'Hare around 4:38.

130
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,395
I can't wait to see you, Al.
I miss you.

131
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,064
Well, Deb, it's my job.

132
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,066
Sorry. I forgot.

133
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,692
Thank god I didn't say
something really stupid

134
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,110
like "I love you."

135
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,904
And I love you, too, Deb.

136
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,614
Oh, mom, should I ask him...

137
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,200
Hold on. Bobby wants
to say something.

138
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,911
Dad, can I get some fireworks?

139
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,580
No, Bob. Fireworks are illegal.

140
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,958
Good night.

141
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,751
Good night.

142
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,865
How's it going?

143
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:38,907
Ha ha ha ha!

144
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,868
How's it going, guys?

145
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,369
Ha ha!

146
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,495
How's it going?

147
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:44,872
Hi, guys.

148
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,999
What the hell
did you invite Fountain for?

149
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,876
Don't worry. He won't show.

150
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,419
He's probably in bed right now

151
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,005
with his nose stuck
in the Abcom manual.

152
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,882
He's probably jerking off to it.

153
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,511
Hell, I'll bet he don't even jerk off.

154
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,513
The guy better not show up, man.

155
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,015
He bugs the shit out of me.

156
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:03,932
Why?

157
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:05,225
Why? He's an asshole!

158
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,435
Oh, I don't know, Dex.

159
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,520
The way I see,
he's one of those guys

160
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,522
who goes through life like a robot.

161
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:11,899
He can't help it.

162
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,525
He like a damn machine
on automatic pilot.

163
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,527
I feel kind of sorry for him.

164
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:16,445
Yeah?

165
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,572
I still think he's an asshole.

166
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,448
So do I.

167
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,449
You may be right.

168
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,909
Are we gonna play poker
here or what?

169
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,428
Bring those pieces
of pipe over there.

170
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,436
We need that front
end loader around here.

171
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,279
Running like clockwork today, Al.

172
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:00,228
Turbine's in.

173
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,605
We're ready to run the system check

174
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,825
whenever you want
to give her the juice.

175
00:13:03,877 --> 00:13:05,536
Ok. All right. Systems check.

176
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,913
We'll square that away right now.

177
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,456
Jesus, Al.

178
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,323
You look like shit.

179
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,991
What did you do, party all night?

180
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,587
I had a little trouble
sleeping, that's all.

181
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:18,465
Well, you should
have come by the game.

182
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,969
Yeah, I probably should have.

183
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:13,562
What's going on, chief?

184
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,522
The job is canceled.

185
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:17,128
Canceled? what do you mean, canceled?

186
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,437
Canceled over a management decision.

187
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:21,695
They're giving us all our bonus, and...

188
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,073
They're sending us home.

189
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,663
Dexter moon. There you go, Dex.

190
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:32,581
Gracias.

191
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:33,665
Good job, buddy.

192
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:35,083
Anytime.

193
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,085
All right. Curtis Wiley. Pass this back.

194
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,588
All right. Listen up.

195
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,715
The shuttle van leaves
for the airport at 3:45.

196
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,550
I want all you monkeys to be on time

197
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,677
'cause I'm not missing
that fucking flight.

198
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,096
You got that right.

199
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,725
I'd like for us to take
a moment to thank our chief

200
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:54,228
for getting us out
of this shithole early...

201
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,021
with a bonus on top of it!

202
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,773
Let's hear it for Al Fountain.

203
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,233
Let's hear it!

204
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,984
Come on.

205
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,611
All right.

206
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:03,904
I'd like to make a suggestion

207
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,239
based on experience,
some of you guys might...

208
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,151
Hyah!

209
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:44,486
Take that!

210
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,654
Hello.

211
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,239
Hi, Deb. It's Al.

212
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,782
Hey. Mr. Clockwork.

213
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,357
- What?
- Hyah!

214
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,775
Well, it's 9:00 on the button.

215
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,287
I could almost set my watch by you.

216
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,748
Well, didn't we say
I would call at 9:00?

217
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,251
It's a joke, Al.

218
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:00,528
Oh ho ho!

219
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,701
I see.

220
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,870
Yeah, now I get it.

221
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,341
Listen, deb, I can't talk too long,

222
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,551
But I just wanted to let you know

223
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:08,969
that we're still on schedule,

224
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,805
and I'll be seeing you
in exactly 6 days.

225
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,182
Hyah!

226
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:14,808
What are you doing this weekend?

227
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,642
Oh, I don't know.

228
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:18,312
Some of the guys
asked me to go fishing.

229
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,855
I might go with them.

230
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,190
That's great!

231
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,587
See, I told you they liked you.

232
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,062
Did you play poker last night?

233
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:25,485
Yes, and it was a lot of fun.

234
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:29,020
So... that's it, really.

235
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,949
I'll call you the day after tomorrow.

236
00:16:31,001 --> 00:16:32,826
Wait. don't you want
to speak to Bobby?

237
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:33,702
No.

238
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:34,703
I mean, yes.

239
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,288
I'm practically out the door here.

240
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,831
Did you get him the flashcards?

241
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,708
I did, Al.

242
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,251
Good. very good.

243
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:42,711
Well, good-bye, Deb.

244
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,720
Your father says good night.

245
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,734
Listen, uh, Doris,

246
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,362
I'm looking for a lake
called Splashy Lake.

247
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,863
Never heard of it.

248
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,240
Really?

249
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,242
Well, I went there as a kid.

250
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,786
It was more of
an amusement type of lake.

251
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:18,247
Paddle boats,
picnic tables, big slide.

252
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,248
Slide?

253
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:20,249
Yeah. This big slide

254
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,084
that you had to swim out to.

255
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,752
You'd go down this thing,

256
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,879
and it would send
you flying 10, 15 feet

257
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,130
out into the middle of the lake.

258
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,257
It was incredible... really.

259
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,385
There's a swimming pool
over in Neeterboro.

260
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,262
They've got a slide.

261
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,764
Oh. Ok.

262
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,266
Well, thank you, Doris.

263
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,268
Thank you. Have a nice day.

264
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,912
What the hell is this?

265
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:01,123
"Eddie's mix."

266
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:03,292
Mix of what?

267
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,975
Just a little drive, that's all.

268
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:05,187
I'm taking a drive down the road.

269
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:08,982
Life is a drive...

270
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,235
down the road.

271
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,362
Al Fountain...

272
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,322
Saturday,

273
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,241
June 30th...

274
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,369
9:55 a.m.

275
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,088
Here I come!

276
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,058
I'm gonna get you!

277
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,186
Mom! Mom!

278
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,980
Jackie's trying to spit on me!

279
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,691
Jackie, stop it right now.

280
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,318
Leave your sister alone.

281
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,736
Ok, mom.

282
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,321
I'm just gonna tickle her.

283
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,739
Come here, Candy.

284
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,824
No! Stop! Mom, he's still doing it.

285
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:41,742
Jackie,

286
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,203
If I have to get your father,

287
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,662
You won't eat tonight.

288
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,706
Come on!

289
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,707
Jackie!

290
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,835
Jackie, I'm going
to wake up your father.

291
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,712
Is that what you want?

292
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,888
Have you ever heard of a place

293
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,681
called splashy lake?

294
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:08,310
No, but there's a Splatchee Lake

295
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:10,229
50 miles east on 108.

296
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,606
Oh, how do you spell that?

297
00:21:12,658 --> 00:21:14,942
S-p-l-a-t-c-h- double e.

298
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,695
C-h-double e.

299
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,531
Splatchee, not splashy.

300
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:21,605
Is there paddle boats,

301
00:21:21,657 --> 00:21:24,034
picnic tables... A big slide?

302
00:21:24,086 --> 00:21:26,411
Oh, yeah. Lots of amusements.

303
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:27,360
I can't believe it.

304
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,873
I've been looking all over
for this place.

305
00:21:29,925 --> 00:21:31,208
I don't know why, really.

306
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,836
I spent a couple days there
when I was a kid,

307
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:36,839
And I just remember
having a great time.

308
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,257
Me, too.

309
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,884
My brother and I drowned
a cat there once.

310
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,261
Is that right?

311
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,346
Listen, how's the food across the street?

312
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:45,889
Best I ever ate.

313
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,266
Thank you.

314
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,320
That pie almost looks
homemade, doesn't it?

315
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,321
Mm-hmm.

316
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:05,242
It does look homemade.

317
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,086
More coffee?

318
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,796
No, thanks.

319
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,590
I get off in half an hour.

320
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:20,549
Thank god!

321
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:22,863
First thing I'm going to do

322
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:25,527
is take off all my clothes,

323
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,140
take a nice, long, hot shower.

324
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,309
That sounds good.

325
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,394
You staying over at the motel?

326
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,812
Actually, yes. I am.

327
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,898
How's the hot water over there?

328
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,316
I don't know.

329
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,902
I haven't tried it yet.

330
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,278
Why?

331
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,280
Just curious.

332
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:49,620
Just curious, huh?

333
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,330
If she's just curious,

334
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,124
why the hell doesn't she call the motel

335
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,919
and ask them how
the hot water is?

336
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,338
What does she think,

337
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:02,424
I was just gonna invite her over here

338
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,343
so she could take a shower?

339
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,945
Introducing our exciting
audiotape series,

340
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:23,862
heavenly faith.

341
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,365
Jesus is strong,
but he needs your help.

342
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,493
Send a check now payable
to Help-The-Lord Industries,

343
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:30,828
and you'll receive...

344
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,384
Hello.

345
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,469
I'm Varla, and I'm lonely.

346
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,012
Who are you?

347
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:49,888
Norman.

348
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,390
What a sexy name.

349
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:56,353
It's making me very hot
and horny just saying it.

350
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,355
Norman.

351
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,900
Wait, there's somebody at the door.

352
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:04,987
2 men rush in,
their eyes red with lust.

353
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,405
They rip my gown off,

354
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:09,992
exposing my naked body
to their evil gaze.

355
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,202
Just as they are about to ravish me,

356
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,371
I stick my fingers into their eyes

357
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,498
and rip out both their eyeballs.

358
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,875
Excuse me... Varla?

359
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:22,421
I'm sorry, but, uh...

360
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,882
This isn't too stimulating.

361
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,511
Oh, there's that doorbell again.

362
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:32,514
Oh, it's you...

363
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,392
Norman.

364
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,644
You stand there staring at me.

365
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:39,188
I'm totally naked

366
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:43,775
Except for 2 bleeding
human eyeballs in my hands.

367
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,153
You say, "Varla,

368
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:49,781
I have never before
seen a more beautiful,

369
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,701
hot, sexy woman."

370
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:55,704
Say it, Norman.

371
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:58,665
Say it now.

372
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:20,312
Ha ha ha!

373
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:23,357
Ha ha ha ha!

374
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,820
Ha ha ha!

375
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,877
It's not where you're going

376
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,963
but how you get there that counts.

377
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,464
Al Fountain.

378
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:48,882
Wait a second.

379
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:50,123
It's not how you get there

380
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:51,593
but where you're going that counts.

381
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:52,745
Is that right?

382
00:25:52,797 --> 00:25:53,842
Jesus Christ.

383
00:25:53,894 --> 00:25:54,888
What is it?

384
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,391
Well, wherever you're going,

385
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:59,351
I hope to Christ you get there!

386
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,353
Ha ha ha ha!

387
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,365
Oh!

388
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:39,451
It wouldn't be a very smart thing

389
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:40,953
for him to do.

390
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,998
Don't think he's gonna
go in, do you?

391
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,084
That's why I wanna talk
to him a little bit.

392
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,086
That wouldn't be a real good idea.

393
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,921
Hello, there.

394
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:53,841
You're not contemplating a swim, are you?

395
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,384
No, no. no, I'm not.

396
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,636
The wife thought you were going in.

397
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,097
There's a chemical plant
around that cove

398
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,602
Been dumping formaldehyde
in the lake for 15 years.

399
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:06,645
You step in,

400
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,772
and it'll burn your feet right off.

401
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:09,648
Jesus!

402
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,817
Thanks for telling me.

403
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,277
No problem.

404
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,363
Didn't wanna have to go in after you.

405
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,240
I'm Luvven Coddle.

406
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,741
This is my wife Wynelle.

407
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:20,742
Howdy.

408
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,411
Hi.

409
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,538
Al Fountain.

410
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,123
Pleased to meet you.

411
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:27,624
It is a nice day.

412
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,042
Yeah.

413
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,544
Can I ask you,

414
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:32,462
is everything all right, Al?

415
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:34,548
Oh, sure.

416
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,549
Everything's fine.

417
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:38,135
I haven't been here since I was a kid.

418
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:40,637
It's kind of a shock
to see it like this.

419
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,555
I can imagine.

420
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:45,142
But we're used to it.
We walk here every day.

421
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,060
I'm not used to it.

422
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,061
This was a beautiful lake.

423
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:51,023
You ever go down that slide, Al?

424
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,524
Yes, I did.

425
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,525
Me, too.

426
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:55,569
Just like flying, wasn't it?

427
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:58,155
Like a bird
out over that water.

428
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:00,657
That's exactly what it was like...

429
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:01,867
flying.

430
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:05,412
I remember
shooting down that slide and flying...

431
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,372
My God, it must have been...

432
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:09,291
Oh, 15, 20 feet.

433
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,398
Yeah! Right out into
the middle of the lake.

434
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,297
I remember my dad was yelling
for me to come in.

435
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,925
I pretended like I didn't hear him

436
00:29:17,966 --> 00:29:20,302
and just stayed out there.

437
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,930
And I kept on going down that slide

438
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:24,348
even though I knew

439
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,309
he was going to give it
to me soon as I got in.

440
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:32,439
What do you mean, give it to you, Al?

441
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,691
Well, he pulled down my suit
right here on the beach

442
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:37,595
and he spanked me
with this slide rule

443
00:29:37,647 --> 00:29:40,256
he always carried
around with him.

444
00:29:40,308 --> 00:29:42,866
I'm very sorry to hear that, Al.

445
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,451
It must have been...

446
00:29:44,503 --> 00:29:46,286
humiliating.

447
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:50,582
Al, can I ask you...

448
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,001
is there something
else troubling you?

449
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:56,870
Well, what do you mean?

450
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:59,341
Forgive me for prying, but I...

451
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:02,469
I sense a yearning in you,

452
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:05,389
A searching...

453
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,852
Almost as if you're lost.

454
00:30:09,935 --> 00:30:12,479
You've been lost for a long, long time.

455
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:14,356
Am I right?

456
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,868
Have you found Jesus, Al?

457
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:29,997
Why? Is he missing?

458
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,915
No. No, Al.

459
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:35,502
He's with us right now, right here.

460
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:37,379
Oh. I thought I saw somebody

461
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,381
walking on the water over there.

462
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:41,007
I don't think your salvation

463
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:42,551
is a laughing matter, Al.

464
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,682
Have a nice day.

465
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,893
Nice to meet you.

466
00:30:57,357 --> 00:30:59,401
Some people, man,
they got to stick their nose...

467
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,236
Why they can't just mind
their own...

468
00:31:01,288 --> 00:31:03,280
But no, that's not enough.

469
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:04,813
They have to just...

470
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,284
How about the salvation
of your ass, pal...

471
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,453
When I stick my foot up it?

472
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,163
Holy...

473
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,789
Aah!

474
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:22,883
Wow!

475
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:25,802
That was great, man.

476
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:26,845
You all right?

477
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,347
For crying out loud,

478
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:30,432
what the hell were you doing?

479
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:31,350
What do you mean?

480
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:34,436
Stopping on a blind curve like this!

481
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,940
You almost got us both killed!

482
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,859
Oh, man... I'm sorry.

483
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,946
My car just died on me right here.

484
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:46,365
I can't even move it. I...

485
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:48,492
You know anything about engines?

486
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:51,359
Yeah, a little bit.

487
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,831
Well, I already checked her out.

488
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:56,375
I'm pretty sure it's the gasket.

489
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,836
Could be that dang
carburetor, though.

490
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,005
Think you could
take a look at her?

491
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:03,841
All right. Out of the way.

492
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:09,847
Oh, God.

493
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,890
Hey, what are you doing?

494
00:32:11,974 --> 00:32:13,851
Be careful with that.

495
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,592
Uh, you got trouble, pal.

496
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:17,020
- Gasket, right?
- No, no, no, no.

497
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:18,527
It's the distributor.

498
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:19,982
The drive gear's broken.

499
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:22,234
This car's going nowhere.

500
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,362
Oh, shit!

501
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:27,218
Oh, shit!

502
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,448
Shit, shit!

503
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:31,535
Hey, uh, what are we gonna do?

504
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:35,278
What are we going to do?

505
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,749
You're not gonna just
leave me out here, are you?

506
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:40,169
I'll drive you to a service station,
all right?

507
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:43,964
Wh-what about the car?

508
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:45,883
You'll just have to leave it.

509
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,885
No. I gotta get her home.

510
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:50,053
And how do you propose to do that?

511
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:53,390
I got a chain in my trunk.

512
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:08,906
There you go, man.

513
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:09,948
Slap that on her.

514
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,910
Better lock it. Could pop off.

515
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,913
I assume you've got the key.

516
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,539
Shit! Shit, Shit!

517
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:18,457
Goddamn it!

518
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:20,542
What did you tell me to lock it for?

519
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,544
Of course I got a key, man!

520
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:24,463
Ha ha ha!

521
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,548
What do you fucking think?

522
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:27,466
Hey, come on.

523
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:30,093
We got to figure out
who's gonna drive.

524
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:30,969
What do you mean?

525
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,805
Someone's gotta ride
the brake back here,

526
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:36,558
But I know the road
better than you do.

527
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:37,935
It gets a little tricky.

528
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:40,020
I thought you said
you lived down the road.

529
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,980
Yeah, just up the road
a couple, few miles

530
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:43,982
Through the woods.

531
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:47,611
All right. You drive...

532
00:33:47,663 --> 00:33:48,852
But be careful.

533
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:49,895
That's a rented car,

534
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:51,490
and I'm responsible for it.

535
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,242
Hey, I hear that.

536
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:55,494
Oh, name's Bucky, by the way.

537
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,454
Some people call me the kid

538
00:33:57,538 --> 00:33:59,456
or, uh, you can call me kid.

539
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:01,500
Al Fountain.

540
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,033
All right, Al. Like a fountain, huh?

541
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:04,962
That's great. Listen,
I really appreciate this.

542
00:34:05,014 --> 00:34:05,744
Ok. Let's get going

543
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:08,215
'cause I've gotta be
someplace, all right?

544
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:09,132
All right. Thanks, Al.

545
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:10,467
Don't trip.

546
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:17,015
Rental, huh?

547
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,476
Ah, I like these babies.

548
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,110
Jesus Christ!

549
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,903
Whoa! Man!

550
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,530
Ha ha ha!

551
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:34,116
That is some weird shit, Al.

552
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,993
Let's get going!

553
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,540
Easy!

554
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:10,194
What is this pigpen?
Winston cigarettes?

555
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:12,571
Cigarette?

556
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,532
It's not funny. It's disgusting.

557
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,578
Hey, how much further?

558
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:21,580
Ha!

559
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:31,775
Oh, man, I'm beat!

560
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:40,909
Well, here we are, Al.

561
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:42,244
You live here?

562
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:44,288
Yup. I own my own home.

563
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:46,456
It ain't much,
but I'm off the grid, man.

564
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:47,541
That's what counts. Come on in.

565
00:36:47,593 --> 00:36:48,917
I'll turn on some lights.

566
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:50,711
Look, just get the key
and unlock these cars.

567
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,297
I've still gotta find a motel.

568
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:55,799
Well...

569
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,301
I'll tell you, man.

570
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:01,805
Nearest one is a truck stop
whorehouse off exit 58.

571
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:03,307
Hell, you can stay here.

572
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,476
No, I can't. I've got an important
phone call to make.

573
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:08,343
Well, shit, I got a phone.

574
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,814
You can use it while I get the key.

575
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:26,330
Kid?

576
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:30,334
Kid, where are you?

577
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:35,964
What the hell happened here?

578
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:36,840
What?

579
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,675
What's the matter?

580
00:37:38,717 --> 00:37:40,344
What do you mean?

581
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,971
Where's the rest of your house?

582
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:44,848
Oh, I only bought half.

583
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:46,850
I got a really good deal.

584
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,478
Listen, the phone's right there.

585
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,854
When you use it,

586
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:51,855
Only talk for 1 minute,

587
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,857
'cause I'm tapped in illegal,

588
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,984
And anything longer
they can trace.

589
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:57,361
Christ almighty!

590
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:59,488
All that driving wore me out.

591
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,406
I'm hitting the sack, ok?

592
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,200
You can have the bed. Ok?

593
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:04,868
Hey! Hey, wait a second.

594
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,870
No, no. I want you to have it.

595
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,997
You drove me home.
The least I can do.

596
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,500
Hey! Hey, Buck... Give me the key.

597
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,001
Kid! Hey!

598
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,378
The key!

599
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,880
Where's the key?

600
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,382
Yeah.

601
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:39,903
Hi, Deb. It's Al.

602
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:42,531
Al! I'm so glad you called.

603
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:43,365
Where are you?

604
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:45,909
Remember I told you
I was going fishing?

605
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:48,036
We're all in a little
cabin together.

606
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:49,361
That sounds great.

607
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:51,363
Are you having a good time?

608
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:54,001
Great time.
Listen, some good news.

609
00:38:54,053 --> 00:38:55,534
We're ahead of schedule,

610
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:58,130
and it looks like
I'll be coming home early.

611
00:38:58,182 --> 00:38:59,464
Al, that's great!

612
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:02,092
So we can have a 4th of July.

613
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,926
It looks that way.

614
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,554
I can't wait to see you, Deb.

615
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:06,743
And now I should go.

616
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:07,890
Here, say hi to Bobby.

617
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:09,933
Hi, dad.

618
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:11,435
Hi, Bob. what's up?

619
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,562
Dad, are the little
fireworks illegal...

620
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,272
The real little ones?

621
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:16,304
They sure are, Bob.

622
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:17,900
All fireworks are illegal.

623
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:19,171
I was just checking.

624
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,235
Good night, dad.

625
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:21,528
Good night.

626
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:49,056
Huh?

627
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:55,927
Morning.

628
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:56,897
What the hell was that?

629
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:58,190
M-80.

630
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:01,276
Them suckers pack a wallop,
don't they?

631
00:40:01,328 --> 00:40:04,034
I got the cars unlocked.
Come on, man.

632
00:40:04,086 --> 00:40:06,740
Get some breakfast
before you take off.

633
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,919
How long have you lived here?

634
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:20,337
Oh...

635
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,257
I've been off the grid now about 3 years.

636
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:25,791
Dig in there...

637
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,761
Before it gets mushy.

638
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:29,763
I know what you're
saying, though.

639
00:40:29,815 --> 00:40:31,181
The place could use
a little work.

640
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,476
You see, I'm kind of
in a mediary stage.

641
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:37,145
I want to go total
self-sufficient...

642
00:40:37,197 --> 00:40:39,778
Solar power, windmill...

643
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,307
Generate my own electricity.

644
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,319
You know anything
about that stuff?

645
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:46,280
Yeah, I know something about it.

646
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,282
You see that?
I could tell you had a knack

647
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:49,867
for things mechanical.

648
00:40:49,919 --> 00:40:51,243
What do you do?

649
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:53,287
I'm an electrical
engineer, actually...

650
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,497
specializing in field installation

651
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:57,791
Of Zeus Turbine Generators.

652
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:58,834
No shit?

653
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:01,503
I bet you'd even
know how to change

654
00:41:01,555 --> 00:41:02,713
a distributor drive gear.

655
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:04,548
Am I right?

656
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:07,843
Listen, kid or Buck
or whatever your name is...

657
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:10,804
I went out of my way
to get you home last night.

658
00:41:10,846 --> 00:41:12,764
Now I'm badly behind schedule.

659
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:15,309
I'll drop you off
at the nearest garage,

660
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,187
And after that, you're on your own.

661
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,315
That's fine by me, Al.

662
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:22,232
Really.

663
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:25,194
That's fine.

664
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:44,087
What's with the costume, Buck?

665
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:47,591
How did you know it was a costume?

666
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:49,092
Is it?

667
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:50,636
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

668
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,429
I was an actor for a while...

669
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,223
In this play about Davy Crockett

670
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:55,641
In the olden days.

671
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:57,226
You played Davy Crockett?

672
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:58,143
Yeah.

673
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:00,395
No, I mean, I played some guy

674
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:02,220
standing around with a rifle,

675
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:04,900
but one night I tried
on Davy's costume,

676
00:42:05,275 --> 00:42:07,152
and it fit me so perfect,

677
00:42:07,204 --> 00:42:08,862
I just took it.

678
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,729
You stole it?

679
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:13,700
Pull up a second here, Al, will you?

680
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:21,625
Hold on a second.

681
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:30,676
Hey, there, Mr. Freaky.

682
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:32,010
You been waiting for me?

683
00:42:32,062 --> 00:42:32,886
All righty, then.

684
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,638
Let's get something to eat.

685
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,723
You gained a little
weight there, huh?

686
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:38,517
Eating them apple pies.

687
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:40,269
All right. There you go.

688
00:42:40,321 --> 00:42:41,687
Unh!

689
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,105
Ok!

690
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,110
What's going on?

691
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:50,112
Oh, a little business.
I'm in salvage, Al...

692
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:51,738
specializing in field installation

693
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,740
of ceramic lawn ornaments.

694
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,524
Uh-huh.

695
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:56,618
Do you know those folks?

696
00:42:56,743 --> 00:42:57,556
Oh, yeah.

697
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:58,318
Hey, there!

698
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,278
Yeah, I like that dress... real fine!

699
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,915
I'm going to come back
for the squirrels, too.

700
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:04,418
Take care, now!

701
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:06,170
All right.

702
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:08,297
Anytime you wanna move on
is fine by me, Al.

703
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:09,673
Ok.

704
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:13,260
When was the last you ordered anything?

705
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:14,678
Oh, shut up.

706
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,263
I ordered you that
goddamn robe, didn't I?

707
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,155
Yeah!

708
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,159
Hey, Lyle! good buddy!

709
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,206
What the fuck do you want?

710
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:43,790
Oh, I blew my distributor, man.

711
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,209
This is my friend, Al.

712
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,002
He'll tell you exactly what kind.

713
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:48,712
I need a distributor drive gear

714
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:52,174
For a '67 ford galaxy with a 390 v-8.

715
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:55,677
Isn't he great?

716
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:57,262
He's my buddy.

717
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:58,764
Yeah, that guy,

718
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:02,184
He's one of the best damn
mechanics in the state.

719
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:10,108
Hey, Wick!

720
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,235
Hey, Doob!

721
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,195
What the hell is shaking?

722
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:14,738
My left nut.

723
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,199
Ha ha ha! Mine, too.

724
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:18,826
Hey, what are you guys
doing for the 4th?

725
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,286
Anything going on? Any parties?

726
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:23,372
Let's get this fan belt
and get the hell out of here.

727
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:24,748
$40.

728
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,708
That the right one, Al?

729
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,262
You throw that match at me?

730
00:44:39,388 --> 00:44:40,597
No, Wick.

731
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:42,432
Yeah, he did.

732
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:43,215
No, I didn't.

733
00:44:43,267 --> 00:44:44,299
I just threw it down.

734
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:45,936
I was just throwing down
a match, that's all.

735
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:48,730
Don't you ever do that again.

736
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:50,774
I won't, Wick.

737
00:44:50,816 --> 00:44:54,862
Hey, where'd you get
the fucking hat?

738
00:44:54,903 --> 00:44:55,779
Ha!

739
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:57,364
All right, I'm out of here.

740
00:44:57,406 --> 00:44:58,323
Thanks a lot, Lyle.

741
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,243
Wick, Doob... you guys
take it easy, now.

742
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:08,876
I really appreciate this, Al.

743
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,294
All right.
Give me the wrench.

744
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:13,714
I'm gonna take a course
or something on auto repair.

745
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:16,070
A driver should
know his car, Buck.

746
00:45:16,122 --> 00:45:18,302
You see this bolt. It goes on last.

747
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,305
Start her up.

748
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:24,266
Pump the gas once when I say go.

749
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:30,272
Go!

750
00:45:32,858 --> 00:45:34,318
Look at that!

751
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:36,048
You're a goddamn wizard, Al!

752
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,738
All right. Turn it off now.

753
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:42,826
Great.

754
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:44,453
I got a customer, Al.

755
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:46,788
Be right back.

756
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:50,918
Hey, there, Navajo.

757
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:52,294
Hey, kid.

758
00:45:52,377 --> 00:45:54,129
How you doing, Jim?

759
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:55,839
What do you got for me?

760
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:57,424
I got this beauty here, man.

761
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:59,801
Check it out.

762
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:01,345
What do you think?

763
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:03,430
Man! it's got a nice set of forelegs.

764
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:04,348
Yeah. right.

765
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:05,849
Nice chest. Nice mouth.

766
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:07,309
You got that 60 for me?

767
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:08,936
One hell of a set
of nice antlers here.

768
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:09,853
Yeah.

769
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,438
I think I'll take it.

770
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,815
All right!

771
00:46:13,899 --> 00:46:15,359
Watch your back, now.

772
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,944
That's why I got such a big...

773
00:46:16,985 --> 00:46:19,154
watch that head, there.

774
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:20,562
That'll do you, man.

775
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:22,115
All right. That's good, man.

776
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:24,827
Take care, Navajo.

777
00:46:24,868 --> 00:46:26,578
Take care.

778
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,288
All right.

779
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:40,008
What's the matter?

780
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,009
No receipt?

781
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:41,885
What for?

782
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:45,389
So you can calculate your income
when you pay your taxes.

783
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:46,890
Taxes?

784
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,892
Are you fucking crazy?

785
00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:50,978
I never paid taxes in my life,

786
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:51,895
and I never will.

787
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:54,857
I tore up my goddamn
social security card.

788
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,400
I got none of that shit now.

789
00:46:56,441 --> 00:46:58,110
Hell, I don't even have
a driver's license.

790
00:46:58,162 --> 00:46:58,944
Wait a second.

791
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,364
You're driving without a license?

792
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:03,407
I told you, man.

793
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:04,908
I'm off the fucking grid!

794
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:06,994
Your off your f... nut.

795
00:47:07,035 --> 00:47:09,496
You get in an accident
and you injure somebody,

796
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:11,415
You're going to jail...

797
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:14,501
Especially if you're
driving intoxicated

798
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:17,880
With a carload of illegal fireworks.

799
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:20,757
God, you're... You're right, Al.

800
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:22,134
I don't know what I was thinking.

801
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:23,969
I feel really stupid.

802
00:47:24,469 --> 00:47:25,929
Well, it's your life, Buck,

803
00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,890
And frankly,
it's none of my business.

804
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:28,891
Now, listen,

805
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:30,893
Is there someplace
I can get washed up?

806
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:33,020
Yeah. there's a big pool
back in the woods.

807
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:34,396
That's where I take a bath.

808
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:35,439
Plus it's great swimming.

809
00:47:35,481 --> 00:47:37,524
I am not talking swimming.
I wanna get washed up,

810
00:47:37,566 --> 00:47:39,026
And I wanna get back on the road.

811
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:40,486
That's what I'm saying, Al.

812
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:41,904
You jump in, you get cleaned up,

813
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:42,905
And you take off.

814
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:45,908
All right. Let me get my shirt.

815
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,702
Distributor drive gear,

816
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:49,745
Distributor drive gear.

817
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:50,704
I gotta learn a bit.

818
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:53,332
It gets complicated in my brain.

819
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:55,334
You know, I can't...

820
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,211
Hey!

821
00:47:57,252 --> 00:47:59,213
All right!

822
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,715
Here she is, Al.

823
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:05,302
The water leans a bit to the cool side,

824
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:06,720
But the Indians say

825
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,096
it's good for your skin tone.

826
00:48:08,148 --> 00:48:09,081
What Indians?

827
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:10,015
Crowsfeet.

828
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:11,934
They lived in this valley
for centuries.

829
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:13,508
Crowsfeet?

830
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,104
They were the first Indians
to tame the wild dog.

831
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:17,397
Is that a fact?

832
00:48:17,449 --> 00:48:18,190
Yup.

833
00:48:18,774 --> 00:48:20,818
I been studying all
about that stuff, Al.

834
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:24,321
This is the best way in right here.

835
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:29,576
You're not gonna wear any underwear?

836
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:30,494
What for?

837
00:48:30,536 --> 00:48:33,455
There may be someone
in the vicinity.

838
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:35,457
Ha ha ha ha!

839
00:48:36,542 --> 00:48:39,503
Oh, yeah!

840
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:46,343
Hey, come on in, Al!

841
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:48,679
How do you get out?

842
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:50,973
There's a rope.

843
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:52,599
Yeah. You just climb up.

844
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:54,059
Ok. Look out.

845
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:55,477
Here I come.

846
00:49:09,575 --> 00:49:11,118
Not bad, huh?

847
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,035
No.

848
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:14,496
It feels pretty good, actually.

849
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,998
See? there's little fishies.

850
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:17,499
Whoo!

851
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:21,086
This is a nice little spot, buck.

852
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:24,173
Yeah. not many people
know about it, I guess.

853
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:27,009
Most of the time,
I have it to myself.

854
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:33,557
Caw! caw!

855
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,851
Hey, where are we going?

856
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:38,061
I've gotta get out of here.

857
00:49:39,104 --> 00:49:42,149
I thought you said
this was a shortcut.

858
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:45,694
Well, I never really timed it, Al.

859
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:48,030
Just always seemed shorter.

860
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:51,783
Mmm!

861
00:49:52,201 --> 00:49:53,744
Mmm!

862
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:57,789
Nothing like a tomato
right off the vine, Al.

863
00:49:58,165 --> 00:49:59,791
Go ahead. Try one.

864
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:01,418
Whose are they?

865
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:05,047
Some old guy.
He don't give a shit.

866
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,049
I'm gonna take a leak.

867
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:14,556
Goddamn, I got to piss.

868
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:44,086
Life is a tomato right off the vine.

869
00:50:46,171 --> 00:50:48,131
Al Fountain...

870
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:50,217
Monday, July 2nd...

871
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,677
4:32 p.m.

872
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,095
Hey, Al!

873
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:55,389
Ha ha ha!

874
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,015
Sorry, Al. I thought you'd duck.

875
00:50:57,099 --> 00:51:00,102
You little fucking bastard!

876
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:02,020
Aah!

877
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:04,982
Aah!

878
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,441
Ok!

879
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:07,776
Aah!

880
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:08,777
We're even.

881
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:09,862
Yeah, that's cool.

882
00:51:09,945 --> 00:51:11,405
Sucker! yeah!

883
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:12,781
Chicken!

884
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:14,116
Oh, he's running!

885
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:15,784
There he goes.

886
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,748
All right.

887
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:26,837
Ok. wait!

888
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:28,213
Wait. Ok. wait!

889
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:29,590
Wait for what?

890
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:30,841
Wait for this!

891
00:51:30,883 --> 00:51:32,926
Direct hit. Direct hit.

892
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:33,927
You're dead.

893
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:35,637
Ok!

894
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:37,264
Yaah!

895
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:41,643
Big shot!

896
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:43,270
Big man, huh?

897
00:51:43,353 --> 00:51:44,688
Aah!

898
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,690
Whoa! There he goes.

899
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:49,401
Time out. Get your ammo...

900
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:50,444
in your face, buddy!

901
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:51,820
Unh!

902
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,447
That's right!

903
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,698
Ow!

904
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,824
Yeah!

905
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:57,159
Now he's running.

906
00:51:57,242 --> 00:51:58,452
Double-barrel action.

907
00:51:58,535 --> 00:52:00,287
Ok.

908
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:01,788
Ha ha ha!

909
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:03,832
There! Ow!

910
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:04,958
That's a man's throw.

911
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:06,335
Time out!

912
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,421
Another one.

913
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:10,714
Ow! ow!

914
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:11,882
Ah!

915
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:12,966
You all right?

916
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:13,884
Ohh!

917
00:52:13,926 --> 00:52:15,427
Did I get you in the kidneys?

918
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:16,345
Ha ha!

919
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:18,347
All right now, boys.

920
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,307
Come on up out of there.

921
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,975
Jesus Christ! It's the police!

922
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:23,810
Shh! Shh!

923
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:26,313
I thought you said nobody
cared about these tomatoes!

924
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:27,397
There they are.

925
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:29,316
They're right down there.
I can see them.

926
00:52:29,368 --> 00:52:30,484
Let's go, boys.

927
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:34,154
I can see one of you's
white shirt plain as day...

928
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:35,697
So why don't you just stand on up,

929
00:52:35,906 --> 00:52:37,950
And let's get this over with?

930
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:39,368
The hell you doing?

931
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:40,953
What are you doing?
Take the shirt off!

932
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:43,330
Take the shirt off!

933
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:44,998
What's the matter with you?

934
00:52:45,082 --> 00:52:46,208
All right.

935
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:47,376
Give me that.

936
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:50,838
Stay down!

937
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:52,840
Get down! Get down!

938
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:55,384
Crawl. Crawl. Come on.

939
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:57,970
I can't when you're on top of me!

940
00:52:58,011 --> 00:53:00,472
Get going, quick. Move! Come on!

941
00:53:00,556 --> 00:53:02,724
Just move! Move! Come on.

942
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:04,893
Goddamn these little kids!

943
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:07,688
Why can't they just leave
people's property alone?

944
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,064
They aren't their tomatoes.

945
00:53:09,116 --> 00:53:09,971
Yeah, they know that.

946
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:11,984
But no, no. They gonna come in here

947
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,111
and waste my time
with this froufrou shit.

948
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:17,406
I think I recognize
the one in that white shirt.

949
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:18,949
All right, boys.

950
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:22,119
You're going to force me
to do something nasty here.

951
00:53:22,171 --> 00:53:23,537
I'm gonna bend you both over...

952
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:24,496
Get the hell out of here.

953
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:25,414
Wait. Wait.

954
00:53:25,455 --> 00:53:27,040
...and take my night stick to you.

955
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:28,417
Wait a minute. Stay here.

956
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,419
Just stay right there.

957
00:53:32,462 --> 00:53:33,422
All right, boys.

958
00:53:33,463 --> 00:53:35,424
I'm getting tired of this shit.

959
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:42,097
Are you coming out or not?

960
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:45,559
Don't look like they is.

961
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:48,937
Are you coming or not?

962
00:53:53,984 --> 00:53:55,194
Aah!

963
00:53:55,277 --> 00:53:56,403
Whoa!

964
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:58,405
Goddamn it, Floyd!

965
00:53:58,489 --> 00:54:00,032
You stupid son of a bitch!

966
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:01,867
Get the car!

967
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,577
Look out, boys!

968
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,078
Stand up!

969
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,456
Run!

970
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:16,465
Oh, Jesus!

971
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:19,009
Jesus! God! We've killed them!

972
00:54:19,051 --> 00:54:21,512
It just ran right over them.

973
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:23,931
Well, I'll call for a medic.

974
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:32,272
Where are they?

975
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:33,982
Are they alive?

976
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:36,485
I'm sorry, Al. Really.

977
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:38,612
I was just trying
to create us a diversion

978
00:54:38,654 --> 00:54:40,531
so we could get away.
That's an old Indian trick.

979
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:41,949
Yeah? well, let me
tell you something, buck.

980
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:44,493
That little trick of yours
almost killed an old man

981
00:54:44,545 --> 00:54:45,994
And 2 officers of the law.

982
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:47,996
Do you think that's funny?

983
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,164
I never thought of it that way.

984
00:54:49,206 --> 00:54:50,165
You're absolutely right.

985
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,458
It was stupid.

986
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:53,794
You must think I'm a worthless
fucking piece of shit.

987
00:54:53,846 --> 00:54:55,660
Look, buck, I like you,

988
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:57,756
but I have got to
tell you something.

989
00:54:58,674 --> 00:54:59,790
I think it's time

990
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:01,301
you got your life squared away.

991
00:55:01,353 --> 00:55:02,135
I think you're right, Al.

992
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:03,887
Well, good-bye and good luck.

993
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:06,160
All right.

994
00:55:06,212 --> 00:55:07,599
Al, good-bye.

995
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,854
For Christ's sake...

996
00:55:11,937 --> 00:55:13,522
Where the hell...

997
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:15,023
are the keys?

998
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:16,984
What? The car keys?

999
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:18,527
Yes. The car keys.

1000
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:20,028
All right. Hold on, Al.

1001
00:55:20,112 --> 00:55:21,864
When did you last have them?

1002
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:23,699
When I drove you into town.

1003
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,076
Ok. Well, let's think.

1004
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:28,162
We got back.
You got out of the car.

1005
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:30,122
What did you do with the keys?

1006
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:31,915
I thought I left them in the car.

1007
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:33,417
Might you have put them
in your pocket?

1008
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,002
I might have... yes.

1009
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:36,535
Goddamn it!

1010
00:55:36,587 --> 00:55:37,921
I bet they fell out
when you were running around

1011
00:55:37,973 --> 00:55:38,881
in that tomato field.

1012
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:40,831
Oh, Christ!

1013
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:43,177
All right. Now, take it easy.
Take it easy, Al.

1014
00:55:43,229 --> 00:55:44,960
First light... Crack of dawn...

1015
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:47,431
we go back to that field
and find those goddamn keys.

1016
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:48,672
Crack of dawn?

1017
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:50,267
I have got to get going!

1018
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:51,857
I know you do, Al,

1019
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:53,395
and I'm damn sorry.

1020
00:55:55,564 --> 00:55:57,483
I feel responsible.

1021
00:55:59,568 --> 00:56:01,945
You're still there?

1022
00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:03,895
Hey, don't think
I'm happy about this.

1023
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:07,159
I wanted to get the hell
out of here yesterday.

1024
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:10,454
I just bought $60 worth
of groceries for a cookout.

1025
00:56:10,537 --> 00:56:13,957
You and Bob get started,
and I'll try to be there.

1026
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,459
Don't let him start the fire.

1027
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,961
Now, how's he doing
with the flashcards?

1028
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:20,964
I'll let him tell you.

1029
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,592
4 pounds of chicken and $60 later.

1030
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:25,969
Here's your dad.

1031
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:26,970
Hi, dad.

1032
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:28,597
Thanks for the flash cards.

1033
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,098
They're really helping a lot.

1034
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,600
Good. I told you they would.

1035
00:56:31,642 --> 00:56:33,477
What's 12 times 8?

1036
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:38,273
Bob?

1037
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:39,483
Uh, 15?

1038
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:42,486
Listen, Bob,
I'm gonna let you go now

1039
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:45,614
because it sounds like you've
still got a lot of work to do.

1040
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:47,115
Thanks, dad. Good night.

1041
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:48,992
Good night.

1042
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:52,079
That's right, man!

1043
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,997
'cause he did it!

1044
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:57,125
The little Cubano is tough, Norm.

1045
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,001
Yeah!

1046
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:00,546
Uncle Samson!

1047
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:03,006
Oh, come on!

1048
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,508
Hey.

1049
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,009
Dig in, man.

1050
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:08,095
Save some room for dessert.

1051
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:10,138
<i>There goes the Castroator.</i>

1052
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,640
<i>He's in action now!</i>

1053
00:57:11,682 --> 00:57:13,016
Like wrestling, Al?

1054
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,144
I like college
or high school wrestling,

1055
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:16,520
Not this garbage.

1056
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:18,689
Hey, this ain't
no high school shit.

1057
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:19,940
This is professional wrestling.

1058
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:21,150
That's my guy right there...

1059
00:57:21,191 --> 00:57:22,651
Uncle Samson...

1060
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:24,027
Ranked number one

1061
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:26,029
By the PWP and the WPW both.

1062
00:57:26,113 --> 00:57:28,157
He's fighting some
Cuban guy from Cuba.

1063
00:57:28,198 --> 00:57:30,033
I feel for Sam now.

1064
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:32,161
This is a sad day for Uncle Sam.

1065
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:34,037
Ooh! Oh, no! Look out!

1066
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,123
Get away from there!

1067
00:57:36,165 --> 00:57:38,083
You greasy bastard!

1068
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:41,044
Come on! Get away from there!

1069
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:44,047
Yeah!

1070
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:45,549
You go, Sam!

1071
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:48,051
I don't believe it! I can't watch.

1072
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:51,680
Sam's coming back.
Look out, Castroator!

1073
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:53,682
What did I tell you, Al?

1074
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:55,058
Tough, isn't he?

1075
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:58,187
Shaking off a blow
to the head like that!

1076
00:57:58,228 --> 00:58:00,022
You know it's all fake, don't you?

1077
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,846
What is?

1078
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:02,055
The whole thing...

1079
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:03,525
The kicks, the punches,
the chair smashing...

1080
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:05,777
They plan out every fight...

1081
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:07,946
who's going to win
and who's going to lose.

1082
00:58:07,998 --> 00:58:09,072
It's all fake.

1083
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:11,575
Everybody knows that.

1084
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,485
Uh, Al, I know you're smart

1085
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:17,623
'cause you got
a scientific-style job,

1086
00:58:17,675 --> 00:58:19,166
but you're not using common sense.

1087
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:20,490
If this fight is fake

1088
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:22,534
and everybody knows it's fake,

1089
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:24,796
Why in the hell would
anybody waste their time

1090
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:26,089
sitting around watching it?

1091
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:31,720
That's a question you might
want to answer one day, Buck.

1092
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:34,097
I know the answer.

1093
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:37,226
This is what's happening
all over America, Al.

1094
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:39,102
This country's being taken over

1095
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,146
By smart people with no common sense.

1096
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:42,981
And that's why I'm out here, man.

1097
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:44,775
Just me, my instincts, and nature.

1098
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:46,610
That's all you need.

1099
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:49,154
You see that moon up there?

1100
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:51,156
Look at that moon!

1101
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,647
Shit, in the city

1102
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:55,244
you wouldn't even
be able to see that!

1103
00:58:55,786 --> 00:58:57,611
The three-quarter moon,

1104
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:01,083
just about to slip
into its second phase.

1105
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:03,126
Well, I don't know about that, Al.

1106
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,629
The Indians call that
a creamy corn moon.

1107
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,062
What are you thinking about, Al?

1108
00:59:23,063 --> 00:59:24,857
Well, it's kind of hard to say this,

1109
00:59:24,909 --> 00:59:27,151
but I've, uh...

1110
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:30,195
started seeing things.

1111
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:31,155
Oh.

1112
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:34,783
What kind of things
are you seeing, huh?

1113
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:37,661
Well, I'm seeing things moving...

1114
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:40,205
backwards.

1115
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:43,292
Like, someone pouring
a cup of coffee,

1116
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:46,336
I'll see the coffee
flowing out of the cup

1117
00:59:46,378 --> 00:59:47,796
back into the pot.

1118
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,173
Are you serious?

1119
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:51,216
Yes. And other things, too.

1120
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:54,803
I saw a kid riding a bike,
pedaling just like normal,

1121
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:56,805
Except he was moving backwards.

1122
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:58,724
Jesus, that's wild, man.

1123
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:01,810
Yeah. well, I'm a little worried, actually.

1124
01:00:01,862 --> 01:00:04,589
I never know when
it's going to happen.

1125
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:07,316
Well, listen, Al, don't worry about it.

1126
01:00:07,357 --> 01:00:08,692
That's the main thing.

1127
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:11,320
You know, the Indians
saw shit all the time.

1128
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:13,353
They had visions 24 hours a day.

1129
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,386
You think they worried
about it? Hell, no.

1130
01:00:15,438 --> 01:00:17,367
And don't worry about
them car keys, either.

1131
01:00:17,419 --> 01:00:18,275
We'll find them.

1132
01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:20,746
I know right where to look, ok?

1133
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:23,540
Hey.

1134
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:26,835
Look what that moon's
doing over here.

1135
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:28,712
Oh, watch this.

1136
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:35,344
Now I got a little box of moonlight.

1137
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:36,720
See that, Al?

1138
01:00:36,803 --> 01:00:39,723
See what I did there?

1139
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:52,820
How's that hangover, Al?
It's gone, right?

1140
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:54,696
Well, it's starting to go.

1141
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,366
I told you, man. It's this water.

1142
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:59,243
Funny about them keys, huh?

1143
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,161
I thought sure we'd find them.

1144
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:02,955
I've got another plan, kid.

1145
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:04,477
I'll call the rental office

1146
01:01:04,529 --> 01:01:06,015
when we get back to the house.

1147
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:07,449
They'll call a local locksmith,

1148
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:10,671
give them the key code
for the model number of my car,

1149
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:12,381
and I'll have a new
set of keys delivered

1150
01:01:12,433 --> 01:01:14,174
in less than an hour.

1151
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,261
Damn, man. That's a great idea.

1152
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:19,096
Why the hell didn't I think of that?

1153
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:20,889
It's called planning ahead, kid.

1154
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:23,142
You should try it sometime.

1155
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:25,352
Hey, hey, hey. Look at this.

1156
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:26,770
Whoa.

1157
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:27,771
What is it?

1158
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:30,858
Yeah. someone was here yesterday.

1159
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:32,776
Mm-hmm.

1160
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:35,779
"size 5.

1161
01:01:35,821 --> 01:01:38,407
100% cotton."

1162
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:39,783
Mm-hmm.

1163
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:43,287
She's 15...

1164
01:01:43,328 --> 01:01:44,788
She's redhead...

1165
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:47,416
Either a cheerleader
or a swimsuit model.

1166
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:50,335
- Get the hell out of here.
- No, no. I'm serious. Smell.

1167
01:01:50,387 --> 01:01:53,380
I'm not going to smell
somebody's underwear.

1168
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:55,883
Come on, smell.
I'll show you something.

1169
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,508
- Smell that?
- What?

1170
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,292
A kind of dry mustard smell

1171
01:02:09,344 --> 01:02:12,024
mixed with, like, a bubblegum.

1172
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:16,820
Smell?

1173
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:18,822
Mm-hmm. Keep sniffing.

1174
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:20,282
Keep sniffing.

1175
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:21,450
I don't smell anything.

1176
01:02:21,492 --> 01:02:22,409
Sure you do.

1177
01:02:22,461 --> 01:02:23,275
I don't.

1178
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:24,766
Oh, come on, man!

1179
01:02:24,818 --> 01:02:26,153
Your senses are gone!

1180
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:28,321
To my nose, it's overpowering.

1181
01:02:28,373 --> 01:02:30,292
You see that?
That's called sensory attunement.

1182
01:02:30,344 --> 01:02:32,007
You should try that sometime.

1183
01:02:32,059 --> 01:02:33,670
Ok. I'll start sniffing underwear

1184
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:35,881
Every chance I get, All right?

1185
01:02:35,923 --> 01:02:38,342
Let's head on back.
I have a call to make.

1186
01:02:38,383 --> 01:02:40,594
Oh, that's right.
Gotta get those new keys

1187
01:02:40,636 --> 01:02:42,429
so you can get the heck
out of here.

1188
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:50,103
It's not where you're going in life.

1189
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:52,189
It's how you get
the hell out of there.

1190
01:02:52,241 --> 01:02:53,607
What's that, Al?

1191
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:55,234
Where the hell are these people

1192
01:02:55,286 --> 01:02:57,569
at 12:00 in the afternoon?

1193
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:02,115
I don't know. Lunch?
Try them in an hour.

1194
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,222
Is that gun loaded?

1195
01:03:04,274 --> 01:03:05,494
You bet your ass it is.

1196
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:07,371
You think I'm gonna let them F.B.I.

1197
01:03:07,423 --> 01:03:08,940
sneak up on me?

1198
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:10,405
No fucking way.

1199
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:12,491
Well, just be careful with it.

1200
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:15,546
Hey, I know how
to handle a gun, ok?

1201
01:03:15,598 --> 01:03:16,505
Do you?

1202
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:18,465
I've shot a gun before.

1203
01:03:18,517 --> 01:03:19,383
Good.

1204
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,844
Let's go get me a rabbit or something.

1205
01:03:21,896 --> 01:03:22,667
I'm fucking starving.

1206
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:26,056
No, kid.
I have to make this call, all right?

1207
01:03:26,682 --> 01:03:28,225
We come back in an hour,

1208
01:03:28,277 --> 01:03:29,961
you make your fucking call.

1209
01:03:30,013 --> 01:03:31,645
Here. I'll get a shotgun.

1210
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:35,639
Plus, I gotta show you something, man.

1211
01:03:35,691 --> 01:03:37,943
Open your eyes up
before you split out of here.

1212
01:03:49,496 --> 01:03:50,914
Wow.

1213
01:03:51,582 --> 01:03:54,543
Look at that. wow.

1214
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:56,545
It's a deer.

1215
01:03:56,587 --> 01:03:58,005
Yeah, that's right.

1216
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,048
Let's take a look.

1217
01:04:16,648 --> 01:04:19,193
It's a fake. It's a statue.

1218
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:22,112
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

1219
01:04:22,154 --> 01:04:24,198
It looked real, though, didn't it?

1220
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:27,576
- Who put it here?
- Me, man! Who do you think?

1221
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,579
It looks great there, really.

1222
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:32,206
It's great.

1223
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:33,207
Thanks.

1224
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:34,124
For what?

1225
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:36,168
For showing it to me.

1226
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:38,420
Oh, that's not what
I wanted to show you.

1227
01:04:38,472 --> 01:04:39,286
I got something.

1228
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:40,464
It's going to blow your mind.

1229
01:04:40,516 --> 01:04:41,882
You wanted proof?

1230
01:04:42,758 --> 01:04:44,426
Here it is.

1231
01:04:44,468 --> 01:04:46,094
Come on.

1232
01:04:47,137 --> 01:04:49,181
All right. here we go.
You wanted C.I.A.?

1233
01:04:49,223 --> 01:04:51,558
I'll show you C.I.A.

1234
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:58,106
What the hell...

1235
01:04:58,148 --> 01:05:00,234
A C.I.A. nerve-gas factory,

1236
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:01,985
That's what the hell.

1237
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:03,612
They're making nerve gas

1238
01:05:03,654 --> 01:05:07,074
To use in the war against
their own people, ok?

1239
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:08,158
Ohh...

1240
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,911
Just blows your mind.

1241
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:13,622
I don't believe it.

1242
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:17,251
I just spent 2 days driving...

1243
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:19,127
In a goddamn circle.

1244
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:21,129
What are you talking about?

1245
01:05:21,171 --> 01:05:24,258
That's the job I told you I was working on.

1246
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:25,133
Christ.

1247
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,219
The car-rental place is right in town.

1248
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:28,679
What are you t...

1249
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,138
Wait a second. You worked here?

1250
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,599
For a month. It's not a nerve-gas factory.

1251
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:34,601
It's a semiautomated facility

1252
01:05:34,726 --> 01:05:37,604
For the manufacture of windshield wipers.

1253
01:05:37,729 --> 01:05:39,773
Oh, I don't believe that for a second.

1254
01:05:39,815 --> 01:05:41,775
All right. You want some proof?

1255
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:43,193
Come on.

1256
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:45,737
I'll give you some proof.

1257
01:05:45,779 --> 01:05:47,656
Follow me.

1258
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:54,663
This is a Zeus 8000
turbine generator.

1259
01:05:54,705 --> 01:05:56,290
It doesn't make nerve gas.

1260
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:58,125
It makes electricity,

1261
01:05:58,208 --> 01:06:00,377
That electricity was going
to provide the power

1262
01:06:00,429 --> 01:06:02,129
for the entire assembly line.

1263
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:04,298
Making windshield wipers?

1264
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:05,174
That's correct.

1265
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:07,426
I suppose if you equipped
enough people

1266
01:06:07,478 --> 01:06:08,667
with windshield wipers,

1267
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:10,304
you could probably
take over the world.

1268
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:12,181
Ha ha! Yeah.

1269
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:14,808
I can't believe you worked here, man.

1270
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:16,810
I could never do this shit.

1271
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:18,187
Didn't you hate it,

1272
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:20,147
Always having someone
telling you what to do,

1273
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:22,691
Some asshole boss?

1274
01:06:27,279 --> 01:06:28,780
Hey, Al?

1275
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:30,240
What?

1276
01:06:30,282 --> 01:06:32,701
Come here.

1277
01:06:34,745 --> 01:06:36,788
Think you can hit that bottle there?

1278
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:38,332
It's in front of the window.

1279
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:40,667
You can't hit it.

1280
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,220
Whoa! hey, close.

1281
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:53,222
That was close, Al. Let me try.

1282
01:06:58,310 --> 01:06:59,186
Yeah!

1283
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:02,189
Jesus Christ, kid, that's an $800 window!

1284
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:05,317
Oh, baby!

1285
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,257
That's $1,600 right there!

1286
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:11,156
Hey, what's in those cans, Al?

1287
01:07:12,783 --> 01:07:14,284
Paint.

1288
01:07:14,326 --> 01:07:15,744
You sure?

1289
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,710
Yeah, that's paint, all right.

1290
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:25,879
All right!

1291
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:32,261
Yeah!

1292
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:35,597
Yeah! yeah!

1293
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:37,933
Reload!

1294
01:07:37,975 --> 01:07:40,227
Windows!

1295
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:44,857
3,200!

1296
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:47,067
Yeah!

1297
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:49,236
Shazam!

1298
01:07:55,367 --> 01:07:57,786
Whoa!

1299
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,351
I'm telling you, kid,

1300
01:08:21,393 --> 01:08:23,353
this dog could climb trees.
I'm serious.

1301
01:08:23,405 --> 01:08:24,219
I don't believe it.

1302
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:26,315
He would just take off
and run up the trunk.

1303
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:27,816
What was his name?

1304
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:29,943
Barky. He was just a mutt.

1305
01:08:30,402 --> 01:08:34,823
He was all white
except for one black ear.

1306
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:37,701
He found this rubber monkey somewhere,

1307
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:40,829
And every day, when
I came home from school,

1308
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:42,789
he'd be sitting in the front yard

1309
01:08:42,841 --> 01:08:44,666
with that damn monkey in his mouth,

1310
01:08:44,917 --> 01:08:47,753
waiting for me to throw it for him.

1311
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:49,087
Kid, I'm telling you,

1312
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:51,340
I threw that monkey for hours.

1313
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:53,425
You still got him?

1314
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:54,343
No.

1315
01:08:54,384 --> 01:08:56,428
I let him out one night
right before I went to bed,

1316
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:57,377
and when I came in,

1317
01:08:57,429 --> 01:08:58,972
he was shaking, breathing funny.

1318
01:08:59,598 --> 01:09:01,642
I asked my dad
if we should take him to the vet,

1319
01:09:01,694 --> 01:09:02,476
and he said,

1320
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:05,395
"no. It's after 9:00.
It's probably closed.

1321
01:09:05,447 --> 01:09:06,980
We'll take him in the morning."

1322
01:09:07,032 --> 01:09:08,597
So we went to sleep.

1323
01:09:08,649 --> 01:09:10,609
Soon as it was light,
I look under my bed...

1324
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:13,487
Because that's where
Barky always slept...

1325
01:09:13,539 --> 01:09:16,323
and I saw his tongue
sticking out, all black.

1326
01:09:17,032 --> 01:09:19,826
I touched him,
and he was already hard,

1327
01:09:19,878 --> 01:09:22,621
like there was cement under his fur.

1328
01:09:22,673 --> 01:09:24,957
He was... he was dead.

1329
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:28,168
My dad said he must
have eaten some poison.

1330
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:30,587
Your dad's a fucking asshole!

1331
01:09:30,639 --> 01:09:31,411
Why?

1332
01:09:31,463 --> 01:09:32,840
He should have taken him to the vet!

1333
01:09:32,892 --> 01:09:34,258
I don't care what time it was!

1334
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,343
He was your dog, Al!

1335
01:09:40,556 --> 01:09:43,267
Goddamn it, man. I can't believe it.

1336
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:45,561
Kid, what's the matter?

1337
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:51,483
Kid?

1338
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:54,987
Kid!

1339
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:12,546
You lost a hubcap over there.

1340
01:10:23,098 --> 01:10:26,518
Good. they're open. I'll be right back.

1341
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:39,156
How did you lose them, Mr. Fountain?

1342
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:41,658
Carelessness, I'm afraid, Doris.

1343
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,577
Where is the car now?

1344
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:44,578
It's safe and sound.

1345
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,038
It's at my friend's house.

1346
01:10:46,163 --> 01:10:47,435
It's a few miles outside of town.

1347
01:10:47,487 --> 01:10:48,707
I'm going to have to charge you

1348
01:10:48,759 --> 01:10:51,627
a $25 key-replacement fee.

1349
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:53,462
Fair enough.

1350
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:58,050
$25.

1351
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:16,735
I hope, for your sake,
you don't lose these.

1352
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:18,487
Mr. Fountain?

1353
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:21,114
Mr. Fountain?

1354
01:11:21,156 --> 01:11:22,439
Hold on, Doris.

1355
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:24,722
You just said something

1356
01:11:24,774 --> 01:11:26,954
that was very, very smart.

1357
01:11:27,788 --> 01:11:29,164
What?

1358
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:32,459
Well, why should I spend
my last 2 days here

1359
01:11:32,511 --> 01:11:34,294
worrying about losing keys,

1360
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:39,341
Especially since my friend has a car?

1361
01:11:39,393 --> 01:11:43,220
I am going to give you directions,

1362
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:45,096
and what I'd like you to do

1363
01:11:45,148 --> 01:11:46,838
is to deliver these keys to me

1364
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:49,559
bright and early
on Thursday morning.

1365
01:11:49,611 --> 01:11:52,229
We don't have a key-delivery service,

1366
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:53,772
Mr. Fountain.

1367
01:11:53,856 --> 01:11:55,149
I see.

1368
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:57,943
But if you did...

1369
01:11:58,026 --> 01:12:00,654
I bet you would have

1370
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:04,658
some kind of key-delivery fee.

1371
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:07,661
Doris?

1372
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:10,664
Have a nice day.

1373
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,866
Just my luck.

1374
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:16,482
Someone broke in this morning

1375
01:12:16,534 --> 01:12:18,046
and stole all the goddamn keys.

1376
01:12:18,098 --> 01:12:18,870
You're kidding me.

1377
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:20,674
What about the key codes
you told me about?

1378
01:12:20,726 --> 01:12:22,009
The bastard stole them, too.

1379
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:24,011
Soonest they can get me
another set

1380
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,345
is Thursday morning.

1381
01:12:25,762 --> 01:12:27,181
What are you going to do?

1382
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:32,769
Find a hotel, I guess. I don't know.

1383
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:36,356
I suppose you could
stay at my place.

1384
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:39,881
I... I appreciate that, kid,

1385
01:12:39,933 --> 01:12:42,154
but I'll only stay at your place

1386
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:43,697
on one condition.

1387
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:45,324
You let me buy you some food.

1388
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:47,159
I got food.

1389
01:12:47,284 --> 01:12:48,702
Yeah, but I thought maybe

1390
01:12:48,744 --> 01:12:50,704
we could do a little
4th of July thing.

1391
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:55,334
You know, barbecue chicken,
make some hamburgers.

1392
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:56,752
You like corn on the cob?

1393
01:12:56,804 --> 01:12:57,868
Are you kidding me?

1394
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,338
That's nature's perfect food.

1395
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:02,090
Good. Chicken, hamburgers,
corn on the cob.

1396
01:13:02,142 --> 01:13:03,592
Beer? Jelly doughnuts?

1397
01:13:03,926 --> 01:13:05,031
Watermelon.

1398
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:06,084
Fireworks!

1399
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:07,846
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

1400
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:09,212
We'll get some sparklers.

1401
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:11,162
Sparklers?
Are you fucking crazy?

1402
01:13:11,214 --> 01:13:13,060
I got a whole box of fireworks, man...

1403
01:13:13,393 --> 01:13:14,228
Real ones.

1404
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:16,188
I'm afraid those are illegal, Kid.

1405
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:17,231
Ha ha ha ha!

1406
01:13:17,272 --> 01:13:19,691
What about breakfast
supplies, kid?

1407
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:21,401
We're running a little low.

1408
01:13:21,453 --> 01:13:22,611
Yeah. Good idea.

1409
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,196
Oh, here we go.

1410
01:13:27,783 --> 01:13:29,451
What are you doing?

1411
01:13:29,503 --> 01:13:31,735
My treat, kid.

1412
01:13:31,787 --> 01:13:34,039
What else do you need? Luncheon meats?

1413
01:13:34,091 --> 01:13:36,124
Yeah, yeah, and jelly doughnuts.

1414
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:38,460
- Jelly doughnuts?
- Yeah. Got to have them.

1415
01:13:38,512 --> 01:13:39,779
All right.

1416
01:13:39,831 --> 01:13:41,046
Oh, I'm sorry.

1417
01:13:41,296 --> 01:13:42,381
Man, watch where you're going!

1418
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:44,716
I'm sorry.

1419
01:13:54,852 --> 01:13:56,145
What the hell are you looking at?

1420
01:13:56,197 --> 01:13:56,979
Oh, nothing.

1421
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:00,858
Well, then get the fuck
out of here, man.

1422
01:14:05,946 --> 01:14:07,364
Thanks.

1423
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:08,866
Sure. Don't mention it.

1424
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:17,958
Jesus!

1425
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,960
Hey, bud, what's going on?

1426
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:22,421
Someone just saw Jesus on that sign.

1427
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:23,422
Where?

1428
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:25,507
In the fire, right below the hamburger.

1429
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:27,009
Come on, honey.

1430
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:28,427
Get out of here.

1431
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:53,785
You see anything, Al?

1432
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:55,329
No.

1433
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:57,289
Me neither.

1434
01:14:57,372 --> 01:14:58,332
Damn it.

1435
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:00,792
You know, I always
just miss those things.

1436
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:04,671
Yeah!

1437
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:05,756
Yeah!

1438
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:08,842
Take that, Saddam insane!

1439
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:10,677
Yeah! Ha ha ha ha!

1440
01:15:10,803 --> 01:15:12,221
Yeah, you.

1441
01:15:12,262 --> 01:15:13,378
We got back to the plant today

1442
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:15,390
and found some vandals had broken in

1443
01:15:15,442 --> 01:15:16,381
while we were gone

1444
01:15:16,433 --> 01:15:18,310
and did some minor
damage to the turbines.

1445
01:15:18,769 --> 01:15:22,356
I'm afraid we're gonna
be delayed another day.

1446
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:24,733
Let me get this straight, Al.

1447
01:15:25,442 --> 01:15:28,049
First you said you were
coming home on the 5th.

1448
01:15:28,101 --> 01:15:30,604
Then you said the 3rd.
Then it was the 4th.

1449
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:33,398
Now, after all this talk
about coming home early,

1450
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,453
Once again, you're telling me you
won't be coming home until the 5th.

1451
01:15:36,505 --> 01:15:37,569
That's correct, Deb.

1452
01:15:37,621 --> 01:15:39,122
Early afternoon on the 5th,

1453
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:40,572
And I just want to say,

1454
01:15:40,624 --> 01:15:42,167
I really look forward to seeing you.

1455
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:43,794
Well, Al,

1456
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:45,379
Guess I'll see you on the fifth, then...

1457
01:15:45,431 --> 01:15:48,497
or the 6th or the 8th or the 10th

1458
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:51,051
or whenever the hell it is
you feel like coming home.

1459
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:52,719
Here's your son.

1460
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:53,720
Here.

1461
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:55,305
It's your dad.

1462
01:15:55,357 --> 01:15:56,265
Hi, dad.

1463
01:15:56,306 --> 01:15:58,892
Hi, Bob. Mom's in a bad mood?

1464
01:15:58,976 --> 01:16:00,310
I think so.

1465
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:01,301
I tell you what then, Bob.

1466
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:03,147
I only got a second.
I know you're busy.

1467
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,857
Let's just do an easy one.

1468
01:16:04,909 --> 01:16:06,692
What's 12 x 2?

1469
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:09,319
Bob, come on, now.

1470
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:12,281
That's an easy one. 12 x 2.

1471
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:17,244
I don't know.

1472
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:18,912
Bob, what are you doing?

1473
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:20,831
Nothing.

1474
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:22,457
Are you crying?

1475
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:24,293
No, sir.

1476
01:16:24,334 --> 01:16:27,421
Hey, hey, hey, Bob, come on, now.

1477
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:28,297
Pull yourself together.

1478
01:16:28,338 --> 01:16:30,924
There's nothing to be upset about.

1479
01:16:31,008 --> 01:16:32,843
Everything's fine.

1480
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:34,970
Just keep at those flashcards.

1481
01:16:35,012 --> 01:16:37,431
You'll be all right, ok?

1482
01:16:37,473 --> 01:16:38,765
Ok.

1483
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:47,973
And a miracle happened today,

1484
01:16:48,025 --> 01:16:49,933
according to Willard Snarp
of Drip Rock,

1485
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:53,030
who claims to have seen
the face of Jesus on a billboard

1486
01:16:53,082 --> 01:16:55,782
outside the big lucky
shopping center on route 17.

1487
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:58,994
It's Jesus, all right,
dressed in modern clothes,

1488
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:00,496
wearing a suit and a bow tie.

1489
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:01,997
Can you point him out to us?

1490
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:03,832
There, in the flames.

1491
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:06,001
Experts from the Vatican
will arrive on Monday

1492
01:17:06,043 --> 01:17:08,003
to authenticate the sighting. Tina?

1493
01:17:08,045 --> 01:17:09,202
In other religious news,

1494
01:17:09,254 --> 01:17:11,506
police today arrested a local minister,

1495
01:17:11,558 --> 01:17:13,759
charging him with
a brutal triple murder.

1496
01:17:14,051 --> 01:17:16,345
Police say Reverend Luvven Coddle

1497
01:17:16,428 --> 01:17:19,056
entered the home of Earl
and Lindy Sykes last night

1498
01:17:19,108 --> 01:17:21,475
and hacked them to death
with a small ax.

1499
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,301
Their 6-year-old daughter
Mandy was also killed.

1500
01:17:24,353 --> 01:17:27,189
Neighbors told police
the Sykes had recently withdrawn

1501
01:17:27,241 --> 01:17:29,691
from Reverend Coddle's
church of hope and light.

1502
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:33,111
Hey, shut the fuck up!

1503
01:17:33,163 --> 01:17:34,488
Goddamn it.

1504
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:36,031
Goddamn it!

1505
01:17:36,114 --> 01:17:39,034
Killing a 6-year-old girl.

1506
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:41,870
Oh, what the hell is wrong with people?

1507
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:44,873
It makes you want to
just get a machine gun

1508
01:17:44,998 --> 01:17:46,416
And do something.

1509
01:17:49,002 --> 01:17:50,504
Hey, don't open that!

1510
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:51,922
Why not?

1511
01:17:52,005 --> 01:17:53,465
You'll let the moonlight out, man.

1512
01:17:53,517 --> 01:17:56,260
Come on. Use your head.

1513
01:18:00,514 --> 01:18:02,558
Let's get out of here.

1514
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:03,892
What do you mean?

1515
01:18:03,976 --> 01:18:05,498
Don't you know a bar in town?

1516
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,020
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.

1517
01:18:07,354 --> 01:18:08,313
Hey, good idea.

1518
01:18:08,981 --> 01:18:11,400
I'm sick of sitting around this place.

1519
01:18:40,554 --> 01:18:41,472
Hey, stinky.

1520
01:18:41,555 --> 01:18:42,973
What's happening?

1521
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:43,932
Barnett.

1522
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:45,663
My best friend, Al Fountain.

1523
01:18:45,715 --> 01:18:47,618
Al's a nuclear engineer.

1524
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:49,469
Electrical, actually.

1525
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:52,024
Field installation of
Zeus turbine generators.

1526
01:18:52,733 --> 01:18:55,235
What line of work are you in, Stinky?

1527
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:56,987
I work over at the car wash.

1528
01:18:57,029 --> 01:18:58,447
Oh, really? Doing what?

1529
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:00,616
Washing cars. What do you fucking think?

1530
01:19:00,657 --> 01:19:03,264
Good. How about you, Barnett?

1531
01:19:03,316 --> 01:19:05,871
Cesspools. Got my own truck.

1532
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:08,624
Hey, is this yours, Stinky?

1533
01:19:08,676 --> 01:19:10,459
No.

1534
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:12,002
In cesspools?

1535
01:19:12,085 --> 01:19:15,005
My wife has 2 uncles in cesspools.

1536
01:19:15,088 --> 01:19:18,509
They don't get along at all.
Big cesspool people.

1537
01:19:23,597 --> 01:19:25,140
Hey, Wick. Hey, Doob.

1538
01:19:25,182 --> 01:19:26,517
Davy fuckhead.

1539
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,101
You hear about Jesus?

1540
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:30,479
Fuck you.

1541
01:19:33,065 --> 01:19:35,484
Are you fucking with me?

1542
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:38,570
No, wick. What's the matter?

1543
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:40,489
You threw another match at me.

1544
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:44,993
No, wick. All I got is a lighter, see?

1545
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:47,621
All right. That's it, goddamn it.

1546
01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:49,039
Oh!

1547
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:51,500
Get the fuck out of here!

1548
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:53,544
I'm going to kill you, mother...

1549
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:58,549
Aah!

1550
01:20:00,092 --> 01:20:02,678
All right, little Davy. Come on!

1551
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:03,585
Come on!

1552
01:20:03,637 --> 01:20:06,682
No, Wick. Don't. Don't, Wick.

1553
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:16,066
Your stupid hat!

1554
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:23,699
All right, Doob, let's get a beer.

1555
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:27,035
Hey, guys. What's up, Bobby?

1556
01:20:34,168 --> 01:20:36,211
Fuckers. These fucking...

1557
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:37,546
Easy.

1558
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:39,590
They got us, man.

1559
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:41,675
Just take it easy.

1560
01:20:41,717 --> 01:20:43,594
They got us, man.

1561
01:20:43,677 --> 01:20:46,680
Al, I want you to go in the woods.

1562
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:49,600
I want you to get some blood weed.

1563
01:20:49,683 --> 01:20:51,894
I'll just sit and rest
here for a minute.

1564
01:20:51,935 --> 01:20:54,104
Then we're gonna sneak
into Wick's house

1565
01:20:54,146 --> 01:20:55,606
when he's asleep,

1566
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:57,566
and we're gonna smear
that shit all over him.

1567
01:20:57,618 --> 01:20:59,933
What do you mean, blood weed?

1568
01:20:59,985 --> 01:21:02,602
His face and his mouth and his eyes.

1569
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:05,699
He ever stops bleeding,
he's gonna be blind...

1570
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:07,201
All right. Come on, now.

1571
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:08,619
For the rest of his life.

1572
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,162
Then we'll see that fucker jump

1573
01:21:10,204 --> 01:21:11,622
every time I light a match.

1574
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:14,249
Let me take a look at you, all right?

1575
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:16,126
I'm all right.

1576
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,628
Come on, get going.

1577
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:20,255
Take a flashlight,
and wear gloves, ok?

1578
01:21:20,297 --> 01:21:21,632
Listen to me, kid.

1579
01:21:21,715 --> 01:21:24,259
We're not gonna go anywhere,
all right?

1580
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:26,136
We're not going anywhere.

1581
01:21:26,178 --> 01:21:27,888
You're not gonna help me?

1582
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:29,129
I am trying...

1583
01:21:29,181 --> 01:21:31,141
I am trying to help you.

1584
01:21:31,183 --> 01:21:32,684
Now, cut this crap out.

1585
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:34,728
All right, I'll do it myself.

1586
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,647
Kid, come on, now. Calm down.

1587
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:39,191
Calm down? Calm down? Calm down?

1588
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:41,652
At least you can help me, man!

1589
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:44,196
Why aren't you gonna
fucking help me?

1590
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:46,573
I thought you were my friend, man!

1591
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:48,325
Why ain't you gonna help me?

1592
01:21:48,377 --> 01:21:49,743
You fucking help me!

1593
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:51,912
You fucking help me.

1594
01:21:52,704 --> 01:21:55,749
You fucking help me, man!

1595
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:58,460
Kid, kid...

1596
01:21:58,544 --> 01:22:00,629
Help me, man.

1597
01:22:01,964 --> 01:22:03,298
Help me, man.

1598
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,804
All right. take it easy. Come on.

1599
01:22:08,846 --> 01:22:11,181
Take it easy.

1600
01:22:11,223 --> 01:22:14,268
Take it easy. Come on. Come on.

1601
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:16,186
Come on.

1602
01:22:35,789 --> 01:22:37,708
What's the matter, Al?

1603
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:41,753
I don't know.

1604
01:22:41,795 --> 01:22:44,339
Maybe this whole trip of mine

1605
01:22:44,381 --> 01:22:49,219
was just a big mistake.

1606
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:52,598
Hey, Purlene,
here's your underwear.

1607
01:22:53,307 --> 01:22:54,328
Are they dry?

1608
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:55,350
I don't know.

1609
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,687
Almost.

1610
01:23:01,773 --> 01:23:03,192
Ahem.

1611
01:23:04,318 --> 01:23:06,195
Ahh!

1612
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:13,744
Whoo!

1613
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:26,256
How are y'all doing?

1614
01:23:26,298 --> 01:23:27,800
Name's Bucky, by the way.

1615
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:30,135
You can call me the Kid or just kid...

1616
01:23:30,187 --> 01:23:32,012
anything you want to call me.

1617
01:23:32,846 --> 01:23:34,264
What is your name?

1618
01:23:34,306 --> 01:23:35,265
Floatie.

1619
01:23:35,307 --> 01:23:37,893
Sisters? Hey, get out of town.

1620
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:40,312
Hey, Al, come on over!

1621
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:44,399
Come on! They want to talk to you.

1622
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:46,777
Come on.

1623
01:23:46,819 --> 01:23:49,238
Whew.

1624
01:23:50,823 --> 01:23:53,242
How about that water, huh?

1625
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:56,870
Al, this is, uh, Purlene...

1626
01:23:56,912 --> 01:23:59,122
Purlene and Flighty.

1627
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:01,291
Nice to meet you.

1628
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:03,752
We saw them in the store
yesterday, remember?

1629
01:24:03,877 --> 01:24:06,088
What were you crying about?

1630
01:24:06,129 --> 01:24:08,298
Oh, well, I lost my job.

1631
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,759
It was a really good one, too.

1632
01:24:10,884 --> 01:24:12,302
I just... I didn't...

1633
01:24:12,344 --> 01:24:13,929
I only was there for about a...

1634
01:24:13,981 --> 01:24:15,514
They're sisters. Isn't that crazy?

1635
01:24:16,348 --> 01:24:18,934
Sisters? Really? Very nice.

1636
01:24:18,976 --> 01:24:19,977
Where are you from?

1637
01:24:20,029 --> 01:24:21,051
Chicago.

1638
01:24:21,103 --> 01:24:22,250
Al's a nuclear engineer.

1639
01:24:22,302 --> 01:24:23,397
Electrical, actually...

1640
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:26,400
Field installation
of Zeus turbine generators.

1641
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,485
Some people can give an electric shock

1642
01:24:28,537 --> 01:24:30,362
just by looking at you.

1643
01:24:33,448 --> 01:24:35,450
What about you, buttercup?

1644
01:24:35,868 --> 01:24:37,202
You a swimsuit model?

1645
01:24:37,254 --> 01:24:38,318
What?

1646
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:40,330
You are, aren't you?

1647
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:42,875
Come on, now. Fess up, girl.

1648
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:45,961
Look, buddy, I work over
at Deever's Tire Service,

1649
01:24:46,003 --> 01:24:47,880
and I hate to say it, but...

1650
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:49,788
I think it's time you came in

1651
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,259
and got your fucking
wheels rebalanced.

1652
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,348
Yeah. Ha ha ha.

1653
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:59,349
I'll tell you something.

1654
01:24:59,391 --> 01:25:01,226
You used to be a cheerleader?
Didn't you?

1655
01:25:01,278 --> 01:25:03,103
In the fourth fucking grade.

1656
01:25:04,271 --> 01:25:06,523
And your hair's not
really blond, is it?

1657
01:25:06,575 --> 01:25:07,733
Yes, it is.

1658
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:08,859
No, it isn't.

1659
01:25:08,901 --> 01:25:10,819
Her hair's red. She's a redhead.

1660
01:25:10,861 --> 01:25:12,696
She's got a bright red bush.

1661
01:25:12,738 --> 01:25:14,448
I don't believe you said that.

1662
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,397
All right, Al.

1663
01:25:15,449 --> 01:25:17,858
I'm not gonna say anything.

1664
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:20,996
So what's with you guys?
Were y'all in a car wreck?

1665
01:25:21,038 --> 01:25:21,914
No.

1666
01:25:21,955 --> 01:25:23,749
We got jumped last night
over at Bambi's

1667
01:25:23,801 --> 01:25:25,292
By 6 fucking sailors.

1668
01:25:26,001 --> 01:25:27,377
What kind of sailors?

1669
01:25:27,419 --> 01:25:30,380
I ain't never seen
no sailors in Drip Rock.

1670
01:25:30,422 --> 01:25:31,924
Wasn't it sailors, Al?

1671
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:34,760
No. they were marines. 5 of them.

1672
01:25:34,812 --> 01:25:35,677
That's a great movie...

1673
01:25:35,729 --> 01:25:36,543
Green Berets.

1674
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:39,014
Ever see that movie?
I really liked it.

1675
01:25:39,066 --> 01:25:41,683
John Wayne, a Japanese guy,

1676
01:25:41,735 --> 01:25:43,519
and, uh, Kim Darby.

1677
01:25:46,939 --> 01:25:49,775
Damn, it's hot. I'm burning up.

1678
01:25:49,858 --> 01:25:52,694
Jump in the water, then, fireball.

1679
01:25:52,736 --> 01:25:55,531
Yeah, but I might take my suit off.

1680
01:25:55,572 --> 01:25:58,408
Looks like underwear to me.

1681
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,244
Well, he's wearing underwear, too,

1682
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,037
And you can see right through it.

1683
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:03,038
Yeah, I noticed that.

1684
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:03,956
Yeah?

1685
01:26:03,997 --> 01:26:06,416
So we're wearing underwear. So what?

1686
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:07,793
We're just wearing them
'cause you're here.

1687
01:26:07,845 --> 01:26:09,461
Usually we go naked.

1688
01:26:09,513 --> 01:26:10,967
So do we.

1689
01:26:11,019 --> 01:26:12,422
Yeah?

1690
01:26:12,464 --> 01:26:14,424
Well, then let's all
take our suits off, ok?

1691
01:26:14,466 --> 01:26:17,427
Is that all right with everyone?

1692
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,722
Yeah. Go ahead.

1693
01:26:20,764 --> 01:26:22,933
Where you going?

1694
01:26:22,975 --> 01:26:25,060
I'm gonna jump off this rock, man.

1695
01:26:25,102 --> 01:26:26,937
Is that all right with you?

1696
01:26:27,521 --> 01:26:28,939
Ever try it naked?

1697
01:26:28,981 --> 01:26:30,566
All right, look, peckerhead.

1698
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:32,109
I ain't taking off the suit,

1699
01:26:32,151 --> 01:26:33,569
So just forget about it.

1700
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:37,072
Come on, girl.

1701
01:26:37,531 --> 01:26:40,576
Whoo! Whoo!

1702
01:26:40,617 --> 01:26:42,911
Yeah!

1703
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:45,581
Yeah!

1704
01:26:45,622 --> 01:26:47,583
Look at you.

1705
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:49,209
You can't even swim.

1706
01:26:49,261 --> 01:26:50,283
Sure I can!

1707
01:26:50,335 --> 01:26:52,045
What do you think I'm doing now?

1708
01:26:52,097 --> 01:26:54,407
That's the fucking dog paddle.

1709
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,717
My name's Floatie, not Flighty.

1710
01:26:56,769 --> 01:26:59,136
Oh.

1711
01:26:59,178 --> 01:27:01,555
Ok.

1712
01:27:04,141 --> 01:27:06,894
Excuse me for a second, Floatie.

1713
01:27:06,935 --> 01:27:08,812
I've gotta check something.

1714
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:16,403
Hey, Floatie,

1715
01:27:16,445 --> 01:27:17,863
Come on in

1716
01:27:17,905 --> 01:27:20,866
And help me drown this here stray dog!

1717
01:27:22,451 --> 01:27:24,453
Yee-haw!

1718
01:27:24,495 --> 01:27:26,371
Yow!

1719
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:29,333
Arf arf arf!

1720
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:31,376
Yeah!

1721
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:33,212
Come on, Al!

1722
01:27:33,253 --> 01:27:34,922
Maybe later.

1723
01:27:34,963 --> 01:27:37,841
I think it came off in that jump!

1724
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:42,471
If you don't wanna parade around
in your wet underwear,

1725
01:27:42,513 --> 01:27:44,014
You don't have to, Al.

1726
01:27:44,056 --> 01:27:46,266
It's your choice.

1727
01:27:46,308 --> 01:27:48,393
Each man can choose

1728
01:27:48,435 --> 01:27:51,480
how he marches in the parade of life.

1729
01:27:51,522 --> 01:27:53,982
Al Fountain, Wednesday...

1730
01:27:54,024 --> 01:27:56,985
July 4th, 1:05 p.m.

1731
01:27:57,027 --> 01:27:58,445
2, 3!

1732
01:27:58,487 --> 01:28:00,364
Whoo! Go on, girl!

1733
01:28:11,959 --> 01:28:13,961
Whoo!

1734
01:28:14,002 --> 01:28:16,505
Arf arf arf arf!

1735
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:17,965
Sisters.

1736
01:28:18,006 --> 01:28:20,509
You go, sister!

1737
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:22,886
Whoo!

1738
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:35,274
Oohhh!

1739
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:39,278
Yeah! Come on, Al!

1740
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:41,780
1, 2, 3.

1741
01:28:41,822 --> 01:28:43,157
Go!

1742
01:28:57,045 --> 01:28:58,922
Whoo!

1743
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:02,551
Yeah!

1744
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:04,094
Come on, kid!

1745
01:29:09,266 --> 01:29:10,684
Oh, man!

1746
01:29:10,809 --> 01:29:12,227
Yeah!

1747
01:29:12,269 --> 01:29:14,188
That smells good.

1748
01:29:14,271 --> 01:29:15,689
Hey! All right.

1749
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:17,732
What's with the corn, Al?

1750
01:29:17,784 --> 01:29:19,698
Well, you didn't have a pot,

1751
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:21,612
so we'll just toss them in.

1752
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:23,739
They'll cook that way?

1753
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,824
Oh, yeah. About 15, 20 minutes.

1754
01:29:25,866 --> 01:29:27,201
Wow. Hey.

1755
01:29:27,326 --> 01:29:29,203
Hey, where's that
weird tape of yours?

1756
01:29:29,328 --> 01:29:30,829
The girls might like it.

1757
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:32,289
What girls?

1758
01:29:32,331 --> 01:29:33,738
Purlene and Flighty.

1759
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,709
I invited them over for dinner.

1760
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:37,211
Why?

1761
01:29:37,294 --> 01:29:38,702
Well, they weren't
doing anything,

1762
01:29:38,754 --> 01:29:40,672
and Floatie's still
feeling a little low.

1763
01:29:41,298 --> 01:29:43,717
She kind of likes you, Al.

1764
01:29:43,842 --> 01:29:44,750
Does she?

1765
01:29:44,802 --> 01:29:47,252
Yep. Purlene told me so.

1766
01:29:47,304 --> 01:29:50,724
Kid, let's get something
squared away right now.

1767
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:52,726
I'm a married man.

1768
01:29:52,851 --> 01:29:54,936
I don't make a habit
of fooling around

1769
01:29:54,988 --> 01:29:57,022
with every woman
who kind of likes me.

1770
01:29:57,815 --> 01:29:59,817
I'm glad to hear that, man.

1771
01:29:59,869 --> 01:30:01,151
Really.

1772
01:30:01,193 --> 01:30:02,778
Now, where's the tape?

1773
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,655
Look in the car.

1774
01:30:08,367 --> 01:30:10,786
Thank you for inviting us.

1775
01:30:10,828 --> 01:30:12,788
I really like your house.

1776
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:13,737
Thanks.

1777
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:15,707
You got a kitchen area,

1778
01:30:16,333 --> 01:30:18,252
a living room, a dining room.

1779
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:21,755
Al's gonna come in here
and do a whole job on it.

1780
01:30:21,839 --> 01:30:23,861
He's gonna do the whole
self-sufficient thing

1781
01:30:23,913 --> 01:30:25,884
so I get the solar power,
I get the whole thing.

1782
01:30:25,936 --> 01:30:27,636
he's gonna put the jazz in,
the pool table,

1783
01:30:27,688 --> 01:30:28,502
the this and the that.

1784
01:30:28,554 --> 01:30:30,973
'cause Al knows about that.
He's a nuclear engineer.

1785
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:33,934
You know, Al and I do porno films.

1786
01:30:33,976 --> 01:30:36,937
On our free time, of course.

1787
01:30:36,979 --> 01:30:38,313
Ha ha ha!

1788
01:30:38,355 --> 01:30:41,275
Got 3 more burgers
cooking over there.

1789
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:42,776
How about it, Flighty?

1790
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:44,111
Floatie.

1791
01:30:44,153 --> 01:30:45,404
I'm sorry.

1792
01:30:45,456 --> 01:30:46,655
Purlene?

1793
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:47,823
No, not me.

1794
01:30:47,865 --> 01:30:50,284
I got my jeans unbuttoned now.

1795
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:51,368
Yeah?

1796
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:52,828
Let's see.

1797
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:54,788
Oh! Get out of here, man.

1798
01:30:54,872 --> 01:30:57,291
He's like a goddamn dog.

1799
01:30:57,374 --> 01:30:58,792
He is.

1800
01:30:58,876 --> 01:31:00,794
Remember... Remember Sneaky?

1801
01:31:00,878 --> 01:31:02,296
Remember that little stray,

1802
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:04,339
Used to sleep in the garage?

1803
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:05,340
Oh, yeah...

1804
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:07,342
With that one ear
that never went down.

1805
01:31:07,384 --> 01:31:09,094
Same hair...

1806
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:10,804
Same eye.

1807
01:31:10,929 --> 01:31:13,348
Well, you all look
pretty great yourselves.

1808
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:14,516
Don't they, Al?

1809
01:31:14,568 --> 01:31:15,851
Very nice.

1810
01:31:15,893 --> 01:31:19,146
I never did have corn cooked this way.

1811
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:20,762
Oh, that's Al.

1812
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:22,483
He made the corn and the chicken,

1813
01:31:22,535 --> 01:31:24,141
but I cooked the burgers.

1814
01:31:24,193 --> 01:31:26,236
You boys would make
some good husbands.

1815
01:31:26,288 --> 01:31:28,030
Yeah, we probably would.

1816
01:31:29,448 --> 01:31:31,950
Too bad we ain't looking for any.

1817
01:31:31,992 --> 01:31:33,368
Ha ha ha ha.

1818
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:34,369
Well, we're not either.

1819
01:31:34,411 --> 01:31:37,331
Besides, Al's already
married. Right, Al?

1820
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:40,959
Do you not feel well?

1821
01:31:41,043 --> 01:31:41,877
Actually,

1822
01:31:41,919 --> 01:31:45,380
my head has started hurting me again.

1823
01:31:46,173 --> 01:31:47,132
Here.

1824
01:31:48,592 --> 01:31:49,780
Take one of these.

1825
01:31:49,832 --> 01:31:51,235
What are they?

1826
01:31:51,287 --> 01:31:52,638
It's just aspirin,

1827
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:55,224
A little something extra.

1828
01:31:55,265 --> 01:31:57,142
Thank you.

1829
01:31:58,185 --> 01:32:00,229
Yeah. I got a headache, too.

1830
01:32:00,312 --> 01:32:02,147
Well, help yourself.

1831
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:03,148
Floatie?

1832
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:06,610
Yeah. I feel a headache coming on.

1833
01:32:15,244 --> 01:32:18,121
Well, excuse me.
I've gotta tend the fire.

1834
01:32:37,349 --> 01:32:39,601
Pow! Pow! Pow, Pow!

1835
01:32:39,685 --> 01:32:41,603
Pow! Get up there!

1836
01:32:41,655 --> 01:32:44,432
- Get up there!
- Be careful now, there, kid.

1837
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:46,900
Yeah!

1838
01:32:46,984 --> 01:32:48,360
Wow!

1839
01:32:49,528 --> 01:32:52,406
Better than fucking sparklers, huh?

1840
01:32:52,458 --> 01:32:54,158
Ha ha ha! Yeah!

1841
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:56,827
Burn, baby, burn!

1842
01:32:56,869 --> 01:32:59,788
Space rockets to the moon!

1843
01:32:59,872 --> 01:33:01,331
And Uranus!

1844
01:33:10,382 --> 01:33:12,134
Hah!

1845
01:33:12,176 --> 01:33:14,011
Oh!

1846
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:15,804
Hey!

1847
01:33:22,895 --> 01:33:24,980
Look at that, Purl.

1848
01:33:25,063 --> 01:33:25,856
Niagara Falls,

1849
01:33:25,898 --> 01:33:28,609
4th of July, right in my front yard.

1850
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:32,196
Watch this, y'all!

1851
01:33:32,237 --> 01:33:33,864
Look at this, man.

1852
01:33:33,906 --> 01:33:36,867
I got me a flamethrower.

1853
01:33:36,909 --> 01:33:38,952
Hyah! take that, man. Take that!

1854
01:33:39,036 --> 01:33:41,371
Yes! yes!

1855
01:33:50,964 --> 01:33:52,382
Hey.

1856
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:54,468
Hey, you feeling all right, Al?

1857
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:56,386
Oh, yeah. I feel fine.

1858
01:33:56,428 --> 01:33:58,388
I just figured something out.

1859
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:01,767
This whole backward
phenomenon of mine

1860
01:34:01,819 --> 01:34:03,894
started the day I noticed

1861
01:34:03,946 --> 01:34:06,188
my first gray hair.

1862
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:08,440
You see that?

1863
01:34:08,482 --> 01:34:10,776
It's me. I am doing it.

1864
01:34:10,818 --> 01:34:12,903
I am trying to stop time!

1865
01:34:12,945 --> 01:34:14,988
Whoa, man, that's heavy!

1866
01:34:15,072 --> 01:34:16,448
Ha ha ha!

1867
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:18,718
Wow! Hey, man,
you don't like Floatie?

1868
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:19,617
What?

1869
01:34:19,618 --> 01:34:22,842
Floatie. She thinks you don't like her
'cause of that mark on her face.

1870
01:34:23,011 --> 01:34:24,540
That's ridiculous. Where is she?

1871
01:34:24,541 --> 01:34:26,585
She's over there at the dinner table.

1872
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,961
All right.

1873
01:34:29,002 --> 01:34:31,421
I'm gonna go talk to her, kid,

1874
01:34:31,463 --> 01:34:33,507
let her know everything's fine here.

1875
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:35,008
Ok?

1876
01:34:35,092 --> 01:34:36,426
Thanks.

1877
01:34:37,627 --> 01:34:39,587
You're all right, kid.

1878
01:34:39,756 --> 01:34:41,139
I mean it. You really are.

1879
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:42,474
So don't worry.

1880
01:34:42,516 --> 01:34:43,934
I'm gonna go over there now,

1881
01:34:43,976 --> 01:34:46,937
and I'm gonna get
everything squared away.

1882
01:34:54,987 --> 01:34:57,573
Where were you working, Floatie?

1883
01:34:58,157 --> 01:35:00,159
Uh, I was in phone sales.

1884
01:35:00,211 --> 01:35:01,024
Oh, really.

1885
01:35:01,076 --> 01:35:03,361
Office supplies or clothing catalogs?

1886
01:35:03,362 --> 01:35:04,229
Sex.

1887
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:06,498
Excuse me?

1888
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:08,458
Phone sex?

1889
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:10,544
Company called, um...

1890
01:35:10,627 --> 01:35:12,880
Love Phone.

1891
01:35:13,505 --> 01:35:15,466
You ever heard of it?

1892
01:35:15,507 --> 01:35:18,345
No. I'm, uh, I'm afraid I haven't.

1893
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:21,323
It was the perfect job for me.

1894
01:35:21,324 --> 01:35:24,244
I'm kind of a quiet person, Al.

1895
01:35:25,526 --> 01:35:27,685
I like to just sit around and...

1896
01:35:28,262 --> 01:35:29,645
think up things...

1897
01:35:29,646 --> 01:35:32,065
you know, fantasies...

1898
01:35:32,118 --> 01:35:34,454
Not all of them about sex.

1899
01:35:34,568 --> 01:35:36,731
I got a whole bunch
of stories in my mind

1900
01:35:36,732 --> 01:35:39,214
about a princess

1901
01:35:39,399 --> 01:35:42,299
who can kill people
just by looking at them.

1902
01:35:42,342 --> 01:35:44,649
But she only does it
to guys who are mean to her,

1903
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:47,314
because there are a lot
of nice guys out there.

1904
01:35:47,699 --> 01:35:50,312
I know. I talked to a lot of them
on the phone.

1905
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:52,834
<i>What the hell are you trying to do?</i>

1906
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:56,965
Why were you fired?

1907
01:35:58,091 --> 01:36:00,552
They tried me for a week,

1908
01:36:00,594 --> 01:36:04,056
but, um, guys kept hanging up on me.

1909
01:36:04,097 --> 01:36:06,558
I guess I'm just one of those people

1910
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:08,687
who aren't sexy...

1911
01:36:09,603 --> 01:36:11,980
even if it is just over the phone.

1912
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:14,306
Now, hold on a second, Floatie.

1913
01:36:14,358 --> 01:36:18,195
I think you're exaggerating
a little bit there.

1914
01:36:18,247 --> 01:36:20,072
What do you mean?

1915
01:36:20,113 --> 01:36:22,991
Well, I think you're...

1916
01:36:26,328 --> 01:36:28,411
Sexy.

1917
01:36:30,123 --> 01:36:32,543
<i>Oh! Turn that tape over.</i>

1918
01:36:42,636 --> 01:36:44,138
Whoa!

1919
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:45,472
Whoa!

1920
01:36:45,597 --> 01:36:47,558
Here we go.

1921
01:36:47,599 --> 01:36:49,393
Hey, wow, man.

1922
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:51,145
All right, Al!

1923
01:36:51,228 --> 01:36:52,604
Huh!

1924
01:36:52,646 --> 01:36:54,398
Hey, hey!

1925
01:36:54,439 --> 01:36:56,066
Right on.

1926
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:58,193
Righteous, man.

1927
01:36:58,235 --> 01:37:00,028
All right.

1928
01:37:02,197 --> 01:37:03,615
Ha ha ha!

1929
01:37:04,387 --> 01:37:05,805
Come on.

1930
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:08,620
Shake that thing.

1931
01:37:08,662 --> 01:37:10,622
Over here. Come on.

1932
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:18,589
You idiot. Put that down!

1933
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:26,430
Whoo!

1934
01:37:26,472 --> 01:37:28,140
Whoa!

1935
01:37:29,183 --> 01:37:30,476
Yeah! there you go.

1936
01:37:30,517 --> 01:37:31,768
Take it off, girl.

1937
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:33,979
Looking good.

1938
01:37:34,021 --> 01:37:36,106
Whoo! Oh, yeah!

1939
01:37:36,148 --> 01:37:38,233
Sexy, sexy, sexy!

1940
01:37:38,275 --> 01:37:40,652
Ha ha ha!

1941
01:37:40,694 --> 01:37:42,112
Whoo!

1942
01:37:42,237 --> 01:37:43,155
Yeah!

1943
01:37:43,238 --> 01:37:45,449
Hey, check it out!

1944
01:37:45,491 --> 01:37:47,659
Al's getting naked!

1945
01:38:06,220 --> 01:38:08,639
Get her, Al!

1946
01:38:09,765 --> 01:38:11,266
Whoo!

1947
01:38:11,308 --> 01:38:12,684
Go, kid!

1948
01:38:12,768 --> 01:38:14,645
Whoa! Ha ha ha!

1949
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:01,084
Mr. Fountain?

1950
01:40:02,669 --> 01:40:05,589
Good morning, Doris. How are you?

1951
01:40:05,672 --> 01:40:08,296
I brought your extra set of car keys,
Mr. Fountain.

1952
01:40:08,717 --> 01:40:12,429
Thank you very much
for bringing them out. I...

1953
01:40:12,471 --> 01:40:16,099
won't get up
because I'm not dressed.

1954
01:40:16,183 --> 01:40:19,228
You could just leave them
on the bed, please.

1955
01:40:19,269 --> 01:40:20,604
Thank you.

1956
01:40:20,729 --> 01:40:22,231
Thank you, Doris. I appreciate it.

1957
01:40:22,272 --> 01:40:23,774
Did you want to buy
something, ma'am?

1958
01:40:23,816 --> 01:40:25,776
I got some birds there. Giraffe?

1959
01:40:25,818 --> 01:40:27,611
A beautiful rubber snake.

1960
01:40:27,694 --> 01:40:29,112
Where are you going?

1961
01:40:29,238 --> 01:40:30,280
Oh! careful.

1962
01:40:30,322 --> 01:40:31,156
Oh!

1963
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:34,117
I'm letting that go for about 25.

1964
01:40:34,243 --> 01:40:36,119
Oh, shut up!

1965
01:40:38,247 --> 01:40:39,623
What's going on?

1966
01:40:39,706 --> 01:40:44,294
I got the circle substitute
set number 1225-a.

1967
01:40:44,336 --> 01:40:46,003
Oh, was that the rent-a-car chick?

1968
01:40:46,004 --> 01:40:46,862
Yeah, yeah.

1969
01:40:46,863 --> 01:40:48,681
Oh, man, I thought
she was a customer.

1970
01:40:48,682 --> 01:40:50,475
Yeah. Doris.

1971
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:56,181
To hell with both of you!

1972
01:40:58,994 --> 01:41:03,415
Well, it was nice
to meet you, Al.

1973
01:41:04,193 --> 01:41:06,571
Me, too, Floatie.

1974
01:41:19,746 --> 01:41:21,592
Jesus, let me get a breath!

1975
01:41:21,593 --> 01:41:22,427
Sorry.

1976
01:41:22,601 --> 01:41:24,650
I just wanted something
to remember you by.

1977
01:41:24,651 --> 01:41:26,933
What, are you leaving
the country?

1978
01:41:26,934 --> 01:41:29,561
No. why? you wanna
come over tonight?

1979
01:41:31,589 --> 01:41:32,966
I don't know.

1980
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:35,179
I tell you one thing, though.

1981
01:41:35,262 --> 01:41:38,307
I ain't sleeping
in no goddamn chair.

1982
01:41:38,348 --> 01:41:40,684
Well, I got some beds.

1983
01:41:42,811 --> 01:41:44,480
Bye, Bucky.

1984
01:41:44,521 --> 01:41:46,190
Bye, baby.

1985
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:50,319
Hey, get away from the car, man.

1986
01:41:50,444 --> 01:41:52,577
- I mean it.
- I'm hanging on!

1987
01:41:52,578 --> 01:41:54,524
- Whoa!
- Oh, be careful!

1988
01:41:55,449 --> 01:41:57,367
I'm all right.

1989
01:41:57,451 --> 01:41:59,285
Bye-bye, baby!

1990
01:41:59,327 --> 01:42:01,035
Whoo!

1991
01:42:13,967 --> 01:42:16,865
There you go, Al.
You're out of here.

1992
01:42:16,866 --> 01:42:17,783
I guess so, kid.

1993
01:42:18,055 --> 01:42:20,764
Hey, listen,
you ever down this way again,

1994
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:22,417
You just drop in, ok?

1995
01:42:22,418 --> 01:42:24,272
I mean, anytime. I mean it.

1996
01:42:24,273 --> 01:42:25,983
Will do, kid,
and you've got my number.

1997
01:42:25,984 --> 01:42:27,945
If you ever get to Chicago,

1998
01:42:28,565 --> 01:42:30,234
Give me a call.

1999
01:42:30,317 --> 01:42:31,902
All right. Sure. Hey...

2000
01:42:31,944 --> 01:42:34,404
I might get out there one day.

2001
01:42:35,595 --> 01:42:36,991
Well, good-bye, kid.

2002
01:42:37,034 --> 01:42:38,869
So long, Al.

2003
01:42:39,493 --> 01:42:41,870
Oh, wait a second.

2004
01:42:49,002 --> 01:42:52,422
Just a little momentum
from your stay here.

2005
01:42:55,509 --> 01:42:57,427
Thanks, kid.

2006
01:42:58,795 --> 01:43:00,172
Ha ha ha!

2007
01:43:01,515 --> 01:43:03,392
Thank you very much.

2008
01:43:05,978 --> 01:43:07,657
You take care of yourself.

2009
01:43:07,658 --> 01:43:10,077
Hey, you know me, Al.

2010
01:43:48,896 --> 01:43:50,856
Ha ha ha!

2011
01:44:45,731 --> 01:44:48,619
- 9 times 8 is...72.
- Hey, there.

2012
01:44:49,922 --> 01:44:51,857
How's it going, Bob?

2013
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:53,263
Good.

2014
01:44:53,264 --> 01:44:54,460
I have them memorized, Dad.

2015
01:44:54,461 --> 01:44:57,047
I only need about
2 more minutes.

2016
01:44:57,089 --> 01:44:58,423
I'll tell you what.

2017
01:44:58,465 --> 01:45:01,426
Why don't we just put these
on hold for a moment?

2018
01:45:01,468 --> 01:45:04,054
There's no rush here.

2019
01:45:04,096 --> 01:45:05,850
I'll help you,

2020
01:45:05,851 --> 01:45:08,437
and we'll do them
together sometime, ok?

2021
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,184
Have a seat.

2022
01:45:13,522 --> 01:45:15,493
So, you had a good 4th?

2023
01:45:15,578 --> 01:45:16,511
Yes, sir.

2024
01:45:16,512 --> 01:45:17,733
Good.

2025
01:45:22,781 --> 01:45:25,742
Here's a little something for you, Bob.

2026
01:45:26,952 --> 01:45:28,537
What is it?

2027
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:30,539
You'll find out.

2028
01:45:39,047 --> 01:45:42,468
Ok. I'll see you in a bit, all right?

2029
01:45:49,266 --> 01:45:50,767
How's he doing?

2030
01:45:50,809 --> 01:45:53,228
We didn't get into it, Deb.

2031
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:54,419
I figured, you know,
what the hell?

2032
01:45:54,420 --> 01:45:55,359
I just got home.

2033
01:45:55,689 --> 01:45:56,680
I'll deal with it tomorrow.

2034
01:45:56,732 --> 01:45:59,735
Great. soon as you're
unpacked, we can eat.

2035
01:46:00,402 --> 01:46:02,821
It's a little early, isn't it?

2036
01:46:02,863 --> 01:46:04,072
Early?

2037
01:46:04,156 --> 01:46:05,282
It's 7:00.

2038
01:46:05,324 --> 01:46:06,722
You always eat at 7:00.

2039
01:46:06,723 --> 01:46:09,006
Oh, that's right. I forgot. I'm...

2040
01:46:09,411 --> 01:46:11,205
Mr. Clockwork.

2041
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:15,209
Yeah, mister, uh...

2042
01:46:23,786 --> 01:46:26,072
I'm glad you're home, Al.

2043
01:46:26,073 --> 01:46:28,930
Well, Deb, I'm glad to be home.

2044
01:46:28,931 --> 01:46:30,724
I missed you.

2045
01:46:34,541 --> 01:46:37,271
I found this in the woods.

2046
01:46:37,272 --> 01:46:38,621
I thought you could use it

2047
01:46:38,622 --> 01:46:41,139
to put your jewelry in it.

2048
01:46:42,460 --> 01:46:43,878
Just caught my eye.

2049
01:46:46,365 --> 01:46:49,993
Thanks, Al. It's beautiful.

2050
01:46:50,045 --> 01:46:51,344
I think so, too.

2051
01:46:51,345 --> 01:46:53,314
Oh, what is this?

2052
01:46:58,627 --> 01:47:01,046
Now, whose are these?
