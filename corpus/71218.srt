1
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:46,892
Go on, Barbara.

2
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:52,446
We go back to our homeroom for dismissal.

3
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:55,492
Unless you have a pass
for sports or something.

4
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:00,847
Is that what you did
on the day in question?

5
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:04,363
No. Mr. Gettys asked me
to stay after class.

6
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:06,524
What happened next, Barbara?

7
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:09,446
He told me to sit in the chair
beside his desk.

8
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:13,849
If you will, in your own words,
tell us exactly what happened...

9
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,685
...in the next few minutes.

10
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:18,761
I told him I was afraid I'd miss my bus.

11
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:22,528
He promised I'd get to the bus on time
if I'd help him do something.

12
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:27,491
Before I could say anything,
he placed his hand inside my blouse.

13
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:32,412
I was so frightened. I didn't move.
I thought if I was just quiet it'd be okay.

14
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:36,122
Then his other hand went up
under inside my skirt.

15
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,930
Then, with his hand...

16
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,767
...he started moving back and forth...

17
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:44,612
...farther and farther inside my skirt.

18
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,089
He said he was testing to see
if I had any special feelings...

19
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:51,085
...that he wanted to see
what kind of feelings I had.

20
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:54,006
I was trying to think of something to say,
but I couldn't.

21
00:01:54,093 --> 00:01:56,243
I was confused, and he just kept on.

22
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,608
I asked him to stop,
but it was like he couldn't hear me.

23
00:01:58,693 --> 00:02:01,127
He just kept on with his hand.

24
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:03,332
Then I screamed.

25
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:07,048
Then he got mad and said
we'd have to try it again sometime.

26
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:08,486
Did he try again?

27
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,646
Not with me.

28
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,691
But with your friends?

29
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:14,327
Yes.

30
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:18,409
And after you had told them
what he had done to you...

31
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:23,209
...they told you what he had done to them!

32
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,532
Isn't that true?

33
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:27,768
Yes.

34
00:02:30,813 --> 00:02:32,405
I have nothing further.

35
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,963
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

36
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:46,643
Any chance, Your Honor,
for a short recess?

37
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,927
Of course.

38
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:50,687
This court will be in recess for 15 minutes.

39
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,405
- What...
- Not now, Bernice.

40
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:04,084
Lomax, what's wrong?

41
00:03:04,253 --> 00:03:06,972
As your attorney, I'm advising you
to keep the fuck away from me.

42
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,964
Why? What are you talking about?

43
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:12,568
The wife, the kid, the outrage.
You definitely had me fooled.

44
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,763
Hey, you're my lawyer.

45
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,321
You're here to defend me.

46
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:17,732
You know what I'm thinking?

47
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:20,168
Why not put you on the stand?
You can jerk off for the judge.

48
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:23,051
- You know she's lying.
- Get the hell away from me.

49
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:45,125
Well, hell, there you are.

50
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:49,167
Rumor was you were out
wandering in traffic.

51
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:50,966
Not now, Larry.

52
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:52,606
What's the game plan?

53
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:55,487
I got a 4:30 deadline. I need a quote.

54
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:56,967
Give me a quote.

55
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:58,042
Fuck off.

56
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:04,248
"Mr. Lomax had no comment
on today's events.

57
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:07,092
"Speculation, however, was widespread...

58
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:11,366
"...that the young lawyer's
unblemished string of victories...

59
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:13,126
"...would come to an end...

60
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:14,851
"...in this courtroom."

61
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:21,845
It was a nice run, Kev.

62
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,764
Had to close out someday.

63
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:26,245
Nobody wins them all.

64
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:50,729
Have you had any discipline problems
in math class this year?

65
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:53,204
No.

66
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,248
No?

67
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:58,888
Hasn't Mr. Gettys had to talk to you
repeatedly about your behavior?

68
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:01,612
Isn't that why he asked you
to stay after class?

69
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:02,808
No!

70
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:07,761
Have other teachers asked you
to stay after class?

71
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:09,002
Once or twice.

72
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,004
Did they want to talk to you
about your behavior?

73
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:12,651
Objection. Immaterial.

74
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:14,689
- Goes to motive.
- Overruled.

75
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:16,964
You may answer the question.

76
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:19,204
I don't know
what the other teachers wanted.

77
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:21,045
You'd have to talk to them.

78
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,563
You ever pass notes in class?

79
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:29,412
Maybe a note that...

80
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:31,290
...made fun of Mr. Gettys?

81
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:32,489
No.

82
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:33,604
No?

83
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:37,129
Never called him
a "disgusting pig monster"?

84
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:40,361
Order.

85
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:42,568
No.

86
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:45,692
Your Honor, I've pre-marked this
Defense Exhibit A.

87
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,845
Objection. We've had plenty of time
for discovery here.

88
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:52,012
I'm going to let this in, Mr. Lomax.

89
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:55,449
I'm also going to suggest
that if you have any other exhibits...

90
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:58,605
...you present them in a timely fashion,
or not at all.

91
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:02,883
I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong.

92
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,922
It's "huge hog beast."

93
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,884
This is your handwriting, isn't it?

94
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:11,123
- Yes, but...
- You wrote this in Gettys' class.

95
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:12,248
It's a joke.

96
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,244
"He's a huge hog beast.

97
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:18,008
"He probably eats
a thousand pancakes for breakfast."

98
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,924
You're writing about Mr. Gettys,
aren't you?

99
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:23,924
It was meant to be a joke.

100
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,131
Have you ever had a party
at your house, Barbara...

101
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:30,772
...when your parents were away?

102
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,491
Objection. Your Honor...

103
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:34,092
Credibility and bias.

104
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:35,526
Overruled.

105
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,605
Answer the question.

106
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:39,688
Yes.

107
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:44,650
Have you ever heard of a game
called "Special Places"?

108
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,645
You're under oath, Barbara.

109
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,644
A man's career...

110
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,246
...his reputation...

111
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,085
...his life is on the line.

112
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:55,811
This is not a joke.

113
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,691
Have you ever played "Special Places"?

114
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:05,448
Yes.

115
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:08,002
Is this game sexual in nature?

116
00:07:09,853 --> 00:07:12,492
Is this game sexual in nature?

117
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,601
We only played it once.

118
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:18,483
This special party, Barbara...

119
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:22,886
...this was the first time you told the story
about Mr. Gettys, wasn't it?

120
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:24,923
Yes.

121
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:28,005
I've spoken to other children
who were there that day.

122
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:30,973
Is there anything else
they may have told me about the party?

123
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:34,409
Objection! If he has other witnesses,
let him call them!

124
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:36,291
If I need to call those other children, I will!

125
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,046
I'm going to sustain that, Mr. Lomax.

126
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:41,251
Rephrase your question.

127
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,808
You threatened those children, didn't you?

128
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:50,292
That's not the way it happened.

129
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:54,571
You told them to lie, to falsely claim
that Mr. Gettys had hurt them.

130
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:56,211
These things did happen.

131
00:07:56,293 --> 00:08:00,730
If they didn't, you were going
to tell everyone about this special party.

132
00:08:01,053 --> 00:08:02,406
They happened to me.

133
00:08:02,493 --> 00:08:05,246
So you made up a story. A special story.

134
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:06,971
A story about a math teacher...

135
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,567
...who was tough on you,
who kept you after class.

136
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:12,042
A "huge hog beast" you didn't like!

137
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,563
That's what really happened, isn't it?

138
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:15,642
No.

139
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:18,532
I didn't want to be the only one.

140
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,367
You goddamn lowlife, son of a bitch...

141
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:29,811
No further questions, Your Honor.

142
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:31,929
I'm going to adjourn for the day.

143
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:36,241
We'll be back here at 9:00 a.m.
And people will behave themselves...

144
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:37,892
You made me proud.

145
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:40,123
...or find themselves in contempt.

146
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,247
Pack it up, baby. You need a drink.

147
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:57,688
In the event that we all get drunk,
let's front-Ioad the ceremonial bullshit.

148
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:00,048
To the best trial lawyer in Alachua County.

149
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,532
Damn straight.

150
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:04,324
So, Kev, off the record...

151
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:07,207
How's it feel to squeeze
a man like Gettys...

152
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:09,682
...through the door of reasonable doubt?

153
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:13,805
Why don't you quit being a party pooper.
Have yourself a drink.

154
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:16,407
We're not going to discuss
the damn case anymore.

155
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:17,528
Am I right?

156
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:19,171
I'll drink to that.

157
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,651
No shop talk.

158
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,247
Pour me another.

159
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,812
Lomax, you're wild.

160
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:32,403
I feel one of them nights coming on.

161
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:39,930
"I've seen the Taj Mahal
I've even been to China"

162
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:46,685
I've got to go piss!

163
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:50,690
I've got to go piss!

164
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,408
Hurry!

165
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,812
Hell of a job today.

166
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:09,049
I don't want to disturb your party.

167
00:10:14,693 --> 00:10:17,082
"Milton-Chadwick-Waters."

168
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,727
Never heard of it.

169
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:21,043
What are you going to do? Sue me?

170
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:24,412
Actually, we were hoping
to retain your services.

171
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,643
We've been following your progress.

172
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:28,881
From New York?

173
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:30,851
You've never lost a case.

174
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,969
I've had some sympathetic juries.

175
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:36,328
That's exactly what we're looking for.

176
00:10:36,413 --> 00:10:39,371
We want you to come to New York,
help us pick a jury.

177
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:45,972
I tell you, man...

178
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:48,130
...you're pretty damn good.

179
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:50,326
Your card is great.

180
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:51,926
You being black...

181
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:54,811
Whose idea was that? Paul's?

182
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,406
That's just brilliant.

183
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:59,133
I'm just not drunk enough yet to fall for it.

184
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:00,966
I'll buy you a drink when I...

185
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:02,964
You'd have to start next week.

186
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:07,046
All expenses, first-class travel and lodging,
you and your wife.

187
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:11,492
A lump-sum payment, regardless
of the verdict, in the amount of...

188
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:15,802
Take a look.

189
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:39,803
<i>In the name of Lord Jesus,</i>
<i>we refute you, Satan, and cast you out.</i>

190
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:41,083
Amen.

191
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:43,562
"Romans 16:19

192
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,010
"Be ever at what is good

193
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:49,886
"Be innocent

194
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,964
"Of evil

195
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:55,888
"And the God of Peace
will soon crush Satan

196
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:59,728
"Yes, God will crush him
underneath your feet

197
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:03,729
"And the God of Peace
will soon crush Satan

198
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:07,489
"Yes, God will crush him
underneath your feet"

199
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:22,451
All the way to New York just to pick a jury.

200
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:24,444
Every dog gets his day.

201
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:29,167
Why do I feel the hand of Mary Ann
on this adventure?

202
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:33,844
I gotta tell you, Ma,
this routine's getting awful tired.

203
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:35,725
Working on Sunday.

204
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:38,362
Working? Ma, get over it.

205
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,364
Listen to me. I love my wife.

206
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:44,923
Okay? I love her all the way.

207
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,007
Just like you.

208
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:50,523
Let me tell you about New York.

209
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:53,404
"Fallen, fallen, is Babylon.

210
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:56,291
"It has become
a dwelling place of demons."

211
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:57,886
"Revelation 18."

212
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,089
Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.

213
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:03,047
- Couldn't forget it if I tried.
- Oh, really?

214
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:06,089
And what happened to Babylon?

215
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,769
"Thou mighty city, in one hour
has thy mighty judgement come.

216
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:14,289
"And the light of a single lamp
shall shine in thee no more."

217
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:17,762
Wish me luck.

218
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:21,488
Good luck.

219
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,811
I'll miss you.

220
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:29,009
Jeannie, listen to me now.
I've gone the extra mile with you on this.

221
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:30,845
I'm trying to work with you.

222
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:35,563
They'll be looking for that payment
and if it's not there, they'll repo the car.

223
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,285
Okay, I gotta go.

224
00:13:47,253 --> 00:13:51,724
Look, Jeannie, I gotta make a plane.
Just get yourself on schedule.

225
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,324
Okay. Make the payment.

226
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:01,248
Let me guess. It's all my idea, right?

227
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,364
We better give her some grandkids soon
so I can get her off my back.

228
00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:06,852
What do you say?

229
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:10,411
Let her sweat a little.

230
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:43,086
All right, Mr. Clintine, let me ask you this:
Do you think, as a juror...

231
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:46,529
...you'd be able to set aside
any prior opinion you might hold...

232
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:48,888
...about the savings and loan industry?

233
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:51,246
That was a question, sir.

234
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,289
What? Do I like bankers?

235
00:14:59,253 --> 00:15:02,051
Your Honor, may I have a minute
to confer with my colleagues?

236
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,248
You may.

237
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:07,327
Dump him.

238
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:09,723
Let's get rid of Number four, six...

239
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,485
I'd say lose Number twelve...

240
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:13,484
...but the prosecutor's gonna fuck up
and do it for us.

241
00:15:13,573 --> 00:15:15,006
Number six?

242
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,169
You're kidding, right?
She's my first choice.

243
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,732
She's my first pass.

244
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:23,088
And four?

245
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,412
With the dreadlocks? That's crazy.

246
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:32,883
- That's a defendant's juror.
- Did you see his shoes?

247
00:15:34,053 --> 00:15:37,966
Look, kid, maybe down in Florida
you are the next big thing.

248
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:41,205
This is New York.
We're not squeezing oranges here.

249
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,332
He polishes those shoes every night.
He makes his own clothes.

250
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:50,363
He looks like a brother with an attitude,
but I see a man with a gun under his bed.

251
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,525
And woe betide the creature
who steps into his garden.

252
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:55,087
Number six...

253
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,006
...your favorite...

254
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,811
...she's damaged goods.

255
00:15:59,413 --> 00:16:02,132
She's a Catholic schoolteacher.

256
00:16:02,613 --> 00:16:04,365
Believes in human frailty...

257
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:06,683
No. Something's missing from her.

258
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:07,967
She's wrong.

259
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:10,206
She wants on this jury.

260
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:12,682
Somebody hurt her and she wants revenge.

261
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,003
How the hell do you know that?

262
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:19,167
I don't know.

263
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:24,165
Either you put a stop
to this happy horseshit or I walk.

264
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:26,323
Walk.

265
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:32,082
Here's the deal: If I lose with your jury,
you do the explaining.

266
00:16:33,013 --> 00:16:34,765
Your Honor, may I continue?

267
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:37,970
We'd like to excuse
Jurors three, four and six.

268
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:30,972
Hi. You're home early for a change.

269
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:36,486
Your mother called.

270
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:39,283
She has her "bad feeling."

271
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:45,968
Every now and then, she gets one right.

272
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:49,488
You okay?

273
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:53,526
Something's up.

274
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:56,966
They deliberated for 38 minutes.

275
00:18:01,693 --> 00:18:03,763
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

276
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:10,251
What the hell did they expect?
The man is as guilty as can be.

277
00:18:10,653 --> 00:18:13,372
Wasn't a jury anywhere gonna let him off.

278
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:15,288
Yeah.

279
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:18,408
Except one.

280
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:19,689
What?

281
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:26,731
Not fucking guilty!

282
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:29,448
Oh, my God! You lying...

283
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:30,887
...sack of shit!

284
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:32,964
Thirty-eight minutes, my jury!

285
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,205
Thirty-eight minutes!

286
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:39,928
- You did it!
- My jury! I'm too good!

287
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,493
- <i>Glad you could stick around.</i>
- <i>It's your dime.</i>

288
00:18:46,573 --> 00:18:47,642
Sorry to keep you waiting.

289
00:18:47,733 --> 00:18:51,089
Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia
longer than expected.

290
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:52,966
Good morning, Caprice.

291
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,046
Good morning, Mr. Heath.

292
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,361
Your messages.

293
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:01,447
Not bad, huh?

294
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:04,005
You can play it cool if you want...

295
00:19:04,093 --> 00:19:07,130
...but when I first walked in,
my jaw was on the floor.

296
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:11,528
This is our home office.

297
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:13,126
We have many
international arrangements...

298
00:19:13,213 --> 00:19:15,727
...so Mr. Milton spends a great deal
of his time in the air.

299
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:17,246
Three o'clock, we got the Greeks.

300
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,164
Am I a good cop or a bad cop?

301
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:20,925
We may not need a good cop.

302
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:22,082
I love it.

303
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:26,652
In addition to our corporate clients
we're representing 25 foreign countries:

304
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,691
The Mideast, the Balkans,
Central America, West Africa...

305
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:32,241
Interesting work, but travel-intensive.

306
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:26,568
Behind you.

307
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:29,162
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:30,971
Please. Kevin Lomax.

309
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:32,568
John Milton.

310
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:33,972
Nice to meet you.

311
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:40,209
So?

312
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:43,010
Have we been treating you well?

313
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:44,162
Very well, thank you.

314
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:46,164
And your wife, she's had a good time?

315
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:49,609
She sure has. It's been great.
The whole thing's been great.

316
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:53,572
That's our secret:

317
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,491
Kill you with kindness.

318
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,332
What's your secret?

319
00:20:59,973 --> 00:21:01,406
I couldn't say.

320
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:03,127
You were a prosecutor.

321
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:06,762
Out of law school.
Five years in the Jacksonville D.A.'s office.

322
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:11,048
Sixty-four straight convictions.

323
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:13,802
What a number!

324
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,005
I like to be in court.

325
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,971
I didn't plea out a lot.

326
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,042
What's that like?

327
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:23,170
One day you put them away,
the next you set them free.

328
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:25,731
Takes a little getting used to.

329
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:27,371
Pays better, though, doesn't it?

330
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,011
Yes, it does.

331
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:34,810
That math teacher, the Gettys case...
now I hear you were brilliant.

332
00:21:35,533 --> 00:21:37,285
Prosecutor dropped the ball.

333
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:38,408
Really?

334
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:40,805
You think your guy was guilty?

335
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:42,121
I didn't say that.

336
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:43,441
What'd you say?

337
00:21:44,573 --> 00:21:45,847
How's this:

338
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:49,165
I began the case with a clear conscience.

339
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:58,004
I was sure you had a secret.

340
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:02,601
The men's room.

341
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:05,361
Upstairs men's room
in the Duval County courthouse.

342
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:08,013
There's a hole in the wall to the next room.

343
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,846
I spent five years listening
to juries deliberate.

344
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:12,691
- I love it.
- Love it all you want.

345
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:14,001
Just don't repeat it.

346
00:22:14,093 --> 00:22:17,403
I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association
would appreciate it.

347
00:22:17,493 --> 00:22:19,370
My lips are sealed.

348
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:22,845
You don't really want to go back
to Florida, do you?

349
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:28,127
Walk with me.

350
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:49,166
What do you think?

351
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:52,170
Some people can't handle it.

352
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:54,847
It's peaceful.

353
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:58,050
My sentiments exactly.

354
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:04,244
Fill in the résumé for me.
Tell me, your father, what does he do?

355
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:07,969
I never got to know my father.
He passed away before I was born.

356
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:10,522
My mother raised me. Just the two of us.

357
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:11,887
She never remarried?

358
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,043
She wasn't married the first time.

359
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:17,371
That can't be easy in a town
like Gainesville, can it?

360
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:20,249
I don't think it's easy anywhere.

361
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:23,602
Holy shit!

362
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:26,844
Different when you're looking down,
isn't it?

363
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:28,571
Yes, it is.

364
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:30,732
Oh, my God.

365
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:32,322
Your mother...

366
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:34,006
...what's she like?

367
00:23:34,773 --> 00:23:37,241
She's a preacher's daughter. She's tough.

368
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:40,769
She's worked in a poultry plant
for as long as I can remember.

369
00:23:40,893 --> 00:23:44,772
She's got a church she really likes,
so she's usually there or they go out...

370
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,764
They do a lot of volunteer work.

371
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:50,368
"Behold, I send you out
as sheep amidst the wolves."

372
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,241
So they say.

373
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:55,167
It didn't rub off?

374
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:56,925
The Book? The Church?

375
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:58,851
No, I'm on parole.

376
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:01,408
Early release for time served.

377
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:07,288
A lot of potential clients down there.

378
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,166
Are we negotiating?

379
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:11,128
Always.

380
00:24:12,733 --> 00:24:14,689
Can I ask you a question, then?

381
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,887
Why do you need a criminal department?

382
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:21,648
Our clients break the law like anyone else.

383
00:24:24,853 --> 00:24:28,084
I'm just tired of sending their business
across the street.

384
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:31,651
- Are you offering me a job?
- I'm thinking about it.

385
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:36,570
I know you've got talent.
I knew that before you got here.

386
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:40,290
It's just the other thing I wonder about.

387
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:42,848
What thing?

388
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:45,968
Pressure.

389
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,089
It changes everything. Pressure.

390
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:52,285
Some people, you squeeze them,
they focus.

391
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:54,052
Others fold.

392
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,363
Can you summon your talent at will?

393
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:00,930
Can you deliver on a deadline?

394
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:03,885
Can you sleep at night?

395
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:07,091
When do we talk about money?

396
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,242
Money?

397
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,846
That's the easy part.

398
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:16,804
<i>They call this part of Fifth Avenue,</i>
<i>Carnegie Hill.</i>

399
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:19,612
<i>You've got the park right across the street,</i>
<i>and the reservoir.</i>

400
00:25:19,693 --> 00:25:21,285
<i>Best jogging in New York.</i>

401
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:23,045
<i>Mount Sinai Hospital is up the street.</i>

402
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:24,725
<i>Some excellent schools.</i>

403
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:28,212
Not on the top of Mr. Milton's list
when he bought this building...

404
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,602
...but great neighborhood for children.

405
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:31,967
Great building.

406
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:35,442
Follow the money all the way to the top.

407
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:38,810
You've got the managing director,
Eddie Barzoon, on 16.

408
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:41,567
And, of course, Mr. Milton has the tower.

409
00:25:44,733 --> 00:25:46,451
- You must be Mary Ann?
- Yes, I am.

410
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:48,763
Welcome. I'm Jackie Heath.

411
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:51,566
It's nice of you to come by.

412
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:53,848
Oh, please. We live across the hall.

413
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:55,890
- You're kidding.
- Right there.

414
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,249
It's just two apartments per floor?

415
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:02,087
- You didn't tell them about it?
- It can speak for itself.

416
00:26:03,293 --> 00:26:04,442
<i>Voilà!</i>

417
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:11,607
Oh, my God!

418
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:15,128
It's what they call a "Classic Eight."

419
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,801
Be careful. I don't have a map.
I don't want you to get lost.

420
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:22,125
We had them paint it white. Let you see it
naked before you pick your palette.

421
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,407
What am I picking?

422
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:24,812
Palette. Your colors.

423
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:25,848
Oh, yes.

424
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:30,404
I need to warn you about one thing.

425
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:34,327
There are going to be some
very envious people down at the firm.

426
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,963
There aren't many of these apartments.
They're a partner's perk.

427
00:26:38,053 --> 00:26:40,248
You must've made quite an impression.

428
00:26:40,453 --> 00:26:44,048
Oh, my God, three bedrooms.
You know what that means?

429
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:45,648
Babies.

430
00:26:45,853 --> 00:26:47,969
It took us six years to get in here.

431
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:53,486
Unbelievable.

432
00:26:55,453 --> 00:26:56,932
Thank you very much.

433
00:27:01,093 --> 00:27:03,004
Are you really this good?

434
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:05,645
I sure as hell hope so.

435
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,844
They must want you pretty bad.

436
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:11,727
Look, Mar...

437
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:15,811
...I'm only getting behind this
if you're on board.

438
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:17,725
If you want to go home...

439
00:27:18,373 --> 00:27:19,647
...I'm with you.

440
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,002
Sure.

441
00:27:21,653 --> 00:27:24,372
Let's go back to Gainesville,
back to the condo.

442
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:28,732
You keep scrounging for clients and
I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian.

443
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:32,203
And maybe, just maybe,
if we kill ourselves...

444
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:37,645
...in about five years we can afford a baby
and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores.

445
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:39,731
Are you shitting me?

446
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,448
I love you.

447
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,526
I love you, too.

448
00:27:52,373 --> 00:27:54,364
Tadashi Osumi, Media.

449
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,364
Walter Krasna, Maritime Law.

450
00:27:57,053 --> 00:27:58,532
Bashir Toabal, Energy Law.

451
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:00,285
I run the Islamic subgroup.

452
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:03,092
Joyce Rensaleer, Mergers and Acquisitions.

453
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:06,165
Eddie Barzoon, Managing Director and...

454
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:08,201
...Real Estate.

455
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,847
Pradeed Resh, Intellectual Properties.

456
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:14,291
Christabella Andrioli,
International Trade and Customs...

457
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:15,886
...EC and G-7.

458
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:19,612
There it is, Kevin.

459
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:21,247
The whole team.

460
00:28:21,693 --> 00:28:24,366
Welcome to Milton, Chadwick and Waters.

461
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:27,247
So what do you think?
You can change the furniture if you like.

462
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,891
I guess it'll do.

463
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:30,692
Until something better comes along?

464
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:32,525
Kevin Lomax, Pam Garrety.

465
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,606
Nice to meet you.

466
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:36,969
Pam was at the Brooklyn D.A.'s office
for 14 years...

467
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:39,726
...so she knows her way
around the local scene.

468
00:28:39,893 --> 00:28:41,963
You'll expedite his bar application?

469
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,090
It's in the pipeline.
For now, you'll work <i>pro hac vice</i>.

470
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:47,607
I petitioned Florida
for a letter of good conduct.

471
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:51,527
And I prepared, at Mr. Milton's request,
an overview of the Moyez case.

472
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:52,882
The Moyez case?

473
00:28:54,613 --> 00:28:56,046
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

474
00:29:16,613 --> 00:29:17,932
What do you think?

475
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:20,527
It's a health code case and it's a loser.

476
00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:24,132
So what's the point?

477
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:27,964
He wants to see if I'll plea-bargain.
It's a test, right?

478
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:30,332
Isn't everything?

479
00:29:32,493 --> 00:29:34,927
It's an 18th-century Italian silk damask...

480
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:38,972
...with an embossed floriated pattern
of undulating acanthus leaves.

481
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:40,486
Lovely, isn't it?

482
00:29:42,253 --> 00:29:44,289
And this is about what?

483
00:29:44,653 --> 00:29:45,688
The price?

484
00:29:46,373 --> 00:29:48,762
It's about $2,000 a panel.

485
00:29:49,973 --> 00:29:51,292
We'll take it...

486
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:53,087
...at $1,400.

487
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:54,931
You made it.

488
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:58,928
I thought you said it was impossible.

489
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:01,163
I thought you said it was important.

490
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,531
<i>Go get them, man.</i>

491
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:12,843
<i>Tell him, "Cut that shit down!"</i>

492
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:16,011
<i>I know what they're doing over there!</i>
<i>That's right!</i>

493
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:19,726
<i>Tell him, "Take all that noise</i>
<i>back to Africa. "</i>

494
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:32,012
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Phillipe Moyez.

495
00:30:44,213 --> 00:30:46,681
Look, I'm not sure I'm making myself clear.

496
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:49,606
Moyez, you need him? To speak with him?

497
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:51,812
Show him your boots.

498
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:56,773
You're saying he's down here
in the basement?

499
00:30:57,373 --> 00:30:58,408
In the dark?

500
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:00,563
Where do you think I'm taking you?

501
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:12,449
I thought I would recognize you...

502
00:31:14,413 --> 00:31:15,687
...but I do not.

503
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:18,288
Mr. Moyez?

504
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:21,886
We've never met.

505
00:31:22,693 --> 00:31:24,923
I'm Kevin Lomax. I'm a lawyer.

506
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:27,805
I'm here about the animals.

507
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:32,132
We have an investment in blood.

508
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:36,248
Think of it as spiritual currency.

509
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:39,645
"Spiritual currency."

510
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:44,930
Look, Mr. Moyez,
I'm going to need your help with this.

511
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:51,804
What is the name of the man...

512
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:53,565
...who will prosecute us?

513
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:55,562
Merto.

514
00:31:56,053 --> 00:31:58,647
Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto.

515
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:05,730
What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?

516
00:32:06,213 --> 00:32:09,011
With this tongue, we create silence.

517
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:10,681
You can go now.

518
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,844
You will have all the help...

519
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:14,446
...I can give you...

520
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:17,004
...against <i>Monsieur</i> Merto.

521
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:26,803
It's arbor green. What do you think?

522
00:32:27,893 --> 00:32:29,531
Not with your complexion.

523
00:32:33,853 --> 00:32:35,764
New York City health codes.

524
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:37,448
That's all of it?

525
00:32:37,533 --> 00:32:38,682
Not quite.

526
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:44,721
Thanks.

527
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:50,252
Caribbean green.

528
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:53,083
Something cooler, maybe. Cooler.

529
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:54,481
A cooler green.

530
00:32:58,493 --> 00:32:59,892
Too institutional.

531
00:33:00,613 --> 00:33:01,682
I love green.

532
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:06,005
I love it but it's one thing to wear it
and another to have it on your walls.

533
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,443
I'm just trying to help. It's your walls.
Do what you want.

534
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,253
Remember, it's only a health-code case.

535
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:42,932
This is the first time since I was 13,
I don't have a job...

536
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,087
...or two.

537
00:33:45,653 --> 00:33:47,883
I feel like I'm floating around in that place.

538
00:33:47,973 --> 00:33:50,533
You know, just drifting around
or something.

539
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:54,005
You'll settle in.

540
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:57,127
We had this little office in the condo...

541
00:33:57,293 --> 00:33:58,362
Thanks.

542
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:01,730
You know, his side and my side. Real nice.

543
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:05,725
At night, I'd go to sleep,
I'd see that light on...

544
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:10,291
If I want to see Leamon...

545
00:34:10,813 --> 00:34:12,451
...I make an appointment.

546
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:19,251
You're kidding, right?

547
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:25,725
God, how do you handle it?

548
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,089
Take a look around, honey.

549
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,763
Look, you've got three choices.

550
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:32,525
The Holy Trinity:

551
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:34,767
You can work...

552
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,372
...you can play...

553
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,012
...or you can breed.

554
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:43,244
That's a veal roast, Your Honor.

555
00:34:43,573 --> 00:34:45,803
USDA approved and stamped.

556
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:49,001
Men kill animals and eat their flesh.

557
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:51,570
Phillipe Moyez killed a goat.

558
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:54,046
He killed a goat.

559
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,924
And he did it at home...

560
00:34:57,373 --> 00:35:00,604
...in a manner consistent
with his religious beliefs.

561
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:03,807
Now, Mr. Merto may find that bizarre.

562
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:08,046
It's certainly not a religious practice
performed by everyone.

563
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:10,693
It's not as common as, say...

564
00:35:10,853 --> 00:35:12,172
...circumcision.

565
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:14,769
It's not as common as the belief that...

566
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:17,287
...wine transforms into blood.

567
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:21,489
Some people handle poisonous snakes
to prove their faith.

568
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:24,044
Some people walk on fire.

569
00:35:24,693 --> 00:35:26,445
Phillipe Moyez killed a goat.

570
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:27,807
And he did it...

571
00:35:28,653 --> 00:35:31,804
...while observing
his constitutionally protected...

572
00:35:32,373 --> 00:35:33,886
...religious beliefs.

573
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:38,485
Your Honor, this case
is not about keeping goats...

574
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:41,407
...or transporting goats or goat licensing.

575
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:46,087
The city was less concerned
with the care of the animals...

576
00:35:46,173 --> 00:35:48,448
...than the manner in which
they were slaughtered.

577
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:49,966
Objection!

578
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,884
Enough, enough. I got it.

579
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,086
Let's wrap it up.

580
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:55,727
Your Honor...

581
00:35:56,693 --> 00:35:59,446
...the city timed this police action
to catch my client...

582
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:03,492
...exercising his constitutionally protected
right to religious freedom.

583
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:06,327
This is a law protecting kosher butchering.

584
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:07,892
Exactly, Your Honor.

585
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:11,284
I'd like to move at this time
for a verdict of dismissal.

586
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:14,644
I happen to know a little bit
about kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.

587
00:36:15,053 --> 00:36:16,805
I'm aware of that, Your Honor.

588
00:36:16,893 --> 00:36:19,885
That's why I feel confident
in requesting a dismissal.

589
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:22,562
Mr. Merto?

590
00:36:28,773 --> 00:36:30,411
For God's sake, man...

591
00:36:37,813 --> 00:36:39,883
Congratulations. Great job.

592
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:42,807
Bravo! Bravo!

593
00:36:44,373 --> 00:36:46,284
Pamela, you look lovely.

594
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:48,001
So, Phillipe...

595
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:49,242
...satisfied?

596
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,846
Always, Jean.

597
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:54,610
What can I say?

598
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,766
<i>Outstanding.</i>

599
00:36:57,893 --> 00:37:00,566
<i>Go figure it, a guy like Moyez...</i>

600
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:03,322
<i>... living in some subterranean shithole...</i>

601
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:07,008
...all the while he's walking around
with $15 million in the bank.

602
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:08,527
You're kidding.

603
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:11,241
What do you think he's paying us in?
Goat's blood?

604
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:14,962
Tarzan, we're billing you out
at $400 an hour, my friend.

605
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:18,523
I don't see a whole lot of pro-bono work
in your immediate future.

606
00:37:18,613 --> 00:37:21,650
I figured you came down to make sure
I didn't fuck this up.

607
00:37:21,733 --> 00:37:23,007
Maybe I did.

608
00:37:23,693 --> 00:37:26,890
Don't get too cocky, my boy.
No matter how good you are...

609
00:37:27,093 --> 00:37:29,812
...don't let them see you coming.
That's the gaffe, my friend.

610
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:31,963
You've gotta keep yourself small.

611
00:37:32,173 --> 00:37:33,208
Innocuous.

612
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:34,846
Be the little guy.

613
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,924
You know, the nerd, the leper...

614
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,642
...the shitkicking surfer. Look at me.

615
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:44,043
Underestimated from day one.

616
00:37:44,933 --> 00:37:48,243
You'd never think I was
a master of the universe, would you?

617
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:52,046
That's your only weakness,
as far as I can see.

618
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:53,328
What's that?

619
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:54,967
It's the look.

620
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:56,761
That Florida stud thing.

621
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:58,002
What is that?

622
00:37:58,253 --> 00:38:01,609
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I leave my boots under your bed?

623
00:38:01,973 --> 00:38:03,964
Never worked a jury that didn't have
a woman.

624
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:05,884
You know what you're missing?

625
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:07,771
You're missing what I have.

626
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:12,361
There's this beautiful girl,
just fucked me 40 ways from Sunday...

627
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:16,083
...we're done, she's walking
to the bathroom, trying to walk...

628
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,481
...she turns...

629
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,367
...she looks...

630
00:38:19,893 --> 00:38:21,008
...it's me.

631
00:38:21,773 --> 00:38:24,845
Not the Trojan army that just fucked her.
Little old me.

632
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:27,650
She gets this look on her face like:

633
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:29,644
"How the hell did that happen?"

634
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,202
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt.

635
00:38:35,173 --> 00:38:36,686
I'm a surprise, Kevin.

636
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:39,051
They don't see me coming.

637
00:38:39,373 --> 00:38:40,931
That's what you're missing.

638
00:38:41,013 --> 00:38:42,526
Where's the chicken?

639
00:38:54,853 --> 00:38:59,449
There's a chicken, plays tic-tac-toe,
never loses. He's famous.

640
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,331
Never loses, like you.

641
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:07,723
Come on. I'll show you
the fastest way uptown.

642
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:09,883
Learn the subways, Kevin.

643
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,042
Use them.

644
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:14,045
Stay in the trenches.

645
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:16,366
Only way I travel.

646
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:25,325
What happened to the green?

647
00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:26,608
I loved the green!

648
00:39:26,693 --> 00:39:27,728
Honey, you're late!

649
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:30,532
We're due up at the Barzoon's palace
in 15 minutes.

650
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:32,285
What's all this?

651
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,488
All what?

652
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:37,248
Jackie says the "who's who" of New York
is gonna be there tonight.

653
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:39,723
- All this?
- Oh, that.

654
00:39:40,453 --> 00:39:42,364
It was going to be a nursery...

655
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,771
...then I remembered you'd have to be
home long enough to knock me up.

656
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:48,572
So now I'm thinking of building
a law library.

657
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:50,446
Oh, baby.

658
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,485
Tell me I can handle this.

659
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:57,086
You can handle this.

660
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,449
- Say something nice.
- Something nice.

661
00:40:03,093 --> 00:40:06,290
Promise me you won't
leave me alone in there.

662
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:08,252
I promise.

663
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:14,730
There you are.

664
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:20,249
Diana Barzoon. Eddie's wife.

665
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:21,846
Nice to meet you.

666
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:25,051
Kevin Lomax, Health Code Warrior.

667
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:26,328
All hail.

668
00:40:26,413 --> 00:40:29,485
- Mr. Barzoon, this is Mary Ann.
- Nice to meet you.

669
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,924
Well, Kevin, here they are.

670
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:35,769
Top of the food chain and dinner is served.

671
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,446
I throw these parties twice a year.

672
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:42,049
Stock market, real estate, politics. They're
all players, and they're all prospects.

673
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:44,168
Congratulations.

674
00:40:44,253 --> 00:40:46,084
Remember Rashid? Just in from Beirut.

675
00:40:46,173 --> 00:40:47,367
Congratulations.

676
00:40:47,453 --> 00:40:49,489
Bright young lights.

677
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:52,764
You're going to like this. Come on.

678
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:55,242
Somebody I want you to meet.

679
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:58,610
Kevin and Mary Ann Lomax,
this is Senator Alfonse D'Amato.

680
00:40:58,773 --> 00:41:00,491
Ambassador Charles Gagano.

681
00:41:00,573 --> 00:41:03,690
In case you didn't know,
these are the Republicans of New York.

682
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:06,003
Barzoon always overstates things.

683
00:41:06,413 --> 00:41:10,167
Donald Trump was supposed to be here,
but he had a business emergency.

684
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:13,731
I knew I'd find you here.
I'd like you to meet my wife.

685
00:41:13,813 --> 00:41:15,166
Mary Ann, this is Pam Garrety.

686
00:41:15,253 --> 00:41:16,971
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

687
00:41:17,053 --> 00:41:19,362
- We're partners in crime.
- Someone you must meet.

688
00:41:19,453 --> 00:41:21,284
Excuse me. This is important.

689
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:24,012
- You are so beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

690
00:41:24,813 --> 00:41:27,043
- I heard you met the senator.
- Yes, I did.

691
00:41:27,133 --> 00:41:28,486
- I was married to him.
- Really?

692
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:29,688
Kidding.

693
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:36,213
I'd like you to meet Kevin Lomax.
Kevin is from Florida.

694
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,011
He's new to the firm.

695
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,449
The senator cannot leave.

696
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:43,044
Who's that with the senator?

697
00:41:44,373 --> 00:41:46,523
- Oh, God, girl.
- You haven't met him yet?

698
00:41:46,613 --> 00:41:47,807
No, who is he?

699
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:50,329
I swear he can hear us.

700
00:41:50,493 --> 00:41:52,370
Hell, he can smell us.

701
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:54,286
Mary Ann...

702
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:56,008
...John Milton.

703
00:41:56,093 --> 00:41:59,165
I was hoping I'd see you here tonight.
And here you are.

704
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:01,323
Already swimming with the sharks.

705
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:03,006
Careful, hon.

706
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:07,921
Come on, if you keep thinking small,
we'll never make any money on you.

707
00:42:08,053 --> 00:42:09,725
These parties don't come cheap.

708
00:42:09,813 --> 00:42:12,486
Call him. Talk to him.
See what they have to say.

709
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:14,643
Just get it on tape.

710
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:18,486
It's a wonderful opportunity for Kevin.

711
00:42:19,093 --> 00:42:21,766
Yes, Kevin.
He's going to do all right if he...

712
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:24,689
...buys a few new suits...

713
00:42:25,533 --> 00:42:28,366
...learns a few new tricks, he's there.

714
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:30,612
It's you. What about you?

715
00:42:30,693 --> 00:42:33,161
Your family, you've got to miss them. No?

716
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:39,452
I told Kevin the only thing worse
than not having a father was having mine.

717
00:42:40,653 --> 00:42:41,802
I can relate.

718
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:45,165
I can, believe me.

719
00:42:53,653 --> 00:42:55,405
The worst vice is advice.

720
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,370
But may I make a suggestion?

721
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:03,443
It's a sensitive...

722
00:43:04,853 --> 00:43:07,572
It's about your hair, that's why I ask.

723
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,130
No, go ahead.

724
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:12,571
I mean, you don't like it?

725
00:43:13,653 --> 00:43:15,689
I like it fine. It's beautiful.

726
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:17,647
It's just...

727
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:20,571
It doesn't belong to you.

728
00:43:21,373 --> 00:43:23,204
You're too alive for a perm.

729
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:24,892
It's not you.

730
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:27,724
You should pull your hair back.

731
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:31,930
Do it. See what happens.

732
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:34,561
Right now, here, you want me
to pull my hair back?

733
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,086
Is that so terrible?

734
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:38,731
I'd love to do it, but if I did...

735
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:41,566
...everyone in this room
who's pretending not to be watching us...

736
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:45,043
...would naturally assume
that we were fucking or something.

737
00:43:48,373 --> 00:43:49,488
Please.

738
00:43:54,253 --> 00:43:55,288
Okay.

739
00:44:05,453 --> 00:44:06,966
It's fun to be right.

740
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:11,202
Excuse me.

741
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:14,806
That's a vision.

742
00:44:17,213 --> 00:44:18,965
You've gotta cut your hair.

743
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:23,012
Are you serious?

744
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:27,042
A woman's shoulders are the frontlines
of her mystique.

745
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:30,241
And her neck...

746
00:44:32,093 --> 00:44:33,572
...if she's alive...

747
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:37,762
...has all the mystery of a border town.

748
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,890
A no man's land...

749
00:44:44,253 --> 00:44:45,686
...in that battle...

750
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:48,242
...between the mind and the body.

751
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:51,208
You know...

752
00:44:52,373 --> 00:44:54,489
...your natural color would really...

753
00:44:54,573 --> 00:44:56,325
...bring out your eyes.

754
00:45:10,813 --> 00:45:12,326
Do you have this view?

755
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,328
Sorry?

756
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:17,328
From your terrace, is this your view?

757
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:19,446
Not exactly.

758
00:45:20,173 --> 00:45:21,925
No terrace and I'm about...

759
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:23,925
...twelve floors down.

760
00:45:24,653 --> 00:45:25,881
What about you?

761
00:45:26,773 --> 00:45:28,411
No, I live downtown.

762
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:30,808
This is a...

763
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:32,532
...family building.

764
00:45:33,693 --> 00:45:35,046
Sounds like fun.

765
00:45:37,133 --> 00:45:38,452
Downtown, I mean.

766
00:45:39,213 --> 00:45:41,283
I'm just getting to know the city.

767
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:43,764
Is it everything you expected?

768
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:45,368
More.

769
00:45:45,613 --> 00:45:48,810
I say we ride them as far as we can,
and then eat them.

770
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:52,811
Excuse me, Jackie.
Have you guys seen Kevin anywhere?

771
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:54,770
No, I'm sure he's around.

772
00:45:57,653 --> 00:45:59,006
Are you alone?

773
00:46:02,253 --> 00:46:03,606
You mean, tonight?

774
00:46:06,253 --> 00:46:08,209
Is your wife a jealous woman?

775
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:17,052
Oh, dear, I'm going to scare you away.

776
00:46:18,293 --> 00:46:19,408
No, really...

777
00:46:19,493 --> 00:46:20,608
...I'm fine.

778
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:22,448
I'm fine.

779
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:24,046
Bet you like to be on top.

780
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:26,283
- Don't you?
- Excuse me?

781
00:46:26,973 --> 00:46:28,565
Of the situation.

782
00:46:28,973 --> 00:46:31,362
You prefer to be on top, right?

783
00:46:33,093 --> 00:46:34,572
Depends on the view.

784
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:39,046
You know what I see?

785
00:46:40,973 --> 00:46:42,372
I see the future...

786
00:46:43,173 --> 00:46:44,606
...of this law firm.

787
00:47:01,213 --> 00:47:03,568
We need to talk, Kevin.
Something's come up.

788
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:07,248
But first I want you to find
Heath and Eddie Barzoon.

789
00:47:08,573 --> 00:47:11,087
Bring them up to my place. Do it quietly.

790
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:12,208
Quickly.

791
00:47:14,253 --> 00:47:16,813
No problem. Arnold has a few reporters
in his pocket.

792
00:47:16,893 --> 00:47:19,088
We'll plant a story and destroy his
credibility.

793
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:20,526
Have you seen Kevin?

794
00:47:20,613 --> 00:47:22,524
- No, I haven't, sweetie.
- Okay.

795
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:26,241
If he doesn't come to us, he'll regret it.

796
00:47:46,093 --> 00:47:47,048
Come on.

797
00:47:58,733 --> 00:48:00,166
Is there more to it?

798
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:02,566
Just this room.

799
00:48:03,773 --> 00:48:05,525
And a bedroom?

800
00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:08,408
No bedroom.

801
00:48:08,893 --> 00:48:11,043
- Where does he sleep?
- Who says he sleeps?

802
00:48:11,133 --> 00:48:12,327
Where does he fuck?

803
00:48:12,413 --> 00:48:13,528
Everywhere!

804
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:17,567
What's up, John?

805
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,811
How many hours did we bill
Alex Cullen for last year?

806
00:48:23,213 --> 00:48:25,124
16,242.

807
00:48:25,293 --> 00:48:26,692
What did he do now?

808
00:48:27,453 --> 00:48:30,843
Alex Cullen has just been charged
with murdering his wife...

809
00:48:31,693 --> 00:48:33,012
...her stepson...

810
00:48:33,293 --> 00:48:34,487
...and a maid.

811
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:38,361
When did this happen?

812
00:48:38,453 --> 00:48:39,932
Just now. Tonight.

813
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:43,012
I've sent Pam downtown
to make bail arrangements.

814
00:48:43,293 --> 00:48:45,443
They're gonna fucking crucify him.

815
00:48:45,573 --> 00:48:48,451
They're gonna line up! I gotta call Meisel.

816
00:48:48,573 --> 00:48:51,087
I want Kevin on this case.

817
00:48:53,053 --> 00:48:54,566
I hope you're kidding.

818
00:48:58,173 --> 00:49:02,724
Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan
triple murder with, excuse me, Kevin?

819
00:49:03,613 --> 00:49:04,887
You're dreaming!

820
00:49:07,373 --> 00:49:09,523
You know, I've shaken hands...

821
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:12,890
...with every marquee defense attorney
in this town.

822
00:49:13,213 --> 00:49:15,602
I'd take Kevin and I don't look back.

823
00:49:16,493 --> 00:49:19,291
John, you've got a great eye for talent.

824
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:23,571
You're the master, but you know,
I just don't see this happening.

825
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,971
I want you on board, Eddie.

826
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:31,929
I appreciate the vote of confidence,
but maybe Eddie has a point here.

827
00:49:32,293 --> 00:49:34,853
We can get this case.
The man's our client.

828
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:37,324
He's a business client.

829
00:49:37,813 --> 00:49:39,963
We know him better
than he knows himself.

830
00:49:40,053 --> 00:49:41,964
We've got the inside track.

831
00:49:42,293 --> 00:49:46,127
We've got the best damn trial lawyer
in the city. It's ours to lose.

832
00:49:48,973 --> 00:49:50,452
Tell that to Cullen.

833
00:49:51,253 --> 00:49:52,925
I want Kevin to tell him.

834
00:49:53,453 --> 00:49:55,045
There's Pam.

835
00:49:57,813 --> 00:50:00,202
You gonna fight for this thing or not?

836
00:50:07,893 --> 00:50:08,848
Pam?

837
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:10,561
No, it's Kevin.

838
00:50:12,653 --> 00:50:15,247
No, it's okay. I'm on it. Yeah, I'm on it.

839
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:17,012
Where are we at?

840
00:50:24,053 --> 00:50:25,486
You left me there.

841
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:31,048
I had a fucking panic attack
until Jackie told me where you were.

842
00:50:31,853 --> 00:50:33,889
Three hours! You don't even call!

843
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:34,883
Stop.

844
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:36,368
Reset.

845
00:50:37,173 --> 00:50:40,210
I'm upstairs with Milton,
Heath and Barzoon.

846
00:50:40,493 --> 00:50:44,452
There's a good possibility I'm about
to catch a triple homicide defendant...

847
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:45,886
...who also happens to be...

848
00:50:45,973 --> 00:50:49,124
...one of the largest real-estate developers
in this city.

849
00:50:50,493 --> 00:50:52,211
I had to bail on the party.

850
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,210
You bailed on me.

851
00:50:57,373 --> 00:50:59,682
- Did you hear me?
- I was all by myself!

852
00:50:59,853 --> 00:51:01,411
For three whole hours.

853
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:04,326
The next time you make a promise,
try and keep it!

854
00:51:04,653 --> 00:51:06,086
You gotta be kidding me, right?

855
00:51:06,173 --> 00:51:09,370
Go to hell. And you can go to sleep
on the fucking couch!

856
00:51:12,813 --> 00:51:15,725
- You sure he's up there?
- Yeah, CNN passed the word.

857
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:17,482
<i>Look at this.</i>

858
00:51:17,613 --> 00:51:20,923
<i>I'm not out 20 minutes,</i>
<i>and I'm being followed by the press.</i>

859
00:51:21,173 --> 00:51:22,401
They're like insects.

860
00:51:22,493 --> 00:51:24,882
Alex, just calm down and listen, okay?

861
00:51:27,053 --> 00:51:31,126
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is a whiz kid, but Jesus Christ!

862
00:51:31,493 --> 00:51:33,768
This is my ass we're talking about!

863
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:37,769
Alex, you know how this town works.

864
00:51:40,173 --> 00:51:42,812
You've got enemies here
you haven't heard from.

865
00:51:44,373 --> 00:51:45,726
Now, with this...

866
00:51:46,253 --> 00:51:47,971
...now that you're down...

867
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:49,851
...I'd get ready for one of those...

868
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:52,367
...Class-A, New York-style pigfucks.

869
00:51:53,173 --> 00:51:54,367
You know what's coming.

870
00:51:54,453 --> 00:51:58,082
Now you're going to have to ask yourself,
"who do you trust?"

871
00:51:58,973 --> 00:52:00,201
I don't know.

872
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:02,210
I'm gonna have to look around.

873
00:52:05,773 --> 00:52:07,889
You don't have time to shop, Mr. Cullen.

874
00:52:07,973 --> 00:52:11,522
Jury selection started today
at every breakfast table in the city.

875
00:52:11,693 --> 00:52:13,445
This is what people know:

876
00:52:13,933 --> 00:52:15,412
Three dead bodies.

877
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,491
You discover the crime.

878
00:52:17,573 --> 00:52:21,452
You call it in. You've got blood
on your person and clothes.

879
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:24,292
And Mr. Cullen...

880
00:52:25,773 --> 00:52:27,445
Your prints are on the murder weapon.

881
00:52:27,533 --> 00:52:29,046
How do you know that?

882
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:32,081
There's a second print in blood.

883
00:52:32,213 --> 00:52:35,649
It's a partial of a hand on the wall
next to the bodies.

884
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:39,692
I have keys. I called the cops from
the house! I touched the goddamn wall!

885
00:52:39,773 --> 00:52:41,172
I panicked! I was panicked!

886
00:52:41,253 --> 00:52:43,323
We need 12 people
who can see past all that.

887
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:46,405
- I touched the goddamn wall!
- I'd get in front of this fast.

888
00:52:46,493 --> 00:52:48,688
I panicked! Is that a crime?

889
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,285
I didn't kill anybody.

890
00:52:53,013 --> 00:52:54,446
This is a nightmare.

891
00:52:55,053 --> 00:52:57,931
How am I going to convince anybody?
I'm innocent.

892
00:52:59,653 --> 00:53:01,132
He's right, Alex.

893
00:53:01,453 --> 00:53:03,444
People need to hear these things.

894
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:05,012
Christ, Eddie.

895
00:53:05,693 --> 00:53:08,253
You're not happy tomorrow?
The next day?

896
00:53:08,973 --> 00:53:10,372
We'll move over.

897
00:53:10,573 --> 00:53:12,689
But right now, this moment...

898
00:53:12,893 --> 00:53:15,453
...you need immediate representation.

899
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:17,444
I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter...

900
00:53:17,533 --> 00:53:20,093
...who I care more about
than anything in this world.

901
00:53:20,173 --> 00:53:22,767
They wouldn't let me talk to her
from downtown.

902
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:25,163
They won't let me talk to her
now that I'm out!

903
00:53:25,253 --> 00:53:27,813
We need to issue a statement.

904
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:31,326
He's a winner, Alex.

905
00:53:31,653 --> 00:53:33,291
Just like you were.

906
00:53:33,453 --> 00:53:35,603
And they'll never see him coming.

907
00:53:37,733 --> 00:53:39,564
Jesus Christ.

908
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:45,570
I've got some tough phone calls
I've got to...

909
00:53:53,013 --> 00:53:54,492
My place, tomorrow.

910
00:53:54,813 --> 00:53:55,802
Alone.

911
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:03,568
You better be every fucking inch
as good as he says you are.

912
00:54:12,693 --> 00:54:14,649
Not if they were giving it away.

913
00:54:14,973 --> 00:54:17,441
Come on, Mary Ann.
Let's check out Yoshi's.

914
00:54:18,773 --> 00:54:19,808
- Andrea?
- Yes?

915
00:54:19,893 --> 00:54:21,292
Another one of these, please.

916
00:54:21,373 --> 00:54:22,522
Right away.

917
00:54:22,773 --> 00:54:24,843
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes...

918
00:54:25,573 --> 00:54:28,212
I want you loose and pliable this afternoon.

919
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:33,203
Oh, Lord, this is $3,000.

920
00:54:34,293 --> 00:54:35,851
You know what you should do?

921
00:54:35,933 --> 00:54:37,412
You should buy it...

922
00:54:37,853 --> 00:54:40,526
...wear it once, and then throw it away.

923
00:54:40,893 --> 00:54:42,531
That will loosen you up.

924
00:54:44,373 --> 00:54:45,772
I say spend it all.

925
00:54:46,173 --> 00:54:50,291
If you never see your husband,
have a relationship with his money.

926
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:51,647
I swear...

927
00:54:51,813 --> 00:54:55,965
...if Eddie wasn't afraid of me
shouting my mouth off...

928
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:58,772
...he would've put a cellulite clause
in the pre-nup.

929
00:54:58,853 --> 00:55:00,889
Dr. Robert, I'm telling you...

930
00:55:01,053 --> 00:55:03,647
...he's a miracle man.
You've seen my new tits.

931
00:55:03,813 --> 00:55:05,565
Who does it better than that?

932
00:55:05,653 --> 00:55:07,803
It's not my tits I'm worried about.

933
00:55:10,213 --> 00:55:11,646
Not too big...

934
00:55:12,653 --> 00:55:13,881
Perfect.

935
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:16,208
Real or not?

936
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:19,921
They look real.

937
00:55:20,773 --> 00:55:22,286
They must be real.

938
00:55:24,013 --> 00:55:25,207
Feel them.

939
00:55:25,293 --> 00:55:26,612
No, it's okay, really.

940
00:55:26,693 --> 00:55:29,526
Go ahead. That's the ultimate test.
Come on.

941
00:55:32,853 --> 00:55:33,888
Feel real?

942
00:55:34,173 --> 00:55:35,652
Yes, absolutely real.

943
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:38,046
Dr. Robert.

944
00:55:41,413 --> 00:55:42,766
When you're ready.

945
00:56:05,213 --> 00:56:07,488
So, what do you think?

946
00:56:10,293 --> 00:56:14,002
I don't care if they can hear me.
I don't care!

947
00:56:15,093 --> 00:56:17,243
I don't like it here, Kevin.

948
00:56:17,413 --> 00:56:20,644
And these women! My God, I mean,
I'm seeing things for Christ's sake!

949
00:56:20,733 --> 00:56:22,928
- You just left them in the store?
- Yes!

950
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,412
- Calm down!
- No!

951
00:56:24,573 --> 00:56:25,722
Listen to me!

952
00:56:27,773 --> 00:56:28,922
First...

953
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,962
You do this radical thing to your hair.

954
00:56:33,373 --> 00:56:34,408
You hate it.

955
00:56:34,493 --> 00:56:35,926
Stop. It's fine.

956
00:56:36,053 --> 00:56:39,762
I think it's fine.
But I also think it's traumatic.

957
00:56:41,373 --> 00:56:44,445
You've got the pressure of fitting in
with new friends.

958
00:56:44,733 --> 00:56:46,291
A new place.

959
00:56:46,853 --> 00:56:49,287
Add to that a couple bottles of wine.

960
00:56:49,653 --> 00:56:52,292
No. It wasn't the wine, Kevin.

961
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:55,923
It wasn't the wine, or my hair,
or talking to Kathy...

962
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:57,366
...or anything like that!

963
00:56:57,453 --> 00:56:59,967
Because I know
that's what you're gonna say.

964
00:57:00,213 --> 00:57:01,612
What about Kathy?

965
00:57:01,773 --> 00:57:03,411
What about your sister?

966
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,928
What about her? She's pregnant again.

967
00:57:06,853 --> 00:57:08,923
That's got nothing to do with this?

968
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,521
Kevin, I never see you anymore.

969
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:19,247
And now that you've got this big case,
it's just only gonna get worse.

970
00:57:19,893 --> 00:57:21,008
If you can believe it...

971
00:57:21,093 --> 00:57:24,847
...I'm actually looking forward
to having your mother come and visit.

972
00:57:24,933 --> 00:57:26,332
What about the apartment?

973
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:27,926
Goddamn you!

974
00:57:28,013 --> 00:57:30,083
Why do you always
have to change things around?

975
00:57:30,173 --> 00:57:33,722
This is not about the apartment!
I hate this stupid place!

976
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:36,722
You know...

977
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:39,722
...you buy a couple new suits
and you're fine.

978
00:57:39,813 --> 00:57:41,292
It's a little more than that.

979
00:57:41,373 --> 00:57:43,603
I have this whole fucking place to fill!

980
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:47,572
I know we have all this money
and it's supposed to be fun, but it's not!

981
00:57:47,853 --> 00:57:51,812
It's like a test.
The whole thing is like one big test.

982
00:57:52,053 --> 00:57:53,884
And God...!

983
00:58:02,453 --> 00:58:04,603
I am so Ionely!

984
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:08,009
I miss you so much.

985
00:58:08,773 --> 00:58:10,206
I'm sorry, baby.

986
00:58:10,853 --> 00:58:13,242
I don't know what to do.

987
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:17,132
Let's make a baby.

988
00:58:21,813 --> 00:58:23,132
Don't tease me.

989
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:24,692
I wouldn't do that.

990
00:58:25,493 --> 00:58:26,972
Not unless you asked.

991
00:58:31,813 --> 00:58:33,485
Oh, baby.

992
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,165
Do you have this view?

993
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:31,532
Make love to me.

994
01:00:14,013 --> 01:00:15,412
What are you doing?

995
01:00:44,133 --> 01:00:45,282
Stop.

996
01:00:46,813 --> 01:00:47,768
Oh, God.

997
01:00:49,093 --> 01:00:49,889
God!

998
01:00:49,973 --> 01:00:51,292
Where are you?

999
01:00:52,133 --> 01:00:53,361
I'm right here.

1000
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:56,686
No, you're not.

1001
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:07,326
- Why do we have to keep going?
- Because it needs to be clear.

1002
01:01:07,493 --> 01:01:11,168
Because I need to know
and understand exactly...

1003
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,686
...what happened.

1004
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:16,131
You're standing there, you look down...

1005
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,206
...there's the gun.

1006
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:21,084
I don't know why I picked it up.

1007
01:01:21,253 --> 01:01:23,972
It was before I saw Elucinda's body.

1008
01:01:24,853 --> 01:01:26,764
You kneeled down to pick it up?

1009
01:01:28,213 --> 01:01:31,489
You work late, you come home,
you walk in, everybody's dead!

1010
01:01:31,573 --> 01:01:33,086
It's not something you plan for!

1011
01:01:33,173 --> 01:01:35,084
Stop. Back up.

1012
01:01:36,933 --> 01:01:38,446
Two prints by the gun.

1013
01:01:39,973 --> 01:01:41,122
"Right hand."

1014
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:43,332
"Right knee."

1015
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:45,887
Right knee.

1016
01:01:46,453 --> 01:01:47,806
We've been over this.

1017
01:01:47,893 --> 01:01:49,565
I'm trying to picture it.

1018
01:01:49,733 --> 01:01:50,768
Your hand...

1019
01:01:50,853 --> 01:01:52,684
...your hand came from...

1020
01:01:53,933 --> 01:01:56,652
...inside and underneath?

1021
01:01:58,693 --> 01:02:01,969
Do you want to see it? Here.
I'll fucking show you.

1022
01:02:11,413 --> 01:02:13,881
See? Did you see it? Was it clear?

1023
01:02:14,293 --> 01:02:15,408
You got it?

1024
01:02:15,533 --> 01:02:16,886
Whose gun is that?

1025
01:02:17,173 --> 01:02:19,562
- It's mine!
- Are you out of your mind?

1026
01:02:19,813 --> 01:02:23,010
You're charged with a triple homicide,
you're walking around with a gun!

1027
01:02:23,093 --> 01:02:25,323
I have had nine death threats!

1028
01:02:25,413 --> 01:02:27,404
Give it over. Give me the gun.

1029
01:02:28,133 --> 01:02:29,486
I gotta protect myself.

1030
01:02:29,573 --> 01:02:33,646
That's my job. When the case is over,
you can have it back.

1031
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:38,569
This is a deal breaker, Alex.

1032
01:02:51,493 --> 01:02:52,608
Let's wrap it up.

1033
01:02:52,693 --> 01:02:54,012
So, what's next?

1034
01:02:54,773 --> 01:02:57,492
We need to talk to your assistant,
Mrs. Black.

1035
01:02:57,653 --> 01:02:58,642
Call her.

1036
01:02:58,973 --> 01:03:01,612
You feel confident she'll back you
on the time?

1037
01:03:03,133 --> 01:03:05,044
Melissa, yeah, yeah.

1038
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:07,727
She's okay. She's a straight arrow.

1039
01:03:09,973 --> 01:03:12,043
We're going to talk to her...

1040
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:16,125
...and you're not going
to talk to anybody, all right?

1041
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:18,368
All right?

1042
01:03:21,653 --> 01:03:22,802
No comment.

1043
01:03:26,013 --> 01:03:27,241
There they are!

1044
01:03:29,453 --> 01:03:31,284
Kevin, how about a couple shots?

1045
01:03:31,373 --> 01:03:34,171
How does it feel to get
the biggest murder trial in New York?

1046
01:03:34,253 --> 01:03:37,643
Look over here! Are you really
going to plead Cullen not guilty?

1047
01:03:37,733 --> 01:03:39,086
What is happening?

1048
01:03:39,173 --> 01:03:42,085
Since the case,
Kevin's picture's been in the paper.

1049
01:03:42,533 --> 01:03:45,366
He always did like to stick his nose
in the camera.

1050
01:03:46,453 --> 01:03:48,364
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.

1051
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,330
Did you have a nice dinner?

1052
01:03:50,453 --> 01:03:52,648
Oh, I surely did. Are you hungry?

1053
01:03:52,733 --> 01:03:54,405
Oh, no, ma'am. Thank you.

1054
01:03:55,293 --> 01:03:56,806
Welcome to Babylon, Ma.

1055
01:03:56,893 --> 01:03:58,326
Speak of the devil.

1056
01:04:00,373 --> 01:04:02,967
I was just telling them the Moyez story.

1057
01:04:03,613 --> 01:04:04,762
Really?

1058
01:04:05,853 --> 01:04:07,002
This is your mother.

1059
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,606
Yes, Mom, this is...

1060
01:04:08,773 --> 01:04:09,922
John Milton.

1061
01:04:11,413 --> 01:04:12,641
Alice Lomax.

1062
01:04:13,053 --> 01:04:15,169
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1063
01:04:16,013 --> 01:04:17,366
How do you do?

1064
01:04:19,973 --> 01:04:21,929
- You're looking lovely.
- Thanks.

1065
01:04:24,853 --> 01:04:26,571
I believe you met Christabella.

1066
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:28,086
Yes, I think we did.

1067
01:04:28,213 --> 01:04:29,692
And Gizelle.

1068
01:04:29,853 --> 01:04:31,764
Fresh in from Paris.

1069
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:33,650
Great.

1070
01:04:34,493 --> 01:04:35,812
Nice to meet you.

1071
01:04:38,013 --> 01:04:39,446
Three for you...

1072
01:04:39,613 --> 01:04:40,966
...and my place.

1073
01:04:41,053 --> 01:04:42,247
Thanks for the champagne.

1074
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:44,403
You're very welcome, Kevin.

1075
01:04:45,973 --> 01:04:49,966
This isn't really your first visit
to New York, now, is it, Mrs. Lomax?

1076
01:04:53,373 --> 01:04:54,203
Yes.

1077
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:04,962
You've done one hell of a job
bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.

1078
01:05:05,853 --> 01:05:06,888
I'm sure...

1079
01:05:06,973 --> 01:05:08,565
...it wasn't easy.

1080
01:05:11,093 --> 01:05:12,242
No.

1081
01:05:15,253 --> 01:05:16,766
Mom, we're here.

1082
01:05:17,173 --> 01:05:18,526
Good night to you.

1083
01:05:19,573 --> 01:05:21,643
Good night, Mary Ann.

1084
01:05:22,133 --> 01:05:23,612
Kevin, hang on.

1085
01:05:25,453 --> 01:05:27,250
How about Cullen? How's it going?

1086
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:28,732
Everything on beam?

1087
01:05:28,973 --> 01:05:30,770
That's a long conversation.

1088
01:05:31,493 --> 01:05:33,290
Want to come up and tell me?

1089
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:34,648
Now?

1090
01:05:42,133 --> 01:05:43,566
Let's talk tomorrow.

1091
01:05:46,293 --> 01:05:47,328
You sure?

1092
01:05:56,813 --> 01:05:59,691
Is that what you're doing
when you're working late?

1093
01:05:59,933 --> 01:06:01,252
What're you talking about?

1094
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,528
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

1095
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:05,604
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, right.

1096
01:06:05,853 --> 01:06:07,047
I'm going to bed.

1097
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:08,964
- Good night, Alice.
- 'Night.

1098
01:06:22,013 --> 01:06:23,765
Oh, shit!

1099
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,086
Mom, what are you doing?

1100
01:06:29,173 --> 01:06:30,606
I'm going home.

1101
01:06:30,773 --> 01:06:32,445
What are you talking about?

1102
01:06:32,533 --> 01:06:34,603
I don't feel right.

1103
01:06:34,773 --> 01:06:37,003
Look, you just got here.

1104
01:06:37,813 --> 01:06:41,488
And I just got my teeth kicked in
on the front page, so I gotta run.

1105
01:06:42,453 --> 01:06:44,125
We'll talk later, okay?

1106
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:51,004
I have to go, Kevin.

1107
01:06:51,573 --> 01:06:52,926
I miss my church.

1108
01:06:53,173 --> 01:06:57,212
This is New York. There must be
20,000 churches. Take your pick.

1109
01:06:58,293 --> 01:07:00,409
You need to do a better job with Mary Ann.

1110
01:07:00,493 --> 01:07:02,051
She is not well.

1111
01:07:02,133 --> 01:07:04,852
- This place is not good for her.
- So stay.

1112
01:07:05,013 --> 01:07:07,163
Take care of her, if you're so concerned.

1113
01:07:07,253 --> 01:07:08,572
Help me out.

1114
01:07:09,013 --> 01:07:11,049
I'll take her home if you let me.

1115
01:07:11,493 --> 01:07:13,643
This is home. Understand?

1116
01:07:13,813 --> 01:07:15,087
This is where we live.

1117
01:07:15,173 --> 01:07:17,243
I'm not going back to Gainesville.

1118
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:18,925
Unbelievable.

1119
01:07:19,813 --> 01:07:20,962
"Wide is the gate...

1120
01:07:21,053 --> 01:07:23,965
"...and broad is the way
that leadeth to temptation."

1121
01:07:24,293 --> 01:07:25,806
It's a little early for Scripture.

1122
01:07:25,893 --> 01:07:28,612
I'm going to work.
You can do whatever you want.

1123
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,244
Does my babysitter have to testify?

1124
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:56,370
We need her to establish
the time you returned home.

1125
01:07:56,853 --> 01:07:59,413
She doesn't have a green card,
is why I ask.

1126
01:07:59,893 --> 01:08:02,009
I would hate for her to get in trouble.

1127
01:08:02,093 --> 01:08:03,128
Tell you what, Melissa...

1128
01:08:03,213 --> 01:08:06,603
Let's talk to her first. See where
she stands and take it from there.

1129
01:08:06,693 --> 01:08:09,253
I'll make sure Melissa gets down to the car.

1130
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:11,563
Mr. Cullen didn't kill those people.

1131
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:14,691
I know him. He's a difficult man,
but he couldn't kill anyone.

1132
01:08:14,773 --> 01:08:16,968
That's why we're all working so hard.

1133
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:18,928
Thank you.

1134
01:08:20,373 --> 01:08:22,841
Can I have the car stop
at my ex-husband's?

1135
01:08:23,253 --> 01:08:25,403
- My son left his jacket there.
- Sure.

1136
01:08:29,493 --> 01:08:34,044
Remember, no shredding in the building
trash, only in the private refuse.

1137
01:08:34,213 --> 01:08:37,171
Excelsior Securities, who's handling that?

1138
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:39,403
- I am.
- All this has got to go.

1139
01:08:39,733 --> 01:08:41,803
Guatemala, Sudan, Cyprus...

1140
01:08:43,813 --> 01:08:47,249
Vagada Holdings, it'll take you all night.
Just Vagada Holdings.

1141
01:08:49,173 --> 01:08:51,641
I thought I was the only one working late.

1142
01:08:54,693 --> 01:08:55,728
So did we.

1143
01:08:56,693 --> 01:08:59,332
Back to work. This is not a break.

1144
01:08:59,533 --> 01:09:00,522
Good news.

1145
01:09:00,613 --> 01:09:03,571
We just wrapped up with
Cullen's assistant. Looks like a great alibi.

1146
01:09:03,653 --> 01:09:05,291
What a pleasant surprise.

1147
01:09:08,213 --> 01:09:10,044
Looks like you've got your hands full.

1148
01:09:10,133 --> 01:09:12,203
It's just a little...

1149
01:09:12,413 --> 01:09:13,732
...housekeeping.

1150
01:09:14,453 --> 01:09:16,125
If anyone should ask...

1151
01:09:17,093 --> 01:09:18,606
...you never saw this.

1152
01:09:19,013 --> 01:09:20,207
Who would ask?

1153
01:09:21,373 --> 01:09:22,362
Weaver.

1154
01:09:22,493 --> 01:09:23,608
Who's that?

1155
01:09:24,773 --> 01:09:27,082
Justice Department. Weaver Commission.

1156
01:09:29,493 --> 01:09:30,687
You don't know about him?

1157
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:31,808
Sorry.

1158
01:09:33,493 --> 01:09:34,528
How nice for you.

1159
01:09:34,613 --> 01:09:39,209
Grab your coat. The night is young.
We're going to the Garden. Ringside.

1160
01:09:39,413 --> 01:09:40,528
Title fight.

1161
01:09:40,613 --> 01:09:42,126
Roy Jones, Jr.

1162
01:09:42,213 --> 01:09:43,931
I have to call Mary Ann.

1163
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,332
Do it on the way.

1164
01:09:47,293 --> 01:09:48,521
Get my message?

1165
01:09:48,773 --> 01:09:51,082
I did. You write beautifully.

1166
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,843
What's this Weaver Commission?

1167
01:09:57,173 --> 01:09:59,050
I don't like to micro-manage.

1168
01:09:59,213 --> 01:10:01,169
Find the talent, then delegate.

1169
01:10:01,733 --> 01:10:04,008
Who the hell knows what Eddie's up to?

1170
01:10:04,453 --> 01:10:07,092
He's got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.

1171
01:10:07,973 --> 01:10:09,167
Excuse me.

1172
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,403
What the fuck are you looking at?

1173
01:10:12,373 --> 01:10:14,284
You. You deaf or something?
You don't hear me?

1174
01:10:14,373 --> 01:10:15,965
I hear you fine.

1175
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:17,805
So get the fuck out of my car.

1176
01:10:17,893 --> 01:10:21,932
Why? I didn't know it was your car.
I'm having a good time here.

1177
01:10:22,013 --> 01:10:23,605
I'm telling you, motherfucker...

1178
01:10:23,693 --> 01:10:24,842
...get the fuck out of my car...

1179
01:10:24,933 --> 01:10:25,763
Shit.

1180
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:28,248
Get out before I cut your throat.

1181
01:10:28,413 --> 01:10:29,448
Fuck that.

1182
01:10:53,693 --> 01:10:55,012
How do you know?

1183
01:10:59,933 --> 01:11:01,082
Enjoy yourself.

1184
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,652
You still got time.

1185
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:06,091
There's a train coming the other way.
You'll just catch it.

1186
01:11:06,173 --> 01:11:08,084
You'll thank me in the morning.

1187
01:11:08,213 --> 01:11:09,441
If you ain't right...

1188
01:11:09,533 --> 01:11:10,648
I'm right.

1189
01:11:10,813 --> 01:11:11,882
You'll see.

1190
01:11:13,493 --> 01:11:14,812
Invigorating.

1191
01:11:15,733 --> 01:11:17,371
What did you say to him?

1192
01:11:18,453 --> 01:11:22,287
I told him if he didn't leave us alone,
you'd kick his ass.

1193
01:11:22,453 --> 01:11:25,490
Look, there's a lady getting up
from her seat. Come on.

1194
01:11:26,933 --> 01:11:29,652
Give it to him! You want this round?
You are on!

1195
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:33,331
Roy's gonna get him. Now, now, now!

1196
01:11:43,253 --> 01:11:44,402
Fixed!

1197
01:11:50,133 --> 01:11:52,522
- What a beauty!
- I'm glad you could come!

1198
01:11:53,213 --> 01:11:56,649
I want you to meet my new heavyweight,
here: Kevin Lomax.

1199
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,132
How are you?

1200
01:11:58,293 --> 01:11:59,282
I'm well.

1201
01:12:17,653 --> 01:12:19,086
And say what?

1202
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:21,209
He's the senior partner at the...

1203
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:25,848
You're really starting to piss me off.

1204
01:12:34,773 --> 01:12:36,684
Yes, I'm having one cigarette.

1205
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,209
You want me to lie?
One cigarette after seven months is not...

1206
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:42,329
That's exactly what I'm saying!

1207
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:45,811
Go to bed. I have no idea.

1208
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:58,762
Stop. This guy pays our bills.

1209
01:12:58,933 --> 01:13:02,562
The food, the heat, the rent
on that enormous apartment we live in.

1210
01:13:03,733 --> 01:13:05,212
I live there, too.

1211
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:11,565
Give it back to me!

1212
01:13:17,853 --> 01:13:19,047
Babs Coleman.

1213
01:13:19,413 --> 01:13:20,892
Kevin Lomax.

1214
01:13:20,973 --> 01:13:23,851
Babs is from Georgia Tech.
It's your neck of the woods.

1215
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:24,922
There's Tiffany.

1216
01:13:25,013 --> 01:13:27,481
New additions. Where are you from?

1217
01:13:27,613 --> 01:13:29,205
Don't tell me!

1218
01:13:30,133 --> 01:13:31,282
Michigan!

1219
01:13:31,773 --> 01:13:34,492
How'd you know? Oh, my goodness.

1220
01:13:34,653 --> 01:13:36,052
How did he know?

1221
01:13:36,213 --> 01:13:37,692
That is so good.

1222
01:13:52,213 --> 01:13:53,487
Cheers.

1223
01:14:43,975 --> 01:14:45,249
Hello?

1224
01:14:46,295 --> 01:14:47,614
Who is there?

1225
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:49,967
I got a knife.

1226
01:15:11,895 --> 01:15:13,408
Oh, Jesus.

1227
01:15:20,055 --> 01:15:21,408
Baby...

1228
01:15:21,895 --> 01:15:23,772
...how'd you get here?

1229
01:15:25,415 --> 01:15:27,087
Are you okay?

1230
01:15:29,335 --> 01:15:30,609
Oh, God.

1231
01:15:33,735 --> 01:15:35,407
Where's your mommy?

1232
01:15:36,695 --> 01:15:39,812
You ain't got no mommy?
What do you got there?

1233
01:15:40,055 --> 01:15:42,205
What are you playing with?

1234
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:45,286
What are you playing with?

1235
01:15:51,335 --> 01:15:52,927
Oh, God!

1236
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:03,567
Baby, please.

1237
01:16:03,855 --> 01:16:05,891
Baby, there is no blood.

1238
01:16:06,615 --> 01:16:08,685
There is no blood. It was a dream.

1239
01:16:08,775 --> 01:16:10,128
It was a dream.

1240
01:16:11,415 --> 01:16:13,724
It's not a dream if it's true.

1241
01:16:15,255 --> 01:16:19,533
Look, let's get you undressed
and in the tub, okay?

1242
01:16:19,735 --> 01:16:20,770
No!

1243
01:16:21,175 --> 01:16:22,688
I know you.

1244
01:16:24,295 --> 01:16:26,365
You'll leave me now for sure.

1245
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:29,245
No! Get away from me!

1246
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:34,693
I'm confused.

1247
01:16:35,015 --> 01:16:36,130
Why?

1248
01:16:37,015 --> 01:16:38,368
What is it now?

1249
01:16:40,535 --> 01:16:42,173
Did you like the green?

1250
01:16:42,695 --> 01:16:44,287
You did, didn't you?

1251
01:16:44,455 --> 01:16:45,808
We should go back to the green.

1252
01:16:45,895 --> 01:16:48,614
I'm calling the doctor.
I'm going to get you some help.

1253
01:16:48,695 --> 01:16:50,526
They took my ovaries, Kevin.

1254
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:55,885
They took my ovaries!

1255
01:16:56,055 --> 01:16:58,046
I told you! Right here!

1256
01:16:58,455 --> 01:17:01,492
Mary Ann, it was a nightmare.
It didn't happen.

1257
01:17:05,175 --> 01:17:08,292
My sisters have
seven children between them.

1258
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:14,008
My mother had Derek when she was 45.

1259
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:16,729
You could've set a clock by my periods.

1260
01:17:16,895 --> 01:17:17,884
Baby...

1261
01:17:18,215 --> 01:17:20,649
...what are you talking about?

1262
01:17:22,215 --> 01:17:24,570
Kevin, I can't have children.

1263
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:25,970
What?

1264
01:17:26,615 --> 01:17:27,764
Says who?

1265
01:17:31,015 --> 01:17:32,528
The doctor.

1266
01:17:33,175 --> 01:17:35,166
I was there yesterday.

1267
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:39,367
"Non-specific ovarian failure."

1268
01:17:41,335 --> 01:17:42,688
That's ridiculous.

1269
01:17:45,815 --> 01:17:46,850
Oh, God.

1270
01:17:48,535 --> 01:17:50,173
Did you just hear that?

1271
01:17:51,175 --> 01:17:52,210
Listen.

1272
01:17:54,135 --> 01:17:55,488
Can you hear that?

1273
01:17:58,455 --> 01:17:59,410
No.

1274
01:18:03,255 --> 01:18:05,564
You're going to leave me, aren't you?

1275
01:18:09,255 --> 01:18:10,847
I know you.

1276
01:18:11,975 --> 01:18:13,010
God...

1277
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:17,247
No, Kevin.

1278
01:18:17,655 --> 01:18:19,088
It's these monsters.

1279
01:18:20,135 --> 01:18:22,365
I dreamt about this.

1280
01:18:23,575 --> 01:18:25,008
Baby, I gotta take this.

1281
01:18:25,095 --> 01:18:27,484
No, you've gotta listen to me.

1282
01:18:29,335 --> 01:18:30,688
I gotta take this.

1283
01:18:32,615 --> 01:18:34,128
It's going to be okay.

1284
01:18:41,095 --> 01:18:42,050
Fuck!

1285
01:18:42,215 --> 01:18:44,524
I knew the D.A. Was holding out on us.

1286
01:18:44,695 --> 01:18:47,334
Get the discovery package
over here, right now.

1287
01:18:48,135 --> 01:18:50,205
I don't care. Find Cullen.

1288
01:18:58,935 --> 01:19:01,893
I get one supervised hour a week
with my stepdaughter.

1289
01:19:02,055 --> 01:19:05,252
I am in there with two shrinks
and three social workers.

1290
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:08,134
You better have a good reason
for calling me out.

1291
01:19:08,215 --> 01:19:11,252
Your wife, the day she was killed,
had lunch with a friend.

1292
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:14,486
She says, and I quote:
"Alex is fucking around and I can prove it."

1293
01:19:14,575 --> 01:19:16,452
That's hearsay. That never gets in.

1294
01:19:16,535 --> 01:19:17,729
Wrong answer.

1295
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:20,131
Your prenuptial agreement's
on file at the firm.

1296
01:19:20,215 --> 01:19:22,775
The contract is void
in the event of marital infidelity.

1297
01:19:22,855 --> 01:19:25,085
You fuck around, she gets rich.

1298
01:19:25,255 --> 01:19:27,564
That's a motive, Alex.

1299
01:19:28,535 --> 01:19:30,127
What do I need to know?

1300
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:40,286
Melissa, my assistant.

1301
01:19:41,255 --> 01:19:43,325
She wasn't even that good a fuck.

1302
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:44,610
And...

1303
01:19:45,255 --> 01:19:47,086
...on the night in question?

1304
01:19:54,295 --> 01:19:57,810
I was boning my assistant
the night my wife got shot.

1305
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:05,165
I've got to re-interview Melissa.

1306
01:20:05,335 --> 01:20:08,372
No, forget it. We're not telling that story.

1307
01:20:08,535 --> 01:20:11,732
Juries want honesty.
Fuck with that at your peril.

1308
01:20:14,335 --> 01:20:15,973
Alessandra, wait!

1309
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:20,533
Not now. Mrs. Skylar, please!

1310
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:22,253
Time's up, Mr. Cullen.

1311
01:20:23,095 --> 01:20:23,845
Alex!

1312
01:20:23,935 --> 01:20:25,163
I can't!

1313
01:20:26,135 --> 01:20:28,695
This isn't fair. I had 15 more minutes.

1314
01:20:29,015 --> 01:20:31,575
You'll just have to wait until next week.

1315
01:20:32,855 --> 01:20:35,449
- I'll see you next week.
- That's it, I'm sorry.

1316
01:20:36,895 --> 01:20:38,487
<i>For sleep.</i>

1317
01:20:38,655 --> 01:20:40,805
<i>And she can take that during the day?</i>

1318
01:20:40,895 --> 01:20:42,647
No, she won't be driving.

1319
01:20:42,975 --> 01:20:45,694
I'll have the pharmacy call you right back.

1320
01:20:45,975 --> 01:20:50,014
He's not sure. He thinks it could
be some kind of hormonal imbalance.

1321
01:20:50,175 --> 01:20:52,006
I'm taking you off the case.

1322
01:20:53,535 --> 01:20:55,207
I want you to drop this case.

1323
01:20:55,295 --> 01:20:56,887
This case? Cullen?

1324
01:20:57,535 --> 01:20:59,969
- I've got a jury showing up.
- Do you love this woman?

1325
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:02,250
- Of course I do.
- Then what are you doing?

1326
01:21:02,335 --> 01:21:03,563
She's sick.

1327
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:06,772
Everyone will understand. I'll understand.

1328
01:21:06,935 --> 01:21:08,334
What about Cullen?

1329
01:21:08,735 --> 01:21:10,327
We find somebody new.

1330
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:12,053
You consult.

1331
01:21:12,255 --> 01:21:14,052
You live to fight another day.

1332
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:17,207
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.

1333
01:21:17,695 --> 01:21:19,651
It's a disappointment. We have them.

1334
01:21:19,735 --> 01:21:24,092
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.

1335
01:21:26,495 --> 01:21:27,564
Hang on.

1336
01:21:27,895 --> 01:21:29,408
We've gotta talk about this.

1337
01:21:29,495 --> 01:21:32,692
Listen to yourself, Kevin.
"We've gotta talk about this."

1338
01:21:32,855 --> 01:21:34,447
It's your wife!

1339
01:21:34,615 --> 01:21:36,571
She's sick, she needs you.

1340
01:21:36,735 --> 01:21:38,612
She's got to come first.

1341
01:21:38,935 --> 01:21:40,448
All right, wait a minute.

1342
01:21:40,535 --> 01:21:44,687
Do you mean the possibility of leaving
this case has never entered your mind?

1343
01:21:49,055 --> 01:21:50,647
You know what scares me?

1344
01:21:51,415 --> 01:21:53,804
I quit the case, she gets better...

1345
01:21:54,655 --> 01:21:56,327
...and I hate her for it.

1346
01:21:57,375 --> 01:21:58,694
I don't want to resent her.

1347
01:21:58,775 --> 01:22:00,174
I've got a winner here.

1348
01:22:00,255 --> 01:22:04,214
I've got to nail this fucker down
and put it behind me. Just get it done.

1349
01:22:04,535 --> 01:22:05,490
Then...

1350
01:22:05,975 --> 01:22:07,044
...then...

1351
01:22:07,415 --> 01:22:09,371
...put all my energy into her.

1352
01:22:15,895 --> 01:22:17,487
I stand corrected.

1353
01:22:18,335 --> 01:22:21,133
Fill me in. Did Cullen's assistant
admit to the affair?

1354
01:22:21,215 --> 01:22:23,251
She did to me, but...

1355
01:22:23,415 --> 01:22:24,928
...she won't in court.

1356
01:22:25,335 --> 01:22:26,654
Convince her otherwise.

1357
01:22:26,735 --> 01:22:29,488
And when all that evidence
is laid before you...

1358
01:22:29,655 --> 01:22:33,648
...when all these pieces weave together,
you will conclude...

1359
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:35,214
...you will know...

1360
01:22:35,295 --> 01:22:37,855
...that Alexander Cullen is guilty...

1361
01:22:38,015 --> 01:22:39,926
...of murdering three people...

1362
01:22:40,215 --> 01:22:41,694
...in cold blood...

1363
01:22:41,975 --> 01:22:44,250
...and with malice aforethought.

1364
01:22:44,855 --> 01:22:45,890
Thank you.

1365
01:22:47,215 --> 01:22:48,284
Your Honor.

1366
01:22:49,615 --> 01:22:52,812
We can break for lunch now
or you can do a stop and start.

1367
01:22:53,215 --> 01:22:55,092
If it's a choice, I'll go now.

1368
01:22:55,415 --> 01:22:57,485
I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.

1369
01:22:57,695 --> 01:22:58,764
Proceed.

1370
01:23:03,775 --> 01:23:05,845
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1371
01:23:05,975 --> 01:23:09,650
...I know you've spent all morning
listening to Mr. Broygo.

1372
01:23:09,815 --> 01:23:11,043
I know you're hungry.

1373
01:23:11,135 --> 01:23:14,127
What I need to tell you
won't take very long at all.

1374
01:23:15,415 --> 01:23:17,975
I don't like Alexander Cullen.

1375
01:23:18,935 --> 01:23:21,005
I don't think he's a nice person.

1376
01:23:21,695 --> 01:23:23,606
I don't expect you to like him.

1377
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:27,412
He's been a terrible husband
to all three of his wives.

1378
01:23:27,575 --> 01:23:30,533
He's been a destructive force
in the lives of his stepchildren.

1379
01:23:30,615 --> 01:23:32,685
He's cheated the city, his partners...

1380
01:23:32,775 --> 01:23:33,890
...his employees.

1381
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:37,524
He's paid hundreds of thousands
of dollars in penalties and fines.

1382
01:23:37,695 --> 01:23:39,287
I don't like him.

1383
01:23:40,575 --> 01:23:44,250
I'm going to tell you some things
during the course of this trial...

1384
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:47,094
...that are going to make you
like him even less.

1385
01:23:48,375 --> 01:23:50,047
But this isn't a popularity contest.

1386
01:23:50,135 --> 01:23:51,614
It's a murder trial.

1387
01:23:52,575 --> 01:23:56,807
And the single most important
provable fact of this proceeding...

1388
01:23:57,615 --> 01:24:01,290
...is that Alexander Cullen
was somewhere else...

1389
01:24:01,535 --> 01:24:02,650
...when these...

1390
01:24:02,735 --> 01:24:05,203
...horrible crimes took place.

1391
01:24:06,815 --> 01:24:08,168
Now, the State...

1392
01:24:08,575 --> 01:24:10,964
The State is going all out here.

1393
01:24:11,215 --> 01:24:12,887
They've got this whole team here...

1394
01:24:12,975 --> 01:24:15,535
...throwing everything
but the kitchen sink at this case.

1395
01:24:15,615 --> 01:24:17,287
I want one thing from you.

1396
01:24:17,615 --> 01:24:18,809
That's it.

1397
01:24:19,215 --> 01:24:20,330
One thing.

1398
01:24:21,615 --> 01:24:23,845
I want you to ask yourself:

1399
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:27,286
"Is not liking this man...

1400
01:24:29,135 --> 01:24:31,126
"...reason enough...

1401
01:24:31,535 --> 01:24:33,446
"...to convict him of murder?"

1402
01:24:36,175 --> 01:24:37,608
Enjoy your lunch.

1403
01:24:37,935 --> 01:24:39,288
We'll talk again.

1404
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:44,412
What the fuck was that about?
They're going to hate me!

1405
01:24:44,775 --> 01:24:47,767
Listen to me like you've never
to anyone before in your life.

1406
01:24:47,855 --> 01:24:50,244
I'm gonna bust my ass
to make sure they hate you.

1407
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:54,408
Because as long as you're boning Melissa,
you're not home killing your wife!

1408
01:24:56,415 --> 01:24:58,565
Why didn't you say something before?

1409
01:24:59,295 --> 01:25:01,365
Then it doesn't look spontaneous.

1410
01:25:03,775 --> 01:25:04,969
You got it now.

1411
01:25:18,415 --> 01:25:19,689
Saw you go in.

1412
01:25:19,775 --> 01:25:20,810
What's up?

1413
01:25:20,895 --> 01:25:22,647
Congratulations.

1414
01:25:22,815 --> 01:25:26,410
- It's not over yet.
- I'm not talking about the trial.

1415
01:25:26,575 --> 01:25:27,769
What are you talking about?

1416
01:25:27,855 --> 01:25:31,211
How the fuck does your name
get on the firm's charter?

1417
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:33,371
What?

1418
01:25:33,455 --> 01:25:35,332
It looks like it's been there for years.

1419
01:25:35,415 --> 01:25:38,088
So, now you're a partner.
When did that happen?

1420
01:25:38,255 --> 01:25:42,089
You know, I still am the managing director
of this firm.

1421
01:25:42,255 --> 01:25:43,927
You want my job, take me head on.

1422
01:25:44,015 --> 01:25:45,334
You backdoor me one more time...

1423
01:25:45,415 --> 01:25:48,691
...and I'll take your partnership papers
and shove them down your throat!

1424
01:25:48,775 --> 01:25:52,051
I don't know what you're talking about.
I sure don't like your tone of voice.

1425
01:25:52,135 --> 01:25:53,170
Bullshit.

1426
01:25:53,255 --> 01:25:54,893
You've got a problem with documents...

1427
01:25:54,975 --> 01:25:58,854
...I suggest you put together
one of your late-night shredding sessions.

1428
01:26:02,815 --> 01:26:05,409
You think you're tough enough
to run this firm?

1429
01:26:06,175 --> 01:26:09,053
Remember the Weaver Commission
investigation?

1430
01:26:09,215 --> 01:26:10,807
Tell your mentor...

1431
01:26:10,975 --> 01:26:14,012
...the next time Weaver calls me,
maybe I'll just...

1432
01:26:14,175 --> 01:26:15,654
...pick up the phone.

1433
01:26:20,215 --> 01:26:22,331
- Was he drunk?
- I doubt it.

1434
01:26:22,495 --> 01:26:23,974
He was going running.

1435
01:26:24,415 --> 01:26:26,485
What the hell was he talking about?

1436
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:29,924
Eddie's got himself in trouble again.

1437
01:26:30,735 --> 01:26:34,125
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can't.

1438
01:26:35,935 --> 01:26:38,051
Why does he think I'm after his job?

1439
01:26:38,495 --> 01:26:41,214
You ever have any experience
with manic depression?

1440
01:26:41,295 --> 01:26:42,410
Not directly, no.

1441
01:26:42,495 --> 01:26:43,610
You do now.

1442
01:26:43,695 --> 01:26:44,525
<i>346.</i>

1443
01:26:44,615 --> 01:26:46,446
It's me. Get Eddie Barzoon.

1444
01:26:46,575 --> 01:26:49,328
He may be out running,
so you might have to page him.

1445
01:26:49,415 --> 01:26:51,292
- It's an emergency.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1446
01:26:51,535 --> 01:26:53,651
You look like you could use a drink.

1447
01:26:54,655 --> 01:26:55,770
Yes, thanks.

1448
01:26:56,415 --> 01:26:58,804
<i>Eddie Barzoon, Eddie Barzoon.</i>

1449
01:27:00,335 --> 01:27:04,374
<i>I nursed him through two divorces,</i>
<i>a cocaine rehab...</i>

1450
01:27:04,735 --> 01:27:06,646
...and a pregnant receptionist.

1451
01:27:07,935 --> 01:27:09,448
God's creature, right?

1452
01:27:09,855 --> 01:27:11,925
<i>God's special creature?</i>

1453
01:27:13,215 --> 01:27:14,853
<i>I've warned him, Kevin.</i>

1454
01:27:14,935 --> 01:27:17,210
<i>I've warned him every step of the way.</i>

1455
01:27:17,335 --> 01:27:19,849
<i>Watching him bounce around</i>
<i>like a fucking game.</i>

1456
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:21,368
<i>Like a wind-up toy.</i>

1457
01:27:21,455 --> 01:27:22,888
<i>Like 250 pounds...</i>

1458
01:27:23,055 --> 01:27:25,808
<i>... of self-serving greed on wheels.</i>

1459
01:27:25,975 --> 01:27:28,728
<i>The next thousand years</i>
<i>is right around the corner.</i>

1460
01:27:28,815 --> 01:27:30,168
<i>Eddie Barzoon...</i>

1461
01:27:30,255 --> 01:27:32,246
<i>... take a good look because...</i>

1462
01:27:32,335 --> 01:27:35,088
<i>... he's the poster child</i>
<i>for the next millennium.</i>

1463
01:27:36,855 --> 01:27:37,890
<i>These people...</i>

1464
01:27:37,975 --> 01:27:40,409
<i>... it's no mystery where they come from.</i>

1465
01:27:43,855 --> 01:27:46,005
You sharpen the human appetite...

1466
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:49,690
...to the point where it can split atoms
with its desire.

1467
01:27:49,935 --> 01:27:52,495
You build egos the size of cathedrals.

1468
01:27:52,655 --> 01:27:56,250
Fiber-optically connect the world
to every eager impulse.

1469
01:27:56,655 --> 01:27:59,647
Grease even the dullest dreams with
these dollar-green...

1470
01:27:59,735 --> 01:28:04,251
...gold-plated fantasies until every human
becomes an aspiring emperor...

1471
01:28:04,335 --> 01:28:07,452
<i>... becomes his own god.</i>
<i>Where can you go from there?</i>

1472
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,128
Wrong way!

1473
01:28:09,895 --> 01:28:10,964
Fuck you...

1474
01:28:11,375 --> 01:28:12,649
<i>As we're scrambling...</i>

1475
01:28:12,735 --> 01:28:14,407
...from one deal to the next...

1476
01:28:14,495 --> 01:28:16,087
...who's got his eye on the planet?

1477
01:28:16,175 --> 01:28:18,245
<i>As the air thickens, the water sours...</i>

1478
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:21,611
<i>... even bees' honey takes on</i>
<i>the metallic taste of radioactivity...</i>

1479
01:28:21,695 --> 01:28:24,812
<i>... and it just keeps coming,</i>
<i>faster and faster.</i>

1480
01:28:26,015 --> 01:28:27,243
Help! Stop it!

1481
01:28:27,455 --> 01:28:29,844
<i>There's no chance to think, to prepare.</i>

1482
01:28:30,015 --> 01:28:32,404
<i>It's buy futures, sell futures...</i>

1483
01:28:32,575 --> 01:28:34,406
<i>... when there is no future.</i>

1484
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:36,566
<i>We got a runaway train, boy.</i>

1485
01:28:36,695 --> 01:28:40,404
<i>We got a billion Eddie Barzoons</i>
<i>all jogging into the future.</i>

1486
01:28:40,575 --> 01:28:44,170
Every one of them is getting ready
to fistfuck God's ex-planet...

1487
01:28:44,335 --> 01:28:45,893
<i>... lick their fingers clean...</i>

1488
01:28:45,975 --> 01:28:48,091
<i>... as they reach out toward their pristine...</i>

1489
01:28:48,175 --> 01:28:49,654
<i>... cybernetic keyboards...</i>

1490
01:28:49,735 --> 01:28:52,249
...to tote up their fucking billable hours.

1491
01:28:52,415 --> 01:28:54,531
<i>And then it hits home.</i>

1492
01:28:54,695 --> 01:28:56,811
<i>You got to pay your own way, Eddie.</i>

1493
01:28:57,135 --> 01:28:59,729
<i>It's a little late in the game to buy out now.</i>

1494
01:28:59,815 --> 01:29:01,168
Give me your watch.

1495
01:29:01,255 --> 01:29:04,645
I like this watch!
Do you think you're just going to take it?

1496
01:29:05,615 --> 01:29:07,253
<i>Your belly's too full...</i>

1497
01:29:07,615 --> 01:29:09,207
<i>... your dick is sore...</i>

1498
01:29:09,295 --> 01:29:12,890
<i>... your eyes are bloodshot and</i>
<i>you're screaming for someone to help.</i>

1499
01:29:12,975 --> 01:29:14,203
<i>But guess what?</i>

1500
01:29:14,895 --> 01:29:16,613
<i>There's no one there!</i>

1501
01:29:17,055 --> 01:29:18,966
<i>You're all alone, Eddie.</i>

1502
01:29:19,095 --> 01:29:21,814
<i>You're God's special little creature.</i>

1503
01:29:28,335 --> 01:29:29,484
Maybe it's true.

1504
01:29:29,575 --> 01:29:32,487
Maybe God threw the dice once too often.

1505
01:29:33,495 --> 01:29:35,247
Maybe He let us all down.

1506
01:29:44,535 --> 01:29:47,288
You testified the defendant
called you at 4:30...

1507
01:29:47,375 --> 01:29:50,811
...to ask you to come to his office gym
for the purposes of sex.

1508
01:29:50,895 --> 01:29:51,884
Yes.

1509
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:55,610
Mr. Cullen, though,
he's not just your lover, is he?

1510
01:29:55,975 --> 01:29:57,169
He's the boss.

1511
01:29:59,215 --> 01:30:00,170
Yes.

1512
01:30:00,335 --> 01:30:03,247
So two hours go by
before you act on his request?

1513
01:30:03,415 --> 01:30:05,292
Yes, I went up at 6:10.

1514
01:30:05,495 --> 01:30:08,214
It was 6:10 because I heard
the weather coming on the news.

1515
01:30:08,295 --> 01:30:09,364
Okay, stop.

1516
01:30:10,535 --> 01:30:12,651
This prosecutor is no fool.

1517
01:30:13,135 --> 01:30:16,844
He's going to change tempo,
attitude, tone of voice.

1518
01:30:17,015 --> 01:30:21,088
He's going to come out with questions
you never thought of just to screw you up.

1519
01:30:21,175 --> 01:30:22,654
So what do we do?

1520
01:30:24,655 --> 01:30:26,566
Yes and no answers. Stay calm.

1521
01:30:26,935 --> 01:30:28,209
Exactly.

1522
01:30:31,055 --> 01:30:35,731
Is it your testimony, Mrs. Black,
that between the hours of 6:10 and 9:40...

1523
01:30:35,895 --> 01:30:38,693
...you were engaged in sexual congress
with the defendant?

1524
01:30:38,775 --> 01:30:39,525
Yes.

1525
01:30:39,615 --> 01:30:42,448
At any point
during this three-hour marathon...

1526
01:30:42,535 --> 01:30:44,173
...did you lose sight of the defendant?

1527
01:30:44,255 --> 01:30:46,086
- No.
- Did he use the bathroom?

1528
01:30:46,735 --> 01:30:48,771
- Yes.
- Is he circumcised?

1529
01:30:54,255 --> 01:30:55,973
You understand the question?

1530
01:30:56,055 --> 01:30:57,010
Yeah.

1531
01:30:57,775 --> 01:30:59,811
So is he cut or not?

1532
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:01,649
Yes.

1533
01:31:02,695 --> 01:31:03,810
Which is it?

1534
01:31:05,775 --> 01:31:08,448
You've polished his knob
three times a week for six months.

1535
01:31:08,535 --> 01:31:10,253
You don't know if he has foreskin?

1536
01:31:10,335 --> 01:31:11,973
I've had enough of your fucking game!

1537
01:31:12,055 --> 01:31:15,365
Why don't you take your questions
and shove them up your ass!

1538
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:34,174
What's happening?

1539
01:31:34,295 --> 01:31:36,047
It's Eddie Barzoon.

1540
01:31:36,215 --> 01:31:37,250
What about him?

1541
01:31:37,335 --> 01:31:39,405
He's dead. He was killed.

1542
01:31:39,575 --> 01:31:41,133
- When?
- Last night.

1543
01:31:41,295 --> 01:31:43,604
- In the park.
- He was running, if you can believe it.

1544
01:31:43,695 --> 01:31:45,367
What is wrong with people?

1545
01:31:45,455 --> 01:31:47,810
At least they got the scumbags who did it.

1546
01:31:47,895 --> 01:31:48,805
Who?

1547
01:31:48,975 --> 01:31:50,772
Two old homeless crazies.

1548
01:31:54,615 --> 01:31:56,287
You're due in court in 30 minutes.

1549
01:31:56,375 --> 01:31:59,173
- Get your things together.
- Are we finished in here or what?

1550
01:31:59,255 --> 01:32:02,406
I'll bring Melissa down to the car.
You better get going.

1551
01:32:05,335 --> 01:32:08,645
I want you to put Eddie aside.
Let me worry about it.

1552
01:32:10,255 --> 01:32:12,166
You've got to deal with Cullen.

1553
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:16,163
You've got to marshal your strength.
Prioritize. Conserve your energy.

1554
01:32:16,535 --> 01:32:18,605
I can't put her on the stand.

1555
01:32:19,735 --> 01:32:22,329
- What choice do you have?
- I know she's lying!

1556
01:32:22,415 --> 01:32:27,091
She's lying because she didn't answer
you fast enough? She lied to you? No.

1557
01:32:27,895 --> 01:32:29,487
She said nothing.

1558
01:32:29,895 --> 01:32:31,931
Fact is, you'll never know anyway.

1559
01:32:32,175 --> 01:32:33,813
He killed those people.

1560
01:32:35,535 --> 01:32:37,127
You really believe that?

1561
01:32:38,415 --> 01:32:39,564
He set me up.

1562
01:32:39,735 --> 01:32:43,011
Cullen fucking set me up.
Melissa... the whole thing.

1563
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:44,490
I know it.

1564
01:32:46,575 --> 01:32:48,167
Got to go with your gut.

1565
01:32:48,535 --> 01:32:49,934
That's your advice?

1566
01:32:51,375 --> 01:32:53,127
I'll back you either way.

1567
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,925
Maybe it's your time to lose.

1568
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:01,206
Think I haven't lost before?

1569
01:33:09,575 --> 01:33:12,009
We talked about this, remember?

1570
01:33:12,535 --> 01:33:13,650
Pressure.

1571
01:33:15,695 --> 01:33:17,094
Take a big whiff.

1572
01:33:19,055 --> 01:33:20,204
All rise!

1573
01:33:20,535 --> 01:33:22,605
The Honorable Armand Poe presiding.

1574
01:33:29,735 --> 01:33:31,088
Please be seated.

1575
01:33:35,495 --> 01:33:37,087
All right, Mr. Lomax...

1576
01:33:37,255 --> 01:33:39,132
...you may present your case.

1577
01:33:57,895 --> 01:33:59,044
Mr. Lomax...

1578
01:34:20,055 --> 01:34:21,886
I call Melissa Black.

1579
01:34:38,935 --> 01:34:40,448
Raise your right hand.

1580
01:34:40,575 --> 01:34:42,531
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

1581
01:34:42,615 --> 01:34:44,765
...nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1582
01:34:44,855 --> 01:34:45,810
I do.

1583
01:35:11,175 --> 01:35:12,927
Feeney, it's him.

1584
01:35:15,855 --> 01:35:18,688
She didn't look well.
Felix tried to talk to her.

1585
01:35:18,775 --> 01:35:21,289
- Where is she?
- Church of the Heavenly Hope.

1586
01:35:46,935 --> 01:35:47,970
Honey.

1587
01:35:49,175 --> 01:35:50,449
It's me.

1588
01:35:51,415 --> 01:35:52,609
What happened?

1589
01:35:52,855 --> 01:35:54,049
Are you okay?

1590
01:35:54,855 --> 01:35:57,528
He let himself in. You need to know that.

1591
01:35:58,135 --> 01:35:59,727
Who let himself in?

1592
01:36:00,535 --> 01:36:01,650
The bath...

1593
01:36:01,815 --> 01:36:03,726
...was running or something.

1594
01:36:04,375 --> 01:36:06,411
I didn't hear him. I swear to you.

1595
01:36:06,495 --> 01:36:08,133
And then we talked.

1596
01:36:09,095 --> 01:36:11,325
And we talked for hours.

1597
01:36:11,495 --> 01:36:13,645
And I haven't talked to anyone...

1598
01:36:13,815 --> 01:36:16,204
...really talked to anyone in so long.

1599
01:36:17,335 --> 01:36:18,848
Did somebody hurt you?

1600
01:36:19,655 --> 01:36:20,770
Yeah.

1601
01:36:21,615 --> 01:36:22,570
Who?

1602
01:36:24,935 --> 01:36:25,890
Milton.

1603
01:36:26,975 --> 01:36:29,045
What?

1604
01:36:35,295 --> 01:36:36,774
He fucked me.

1605
01:36:39,175 --> 01:36:42,770
And I think I wanted him to,
but then I just...

1606
01:36:42,935 --> 01:36:45,449
I don't know, I just couldn't stop him.

1607
01:36:46,455 --> 01:36:48,525
He just wouldn't stop.

1608
01:36:51,335 --> 01:36:52,370
When?

1609
01:36:53,495 --> 01:36:55,406
- Baby, when?
- Today.

1610
01:36:57,175 --> 01:36:58,654
The whole afternoon.

1611
01:36:58,735 --> 01:37:00,930
The whole afternoon.

1612
01:37:02,935 --> 01:37:04,209
I'm so ashamed.

1613
01:37:05,495 --> 01:37:06,484
Today?

1614
01:37:08,855 --> 01:37:09,970
Today?

1615
01:37:11,175 --> 01:37:12,733
Today he was in court.

1616
01:37:12,895 --> 01:37:15,728
He was in court in my presence
all afternoon!

1617
01:37:15,895 --> 01:37:17,089
- No!
- Yes!

1618
01:37:21,895 --> 01:37:23,214
God, no, Kevin.

1619
01:37:23,735 --> 01:37:25,566
Kevin, I'm not crazy.

1620
01:37:25,935 --> 01:37:27,573
You have to believe me.

1621
01:37:32,935 --> 01:37:34,129
Oh, Jesus.

1622
01:37:34,295 --> 01:37:36,126
He did this to me!

1623
01:37:39,575 --> 01:37:41,088
He did this to me.

1624
01:37:41,175 --> 01:37:43,086
What did you do to yourself?

1625
01:37:43,415 --> 01:37:45,007
What are we going to do?

1626
01:37:45,815 --> 01:37:47,373
What am I going to do?

1627
01:37:49,495 --> 01:37:52,931
Sign there. And your relationship.

1628
01:37:53,895 --> 01:37:57,570
She's calm now. This might be
a good time to say good night to her.

1629
01:38:05,655 --> 01:38:07,964
I know why this is happening.

1630
01:38:11,335 --> 01:38:12,973
They want you to sleep.

1631
01:38:14,695 --> 01:38:16,048
It's the money.

1632
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:18,124
Blood money.

1633
01:38:19,015 --> 01:38:22,052
We just drank it down, both of us.

1634
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:24,288
We knew it.

1635
01:38:25,815 --> 01:38:30,172
Winning those cases, taking the money.
We knew they were guilty.

1636
01:38:30,935 --> 01:38:33,244
But you just kept on winning...

1637
01:38:33,615 --> 01:38:34,843
...every time.

1638
01:38:40,815 --> 01:38:43,727
And I can't look at myself in the mirror.

1639
01:38:44,295 --> 01:38:46,411
And then I see a monster.

1640
01:38:49,455 --> 01:38:51,252
Don't do this, Kevin.

1641
01:38:51,495 --> 01:38:53,565
Please take me home.

1642
01:38:53,735 --> 01:38:56,124
Please don't do this.

1643
01:38:56,695 --> 01:38:58,492
I'm not crazy.

1644
01:39:13,295 --> 01:39:15,684
Doesn't Diana look fabulous?

1645
01:39:23,855 --> 01:39:26,415
Alessandra, you look ravishing.

1646
01:39:28,655 --> 01:39:29,770
Mrs. Skylar.

1647
01:39:36,175 --> 01:39:37,733
<i>We are here today...</i>

1648
01:39:38,255 --> 01:39:39,927
<i>... to remember Eddie Barzoon.</i>

1649
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:41,368
Isn't she lovely?

1650
01:39:41,495 --> 01:39:44,851
<i>We have gathered to seek shelter</i>
<i>in our common grief.</i>

1651
01:39:45,895 --> 01:39:48,204
<i>To draw strength toward our tested faith.</i>

1652
01:39:48,295 --> 01:39:49,774
So what do they say?

1653
01:39:50,175 --> 01:39:51,528
How's Mary Ann?

1654
01:39:51,695 --> 01:39:52,969
They don't know.

1655
01:39:55,175 --> 01:39:56,608
She's falling apart.

1656
01:39:57,295 --> 01:39:58,569
Hallucinations.

1657
01:39:58,735 --> 01:39:59,804
Milton...

1658
01:40:01,735 --> 01:40:02,724
It's bad.

1659
01:40:05,735 --> 01:40:06,963
Do you have room for one more?

1660
01:40:07,055 --> 01:40:08,329
<i>Beloved father.</i>

1661
01:40:08,495 --> 01:40:09,814
<i>Devoted husband.</i>

1662
01:40:10,215 --> 01:40:11,443
<i>Trusted friend.</i>

1663
01:40:11,535 --> 01:40:13,890
<i>Esteemed colleague. Benevolent citizen.</i>

1664
01:40:14,535 --> 01:40:15,968
<i>All of these things.</i>

1665
01:40:16,815 --> 01:40:18,851
<i>And yet one thing more:</i>

1666
01:40:19,655 --> 01:40:21,293
<i>Child of God.</i>

1667
01:40:22,095 --> 01:40:25,132
<i>And it is to that Father</i>
<i>that he now returns.</i>

1668
01:40:26,095 --> 01:40:27,653
Eddie Barzoon...

1669
01:40:27,815 --> 01:40:30,534
...such a vibrant member
of our community...

1670
01:40:31,215 --> 01:40:33,285
<i>... has moved beyond us now.</i>

1671
01:40:34,095 --> 01:40:35,653
<i>He has entered...</i>

1672
01:40:36,095 --> 01:40:37,494
<i>... a new communion.</i>

1673
01:40:38,415 --> 01:40:40,724
<i>And for that it is a time of rejoicing.</i>

1674
01:40:42,255 --> 01:40:45,292
<i>God, who is our refuge and our strength.</i>

1675
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:48,883
<i>God, who is that very present help...</i>

1676
01:40:49,295 --> 01:40:50,808
<i>... in time of trouble.</i>

1677
01:40:51,815 --> 01:40:54,090
<i>"Therefore we will not fear...</i>

1678
01:40:54,855 --> 01:40:56,732
<i>"...though the Earth should change...</i>

1679
01:40:56,815 --> 01:40:59,613
<i>"...though the mountains shake</i>
<i>in the heart of the sea...</i>

1680
01:40:59,695 --> 01:41:01,970
<i>"...though its waters roar and foam...</i>

1681
01:41:02,375 --> 01:41:05,173
<i>"...though the mountains tremble</i>
<i>with its tumult. "</i>

1682
01:41:05,415 --> 01:41:07,133
<i>We cannot fear too long...</i>

1683
01:41:07,695 --> 01:41:09,208
<i>... for Eddie Barzoon...</i>

1684
01:41:09,295 --> 01:41:10,694
<i>... has gone home.</i>

1685
01:41:29,295 --> 01:41:30,330
Mr. Lomax?

1686
01:41:30,415 --> 01:41:32,645
No comment.
I'll have something for you later.

1687
01:41:32,735 --> 01:41:34,248
I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.

1688
01:41:34,335 --> 01:41:36,690
You don't know me,
but Eddie mentioned your name.

1689
01:41:36,775 --> 01:41:38,606
Mitch Weaver, Justice Department?

1690
01:41:38,695 --> 01:41:39,889
Staking out the funeral?

1691
01:41:39,975 --> 01:41:41,693
Looking for you, actually.

1692
01:41:42,375 --> 01:41:44,206
I'm in a hurry. I need to talk to my wife.

1693
01:41:44,295 --> 01:41:48,493
Just wanted to ask you, off the record...
I have a few questions about Eddie.

1694
01:42:05,095 --> 01:42:07,563
Milton-Chadwick-Waters
is a little more than a law firm.

1695
01:42:07,655 --> 01:42:09,486
But I assumed you knew that.

1696
01:42:09,895 --> 01:42:12,363
Vagada Holdings?
I'm sure you've heard of it.

1697
01:42:12,455 --> 01:42:15,811
London, Kinshasa, Karachi:
Arms brokering, mostly.

1698
01:42:15,975 --> 01:42:19,684
Munzer-Dietch, in Berlin, Djakarta:
Chemical weapons and toxic waste.

1699
01:42:19,855 --> 01:42:22,927
Ivanco Limited, Moscow:
Money laundering for the eastern bloc.

1700
01:42:23,015 --> 01:42:26,849
It goes on and on and on.
Milton is into everything.

1701
01:42:37,295 --> 01:42:40,810
Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.
He was going to testify.

1702
01:42:41,135 --> 01:42:43,046
DeSoto and Dibalista, Panama.

1703
01:42:43,215 --> 01:42:46,127
That firm sets up bank accounts
for judges in South America.

1704
01:42:46,215 --> 01:42:48,524
Huge drug cases, murder, everything.

1705
01:42:48,655 --> 01:42:51,374
What the fuck do you want?
He's a lawyer!

1706
01:42:52,455 --> 01:42:54,252
Now stay off my back!

1707
01:42:58,015 --> 01:43:00,324
This is a first-time last-time offer.

1708
01:43:00,895 --> 01:43:02,487
I'm learning about you.

1709
01:43:02,655 --> 01:43:05,453
I talked to some old friends
in Florida this morning.

1710
01:43:05,535 --> 01:43:06,650
The Gettys case?

1711
01:43:06,735 --> 01:43:08,487
Eighth grade teacher?

1712
01:43:10,495 --> 01:43:12,167
They found him yesterday!

1713
01:43:13,615 --> 01:43:17,005
He had the body of a 10-year-old girl
in the trunk of his car!

1714
01:43:36,015 --> 01:43:37,926
Is he all right? Get help!

1715
01:43:59,895 --> 01:44:02,250
Marie, do you want to go to the party?

1716
01:44:02,655 --> 01:44:03,644
Come on.

1717
01:44:03,775 --> 01:44:05,049
Horace will be disappointed.

1718
01:44:05,135 --> 01:44:07,330
It's a birthday party. We can sing.

1719
01:44:07,495 --> 01:44:09,451
"...indeed, His divine power...

1720
01:44:09,615 --> 01:44:13,449
"...has granted us all things
pertaining to life and piety...

1721
01:44:13,615 --> 01:44:17,051
"...through the knowledge of Him
who has called us..."

1722
01:44:20,255 --> 01:44:21,893
What are you doing here?

1723
01:44:22,815 --> 01:44:24,487
I came this morning.

1724
01:44:25,855 --> 01:44:28,494
I kept calling the house
and getting no answer.

1725
01:44:28,815 --> 01:44:30,407
I need to talk to you.

1726
01:44:30,575 --> 01:44:33,169
We got her on the first flight up
this morning.

1727
01:44:41,615 --> 01:44:43,287
Are you all right, Kevin?

1728
01:44:49,935 --> 01:44:51,084
I don't know.

1729
01:44:54,215 --> 01:44:56,888
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

1730
01:44:59,535 --> 01:45:01,287
How you doing, sweetie?

1731
01:45:02,495 --> 01:45:04,804
I know something
that'll make you feel better.

1732
01:45:04,895 --> 01:45:06,169
There.

1733
01:45:09,455 --> 01:45:11,889
I shouldn't have left. I knew it.

1734
01:45:13,335 --> 01:45:15,053
I'll never forgive myself.

1735
01:45:15,815 --> 01:45:19,444
- There's nothing you could've done.
- I could've told you the truth.

1736
01:45:20,975 --> 01:45:22,044
About what?

1737
01:45:22,775 --> 01:45:25,812
Baptist Endeavor Youth Crusade, 1966.

1738
01:45:26,575 --> 01:45:28,531
I was here in New York.

1739
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:32,253
That night in the elevator,
you never let me answer.

1740
01:45:33,735 --> 01:45:34,770
What are you talking about?

1741
01:45:34,855 --> 01:45:37,767
I stayed here a week in the Tremont Hotel.

1742
01:45:38,895 --> 01:45:42,046
They had a restaurant downstairs
where we ate almost every meal.

1743
01:45:42,135 --> 01:45:43,204
Wait. Stop.

1744
01:45:43,295 --> 01:45:45,855
Your father was a waiter in that restaurant.

1745
01:45:47,815 --> 01:45:48,850
My father?

1746
01:45:52,695 --> 01:45:54,572
This is great, Ma.

1747
01:45:57,175 --> 01:45:58,210
Honey, please listen.

1748
01:45:58,295 --> 01:45:59,171
Now?

1749
01:45:59,375 --> 01:46:00,854
You do this now?

1750
01:46:01,175 --> 01:46:03,006
Your timing, it's superb.

1751
01:46:03,095 --> 01:46:05,928
You wait 30 years,
you fly up here, you pick today?

1752
01:46:07,255 --> 01:46:11,407
Obviously I'm not under enough pressure.
I don't have enough on my mind!

1753
01:46:13,655 --> 01:46:15,134
Listen to me!

1754
01:46:20,775 --> 01:46:24,688
"Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves!"

1755
01:46:30,455 --> 01:46:32,844
Don't you look beautiful now.

1756
01:46:36,815 --> 01:46:38,248
Take a look and see.

1757
01:46:39,015 --> 01:46:41,131
It's all right, dear. Look.

1758
01:46:41,255 --> 01:46:42,131
No.

1759
01:46:42,295 --> 01:46:44,047
Go on, take a look.

1760
01:46:44,375 --> 01:46:46,605
See how beautiful you are?

1761
01:46:53,295 --> 01:46:54,648
See?

1762
01:47:02,015 --> 01:47:03,209
What happened?

1763
01:47:03,295 --> 01:47:04,648
She attacked me.

1764
01:47:08,855 --> 01:47:10,083
Open the door.

1765
01:47:10,615 --> 01:47:12,207
Open the door, Mar.

1766
01:47:15,575 --> 01:47:17,133
Open the door!

1767
01:47:20,535 --> 01:47:21,604
It's okay.

1768
01:47:21,815 --> 01:47:23,043
Open the door!

1769
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:26,254
Come on!

1770
01:47:26,615 --> 01:47:27,843
Open the door!

1771
01:47:31,015 --> 01:47:32,414
Open the door, Mar!

1772
01:47:32,975 --> 01:47:36,365
Oh, my God! Get somebody! Go! Go!
Mar, look at me!

1773
01:47:37,095 --> 01:47:38,608
Somebody! Help!

1774
01:47:41,135 --> 01:47:42,170
Get help!

1775
01:47:42,775 --> 01:47:44,128
Go!

1776
01:47:50,295 --> 01:47:51,364
Sweetheart!

1777
01:47:55,735 --> 01:47:56,850
Look at me!

1778
01:47:57,015 --> 01:47:58,209
I love you.

1779
01:48:07,255 --> 01:48:08,688
What have you done?

1780
01:48:08,775 --> 01:48:10,413
What have you done?

1781
01:48:12,055 --> 01:48:14,285
We need a doctor in here!

1782
01:48:14,775 --> 01:48:16,731
We need a doctor!

1783
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:21,294
Please stay with me, Mar!

1784
01:48:22,615 --> 01:48:24,014
Stay with me, Mar!

1785
01:48:24,175 --> 01:48:26,131
Get Dr. Job in here now!

1786
01:48:26,455 --> 01:48:29,288
Sir, get away so that I can help her. Now!

1787
01:48:29,775 --> 01:48:31,413
Sir, off! Go!

1788
01:48:32,015 --> 01:48:33,414
Come on. Come on.

1789
01:48:34,455 --> 01:48:37,174
- Help her.
- Out of the way.

1790
01:48:37,735 --> 01:48:40,454
Get Dr. Job, please! I'm losing her!

1791
01:48:55,575 --> 01:48:57,008
Finish the story.

1792
01:48:57,495 --> 01:48:59,963
1966. You were in New York.

1793
01:49:00,095 --> 01:49:02,211
There's a waiter in a restaurant.

1794
01:49:02,295 --> 01:49:03,614
Finish the story.

1795
01:49:07,095 --> 01:49:08,687
He talked to me.

1796
01:49:09,495 --> 01:49:12,168
Nobody'd ever really talked to me before.

1797
01:49:12,375 --> 01:49:16,846
Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away
from home, someone takes an interest...

1798
01:49:17,175 --> 01:49:20,372
Knew the Bible, every word.
Just knew it by heart.

1799
01:49:22,775 --> 01:49:25,733
Every meal, there he was
at my ear and I was...

1800
01:49:26,855 --> 01:49:30,291
That last night he came
to say good-bye and...

1801
01:49:32,455 --> 01:49:33,968
...I started crying.

1802
01:49:34,135 --> 01:49:36,046
And he told me:

1803
01:49:37,495 --> 01:49:41,010
"Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves."

1804
01:49:41,495 --> 01:49:43,326
I want to hear you say it.

1805
01:49:45,975 --> 01:49:47,806
His face that night, I knew it was him.

1806
01:49:47,895 --> 01:49:48,691
Say it.

1807
01:49:48,775 --> 01:49:53,246
You were so proud you'd just come to
New York and done this all on your own.

1808
01:49:53,735 --> 01:49:58,172
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
You wondered yourself. The money...

1809
01:49:58,335 --> 01:50:01,168
...that apartment, the attention,
everything out of nowhere!

1810
01:50:01,255 --> 01:50:02,210
Say it!

1811
01:50:03,175 --> 01:50:05,006
Milton, he's your...

1812
01:50:05,575 --> 01:50:06,644
...father.

1813
01:50:07,415 --> 01:50:08,928
He's your father.

1814
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:12,047
Somehow he found us.

1815
01:50:12,215 --> 01:50:13,853
- He tracked you down.
- No.

1816
01:50:14,215 --> 01:50:15,011
He did.

1817
01:50:15,095 --> 01:50:17,006
He's always been there.

1818
01:50:18,295 --> 01:50:19,967
I know that now.

1819
01:50:21,255 --> 01:50:22,370
Watching.

1820
01:50:23,255 --> 01:50:24,210
Waiting.

1821
01:50:25,935 --> 01:50:27,812
Playing us like a game.

1822
01:50:28,175 --> 01:50:29,244
What do you mean?

1823
01:50:29,335 --> 01:50:30,654
I gotta go.

1824
01:50:31,895 --> 01:50:34,204
No, leave it alone. Stay here with me.

1825
01:50:34,295 --> 01:50:36,570
Forget about him. We can leave here.

1826
01:50:36,775 --> 01:50:39,335
We can go home.
We don't ever have to see him again.

1827
01:50:39,415 --> 01:50:40,609
I can't do it.

1828
01:50:41,815 --> 01:50:43,533
You go home. You go home.

1829
01:50:44,215 --> 01:50:45,330
I have to go.

1830
01:50:45,415 --> 01:50:47,451
- I have to go.
- Wait!

1831
01:50:48,535 --> 01:50:49,604
I love you.

1832
01:50:59,135 --> 01:51:00,693
There you are.

1833
01:51:01,535 --> 01:51:03,890
Look at you. You're terrified.

1834
01:51:04,135 --> 01:51:05,488
Not to worry.

1835
01:51:05,655 --> 01:51:07,327
He'll take away that fear.

1836
01:51:07,415 --> 01:51:09,929
You don't ever have to be frightened again.

1837
01:51:10,175 --> 01:51:11,244
Go on.

1838
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:12,928
He's waiting for you.

1839
01:51:13,655 --> 01:51:14,610
Go.

1840
01:52:24,975 --> 01:52:26,647
<i>You were right about one thing.</i>

1841
01:52:26,735 --> 01:52:29,613
<i>I have been watching.</i>
<i>Couldn't help myself.</i>

1842
01:52:30,375 --> 01:52:31,364
<i>Watching.</i>

1843
01:52:32,135 --> 01:52:33,124
<i>Waiting.</i>

1844
01:52:34,095 --> 01:52:35,494
<i>Holding my breath.</i>

1845
01:52:36,015 --> 01:52:38,324
But I'm no puppeteer, Kevin.

1846
01:52:39,575 --> 01:52:41,645
I don't make things happen.

1847
01:52:41,975 --> 01:52:43,169
Doesn't work like that.

1848
01:52:43,255 --> 01:52:44,973
What'd you do to Mary Ann?

1849
01:52:45,055 --> 01:52:46,613
Free will.

1850
01:52:46,775 --> 01:52:48,766
It's like butterfly wings.

1851
01:52:48,895 --> 01:52:51,409
Once touched,
they never get off the ground.

1852
01:52:53,095 --> 01:52:55,404
I only set the stage.

1853
01:52:55,895 --> 01:52:57,169
You pull your own strings.

1854
01:52:57,255 --> 01:52:59,450
What did you do to Mary Ann?

1855
01:52:59,615 --> 01:53:01,014
A gun?

1856
01:53:01,335 --> 01:53:02,290
In here?

1857
01:53:02,455 --> 01:53:04,969
Goddamn it, what did you do to my wife?

1858
01:53:06,335 --> 01:53:07,404
Well...

1859
01:53:09,175 --> 01:53:11,325
...on a scale of one to ten...

1860
01:53:11,575 --> 01:53:15,409
Ten being the most depraved act
of sexual theater known to man.

1861
01:53:15,575 --> 01:53:19,250
One being your average
Friday night run-through at the Lomaxes'.

1862
01:53:19,575 --> 01:53:21,566
I'd say, not to be immodest...

1863
01:53:21,695 --> 01:53:25,370
...Mary Ann and I got it on at about seven.

1864
01:53:25,535 --> 01:53:26,763
Fuck you!

1865
01:53:28,375 --> 01:53:29,888
Got me!

1866
01:53:29,975 --> 01:53:31,806
Got me! Yes!

1867
01:53:36,055 --> 01:53:38,615
Step it up, Son! Come on! That's good!

1868
01:53:38,815 --> 01:53:41,010
You got to hold on to that fury!

1869
01:53:41,175 --> 01:53:42,574
That's the last thing to go!

1870
01:53:42,655 --> 01:53:47,046
That's the final hiding place.
It's the final fig leaf.

1871
01:53:47,895 --> 01:53:49,772
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1872
01:53:50,615 --> 01:53:51,730
Who are you?

1873
01:53:53,135 --> 01:53:54,887
Never lost a case.

1874
01:53:56,455 --> 01:53:57,490
Why?

1875
01:53:58,015 --> 01:53:59,334
Why do you think?

1876
01:54:00,095 --> 01:54:02,325
Because you're so fucking good.

1877
01:54:02,775 --> 01:54:03,810
Yes.

1878
01:54:04,495 --> 01:54:05,450
But why?

1879
01:54:07,495 --> 01:54:09,167
Because you're my father?

1880
01:54:09,535 --> 01:54:11,810
I'm a little more than that, Kevin.

1881
01:54:12,535 --> 01:54:15,368
Awfully hot in that courtroom, wasn't it?

1882
01:54:15,535 --> 01:54:17,810
"What's the game plan, Kevin?"

1883
01:54:18,935 --> 01:54:20,414
"It was a nice run, Kev.

1884
01:54:20,495 --> 01:54:22,372
"Had to close out some day.

1885
01:54:22,495 --> 01:54:24,486
"Nobody wins them all."

1886
01:54:26,215 --> 01:54:27,364
What are you?

1887
01:54:30,655 --> 01:54:32,805
I have so many names.

1888
01:54:34,575 --> 01:54:35,530
Satan.

1889
01:54:38,215 --> 01:54:39,443
Call me Dad.

1890
01:54:42,575 --> 01:54:44,133
Mary Ann, she knew it.

1891
01:54:45,295 --> 01:54:48,207
She knew it. She knew it,
so you destroyed her.

1892
01:54:48,335 --> 01:54:50,724
You're blaming me for Mary Ann?

1893
01:54:51,215 --> 01:54:52,773
I hope you're kidding.

1894
01:54:53,095 --> 01:54:55,768
Mary Ann, you could have
saved her anytime you liked.

1895
01:54:55,855 --> 01:54:57,447
All she wanted was love.

1896
01:54:57,615 --> 01:54:59,526
Hey, you were too busy.

1897
01:54:59,695 --> 01:55:00,844
That's a lie.

1898
01:55:02,255 --> 01:55:06,168
Face it, you started looking to
better-deal her the minute you got here.

1899
01:55:06,455 --> 01:55:09,527
That's not true.
You don't know what we had!

1900
01:55:09,695 --> 01:55:10,969
I'm on your side!

1901
01:55:11,055 --> 01:55:12,374
You're a liar!

1902
01:55:14,255 --> 01:55:16,564
There's nothing out there for you!

1903
01:55:16,655 --> 01:55:19,374
Don't be such a fucking chump!

1904
01:55:19,855 --> 01:55:22,244
Stop deluding yourself!

1905
01:55:23,335 --> 01:55:25,530
I told you to take care of your wife!

1906
01:55:25,735 --> 01:55:26,929
What did I say?

1907
01:55:27,095 --> 01:55:30,405
"The world would understand."
Didn't I say that?

1908
01:55:30,575 --> 01:55:31,849
What did you do?

1909
01:55:32,815 --> 01:55:34,726
"You know what scares me, John?

1910
01:55:34,895 --> 01:55:38,888
"I leave the case, she gets better
and then I hate her for it."

1911
01:55:39,575 --> 01:55:40,974
Remember?

1912
01:55:41,855 --> 01:55:43,368
I know what you did.

1913
01:55:43,535 --> 01:55:44,729
You set me up.

1914
01:55:44,815 --> 01:55:47,045
Who told you to pull out
all the stops on Mr. Gettys?

1915
01:55:47,135 --> 01:55:50,172
- Who made that choice?
- It's entrapment. You set me up.

1916
01:55:50,255 --> 01:55:52,974
And Moyez! The direction you took!

1917
01:55:53,135 --> 01:55:57,128
Popes, swamis, snake handlers,
all feeding at the same trough.

1918
01:55:57,295 --> 01:55:59,604
- Whose ideas were those?
- You played me!

1919
01:55:59,815 --> 01:56:01,294
It was a test! Your test!

1920
01:56:01,375 --> 01:56:04,333
And Cullen! Knowing he was guilty!

1921
01:56:05,135 --> 01:56:06,807
Seeing those pictures!

1922
01:56:06,895 --> 01:56:10,410
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand!

1923
01:56:10,575 --> 01:56:13,647
You brought me in. You put me there!
You made her lie!

1924
01:56:13,735 --> 01:56:15,566
I don't do that, Kevin!

1925
01:56:15,655 --> 01:56:18,249
That day on the subway,
what did I say to you?

1926
01:56:18,535 --> 01:56:20,446
What were my words to you?

1927
01:56:21,775 --> 01:56:25,245
Maybe it was your time to lose.
You didn't think so.

1928
01:56:25,375 --> 01:56:27,366
Lose? I don't lose!

1929
01:56:27,695 --> 01:56:28,844
I win!

1930
01:56:29,095 --> 01:56:30,448
I win!

1931
01:56:30,615 --> 01:56:33,573
I'm a lawyer! That's my job!
That's what I do!

1932
01:56:35,695 --> 01:56:36,923
I rest my case.

1933
01:56:42,055 --> 01:56:43,534
Vanity...

1934
01:56:44,015 --> 01:56:46,529
...is definitely my favorite sin.

1935
01:56:47,935 --> 01:56:50,324
Kevin, it's so basic.

1936
01:56:50,575 --> 01:56:51,849
Self-Iove.

1937
01:56:52,015 --> 01:56:54,529
The all-natural opiate.

1938
01:56:55,535 --> 01:56:58,766
It's not that you didn't care
for Mary Ann, Kevin...

1939
01:56:59,815 --> 01:57:03,524
...it's just that you were
a little more involved with someone else.

1940
01:57:05,215 --> 01:57:06,773
Yourself.

1941
01:57:09,415 --> 01:57:10,609
You're right.

1942
01:57:10,975 --> 01:57:12,328
I did it all.

1943
01:57:12,975 --> 01:57:14,010
I let her go.

1944
01:57:14,095 --> 01:57:18,293
Don't be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.

1945
01:57:18,455 --> 01:57:19,683
Believe me.

1946
01:57:20,815 --> 01:57:23,045
I left her behind and just kept going.

1947
01:57:23,215 --> 01:57:25,251
You can't keep punishing yourself.

1948
01:57:26,095 --> 01:57:28,814
It's awesome how far you've come.

1949
01:57:29,375 --> 01:57:31,127
I didn't make it easy.

1950
01:57:31,495 --> 01:57:32,644
Couldn't.

1951
01:57:33,455 --> 01:57:34,888
Not for you...

1952
01:57:37,735 --> 01:57:39,134
...or your sister.

1953
01:57:43,495 --> 01:57:45,406
Half-sister, to be exact.

1954
01:57:46,095 --> 01:57:47,528
Surprise.

1955
01:57:48,335 --> 01:57:49,927
Some scene, huh?

1956
01:57:53,575 --> 01:57:55,213
Don't let him scare you.

1957
01:57:56,175 --> 01:57:58,245
I've had so many children.

1958
01:57:58,735 --> 01:58:01,374
I've had so many disappointments.

1959
01:58:01,935 --> 01:58:03,891
Mistake after mistake.

1960
01:58:04,055 --> 01:58:05,568
And then there's you.

1961
01:58:05,695 --> 01:58:06,889
The two of you.

1962
01:58:09,935 --> 01:58:11,527
What do you want from me?

1963
01:58:11,615 --> 01:58:13,333
I want you to be yourself.

1964
01:58:13,615 --> 01:58:15,253
You know, I'll tell you, boy...

1965
01:58:15,335 --> 01:58:16,484
...guilt...

1966
01:58:16,655 --> 01:58:18,885
...it's like a bag of fucking bricks.

1967
01:58:18,975 --> 01:58:20,567
All you got to do...

1968
01:58:20,895 --> 01:58:22,408
...is set it down.

1969
01:58:25,535 --> 01:58:27,605
I know what you're going through.

1970
01:58:27,695 --> 01:58:28,969
I've been there.

1971
01:58:29,215 --> 01:58:30,967
Just come here. Come here.

1972
01:58:31,135 --> 01:58:32,568
Let it go.

1973
01:58:34,015 --> 01:58:35,653
I can't do that.

1974
01:58:39,215 --> 01:58:42,048
Who are you carrying all those bricks for?

1975
01:58:42,735 --> 01:58:44,054
God?

1976
01:58:44,215 --> 01:58:45,534
Is that it?

1977
01:58:45,695 --> 01:58:46,810
God?

1978
01:58:47,055 --> 01:58:48,249
I'll tell you...

1979
01:58:48,335 --> 01:58:51,645
...let me give you
a little inside information about God.

1980
01:58:52,175 --> 01:58:53,927
God likes to watch.

1981
01:58:54,095 --> 01:58:55,448
He's a prankster.

1982
01:58:55,535 --> 01:58:56,809
Think about it.

1983
01:58:57,135 --> 01:58:58,727
He gives man...

1984
01:58:58,895 --> 01:59:00,248
...instincts.

1985
01:59:01,055 --> 01:59:04,491
He gives you this extraordinary gift,
and then what does He do?

1986
01:59:04,655 --> 01:59:07,408
I swear, for his own amusement...

1987
01:59:07,535 --> 01:59:10,368
...his own private, cosmic...

1988
01:59:10,495 --> 01:59:11,769
...gag reel...

1989
01:59:12,535 --> 01:59:14,890
...He sets the rules in opposition.

1990
01:59:15,055 --> 01:59:16,488
It's the goof of all time.

1991
01:59:16,575 --> 01:59:18,805
Look, but don't touch.

1992
01:59:20,415 --> 01:59:22,645
Touch, but don't taste.

1993
01:59:24,415 --> 01:59:26,565
Taste, but don't swallow.

1994
01:59:27,775 --> 01:59:31,529
And while you're jumping from one foot
to the next, what is He doing?

1995
01:59:31,695 --> 01:59:35,051
He's laughing his sick, fucking ass off!

1996
01:59:35,335 --> 01:59:36,768
He's a tightass!

1997
01:59:36,935 --> 01:59:39,130
He's a sadist!

1998
01:59:39,615 --> 01:59:42,175
He's an absentee landlord!

1999
01:59:42,335 --> 01:59:44,530
Worship that? Never!

2000
01:59:45,295 --> 01:59:48,332
"Better to reign in Hell
than serve in Heaven," is that it?

2001
01:59:48,415 --> 01:59:49,530
Why not?

2002
01:59:49,775 --> 01:59:54,246
I'm here on the ground with my nose in it
since the whole thing began!

2003
01:59:55,135 --> 01:59:59,447
I've nurtured every sensation
man has been inspired to have!

2004
01:59:59,695 --> 02:00:03,210
I cared about what he wanted
and I never judged him!

2005
02:00:03,335 --> 02:00:07,726
Why? Because I never rejected him,
in spite of all his imperfections!

2006
02:00:07,935 --> 02:00:09,926
I'm a fan of man!

2007
02:00:11,775 --> 02:00:13,128
I'm a humanist.

2008
02:00:13,455 --> 02:00:15,252
Maybe the last humanist.

2009
02:00:16,215 --> 02:00:18,171
Who, in their right mind...

2010
02:00:18,255 --> 02:00:20,485
...Kevin, could possibly deny...

2011
02:00:20,655 --> 02:00:23,374
...the 20th century was entirely mine?

2012
02:00:23,535 --> 02:00:25,890
All of it, Kevin!

2013
02:00:26,415 --> 02:00:27,734
All of it.

2014
02:00:28,335 --> 02:00:29,529
Mine.

2015
02:00:30,575 --> 02:00:32,167
I'm peaking, Kevin.

2016
02:00:33,015 --> 02:00:34,334
It's my time now.

2017
02:00:36,255 --> 02:00:37,483
It's our time.

2018
02:00:38,255 --> 02:00:39,734
Anybody want a drink?

2019
02:00:41,535 --> 02:00:43,048
I'm having a drink.

2020
02:00:46,255 --> 02:00:48,371
This is some pitch, all this.

2021
02:00:49,495 --> 02:00:51,167
You must need me pretty bad.

2022
02:00:51,255 --> 02:00:52,654
What do you want?

2023
02:00:53,975 --> 02:00:55,249
Eddie was right.

2024
02:00:56,495 --> 02:00:58,565
I want you to take over the firm.

2025
02:00:59,255 --> 02:01:00,290
You...

2026
02:01:01,415 --> 02:01:02,814
...and your sister.

2027
02:01:06,895 --> 02:01:08,692
- Is that it?
- No.

2028
02:01:10,935 --> 02:01:12,653
She's ovulating...

2029
02:01:13,015 --> 02:01:14,209
...right now.

2030
02:01:15,375 --> 02:01:16,774
Your vanity...

2031
02:01:16,975 --> 02:01:19,364
...is justified, Kevin.

2032
02:01:20,655 --> 02:01:21,804
Your seed...

2033
02:01:21,975 --> 02:01:23,852
...is the key to a new future.

2034
02:01:24,495 --> 02:01:28,204
Your son is going to sit
at the head of all tables, my boy.

2035
02:01:28,815 --> 02:01:31,329
He's gonna set this whole thing free.

2036
02:01:32,655 --> 02:01:34,088
You want a child.

2037
02:01:34,455 --> 02:01:36,207
I want a family.

2038
02:01:37,295 --> 02:01:38,614
The Antichrist.

2039
02:01:43,095 --> 02:01:44,528
Whatever.

2040
02:01:48,855 --> 02:01:50,925
But I have to volunteer.

2041
02:01:52,375 --> 02:01:54,093
Free will...

2042
02:01:54,615 --> 02:01:55,968
...it is a bitch.

2043
02:01:57,935 --> 02:01:59,687
I need a family.

2044
02:01:59,855 --> 02:02:01,811
I need help. I'm busy.

2045
02:02:01,975 --> 02:02:03,693
Millennium's coming, Son.

2046
02:02:03,855 --> 02:02:06,449
Title fight. Round 20.

2047
02:02:08,375 --> 02:02:10,286
I'm ready to work.

2048
02:02:11,895 --> 02:02:13,214
What do you say?

2049
02:02:14,135 --> 02:02:15,614
What're you offering?

2050
02:02:17,975 --> 02:02:19,408
Are we negotiating?

2051
02:02:19,535 --> 02:02:20,604
Always.

2052
02:02:22,775 --> 02:02:24,174
Yes!

2053
02:02:25,615 --> 02:02:27,128
What are you offering?

2054
02:02:27,895 --> 02:02:29,123
Everything.

2055
02:02:29,295 --> 02:02:30,364
Anything.

2056
02:02:30,535 --> 02:02:32,890
What do you want?
How about bliss, for starters?

2057
02:02:32,975 --> 02:02:34,044
Instant bliss.

2058
02:02:34,135 --> 02:02:35,568
Bliss on tap.

2059
02:02:36,775 --> 02:02:39,084
Bliss any way you want it.

2060
02:02:41,615 --> 02:02:43,651
That first line of cocaine.

2061
02:02:44,175 --> 02:02:46,769
That walk into a strange girl's bedroom.

2062
02:02:48,495 --> 02:02:49,564
Familiar?

2063
02:02:50,935 --> 02:02:53,529
You're gonna have to do
a little better than that.

2064
02:02:53,615 --> 02:02:54,764
I know.

2065
02:02:55,535 --> 02:02:57,253
I'm just getting warmed up.

2066
02:02:57,615 --> 02:03:01,130
You want more, don't you?
You deserve more.

2067
02:03:01,295 --> 02:03:03,525
How about the thing you love the most?

2068
02:03:04,015 --> 02:03:05,653
A smile from a jury.

2069
02:03:05,975 --> 02:03:09,934
That cold courtroom
just giving itself over...

2070
02:03:11,055 --> 02:03:13,125
...bending to your strength.

2071
02:03:14,575 --> 02:03:16,088
I get that on my own.

2072
02:03:16,215 --> 02:03:18,046
Not like this.

2073
02:03:18,215 --> 02:03:20,524
I take the bricks out of the briefcase.

2074
02:03:20,695 --> 02:03:22,128
I give you pleasure.

2075
02:03:23,215 --> 02:03:24,330
No strings!

2076
02:03:24,495 --> 02:03:25,814
Freedom, baby...

2077
02:03:26,135 --> 02:03:28,524
...is never having to say you're sorry.

2078
02:03:30,095 --> 02:03:31,892
This is revolution, Kevin.

2079
02:03:34,575 --> 02:03:35,690
<i>"It happened</i>

2080
02:03:36,815 --> 02:03:38,248
<i>"In Monterrey</i>

2081
02:03:39,535 --> 02:03:41,287
<i>"A long time ago"</i>

2082
02:03:42,295 --> 02:03:43,853
Forget about him.

2083
02:03:44,535 --> 02:03:45,888
This is about us.

2084
02:03:47,215 --> 02:03:49,126
<i>"In old Mexico</i>

2085
02:03:50,935 --> 02:03:54,769
<i>"Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips</i>

2086
02:03:54,855 --> 02:03:56,493
<i>"As red as wine"</i>

2087
02:03:56,655 --> 02:03:59,169
It's been so hard for me to wait for you.

2088
02:04:00,375 --> 02:04:01,649
Why the law?

2089
02:04:02,855 --> 02:04:05,733
Cut the shit, Dad! Why lawyers?
Why the law?

2090
02:04:05,815 --> 02:04:09,490
Because the law, my boy,
puts us into everything.

2091
02:04:10,455 --> 02:04:14,687
It's the ultimate backstage pass.
It's the new priesthood, baby.

2092
02:04:15,255 --> 02:04:18,053
Did you know there are more students
in law school...

2093
02:04:18,135 --> 02:04:20,126
...than lawyers walking the Earth?

2094
02:04:20,215 --> 02:04:21,648
We're coming out...

2095
02:04:22,375 --> 02:04:23,967
...guns blazing!

2096
02:04:25,255 --> 02:04:26,927
The two of you...

2097
02:04:27,095 --> 02:04:30,929
...all of us,
acquittal after acquittal after acquittal...

2098
02:04:31,015 --> 02:04:34,610
...until the stench of it reaches
so high and far into Heaven...

2099
02:04:34,775 --> 02:04:38,051
...it chokes the whole fucking lot of them!

2100
02:04:40,055 --> 02:04:42,046
In the Bible, you lose.

2101
02:04:43,335 --> 02:04:45,246
We're destined to lose, Dad.

2102
02:04:45,375 --> 02:04:47,366
Consider the source, Son!

2103
02:04:49,015 --> 02:04:50,050
Besides...

2104
02:04:50,215 --> 02:04:52,046
...we'll write our own book.

2105
02:04:52,135 --> 02:04:53,887
Chapter one.

2106
02:04:54,775 --> 02:04:56,766
Right here. This altar.

2107
02:04:57,575 --> 02:04:58,928
This moment.

2108
02:04:59,495 --> 02:05:01,008
Will you stop talking?

2109
02:05:01,095 --> 02:05:02,448
You talk too much.

2110
02:05:03,015 --> 02:05:04,289
Both of you.

2111
02:05:07,415 --> 02:05:08,530
Look at me.

2112
02:05:09,975 --> 02:05:11,328
Just look at me.

2113
02:05:20,855 --> 02:05:23,449
She is really stunning.

2114
02:05:29,415 --> 02:05:30,768
Who am I?

2115
02:05:49,975 --> 02:05:52,364
I've wanted you from the moment we met.

2116
02:06:01,575 --> 02:06:04,135
The virtue of the Devil is in his loins.

2117
02:06:07,815 --> 02:06:09,248
What about love?

2118
02:06:13,095 --> 02:06:14,164
Overrated.

2119
02:06:14,615 --> 02:06:15,525
Biochemically...

2120
02:06:15,615 --> 02:06:19,893
...no different than eating
large quantities of chocolate.

2121
02:06:21,655 --> 02:06:25,091
In two minutes you won't be thinking
about Mary Ann ever again.

2122
02:06:25,335 --> 02:06:26,529
Come here.

2123
02:06:28,055 --> 02:06:30,091
She's right, my son.

2124
02:06:36,615 --> 02:06:40,210
It's time to step up and take what's yours.

2125
02:06:44,935 --> 02:06:46,129
You're right.

2126
02:06:48,455 --> 02:06:49,808
It's time.

2127
02:06:50,375 --> 02:06:52,047
Free will, right?

2128
02:06:57,055 --> 02:06:58,170
No!

2129
02:07:11,695 --> 02:07:13,128
Damn you!

2130
02:07:16,295 --> 02:07:18,206
Enough!

2131
02:07:20,055 --> 02:07:22,523
Haven't I given enough?

2132
02:08:23,895 --> 02:08:25,328
It was a nice run.

2133
02:08:25,575 --> 02:08:27,486
Had to close out someday.

2134
02:08:28,295 --> 02:08:29,808
Nobody wins them all.

2135
02:09:17,335 --> 02:09:19,326
What are you doing, baby?

2136
02:09:21,255 --> 02:09:22,574
Are you okay?

2137
02:09:25,495 --> 02:09:27,008
I am now.

2138
02:09:30,535 --> 02:09:32,048
All rise.

2139
02:09:32,455 --> 02:09:35,367
The Honorable Judge Garson Deeds
presiding.

2140
02:09:38,215 --> 02:09:39,648
Please be seated.

2141
02:09:43,575 --> 02:09:46,135
You're still under oath, young lady.

2142
02:09:49,135 --> 02:09:50,329
Your witness.

2143
02:10:01,735 --> 02:10:03,168
Mr. Lomax?

2144
02:10:07,655 --> 02:10:08,804
Your Honor...

2145
02:10:10,535 --> 02:10:12,491
...I'm terribly sorry.

2146
02:10:13,735 --> 02:10:16,124
But I can no longer represent my client.

2147
02:10:18,575 --> 02:10:20,725
I need to be replaced as counsel.

2148
02:10:20,815 --> 02:10:22,885
Order. Order! Order!

2149
02:10:23,855 --> 02:10:25,573
I adjourn this court.

2150
02:10:25,935 --> 02:10:29,371
This is outrageous. Are you aware
of the consequences of this action?

2151
02:10:29,455 --> 02:10:30,570
I am, sir.

2152
02:10:30,735 --> 02:10:34,205
I want to see both attorneys
in my chambers immediately.

2153
02:10:34,375 --> 02:10:38,004
I'm going to adjourn this trial
until 9 a.m. Tomorrow morning.

2154
02:10:39,175 --> 02:10:40,813
I trusted you to defend me.

2155
02:10:40,895 --> 02:10:43,045
You swore you would! You'll burn for this!

2156
02:10:43,135 --> 02:10:45,729
You just made the biggest mistake
of your life!

2157
02:10:46,735 --> 02:10:48,646
Baby, what are you doing?

2158
02:10:51,855 --> 02:10:53,288
The right thing.

2159
02:10:54,055 --> 02:10:55,693
I think the right thing.

2160
02:10:59,495 --> 02:11:00,484
Here they are.

2161
02:11:00,575 --> 02:11:02,486
- Are you gonna be disbarred?
- I don't know.

2162
02:11:02,575 --> 02:11:05,214
- How's it feel to lose your first case?
- No comment.

2163
02:11:05,295 --> 02:11:09,129
Ain't it better to talk to them all at once?
Press conference tomorrow?

2164
02:11:09,295 --> 02:11:12,526
He ain't going to talk to you now.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

2165
02:11:12,615 --> 02:11:13,889
That's it.

2166
02:11:14,055 --> 02:11:15,727
This is the story you dreamed about.

2167
02:11:15,815 --> 02:11:18,249
- There is no story.
- Bullshit.

2168
02:11:18,415 --> 02:11:21,691
A lawyer with a crisis of conscience?
You gotta be kidding. It's huge!

2169
02:11:21,775 --> 02:11:24,494
They're going to disbar me.
Write about that.

2170
02:11:25,455 --> 02:11:27,525
Wait a second. Can they do that?

2171
02:11:27,695 --> 02:11:29,174
Not when I get through with the story.

2172
02:11:29,255 --> 02:11:31,485
You got to give me an exclusive.

2173
02:11:31,655 --> 02:11:35,364
This is wire service. This is "60 Minutes."

2174
02:11:35,535 --> 02:11:38,845
This is a story that needs to be told.
It's you.

2175
02:11:39,175 --> 02:11:40,654
You're a star.

2176
02:11:44,335 --> 02:11:45,563
Baby.

2177
02:11:47,815 --> 02:11:49,453
Call me in the morning.

2178
02:11:50,095 --> 02:11:52,609
You got it. First thing.

2179
02:12:01,935 --> 02:12:03,209
Vanity...

2180
02:12:03,655 --> 02:12:05,805
...definitely my favorite sin.

2181
02:13:20,535 --> 02:13:23,333
Subtitles : Filou ;-)
