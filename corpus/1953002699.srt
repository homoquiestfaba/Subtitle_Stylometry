1
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:34,812
I'll be honest, Ferb.

2
00:00:34,849 --> 00:00:37,310
I'm having a hard time
putting a positive spin on this.

3
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:38,817
But I guess that's life, huh?

4
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:40,694
One minute,
you're having the best day ever,

5
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,026
the next, you're being fed to a monster
the size of a two-car garage.

6
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:46,862
Yeah? Well, welcome to my life.

7
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:51,492
And everything started out so well
this morning.

8
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,024
Good morning, Perry.

9
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,520
Now that's the way to wake up.

10
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:20,440
This is gonna be the best day ever.

11
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:25,612
<i>We consider every day a plus
To spend it with a platypus</i>

12
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:30,368
<i>We're always so ecstatic
'Cause he's semi-aquatic</i>

13
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:35,373
<i>Our Ornithorhynchus anatinus
Brings smiles to the both of us</i>

14
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,086
<i>Life's never fuddy-duddy
With our web-footed buddy</i>

15
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:42,965
<i>When we're brushing our teeth
It's better</i>

16
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:45,405
<i>Tying our shoes
It's better</i>

17
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:47,761
<i>Combing our hair
It's better</i>

18
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:50,222
<i>Like we're a cheese sandwich
And he's the cheddar</i>

19
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:52,772
<i>Blinking our eyes
It's better</i>

20
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:55,228
<i>Breathing in and out
So much better</i>

21
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,647
<i>Sitting in a chair
It's better</i>

22
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:00,233
<i>And taking a bath
Just a little bit wetter</i>

23
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:04,947
<i>Every day is such a dream
When it's started with a monotreme</i>

24
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:08,784
<i>He's duck-billed and he's beaver-tailed
and hairy</i>

25
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:10,703
<i>You know that he's hairy</i>

26
00:02:10,786 --> 00:02:13,164
<i>Everything's better with Perry</i>

27
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,542
<i>Everything's better with Perry</i>

28
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:18,003
<i>Everything's better with Perry</i>

29
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:20,464
<i>Everything's better with Perry</i>

30
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:22,299
<i>Everything's better with Perry</i>

31
00:02:22,382 --> 00:02:25,553
<i>Everything's better with Perry
Everything's better with Perry</i>

32
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:30,266
<i>It's better
And we just want to tell you, Perry</i>

33
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:33,186
<i>Everything's better with you</i>

34
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,438
<i>Better with you</i>

35
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:37,858
Good morning, boys.

36
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:39,151
Happy anniversary, Perry.

37
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,613
Oh, that's right! Gosh.
I can't believe it's been five years.

38
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,615
I remember the day we first got you.

39
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,494
Come on, kids.
Pick out any pet you want.

40
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:50,788
Look, Phineas,
this one's looking at you!

41
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:52,457
And this one's looking at you, Ferb.

42
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:55,794
Why won't anything look at me?

43
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,215
Ferb! This one's looking at
both of us at the same time.

44
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,344
That thing? You're kidding, right?

45
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:04,887
Is there something I can do for you?

46
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:06,889
Yes. We'd like that one, please.

47
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:08,766
You'd like to adopt a platypus?

48
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:10,184
Is that what it is? Well, yes.

49
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:11,769
- May we have him, please?
- Okay.

50
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:13,897
What would you even name a platypus?

51
00:03:14,064 --> 00:03:16,775
<i>Of course, Ferb and I knew
exactly what to call you.</i>

52
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:18,360
- Bartholemew!
- Bartholemew!

53
00:03:19,945 --> 00:03:21,452
And then when we got you home,

54
00:03:21,488 --> 00:03:24,366
we renamed you Perry
and gave you this locket.

55
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:26,202
Look how young we all were.

56
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,621
Hey, Jeremy.
You wanna go to the mall?

57
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:29,747
You know, I'd love to,

58
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:31,916
but my dad's taking me
to check out his old college today.

59
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:35,462
Booyah! Go Polecats! Booyah!

60
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:38,256
He's already set up an interview
with an academic advisor.

61
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,466
Can you believe that?

62
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,136
Gee, Jeremy, I forgot
you're a whole year older than me.

63
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:45,389
A trip to college?
That's... That's really great.

64
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:48,392
Okay, well, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

65
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:51,271
Jeremy! In the blink of an eye,

66
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:53,648
you'll be moving on
to the next phase of your life.

67
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,941
<i>You'll be going to college</i>

68
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:58,528
<i>and wearing tweed jackets
with patches on the elbows.</i>

69
00:03:58,565 --> 00:03:59,910
<i>You'll be so mature.</i>

70
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,912
And look at me. I'm a child!

71
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,953
Jeremy, you'll see. I can mature.
Starting with taking this silly photo off.

72
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,414
Mr Miggins!
Have you been there the whole time?

73
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,794
All right, looks like the pitcher's ready.
And batter up!

74
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,714
Batter, batter, batter, swing!

75
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:16,970
Yes, sports fans,

76
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,260
that may be the best hit ever
in the history of platypult baseball.

77
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:23,264
And the crowd exhales loudly
through their mouths.

78
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:29,687
And Fletcher snags the pop fly.
He's out!

79
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:32,107
Hi, Phineas! What you doing?

80
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,609
Turning Perry's involuntary reflex
into a sporting event.

81
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,486
Hi, Perry, can I try?

82
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,822
Whoa, momma! Nice shot, Isabella.

83
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:40,324
Did someone lose a ball?

84
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:41,909
Yeah, we were just playing platypult.

85
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,744
I love platypus-themed sports.

86
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:47,165
You know, if we had two Perrys,
we could put a net between them

87
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:49,501
- and play platypult badminton.
- Who's Annette?

88
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:51,336
Ferb, that's it!
I know what we're gonna do today.

89
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,171
No, seriously. Who's Annette?

90
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:58,761
Okay, everyone, I think the tail is all set.
I'll just go check with the foreman.

91
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:01,013
- He's gone!
- Hey, where's Perry?

92
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,058
Did he really slip away?
On his anniversary?

93
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:06,310
Sometimes it seems like Perry's missed

94
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:09,481
every single cool thing
we've done all summer long.

95
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:10,899
I guess he can do whatever he wants.

96
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,148
After all, it's his day, right?

97
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:15,337
Hey, what was that small noise?

98
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:17,489
Let's all go walk over to it.

99
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,175
<i>Good morning, Agent P. A quick word.</i>

100
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:32,214
<i>Recently you've been
having some close calls</i>

101
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:34,091
<i>and your host family has
almost caught you</i>

102
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:35,889
<i>sneaking into your lair several times.</i>

103
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:38,512
<i>No need to remind you,
but I'll do it anyway,</i>

104
00:05:38,549 --> 00:05:39,847
<i>that if your cover's blown,</i>

105
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,059
<i>you'll have to be transferred to
another city with another host family.</i>

106
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,644
<i>And we both know
you wouldn't like that.</i>

107
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,938
<i>I remember the day
you were first assigned.</i>

108
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,833
Enjoy your platypus!

109
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,655
Thank you, cheerio!

110
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,527
Agent assignment complete, sir.

111
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:53,779
Good job, Karl.

112
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,074
If you keep up the great work,
you'll make unpaid intern in no time.

113
00:05:57,116 --> 00:05:59,702
<i>- And I did.
- Don't get cocky, Karl.</i>

114
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:01,209
<i>Agent P, as you know,</i>

115
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:04,248
<i>every operative is equipped
with an autoscan replication device</i>

116
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:05,500
<i>just like the one in your hat.</i>

117
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,293
<i>We've been using
the information you've gathered</i>

118
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:10,547
<i>to replicate each and every one of
Dr Doofenshmirtz's Inators.</i>

119
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,653
<i>Our top men have been
analysing them to determine</i>

120
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,718
<i>if they've been getting smarter
or dumber.</i>

121
00:06:14,843 --> 00:06:17,596
<i>And to be honest, the jury's still out.</i>

122
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,849
<i>Now we find out that
he's in the process of building</i>

123
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,689
<i>an alternate-dimension-related Inator.</i>

124
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:24,395
<i>Your assignment is to stop him
before he finishes building it.</i>

125
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:26,689
<i>Behind you,
rising dramatically from the floor,</i>

126
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:30,735
<i>is Karl, with some high-tech gadgets
that you might find useful.</i>

127
00:06:31,903 --> 00:06:35,407
Sir? Hello? I didn't step on in time.

128
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:37,993
Would you mind
lowering the platform again?

129
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:41,163
<i>Great. Let me cue the music again.</i>

130
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:47,045
Well, obviously, this first item is
our new wrist communicationizer.

131
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:49,589
It has many applications
that will help you in the field.

132
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:52,759
For example,
a powerful directional electromagnet.

133
00:06:52,796 --> 00:06:54,887
It will draw any metal object to you.

134
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:56,852
See? And these are aluminium!

135
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:59,308
<i>Quit goofing around, Karl,
and show him the hologram.</i>

136
00:06:59,475 --> 00:07:00,732
Yes, sir.

137
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:01,936
<i>Pretty nifty, huh?</i>

138
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:06,149
<i>With this device you'll be able to
contact me from anywhere at any time.</i>

139
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:10,737
<i>But don't call between 3:30 and 4:00
because that's when I take a shower.</i>

140
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:14,491
<i>Wait a minute. Is that me?</i>

141
00:07:14,908 --> 00:07:16,035
No!

142
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:19,747
His holographic projection has become
mesmerized by his video image.

143
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,249
I better shut it off.

144
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:22,542
And if you push this button,

145
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,171
it gives your adversary
an incredible ice cream headache.

146
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:29,800
It's gone.
You better watch where you point that!

147
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:32,349
Hey, girl! What are you doing?

148
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,847
Stacy, Jeremy's going to college soon,
and here I am,

149
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,807
concerned with
busting my brothers to my mommy

150
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:38,935
and living in this nursery.

151
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:41,980
A unicorn! A unicorn, Stacy!
"Hi, I'm six!"

152
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:44,691
You've gotta help me
get rid of all this junk.

153
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:46,067
Wow! Bold move!

154
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:51,698
Yep. Goodbye, childhood folly,
hello, carefree undemanding adult life.

155
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:52,991
Yeah, good luck with that.

156
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:54,952
Candace, your father and I
are off to the movies.

157
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:56,704
While we're gone,
you're in charge, okay?

158
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,997
Okay, Mom!

159
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:01,542
And you know, I'm even thinking about
giving up on busting my brothers.

160
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,254
The irony is, that as a grown-up,
you don't need to tell your mom.

161
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,422
You can just bust them yourself.

162
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:09,801
That's it! Stacy,
I'm old enough to bust them myself!

163
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:11,178
That's what I just said.

164
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:18,399
Now, Perry the Platypus, quake in terror

165
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:21,585
as I punch a hole
through to another dimension.

166
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:24,734
<i>- Behold, the Other-Dimensionator...
- Sir!</i>

167
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,861
What? What?

168
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:27,612
<i>I finished setting up the buffet.</i>

169
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:30,115
For crying out loud, Norm.
I was in the zone!

170
00:08:30,157 --> 00:08:32,034
<i>I just thought
you were playing with your doll.</i>

171
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,913
It's not a doll, it's a stand-in!
Pretendy the Practicepus, see?

172
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:39,041
I wonder if Perry the Platypus
practises with a fake me.

173
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:41,586
It would be nice to know
he cares enough.

174
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,839
All systems are green.
Prepare to launch on my mark.

175
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:46,466
T minus 30 and counting.

176
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:50,137
29, 28, 27, 26...

177
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,889
Of course, you'll only need this

178
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,642
if you're attacked by one of the royals
or a member of Parliament.

179
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:57,019
So it's probably okay
to leave the safety on.

180
00:08:57,186 --> 00:09:02,025
And here's your brand new rocket car.
Sweet, huh? Good luck, Agent P.

181
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:05,237
Karl? Did you tell him
the accelerator's a little touchy?

182
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,823
I think he knows, sir.

183
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:10,075
Three, two, one.

184
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:12,536
Service!

185
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:20,753
Phineas and Ferb, you are so busted...

186
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,673
Oh, my gosh! Where'd it go?
You there, small children!

187
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:25,055
Where's the big contraption?

188
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:28,095
I don't know.
It was here just a moment ago.

189
00:09:28,262 --> 00:09:29,351
It disappeared?

190
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:31,640
- Stacy, do you realise what this means?
- We're done?

191
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:34,060
No, some kind of mysterious force

192
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:37,355
always takes away Phineas and Ferb's
inventions before Mom shows up.

193
00:09:37,397 --> 00:09:40,525
This time it took away their invention
before I showed up!

194
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,695
The mysterious force recognises
that I'm now a grown-up.

195
00:09:43,732 --> 00:09:45,947
A mysterious force? I'm not buying it.

196
00:09:45,989 --> 00:09:48,951
I am a woman of science,
at least that's what my horoscope said.

197
00:09:48,992 --> 00:09:52,955
Well, I'm going to prove it to you
and bust my brothers at the same time!

198
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:54,379
Where are my brothers?

199
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:55,917
We just launched them
towards the park.

200
00:09:55,953 --> 00:09:57,418
Buford is there with the other platypult.

201
00:09:57,502 --> 00:10:00,255
Okay, as the adult,
I decree we are going to the park.

202
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,799
Does anyone need to go potty first?

203
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:05,886
Fine, make it quick.

204
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:08,973
Ferb, it looks like
we're gonna hit that building

205
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:10,558
that looks vaguely like your head.

206
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,686
Time to give it a little test.

207
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:19,859
Well, I just finished it.
It can't be broken already.

208
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:24,281
I stand corrected.

209
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,325
All right,
what's with the giant shuttlecock?

210
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,515
We're really sorry, sir.
I don't know what happened.

211
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:30,621
One minute,
we were innocently launching ourselves

212
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:33,546
across the city in a badminton platypult.
The next thing we know,

213
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,753
we're bouncing on up to the eastside
to your deluxe apartment in the sky.

214
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:39,714
Well, it looks like you've totalled
my Other-Dimensionator.

215
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:42,300
An Other-Dimensionator?
What does it do?

216
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:45,888
Well, at the moment, it just
stops giant shuttlecocks, apparently.

217
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:49,016
But it's supposed to let me
go into other dimensions.

218
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:51,274
That's cool! We can help you fix it.

219
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,187
I'm Phineas,
and this is my brother Ferb.

220
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:57,442
I'm Dr Heinz Doofenshmirtz,
but my friends call me...

221
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:01,905
I just got in such a funk.

222
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:03,746
Ferb is naturally handy with tools.

223
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:05,951
I bet we could put this thing
back together in no time.

224
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:07,750
What the heck. Before we start,

225
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:10,039
there's a whole buffet set up here,
please partake.

226
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:12,667
I was expecting someone
who seems to be running late.

227
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:16,087
You're lucky I got a rocket car winch.
Lots of guys don't have that.

228
00:11:17,505 --> 00:11:18,798
Almost there.

229
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:22,803
Okay, field compressor attaches
to the auxiliary generator.

230
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:24,096
Was this working before?

231
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:27,641
Well, if by "working" you mean
"functioning properly," then no.

232
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:29,226
Well, I think I see your problem.

233
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:31,520
Everything's wired through
this self-destruct button.

234
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:33,231
Do you even need that?

235
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:34,816
Well, of course I...

236
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:39,988
Wait a minute. No, I do not need that.
You are absolutely right.

237
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:42,788
So Ferb has
rigged up this remote control

238
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:45,536
so that if we get separated from
the portal, we can open another one.

239
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:48,122
- Nice touch, kid.
- I guess this is the last piece.

240
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:49,832
Okay, Ferb, boost me up.

241
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:54,837
I cannot wait!

242
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,386
- There you are, Perry.
- Perry?

243
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:02,679
Yeah. He's our pet platypus.

244
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,557
Is every platypus named Perry?

245
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:07,393
In a perfect world, yes.

246
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,438
Well, he's a cute little fellow. Hi, there.
Coochee, coochee...

247
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,946
Perry, no! We do not bite the elderly.

248
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:17,028
Again, ow! It's okay.
Platypuses don't typically like me.

249
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:21,408
Well, Perry, you're just in time to see us
open a window into another dimension.

250
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,703
Perry, no! What are you doing? No, no!

251
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:29,292
Perry, this is not tug of war!
This is not tug of war!

252
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,549
Silly boy, what's gotten into him?

253
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,755
All right,
let's get this show on the road, huh?

254
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:37,342
<i>Remember, if your cover is blown,
you'll never see the boys again.</i>

255
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:40,429
Hey, does anyone hear
someone talking?

256
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,639
<i>Never see them again.</i>

257
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:46,143
Okay, here we go. Right in...

258
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:50,940
Perry! No! Not on the sofa!

259
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:53,610
I'm sorry, Dr D. We should take him out.

260
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,158
No, no. Wait. It'll be all right.

261
00:12:55,195 --> 00:12:57,656
I was planning on
replacing this old couch anyway.

262
00:12:57,739 --> 00:12:59,783
Now come on. Let's light this pop stand,

263
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,951
or however it goes.

264
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,587
Gosh, this is...
It's kind of weird, actually.

265
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:11,045
I'm usually thwarted by this point.
Well, I guess he's not coming.

266
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:14,049
And now, behold!

267
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,096
The mind-blowing first images
from beyond our dimensional reality!

268
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:30,525
It's a... It's a couch.

269
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:33,074
That's a bit anticlimactic.

270
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:36,490
I guess it's a nice couch, though...

271
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:40,369
Hey! I got an idea!
Let's swap my couch for that one!

272
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,249
I got it. I got... Or maybe I...

273
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,251
Come on,
you want to give me a hand here?

274
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,504
Awesome, check it out.

275
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:53,883
Hello.

276
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,971
- Say, aren't you...
- Hey, Dr D! Look at this.

277
00:13:58,008 --> 00:13:59,431
Hold that thought.

278
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:00,683
You're famous here.

279
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:13,280
<i>Get off!</i>

280
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:18,619
"Heinz Doofenshmirtz, your leader"?

281
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:27,712
A whole tri-state area
where I am already in charge!

282
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:30,548
Yeah! Hold on,
I gotta go check something out.

283
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:32,550
Hello, again.

284
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:36,221
Is this some kind of test?
Is that really you, sir?

285
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:38,056
Holy boy!

286
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,519
Even the great Francis Monogram's
my slave in this dimension!

287
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:44,063
I prefer the term
"indentured executive assistant".

288
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:46,357
Well, I want to meet
this other dimension me.

289
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:47,525
Where can I find him?

290
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,319
You're from another dimension?

291
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,237
Well, he'll probably
wanna see you then.

292
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,864
He's into that freaky sort of stuff.

293
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:55,450
Have a seat and I'll let him know
you're on your way up.

294
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:58,537
Okay. So I just gotta sit here and...

295
00:15:00,915 --> 00:15:03,125
<i>He's Doof Doof Doof
Doof Doof Doof Doof</i>

296
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:05,300
<i>Bask in his glory
Kneel at his feet</i>

297
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,797
<i>You're in for such a treat
He's Doofenshmirtz</i>

298
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,632
That was awesome!

299
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,344
All right, who's interrupting my...

300
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,068
Do I know you?

301
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:24,362
Yeah! I'm you from another dimension!

302
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:27,193
Well, that would explain
the handsomeness.

303
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,112
Right back at you, big guy.

304
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:32,240
Does that mean
you and I are exactly alike?

305
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:33,825
I suppose so.

306
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,119
<i>Do you want some rice pudding?</i>

307
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:37,501
<i>Ick, no, that's gross</i>

308
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:39,582
<i>It was a test. Almond brittle?</i>

309
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:42,126
<i>- Oh, I love it the most
- Me, too</i>

310
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,711
<i>Do you collect coins?</i>

311
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:45,672
<i>Yeah, just in case</i>

312
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,639
<i>Vending machines become
the dominant race</i>

313
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:55,599
<i>I've been alone all these years
With my irrational fears</i>

314
00:15:55,682 --> 00:15:57,810
But not the vending machine thing.
That's gonna happen.

315
00:15:57,851 --> 00:16:00,521
<i>But now before me, I see</i>

316
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:03,696
<i>Someone with whom I agree</i>

317
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:07,737
<i>I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me</i>

318
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:11,742
<i>I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me</i>

319
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,876
<i>I thought I'd be taller</i>

320
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:22,587
<i>I've been told I slouch</i>

321
00:16:22,628 --> 00:16:25,173
<i>I thought I'd have both my eyes
You know</i>

322
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:26,591
<i>It's in this pouch</i>

323
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:31,471
You know, I can't help but notice
that your scar goes over your eye patch.

324
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:32,723
Yeah?

325
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:34,892
Nothing.

326
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:37,645
<i>Do llamas weird you out?</i>

327
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:39,438
<i>Yeah, are they camels or sheep?</i>

328
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,446
<i>No, no, I meant Lorenzo</i>

329
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,067
<i>That's right
He played Meap</i>

330
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,904
<i>Now I know all about you</i>

331
00:16:47,364 --> 00:16:50,242
<i>And you know all about me</i>

332
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:54,538
<i>And now before me I see</i>

333
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:57,625
<i>Someone with whom I agree</i>

334
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:01,546
<i>I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me</i>

335
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,633
<i>I've found a brand new best friend
And it's me</i>

336
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,345
<i>Now that I found you</i>

337
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:11,577
<i>We can be a duo</i>

338
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,642
<i>That's right</i>

339
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:17,772
<i>Twice the evil
Double Doofenshmirtz</i>

340
00:17:17,813 --> 00:17:20,817
<i>Coming at you Fridays</i>

341
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:23,361
What's that? I mean,
are we doing a TV show together?

342
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:27,866
No. It just sort of sounded like...
I mean, we could. We should!

343
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:29,951
Maybe we're not so much alike.

344
00:17:29,993 --> 00:17:33,497
That can be our catch phrase.
You're the grumpy one.

345
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,003
Wow, he's done really well for himself.
What do you think, Perry?

346
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:46,845
Hey, where is Dr D?

347
00:17:47,137 --> 00:17:51,099
So what you're telling me is you're
still not ruler of your tri-state area?

348
00:17:51,141 --> 00:17:55,396
Well, obviously you did not have to deal
with my nemesis, Perry the Platypus.

349
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:57,148
Didn't I? Observe.

350
00:17:58,566 --> 00:17:59,692
What is it?

351
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,699
This is Perry the Platyborg!

352
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,162
He was once my nemesis, but now,
he's general of my army!

353
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:12,164
Wow! You are good!

354
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:13,999
Dismissed.

355
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,627
That was awesome!

356
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:17,842
Now who's interrupting me?

357
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:20,465
Remind me to berate
my indentured executive assistant.

358
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:22,467
No, man, it's cool. They're with me.

359
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,761
Hey, Dr D. We thought we'd lost you.

360
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:26,137
Hi, fellas!

361
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:28,849
You dare to bring
a secret agent in here?

362
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,058
This boy's a secret agent?

363
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:31,852
- No, not him!
- The quiet one?

364
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:33,771
No! Not... No. Him!

365
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:35,481
This plant?

366
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,444
The platypus!
That's Secret Agent Perry the Platypus!

367
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:42,655
Hey. He's just a platypus.
He doesn't do much.

368
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,158
This is rich. I see what's going on here.

369
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,078
You really think that he's your pet,
don't you?

370
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,044
Wrong! He's using you!

371
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,625
You're just his cover.
He's a secret agent!

372
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:53,918
Here, here, let me prove it.

373
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:56,629
General Platyborg,
come down here at once.

374
00:18:56,665 --> 00:18:59,596
He'll be here in just a second.

375
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:01,676
All right, Platyborg,
you see that platypus?

376
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,927
You know what to do.

377
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:05,889
Perry!

378
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:10,269
What was that for? Perry, are you okay?

379
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:11,520
Told you.

380
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:13,564
How are his vitals?

381
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:16,901
Wait, let me try something. Platyborg!

382
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:19,779
- Do the same thing to those two boys.
- What?

383
00:19:20,822 --> 00:19:21,948
What?

384
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,119
<i>Perry</i>

385
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:28,288
Perry?

386
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,504
Yes! I knew it!

387
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,878
Wait a minute. I'm confused.
Why does their platypus fight so good?

388
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,840
Perry the Platypus!

389
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:39,801
Really?

390
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:40,969
What?

391
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:42,554
Perry?

392
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:43,972
Get them!

393
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,685
You're a secret agent?

394
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:55,026
Hey, be careful with that.

395
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:57,278
So this is where
you disappear to every day?

396
00:19:57,315 --> 00:19:58,863
You come here and fight this guy?

397
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,158
No, he fights me.
He doesn't really know this guy.

398
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,995
You fight a pharmacist?
Why would you even do that?

399
00:20:05,031 --> 00:20:06,622
Actually, I'm an evil scientist.

400
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,458
A lot of people
are confused by the lab coat.

401
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,293
You're evil? He's evil?

402
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,177
So, not only have you been leading
a double life this whole time,

403
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:22,180
but you sat there
and let us help an evil scientist

404
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,725
open an evil portal
into an evil dimension!

405
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,643
And you did nothing to stop us?

406
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:28,062
Well, he did pee on the couch.

407
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,730
Wait a second, I just realised.

408
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:32,608
That was a conscious choice.
You peed on my couch!

409
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,610
No, no. That wasn't enough.

410
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:36,571
That's when you should have
put on your little hat.

411
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:39,366
Not now, after we've gone through it
into this mess!

412
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:42,577
For badness sake,
you can hash all this out in prison.

413
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:43,787
Guards!

414
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:45,789
Brain freeze!

415
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:57,761
I'm sorry. I'm just having trouble
processing this right now.

416
00:20:58,261 --> 00:21:00,347
"So you've discovered
your pet is a secret agent".

417
00:21:00,383 --> 00:21:01,640
I don't want your pamphlet!

418
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,109
He's coming back around!

419
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:25,207
You have got to be kidding me.

420
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:28,127
For crying out loud.

421
00:21:29,128 --> 00:21:31,964
What, they didn't teach you how to
get out of this in spy school?

422
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:40,557
Snap.

423
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:44,853
Look! There's a logo on this parachute!
He's got his own logo?

424
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:07,878
All this time we're like,
"He's a platypus. He doesn't do much".

425
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:10,715
Well, apparently you do!
You do... You're...

426
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:12,300
You're tangled up in the...

427
00:22:24,772 --> 00:22:27,566
Wow! Saved by
unconventional architecture.

428
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:29,902
<i>May I please see your papers?</i>

429
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:35,325
<i>Show me your papers or be destroyed.</i>

430
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:02,938
- Curse you, Perry the Platypus!
- Curse you, Perry the Platypus!

431
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,274
Jinx! You owe me a soda.

432
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,821
<i>Get me!
I'm a Georgia O'Keeffe painting!</i>

433
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:12,574
Fourth and Main.

434
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:18,288
What? No tip?

435
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:20,249
Never mind. I'm good.

436
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:30,301
Looks like they're gone.

437
00:23:31,553 --> 00:23:32,929
You're a secret agent?

438
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:34,644
And you've been living with us
this whole time?

439
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:37,768
Was that evil guy right?
Were we just a cover story to you?

440
00:23:37,804 --> 00:23:40,854
I mean, were you ever really our pet
or part of our family?

441
00:23:41,105 --> 00:23:43,816
Well, apparently not, 'cause
you didn't trust us enough to tell us.

442
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,278
Anyone else around here
leading a bizarre double life?

443
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:49,322
Put your hand down, Ferb.

444
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:53,994
You're a secret agent!
He's a secret agent!

445
00:23:55,871 --> 00:23:58,963
You're right, Ferb. We've got to
concentrate on the task at hand.

446
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:02,586
We've got to get back to our dimension,
and I don't even know where to start!

447
00:24:02,623 --> 00:24:05,840
That's right! The remote!
I knew that would come in handy.

448
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:07,008
All right, let's go home.

449
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:11,179
Wait, that's not our dimension.

450
00:24:13,014 --> 00:24:14,724
Nope.

451
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,605
Now this thing's broken.
We're gonna need some help.

452
00:24:19,646 --> 00:24:22,149
I know! Let's go find us!

453
00:24:26,237 --> 00:24:27,947
Wait, I just realised,

454
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:31,785
you could have been cleaning
your own litter box this whole time!

455
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:34,663
We are not done with this conversation.

456
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:39,501
So tell me, other dimension me,
what do you see here?

457
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:41,083
An ordinary platypus.

458
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,630
And now what do you see?

459
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,178
Perry the Platypus!

460
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:45,883
You know, I'm starting to see

461
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:48,261
why you haven't become ruler
in your dimension.

462
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:50,180
All right, Mr Eviler-Than-Thou,

463
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:53,391
just how did you manage to
take over the tri-state area anyway?

464
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:57,104
Simple, I used an army of big,
scary robots.

465
00:24:57,187 --> 00:24:59,481
<i>We should do lunch sometime.</i>

466
00:25:00,357 --> 00:25:01,906
Wow, that is scary.

467
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:03,653
I tried that robot thing once, too.

468
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:06,406
I hid the self-destruct button
on the bottoms of their feet

469
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:07,532
<i>so no one could reach them.</i>

470
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,659
And march!

471
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,413
I think I've said enough.
I still don't get it.

472
00:25:13,497 --> 00:25:16,959
If we're the same person, why are you
so much better at being evil than me?

473
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:20,801
True evil is born through pain and loss.

474
00:25:20,838 --> 00:25:24,383
You see, when I was a small boy
back in Gimelschtump,

475
00:25:24,425 --> 00:25:26,678
I had a toy train.

476
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:28,596
<i>Then, one day I lost it.</i>

477
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,098
Choo-Choo?

478
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,230
- That's... That's it?
- What do you mean?

479
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:38,107
That's your
emotionally scarring back-story?

480
00:25:38,148 --> 00:25:39,733
That's your great tragedy?

481
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:42,612
Dude! I was raised by ocelots.
I mean, literally.

482
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:45,990
Disowned by my parents and raised
by Central American wildcats,

483
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:48,326
and you're telling me
you lost a toy train? That's all?

484
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,703
That's all you got, really?

485
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:51,121
I had to work as a lawn gnome!

486
00:25:51,163 --> 00:25:53,624
<i>I was forced to wear
hand-me-up girl's clothing!</i>

487
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:56,131
<i>Neither of my parents
showed up for my birth!</i>

488
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:58,587
Well, how did you feel
when you lost that toy train?

489
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,256
I never lost that toy train...

490
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:02,300
Well, maybe if you had,
you'd have done better.

491
00:26:02,341 --> 00:26:05,887
Since you have neglected to take over
your tri-state area,

492
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:09,140
I think I'll go over there
and give it a shot myself!

493
00:26:09,182 --> 00:26:11,351
Great! We can be a team!

494
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:14,062
Yeah, right. A team.

495
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:15,481
Wait, was that sarcasm?

496
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:16,774
No!

497
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:20,069
Yeah! Right there! I'm pretty sure that's
my voice when I'm being sarcastic.

498
00:26:20,486 --> 00:26:22,071
Okay, Buford,
where are Phineas and Ferb?

499
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:23,239
How should I know?

500
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:25,074
They never showed up
for me to return serve!

501
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:27,786
That's considered a forfeit
in catapult badminton.

502
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:29,579
So I went to get some Victory Gum.

503
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,584
A tradition as old as the game itself.

504
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,879
Don't play with me, young man.
Where is the giant platypult they built?

505
00:26:36,921 --> 00:26:38,923
I don't know. Seems to have vanished.

506
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,888
Really? Did you hear that, Stacy?

507
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:42,927
The mysterious force
took the platypult away

508
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,018
before I, the grown-up, could see it.

509
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:48,516
Yeah, yeah. I'm sure there's a perfectly
logical explanation for all of this.

510
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,770
And they laughed at me
for installing a platypult tow rig!

511
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,939
Who's laughing now, Wayne?

512
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:57,359
The logical explanation
is the mysterious force.

513
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:58,527
The real question is,

514
00:26:58,611 --> 00:27:01,072
why does it care so much
about my little brothers?

515
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:03,595
Why doesn't it want them to get busted?

516
00:27:03,632 --> 00:27:05,952
Well, why don't you
ask it, Kierkegaard?

517
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:10,123
What? Existentialist trading cards.
They came with the gum.

518
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:12,918
Wait, he's right! I should just ask it!

519
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,212
- I'll bet I can reason with it.
- Reason with it?

520
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:18,507
Candace, it's a force that you made up.

521
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:20,718
No, I know
what I'm talking about, Stacy!

522
00:27:20,802 --> 00:27:21,928
- Come on!
- Where are you going?

523
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:25,432
To my back yard!
The heart of the mysterious force!

524
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:28,560
Would you like to trade two Sartre
for a Nietzsche?

525
00:27:28,602 --> 00:27:29,936
All right.

526
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:31,271
Sucker!

527
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:39,947
Well, this should be our street.
But it sure looks different.

528
00:27:44,702 --> 00:27:45,834
Dad?

529
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,122
Boys, what are you doing here?

530
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:49,416
You'd better get inside
before the Doofbot catches you.

531
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:52,002
I'm off to the factory. See you next week.

532
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:56,590
Wow! Well, I guess
we'd better get inside.

533
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,554
You might want to...

534
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,642
I mean, these guys might not know that
you're not really a... You know.

535
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,617
Boys! I thought you were in your room.
Get inside!

536
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:23,036
And get your dooferalls back on
before someone sees you.

537
00:28:23,072 --> 00:28:25,956
If you need me,
I'll be hiding in the basement.

538
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,625
That was weird.
Let's find the other us's.

539
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:32,171
And... Hey, I got a one!

540
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:34,924
Pick a Doofopoly instruction card!

541
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,093
"Conform". I can do that.

542
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:38,261
Hi, guys.

543
00:28:38,469 --> 00:28:40,221
No! They're replacing us!

544
00:28:40,263 --> 00:28:41,931
I must not have conformed
quick enough.

545
00:28:41,973 --> 00:28:43,188
No, no, it's not like that.

546
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:44,935
We're you guys
from another dimension.

547
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:47,354
- Different dimension? Is that allowed?
- Apparently.

548
00:28:47,396 --> 00:28:49,231
Look! Perry's back!

549
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:52,359
Where have you been?
We've missed you so much.

550
00:28:52,401 --> 00:28:55,988
Phineas, he's not your Perry.
He came with us.

551
00:28:56,072 --> 00:28:57,281
Sorry.

552
00:28:57,365 --> 00:29:00,076
Wait, can I hold him a little longer?

553
00:29:03,955 --> 00:29:07,125
It's just that, well,
he left one day and never came back.

554
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:09,420
He's been gone for a long time,
and I'm really worried.

555
00:29:09,503 --> 00:29:11,255
All right, you know
the only time we're allowed to

556
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:12,840
make noise is on Doofens Day.

557
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:14,383
So keep it...

558
00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:16,302
Are there four of you in this room?

559
00:29:16,385 --> 00:29:17,553
Five, counting Perry.

560
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:20,228
I see nothing.
I have plausible deniability.

561
00:29:20,265 --> 00:29:23,143
Boy, your Candace is much less
curious about what you're up to.

562
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,269
What do you mean?

563
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:27,272
Well, it seems like our Candace
has spent her entire summer

564
00:29:27,314 --> 00:29:28,821
focused on what we're doing.

565
00:29:28,857 --> 00:29:31,694
Summer? I think that was outlawed
a long time ago.

566
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:35,740
You guys don't have summer?
Well, that's... That's terrible.

567
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,578
Summer. It sounds dangerous
yet oddly compelling. What is it?

568
00:29:40,703 --> 00:29:43,123
What is summer?
Man, where do I begin?

569
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,878
<i>The days are longer
The nights are shorter</i>

570
00:29:47,914 --> 00:29:49,046
<i>The sun is shining</i>

571
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:50,631
<i>It's noticeably warmer</i>

572
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:52,138
<i>Summer</i>

573
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:56,888
<i>Every single moment is
Worth its weight in gold</i>

574
00:29:56,924 --> 00:29:58,264
<i>Summer</i>

575
00:29:58,306 --> 00:30:03,666
<i>It's like the world's best story
And it's waiting to be told</i>

576
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:09,026
<i>It's ice cream cones and cherry soda
Dripping down your chin</i>

577
00:30:09,193 --> 00:30:13,739
<i>It's summer! Man, where do we begin</i>

578
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:17,076
<i>Summer</i>

579
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,498
<i>It's ponds and pools and garden hoses
Trying to beat the heat</i>

580
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:23,583
<i>Summer</i>

581
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:27,880
<i>Bicycles and roller skates
And even just bare feet</i>

582
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:31,217
<i>It's also surfing tidal waves
Creating nano-bots</i>

583
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:33,511
<i>Or locating Frankenstein's brain</i>

584
00:30:34,512 --> 00:30:37,098
<i>Finding a dodo bird
Painting a continent</i>

585
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:39,267
<i>Or driving our sister in...</i>

586
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:41,603
Wait, maybe we're going too fast.

587
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:44,778
<i>Summer</i>

588
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:49,653
<i>It's crickets and cicadas
And a glass of lemonade</i>

589
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,782
<i>Summer
It's sitting with your brother</i>

590
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:57,245
<i>In the back yard
Under the shade of a big tree</i>

591
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:00,665
<i>That's what it means to me</i>

592
00:31:00,957 --> 00:31:04,086
<i>The days are longer
The nights are shorter</i>

593
00:31:04,127 --> 00:31:05,509
<i>The sun is shining</i>

594
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:06,964
<i>It's noticeably warmer</i>

595
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:08,512
<i>Summer</i>

596
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:13,262
<i>Every single moment is
Worth its weight in gold</i>

597
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:14,430
<i>Summer</i>

598
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:19,436
<i>It's like the world's best story
And it's waiting to be told</i>

599
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,858
<i>It's ice cream cones and cherry soda
dripping down your chin</i>

600
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:28,779
<i>It's summer
Man, where do we begin</i>

601
00:31:28,816 --> 00:31:32,551
<i>It's summer
Man, where do we begin</i>

602
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:36,287
<i>It's summer
Man, where do we begin</i>

603
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:39,963
Wow. Summer sounds like a blast.

604
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,128
That's just the tip of the iceberg.
Like this summer for instance.

605
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,297
We built a rollercoaster,
we became one-hit wonders,

606
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:47,299
we travelled through time...

607
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:51,637
<i>This is a message for
other dimension Perry the Platypus.</i>

608
00:31:51,721 --> 00:31:55,892
<i>If you turn yourself in,
I promise not to hurt your little friends.</i>

609
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,480
<i>If you don't, all bets are off.</i>

610
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:05,027
And then we launched ourselves
from a giant Perry the Platypult and...

611
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:11,909
You are kidding me.
You're actually sneaking away again?

612
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:14,579
So nothing's changed.

613
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:16,498
Did it ever occur to you
that we could help you?

614
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:18,291
That we could have made a great team?

615
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,670
But I guess you can't have teamwork
without trust.

616
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:23,672
You don't have to
sneak away any more.

617
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:26,509
We know your secret. You can just go.

618
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:35,935
<i>I walk away from you, my friend</i>

619
00:32:35,972 --> 00:32:43,068
<i>I hope that this is not the end</i>

620
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:47,281
<i>Of all the times we figured out</i>

621
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:50,785
<i>How to seize the day</i>

622
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:54,414
<i>As I walk away</i>

623
00:32:58,418 --> 00:33:03,257
You know, I used to think you couldn't
spell "platypus" without "us".

624
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:06,552
Well, you can.
But it would just be "platyp".

625
00:33:06,844 --> 00:33:09,639
Well, I guess if you guys can't help us
fix the remote,

626
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,848
we could check with Isabella.

627
00:33:10,932 --> 00:33:12,063
Who is Isabella?

628
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,643
The girl who lives across the street.

629
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:16,438
Mom says that talking to neighbours
can be dangerous.

630
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:18,315
- It's true!
- Well, it's time you met her.

631
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:19,566
Come on, you'll like her.

632
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:21,276
What about the Normbots?

633
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:24,530
Relax! We've been
avoiding them all day.

634
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:27,116
If you're really careful, you can...

635
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:28,868
Okay, we've got to be
more careful than that.

636
00:33:28,904 --> 00:33:30,954
<i>May I please see your identification?</i>

637
00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:35,292
<i>Display your travel papers
or be destroyed.</i>

638
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:38,128
<i>Display your travel...</i>

639
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,838
I can't stand these things.

640
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,132
- Hey! It's Buford.
- Who are you guys?

641
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:44,593
We're Candace's brothers.
We're going to Isabella's.

642
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,137
Are you part of the Resistance?

643
00:33:46,178 --> 00:33:47,685
I used to be in the Resistance,

644
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:50,725
but I got so good at it
that I started resisting them.

645
00:33:51,184 --> 00:33:53,561
Behold, the Other-Dimensionator!

646
00:33:53,603 --> 00:33:55,730
Actually, this is
the other Other-Dimensionator.

647
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:58,734
The Other-Dimensionator is
back in the other dimension.

648
00:33:59,443 --> 00:34:02,029
Okay, step one is, push this button.

649
00:34:02,065 --> 00:34:05,032
Step two, stand back in awe!

650
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:10,663
That's it?

651
00:34:10,747 --> 00:34:12,462
Now that I think about it,

652
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:15,502
those two boys made some
modifications to my design

653
00:34:15,538 --> 00:34:18,297
which may have allowed it to...
You know...

654
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:21,508
- To work.
- Great, now I need those two boys?

655
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:27,640
- Perry the Platypus!
- Perry the Platypus!

656
00:34:27,682 --> 00:34:29,934
Jinx! You owe me two sodas!

657
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:32,062
Listen, Perry the Platypus,
I know I told you

658
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,356
if you turned yourself in
I wouldn't hurt your friends,

659
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:35,524
but change of plans!

660
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:39,069
Now I need to hunt them down
which might involve a little hurting.

661
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:42,239
I know that makes me a liar,
but hello! Evil!

662
00:34:43,824 --> 00:34:46,244
Come on,
Isabella's house is right through...

663
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,920
What you doing?

664
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:56,296
Isabella?

665
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:59,133
- Do I know you?
- Hey, Isabella!

666
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:03,679
Him I know. Buford, what do you want?
I thought you were resisting us?

667
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:05,973
I was helping Candace's brothers
cross the street.

668
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,268
Candace has two sets of twin brothers?

669
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:11,104
No, he and I
are from another dimension.

670
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:12,272
We're trying to get back.

671
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:13,857
All right, girls, release them.

672
00:35:19,446 --> 00:35:21,115
Why would you want to
come to this dimension, anyway?

673
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:22,830
Well, we didn't mean to come here.

674
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:25,119
Now we can't get back
unless we can fix this device.

675
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:28,289
Well, we may have someone
who can help you. Dr Baljeet.

676
00:35:28,331 --> 00:35:30,625
- Baljeet!
- That's Dr Baljeet to you!

677
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:33,675
Were you not listening?
Here is the crux of your problem.

678
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:36,799
Think of the universe and all
of the many dimensions as circular.

679
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,885
The energy flows between
the dimensions like this, clockwise.

680
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:43,431
Say this is your dimension
and this is our dimension.

681
00:35:43,472 --> 00:35:47,310
You travelled with the flow of energy.
So going clockwise would be easy!

682
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:50,730
Going counter clockwise would take
8 million gigawatts of energy,

683
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:52,988
overloading the local power grid.

684
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,903
I have prepared a little song
to help illustrate my point.

685
00:35:55,986 --> 00:35:59,990
<i>If you travel through dimensions
Going clockwise makes it easy</i>

686
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,910
<i>Going counter clockwise would take
8 million gigawatts of energy</i>

687
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,206
<i>overloading the local power grid</i>

688
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,880
I know, it needs a chorus.

689
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,882
Anyway, without the 8 million gigawatts,

690
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,171
you would have to go clockwise,
the long way around.

691
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,090
Theoretically, you would get home
but there is no telling

692
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:16,884
how many dimensions
you would have to go through.

693
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,928
Well, do you think you can help us
get enough power

694
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,805
to open the window backwards
so we can get home?

695
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,807
Well, we should probably
ask our leader.

696
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,476
Ask your leader what?

697
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:29,064
Who made the topiary
out of wild parsnips?

698
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,775
I'm allergic,
and it's messing up my voice.

699
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,944
Candace, you're
the leader of the resistance?

700
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:35,946
What are you two doing here?

701
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:38,365
Never mind, I'll deal with you later.
You two,

702
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:40,952
I've been spending all these years
trying to keep my brothers safe

703
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:43,663
and suddenly their faces are
all over the Doofen Channel.

704
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:44,831
We're just trying to get home.

705
00:36:44,998 --> 00:36:46,416
Well, what's stopping you?

706
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:49,002
- Right now? Quantum physics.
- Baljeet.

707
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:50,962
We need to generate
8 million gigawatts

708
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:52,422
for inter-dimensional travel.

709
00:36:52,548 --> 00:36:53,715
Then we've got work to do.

710
00:36:53,799 --> 00:36:55,718
- Isabella, start redirecting the power.
- Aye aye!

711
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:58,679
Gretchen! Monitor the Doofen Channel.
Make sure we're not raising any alarms.

712
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,431
- I'm on it.
- Buford, keep resisting.

713
00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:01,808
- No!
- Excellent.

714
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:05,103
And will somebody
get rid of that topiary!

715
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,521
Thank you.

716
00:37:07,814 --> 00:37:10,817
Great and powerful mysterious force!

717
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:13,320
I know you are
just trying to protect my brothers

718
00:37:13,404 --> 00:37:15,990
but I am simply trying
to protect them, too,

719
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:17,825
from their dangerous inventions.

720
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:21,579
Show yourself so that
I may reason with you!

721
00:37:23,665 --> 00:37:25,125
Maybe we should build a shrine to it?

722
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:27,294
Candace, that's...

723
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:29,963
- It's a mysterious force!
- It's a mysterious force!

724
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:35,010
Ferb! I think we got it!
It looks like home!

725
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:36,429
What do we do now?

726
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,598
I don't know.
I can't believe it actually worked.

727
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,726
Well, thanks, everyone. Hey, where's...

728
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:43,019
That's right.

729
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:49,443
<i>This just in. Our supreme leader
has announced the capture</i>

730
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:53,155
<i>of public enemy number one, Perry
the Alternate-Dimension Platypus.</i>

731
00:37:53,197 --> 00:37:57,201
<i>I guess we won't be seeing him
any more except as a platyborg.</i>

732
00:37:57,238 --> 00:37:59,996
<i>It's 3:30.
We now conclude our broadcast day.</i>

733
00:38:00,037 --> 00:38:01,289
<i>Now go to bed!</i>

734
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:03,041
- We've got to save him!
- No.

735
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:04,751
Too risky. You've got to get back
to your dimension.

736
00:38:04,793 --> 00:38:06,717
We're not going anywhere
without our platypus.

737
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:08,922
I thought you told us
he was just using you as a cover.

738
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:12,092
I know what I said. I was hurt.
But even if it was all an act,

739
00:38:12,176 --> 00:38:14,762
he's still a part of the family,
and we're not leaving him behind.

740
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:16,639
I may never be able to open this again.

741
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:18,641
It doesn't matter.
We're going back for him.

742
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:20,351
- Well, then you're on your own.
- Fine.

743
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:22,520
Just tell us where
Doofenshmirtz keeps his prisoners.

744
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:24,230
- We have to help them!
- No, we don't.

745
00:38:24,314 --> 00:38:27,943
Yes, we do. Remember how we felt
when our Perry disappeared?

746
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:33,407
Oh, criminy, I must be crazy.

747
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,700
All right,
we can get there through the tunnels.

748
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:37,078
- Yes!
- Let's suit up, people!

749
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,246
You know what, Stacy?

750
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:40,373
I'm tired of the mysterious force
pushing me around.

751
00:38:40,415 --> 00:38:42,542
- I'm going to show it who's boss.
- Candace, wait!

752
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,669
I will try to keep it open
for as long as possible

753
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:46,338
but the window is very unstable.

754
00:38:46,379 --> 00:38:48,423
Even the slightest disturbance
will cause it to collapse.

755
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:54,227
- Like that, for instance.
- Hey, Candace.

756
00:38:54,263 --> 00:38:57,225
You guys are so...
Wait, why are there four of you?

757
00:38:57,308 --> 00:38:58,810
Oh, these guys are from this dimension.

758
00:38:58,851 --> 00:39:00,645
Are we inside the mysterious force?

759
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:02,439
I'm not sure I understand the question.

760
00:39:02,522 --> 00:39:04,149
And why is Isabella
suddenly fashionable?

761
00:39:04,232 --> 00:39:05,275
What do you mean, "suddenly"?

762
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:06,860
Seriously, where are we?

763
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:08,403
Candace, I'm sure
you have a million questions,

764
00:39:08,445 --> 00:39:10,864
but right now we have to save Perry
from being turned into a cyborg.

765
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,241
- What?
- We'll explain on the way.

766
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,743
So, how do I dress in your dimension?

767
00:39:13,826 --> 00:39:16,037
Hey, is that me? I look good!

768
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:18,164
Oh, no. You two stay here.

769
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:20,166
- But we want to help.
- That's an order!

770
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:27,674
Wait, so in this dimension,
Perry is a secret agent?

771
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,885
No, in this dimension he's a cyborg.

772
00:39:30,052 --> 00:39:31,428
So, where is he an agent?

773
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,182
That would be in our dimension.
But we're not in our dimension now.

774
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:37,852
Okay, I'm having trouble
processing this.

775
00:39:37,894 --> 00:39:39,854
Now I wish I hadn't thrown away
that pamphlet.

776
00:39:40,855 --> 00:39:42,649
And why are we in mine cars?

777
00:39:42,774 --> 00:39:44,609
This'll take us as far
as the underground entrance

778
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:45,777
to Doof's headquarters.

779
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:47,654
From there we go
up the ventilation shaft.

780
00:39:47,738 --> 00:39:49,703
The detainment centre is on level four.

781
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,744
And the snack bar's on level five!
If there's time.

782
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:55,496
Buford.

783
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,332
I'm just gonna get some nachos.

784
00:40:04,631 --> 00:40:07,598
So, if there's another me
and another them,

785
00:40:07,634 --> 00:40:10,930
then there must also be
a Jeremy Johnson here, too, right?

786
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,187
Oh, yeah, Johnson, Jeremy.

787
00:40:13,224 --> 00:40:15,935
Leads a three-man strike team
on the north side. Good soldier.

788
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:18,104
Good soldier?
That's all you think of him?

789
00:40:18,188 --> 00:40:21,524
Don't you think he's dreamy
or cool or even cute?

790
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:23,110
Tell me at least you think he's cute.

791
00:40:24,653 --> 00:40:26,238
Cute doesn't win the war, kid.

792
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:29,241
Well, I guess.

793
00:40:29,491 --> 00:40:32,536
But what do you guys
do around here for, you know, fun?

794
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:34,210
Look, "Candace" is it?

795
00:40:34,247 --> 00:40:36,708
No offence,
but fun isn't really on my agenda.

796
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:39,127
You know, since Doofenshmirtz
took over the tri-state area,

797
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,503
even though I was a little girl,

798
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:42,672
I've been focused on one thing
and one thing only.

799
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:45,676
- He's going down, down, down.
- Down, down, down, I know.

800
00:40:45,968 --> 00:40:48,554
But what about BFF's?
Or slumber parties?

801
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,264
Or busting your little brothers?

802
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:51,432
Busting my brothers?

803
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,560
I spent every day of my life
trying to protect my little brothers.

804
00:40:54,597 --> 00:40:56,020
I had to grow up pretty quick
around here

805
00:40:56,104 --> 00:40:57,522
to make sure they didn't have to.

806
00:40:57,564 --> 00:40:59,733
Gee, you make growing up
sound like it's a bad thing.

807
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:03,528
It is what it is. I'll do whatever it takes
to protect the ones I love.

808
00:41:03,946 --> 00:41:05,030
Thanks, sis!

809
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:06,240
What are you guys doing here?

810
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:08,284
- We're here to help.
- Sir, we're nearing the target!

811
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:10,411
Don't move!

812
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:18,003
Okay, people, change of plans.

813
00:41:18,294 --> 00:41:19,713
This is as far as we go.

814
00:41:19,754 --> 00:41:20,844
We're not going to help them?

815
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:23,675
No, we're gonna get you two home
where it's safe.

816
00:41:23,717 --> 00:41:25,683
- But we wanna...
- Look, this isn't our fight.

817
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,306
It's their fight, and you two
shouldn't have gotten involved.

818
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:32,685
Maybe none of us should have.
Now we're out of here.

819
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:37,607
I don't remember it being
so dark down here.

820
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:39,609
- Dark?
- That's because it's a trap!

821
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:43,280
And if it was light,
you would have seen us and run away,

822
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:44,615
hence ruining the trap!

823
00:41:44,656 --> 00:41:45,908
I think they get that.

824
00:41:45,991 --> 00:41:47,201
Perry!

825
00:41:47,785 --> 00:41:51,330
We... We, well, came to rescue you.

826
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:55,423
So far it's not going
as well as we'd hoped.

827
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,088
We didn't have a lot of time to,
you know, plan something elaborate,

828
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:02,593
but I guess we could have created
some sort of diversion just in case...

829
00:42:03,343 --> 00:42:05,095
Yeah, we could have thought
this out more.

830
00:42:06,764 --> 00:42:09,809
I got you and I got your little friends, too!

831
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:13,021
Game over! You lose! I win!

832
00:42:13,104 --> 00:42:16,650
Mark this the hour of your doom,
Perry the Platypus.

833
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:21,780
Three forty... I got one of these watches
with just the little hash marks.

834
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:23,782
It doesn't even have the numbers on it.

835
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:25,910
Let's just say
it's between 3:30 and 4:00,

836
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:27,244
Eastern Standard Time.

837
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:30,915
Whoa!

838
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:37,839
<i>I told you, not between 3:30 and 4:00!</i>

839
00:42:40,217 --> 00:42:41,260
They're getting away!

840
00:42:45,222 --> 00:42:47,516
I knew this was a bad idea.
All right, everyone in the cars!

841
00:42:49,268 --> 00:42:52,647
Go, go, go, go, go!
Isabella, start the motor!

842
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:53,857
Yes, sir.

843
00:42:56,651 --> 00:42:57,861
I got it.

844
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:03,659
You two, keep your heads down
and remember your training!

845
00:43:03,701 --> 00:43:04,827
We never had any training!

846
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:06,120
Well, keep your heads down!

847
00:43:06,287 --> 00:43:09,165
Consider yourself trained.
This is going to be close.

848
00:43:11,584 --> 00:43:13,586
All right, you rust buckets. Let's dance.

849
00:43:21,762 --> 00:43:23,180
Can you do that?

850
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:25,141
Well, apparently.

851
00:43:31,147 --> 00:43:33,274
I am so in love with her right now.

852
00:43:33,316 --> 00:43:34,442
- What?
- Nothing.

853
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:36,737
If we can get to the north tunnel
before they get to us,

854
00:43:36,773 --> 00:43:37,988
I can trip the security door.

855
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,324
Isabella, can you give us more throttle?

856
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:41,867
It's all the way in, sir!

857
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:45,329
All right, hang tough.
This is going to get hairy.

858
00:43:51,044 --> 00:43:52,462
Can we make those turns at this speed?

859
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,089
Well, we're about to find out.

860
00:44:14,236 --> 00:44:17,239
There it is. We should be okay
if we can hold off these...

861
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:26,332
- Can we do that?
- No. Keep your head down.

862
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,387
We're slowing down, sir!

863
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:39,638
Keep it on the floor!

864
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,973
It's on the floor.

865
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:44,685
There's too much track, sir.
I don't think we're going to make it!

866
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:46,104
Everyone, to the front now!

867
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:47,647
We're going to have to cut loose these...

868
00:44:49,691 --> 00:44:51,026
The motor's overheating!

869
00:44:57,115 --> 00:44:58,826
Sorry, guys. You're on your own.

870
00:45:04,248 --> 00:45:05,583
What are you doing?

871
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:07,835
My job. Protecting you two.

872
00:45:08,044 --> 00:45:09,462
We've got to go back and help them.

873
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:10,588
That's not our fight.

874
00:45:10,755 --> 00:45:12,132
But you just abandoned them!

875
00:45:12,174 --> 00:45:13,967
We could have made it!
We could have all made it!

876
00:45:14,009 --> 00:45:17,304
Or we could have all been captured,
and I wasn't going to take that chance.

877
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:20,599
These are the tough choices, people.
Somebody's got to be the adult here.

878
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:22,435
You two are safe,
and that's what's important.

879
00:45:22,602 --> 00:45:24,145
- But... But... But...
- End of discussion.

880
00:45:34,156 --> 00:45:37,159
Man, I had my heart set
on those nachos.

881
00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:39,125
Look, mysterious force,

882
00:45:39,161 --> 00:45:41,294
I feel a little awkward talking to you

883
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:45,501
since I didn't believe in you at first
because, you know, it's crazy.

884
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:51,216
But then I saw you eat my friend,
so I've made a little shrine here.

885
00:45:52,092 --> 00:45:56,055
It's nice.
There's a banana and Mr Miggins.

886
00:45:56,305 --> 00:46:00,643
So I hope this makes up
for the whole disbelief thing.

887
00:46:01,644 --> 00:46:03,938
Are we... Are we good?

888
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:10,821
Now you have no choice
but to fix my machine.

889
00:46:10,946 --> 00:46:12,364
- No.
- That's not one of your choices.

890
00:46:12,406 --> 00:46:13,657
- Fix the machine!
- No.

891
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:15,826
Can I... Can I say something?

892
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:18,954
So, I think I'm up-to-date
on the whole Perry Agent thing.

893
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,958
Strangely, that's the most normal thing
that's happened this afternoon,

894
00:46:21,994 --> 00:46:24,085
but who exactly is this guy?

895
00:46:26,045 --> 00:46:27,219
- Fix it!
- No.

896
00:46:27,255 --> 00:46:30,342
Look, I would make myself do it
but apparently he's an idiot.

897
00:46:30,383 --> 00:46:31,969
- Hey!
- Fix the machine!

898
00:46:32,135 --> 00:46:35,556
- No.
- All right, then, you've forced my hand.

899
00:46:38,392 --> 00:46:39,685
Fix the machine!

900
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:40,853
- No.
- Really?

901
00:46:40,937 --> 00:46:43,398
When I was your age, I did anything
a puppet told me to do.

902
00:46:43,439 --> 00:46:44,941
How old do you think we are?

903
00:46:44,983 --> 00:46:46,656
I don't know. One, two?

904
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:48,528
You know, it's hard to tell
with the one eye.

905
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:50,989
Anyway, I don't know why
you're being so uncooperative.

906
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:53,450
All I'm asking you to do
is make my machine work

907
00:46:53,534 --> 00:46:56,704
so I can invade and conquer your world
and enslave your loved ones.

908
00:46:56,745 --> 00:46:57,830
See, that's just it.

909
00:46:57,872 --> 00:47:00,875
Why would we do something that would
lead to our own self-destruction?

910
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:02,877
Self-destruction?
Self-destruct... Wait a...

911
00:47:02,961 --> 00:47:04,295
Wait, that's it. I remember now.

912
00:47:04,379 --> 00:47:06,386
They took out my self-destruct button.

913
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:09,238
I don't know why I put it back in,
but here.

914
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:12,054
I'll just rewire this, like so, and there.

915
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:17,435
It's working! It's working!
It's functioning properly!

916
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,897
Well, look who just became redundant.

917
00:47:21,981 --> 00:47:23,566
Send them to their doom!

918
00:47:25,026 --> 00:47:26,152
Yes, her, too.

919
00:47:27,195 --> 00:47:28,285
Yes, yes, everyone.

920
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:30,616
- Doom, doom, doom and doom.
- Doom!

921
00:47:30,908 --> 00:47:32,618
Jinx! You owe me three sodas.

922
00:47:32,701 --> 00:47:34,036
Okay, doom for him, too.

923
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,622
What? But I'm you!

924
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:38,165
Doom!

925
00:47:38,457 --> 00:47:41,919
Wow, if I had a nickel for every time
I was doomed by a puppet,

926
00:47:42,003 --> 00:47:43,463
I'd have two nickels.

927
00:47:43,505 --> 00:47:46,049
Which isn't a lot. But it's weird
that it happened twice, right?

928
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,687
<i>Welcome, doomed guests.</i>

929
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,815
<i>Come on, keep trudging.
Doom is thataway.</i>

930
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:09,950
I would say, so far,
adulthood gets about a three.

931
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:12,369
You know,
this may be as good as it gets.

932
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:17,500
<i>And now for my all-time
favourite game.</i>

933
00:48:18,543 --> 00:48:20,503
<i>Poke the Goozim with a stick.</i>

934
00:48:21,796 --> 00:48:23,089
<i>Surrounded by lava.</i>

935
00:48:23,131 --> 00:48:26,259
<i>My second favourite game
is backgammon. Love it!</i>

936
00:48:26,296 --> 00:48:28,971
Hold the phone. I could be useful.

937
00:48:29,096 --> 00:48:30,347
What if you need a kidney

938
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:33,934
or a stand-in for boring functions
you have to attend?

939
00:48:34,268 --> 00:48:35,436
Or another kidney?

940
00:48:36,437 --> 00:48:37,688
<i>Doom!</i>

941
00:48:38,648 --> 00:48:39,816
Pooh.

942
00:48:49,368 --> 00:48:51,704
<i>Cranky, cranky, cranky.
Oh, I love the crank!</i>

943
00:48:58,127 --> 00:48:59,259
I'll be honest, Ferb.

944
00:48:59,295 --> 00:49:01,548
I'm having a hard time
putting a positive spin on this.

945
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:04,175
Blah, blah, blah,
two-car garage, etcetera.

946
00:49:04,426 --> 00:49:06,136
Yeah? Well, welcome to my life!

947
00:49:08,764 --> 00:49:10,432
Whoa, deja vu-ish.

948
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,687
Perry, check out that guard!

949
00:49:15,771 --> 00:49:16,856
Keys!

950
00:49:23,446 --> 00:49:24,906
Cool! Look out!

951
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:30,287
Is this the plan?

952
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,373
Tell me this isn't the plan!

953
00:49:32,456 --> 00:49:34,750
<i>You are tampering
with the property of...</i>

954
00:49:34,787 --> 00:49:36,002
<i>Let's make omelettes!</i>

955
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:42,509
Can you get a little more
lift out of this thing?

956
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:44,094
I think I just bruised a kidney.

957
00:49:44,177 --> 00:49:45,595
<i>My bicycle is missing!</i>

958
00:50:08,704 --> 00:50:10,039
<i>Yes! Go, Goozim!</i>

959
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,083
<i>- It's muffin time, sir.
- Already?</i>

960
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,682
Okay, I see where
you're going with this...

961
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,268
I officially prefer our dimension!

962
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:34,524
This may not be
the best time to tell you,

963
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:37,443
but I actually flunked
jungle gym in grade school.

964
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:40,947
I just couldn't get the hang
of all the climbing...

965
00:50:49,665 --> 00:50:51,584
Oh, great, you caught it! Unlock me!

966
00:50:51,959 --> 00:50:53,544
Are you even paying attention?

967
00:50:54,837 --> 00:50:57,465
That's right. It can wait. Later!

968
00:51:04,723 --> 00:51:05,891
<i>More guards!</i>

969
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:07,977
<i>- It's muffin time, sir!
- You're broken!</i>

970
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,607
Yay, other dimension Candace!

971
00:51:51,774 --> 00:51:52,900
Phineas!

972
00:51:54,652 --> 00:51:55,945
Catch!

973
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:04,913
The remote!

974
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:11,963
Perry, let go!

975
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:16,384
What? No, no, don't let go.

976
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:18,220
Perry! Trust me!

977
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:20,263
Two words! La-va!

978
00:52:20,973 --> 00:52:22,057
Trust me!

979
00:53:00,182 --> 00:53:02,851
<i>They opened another portal!
Go after them!</i>

980
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,605
<i>And her!
That banshee screaming girl.</i>

981
00:53:06,642 --> 00:53:07,732
<i>Get her, too!</i>

982
00:53:09,317 --> 00:53:10,568
Thanks, Perry the Platypus.

983
00:53:11,277 --> 00:53:13,279
<i>Stop where you are. You cannot leave.</i>

984
00:53:13,321 --> 00:53:15,615
<i>I use aggression
to mask my insecurities!</i>

985
00:53:17,451 --> 00:53:18,744
The portal!

986
00:53:23,082 --> 00:53:24,875
<i>Boy, I could go for a lemonade.</i>

987
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:30,465
<i>The portal closed, sir.</i>

988
00:53:30,632 --> 00:53:32,050
<i>Oh, pooh.</i>

989
00:53:32,217 --> 00:53:36,346
<i>Oh, well. Time to start the invasion!
And somebody get me a muffin!</i>

990
00:53:36,388 --> 00:53:38,223
<i>But it's not muffin time, sir!</i>

991
00:53:44,647 --> 00:53:47,191
All right, follow me.
We're going around clockwise.

992
00:53:57,494 --> 00:54:00,914
<i>If there's no hospitality
Just get out of town</i>

993
00:54:00,951 --> 00:54:04,335
<i>You can't be lying on formality
And saying...</i>

994
00:54:04,377 --> 00:54:06,050
<i>I guess I'll see you around</i>

995
00:54:06,087 --> 00:54:09,382
<i>You've got no obligations
Nothing holding you down</i>

996
00:54:09,424 --> 00:54:11,530
<i>Find a new situation
And say</i>

997
00:54:11,567 --> 00:54:13,637
<i>I guess I'll see you around</i>

998
00:54:13,678 --> 00:54:17,266
<i>You've got no time to waste
on sentimentality</i>

999
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:20,483
<i>Get out and find yourself
a brand-new reality</i>

1000
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:23,731
<i>You've got to find yourself
a brand-new reality</i>

1001
00:54:23,814 --> 00:54:27,694
<i>A particle duality
A new dimensionality</i>

1002
00:54:27,735 --> 00:54:29,696
<i>- Yeah, yeah!
- I guess I'll see you around</i>

1003
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:33,283
<i>Sometimes it's appropriate
To stop for a snack</i>

1004
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:36,286
<i>If you do then I hope you get back</i>

1005
00:54:36,411 --> 00:54:37,579
<i>I guess I'll see you around</i>

1006
00:54:37,663 --> 00:54:41,417
<i>Hopping clockwise through dimensions
Is a dangerous thing</i>

1007
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:44,253
<i>But it seems to help a lot if we sing</i>

1008
00:54:44,295 --> 00:54:45,802
<i>And we can sing about</i>

1009
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:49,759
<i>A brand new reality
A brand new reality</i>

1010
00:54:49,843 --> 00:54:52,267
<i>A brand new reality</i>

1011
00:54:52,304 --> 00:54:53,847
<i>I guess I'll see you around</i>

1012
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:57,726
<i>A brand new reality
A brand new reality</i>

1013
00:54:57,768 --> 00:54:59,853
<i>A brand-brand-brand-brand</i>

1014
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,858
<i>I guess I'll see you around</i>

1015
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,736
All right, how about
two Kafkas for your Dostoyevsky?

1016
00:55:07,028 --> 00:55:08,446
Stop wasting my time, Buford.

1017
00:55:10,031 --> 00:55:11,700
Wait, I think this is it.

1018
00:55:11,783 --> 00:55:14,036
- Where have you guys been?
- This is it!

1019
00:55:16,622 --> 00:55:19,714
I spy with my one little eye

1020
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:24,464
a new tri-state area that's
one dictator short of a dictatorship.

1021
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,925
Well, that's all about to change.

1022
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:33,098
Pretty soon I'll be ruling
over two tri-state areas,

1023
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:35,184
a virtual six-state area!

1024
00:55:37,061 --> 00:55:41,190
Fly, fly, my Normbots!
We've got some oppressing to do!

1025
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,029
Why is Perry wearing a hat?

1026
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:49,199
We don't have time to explain.
We've got to try and stop an evil...

1027
00:55:52,786 --> 00:55:54,079
It's too late!

1028
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:57,207
They're never going to fire her and...
Hey, did you see that?

1029
00:55:57,249 --> 00:55:58,834
No, I... What's going on?

1030
00:55:58,918 --> 00:56:00,086
Oh, my!

1031
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:02,380
- What is it?
- It's a comb over!

1032
00:56:02,421 --> 00:56:04,632
I know, I should really just shave it.

1033
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:07,677
Not happening. Not happening.

1034
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:09,095
My watermelon!

1035
00:56:15,728 --> 00:56:17,396
<i>All vehicles must stop.</i>

1036
00:56:20,358 --> 00:56:22,109
It's okay! It's a rental!

1037
00:56:28,116 --> 00:56:31,161
Oh, great!
Albuquerque '93 all over again.

1038
00:56:32,537 --> 00:56:34,164
I wish other-dimension
Candace was here.

1039
00:56:34,248 --> 00:56:35,290
She took out, like, 30 of them

1040
00:56:35,374 --> 00:56:37,126
<i>- with a giant stone lawn gnome.
- Agent P! Our agents are being</i>

1041
00:56:37,168 --> 00:56:40,004
<i>overwhelmed by the sheer number
of robots coming into our dimension.</i>

1042
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,590
<i>You must get to Doof's headquarters
and stop him.</i>

1043
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:44,717
Aye, aye, sir. We're ready to serve.

1044
00:56:44,884 --> 00:56:46,975
<i>Oh, no. You kids need to go home
where it's safe.</i>

1045
00:56:47,012 --> 00:56:49,723
With all due respect, sir,
we've been through quite a lot together.

1046
00:56:49,759 --> 00:56:50,849
We're a team now.

1047
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:52,142
<i>Nope, far too dangerous.</i>

1048
00:56:52,184 --> 00:56:54,144
<i>And besides,
our insurance won't cover it.</i>

1049
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:55,479
<i>Tell them, Agent P.</i>

1050
00:56:55,562 --> 00:56:57,982
Come on, Perry.
Let's go kick some robot chassis!

1051
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:01,402
Perry?

1052
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:09,035
Wow, I guess we're going home then.
Hey, where's Dr D?

1053
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:17,002
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Thompson? It's me, Heinz.</i>

1054
00:57:17,044 --> 00:57:18,754
I think I left my keys
in the other dimension.

1055
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:20,173
Can you buzz me in?

1056
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:23,760
<i>- Who is this?
- Heinz Doofenshmirtz! Your neighbour.</i>

1057
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:25,178
For, like, 12 years.

1058
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,806
<i>- Who?
- I live in the penthouse.</i>

1059
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:29,891
I wear lab coats a lot.

1060
00:57:30,058 --> 00:57:33,646
I speak with the accent
I am currently speaking to you with.

1061
00:57:34,188 --> 00:57:35,773
<i>Just like my neighbour upstairs.</i>

1062
00:57:35,815 --> 00:57:37,108
Yes, exactly!

1063
00:57:37,191 --> 00:57:38,901
<i>He's not home.
You'll have to come back later.</i>

1064
00:57:38,943 --> 00:57:40,319
No, no, wait.

1065
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:42,363
This is just beautiful.

1066
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:45,367
I decide to do the right thing,
and I end up in a cell.

1067
00:57:45,403 --> 00:57:48,078
Well, at least my brothers are safe.

1068
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:51,206
What lesson am I supposed
to be learning here?

1069
00:57:53,042 --> 00:57:54,835
I'm Jeremy Johnson.
I'm here to rescue you.

1070
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,087
Johnson, Jeremy?

1071
00:57:56,212 --> 00:57:58,631
Yes, sir.
And I picked up a couple new recruits.

1072
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:02,343
We found a way to bypass
the entire security grid. It was cool.

1073
00:58:02,385 --> 00:58:05,805
What? You brought my little brothers?
Are you out of your mind, soldier?

1074
00:58:05,972 --> 00:58:08,433
I didn't know they were your brothers,
but I should have known.

1075
00:58:08,642 --> 00:58:10,811
They're smart and courageous,
just like you.

1076
00:58:10,847 --> 00:58:12,354
You think I'm smart and courageous?

1077
00:58:12,563 --> 00:58:14,523
Well, yeah, sir.

1078
00:58:15,649 --> 00:58:17,198
Good work, soldier.

1079
00:58:17,235 --> 00:58:18,945
We should really get out of here
while we can.

1080
00:58:18,986 --> 00:58:21,072
Most of the Normbots are away
in the other dimension.

1081
00:58:21,114 --> 00:58:22,699
We can slip away pretty easily.

1082
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:24,576
The Normbots are
in the other dimension?

1083
00:58:24,659 --> 00:58:25,994
This isn't the time to escape.

1084
00:58:26,077 --> 00:58:28,121
This is the time to make our move.
Let's go!

1085
00:58:28,158 --> 00:58:29,248
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1086
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:32,710
Boys, wait. Thanks for rescuing me.
I'm really proud of you both.

1087
00:58:32,746 --> 00:58:35,004
And we're proud of you, too, sir.

1088
00:58:35,129 --> 00:58:36,839
I got nachos! Who wants some?

1089
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:39,759
Nobody?

1090
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:42,387
Mysterious force,
you can see I'm really trying here.

1091
00:58:42,429 --> 00:58:43,972
Please bring back Candace!

1092
00:58:44,014 --> 00:58:45,098
Oh, hi, Stacy.

1093
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,393
And I also want a car.

1094
00:58:48,852 --> 00:58:50,771
I still can't believe
Perry wanted us to go home.

1095
00:58:50,854 --> 00:58:51,897
I mean, look at this.

1096
00:58:51,981 --> 00:58:54,442
<i>There's robots all over the tri-state
area. And now for the weather.</i>

1097
00:58:55,401 --> 00:58:57,320
<i>There's robots, Phil! Robots!</i>

1098
00:58:58,571 --> 00:59:00,198
You'd think he'd need
all the help he could get...

1099
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:01,324
Hey, what's that?

1100
00:59:01,866 --> 00:59:03,034
Ferb, do you hear that?

1101
00:59:05,203 --> 00:59:06,330
It's Perry's locket.

1102
00:59:08,207 --> 00:59:09,875
It's like a homing device.

1103
00:59:18,635 --> 00:59:20,011
Shall we?

1104
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:25,809
This must be Perry's lair.

1105
00:59:26,059 --> 00:59:29,063
<i>Welcome, Phineas and Ferb.
Please insert the key.</i>

1106
00:59:29,647 --> 00:59:30,898
Do you have a key?

1107
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,110
<i>Please insert the key.</i>

1108
00:59:34,193 --> 00:59:35,236
Good try.

1109
00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:38,323
<i>Please insert the key.
Please insert the key.</i>

1110
00:59:38,907 --> 00:59:42,661
That's odd. It's a shaped keyhole.
It kind of looks like...

1111
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:44,329
Wait a minute.

1112
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,930
<i>Phineas and Ferb, this message
is top secret, for your ears only.</i>

1113
00:59:55,967 --> 01:00:00,055
<i>If you are hearing this, the tri-state area
is at emergency alert level Alpha Red.</i>

1114
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,848
<i>Agent P needs your help.</i>

1115
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:04,059
How does he know
we'll know what to do?

1116
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,811
<i>He knows you will know what to do.</i>

1117
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,419
<i>He also knows you two are
the only ones capable of helping him</i>

1118
01:00:09,455 --> 01:00:12,985
<i>because you two are the only ones
capable of creating these.</i>

1119
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:16,447
<i>Auto-scan replication initiated.</i>

1120
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:32,089
Ferb, I think I know
what we're gonna do today.

1121
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:41,141
<i>You have a new leader.</i>

1122
01:00:41,183 --> 01:00:43,685
<i>Put on your dooferalls. 36-inch waist.</i>

1123
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,187
No way! I'm a 34!

1124
01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:18,830
So, I guess you trusted us after all.

1125
01:02:25,129 --> 01:02:27,548
I was wrong. It was not for me!

1126
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:30,259
Heads up!
Platyposterior coming through!

1127
01:02:35,306 --> 01:02:37,142
Now this is what I call busting.

1128
01:03:13,473 --> 01:03:16,643
All right, everyone!
Let's kick some robot chassis!

1129
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,894
Yeah!

1130
01:03:18,312 --> 01:03:19,897
All right, that is very good.

1131
01:03:19,938 --> 01:03:22,232
Phineas! Anything we can do?

1132
01:03:22,316 --> 01:03:24,193
Yeah! Musical accompaniment!

1133
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:33,036
<i>We're gonna kick some robot chassis</i>

1134
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,789
<i>So you better tell your robot nation</i>

1135
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:38,667
<i>To say a robot prayer
'Cause you better prepare</i>

1136
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:41,545
<i>For an automaton annihilation</i>

1137
01:03:41,962 --> 01:03:44,637
<i>You think you're gonna take us down</i>

1138
01:03:44,673 --> 01:03:47,135
<i>Well, mechanical man, you just try it</i>

1139
01:03:47,218 --> 01:03:49,262
<i>You're gonna ride that rail out of town</i>

1140
01:03:49,345 --> 01:03:51,514
<i>This is a robot riot</i>

1141
01:03:52,265 --> 01:03:55,060
<i>I think you know what I mean</i>

1142
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:57,437
<i>This is a robot riot
I'm gonna break you down</i>

1143
01:03:57,521 --> 01:03:59,690
<i>And sell you for scrap metal
But I'll keep enough</i>

1144
01:03:59,815 --> 01:04:01,655
<i>To build myself a trampoline</i>

1145
01:04:01,692 --> 01:04:02,949
<i>'Cause your momma was a blender</i>

1146
01:04:02,985 --> 01:04:06,072
<i>And your dad was just
a washing machine</i>

1147
01:04:06,405 --> 01:04:07,787
<i>This is a robot riot</i>

1148
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:10,535
<i>I'm gonna break you up
I'm gonna break you down</i>

1149
01:04:10,577 --> 01:04:13,413
<i>I'm gonna take you
to a chop shop downtown</i>

1150
01:04:13,455 --> 01:04:16,249
<i>You know that you'll be dreading
This android Armageddon</i>

1151
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:19,169
<i>I think you better check your fluids
'Cause I know you're sweating</i>

1152
01:04:19,253 --> 01:04:22,006
<i>You know you're gonna lose
And sing the robot blues</i>

1153
01:04:22,089 --> 01:04:24,717
<i>You'll blow a fuse
And take a robot snooze</i>

1154
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,679
<i>I will deactivate you
Because I kind of hate you</i>

1155
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,102
<i>Don't want to beat around the bush</i>

1156
01:04:29,138 --> 01:04:31,391
<i>- We're gonna decimate you
- This is a robot riot</i>

1157
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,269
<i>Oh, man, it's on</i>

1158
01:04:34,853 --> 01:04:36,313
<i>This is a robot riot</i>

1159
01:04:36,396 --> 01:04:38,857
<i>I'm gonna rip you up
And put you back together</i>

1160
01:04:38,894 --> 01:04:41,282
<i>In a new configuration
Just to mow my lawn</i>

1161
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:46,115
<i>'Cause your sister is a fridge
And you know her light is always on</i>

1162
01:04:46,157 --> 01:04:47,575
<i>This is a robot riot</i>

1163
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,124
<i>Robot riot...</i>

1164
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,288
We've got to do
something about that portal.

1165
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:57,503
Ferb! We're gonna go
try to close the portal!

1166
01:04:57,586 --> 01:04:59,129
<i>This is a robot riot</i>

1167
01:04:59,171 --> 01:05:01,924
<i>I'm gonna rip you up
I'm gonna break you down</i>

1168
01:05:02,007 --> 01:05:04,802
<i>I'm gonna take you
to the chop shop downtown</i>

1169
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:07,510
<i>I'm gonna rip you up
I'm gonna break you down</i>

1170
01:05:07,547 --> 01:05:10,183
<i>I'm gonna take you
to the chop shop downtown</i>

1171
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,507
What?

1172
01:05:45,096 --> 01:05:47,390
I've had just about enough of you, you...

1173
01:05:47,807 --> 01:05:49,267
What is on this!

1174
01:06:13,544 --> 01:06:15,963
I was wrong, Stacy, about everything.

1175
01:06:16,255 --> 01:06:19,008
I'm not a grown-up.
I can't control mysterious forces.

1176
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:21,260
I can't even get my mom
to see what my brothers are doing!

1177
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:26,015
Stacy, that's it! I can't get my mom
to see what my brothers are doing!

1178
01:06:26,052 --> 01:06:27,434
Candace, where are you going?

1179
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:29,853
I'm gonna bust my brothers to my mom!

1180
01:06:29,895 --> 01:06:31,313
And I'm gonna fail!

1181
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:33,816
No, it's Heinz Doofenshmirtz.

1182
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:35,567
You borrowed sugar from me
this morning.

1183
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:37,116
<i>I don't have any sugar.</i>

1184
01:06:37,152 --> 01:06:39,614
<i>I had to borrow some
from my neighbour this morning.</i>

1185
01:06:39,697 --> 01:06:40,740
<i>Yeah. That's me!</i>

1186
01:06:40,781 --> 01:06:43,326
<i>He's a nice man,
but I hear he's divorced.</i>

1187
01:06:43,362 --> 01:06:44,869
That she remembers.

1188
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:50,876
Mom!

1189
01:06:50,917 --> 01:06:52,461
Candace, what are you doing here?

1190
01:06:52,503 --> 01:06:54,171
You got to come outside
and bust the boys!

1191
01:06:54,207 --> 01:06:55,297
I'm not leaving now.

1192
01:06:55,339 --> 01:06:57,883
The girl is about to forgive the guy
for the clich misunderstanding.

1193
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,136
Well, after she battles these robots.

1194
01:07:00,178 --> 01:07:02,180
This 3-D is amazing!

1195
01:07:04,724 --> 01:07:06,309
Ferb, we'll handle it down here.

1196
01:07:06,893 --> 01:07:08,019
Go help Phineas!

1197
01:07:37,218 --> 01:07:39,262
Come on, you stupid thing. Work!

1198
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,558
So that dish must be
what's controlling the robots.

1199
01:07:43,641 --> 01:07:46,686
Maybe I don't need to close the portal
if I could just take out that...

1200
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:48,105
Yeah!

1201
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,649
No, you don't.

1202
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,777
Now the baseball is on the other foot.

1203
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,864
Or however that saying goes, I'm not...
I'm not really sure.

1204
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,658
Hey, hey, hey, where are you going?

1205
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:01,661
You know, all that's going to happen
from you guys coming up here

1206
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:04,998
is that I'm going to have
a brand-new platyborg.

1207
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,584
And maybe even a boyborg!

1208
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,545
Try saying that five times fast.

1209
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,880
Boyborg, boyborg, boyborg,
boyborg, boyborg...

1210
01:08:11,964 --> 01:08:13,799
I guess it's not that hard, never mind.

1211
01:09:05,313 --> 01:09:06,481
You know something, kid?

1212
01:09:06,898 --> 01:09:10,194
You've been a thorn in my side
all day long.

1213
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:15,783
But that's about to change right now!

1214
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:25,627
No!

1215
01:09:33,052 --> 01:09:35,513
My babies! No, what have you done?

1216
01:09:47,151 --> 01:09:49,069
It's weird that
Perry's a secret agent, huh?

1217
01:09:49,278 --> 01:09:51,822
Yeah, but it was obvious in retrospect.

1218
01:09:51,947 --> 01:09:53,282
Has anyone seen my pants?

1219
01:09:53,366 --> 01:09:54,534
Yeah, they're over there.

1220
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:57,287
Wolverines!

1221
01:09:57,537 --> 01:09:59,502
Mom, if you care one iota about me,

1222
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:02,834
your family, and your city,
you'll come outside with me right now!

1223
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:04,586
Well, I guess I could use
some more popcorn.

1224
01:10:04,711 --> 01:10:06,505
Great! Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

1225
01:10:09,091 --> 01:10:12,136
Ferb! Bro, I just hit
the best home run ever!

1226
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:25,442
Now, tremble before me!

1227
01:10:26,151 --> 01:10:29,738
No, I'm down here.
See, one last trick up my sleeve.

1228
01:10:29,775 --> 01:10:33,451
It's me! I'm the trick up my own sleeves,

1229
01:10:33,487 --> 01:10:36,037
'cause I'm in the sleeve, get it?

1230
01:10:36,871 --> 01:10:38,331
Pearls before swine.

1231
01:10:39,499 --> 01:10:42,878
Hope you got your 3-D glasses
'cause I'm coming at you!

1232
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:46,173
Yeah!

1233
01:10:46,882 --> 01:10:48,050
Hey!

1234
01:10:48,592 --> 01:10:51,304
What? I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

1235
01:10:51,762 --> 01:10:54,932
I got a little something just for you.

1236
01:10:56,893 --> 01:10:58,144
Here.

1237
01:10:58,353 --> 01:10:59,521
Choo-Choo!

1238
01:11:01,898 --> 01:11:04,026
Yeah, it's mine.
See, I told you I never lost it.

1239
01:11:04,067 --> 01:11:06,904
It was in a box in my pantry labelled
"VHS tapes".

1240
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:09,615
Go figure. Anyway, you can have it.

1241
01:11:09,657 --> 01:11:12,332
I can't believe it! Choo-Choo, it is you!

1242
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:18,249
Heart melting, back-story resolving,
evilness diminishing.

1243
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:19,960
It's the least I can do.

1244
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:21,837
You know, I don't even know
what I was thinking

1245
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,922
with the whole evil robots thing.

1246
01:11:24,089 --> 01:11:26,759
Actually, when I look around,
I'm really embarrassed.

1247
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,512
Let me clean this up.
Look! Self-destruct button.

1248
01:11:29,929 --> 01:11:31,222
You.

1249
01:11:31,681 --> 01:11:32,932
Yeah. Here we go!

1250
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:41,780
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on, hurry, hurry!

1251
01:11:41,817 --> 01:11:44,153
Do I even need to say
"there's nothing there" any more?

1252
01:11:44,278 --> 01:11:46,822
Mom, you can say it all you want.
There's nothing there!

1253
01:11:46,864 --> 01:11:50,076
Whoo-hoo! I did it, I saved the world!

1254
01:11:51,536 --> 01:11:53,371
You can go back to your movie now.

1255
01:11:58,001 --> 01:11:59,836
Yeah, you know what?
We're totally cool now.

1256
01:11:59,873 --> 01:12:01,385
I'm just gonna go return to my home

1257
01:12:01,421 --> 01:12:05,134
and live out the rest of my days
with my Choo-Choo. Okay then, ciao!

1258
01:12:05,509 --> 01:12:07,803
Home. It's good to be...

1259
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:11,015
Book him, ladies.

1260
01:12:11,099 --> 01:12:14,102
You know, my crimes against humanity
had just completely slipped my mind.

1261
01:12:15,019 --> 01:12:17,898
Hey! Did you guys just see that?
I saved Danville!

1262
01:12:18,148 --> 01:12:19,316
Good job, soldier.

1263
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:20,484
So what'll you do now?

1264
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:24,154
Wow, I haven't thought of anything
but busting Doofenshmirtz for years.

1265
01:12:24,196 --> 01:12:27,283
- I don't know.
- Well, I know what interests I'd pursue.

1266
01:12:27,867 --> 01:12:29,160
Hey! Here you all are.

1267
01:12:29,285 --> 01:12:32,455
I'll take that under consideration.
What about you, Candace?

1268
01:12:32,705 --> 01:12:33,915
You know, after all of this,

1269
01:12:33,998 --> 01:12:36,918
I'm gonna give myself
a little more time to be young.

1270
01:12:37,002 --> 01:12:38,420
It's not such a bad place to be.

1271
01:12:38,503 --> 01:12:40,297
You know what? Me, too.

1272
01:12:40,714 --> 01:12:43,634
Hey, I just wanted to say thanks
for telling us all about summer,

1273
01:12:43,717 --> 01:12:47,763
you know, opening our horizons,
and teaching Ferb classical guitar.

1274
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:57,315
Hey! It's our Perry! Perry!

1275
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:59,818
Looks like the evil
was fried right out of him.

1276
01:12:59,902 --> 01:13:01,528
Sorry he's mostly made of metal now.

1277
01:13:01,612 --> 01:13:03,822
Are you kidding?
That makes him extra cool!

1278
01:13:03,906 --> 01:13:05,449
Thanks so much, guys.

1279
01:13:05,491 --> 01:13:07,076
I'm glad we could help.

1280
01:13:11,748 --> 01:13:14,167
Man, this has been
the greatest day ever.

1281
01:13:14,209 --> 01:13:15,856
Imagine how much fun
we can have together

1282
01:13:15,893 --> 01:13:17,467
now that we know you're a secret agent.

1283
01:13:17,504 --> 01:13:21,175
Yes, yes, the next 15 minutes
should be a real hoot.

1284
01:13:21,216 --> 01:13:23,969
Well, then, of course,
Agent P will be sent away forever.

1285
01:13:24,178 --> 01:13:25,930
- What?
- You didn't know?

1286
01:13:25,972 --> 01:13:28,062
- Didn't he give you a pamphlet?
- We threw it away.

1287
01:13:28,099 --> 01:13:31,290
- Does anyone read those things?
- I tried to warn you, sir.

1288
01:13:31,326 --> 01:13:34,481
Kids, I'm sorry but now that
Agent P's cover has been blown,

1289
01:13:34,522 --> 01:13:36,400
you won't be allowed
to see him any more.

1290
01:13:36,483 --> 01:13:38,527
That's why you didn't want us
to know your secret.

1291
01:13:39,528 --> 01:13:42,573
So we'll never see Perry again?
There has to be another way.

1292
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:45,242
Sorry, Phineas. It isn't safe.
You know too much.

1293
01:13:45,409 --> 01:13:48,496
Now I never wished so much
that I could unknow something.

1294
01:13:48,705 --> 01:13:50,123
Sir, maybe there is a way.

1295
01:13:50,164 --> 01:13:53,084
What about
Dr Doofenshmirtz's Amnesianator?

1296
01:13:53,251 --> 01:13:55,676
I never built an Amnesianator.

1297
01:13:55,712 --> 01:13:57,589
I think I'd remember
building something like that.

1298
01:13:57,714 --> 01:14:00,968
Well, that might work.
But you'd all have to agree.

1299
01:14:01,176 --> 01:14:04,889
So our choice is to either
forget the best day ever,

1300
01:14:04,972 --> 01:14:07,016
forget the biggest adventure
we've ever had,

1301
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,851
and forget meeting Agent P,

1302
01:14:08,893 --> 01:14:11,896
or remember today,
but never see Perry again?

1303
01:14:13,565 --> 01:14:17,152
Well, we've had a lot of great days.
But we only have one Perry.

1304
01:14:17,444 --> 01:14:18,487
Agreed.

1305
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:19,738
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1306
01:14:20,197 --> 01:14:22,700
All right, everybody.
Tall kids in the back.

1307
01:14:22,742 --> 01:14:24,201
Just need to do a little more
programming here

1308
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:25,912
and we'll be ready to roll.

1309
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:28,873
Hey, buddy, Ferb and I
just wanted to say our goodbyes.

1310
01:14:28,915 --> 01:14:30,875
You know, we thought
we'd finally met the real you

1311
01:14:30,912 --> 01:14:32,586
when we found out you were Agent P,

1312
01:14:32,878 --> 01:14:36,882
but the fact is, pet, secret agent,
they're both the real you.

1313
01:14:37,132 --> 01:14:41,637
You are now and always have been
a great pet and a great friend.

1314
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:43,723
We're gonna miss you, Agent P.

1315
01:14:45,141 --> 01:14:46,225
I love you, pal.

1316
01:14:46,434 --> 01:14:47,936
Sir, are you crying?

1317
01:14:48,019 --> 01:14:49,896
No, I'm sweating through my eyes.

1318
01:14:50,063 --> 01:14:51,606
Okay, sir. We're ready.

1319
01:14:52,315 --> 01:14:54,025
Okay, Karl. We're set.

1320
01:14:55,903 --> 01:14:58,238
- Major Monogram?
- Yes?

1321
01:14:58,364 --> 01:15:00,491
So none of us will remember
any of today?

1322
01:15:00,783 --> 01:15:01,951
That's right.

1323
01:15:02,034 --> 01:15:03,202
Good!

1324
01:15:04,203 --> 01:15:05,455
Isabella!

1325
01:15:05,538 --> 01:15:07,332
- Hit it, Karl!
- Wait! Wait, wait!
