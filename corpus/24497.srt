1
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:33,921
No one knows the real story
of the great King Arthur of Camelot.

2
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:37,526
Most of what you think you know
about Camelot...

3
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:39,769
...Guinevere and Lancelot...

4
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:43,329
...and the evil sorceress
known as Morgaine Le Fey...

5
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:45,004
...is nothing but lies.

6
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:54,410
l should know, for l am Morgaine Le Fey...

7
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:57,043
...priestess of the lsle of Avalon...

8
00:00:57,132 --> 00:01:00,408
...where the ancient religion
of the Mother Goddess was born.

9
00:01:11,252 --> 00:01:13,812
lt began in the midst of
the most violent upheaval...

10
00:01:13,892 --> 00:01:15,564
...Britain has ever seen.

11
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:18,924
The Saxon barbarians
swept into my country...

12
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:22,163
...killing Christians and followers
of Avalon's goddess alike.

13
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:59,011
Unless one great leader
could unite Christians...

14
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:01,083
...and followers of the old religion...

15
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,728
...Britain was doomed to barbarism...

16
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:06,043
...and Avalon would vanish.

17
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:10,208
My Christian father, Gorlois...

18
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:13,045
...battled tirelessly
against the Saxon hordes.

19
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:15,851
For Christ! For Britain!

20
00:02:20,452 --> 00:02:24,365
Back home in Cornwall,
l was only a child at the time...

21
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:30,240
...but l knew my mother, lgraine,
was still a follower of the old religion...

22
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:32,527
...and secretly practiced its ancient magic.

23
00:02:34,452 --> 00:02:36,522
Her sister, my Aunt Morgause...

24
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:39,844
...had lived with us
for as long as l can remember.

25
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:42,322
She relished the power of Avalon.

26
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:45,408
Mother?

27
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:48,843
Mother, what's the matter?

28
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:56,002
Let her have her vision, lamb.

29
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:58,603
l want to know what the Sight brings her.

30
00:02:58,692 --> 00:02:59,602
She's afraid.

31
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:01,091
Let her have her vision.

32
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:03,242
Father will be angry if she uses the Sight.

33
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:05,482
Then he won't hear about it, will he?

34
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:07,767
What is it?

35
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:09,161
lgraine...

36
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:10,931
...what do you see?

37
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:13,411
Anything for me?

38
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,120
A lover? A husband?

39
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:23,248
The Lady of the Lake is coming...

40
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:25,682
...and the Merlin of Britain with her.

41
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:27,720
We must make ready.

42
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:29,647
What do they want?

43
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:33,005
You can ask them yourself. They're here.

44
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:48,043
And so Viviane came to Cornwall.

45
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:50,608
The eldest of the three sisters...

46
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,002
...Viviane was the High Priestess
of Avalon...

47
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:56,250
...and the voice
of the Mother Goddess on earth.

48
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:58,488
She had just one goal...

49
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,608
...to save Avalon from the Saxons.

50
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:04,804
Sister, we have to bring
this fighting to an end.

51
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:07,207
The Saxons will destroy this land.

52
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:08,765
Unless we prevent it.

53
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,128
How?

54
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:13,563
By giving this land a leader
to whom both followers of Christ...

55
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:15,608
...and the Goddess can give allegiance.

56
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,240
Someone with the blood of Avalon
in his veins.

57
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:20,848
The High King could still father a child.

58
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:22,923
But he'll be dead within six months.

59
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,730
Viviane has foreseen it.

60
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:26,683
He'll die without leaving an heir.

61
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:30,325
You mean my husband
will become High King in his place?

62
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:32,842
That l will bear this leader
that you speak of?.

63
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:36,686
You will bear the king, lgraine. Yes.

64
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:39,164
But not to Gorlois.

65
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:44,048
You will bear the child
to the man who wears this sign.

66
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:53,246
He is a follower of the Goddess,
and he will be king.

67
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:57,328
l'm married to the Duke of Cornwall.
l've borne him a child.

68
00:04:57,652 --> 00:04:59,961
l will not betray him. l gave him my vows.

69
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:02,122
You gave them first to Avalon.

70
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:05,366
lf you want this child
to be born of Avalon...

71
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:08,364
...then you can bear
this great new king yourself.

72
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:10,968
There is no need, Viviane.

73
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,050
Let me bear the child.

74
00:05:14,332 --> 00:05:15,970
l have no husband to betray.

75
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:17,565
Let me bear the king.

76
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:19,404
Have you no shame, Morgause?

77
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:20,528
Leave us.

78
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:24,010
l have as much Avalon
in my veins as she does!

79
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:27,042
Let me make this man fall in love with me.

80
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:29,131
l know the arts as well.

81
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:32,085
No man or woman
can live another's fate, Morgause.

82
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,762
You have a king in your future, and sons.

83
00:05:34,852 --> 00:05:35,568
Who?

84
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:37,210
You'll know when you see him.

85
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,691
Be content with that.

86
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:42,370
You must remember, Duchess...

87
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:44,761
...that Viviane is not just your sister.

88
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:46,888
She is the High Priestess of the faith...

89
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:49,850
...to which you have promised
your very breath.

90
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:51,884
The violence can end.

91
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,090
The choice is yours.

92
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:55,442
But my word--

93
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:58,922
Sometimes we have to sacrifice
small virtues to achieve great ones.

94
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,289
This year's harvest is tilled
with the blood of your own men.

95
00:06:09,612 --> 00:06:10,761
Morgaine!

96
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:12,281
What happened?

97
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,487
What is it, child?

98
00:06:13,892 --> 00:06:15,120
A dead man.

99
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:18,846
Tell me, child.

100
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:21,561
Do you often see things others don't?

101
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:24,525
Yes. All the time.

102
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:29,845
She has the Sight already.

103
00:06:33,252 --> 00:06:34,401
Three months later...

104
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:36,847
...the High King summoned
all the great chiefs...

105
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:39,082
...to London to name his successor.

106
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:42,290
And he invited my mother
as an honored guest.

107
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:45,245
But the Saxons will never forget
the blows you dealt them.

108
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:48,369
You and l, Gorlois.
We dealt them together.

109
00:06:48,892 --> 00:06:51,531
But l think l shall be fighting
no more Saxons.

110
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,046
Of course you will. lt'll be many years--

111
00:06:54,132 --> 00:06:56,248
That is why l have called this council.

112
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:58,171
lt's why you're here.

113
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,690
l must tell you, lgraine...

114
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:04,729
...my priests don't like it
that your priestess of Avalon...

115
00:07:04,812 --> 00:07:07,690
...has been placed
on an equal footing with them.

116
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:12,281
But l say that you both serve
the Great One above us...

117
00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:14,290
...by whatever the name.

118
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:17,243
And women are, after all...

119
00:07:17,492 --> 00:07:19,562
...the carriers of original sin.

120
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:23,521
That's not quite how we advance it, sir.

121
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:25,247
Do you not say...

122
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:28,881
...that women are the means
by which evil came into the world?

123
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:33,006
There is, in your Bible,
a fantastic tale about an apple and a snake.

124
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:37,009
The Bible merely recounts the truth,
good lady.

125
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:40,046
The old religion embraces yours, Bishop...

126
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:43,165
...but your priests
deny the power of Avalon.

127
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:45,528
Perhaps people no longer believe in it.

128
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:48,568
Perhaps it's because you tell them not to.

129
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:52,723
-lgraine!
-Your wife speaks her mind, Gorlois.

130
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:55,724
l honor her for that.

131
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:08,406
Back, you hounds from hell! Back!

132
00:08:15,252 --> 00:08:16,446
My lord, forgive me.

133
00:08:16,532 --> 00:08:19,490
You are forgiven,
but get those dogs out of here!

134
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:21,847
Can't you go anywhere without them?

135
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:36,406
Allow me to introduce you,
Uther Pendragon...

136
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:37,720
...to my wife...

137
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:40,162
...the Lady lgraine, Duchess of Cornwall.

138
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,482
And sister to the Lady of Avalon.

139
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,326
lt's an honor to meet a daughter
of the Holy lsle.

140
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:57,725
You will bear the child...

141
00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:00,643
...to the man who wears this sign.

142
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:09,481
Excuse me, my lord.

143
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:34,128
Viviane.

144
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,000
Why are you doing this to me?

145
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:39,130
Now, listen to me.

146
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:44,283
What l am about to say
will be of great importance to you all.

147
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:10,206
Did l do something to disturb you, lady?

148
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:12,806
l felt unwell, sir.

149
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:17,725
You left the moment
you saw the dragon on my wrist.

150
00:10:19,612 --> 00:10:21,125
l have no fear of dragons.

151
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:23,887
l'm a child of the old world myself, sir.

152
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,565
Why do you call me ''sir''
in such a manner...

153
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:33,687
...when you know
that we are on familiar terms?

154
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:36,605
We have not met before.

155
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:38,491
Not in this life...

156
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:41,368
...but like all of us of the old ways...

157
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:45,442
...you must believe this is not the only life
where we could have met.

158
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:51,162
There is something
between our souls already.

159
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:54,489
You felt the power of it...

160
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,369
...and that's why you left the hall.

161
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,161
Am l right, lady?

162
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:04,640
lf l am, could you rightfully resist it?

163
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:10,364
l am the sworn wife of Gorlois,
and so l will remain.

164
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:13,051
So you know what l felt.

165
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:17,647
Come away with me.

166
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:20,162
Please, get back to the council.

167
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:23,287
There's nothing to do but give in to it.

168
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:29,810
lf you do not come with me,
then l will come for you...

169
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,722
...before the moon is full again.

170
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,440
My lord...

171
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,963
...is the council finished?

172
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,201
lt is.

173
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:50,126
Let's get back to the proceedings then,
shall we?

174
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:54,050
Don't you want to ask the leave
of your new High King, lady?

175
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:56,684
-You?
-No.

176
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:01,330
Ambrosius has named Uther Pendragon
his successor.

177
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:11,242
Don't envy me, Gorlois.

178
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:13,725
The lady belongs to you.

179
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:24,329
You should take care to avoid gossip.

180
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:28,207
No chaste woman is safe
with Uther Pendragon.

181
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,604
People may gossip if they like.
lt doesn't concern me.

182
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,091
lt concerns me!

183
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:36,689
Are you questioning my honor?

184
00:12:36,772 --> 00:12:38,683
l'm questioning your judgment.

185
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:41,605
Well, if your judgment
is no better than that...

186
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:44,047
...then your word will cease
to concern me as well.

187
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:47,169
How dare you play the shrew with me!
l told you to avoid him!

188
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:48,685
-l'll teach you!
-Think...

189
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:51,280
...before you strike me, Gorlois...

190
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:56,322
...or l will teach you that a daughter
of the Holy lsle is the servant of no man.

191
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:02,603
And so, my father was caught up
in Viviane's plots.

192
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:22,007
Sire!

193
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:25,246
A messenger for the High King.
He waits at the gate.

194
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:27,404
He will speak with--

195
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:31,966
l have come, my lord--

196
00:13:32,052 --> 00:13:34,441
To ask for my troops
to aide the Pendragon.

197
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:36,205
lt is the High King's bidding.

198
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:38,727
l need my men here in Cornwall.

199
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:40,843
The Saxons are massing off our coast.

200
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:43,640
The king believes it's just a feint, Gorlois.

201
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:46,690
He's ordered all his war dukes
to assemble on the south coast.

202
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:49,445
Uther Pendragon can't know
the mind of the Saxons.

203
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:53,161
-l must keep the safety of my land.
-Sir.

204
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,729
This is not a request.
lt's an order from your king.

205
00:13:56,972 --> 00:13:59,566
He's asked you to bring your army
to him straight away.

206
00:13:59,652 --> 00:14:01,722
l am the Duke of Cornwall, Captain.

207
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:03,291
Uther Pendragon is not.

208
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:05,840
But as his Duke,
you've sworn your army to him.

209
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:08,367
Are you going to betray him
at the first test?

210
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:10,761
Watch what you say, Captain.

211
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,248
When l've seen off this Saxon threat,
then l'll consider...

212
00:14:14,612 --> 00:14:17,843
...whether l'll be able to help
the Pendragon in his schemes.

213
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:20,048
lf you refuse the High King now...

214
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:22,330
...he will become your enemy.

215
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:27,170
lf Uther Pendragon thinks
he can fight the Saxons...

216
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,490
...and then fight me after...

217
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:31,007
...let him try!

218
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:36,451
l was too young then...

219
00:14:36,692 --> 00:14:40,401
...to understand why my father
hated the High King so much.

220
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:44,491
But the moment he rode out
to hold the Saxons at bay at Cameldun...

221
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,361
...the magic of Avalon began to work.

222
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,001
Sister?

223
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:54,005
Sister, hear me.

224
00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:06,121
Viviane!

225
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:07,568
lgraine...

226
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,569
...you must listen if you want
to see Uther alive again.

227
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,970
l will not see him.
l will not betray my husband.

228
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:17,322
Then the man you love will die tonight.

229
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:19,923
l do not love Uther!

230
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:24,364
Sister, listen,
because there isn't much time.

231
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:28,524
Gorlois is planning
to surprise Uther while he sleeps.

232
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:30,890
You must warn him.

233
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:33,482
Save him, and save Avalon.

234
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:37,846
But like all of us of the old ways...

235
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:42,244
...you must believe that this is not
the only life where we could have met.

236
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:50,285
There's something
between our souls already.

237
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:04,730
Now my mother could see
how she could save Uther's life...

238
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:08,880
...but she did not see the terrible price
we would all have to pay.

239
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:09,648
There he is,
sleeping away his last night on earth.

240
00:17:10,452 --> 00:17:12,841
l want Uther deep in his dreams...

241
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,400
...when l drive my sword in his chest.

242
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:19,447
Uther!

243
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:25,405
What was that?

244
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:36,289
There's magic at work. l can feel it!

245
00:17:50,132 --> 00:17:51,087
Uther?

246
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:55,801
Gorlois is not at Cameldun.

247
00:17:57,172 --> 00:17:59,402
His men are in the hills above your camp.

248
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:03,090
Save yourselves.

249
00:18:06,572 --> 00:18:07,721
Save yourselves.

250
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:09,927
lgraine?

251
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:19,127
Sir, are you not well?

252
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:25,809
Let's prepare, Captain...

253
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:28,083
...to show how we best welcome a traitor.

254
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:05,971
Uther!

255
00:20:18,612 --> 00:20:20,648
We can stop this now, Gorlois.

256
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:21,921
lt's up to you!

257
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:37,491
Mother, where are you?

258
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:39,322
Mother?

259
00:20:44,372 --> 00:20:46,010
-She'll be all right.
-lgraine!

260
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:48,043
There are herbs that will cure her.

261
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:49,485
Let's get her into bed.

262
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:06,400
Open the gate!

263
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:07,641
The Duchess is ill.

264
00:21:07,732 --> 00:21:09,882
-We have to find the herbs!
-Open the gate.

265
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,849
We have orders not to, my lady.

266
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:12,603
What?

267
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:16,082
Neither you, nor Lady lgraine
can leave the castle in the Duke's absence.

268
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:17,366
My mother is dying.

269
00:21:17,452 --> 00:21:19,727
l'm sorry. l have my orders.

270
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:32,168
-Be careful, Morgaine.
-All right.

271
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:35,882
lt's over there, by the trees.

272
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:59,207
See Morgaine there? Fetch her.

273
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:10,091
Come along, Morgaine.

274
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:12,811
Would you fly in the face
of your father's authority?

275
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:15,846
The herbs are for my mother. She's dying.

276
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:17,725
Captain! That's enough.

277
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,611
Now let me pass.

278
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:24,647
Not you, Merlin, nor any man.

279
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:26,923
Not even your Lord Gorlois.

280
00:22:32,492 --> 00:22:35,325
Sir, l recognize your armor.

281
00:22:36,412 --> 00:22:39,290
But, sir, l must do as you commanded me.

282
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:41,164
l must ask to see your face.

283
00:22:43,732 --> 00:22:45,450
Show him your face, Gorlois.

284
00:22:59,852 --> 00:23:01,171
Let my daughter go.

285
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:02,967
Father!

286
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:09,762
l was overjoyed that my father
had come safely back to us...

287
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,570
...but then l saw the dragon...

288
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,964
...and l began to understand.

289
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,091
What are you doing here?

290
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:35,129
l'm waiting for my father.

291
00:23:36,052 --> 00:23:38,247
He's upstairs, with your mother.

292
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:39,851
My father is dead.

293
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:43,130
Well, if your father is dead...

294
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:46,049
...then who would that be upstairs?

295
00:23:46,652 --> 00:23:48,290
The man with the dragon.

296
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,570
The man of the prophesy.

297
00:24:03,372 --> 00:24:05,090
You be wary of Viviane, child.

298
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:08,243
She'll catch you in her web...

299
00:24:08,332 --> 00:24:11,722
...like a little fly,
just as she's tried to do to the rest of us.

300
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:14,010
She won't have me, though.

301
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:17,122
l've learned how to keep
a step ahead of her.

302
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:46,251
This is witchcraft.

303
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,450
He challenged the High King.

304
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:58,281
lt was not Uther's wish to kill him.

305
00:24:58,532 --> 00:24:59,726
He had no choice.

306
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,929
What went through my mother's mind...

307
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,891
...as she saw her husband lying dead
at the hand of Uther Pendragon?

308
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:25,611
None of this mattered...

309
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,569
...to my Aunt Morgause...

310
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:29,563
...because in King Lot of Orkney...

311
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:32,406
...she saw at last, her own path to power.

312
00:25:35,892 --> 00:25:39,202
For the first time,
l saw Uther Pendragon face to face...

313
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:42,211
...and began to understand
the power of Avalon.

314
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:45,725
Britain's greatest Christian warrior
was dead.

315
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:48,930
King Uther alone
would turn back the Saxon hordes...

316
00:25:49,252 --> 00:25:52,961
...and Avalon would be saved
by one who believed in the Goddess.

317
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:59,040
Uther took us to his castle at Camelot...

318
00:25:59,132 --> 00:26:01,487
...and made my mother his High Queen.

319
00:26:57,452 --> 00:27:00,728
All the unhappiness of the past
seemed to be swept away...

320
00:27:01,172 --> 00:27:04,323
...when l saw my little brother, Arthur,
for the first time.

321
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:14,448
Help me.

322
00:27:18,732 --> 00:27:21,007
Arthur! Morgaine!

323
00:28:00,732 --> 00:28:02,370
What are they doing?

324
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:05,286
They're praying to the Goddess
for a good harvest.

325
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:08,290
The Goddess?
The one Father Cuthbert doesn't like?

326
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:18,570
And now she'll look after their seeds,
and make them grow...

327
00:28:18,652 --> 00:28:20,210
...all through spring.

328
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:22,852
So these people don't like Jesus Christ?

329
00:28:23,372 --> 00:28:25,010
Some of them do.

330
00:28:25,092 --> 00:28:26,969
But others still pray to the Goddess.

331
00:28:28,012 --> 00:28:30,526
Can there be a God and a Goddess
at the same time?

332
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:35,083
Of course. lt's just like
having a father and a mother.

333
00:28:42,772 --> 00:28:45,605
lt was a time of happiness for me
and my little brother.

334
00:28:46,412 --> 00:28:48,562
And it seemed my new father...

335
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:52,123
...King Uther,
would keep the Saxons at bay forever.

336
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:02,171
Then one day l heard a familiar voice
down in the royal chamber...

337
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,490
...and l knew that everything
was about to change again.

338
00:29:07,052 --> 00:29:08,849
You shall now teach your son.

339
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:10,206
But he's still a boy.

340
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:13,165
Arthur must be fostered
to protect his future destiny...

341
00:29:13,332 --> 00:29:15,288
...and to protect him from his enemies.

342
00:29:15,612 --> 00:29:17,762
lt was an agreement
you made a long time ago.

343
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:21,401
And with this...

344
00:29:21,572 --> 00:29:24,644
...you must give me Morgaine
to foster in Avalon.

345
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:27,482
Never.

346
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:28,960
She has the Sight.

347
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:33,004
She was born with it.
She can never escape the Unseen.

348
00:29:33,172 --> 00:29:35,049
l'd rather raise her as a Christian woman.

349
00:29:35,132 --> 00:29:35,882
No!

350
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:39,243
At worst, no harm could come to her
behind convent walls.

351
00:29:39,412 --> 00:29:41,289
The girl was born to be a priestess.

352
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:44,008
She must be properly trained to her gifts.

353
00:29:44,252 --> 00:29:45,571
Enough of this, woman!

354
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:48,248
You're in my land now, where l'm king.

355
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:49,681
You are king.

356
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:52,811
But who put you there?

357
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:55,326
How long do you think
you'll hold on to the throne...

358
00:29:55,412 --> 00:29:57,243
...if Avalon withdraws its support?

359
00:29:57,332 --> 00:30:00,404
You'd bring ruin to your own sister
in order to have your way?

360
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:04,127
l'd do anything to see that
Arthur and Morgaine fulfill their destinies.

361
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:09,404
You can't take both my children
from me at the same time.

362
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,770
Your children will be safe and happy...

363
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:15,448
...each growing toward their own fate.

364
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,802
You must learn to be content with that...

365
00:30:18,332 --> 00:30:19,890
...and with each other.

366
00:30:22,852 --> 00:30:25,685
You will always be in my heart, always.

367
00:30:26,932 --> 00:30:28,490
Goodbye, Mother.

368
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,481
Father.

369
00:31:04,852 --> 00:31:06,843
-What are you doing?
-Mother?

370
00:31:07,692 --> 00:31:09,887
-Where are you taking him?
-You must understand.

371
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:13,282
You each have training to undergo.
lt must happen in different places.

372
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,283
No! You can't take my brother
away from me!

373
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:16,725
Don't leave me, Morgaine!

374
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:17,927
Arthur!

375
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:23,049
Don't take him away from me, please!
l'll do anything you ask!

376
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,804
l'll be good! l promise!

377
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:26,450
We all make sacrifices.

378
00:31:26,532 --> 00:31:30,081
What we want and what's right
are sometimes different things.

379
00:31:33,732 --> 00:31:36,246
You must give him your strength, child.

380
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:44,164
We'll be strong, Arthur, won't we?

381
00:31:48,252 --> 00:31:49,970
That game we play:

382
00:31:50,052 --> 00:31:53,010
At night, if you get scared,
you can call to me...

383
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:57,889
...and if you hold your breath
and listen hard enough in the dark...

384
00:31:57,972 --> 00:32:00,247
...you'll hear me whisper back to you.

385
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:11,723
l'll never leave your side.

386
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:17,563
-Goodbye.
-'Bye.

387
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:23,805
Come, Morgaine.

388
00:32:26,172 --> 00:32:28,208
Leaving my parents was hard...

389
00:32:28,452 --> 00:32:31,603
...but leaving my little brother
was almost more than l could bear.

390
00:32:33,372 --> 00:32:37,411
Still, on that day we parted,
one north, one south...

391
00:32:38,052 --> 00:32:40,361
...riding towards our separate fates.

392
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:04,689
The Goddess is everything in nature...

393
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,081
...and everything in nature is sacred.

394
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:12,564
Look. That is her face.

395
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:15,888
Listen.

396
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:19,691
That is her voice.

397
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:23,927
She's in everything that is beautiful.

398
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:26,927
And everything that is harrowing as well.

399
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:32,367
The guardians of Avalon
appeared silently on the hilltops...

400
00:33:32,452 --> 00:33:35,967
...as we came nearer the lake
that enclosed the mysterious island.

401
00:33:45,252 --> 00:33:49,040
When we reached the edge of the lake
and looked out into the mist...

402
00:33:49,132 --> 00:33:53,523
...l couldn't believe that behind it
lay all the wonders that l'd dreamt about.

403
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:55,240
Where are we?

404
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:57,169
On the borders of Avalon.

405
00:33:57,812 --> 00:33:59,768
This is Avalon?

406
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:53,688
As we moved closer to the mists,
a chill crept across my heart.

407
00:34:54,132 --> 00:34:56,600
lfl passed through that curtain...

408
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:59,809
...would l ever be able to return
to my little brother Arthur?

409
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,125
ls that Avalon?

410
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:10,168
lt looks like a Christian monastery.

411
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:11,401
lt does.

412
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:14,131
But Avalon is beneath it, behind it...

413
00:35:14,972 --> 00:35:16,371
...deeper in the mist.

414
00:35:17,412 --> 00:35:20,370
lt was there long before the Christians
built their monastery.

415
00:36:06,452 --> 00:36:08,124
How beautiful!

416
00:36:09,692 --> 00:36:11,011
Beautiful, yes.

417
00:36:11,892 --> 00:36:15,851
But unless we succeed in our quest,
it's also doomed.

418
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:32,806
l finally arrived and was about to enter
the great sisterhood of the Goddess.

419
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:27,045
What is your name?

420
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:30,201
Her name is Raven.

421
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:33,126
She's taken a vow of silence
to the Goddess.

422
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:37,328
But silence, l think, is not for you.

423
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:40,525
You have your own challenges to meet.

424
00:37:43,132 --> 00:37:43,848
Come.

425
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:51,722
The Goddess holds all things in balance:

426
00:37:52,532 --> 00:37:57,003
Good and evil, death and rebirth.

427
00:37:57,612 --> 00:38:00,763
The predator and the prey.

428
00:38:01,652 --> 00:38:05,088
Without her,
destruction and chaos will prevail.

429
00:38:07,612 --> 00:38:11,207
And so began my initiation
into the secrets of Avalon.

430
00:38:11,652 --> 00:38:15,884
A path that would lead me to become
a priestess of the ancient religion.

431
00:38:16,412 --> 00:38:19,609
Gradually, l began to look on
the Mother Goddess as my own mother...

432
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,166
...and as the mother of the earth itself.

433
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:41,649
But there was more to being a priestess
than acquiring knowledge.

434
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:46,371
There was also the task
of acquiring power over every element...

435
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:48,371
...one by one.

436
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:06,806
How did you do that?

437
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,763
Show me, Viviane. l want to learn.

438
00:39:32,652 --> 00:39:33,846
Morgaine!

439
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:51,081
Morgaine, you have to concentrate.

440
00:39:53,772 --> 00:39:55,171
But l saw my brother.

441
00:39:55,572 --> 00:39:58,484
You must learn to distinguish
visions from reality.

442
00:39:59,532 --> 00:40:02,126
This time, keep your mind in one place.

443
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:35,931
lt would take years...

444
00:40:36,052 --> 00:40:39,886
...until l was deemed ready
for the greatest test of all:

445
00:40:40,052 --> 00:40:43,044
To part the mists of Avalon.

446
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:23,604
And at last,
l was fit to be given the sacred mark...

447
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:26,810
...that only those dedicated
to the Goddess may wear.

448
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:44,766
Welcome to the service of the Goddess.

449
00:41:49,852 --> 00:41:51,251
She's been taken.

450
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:06,764
As a priestess of Avalon...

451
00:42:06,852 --> 00:42:10,003
...l was bidden one day
to open the mists for a visitor.

452
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:14,411
l was certain that my longing
for my brother would finally be over.

453
00:42:14,652 --> 00:42:15,607
Arthur?

454
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:32,130
Not Arthur, lady. But his cousin.

455
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:34,482
Your cousin, l think, if you're Morgaine.

456
00:42:34,572 --> 00:42:37,006
My cousin? By whom?

457
00:42:37,252 --> 00:42:39,004
Your mentor, the Lady of the Lake.

458
00:42:40,572 --> 00:42:42,563
-Then you must be--
-Lancelot.

459
00:42:44,372 --> 00:42:47,250
You can embrace me if you like.
We are family after all.

460
00:42:49,492 --> 00:42:50,208
Come.

461
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:53,250
Lancelot had not come
for the pleasure ofseeing his relatives.

462
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,365
He had come
to confront his mother, Viviane.

463
00:42:56,612 --> 00:42:58,682
Even you can't want me to stay in Avalon...

464
00:42:58,772 --> 00:43:00,922
...while the Saxons destroy the real world.

465
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,650
Then Avalon's not real for you?

466
00:43:03,252 --> 00:43:04,526
Not as real as battle.

467
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:09,082
You always say
we mustn't deny our nature.

468
00:43:09,492 --> 00:43:11,881
Well, it's my nature
to fight at the front lines.

469
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:14,162
lf you stayed here to gather our wisdom...

470
00:43:14,452 --> 00:43:17,649
...you could lead the struggle,
rather than being caught up in it.

471
00:43:19,452 --> 00:43:21,761
l have come here for your blessing.

472
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,524
l'd be glad to have it.

473
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:26,211
l'm asking for it, lady...

474
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:29,489
...but in truth, l will set my course
with or without your blessing.

475
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:33,406
l've lived in a world where men do not wait
on a woman's bidding to come and go.

476
00:43:33,492 --> 00:43:35,244
How dare you speak to me like that?

477
00:43:35,372 --> 00:43:36,441
Mother, please.

478
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:38,523
Don't think you can soften me on this.

479
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:41,641
Mother, l don't expect
to soften you on anything.

480
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:44,568
Go up to the stone circle, both of you.

481
00:43:45,052 --> 00:43:48,647
lf you must say your farewells to Avalon,
l insist you make them from there.

482
00:43:48,972 --> 00:43:49,961
Why, Mother?

483
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:53,489
You wish me to approve of your decision?
Then do as l ask.

484
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:40,010
l think you spend
too much time riding horses.

485
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:42,561
Well, this is it.

486
00:44:43,532 --> 00:44:45,841
This is what your mother
wanted me to show you.

487
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:47,441
Nonsense.

488
00:44:47,972 --> 00:44:49,610
You must know my mother by now.

489
00:44:51,852 --> 00:44:55,606
She wanted us to feel the power
of the Ring together, so l would--

490
00:44:55,732 --> 00:44:57,643
So you might decide to stay.

491
00:44:58,772 --> 00:45:00,569
She's full of strategy, my mother.

492
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:02,525
l think you may be right.

493
00:45:04,012 --> 00:45:05,331
l do feel it, though.

494
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:08,247
The Ring.

495
00:45:10,892 --> 00:45:12,803
l can feel it flowing through me.

496
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:19,570
l felt it as a child, but now it's different.

497
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,846
Do you feel it?

498
00:45:23,772 --> 00:45:27,651
Of course. l am of the same blood as you.

499
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:35,883
Look.

500
00:45:40,212 --> 00:45:43,204
The Christians. Can they see us?

501
00:45:43,932 --> 00:45:46,844
No. They're in Glastonbury.
We're in Avalon.

502
00:45:47,372 --> 00:45:49,328
They can't even see the stones.

503
00:45:56,012 --> 00:45:58,367
-Are you sure they can't see us?
-Yes.

504
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:02,811
She senses something.

505
00:46:09,852 --> 00:46:12,286
You can part the veil between worlds.
Do it!

506
00:46:12,412 --> 00:46:14,801
No, l will not use the arts for play.

507
00:46:15,212 --> 00:46:16,565
This is not play.

508
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:19,602
Or is it because you can't do it, Cousin?

509
00:46:35,052 --> 00:46:36,531
Where did you come from?

510
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:38,171
Don't be frightened.

511
00:46:38,492 --> 00:46:40,084
We haven't come from anywhere.

512
00:46:40,532 --> 00:46:42,250
You have. You're in Avalon.

513
00:46:43,812 --> 00:46:45,564
One of the fairy people.

514
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,570
Keep her away from me.

515
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:50,446
She's not a fairy.

516
00:46:51,012 --> 00:46:52,445
She's as mortal as you are.

517
00:46:55,972 --> 00:46:57,371
l'm Lancelot...

518
00:46:57,612 --> 00:46:59,603
...and this is my cousin, Morgaine.

519
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:02,287
Who are you?

520
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:07,482
Guinevere. Daughter of King Loedekrantz.

521
00:47:10,372 --> 00:47:11,805
l must be dreaming.

522
00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:14,122
This can't be Avalon. Avalon doesn't exist.

523
00:47:14,452 --> 00:47:15,805
lt does.

524
00:47:18,612 --> 00:47:20,762
Where does it lead, that path?

525
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,447
Down to the lawns and the groves.

526
00:47:25,052 --> 00:47:27,566
Each place is more beautiful than the last.

527
00:47:32,212 --> 00:47:33,804
May l stay a while?

528
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:35,964
Will you show them to me?

529
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:39,567
Of course.

530
00:47:40,452 --> 00:47:42,283
You may stay as long as you like.

531
00:47:50,532 --> 00:47:52,045
Can you hear me?

532
00:47:53,212 --> 00:47:54,440
Where did you go?

533
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:57,162
Lancelot?

534
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,969
She's trained you well, your mentor.

535
00:48:17,972 --> 00:48:19,564
What do you mean by that?

536
00:48:20,652 --> 00:48:24,691
For a moment there, when l looked at you,
it was just like looking at my mother.

537
00:48:29,372 --> 00:48:32,409
l know she's waiting.
l shall go and give her my decision now.

538
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:34,809
And what have you decided, Cousin?

539
00:48:35,572 --> 00:48:37,608
l have the power to lead men in battle.

540
00:48:39,172 --> 00:48:40,685
That's what l intend to do.

541
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:44,328
As Lancelot announced his decision...

542
00:48:45,252 --> 00:48:49,211
...deep within me there stirred something
l had felt for no man before.

543
00:48:50,652 --> 00:48:53,450
Within days, on the orders of Viviane...

544
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:57,048
...l was on my way to take part
in the fertility rites known...

545
00:48:57,172 --> 00:48:58,730
...as the Beltane feast...

546
00:48:59,372 --> 00:49:02,444
...the ceremony she called
''the great marriage. ''

547
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:06,132
To whom l would be given, l did not know.

548
00:49:06,412 --> 00:49:10,007
But Viviane assured me
that the future of Avalon...

549
00:49:10,132 --> 00:49:13,602
...depended on my playing the role
of the virgin huntress...

550
00:49:14,612 --> 00:49:18,400
...and that my partner would be the man
who killed the king stag.

551
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:27,729
As l returned to the Holy lsle,
a great longing gripped my heart:

552
00:53:28,692 --> 00:53:32,765
l hoped that the man
at the Beltane rites had been Lancelot.

553
00:53:34,132 --> 00:53:36,487
But l had never seen his face.

554
00:53:36,572 --> 00:53:39,405
There had been no hint
as to who he really was.

555
00:53:45,252 --> 00:53:48,050
Who was she? When can l see her again?

556
00:53:48,332 --> 00:53:50,846
You were only meant to know her
for one night, Arthur.

557
00:53:51,332 --> 00:53:52,685
Well, you can conjure.

558
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:55,002
At least show me her face.
l never saw her face.

559
00:53:55,092 --> 00:53:57,970
You will never know the identity
of the virgin huntress.

560
00:53:58,532 --> 00:54:01,729
That knowledge is sacred
and you must let it be.

561
00:54:03,252 --> 00:54:08,246
Your training is over,
and you must return to the new world.

562
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:09,526
Why now?

563
00:54:10,452 --> 00:54:12,090
Because your father needs you.

564
00:54:17,652 --> 00:54:20,120
As Arthur rode in search
of his father that day...

565
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:23,572
...Uther Pendragon was facing
his greatest test.

566
00:54:24,212 --> 00:54:26,851
The Saxons had descended
on Britain again...

567
00:54:27,252 --> 00:54:28,526
...in force.

568
00:54:36,532 --> 00:54:37,487
Father!

569
00:55:06,292 --> 00:55:07,771
-Father!
-Arthur.

570
00:55:10,852 --> 00:55:13,764
You've come home
only in time to see me die.

571
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:15,645
You're not going to die!

572
00:55:15,852 --> 00:55:19,003
My boy, let's forget this world now...

573
00:55:19,732 --> 00:55:21,768
...and let's talk about the next.

574
00:55:23,012 --> 00:55:26,209
Come closer to me. l'm cold.

575
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:29,602
Come, my boy.

576
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:30,920
l'm here.

577
00:55:31,532 --> 00:55:34,251
And so ends the High Kingdom of Britain.

578
00:55:35,612 --> 00:55:38,524
lt is a great pity
you never had the chance to rule.

579
00:55:39,372 --> 00:55:41,886
l think you would have been a good king.

580
00:55:47,132 --> 00:55:48,360
Father!

581
00:56:14,452 --> 00:56:16,124
-Arthur!
-l know.

582
00:56:16,212 --> 00:56:17,565
There isn't any time.

583
00:56:25,572 --> 00:56:28,166
l call on the powers of heaven and earth:

584
00:56:28,532 --> 00:56:29,760
Aid me now!

585
00:56:30,892 --> 00:56:34,168
l call on the God of heaven
and the Goddess of the earth!

586
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:35,367
Help me now!

587
00:56:37,212 --> 00:56:39,328
You called on God and the Goddess.

588
00:56:39,892 --> 00:56:41,644
lt is the Goddess who answers.

589
00:56:44,052 --> 00:56:45,485
Listen, Arthur.

590
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:48,122
You are ready to be High King.

591
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:52,770
And this will be granted to you,
if you have the support of Avalon.

592
00:56:53,732 --> 00:56:55,484
Avalon will lift you up...

593
00:56:56,052 --> 00:56:58,361
...if you promise to obey the old ways...

594
00:56:58,452 --> 00:57:01,091
...and keep the Goddess alive
in men's hearts.

595
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:04,882
Swear it!

596
00:57:05,812 --> 00:57:06,767
l swear!

597
00:57:07,572 --> 00:57:09,403
Then look to the altar.

598
00:57:11,412 --> 00:57:12,527
lt is Excalibur...

599
00:57:13,852 --> 00:57:15,843
...the great sword of Avalon.

600
00:57:18,972 --> 00:57:21,167
You are blessed by the Goddess.

601
00:57:21,452 --> 00:57:23,408
You have the strength to draw it.

602
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:29,051
Take it, Arthur!

603
00:57:33,652 --> 00:57:35,085
Take it and rule.

604
00:57:37,012 --> 00:57:38,445
Take it, Arthur.

605
00:57:47,972 --> 00:57:49,291
Take it and rule.

606
00:57:55,812 --> 00:57:57,803
Arthur?

607
00:58:01,932 --> 00:58:03,251
Call to Excalibur!

608
00:58:08,412 --> 00:58:11,484
To me, men of Britain! To me!

609
00:58:16,732 --> 00:58:18,609
Arthur turned the tide ofbattle...

610
00:58:18,692 --> 00:58:21,570
...and the Saxons were thrown back
from our shores...

611
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:24,163
...for a time at least.

612
00:58:24,492 --> 00:58:27,484
As the day approached
for his coronation as High King...

613
00:58:27,812 --> 00:58:30,610
...all of Britain seemed to be gathering
at Camelot...

614
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:33,811
...to celebrate the beginning of a new era.

615
00:58:56,412 --> 00:58:59,563
Even King Lot of Orkney had come down
from his Scottish lslands...

616
00:59:00,212 --> 00:59:03,568
...with my Aunt Morgause
as his wife and queen.

617
00:59:04,012 --> 00:59:06,651
-My dear child.
-You can't call me that anymore.

618
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:09,283
Morgaine, Morgaine.

619
00:59:09,492 --> 00:59:11,642
-Mother, is this my cousin?
-lt is.

620
00:59:11,732 --> 00:59:14,121
This is Gawain, our firstborn.

621
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:18,002
lt's an honor to meet a priestess of Avalon.

622
00:59:18,132 --> 00:59:19,884
The pleasure is mine.

623
00:59:20,372 --> 00:59:22,932
l've heard many interesting things
about the place.

624
00:59:23,532 --> 00:59:26,604
They say you make yourselves tiny
and ride around on sparrows.

625
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:30,446
l think the fancy is more interesting
than the facts.

626
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:33,285
lt is good fortune
that you returned, Morgaine.

627
00:59:33,812 --> 00:59:36,451
Your mother will take great comfort
from your presence.

628
00:59:36,892 --> 00:59:37,961
Where is she?

629
00:59:43,452 --> 00:59:44,441
Mother?

630
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:00,285
l lost them all.

631
01:00:01,812 --> 01:00:04,201
All those years when you were a little girl.

632
01:00:05,652 --> 01:00:08,086
l should have been with you, not Viviane.

633
01:00:08,732 --> 01:00:10,927
l should never have allowed it.

634
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,923
Mother, you had no choice.

635
01:00:19,692 --> 01:00:22,809
He used to sit there,
where you are now, when he was at home.

636
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:28,291
You must not let this grief keep you
from celebrating Arthur's accession.

637
01:00:30,852 --> 01:00:32,080
Morgaine...

638
01:00:32,652 --> 01:00:35,530
...when Arthur is crowned,
l'm going to go to Glastonbury.

639
01:00:35,612 --> 01:00:37,648
Why don't you come to Avalon with me?

640
01:00:39,092 --> 01:00:40,764
l've given enough to Avalon.

641
01:00:41,492 --> 01:00:44,165
Your mother has many Christian friends.

642
01:00:44,692 --> 01:00:46,250
They will be good to her.

643
01:00:47,692 --> 01:00:49,603
You mean you'll be taking vows?

644
01:00:52,492 --> 01:00:56,121
l've buried two husbands.
l won't love again.

645
01:00:57,212 --> 01:00:58,964
And now Uther has gone.

646
01:00:59,372 --> 01:01:02,921
l need forgiveness
for what l did to your father...

647
01:01:05,732 --> 01:01:07,848
...and l'll only find that in Glastonbury.

648
01:01:14,612 --> 01:01:15,567
Remember...

649
01:01:16,732 --> 01:01:19,087
...the future of Camelot lies within you all.

650
01:01:37,332 --> 01:01:38,287
Watch them.

651
01:01:45,012 --> 01:01:46,491
Come on, watch the eyes.

652
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:52,323
Kay, keep that shield up.
Otherwise, Bedevere will have your neck.

653
01:02:10,332 --> 01:02:11,845
Here, my friend.

654
01:02:39,212 --> 01:02:42,488
And that's what happens when
you let the king teach you how to fight.

655
01:02:42,612 --> 01:02:43,601
Almost a king.

656
01:02:51,852 --> 01:02:53,251
Another bride for you.

657
01:02:53,892 --> 01:02:56,804
Come. You must meet her.
This one is special.

658
01:02:57,452 --> 01:02:59,204
The Bishop wants me to marry her.

659
01:03:00,172 --> 01:03:02,686
You are ever welcome at Camelot, miss.

660
01:03:02,772 --> 01:03:05,127
lt's an honor to attend so brave a warrior.

661
01:03:05,212 --> 01:03:06,645
Then you must meet another.

662
01:03:06,732 --> 01:03:08,688
This is my good friend, Lancelot.

663
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:14,563
Will you lift your veil?
You have an unfair advantage over us.

664
01:03:24,412 --> 01:03:25,527
Lancelot...

665
01:03:26,572 --> 01:03:28,369
...Guinevere of Loedekrantz.

666
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:34,486
Say something.

667
01:03:36,972 --> 01:03:38,564
l'm your servant, miss.

668
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:44,883
He is a man of few words, my lady,
but he is our finest soldier.

669
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:51,762
-Who's that?
-Who?

670
01:03:51,852 --> 01:03:53,410
Up there, on the balcony.

671
01:03:55,452 --> 01:03:58,285
Don't you recognize your own sister?
That's Morgaine.

672
01:03:59,012 --> 01:04:01,367
Come from Avalon to honor you tomorrow.

673
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,248
Excuse me, my lady,
l must greet my sister.

674
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:34,811
Where's my little brother?

675
01:04:37,812 --> 01:04:40,963
He's here. He's still here.

676
01:04:41,052 --> 01:04:42,485
Should we go and get the horses?

677
01:04:42,572 --> 01:04:45,291
No, a single horse,
and ride like we used to.

678
01:04:54,332 --> 01:04:55,924
The good times have returned.

679
01:04:56,652 --> 01:04:58,608
l hear you've met a hundred princesses.

680
01:04:58,972 --> 01:05:00,564
Come, l'll show you something.

681
01:05:00,812 --> 01:05:02,404
You see that girl down there?

682
01:05:05,492 --> 01:05:07,528
You must promise to tell no one.

683
01:05:08,812 --> 01:05:10,291
We're to be married.

684
01:05:10,812 --> 01:05:11,961
Do you love her?

685
01:05:13,212 --> 01:05:14,327
l will, Sister.

686
01:05:15,132 --> 01:05:16,929
There is someone else, isn't there?

687
01:05:18,012 --> 01:05:18,762
No.

688
01:05:18,972 --> 01:05:20,041
There is.

689
01:05:20,572 --> 01:05:22,642
You cannot fool a priestess of Avalon.

690
01:05:25,852 --> 01:05:29,128
There is. There has been someone else.

691
01:05:30,172 --> 01:05:31,810
lt was a wonderful night....

692
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:32,842
But?

693
01:05:33,252 --> 01:05:35,766
-Why do you press me so?
-A sister's privilege.

694
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,251
Tell me her name.

695
01:05:38,572 --> 01:05:39,641
l don't know.

696
01:05:40,412 --> 01:05:41,731
You didn't ask?

697
01:05:44,092 --> 01:05:45,207
We didn't speak.

698
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,410
Will you see her again?

699
01:05:48,732 --> 01:05:50,165
l want to, Sister.

700
01:05:50,692 --> 01:05:52,284
But l don't know where she is.

701
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:54,409
At least tell me what she looks like.

702
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:56,885
l don't know that either.

703
01:05:57,812 --> 01:05:59,370
How can you not know that?

704
01:06:00,932 --> 01:06:02,650
She was wearing a mask.

705
01:06:04,532 --> 01:06:06,170
lt was at the rites of Beltane.

706
01:06:07,012 --> 01:06:11,130
l was consecrated there. We made love.

707
01:06:12,252 --> 01:06:14,561
lt was everything l've ever dreamt of.

708
01:06:17,692 --> 01:06:19,091
l tell you, Sister...

709
01:06:19,932 --> 01:06:24,005
...something about that girl's eyes
will be watching me forever.

710
01:06:27,052 --> 01:06:28,087
Arthur!

711
01:06:31,252 --> 01:06:33,049
l must tend my duties.

712
01:06:34,772 --> 01:06:37,332
You will come down and join us,
won't you?

713
01:06:37,412 --> 01:06:39,289
You must meet my future bride.

714
01:07:05,972 --> 01:07:08,611
My Aunt Morgause used magic...

715
01:07:08,812 --> 01:07:11,485
...against a woman
she had decided to hate.

716
01:07:11,932 --> 01:07:13,365
By the fire...

717
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:16,211
...and the stone...

718
01:07:17,252 --> 01:07:18,605
...by the water...

719
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:21,891
...and the air...

720
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:24,803
...l curse you...

721
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,762
...Guinevere of Loedekrantz.

722
01:07:31,972 --> 01:07:34,167
l curse you forever!

723
01:08:43,892 --> 01:08:46,281
By Excalibur, l swear that l...

724
01:08:47,172 --> 01:08:49,402
...Arthur Pendragon, King of Britain...

725
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:53,847
...will deal fairly with Druid
as with Christian alike.

726
01:08:55,052 --> 01:08:57,691
All men shall worship as they choose.

727
01:08:58,892 --> 01:09:00,405
My hand for justice!

728
01:09:02,732 --> 01:09:03,926
One kingdom...

729
01:09:04,652 --> 01:09:07,769
...the old wisdom, and the new!

730
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:13,051
One kingdom united here, at Camelot,
to stand against the tides of barbarism.

731
01:09:22,852 --> 01:09:24,570
Brothers and sisters!

732
01:09:27,212 --> 01:09:31,330
We have not only one joy
to celebrate today, but two.

733
01:09:31,852 --> 01:09:33,490
Today, our king...

734
01:09:34,172 --> 01:09:35,844
...has pledged fidelity...

735
01:09:35,932 --> 01:09:37,331
...to Britain...

736
01:09:37,532 --> 01:09:38,965
...to Avalon...

737
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:40,691
...to the Holy Father.

738
01:09:41,332 --> 01:09:43,607
And he has promised to marry...

739
01:09:44,052 --> 01:09:47,124
...the Christian princess
Guinevere of Loedekrantz.

740
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,484
He has the people's passion.

741
01:09:59,172 --> 01:10:01,128
lf anyone can save Britain...

742
01:10:01,332 --> 01:10:02,367
...he can.

743
01:10:04,212 --> 01:10:06,601
He'll have to do it in his own lifetime.

744
01:10:09,532 --> 01:10:10,681
What have you done?

745
01:10:11,132 --> 01:10:13,851
No son of his will follow him to the throne.

746
01:10:15,132 --> 01:10:16,247
Ours will.

747
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:18,809
Long live King Arthur!

748
01:10:42,252 --> 01:10:43,810
Don't leave me, Morgaine!

749
01:11:05,452 --> 01:11:06,805
What is it, lamb?

750
01:11:07,452 --> 01:11:09,363
Was it the excitement in there?

751
01:11:10,172 --> 01:11:11,810
No, Morgause, it's not that.

752
01:11:12,452 --> 01:11:14,010
What is it then?

753
01:11:15,132 --> 01:11:16,531
l think l'm with child.

754
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,250
After the coronation...

755
01:11:38,332 --> 01:11:40,892
...Arthur rode off
to visit the border country...

756
01:11:41,292 --> 01:11:44,090
...leaving Guinevere in Lancelot's care.

757
01:11:44,172 --> 01:11:46,208
Arthur has a great mind for leadership.

758
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:48,522
l would've never let
the tribesmen fight alone.

759
01:11:49,052 --> 01:11:51,168
That's because you're a warrior, Lancelot.

760
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:55,088
You like to throw yourself into the fray,
come what may.

761
01:11:56,212 --> 01:11:58,646
You must think me a simple man, indeed.

762
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:30,601
Lancelot!

763
01:12:33,692 --> 01:12:34,681
Guinevere!

764
01:13:19,132 --> 01:13:22,488
-Are you hurt, my lady?
-No. l'm fine.

765
01:13:23,572 --> 01:13:25,290
But you risked your life for me.

766
01:13:25,932 --> 01:13:26,921
lt's my duty.

767
01:13:28,732 --> 01:13:30,962
Your devotion moves me.

768
01:13:31,652 --> 01:13:33,961
My devotion has no end, my lady.

769
01:13:39,172 --> 01:13:42,323
l must confess something, to be rid of it.

770
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:46,169
Then we must say nothing more.

771
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:52,049
l dreamt of you in Glastonbury.

772
01:13:53,972 --> 01:13:58,329
You opened a curtain into Avalon
and lifted me in.

773
01:14:08,012 --> 01:14:12,085
lt wasn't a dream.
l was there with Morgaine.

774
01:14:12,212 --> 01:14:13,361
She lifted you in.

775
01:14:14,332 --> 01:14:16,084
But l asked her to do it.

776
01:14:19,612 --> 01:14:21,330
So you felt it, too?

777
01:14:25,092 --> 01:14:26,764
But l am sworn to Arthur.

778
01:14:28,452 --> 01:14:29,328
As am l.

779
01:14:31,012 --> 01:14:32,889
So we have nothing to confess.

780
01:14:34,292 --> 01:14:36,726
But l have sinned with you in my thoughts.

781
01:14:38,852 --> 01:14:40,763
Thoughts are not deeds.

782
01:14:41,292 --> 01:14:44,170
The Bishop says, ''To think is to do.''

783
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:47,647
My thoughts don't answer to the Bishop.

784
01:14:47,772 --> 01:14:50,650
lf they did,
l would burn in hell a thousand years...

785
01:14:50,772 --> 01:14:53,286
...every time l see you walk past.

786
01:14:54,132 --> 01:14:56,407
Hell is very real to me.

787
01:14:57,732 --> 01:15:00,041
We must do nothing about this.

788
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:03,283
Are you listening to me?

789
01:15:03,972 --> 01:15:04,722
Swear.

790
01:15:04,812 --> 01:15:06,404
-Swear what?
-To do nothing.

791
01:15:06,492 --> 01:15:08,448
l don't intend to sin against my king.

792
01:15:08,572 --> 01:15:10,130
Why, then, won't you swear?

793
01:15:25,332 --> 01:15:28,642
There will be nothing between us.

794
01:15:32,812 --> 01:15:34,325
Will there, my love?

795
01:15:42,652 --> 01:15:43,767
l'm afraid.

796
01:15:44,212 --> 01:15:45,327
Of course you are.

797
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:47,926
But don't worry.

798
01:15:49,052 --> 01:15:51,725
l used it myself, before l was married.

799
01:15:52,732 --> 01:15:54,290
lt even has a pleasant taste.

800
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:57,605
Now, take your medicine.

801
01:16:03,132 --> 01:16:04,201
Drink, Morgaine.

802
01:16:05,892 --> 01:16:07,041
You'll be free.

803
01:16:08,412 --> 01:16:09,367
Drink.

804
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:14,761
What are you doing?

805
01:16:17,652 --> 01:16:21,122
She's carrying a child she doesn't want.
l'm helping her to get rid of it.

806
01:16:21,212 --> 01:16:22,770
Leave us, Morgause.

807
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,926
l'm not an infant,
crawling at your skirts, Viviane.

808
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:31,447
Nor am l one of your adoring priestesses.

809
01:16:32,052 --> 01:16:34,930
l'm a queen in my own right,
wife of Lot of Orkney.

810
01:16:35,012 --> 01:16:37,367
You do not order me to go or stay.

811
01:16:37,692 --> 01:16:39,205
l said, ''Leave us.''

812
01:16:50,012 --> 01:16:52,924
How could you do this to me? To us?

813
01:16:54,212 --> 01:16:55,964
l never intended for you to know.

814
01:16:56,372 --> 01:16:57,691
Well, l do know now.

815
01:16:58,652 --> 01:17:01,291
How could you have arranged
for such an abomination?

816
01:17:02,012 --> 01:17:03,923
lt is my sacred charge, Morgaine.

817
01:17:05,132 --> 01:17:07,362
You and Arthur
are the last remaining links...

818
01:17:07,452 --> 01:17:09,568
...between this land and the world of mists.

819
01:17:10,212 --> 01:17:12,726
Those links are becoming weaker
with every year.

820
01:17:12,892 --> 01:17:15,531
l must do everything in my power
to keep them alive.

821
01:17:15,772 --> 01:17:18,889
Even if it means sacrificing
everyone you've ever loved?

822
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:21,361
Even if it means sacrificing my very soul.

823
01:17:22,292 --> 01:17:24,852
That is what being the Lady of the Lake
truly demands.

824
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,843
As you, too, will find out.

825
01:17:27,212 --> 01:17:28,088
l?

826
01:17:28,252 --> 01:17:29,480
Why, of course.

827
01:17:30,572 --> 01:17:33,609
What else has all your training,
all your suffering, been for...

828
01:17:33,812 --> 01:17:36,246
...if not to fit you to be the Lady
after l'm gone?

829
01:17:37,252 --> 01:17:39,368
You have a greatness of soul, Morgaine.

830
01:17:39,772 --> 01:17:41,046
l can see it.

831
01:17:41,692 --> 01:17:43,410
l've seen it all along.

832
01:17:44,092 --> 01:17:47,243
l am carrying a bastard child
fathered by my own brother.

833
01:17:47,332 --> 01:17:49,129
You are carrying Arthur's successor.

834
01:17:49,892 --> 01:17:52,167
Would you have Morgause murder it
in the womb...

835
01:17:52,252 --> 01:17:55,085
...in order to have her son
step into Arthur's shoes?

836
01:17:56,572 --> 01:17:57,368
No.

837
01:17:57,612 --> 01:17:59,364
lf you bear no child...

838
01:17:59,452 --> 01:18:03,081
...the offspring of Lot and Morgause
will be next in line for the throne.

839
01:18:04,052 --> 01:18:06,805
Why else is she so solicitous
of your needs?

840
01:18:07,652 --> 01:18:08,801
l don't believe it.

841
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:09,881
Then go ahead.

842
01:18:10,292 --> 01:18:12,852
Let her ambitions shape
the nation's future.

843
01:18:14,132 --> 01:18:17,124
Morgause thinks of nothing
and no one but herself, Morgaine.

844
01:18:19,892 --> 01:18:22,167
Your motives may be nobler than hers...

845
01:18:22,252 --> 01:18:25,847
...but you still move us around
like pieces on a game board.

846
01:18:26,132 --> 01:18:28,327
What has my mother given up
for your Avalon?

847
01:18:29,012 --> 01:18:31,685
My father died at Uther's hands
because of you.

848
01:18:32,572 --> 01:18:34,563
My poor, innocent brother, Arthur...

849
01:18:34,652 --> 01:18:38,247
...who was a baby on my lap,
and loved me as no other.

850
01:18:39,292 --> 01:18:40,645
And l loved him.

851
01:18:41,532 --> 01:18:43,045
Look what you've done to us.

852
01:18:44,012 --> 01:18:48,722
You've twisted our love and turned it
into shame, all for the sake of Avalon!

853
01:18:53,452 --> 01:18:54,407
No!

854
01:18:55,292 --> 01:18:57,283
l will not kill the child within me...

855
01:18:57,372 --> 01:18:59,442
...but l will not let you take him to Avalon.

856
01:18:59,932 --> 01:19:02,241
l will not let you twist
and bend him to your will.

857
01:19:02,332 --> 01:19:05,324
l can train him to be the greatest ruler
Britain has ever seen.

858
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:07,482
He will never set foot in Avalon, Viviane.

859
01:19:07,612 --> 01:19:09,842
He will not be one of your pawns
and nor will l.

860
01:19:09,972 --> 01:19:12,122
You have sworn to obey the Goddess
through me.

861
01:19:12,292 --> 01:19:14,169
My vows were to her, not to you.

862
01:19:14,412 --> 01:19:16,130
l renounce you. Do you hear me?

863
01:19:16,212 --> 01:19:18,089
l will never set foot in Avalon again.

864
01:19:18,172 --> 01:19:19,161
You will obey!

865
01:19:19,252 --> 01:19:20,241
Never!

866
01:19:48,106 --> 01:19:50,176
Where else was there for me to go...

867
01:19:50,266 --> 01:19:53,542
...but with Morgause and Lot
into the wilds of Orkney?

868
01:19:53,786 --> 01:19:58,143
There, my child could disappear
into the teeming brood in Lot's castle.

869
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,224
Eat and enjoy!

870
01:20:00,746 --> 01:20:04,102
No man will ever say
l don't keep a great hall...

871
01:20:06,986 --> 01:20:09,261
...even in the depths of winter.

872
01:20:15,146 --> 01:20:17,785
l saved the best cut for you, Morgaine.

873
01:20:18,226 --> 01:20:20,376
Wasn't it you who told me the best meat...

874
01:20:20,466 --> 01:20:23,299
...for a breeding woman
was the liver of a stag...

875
01:20:23,706 --> 01:20:24,900
...eaten raw?

876
01:20:36,106 --> 01:20:38,700
The baby's coming.
Quick, get her to her chambers.

877
01:20:38,786 --> 01:20:40,105
lt's all right.

878
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:48,745
Wife, wait.

879
01:20:49,226 --> 01:20:51,786
You're quick to bring our son's rival
into this world.

880
01:20:52,666 --> 01:20:54,418
lf this child dies...

881
01:20:54,506 --> 01:20:57,543
...and Guinevere fails
to produce an heir for Arthur...

882
01:20:57,866 --> 01:20:59,060
...then our son...

883
01:20:59,626 --> 01:21:01,184
...will be High King.

884
01:21:01,786 --> 01:21:04,539
You think on that as you bring this infant
into the world.

885
01:21:05,066 --> 01:21:06,738
You think well on it.

886
01:21:09,946 --> 01:21:11,584
Morgaine, swallow.

887
01:21:12,266 --> 01:21:13,096
Push.

888
01:21:13,306 --> 01:21:15,501
lt's all right, Lady Morgaine.

889
01:21:23,786 --> 01:21:25,697
Push, push!

890
01:21:37,746 --> 01:21:38,781
Morgaine!

891
01:21:42,626 --> 01:21:44,378
Why are you hidden from my sight?

892
01:21:51,146 --> 01:21:52,943
She won't be able to feed him yet.

893
01:21:53,226 --> 01:21:54,454
Poor babe.

894
01:21:54,546 --> 01:21:56,377
But the wet nurse is ready.

895
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,219
Shall l take him, my lady?

896
01:22:01,706 --> 01:22:02,980
The woman's waiting.

897
01:22:03,066 --> 01:22:04,101
Not yet.

898
01:23:25,706 --> 01:23:26,855
Mother.

899
01:23:33,786 --> 01:23:34,696
Yes, child.

900
01:23:35,906 --> 01:23:37,703
Mother, forgive me.

901
01:23:39,906 --> 01:23:41,134
For what?

902
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:43,894
Arthur...

903
01:23:46,586 --> 01:23:48,304
...he doesn't know.

904
01:23:49,906 --> 01:23:51,783
Arthur is the father?

905
01:23:52,786 --> 01:23:55,539
Don't tell him. Please.

906
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:57,463
Please, don't tell him.

907
01:24:28,186 --> 01:24:29,938
Let me hold him.

908
01:24:32,626 --> 01:24:34,423
Let me hold him just once.

909
01:24:43,306 --> 01:24:44,295
Leave us.

910
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:51,662
What is this, woman? The child is alive.

911
01:24:51,746 --> 01:24:53,225
And will remain so.

912
01:24:53,746 --> 01:24:54,781
Why?

913
01:24:55,466 --> 01:24:56,740
lt is Arthur's child.

914
01:25:04,146 --> 01:25:05,261
Son of a king.

915
01:25:07,146 --> 01:25:09,535
-She told you?
-ln her fever.

916
01:25:09,866 --> 01:25:11,299
She doesn't know l know.

917
01:25:12,586 --> 01:25:14,224
Son of a High King.

918
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:17,216
No matter how many sons he has...

919
01:25:18,186 --> 01:25:20,620
...this child will always be his firstborn.

920
01:25:22,066 --> 01:25:24,626
With this secret,
we have a weapon in our hands.

921
01:25:26,266 --> 01:25:27,619
Think of it, Husband.

922
01:25:29,066 --> 01:25:33,457
His flesh, his blood, his heir.

923
01:25:34,586 --> 01:25:38,579
But my instruction, my influence.

924
01:25:39,506 --> 01:25:43,294
l'll teach him to have little need
of Morgaine and great need of me.

925
01:25:43,946 --> 01:25:45,857
And as the years pass...

926
01:25:45,946 --> 01:25:48,779
...Britain will become
more and more our own.

927
01:25:51,626 --> 01:25:53,537
lt's time for his first meal.

928
01:25:55,946 --> 01:25:58,506
A new and dreadful power was unleashed.

929
01:25:58,986 --> 01:26:02,501
And the fate of all Britain
was altered forever.

930
01:26:21,506 --> 01:26:24,862
lt was as if my life had become
lost in the mists.

931
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:28,502
Everything that l loved
and cherished was gone.

932
01:26:28,586 --> 01:26:31,783
l thought there was nothing more
that could be taken from me.

933
01:26:31,866 --> 01:26:33,379
How wrong l was.

934
01:26:34,466 --> 01:26:38,300
But at Camelot, it seemed that
high summer had come to Britain at last.

935
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:42,705
Under the rule of a good, brave man,
with the Knights of the Round Table...

936
01:26:42,786 --> 01:26:44,936
...our beleaguered country was at peace.

937
01:26:46,106 --> 01:26:48,859
Arthur was the High King
everyone had hoped for...

938
01:26:49,146 --> 01:26:51,023
...and Guinevere, his queen.

939
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:58,384
l've missed you, my love.

940
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:00,899
Are you ill?

941
01:27:01,426 --> 01:27:03,303
My courses have come on me again.

942
01:27:03,906 --> 01:27:06,101
Why do you let them distress you so?

943
01:27:06,826 --> 01:27:09,215
But it means l haven't given you a son.

944
01:27:09,306 --> 01:27:11,501
l haven't given you an heir.

945
01:27:13,106 --> 01:27:16,462
We are young yet.
We have years for children.

946
01:27:17,546 --> 01:27:21,221
Now, get dressed. The troops
have returned victorious, as l promised...

947
01:27:22,226 --> 01:27:24,820
...and they expect to see
the queen by my side.

948
01:27:37,706 --> 01:27:38,821
Arthur!

949
01:27:48,666 --> 01:27:49,894
What is it, Morgaine?

950
01:27:50,106 --> 01:27:51,425
l'm fine.

951
01:27:53,226 --> 01:27:55,057
Another bad dream?

952
01:27:55,386 --> 01:27:57,900
Mom, why do you have
so many bad dreams?

953
01:27:58,826 --> 01:28:01,294
Some people are born that way,
my poppet.

954
01:28:02,466 --> 01:28:05,458
lt's like, some people have brown hair...

955
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,662
...and some people have yellow hair.

956
01:28:08,746 --> 01:28:10,145
Some people see things.

957
01:28:11,666 --> 01:28:13,657
Not yet. He's far too young.

958
01:28:17,266 --> 01:28:20,736
Strange, that in the peace of Orkney
l should feel distracted so.

959
01:28:22,706 --> 01:28:24,776
Why don't you go back to Camelot?

960
01:28:26,386 --> 01:28:27,580
What about my child?

961
01:28:28,306 --> 01:28:30,774
We'll be fine on our own,
won't we, poppet?

962
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:33,742
You've quite won him away from me.

963
01:28:34,706 --> 01:28:36,458
We're twin souls, he and l.

964
01:28:36,666 --> 01:28:39,658
Now l'll have him all for myself,
won't that be nice?

965
01:28:41,106 --> 01:28:43,017
You must promise me one thing:

966
01:28:44,106 --> 01:28:46,495
Never let Viviane get her hands
on Mordred.

967
01:28:47,106 --> 01:28:49,825
She wants to foster him.
You must never allow it.

968
01:28:50,066 --> 01:28:51,101
l promise.

969
01:29:05,946 --> 01:29:09,621
And so the day came
when l returned to Camelot...

970
01:29:09,946 --> 01:29:12,221
...the beating heart of Britain itself...

971
01:29:12,426 --> 01:29:14,815
...and the place where
l had spent my childhood...

972
01:29:14,906 --> 01:29:16,658
...with my little brother, Arthur.

973
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:38,661
Knights.

974
01:29:40,506 --> 01:29:42,576
My sister has returned from Orkney.

975
01:29:44,266 --> 01:29:46,734
-You remember Gawain.
-Morgaine.

976
01:29:47,986 --> 01:29:51,501
Percival, Gallahad, Accolon.

977
01:29:53,586 --> 01:29:56,419
l heard you were educated
on the lsle of Mists.

978
01:29:57,106 --> 01:29:58,858
l was trained there as a priestess.

979
01:29:59,226 --> 01:30:00,784
l long to go there one day...

980
01:30:00,866 --> 01:30:03,096
...and know the mysteries
of the hidden world.

981
01:30:03,186 --> 01:30:04,141
My lord...

982
01:30:04,266 --> 01:30:06,302
...aren't you going to present me as well?

983
01:30:06,386 --> 01:30:09,458
-My queen.
-We've met briefly, but hardly spoke at all.

984
01:30:10,066 --> 01:30:12,626
lt's more fitting
that l should bow to you, Morgaine.

985
01:30:12,946 --> 01:30:15,779
You were in the king's affections
long before l was.

986
01:30:16,106 --> 01:30:18,301
Come, let us talk as sisters...

987
01:30:18,626 --> 01:30:20,344
...for sisters is what we are.

988
01:30:31,546 --> 01:30:33,935
l will not pretend l am not afraid of you.

989
01:30:35,186 --> 01:30:37,654
l was raised in great suspicion
of the old religion.

990
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:40,541
But your head tells you we're the same.

991
01:30:41,906 --> 01:30:44,101
Something like that, yes.

992
01:30:44,866 --> 01:30:45,821
And yet--

993
01:30:45,986 --> 01:30:47,863
We couldn't be more different.

994
01:30:48,146 --> 01:30:49,101
Very good.

995
01:30:49,546 --> 01:30:51,821
They taught you well
to read another's thoughts.

996
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:54,979
l read another's thoughts
as well as any woman can.

997
01:30:56,906 --> 01:30:59,500
But the training, Morgaine...

998
01:31:00,146 --> 01:31:02,421
...it must have been good for something.

999
01:31:02,986 --> 01:31:06,899
For instance, did Avalon train you
in herb lore and spells?

1000
01:31:08,386 --> 01:31:09,421
Of course.

1001
01:31:11,386 --> 01:31:13,263
Tell me what l'm thinking now.

1002
01:31:15,906 --> 01:31:17,419
l couldn't guess.

1003
01:31:18,626 --> 01:31:21,140
Then l will say it aloud, if l must.

1004
01:31:23,586 --> 01:31:24,655
There are herbs...

1005
01:31:25,066 --> 01:31:28,422
...that can make a woman conceive,
are there not?

1006
01:31:29,666 --> 01:31:31,099
ls that what you want?

1007
01:31:32,746 --> 01:31:35,818
Please do not make this any harder
than it already is.

1008
01:31:38,066 --> 01:31:40,136
There is a charm that is sometimes used.

1009
01:31:41,226 --> 01:31:43,262
But you, surely, would never touch it.

1010
01:31:46,226 --> 01:31:48,376
Tell me you are not a witch.

1011
01:31:49,586 --> 01:31:51,736
Tell me it is not the devil's own spell...

1012
01:31:51,826 --> 01:31:53,896
...and that l will not burn for it.

1013
01:31:55,226 --> 01:31:57,786
This time, this one time...

1014
01:31:58,426 --> 01:31:59,984
...l will believe you.

1015
01:32:04,466 --> 01:32:06,855
You will have it by the night of Beltane.

1016
01:32:14,706 --> 01:32:16,776
There, my friend. Everything's all right.

1017
01:32:16,866 --> 01:32:18,538
You'll gallop like a colt!

1018
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:30,378
You have a way with horses.

1019
01:32:31,066 --> 01:32:33,500
Better than with people, l sometimes think.

1020
01:32:34,346 --> 01:32:37,304
All people, or just some people?

1021
01:32:38,506 --> 01:32:39,780
l'm speaking of women.

1022
01:32:39,866 --> 01:32:42,460
l would have thought
you'd have a bride by now.

1023
01:32:43,786 --> 01:32:46,698
Or does your heart still long
for the woman you can't have?

1024
01:32:48,746 --> 01:32:50,065
The rumors are not true.

1025
01:32:50,146 --> 01:32:52,455
You may speak of it to me, Cousin.

1026
01:32:52,786 --> 01:32:55,300
After all, l'm the one that brought it about.

1027
01:32:55,426 --> 01:32:57,621
l lifted her into your world.

1028
01:32:58,666 --> 01:33:01,260
Little did l know
all that would come from that moment.

1029
01:33:03,026 --> 01:33:06,382
l love Arthur more
than l have ever loved another man.

1030
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:08,736
But whatever else is in my head,
or my heart...

1031
01:33:08,826 --> 01:33:10,782
...will stay with me until l die.

1032
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:14,339
And do you know
what is in my head and in my heart?

1033
01:33:17,586 --> 01:33:19,656
l feel the loss of you, dear Cousin.

1034
01:33:21,626 --> 01:33:23,378
No one touched me like you did.

1035
01:33:24,626 --> 01:33:27,982
And still, even now, l yearn for you.

1036
01:33:33,746 --> 01:33:35,896
l have fought many battles, Morgaine...

1037
01:33:37,826 --> 01:33:40,943
...but none like the one l fought
since that day in Avalon.

1038
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:55,979
Come to bed, Arthur.

1039
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:43,257
The moon waxed and waned...

1040
01:34:43,346 --> 01:34:46,065
...and the time
of the fertility rites of Beltane...

1041
01:34:46,466 --> 01:34:48,184
...came round again.

1042
01:34:49,826 --> 01:34:51,544
This will make me conceive?

1043
01:34:51,826 --> 01:34:55,182
Don't be surprised if the charm works
better than you think it should.

1044
01:34:55,266 --> 01:34:57,461
The ways of the Goddess are her own.

1045
01:34:57,586 --> 01:34:59,463
Seems fitting, doesn't it?

1046
01:34:59,666 --> 01:35:02,499
The night of Beltane, but l don't care.

1047
01:35:03,026 --> 01:35:05,335
Let them practice their pagan magic...

1048
01:35:05,426 --> 01:35:07,815
...if their goddess will bring me a child....

1049
01:35:35,506 --> 01:35:37,258
Drink, men, drink.

1050
01:35:37,586 --> 01:35:40,942
We'll have our own Beltane celebration
within these walls...

1051
01:35:41,066 --> 01:35:42,215
...where it's safe.

1052
01:37:04,306 --> 01:37:05,819
You would walk without light?

1053
01:37:06,666 --> 01:37:08,657
There is light enough over there.

1054
01:37:09,426 --> 01:37:11,576
lt's dangerous to light the fires these days.

1055
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:13,099
The priests don't like it.

1056
01:37:14,226 --> 01:37:16,501
The priests are becoming more powerful.

1057
01:37:18,026 --> 01:37:21,098
But tonight, just tonight...

1058
01:37:22,266 --> 01:37:24,177
...we can forget about the priests.

1059
01:37:27,186 --> 01:37:28,824
Shall we walk, my lord?

1060
01:37:55,066 --> 01:37:56,135
My queen.

1061
01:37:57,746 --> 01:38:01,261
Guinevere and Lancelot.

1062
01:38:01,746 --> 01:38:04,306
Two people l love most in the world.

1063
01:38:04,466 --> 01:38:06,218
Do you love me, both of you?

1064
01:38:10,106 --> 01:38:13,416
Sometimes l think
Lancelot is the best of us.

1065
01:38:13,866 --> 01:38:15,140
Up you come.

1066
01:38:19,906 --> 01:38:22,659
Come, lie beside me. Both of you.

1067
01:38:23,346 --> 01:38:24,938
l want to talk to you...

1068
01:38:25,466 --> 01:38:27,582
...and if drink won't help me say this...

1069
01:38:27,666 --> 01:38:29,338
...it will never be said.

1070
01:38:31,346 --> 01:38:32,779
Guinevere has no child.

1071
01:38:36,706 --> 01:38:39,174
Don't you think l see
how you two look at each other?

1072
01:38:39,266 --> 01:38:40,585
-Arthur--
-No.

1073
01:38:41,626 --> 01:38:43,696
l will get to the end of this...

1074
01:38:44,786 --> 01:38:46,856
...even if l have to command your silence.

1075
01:38:48,786 --> 01:38:51,823
My wife thinks it's her fault
we have no child...

1076
01:38:53,946 --> 01:38:55,823
...but l believe it's me.

1077
01:38:56,146 --> 01:38:59,104
Yes, sometimes the fault lies
with the man.

1078
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:00,865
Even when that man is king.

1079
01:39:00,946 --> 01:39:03,540
Arthur, please do not continue with this.

1080
01:39:03,666 --> 01:39:05,736
My kingdom needs an heir, my sweet.

1081
01:39:06,426 --> 01:39:09,224
Otherwise,
everything l'm fighting for is lost.

1082
01:39:15,826 --> 01:39:17,498
A son of yours, Lancelot...

1083
01:39:17,986 --> 01:39:20,056
...conceived in the king's bed...

1084
01:39:20,386 --> 01:39:22,058
...would be heir to my throne.

1085
01:39:23,706 --> 01:39:27,824
Better that,
than the son of Lot should reign, is it not?

1086
01:39:28,986 --> 01:39:32,456
Sure, Bishop Patricius would say
it was a grievous sin...

1087
01:39:33,266 --> 01:39:37,623
...but l say it's a greater sin
to provide no son to inherit my crown...

1088
01:39:38,386 --> 01:39:40,661
...and let the kingdom slip
into such chaos...

1089
01:39:40,746 --> 01:39:43,897
...as there was
before my father came to the throne.

1090
01:39:46,066 --> 01:39:47,181
My friend...

1091
01:39:48,386 --> 01:39:51,822
...my cousin, will you do this for me?

1092
01:40:02,666 --> 01:40:04,304
lt's for my lady to say.

1093
01:40:08,146 --> 01:40:11,377
My lord, no. l have given my vows to you.

1094
01:40:11,466 --> 01:40:12,535
To me, yes.

1095
01:40:13,266 --> 01:40:16,622
To be mine, and to obey me,
as your husband and your king.

1096
01:40:17,146 --> 01:40:20,661
For years our forefathers
have done these things without shame...

1097
01:40:21,546 --> 01:40:24,982
...in the faces of the very same gods
who look over us tonight.

1098
01:40:31,986 --> 01:40:34,295
We will both be with you, together.

1099
01:40:36,386 --> 01:40:40,140
And if the child we want
should come of this...

1100
01:40:40,226 --> 01:40:42,899
...none of us need ever know for certain.

1101
01:40:44,626 --> 01:40:46,696
And you will be able to swear...

1102
01:40:48,946 --> 01:40:50,095
...in truth...

1103
01:40:51,186 --> 01:40:54,223
...that our child was conceived
in the king's bed.

1104
01:41:44,786 --> 01:41:47,141
l wish you were the sister
of some lesser man.

1105
01:43:26,946 --> 01:43:28,618
Good morning, Cousin.

1106
01:43:30,586 --> 01:43:32,304
You gave her a charm, didn't you?

1107
01:43:33,306 --> 01:43:34,375
Guinevere?

1108
01:43:35,786 --> 01:43:37,139
She told me.

1109
01:43:37,666 --> 01:43:39,657
-lt was not meant for you.
-Was it not?

1110
01:43:41,386 --> 01:43:43,741
l had no idea it would be you.

1111
01:43:44,946 --> 01:43:48,097
Then the ways of the Goddess
are beyond your understanding.

1112
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:53,864
The king himself...

1113
01:43:54,386 --> 01:43:57,298
...asked me into his bed with the queen.

1114
01:43:59,786 --> 01:44:01,265
All three of you?

1115
01:44:14,346 --> 01:44:15,665
How can l go back...

1116
01:44:17,546 --> 01:44:19,502
...to the way things were?

1117
01:44:21,146 --> 01:44:23,057
How can l sit at his table...

1118
01:44:24,866 --> 01:44:28,222
...how can l kneel before him
and call myself his servant?

1119
01:44:30,706 --> 01:44:34,824
You are not to blame for loving Guinevere.

1120
01:44:38,026 --> 01:44:39,425
What can l do?

1121
01:44:41,226 --> 01:44:42,705
Don't worry, Cousin.

1122
01:44:43,426 --> 01:44:45,178
We will put our heads together.

1123
01:44:48,906 --> 01:44:50,862
l just never dared hope...

1124
01:44:51,986 --> 01:44:55,137
...then the Lady Morgaine
told me there was hope.

1125
01:44:56,106 --> 01:44:59,496
And l spoke to him, and he asked me.

1126
01:45:00,786 --> 01:45:02,378
Who asked you?

1127
01:45:03,066 --> 01:45:04,135
Lancelot.

1128
01:45:05,786 --> 01:45:08,823
Your Majesty,
l'm the happiest woman in England.

1129
01:45:11,626 --> 01:45:13,696
Lancelot asked you to be his wife?

1130
01:45:15,186 --> 01:45:16,460
And you said yes.

1131
01:45:18,346 --> 01:45:19,665
Of course you did.

1132
01:45:20,186 --> 01:45:21,904
What could be more natural?

1133
01:45:22,546 --> 01:45:23,774
Your Majesty?

1134
01:45:25,146 --> 01:45:27,023
You have a husband, very good.

1135
01:45:27,106 --> 01:45:29,859
But do l have a child to give my king? No.

1136
01:45:30,306 --> 01:45:33,139
That's what you'll whisper
to the rest of my women, isn't it?

1137
01:45:33,266 --> 01:45:35,177
''The queen has her courses again.''

1138
01:45:35,826 --> 01:45:37,305
Get out of my sight!

1139
01:45:47,306 --> 01:45:49,615
-Two options: we can go to the north--
-Arthur.

1140
01:45:56,146 --> 01:45:57,499
Take over for me.

1141
01:46:02,946 --> 01:46:06,859
So much for the love of your friend.
So much for your dear sister's potions.

1142
01:46:07,026 --> 01:46:08,698
Guinevere, calm yourself.

1143
01:46:09,386 --> 01:46:10,785
What is it that brings you?

1144
01:46:10,866 --> 01:46:14,142
My courses have come on me, Arthur.
l bear you no child.

1145
01:46:14,866 --> 01:46:16,140
But, my queen--

1146
01:46:16,506 --> 01:46:18,701
l took poison from a witch...

1147
01:46:19,186 --> 01:46:22,098
...l slept with you and your friend
and gave myself...

1148
01:46:22,186 --> 01:46:25,576
...to your lust and ungodliness,
and all for nothing.

1149
01:46:25,906 --> 01:46:27,737
All for nothing!

1150
01:46:29,426 --> 01:46:32,304
No baby, no baby.

1151
01:46:34,866 --> 01:46:36,219
Where is my baby?

1152
01:46:37,026 --> 01:46:40,382
lt's in God's hands now, not ours.

1153
01:46:42,866 --> 01:46:44,015
Don't cry.

1154
01:46:44,106 --> 01:46:46,984
God does not reward sinners.

1155
01:46:49,426 --> 01:46:51,940
We are all sinners, my love.

1156
01:46:52,226 --> 01:46:54,262
He knows that and understands.

1157
01:46:55,546 --> 01:46:59,380
And He knows that you value pagans
equally with Christians...

1158
01:46:59,626 --> 01:47:02,140
...and fight under a banner
of the Mother Goddess...

1159
01:47:02,226 --> 01:47:04,615
...as if she were equal
to our Father in heaven.

1160
01:47:04,706 --> 01:47:07,061
Our Father may be in heaven, Guinevere...

1161
01:47:07,626 --> 01:47:09,935
...but the Goddess
is Great Mother to us all.

1162
01:47:10,026 --> 01:47:12,142
She is not Great Mother to me.

1163
01:47:12,266 --> 01:47:13,779
She will not give me a child.

1164
01:47:13,866 --> 01:47:16,858
And while you honor her,
God will not give me a child either.

1165
01:47:16,946 --> 01:47:18,664
You say you are a good man...

1166
01:47:18,826 --> 01:47:20,942
...but you condemn
your wife to barrenness...

1167
01:47:21,026 --> 01:47:23,779
...for the sake of an oath
to painted savages.

1168
01:47:26,266 --> 01:47:28,461
l despise you, Arthur Pendragon.

1169
01:47:29,306 --> 01:47:31,456
Neither good Christian, nor good pagan...

1170
01:47:31,906 --> 01:47:33,897
...nor good husband to me.

1171
01:47:47,106 --> 01:47:50,462
And so, Lancelot was married
to the Lady Elaine.

1172
01:47:50,546 --> 01:47:52,616
And if he could not make me happy...

1173
01:47:52,746 --> 01:47:55,783
...at least he could fill
her simple soul with delight...

1174
01:47:55,946 --> 01:47:58,585
...and heal the wounds
that had been inflicted on him...

1175
01:47:58,666 --> 01:48:00,304
...by the magic of Avalon.

1176
01:48:00,586 --> 01:48:02,383
Has my mother come, old Druid?

1177
01:48:03,266 --> 01:48:05,826
Your mother sends her blessings, my son.

1178
01:48:05,906 --> 01:48:07,942
Perhaps she could not bear to see you...

1179
01:48:08,026 --> 01:48:11,336
...married under the banners
of Christianity all alone.

1180
01:48:12,626 --> 01:48:14,617
We'll visit her on the way to Pellinore.

1181
01:48:14,706 --> 01:48:16,139
Thank you, Morgaine.

1182
01:48:22,946 --> 01:48:23,822
Morgaine...

1183
01:48:24,826 --> 01:48:29,024
...the Lady of the Lake is heartsick
that you have withheld yourself from her.

1184
01:48:29,746 --> 01:48:31,384
l think of her often...

1185
01:48:32,106 --> 01:48:34,256
...though l'm committed to my course.

1186
01:48:35,946 --> 01:48:37,584
How does Viviane fare?

1187
01:48:37,666 --> 01:48:40,305
She longs to have you at her side.

1188
01:48:41,466 --> 01:48:44,538
She did what she did
in the service of the Goddess.

1189
01:48:45,186 --> 01:48:48,895
And although you reject her,
you do not reject the old ways, l think.

1190
01:48:49,746 --> 01:48:51,020
For which l honor you.

1191
01:48:52,466 --> 01:48:54,980
This is Accolon of Wales.

1192
01:48:55,586 --> 01:48:59,499
He also is strong in the old religion,
as is his father, Uriens.

1193
01:49:00,786 --> 01:49:03,254
We've already had the pleasure
to meet, Merlin.

1194
01:49:03,346 --> 01:49:05,416
Will you join me in a dance, lady?

1195
01:49:07,266 --> 01:49:09,018
lf you can bring your horsemen...

1196
01:49:09,106 --> 01:49:11,825
...down from the Welsh hills,
we can trap the Jutes...

1197
01:49:11,906 --> 01:49:14,136
...before they breach the line of the Avon.

1198
01:49:14,226 --> 01:49:15,818
lt will be done, Your Majesty.

1199
01:49:17,106 --> 01:49:19,461
Have you thought, sir,
of that boon l crave of you?

1200
01:49:19,546 --> 01:49:22,902
King Uriens has long been a widower
and wishes to remarry.

1201
01:49:23,346 --> 01:49:26,179
l asked His High Majesty
if there was a lady of your court...

1202
01:49:26,266 --> 01:49:29,224
...who would be willing to become
Queen of North Wales.

1203
01:49:33,666 --> 01:49:34,860
Morgaine.

1204
01:49:36,506 --> 01:49:37,734
Morgaine?

1205
01:49:38,306 --> 01:49:39,978
ls she not a little young?

1206
01:49:40,146 --> 01:49:43,218
l think she would be happy
with an older man.

1207
01:49:43,386 --> 01:49:45,422
She is no giddy, young thing.

1208
01:49:47,826 --> 01:49:50,021
What do you think, King Uriens?

1209
01:49:50,906 --> 01:49:52,464
The High King's own sister?

1210
01:49:56,146 --> 01:49:57,943
l would be honored if she'd have me.

1211
01:49:59,306 --> 01:50:01,217
We will discuss this later, my friend.

1212
01:50:01,306 --> 01:50:03,217
Thank you, my lord.

1213
01:50:06,186 --> 01:50:07,619
Morgaine, for Uriens?

1214
01:50:08,666 --> 01:50:10,065
He is a good man...

1215
01:50:10,146 --> 01:50:12,944
...of the old religion and an important ally.

1216
01:50:14,506 --> 01:50:16,462
Should we not at least ask her?

1217
01:50:18,306 --> 01:50:20,262
l think l know what her answer will be.

1218
01:50:25,306 --> 01:50:28,104
Morgaine, we have had an offer
of marriage for you.

1219
01:50:28,306 --> 01:50:30,183
Well, it has been broached.

1220
01:50:32,026 --> 01:50:35,496
You are asked to join yourself
to the royal house of North Wales.

1221
01:50:36,626 --> 01:50:37,820
lt is a wild place.

1222
01:50:37,906 --> 01:50:39,976
And you will be far from Camelot, Sister.

1223
01:50:40,106 --> 01:50:43,223
There is one of the old religion there,
who would wish to wed you.

1224
01:50:50,586 --> 01:50:53,259
l cannot pretend
l am as surprised as all that, Brother.

1225
01:50:55,506 --> 01:50:58,384
Why, the sly fellow.
He did not tell me he had spoken to you.

1226
01:51:00,946 --> 01:51:02,220
What shall l tell him?

1227
01:51:04,906 --> 01:51:07,420
You may tell him
l'd be happy to live in North Wales.

1228
01:51:12,946 --> 01:51:14,698
l'm happy for you, Morgaine.

1229
01:51:16,786 --> 01:51:17,980
Very happy.

1230
01:51:29,706 --> 01:51:31,344
Friends...

1231
01:51:31,866 --> 01:51:33,345
...on this auspicious day...

1232
01:51:33,426 --> 01:51:35,735
...l have yet another note
of happiness to sound.

1233
01:51:36,466 --> 01:51:38,377
My dear sister, Morgaine...

1234
01:51:38,546 --> 01:51:42,221
...is to be betrothed
to King Uriens of North Wales.

1235
01:51:50,026 --> 01:51:52,062
For a moment it did not sink in.

1236
01:51:52,506 --> 01:51:54,064
And then l realized:

1237
01:51:54,346 --> 01:51:57,463
l had been tricked into marrying
the father instead of the son...

1238
01:51:57,546 --> 01:51:59,696
...and there was nothing
l could do about it.

1239
01:52:00,506 --> 01:52:02,622
To have rejected Uriens there and then...

1240
01:52:02,706 --> 01:52:05,266
...would have humiliated him
before the whole country...

1241
01:52:05,346 --> 01:52:07,814
...and cost my brother the loyalty of Wales.

1242
01:52:09,026 --> 01:52:10,061
l was caught...

1243
01:52:11,186 --> 01:52:12,983
...like a fly in a web.

1244
01:52:32,226 --> 01:52:33,784
How could you let this happen?

1245
01:52:35,186 --> 01:52:36,904
There was little l could do.

1246
01:52:37,066 --> 01:52:39,421
First, they take down
the banners of Pendragon.

1247
01:52:39,506 --> 01:52:40,621
Then Morgaine...

1248
01:52:40,706 --> 01:52:44,494
...the one person who could've kept
the spirit of the Goddess alive in Camelot...

1249
01:52:44,586 --> 01:52:47,464
...is sent to North Wales. And why?

1250
01:52:47,586 --> 01:52:49,383
Because of some Christian ninny.

1251
01:52:50,506 --> 01:52:53,737
l have lost my strength, Viviane.

1252
01:52:56,626 --> 01:53:00,460
l feel the power of the Goddess...

1253
01:53:01,746 --> 01:53:03,225
...is no longer in me.

1254
01:53:03,306 --> 01:53:05,058
Why, you're just tired, Merlin.

1255
01:53:05,146 --> 01:53:07,023
lt's been a long journey from Camelot.

1256
01:53:08,226 --> 01:53:11,980
l am more than just tired.

1257
01:53:15,626 --> 01:53:19,414
Surely, there are enough herbs in Avalon
to give you back your strength.

1258
01:53:19,506 --> 01:53:21,622
l shall ask Raven to fetch you some.

1259
01:53:21,746 --> 01:53:24,704
Please, don't leave me.

1260
01:53:25,626 --> 01:53:26,854
Please.

1261
01:53:31,586 --> 01:53:32,939
Poor Merlin.

1262
01:53:34,906 --> 01:53:36,464
l'm getting tired, too.

1263
01:53:37,546 --> 01:53:39,935
l'd hoped Morgaine would put on my robes.

1264
01:53:41,506 --> 01:53:45,943
Perhaps no one will step
into your robes, Viviane.

1265
01:53:47,866 --> 01:53:48,935
Perhaps...

1266
01:53:49,586 --> 01:53:51,702
...Avalon will die with us.

1267
01:53:51,826 --> 01:53:53,737
Well, there's young Mordred yet.

1268
01:53:54,026 --> 01:53:55,141
He's coming of age.

1269
01:53:55,226 --> 01:53:56,625
He is our best hope.

1270
01:54:00,106 --> 01:54:03,496
We had a long fight together...

1271
01:54:05,026 --> 01:54:06,220
...you and l.

1272
01:54:07,186 --> 01:54:10,576
You have been a worthy partner.

1273
01:54:12,226 --> 01:54:15,218
l've learned everything l know
from you, Merlin.

1274
01:54:16,066 --> 01:54:18,261
We shall fight for many years to come.

1275
01:54:18,506 --> 01:54:21,384
No, l won't see any more wars.

1276
01:54:23,706 --> 01:54:25,264
But you will continue.

1277
01:54:27,386 --> 01:54:29,217
You have always...

1278
01:54:29,746 --> 01:54:32,579
...sacrificed everything for Avalon...

1279
01:54:33,386 --> 01:54:35,342
...and done so gladly.

1280
01:54:37,786 --> 01:54:42,223
Merlin, do you think l've wasted my life?

1281
01:54:43,866 --> 01:54:44,821
No.

1282
01:54:46,386 --> 01:54:49,901
We gave everything to Avalon...

1283
01:54:50,706 --> 01:54:52,617
...because we had no choice.

1284
01:54:54,306 --> 01:54:57,298
-But we failed.
-No, we didn't fail.

1285
01:54:57,986 --> 01:54:59,658
We did what...

1286
01:55:00,426 --> 01:55:03,463
...we thought was right
every single moment.

1287
01:55:05,306 --> 01:55:07,661
Sometimes we were headstrong...

1288
01:55:09,586 --> 01:55:14,535
...but we lived our lives with passion
and commitment.

1289
01:55:16,306 --> 01:55:18,342
We should be grateful for that.

1290
01:55:22,386 --> 01:55:23,421
Viviane...

1291
01:55:25,186 --> 01:55:28,895
...find some happiness.

1292
01:55:30,786 --> 01:55:36,179
Just a small moment of happiness...

1293
01:55:37,626 --> 01:55:40,936
...that belongs only to you.

1294
01:55:44,986 --> 01:55:47,216
l think the Goddess...

1295
01:55:49,626 --> 01:55:53,255
...lives in our humanity...

1296
01:55:54,306 --> 01:55:57,503
...and not anywhere else.

1297
01:57:43,066 --> 01:57:44,704
Strange as it may seem...

1298
01:57:44,786 --> 01:57:48,540
...in marrying King Uriens
and moving with him to Wales...

1299
01:57:48,626 --> 01:57:52,665
...l won myselfsome of the few years
of happiness my life was to bring me.

1300
01:57:53,746 --> 01:57:55,737
When Accolon came to be with us...

1301
01:57:55,826 --> 01:57:58,659
...it seemed for a while
as if we were a family.

1302
01:58:05,026 --> 01:58:08,382
But far to the north,
under the tutelage ofMorgause...

1303
01:58:08,786 --> 01:58:11,300
...my son Mordred
was growing to manhood.

1304
01:58:11,386 --> 01:58:13,946
A manhood that would destroy us all.

1305
01:58:20,786 --> 01:58:22,424
Stay the horses!

1306
01:58:22,546 --> 01:58:24,025
What is it, my lord?

1307
01:58:30,906 --> 01:58:33,420
Lucius, take these men back to Orkney.

1308
01:58:34,586 --> 01:58:37,146
Take not this road,
but the one that follows the river.

1309
01:58:37,226 --> 01:58:39,262
-l will see you this night.
-Yes, my lord.

1310
01:58:39,346 --> 01:58:40,415
Follow me.

1311
01:59:00,426 --> 01:59:01,302
Viviane.

1312
01:59:01,386 --> 01:59:03,661
-You know me, then.
-Of course.

1313
01:59:04,706 --> 01:59:07,140
l welcome you to Lothian,
Lady of the Lake.

1314
01:59:08,626 --> 01:59:10,856
You act as if you've been expecting me.

1315
01:59:11,346 --> 01:59:13,814
l could feel you long before l could see you.

1316
01:59:14,386 --> 01:59:16,058
You have a plan for me, l think.

1317
01:59:16,146 --> 01:59:18,421
l come in the cause
of the Goddess, Mordred.

1318
01:59:18,506 --> 01:59:19,985
She needs a champion.

1319
01:59:20,306 --> 01:59:22,866
And the question is,
will you be that champion?

1320
01:59:23,346 --> 01:59:25,541
You already have one. His name is Arthur.

1321
01:59:25,986 --> 01:59:28,056
Avalon can no longer rely on Arthur.

1322
01:59:28,786 --> 01:59:32,142
He's dismantled our presence at Camelot,
and he has no heir.

1323
01:59:33,906 --> 01:59:35,658
Will you be that heir?

1324
01:59:36,546 --> 01:59:38,855
Why should anyone acknowledge me...

1325
01:59:38,946 --> 01:59:40,664
...as the High King's heir?

1326
01:59:40,826 --> 01:59:42,703
Because you are his son.

1327
01:59:43,706 --> 01:59:44,980
His son?

1328
01:59:53,866 --> 01:59:55,663
But my mother is his sister.

1329
01:59:56,466 --> 01:59:59,458
The blood of two parents
from the same powerful line...

1330
01:59:59,626 --> 02:00:02,777
...rich in magic, run through you, Mordred.

1331
02:00:02,866 --> 02:00:06,222
You have the power, too, and you know it.

1332
02:00:06,546 --> 02:00:09,902
His son. Arthur's son.

1333
02:00:11,666 --> 02:00:13,418
By his own sister.

1334
02:00:16,026 --> 02:00:19,177
Yes, l have the power.

1335
02:00:20,186 --> 02:00:21,858
l have always known that.

1336
02:00:22,146 --> 02:00:23,943
l can bend men to my will.

1337
02:00:24,666 --> 02:00:28,022
l am placing the future of this land
in your hands, Mordred.

1338
02:00:29,186 --> 02:00:32,622
Will you rise to it, or remain here...

1339
02:00:33,586 --> 02:00:35,542
...powerless in the Scottish wilderness?

1340
02:00:36,586 --> 02:00:38,178
You made me, Aunt...

1341
02:00:38,706 --> 02:00:41,504
...as surely as if you had fashioned me
out of clay.

1342
02:00:42,106 --> 02:00:44,176
What do you think my answer will be?

1343
02:00:54,346 --> 02:00:56,462
Leave me. Leave!

1344
02:01:03,506 --> 02:01:05,144
Why didn't you tell me?

1345
02:01:06,826 --> 02:01:08,657
She's come to you, hasn't she?

1346
02:01:08,906 --> 02:01:10,544
Why didn't you tell me...

1347
02:01:10,746 --> 02:01:12,225
...who my father is?

1348
02:01:12,786 --> 02:01:14,617
l was waiting until you were ready.

1349
02:01:15,066 --> 02:01:17,500
l'm ready. Viviane believes l am ready.

1350
02:01:17,586 --> 02:01:20,419
Viviane! Don't you see
how ruthless she is?

1351
02:01:20,626 --> 02:01:22,935
Breeding you
out of her own niece and nephew?

1352
02:01:23,026 --> 02:01:26,462
Looking 20 years ahead to a time
when she might have use for you.

1353
02:01:28,066 --> 02:01:29,385
But in return...

1354
02:01:29,826 --> 02:01:32,943
...she is placing the reins
of power in my hands.

1355
02:01:33,026 --> 02:01:34,937
Not she alone, Mordred.

1356
02:01:37,226 --> 02:01:38,056
lt was l...

1357
02:01:38,226 --> 02:01:41,821
...who ensured that Arthur and Guinevere
have no son of their own.

1358
02:01:43,546 --> 02:01:45,582
lt was l who cursed her womb.

1359
02:01:51,986 --> 02:01:54,102
So you'd like to see me
on the High Throne...

1360
02:01:56,506 --> 02:01:58,861
...with you as High Queen Mother?

1361
02:02:00,146 --> 02:02:01,101
Yes.

1362
02:02:02,546 --> 02:02:04,457
But nothing can be done now.

1363
02:02:04,906 --> 02:02:06,942
Arthur's flame has never burned brighter.

1364
02:02:07,026 --> 02:02:10,735
Anyone who raises a hand against him
will be torn to pieces by his companions.

1365
02:02:11,266 --> 02:02:13,416
You think l cannot defeat him directly?

1366
02:02:13,546 --> 02:02:15,901
But if you win power that way,
it will not last.

1367
02:02:20,986 --> 02:02:22,055
Listen to wisdom.

1368
02:02:22,506 --> 02:02:25,862
Your enemy is that the king is so loved.

1369
02:02:26,626 --> 02:02:30,585
So, Britain's love of her king
must be made somehow less.

1370
02:02:30,866 --> 02:02:31,901
How?

1371
02:02:32,386 --> 02:02:33,899
He must be discredited.

1372
02:02:36,466 --> 02:02:38,377
No man is without flaws.

1373
02:02:39,866 --> 02:02:43,336
With the king, it concerns his queen.

1374
02:02:46,866 --> 02:02:50,222
l do not like to think that this great king...

1375
02:02:51,586 --> 02:02:55,022
...this great man, my father...

1376
02:02:56,146 --> 02:02:57,465
...is my enemy.

1377
02:02:58,706 --> 02:03:00,537
And that for the sake of Avalon...

1378
02:03:00,626 --> 02:03:03,299
...l must bring him down to nothing.

1379
02:03:05,506 --> 02:03:09,385
l would rather love him as all men do.

1380
02:03:12,146 --> 02:03:14,216
l would like to look on my mother...

1381
02:03:15,346 --> 02:03:18,224
...Lady Morgaine.
l would like to look on her...

1382
02:03:18,546 --> 02:03:21,106
...who bore me as my mother...

1383
02:03:23,226 --> 02:03:26,696
...not as the priestess, or the Goddess.

1384
02:03:28,986 --> 02:03:31,784
l am so weary of gods and goddesses.

1385
02:03:33,586 --> 02:03:35,338
l am weary of my fate.

1386
02:03:40,786 --> 02:03:42,583
Who was yonder old Roman...

1387
02:03:43,626 --> 02:03:46,299
...who said,
''Call no man happy until he is dead''?

1388
02:03:50,506 --> 02:03:51,734
My task then...

1389
02:03:51,826 --> 02:03:56,616
...is to bring that greatest
of all happinesses to my father.

1390
02:04:06,706 --> 02:04:08,185
You will be drunk, dear one.

1391
02:04:08,306 --> 02:04:09,944
So l will be drunk.

1392
02:04:10,066 --> 02:04:11,260
So let it be.

1393
02:04:14,346 --> 02:04:17,304
l drink to death and dishonor.

1394
02:04:32,466 --> 02:04:34,661
''And the Lord God said unto Abraham:

1395
02:04:34,866 --> 02:04:39,337
'''Lo, thou art in thy ninetieth year,
yet l will grant thee a son...

1396
02:04:40,186 --> 02:04:42,461
'''...and from his loins
shall spring a people...

1397
02:04:42,546 --> 02:04:45,583
'''...as numerous as the stars
in the firmament...

1398
02:04:46,266 --> 02:04:48,621
'''...and they shall inherit the earth.'''

1399
02:05:20,266 --> 02:05:22,939
Forgive me, my lord,
l came without announcement.

1400
02:05:25,186 --> 02:05:26,938
Mordred of Lothian.

1401
02:05:27,026 --> 02:05:28,584
l pray only to serve you, sir.

1402
02:05:28,786 --> 02:05:30,663
l've heard of your deeds, lad.

1403
02:05:30,746 --> 02:05:33,738
You've routed Saxon troops
who outnumbered you 7-to-1 .

1404
02:05:33,826 --> 02:05:37,136
l have been questioning those Saxons
who fall into my hands, my lord.

1405
02:05:37,226 --> 02:05:39,899
And l believe they are planning an invasion.

1406
02:05:40,946 --> 02:05:42,937
But they've been peaceful for 10 years.

1407
02:05:43,186 --> 02:05:46,223
They've spent that time building ships.
Hundreds of ships...

1408
02:05:46,866 --> 02:05:50,575
...and if l know the Saxon mind,
this time it won't be petty skirmishes.

1409
02:05:50,666 --> 02:05:53,180
They will take this country
from shore to shore.

1410
02:05:53,266 --> 02:05:55,734
-How could this be?
-lt could be true, sir.

1411
02:05:55,826 --> 02:05:58,101
Saxons have never been as quiet as this.

1412
02:05:58,226 --> 02:05:59,864
l beg of you, sir...

1413
02:06:00,466 --> 02:06:02,696
...grant me the order of knighthood.

1414
02:06:03,466 --> 02:06:05,502
Let me bring my knowledge to your army.

1415
02:06:05,586 --> 02:06:07,702
With my tactics, we will destroy them.

1416
02:06:07,786 --> 02:06:09,105
On my honor.

1417
02:06:17,106 --> 02:06:18,175
My lords...

1418
02:06:18,386 --> 02:06:21,901
...l heard always that a champion's duty
is to meet with all comers.

1419
02:06:23,506 --> 02:06:26,578
Now l have cause
to chastise this impudence.

1420
02:07:07,986 --> 02:07:09,942
Where did you learn to fight like this?

1421
02:07:10,306 --> 02:07:12,297
Are you the son of one of my men?

1422
02:07:12,546 --> 02:07:14,298
Not of one of your men, sir.

1423
02:07:15,706 --> 02:07:17,981
My father was gone
long before l could know him.

1424
02:07:18,386 --> 02:07:19,978
But if you find me familiar...

1425
02:07:20,426 --> 02:07:22,701
...perhaps it is my mother
you see in my face.

1426
02:07:23,506 --> 02:07:24,700
She is your sister...

1427
02:07:25,626 --> 02:07:27,105
...the Lady Morgaine.

1428
02:07:28,186 --> 02:07:33,385
Morgaine's son. l don't believe it.

1429
02:07:34,066 --> 02:07:35,977
She would have spoken of him.

1430
02:07:36,666 --> 02:07:38,622
She would have, my good lady...

1431
02:07:39,106 --> 02:07:41,825
...but that l believe there was
some sadness in my making.

1432
02:07:42,506 --> 02:07:43,905
l was raised at Orkney...

1433
02:07:44,386 --> 02:07:45,705
...by my Aunt Morgause.

1434
02:07:48,306 --> 02:07:51,662
Yet you have that regal air
possessed of Morgaine.

1435
02:07:52,146 --> 02:07:56,059
Who but the son of my sister
would have marched in here like that?

1436
02:07:56,466 --> 02:08:00,175
l can see by your face beyond doubt,
that you are hers.

1437
02:08:01,586 --> 02:08:04,783
Welcome to my court, lad, and to my table.

1438
02:08:13,186 --> 02:08:15,256
Sit with me and tell me everything.

1439
02:08:15,346 --> 02:08:18,019
We shall stay up till morning
getting to know each other.

1440
02:08:18,106 --> 02:08:20,745
Men, welcome my nephew.

1441
02:08:21,386 --> 02:08:22,705
He is one of us.

1442
02:08:31,626 --> 02:08:33,582
When King Uriens died...

1443
02:08:34,066 --> 02:08:36,341
...l could not stop thinking of Avalon.

1444
02:08:39,906 --> 02:08:42,295
l knew that one phase
of my life was over...

1445
02:08:42,586 --> 02:08:45,020
...and a new one was about to begin.

1446
02:08:46,186 --> 02:08:48,541
And much though l still loved Accolon...

1447
02:08:48,666 --> 02:08:51,464
...l knew, too, he could not be a part of it.

1448
02:08:52,986 --> 02:08:53,975
Morgaine.

1449
02:08:55,466 --> 02:08:57,616
This was your father's favorite view.

1450
02:09:01,466 --> 02:09:02,945
l'll be leaving soon.

1451
02:09:05,866 --> 02:09:07,094
You could stay.

1452
02:09:10,106 --> 02:09:11,175
Thank you.

1453
02:09:14,666 --> 02:09:17,180
But every time l look at you, l'll see him.

1454
02:09:19,706 --> 02:09:21,105
Where will you go?

1455
02:09:25,386 --> 02:09:27,058
l must go back to Avalon.

1456
02:09:36,506 --> 02:09:39,543
But ifl thought the Mother Goddess
would make it easy for me...

1457
02:09:39,626 --> 02:09:41,696
...to come to terms with Viviane...

1458
02:09:41,946 --> 02:09:43,174
...l was wrong.

1459
02:10:26,866 --> 02:10:28,265
The Saxons are upon us.

1460
02:10:32,746 --> 02:10:33,895
Fight!

1461
02:12:26,786 --> 02:12:30,665
My men tell me the invasion will come
before the next full moon, my lord.

1462
02:12:31,306 --> 02:12:32,944
We are ready for them.

1463
02:12:33,746 --> 02:12:35,179
Except in one respect.

1464
02:12:35,266 --> 02:12:36,699
And that is?

1465
02:12:36,786 --> 02:12:39,425
lf you were to die in battle, sir.

1466
02:12:43,626 --> 02:12:45,264
Well, you would fight on.

1467
02:12:45,426 --> 02:12:46,859
Lancelot would fight on.

1468
02:12:46,946 --> 02:12:49,301
All my brave companions would fight on.

1469
02:12:50,226 --> 02:12:52,820
And which of them
would become High King, sire?

1470
02:12:53,866 --> 02:12:55,618
You have no designated successor.

1471
02:12:55,706 --> 02:12:59,335
l cannot designate a successor
when my queen might yet bear me an heir.

1472
02:13:03,106 --> 02:13:05,062
lt is a hope she clings to.

1473
02:13:05,866 --> 02:13:07,663
l will not rob her of that.

1474
02:13:07,866 --> 02:13:09,902
Whatever the cost to your kingdom?

1475
02:13:10,746 --> 02:13:13,055
lf l choose someone
not of my own descent...

1476
02:13:13,266 --> 02:13:14,858
...it will split the companions.

1477
02:13:14,946 --> 02:13:17,779
There will be war between us
and the Saxons would prevail.

1478
02:13:18,466 --> 02:13:20,616
Then choose someone
of your own descent, sir.

1479
02:13:23,906 --> 02:13:25,419
l am your son.

1480
02:13:30,946 --> 02:13:34,382
l am your son.

1481
02:13:40,266 --> 02:13:42,382
But Morgaine is your mother.

1482
02:13:43,626 --> 02:13:47,619
lt was she that you slept with
in the great marriage.

1483
02:13:49,426 --> 02:13:51,576
She was the virgin huntress.

1484
02:13:54,066 --> 02:13:55,943
You coupled with her...

1485
02:13:56,666 --> 02:13:59,021
...and together you conceived a child.

1486
02:14:00,586 --> 02:14:03,259
l am that child, come now to demand...

1487
02:14:03,346 --> 02:14:05,496
...that which is my due!

1488
02:14:06,666 --> 02:14:10,545
No, it's not true. lt's not true.

1489
02:14:11,506 --> 02:14:14,543
You're lying to force Arthur
to promote you beyond your merits.

1490
02:14:15,746 --> 02:14:18,385
Arthur, tell him it's not true.

1491
02:14:18,586 --> 02:14:19,860
Tell him you never....

1492
02:14:22,946 --> 02:14:24,265
You never....

1493
02:14:28,466 --> 02:14:29,945
He cannot tell you...

1494
02:14:30,426 --> 02:14:34,624
...because he knows what l say is true.

1495
02:14:40,106 --> 02:14:43,655
Then all this time
when l could not give you a child....

1496
02:15:27,266 --> 02:15:28,779
Mordred is his son.

1497
02:15:31,706 --> 02:15:33,025
For many years...

1498
02:15:34,146 --> 02:15:36,137
...l gave myself to my husband...

1499
02:15:37,266 --> 02:15:39,063
...in the name of our Lord.

1500
02:15:39,826 --> 02:15:44,946
For many years,
we prayed to fashion life within me.

1501
02:15:48,306 --> 02:15:51,025
But it seems that God
has not heard those prayers.

1502
02:15:57,506 --> 02:15:58,985
Perhaps He has heard...

1503
02:16:02,386 --> 02:16:03,819
...but did not will it.

1504
02:16:05,106 --> 02:16:06,937
But what did He will instead?

1505
02:16:09,466 --> 02:16:11,104
That a bastard child...

1506
02:16:12,026 --> 02:16:14,381
...sprung from an incestuous bed...

1507
02:16:15,106 --> 02:16:18,462
...should triumph
over our tireless devotion.

1508
02:16:20,426 --> 02:16:23,463
They say His ways are unknowable.

1509
02:16:25,346 --> 02:16:26,381
Of course.

1510
02:16:28,346 --> 02:16:31,099
l am too small to understand
the will of God.

1511
02:16:33,266 --> 02:16:34,460
Do you think...

1512
02:16:35,826 --> 02:16:38,977
...l'm being punished
for the night we spent together?

1513
02:16:41,746 --> 02:16:44,897
l don't think it's God who punishes us.

1514
02:16:47,186 --> 02:16:48,938
l think we punish ourselves.

1515
02:16:53,106 --> 02:16:55,336
Would it not be a comfort to believe...

1516
02:16:55,906 --> 02:16:57,385
...just for a time...

1517
02:16:58,186 --> 02:17:02,225
...that we create our own heavens
and our own hells?

1518
02:17:09,586 --> 02:17:11,144
lt would be a comfort.

1519
02:17:15,026 --> 02:17:16,459
lt would, Lancelot.

1520
02:17:16,946 --> 02:17:20,382
Maybe God does not grant you
all the comforts you ask of Him...

1521
02:17:21,586 --> 02:17:24,259
...but offers you others
which you refuse to see.

1522
02:17:26,866 --> 02:17:30,461
Maybe you should find the comforts
He does offer you...

1523
02:17:31,106 --> 02:17:34,542
...my dear lady, and accept them.

1524
02:18:35,186 --> 02:18:39,338
Wounded and weary,
at last l arrived at the borders of Avalon.

1525
02:18:42,866 --> 02:18:45,061
l felt somehow l had never left.

1526
02:19:26,386 --> 02:19:28,104
But then l realized...

1527
02:19:28,186 --> 02:19:31,098
...the power l once prevailed over
had left me...

1528
02:19:31,186 --> 02:19:33,142
...a long time ago.

1529
02:19:34,306 --> 02:19:36,297
l was stranded on the outside...

1530
02:19:36,786 --> 02:19:38,504
...like a child locked out.

1531
02:19:39,666 --> 02:19:41,304
Viviane had forsaken me.

1532
02:19:50,346 --> 02:19:53,702
Then l heard a sound
l had not heard for years:

1533
02:19:54,426 --> 02:19:56,144
The bell of Glastonbury.

1534
02:20:36,906 --> 02:20:38,055
My daughter!

1535
02:20:55,746 --> 02:20:57,976
Where have you been, my child?

1536
02:20:58,066 --> 02:20:59,943
l've had such sadness.

1537
02:21:12,506 --> 02:21:13,461
Come.

1538
02:21:59,666 --> 02:22:01,179
Lancelot?

1539
02:22:05,026 --> 02:22:06,300
Wrong.

1540
02:22:32,466 --> 02:22:33,660
Run!

1541
02:22:43,506 --> 02:22:44,575
Mordred...

1542
02:22:44,786 --> 02:22:46,538
...such a trick is worthy of you.

1543
02:22:46,626 --> 02:22:50,175
ln the king's name, Lancelot,
l accuse you of high treason.

1544
02:22:50,866 --> 02:22:55,018
Gawain, in God's name,
how could you lend yourself to this?

1545
02:22:55,186 --> 02:22:56,699
l never believed it of you.

1546
02:22:57,426 --> 02:23:00,782
l were to God l had fallen in battle
before ever l saw this day.

1547
02:23:01,746 --> 02:23:02,940
Dress yourself.

1548
02:23:03,026 --> 02:23:06,063
l will not take you so disgraced
into Arthur's presence.

1549
02:23:06,506 --> 02:23:08,656
Enough men have witnessed your shame.

1550
02:23:12,786 --> 02:23:15,858
l'm glad for your sake
that you would come with us quietly.

1551
02:23:16,626 --> 02:23:17,581
Mother?

1552
02:23:26,786 --> 02:23:28,060
See to the queen.

1553
02:23:28,346 --> 02:23:31,179
She'll be in your hands
until Arthur deals with her.

1554
02:23:33,066 --> 02:23:35,296
Come along, my lady. Get into your gown.

1555
02:23:35,386 --> 02:23:38,742
You do not want to go shameless
before the king, do you?

1556
02:23:39,026 --> 02:23:40,778
Get me your sword, Lancelot.

1557
02:24:02,946 --> 02:24:03,935
Come.

1558
02:24:06,586 --> 02:24:07,655
Stop!

1559
02:24:07,826 --> 02:24:08,975
Let them go.

1560
02:24:09,426 --> 02:24:11,542
lt is for the king to decide their fate now.

1561
02:24:16,746 --> 02:24:19,180
No man in all of Britain
will hide them now.

1562
02:24:34,946 --> 02:24:36,425
They have defied you.

1563
02:24:36,706 --> 02:24:38,776
He has slain one of your most loyal men.

1564
02:24:38,866 --> 02:24:41,744
l love them both.
l will not hunt after them.

1565
02:24:44,106 --> 02:24:45,255
l beg you, my lord.

1566
02:24:45,386 --> 02:24:47,741
Lancelot has committed treason.

1567
02:24:47,826 --> 02:24:51,899
Treason against the Crown, to which l have
sworn allegiance, sworn with my life!

1568
02:24:51,986 --> 02:24:54,261
Lancelot and Guinevere are a part of me.

1569
02:24:55,186 --> 02:24:58,178
Do not ask me to tear into my own flesh.

1570
02:24:58,626 --> 02:25:00,184
lf you do nothing, Father...

1571
02:25:00,266 --> 02:25:03,702
...you will lose the confidence
of your army and your men.

1572
02:25:04,306 --> 02:25:06,740
You will cease to be High King
in anything but name.

1573
02:25:08,946 --> 02:25:10,902
l have not the heart for it.

1574
02:25:13,466 --> 02:25:16,139
l have no choice
but to leave this in your hands.

1575
02:25:32,786 --> 02:25:35,539
l cannot bear to say goodbye
to you here, my lady.

1576
02:25:37,146 --> 02:25:41,742
l am no longer any man's wife, or lover.

1577
02:25:46,386 --> 02:25:49,423
From this point on,
l give my heart to no one except God.

1578
02:25:52,706 --> 02:25:54,059
l've lost my king.

1579
02:25:55,186 --> 02:25:57,620
l've lost my honor, and now--

1580
02:26:12,666 --> 02:26:14,702
That day l saw you on the stones.

1581
02:26:16,786 --> 02:26:18,458
That bell was also ringing.

1582
02:26:20,986 --> 02:26:22,180
Remember?

1583
02:26:24,786 --> 02:26:26,378
How could l forget?

1584
02:26:29,066 --> 02:26:30,863
So innocent we were.

1585
02:26:58,946 --> 02:27:00,015
l pray...

1586
02:27:00,906 --> 02:27:02,464
...there is a heaven...

1587
02:27:03,826 --> 02:27:06,101
...and that you would be an angel in it...

1588
02:27:06,186 --> 02:27:10,065
...so when l die, we can be together at last.

1589
02:27:49,506 --> 02:27:51,178
l knew you'd come.

1590
02:27:58,106 --> 02:28:01,894
Mother Superior,
l come seeking forgiveness.

1591
02:28:02,746 --> 02:28:05,658
And this is the place
where you shall find it.

1592
02:28:09,466 --> 02:28:12,503
Suffering brings women to God.

1593
02:28:51,866 --> 02:28:53,504
When you left Camelot...

1594
02:28:54,626 --> 02:28:56,298
...Arthur missed you so.

1595
02:28:57,786 --> 02:29:00,175
l have often thought my greatest sin...

1596
02:29:00,346 --> 02:29:03,895
...was coming between the love
that you and Arthur have for each other.

1597
02:29:04,826 --> 02:29:06,384
How is my dear brother?

1598
02:29:07,426 --> 02:29:08,939
He is in great danger.

1599
02:29:09,506 --> 02:29:11,064
He has need of you now.

1600
02:29:11,386 --> 02:29:14,139
Why? What's happened?

1601
02:29:14,826 --> 02:29:18,057
lt is your son, Mordred.

1602
02:29:29,106 --> 02:29:30,664
As l raced back to Camelot...

1603
02:29:30,746 --> 02:29:33,260
...to be with my brother
in his hour of need...

1604
02:29:33,386 --> 02:29:35,980
...l saw people fleeing from the coasts.

1605
02:29:47,986 --> 02:29:51,137
The final assault of the Saxons
had at last begun.

1606
02:29:55,786 --> 02:29:58,539
lt was at that moment
that l finally encountered...

1607
02:29:58,946 --> 02:30:00,937
...the one person l had given up hope...

1608
02:30:01,026 --> 02:30:02,618
...of ever seeing again.

1609
02:30:16,146 --> 02:30:18,137
l was behind you much of the way.

1610
02:30:21,266 --> 02:30:23,734
l was proud and unforgiving.

1611
02:30:25,746 --> 02:30:27,816
l may have turned my back on you...

1612
02:30:28,106 --> 02:30:30,666
...but my heart never turned.

1613
02:30:36,146 --> 02:30:39,661
l destroyed something between us
in the name of the Goddess.

1614
02:30:41,706 --> 02:30:45,062
Now l fear l have destroyed
something else in her name.

1615
02:30:46,386 --> 02:30:50,220
Will Camelot and Avalon
disappear into the mists?

1616
02:30:54,586 --> 02:30:57,100
l see a land that runs red with blood...

1617
02:30:57,666 --> 02:30:59,019
...where chaos rules.

1618
02:31:03,106 --> 02:31:04,778
lt is the end of an age.

1619
02:31:13,266 --> 02:31:17,544
l thought that l knew what to expect
when Viviane and l reached Camelot.

1620
02:31:18,186 --> 02:31:21,098
But it was beyond anything
either of us had imagined.

1621
02:31:46,386 --> 02:31:48,854
l am Morgaine, sister to the king.

1622
02:31:50,066 --> 02:31:51,704
Where is my brother?

1623
02:31:53,466 --> 02:31:55,377
Where is Arthur Pendragon?

1624
02:32:07,986 --> 02:32:08,941
Mother.

1625
02:32:11,506 --> 02:32:12,621
What a surprise.

1626
02:32:22,226 --> 02:32:25,901
So you came to see Arthur and not me?

1627
02:32:27,986 --> 02:32:29,624
You came to see your brother...

1628
02:32:30,186 --> 02:32:32,541
...and not the son you bore him.

1629
02:32:44,946 --> 02:32:47,016
Welcome to the new Camelot.

1630
02:32:47,986 --> 02:32:49,704
This is an abomination.

1631
02:32:51,106 --> 02:32:52,698
l thought you would be proud.

1632
02:32:52,946 --> 02:32:55,141
We are keeping the ways
of the Goddess alive.

1633
02:32:55,546 --> 02:32:57,662
These are not the ways of the Goddess.

1634
02:32:57,746 --> 02:32:59,816
You think you know her ways
better than l?

1635
02:33:00,786 --> 02:33:03,664
You always got it all,
while l was left with nothing.

1636
02:33:04,786 --> 02:33:06,822
But someone was watching out for me...

1637
02:33:08,146 --> 02:33:10,182
...and what god it is l care not.

1638
02:33:12,666 --> 02:33:14,338
The tribesmen only follow you...

1639
02:33:14,426 --> 02:33:17,896
...because you have the Pendragon banner
hanging over their heads.

1640
02:33:24,386 --> 02:33:26,502
l am the Lady of the Lake.

1641
02:33:29,426 --> 02:33:31,940
l am the High Priestess of Avalon...

1642
02:33:36,146 --> 02:33:38,580
...and l declare she has been deceiving you.

1643
02:33:43,186 --> 02:33:44,539
This is not Avalon.

1644
02:33:46,906 --> 02:33:49,466
This is not the will of the Goddess l serve.

1645
02:33:50,946 --> 02:33:52,425
This is her will...

1646
02:33:55,226 --> 02:33:57,694
...and it is murder and perversion.

1647
02:33:59,506 --> 02:34:01,576
My sister is an evil sorceress...

1648
02:34:02,066 --> 02:34:04,261
...intent on destroying all that is Camelot.

1649
02:36:42,226 --> 02:36:45,059
Now, bring me to the king!

1650
02:36:52,786 --> 02:36:53,935
ls it you?

1651
02:36:57,386 --> 02:36:59,024
ls it really you?

1652
02:37:08,466 --> 02:37:10,058
You've come back to me.

1653
02:37:16,546 --> 02:37:21,017
My sister,
why did you not tell me about our child?

1654
02:37:22,466 --> 02:37:25,026
Why did you bear the burden all alone?

1655
02:37:25,586 --> 02:37:29,261
The pain of it would have been
no less for me had l shared it with you.

1656
02:37:31,146 --> 02:37:32,818
You always looked after me.

1657
02:37:33,026 --> 02:37:36,621
l've done my duty,
and now you must do yours.

1658
02:37:38,106 --> 02:37:39,983
What duty remains for me to do?

1659
02:37:40,106 --> 02:37:43,701
You must protect your land
against the Saxon invasion...

1660
02:37:43,786 --> 02:37:46,175
...the likes of which l've never seen before.

1661
02:37:47,546 --> 02:37:49,821
l'm a sinner and l'm weak.

1662
02:37:49,906 --> 02:37:51,544
We have both sinned.

1663
02:37:52,026 --> 02:37:55,701
Are we going to let those sins drag us
down, as some priests would have it...

1664
02:37:55,826 --> 02:37:58,863
...and send us crawling on our knees
begging forgiveness...

1665
02:37:58,946 --> 02:38:03,064
...or are we going to rise above them and
do what we were put on this earth to do?

1666
02:38:04,506 --> 02:38:06,417
What were we put on this earth to do?

1667
02:38:06,706 --> 02:38:10,062
You were put on this earth
to lead your people, Arthur.

1668
02:38:10,226 --> 02:38:11,181
Stand!

1669
02:38:11,426 --> 02:38:14,896
The Saxon invasion has begun.
They have lined our shores.

1670
02:38:15,026 --> 02:38:16,618
They will take down Camelot.

1671
02:38:16,786 --> 02:38:20,540
You must ride out now,
even if it's the last battle you ever fight.

1672
02:38:20,626 --> 02:38:23,538
You must bring
one last note of glory to Avalon.

1673
02:38:44,986 --> 02:38:47,864
And so Arthur and the remnants
of the Round Table...

1674
02:38:48,626 --> 02:38:50,696
...rode out for their last battle.

1675
02:40:53,106 --> 02:40:55,017
We will fight as we always did.

1676
02:40:57,146 --> 02:40:59,296
As we always did, my friend.

1677
02:41:41,106 --> 02:41:42,698
He's joined the Saxons.

1678
02:41:46,746 --> 02:41:48,304
Our Father in heaven...

1679
02:41:49,186 --> 02:41:51,336
...and our Mother of the earth...

1680
02:41:51,986 --> 02:41:54,022
...soon l shall be taken into Your house.

1681
02:41:57,266 --> 02:41:59,541
Let me be fit to wear Your robes.

1682
02:41:59,826 --> 02:42:02,294
Let the sword that l die by cleanse me.

1683
02:42:06,066 --> 02:42:09,183
And if there is honor
in the course you have set for me...

1684
02:42:09,866 --> 02:42:11,504
...let me earn it today.

1685
02:45:19,986 --> 02:45:21,465
Mordred!

1686
02:45:27,066 --> 02:45:27,816
Father.

1687
02:45:40,586 --> 02:45:42,861
The Goddess holds everything in balance.

1688
02:45:43,146 --> 02:45:46,855
Without her,
destruction and chaos will prevail.

1689
02:45:48,466 --> 02:45:49,819
Bring me my horse.

1690
02:46:38,106 --> 02:46:39,698
Why have you become my enemy?

1691
02:46:41,746 --> 02:46:45,022
You truly believe that l was ever
anything else, my father?

1692
02:48:26,026 --> 02:48:27,254
Mother.

1693
02:49:18,546 --> 02:49:20,423
Lancelot.

1694
02:49:23,386 --> 02:49:25,183
Take me home, Sister.

1695
02:49:28,066 --> 02:49:29,419
Take me to Avalon.

1696
02:49:44,986 --> 02:49:47,420
Though Avalon had already rejected me...

1697
02:49:48,106 --> 02:49:49,903
...l felt its strange power...

1698
02:49:49,986 --> 02:49:53,535
...as it drew the dying king and l
back towards its sacred shores.

1699
02:49:55,186 --> 02:49:57,780
l began to doubt
we would ever reach Avalon.

1700
02:49:58,226 --> 02:49:59,898
Perhaps, for our disobedience...

1701
02:49:59,986 --> 02:50:02,375
...we would be lost
in this limbo of mist forever.

1702
02:50:03,706 --> 02:50:05,856
Or perhaps, with Viviane's death...

1703
02:50:06,586 --> 02:50:08,577
...it had simply disappeared.

1704
02:51:00,466 --> 02:51:02,696
Are we shut out of Avalon, Sister?

1705
02:51:04,906 --> 02:51:07,500
l fear the Goddess
has rejected us, Arthur...

1706
02:51:08,546 --> 02:51:10,184
...as we rejected her.

1707
02:51:11,906 --> 02:51:13,737
Perhaps she needs an offering.

1708
02:51:29,026 --> 02:51:30,982
Give it back to the Goddess, Morgaine.

1709
02:51:33,426 --> 02:51:35,178
lt belongs to her now.

1710
02:52:22,386 --> 02:52:23,865
We are home, Arthur.

1711
02:52:42,266 --> 02:52:43,699
My little brother...

1712
02:52:46,626 --> 02:52:47,695
...my love.

1713
02:52:50,706 --> 02:52:51,900
We're home.

1714
02:53:22,866 --> 02:53:25,175
Avalon faded from the world of men...

1715
02:53:25,346 --> 02:53:28,702
...and only Glastonbury marked
where its wonders had been.

1716
02:53:31,466 --> 02:53:34,344
The Saxons overran Britain
and made it their own...

1717
02:53:34,626 --> 02:53:36,582
...and the Goddess was forgotten.

1718
02:53:37,426 --> 02:53:40,224
Or so l was convinced for many years.

1719
02:53:56,946 --> 02:53:58,140
Virgin Mary...

1720
02:53:58,386 --> 02:54:00,946
...Mother of God, pray for me.

1721
02:54:06,146 --> 02:54:10,025
Until at last l realized
the Goddess had survived.

1722
02:54:10,866 --> 02:54:12,743
She had not been destroyed...

1723
02:54:12,826 --> 02:54:15,499
...but had simply adopted
another incarnation.

1724
02:54:16,466 --> 02:54:18,377
And perhaps, one day...

1725
02:54:18,626 --> 02:54:21,743
...future generations
will be able to bring her back...

1726
02:54:21,866 --> 02:54:23,424
...as we knew her...

1727
02:54:23,666 --> 02:54:25,577
...in the glory of Avalon.
