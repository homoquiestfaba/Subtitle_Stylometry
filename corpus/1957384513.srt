1
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,036
Welcome, Monster Fans,
to another episode

2
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:13,372
of spooky, yet true,
cryptid encounter tales.

3
00:01:28,287 --> 00:01:30,556
In recent weeks,
you've met the Minerva Monster,

4
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:33,926
the Bray Road Beast and even
that mean old son of a gun,

5
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,494
the Boggy Creek Monster.

6
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,630
But this week,
I'm gonna introduce you

7
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:38,698
to the weirdest creature

8
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,900
that's ever walked out of the forest.

9
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:45,638
He's big, he's hairy,
he's scary and his name is Momo.

10
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,446
Is that it? Is that the creature?

11
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,680
It's time to find out!

12
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:06,158
As we do each week on
"Blackburn's Cryptid Case Files",

13
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,195
I'm gonna introduce you to a
schlocky film inspired

14
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:12,264
by the creepy critter I'll be
investigating in this episode.

15
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,469
Let's set the stage for the
film you're about to watch.

16
00:02:16,502 --> 00:02:18,037
In the early 1970s,

17
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,272
a filmmaker by the name of
Charles B. Pierce

18
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,841
made an independent horror movie

19
00:02:21,874 --> 00:02:25,044
about a monster roaming the
swamps of Southern Arkansas.

20
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:27,413
It was called
"The Legend of Boggy Creek"

21
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:29,248
and it was made for very
little money,

22
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:32,184
but quickly became a hit on
the drive in movie circuit.

23
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,320
Before you could say the word Bigfoot,

24
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,655
all sorts of hairy ape like
monster movies

25
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,591
begin clogging the cinemas.

26
00:02:38,624 --> 00:02:40,226
Most of them were made on a dime

27
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,928
and most of them were
downright terrible.

28
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,630
Suddenly, anyone with a camera

29
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,633
and a crappy ape suit could
make a movie, you see.

30
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:51,504
So it was, in 1975, a film
crew set out to make a movie

31
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,906
about another famous hairy monster.

32
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,442
In fact,
the hairiest monster ever seen

33
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:59,845
outside the distant jungles
of Africa, Momo,

34
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,847
Missouri's own monster.

35
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,216
The film crew shot and edited
the film,

36
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,853
but for some unknown reason,
never released it.

37
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,256
Boy, do I have a treat for
you tonight.

38
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,893
I've searched far and wide to
track down the only known copy

39
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:15,561
of the original film.

40
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:18,664
That's right, we're gonna
show it right here tonight

41
00:03:18,697 --> 00:03:20,833
and together we're gonna
explore Missouri

42
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:23,169
and get to the bottom of this
real case

43
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:26,505
that inspired this should have
been B movie cult classic.

44
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,375
So like I always say,
spin the reel.

45
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,331
I can't believe you're
dragging me eight hours

46
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,000
to see Alice Cooper!

47
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,401
Disgusting!

48
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:45,204
Couldn't we have waited and
seen The Carpenters instead?

49
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:47,673
This is exactly what I'm
talkin' about!

50
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:49,108
You need more culture.

51
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:50,309
Culture!

52
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:53,212
He bites the heads off of
chickens and drinks their blood!

53
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:54,046
Oh, please.

54
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,147
That's a story our parents
made up

55
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,082
because they think our
psyches are too fragile

56
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,817
to handle being scared a little.

57
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,186
He gets attacked by monsters
during his shows

58
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,454
and you're scared of a dead bird?

59
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,690
Salmonella is very real.

60
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:08,060
Monsters in tacky suits,
not so much.

61
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:10,863
Great, I knew you were a nerd,

62
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:12,131
but a biologist to boot,

63
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,068
this is gonna be a longer
trip than I thought.

64
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:17,936
Hey, I think I see a spot up ahead.

65
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,706
You hungry, Professor?

66
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,808
Whatever, as long as it's not chicken.

67
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,921
Let's go.
All right.

68
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,177
Joan.
Hmm?

69
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,778
Do you hear that?

70
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,185
I don't hear anything.

71
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,020
Do you smell that?

72
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:14,927
What kind of creature makes a
smell like.

73
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,630
What, Joan?

74
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,032
What is it?

75
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:21,633
What, Joan?

76
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,803
What is it?

77
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:29,375
Joan!

78
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:45,791
No, no, no, no!
Don't get in the car!

79
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,217
Go on you creature!

80
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,824
Oh, my gosh!

81
00:09:18,857 --> 00:09:20,325
I'm going for it.

82
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,326
Oh, Mary, you can't!

83
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,095
That thing is still out there!

84
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:25,597
I know but we need the keys.

85
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,765
And the girl that's afraid of chickens

86
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,101
is actin' like one herself at
the moment!

87
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,112
Joan!

88
00:09:40,145 --> 00:09:42,748
Oh, hurry!

89
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:46,151
Oh, my gosh, hurry!
It's all right!

90
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,995
What's wrong?
It's not moving!

91
00:10:06,538 --> 00:10:08,941
No, no, no!

92
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:16,915
Oh, my God!

93
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,771
This is Louisiana, Missouri,

94
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,642
a town where nothing much
ever happens until it does.

95
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,712
Missouri is my kind of state.

96
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:50,849
It's drenched in history,
a lot of it bloody, messy stuff.

97
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,752
It's also home to some of the
downright weirdest stories

98
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,754
you're ever likely to hear.

99
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:57,623
What's really strange, though,

100
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,525
is that a good number of
these stories come

101
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,059
from right here in this town.

102
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:04,196
Located in Northeast Missouri,

103
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,965
the quaint, bucolic community
of Louisiana is pretty much

104
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,300
just a river town.

105
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,669
You see, the Mississippi runs
right along here.

106
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:15,340
This proximity to such a
major waterway became

107
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,876
one of Louisiana's largest
sources of income.

108
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,716
The town was founded in 1816
by John Walter Basye

109
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,985
and the town's history is
largely connected

110
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,321
to the earliest pioneers who
made their way here

111
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,823
during the great western expansion.

112
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,859
You know,
Manifest Destiny and all that.

113
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:49,741
Okay, yeah, just state your name.

114
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:53,478
Willard Wamsley from Louisiana,
the Louisiana area.

115
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:57,516
John Wood, from Louisiana, Missouri.

116
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:04,289
1818 was when we got our charter

117
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,159
and it was started just by
people who'd migrated in here

118
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:08,860
and then they got their charter

119
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,296
and it became a river town.

120
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,866
How it was named was a
gentleman here in town,

121
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,469
it was named after his daughter.

122
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,605
And then of course the
Louisiana Purchase

123
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,640
and then Louisiana came in.

124
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,909
I think we had

125
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,845
12 taverns

126
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,816
and just as many lawyers at
one time,

127
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:32,784
and that kinda made the town go.

128
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,153
When the river was more important

129
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,722
and rail was more important,

130
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,057
why Louisiana was a goin' place.

131
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,026
We had it all.

132
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:42,694
Of course,
all the communities around,

133
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,296
if they were gonna ship their product,

134
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,064
they had to come to Louisiana.

135
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,000
The railroad and the river,

136
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,769
both kinda put Louisiana on
the map.

137
00:12:50,802 --> 00:12:54,573
Where it is,
where it sits is very convenient

138
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:58,276
to both the river transportation
and always has been.

139
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,420
My name is Martha Sue Zook Smith.

140
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:13,392
I don't know that the
financial situation of

141
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:18,430
this part of our Pike County
is any more financially

142
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,932
than the rest of the country.

143
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,402
I know that at one time

144
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:27,906
Louisiana had lots and lots
of factories.

145
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:32,844
They had big import/export
type out of Louisiana

146
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:37,449
with the coming of the
railroad and river transportation.

147
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:40,052
It just was different.

148
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,988
I'm afraid I can't put it on

149
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,459
any basis particularly,
it just it is different.

150
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,730
If you're talkin' about what
was really big,

151
00:13:51,763 --> 00:13:55,000
tobacco, what is it, Tins..
Tinsley Twis.

152
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:58,270
That was a brand of tobacco,
chewing tobacco.

153
00:13:58,303 --> 00:14:00,505
So it was a big deal.

154
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,674
I don't expect to see any of
that again,

155
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,609
so we'll just have to make do.

156
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,579
We're either gonna get better
or we're not.

157
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:10,749
And if we don't we're in trouble,

158
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:13,085
along with a lot of other
little towns.

159
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:25,997
Star Hill is one of the big
hills in Louisiana

160
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,767
and as far as I know, forever,

161
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:31,470
of course I don't mean that,

162
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,840
but as far as I know, every Christmas,

163
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:38,143
the huge big star lights up
at night

164
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:42,047
and that is known as Star Hill.

165
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,549
I've got some tales about
Star Hill, too.

166
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,487
When I was a young girl,

167
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,756
we had a Samoyed dog.

168
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,824
Samoyed's are beautiful.

169
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:56,795
His name was Malla and he
wandered up to Star Hill

170
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,598
and somehow got poisoned

171
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:02,367
and died on Star Hill.

172
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,770
Star Hill is Marzolf Hill, right?

173
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,439
Yes, okay.

174
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,408
I know the names, but I don't.

175
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,713
Like I said,
this area has had it's fair share

176
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:16,214
of weird stories.

177
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,984
UFO's have always played a
part in local legends,

178
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:22,888
but spooky tales extend far
beyond mere lights in the sky.

179
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:26,925
There's ghosts,
huge winged birds and even monsters.

180
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,195
In 1869, residents of Macon, Missouri,

181
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:32,597
a mere 100 miles from Louisiana,

182
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:36,301
were tormented by a creature
they began calling the Devil.

183
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:39,070
The thing was said to be
taller than any man,

184
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,506
yet stood upright like one.

185
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,442
After weeks of harassment,
the locals formed a posse

186
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,646
and went in search of the
Devil and they found it.

187
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,447
A furious battle ensued,

188
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,449
in which a handful of hunting
dogs were killed

189
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,852
by the beast before it
finally made its escape

190
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:54,986
in a nearby river.

191
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,923
It was seen exiting the river
on the opposite bank

192
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,991
before disappearing into the woods.

193
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,294
And that wasn't the last of
such reports, either.

194
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:05,297
In 1968, Springfield,
Missouri was stalked

195
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,566
by a hairy, eight foot tall creature

196
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,001
that terrorized young boys
and motorists.

197
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,571
The creature was seen around
the quite town of Springfield

198
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,740
for several days until it
finally vanished.

199
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,076
So yes, Missouri has its fair share

200
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:20,045
of hairy monsters and legends.

201
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,415
And the most famous of these
legends was born right here

202
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:26,318
on this very hill in 1972.

203
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,668
Help!

204
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:47,239
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

205
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,641
I got you!
I got you first!

206
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,579
Who are you?

207
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:58,149
I am..
I shall take over the world!

208
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,185
And I shall save the world!

209
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:08,793
I won, I won!

210
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,797
Yeah!

211
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,833
I don't know how you can do that

212
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:18,703
when I am victorious!

213
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,207
Come on, is that all you got?

214
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,910
No, I got powers and..

215
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,915
Yeah!

216
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:34,920
You will not win this one!

217
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:54,906
Harry?

218
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,781
We saw the boogeyman!

219
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:10,615
We saw the boogeyman!

220
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,650
We saw him, we saw him!

221
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:13,885
Doris, there's a monster out there!

222
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:16,421
Doris, there's a monster in
the woods!

223
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:19,624
I know, Terry, I know.

224
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,625
I saw it, too.

225
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,827
There, there, Wally.

226
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,096
It's all right, it's all right!

227
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,798
That thing can't find you in here.

228
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:30,101
Listen, you two, stay inside!

229
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,904
Just try to calm down, okay?

230
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:34,372
Let me see if I can call Dad.

231
00:19:52,657 --> 00:19:53,591
Harrison's Diner.

232
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:58,596
Dor, Doris, Honey, slow down,
what did you?

233
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,465
A monster dog?

234
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:02,567
Hold on.

235
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,435
Edgar!

236
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,405
Sweetie, just tell me, yeah,

237
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,140
tell your father what you
told me.

238
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:12,143
Doris?

239
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:14,546
Hey.

240
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:16,414
Okay, yeah.

241
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,750
Okay, okay, I see.

242
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:20,919
Can it wait until I get home?

243
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:23,154
No, okay, all right.

244
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,023
All right, give me just a second

245
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:27,125
and I'll be back there in a
little, okay?

246
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:27,992
Okay, bye.

247
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:31,696
Do you want me to go with you?
I mean, we can close up early.

248
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:33,531
No, no, no, no, it's okay.

249
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,800
It's probably just one of the
neighbor kids messing around.

250
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,669
They're always doing stuff
like that.

251
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:40,271
I'll head back and check on her
and check out things at the house.

252
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,040
And then you stay here,
watch the restaurant

253
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:44,309
and I'll be back in a little
bit to help you close up, okay?

254
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,178
Dad, it was seven feet tall!

255
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:21,779
It was black and hairy!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

256
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:22,814
It was all black and hairy!
Everyone calm down.

257
00:21:22,847 --> 00:21:23,882
Calm down, calm down!
It was big..

258
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:24,849
And weaving back and forth.

259
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,851
And it had long stringy hair
hanging down!

260
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,786
Yes!
And, Daddy, it had a dog.

261
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,621
It did!

262
00:21:29,654 --> 00:21:31,422
Dad, it was carrying a dead dog!

263
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,793
Doris, what was that,
what did you say?

264
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,561
I said he was carrying a dead dog.

265
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:39,597
I swear, Dad,
it was eight feet tall.

266
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,500
It looked like a bear that
mated with Jerry Garcia!

267
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:44,569
I could smell it from inside
the house.

268
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:47,705
It smelled like rotten eggs
and Terry's socks!

269
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,576
All right listen,
everybody needs to calm down

270
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,044
and think about what you saw, okay?

271
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:55,313
It was probably one of the
neighbor kids

272
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:56,814
that got a Halloween costume,

273
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,616
a werewolf costume or something

274
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,251
and they're out there trying
to scare you guys, okay?

275
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,353
I'm gonna go and check it out.

276
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:03,755
Doris, you watch over your
little brothers,

277
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,390
you think you can do that?

278
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:06,591
Don't go!

279
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:08,092
No, don't go!

280
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,294
Listen, listen.
Don't go.

281
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,495
Here's the thing, they don't
teach you this in school,

282
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:11,930
okay, you got it?

283
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,665
It's monster hunting 101.

284
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:15,867
Monsters are afraid of dads,
all right.

285
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,803
It's science,
they don't teach it but it's real.

286
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:21,739
So this boogeyman,
whatever it was,

287
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:23,608
thought that it found a house
with no dad

288
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,743
and he was wrong, okay?

289
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:29,247
So I'm gonna go out there and
I'm gonna go find him.

290
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,251
Okay, okay?

291
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:33,278
Hey!

292
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,712
You kids still out here?

293
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:40,218
If you are I'm gonna make you
wish that you weren't!

294
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:43,087
I'm gonna tell it to your parents!

295
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:45,957
You hear me?

296
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:08,613
So the kids were pretty
spooked, huh?

297
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:09,547
Yeah, it's okay, though.

298
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,915
I pinky sweared that I'd stay
up all night

299
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:12,517
to get 'em to go to bed.

300
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,551
Must have been serious business

301
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:15,320
to get you in that kind of contract.

302
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,722
Yeah, I'd say they're gonna
make it

303
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,724
to school just fine tomorrow.

304
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:21,025
Still though,

305
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,227
they seem pretty rattled.

306
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,762
They believe what they saw.

307
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,733
I mean,
they said it was seven feet tall,

308
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:30,635
it smelled like death.

309
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:32,837
The weird part was they said
it was carrying some sort

310
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,239
of dead animal, I don't know.

311
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,541
Well, what do you think?

312
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:38,676
I'm inclined to think it's
just kids messing around,

313
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,978
but I was looking around out
back earlier

314
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:46,050
and I saw some sort of weird
tracks out back earlier.

315
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:47,585
Strange.

316
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:48,720
Tracks?

317
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:52,256
Like prints, like big footprints.

318
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,959
Not like anything I'd ever seen
in nature, that's for sure.

319
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,628
And they weren't lying about
the smell, either.

320
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,963
Lord Almighty.

321
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:01,599
Well, Ed, try to get some sleep.

322
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,520
Stay out of my woods!

323
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:12,864
What in the world is going on
around here?

324
00:27:31,782 --> 00:27:34,819
The Harrisons were just an average,
small town family.

325
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:37,388
They owned a restaurant in
town and were well respected

326
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:39,457
and liked by the other residents.

327
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:42,593
They weren't the type to make
up monster stories.

328
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:45,296
After years of relating their
tale over and over,

329
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:47,999
they've become little more
than fictional characters,

330
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:49,867
but they were real people.

331
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:54,272
Real people whose lives were
about to be turned upside down.

332
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:57,942
The first encounter that
people attribute

333
00:27:57,975 --> 00:28:00,778
to starting the Momo craze,
as it were,

334
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:05,783
was on July 11th,
1972 at the foot of Marzolf Hill

335
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:07,585
at the Harrison Home.

336
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:19,330
I'm Michael Huntington.

337
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:21,499
I'm from Cape Girardeau, Missouri,

338
00:28:21,532 --> 00:28:23,034
which is a small river town

339
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:27,338
at the other end of the
State of Missouri.

340
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:30,374
It was in the afternoon and
Doris Harrison,

341
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:33,644
who was 15, was watching her
siblings, Terry and Wally,

342
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:37,348
who out in the backyard playing,
they were eight and five.

343
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:38,950
And they were playing with
their dog,

344
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,284
I believe his name was Chubby.

345
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,853
They were enjoying themselves

346
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,357
until they smelled something strange,

347
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,259
something really strong and pungent

348
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:52,430
and heard some rustling
amongst the treeline.

349
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:53,831
They screamed.

350
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:57,335
Doris looked out the bathroom
window, saw a creature.

351
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,441
Edgar, his kids, if I remember
right and I could be wrong,

352
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:06,210
but if I remember right,
his kids were out in the yard

353
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,879
and saw somethin' in their backyard,

354
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,082
up on the back side of the
hill on the north side,

355
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:13,417
and it scared 'em and they
ran in the house

356
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,754
and told the father and he went
out and saw whatever he saw.

357
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,596
My name is Richard Alan Murry,

358
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,165
I'm local, from here in
Louisiana, Missouri.

359
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:33,170
One thing that I recollect
this thing was supposedly large.

360
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,406
And it was supposedly hairy

361
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,174
and it made kind of an odd sound

362
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,377
and it had quite an odor to it.

363
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,613
Doris did describe it as
appearing like a man,

364
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:44,915
but it wasn't a man.

365
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,386
It was somewhere between six
and seven feet tall.

366
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,353
It was matted

367
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:54,292
in blood, tree limbs and
branches and stuff.

368
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:58,095
And it was carrying what
looked to be a dead dog.

369
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,065
She got her siblings and
called her parents.

370
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,667
Within a short period of time,

371
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,202
the family was there,
her dad was there

372
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,739
and thus began a series of events

373
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,242
centered around Marzolf Hill.

374
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,312
You were connected to the
Momo story

375
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:17,682
because your father was the
Chief of Police.

376
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,685
Yes, he was.

377
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:32,763
I'm Snookie Ward, Shelby Ward
was, of course, my dad.

378
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,866
He was Chief of Police during
that time frame.

379
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,136
Daddy got the report
regarding something

380
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,607
that scared the family, just
absolutely scared them silly.

381
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,077
The first call you would make,
I would be assumin',

382
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,579
would be the Chief of Police,
"Hey, we see something,

383
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:50,247
"We don't know what it is.

384
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,317
"Come up here and investigate,
do your job."

385
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,788
Daddy believed that they did
see something

386
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,991
because the emotions involved,
the fear involved,

387
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,195
he didn't believe that it was
just a lie

388
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:05,463
to get attention or anything.

389
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:09,567
No, he believed that they
believed they did see something.

390
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,337
But I really believe that
Harrisons believed

391
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,072
what they were sayin'.

392
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:20,111
I don't think it was a hoax,
they were sincere.

393
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,512
Oh, yeah, Ed was a good guy.

394
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:23,280
He worked for the City of Louisiana,

395
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,116
he was on the water department.

396
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:28,219
I would say 99% of the people,

397
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:30,054
if you went out on the street
and asked 'em

398
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:34,024
who started the Momo rumor,
they couldn't tell you.

399
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,693
So there is no retaliation

400
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,862
or saying anything about the Harrisons.

401
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:40,598
Now that is my opinion.

402
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:42,767
Edgar himself was adamant.

403
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,702
He was ready to go to a
fistfight with ya

404
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:45,936
if you said he didn't.

405
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:49,073
He was very serious about it.

406
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:02,620
Look, the fact is this was
the 1970s

407
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:04,855
and grind house films weren't
exactly concerned

408
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,557
about being factual.

409
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,492
Did some of these events happen?

410
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,060
You better believe it.

411
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,930
Did they happen as relayed by
a bunch of Hollywood wannabes

412
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:15,466
making a movie for zero
dollars on 16mm?

413
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,668
Heck, no.

414
00:32:17,701 --> 00:32:21,338
So take everything with a
grain of salt, except for this.

415
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,974
There was something happening
to the Harrison family,

416
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,777
something that defied explanation.

417
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,029
Excellent meetin' tonight, Edgar.

418
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:46,363
The spirit was really moving.

419
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:47,431
Thanks for having us over.

420
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:49,066
Oh, don't mention it, Reeves,
it's our pleasure.

421
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,467
It's a shame that Pahoe
couldn't make it, though,

422
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:51,936
but I understand.

423
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,902
(Indistinct)

424
00:33:29,206 --> 00:33:30,040
Edgar.

425
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,212
"There shall be signs in the sun

426
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,982
"And in the moon and in the stars.

427
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:43,888
"And on the Earth, distress
of nations in perplexity.

428
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,657
"Men's hearts failing them
for fear.

429
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:50,594
"For the powers of heaven
shall be shaken."

430
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:01,272
What in the world are those
things, Vicky?

431
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,307
I don't think they're from
this world.

432
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,515
What did we just witness?

433
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,150
There was a power plant over
that way,

434
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:15,653
maybe a transformer blew and
the backup came on.

435
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,555
I mean, there has to be a
reasonable explanation.

436
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:22,092
"Know ye that when these
things come to pass,

437
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,329
"That the kingdom of God is
nigh at hand."

438
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:05,636
Their integrity, I think,
is pretty up to par.

439
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:08,405
They were a pretty religious
family, I think.

440
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:12,543
There were Pentecostal
meetings held at the house

441
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:15,346
and I think even one of 'em
was interrupted,

442
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,780
I think, by Momo.

443
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,115
I'm familiar with that incident

444
00:35:18,148 --> 00:35:22,786
that happened on July 14th when
they had the prayer meeting

445
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,954
and they were standing outside

446
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,990
and they saw the lights in
the sky

447
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,591
and then they heard the voice.

448
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:32,496
There had been some reports
of lights on Marzolf Hill

449
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:34,398
on a couple of different occasions.

450
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:37,601
At the prayer meeting that
was held there,

451
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:39,937
there were lights allegedly,

452
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,441
I guess like maybe orbs,
or balls of energy

453
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,409
that were seen.

454
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,778
I believe a pair of 'em were
seen going down

455
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:52,082
from Marzolf Hill,
all along the treeline there.

456
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,490
It wasn't just Momo creating
a ruckus

457
00:35:59,523 --> 00:36:02,860
around Louisiana,
Missouri in the early 1970s.

458
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:05,095
Strange objects had been seen
in the skies

459
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,097
around the state for decades.

460
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,665
But in the early 1970s,

461
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,735
a wave of UFO sightings
engulfed the region.

462
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:15,205
Mrs. Avery, you have reported sighting

463
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,041
an unidentified flying object.

464
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:20,077
And I called the yard man's
attention to it.

465
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,847
So he looked at it and he
said that he thought

466
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,917
it was a weather balloon.

467
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,218
I understand something
strange happened

468
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,187
to you folks while you were
here last night.

469
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,622
Yeah, that's true.

470
00:36:31,655 --> 00:36:34,525
That thing came up and it
moved really fast

471
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:36,060
and came right over us and
hovered right over us.

472
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,127
Well the day it happened,

473
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,196
Sam and I were out working
the cattle.

474
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:42,666
I rode down to this point and
looked right up there

475
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,935
and I saw this object just
sittin' there.

476
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:47,137
And I called Sam and he rode
over right quick

477
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,105
and this thing just sat there.

478
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:49,873
We both looked at it,
about that time it..

479
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:54,411
Back in 1972,
as the Momo sightings were going on,

480
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,879
a lot of the investigators

481
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,315
that were investigating Momo
at the time

482
00:36:58,348 --> 00:37:00,284
were also UFO researchers.

483
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:02,186
As they investigated Momo,

484
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,888
they also began to notice a number

485
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,791
of UFO sightings in the area,

486
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,427
going down to O'Fallon, Wentzville,

487
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,529
over to the Cuivre River,

488
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,698
some of the other towns south
of here.

489
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,768
They definitely looked at these

490
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:21,939
and noticed that there was at
least some correlation

491
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:25,275
between anomalous atmospheric phenomena

492
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,178
and anomalous creatures.

493
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,012
All of a sudden,

494
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,547
people from all walks of life

495
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,416
were spotting strange lights hovering

496
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:34,585
above at all hours of the day
and night.

497
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,790
Even the opening of the 1975
movie is based on a real event.

498
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:42,226
Shortly after the Momo
sightings began,

499
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:45,195
a dozen eyewitnesses saw two
unidentified lights

500
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,164
in the sky above town.

501
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:48,866
Were these UFOs?

502
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,802
Had one of them crashed into
the woods outside Louisiana

503
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:54,605
and brought with it a hairy,
lumbering, ape like critter

504
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:57,441
that went on to terrorize the populous?

505
00:37:57,474 --> 00:37:59,176
Due to the ongoing flap,

506
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:01,845
UFO hunters from across the
country started showing up

507
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,314
in Louisiana to search for Momo.

508
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:07,384
Some of them believe Momo
himself was an alien visitor

509
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:10,454
from a distant planet,
curious about mankind.

510
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:11,421
And apparently,

511
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,857
he enjoyed the taste of man's
best friend

512
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,426
as more dogs began to go
missing in the area.

513
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:19,696
As tension began to mount,

514
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,099
more attention was focused on
the Harrison family

515
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:26,170
and on Marzolf, or Star Hill
as it was sometimes called.

516
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,309
Well, what can you say,

517
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:34,178
that's summer weather for ya.

518
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,313
They say it sounds like the
excitement has yet

519
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:38,348
to die down in Louisiana.

520
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:42,986
The mystery of Missouri's own
monster continues to deepen.

521
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,122
A trail of giant footprints
was found

522
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:48,025
in Farmer Robbin's field about
eight miles south of town,

523
00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:52,296
but get this,
each foot only had three long toes.

524
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,797
Maybe he stepped in a bear trap.

525
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,686
Harrisons.

526
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,122
Hello, is this Edgar Harrison?

527
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,358
Yeah, this is him, who's this?

528
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:26,663
My name is Wendorf and I have
a farm right outside town.

529
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,066
Well, what can I do for you
today, Mr. Wendorf?

530
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:31,702
Well, I'm not exactly sure
how to start,

531
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:35,672
but I understand you folka
had had a run in

532
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,376
with that monster that's been
stalkin' around these parts?

533
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:42,212
Yeah, someone or some thing
scared the daylights

534
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,081
out of my kids a few days back.

535
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:48,151
I seen it for myself and
I thought maybe you'd be one

536
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,687
I could explain it all about to.

537
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:24,488
Whoa!

538
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:27,057
Thanks for listenin' to me

539
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,093
and not laughin' me off the phone.

540
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:30,961
Stay safe.

541
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,933
Hello.

542
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,703
So, we were trying to find
this party in Pike County

543
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:41,138
but it was a bust, you know.

544
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:43,640
So I took off by myself,

545
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:47,644
just walkin' for a half hour
or so, enjoying nature.

546
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,981
Then the wind shifted and
I got hit by this smell

547
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:55,686
that was like a cross between
a skunk and rotting flesh.

548
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,321
I mean, not like I'm an expert

549
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,722
when it comes to rotting flesh

550
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:00,457
but you know what I mean.

551
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,992
Anyway, I'm dealing with that

552
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:05,462
and I realize that maybe 300
feet away,

553
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:07,531
somebody else is walking in
the woods.

554
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:10,233
I was near a pasture so I thought,

555
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,502
"Oh, it's a farmer, you know,
rounding up his cows,

556
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,471
"Not a big deal."

557
00:41:14,504 --> 00:41:18,241
But then I hear a god awful,
bloodcurdling scream.

558
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,345
At first I thought it was cattle,
but then I realized

559
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:25,949
whoever it was in the treeline
is looking right at me.

560
00:41:25,982 --> 00:41:29,419
And so I start walking and he
starts walking

561
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,456
and when I stop, he stops.

562
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:35,058
So I'm starting to get pretty nervous.

563
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:37,427
I kind of realized I was jogging

564
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:43,500
and this character is matching
my moves, stop, start, looking.

565
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:45,736
But the stench was getting stronger

566
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,473
and he was angling towards me,
getting closer by the minute.

567
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,376
I stopped one more time and looked.

568
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,312
I couldn't believe it,

569
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:58,982
this wasn't a person,
this is a creature.

570
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:01,852
I really felt like I was in danger.

571
00:42:01,885 --> 00:42:02,953
My adrenaline was going,

572
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:05,188
I was scared out of my wits.

573
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:07,357
And so I saw this farm house
in the distance

574
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,793
and that was my only goal,
you know.

575
00:42:09,826 --> 00:42:12,195
I looked back and the thing
was going

576
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,463
back toward the pasture.

577
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,934
I hid behind a tree for a
while until things settled down.

578
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:24,441
Terry, eat your food.

579
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:26,643
With the fork!

580
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,181
The kids at school you are a
monster hunter now,

581
00:42:31,214 --> 00:42:32,048
is that true?

582
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,885
Of course not.

583
00:42:34,918 --> 00:42:36,953
People are seeing something
that they don't understand

584
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:38,989
and they want to talk to
somebody about it.

585
00:42:39,022 --> 00:42:41,658
For some reason,
when people see the thing

586
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:42,993
no one will believe them.

587
00:42:43,026 --> 00:42:44,227
I don't like this, Ed.

588
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,997
The noises in the woods and
the lights in the sky last week,

589
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,165
that's one thing,

590
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,200
but people coming to you with
these stories,

591
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:51,968
they think we're freaks.

592
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,203
Even business is hurting

593
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:55,338
because everyone thinks we're
the people that started it.

594
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:57,841
He's just tryin' to make sure
we're okay!

595
00:42:57,874 --> 00:42:59,876
That's better than having
your head buried in the sand.

596
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,944
Doris, don't talk back to your mother.

597
00:43:00,977 --> 00:43:04,381
But, Dad, she didn't see that
thing, I did!

598
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:06,216
Doris, Sweetie,
it's not that I don't believe

599
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:07,484
you think you saw something,

600
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:09,953
but we can't go running out
in the woods hunting

601
00:43:09,986 --> 00:43:12,689
for a monster, or bear,
or whatever it is.

602
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:13,657
Someone who's equipped

603
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,158
to handle the situation will
deal with it,

604
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,427
like Chief Ward or the dog warden.

605
00:43:19,062 --> 00:43:20,664
I think you need to take the kids

606
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:21,832
and head back to the
restaurant to the cellar

607
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,100
and just wait for this whole
thing to blow over, okay.

608
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,469
What?

609
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:27,370
You can't keep putting your
family through this!

610
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:28,839
We need you to wake up.

611
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:30,774
Dad, let me stay with you!

612
00:43:30,807 --> 00:43:34,077
No, it's not safe, I'm sorry.

613
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,612
Just listen to yourself!

614
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:37,447
Listen, I know how it sounds

615
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,317
but there's something out there
and it's drawn to us, okay.

616
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,985
You've always known me to do
the right thing

617
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:43,753
and this feels like the right thing.

618
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,323
You're gonna have to give me
the benefit of the doubt, okay.

619
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:00,537
Doris.

620
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:02,572
Won't you please let me stay
with you?

621
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:03,473
You need me!

622
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,275
I've seen what it does!

623
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:07,878
Listen, come here, look.

624
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,646
Terry, I need you to take care
of your little brother, okay.

625
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:11,615
You got to keep your sister
in line.

626
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:12,716
You're just gonna be at the restaurant

627
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:13,917
until the entire thing blows
over, okay?

628
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,685
Okay.
Okay, go on.

629
00:44:16,753 --> 00:44:17,988
Okay.

630
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:26,730
Betty!

631
00:44:28,064 --> 00:44:29,900
Thank you, okay.

632
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,368
It's not for nothing.

633
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:33,336
It's all gonna be over soon,
I promise.

634
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:55,292
It's not hard to picture a
scenario where somebody

635
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:56,793
who may have had a Momo sighting

636
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:58,795
would contact the first
person thrust

637
00:44:58,828 --> 00:45:00,630
into the eye of the hurricane.

638
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,066
No, the townspeople weren't
contacting Edgar

639
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:06,136
as if he was some sort of
Kolchak, the Night Stalker.

640
00:45:06,169 --> 00:45:08,371
But it's not hard to picture
a scenario

641
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,707
where a witness may have
contacted Edgar

642
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,442
believing him to be the only person

643
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:15,679
who wouldn't simply laugh at,
or dismiss them entirely.

644
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,616
Suddenly restaurants were
selling Momo burgers,

645
00:45:19,649 --> 00:45:21,785
newspapers were flying off newsstands

646
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:23,853
and tourists were flooding to town.

647
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,423
And there was hardly anywhere
the Harrison kids could go

648
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:28,925
without being laughed at or
talked about.

649
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,996
The town was firmly in the
grasp of monster mania.

650
00:45:33,029 --> 00:45:35,131
It wasn't just the UFO and
monster hunters,

651
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,033
or the strange activity
taking place

652
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,170
that began to impact the
lives of the Harrison family.

653
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:41,438
It was the town's reaction

654
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:43,173
to what was taking place, as well.

655
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:50,113
It bordered on hysteria at
one time when it was new.

656
00:45:50,146 --> 00:45:52,215
And there was even a song
written about it.

657
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,883
I would say, wouldn't you, Willard,

658
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,886
I would say it went on for
several months.

659
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,023
There was sighting there
about every month or so.

660
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:02,525
Someone'd say,
"We've seen Momo last night,"

661
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,994
or something like that.

662
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:06,396
Of course you didn't know
whether to believe

663
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:09,566
in what they were doin',
or it was a hoax, or joke.

664
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,501
Following the Harrison sighting,

665
00:46:11,534 --> 00:46:13,703
a resident on River Road, I believe,

666
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:14,704
reported a sighting.

667
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,272
Are you familiar with that one?

668
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:19,442
That's the Ellis Minor encounter.

669
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:23,980
Old character who lived down
there on the River Road,

670
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,883
along a treeline.

671
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:29,853
One evening,
about a week and a half or so

672
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:34,257
after the initial encounters,
he was sittin' on his porch.

673
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:41,698
His dog alerted him to something
moving in the darkness along the road.

674
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:42,932
He got his flashlight,

675
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,235
shined the flashlight over to the road

676
00:46:45,268 --> 00:46:49,205
and he saw Momo.

677
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:56,046
Some sort of large, dark,
hairy, man like creature.

678
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,748
I guess it got scared away by
his light

679
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,284
and proceeded to scurry off

680
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:03,353
into the trees.

681
00:47:03,386 --> 00:47:07,290
He seems to think it was on
its way to the river.

682
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:11,561
Momo was surprised just as
much as Ellis Minor that night

683
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:12,729
and his dog.

684
00:47:12,762 --> 00:47:15,899
You know there were quite a
few people that claimed,

685
00:47:15,932 --> 00:47:17,300
I believe there were several families

686
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,035
up on what we call River Road.

687
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,604
It's a little road, runs right
along the river naturally,

688
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:23,840
here just on the north end of town.

689
00:47:23,873 --> 00:47:25,775
I believe there was something.

690
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:29,646
I'm fairly certain that some
of the people

691
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:32,182
that reported seeing things
did see something.

692
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:35,852
As far being a bigfoot type creature,

693
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:37,554
I don't know if I'd go so far
as to say that.

694
00:47:37,587 --> 00:47:40,123
But there was something here,
something going on.

695
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:42,092
There was a lot of people
came in,

696
00:47:43,426 --> 00:47:47,063
adventurers who had looked
for Momo.

697
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,466
Yeti and..
The Yeti and all of those.

698
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:53,470
There was all kinds of people
came to Louisiana lookin' for 'em.

699
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:01,945
So at the time,

700
00:48:01,978 --> 00:48:05,115
I know you were young when
the Momo story came out,

701
00:48:06,015 --> 00:48:09,419
what's your recollections
about that whole thing?

702
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:14,157
I remember it was a big,
big deal around here.

703
00:48:17,727 --> 00:48:20,130
Gail Suddarth, I'm from here, Louisiana.

704
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,570
My mom was always real
nervous about it

705
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:29,105
because we lived in the country

706
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,340
and my dad worked shift work.

707
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:33,343
So she was always kind of
real nervous about it,

708
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:36,346
always thought she heard
things and things like that.

709
00:48:36,379 --> 00:48:40,583
So all the stores had Momo
sales and the Momo burger.

710
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,354
It was a big thing for us, I guess.

711
00:48:44,387 --> 00:48:50,994
This town became monster central for
a number of weeks and even months.

712
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,697
The press from all over the
world came here,

713
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:58,001
newspapers, television,
foreign press.

714
00:48:58,034 --> 00:49:02,405
I think there were people
from Japan here studying Momo

715
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,606
and seeing what it was.

716
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,643
Of course, it was reflective
of the culture of the times.

717
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:10,046
I used to cut through on
Eighth Street

718
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,481
and there's a bridge now,

719
00:49:11,514 --> 00:49:14,317
it used to be just a crossing
through the creek,

720
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,351
and you went up Eighth Street

721
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,587
and I was in my pickup
headin' up to my folks,

722
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:21,758
I still lived at home at the
time and there was something.

723
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,428
There's a very steep hill,

724
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:27,463
and there used to be a couple
of houses up there,

725
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:30,567
and it went up the hill,
inbetween the houses

726
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,901
up onto the hill.

727
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,304
I do know it stood upright.

728
00:49:34,337 --> 00:49:37,106
It looked around and it went
up the hill.

729
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,909
And the hill's so steep,
it doesn't matter what you are,

730
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:43,479
you're gonna use all fours to
go up the hill, even a person.

731
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,982
What I saw kind of resembled
a small bear,

732
00:49:46,015 --> 00:49:49,419
or maybe even like a monkey
type thing, I don't know.

733
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:53,923
It was just small, stood upright,
kind of a dark tan color

734
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:54,891
and ran up the hill.

735
00:49:54,924 --> 00:49:55,792
I know you said

736
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:58,595
your mother might have seen something.

737
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,697
Yeah, my mother did.

738
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,265
Again my dad worked shift work

739
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:04,500
so she was like alone with
four kids.

740
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:05,935
She was sure that one night,

741
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,538
she said she was doing exercises

742
00:50:08,571 --> 00:50:11,040
and when she looked out the window,

743
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:12,709
he was starin' in the window
at her.

744
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:15,011
She pretty much described it
just the same

745
00:50:15,044 --> 00:50:17,013
as everybody else did.

746
00:50:17,046 --> 00:50:20,450
Tall, she said kind of a
shadowy form,

747
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:22,719
but she said it had to be big

748
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:25,355
because she could see like shoulders

749
00:50:25,388 --> 00:50:29,092
and torso above our back door,
which had no steps,

750
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,226
it was just like an extra door

751
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,728
that had no back steps back there.

752
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:33,997
So she could see it standing
above that.

753
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,565
So she was sure she saw something

754
00:50:35,598 --> 00:50:37,333
and I'm sure she did see something,

755
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,202
but I don't know what it was.

756
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:41,404
You know, you heard about
this one lady went

757
00:50:41,437 --> 00:50:43,406
to open her gate,
she had a heart attack.

758
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:46,142
Or some other people down the road,

759
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:48,011
they smelled this god awful smell

760
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:52,615
and were extremely upset
about it.

761
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,083
I think that's normal, though.

762
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:57,086
That came about because of
seeing something

763
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:02,125
that they couldn't identify,
it's gonna create panic.

764
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,394
Approximately a year earlier,

765
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:07,497
there was the Mills Ryan encounter.

766
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:11,567
A couple of local ladies were
having a picnic

767
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,604
off of one of the highways here,
I think it was 79

768
00:51:14,637 --> 00:51:17,840
and they smelled something,
something awful,

769
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:22,011
something pungent, something putrid.

770
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,014
What came out of the woods
certainly was some kind of animal

771
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:29,118
but it wasn't an animal that
they were familiar with.

772
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:32,555
It was some sort of hairy,
ape like creature is

773
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:33,957
what they described.

774
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:36,059
Hung around the periphery of
the treeline

775
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:39,262
and it frightened these women.

776
00:51:39,295 --> 00:51:42,932
They ran to their car,
they left their picnic.

777
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:44,133
They even left their keys.

778
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:48,037
I think they had to honk their
horn to scare the creature off...

779
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,772
And by that time he had ran off

780
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:53,376
with their peanut butter sandwiches.

781
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:57,880
You know, they were sort of
shrugged off and dismissed

782
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,182
until the following year

783
00:51:59,215 --> 00:52:02,151
when literally dozens of
other people were saying

784
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:05,388
that same sort of thing
around this area.

785
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,351
So tell me again how you
found this track, Ms. Suddarth?

786
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,387
It was actually Bill who found it.

787
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,557
Last night we heard the most
mournful howl coming

788
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:48,991
from the woods.

789
00:53:49,025 --> 00:53:51,894
We hadn't heard anything like
that in all the years

790
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,496
we've lived here.

791
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:55,765
So he came out, looked around

792
00:53:55,798 --> 00:53:58,301
and that's when he found these.

793
00:53:58,334 --> 00:53:59,869
He was frightened

794
00:53:59,902 --> 00:54:02,672
so he called Clyde,
Clyde came out

795
00:54:02,705 --> 00:54:04,941
and well, both guys were confused.

796
00:54:04,974 --> 00:54:06,976
So that's when we called you.

797
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,351
What do you think, Edgar?

798
00:54:17,987 --> 00:54:20,056
What do I think?

799
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:21,357
I think I'm confused.

800
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,093
I think I'm scared.

801
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:25,862
I think I'm terrified.

802
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:29,599
Something, something's
killing our animals.

803
00:54:29,632 --> 00:54:33,269
Something's, something's
stalking our children.

804
00:54:33,302 --> 00:54:37,073
Somebody's got to do something!

805
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:46,549
Were you aware that tracks were found?

806
00:54:46,582 --> 00:54:51,020
No, not until later, way later.

807
00:54:51,053 --> 00:54:52,188
I wasn't aware of that.

808
00:54:52,221 --> 00:54:54,190
There were tracks that were found.

809
00:54:54,223 --> 00:54:59,128
They were different than other
Bigfoot type tracks.

810
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,964
They were three toed which is
sort of different

811
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:05,434
than what you would expect
from some sort of primate

812
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,936
that we would be familiar with,

813
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:10,039
or what people attribute to a bigfoot.

814
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:11,607
Did you hear anything

815
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,976
about tracks being hoaxed?

816
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,411
Now I don't know about that.

817
00:55:15,444 --> 00:55:18,948
I do know that there were some
handmade feet put in prints

818
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:21,484
and dust...

819
00:55:21,517 --> 00:55:25,154
And someone had cut out the
shape of a foot

820
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:27,557
and went out across the
ground with 'em on.

821
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:31,727
So walk me through the day
that you decided

822
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,863
to add to the Momo legend,
if you will.

823
00:55:33,896 --> 00:55:37,133
Okay, I went out to pick
tomatoes out of the garden,

824
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,601
it was fairly early in the morning,

825
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:40,336
I'm not really sure what time
it was or anything.

826
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:42,405
So I walked down there and
it was kind of,

827
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:44,473
you know, not really muddy out,

828
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,808
but it was damp and everything.

829
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:49,078
So I thought, "Well, I'll just
make a little footprint here

830
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:51,614
"And then I'll go in and tell my
mom and dad I found a footprint."

831
00:55:51,647 --> 00:55:54,517
And so I did that, I took my heel

832
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,786
and just made impressions in
the dirt.

833
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:58,854
When I went back in,
I think I really didn't expect

834
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:00,056
that they would believe me,

835
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:02,959
they would just kind of go
along with it for a few minutes

836
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:05,061
and then it would kind of be
over with.

837
00:56:05,094 --> 00:56:08,297
And I made the impression and
I went back in the house

838
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:10,266
and I said, "Oh, look what I found!"

839
00:56:10,299 --> 00:56:11,500
So they came out and looked.

840
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,935
My dad called Clyde Penrod,

841
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,837
which was kind of a relative
of ours,

842
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:16,939
and then they came out and
did a plaster cast of it.

843
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,574
And then like over the next
few days,

844
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:21,010
several different people came out

845
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:23,246
and they had some, like an,
I don't know,

846
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,848
anthropologist, or somebody
came out

847
00:56:25,881 --> 00:56:27,083
and authenticated the footprints.

848
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:28,684
Said, "Oh, yeah, it's
definitely from an animal

849
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,319
"Because it has animal hair."

850
00:56:30,353 --> 00:56:33,856
And due to the depths of the
impressions and everything,

851
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:36,726
they determined its weight
and its height.

852
00:56:36,759 --> 00:56:38,794
So by that time I was really
too afraid

853
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,496
to say anything different,
so I just didn't.

854
00:56:40,529 --> 00:56:41,964
I just kept my mouth shut

855
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,232
and I just let everybody think

856
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:46,402
that whatever had happened
was out there.

857
00:56:46,435 --> 00:56:47,770
And I don't know how they explained

858
00:56:47,803 --> 00:56:49,171
that there was only one footprint,

859
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:50,539
it was something to do with,

860
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,075
because of his stride or something.

861
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,578
There was only one footprint,
because that's all I made.

862
00:56:55,611 --> 00:56:57,713
So that was the story of the footprint.

863
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,215
That's how it happened.

864
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:01,651
And my mom, after that of course,

865
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:05,955
was really sure that Momo was
lurking around out there.

866
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:07,757
My dad never really said a
whole lot about it,

867
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:11,327
but I think after a while,
I'm pretty sure he was suspicious

868
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,461
but he never said anything to me.

869
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,830
But he just never really said
too much about it,

870
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:17,566
he just kind of laughed it
off after a while.

871
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,105
A lot was said about it.

872
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,778
I was on the street carrying
mail mainly then

873
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:33,316
and what I remember,
there was a group of people

874
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:36,552
that went on Star Hill hunting Momo

875
00:57:36,585 --> 00:57:40,189
and the conservation agent
here was livid.

876
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:42,591
And he told the city marshal

877
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,929
that if it's not in the game
book, it's illegal

878
00:57:46,962 --> 00:57:51,500
and he'll arrest anybody that
shoots Momo.

879
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:54,804
Hysteria maybe, hysterical, no.

880
00:57:54,837 --> 00:57:57,573
Definitely a lot of
excitement in town.

881
00:57:57,606 --> 00:58:02,011
Like I said, the people were
goin' out and carrying guns.

882
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:05,314
Supposedly, some people even
shot at this thing

883
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:07,583
off the highway, north of town.

884
00:58:07,616 --> 00:58:11,620
It put a lot of fear in parents
for their children's safety

885
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:14,090
and even some of them,
for their own safety.

886
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,891
Because if you were out
around the woods

887
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,627
or somethin' somewhere and
somebody caught a glimpse of ya,

888
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,929
they might take a shot at you.

889
00:58:19,962 --> 00:58:22,932
I mean it was not a smart
time to be paradin' around

890
00:58:22,965 --> 00:58:23,999
in the dark.

891
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,067
Shortly thereafter,

892
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:28,003
he organized a search party
to go up on Marzolf.

893
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,205
Yes.

894
00:58:29,238 --> 00:58:32,074
Like I said,
Daddy was an amazing person

895
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:34,009
and he loved the people in Louisiana

896
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,245
and he did his damnedest to
protect them.

897
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:38,214
Well we call Star Hill,
Marzolf Hill,

898
00:58:38,247 --> 00:58:40,716
where Momo was sighted originally

899
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:43,853
and seen quite often,
or whatever was there.

900
00:58:43,886 --> 00:58:45,654
It was kind of a playground.

901
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:49,024
You know, I grew up a couple
blocks down the hill from it

902
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:52,828
and the parents just wouldn't
let their kids go up.

903
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,230
As time went on along,

904
00:58:54,263 --> 00:58:58,200
I mean there were groups of

905
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:02,538
very serious adult men
that were goin' up armed.

906
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:06,142
There was a few hundred people
went up there off and on,

907
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:07,476
just not one time.

908
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:10,946
But there was several people,
like I say, went up

909
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,383
and we searched the hills and
tried to find something.

910
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:18,053
They would go in groups,
a couple of times with 30 and 40,

911
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:22,825
led by city police officials
and tryin' to comb this hill

912
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:24,126
and find this thing.

913
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,327
People camped out.

914
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:29,865
Mr. Harrison camped out,
I believe, for three weeks

915
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,934
while his family stayed elsewhere.

916
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,336
He camped out lookin' for
this creature.

917
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:39,475
The police went on multiple
raids up to the top of the hill

918
00:59:39,508 --> 00:59:42,812
to try to find out what was
going on.

919
00:59:55,057 --> 00:59:59,095
(Muttering)

920
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,096
All right, Men,
we're about ready to do somethin'

921
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,899
that's never been done before
in the history of Pike County

922
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,469
and somethin' that we'll never
hopefully have to do again.

923
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:09,805
We're gonna go out and try to flush
out this creature they call Momo

924
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,740
and end this mystery once and
for all.

925
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:13,876
I heard that thing ran off

926
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:16,679
with one of Charlie Pierce's
prized shows.

927
01:00:16,712 --> 01:00:18,647
What kind of thing could take
a 100 pound hog

928
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,849
and just walk away with it?

929
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:22,184
Now obviously, safety's the
most important thing here,

930
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,919
but if you get a clean shot
on this thing

931
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,955
you are authorized to take it.

932
01:00:25,988 --> 01:00:28,023
We have the community to
think about.

933
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,625
We're gonna split off into
two groups.

934
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:30,559
I'm gonna take one

935
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:32,595
and Edgar Harrison's gonna
take the other.

936
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:34,129
Any questions?

937
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,965
Yeah, anyone want any fur coats

938
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:39,435
once I bag this critter?

939
01:00:39,468 --> 01:00:40,669
Yeah!

940
01:01:24,446 --> 01:01:26,182
Chief, you suppose that could
just be a kid

941
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,350
in a monkey suit goofin' around?

942
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:29,418
It'd have to be a pretty dumb kid,

943
01:01:29,451 --> 01:01:31,453
runnin' around like it's
Halloween like that,

944
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:33,489
liable to get his head blown off.

945
01:01:33,522 --> 01:01:36,225
Speakin' of which.
Oh, sorry about that.

946
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:41,297
I'm not even sure there's
anything out here to shoot.

947
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:42,331
At least nothin' like that.

948
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:43,198
I mean.

949
01:01:45,534 --> 01:01:47,403
Ooh, that's gross!

950
01:01:47,436 --> 01:01:48,871
That's the smell of death!

951
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,978
What did you do?

952
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:58,180
There's somethin' on the hill!

953
01:01:58,213 --> 01:02:01,183
Kill it!

954
01:02:12,294 --> 01:02:15,197
(Murmuring)

955
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:40,956
Stay out of my woods!

956
01:02:44,426 --> 01:02:46,695
Whoever said that better step
out right now,

957
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,397
I'm done playing games!

958
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:50,399
This ends tonight!

959
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:57,973
I've never seen somethin'
like this before!

960
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:00,609
It's like a lean to or something.

961
01:03:13,355 --> 01:03:15,024
All right, Boys, with the other
tracks we found back there,

962
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,126
we may as well check this
thing for hair.

963
01:03:27,269 --> 01:03:29,304
Is that it, is that the creature?

964
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:30,839
It's time to find out!

965
01:03:32,641 --> 01:03:34,543
Edgar, wait!

966
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:20,189
Ow!

967
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:49,985
Gerald, is that you?

968
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,613
I'm telling you exactly what happened.

969
01:05:17,646 --> 01:05:20,349
I followed it into its lair,
I shot it between the eyes.

970
01:05:20,382 --> 01:05:21,950
I sent this thing back to hell.

971
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:23,185
Don't go jumpin' to conclusions,

972
01:05:23,218 --> 01:05:25,888
you don't know what you shot or
if you shot anything at all.

973
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:27,656
You might have shot a deer.
Right!

974
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:29,625
Or you might have shot your
own shadow for all we know.

975
01:05:29,658 --> 01:05:31,960
The point is that you're tired,
I'm tired

976
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:33,395
and we saw stuff out in the
woods, too.

977
01:05:33,428 --> 01:05:35,497
Lights.
Don't forget the voice!

978
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:36,999
Right, right, but the point is

979
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:38,467
you're tired and we're tired.

980
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,170
Whatever was out there is not
there now, we drove it off.

981
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,939
I did more than flush it out,
I shot it between the eyes!

982
01:05:43,972 --> 01:05:45,107
I believe you, Edgar,

983
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,175
but we're here to keep the peace

984
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:47,509
and right now keepin' the
peace means

985
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:49,444
that you didn't shoot
anything at all.

986
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:52,748
But maybe you did, maybe you
saved everyone in Louisiana.

987
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:55,050
Go on home, get some rest, Ed.

988
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:56,952
Look, we're all upright and
we're all breathin'

989
01:05:56,985 --> 01:05:59,154
and for me that means it was
a successful night.

990
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:00,455
Go home and get some rest.

991
01:06:33,188 --> 01:06:36,592
Strange voices in the woods,
lights in the sky,

992
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,761
a hairy, scary beast hanging
out on Marzolf Hill,

993
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:42,931
it has all the trappings of a
made for drive in movie,

994
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,967
but it really did happen.

995
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,768
Members of the posse did claim

996
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:49,738
to hear a mysterious
disembodied voice in the woods

997
01:06:49,771 --> 01:06:52,674
and numerous people saw
strange lights in the sky,

998
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:55,711
not to mention those who
claimed to have seen the creature.

999
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:58,947
Was there really a Momo there?

1000
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,550
The bones can be chalked up
to artistic license,

1001
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:03,886
but there really was an
abandoned building located

1002
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:06,321
up on Marzolf Hill,
which could have been used

1003
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,691
as a hideaway for a large
animal or an unknown creature.

1004
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,494
I seem to recall a little somethin'

1005
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:15,130
about they found like a brush
hut or something.

1006
01:07:15,163 --> 01:07:18,967
And then there was supposedly
like an abandoned,

1007
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,069
derelict house or something
like that,

1008
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:24,273
and they thought they'd found
a nest or something in there.

1009
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,842
To answer your question,
I don't remember much about it.

1010
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:30,245
As a young man, I just wanted
to see what this was,

1011
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:34,116
if it was I wanted to get a
hold of him like everyone else.

1012
01:07:35,617 --> 01:07:40,222
But we never found nothing,
never saw nothing,

1013
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:44,993
never smelled nothing and they
said he had a terrible odor,

1014
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:47,796
but none of this came true,
on my part.

1015
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:51,566
So when they were up there doing
their search did they find anything?

1016
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,336
I don't remember if they did
or not, I don't know?

1017
01:07:54,369 --> 01:07:59,007
I mean, it was actually later,
maybe as years went passed,

1018
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,109
well like this was found and
this was there,

1019
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:02,010
that type of thing.

1020
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,412
But at the time..

1021
01:08:04,279 --> 01:08:06,515
Did anybody claim to have
shot Momo

1022
01:08:06,548 --> 01:08:07,416
during that time?

1023
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,985
Again, not that I'm aware of.

1024
01:08:10,852 --> 01:08:12,788
I personally don't believe

1025
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:15,223
there was anything there to shoot.

1026
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:18,226
I think some people saw something,

1027
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,362
but as far as for being a Bigfoot,

1028
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:25,467
you know,
I think that's a little extreme.

1029
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,768
Maybe the strangest aspect

1030
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:29,338
of this whole story is the
posse itself.

1031
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:31,206
Whatever was going on in Louisiana

1032
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:32,607
at the time was serious enough

1033
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,377
that Chief Ward organized a
group of 20 men

1034
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:37,679
and they really did go up on
Marzolf Hill

1035
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:40,616
to hunt down the creature,
or whatever it was.

1036
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:46,755
Hey, check it out!

1037
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:49,157
We're getting word that a
search party went looking

1038
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:51,960
for that old Missouri Monster tonight

1039
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:55,831
in the general vicinity of
what we call Star Hill,

1040
01:08:55,864 --> 01:08:59,267
known as Marzolf Hill here in Louisiana.

1041
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,435
Of course in recent days,

1042
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,671
residents have reported
strange smells,

1043
01:09:02,704 --> 01:09:04,006
howls in the night

1044
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,742
and even sightings of the
hairy beast itself.

1045
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,810
The deputy sheriff we talked
to wanted

1046
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:12,147
to assure the public that
there's nothing to worry about,

1047
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:15,684
that's it probably best to keep
your pets inside after dark

1048
01:09:15,717 --> 01:09:17,452
for the time being.

1049
01:09:20,989 --> 01:09:22,190
Dad!
Daddy!

1050
01:09:29,264 --> 01:09:30,332
Mrs. Suddarth brought us home

1051
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:31,900
the minute the reports came in.

1052
01:09:31,933 --> 01:09:33,435
What happened, Edgar?

1053
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:34,503
I killed it, I think.

1054
01:09:34,536 --> 01:09:36,271
It was there one second,
I shot it and it was gone.

1055
01:09:36,304 --> 01:09:37,806
I think I killed it.

1056
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,341
Groovy!

1057
01:09:39,374 --> 01:09:41,576
See, Dad,
you're a monster hunter now!

1058
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,879
Wait 'til the rest of the kids
at school hear about this!

1059
01:09:43,912 --> 01:09:45,914
They won't be laughing at us anymore.

1060
01:10:00,128 --> 01:10:03,065
(Murmuring)

1061
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,445
Fireflies?
Those aren't fireflies.

1062
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:19,815
Edgar?

1063
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:14,936
The Harrison family wasn't killed

1064
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,505
by an angry, vicious monster.

1065
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,508
Heck, even Momo itself didn't seem

1066
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,844
all that angry or vicious,
perhaps just curious.

1067
01:11:23,745 --> 01:11:26,248
Maybe a little lost in its surroundings.

1068
01:11:26,281 --> 01:11:29,184
Sort of like an outsider,
like so many of us are

1069
01:11:29,217 --> 01:11:31,987
in a world that won't seem to
slow down.

1070
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:35,023
Bigfoot sightings in Missouri
continue to this day,

1071
01:11:35,056 --> 01:11:36,992
but the descriptions don't
exactly line up

1072
01:11:37,025 --> 01:11:40,562
with the hairy, scary,
Missouri Monster scene in 1972.

1073
01:11:41,496 --> 01:11:44,166
After the sightings stopped,
the town went back to normal.

1074
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:45,600
And in the years to follow,

1075
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:48,336
Louisiana turned its back on
its local monster,

1076
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,338
preferring to forget it ever existed.

1077
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,241
If they did acknowledge the event,

1078
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:56,111
it was under the caveat that
the whole thing was made up,

1079
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:59,247
a hoax perpetrated by some
local kids.

1080
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:01,183
The Harrison family and the
other witnesses,

1081
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:03,919
however, would beg to differ.

1082
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:06,321
They know what they saw.

1083
01:12:06,354 --> 01:12:09,524
What are your thoughts on the possibility

1084
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:12,060
that there was something
behind this,

1085
01:12:12,093 --> 01:12:13,962
some sort of creature or anything?

1086
01:12:13,995 --> 01:12:15,797
I think some people truly believed

1087
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:17,566
that they thought they saw something.

1088
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:20,735
And I think a lot of it's just
because when you get wrapped up

1089
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,038
in that kind of a story and everything,

1090
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:25,307
I think you're always a little open

1091
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:27,909
to more things than you
normally would be, I guess.

1092
01:12:29,544 --> 01:12:30,846
I don't think I ever fully
believed it.

1093
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:33,915
Maybe as a kid, you know,
as a kid, but not after that.

1094
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:37,018
I'd go back to hysteria

1095
01:12:38,386 --> 01:12:42,457
at first and then it began to
die down.

1096
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:46,161
There was one theory that
maybe it was a black bear

1097
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:47,229
that they saw.

1098
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:51,233
But I really believe that
Harrisons believed

1099
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:52,767
what they were sayin'.

1100
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:58,240
I don't think it was a hoax,
they were sincere.

1101
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:02,010
My thought was curiosity,
is it true?

1102
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:04,946
And as time went on, I said,
"No, it's not true."

1103
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,315
That was my personal opinion.

1104
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:09,451
There was a story circulated

1105
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:13,021
and the people that were
involved in it,

1106
01:13:13,054 --> 01:13:14,889
one of 'em's still alive and
one of 'em's dead now

1107
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,192
and I'm not going to get into
who they were,

1108
01:13:17,225 --> 01:13:19,160
I'm not gonna do that,

1109
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:22,597
but my understanding that
they were two businessmen

1110
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,667
and that they put together a suit.

1111
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:29,638
And that one of them wore it around

1112
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:33,341
and it was even seen in their
business at the time

1113
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:37,679
and that would promote the
idea of a hoax.

1114
01:13:37,712 --> 01:13:40,515
I will also say that that
happened a couple,

1115
01:13:40,548 --> 01:13:43,818
three weeks, after the original.

1116
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:48,056
So if that was what Edgar and
them saw, I doubt it.

1117
01:13:48,089 --> 01:13:52,560
Some people thought it was
somethin' to stir Edgar up,

1118
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,231
I don't know?

1119
01:13:56,264 --> 01:13:58,033
I'm not gonna say it didn't happen,

1120
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:01,536
I was just not that involved.

1121
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:03,872
I didn't read the paper about it.

1122
01:14:03,905 --> 01:14:06,141
It was just happening,

1123
01:14:06,174 --> 01:14:08,777
I'm not gonna say it didn't
involve me,

1124
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:10,412
but my life went on.

1125
01:14:11,646 --> 01:14:13,515
I didn't live Momo.

1126
01:14:13,548 --> 01:14:15,116
I didn't look for Momo.

1127
01:14:16,217 --> 01:14:18,987
But I was not in the hub of Momo.

1128
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:23,692
Maybe that's why I don't find
it so terribly important.

1129
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:24,559
But

1130
01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:31,032
I don't deny that it is a
part of Louisiana's history.

1131
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,068
Important history?

1132
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,003
Not in my eyes,

1133
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:36,571
but a piece of our history.

1134
01:14:38,673 --> 01:14:40,642
It's an interesting sidelight.

1135
01:14:40,675 --> 01:14:43,945
I don't think anybody really
took it that serious.

1136
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:49,084
Maybe at the time,
but not now, I don't believe.

1137
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,986
Well, I'd forgotten part of it

1138
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:54,022
until Martha Shoe called me
the other night,

1139
01:14:54,055 --> 01:14:56,324
I hadn't thought of Momo in
20 years.

1140
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,560
It was somethin' that was here,

1141
01:14:58,593 --> 01:15:00,228
you talked about it and then
it died,

1142
01:15:00,261 --> 01:15:02,130
as far as I was concerned.

1143
01:15:02,163 --> 01:15:03,498
Well, to answer your question,

1144
01:15:03,531 --> 01:15:05,734
you really can't just
straightforward answer it,

1145
01:15:05,767 --> 01:15:07,736
it's more like a three part answer.

1146
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:11,406
At the time, immediately,
I mean it made a big deal.

1147
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:13,241
In the medium term,
and I'm talking about

1148
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:16,644
for like the next five,
six years, seven years,

1149
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,980
they had a Momo Day celebration,

1150
01:15:19,013 --> 01:15:22,417
Momo sales with the businesses
and so forth.

1151
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:25,086
And people came to town and
shared in that

1152
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,290
and did business in town and
it promoted the town.

1153
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:34,796
In the long term,
let's say after 30 years,

1154
01:15:34,829 --> 01:15:36,498
we've had a lot of time passed,

1155
01:15:36,531 --> 01:15:37,932
it doesn't make any difference.

1156
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:39,200
I mean you're the first people

1157
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:42,270
I've heard talk about Momo in
years, that's it.

1158
01:15:42,303 --> 01:15:44,506
I mean it's just somethin' in
the paper, a little blurb,

1159
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:47,675
"Remember Momo,"
and that's the extent of it.

1160
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,445
Yes, I definitely think Momo
is an important part

1161
01:15:50,478 --> 01:15:52,213
of the Louisiana town history.

1162
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:53,715
Whether you believe it or
whether you don't believe it,

1163
01:15:53,748 --> 01:15:56,384
I think it's an important
part of the history.

1164
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:58,720
There's probably not anybody
you could ask

1165
01:15:58,753 --> 01:16:01,523
that wouldn't know about it,
so definitely.

1166
01:16:01,556 --> 01:16:03,358
Whether you're young or old,

1167
01:16:03,391 --> 01:16:06,895
as a youngster you may not
have been here,

1168
01:16:06,928 --> 01:16:09,864
you didn't see it,
but Grandma talks about it,

1169
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,299
Grandpa talks about it.

1170
01:16:11,332 --> 01:16:14,035
Aunt and Uncle,
"Oh, yeah, I was there when."

1171
01:16:14,068 --> 01:16:17,372
And I think that's a part of
Louisiana history.

1172
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:18,973
I don't think it'll ever die.

1173
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:21,843
I mean, who knows,
Momo might come back to visit.

1174
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:31,786
You might see a movie like
"The Legend of Boggy Creek"

1175
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:33,254
or "Creature From Black Lake",

1176
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,890
or even the never released,
"Momo the Missouri Monster",

1177
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,460
as a silly,
stupid reflection of history,

1178
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:41,196
an unreal take on the real events,

1179
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,964
but that ain't the way I see it.

1180
01:16:42,997 --> 01:16:44,699
Movies are entertainment, sure,

1181
01:16:44,732 --> 01:16:47,435
sometimes silly,
sometimes over the top,

1182
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:49,003
sometimes downright terrible.

1183
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,942
But movies like this perpetuate
a significant story.

1184
01:16:53,975 --> 01:16:56,144
"Momo the Missouri Monster"
is important

1185
01:16:56,177 --> 01:16:59,247
because it's doing its own
small part to preserve an event

1186
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:03,084
that the town itself is doing
its best to forget.

1187
01:17:03,117 --> 01:17:05,653
Is it factually accurate in
every detail?

1188
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:09,657
Nah, but no retelling of any
story ever is.

1189
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:12,227
The best that we can hope for
is that in time,

1190
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,629
the legend of Momo isn't forgotten.

1191
01:17:14,662 --> 01:17:16,531
That the monster and the people

1192
01:17:16,564 --> 01:17:19,300
whose lives it affected, are remembered,

1193
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:22,270
their experiences and stories
are preserved.

1194
01:17:25,106 --> 01:17:27,709
You might say it's just a
silly little monster movie

1195
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,512
and maybe you're right,

1196
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:33,882
but to some of us,
it's a whole lot more.
