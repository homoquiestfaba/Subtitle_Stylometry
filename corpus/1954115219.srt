2
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,228
The first one I killed?

3
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,730
Yes.

4
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,033
I don't actually
remember where I killed 'em

5
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,535
'cause I wasn't planning on
killing any of them.

6
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,621
And what happens is...

7
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,678
I've had sex with a lot of women and I don't
really know where everyone is I killed.

8
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:38,682
I don't know where I killed the first one.
That was Coffield.

9
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,850
- Let's not talk about that.
- Okay.

10
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,061
Let's go with the ones
that we have not found yet,

11
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,439
the ones you know that are still 
out there that haven't been discovered.

12
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,358
That's where
we'd like to start with.

13
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,278
And... pick whichever one
you want to start with,

14
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,281
whatever one is
freshest in your mind.

15
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,952
And maybe we could...
Maybe there are areas...

16
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,746
General areas of the county
you might want to start with.

17
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,791
- The ones we were talking about.
- Just start with the site.

18
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,127
And where's that body,

19
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,754
and then what you remember
about it will be fine.

20
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,007
We'll go to the farthest one out.

21
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,050
I think it's over by...

22
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,222
Fall City exit off of l-90.

23
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,018
- Okay.
- And...

24
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,440
You go...

25
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,984
I don't have a map in my mind.

26
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,280
You go out to, I think,
Fall City, and...

27
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,782
I think it's Fall City.
And you take a right

28
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,202
and you go down a long road

29
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,997
and there's a...

30
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,668
there's a blacktop road
off to the right,

31
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,129
and you go
about maybe half a mile

32
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,966
and there's a hill,
and you go up the hill,

33
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,595
and I put a body there

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,096
off the...

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,682
Parked over there.
It was at night.

36
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,476
Was it dark when you did it?

37
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,395
Dark when I did it,
and it was...

38
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,106
I'm quite sure I can find it.

39
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,444
Something like, I think, 197 East,

40
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,489
or something like that...
197, I think.

41
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,491
Marilyn Jones.

42
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,827
Lacy Edwards.

43
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,916
Marie Thompson.

44
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,381
April Fordham.

45
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,594
Tracy Winston.

46
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,475
Ken Nelson.

47
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,564
Lisa Yates.

48
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:58,571
Patricia Barczak.

49
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,411
Wendy Lee Coffield.

50
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,708
Opal Mills.

51
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,006
Carol Christensen.

52
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,803
Delores Williams.

53
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,350
Carrie Rois.

54
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,938
Jane Doe, B-20.

55
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,110
Jane Doe, B-21.

56
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,740
Cheryl Wims.

57
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,412
Kim Malvar.

58
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,959
In his lengthy confession
given to prosecutors,

59
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,629
Ridgway stated that he wanted to kill
as many prostitutes as he could,

60
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:01,134
and admitted to murdering 48 women
whom he remembered by name.

61
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,728
- Nice place.
- Yeah.

62
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,022
Sometimes l...

63
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,525
I took the women just home.

64
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,319
It was the easiest way.
I told my son Kevin

65
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,407
that Daddy had to save their souls.

66
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,994
Hi, I'm Kevin.
What's your name?

67
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,830
My name's Honey.
Nice to meet you.

68
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,215
You know I love you, Kevin.

69
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,766
Wow. Kinda messy.

70
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,234
Stop being so serious, Gary.

71
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:13,368
Gee, you're awfully
complicated, mister.

72
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:24,045
- Hey, relax!
- Take a shower.

73
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,672
Look, I don't have time
for any of that.

74
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,882
- I'm gonna leave.
- I said take a shower!

75
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,468
- No!
- Stop messing with me.

76
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,262
Take a shower.

77
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,931
You always play.
Take your hands off me!

78
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,145
Hey, no problem, all right.
I'll take a shower.

79
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,940
But remember, it's another Ben Frank
for each additional hour.

80
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,568
And I need to be paid
in advance, all right?

81
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,592
How about you?

82
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,261
You're still dressed.

83
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,097
That's not fair.

84
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,145
Play with yourself.

85
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,367
What's wrong?

86
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,620
Take a pee.

87
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,873
What?

88
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,084
Piss.

89
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,170
Golden shower's another Ben.

90
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,055
Wow, I'm gonna get rich today.

91
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,852
Could I have a glass of water?

92
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,313
I want you to get plenty.

93
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,751
Where do you want to get it?

94
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,963
In the bathtub maybe?

95
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,966
That way you don't have
to clean up afterwards.

96
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,742
I have to take a shit first.

97
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,123
Is that okay?

98
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,458
Yeah, perfect.

99
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,003
All right, leave.

100
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,655
Wanna wipe my ass?

101
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,783
You can if you like.

102
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,011
Now, suck it.

103
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,859
You scared me, Gary.

104
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,986
Why did you do that?

105
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,992
Because I like it.

106
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,960
You turn me on!

107
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,964
Ah, it's so big.

108
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,682
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

109
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,022
Ouch, that hurts!

110
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,899
Where's your son?

111
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,526
His name's Kevin, right?

112
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,077
What do you want?

113
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,745
- I'll do anything!
- Oh, yeah?

114
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,583
How about a little sucky sucky
or 69?

115
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,839
What's your favorite scene,
Gary boy?

116
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,257
Oh, yeah.

117
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,054
Bad boy, you're so sweet!

118
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,432
Mommy knows you are!

119
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,238
"'Be quiet and do not play, '
answered the frog.

120
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:32,534
'I'm gonna give you
the good advice.

121
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:36,746
But what will the dog
give me if I fetch it,

122
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,957
that toy thing up again?"'

123
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,835
He was good boy.

124
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,920
Never talked back.

125
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:49,009
A little slow in school,
so I made him read a lot.

126
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,719
You know, say stuff,
you know,

127
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:54,139
all that good stuff like Anderson
and the Brothers Grimm

128
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,599
and so on and so forth.

129
00:16:56,725 --> 00:17:00,520
"Will it love me and
let me be a companion

130
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,231
and playful
and sit at that table..."

131
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,108
Fairy tales, right?

132
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,195
Good old-fashioned
fairy tales.

133
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,117
"And drink from the cup and sleep
in the bedroom bed.

134
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,953
And thou will promise me all these.

135
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,041
Then I will dive down and fetch up
the golden bowl."

136
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,003
Alicia Miller.

137
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,298
Mary Chang Ho.

138
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,968
Kim Beckwith.

139
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,181
Elena Stone.

140
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:41,019
Jane Doe, B-47.

141
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,023
Jane Doe, B-48.

142
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,116
Most of the time, I would

143
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,995
go in there, in the house...
all the time I would go in the house.

144
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,122
I'd go to the bathroom
and wash up.

145
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:03,291
And...

146
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,210
sometimes she'd go
into the bathroom.

147
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,420
I don't know if she did or not.

148
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:11,508
And sometimes we'd shower,

149
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,009
both of us,

150
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:16,971
and go on back
into the bedroom,

151
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,433
and...

152
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,815
get completely naked,

153
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,275
and have, usually,

154
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,115
oral sex first.

155
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:38,284
And then I'd be on top.

156
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,953
And if l...

157
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,791
It was a combination
if I had a bad...

158
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:49,379
bad day at work or... anger,

159
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,964
I would...

160
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,924
If I couldn't have a climax,

161
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,302
I would get behind her
and sometimes I'd...

162
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,893
If she... If she...

163
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,312
just laid there

164
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,856
and just didn't do anything,

165
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,316
she wants to hurry up,

166
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,944
and the combination of things,

167
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,864
then I'd just explode and that's it.

168
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,825
You know, I'd kill the woman.

169
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,537
I didn't see their faces.

170
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,624
Hey, relax!

171
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,210
I didn't look at them
much after I killed them.

172
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,801
We'll get along further.

173
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,617
I keep having
those nghtmares of myself,

174
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,577
getting cut up and stuff.

175
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,329
Always the same dreams,

176
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,290
as if it's trying
to tell me something.

177
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,210
Maybe if I had enough money, l...

178
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,755
I would've looked up some fancy shrink
down in LA or so

179
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,842
to tell me what
that's all about.

180
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,594
And then there's Boris,
my buddy,

181
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,597
creepin' up in my dreams
like some phantom or something.

182
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,975
Always lookin' for me.

183
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,352
He's been dead a long time.

184
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:14,024
It must have been some time in November,
'79, if I'm not mistaken.

185
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,901
Yeah, yeah, that was it.

186
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,112
November 27, '79.

187
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,114
Yeah, that's when he died,

188
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,950
on Thanksgiving, 1979.

189
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:27,329
I remember that day
as if it was yesterday.

190
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,597
July 15, 1982.

191
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,475
Lisa Lee discovers
the body of Hedy Lauren

192
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,728
at the Green River
between Kent and Tukwila

193
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,689
near Seattle
in the state of Washington.

194
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,650
Within a month,
seven bodies of young women

195
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,694
are discovered
along the Green River.

196
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,404
The King County police launches

197
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,699
the Green River Task Force
to solve the killings,

198
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,327
which seem to be the work
of a serial killer.

199
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,746
Is there anything else?

200
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:12,499
Okay, if you can have
that package together,

201
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,543
I'll send my deputy
on to pick it up.

202
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:18,505
All right? Thanks.

203
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,465
Just got a call
from the forensics lab.

204
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,509
The last one that
they found out there,

205
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:25,053
they just confirmed that
her larynx was crushed.

206
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:28,848
There's bruising on the larynx.
There's external bruising around the neck.

207
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:32,394
I need to have you run out
and pick up that package.

208
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,229
All right, not a problem.

209
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,398
Hey, I've been hearin'
some talk around town

210
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,275
that Mona down at the bar might know
a bunch of these girls.

211
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,653
- I was thinking of bringing her in.
- Yeah, get her in here.

212
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:42,862
- All right.
- All right?

213
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:43,947
- Sounds good.
- Good.

214
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:50,620
So, what have you been up to,
Gary, man?

215
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,497
Meet any girls lately?

216
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:58,003
Come on, you don't have
to hide things from us, Gary, man.

217
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,505
Yeah, we're, like, good buddies,
you know,

218
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:05,176
and good buddies don't hide secrets
from each other, right, Kerry?

219
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,888
Yeah. Let me tell you a secret.
You wanna hear a secret, Gary, man?

220
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:13,476
You gonna really...
You gonna tell him, Kerry?

221
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,437
Of course.
He ought to know, man.

222
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:21,651
Come on, what they say about him,
all those dirty things.

223
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,529
You know, Gary, man, the dirty things
they say about you?

224
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,993
They say you're
the Green River Gary.

225
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,748
You know.
And... And you know why?

226
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,167
I've seen you down at the river.

227
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,128
What are you doin'
over there, huh?

228
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,922
He's just minding his business, Kerry.

229
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,216
You know. Leave him alone.

230
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,802
Well, you down there
trying to catch fish?

231
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,059
I don't see you catching fish.

232
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:57,437
I watched you.
I was fishing.

233
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,191
Well, you tell him, Jimmy.

234
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,527
No. No.

235
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:07,947
You oughta tell him.
You... You brought it up.

236
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:11,451
They say you're the Green River killer.

237
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,838
- All the people?
- Yeah.

238
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,924
What people?

239
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:28,677
People we've been talking to.

240
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:33,515
They say you're
the Green River killer, Gary.

241
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,850
You think it's funny?

242
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,519
Yeah.

243
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,188
Very funny.

244
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,479
My wife Irene
is always working during the day,

245
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:48,525
seven days a week while I did night shift
at Harold and Johnsons,

246
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:53,029
the packing place
I worked for from '75 to '89.

247
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:55,615
We didn't see much of each other,

248
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,910
except for a few hours
here and there, and...

249
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:07,502
When I didn't watch over Kevin,

250
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:09,587
it was her turn.

251
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:11,256
Kevin, honey, you home?

252
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:14,968
- She did a pretty good job, yeah.
- Kevin, baby, where are you?

253
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:18,638
She did.
She's not a bad woman.

254
00:27:18,763 --> 00:27:20,807
Kevin, are you in here?

255
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:24,936
Oh, a little goofy sometimes,
you know.

256
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:28,273
- Saying wrong things at the wrong time.
- You all right?

257
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:29,649
Where's Daddy?

258
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:35,113
- When did he leave?
- About an hour ago.

259
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:38,575
Okay. Are you hungry?

260
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:43,246
Did Daddy make you
anything to eat?

261
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,373
What did he make you?

262
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:47,125
Popcorn.

263
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,795
Popcorn?
That's not a real dinner.

264
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,798
Do you want
french fries with ketchup?

265
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:55,383
Okay.

266
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,518
Not now, Gary.

267
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,896
It's late. I'm tired.

268
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:16,613
You know,
if you made more money,

269
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,823
I wouldn't have
to work so much.

270
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:22,035
You know, and then I could
be home and ready for you.

271
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:32,504
Come on, I didn't mean it like that.

272
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,095
Come here.

273
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,103
I've been married three times.

274
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,230
Come on, I apologize.
Okay, baby?

275
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:54,734
But everybody else is
getting divorced, you know.

276
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,654
I guess...

277
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,948
there may have been
a lot less girls dying

278
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:02,617
if I had a nice woman
to come home to.

279
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,202
Don't be upset.

280
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,746
I never thought about that.

281
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:10,542
I think that... that
would have been something.

282
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:15,463
Well, all right then.
Fuck you.

283
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,028
Prostitutes were the easiest.

284
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:40,363
I went from having sex with them,

285
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:44,659
to just plain killing them.

286
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:52,375
That's my girl.

287
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:26,660
Another vodka.

288
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,060
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

289
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,608
So how do you like it, honey?

290
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,152
Got some extra cash, honey?

291
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:26,363
Oh, yeah.

292
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:30,200
B&D is okay with me.
S&M is out.

293
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:32,786
Okay.

294
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:36,247
So, show me.

295
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,833
You gotta show me the money first.

296
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,587
So, how about some money?

297
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,339
Okay.

298
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,349
Nice.

299
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,353
- Okay, watch.
- Okay.

300
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,563
I want you to watch.

301
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,273
All right.

302
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:05,235
Lay down and watch.

303
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,090
Take your clothes off.

304
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,154
You're so strong.

305
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:36,201
Oh, I like that.

306
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:05,605
You're a bad, a bad boy, Gary.

307
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,608
Would you like
to give me a little spanking?

308
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:15,281
- I want you to suck something.
- Sure.

309
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,409
Now suck it.

310
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:19,285
Suck it good.

311
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:36,594
Hey! Take it easy!

312
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,431
- What's wrong with you?
- Chill out.

313
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,894
- You're wrong for this.
- You know what?

314
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,272
- What? What? What?
- I'm not too crazy about all this.

315
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:50,692
Why don't I just give you back some
of your money and we'll call it a day, okay?

316
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:52,527
No. Come here.

317
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,738
You don't take "no"
for an answer, do you?

318
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:57,490
- Fuck, I'm done with this!
- Done with what?

319
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,117
I'm leaving.

320
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,745
Where you going, huh?

321
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,791
You're fucking crazy!

322
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:11,379
You're fucking crazy, asshole!

323
00:36:11,504 --> 00:36:13,965
Stop it. Stop terrorizing me, asshole.

324
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:16,009
Okay.

325
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:18,261
Now, open the door and let me out.

326
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:20,180
Move! Now!

327
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:24,434
Take it easy.

328
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:28,146
Open the door and let me out.
Move!

329
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:34,027
Okay, I was just trying
to have some fun.

330
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:36,071
Go. It's okay.

331
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:39,199
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Go, go.

332
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:46,498
- What do you want from me?
- You want some fun, huh?

333
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:51,252
You want to fuck with me, huh?
You want to fuck with me?

334
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,769
Gary, this is...

335
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:10,563
this is actually quite a turn-on.

336
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:12,941
You... You turn me on like crazy.

337
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:14,442
Really?

338
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,946
- Uh-huh.
- That's good.

339
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:26,246
You know, I could give it
to you real good.

340
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:28,456
All day long if you like.

341
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:50,437
You fuckin' bitch!
You fuckin' bitch!

342
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:53,523
How do you like that, huh?

343
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:29,559
But I'm not... I'm not sick.

344
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,772
I'm not a sick man. L...

345
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:38,401
I killed because I could.

346
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,780
I mean, I just wanted to kill.

347
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:46,660
But I couldn't stop for a while.

348
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:49,954
You said what? It's 48?

349
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,291
I say it's more like 80.

350
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,752
Or maybe a hundred,
or even more.

351
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:00,256
I don't remember.

352
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:02,759
Yeah. No, no, no.

353
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:06,721
I can't tell you
most of their names. I...

354
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:09,307
I didn't know their names.

355
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:51,057
I was...

356
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:55,103
When I was finished...
when I was done with them,

357
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:58,064
I'd put them on the truck,
cigarette and all.

358
00:39:58,148 --> 00:40:01,067
Sittin' right there next to me
as if they were still alive.

359
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:04,946
And then I dropped them
up at the river.

360
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:08,450
Yeah, then I dropped them
at the river.

361
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:19,336
I... I killed them.

362
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:22,714
I didn't torture them.

363
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:26,468
They went fast.

364
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:41,900
I'm showing you a photograph
of a truck you used to own.

365
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:45,945
- Yes.
- With license PR5996.

366
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,864
- Did you used to own that truck?
- Yes, I did.

367
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:50,659
And is this the truck
you're talking about?

368
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:53,953
- Yes, it is.
- And did you kill...

369
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,999
When you talk about killing
the women in a truck,

370
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:00,293
is this the truck that most of them
occurred in?

371
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:03,838
This is the truck that most of them...
Until the truck got totaled.

372
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:06,716
I think I killed

373
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:09,636
I don't know how many
in the other truck.

374
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:13,014
One of the first ten or so.

375
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:15,767
- First ten you did?
- I'm just guessing ten.

376
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:17,644
Relatively early on in the series?

377
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:22,273
Yes, because the first seven
I did in November.

378
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:26,319
There's no... It's just
in my mind where it was.

379
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,571
I try to keep that all in my mind,

380
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,991
'cause...

381
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,244
I wanted to...

382
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:38,748
I wanted them to be found.

383
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:41,167
- You wanted them to be found?
- Yeah.

384
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:43,003
And...

385
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:48,466
one time I made a map and kind
of located on the map where I put 'em.

386
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,177
All of the victims, I think.

387
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,971
Where's that map now?

388
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,640
I threw that away.
I went back and tore it up.

389
00:41:55,765 --> 00:41:58,852
It would have been
with my stuff if I had it.

390
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:01,271
Are you sure it's gone
and you don't have it?

391
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:02,147
No, I don't have it at all.

392
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,109
We found another one of your girls
down at the river, dead.

393
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:07,152
Jesus.

394
00:42:07,277 --> 00:42:09,112
Her name's Gena Bellweather.

395
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:13,325
She was murdered
some 48 hours ago.

396
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,618
It makes it ten
in less than a year.

397
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:18,455
Now, we gotta find this killer.

398
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,415
I don't know what to tell ya.

399
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,711
There's so many different hicks that
come in there to pick up girls, you know.

400
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:27,339
Did anybody in particular stand out?
Maybe look strange?

401
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:30,800
Anything? Nothing?

402
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:35,055
Yeah, you know,
there is one guy.

403
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,724
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

404
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:41,478
He's different. He's kind of...
He's just different.

405
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:44,898
He's not one of the typical hicks
that grew up around here.

406
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:46,983
What's he look like?

407
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:51,279
He's kinda tall,
good-lookin', dreamy eyes.

408
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:54,783
You know,
he's kind of charming.

409
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:59,537
Hey, I'm lookin' for Gary Ridgway.

410
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,376
He's over there.

411
00:43:07,837 --> 00:43:09,798
What's that all about?

412
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:20,183
Gary Ridgway.

413
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:22,894
- Detective Dawson, S.P.D.
- Lieutenant Cole.

414
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:28,566
Got a few pictures I want to show you.
See if you recognize any of these women.

415
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:31,695
No.

416
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,574
Familiar?

417
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:39,619
Recognize her?

418
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,913
No, I...

419
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:44,499
Well, they hang out at the bar
you frequent.

420
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:49,713
You know the bar
you're at all the time?

421
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:53,008
And you don't know
any of those girls?

422
00:43:53,133 --> 00:43:54,884
You want to show him
the pictures again?

423
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:56,845
How about her?

424
00:43:56,928 --> 00:43:58,888
Her name's Gena Bellweather.

425
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:02,267
Mean anything to you, Gary?

426
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,228
You recognize that name?
Gena Bellweather?

427
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,440
You know Mona, Gary?

428
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:13,903
- Who?
- Mona... she owns the bar.

429
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:16,614
- Oh. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

430
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,118
She says you've been going out
with a couple of her girls.

431
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:23,830
I hear you spend a lot of time
down by the river.

432
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:29,794
Catch much fish
down there, Gary?

433
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:34,883
What do you do down
at the river, Gary?

434
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:37,594
Water's a little too muddy
for fishing, Gary.

435
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:41,514
Yeah, you don't look like too much
of a nature boy to me.

436
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:44,267
Maybe if you're not pullin'
somethin' out of the river,

437
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:46,519
you're puttin' something in.

438
00:44:48,855 --> 00:44:51,608
I think we better talk
to your supervisor, Gary.

439
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:53,693
Find out how you've been
spendin' your time.

440
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:56,071
You may want to get
an attorney.

441
00:44:56,196 --> 00:44:57,864
Soon.

442
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:02,369
We'll be back.

443
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:07,832
Can we talk to you guys?
How long you known Gary?

444
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:13,380
- Just four weeks.
- I'm all ears, son.

445
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:16,633
You ever seen any...

446
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:19,052
weird things in the back... tarps?

447
00:45:21,137 --> 00:45:23,431
- What's my name?
- God, Gary...

448
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:25,433
Don't play games with me!

449
00:45:25,517 --> 00:45:28,061
It was just a joke.
I was just kidding.

450
00:45:28,144 --> 00:45:31,523
I was just kidding.
We were just kidding!

451
00:45:31,606 --> 00:45:35,902
Nobody believes
you're the Green River killer.

452
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:39,280
It was just a joke!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

453
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:40,699
- Gary, I'm sorry!
- What's my name?

454
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:43,284
- It's Gary.
- Shut up!

455
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,370
Say it slowly.
What's my name?

456
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,580
Gary. Gary Ridgway.

457
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,834
- That's right.
- We were just kidding.

458
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:25,452
You said there was a hiatus
where you didn't kill anybody.

459
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,788
It was between...
I don't think I killed anybody between...

460
00:46:30,999 --> 00:46:35,628
I think it was August through... Christmas,
I think.

461
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:37,839
Because I was going
with Ellen.

462
00:46:37,964 --> 00:46:41,843
- What year would that have been?
- '84, I think.

463
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:06,951
I had an okay childhood,

464
00:47:07,035 --> 00:47:10,121
I guess.

465
00:47:12,248 --> 00:47:14,167
I didn't do anything bad,

466
00:47:14,292 --> 00:47:16,628
except for...

467
00:47:16,753 --> 00:47:18,505
what was it...

468
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,341
maybe suffocating a cat
once in a while.

469
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:22,884
Or...

470
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:24,886
What was it?

471
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:27,389
Paying a little girl
a couple of bucks to, you know,

472
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,432
to play with her.

473
00:47:29,516 --> 00:47:31,226
And...

474
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:35,063
At...

475
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,441
It was...

476
00:47:38,525 --> 00:47:40,819
At thirteen, yeah, l...

477
00:47:42,153 --> 00:47:44,489
I think I stabbed a little boy,

478
00:47:44,572 --> 00:47:45,907
but...

479
00:47:48,118 --> 00:47:49,786
I forgot why.

480
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:02,424
I have a lot of fun with my boy.

481
00:48:04,884 --> 00:48:06,803
I haven't seen him
in a couple of years.

482
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:09,848
He's been on the road
driving trucks

483
00:48:09,931 --> 00:48:13,435
for that shipping company
down in Portland.

484
00:48:13,518 --> 00:48:15,311
Yeah.

485
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:18,440
But he calls me
every now and then.

486
00:48:18,523 --> 00:48:20,775
He never finished high school.

487
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:23,570
What the heck.
Neither did I, right?

488
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:25,280
Jobs aren't...

489
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:28,074
aren't comin' easy your way
anymore these days,

490
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:30,243
even when you've graduated
from college.

491
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:32,370
Ah, no.

492
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,748
Nothin' is what it used to be.

493
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:37,000
Nothin' at all.

494
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:39,210
I mean, look...
look, I mean.

495
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:41,421
Look, look, look at the...

496
00:48:41,546 --> 00:48:43,715
at the Seahawks, right?

497
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:47,677
Or what's the other team?

498
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:51,014
The Raiders.
Just look at the Raiders.

499
00:48:51,097 --> 00:48:54,893
They used to be
a great team back in...

500
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:57,187
the '80s.

501
00:48:57,312 --> 00:49:00,106
Doris Koons.

502
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,652
Kim Willard.

503
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:06,154
Regina Metz.

504
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:09,574
Ellie Stanton.

505
00:49:15,246 --> 00:49:18,958
It sort of bothers me.
There's something about this guy.

506
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:25,006
On the other hand, he really doesn't fit
the profile of a serial killer.

507
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,385
Married, 14 years.
A kid.

508
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:29,969
I don't know.

509
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,181
It just doesn't add up.

510
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:37,435
- Yeah?
- Gary Ridgway?

511
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,772
- Detective Dawson, S.P.D.
- Gary, how you doin'?

512
00:49:40,855 --> 00:49:44,067
We got a couple of questions.
You mind if we ask 'em to ya?

513
00:49:45,902 --> 00:49:49,406
- Gary, are you married?
- Yeah.

514
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:52,742
That's funny, 'cause somebody mentioned
they might have seen you come in here

515
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:55,036
with a prostitute named Annie?

516
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:59,124
You know, one of
the girls from the bar?

517
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:05,839
Look, we don't want
to bug you too much.

518
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:09,050
But we'd like to come in and look around.
Do you mind?

519
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,011
Yes, I do mind.

520
00:50:21,896 --> 00:50:26,693
There's this buddy of mine, Boris.

521
00:50:26,776 --> 00:50:29,279
Maybe... something.

522
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:33,867
You know, like a friend.

523
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,537
But then again, I, I...

524
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,623
I don't really have
many friends, you know?

525
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,714
But Boris was the one who...

526
00:50:47,797 --> 00:50:51,885
He's the one who got me...
who got me into all this.

527
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:56,389
He used to pick up hookers
at the Bellan's bar on...

528
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:00,352
on the east side of town.

529
00:51:10,278 --> 00:51:13,323
He had a nice place up north
where he took them.

530
00:51:13,406 --> 00:51:17,118
And he let me watch them
from the outside.

531
00:51:46,064 --> 00:51:47,607
So, I'm...

532
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:49,943
I'm standing there in the dark,

533
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:52,904
and watching him
having sex with those girls,

534
00:51:52,988 --> 00:51:54,656
and then killing them.

535
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,324
Yeah.

536
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,119
Boris is what you might want to call

537
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:03,248
a hero of mine, or a mentor,

538
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:05,792
or something like that.

539
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:34,154
But Boris, he...
you know, he only killed

540
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:36,823
like maybe two or three girls...
that was it.

541
00:52:36,906 --> 00:52:38,908
Just two or three.

542
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:04,976
There was this brunette.

543
00:53:07,854 --> 00:53:12,067
There was one that was missing.
I think he showed me.

544
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:13,943
Long hair.

545
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:20,617
What color hair?
Do you remember?

546
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,078
I think it's brown.

547
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:28,541
Not puffed up,
just kind of...

548
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:36,716
I think that was her, yes.
I think.

549
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:40,637
This girl was not that tall?

550
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:43,014
Not much taller than me,
but skinnier and...

551
00:53:44,974 --> 00:53:47,268
Do you recall
how she was dressed?

552
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:54,150
- No, I can't.
- Okay. Where you picked her up?

553
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:56,987
It had to be the victim or...

554
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:02,409
And she was the one that...
I dated her before.

555
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,202
I dated her before.

556
00:54:04,285 --> 00:54:05,912
So you dated the...

557
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:08,248
I didn't date her before,
but I dated other people...

558
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:09,791
Not the same cycle.

559
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:13,003
That was before I used my place
for everybody.

560
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:16,923
One last time.

561
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:20,301
One last time.

562
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:32,397
You guys have to stop
following me.

563
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:35,984
Like I wasn't the guy
you were lookin' for.

564
00:54:37,068 --> 00:54:39,612
One last time.

565
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:11,413
- It's a nice place.
- Yeah.

566
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:22,340
Have a seat.

567
00:56:26,511 --> 00:56:28,972
You got some music
or somethin'?

568
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,958
You don't live here
by yourself, do you?

569
00:56:57,042 --> 00:56:58,877
Your wife?

570
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:04,799
Don't you think we should
do this someplace else?

571
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:10,138
I mean,
if I were your wife...

572
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:14,559
I'd just feel
a little more comfortable...

573
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:18,605
Do you want to do it in the kitchen?
We could do the dishes.

574
00:57:24,402 --> 00:57:26,988
All right, I could
suck your dick if you like.

575
00:57:38,249 --> 00:57:40,627
Do you hear something?

576
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:47,133
Someone's here.

577
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,526
Gary, is everything okay?

578
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:15,203
Hi, I'm Louise, from Portland.

579
00:58:15,286 --> 00:58:17,205
Remember Gary's cousin,
Louise?

580
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:20,959
I was just about to go
back to the bus stop.

581
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:25,088
So, Gary,
can you take me back?

582
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:26,840
Yeah.

583
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:30,969
It was nice meeting
you again... Irene?

584
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,731
I don't know
about this place, Gary.

585
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:45,275
There's a nice little motel
right around the corner.

586
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:49,404
You don't want to make yourself
a little more comfy?

587
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:56,578
Actually, I don't know whether
I should go out with you.

588
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,332
But you're kinda cute.

589
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:03,001
Crazy like hell, but cute.

590
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:07,047
Okay, what do you
wanna talk about?

591
00:59:08,673 --> 00:59:10,508
What do you wanna do?

592
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,433
Stop it!

593
01:02:09,854 --> 01:02:11,564
Who is it?

594
01:02:13,608 --> 01:02:14,693
Who's there?

595
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:17,529
Mrs. Ridgway, Seattle P.D.

596
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:20,490
Can I help you?

597
01:02:20,615 --> 01:02:22,909
Yeah, are you
the wife of Gary Ridgway?

598
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:24,077
Yes.

599
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,080
We have a search warrant
to search the premises.

600
01:02:27,205 --> 01:02:28,957
Why? What for?

601
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,798
- Got anything in there?
- Is this the master bedroom?

602
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:44,848
I'll check the bathroom.

603
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:53,023
How long you been married,
Mrs. Ridgway?

604
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:55,066
14 years.

605
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:59,112
- Does this belong to you?
- Yes.

606
01:02:59,195 --> 01:03:01,156
- You got anything?
- No.

607
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:21,343
Huh?

608
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:24,804
They came back again today

609
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:26,931
asking all sorts of questions.

610
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:32,020
Are you sure
everything is okay?

611
01:03:33,605 --> 01:03:36,358
Why are they Zeroing in on you?

612
01:03:42,864 --> 01:03:46,076
And what about
this cousin of yours?

613
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:48,536
What was that all about?

614
01:05:13,204 --> 01:05:15,957
Oh, no, honey.
You gotta leave.

615
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,835
Go on. Go on. Go. Out!

616
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:29,012
What's wrong with you guys?

617
01:06:01,252 --> 01:06:04,964
That's also where...
where Boris comes in.

618
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:14,057
You... You see, in my dreams,

619
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:16,351
he's in that hospital.

620
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:19,145
That morgue or whatever
the place where they...

621
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:21,356
You know, where they cut you up.

622
01:06:24,317 --> 01:06:26,861
He's right there... watching.

623
01:06:26,987 --> 01:06:29,114
Like some... some sicko

624
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:33,284
getting excited when he sees me
being all messed up and stuff.

625
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:37,122
And I can't let that happen.
No way.

626
01:08:38,952 --> 01:08:42,580
The time had come to
stop fooling around with those girls.

627
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,708
Too many stupid-ass guys

628
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:49,879
kept teasing me,
calling me Green River Gary.

629
01:08:49,963 --> 01:08:51,506
My wife...

630
01:08:51,589 --> 01:08:55,510
Well, she started
to get suspicious too.

631
01:08:55,593 --> 01:08:59,848
So I went back to the river
for one last time

632
01:08:59,973 --> 01:09:01,850
and called it quits.

633
01:09:01,933 --> 01:09:03,476
That's...

634
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,520
That's when it all came together.

635
01:09:12,235 --> 01:09:15,989
Finally, all of it with...

636
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:18,325
my buddy Boris and me.

637
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:24,748
I had to kill him...

638
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:26,833
because he saw it.

639
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,303
He'd witnessed me killing
that little girl.

640
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:40,138
I forgot her name.

641
01:09:40,263 --> 01:09:42,474
Let's see, l...

642
01:09:42,599 --> 01:09:45,101
What is it? I think...

643
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:50,148
Oh, it was... Marie or...

644
01:09:50,231 --> 01:09:52,150
Marianne something.

645
01:09:52,233 --> 01:09:54,778
Anyways, I couldn't...

646
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:57,864
I couldn't have that.
I'm sorry it slowed down.

647
01:09:57,906 --> 01:10:00,492
I just, you know...
I couldn't have that.

648
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:05,205
Sharing my secrets...
That wasn't for me.

649
01:10:09,042 --> 01:10:11,252
So I decided he had to go.

650
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:15,715
The guy who invented it as far
as I was concerned...

651
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:19,302
The guy who taught me,
who got me into all this...

652
01:10:21,262 --> 01:10:23,473
he had to go.

653
01:10:23,598 --> 01:10:27,727
It's as simple as that.
So I...

654
01:10:27,852 --> 01:10:31,064
I killed him. Yeah.

655
01:10:31,147 --> 01:10:33,775
It must have hurt.

656
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,529
He's the only one
I hurt real bad.

657
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:39,906
After all, it was a man, right?

658
01:10:40,949 --> 01:10:43,076
So I gave it to him.

659
01:10:43,201 --> 01:10:45,328
I tortured him.

660
01:10:45,453 --> 01:10:48,623
It must have been a pretty
slow death. Poor guy.

661
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:52,711
Well, what the heck.

662
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,335
Gary Ridgway?

663
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:01,047
You're goin' down.
You're under arrest.

664
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,011
I discussed it with my client

665
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:09,681
and I'm sorry to tell you that
we're pleading not guilty to all charges.

666
01:13:09,806 --> 01:13:11,474
The man is innocent.

667
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:14,352
Sure, he's had some problems
with the prostitutes.

668
01:13:14,477 --> 01:13:16,646
He doesn't object
to that accusation.

669
01:13:18,064 --> 01:13:19,649
But he didn't kill any.

670
01:13:19,733 --> 01:13:22,485
He may be a john,
but he's not a killer.

671
01:13:24,362 --> 01:13:26,489
You may have found his semen

672
01:13:26,614 --> 01:13:28,783
on or inside their bodies.

673
01:13:29,826 --> 01:13:31,411
Gary hates condoms.

674
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:33,455
He admits to that.

675
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:37,250
But he wasn't the last one.

676
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:40,211
How are you going to prove
that he was the last one?

677
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:43,006
Who saw them? How are you gonna
prove that he killed them?

678
01:13:43,089 --> 01:13:45,967
You've got nothing on Mr. Ridgway.

679
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:49,512
You're just wasting
your time and your money.

680
01:13:50,805 --> 01:13:52,349
You should let him go.

681
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:55,143
He's not the man you're looking for.

682
01:13:56,227 --> 01:13:58,730
He's innocent and he's
gonna plead that way.

683
01:13:58,855 --> 01:14:01,650
Not guilty to all charges.

684
01:15:14,639 --> 01:15:16,558
I've discussed it with my client,

685
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:19,853
and he is willing to cooperate
if you can assure him

686
01:15:19,936 --> 01:15:24,149
that the death penalty will be
pulled and not considered.

687
01:15:24,274 --> 01:15:25,817
The process will be is that

688
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,987
we'll try to collect as much
information about these.

689
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:32,866
And that not today,
but within the next day or so,

690
01:15:32,949 --> 01:15:36,161
we'll be all getting into vans
and going out to locations

691
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:38,580
so that you can
show us in person

692
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:41,791
where some of these bodies are
or where you put them.

693
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:46,629
Uh, and so if when there is a need for these
field trips, as we're going to call them,

694
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:50,050
we'll let your attorneys know
and take the appropriate break

695
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:52,260
and we'll get into vans
and go out.

696
01:15:52,385 --> 01:15:55,013
And you can actually
show us these things.

697
01:15:55,096 --> 01:15:58,141
We'd like to start by
just having you, I think,

698
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,560
in your own words,
describe to us,

699
01:16:00,644 --> 01:16:02,062
as the proffer
has indicated,

700
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:06,941
there are 10 to 14 bodies out
there that we have not found.

701
01:16:07,025 --> 01:16:10,528
So I think a good starting point
would be

702
01:16:10,654 --> 01:16:14,032
allowing you to tell us,
sort of in your own words,

703
01:16:14,115 --> 01:16:17,744
about the first one that you can recall,
where it's at.

704
01:16:17,869 --> 01:16:20,580
The women I killed...
I don't give a damn.

705
01:16:20,664 --> 01:16:23,124
They were...
They were nothing.

706
01:16:23,249 --> 01:16:24,876
Nothing at all.

707
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:28,421
I would lie if I said
I regret any part of that.

708
01:16:28,546 --> 01:16:30,423
I don't.

709
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:32,300
Now, that I think of it,

710
01:16:32,384 --> 01:16:35,470
the secrets of my dreams
began to unravel.

711
01:16:35,553 --> 01:16:37,639
You know what I'm afraid of?

712
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:40,100
I'm afraid to die.

713
01:16:41,643 --> 01:16:43,353
I'm scared shitless.

714
01:16:43,478 --> 01:16:45,438
That's why I was so relieved, man.

715
01:16:45,563 --> 01:16:47,440
Man, was I relieved.

716
01:16:47,565 --> 01:16:51,486
We entered this plea bargain
because now...

717
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:54,239
you can't kill me, right?

718
01:16:54,364 --> 01:16:55,740
See?

719
01:16:57,742 --> 01:17:01,246
I'm determined
to stay alive forever.

720
01:17:01,329 --> 01:17:04,332
Maybe one day because of some
new laws or something,

721
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:05,875
I'll get out of prison.

722
01:17:05,959 --> 01:17:08,753
Be a free man again
and live forever.

723
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:12,048
Because... and this is
my greatest fear...

724
01:17:12,173 --> 01:17:14,884
that one day,
should I ever die,

725
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:18,763
you guys cut me up to look
for the evil inside of me...

726
01:17:18,888 --> 01:17:22,517
in my brains, in my guts,
everywhere.

727
01:17:22,642 --> 01:17:26,688
And l... I can't let that happen.

728
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:28,773
Yeah. Yeah.

729
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:33,361
Yeah. But I don't think you
really understand.

730
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:35,322
Nah, you don't.

731
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:37,824
Well, maybe someday.

732
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:40,994
Someday you will understand.

733
01:17:53,256 --> 01:17:58,345
Hello. Mom, it's me, your son, Kevin.

734
01:17:58,428 --> 01:18:00,889
I have a girl in my room.

735
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:03,141
But I...

736
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:08,647
I think I killed her.
