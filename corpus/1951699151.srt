1
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:34,000
SPECIES
THE AWAKENING

2
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:24,684
For the gods keep
the secrets of life

3
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,907
hidden from humans

4
00:01:26,942 --> 00:01:30,212
Men did however figure out
one secret:

5
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:32,828
How to use fire.

6
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:37,899
And Zeus punished them with the
worse thing he could think of

7
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:41,637
Something so terrible the
writer Hesiod called it:

8
00:01:41,672 --> 00:01:45,220
"the source of all
mortal suffering"

9
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:49,595
Any guess what punishment he came up with?

10
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:53,435
-Some kind of disease?
-No!

11
00:01:53,956 --> 00:01:55,884
-War?
-No!

12
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:00,684
-Fire, floods, drought?
-None of those

13
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:07,692
For their punishment,
Zeus gave them... women!

14
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:25,490
-Hello, uncle Tom?
-I am at the office!

15
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:39,927
Hey!

16
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:43,825
So, what's today experiment?

17
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:49,533
Biosynthesis. There are extinct plant
cells walls in this fossil

18
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:53,084
<latin>, type of equinoderme (?)

19
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:58,365
The (?) resembles flowers
Hence the name.

20
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:02,484
-Sea Lily
-Very good!

21
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,036
You know, theoretically, I can use the molecular

22
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:09,997
genetic material to create a
whole new breed of (?)

23
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,829
-Hmmm, Isn't that a little unnatural?
-Yeah

24
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:20,389
But interesting, right?

25
00:03:23,724 --> 00:03:26,669
You seem distracted.
Is everything all right?

26
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:31,228
It's Oxford.
they called me again this morning,

27
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:34,260
But I can't go England
and leave you here.

28
00:03:35,337 --> 00:03:39,977
You are the only family I've got.

29
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,184
I'll see you later
I have another class

30
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:12,413
Hey, uncle Tom
What are you cooking?

31
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:15,336
A fabulous red wine sauce
I hope you are hungry

32
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,348
Hmm, tempting,
but I have a date

33
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,160
He should already be here

34
00:04:22,312 --> 00:04:25,960
As far as going to England is concerned
you're too talented ...

35
00:04:25,995 --> 00:04:31,208
for this little pond.
- I thought we already settled that

36
00:04:32,224 --> 00:04:36,273
What if I came with you?
-Really?

37
00:04:37,153 --> 00:04:40,384
You are bright
You deserve it

38
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:44,537
And anyway, I'm getting a little homesick
It will be good for the two of us...

39
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:48,635
I don't know what to say

40
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:54,212
In cases like that
it's better to say nothing

41
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:56,957
A toast

42
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,833
-To your future!
-And to Oxford!

43
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:08,224
Ah, that was Ben
Don't wait up

44
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,196
-And thank you!
-Get out of here, have fun

45
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:56,366
Miss?!
Ah, my God!

46
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:15,844
Miranda?

47
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:23,892
Hey, Miranda, come on
We're going to be late

48
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:33,228
Miranda, come on, you ...

49
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,188
-What have we got?
-Woman no ID or any clothes, some kind of skin rash...

50
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:51,428
-Uncle Tom?
-I hope you are hungry!

51
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:54,137
Tempting, but
I have a date

52
00:06:56,336 --> 00:06:59,824
You are bright
To your future

53
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:12,244
I need you to tell me your name
What's your name?

54
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:21,543
-Miranda... Hollander.
-Hollander.

55
00:07:57,608 --> 00:07:59,692
These blood levels
can't be right

56
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,315
-These aren't human
-I shot them, that's how they came out

57
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,908
Yeah, right!
Nice try

58
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:19,731
Stop screwing around
and do the X-Ray

59
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:23,225
OK!
You're the boss

60
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,433
Just stay still and relax, girl!

61
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,356
I just need to shoot another X-Ray

62
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:47,019
Edward, what kind of joke is this?

63
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:10,648
Get out!!

64
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:59,197
-What's going on?
-Just get in the car, Miranda

65
00:12:43,256 --> 00:12:48,600
I don't understand. When are you
going to tell me what's going on?

66
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:55,247
-We are going to Mexico!
-To Mexico? Why?

67
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:59,406
It's beautiful down there

68
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:05,789
-Haven't you always wanted to see it?
-Is it the Police you're afraid of?

69
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,465
Yeah

70
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:15,435
Whatever happened at the hospital
I had nothing to do with it

71
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,602
Rigth?

72
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:29,513
Are you saying...
I killed those people?

73
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,305
Yes...
and no...

74
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:43,229
Yes and not?
What are you not telling me?

75
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,391
You are sick.
And I can't help you.

76
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:52,897
Sick?
With what?

77
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,198
I wish I knew

78
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:04,305
But, uncle Tom, if I'm
sick, shouldn't I

79
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,746
go see a doctor in the United States?

80
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:11,461
No
They can't help you either

81
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:13,782
Why not?

82
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:27,886
We are going to Mexico to find
someone named Forbes

83
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:32,124
He's one old colleague of mine
from university

84
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:37,530
I was his professor. But,
sometimes I wonder ...

85
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:40,293
if it wasn't him teaching me

86
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:46,085
He was brilliant
Crazy, but brilliant

87
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:51,101
I haven't seen him in years
because I didn't want to have anything more ...

88
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:56,613
... to do with him
But he is the only one that can...

89
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:01,022
that might be able to help you, Miranda

90
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:06,086
I tried!...

91
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:16,871
But... I...
I guess I failed

92
00:15:52,505 --> 00:15:54,018
Tell me

93
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,123
I didn't always worked
with fossils, Miranda...

94
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:08,317
I've always wanted to tell you the truth,
I just didn't know how

95
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,415
The truth about what?

96
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:19,127
Forbes and I made you,
in our lab

97
00:16:21,286 --> 00:16:23,671
As part of a project
we were working on

98
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,927
I tried to keep this from you.
I just wanted you to have

99
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:35,171
a normal life.
-No!

100
00:16:39,195 --> 00:16:45,755
There were these DNA
strands... from somewhere else

101
00:16:47,694 --> 00:16:55,950
Sent to us
I mean. To Earth

102
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:02,176
We mixed those DNA strands with human genes

103
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:05,959
Experimented with
a new kind of life

104
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:13,347
You were one of the results
But it was wrong

105
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,660
So I walked away from...

106
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:23,478
But I didn't want anything to happen to you

107
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,843
So, I took you with me.

108
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:32,347
And raised you as best I could
as a normal human being.

109
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:37,094
You're all that matter to me, Miranda

110
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:42,463
-You're lying
-Not this time, Miranda

111
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:49,839
What about your parents?
Do you really remember them?

112
00:17:52,355 --> 00:17:56,043
-My mother was your sister
-No

113
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:59,819
I am an only child
They never existed

114
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:02,751
All your childhood memories

115
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:05,574
are part of a great big history
I told you, when you were young

116
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:08,247
again and again
until that you believed in it

117
00:18:09,326 --> 00:18:11,135
You only think you remember

118
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:24,906
I lied until you stopped asking
me where you came from

119
00:18:27,718 --> 00:18:36,591
Until you believed we were just
two normal and happy human beings

120
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:54,070
I'm sorry
I'm really sorry

121
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:39,010
So, why would Forbes
live in Mexico?

122
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:46,578
I guess some people
come down here to disappear

123
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:51,985
-Why did you two have a falling out?
-Let's just say we didn't see eye to eye

124
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,275
I thought what we were
doing was immoral and he didn't.

125
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,351
He was abusing the project

126
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:04,877
Uncle Tom?

127
00:20:17,078 --> 00:20:19,654
-What is that?
-Human hormones

128
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,846
I've been administering them
to you while you slept

129
00:20:24,397 --> 00:20:27,974
Just two or three times a year,
to keep the alien side of

130
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:30,462
your biology from surfacing

131
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:35,174
But, ever since you got sick...

132
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:49,509
they don't seem to work as well
-So, what exactly is wrong with me?

133
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,222
I wish knew

134
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:59,338
It could be an infection,
a toxic reaction of some sort

135
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:02,575
Whatever it is, I don't know
enough about your biology

136
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:09,390
to cure it.
Forbes is the one who designed you, so...

137
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,995
he is the only one that might be able to help

138
00:21:21,243 --> 00:21:25,555
It's going down
-For now

139
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,512
You are a mixture of ADN
human and alien.

140
00:21:39,406 --> 00:21:41,552
A highly hybrid functional.

141
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,823
You can soak up a volume
of knowledge that

142
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:50,655
no human can
I didn't teach you anything, Miranda...

143
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:03,061
-Does this look familiar?
-Of course

144
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:05,986
It's the complete works
of Shakespeare

145
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,098
I've read this a hundred times

146
00:22:11,178 --> 00:22:13,850
You've never opened
that book in your life

147
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:17,972
That's not possible

148
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:25,019
OK! You know nothing
about cars, right?

149
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:32,494
-Right, so what?
-Take this

150
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:35,706
Close your eyes

151
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:48,682
You know that clicking noise you have...

152
00:22:49,226 --> 00:22:50,730
You've switched to a higher octane gas

153
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:53,133
That's why

154
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:58,020
That's why you get that (?) sound

155
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:37,578
If you sign here, sir

156
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:42,920
Your keys, señorita
Enjoy

157
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:45,759
I'm looking for an American
that lives down here

158
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:51,518
name of Forbes Mcguire
-I'm not familiar with this gentleman

159
00:23:51,553 --> 00:23:56,343
Perhaps I can make some inquires
-Thank you. I'd appreciate it

160
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:25,355
Hey, where are you going?

161
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:36,390
I'm going to find Forbes
Why don't you stay and rest

162
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,682
I filled the syringes
with hormones.

163
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:47,154
If the rash gets worse while
I'm gone, inject them

164
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,402
See you later!...

165
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:09,291
Perdon, señor. Conoces a este hombre
(Excuse me, sir. Do you know this man?)
-No

166
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:36,629
Hey, niño. Conoces a este hombre
(Hey, kid. Do you know this man?)

167
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:45,727
No? Ok, gracias

168
00:27:52,199 --> 00:27:54,550
Hold on there
Where is the fire?

169
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:58,280
-Excuse
-Hey, I know you

170
00:27:58,315 --> 00:28:03,969
San Antonio, Texas.
Same hotel.

171
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:08,903
How would you like to go for a drink?
-No, thank you

172
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,823
Ah, come on
Come on, I'm buying

173
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:18,750
Look, I heard back at the hotel,
asking that Calderón fella

174
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:24,213
about finding a certain somebody
Well, I'll tell you something...

175
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:27,925
Unless you give him a bribe,
he ain't going to do nothing

176
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,414
That's the way it is
with these Mexicans

177
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:33,815
They play dumb
until you play ball

178
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:38,997
Now, you seem like a right and nice fella
So I'll tell you what I'm going to do

179
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:43,933
I'm going to cut through all that bull
and I'm going to hook you rigth up

180
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:53,507
-What are you getting at?
-You want to find Forbes

181
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:55,875
Huh? I'm going to tell you

182
00:28:58,283 --> 00:29:03,994
Now, at midnight, you go down
to the square of the blessed maiden

183
00:29:04,547 --> 00:29:09,011
There will be a taxi cab there
You wait until he flashes his lights

184
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:17,287
Then you go and you
get in the back seat of the taxi

185
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:21,987
Any business that
you have with Forbes,

186
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:25,171
you put it in an envelope,
that you will give to the driver

187
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:27,195
I'm looking for
Forbes Mcguire.

188
00:29:58,737 --> 00:30:02,073
Hey, where are we?
Is this where he lives?

189
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:09,301
I am friend of Forbes
I just want to talk to him

190
00:30:10,653 --> 00:30:12,598
Hey, buddy, are you listening to me?

191
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:31,866
Hold on. I'm coming

192
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:38,337
Hold your god damned horses
I said I'm coming

193
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:52,954
Oh, you don't look so good
-God damned you

194
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,529
You set me up, you sob

195
00:33:55,064 --> 00:33:56,725
Now you just hold on there
-No!

196
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,405
Now, I don't care
who put you up to it

197
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,790
But, God help me
I'm not leaving here

198
00:33:59,825 --> 00:34:02,021
until you tell me where
to find Forbes

199
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:06,509
Well, I don't think you're though
enough to be telling me what

200
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,454
to do in my own hotel room.
You're trespassing

201
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:15,991
Put the gun down
-Oh, lookie here

202
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:20,088
-Is that your new bodyguard?
-Put it down, now

203
00:34:21,123 --> 00:34:23,783
Ohh. I am so scared...

204
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:50,878
That cowboy better
not be setting us up again

205
00:34:55,382 --> 00:35:01,799
What is this place?
It can't be here

206
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,939
Listen

207
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:17,704
Whoever is here
They're behind this door

208
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:20,511
Yeah... But how do we get in?

209
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:15,511
Yeah, that's it
Giddy up!

210
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,875
Go on, Go on

211
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,559
That's it, girl
Come on, sweetheart

212
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:39,755
-Mcguire!
-What the...?

213
00:36:41,947 --> 00:36:42,859
Shit!

214
00:36:48,848 --> 00:36:53,512
I can't believe it
As I live and breath. Tom Hollander

215
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,090
Why did you try and have me killed?

216
00:36:57,909 --> 00:37:00,740
What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about the nun...

217
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:03,948
You know, the one with the tentacles
And your friend, the cab driver

218
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:10,891
-Na, I do not know what you're talking about
-You haven't changed, have you?

219
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:15,296
Hi, sweetheart

220
00:37:17,096 --> 00:37:19,096
Forbes Mcguire

221
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,238
Have we met somewhere before?
And by the by, how did the two of you get in here?

222
00:37:27,592 --> 00:37:29,526
You left out a key pad for us

223
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:37,547
Oh, my God
We have met before

224
00:37:38,378 --> 00:37:41,875
You're G17, aint you?
-Her name's Miranda

225
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,975
Whatever!
She is gorgeous

226
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:52,750
Everyone, this is Azura

227
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:57,590
Azura is my, hmm, director
of community relations

228
00:37:58,689 --> 00:38:01,969
We've already met
This was your nun

229
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:07,346
Huh? For God's sake, Azura!

230
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:11,153
Listen Tom, I'm really sorry mate.
I had no idea you were here

231
00:38:12,261 --> 00:38:14,909
That's because no one
tells me anything anymore

232
00:38:15,485 --> 00:38:17,518
These are totally inferior models, you know

233
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:21,709
No complex thinking, love
Absolutely none

234
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:25,178
But this one...

235
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:28,528
Come one, sweetheart,
tell me a little bit about yourself

236
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:33,065
I hold advanced degrees in Biochemistry
and Comparative Literature Classics

237
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:35,730
Well, Well, Well

238
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:41,336
So, Holander, you sly old fox

239
00:38:41,337 --> 00:38:46,610
Come on, Frankestein builds some stumbling drunk
with a couple of bolts through his forehead

240
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:51,258
Not that it could count (?)
a pig or an orange

241
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:57,853
And you, you come up with this
The holly grail...

242
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:12,685
-What the...?
-Miranda! Miranda...

243
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:17,225
-What's happening to her?
-She's sick

244
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,549
That's the only reason we're here

245
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:28,349
Put her up there
-Give me an IV line of 50 ccs of hormones

246
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:31,606
Ah, no shit.
Look, I do know what I'm doing, ok?

247
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:34,573
Now, keep an eye on her blood pressure

248
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:39,589
We have to stabilize the huma hormone levels
Come on, sweetheart

249
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,865
You're playing with fire, did you know that?

250
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:07,193
Look (?)
Once in a while, I try something out

251
00:40:07,228 --> 00:40:10,233
For Christ's sake
If I can make someone's dream come true

252
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:14,346
by giving them back a dead relative
or whatever, why not?

253
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:17,624
Because it's not their dead relative

254
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:21,185
It might look like them, but they're half alien

255
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,258
Do your clients even know that?
- They don't need to. I'm telling you

256
00:40:25,293 --> 00:40:30,086
these things are safe! The alien side
almost never comes out. I've worked out
most of the kinks

257
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:33,120
So what about your cab driver?
-Go ape nuts (?)

258
00:40:33,155 --> 00:40:35,336
you know, random (?)

259
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:38,529
OK, I there's been one or two mistakes
Things I've never

260
00:40:38,564 --> 00:40:42,217
should have made
And admittedly one or two of those mistakes

261
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:45,397
might have escaped into town,
but they are unstable.

262
00:40:45,932 --> 00:40:47,913
They die off in a month or two

263
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:50,265
It's cool
Trust me

264
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:57,032
What's wrong with Miranda?
Any ideas?

265
00:40:58,661 --> 00:40:59,902
Yes.

266
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:07,492
So, what's it?
What does she have?

267
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:15,445
Old age
-Come again?

268
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:19,153
Mortality, mate
There is nothing actually wrong with her

269
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:22,621
She's just reached
the end of her life span

270
00:41:24,373 --> 00:41:27,780
Huh? Are you crazy?
Look at her!

271
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:32,525
Yeah, I know... It's hard to believe, isn't it?
She is young, she is beautiful

272
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:36,413
And soon she is going to die

273
00:41:42,493 --> 00:41:47,590
How long?
You know, until...?

274
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:54,205
Soon, you know.
Today, maybe tomorrow

275
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:08,334
I could try making you another one
It might not be as smart

276
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:13,264
Whatever you might think
Miranda is a human being.

277
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:17,402
Then tell her the truth
Tell her she's going to die

278
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:20,569
Isn't that what being a
human being is all about?

279
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,686
What about Azura? What are you going
to do when she dies?

280
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,696
-Don't you care about her?
-Hell, no!

281
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:33,320
Just pop out another one.
Blond, probably

282
00:42:33,355 --> 00:42:35,040
green eyes and a tan

283
00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:38,412
I mean, come on, mate. That's the beauty in all this

284
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:44,063
No
- Look, all right. Then, don't tell her

285
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:47,604
You know, after all, you lied to her in the first
place about what she really was

286
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:50,556
Was that because you respected
her as a human being?

287
00:42:50,591 --> 00:42:52,524
Or just a convenient way of

288
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:54,608
keeping things in control?

289
00:42:58,505 --> 00:43:02,768
Shit, mate
Don't listen to me

290
00:43:03,465 --> 00:43:08,241
What do I know?
I mean, look at me. Look at this place.

291
00:43:09,811 --> 00:43:11,869
I'm the one that should
have died a long time ago

292
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:16,741
I tell you: between me and the (?)

293
00:43:16,776 --> 00:43:18,421
I kind of have one of these buggers
polish me off someday

294
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:39,905
Miranda?

295
00:43:41,824 --> 00:43:48,551
I raised as my niece
But I love you as my daughter

296
00:43:49,857 --> 00:43:55,549
Unfortunately,
there is nothing he can do

297
00:43:57,485 --> 00:44:07,277
And I just want you to know
I'm truly sorry

298
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:26,196
There is something that I want see...

299
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:31,700
Anything you want...

300
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:43,196
I don't know if human or not,
or if I have soul or not.

301
00:44:44,236 --> 00:44:47,772
But, whatever I've done
I have to settle it

302
00:44:57,245 --> 00:44:58,166
Looks, Miranda,

303
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:01,640
Whatever you want to do, we'll do
Wherever you want to go, we'll go

304
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:05,200
I'd like to be back home

305
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:10,621
Of course, but...
-And go to the police there

306
00:45:12,574 --> 00:45:13,884
To the police?

307
00:45:16,436 --> 00:45:18,763
I killed people in the hospital!...

308
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,581
I need to take responsibility for that

309
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:25,900
Miranda...

310
00:45:26,692 --> 00:45:30,891
Even if I don't make it home...

311
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:33,396
I have to try

312
00:45:53,268 --> 00:45:56,565
Come with me!

313
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:11,021
OK, there is one way
to extend Miranda's life

314
00:46:11,997 --> 00:46:13,716
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

315
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:17,528
Because it requires ending someone else's

316
00:46:23,752 --> 00:46:25,560
No way

317
00:46:29,024 --> 00:46:31,832
I won't be a party to a murder
-We won't get caught

318
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:34,552
People disappear here all the time

319
00:46:34,587 --> 00:46:37,145
all the time. Nobody asks
too many questions

320
00:46:37,148 --> 00:46:39,692
You have to try to think in that
as a genetic transplant.

321
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:42,069
You know, a complete infusion
of living healty vibrant cells

322
00:46:42,104 --> 00:46:43,485
Miranda,

323
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,724
is the only way for you to go on

324
00:46:48,133 --> 00:46:52,036
-It is immoral!
-Immoral? Give me a break.

325
00:46:52,071 --> 00:46:54,349
This town is full of scumbags

326
00:46:54,384 --> 00:46:56,996
Thieves, liars, murderers, 
rapists... you name it

327
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:58,700
You take one of those guys off...

328
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:00,684
... the streets.
Heck, we'd be doing a public service

329
00:47:01,764 --> 00:47:06,845
That's not the point
I'm not a killer

330
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:32,904
There must be another way
Something else we can try

331
00:47:36,805 --> 00:47:39,108
You have to let me 
accept this

332
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:46,699
I've have a good life.
Mostly because of you

333
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:54,679
So, have you thought about what you'll do?
After...

334
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:02,672
Forbes is a lost soul
living in a pit of misery

335
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:09,368
Maybe you should help him
So something good can come out of this

336
00:48:10,772 --> 00:48:15,124
I've told you. I want nothing more
to do with this technology

337
00:48:16,004 --> 00:48:19,108
So you'll leave him here
and go back to ...

338
00:48:19,143 --> 00:48:23,164
work in a museum? 
Can you honestly, tell me...

339
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:25,814
... that you you feel satisfied working
with things that have ...

340
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:30,547
been dead thousands of years?

341
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:35,795
Uncle, don't you miss true scientific work?

342
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,743
You are my true one scientific work

343
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:23,644
Miranda?

344
00:49:33,197 --> 00:49:35,100
Hey, hey. Hey, right here, mate

345
00:49:38,404 --> 00:49:41,820
Get her on the table,
Clamp her down. And make it quick!

346
00:49:43,617 --> 00:49:45,752
We need to get a syringe inside her

347
00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:48,063
before she fully turns
-Turns?

348
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:50,216
Yeah. She's fighting for her life
And then is ...

349
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:52,657
...when her less attractive, but very very strong side...

350
00:49:52,692 --> 00:49:54,176
... comes out

351
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:05,152
Come on
OK

352
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:09,411
OK, that will stabilize her
for a little while

353
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:12,768
But we need to do a human graft soon

354
00:50:12,803 --> 00:50:15,639
Or we will definitely lose her.
Now go back and get me a donor...

355
00:50:15,674 --> 00:50:18,088
I need a female
And bring her back alive

356
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:23,140
-Me? You want me to...?
-Yeah

357
00:50:23,175 --> 00:50:25,523
It's time to get your hands dirty

358
00:50:27,812 --> 00:50:33,644
Do you want to save her or not?
Go!

359
00:53:18,617 --> 00:53:20,127
Are you looking for me?

360
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:30,697
-Maybe...
-Do you want to dance?

361
00:53:32,264 --> 00:53:34,716
Sure
-Let's go

362
00:54:17,144 --> 00:54:20,104
Listen, should we go somewhere else?
I know a place

363
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:24,376
We'll do it here

364
00:54:39,098 --> 00:54:40,899
Turn around
-What?! Hey hey hey

365
00:54:40,934 --> 00:54:42,379
Turn around!

366
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,107
You're kidding?!
-Perverted! Prick!

367
00:54:49,142 --> 00:54:50,732
I don't belive this
You're robbing me?

368
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:53,892
Now, where do you want it?
One in the leg, or two in the ass?

369
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,986
Stop wasting time
Let's take her and go

370
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:22,542
Come on, let's get you home
You had a little too much tonight

371
00:55:26,006 --> 00:55:30,230
Who are you?
Where am I?

372
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:37,655
Let me go
-Shut up!

373
00:55:39,014 --> 00:55:41,287
You're about to be harvested

374
00:56:07,502 --> 00:56:08,935
Please!

375
00:56:10,407 --> 00:56:15,407
Por favor, no. Por favor. Se lo suplico
(Please, no. Please, I beg of you)

376
00:56:13,266 --> 00:56:15,515
Let me go, please

377
00:56:17,021 --> 00:56:22,021
Why!? Por Que?!

378
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,382
Let me go

379
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:07,118
First off, we're going to 
impregnate alien DNA

380
00:57:08,966 --> 00:57:11,615
Time to go fishing
-Ah, my God!

381
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:14,294
No worries, mate
She won't feel a thing

382
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:15,742
That is monstrous!

383
00:57:15,777 --> 00:57:18,095
Fertilization achieved

384
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:25,062
Now the trick here is injecting the stem cells...

385
00:57:25,097 --> 00:57:31,742
... at just the right point in their evolution
In other words, now

386
00:57:42,094 --> 00:57:44,518
I've forgotten how fast this thing went

387
00:57:58,001 --> 00:57:59,434
Hey, hey. What's happening?

388
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:03,018
The cells are infusing all over her body

389
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,607
That can't be good

390
00:58:14,774 --> 00:58:17,398
Come one, you're killing her!
-vital signs critical

391
00:58:17,982 --> 00:58:21,838
Stop this. Stop this now!
-Hey, hey, it's done, dude

392
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:23,650
Oh, crap

393
00:59:28,847 --> 00:59:31,263
Miranda, easy, easy

394
00:59:32,352 --> 00:59:36,447
It's me.
Miranda, come on

395
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,990
It's me. It's ok

396
00:59:41,976 --> 00:59:44,606
You're all right now
Come on

397
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,175
Hi

398
01:00:11,255 --> 01:00:12,743
Where am I?

399
01:00:13,215 --> 01:00:16,447
In the presence of two bloody geniuses
That's where

400
01:00:18,255 --> 01:00:21,927
Guess what?
You're all better now

401
01:00:24,136 --> 01:00:26,967
But how did you...?
-Stem cells, baby

402
01:00:27,923 --> 01:00:31,619
Here, drink some water
The temperature is normal.

403
01:00:31,654 --> 01:00:33,155
The blood pressure is excellent

404
01:00:34,419 --> 01:00:39,788
All systems are go
-I don't know how to thank you

405
01:00:40,187 --> 01:00:43,851
Hey, look what I found for you

406
01:00:45,778 --> 01:00:50,685
Orpheus' Metamorphosis. I never thought I'd read latin again

407
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:53,658
Intellectual functions appear present

408
01:00:55,617 --> 01:01:00,185
The Metamorphosis is about people 
that change into other creatures

409
01:01:01,396 --> 01:01:04,205
Your idea of a joke?

410
01:01:16,598 --> 01:01:19,981
Yes, well
Then again, we haven't heard you conjugate

411
01:01:20,016 --> 01:01:23,909
any Greek verbs yet
-Try me

412
01:01:24,044 --> 01:01:28,112
I'll give you all the tenses:
Past, Present,

413
01:01:28,147 --> 01:01:32,192
Future, Subjunctive...
-We are done, mate

414
01:01:33,874 --> 01:01:37,450
OK, I'll stop
Just let me do one thing

415
01:01:38,185 --> 01:01:39,178
What's that?

416
01:01:41,861 --> 01:01:43,477
Fuck this girl

417
01:01:49,529 --> 01:01:52,721
Miranda, what are you talking about?

418
01:01:57,437 --> 01:02:03,046
Your Director of 
Community Relations

419
01:02:07,269 --> 01:02:08,693
Let me fuck her

420
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,333
Hey, Azura, Love. There's something
I need to talk to you about outside

421
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:24,718
Miranda, are you feeling ok?
-Never better!

422
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:31,846
So, where to?
We can't go home now

423
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:34,863
The police are probably looking for me

424
01:02:41,063 --> 01:02:45,007
I thought that you wanted to talk to them
Face up to them

425
01:02:47,235 --> 01:02:50,363
Why?
So I can rot in jail?

426
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:54,514
Wha't the point of you
saving my life if I can't enjoy it?

427
01:02:58,402 --> 01:03:02,275
Regardless, I think it might be
a good idea to go back to the hotel

428
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,474
You need some rest
-Rest?

429
01:03:06,442 --> 01:03:11,986
I'm not tired
I'm going to go live

430
01:03:12,327 --> 01:03:17,943
Experience things
So, what do you say...

431
01:03:20,351 --> 01:03:25,006
...we grab some of Forbe's bottles...

432
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:28,863
..., top shelf tequila,
and get naked?

433
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:33,367
Hey, hey!
What are you talking about?

434
01:03:34,843 --> 01:03:42,419
Hmmm I now the truth now.
You are not my real uncle

435
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:50,624
No! No, Miranda!
No!

436
01:03:53,466 --> 01:03:56,810
Fine
Fuck you, then!

437
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:22,654
What's up?

438
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:27,309
That is some perverted stunt of yours?

439
01:04:28,218 --> 01:04:31,754
What the hell have you done to her?
-I saved her life

440
01:04:31,789 --> 01:04:34,091
Just like you asked me to
You know, there might one or two glitches...

441
01:04:34,426 --> 01:04:38,110
Have you seen her blood cells?
It's chaos!

442
01:04:38,145 --> 01:04:41,662
She's not stabilizing
We've got to do something

443
01:04:42,197 --> 01:04:44,323
Another transfusion
More stem cells

444
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:45,298
That won't help!...

445
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:47,538
That woman is here to pickup the dog

446
01:04:50,698 --> 01:04:53,937
Look, hang on a second
For God's sake!

447
01:04:53,972 --> 01:04:55,712
Azura!

448
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:22,742
You got the money?
Lady!

449
01:05:22,777 --> 01:05:25,517
Yes, yes
Here is the money

450
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,624
Release form

451
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:40,868
It is beautiful!

452
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:43,756
Actually, it's a fucking alien facsímile.
You might want to remember that

453
01:05:53,644 --> 01:05:55,805
Hey, mate, I'm sorry.
I had a bit of business...

454
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,348
Miranda?

455
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:04,340
Miranda?

456
01:06:07,909 --> 01:06:10,500
She's gone. Do you hear?
She's gone.

457
01:06:13,172 --> 01:06:15,645
I've got to find her
She is sick

458
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,808
Not just sick,
she is dangerous

459
01:06:17,843 --> 01:06:18,953
I don't care

460
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:21,817
Listen, mate, if you're going
to go. At least take this

461
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,936
What the hell is that?
-Hydrochloric acid.

462
01:06:23,971 --> 01:06:26,288
It won't kill her,
but it might slow her down

463
01:06:26,823 --> 01:06:29,893
-This dosage, on the other hand...
-I'm not going to kill her

464
01:06:29,928 --> 01:06:32,676
I'm going to find her and bring her back here

465
01:06:32,711 --> 01:06:34,990
Refine the hormones
Temperate the mixture

466
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:37,212
and get her back to where she was
-Dune, don't underestimate this thing

467
01:06:37,747 --> 01:06:39,396
Get out of my way!

468
01:06:40,582 --> 01:06:43,694
This is your fault, Mcguire,
you always did sloppy work

469
01:06:43,729 --> 01:06:47,574
Listen, Tom, I'm telling you
She's got no human imperative anymore

470
01:06:47,709 --> 01:06:50,754
She's pure creature.
She'll more likely be pregnant before night fall

471
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:53,450
In two weeks,
this entire town will be overrun

472
01:06:53,485 --> 01:06:55,786
She's sterile! I took care of 
that a long time ago

473
01:06:55,821 --> 01:06:59,370
I wouldn't count on it. With her new stem cells
there is not telling what she might do

474
01:06:59,605 --> 01:07:02,666
We've got to kill her
Face it Tom

475
01:07:02,701 --> 01:07:05,507
She's not human
She's not your little girl anymore

476
01:07:06,444 --> 01:07:09,444
If you weren't so obsessed,
you'd see that

477
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:15,948
Look, mate, if you won't kill her,
we've got to bring her back here

478
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:18,270
Wait, Tom!
Lets me help you!

479
01:07:18,305 --> 01:07:19,670
Do what you want!

480
01:07:19,705 --> 01:07:21,934
I'm telling you!
You can't stop her alone!

481
01:07:21,969 --> 01:07:24,438
You're going to get yourself killed!
-Miranda!

482
01:07:27,665 --> 01:07:28,730
Miranda!

483
01:08:03,605 --> 01:08:07,094
Señorita, may I do something for you?

484
01:08:09,774 --> 01:08:11,574
I think so

485
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:24,653
I must ask you to 
cover yourself, señorita

486
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:32,992
It's ok

487
01:08:35,419 --> 01:08:41,075
I know that you like me
I've known from the beginning

488
01:09:32,249 --> 01:09:33,384
Miranda?

489
01:09:37,527 --> 01:09:38,567
Miranda?

490
01:10:11,437 --> 01:10:16,437
Señor

491
01:10:12,065 --> 01:10:14,159
You scared me

492
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:20,116
Where is Miranda?

493
01:11:31,995 --> 01:11:36,884
Everything was fine
until that two showed up

494
01:11:36,919 --> 01:11:39,892
It should have killed you in the alley

495
01:11:58,851 --> 01:12:02,587
Not so good
you humans

496
01:12:20,179 --> 01:12:21,866
You don't have to do this!

497
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:28,818
Genesis 20:
Behold, thou art but a dead man

498
01:13:34,394 --> 01:13:39,394
Que haces aqui, guera? Quien the dejo pasar?
(What are you doing here, blondie? who let you in?)

499
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:41,933
The dress, I want it
-Do you want my dress?

500
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:45,149
Take it off!
-You know what?

501
01:13:45,184 --> 01:13:48,085
I've got a better idea
Why don't you get out of here...

502
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,217
...right now, bitch?

503
01:13:56,569 --> 01:13:58,745
Oh, you mean, "my dress"?

504
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:18,440
Hey, hey, hey! Que paso aqui? (What happened here?)
-A monster. It killed my compadre!

505
01:15:18,284 --> 01:15:20,284
Oh, crap
Where did she go?

506
01:15:20,623 --> 01:15:22,920
The monster, where? Donde esta?

507
01:15:23,137 --> 01:15:25,642
Over there!
-All right!

508
01:15:39,614 --> 01:15:41,431
Bingo!

509
01:15:51,575 --> 01:15:53,185
There it goes

510
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:08,260
Miranda?
Miranda?

511
01:16:44,738 --> 01:16:47,938
The Inn keeper was one of mine,
and he was sterile

512
01:16:48,284 --> 01:16:49,972
Otherwise you'd be pregnant by now

513
01:16:51,828 --> 01:16:53,512
Turn around

514
01:17:11,524 --> 01:17:17,148
You have wanted to fuck me
since the moment we met

515
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,473
Miranda?

516
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:21,347
Where am I?

517
01:23:23,303 --> 01:23:25,496
It's ok
It's ok

518
01:23:33,087 --> 01:23:35,160
Reax, relax, Miranda

519
01:23:39,928 --> 01:23:41,160
Lie down

520
01:23:44,212 --> 01:23:48,619
Tom, I need your help
-Of course, anything

521
01:23:50,579 --> 01:23:52,084
You have to end this

522
01:24:05,247 --> 01:24:06,976
Hang in there
Hang in there

523
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:13,640
The human side of me
is dying

524
01:24:16,137 --> 01:24:18,184
I don't want what's left

525
01:24:22,358 --> 01:24:23,871
It's over

526
01:24:27,268 --> 01:24:29,043
You know what you've got to do

527
01:31:01,429 --> 01:31:05,771
Thanks, for giving me life

528
01:32:06,398 --> 01:32:16,829
You were right, Miranda
You were always right

529
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:16,800
