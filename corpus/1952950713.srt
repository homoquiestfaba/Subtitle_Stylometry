- Hey.

182
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,497
Where's Porter?

183
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,657
- He went on ahead
to get the cabin warmed up.
- Oh.

184
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,099
He must be sick or something
'cause usually Porter's a douche bag.

185
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:59,899
- Only to you.
- I know. What's that all about?

186
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,735
Um, I don't know. Maybe it's because
you keep making passes at me?

187
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,309
He's that insecure?

188
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,038
Is there something you want to tell me,
Kenia? I'm here for a sister.

189
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,673
- Uh, fuck off. Fuck off.
- [Laughs]

190
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,013
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey, man.

00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,776

Hey!

- I'm so excited.

00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,085
- Hey, guys. Sorry we're late.
- Hey.

195
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,594

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,639
Then you're gonna
wanna ride with me.

00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,906
- Okay.
- There you go.

203
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,778
Hey, Kyle? I heard on the radio
there's a huge storm blowing in.

204
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,546
You think maybe we wait?
Do this tomorrow?

205
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,746
It'll be okay, princess.
We'll be at the cabin in an hour.

206

- All right!
- Yeah.

208
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,158
- What about the cars?
Are we okay to park here?
- Oh, my gosh.

209
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,322
Jesus, Daniel. You got to worry
about everything? They'll be fine.

How long have you been having

373
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:40,468
Well, it all started
when I was 12.

374
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,809
I-I felt this presence
in my room at night.

375
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,405
Was this about the time
of your first period?

376
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,508
You're a fucking pervert.
You know that?

377
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:51,487
Violent dreams are a direct result
of menstruation in young women.

378
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,923
- Had you masturbated yet?
- Ew!

Looks like the good doctor was a boozer.
Anyone for a snort?

382
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,835
Please tell me
you're not gonna drink that.

383
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,564
It's a 30-year-old bottle of scotch.

384

- What was this place?

397
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,241
According to the records,
it was the Glenville Sanatorium.

398
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:52,407
- Isn't that where crazy people
are locked up?
- No, that's a sanitarium.

399
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,645
A sanatorium is a hospital that isolates
sick people from the rest of the population.

What was wrong with these people?

I just hope it wasn't contagious.

- Come on. We should
get back to the others.

that's got beds and shit.

Oh, gross. I don't want to sleep
on a filthy mattress.

417
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,510
We'll lay our sleeping bags
over the top.

418
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,051
It's better than sleeping on the hard floor.
Plus, we get a little privacy.

I'm really starting to get worried.

696
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,530
- He'll show up.
- I'm sure he just fell asleep somewhere.

697
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:26,263
He smoked pretty heavy last night.

698
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:28,931
He's probably stoned right now,
in a corner having a bad trip somewhere.

699
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,940
Yeah. Hey.

700
00:47:32,944 --> 00:47:34,741

[Kyle]
Shit.

742
00:49:56,855 --> 00:49:58,982
They've stripped
the spark plug wires.

743

- They sabotaged the fucking snowmobiles!

We don't even have fucking jackets.

747
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:13,395

a way to defend ourselves.

- The cannibal hillbillies
my brother told me about.

- I'm going for help.

I'm the strongest skier.
I've got the gear.

753
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:30,280

And now what?

761
00:51:09,394 --> 00:51:12,761
Please, Sara, please!
We can't go back in there.

762
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:14,331
- We have to.
- No.

763
00:51:14,432 --> 00:51:17,492
The doctor's office--
It has a sturdy door and a lock on it.

764
00:51:17,602 --> 00:51:19,570
All right, it's right
near the entrance.

765
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:22,765
- I can't do that.
- We either freeze to death or we fight.

766
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,406
That's the plan.

767
00:51:40,158 --> 00:51:41,625

Okay.

768
00:51:44,095 --> 00:51:45,892

the hell out of here!

Guys? Guys, look at this.

773
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:56,830
This is the guy that attacked Claire
on the balcony.

774
00:51:56,941 --> 00:52:00,604
It says they were violent,
mentally, physically deformed...

775
00:52:00,712 --> 00:52:02,976

- They're hunters.

778
00:52:07,652 --> 00:52:09,279
And now they're hunting us.
They'll eat anything.

779
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:11,446

into porterhouse by now.

00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:57,266
Yes. Yes.

787
00:52:57,368 --> 00:53:00,269
That cage downstairs
with all the knives and saws in it.

788
00:53:00,371 --> 00:53:02,532
- We should all go together.
- No, I don't think so.

789
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,232
Let's just stay here
until help comes.

790
00:53:04,342 --> 00:53:07,277
Look, how about you girls stay here.
Daniel and I will go.

791
00:53:07,378 --> 00:53:08,811
- You lock the door behind us.
- Whoa!

792
00:53:08,913 --> 00:53:10,778
- Thanks for volunteering me.
- We need to do this.

I'll be fine. You stay here with Kenia.

799
00:53:25,863 --> 00:53:27,763

800
00:53:27,865 --> 00:53:29,628
