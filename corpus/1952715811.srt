00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Mark McAvinue

2
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:06,000
*"Leaning on the everlasting arms"
playing softly*

3
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,659
People do not give it credence that a young girl could leave
home

4
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,565
and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father’s
blood,

5
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,057
but it did happen.

6
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:28,360
I was just fourteen years of age when a coward
by the name of Tom Chaney shot my father down,

7
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:31,191
and robbed him of his life, and his horse,

8
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:34,320
and two California gold pieces that he carried
in his trouser pant.

9
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:37,934
Chaney was a hired man.

10
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:42,789
And Papa had taken him up to fort Smith
to help lead back a string of mustang ponies he'd brought.

11
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:46,725
In town, Chaney had followed to drink.

12
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:49,652
And cards, and lost all his money.

13
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,743
He got it into his head he was being cheated.

14
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:55,621
And went back to the boarding house
for his Henry Rifle.

15
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,306
When Papa tried to intervene,

16
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,256
Chaney shot him.

17
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:03,307
Chaney fled.

18
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:09,324
He could have walked his horse.

19
00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:12,526
For not a soul in that city could
be bothered to give chase.

20
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,459
No doubt Chaney fancied himself, scott free.

21
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:20,638
But he was wrong.

22
00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:24,349
You must pay for everything in this world,
one way and another.

23
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:27,432
There is nothing free.

24
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:29,652
Except the grace of God.

25
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,280
Is that the man?

26
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:22,770
That is my father.

27
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:24,270
If you would like to kiss him,

28
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:26,954
It would be all right.

29
00:03:26,955 --> 00:03:28,421
He's gone home.

30
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:30,485
Praise the Lord.

31
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,776
Why is it so much?

32
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:34,570
The quality of the casket

33
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,206
and of the embalming.

34
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:39,466
The life like appearance requires time and art.

35
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:43,022
And the chemicals come dear.
The particulars are in your bill.

36
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,379
If you'd like to kiss him, it would be all right.

37
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,291
Thank you, the spirit has flown.

38
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,109
Your wire said fifty dollars.

39
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,845
You did not specify that he was to be shipped.

40
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:58,225
Well sixty dollars is every cent we have.
That leaves nothing for our board.

41
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:02,189
Yarnell, you can see to the body’s transport to
the train station and accompany it home.

42
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,577
I will have to sleep here tonight.

43
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,288
I still have to collect father’s things and
see to some other business.

44
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,298
Your mama didn't say nothing about you
settling no business here.

45
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:12,541
It is business Mama doesn’t know about. It’s all right,
Yarnell, I dismiss you.

46
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,454
I am not sure.

47
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:17,743
Tell mama not to sign anything until I return home and see
that Papa is buried in his Mason’s apron.

48
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:21,418
Your terms are agreeable, if I might
pass the night here.

49
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,860
Here, among these people?

50
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:29,139
- These people?
- I'm expecting three more souls.

51
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,852
Sullivan, Smith, and His-Tongue-In-The-Rain.

52
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,371
Ladies and gentlemen beware

53
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,969
and train up your children in
the way that they should go!

54
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:42,522
You see what has become of me,

55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,109
because of drink.

56
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:45,644
I killed a man.

57
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,030
In a triffiling quarrel over a pocketknife.

58
00:04:50,598 --> 00:04:53,778
If I had received good instruction as a child-

59
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,083
Could you point out the sheriff?
- Out on the Cimarron River

60
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,357
Him with the moustaches.

61
00:04:57,358 --> 00:05:02,024
I would be with my wife and children today.
I do not know what is to become of them.

62
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:11,577
But I hope and pray that you will not slight
them and compel them to go into low company.

63
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,578
Stop whimpering boy!

64
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:21,345
Well.

65
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,267
I killed the wrong man is the which-of-why I’m here.

66
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:30,003
Had I killed the man I meant to. I don't
believed I'd a been convicted.

67
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:33,220
I see men out there in that crowd,
that's worse than me.

68
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:37,598
Okay.

69
00:05:40,346 --> 00:05:43,326
Before I am hanged, I would like to say.

70
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:44,327
Although-

71
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,296
Naw, we ain't arrested him.

72
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,820
Ain’t caught up to him, he lit out
for the Territory.

73
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,046
I would think that he has throwed in with
Lucky Ned Pepper, whose gang robbed a

74
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:07,407
mail hack yesterday on the Poteau River.

75
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,209
Well, why are you not looking for him?

76
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,436
I have no authority in the Indian Nation.

77
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,566
Tom Chaney is the business of the U.S Marshal’s now.

78
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:15,953
When will they arrest him?

79
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:19,030
Not soon, I'm afraid, the Marshal’s are not well staffed.

80
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:24,036
And I'll tell you, frankly, Chaney is at the
end of a long list of fugitives and malefactors.

81
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:27,175
Could I hire a Marshal to pursue Tom Chaney?

82
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,384
You have a lot of experience with
bounty hunters, do you?

83
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:33,117
That is a silly question. I am here
to settle my father's affairs.

84
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:35,822
- All alone.
- I am the person for it.

85
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:38,821
Mama was never any good at sums.
And she could hardly spell 'cat'.

86
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,985
I intend to see Papa's killer hanged.

87
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:45,385
Well, nothing prevents you from offering a
reward and so informing the Marshal’s.

88
00:06:45,386 --> 00:06:47,507
It would have to be real
money, though, to be persuasive.

89
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,887
Chaney is across the river in the Choctaw Nation

90
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:52,252
I will see to the money.
Who's the best Marshal?

91
00:06:53,117 --> 00:06:54,328
I have to weigh that.

92
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:57,239
William Waters, is the best tracker.

93
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,517
He is half Comanche, and it is something
to see him cut the sun.

94
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,522
The meanest, is Rooster Cogburn.

95
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,808
He is a pitiless man, double tough and
fear don’t enter into his thinking.

96
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,673
Hmm, He loves to pull a cork.

97
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:13,976
The best is probably, L.T. Quinn.

98
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,083
He brings his prisoners in alive.

99
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:17,775
Now he may let one slip by

100
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:22,578
now and again, but he believes that even the
worst of men, is entitled to a fair shake.

101
00:07:23,332 --> 00:07:25,096
Where can I find this, Rooster?

102
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,526
The jakes is occupied.

103
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:31,638
I know it is occupied Mr. Cogburn.
As I said, I have business with you.

104
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,201
I have prior business.

105
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:37,768
You've been at it for quite some time,
Mr. Cogburn.

106
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:39,941
There is no clock on my business!

107
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,637
To hell with you! How did you stalk me here?!

108
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,565
The sheriff told me to look in the saloon.

109
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,127
In the saloon they referred me here. We must talk.

110
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,025
Women ain’t allowed in the saloon!

111
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:54,370
I was not there as a customer.
I am fourteen years old.

112
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,490
The jakes is occupied.

113
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:01,869
Will be for some time.

114
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,265
Good evening.

115
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:25,839
If you would like to sleep in a coffin,
it would be alright.

116
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:47,880
How much are you paying for cotton?

117
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:52,962
Nine and a half for low middling and ten for ordinary.

118
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:55,903
We got most of ours out early.

119
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:59,078
Sold it to Woodson Brothers in
Little Rock for eleven cents.

120
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,836
Then I suggest you take the balance of it to the Woodson
Brothers.

121
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:06,315
We took the balance to Woodson.

122
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:09,141
We got ten and a half.

123
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:12,817
Why did you come here to tell me this?

124
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:17,201
Oh, I thought we might shop around up here next year but I guess
we are doing all right in Little Rock.

125
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,614
I'm Mattie Ross.

126
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:22,866
Daughter of Frank Ross.

127
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:26,103
Aw, tragic thing.

128
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,671
May I say, your father impressed me.

129
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:34,224
With his manly qualities. He was a close trader but he acted the
gentleman.

130
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:37,907
Well I propose to sell those ponies back to you that my father
bought.

131
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,805
Well that I fear, is out of the question.

132
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:42,772
I will see that they are
shipped to you at my earliest convenience.

133
00:09:42,773 --> 00:09:44,784
We don't want the ponies now, we don't need them.

134
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:48,133
Well that hardly concerns me. Your
father brought the ponies, and paid for them.

135
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:50,828
And there is an end of it. I have the bill of sale.

136
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:54,400
And I want three hundred dollars for Papa’s saddle horse that
was stolen from your stable.

137
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,775
You'll have to take that up with the
man who stole the horse.

138
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:01,738
Tom Chaney stole the horse while it was in your care.

139
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:03,150
You are responsible.

140
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,093
Yeah, I admire your sand

141
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:09,599
but I believe you'll find I'm not liable for such claims.

142
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,916
You were the custodian.

143
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:14,405
If you were a bank and were robbed
you could not simply tell the depositors to go hang.

144
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:18,462
I do not entertain hypotheticals.
The world as it is vexing enough.

145
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:22,533
Secondly, your valuation of the horse is high

146
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,748
by about two hundred dollars.
How old are you?

147
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,842
If anything, my price is low.

148
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:29,033
Why, Judy is a fine racing mare.

149
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:32,356
I've seen her jumpan eight-rail fence with a heavy rider.
I am fourteen.

150
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,873
Oh, well it's all very interesting.

151
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,051
The ponies are yours, take them.

152
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,931
Your father horse was stolen by a murderous criminal.

153
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:45,647
I have provided reasonable protection for the creature
as per our implicit agreement.

154
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:50,056
My watchmanhad his teeth knocked out
and can take only soup.

155
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:51,524
Then I will take it to law.

156
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,015
You have no case!

157
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,938
Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle, Arkansas

158
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:56,769
may think otherwise—as might a jury,

159
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,732
petitioned by a widow and three small children.

160
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:06,231
I will pay two hundred dollars to your fathers estate

161
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,728
when I have in my hand a letter from your lawyer,

162
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:12,854
absolving me of all liability from the beginning
of the world to date.

163
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:13,934
I will take two hundred dollars for Judy,

164
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:15,234
plus one hundred for the ponies.

165
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:17,726
And twenty five dollars for the grey horse
that Tom Chaney left.

166
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,455
He was easily worth forty.

167
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:21,803
That is three hundred and twenty-five dollars total.

168
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:25,043
The ponies have no part in it.
I will not buy them.

169
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,126
Then the price for Judy is three hundred
and twenty-five dollars.

170
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:31,145
I would not pay three hundred and
twenty-five dollars for winged Pegasus.

171
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:34,545
As for the grey horse, it does not belong to you.

172
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,505
The grey horse was lent to Tom Chaney
by my father.

173
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:38,294
Chaney only had the use of him.

174
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,495
I will pay two hundred and twenty-five dollars.

175
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,383
And keep the grey horse.

176
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,870
And I want the ponies.

177
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,007
I cannot accept that.

178
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,050
There can be no settlement after I leave this office.
It will go to law.

179
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:51,586
All right, this is my last offer.

180
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,386
Two hundred and fifty dollars.

181
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:57,896
For that I get the release, previously discussed.

182
00:11:57,897 --> 00:12:00,014
And I keep your father's saddle.

183
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,176
The grey horse is not yours to sell.

184
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:04,257
The saddle is not for sale. I will keep it.

185
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,368
Lawyer Dagget will prove ownership of the gray horse.
He will come after you with a writ of replevin.

186
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:09,369
- A what?
- Writ of replev-

187
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:11,542
What? All right, now listen very carefully

188
00:12:11,544 --> 00:12:13,256
as I will not bargain further.

189
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:16,841
I'll will take the ponies back, and the
grey horse. Which is mine.

190
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:18,002
And settle...

191
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:22,971
For three hundred dollars. Now you must take that or leave it.

192
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:25,193
And I do not much care which it is.

193
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:31,923
Lawyer Daggett would not wish me to consider anything
under three hundred twenty-five dollars.

194
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:34,554
But I will settle for three hundred and twenty.

195
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:37,540
If I am given the twenty in advance.

196
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,569
Now here's what I have to say about that saddle.

197
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:49,318
Frank Ross’s daughter.

198
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,802
Oh, my poor child.

199
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,803
My poor child.

200
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:59,775
Are you gawna be stayin
with us or are you hurrying back home to your Mama?

201
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:01,594
I'll stay here, if you can have me.

202
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:04,433
I just spent last night at the undertakers.

203
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,169
In the company of three corpses.

204
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,229
I felt like Ezekiel.

205
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:10,644
In the valley of the dry bones.

206
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,257
Then, God bless you.

207
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:16,618
Now that you'll be rooming with,
Grandma Turner.

208
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,174
We’ve had to double up, what with all the people
in town come to see the hanging.

209
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:26,169
This was in your poor father's room.

210
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,274
Now that is everything.

211
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,655
There are no light fingers in this house.

212
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:42,755
If you need something for to
tote the gun around?

213
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:46,846
I can give you an empty flour sack for a nickel.

214
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:15,847
Unintelligible

215
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:22,848
about what he found up here, and we're close enough
to deputy Marshal Potter

216
00:14:22,849 --> 00:14:25,849
that we thought we'd better ride
over ourselves and investigate.

217
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,991
And what did you see when you arrived?

218
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:32,244
A woman, was out in the yard.

219
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,781
Dead with blow flies on her face.

220
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:40,793
The old man was inside with his breast blowed open
by a scatter-gun and his feet burned.

221
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,966
He was still alive but just was. Said it was them two
Wharton boys had done it,

222
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,927
- Rode up, drunk.
- Objection.

223
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,205
Hearsay.

224
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,641
Dying declaration, your Honor.

225
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,822
Objection's overruled.
Proceed Mr. Cogburn.

226
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:58,114
Them two Wharton boys—that’d be Odus and C.C.—
throwed down on him,

227
00:14:58,115 --> 00:15:01,450
and asked him where his money was,
but he wouldn't tell them,

228
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:04,134
they lit pine knots, held ’em to his feet.

229
00:15:05,081 --> 00:15:07,910
He told them the money was in the fruit jar.

230
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:11,252
Under a grey rock at the corner of a smoke house.

231
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:12,262
And then?

232
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:16,394
Well he died on us. Passed away in considerable pain.

233
00:15:16,395 --> 00:15:17,457
What'd you do then?

234
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,533
Well, Me and Marshal Potter went out to the smokehouse

235
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,777
and that rock had been moved and
the jar with the money in it was gone.

236
00:15:24,778 --> 00:15:27,612
- Objection, speculative.
- Sustained.

237
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:31,223
You found a flat grey rock, in the corner of the smoke house.

238
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:33,539
With a hollowed out space beneth it.

239
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,846
If the prosecutor is going to give evidence,
I suggest he be sworn.

240
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:41,105
Mr. Cogburn. What did you find, if anything,
in the corner of that smokehouse?

241
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:45,384
We found a flat gray rock with a hollowed-out space under
it. Nothin there.

242
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:47,479
- Well then what did you?
- No jar or nothing.

243
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
Yeah, what did you do then?

244
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:53,641
Well, rode up to the Whartons’ there, near where the North
Fork strikes the Canadian-

245
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:54,857
What did you find?

246
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:55,890
- Branch of the Canadian.

247
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,458
I had my glass and we spotted the two boys and their old
daddy, Aaron,

248
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,688
down on the creek bank with some hogs.

249
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,746
They'd killed a shoat.

250
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:08,819
And a fire built up under a wash pot
for scalding water.

251
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,760
What'dja do?

252
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:13,083
Announced we was U.S. Marshal’s, I hollered
out to Aaron.

253
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:15,507
I needed to talk to his two boys.

254
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:18,033
He raised an axe,

255
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:20,854
and commenced to cussing us and blackguarding this court.

256
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,046
What did he do then?

257
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,222
I backed away from the axe.

258
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:26,960
Tried to talked some sense into him.

259
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:33,914
While this was going on C.C. he edges over
to the wash pot there, behind the steam.

260
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,921
And picks up a shot gun.

261
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:39,162
Potter seen him, but it was to late.

262
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:43,104
C.C. Wharton pulled out on Potter with one barrel.

263
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:45,439
Turned to do the same for me and I shot him.

264
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,981
And the old man raised the axe.

265
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,171
And I shot him.

266
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,431
Otis lit out, and I shot him.

267
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:00,898
C.C. Wharton and Aaron Wharton were
dead when they hit the ground.

268
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,499
Odus was just winged.

269
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,772
Did you find the jar with a
hundred and twenty dollars in it?

270
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,865
- Leading.
- Sustained.

271
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,848
What happened then?

272
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:11,609
Found a jar with a hundred and twenty dollars in it.

273
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:14,719
What became of Otis Wharton?

274
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,200
There he sits.

275
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:20,201
You may ask, Mr. Goudy.

276
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:21,915
Thank you, Mr. Barlow.

277
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,271
Mr. Cogburn.

278
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:40,719
In your four years as a U.S. Marshal.

279
00:17:40,869 --> 00:17:42,593
How many men have you shot?

280
00:17:44,092 --> 00:17:45,652
I never shot nobody I didn’t have to.

281
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:47,579
Well that was not the question.

282
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,512
How many?

283
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:52,100
Shot or killed?

284
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:56,366
Let us restrict it to “killed” so that we may have a
manageable figure.

285
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,847
About twelve.

286
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,410
Fifteen. Stopping men in flight, defending
myself, et cetera.

287
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:04,173
Around twelve he says.

288
00:18:04,174 --> 00:18:05,882
Or fifteen.

289
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:09,602
So many, you cannot keep a precise count.

290
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:13,378
I have examined the records, and can
supply the accurate figure.

291
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,550
Uhh...

292
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:19,365
I believe them two Wharton boys
makes it twenty three.

293
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:22,478
And how many members of this one family,

294
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,933
the Wharton family, have you killed?

295
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:29,694
- Immediate, or-
- Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother,?

296
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:31,598
And Clete Wharton, half-brother?

297
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,715
Oh, Clete was selling ardent spirits to the Cherokee. He come at
me with a king bolt.

298
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,169
A King bolt?

299
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,022
You are armed, and he advanced upon you.

300
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,864
With nothing more than a King bolt?

301
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:47,425
From a wagon tongue?

302
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:51,411
I’ve seen men badly tore up with nothing bigger than a
king bolt. I defended myself.

303
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,165
Returning to the other encounter.

304
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,674
With Aaron Wharton, and his two remaining sons.

305
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,154
You sprang from cover.

306
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:00,678
With revolver in hand.

307
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,578
- That'd be it.
- Loaded and cocked.

308
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,297
Well if it ain't loaded
and cocked, it don't shoot.

309
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:10,737
And like his son, Aaron Wharton advanced
against an armed man.

310
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:12,866
Well he was armed, he had an axed raised.

311
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:15,844
I believe you testified you backed away
from Aaron Wharton.

312
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:18,067
- That's right.
- Which direction were you going?

313
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:21,245
I always go backwards,
when I'm backing up.

314
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
Very amusing.

315
00:19:26,828 --> 00:19:29,967
Now, he advanced upon you much in the manner
of Clete Wharton

316
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:35,049
menacing you with that little ol' King bolt or rolledup
newspaper or whatever it was.

317
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,799
Yes sir. He commenced to cussing

318
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,521
- and laying about with threats.
- And you were backing away.

319
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:44,520
How many steps before the shooting started?

320
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:49,173
Uh, seven, eight steps.

321
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:51,180
Good, and Wharton keeping pace.

322
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:53,578
Advancing away from his campfire.

323
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:56,724
Seven, eight, steps.

324
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,373
What would that be?

325
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,049
Fifteen, twenty feet?

326
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:02,105
I suppose.

327
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:05,309
Will you explain to this jury, Mr. Cogburn.

328
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,449
Why Mr. Wharton was found immediately by his
wash pot, one arm in the fire.

329
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,595
- His sleeve and hand smoldering.
- Well-

330
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,164
Did you move the body after you shot him?

331
00:20:14,165 --> 00:20:15,479
Why would I do that?

332
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,581
You did not drag the body over to the fire?
Fling his arm in?

333
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:20,576
- No, sir.
- Two witnesses.

334
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:23,572
Who arrived on the scene will testify
to the location of the body.

335
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:26,243
You do not remember moving the body.

336
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:32,848
So it was, a cold blooded bushwhack,
while poor Mr. Wharton was tending his campfire.

337
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:33,962
Objection.

338
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:37,250
I, if that was where the body was I might have moved him.

339
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:38,949
I do not remember.

340
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,900
Why, would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn?

341
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:45,923
Them hogs rooting around they might have moved him.

342
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:48,792
I'd do not remember.

343
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:54,571
Pencil-neck son of a bitch.

344
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:56,231
- Mr. Cogburn.
- What do you want?

345
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:57,363
I'd like to talk to you a minute.

346
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,708
What is it?

347
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:03,064
They tell me you're a man with, True Grit.

348
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:07,121
What do you want, girl?

349
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:08,722
Speak up, It is suppertime.

350
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:09,996
Let me do that.

351
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:12,323
Your makings are too dry.

352
00:21:12,324 --> 00:21:16,360
I am looking for the man who shot and killed my father,
Frank Ross, in front of the Monarch boarding house.

353
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:18,612
The man's name is Tom Chaney.

354
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:21,700
They say he's over in Indian Territory,
and I need somebody to go after him.

355
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,616
What's your name, girl.

356
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,158
My name is Mattie Ross.

357
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:28,259
We're located in Yell County.

358
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,473
My mother is at home looking after my
sister Victoria and my brother little Frank.

359
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:33,624
You best go home to them.

360
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:35,621
They'll need help with the charges.

361
00:21:35,622 --> 00:21:37,078
There is a fugitive warrant out for Chaney.

362
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,502
The government will pay you two dollars for bringing
him in plus ten cents a mile for each of you.

363
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:43,397
On top of that, I will pay you
a fifty dollar reward.

364
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:46,679
What are you?

365
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:49,686
What you got there in your poke?

366
00:21:51,553 --> 00:21:54,536
By God! A Colt’s dragoon!

367
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:58,597
You’re no bigger than a corn nubbin,
what’re you doing with a pistol like that?

368
00:21:58,598 --> 00:22:00,557
Well I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it.

369
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:02,927
- Kill Tom Chaney?
- Well if the law fails to do so.

370
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:04,860
Well that piece will do the job for you.

371
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:08,327
If you can find a high stump to rest it on
and a wall to put behind you.

372
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,605
Nobody here knew my father and I'm,

373
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:12,374
afraid nothing's is going to be done
about Chaney except I do it.

374
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:16,005
My brother is a child, and my mother is
indecisive and hobbled by grief.

375
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,789
I don't believe you fifty dollars.

376
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,469
I have a contract with Colonel Stonehill which
he will make payment on tomorrow or the next day

377
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,989
once a lawyer countersigns.

378
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:33,285
I don’t believe in fairy tales or sermons or stories about money,
baby sister. But thank you for the cigarette.

379
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:19,143
Isn't your Mama expecting you home, dear?

380
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:21,227
My business is not yet finished.

381
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:24,616
Mrs. Floyd, have any rooms opened up?

382
00:23:24,617 --> 00:23:28,654
Grandma Turner... the bed is quite narrow.

383
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,570
The second-floor back did open up

384
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,865
But uh, that gentleman on the porch,

385
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:35,270
has just taken it.

386
00:23:35,271 --> 00:23:38,052
Oh but don't worry yourself, dear.

387
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:40,662
You're not disturbing Grandma Turner.

388
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,850
My name is LeBoeuf.

389
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:29,259
I just come from Yell County.

390
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:33,266
We have no rodeo clowns in Yell County.

391
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:40,745
A saucy line will not get you far with me.

392
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,982
I saw your mother yesterday morning.

393
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,886
She said for you to come right on home.

394
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:46,794
What was your business there?

395
00:24:58,786 --> 00:25:00,418
This is a man I think you know.

396
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:04,768
You called him Tom Chaney.

397
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:09,305
I believe. All the months I've been tracking
him he has used the name, Theron Chelmsford.

398
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:10,696
John Todd Andersen,

399
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:12,021
and others.

400
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:15,361
He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana, and Pine Bluff,
Arkansas

401
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:17,345
Before turning up at your fathers place.

402
00:25:17,346 --> 00:25:20,993
Then why did you not catch him at,
Pine Bluff, Arkansas or Monroe, Louisiana?

403
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,921
He is a crafty one.

404
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:26,177
I thought him slow-witted myself.

405
00:25:27,364 --> 00:25:28,824
That was his act.

406
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,344
It was a good one.

407
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:31,956
Are you some kind of law?

408
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,072
That's right

409
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,279
I'm a Texas Ranger.

410
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:42,299
That may make you a big noise in that state

411
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,053
in Arkansas you
should mind that your Texas trappings and title

412
00:25:46,052 --> 00:25:47,218
do not make you an object of fun.

413
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,703
Why have you been ineffectually pursuing Chaney?

414
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:55,934
He shot and killed a state senator named Bibbs in
Waco, Texas.

415
00:25:55,935 --> 00:25:57,879
Bibbs family have put out a reward.

416
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,098
How came Chaney to shoot a state senator?

417
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,403
My understanding is there was an argument about a dog.

418
00:26:02,404 --> 00:26:04,497
You know anything about the
whereabouts of Chaney?

419
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:08,056
He is in the Territory, and I hold out little hope for you
earning your bounty.

420
00:26:08,056 --> 00:26:10,262
- Why is that?
- My man will beat you to it.

421
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:13,061
I have hired a deputy marshal, the toughest one they have

422
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:17,030
and he is familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper
gang that they say Chaney has tied up with.

423
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:20,138
Well, I will throw in with you
and your Marshal.

424
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,563
No, Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.

425
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:24,154
It'll be to our mutual advantage.

426
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:27,095
Your Marshal, I presume, knows the Territory.

427
00:26:27,097 --> 00:26:30,607
I know Chaney. It is at least a two-man
job taking him alive.

428
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:34,029
When Chaney is taken he is coming back to Fort Smith to
hang.

429
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,206
I am not having him go to Texas to hang for shooting
some senator.

430
00:26:37,207 --> 00:26:39,772
It is not important where he hangs, it is?

431
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:40,773
It is to me.

432
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:42,093
Is it to you?

433
00:26:42,094 --> 00:26:43,511
It means a great deal of money to me.

434
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:46,105
It’s been many months’ work.

435
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,901
I’m sorry that you are paid piecework not on wages

436
00:26:48,902 --> 00:26:52,366
and that you have been eluded the winter long by a halfwit.

437
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:57,644
You give out very little sugar with your pronouncements.

438
00:26:57,883 --> 00:27:01,256
While I sat there watching you I gave some thought to
stealing a kiss

439
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:03,671
though you are very young and sick and

440
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,149
unattractive to boot, but

441
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,075
now I have a mind to give you
five or six good licks with my belt.

442
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:12,291
One would be as unpleasant as the other.

443
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:16,166
If you wet your comb, it might tame that cowlick.

444
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:20,820
Mattie, I wish you would leave these matters

445
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,625
entirely to me or at the very least

446
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:26,003
give me the courtesy of consulting me before
entering such agreements.

447
00:27:26,506 --> 00:27:30,200
I am not scolding you, but I am saying your
head strong ways,

448
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:32,549
will lead you into a tight corner one day.

449
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:34,828
I trust the enclosed document

450
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:37,880
will let you conclude your business and
return to Yell County.

451
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:41,080
Yours, J. Noble Dagget.

452
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:43,517
I was as bad yesterday as you look today.

453
00:27:43,518 --> 00:27:46,165
I was forced to share a bed with Grandma Turner.

454
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:49,725
I'm not acquainted with Grandma Turner.

455
00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:54,591
If she is a resident of this city it does not
surprise me that she carries disease.

456
00:27:56,929 --> 00:27:59,685
This malarial place has ruined my health.

457
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:01,533
As it has my finances.

458
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:03,788
I owe you money.

459
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,167
You have not traded poorly.

460
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:06,812
Oh, certainly not.

461
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:09,564
I'm paying you for a horse

462
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:10,926
I do not possess.

463
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,282
And have bought back a string of useless ponies

464
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:16,312
Which I cannot sell again.

465
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:18,541
You're forgetting the Grey horse.

466
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:21,203
- Crowbait.
- You are looking at the thing in the wrong light.

467
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:24,710
I am looking at it in the light of God’s eternal truth.

468
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,925
Your illness is putting you “down in the dumps.”

469
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:29,832
You will soon find another buyer for the ponies.

470
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,100
Well I have a tentative offer
of ten dollars per head.

471
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:36,436
From the Pfitzer Soap Works of Little Rock.

472
00:28:36,437 --> 00:28:39,079
It would be a shame to destroy such spirited horseflesh.

473
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:42,941
So it would. I'm confident the deal
will fall through.

474
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:48,566
Look here, I need a pony and I will
pay ten dollars for one of them.

475
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,024
No. That was lot price. No no.

476
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:52,072
Wait a minute.

477
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:54,622
Are we trading again?

478
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:58,419
This one is beautiful.

479
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,581
He don't know he got a rider.

480
00:29:18,582 --> 00:29:20,838
You're to light.

481
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:26,448
He think he got a horsefly on him.

482
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,015
He's very spirited.

483
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,815
I'll call him 'Little Blackie'.

484
00:29:29,816 --> 00:29:31,402
Das a good name.

485
00:29:33,843 --> 00:29:35,273
What does he like for a treat?

486
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:38,452
Well ma'am, he's a horse.

487
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,152
So he likes apples.

488
00:29:42,048 --> 00:29:43,601
Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.

489
00:29:43,605 --> 00:29:47,294
No ma’am... I ain’t s’posed to utter your name.

490
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:51,520
See. Sleep.

491
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:54,765
That is fine, I will wake him.

492
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:57,520
Marshal Cogburn.

493
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:00,385
It is I, Mattie Ross, your employer.

494
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:03,524
How long til you are ready to go?

495
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,818
- Go where?
- Into the Indian Territory. In pursuit of Tom Chaney.

496
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,221
Oh, You're the bereaved girl with stories of El
Dorado.

497
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:16,144
Huh, how much money you got there?

498
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:19,330
I said fifty dollars to retrieve Chaney. You did not believe
me?

499
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:21,870
Well, I did not know.

500
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,258
You are a hard one to figure.

501
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,049
How long for you to make ready to depart?

502
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:28,690
Well uh, hold on sis.

503
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:33,311
I remember your offer but do not
remember agreeing to it.

504
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,775
If I'm to go up against, Ned Pepper.

505
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:41,245
Then I'll need a hundred dollars.
That much I can tell you. A hundred dollars.

506
00:30:44,121 --> 00:30:46,369
To retrieve your man, a hundred dollars.

507
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,306
I will take that fifty dollars in advance.
There will be expenses.

508
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:55,097
You are trying to take advantage of me.

509
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:57,128
I am giving you the children's rate.

510
00:30:57,129 --> 00:31:02,694
I am not a sharper, I am an old man sleeping in a rope bed in
a room behind a Chinese grocery.

511
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:05,992
- I have nothing
- You want to be kept in whiskey.

512
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:08,228
I don’t have to buy that,

513
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:09,543
I confiscate it.

514
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:11,493
I am an officer of the court.

515
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,755
Ah, thank you.

516
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:15,231
Hundred dollars, that’s the rate.

517
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,028
I shall not niggle.

518
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:18,894
Can we depart this afternoon?

519
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:20,836
We?

520
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:24,177
You're not going, that is no part of it.

521
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:29,129
You have misjudge me if you think I am silly enough to give you
fifty dollars and simply watch you ride off.

522
00:31:29,592 --> 00:31:31,237
I am a bonded U.S. Marshal.

523
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:32,429
That weighs but little with me.

524
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,639
I will see the thing done.

525
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,075
Damn ducks. I can't go after Ned Pepper

526
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:40,252
and a band of hard men and look after a baby at
the same time.

527
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:41,413
I am not a baby.

528
00:31:41,414 --> 00:31:45,747
I will not be stopping at boarding houses where there is
warm beds and hot grub on the table.

529
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,092
I'll be traveling fast and eating light.

530
00:31:48,093 --> 00:31:50,598
What little sleeping is done will
take place on the ground.

531
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,368
Well I have slept out a night before.

532
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:56,544
Papa took me and Little Frank coon
hunting last summer on the Petit Jean.

533
00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:59,134
We were in the woods all night.

534
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:01,611
We sat around a big fire and Yarnell told ghost stories.

535
00:32:01,612 --> 00:32:03,089
We had a good time.

536
00:32:04,488 --> 00:32:05,816
Coon hunting!?

537
00:32:05,817 --> 00:32:08,307
This ain't no coon hunt!

538
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:10,194
It is the same idea as a coon hunt.

539
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:11,641
It don’t come within forty miles of being a coon hunt!

540
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:13,406
You are just trying to make your work sound harder than it is.

541
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,831
Here is the money.

542
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:16,387
Now I aim to get Tom Chaney,

543
00:32:16,388 --> 00:32:18,888
and if you are not game, I will find
somebody who is game.

544
00:32:18,889 --> 00:32:21,340
All I have heard out of you so far is talk.

545
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:24,433
I know you can drink whiskey and snore and spit and
wallow in filth and bemoan your station.

546
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:26,028
The rest has been braggadocio.

547
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,763
They told me you had grit and that is why I
came to you.

548
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:32,532
I am not paying for talk. I can get all the talk I
need and more at the Monarch Boarding House.

549
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:38,949
Leave your money.

550
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,304
Meet me here tomorrow morning at seven
o’clock and we will begin our coon hunt.

551
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:53,369
Dearest mother,

552
00:32:55,047 --> 00:32:57,179
I'm about to embark on a great adventure.

553
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:00,967
I have learned that Tom Chaney has
fled into the wild.

554
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:03,803
And I shall assist the authorities in pursuit.

555
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:06,430
You know that Papa would want me
to be firm in the right.

556
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,820
As he always was.

557
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:11,150
So do not fear on my account.

558
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:14,000
Tho I walk through the valley, of the shadow of death.

559
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:15,604
I shall fear no evil.

560
00:33:16,426 --> 00:33:18,724
The author of all things watches over me, and

561
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:20,223
I have a fine horse.

562
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:23,278
Kiss Little Frankie for me and pinch Violet’s cheek.

563
00:33:24,018 --> 00:33:26,037
My Papa's death will soon be avenged.

564
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,964
I am off for the Choctaw Nation.

565
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:39,689
Where is Marshal Cogburn?

566
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,802
Went away.

567
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:42,579
Left this.

568
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,981
Here inside is a train ticket for your return home.

569
00:33:49,982 --> 00:33:50,934
Use it.

570
00:33:50,935 --> 00:33:54,786
By the time you read this, I will be across
the river in the Indian Nation.

571
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:56,688
Pursuit will be futile.

572
00:33:56,998 --> 00:33:59,272
I will return with your man, Chaney.

573
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:01,136
Leave me to my work.

574
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:02,774
Rueben Cogburn.

575
00:34:10,774 --> 00:34:12,393
Is that Marshal Cogburn?

576
00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:13,774
That is the man.

577
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:14,788
Who's he with?

578
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,661
I do not know.

579
00:34:16,665 --> 00:34:17,881
Well take me across.

580
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:20,541
So, you're the runaway.

581
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:23,717
Marshal told me you’d show up.
I’m to present you to the sheriff.

582
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,868
That is a story, let go of my horse.
I have business across the river.

583
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:33,272
If you don’t turn around and take me across
you may find yourself in court where you don’t want to be.

584
00:34:33,974 --> 00:34:35,284
I have a good lawyer.

585
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:44,718
HEY!

586
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:47,817
Go, Little Blackie.

587
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:48,823
Come on.

588
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,091
That is quite a horse.

589
00:36:03,935 --> 00:36:05,857
I will give you ten dollars for him.

590
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:07,317
From the money you stole from me?

591
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:09,767
That was not stolen, I'm out for your man.

592
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,281
I was to accompany you.

593
00:36:11,591 --> 00:36:14,062
If I do not, there is no agreement
and my money was stolen.

594
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:16,349
Marshal, put this child back on the ferry.

595
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,721
It's a long road and time's a wasting.

596
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:21,733
If I go back, it is to the U.S. marshals office to report
the theft of my money.

597
00:36:21,735 --> 00:36:24,583
And futile, Marshal Cogburn—
“Pursuit would be futile”?

598
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:27,017
Is not spelt F-U-D-E-L.

599
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,510
It's time for your spanking.

600
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:44,031
Now you do as the grown-ups say!

601
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,189
Or I will get myself a
birch switch and stripe your leg!

602
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,590
Are you going to let him do this, Marshal.

603
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,836
No, I don’t believe I will.
Put your switch away, LeBoeuf.

604
00:37:01,837 --> 00:37:03,849
I aim to finish what I started.

605
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:06,066
That will be the biggest mistake you ever made,

606
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:07,848
you Texas brush-popper.

607
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:23,671
Hoorawed by a little girl.

608
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,991
I am not accustomed to so large a fire.

609
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:45,459
In Texas, we'll make do with a fire
of little more than twigs

610
00:37:47,169 --> 00:37:48,352
or buffalo chips.

611
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,522
Heat the nights rations of beans.

612
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:52,903
And it is Ranger,

613
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:56,066
policy never to make your camp in
the same place as your cook fire.

614
00:37:56,831 --> 00:38:00,014
Very imprudent to make your presence
known in unsettled country.

615
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:09,780
How do you know that Bagby will have intelligence?

616
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:11,840
He has a store.

617
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,257
That makes him an authority on movements
in the Territory?

618
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,504
We have entered a wild place.

619
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:18,663
Anyone coming in

620
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,734
wanting any kind of supply,

621
00:38:21,136 --> 00:38:23,256
cannot pick and choose his portal.

622
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:26,926
That is a piece of foolishness.

623
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:29,276
All the snakes are asleep this time of year.

624
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:30,899
They've been known to wake up.

625
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,087
Well let me have a rope, too.

626
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:34,014
A snake would not bother you.

627
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,451
You are too little and boney.

628
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:40,230
You should fetch water for the morning,
put it by the fire.

629
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:42,593
- The creek’ll ice over tonight.
- I'm not going down there again.

630
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,092
You want anymore water,
you can go fetch it yourself.

631
00:38:45,093 --> 00:38:48,151
You are lucky to be traveling in a place where a spring is so
handy.

632
00:38:48,955 --> 00:38:52,321
In my country you could ride for days and
see no ground water.

633
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:55,395
I have lapped filthy water from a hoofprint

634
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,067
And was glad to have it.

635
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,485
If I ever meet one of you Texas waddies

636
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:03,224
who says he never drank water out of a horse track

637
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:06,098
I think I will shake his hand
and give him a Daniel Webster cigar.

638
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:07,134
You do not believe it?

639
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:10,588
Oh, I believed it the first twenty-five times I heard it.

640
00:39:10,843 --> 00:39:13,676
Maybe. Maybe it is true.

641
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,646
Maybe lapping water off the ground is
Ranger policy.

642
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,052
You're getting ready to show your ignorance
now, Cogburn.

643
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,650
I don't mind a little personal chaffing.

644
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:26,497
But I won't hear anything against the
Ranger troop from a man like you.

645
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,959
How long you boys been mounted
on sheep down there?

646
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,888
My white Appaloosa will still be galloping,

647
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,606
when that big American stud of yours
is winded and collapsed.

648
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:39,382
Now make another joke about it.

649
00:39:39,383 --> 00:39:42,035
You're only trying to put on a show for this girl, Mattie.

650
00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:44,368
With what you must think is a keen tongue.

651
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,736
This is like women talking.

652
00:39:46,737 --> 00:39:47,898
Yes, that is the way!

653
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,445
Make me out foolish in this girls eyes.

654
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:53,387
I think she has got you pretty well figured.

655
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:03,571
Would you two like to hear the story of “The Midnight
Caller”?

656
00:40:05,562 --> 00:40:07,175
One of you is gonna have to be "The Caller."

657
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:08,666
I will tell you what to say.

658
00:40:09,168 --> 00:40:11,110
I will do all the other parts myself.

659
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:37,409
- Good morning, Marshal.
- Good morning.

660
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:39,246
Where is Mr. LeBoeuf?

661
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:42,145
Down by the creek performing his necessaries.

662
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:46,136
Marshal Cogburn, I welcome
the chance for a private parley.

663
00:40:46,823 --> 00:40:49,877
I gather that you and Mr. LeBoeuf have come to some,

664
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,085
some sort of agreement.

665
00:40:51,086 --> 00:40:53,982
And as your employer I believe
I have the right to know the particulars.

666
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,185
The particulars,

667
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:58,323
is that we bring Chaney down to the magistrate

668
00:40:58,324 --> 00:41:03,146
in San Saba Texas where they have a considerable reward on
offer. Which we split.

669
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:06,253
I did not want him brought to Texas,

670
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:09,117
to have a Texas punishment administered
for a Texas crime.

671
00:41:09,486 --> 00:41:11,031
That was not our agreement.

672
00:41:11,275 --> 00:41:14,091
What you want is to have him caught
and punished.

673
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:16,919
I want him to know he's being punished
for killing my father.

674
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,128
Well, you can let him know that.
You can tell him to his face.

675
00:41:20,129 --> 00:41:21,925
You can spit on him.

676
00:41:21,926 --> 00:41:24,766
Make him eat sand out of the road.
I will hold him down.

677
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:26,620
If you want,

678
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,301
I will flay the flesh off the soles of his feet.

679
00:41:29,302 --> 00:41:31,888
Find you an Indian pepper to rub into the
wound.

680
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,831
Isn't that a hundred dollar value?

681
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:35,173
No, it is not.

682
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,586
When I have brought and paid for
something, I will have my way.

683
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,105
Why do you think I'm paying you,
if not to have my way.

684
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:42,589
It is time for you to learn

685
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,152
You cannot have your way

686
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:45,811
in every little particular.

687
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:48,681
If you find I fail to satisfy your terms

688
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:51,847
I'll return your money at the end
of this expedition.

689
00:41:51,848 --> 00:41:55,085
Little Blackie and I are ridding back
to the U.S. Marshal's office, this is fraud.

690
00:41:55,086 --> 00:41:56,093
Oh, God damn it!

691
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:57,434
What's going on?

692
00:41:57,435 --> 00:41:59,495
This is a business conversation.

693
00:41:59,496 --> 00:42:00,575
Is that what you call it?

694
00:42:00,576 --> 00:42:03,341
It sounds to me like you are still
being hoorawed by a little girl.

695
00:42:03,342 --> 00:42:05,368
- Did you say hoorawed?
- That was the word.

696
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:07,760
There is no hoorawing in it.
In my agreement with the Marshal,

697
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:09,477
antedates yours. It has the force of law.

698
00:42:09,478 --> 00:42:10,669
The force of law?

699
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:13,561
This man is a notorious thumper.

700
00:42:13,562 --> 00:42:16,124
He rode by the light of the moon with Quantrill

701
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:19,637
- and Bloody Bill Anderson!
- Them men was patriots, Texas trash.

702
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:21,502
They murdered women and children in Lawrence, Kansas.

703
00:42:21,503 --> 00:42:23,190
That's a God damn lie!

704
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:25,798
What army was you in, Mister?

705
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:26,904
I was at Shreveport

706
00:42:26,904 --> 00:42:28,665
first with Kirby-Smith, then with...

707
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,430
Yeah? What side was you on?

708
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:32,610
I was in the army of Northern Virginia, Cogburn,

709
00:42:32,611 --> 00:42:34,549
And I don't have to hang my head
when I say it.

710
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,812
If you had served with Captain Quantrill-

711
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:39,454
Captain!
Captain Quantrill.

712
00:42:39,455 --> 00:42:41,189
That... indeed.

713
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,311
- Just let this go, LeBoeuf.
- Captain of what?

714
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:48,890
Good then!

715
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:51,228
There are not sufficient dollars in the state of Texas

716
00:42:51,229 --> 00:42:53,820
to make it worth my while to listen to your opinions.

717
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,292
Our agreement is nullified.

718
00:42:55,293 --> 00:42:56,305
That suits me.

719
00:42:56,929 --> 00:42:58,426
It’s each man for himself!

720
00:42:58,427 --> 00:43:00,072
Congratulations, Cogburn.

721
00:43:00,925 --> 00:43:03,492
You have graduated from marauder to wetnurse.

722
00:43:05,964 --> 00:43:07,544
Adios.

723
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:15,981
We don't need him, do we Marshal?

724
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:20,498
We’ll miss his Sharp’s carbine.

725
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:23,235
It’s apt to get lively out here.

726
00:43:46,283 --> 00:43:47,283
HEY!

727
00:43:50,072 --> 00:43:51,072
Go on.

728
00:43:58,567 --> 00:43:59,974
You stay here, sister.

729
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,768
I will see Bagby.

730
00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:25,489
Has Chaney been here?

731
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,686
No.

732
00:44:26,687 --> 00:44:28,860
Coke Hayes was, two days ago.

733
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:30,888
Coke runs with Lucky Ned.

734
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:32,511
He bought supplies, with this.

735
00:44:36,062 --> 00:44:37,586
Well this is Papa's gold piece.

736
00:44:37,868 --> 00:44:39,669
Tom Chaney here we come.

737
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,233
It is not the world’s only California gold piece.

738
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:44,010
They are rare here.

739
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:45,201
They are rare.

740
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,543
But if it is Chaney’s,

741
00:44:47,544 --> 00:44:49,971
it could just as easily mean that Lucky Ned

742
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:52,438
and his gang fell upon him as that he fell in with them.

743
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:54,666
Chaney could be a corpse.

744
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,768
That would be a bitter disappointment
Marshal, what would we do?

745
00:44:57,769 --> 00:44:59,294
Um, pursue them.

746
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:04,272
Ned's unfinished business for the marshals
anyhow, and when we have him we will also have Chaney

747
00:45:04,273 --> 00:45:06,332
or we can learn the whereabouts of his body.

748
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,792
Bagby didn’t know which way they went,

749
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:10,585
but now we know they come through here,

750
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:12,419
hey couldn’t be going but one of two ways:

751
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,735
Heading north toward the Winding Stair Mountains,

752
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:17,564
or pushing on further west.

753
00:45:18,746 --> 00:45:20,549
I suspect north. More to rob.

754
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:22,439
I bought an eating place

755
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,684
called "The Green Frog."

756
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,344
Started calling myself Burroughs.

757
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:28,695
But my drinking picked up

758
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:32,443
and my wife did not care for the company
of my river friends.

759
00:45:32,444 --> 00:45:35,296
She decided to go back to her fist husband.

760
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:37,350
He was a clerk in a hardware store.

761
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:40,829
Well she said, "Goodbye Ruben,"

762
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:44,423
"Love of decency does not abide in you.”

763
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:48,336
There is a divorced woman talking about decency.

764
00:45:48,337 --> 00:45:50,882
I told her, “Goodbye, Nola,"

765
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:54,282
"I hope that little nail-selling bastard will make you happy
this time.”

766
00:45:54,283 --> 00:45:56,890
She took my boy with her too.

767
00:45:57,898 --> 00:46:00,378
He never cared for me anyway.

768
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:04,199
I guess I did speak awful rough to him.

769
00:46:05,171 --> 00:46:07,097
I did not mean anything by it.

770
00:46:07,947 --> 00:46:10,778
You would not want to see a clumsier child than Horace.

771
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:15,009
I bet he broke forty cups.

772
00:46:43,707 --> 00:46:45,038
Is it, Chaney?

773
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:48,223
I would not recognize the soles of his feet.

774
00:46:48,548 --> 00:46:51,885
Well, you'll have to clamber up and look.

775
00:46:52,765 --> 00:46:54,345
I'm to old and to fat.

776
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:57,913
Now "The Green Frog" had one billiard table,

777
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:00,584
served ladies and men both,

778
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:01,585
mostly men.

779
00:47:02,218 --> 00:47:04,388
I tried to run it myself a while

780
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,351
but I couldn’t keep good help

781
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:09,066
Never did learn how to buy meat.

782
00:47:10,248 --> 00:47:11,417
Is that him?

783
00:47:12,322 --> 00:47:13,421
I believe not.

784
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:15,128
Well, cut him down.

785
00:47:15,463 --> 00:47:16,517
Why?

786
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:18,199
I might know him.

787
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:24,656
That was when I went out to the staked plains of Texas,

788
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:29,719
shooting buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe and a Flathead Indian
called Olly.

789
00:47:30,104 --> 00:47:34,247
The Mormons, they had run Shaftoe out of Great Salt Lake
City

790
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,709
but don’t ask me what it was for.

791
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,179
Call it a misunderstanding and leave it go at that.

792
00:47:40,822 --> 00:47:43,898
Well, the big shaggies,

793
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,548
about all gone now.

794
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:46,567
Damned shame.

795
00:47:48,004 --> 00:47:51,491
I would give three dollars right now for a pickled buffalo
tongue.

796
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,382
Why did they hang him so high?

797
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:58,288
Oh, I do not know.

798
00:47:58,846 --> 00:48:01,624
Possibly in the belief it would make him more
dead.

799
00:48:15,479 --> 00:48:17,248
I do not know this man.

800
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:49,826
You hanged him?

801
00:48:57,014 --> 00:48:58,862
Why is he taking the hanged man?

802
00:48:58,865 --> 00:49:00,373
Did he know him?

803
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,880
He did not.

804
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:04,500
But it is a dead body.

805
00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:07,111
Must be worth something in trade.

806
00:49:07,847 --> 00:49:09,935
Now my second wife, Edna.

807
00:49:09,936 --> 00:49:12,434
She had taken a notion she wanted me to be a lawyer.

808
00:49:12,737 --> 00:49:16,237
Bought a heavy book called "Daniels on Negotiable
Instruments"

809
00:49:16,238 --> 00:49:17,931
Set to make me reading it.

810
00:49:17,932 --> 00:49:21,163
Never could get a grip on it.

811
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:24,379
I was happy enough to set it aside and leave Texas.

812
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:30,312
There ain't six trees between here and Canada,
Nothing else grows that has stickers on it.

813
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,377
Ask them...

814
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,809
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

815
00:49:37,217 --> 00:49:38,492
We're being followed.

816
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:43,085
I asked that Injun to signal with a shot
if someone was on our trail.

817
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:46,677
Should we be concerned, Marshal?

818
00:49:46,678 --> 00:49:50,778
Naw, Mr. LeBoeuf is giving us
his bird dog.

819
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,334
He wants to cut it in, once it flushed his prey.

820
00:49:54,346 --> 00:49:59,325
Perhaps we could double back over our
tracks and confuse the trail in a clever way.

821
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:02,142
No, we will wait right here.

822
00:50:03,303 --> 00:50:05,683
Offer our friend a warm hello.

823
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:07,601
Ask him where he's going.

824
00:51:03,502 --> 00:51:05,000
You are not LeBoeuf.

825
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:09,038
My name is Forster.

826
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:11,161
I practice,

827
00:51:11,557 --> 00:51:13,680
dentistry in the Nation.

828
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:15,558
Also veterinary arts.

829
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:17,725
And medicine.

830
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:21,399
On those humans that will sit still for it.

831
00:51:22,027 --> 00:51:24,753
You have your work cut out for you there.

832
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:32,001
Traded for him with an Indian who said he
came by him honestly.

833
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:37,727
I gave up two dental mirrors
and a bottle of expectorant.

834
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:42,369
Do either of you need

835
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,069
Medical attention?

836
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:48,478
No! Hey, it's fixing to get cold,

837
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:50,688
Do you know of anywhere to take shelter?

838
00:51:51,172 --> 00:51:53,461
I have my bear skin.

839
00:51:58,413 --> 00:52:02,570
You might want to head over
to the Original Greaser Bob’s.

840
00:52:03,295 --> 00:52:08,475
He notched a dugout into a hollow along the
Carrillon River.

841
00:52:09,075 --> 00:52:12,027
If you ride the river.

842
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,107
You won't fail to see it.

843
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:16,955
Greaser Bob—Original

844
00:52:16,956 --> 00:52:18,571
Greaser Bob.

845
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:21,345
Is hunting north of the picket wire

846
00:52:22,036 --> 00:52:25,361
and would not begrudge its use.

847
00:52:25,988 --> 00:52:29,637
- Much obliged.
- Now, I have taken his teeth.

848
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:33,655
I will entertain an offer,

849
00:52:33,656 --> 00:52:35,354
for the rest of him.

850
00:52:43,948 --> 00:52:45,439
Take my jacket.

851
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:48,535
Creep up onto the roof.

852
00:52:50,197 --> 00:52:53,350
If they're unfriendly I'll give you a sign
to damp the chimney.

853
00:53:18,075 --> 00:53:19,742
Who is out there?

854
00:53:20,232 --> 00:53:21,870
We're looking for shelter.

855
00:53:22,676 --> 00:53:25,763
No room for you here! Ride on!

856
00:53:27,553 --> 00:53:28,868
Who all is in there?

857
00:53:28,869 --> 00:53:29,869
