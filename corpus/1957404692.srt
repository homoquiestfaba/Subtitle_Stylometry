go back to the garden?</i>

I had started to work
for my husband. [chuckles]

184

What did your husband do, then?

192
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,833
[Carola] Omar bred horses.

193
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,333
Yeah, if you can believe it.

194
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,916

But the secret isn't in the mares.

201
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,583
The real secret is having a good stallion,

202
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,791

349
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
[exhales]

350
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,541
And so I went to the green house.

351
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,291
What green house?

352
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:46,791
Sometimes the people
who live here go there.

353
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:51,458
Couldn't you have taken him to the ER
if he was breathing so bad?

354
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:55,416
No, Amanda.
[puts out cigarette]

355
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,791
I've seen too many
tragic things in this town.

356
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,500
I had to do something quickly.

357
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,750
I wasn't gonna wait
two hours for a country doctor

358
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,916
who wasn't gonna arrive
in time to save him.

359
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,666
There was something in the water
and it poisoned that horse.

360
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:13,375
And whatever it was,
it poisoned David too.

361
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:17,083
Sometimes your eyes aren't enough.

362
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,708
I don't know how I didn't see it.

363
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:24,583
Why was I taking care of that
goddamn horse, instead of my own son?

364
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:29,250
[exhales, cries]

365
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,500
[exhales]

366
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,833
[Amanda] <i>I wonder
what I would have done in Carola's place.</i>

367
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,625
<i>Right now I'm calculating</i>

368
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,291
<i>how long it would take
for me to jump from the car</i>

369
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,541
<i>and reach Nina,
if she suddenly fell in the pool.</i>

370
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:49,416
<i>I call it the "rescue distance."</i>

371
00:23:51,041 --> 00:23:53,000
<i>The thread that ties me to my daughter.</i>

372
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,500
<i>I spend half of my time
calculating that distance,</i>

373
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,750
<i>but I always take
more risks than I should.</i>

374
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,833
[suspenseful music playing]

375
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,208
<i>The invisible thread gets tighter.</i>

376
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,083
[wind rustling]

377
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,125
The woman
from the green house isn't psychic.

378
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,708
She always makes that clear.

379
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:29,083
She says that everything is energy
and that she can manipulate it.

380
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,625
My grandmother said that too.

381
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,833
[Carola] The house is
about five kilometers by boat.

382
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:36,916
You go upriver.

383
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:39,166
David was burning up.

384
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:43,625
When we arrived,
she was already waiting for us.

385
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:47,833
[David] <i>The green house, Amanda.</i>

386
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,041
<i>What happened next?</i>

387
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:53,166
[birds whistling]

388
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,458
[Carola breathing heavily]

389
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,875
[panting]

390
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:13,708
We're almost there.

391
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,958
David. David. [cries, pants]

392
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,916
Sit down there.

393
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:28,333
My son...

394
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:31,041
- [David winces]
- [woman] Calm down. Sit down, please.

395
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,458
Here, drink this.

396
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:40,666
- Give some to the boy.
- [David wincing]

397
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,250
[Carola crying]

398
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:53,250
The horse is dead already.

399
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,375
[gasps]

400
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,250
It was poisoned.

401
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,333
The boy has a few hours left,

402
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:03,166
perhaps a day.

403
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:06,291
But soon, to survive,

404
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,333
he'll need assisted ventilation.

405
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,000
[Carola crying] My David.

406
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:13,958
His body is too small and weak to fight

407
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:16,416
against such a powerful poison.

408
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,833
It will attack his heart.

409
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:20,750
[cries]

410
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,250
[woman] He won't survive.

411
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,708
No, please, you have to help me.

412
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:27,791
You have to save him.

413
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,791
[sobbing] Please...

414
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:32,708
My David.

415
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,375
[crying] Help me, please.

416
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,375
[crying]

417
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
[exhales]

418
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,416
If you want, we can try a migration.

419
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,916
There isn't much time,

420
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:50,041
but we could try to save him.

421
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:53,125
A migration? What's a migration?

422
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:58,375
If we can move
David's spirit into a healthy body,

423
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:02,583
then part of the poison
would also go into that body.

424
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,250
Split into two bodies, he could survive.

425
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,166
[crying]

426
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,833
[woman] It's not certain,
but sometimes it works.

427
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,333
Now, drink this tea.

428
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,291
It will help you make your decision.

429
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:22,916
Drink it.

430
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,708
Drink slowly.

431
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:35,833
[Carola crying softly]

432
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,875
[David breathing loudly, coughing]

433
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,833
This is the time to do it. Bring him now.

434
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,375
No, wait a minute.

435
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:56,083
- Where does his soul go?
- [David breathing loudly]

436
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:58,083
The other half of my little boy?

437
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,250
[breathing loudly]

438
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,416
[woman] I know you're weak, sweetheart...

439
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,291
...but we have to wash these little hands

440
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,541
very thoroughly.

441
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,041
That half leaves.

442
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,041
We have to let it go.

443
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:15,750
He won't be the same anymore, Carola.

444
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:18,125
That's why I'm asking you

445
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:22,000
if you're willing to accept his new form.

446
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:26,375
The migration brings an unfamiliar spirit

447
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,166
into the sick body.

448
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:32,958
But you have to understand
that even without all of David,

449
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:36,166
you will still be
fully responsible for that body.

450
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:38,125
No matter what happens.

451
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:45,375
Wait there.

452
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,458
[thunder rumbling]

453
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,833
- Is that water?
- [woman] Don't worry.

454
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:02,583
[David breathing loudly]

455
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,916
[sobbing]

456
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,000
[sobbing]

457
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,625
[scoffs, exhales]

458
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,666
[exhales forcefully]

459
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,833
You have to stay still, Carola.

460
00:29:35,916 --> 00:29:39,125
If you walk around too much,
you might move things.

461
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,375
Move things?

462
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,375
Without meaning to.

463
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,583
It's a migration.

464
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:47,791
Only the things that are prepared to leave

465
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,041
should be in motion right now.

466
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,583
[thunder rumbles]

467
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:53,000
Sit down here.

468
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,208
[crying]

469
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:04,708
[woman] Don't move.

470
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,583
[Amanda] <i>I want to tell Carola
this is all insane.</i>

471
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
And David?

472
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,541
Did you hear anything?

473
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,875
It was almost four hours, I'm not sure.

474
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,916
It was an eternity.
I don't know how long it was.

475
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,083
But do you believe in all that, Carola?

476
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:45,375
I don't understand.

477
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,958
You understand perfectly, Amanda.

478
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,708
[Amanda] Did you hear anything
during that whole time?

479
00:30:58,666 --> 00:30:59,666
Nothing.

480
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:03,541
[thunder rumbling]

481
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,208
[door unlocking]

482
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,541
- [door creaking]
- [Carola breathing heavily]

483
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,166
[floor creaking]

484
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
[insects chirping]

485
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,083
[floor creaking]

486
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:39,041
[insects chirping loudly]

487
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:50,125
[birds whistling loudly]

488
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:29,375
[woman] It seems cruel,
but we have to make sure

489
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,375
that the spirit has left.

490
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:36,583
The migration has taken
most of the poison away.

491
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:39,541
It's now split between two bodies.

492
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,208
It will lose the battle.

493
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:47,708
You didn't touch him?

494
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:49,333
You didn't hug him?

495
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:55,375
That wasn't my David. It...

496
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:57,916
[scoffs]

497
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,375
Another boy.

498
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,000
A monster.

499
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,666
[David] <i>I'm not a monster.</i>

500
00:33:08,625 --> 00:33:10,000
<i>I'm a normal boy.</i>

501
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:13,625
[Amanda] <i>You're not normal, David.</i>

502
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,875
<i>None of this is normal.</i>

503
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,833
Don't be angry, Carola,
but I have to check on Nina.

504
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,125
[Amanda] <i>Her story was unbelievable.</i>

505
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,250
[David] <i>You're entitled to your opinion.</i>

506
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:30,166
[Amanda] <i>No, David.</i>

507
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,166
<i>You're a voice in my head.</i>

508
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,125
<i>I don't even know
if this is really happening.</i>

509
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,208
[David] <i>It's happening, Amanda.</i>

510
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,250
[Amanda]<i> Am I going to die?</i>

511
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:42,375
<i>Will that happen, David?</i>

512
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,666
[David] <i>You're wasting your time.</i>

513
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:47,333
[Amanda] <i>And Nina?</i>

514
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,583
<i>If this is really happening,</i>

515
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,708
<i>where is my daughter?</i>

516
00:33:54,083 --> 00:33:55,625
[David] <i>The details, Amanda.</i>

517
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,583
<i>You have to see the details.</i>

518
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:02,958
[Amanda] <i>Nina climbs
onto the chair and slides the lock.</i>

519
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:10,416
[Nina] Mommy, my mole.
Is she gonna take it?

520
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,750
[shushes gently]

521
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:13,791
[Amanda] <i>Nina is suspicious.</i>

522
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:16,041
[David] <i>Yes, she is.</i>

523
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:18,416
<i>What else?</i>

524
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,875
<i>What else is happening
at that exact moment?</i>

525
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:25,458
[Amanda] <i>I shift the weight
of my body from one leg to the other.</i>

526

[Amanda] Yeah, yeah. It's nothing,

719
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:14,916
but the other day I noticed that
David's skateboard needed new wheels,

720
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
so I got these.

721
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,666

Don't wait for Marco.

727
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,458
You should go to the lake.

Why?

729
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:50,083
Because this is<i> your</i> trip.
You should do it for yourself.

730
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:58,500
Then you should learn how to drive a car.

[Amanda] <i>I left Nina alone with Elvira.</i>

01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,875
- We were hiding, Mommy!
- [Amanda sighs] Are you all right?

879
01:00:48,666 --> 01:00:50,291
- [sighs]
- [Carola] You found her.

880
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:51,875
[Nina] I was hiding.

881
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:54,125
[Amanda sighs in relief]

882
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:02,250
Nina, what happened?

883
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:04,166
[Elvira] Oh my God,
what happened? I'm sorry.

884
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,375
I'm so sorry. Is everything all right?

885
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,098
- Let me take her.
- [Amanda] Yes, please.

886
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:09,125
[Elvira] Come here.

887
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,041
- What happened? What's wrong?
- [Amanda sighs]

888
01:01:16,416 --> 01:01:18,583
[Carola sighs] Thank God nothing happened.

889
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,416
This is so crazy.
Are you completely insane?

890
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,750
[Carola] Amanda, I'm sorry.

891
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,309
- You have to be careful with David.
- No!

892
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:32,375
<i>You're</i> the one I need to be careful with!
David didn't do anything!

893
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,583
You're the one saying David, David, David!

894
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:37,916
You don't trust him,
and he's your own goddamn son!

895
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,125
[Amanda breathing heavily]

896
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:45,875
Let's go, David.

[David whispers] Amanda.

902
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:50,458
You invited me.

903
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:54,666
[Amanda screams]

904
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:56,500
[panting]

905
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:57,791
What are you doing?

906
01:02:57,875 --> 01:02:59,916
[somber music playing]

907
01:03:01,083 --> 01:03:02,083
Go away!

[grunts]

909
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:05,958
Go away!

[panting]

911
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:18,666
[David] You should leave!

Marco.

917
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:34,000
Marco, it's me! Pick up!

918
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:36,041
Pick up!

919
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,916
Nina. Nina.

920
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,083
Hey, you need to wake up.
Come on, sweetheart.

921

[introspective music playing]

923
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:12,958
[Amanda] <i>I think about Carola.</i>

924
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,583
<i>About you.</i>

925
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:17,708
<i>And I wonder if I'm part of this madness.</i>

926
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:22,500
[David] <i>You're thinking
about talking to her.</i>

927
01:04:25,041 --> 01:04:28,000
[Amanda] <i>Maybe your mother was right
to be so afraid of you.</i>

928
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,625
<i>I need to apologize
for yelling at her yesterday.</i>

929
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:41,791
[introspective music intensifies]

[sighs]

931
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,791
[David] <i>You just need to see her again.</i>

932
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:02,458
<i>Talking to Carola is a mistake.</i>

933
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:06,041
[Amanda] <i>It's done.</i>

934
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:18,166
[David] <i>The details, Amanda.</i>

935
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,916
<i>Don't forget the details.</i>

[woman] <i>Can I help you?</i>

938
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:38,958
- I'm looking for Carola. Is she here?
- [woman] Okay, let me call her.

939
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:46,708
Carola?

940
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:49,291
There's a woman here looking for you.

941
01:05:50,541 --> 01:05:52,291
No. No, I don't know.

942
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:55,500
Okay, I'll tell her. [hangs up phone]

943
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:59,083
She's on her way.
But it'll take her a while to get here.

944
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,958
No problem. We can wait outside.

945
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,125
Come on, Nina.

946
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:10,708
[birds chirping]

[Amanda] <i>I don't remember much more.</i>

[David] <i>No.</i>

949

[David] <i>You're close. So close.</i>

952
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,125
<i>But there's more.</i>

953
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,750
Mommy, I got wet.

954
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:31,708
It's just dew, sweetheart.[clicks tongue]

955
01:06:31,791 --> 01:06:33,208
Who's here for me?

956
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:40,333
Hey!

957
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:44,625
[Amanda] <i>I'd never seen her
in her uniform.</i>

958
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:45,708
[Carola] Hi, Nina.

959
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:47,833
[Amanda] <i>I got distracted for a moment.</i>

960
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:52,666
[Carola] Amanda, is everything all right?

961
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,083
[Amanda] Yes, everything is fine.

962
01:06:54,666 --> 01:06:58,083
We have to leave,
because of my husband's job.

963
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:00,625
Where are you going?

964
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:02,333
We're going back.

965
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Right now?

966
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:09,000
[Amanda] I just wanted to apologize.

967
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,750
It was nothing.

968
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:13,791
But wait.

969
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:17,166
What happened?

970
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:20,000
[Amanda] Everything is fine.

971
01:07:22,666 --> 01:07:24,000
It's because of David.

972
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:29,208
I knew that if I told you,
you'd never want to see me again.

973
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:34,166
[Amanda] It's not that. I swear.

974
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:47,541
[David]
<i>Weren't you going to leave, Amanda?</i>

975
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,666
[Amanda]<i> No, David.</i>

976
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:53,166
<i>Nina is going to run now.</i>

977
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,333
<i>She's going to turn round and shout,</i>

978
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:58,833
<i>"Look, Mommy. The plane."</i>

979
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:01,458
[Nina shouts] Mommy, look. The plane!

980
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:03,958
- [plane whirring]
- [Amanda] <i>We're going to walk.</i>

981
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:08,333
<i>And I'm going to ask myself
if I'm doing the right thing by leaving.</i>

982
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:15,833
[Carola] I'm sorry I got upset yesterday.

983
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:22,500
There are just some days
where things hurt too much.

984
01:08:24,791 --> 01:08:27,708
I haven't thought about
what I want in a long time.

985
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:29,666
I only think about what I would've wanted.

986
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:34,166
That's something you wouldn't understand.

987
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:37,458
Why wouldn't I?

988
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:41,125
[Carola] You think
I don't fantasize about leaving?

989
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:43,125
About starting another life?

990
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:46,875
About finding someone
who will let me take care of them?

991
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,916
[Amanda] What do you mean by that?

992
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:55,250
You won't come back, Amanda.

993
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:59,041
You'll leave, and every year
you'll pick a different place...

994
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,125
farther and farther away.

995
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,500
And I'm tied to this fucking town.

996
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,291
I can't escape
from the things that scare me.

997
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:13,375
I made my own decisions.

998
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:16,000
I don't regret anything.

999
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:22,708
You only see yourself, Carola.

1000
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:25,625
And you?

1001
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:29,083
You never look at yourself.

1002
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,458
[Amanda exhales]

1003
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:46,208
[breathing heavily]

1004
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:50,750
You look pale. Are you okay?

1005
01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:53,625
[Amanda breathing heavily]

1006
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:58,541
[tense music playing]

1007

[water burbling gently]

1009
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,666
[Amanda] <i>I don't want to go on, David.</i>

1010
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:11,000
<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

1011
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,791
[David] <i>We're very close. Hang on.</i>

1012
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,291
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1013
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:19,666
[Amanda] <i>I see the treetops.</i>

1014
01:10:20,208 --> 01:10:21,500
<i>Everything is moving.</i>

1015
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:25,458
<i>I hear the wood creaking underneath me.</i>

1016
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:27,541
- [water burbling]
- [David panting]

1017
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,958
- [Amanda] <i>Where's Nina?</i>
- [panting]

1018
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,875
[weakly] Don't leave Nina alone.

1019
01:10:34,166 --> 01:10:35,416
What's wrong with me?

1020
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:39,434
- Are you going to pass out, Amanda?
- [Amanda breaths heavily]

1021
01:10:39,458 --> 01:10:41,458
[breathing loudly]

1022
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:44,416
[David] <i>That happens later, Amanda.</i>

1023
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,125
- [gasps<i>, </i>cries]
- [David] <i>Concentrate.</i>

1024
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:49,625
- [EKG beeping]
- [David] <i>You have to put things in order.</i>

1025

[morose music playing]

1026
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:55,333
[Amanda] <i>Nina is near me,
and it calms me down.</i>

1027
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:57,166
[Nina] Mommy.

1028
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:02,625
Mommy, I'm thirsty.

1029
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,875
[Amanda] <i>My mother always said...</i>

1030
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:06,518
[Amanda, weakly] It's okay, sweetheart.

1031
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,958
[Amanda] <i>"Sooner or later,
something bad is going to happen,</i>

1032
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:13,083
<i>and when it happens,
I want to have you close."</i>

1033
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:23,541
Daddy?

1034
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:28,125
[Amanda breathing heavily]

1035
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:29,291
[Carola] How are you?

1036
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,666
[woman] She has sunstroke.

1037
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,583
Take her home so she can rest.

1038
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:34,666
She'll be fine.

1039
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,666
[Amanda] <i>She strokes my hair,
and her fingers are cold.</i>

1040
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:40,625
<i>But it feels nice.</i>

1041
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:44,875
[David] <i>Concentrate, Amanda.</i>

1042
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:47,125
<i>Where does my mother take you?</i>

1043
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:58,166
If I'd known you were coming,
I would've tidied up a bit more.

1044
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,791
[breathing heavily]

1045
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:07,500
You can rest here for a while.

1046

[footsteps receding]

1047
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:38,250

1223
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:06,958
[Omar] Come in.

1224
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:09,125
Thank you.

1225
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:12,250
I'm Marco Casali.

1226
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:14,750
May I have a word?

1227
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:16,750
Amanda was my wife.

1228
01:24:21,541 --> 01:24:23,208
[Omar] I hardly knew your wife.

1229
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,958
But I think your wife knew her.

1230
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:30,791
My wife left.

1231
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,041
What do you want?

1232
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,375
Nina isn't well.

1233
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:42,750
It's been over a year.

1234
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:46,291
She's recovering
despite all that happened, but...

1235
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,250
There's something else,

1236
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:52,833
and I don't know what's wrong with her.

1237
01:24:55,833 --> 01:24:57,375
Do you know what happened?

1238
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,517
- What happened to Nina?
- [door opens]

1239
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:02,541
[footsteps approaching]

1240
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:06,375
[Omar] No.

1241
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:09,458
I don't.

1242
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:11,083
[sips]

1243
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,000
[Marco] You must know.

1244
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:16,708
Somebody has to know.

1245
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:19,583
[panting]

1246
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:25,708
[door closes]

1247
01:25:25,791 --> 01:25:26,958
As you can see,

1248
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:30,583
I'd like for someone
to answer my questions too.

1249
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:35,458
I don't know what you're looking for,
but you won't find it here.

1250
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:37,333
You need to leave.

1251
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:45,791
- [birds chirping]
- [dog barking]

1252
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,500
[Marco] Get him out.

1253
01:25:58,041 --> 01:25:59,416
[angrily] Tell him to get out!

1254
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:05,666
Get out, David.

1255
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,083
[seat belt unbuckles]

1256
01:26:09,041 --> 01:26:09,958
[Omar] Come on.

1257
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:12,000
[David grunting]

1258
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,041

- [David grunting]
- [Omar] David!

1261
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:21,458
[both grunting]

1262
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,041
As if he was going anywhere.

1263
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:31,333
[engine starts, revs]

1264
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:44,541
[David breathing heavily]

1265
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,958
