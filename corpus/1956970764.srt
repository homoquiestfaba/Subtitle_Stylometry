1
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,595
Where you going?

2
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,636
I asked you a question, cabron!

3
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,196
Much obliged.

4
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,317
Could you tell me
how to get to Los Portales?

5
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,516
Howdy, Luis!

6
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,954
Where are the others?

7
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,650
Gone.

8
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,460
Not Hector.

9
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,132
- They're all dead.
- He's a liar!

10
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,038
Who has done this thing?

11
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,769
Gringo.

12
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,739
A blind one.

13
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,907
He could not see,
but he could shoot, I swear!

14
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,850
He had a baby with him.

15
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:14,844
Yes!

16
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,556
This blind one who shot Hector.

17
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,261
The one with the baby.

18
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,787
How come he didn't kill you?

19
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:29,233
Didn'tI tell you to guard the road, Luis?

20
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,572
I have a feeling that maybe
you got tired of waiting.

21
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,976
I, too, am tired of waiting.

22
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,705
- That's right!
- Same here.

23
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,377
Roberto, take Coyote and Vato,
ride to San Pedro, find Hector.

24
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,411
Papa, I think we should wait.
They'll come back soon.

25
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:53,015
Kid's right. We got them blue bellies
holed up like a bunch of ticks.

26
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,484
That silver ain't going nowhere.

27
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,529
They have to give it up.

28
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,459
Find your brother.

29
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,375
Water. Help me. Water!

30
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,974
Give him some water.

31
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,345
Can't you see the man is thirsty?

32
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,776
Water.

33
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,539
Looks like the man needs a chaser.
What do you think?

34
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,233
No.

35
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,910
Maybe he needs something to eat.

36
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,221
No!

37
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,137
Don't want your soul here.
Get out of here!

38
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,469
Go on!

39
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,306
Just get out and stay out. Go on!

40
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,688
- Good day.
- For some of us.

41
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:44,022
- You heard of Los Portales?
- This is San Pedro.

42
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,590
How did you get into town?

43
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,896
On the road.

44
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,037
On a horse.

45
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,803
You're blind.

46
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:03,246
You know, Father, I don't much like
the idea of drawing on a man of God.

47
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,318
But I will if you don't drop that gun,
Mr. Holy Man.

48
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,715
Slow.

49
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,924
How do you know I'm a priest?

50
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,131
I hear them praying for you.

51
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,012
Sarge!

52
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,417
- Sarge!
- What?

53
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,561
How the hell did he get into town
when we can't get out?

54
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,996
How the hell do you think
he gotinto town?

55
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,331
Who ya got posted out there?

56
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,696
Stiggs and Beecham.

57
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,998
Stiggs and Beecham?

58
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,203
That's how.

59
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,675
Damn.

60
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,300
What's that noise?

61
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,770
Noise?

62
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,780
Indians say it's the gods
doing a war dance. How about that?

63
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:49,712
Sounds to me like the gods
got themselves some dynamite.

64
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,791
- What can I do for you?
- Just get whiskey.

65
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,360
And a little milk...

66
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,796
for this baby here.

67
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,199
No milk!

68
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,105
Well now, do you want a whiskey?

69
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,373
No whiskey either.

70
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,381
- You got cigars?
- Sorry.

71
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,150
What kind of town you got here?

72
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,787
You got preachers who packiron.

73
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,448
A man can't get himself a drink,
a little bit of smoke.

74
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,126
I got some mescal, private stock.

75
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,825
That's gonna do.

76
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,236
I'm looking for a town called Los Portales.

77
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,738
Can't help.

78
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:25,812
Hector.

79
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,778
Shit.

80
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,690
- These dead men belong to you?
- They just came with those horses.

81
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,261
You're a funny man.

82
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,795
What's your name?

83
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,026
You the law?

84
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,828
Closest thing they got to it
in this shit hole.

85
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,237
You're cavalry?

86
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,503
Hastings, Sergeant, U.S. Army.

87
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,901
The world is full of them.

88
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,541
- What's that?
- Assholes.

89
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,443
How did you get here?
I had sentries posted outside the canyon.

90
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,318
You should watch your hand.

91
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,895
I'm looking for a town called Los Portales.

92
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,824
You ever heard of that?

93
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,424
Can't say I have.

94
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:19,665
Then I'll just leave these boys with you.

95
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,936
- Be on my way...
- You're not going any...

96
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,442
- Wilcox!
- That's enough!

97
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:25,676
Wilcox!

98
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,645
I said, "That's enough!”

99
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,654
You're looking for Los Portales?

100
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,319
I can take you there if you help us.

101
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,794
Hell, how do you know
he's not one of them?

102
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,888
See for yourself, Sergeant!

103
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,770
Do you have any idea who those men are?
Those men you killed?

104
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,967
I can't say I do.

105
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,741
Didn't really get a good look at them.

106
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,850
That'll be four bits.

107
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:12,918
- There are three out there.
- You got 45 cents?

108
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,860
About three weeks ago, Alacran's gang
chased Hastings and his men up here.

109
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,297
There's only one road out of the canyon
and they've cut it off.

110
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,030
There's no food, there's no medicine.

111
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,804
There's no whiskey and there's no milk.

112
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,346
- So what's he after?
- Silver.

113
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,544
Apparently the soldiers
were headed for the mint.

114
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,711
- Mister?
- Canaan.

115
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,519
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- I been near blind since the war.

116
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,728
You've adapted quite well. That was
an impressive performance out there.

117
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,661
Why thank you, Doctor.

118
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,828
You don't much like doctors, do you?

119
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,301
The world's kind of full of them.

120
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,607
I'm not a doctor, Mr. Canaan.
I was trained as an army nurse.

121
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,676
I grew tired of dressing wounds
and putting men back together.

122
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:13,112
This was a peaceful town before
this business and I want peace again.

123
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,348
Do you understand?

124
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,826
Is this your baby?

125
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,537
She just belongs to a woman
in Los Portales.

126
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,163
I promised a man I'd take her there.

127
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,473
I've just been having one hell of a time.

128
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,345
- It's a very small town.
- Must be.

129
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,277
You got kin there?

130
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,015
A brother.

131
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,714
- What's her name?
- Nothing.

132
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,025
Just "baby."

133
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,763
Poor man died just before he could tell me.

134
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,589
That's too bad.

135
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,567
It was a shame I had to kill him.

136
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,788
They got Stiggs!

137
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,550
Man your posts! Close up that window!

138
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,718
Damn it, men! Look lively!

139
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,363
- He got Stiggs!
- Son of a bitch!

140
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,637
- Damn, he got Beecham.
- I see that.

141
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:48,179
You get yourself a clean chance at the one
with the shotgun, you take it.

142
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,292
- What the hell you want?
- You know what we want.

143
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,825
In there.

144
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,194
Forget it.

145
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,933
Tell Alacran that's property
of the U.S. government.

146
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:17,008
You tell Alacran we got a full company
of cavalry on their way.

147
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,040
- 100 guns, at least!
- 100 guns, at least?

148
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,704
Good, who's bringing them?

149
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,247
Let's see.

150
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,451
It's Moody?

151
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,091
Walker? I don't think him.

152
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:38,163
Gent? O'Riley, Pierce.
This is a long list, Sergeant.

153
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,996
You want I should read them all?
Okay. Bennet, Calhoun...

154
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,566
You shut your mouth, boy!

155
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,962
They all hang from trees!

156
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,700
Alacran, he nails them up for the ants,
crows and coyotes.

157
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,382
Itis time to stop playing games.

158
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,148
Haven't these people suffered enough
for you and your government?

159
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:06,283
Aren't they hungry? Nothing comes in.

160
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:07,792
Shit.

161
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,993
The road is Alacran's.

162
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,864
The road to San Pedro is the road to hell.

163
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,404
Roberto!

164
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,006
Get ready. My order, boys.

165
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:41,716
Hector?

166
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,990
Who did this? He died so you will die!

167
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,271
Give him up!

168
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,208
We start killing you one by one.

169
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,371
This is your last chance.

170
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,043
You called me out?

171
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,839
Drop 'em or I kill him.

172
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,132
Wait! Hold your fire!
He's got one of my men!

173
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,254
Drop them.

174
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:33,301
Drop them.

175
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,006
Please God, I won't chase whores,
I'll quit gambling.

176
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:38,445
I'll quit drinking whiskey, I swear!

177
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,645
I'll be good, I swear I will...

178
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,118
Fire!

179
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,298
Got you, you son of a bitch!

180
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,875
Shit.

181
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,703
Get him inside. Hurry up! Move it!

182
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:53,350
Get back in line!

183
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,662
I said, "Get back in line!"

184
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,348
I see we're awake!

185
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,615
Where the hell are my glasses?

186
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,316
- Put them on...
- Just get the glasses!

187
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,261
Where's that baby?

188
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,706
Lucille, she's fine.
She's asleep in my office.

189
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,306
What do you call her?

190
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:48,312
Lucille. Thought she should have a name.
A child deserves a name.

191
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,042
I don't like it.
It sounds like a whore's name.

192
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:55,184
- What do you suggest?
- I suggest you mind your own... Christ!

193
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,347
What's the matter,
afraid you may grow attached?

194
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,653
- I'm not afraid of a goddamn thing.
- No, I don't suppose you are.

195
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:06,028
If I want to name her, I will. I won't name
her something as stupid as Lucille.

196
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,563
She's my...

197
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,659
She's your what?

198
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,663
My responsibility.

199
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,306
She's not a responsibility, she's a baby!

200
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,804
She needs love.

201
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,640
You can't love something that doesn't have
the simple dignity of a name!

202
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:24,305
If you can't manage that, leave her with me
and I'll find someone who can.

203
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,857
Have you ever been abandoned?

204
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,531
When do we leave?

205
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,270
- What?
- For Los Portales.

206
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,003
- When do we leave?
- You said you'd help us.

207
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,671
I thought I did.

208
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,913
Evening, ma'am.

209
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,424
Johnson, get the window.
Franklin, the door.

210
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,959
I don't like this.

211
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,084
You!

212
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,392
I said alone.

213
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,490
These are my men.

214
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,003
Dismissed!

215
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,975
- Stand guard outside.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,913
You got a problem with my boys?

217
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,847
One took a shot at me yesterday,
that's a real problem.

218
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,413
- Impossible.
- You had a rifle in the bell tower.

219
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,387
- All my men were accounted for.
- Please.

220
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,024
Sit down.

221
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,429
Drink?

222
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,105
Where the hell"d you get that?

223
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,001
That's private stock.

224
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,794
How'd that piece of shit, Alacran, get the
drop on a bunch of seasoned veterans?

225
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,332
You go to hell.

226
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,232
How much silver you gotin your wagon?

227
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:29,974
One ton.

228
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,543
And what are you warriors
willing to part with?

229
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:35,945
- What?
- If I ride out and get you the help you need.

230
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,281
I told you he couldn't be trusted.

231
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,644
He has a point, Sergeant.
I believe some reward would be in order.

232
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,189
Thank you.

233
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:49,126
His reward, ma'am, would be in the honor
of serving the interests of his country.

234
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,929
- You find that funny?
- My country?

235
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,329
Your country,
the United States of America! I

236
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,062
Son, my country begins and ends
right here.

237
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:04,571
Your country's going to have to cough up
10 percent just to buy me and my services.

238
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,475
Ten percent, 200 pounds of silver,
you understand?

239
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,605
And throw in a box of those cigars.

240
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,446
I stole this one off a dead man
and I'm getting sick of it.

241
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,111
Forget about that.
I have men that will go out...

242
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,814
You got men and they're dead!

243
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,621
You got your whole goddamn regiment
out there right now rotting on trees!

244
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,320
You got dead men!

245
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,666
Now, you can take it...

246
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,266
or you can leave it.

247
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,445
A blind man.

248
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,879
And how did you know this man is blind?

249
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:49,586
He had a stick to find his way?

250
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:50,912
No.

251
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,620
- A tin cup, perhaps, to beg for the coins?
- He did not have a tin cup.

252
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,356
He was wearing dark glasses.

253
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:03,198
Because a man wears dark glasses,
this tells you he's blind.

254
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,767
You are a bigger fool than Luis.

255
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:09,704
One man kills five of my best men.

256
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,369
He killed my son.

257
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:20,311
I taught him how to shoot.
I taught him how to ride.

258
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,886
With these eyes, I saw him kill 23 men.

259
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,497
And now, you want me to believe
he was murdered by a man who is blind?

260
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,304
The whole world is turning to shit.

261
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:54,212
We will go into San Pedro,
and take the silver by force.

262
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:59,724
We lost six fellows the last time we tried.
I reckon the church is fortified.

263
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,457
That's right, if we just...

264
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:05,392
A man does not wait for what he wants.
He takes it.

265
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,734
Samuel, write to Chonto,
get Mackie's gang.

266
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,683
Together, we can take San Pedro.

267
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:15,730
Together, we can take San Pedro.

268
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,966
Yes, sir.

269
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,036
Bull.

270
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,946
Go to San Pedro now.

271
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,850
Find this ciego and kill him.

272
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,813
I will kill the blind man!

273
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,221
Be sure to gouge out his eyes
and bring them to me.

274
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,804
We are going to see who is blind.

275
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,008
It's just too much.

276
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,622
That's it.

277
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,497
200 pounds.

278
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,992
Did you forget something?

279
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,162
Yeah.

280
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:29,210
They say these are rolled on the thighs
of a Cuban virgin.

281
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,651
- I believe them.
- I find it highly unlikely.

282
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,552
Hell, a man's got to dream.

283
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,388
- Take that to my room...
- That's not the deal.

284
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:42,859
It stays here until
you bring reinforcements.

285
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,292
Fine.

286
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,365
But not here.

287
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,504
Canaan!

288
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,117
What do I tell them when I'm short?

289
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:10,951
You can say it fell off the wagon while
you boys were out there running yellow.

290
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,021
Son of a bitch.

291
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,939
That's enough!

292
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,374
How dare you defile the house of God!

293
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:09,675
I told you to get...

294
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,949
Boom.

295
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,445
Boom.

296
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,781
This is not your concern.

297
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,518
What's the matter, Father?

298
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,696
You can't handle the competition?

299
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,921
Would you mind putting that out?

300
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,689
It's a gift from
the United States government.

301
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,525
- It's a filthy habit.
- I know.

302
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:02,260
I don't want to insult these brave,
fighting men in blue.

303
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,200
Who did you fight for?

304
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,429
God.

305
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:19,941
Jesus!

306
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,481
- Did that hurt?
- God.

307
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,252
Hold still.

308
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,686
Breathe in.

309
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,685
- Breathe in.
- Easy!

310
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,461
Easy.

311
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,750
That baby's a little old for nursing,
isn't she?

312
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,788
Maybe you could bring us a cow
along with the cavalry?

313
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,659
I'm just saying you're spoiling her.

314
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,596
<i>Maybe her ma doesn't want her
on a tit she don't know about.</i>

315
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,530
I'll take that under consideration.

316
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:19,471
You should lie down. You need at least
a day's rest before you leave.

317
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,909
I'm leaving tonight.

318
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,004
That's not advisable.

319
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,516
Are these doctor's orders?

320
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,186
Yes, they're doctor's orders.

321
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:33,518
I'll tell you what.

322
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,785
I'll take that under consideration.

323
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,874
What's your name?

324
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,348
Fowler, Ernie Fowler.

325
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,354
You can call me Ernie,
everybody else does.

326
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,691
Does this place look as bad as it smells?

327
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,558
Hell, no!

328
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,235
It's all red satin and gold tassels.

329
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,399
- Pretty as a San Francisco whorehouse.
- Crystal chandeliers?

330
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,970
Hell, yes! Got me a solid marble bar
right there to belly up to.

331
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,082
That there, it's Italian marble.

332
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,780
Hell, you're just full of shit.

333
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,750
I'm just twisting your balls.

334
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,237
But then...

335
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,973
you can't see it.

336
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,937
Place might as well look good, right?

337
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,506
You're a wise man.

338
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,844
No. I'm a bartender.

339
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,121
You still riding out tonight?

340
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,989
That's the plan.

341
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,696
- You don't mind my saying...
- Spit it out.

342
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,738
You look ragged 'round the edges.

343
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,100
Really?

344
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,772
I think I look fine.

345
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,071
Ernie.

346
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:41,251
Today, I think I look like a goddamn knight
in shining armor.

347
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,357
Mr. Canaan.

348
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,458
Take my bottle.

349
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,185
That's right generous of you.

350
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,369
That's right generous of you.

351
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,973
Damn fool, needs it a lot more than I do.

352
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,517
I heard that!

353
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,953
Canaan!

354
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,787
Are you crazy, trying to kill me?

355
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,196
What the hell are you doing here?

356
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,694
What does it matter to you?

357
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,735
- How'd you getin here?
- The door was open.

358
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,157
Get off me, bitch!

359
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,662
I'm gonna cut you!

360
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,673
That gun's empty.

361
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,708
That gun's empty.

362
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,545
This gun is full.

363
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,072
Now she's empty.

364
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,462
Bang.

365
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,606
You're late.

366
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,499
Where is Bull?

367
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,039
Dead.

368
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,675
I performed the sacrament an hour ago.

369
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,883
Bull was my best man.

370
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,349
What else did you have to tell me?

371
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,984
The soldiers made a bargain
with a blind man.

372
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:11,787
He leaves tonight for reinforcements.

373
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,725
We will be waiting for this blind man.

374
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,197
Alacran!

375
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,065
The soldiers make a mockery of my church.

376
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:24,699
They spit on the floor.
They swear in front of the altar.

377
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,004
Alacran.

378
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,843
Soon, Padre.

379
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,876
You must have faith.

380
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,852
Get back in line!

381
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:28,467
I said, "Get back in line!"

382
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,546
Mama!

383
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:50,951
No!

384
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,268
What time is it?

385
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,003
It's past 8:00.

386
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,638
Is it day or night?

387
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,079
It's night.

388
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,917
Where are my glasses?

389
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,683
I have them here.

390
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,703
Hold still.

391
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,870
You better get that kid some milk.

392
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,505
Don't go.

393
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,947
And have these sons of bitches
keep taking me a piece at a time?

394
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,846
I don't think so.

395
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,789
Besides, we got a deal.

396
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,576
I don't have a brother.

397
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:42,964
I don't have a brother.

398
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:44,159
What?

399
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,694
I don't know where Los Portales is.

400
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,036
I lied.

401
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,150
It must be a small town.

402
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,320
You'll stay then?

403
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,295
I'm past that now.

404
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,312
- Here you go, Sarge!
- Good.

405
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:19,228
We passed the surveying party
about 30 miles due west.

406
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,130
They got a cavalry escort with them.
It's enough men to pull us out of here.

407
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,168
You just give them this.

408
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:30,367
You say all your men were accounted for
during that shootout?

409
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:31,598
Yeah, so?

410
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,302
Nobody up in that bell tower?

411
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,712
That's right.

412
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,111
- What about that priest?
- Priest?

413
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,983
Will he know I'm leaving tonight?

414
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,151
Shit, everybody knows.

415
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,015
I wager they do.

416
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,521
You gonna wish me luck?

417
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:57,128
Why don't you just go to hell.

418
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,429
That'll do.

419
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,750
Quit standing around, damn it!

420
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,684
Get back to work.

421
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,945
Here he comes.

422
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,486
Now!

423
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,548
Burn in hell, blind man!

424
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:28,476
Halt.

425
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,312
I said, "Halt!"

426
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,940
Prisoner coming through.

427
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,600
Watch yourself.

428
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,089
- What is your name, sir?
- Canaan.

429
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:12,362
Are you aware of this letter's contents?

430
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,830
- He's blind, sir.
- That's painfully obvious, Private.

431
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:18,526
Well?

432
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,565
I'm asking you a direct question, citizen!

433
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,037
I am only to speak
to the officer in command.

434
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,769
I am.

435
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,301
Bully for you.

436
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,405
It says here, and I quote,
"This man who brung...

437
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,853
"The man who brought this letter did so
only when we gave him 200 pounds silver.”

438
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,157
Is this true?

439
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:43,658
Am I to assume that you attempted
to extort 200 pounds of silver...

440
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,354
We only got a 30-mile ride,
we best be on our way.

441
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,764
I don't believe we will be requiring
your assistance, citizen.

442
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,092
No?

443
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,874
This citizen rode in Antino...

444
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:02,102
and what this citizen has forgotten
about is more than you'll ever know.

445
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,647
Chain him up!

446
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,480
Stand still!

447
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:09,177
If any harm comes to the people of that
town, I'm gonna hunt you down.

448
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:12,515
I'm gonna kill every breathing thing
you ever loved.

449
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:13,917
Is that clear?

450
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:15,416
Soldier?

451
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,823
Take him away!

452
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,265
Alacran wants to talk to you.

453
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:32,772
I should kill you
for letting him get past you.

454
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,877
But I have a feeling...

455
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,878
I'm going to need all my men.

456
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:42,475
Even a piece of shit like you.

457
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,913
- Cut off his ear.
- Left one.

458
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:47,585
Connor!

459
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,055
Not here!

460
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:59,002
- Where are the rest of the men?
- On their way.

461
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:00,895
Good.

462
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,866
The cavalry is on its way.

463
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:05,603
Oh, dear!

464
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,618
You boys must be bored out here.

465
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,386
They'll be hanging you when they get back.

466
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:24,654
That should perk things up.

467
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,157
What the hell are you doing?

468
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,357
Catching flies.

469
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,360
You caught that?

470
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,335
Do it again.

471
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,046
What in the hell?

472
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:53,023
You're blind!

473
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,027
Well now...

474
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,001
that's painfully obvious.

475
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:12,734
Private.

476
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:22,945
Goddamned animals!

477
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,248
No sign of life out there.
About a dozen more of these fellows.

478
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,850
They must've known we were coming,
probably halfway to Mexico by now.

479
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,190
Cowards!

480
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,663
They've turned tail, men!
Let's give Hastings a taste of victory!

481
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,222
Forward, march!

482
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,041
Company, charge!

483
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,984
Staring ain't gonna make them
come any sooner.

484
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,153
What?

485
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,663
What, reinforcements, that's what.

486
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:11,361
Hell, if reinforcements was coming
they'd already be here.

487
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,694
That's not what Sarge says.

488
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,864
Sarge! He's the worst of the lot.

489
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,872
You better watch your mouth!

490
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,740
I've been doing this for 20 years.
I rode with Sherman.

491
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,746
He was a bastard,
but at least he knew when to retreat.

492
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,076
We got orders.

493
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,343
Orders?

494
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:29,880
Orders?

495
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,713
Orders used to be a man fighting
for his land or saving another life...

496
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,554
or some grand notion.

497
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,117
I never thought it'd come down to this!

498
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,823
Wagon full of metal
don't make no sense to me.

499
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:42,461
That's enough!

500
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:45,194
We could give it to 'em,
or they'll kill us for it.

501
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,861
That's 'cause you're a coward.

502
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,100
Coward. Better to be a coward
than to be a fool.

503
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,303
Stand down. Stand down!
Everybody stand down!

504
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,745
What the hell is going on here?

505
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:02,180
- Ain't nothing going on here.
- Nothing, sir.

506
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:05,548
Right. I will not tolerate fighting
in the ranks.

507
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,826
We have a common enemy
and we have our orders.

508
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:10,724
- Orders.
- That's right.

509
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:14,992
We're to guard this shipment
and guarantee its passage with our lives.

510
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:16,658
Am I understood?

511
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,993
Am I understood?

512
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:21,295
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

513
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,264
Good.

514
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,204
Listen!

515
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,207
Shut up!

516
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,359
What do you make of it, Sarge?

517
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:45,885
No.

518
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,563
Watch the road.

519
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,507
Easy, boy. What happened?

520
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,781
Too many... too many should...

521
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,212
Excuse me, soldiers.

522
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:10,286
Lie still.

523
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:13,689
- Last chance...
- It's going to be all right.

524
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,915
- Hold still.
- No chance...

525
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,793
Step away.

526
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,086
He needs help.

527
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:21,291
He needs a priest.

528
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,894
This man is dying!

529
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:26,636
This man is dead.

530
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:31,071
Look at him.
He's in the Lord's hands, woman.

531
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,608
Now step away from him.

532
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,983
You men, pray for this man's soul.

533
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,261
What do you think, Sarge?

534
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:53,930
It's a trick.

535
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,162
That's Rafferty from the 5th.

536
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:00,702
He's a good man. I trained with him.

537
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,864
If it is Rafferty, he's gone brigand.

538
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:06,170
No such thing as a good soldier
that deserts his company.

539
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,377
No, sir, he's an honest...

540
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:15,313
You men, look sharp!
Cavalry'll be here any minute.

541
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,949
Quit your jabbering and get this corpse
away from my post.

542
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,687
I said, "Quit your jabbering!"

543
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,463
God damn you!

544
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,462
God damn you to hell!

545
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,698
Get him out of here.

546
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,956
You killed my son.

547
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,458
That's what they say.

548
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,597
And what do you say?

549
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:16,004
From your lips, I want to hear it.

550
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:20,675
I say, there were three and they all needed
killing, and he was just one of them.

551
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:26,506
Go!

552
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:34,655
Tell me something, blind one.

553
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,887
Can you smell fear?

554
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,592
Sour milk.

555
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,721
My son, Hector...

556
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,690
did he smell of this sour milk?

557
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,025
No.

558
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:50,516
But I smell it on you when you ask.

559
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:50,563
But I smell it on you when you ask.

560
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,439
It's a pity you have no family.

561
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:58,471
Because then I could take from you
what you have taken from me.

562
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,184
But you are like a dog or a snake.

563
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,648
All you have is the blood in your veins.

564
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,449
And that I'm going to take from you.

565
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,829
Drop by drop.

566
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:36,583
While you are dying...

567
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,612
think of the people of San Pedro.

568
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,584
The ones who sheltered you.

569
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:46,393
For this, they are going to suffer.

570
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,262
Let's go! We have work, muchachos.

571
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,191
What are we gonna do?

572
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:23,561
Sergeant?

573
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,535
Follow orders. Guard the shipment.

574
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,305
We only got six men.

575
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,311
We wait for reinforcements.

576
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:48,253
Sergeant, there are no reinforcements.

577
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,117
Everybody knows they're dead!

578
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,122
I don't know that.

579
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:58,767
But supposing they are, soldier.
What is it exactly that you suggest we do?

580
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:06,870
I say, we surrender and hand it over.

581
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,987
Any more suggestions?

582
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,396
Good.

583
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,027
Man your posts.

584
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,114
Where the hell is that lime?

585
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:36,932
Are you just going to stand there,
or are you going to help me?

586
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,239
We surrender!

587
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:00,867
For God, for country, for me, myself and I.

588
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:04,775
Alacran!

589
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,612
You promised to drive the heretics
from my church.

590
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,592
First, I will eat the breakfast...

591
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:21,355
drink some mescal,
then we will kill all the soldiers.

592
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:25,497
After that, we will all go to the church...

593
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,125
and celebrate the mass.

594
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:30,938
I have waited long enough!

595
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,909
I want them gone from my town now.

596
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,407
Papal

597
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:43,616
Your town?

598
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,056
San Pedro belongs to me.

599
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:58,300
Now, out of respect for God,
I will spare the church...

600
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,636
but the town is going to burn.

601
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,432
You're worse than the soldiers.

602
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,173
That is true.

603
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,032
But at least we are good Catholics.

604
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:14,844
Now, fly away little blackbird.
Leave my men to the celebration.

605
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:04,422
Dynamite?

606
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:08,092
Medicine.

607
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,330
Medicine.

608
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:15,032
Dynamite!

609
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,430
Boom.

610
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,635
Boom!

611
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:31,815
Everything's ready.

612
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,657
That nurse they got there,
she's a fine piece of flesh.

613
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,852
Good.

614
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:42,128
You can bring her to me after the funeral.

615
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,295
I will give her some medicine.

616
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,498
Roberto.

617
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,005
Get Remick, round up all the peones.

618
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,976
Lock them in the cantina.

619
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:58,639
I want you to guard them
until after I bury Hector.

620
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,074
But I will miss the funeral!

621
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:06,047
You have not proven yourself worthy
to pray for the soul of Hector.

622
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:10,091
I could have killed the blind man!

623
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,344
Who buried my brother?

624
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,310
I'm not gonna ask again.

625
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:21,824
Where is Hector?

626
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:24,764
Buried up on the hill.

627
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:26,332
Dig him up.

628
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:29,698
Alacran wants to give my brother
a proper burial.

629
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,105
He's been in the ground for three days.

630
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:35,635
What?

631
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:40,439
Shut up, and just do it!

632
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,444
I'll dig him up.

633
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,379
Do you want the silver?

634
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,255
Should I take it for Hector?

635
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:53,061
Sergeant!

636
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,601
Itis time to give it up.

637
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,860
You come on and take it!

638
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:05,236
Do not force us
to spill the blood of the innocent!

639
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:09,076
- Come out now and we will let you go.
- You go to hell!

640
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,205
You are a very stupid man.

641
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:18,510
But your men are stupid as well!

642
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,579
My men are soldiers
in the United States cavalry.

643
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:24,291
They are prepared to die for their country!

644
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,155
With all due respect, sir.

645
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,998
You're out of your fucking mind.

646
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,740
Don't shoot!

647
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,169
Wait!

648
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:44,439
He's dead. We're coming out.

649
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:54,048
We're coming out.

650
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:45,437
Is that grave for me?

651
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:50,638
I'm digging up Hector
for Alacran to bury again.

652
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:54,276
- He's crazy!
- No.

653
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:57,878
He's just upset.

654
01:10:58,654 --> 01:10:59,985
Now, me...

655
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,781
I'm crazy.

656
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:31,747
Remick.

657
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:33,987
Stand guard.

658
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,535
You'll come with me?

659
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,540
Come on.

660
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:10,053
- Put down the baby.
- It's okay.

661
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,987
Put down the baby.

662
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:21,603
Some nurse?

663
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:25,266
You are very beautiful.

664
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:35,546
My father says he's going to fuck you...

665
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:38,177
after we bury my brother Hector.

666
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:41,086
I think it is better that I fuck you now.

667
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,568
Next time, I cut the baby.

668
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,335
Okay?

669
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:03,206
Okay.

670
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,175
Nothing funny.

671
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:16,618
Come on.

672
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:18,817
Come on.

673
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:49,854
Let go of that knife.

674
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:54,859
Let go of that knife.

675
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,997
How do you like your eggs, son?

676
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:05,137
Scrambled?

677
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:32,523
Alacran wanted an open casket.

678
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,233
No, Father.

679
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:37,338
Puffy.

680
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,298
Will you say the mass?

681
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,035
Who else would say mass?

682
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:46,375
You shouldn't say the mass today, Father.
Not today.

683
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:49,543
- Don't be a fool!
- Come to my shed, we'll talk about it.

684
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:52,144
- After the funeral.
- No!

685
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:55,718
Please.

686
01:14:57,759 --> 01:14:59,420
After the funeral!

687
01:15:18,614 --> 01:15:20,673
- He won't come!
- Who?

688
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:22,306
Father Malone.

689
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,083
We'll light a candle for him.

690
01:15:36,999 --> 01:15:39,127
Looks damn respectful, boss.

691
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,402
Show some respect.

692
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:55,442
- Have all the preparations been made?
- Yes, sir.

693
01:15:56,685 --> 01:16:00,679
- Bring the silver that belongs to Hector.
- I've got it right here.

694
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:04,754
I want it to go in the coffin.

695
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:21,500
What is it now?

696
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,202
He's pulling up the wire.

697
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,413
- They're gonna kill us!
- Damn it, man.

698
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,044
- Pick that up.
- Sorry.

699
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,485
Pick it up.

700
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,220
I said I wanted this casket open.

701
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:54,472
You devil!

702
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:58,874
God damn you!

703
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:11,225
Boom!

704
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:17,956
No!

705
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:22,670
The casket!

706
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:23,896
Shit!

707
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:26,807
Get that casket out of my church!

708
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,340
Get out! Take that casket!

709
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:31,607
They're trying to blow us up!

710
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,872
Jesus Christ!

711
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,544
No!

712
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:42,580
Blind one!

713
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:45,679
Can you hear me?

714
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,054
I cannot hear you.

715
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,458
But I can see you.

716
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:00,860
The both of you.

717
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,435
You are deaf now.

718
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:11,808
As well as blind.

719
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:27,028
No eyes, no ears.

720
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:29,654
You are like a worm.

721
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:46,837
This is for my men.

722
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,218
And this is for Hector.

723
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,409
I can't see you.

724
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:29,385
And I can't hear you.

725
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:34,954
You smell like shit.

726
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,139
Take a bath, asshole.

727
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:05,882
Find anything?

728
01:21:51,406 --> 01:21:54,376
Plenty more of that silver
laid out over half the town.

729
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,670
You use it to build a new church.

730
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:57,906
No priest?

731
01:21:57,979 --> 01:22:00,311
Hell, the world is full of them.

732
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:03,516
Here she is!

733
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:07,920
Here you go.

734
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:18,660
You sure you don't have a brother
in Los Portales?

735
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:23,828
I wish I knew where it was.
I've asked everyone, nobody does.

736
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:29,571
- You sure you're gonna be all right?
- I'm gonna be fine.

737
01:22:30,378 --> 01:22:32,210
- No more ringing in the ears?
- What?

738
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:37,475
No.

739
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,219
No more ringing.

740
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:48,852
Maybe he lied.

741
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:52,129
That man you killed.

742
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:56,463
Maybe Los Portales doesn't even exist.

743
01:22:58,473 --> 01:22:59,804
Maybe.

744
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,138
But I made a promise.

745
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,842
I know.

746
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,295
What do you think of Nell?

747
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:31,964
Nell?

748
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,665
For this little baby here.

749
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,711
Just for now.

750
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:41,478
Nell was my mother's name.

751
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:45,280
I think that would be fine.
