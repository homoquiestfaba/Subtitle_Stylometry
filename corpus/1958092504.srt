so that you know what to expect.

306
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:36,194
First off, my background is
in obstetrics and gynecology

307
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,446
with an emphasis on the cognitive side

308
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,114
of fertility issues.

309
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,617
I have seen too many women

because they don't want to have children.

312

But after hearing their stories

313
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,125
and knowing their medical history,

314
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,861
I have become 100 percent convinced

315
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:57,823
that this is
a fixable physiological issue.

316
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,909
The idea is simple.

317
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:06,707
It is the singular evolutionary goal
of a species to procreate.

318
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,668
That is our purpose, right?

319
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,814
- Right.
- Which says to me that

320
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,525
because you are otherwise
physically healthy,

321
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:19,636
your system is just a little off,
chemically, mentally.

322
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,432
No different than someone
with depression. You follow?

323
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:27,745
- Sure.
- So the whole goal of this trial

324
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,106
is to get you back realigned
with your natural state.

325
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:32,983
And what does that involve?

326
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:35,152
A multi-pronged approach.

327
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,046
We administer medication,

328
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,549
a newly engineered synthetic hormone...

329
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,260
- Synthetic?
- A regimen of pills.

330
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,930
The same naturally occurring hormones
that already exist in your body,

331
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,540
just formulated
to up your desire for kids.

332
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,395
And we pair that course
of treatment with CBT,

333
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,397

334
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:55,899

with 10 days of therapy?

336
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,361

337
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,179
Intense, but effective.

338
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,492

the whatchamacallit stuff

894
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:12,505

And something... What's under here?

902
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:32,233
Oh, my God.

903
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:35,344
I have been looking
for this photograph for years.

904
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:40,742
Who is that?

905
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:42,702
What? Well, you...
Well, you know who this is.

906
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,829
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, this is your grandmother.

907
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:47,582
This is the first picture
that she had taken in America.

908
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:48,501
Well, it's understandable.

909
01:00:48,525 --> 01:00:49,792
I mean, you don't recognize her

910
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:51,419
because she's only 80 pounds here.

911
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:52,736
She just came out of the camps.

912
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:58,968
[panting]
She's horrifying.

913
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:00,577
- What?
- El.

914
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:04,390
That woman lived a horror story.

915
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:06,518
Yeah, well, I never wanna hear
her story again.

916
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:08,478
Well, you can close your ears
and you can close your eyes,

917
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:09,854
but you can't outrun her.

918
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:13,191
We trace our line through the women,
through the matriarchs.

919
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:15,151
Her story is in you.

920
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:17,052
- It's your legacy.
- Quite the inheritance.

921
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:19,906
What?

922
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:21,741
Let me tell you something, Ella.

923
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:24,017
When somebody receives an inheritance,

924
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:28,105
they can either graciously accept
what's been given to them,

925
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:30,357
or they can piss it away.

926
01:01:33,068 --> 01:01:35,380
They can just piss it away.

927
01:01:35,404 --> 01:01:36,381
Don't do that.

928
01:01:36,405 --> 01:01:38,842
- And you, my ungrateful child...
- Don't do that. Don't do that.

929
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:41,761
- ...you've chosen to just piss it away.
- Dad, stop. Just stop.

930
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:42,887
Stop, Dad.

931
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:44,097
- What about this? Us!
- No.

932
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:45,890
- Not that one. Not that one.
- Piss us...

933
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:47,958
- No!
- Piss us away.
