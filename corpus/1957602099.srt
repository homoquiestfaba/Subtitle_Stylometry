1
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,602
(exotic music)

2
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,449
(singing in foreign language)

3
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,811
- [Woman] Who's making
all that noise?

4
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,770
- Sorry grandma.

5
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,855
(phone ringing)

6
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,362
- [Grandma] Tunde, the phone.

7
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,325
- Hey how you doing?
- Hey, what's going on?

8
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,326
Good, food's in the back,
enjoy yourselves, relax.

9
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,661
(horn honking)

10
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,870
Hey, how you doing man?

11
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,542
- Yeah, I know I'm
sorry already alright

12
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,169
- [Woman] I don't understand.

13
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:08,920
You act like got a meeting,
your ass doesn't even show up.

14
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,295
- Look, mom made me pick up
mad stuff from the store.

15
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:09,838
What do you want me to do?

16
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,674
- What happened to
your phone, Tunde?

17
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,801
- [Tunde] I forgot it at home.

18
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,512
- You're not a kid
anymore, Tunde.

19
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:17,929
- [Tunde] When are
you gonna be here?

20
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,556
- [Ade] What are you doing?

21
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,515
- Don't even start,
man, leave it alone.

22
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,517
Stop, stop, leave this alone.

23
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,810
- [Ade] Hey, this
is stupid, son.

24
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,478
- Stop, don't touch
this, don't do it, man.

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,563
Stop, back up!

26
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,564
- So aggravating.

27
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,857
- [Ade] Tunde, stop!

28
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,692
- Would you focus please?

29
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,860
- I just wanna tell you
in person, all right?

30
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,236
Please, just in person.

31
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,529
Stop, I'm on the
phone, man, shut up!

32
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,364
What is your problem?

33
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:40,910
- Not a day back and your
brother's already on my nerves,

34
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:43,246
you know that?

35
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,414
- Just try not to kill
him before I get there.

36
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,415
I'll be there in 10.

37
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,503
- [Tunde] What is your problem?

38
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:50,962
- People are starting
to come over.

39
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,589
You may wanna greet your guests.

40
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,757
- What is your-- - Get ready!

41
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,133
Go up and get ready! - You
worry about yourself!

42
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:55,842
- Go up and get ready.

43
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,387
- [Grandma] Ade, could you
take me out back, please?

44
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,430
I'm tired of hearing
you two argue.

45
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:04,601
- Go on, man.

46
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,854
- You know what?

47
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,898
You smell and you look like bum.

48
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,902
You should take a
shower, go upstairs.

49
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,277
- I look like a bum?

50
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,278
These are your cloths!

51
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,956
- It's a nice day
out here today.

52
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,458
Ooh, it's lovely.

53
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,680
Ooh, slow now, slow
it down. (chuckling)

54
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,017
- Hey, Ade.

55
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,978
Come give your aunty a kiss.

56
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,854
- What do you want
me to do, jump in?

57
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,776
- Come talk to me after
you take of her.

58
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,361
- [Grandma] Yeah, like you
take care of yourself.

59
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,821
- Whatever, mama.

60
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,030
- Pull me over there.

61
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,657
I don't wanna have
to hear her mouth.

62
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,702
- [Janine] You'll have to
move father than that.

63
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,328
- Tunde! - Hey, what's going on?

64
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:47,870
- Congratulations,
man. - Thank you.

65
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,831
- Did you see Simi
come through here?

66
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,332
Is she in the bathroom?

67
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:55,003
- [Tunde] I don't know,
I guess, go knock.

68
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,629
- You go the other bags? - Yeah.

69
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:56,838
- Hey! - Hey!

70
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,468
Hi, baby.

71
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,886
- [Ade] How come you never
treat me like this?

72
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,429
- 'Cause you're here everyday.

73
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,724
- Aww, Ade, come on,
this is my baby.

74
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,019
Baby, the graduate is home.

75
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,355
- You look good, mom.
- Thanks, sweetie.

76
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,982
Guys, put those
away for me, okay?

77
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,739
- Ma, don't you think it's
a little early for that?

78
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,698
- Grown, Tunde.

79
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:27,744
Ah, this is terrible.

80
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,914
- I got something better
for you, mom, okay?

81
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:41,090
- [Mom] Okay.

82
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,842
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm better.

83
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,890
- Don't worry,
sweetie, I'm fine.

84
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,600
- Mom, it's not even 12.

85
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,851
You know you got no
business drinking now.

86
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,394
- Hey, mom. - Hey, baby girl.

87
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,774
I have all my
babies in one room.

88
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,733
- Are you starting already?

89
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,777
- Oh, no, not you too.

90
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,404
Simi, I just need something
to calm my nerves.

91
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,115
- Your nerves, at
noon? - Thank you.

92
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:06,741
- [Mom] Don't start, okay?

93
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,744
- So you ready now, negro?

94
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,704
- [Mom] Ready for what?

95
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,706
- This big surprise
he's gotta tell me.

96
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,040
- [Mom] He didn't tell
you this morning?

97
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,583
- No, of course not.

98
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,627
He decided to stand me up.

99
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,419
- Well, ma, you sent me to the
store and I was running late.

100
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,088
(laughing)

101
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:20,671
- You couldn't of
gone to the store--

102
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,590
- Shut up. - After
you met your sister?

103
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,716
- No, ma, the store was
already on my way.

104
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,592
It didn't make any sense.

105
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,594
- Let's make this happen.

106
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,470
- Just chill for a
minute, all right?

107
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,055
Just do it later.

108
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,140
- Chill, I've been chillin'
for the past week.

109
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,433
- All right, come on,
come on, let's go.

110
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,559
Let's go, come on.

111
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,813
(phone ringing)

112
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,940
- What? - Hello, this is Tunde.

113
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,484
No, why, where are you?

114
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,903
No, no, no, just, no
just stay at the corner.

115
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,656
I'll be right there.

116
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,825
- What the hell is
going on with him?

117
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,743
- Don't ask me,
this is all on him.

118
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,131
Is that you?

119
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:03,756
I said wait on the corner!

120
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,017
- Tunde, how are you, huh?

121
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,826
- So is this what
you had to tell me?

122
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,201
Hello.

123
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,998
- Tunde did not tell
you I was coming?

124
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:37,540
- No.

125
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,671
- Tunde why did you not tell
your sister of my arrival?

126
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,216
- Who's that guy?

127
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:47,842
- My father.

128
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,721
- My apologies Simisola,

129
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,223
I did not want this to
be a surprise to anyone.

130
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,146
Is this a surprise for everyone?

131
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,830
Good afternoon, everyone.

132
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,665
I'm sorry this has
not begun well.

133
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,254
- It's nice of you
to come see Tunde.

134
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,594
- It's nice to finally
see you again, son.

135
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,012
Ronda, you are looking well.

136
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,730
- Are you okay? - I'll be fine.

137
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,565
I can handle this.

138
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,902
- Tunde, would you get the
rest of my things, please?

139
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,780
Be careful with them.

140
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,573
- So how long are
you in the U.S.?

141
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,033
- I will be here another week.

142
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,745
I should tell you
everything later on.

143
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:01,874
- I wanna say sorry.
- Don't say shit to me.

144
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,252
- [Dipo] Simisola, accept
my apologies, please.

145
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,295
- For what?

146
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,965
- You are upset with
your brother and me.

147
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,634
- Don't worry about it.

148
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,220
I'm not upset with anyone.

149
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,721
- That is refreshing to know.

150
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,975
I hope you will
join us later on.

151
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,309
I would like to
speak to you again.

152
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,079
- I'll meet you in
the back, all right?

153
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,305
- How long did you
know about this?

154
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,181
- You think I wanted
your father here?

155
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,099
This is for Tunde.

156
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,983
- Oh my goodness, this
hasn't changed at all.

157
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:09,942
- Well the swing set's gone.

158
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,194
- Oh yes, I see.

159
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:12,570
- Aye! - Congratulations, Tunde.

160
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,990
- Thank you, thank you.

161
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:16,949
- I remember when I put
that up for you kids.

162
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,951
When did you take it down?

163
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,036
- Not long after you left.

164
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:20,870
Come on.

165
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,041
And all this is new. - Oh, yes.

166
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:27,960
- All that.

167
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,682
- Hello. - Hello Mr. Iberende.

168
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,683
I'm Elsa, Tunde's girlfriend.

169
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,393
I've herd so much about you.

170
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,188
- Oh, oh it is very
nice to meet you.

171
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,398
- Tunde, why did you not tell me

172
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,232
you had such a
lovely girlfriend?

173
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,071
(upbeat music)

174
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,197
- [Ade] Oh, what's up?

175
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,871
Haven't seen you guys
in mad long, man.

176
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,247
- I know, I've been
centering, hey!

177
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:05,998
How you doing?

178
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,418
Papi, you remember Ade?

179
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,087
- [Ade] Hey, man,
what's up little man?

180
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,005
- What up, what's going on baby?

181
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:13,464
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Long time no see, kid.

182
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,008
- What up, Ade, what's going on?

183
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:16,509
- Do me a favor,
why don't you just

184
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,844
park your car in
the street because

185
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:19,762
I don't want the
driveway to be blocked.

186
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,347
- All ready? Look around!

187
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,014
We're the only one's
up in this place.

188
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,640
- I don't care, do it man,
you take care of that.

189
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:28,104
- Whatever, well if you
put it that way, peace.

190
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:32,942
- Ade, I can't drive
stick. (foreign language)

191
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,194
- It sounds like you have an
excellent plan for your life.

192
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,906
Perhaps you can help Tunde
construct a plan as well.

193
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,283
- Tunde has a plan.

194
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,952
He's going to business school
while I'm in law school.

195
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,870
- Oh is that so? - Mm-hmm.

196
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,288
- And why did you not
tell me of this?

197
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,041
- Well, nothing's
definite, you know?

198
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:52,795
- Well, it sounds like
a commendable idea.

199
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,755
You could learn something
from this young lady, Tunde.

200
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,298
Excuse me a moment.

201
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,343
- What was that supposed to
mean, "Nothing's definite?"

202
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,053
- Why you tellin' him
all my business?

203
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:01,345
- I didn't know it
was such a big deal.

204
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,012
- No, it's not.

205
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,764
I just don't wanna blurt
it out to everybody, okay?

206
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,140
- Sorry.

207
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,987
- What's up, what you got
goin' on over here, man?

208
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,321
- Well, I ain't got
to fajitas yet.

209
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,990
That's what I ain't
got goin' on.

210
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,283
- Sando, why you gotta
be like that though?

211
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,951
- I'm just tryna say.

212
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,326
I mean, you boys can
grab some of them

213
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:24,744
world famous hamburgers.

214
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,163
- Let go of the first utensil.

215
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,497
- Oh, give me that back.
(beat boxing music)

216
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,999
- I got something to show you.

217
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,501
- Man, what you think I'm
begging or something?

218
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,961
- There you go, andale.

219
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,307
- Good afternoon, mother,
it's good to see you again.

220
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,981
- [Grandma] Ain't got
nothin' to say to you.

221
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,149
- I would only like to say--

222
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,319
- I don't wanna
hear what you like.

223
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,488
You ain't got nothin'
to say to me either.

224
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,157
- Listen, mother-- -
No, no, you listen.

225
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,117
I didn't want you here
in the first place.

226
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,994
You just thank my grandson
that you're here.

227
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,205
We was better off without you.

228
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:12,833
Tunde, Tunde, come and get
this fool out of my face.

229
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,210
- All right, dad, come on.

230
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:14,668
- [Grandma] You should
have stayed in Africa!

231
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:15,252
- Grandma, all right, I'm sorry.

232
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,296
- [Grandma] We was
better off without you!

233
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,340
- It's what he wanted.

234
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,967
- Stop doing everything
for him, just let go.

235
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,385
- Simi, if you had wanted
this on your graduation--

236
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,346
- Yeah, but I didn't.

237
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,517
Mom, I don't think
I can stay here.

238
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,976
- Simi, no, please, wait!

239
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,021
Simi, wait, please!

240
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,984
- It's been 10 years.

241
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,237
Why does she harbor
all this anger?

242
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,241
- Dad, don't even talk to
her any more, please, okay?

243
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,201
- Hey, grandma.
- Hey, baby girl.

244
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,911
- You okay?

245
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,872
- That son of a bitch
tried to talk to me.

246
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,333
Do you believe that?

247
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,418
After 10 years just walk
up and try to talk to me

248
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,545
like nothing happened.

249
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,261
- Look, dad, I'll be back
in a second, all right?

250
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,183
- Ade, would you help me
talk to your sister, please?

251
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,022
- Just ignore him, all right?

252
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,276
You look good. (laughing)

253
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,576
- Hey, grandma, I'm sorry if
dad made you uncomfortable.

254
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,536
- You the one that brought
that man up in here.

255
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,412
Why you sorry now?

256
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:42,256
- Simi, Simi, I won't say
thanks for understanding

257
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,968
'cause I thought you'd
be more, you know?

258
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,595
- You thought what?

259
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,139
You didn't think Tunde,
that's the problem.

260
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,473
Is this why I haven't been able

261
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,600
to speak to you for
the past week?

262
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,144
- I was gonna tell you but--

263
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,312
- You were gonna what?

264
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,439
You're real slick Tunde,
real, real smart.

265
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,316
You weren't gonna do shit.

266
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,318
So why don't you just be
a man and admit that?

267
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,447
Who was there with
you every night

268
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,948
you used to cry
yourself to sleep, huh?

269
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,575
Was it him?

270
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,160
And now you want him
back in your life?

271
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,161
- I'm sorry. - Where
the hell has he been

272
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:12,620
for the past 10 years, Tunde?

273
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,496
And what has he done for you?

274
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,957
Just get away from me.

275
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,626
- Please, stop, okay?

276
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,294
- Oh, so now everybody wants
to speak to me now, right?

277
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,087
- Come on, let's go for a walk.

278
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:34,975
Come here.

279
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,145
- Don't play me with me, Ade.

280
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,022
I'm playing, I'm not playing.

281
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,150
Come on, where you
going, where you going?

282
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,985
(laughing)

283
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,616
Why you acting this way, hm?

284
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,701
- Acting what way?

285
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,036
- Hey look, it's
Tunde's special day

286
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,039
and he wanted to invite him.

287
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,667
- Well, Tunde should
have told me, all right?

288
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,002
- You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.

289
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,505
- Heard you were
sick this morning.

290
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,507
- Al just needs to stop
telling y'all my business.

291
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,716
- No it is my business.

292
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,386
You gotta stop working
too hard, Simi.

293
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,054
You're killing
yourself, seriously.

294
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,013
- Yeah.

295
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,686
- So you gonna come back in...

296
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,728
For your big brother?

297
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:22,690
- Whatever.

298
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,737
- This was a mistake, Tunde.

299
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,363
Perhaps I should leave.

300
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,073
- No, no, no, don't,
you can't go now, why?

301
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,200
- I am not wanted here.

302
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,201
- You know how mom and grandma
are, what do you expect?

303
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,494
- Yes but it is Simisola.

304
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,371
- No, who cares about Simisola?

305
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,247
- Do not speak ill of
your sister, Tunde.

306
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,540
- No, I'm not, I'm not.

307
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:42,167
Look, I invited you here

308
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,211
and I even asked everybody
if it was okay.

309
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,379
I even postponed the
part 'till August

310
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,048
'cause I knew it was
better for you.

311
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,759
And look, I want you here, okay?

312
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:54,096
And if they got a problem
with it now then who cares?

313
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,435
- It's not that bad.

314
00:16:59,476 --> 00:16:59,810
- Which side are you on, Janine.

315
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,395
- It's not about sides

316
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,564
Move on.

317
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,525
- Janine, you didn't have
these kids to raise.

318
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,068
- All that and cancer?

319
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,737
- That is old news.

320
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,238
They caught it and you were,

321
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,406
oh, that's the answer.

322
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,576
- Do me a favor, Janine.

323
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,244
- All I am saying is-- -
And what are you saying?

324
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:17,578
Well?

325
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:19,621
- Never mind.

326
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,379
(whispering and laughing)

327
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,100
- I can't even believe
you ate already.

328
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:40,642
We bought and made all
that food and everything.

329
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,103
Steaks, we got burgers
and everything.

330
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,439
- Yes, I'll have
something later.

331
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,440
- God well you can't.

332
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,294
- So you're staying, right?

333
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:07,628
Simi?

334
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,846
(party chatter)

335
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,860
- [Man] What up, Simi?

336
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,656
- What's going on?

337
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,371
Simi, I know you got a
lot going on up there.

338
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,206
- Honey, I'm just
really upset right now.

339
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,707
I just need some
time to calm down.

340
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,334
So just don't push me, okay?

341
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,879
- Are we going or?

342
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:02,683
Simi, okay.

343
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,360
(smooth music)

344
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,782
- Oh my goodness,
Mark and Boris?

345
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,326
- [Mark] It's been a while.

346
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,787
- You boys are looking good.

347
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,162
- [Mark] Thought you
forgot what we look like.

348
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,288
What's been going on?

349
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,582
- Where's Elsa?

350
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,335
Better look out, you know
she's been lookin' at me.

351
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,586
- [Mark] We ain't seen
you since you bounced.

352
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,504
- Bounced?

353
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,297
Bounced, what is bounced?

354
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:57,839
- That might be a little bit
too advanced right now.

355
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,423
But that's okay, don't
worry about it.

356
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,968
- Do you want a burnt
burger or hot dog?

357
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:01,635
- Oh, no, thank you.

358
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,681
Tunde, on the table I have
some (foreign language).

359
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,308
- Are you serious? - Word,
that's what's up.

360
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,980
You got the classics. (laughing)

361
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,023
- Yo, sweat, get outta here!

362
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,775
- [Tunde] Share though, share.

363
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,696
We ain't had these
since forever.

364
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,823
- Please, make sure you share.

365
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,325
- Share? - Save some
for Jesus, man.

366
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,702
- What about me? - Je-who?

367
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,996
- Yeah, what about me and Lex?

368
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:29,329
- You can get some later
though but back to you.

369
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,873
(foreign language)

370
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:35,627
- Hey grandma.

371
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,339
There you go.

372
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,888
- What is that boy over there?

373
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,640
Is that um? - That's Boris.

374
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,350
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

375
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,981
Sweetness, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

376
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,524
You hear me kid?
- Thanks, grandma.

377
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,860
- I don't know what
I'd do with you.

378
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,362
- Everything okay?

379
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,990
- Yeah, you just keep
that man away from me

380
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,034
and everything will stay fine.

381
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,077
- (mumbling) Grandma.

382
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,371
- I like the pictures
that you sent.

383
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,040
- Oh, I shall have to
send you more then.

384
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,751
- Yeah, the one's on the
beach were really nice.

385
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,711
- Oh yes, Lakey
Beach. - Lakey Beach.

386
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,924
- That is very close
to where I live.

387
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,719
Annette and I usually go
there with the children.

388
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,596
It is very relaxing.

389
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,598
It's hard to find a place
like that in the U.S.

390
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,391
- I know that's why
I wanna go there.

391
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,769
- What?

392
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,103
What are you talking about?

393
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,563
- Dad, last time we spoke

394
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,440
I told you I wanted
to get over there.

395
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,858
- Of course, and I
thought I told you

396
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,444
that it's not a good time.

397
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,404
- Ade, Ade you keep
your eye on him.

398
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,700
I do not trust that man.

399
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,118
Hear me, keep an eye on him.

400
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,787
- You never trusted
him, grandma.

401
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,709
- Baby, push me over there.

402
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,920
I wanna see what they
have on the grill.

403
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,755
- I live in a very small house.

404
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,968
I share two rooms with
three small children.

405
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,723
- I'll just find
somewhere else to stay.

406
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,767
- I shall not help you
if you try to go.

407
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,560
The government is in turmoil.

408
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:15,769
It is not safe.

409
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,438
I forbid you to go.

410
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,440
- Forbid me?

411
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,443
You can't forbid me,
I'm not a child.

412
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,945
- A child, no.

413
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,822
My child, yes.

414
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,990
I am your father.

415
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,117
- Well, I just need
to get out of here.

416
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,743
- What are you running from?

417
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,962
Why must you become
so defensive?

418
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,006
You're just like your mother.

419
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,676
- What's with you two?

420
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,678
- Your brother wishes
to join me Lagos.

421
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,847
(chuckling)

422
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,014
- And that's funny?

423
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:53,974
- I used to want to
do the same thing.

424
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,600
- And?

425
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:56,643
- Well, I have responsibilities

426
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,936
like putting you
through college.

427
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,146
- Oh, not this again, please!

428
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,147
- Who do you think
helped mommy out?

429
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,149
It wasn't aunty, it wasn't Simi.

430
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,025
- Ade, nobody's even
talking to you.

431
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:04,693
And dad, I've never even asked
you for anything before.

432
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,695
- Don't pressure him. - Is
anybody talking to you?

433
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,780
- Tunde, lower you voice.

434
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,115
- No man, I won't, this is.

435
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,711
- So you all right being back?

436
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,215
- I had hoped not
to upset anyone.

437
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,723
- Tunde showed me your
latest photos of your kids.

438
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,515
So what's next?

439
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,894
- What do you mean next?

440
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:39,352
- [Ade] You had
mentioned something

441
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,021
about bringing the kids over.

442
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,567
- How do you know this? - Tunde.

443
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,735
I mean, that was the
point wasn't it?

444
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,737
- The point of this trip

445
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,739
was to attend your brother's
graduation party.

446
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:50,906
- If you say so.

447
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,036
- I am not a rich man, Ade.

448
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,705
I must do what is
best for my family.

449
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,081
Things are not easy for me now.

450
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,208
- I wish I could
help you but I--

451
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,543
- Please, do not get
the wrong idea.

452
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,086
I would not ask
you for anything.

453
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:11,051
- Oh, Ade, can you play with me?

454
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,011
Tunde said he was--

455
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:13,386
- Sory, Lex, I can't right now.

456
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:13,720
I'm pretty busy, okay?

457
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,556
Next time, all right?

458
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,600
- Come, little man, I
will play with you.

459
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,034
(smooth R&B music)

460
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,125
- Hey, baby.

461
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,961
What's the matter? - Nothing.

462
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,921
- So why you over here pouting?

463
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,922
- These people get on my nerves.

464
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,881
- Yeah, what's new?

465
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,302
Come on, it's your party.

466
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,804
Your dad's here, I'm here.

467
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,644
- You miss me? - Mm-hmm.

468
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,019
- A lot? - A lot.

469
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,064
- You like your necklace?

470
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,066
- I love it.

471
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,651
How'd you know I'd like it?

472
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,777
- 'Cause I know you that's why.

473
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,736
- You better.

474
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,656
What's up with this?

475
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,908
- I look good, I don't know
what you're talking about.

476
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,409
- Yeah, you look good.

477
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:20,829
What's up?

478
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:24,541
- Come on, let me
show you something.

479
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,459
- What? - Don't worry about it.

480
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,257
(party chatter)

481
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,157
- Youngin, you want anything?

482
00:26:58,908 --> 00:26:59,701
- No, I'm okay.

483
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,212
(growling)

484
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,730
- Can I play? - All right.

485
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,023
Two against one,
two against one?

486
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:30,857
Oh!

487
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,319
- Go, baby, go!

488
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,153
- [Dipo] All right, I want
to see your super duper,

489
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,364
best super duper kick.

490
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,032
- Super, duper kick.

491
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:39,741
- How about your
super duper kick?

492
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,158
Oh!

493
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,079
All right, high five.

494
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:45,872
High five.

495
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,085
Yes, you have tired
this old man out.

496
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:50,377
So you two are going
to play, all right?

497
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:50,877
- Okay. - Okay.

498
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,257
(boys playing)

499
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,097
(party chatter)

500
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,188
- I hope you're not hungry.

501
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,358
- What are you talking about?

502
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,402
- My father's over there with
the bafoons by the grill.

503
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,737
- Girl, this is my house.

504
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,072
I'll go wherever I please.

505
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,456
- How are you boys behaving
yourselves these days?

506
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,958
- [Mark] We're doing fine.

507
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,459
- We're all grown up now.

508
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,877
(mumbling)

509
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,129
- No.

510
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:34,963
- We should meet up just a bit.

511
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,923
- I am fine.

512
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,882
- Did you bring your trunks?

513
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,967
We're going swimming later.

514
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,760
- No, no, no, no,
no. - Come one.

515
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,429
- Come here.

516
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,471
- No, Tunde.

517
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,973
- Come on. - Uh-uh.

518
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:45,932
- What are you doing?

519
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,434
- You remember the rules.

520
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,768
- No, that was way
back and it's not like

521
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,769
she's gonna come up. - So.

522
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,395
- Yeah, yeah.

523
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,480
- Hey, guys.

524
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,442
Can I have your best
burger, please, well done?

525
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,776
- [Mark] We don't have
any at the moment,

526
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,153
but if you come back in five,

527
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,822
definitely gonna
take care of you.

528
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,824
- Good afternoon, Rhonda. - Hey.

529
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,909
- I hope you're feeling better.

530
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,077
- I'm feeling fine, thank you.

531
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:06,995
- Excuse me, I, um,

532
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,415
was hoping we could talk?

533
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,833
Perhaps discuss a matter?

534
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,126
- Discuss what, Dipo?

535
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,127
- Well it's private.

536
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,174
Perhaps we could go inside?

537
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,300
- What could be so personal

538
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,343
that we can't discuss
it right here?

539
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:26,264
- I don't want to talk
about it here in public.

540
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,307
But of course if you're
not comfortable,

541
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,141
I do not want to.

542
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,522
- It's all right.

543
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,357
Let's just go and
get this over with.

544
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,031
- Come on, stop playing.

545
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:43,823
Stop playing, come on.

546
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,199
Go, go.

547
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,875
- So what is it that
you wanted to show me.

548
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,183
- What is it, Dipo?

549
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,976
You want some?

550
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,229
- No thank you.

551
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,398
I must bring you some red wine.

552
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,691
- So what's so important?

553
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,864
- You know I love this house.

554
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,199
I miss this neighborhood.

555
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,076
- How would I know?

556
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,369
- Coming back from Nigeria,

557
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,370
this is an oasis to me.

558
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:40,880
- Why were you giving me
those funny looks before?

559
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,175
- Maybe the looks I give when
I'm excited, I don't know.

560
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,554
- No, I mean when we were
talking with your father.

561
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:50,181
Did I do something wrong? - No.

562
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,391
I told you, I just don't like

563
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,351
people to know my
business, that's all.

564
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,103
- Fine, I'll keep my
mouth shut from now on

565
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,396
and let you keep all
your little secrets.

566
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,897
- No, it's not like that.

567
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:01,276
It's just, look, I don't
want him to think one thing

568
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,236
and then he'll get disappointed
if it doesn't happen.

569
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,612
- Why wouldn't it happen?

570
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,282
- Look, Elsa, I don't.

571
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,579
Look, I don't think I wanna go
to business school anymore.

572
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,162
- All right, fine, you could
find something else to do.

573
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,291
- No, I wanna go to
Nigeria. - Nigeria?

574
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,584
- Yeah.

575
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,918
- And what does that
have to do with you--

576
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,377
- Because I don't wanna
go back to school

577
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,254
I wanna live there. - Excuse me?

578
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:21,504
- Just for a couple
years, you know?

579
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:21,546
And then.

580
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,594
- A couple years?

581
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,640
I'm not going to no Nigeria.

582
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,309
I'm not going. - I
didn't say that.

583
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,397
- I thought we had a plan.
- No, you had a plan!

584
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,446
- We've been talking about
this for the past six months.

585
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,071
You couldn't tell
me this sooner?

586
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,324
- No, I just wanted to
tell you when I saw you.

587
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:49,991
- And how long have you
been thinking about this?

588
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:50,283
- Look, Elsa, I don't even
wanna start this now.

589
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:50,909
- I don't care.

590
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,409
You can't just drop this
on me all of a sudden

591
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,495
and pretend like
it didn't happen.

592
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,997
It does not work that way.

593
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,166
- Look, my dad is here, come on.

594
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:58,958
- It's my life.

595
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,632
- Look, could we just talk
about this later, please?

596
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,300
Please, I mean my dad is here.

597
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,343
I mean, I have all these guests.

598
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,177
Come on, please.

599
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:12,680
Please? - All right.

600
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:14,682
- Okay?

601
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,151
- I must confess, Rhonda,
that I did not come here

602
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,695
only for Tunde's party.

603
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,155
I also came here for you.

604
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,160
I'd realized that we have had

605
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,122
some difficulties in the past

606
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,208
but I hope that we are
able to put it behind us.

607
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:44,128
- Where is this all
coming from, Dipo?

608
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,047
- Rhonda, this is
very awkward for me.

609
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,136
I am in need of your assistance.

610
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,475
As I have told Tunde
on numerous occasions,

611
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,520
I am in dire financial strain.

612
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,356
Please, please, do not
get the wrong idea.

613
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,150
I am not asking for
money, please, sit down.

614
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:06,734
Please, sit down.

615
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,578
I wish to bring my family here.

616
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,414
- Where?

617
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,040
- They can't stay here.

618
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,083
- I did not ask this.

619
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,214
First, I must find work so
that I can save enough money

620
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,384
to bring them to this country.

621
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,095
In the meantime, however, I
will need a place to live.

622
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:42,270
Rhonda, if I may stay
here in this house

623
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,272
two, possibly, three months,

624
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:47,442
just until I am
financially stable?

625
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:50,570
- I don't know about this, Dipo.

626
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,572
I need some time to
think this through.

627
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,285
- I realize that we
have a troubled history

628
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,579
but I wish to make amends with
everyone, especially you.

629
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,130
I cannot stay in Nigeria long

630
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,631
and I fear that if I stay,

631
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,301
Tunde may try to
follow me there.

632
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,386
- He's already been away at
school for four years, Dipo.

633
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,472
- He has been talking to
me about it for months.

634
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,223
- Excuse me, no!

635
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,267
- I have tried to explain
the situation to him

636
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,769
but he is stubborn and
claims he will come

637
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,604
no matter what I say.

638
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,482
- I will talk some
sense into that boy.

639
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,233
- Please do, Rhonda, I
would appreciate it.

640
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,114
And concerning my
stay in this house,

641
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,616
I do not mean to rush you but,

642
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,328
I need an answer by today.

643
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:45,458
- Dipo, I,

644
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,339
I can't give you
an answer today.

645
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,132
- Rhonda, I'm not in
this country long.

646
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,634
My fiances do not allow it.

647
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,346
I have an appointment
with a lawyer

648
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,264
who tells me that my situation
would be much easier

649
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,683
if I had a stable residence.

650
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:07,605
I do not know what I
will do if you say no.

651
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,858
- All right, Dipo, just let
me think it over, okay?

652
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,359
- That is all I ask.

653
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,780
Thanks, Rhonda,
thank you so much.

654
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:23,329
- I'll see you downstairs, okay?

655
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:23,704
- Okay.

656
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,628
What are you looking for?

657
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,380
- I'll tell you about it later.

658
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,723
- [Ade] What's up with that?

659
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,183
- Don't even act like you
didn't used to do it.

660
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,227
- What you got?

661
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:46,602
- Don't worry about
it, no, stop.

662
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,396
- Suit yourself, man.

663
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,231
- All right, all
right, all right.

664
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,235
- Where'd you get that?

665
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,528
- I have my ways man.

666
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,362
- You playin' it later?

667
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,489
- Yeah, you know it.

668
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,907
You think you can get mommy
and Simi to play too?

669
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,409
- Yeah, sure man, it'd be fun.

670
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,369
Don't worry, all right?

671
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,371
(upbeat music)

672
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,358
- Wait, this is backwards.

673
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,913
- I'm sorry, we have not
been properly introduced.

674
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,248
I'm Dipo, Simisola's father.

675
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,958
- It's nice to finally meet you.

676
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,626
- Oh god.

677
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,297
- I'm Alex, Simisola's husband.

678
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,591
- Husband? - Yes.

679
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,551
- I did not know
she was married.

680
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,595
- One year next month.

681
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:02,970
- I see.

682
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,897
Yes, she was always
a stubborn one.

683
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,774
(chuckling)

684
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,663
- I'm so glad I was
finally able to meet you.

685
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,997
- Please, if you don't
mind my asking,

686
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,833
what are your plans
for children?

687
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,460
- Things come all in due time.

688
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,420
There's no rush.

689
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,964
- I see.

690
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,841
(phone ringing) - Excuse me.

691
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,933
Hello.

692
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,017
- Can you get away
from him please?

693
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,852
- What are you doing?

694
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,979
Where are you?

695
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,316
I'm in the middle of
something right now.

696
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:58,651
I'll get back to
you later, okay?

697
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,028
- Alex, come here,
I need you now.

698
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,029
- That's great, bye.

699
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,328
- Fuck.

700
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,001
- I'm sorry about that.

701
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:15,418
Let me turn it off.

702
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,002
Sometimes people at work,

703
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,337
they never know when
to leave you alone.

704
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:18,629
- Oh, yes.

705
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,354
- Hey, baby.

706
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,357
Simi?

707
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,403
Hey, babe, what's wrong?

708
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,905
- Don't worry about it.

709
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,074
- Come on, Simi, it's
gonna be okay, honey.

710
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,704
- Slow down, mommy,
it's not medicine.

711
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,998
- Hey, give me that back, Simi!

712
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,712
You know, you ain't too
old to get beat girl.

713
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,717
You know what I saw out there?

714
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,552
Dodo and puff puff.

715
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,511
- Don't act-- - What?

716
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,725
Come on Simi, they were
your favorite as a kid.

717
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:13,726
- Well I'm not eating that.

718
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,561
- I don't wanna eat it alone.

719
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,395
Please, please?

720
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,441
- Fine, fine, fine.

721
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,609
Just make sure no one sees
you get it, all right?

722
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,110
- Okay, thank you, sweetheart.

723
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,908
- I'll meet you in
the living room.

724
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,952
- So you are a teacher? - Yeah.

725
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:32,495
- Oh, what do you teach?

726
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,081
- Actually it's writing.
- I see, uh-huh.

727
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,091
- And I see that she had a
wonderful interest in the--

728
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,593
- I'm sorry, excuse me
a moment, excuse me.

729
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,434
- What are you doing with that?

730
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,484
You should see
what Tunde bought.

731
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,450
- I think I seen enough
for today, thank you.

732
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,952
- I was gonna ask you
for a favor later.

733
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,662
- What, he wants to invite
Alex's ex-wife over

734
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,164
to make the reunion complete?

735
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,458
- Nothing big, just
something special.

736
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,167
- Yeah, we'll see.

737
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,595
- Hey, mom. - Hey, baby.

738
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:31,971
How you doing? - Good.

739
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,013
- Okay.

740
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,863
Tunde, what's this
I hear about you

741
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,657
wanting to go to
Nigeria? - Nigeria?

742
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,616
- What are you talking about?

743
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,535
- Don't play stupid with me.

744
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:54,869
- No it was just something I was
thinking about, that's all.

745
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,411
You don't have to--

746
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,705
- Well stop thinking
about it, okay?

747
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,165
'Cause it's not going to happen.

748
00:40:59,206 --> 00:40:59,999
- All right, mom, all
right, whatever, all right?

749
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,710
God!

750
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,044
- Mom, don't let him
talk to you like that.

751
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,151
It's been so long
since I've had these.

752
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,819
They're actually better
than I thought they were.

753
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,820
- Are you kidding me?

754
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,696
This is so good.

755
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,657
Almost as good as sex.

756
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,035
- Mom! - What?

757
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,661
It's been just about as
long since I had either.

758
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,164
(laughing)

759
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,249
(party chatter)

760
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,888
- You see your dad?

761
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,726
- Why?

762
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,229
- Something's not
right with that man.

763
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,105
Running around here
like a lost fool.

764
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,279
- Hey, Tunde what's
up with that?

765
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,280
- I don't know, why?

766
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,959
- Where have you two boys been?

767
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,126
- We were just playing.

768
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,586
- Have you seen my brief case?

769
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:27,962
Where is it?

770
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,836
- Yo, T, who died
up in this piece?

771
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,004
- Yo, what's up, man?

772
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,756
I'm about to liven
up this place.

773
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,842
I need to get some
real music up in this.

774
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,635
Ma, you brought the CD?

775
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,803
- Oh yeah it's in the car.

776
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,179
- All right, I'm
gonna go get the CD.

777
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:19,722
- You live here, you
don't have any CDs?

778
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,139
- No, man , go inside,
I don't know.

779
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,183
- Yo, where's your car at?

780
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,101
Let me go help him find the car.

781
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,978
- I made it myself.

782
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,980
Just taste it.

783
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,148
Go ahead. - I don't trust you.

784
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,692
- Why you don't trust me?

785
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:32,359
It's good, right?

786
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,705
(smooth R&B music)

787
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,712
- You okay?

788
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,214
- Of course, why wouldn't I be?

789
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,675
- No, you looked
real nervous before.

790
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,887
- Thank you for your concern,
Tunde, but I'm fine.

791
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:00,971
- Look, dad, there's just
something I wanted to ask you.

792
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:01,722
- Oh, yes, yes.

793
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,019
I was having a discussion
with your mother earlier

794
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,021
and I think it
would be good idea

795
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,815
if you came to
Nigeria for a while.

796
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,400
- Oh, so you do?

797
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,403
- Yes, yes, I think
it's important

798
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,073
that you know more
about your culture.

799
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:21,241
- Cool, cool.

800
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:25,913
Since we're talking
about Nigeria,

801
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,873
I wanna show you
what I got shipped.

802
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,002
- Oh, my goodness.

803
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,093
Is this a Ludo board,
where did you get this?

804
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,887
- I wanna play with
you guys later.

805
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,431
- I remember you making us
play that damn Nigerian game.

806
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,933
It was worse than Dominoes.

807
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:49,853
- Oh my goodness,
(chuckles) Janine!

808
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,397
It is nice to see you again.

809
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,898
You are still stunning.

810
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,733
Where have you been all day?

811
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,026
- [Janine] I knew you
saved the best for last.

812
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:56,902
- Dad? - Well it's
definitely nice

813
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,737
to see you again.

814
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,405
- Aunty Janine, men are
kinda talking, all right?

815
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,866
(foreign language)

816
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,202
- Dipo, come dance.

817
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,412
- I don't think that
would be a good idea.

818
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,247
- Dad, please,
just for a minute.

819
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,417
- Tunde, let me speak to your
aunt for a moment, please.

820
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:18,465
Huh?

821
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,384
- Now I thought I told
you I wanted a dance.

822
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,970
- Janine, your mother is
sitting right over there.

823
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,264
- She's in a wheelchair,
what's she gonna do?

824
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,392
- It'll bring up
too many memories.

825
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,227
- I'm not taking
no for an answer.

826
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,898
(smooth music)

827
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,484
- Do you wanna?
- Do I wanna what?

828
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,944
- [ Tunde] Do you wanna
come dance with me?

829
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,113
- No, I don't.

830
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:41,822
- I don't know why you act
like you don't wanna dance.

831
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,157
You know you do.

832
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,825
- Can you get away from me?

833
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:45,159
- [Tunde] Come on, please,
come dance with me?

834
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,286
- No. - I'm sorry.

835
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,789
- Well, you're gonna have
to do better than that.

836
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,791
- I'm sorry, okay, I'm so sorry.

837
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,293
- No, stop, get away from me!

838
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,294
- You gonna dance
with me? - Fine.

839
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:55,794
- Come on.

840
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:03,010
(smooth rhythmic music)

841
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,471
- Excuse me one moment.

842
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,140
Ade, could you hold
this for a moment?

843
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,809
- Dipo, why the hell
are you two talking?

844
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,935
You've caused enough problems
10 years ago with that crap.

845
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:12,811
Don't you think?

846
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,985
It's none of your business
so don't even ask.

847
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,487
He's not to be trusted
with anything,

848
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,822
that's all you need to know.

849
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,033
(smooth R&B music)

850
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,507
- I think even after
all this time,

851
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,217
but you remember that
as much I love them,

852
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:45,219
I am nothing like them.

853
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,847
- You are correct, apologies.

854
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:52,059
It is nice to know that
not everyone hates me.

855
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,560
- It was a hard
time for everybody.

856
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,021
- This is very true.

857
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,191
Thank you for understanding.

858
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,902
- I mean, you suffered
as much as anybody.

859
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,195
I mean, having to live with
a crazy, bitter, drunk

860
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,322
would drive anyone crazy.

861
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,407
- How can you say this?

862
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,242
- Well it's true.

863
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,371
- Has nothing changed here?

864
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:12,996
- Not really.

865
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,587
- Where's Boris?

866
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,505
- [Mark] I don't know man,

867
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,923
somewhere else around here.

868
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,509
- All right, I need you
to help me, come on.

869
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,260
- I'll be back.

870
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,026
- What's up with you today?

871
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:43,944
- Can you stop? - Can you
focus on me, please?

872
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,237
You asked me to dance.

873
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,406
- It's not always about you.

874
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,615
God, stop being so selfish.

875
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,912
- What's up?

876
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,038
- Man, check this shit out.

877
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,082
Look, can you pick a lock?

878
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:57,958
- What kinda question
is that to ask me?

879
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,292
Of course.

880
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,089
(smooth R&B music)

881
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,319
- Elsa, just calm down,
relax, all right?

882
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,945
I'll talk to you in a
second, all right?

883
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:33,493
- No, no.

884
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,078
This was a mistake.

885
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,459
- Can we talk about
this later, please?

886
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,460
- Make sure you lock it.

887
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,420
- Yeah, yeah. - All right.

888
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,463
- [Ade] What do you need?

889
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,965
- I just need a couple of tools.

890
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,342
Nothing really hard.

891
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,635
I just something,
nah, it's too wide.

892
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,511
Something slim, here we go.

893
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,181
- No. - I'm sorry.

894
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:54,765
- Now, it's obvious you
don't want me in your life.

895
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,182
You don't include me
in your decisions

896
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,643
and you don't respect me enough

897
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:57,976
to see if I understand.
- It's not even like that.

898
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,645
- It is like that.

899
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,522
You don't want a girlfriend.

900
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,983
- Elsa, please, please, please.

901
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,485
- But at least you
didn't wait until

902
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,028
I had three kids
and breast cancer

903
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,614
before you left me to
go back to your jungle.

904
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,674
- [Mark] I got it, come on.

905
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,175
- [Ade] All right, come on,
hurry up, I gotta give it back.

906
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,344
- [Mark] All right,
just give me a second.

907
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,230
I got one already. - Good.

908
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,247
- What are you doing?

909
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:00,622
Why you got dad's brief case?

910
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,873
- Don't worry about it.

911
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:02,332
We're looking for something.

912
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:02,624
- What you mean,
you're looking--

913
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,419
- Tunde, stop!

914
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:05,669
- [Mark] I got it, I
got it, I got it!

915
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,087
Stop, man!

916
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:07,421
I got it!

917
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:09,589
Come on, guys!

918
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:14,344
- [Ade] Yo, stop, chill, chill!

919
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,721
- Chill, stop! - Come on man!

920
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,269
- Come on, man, all of
this for a brief case?

921
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,762
- I thought that you might
like some of these things.

922
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,306
- You know what this is?

923
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,224
- You used to eat that all the
time when you were little.

924
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,268
- How'd you know that?

925
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,563
- I know more than
you think I do.

926
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,815
- Oh, so you need to stop
talking to Ade so damn much,
yeah.

927
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:20,327
- You okay?

928
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,122
- Oh, it's nothing,
it's nothing.

929
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,252
- Excuse me a moment.

930
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,509
Have you seen Ade?

931
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,303
- No, I've been inside,
haven't seen him in a while.

932
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:43,809
- Ade, where have you been?

933
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,647
- Tunde, what's wrong with him?

934
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,857
- He's got issues. - Oh,
look who's talking.

935
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,275
You know, we still gotta finish

936
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,277
that conversation from before.

937
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,197
- What? - In the living room?

938
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,824
- Mom, don't start, okay?

939
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,158
Let's talk about it tomorrow

940
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,617
when you're feeling
better, all right?

941
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,661
- I'm feeling fine right now.

942
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:03,120
- Well mom, there's
nothing to discuss, okay?

943
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,539
- This is not a debate, Tunde.

944
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,666
Your father and I don't think

945
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:10,210
it's a good idea for you to go.

946
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,837
- What are you talking about?

947
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,338
I can do what I want.

948
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,840
Ma, I got money, I
got a place to stay.

949
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,342
You can't tell me what I can
and cannot do, all right.

950
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:17,801
Look, ma, you know
what, you know what?

951
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,301
Whatever, I'm going, all right?

952
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,637
Why don't you have
some more wine.

953
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:21,221
- Tunde!

954
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,348
- Rhonda he's.

955
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,479
(smooth hip hop music)

956
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,204
- You have a month.

957
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,421
- Thank you.

958
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,402
- Why are you acting like this?

959
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,695
- Don't act, you saw
the same thing I did.

960
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:20,238
- That didn't even
mean anything.

961
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:20,572
You know it didn't
mean anything.

962
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:20,947
- What do you mean?

963
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:23,533
He's gotta go, Tunde.

964
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,951
- No, I asked you if it
was cool if he came here.

965
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:25,327
You said it was all right.

966
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,703
- I'm not cool with it.

967
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,958
- Ade, this is my day,
don't mess up my day.

968
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,252
- That's right, it is
your day, it is your day.

969
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:34,711
You know, why don't you go off

970
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,922
and find your girlfriend, man?

971
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:37,756
Go have some fun.

972
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,761
- At least I have a girlfriend.

973
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,804
- [Grandma] Ade,
would you help me

974
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,598
over to the bathroom,
please, baby?

975
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,312
(coughing)

976
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:52,646
- Allow me.

977
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:55,565
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

978
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,651
- Alex, please.

979
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,444
I need to see my daughter, huh?

980
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,452
(smooth hip hop music)

981
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,508
- Elsa, it's Tunde,
please call me back

982
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,009
when you get a chance, please?

983
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,010
All right, I'm sorry.

984
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:35,313
- Thank you.

985
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,993
You still know how
to open a door, huh?

986
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,370
- You children were always
getting into everything.

987
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,038
I had to learn quickly.

988
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,382
Are you feeling better?

989
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:06,678
- Why'd you come here?

990
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,017
- I wish to speak to you.

991
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:14,394
- No, I mean here today,
why did you come?

992
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,899
- Tunde asked me to. - So?

993
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,695
- He said he needed
me so I came.

994
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,867
- Well hasn't he needed you
for the past 10 years?

995
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,832
- Leaving you children...

996
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,923
Was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

997
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,092
Can't you see?

998
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:53,433
(smooth hip hop music)

999
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,454
- Stop, ma, come on, let's go.

1000
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:16,790
- Oh, there's my baby.
- Stop, come on.

1001
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:17,332
Let's go inside. - It's my baby.

1002
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:17,832
Come dance with me.
- Come inside.

1003
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,085
- No, sweetie, come
dance with me.

1004
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,128
No come dance with me, please.

1005
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,755
- Ma, you need to stop, stop!

1006
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,634
- I got her, I got
her, I got her.

1007
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,928
Hey, Rhonda, how
you doin' honey?

1008
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,555
Come on, you've had too
much of this, come on.

1009
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,723
- Get off of my arm.

1010
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,933
Stop pushing me.

1011
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:35,975
- What is wrong with you?

1012
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,936
You are making a
scene out there.

1013
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,771
You're embarrassing yourself
in front of all those people.

1014
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:39,938
- Leave me alone.

1015
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,650
I did something stupid, okay?

1016
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,489
I told him he could stay.

1017
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,950
- You're not making
any sense right now.

1018
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,160
- I told Dipo he could
stay for just one month.

1019
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:56,162
- You did what?

1020
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,998
- I don't know, I
can't lose my Tunde.

1021
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,500
- How could you've
of been so stupid?

1022
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,460
- I know, I'm stupid, okay?

1023
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,003
I know I'm stupid.

1024
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:04,963
- All right, you're just
gonna have to tell him

1025
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,506
that you changed your mind.

1026
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,802
- No, I can't do that,
then I'll lose Tunde.

1027
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:14,013
- You're not making
any sense, Rhonda.

1028
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,766
- If he stays here, Tunde
can't go over there.

1029
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:22,522
Do you understand now?

1030
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:23,606
- All right, Rhonda, you're
gonna have to sober up

1031
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:24,858
because you're not making sense.

1032
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:25,650
- Just go away.

1033
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,864
- Is somebody in there?

1034
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,657
- Simi and your father. - What?

1035
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,662
- I need to get
into my bathroom.

1036
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,663
- Alex, can you put
grandma in the bedroom

1037
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,039
until they get out?

1038
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:43,501
I think she might be more
comfortable in there.

1039
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:43,835
Thank you.

1040
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,558
- [Dipo] After your
mother's operation,

1041
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,225
- Mastectomy.

1042
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,022
- After the operation,
the way she drank,

1043
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,361
I tried to make her stop
but you know your mother.

1044
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,577
- You still had three
kids who needed you.

1045
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,662
There were no calls,
no visits, nothing.

1046
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,544
- Your mother has assured me

1047
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,254
that you children
would be better off

1048
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,258
without me in your lives.

1049
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,013
She told me to disappear...

1050
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,267
So I did.

1051
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,697
- Just leave. - No, I cannot go.

1052
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,746
- Look, I can't take
this right now, okay?

1053
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:02,747
So please leave.

1054
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,958
- We must finish this.

1055
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,085
- I don't feel like
talking right now.

1056
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:07,502
Look, I'm fuckin'
pregnant, okay?

1057
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,629
Can you just leave me alone?

1058
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:10,255
- You are what?

1059
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,093
- I'm pregnant.

1060
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,605
- Tell Ade to come in.

1061
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,107
I wanna talk to
him. - All right.

1062
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:38,950
- Hey.

1063
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,955
- I have to check on
Tunde's presents.

1064
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:44,998
- I need to speak to you.

1065
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:45,915
- Look, I can't talk
right now, okay?

1066
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:46,291
Maybe later.

1067
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,175
(lighthearted guitar music)

1068
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,146
- Everyone gather around.

1069
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,026
Gather around, could
everybody gather around?

1070
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,030
I need everyone
to gather around.

1071
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,881
I would like to take time away,

1072
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,721
I mean out of our
very interesting day

1073
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,226
to celebrate my son's
new stage in life.

1074
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,024
He's already looking
to make changes.

1075
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,073
I appreciate the
love and support

1076
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,036
you have given to
me and my kids,

1077
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,457
besides today and--

1078
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,462
- I just wanna thank everyone
for being here tonight.

1079
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:02,218
Especially, my family,
it's nice to see everyone.

1080
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,265
- What are your plans
now that you're here?

1081
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,767
- You asked me this
earlier. - No, I didn't.

1082
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,144
- I told you I have no plans.

1083
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,440
- You sure about that?

1084
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:18,276
I mean, come to the
U.S with no plans?

1085
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,944
That's a little bit
strange, isn't it?

1086
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:23,281
- It's my son's graduation,
isn't that reason enough?

1087
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:23,948
- You tell me.

1088
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,077
- Why are we
discussing this, Ade?

1089
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:33,791
- No reason.

1090
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,126
- Best gift for me
would be for my family

1091
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:38,463
to come and have a game
with me like we used to.

1092
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,464
Come on, come on.

1093
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,302
Come on, Simi, come on.

1094
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,382
- Would you stop? - No.

1095
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:27,303
- Ade is right, Simi, perhaps
tea would be better?

1096
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,055
- No, I'm fine, this is fine.

1097
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:29,597
- No it's not fine.

1098
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:29,972
- [Rhonda] Ade, would
you just let her

1099
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,183
have the wine, please?

1100
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:32,642
You're not her daddy!
- I said, stop.

1101
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,186
- Guys, let's just play, okay?

1102
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:35,561
- Why are we arguing
about this, huh?

1103
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,396
You know why I said no?

1104
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,065
Simi, do you think a woman

1105
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:41,526
in your condition
should be drinking?

1106
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,902
- You told him?

1107
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:45,530
- He didn't tell
me a damn thing.

1108
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:46,989
Keep your voice down next
time you're in the bathroom.

1109
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,366
I heard everything you said.

1110
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,375
- Simi, right now, I need
to know what's going on.

1111
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,220
- Ade, that was not
your business to tell.

1112
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,597
Everything that happens in
this house is my business.

1113
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:38,624
- So?

1114
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:42,461
What's going on?

1115
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:48,050
- I don't wanna have a
family, Alex, not now.

1116
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,054
- But what about earlier?

1117
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,055
- I changed my mind.

1118
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,059
- Simi, Simi this is serious.

1119
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,115
When were you planning
on telling me this?

1120
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:18,623
Were you planning
on telling me this?

1121
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,124
- If I decided to keep it.

1122
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:27,465
- You can't make this type
of decision without me.

1123
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:30,176
- Alex, there's nothing
else to say, all right?

1124
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,643
- But what about me?

1125
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:40,144
- What about you?

1126
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,148
- Simi, Simi...

1127
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,154
Look at me.

1128
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:57,328
I love you.

1129
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:03,709
We're having a baby.

1130
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:10,549
We're having our baby.

1131
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:57,722
- Hey, aunty.

1132
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,227
It's been a night huh? - Mm-hmm.

1133
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:08,065
- Can I ask you something?

1134
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,234
- What are you trying
to do damage control?

1135
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:15,406
- Look, I really just wanna
talk with you right now.

1136
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,077
Did my parents ever
get a divorce?

1137
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,121
- Why does it matter?

1138
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,582
- It just does.

1139
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,125
- Look, Ade, don't play
these little games

1140
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:26,751
with me, all right?

1141
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:27,168
I'm not gonna tell you
shit until you tell me

1142
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,794
what the hell is going on.

1143
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,260
- I think dad's tryna
get the house back.

1144
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:39,305
- And this is coming from where?

1145
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,097
- Looked in his brief case,

1146
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:42,641
found some legal papers about
the house and their assets.

1147
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:47,104
What is it?

1148
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,610
- He asked your mother
if he could stay.

1149
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,153
- What are you talking about?

1150
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,488
- Your mother said he could
stay here for one month

1151
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,573
until he got back on his feet.

1152
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,408
- She what? - She
said he could stay.

1153
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:03,788
- Thank you, baby.
- You're welcome.

1154
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,164
- How are you doing?

1155
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,499
I'm doing okay, mama.

1156
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:09,293
- Come on over here
and let me see you.

1157
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,631
Girl, you need to stay
away from that bottle.

1158
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,341
- All right, ma.

1159
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:15,800
- Mama, I have to
talk to you please.

1160
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,344
- No, Ade, I'm busy right now.

1161
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:18,969
- [Grandma] She is too drunk,
tell her when she's sober.

1162
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,305
- I'm not drunk!

1163
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,181
What do you gotta tell me?

1164
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,600
- Mama. - What?

1165
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,852
- Not here. - It's
about, Dad, okay?

1166
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,438
- Not here. - Look,
this is my house.

1167
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,857
Don't tell my boy what
to do in my house.

1168
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,692
- Mom, don't let dad stay here.

1169
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,321
- What like it's
some big secret?

1170
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:37,905
He would have found
out about it anyway.

1171
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,324
- Janine, you are
always doing the same--

1172
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:40,741
- Mom, listen to me,
this is important!

1173
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,785
Dad want's the house, okay?

1174
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,537
- How do you know?

1175
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:45,663
- I found some legal
papers in his brief case

1176
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:47,164
about you and the house.

1177
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,504
Mom?

1178
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:54,672
- I told you, you should
have divorced him.

1179
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:56,465
Why didn't you ever divorce him?

1180
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,717
- Janine, could you
shut up for one second?

1181
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:02,888
Damn it, I don't believe this.

1182
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,852
He told me he wanted
my assistance.

1183
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:13,357
I'm gonna give him my assistance
and shove it up his ass.

1184
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,734
I'm gonna tell him to get the
fuck out of my house, Janine.

1185
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:17,736
- Listen to me, if you do that,

1186
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:18,195
you'll never get him
out of your house.

1187
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:21,740
Calm down and think about it.

1188
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,868
- I don't wanna
calm down, Janine.

1189
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:25,744
- You can do this.
- She's right, mom.

1190
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:36,941
- It so strange being
back here at times.

1191
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,948
But I guess now I will have
some time to get used to it.

1192
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:51,288
- Look, Dipo, I have to talk
with you about something.

1193
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:53,666
You know with Tunde here and
a new child on the way,

1194
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,920
just not sure if we're
going to have the room

1195
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:58,963
for you to stay here.

1196
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:05,344
- But I will only
be here a month.

1197
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,346
- I know but it's
just not a good time.

1198
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,310
- Did I do something wrong?

1199
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:17,356
- No, no, no it's just
there are going to be

1200
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:20,025
a lot of people running
around here soon

1201
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:21,944
and I don't think
I'll have the room.

1202
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:27,616
- What, Simisola doesn't
live here anymore.

1203
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:30,035
- Tunde is talking of staying
with my family in Nigeria.

1204
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,495
I don't take up much space.

1205
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,373
I don't understand.

1206
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,000
- I know Dipo but the
house isn't that big.

1207
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,674
- I am asking for
your help, Rhonda.

1208
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:44,883
- I wish I could do more.

1209
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:49,513
Sorry.

1210
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:59,523
- This house is
still in my name.

1211
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:03,694
- It's in mine too.

1212
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,822
- I still have some
right to this house.

1213
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,032
What I'm asking is not much.

1214
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:10,492
- No this ceased
to be your house

1215
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:12,077
the minute you
walked out the door,

1216
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:14,663
leaving me alone
with three kids!

1217
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,082
- Rhonda, I need to get
my family over here.

1218
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:17,666
- And?

1219
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:21,545
- Rhonda, I do not want to
make things difficult for you

1220
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,756
but I will do what I must.

1221
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:23,964
Don't force me to
take legal action.

1222
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:25,924
- What?

1223
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:26,759
- You leave me no
other recourse!

1224
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,386
- Bullshit, bullshit!

1225
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,888
How about you and
your monkey kids

1226
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:32,931
go find some other damn place--

1227
01:12:32,973 --> 01:12:36,560
- Rhonda, my family will
stay here in this house

1228
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,604
or the house will be sold.

1229
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:39,730
I've already spoken to an
attorney about this matter.

1230
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:40,856
- What are you talking about?

1231
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,108
Dipo, you walked out on us!

1232
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:43,650
- Well the law
states otherwise--

1233
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,945
- I don't give a
fuck about the law.

1234
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:49,448
- Rhonda, Rhonda-- -
No, do me a favor.

1235
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,574
Get out of my house.

1236
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:51,158
- Please, Rhonda.
- Out of my house.

1237
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:53,410
- I do not wish for
us to be this way.

1238
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:04,088
I and my family will
stay in this house

1239
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:05,964
or the house will be sold.

1240
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:14,973
- Get out of my house!

1241
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,725
- Tunde, my brief case please.

1242
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,646
My brief case, just
give me my brief case.

1243
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:21,939
- Dad, what happened?

1244
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:22,648
- Just get me my
brief case, please?

1245
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,983
- Tell me, what happened?
- Did you know about this?

1246
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:26,485
I told you not to
bring him back here.

1247
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,112
(yelling)

1248
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,492
It's my house, get out
and leave us alone.

1249
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:35,160
- Will you get me my brief case?

1250
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:36,120
- [Grandma] Why don't you leave?

1251
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:37,454
Just get out of our house.

1252
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,165
Just get out of our house!

1253
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:40,582
- Dad, it's not true, right dad?

1254
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:42,584
It's not true, just tell me.

1255
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:43,001
- Tunde, I am not
going to stay here

1256
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:45,170
and explain myself to you.

1257
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,964
Give me my case.

1258
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:47,339
- Just tell me, you can't
even just answer me.

1259
01:13:47,339 --> 01:13:48,632
You're not taking it.

1260
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:56,014
- You son of a bitch,
get out of my house!

1261
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,811
(screaming)

1262
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,008
- So today was just bullshit?

1263
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:41,059
- This was a mistake, Tunde.

1264
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,689
I shouldn't of have come.

1265
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,857
- You just came for
the fuckin' house?

1266
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:47,191
You never came for me?

1267
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,864
- You do not understand.

1268
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,657
- No, I understand, man.

1269
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:58,243
This was never about me.

1270
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:00,871
It was just about you and
your new fucking family.

1271
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:01,038
The fuck is wrong?

1272
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:08,712
- They are not my new family.

1273
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:10,047
They are my family.

1274
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:11,173
- Then what are we?

1275
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,716
What the fuck are we then?

1276
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:18,889
You son of a bitch, I can't
believe you played me like that.

1277
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,892
- That is not the case.

1278
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,937
- Then what is the
case? (sobbing)

1279
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:31,235
Did you ever love us?

1280
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:43,956
I never wanna see you again.

1281
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,919
(exotic music)
