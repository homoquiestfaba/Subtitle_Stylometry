00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,742
*crickets*

00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,514
*radio playing*

4
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:06,365
*eerie music playing*

5
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:18,677
Oh, I'm so hungry.

6
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:28,087
If only there was some juicy,
   delectable, tasty humans.

7
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:33,525
But wait. I see one, two.

8
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,796
But which one will I eat first?

9
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:38,497
Her.

10
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,849
Her.

11
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,200
Her? You think her?

12
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:45,771
Well, maybe I'm gonna eat
       her anyway. Ahhh!

13
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:46,772
*laughs*

14
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:47,840
Oh, I've got you.

15
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:50,109
*footsteps*

16
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,279
Oh, I'm gonna miss you girls.

17
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,714
I hate it when you're away.

18
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,733
When will you be back?

19
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:59,751
It's just a couple of days
      this time, alright?

20
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:03,355
Enough scary stories. Bed time.

21
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,557
No.

22
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,826
Come on. Bed time

23
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,362
Okay. Why don't you guys go
      and brush your teeth

24
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:13,132
and I'll come upstairs, and
 we'll read that book that you
          love, okay?

25
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:16,435
Okay. Go. Go. Quickly. Race.

26
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,903
*running*

27
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:19,771
I could get used to this.

28
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,741
Yeah. This...

29
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,845
this conference is...

30
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:31,583
It's the most important thing
 ever. I know. You already said
             that.

31
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,852
Yeah. It's a big one.
      It's a game changer.

32
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:36,855
Yeah, same as the last one,
  and the next one after that.

33
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:40,726
Because I don't wanna, I don't
 wanna bring the girls up in my
        Mom's old house

34
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,662
and I want them to have
      their own bedrooms.

35
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,465
*sighs*

36
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,267
They love sharing, you know?
  Almost as much as they love
     their Dad coming home.

37
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:58,377
Yeah, well, this is it and then
 I am all theirs, and I'm all
             ours.

38
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,713
If that's okay, huh?

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,459
Bye.

40
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,231

*hums*

44
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,621
Jess, you seen the book the
          girls love?

45
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,559
*books shuffle*

46
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,295

47
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:55,867
*clock ticking*

48
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:08,814
Babe. I'm gonna check
      if it's in the car.

49
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,883
*footsteps*

50
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,292
*door locked*

51
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,761
Jess, you seen the keys?

52
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:30,902
*hums*

53
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,278
What the fuck?

54
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,579
*glass breaks*

55
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:42,648
*door slam*

56
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,885
What's wrong with Mommy?

57
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,954
*screams*

58
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:54,826
Baby, you stay here with Mommy.
    Don't move. Don't move.

59
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,862
*heavy breathing

00:04:56,864 --> 00:05:00,666

*door slam*

63
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:11,777
Daddy!

64
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:17,049
*heavy breathing*

65
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,022
Baby?

66
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:26,992
Baby?

67
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,066
Oh, baby. Baby, give me your
             hand.

68
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:36,068
Baby, it's okay.

69
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,337
It's okay. Give me your hand.

70
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,839
Baby, come on. It's okay.

71
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,908
Baby.

72
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,115
*whispers* Stay there.

73
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,117
*grunts*

74
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:55,587

*grunts*

77
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:24,916
*struggling and heavy breathin*á

78
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,594
Welcome to paradise.

79
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,129
See anything on your way in?

80
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,398
*wheezes*

81
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,776
Aah!

82
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:58,450
*chains clinking*

83
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,790
It's no use.

84
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,791
Oh fuck!

85
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:11,997
Oh, God. Jess. The kids.

86
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,567
No. No. No. Fuck, no.

87
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,469
He doesn't want them.

88
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,104
Only you.

89
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,740
What's your name?

90
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,743
Jay.

91
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,212
Adam.

92
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,680
Kat.

93
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,016
*wheezing*

94
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,987
What is this place?

95
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:38,056
As bad as it looks, man.

96
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,661
I gotta get the fuck outta here.

97
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:51,102

*sighs*

101
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,134
You behave, you stay here.

102
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,071
You don't, you go back.
          Understand?

103
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,278
Eat.

104
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:36,915
*sighs*

105
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,192
I said eat, boy.

106
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,595
*panting*

107
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,036

00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,658
What do we do when we're upset?

133
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,793
Remember.

134
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,728
Remember what?

135
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,230
Who saved me.

136
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:08,233
Yeah. Good boy. Hmm?

137
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,702
I just want my Mom.

138
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:14,773
Your mother and father are scum.
      They abandoned you.

139
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:20,045
If they cared about you, they'd
have come looking for you, now,
        wouldn't they?

140
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,448
I'm your father now.

141
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:28,086
And if you upset me,
   I swear to fucking God...

142
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:33,091
*whispers* Yeah. That's a good
              boy.

*restrains retracting*

148
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,727
He was there when I got here.

149
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,096
Kat calls him Paul.

150
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:11,996
*wheezes*

151
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,832
After my cat.

152
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,467
Paul doesn't say much.

153
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,003
*chains*

154
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,773
Where were you when
        you were taken?

155
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,408
Parking lot after a night out.

156
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,944
Working the graveyard shift.

157
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:28,012

163
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,475
It's his playground.

164
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,878
Whose?

165
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,946
*wheezes*

166
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,252
See, this must have been a
            mistake

167
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,254
'cause I'm a good person.

168
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,790
I didn't do anything wrong.

169
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,160
You see, I do charity. I...

170
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:17,562
I gave blood once.

171
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:19,864
Oh, get used to that shit.

172
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,967
A big fan of the red stuff.

173
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,203
I take it you've tried
    to talk to this prick?

174
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:30,041
Oh, yeah. I've tried to hug
  it out, bought him flowers.

175
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:33,044
One guy did all this? I mean,
     you're a fucking cop!

176
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,579
Security guard.

177
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,047
Well, you are.

178
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,949
*wheezes*

179
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,050
Good to know.

00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:27,899
*forks scraping*

187
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,901
Are you trying to test me?

188
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,970
*food crunching*

189
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:37,008
Hey, don't start with me, son.

190
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,345
*lip smacking*

191
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:41,512
Dominic?

192
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,484
*chair squeaking*

193
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:48,953
*chair sliding briskly*

194
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,255
Father, I'm sorry!

195
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,055
Are ya?

196
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:51,923
Yes!

197
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:52,657
Say it again.

198
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:53,458
I'm sorry!

199
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,459
Ssh.

200
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,527
*screams*

201
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,567
That's it. Let the evil out.

202
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,271
*sobs*

203
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:23,421
*wheezes*

204
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,058
*panting*

205
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,259
What was that?

206
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,694
Feeding time.

207
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,095
What's with the lights?

208
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,697
Well, it ain't fucking
           Christmas.

209
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,633
What, so he warns you
    before he tortures you?

210
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,135
Yep.

211
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:41,372
Only it's not him that
      does the torturing.

212
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:43,474
Who does?

213
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:46,611
*wheezes*

214
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,514
*cell window opening*

215
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,016
*cell window slams*

216
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:56,554
*panting*

217
00:15:56,556 --> 00:16:01,526
*heavy breathing*

218
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:07,298
*meat chewing*

219
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,967
You're his pets.

220
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,336
It's not even cooked.

221
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,505
*meat chewing*

222
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:17,675
No thanks. I'm vegan.

223
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,344
*laughs*

224
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,612
Of course, by vegan
       you mean fucked.

225
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:25,550
Well don't waste it.
        Throw it back.

226
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,752
*meat chewing*

227
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,988
Quite the summer
        camp, ain't it?

228
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,123
It's a big mistake, not eating.

229
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,125
Not exactly Mother Theresa.

230
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,461
*wheezes*

231
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,162
What about Paul?

232
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,164
He gets injections.

233
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,233
They keep him alive.

234
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,106
That's your future, right there.

235
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,108
*chewing food*

236
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,176
You two can do
         what you want

237
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,346
but I'm getting outta
      here if it kills me.

238
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,716
A very poor choice of words.

239
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:02,620
*wheezes*

240
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,359
*grunts*

241
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,128
Come on!

242
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,529
Any loose?

243
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,764
Not yet.

244
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,265
*scraping the wall*

245
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,500
Nothing your side?

246
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,035
Found this.

247
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,638
Not been very lucky for me.

248
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:23,775
What?

249
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,415
*laughs*

250
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,750
It's a waste of time.

251
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,453
Like your police application?

252
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,155
Like your mom's labor.

253
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,590
*laughs*

254
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,160
*panting*

255
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,628
Not got any keys?

256
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,662
Nope.

257
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,564
Do you have any?

258
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,633
*laughs*

259
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,471
*screams*

260
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,840
Shit!

261
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:00,578
*groants*

262
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,447
A hundred years,
        and nails like

263
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:05,349
Freddy fucking Krueger
    wouldn't get through it.

264
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:06,417
*groants*

265
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,486
Or you could learn
         the hard way.

266
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,390
Adam's right.

267
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,291
The only way out is
       through that door.

268
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:21,699
*wheezes*

269
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:23,634
*sighs*

270
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,637
*panting*

271
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:32,276
*chains clanking*

272
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,548
Hey.

273
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,484
Seriously. If he sees you doing
that, he'll go fucking insane.

274
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,353
I had an ex just like you.

275
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,122
He wouldn't give up either.

276
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:48,659
I had to get his Dad arrested
 for raping me, just to get rid
            of him.

277
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,627
So he deserved it.

278
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,363
Oh, he didn't touch me.

279
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,436
When I was 15, I'd set up
    dates with married guys.

280
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,471
Take pictures

281
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,207
send them to their wives.

282
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,177
*wheezes*

283
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,246
Fucking perverts.

284
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,782
I'd give a nut right now
      to be back at home.

285
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,885
Guess which one's
      gonna happen first?

286
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:16,754
Gives the old ball and chain
   a whole new meaning, huh?

287
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:21,726
You guys are fucking
     insane, you know that?

288
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,164
*diggind with a bone

289
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,599
Wait. Wait, wait. *laughs* Wait.

290
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,169
*diggind with a bone

291
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,388
Don't.

292
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,606
If Frankenstein comes back in,
   we'll all lose our fuckin'
             balls.

293
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,675
*groants*

294
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:43,814
*sand falling from skull*

295
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,488
*cutting meat*

296
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,659
*vacuum cleaner*

297
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:06,771
*knife clanking*

298
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,511
*intensive sound effect*

299
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,580
*panting*

300
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,750
Dominic

301
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:26,524
*heavy breathing*

302
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:33,564
*fridge door closes*

303
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,633
*footsteps*

304
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:46,877
*plastic crunching*

305
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,256
*squeaking chair*

306
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:01,826
*chess figure tapping*

307
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,330
Playing it safe, huh?

308
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,040
*chess figure taping*

309
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:23,948
Why did you do that?

310
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,317
I don't know.

311
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,585
You don't know.

312
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,522
But you chose to do it.

313
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,993
You see, every maneuver is a
            promise.

314
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:40,464
A promise to your next maneuver
       and your next one.

315
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:45,002
'Cause life's all about choices.
     When you got no choice

316
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,471
you got nothing.

317
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,911
You chose to be here
     with me, didn't you?

318
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:57,648
Dominic.

319
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,522
*chair sqeaking*

320
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,891
Dominic.

321
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:10,594
I'm asking you a question.

322
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:12,897
*object push*

323
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,999
*shouting* Answer me!

324
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:19,337
*coughs*

325
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,577
*running water*

326
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,448
*running*

327
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,516
*lock opening*

00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,888
*wood scraping*

329
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,856
Ugh!

330
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,960
*panting*

331
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,964
*running

332
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:58,642
*shouts*

333
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:06,117
Your mother and father are scum.
      They abandoned you.

334
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,020
If they cared about you, they'd
have come looking for you now,
        wouldn't they?

335
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:14,759
I'm your father now.

336
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,665
*bottles clinking*

337
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:26,570
*fridge door closes*

338
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:31,942
*dramatic music plays*

00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,682
*insect noises*

347
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,798
I need to tell you a secret.

348
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,540
This is the world that
      left you for dead.

349
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,910
*clock ticking*

350
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:42,847
But ours isn't a strange
      world, is it, son?

351
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:47,151
*clock ticking*

352
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:52,022
I'll never let anyone
        hurt you again.

353
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,666
Promise you'll never leave me.

354
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,869
Yes, father.

355
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:07,505
And you'll grow big and strong?

356
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,906
I promise.

357
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,242
Show me.

358
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,144
*footsteps*

359
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:19,016
Grow big and strong,
        just like him.

360
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,953
*laughs*

361
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:25,022
*metal branding*

362
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:30,794

*footsteps*

365
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,877
It's beautiful.

366
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,880
*coughs*

367
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,949
*footsteps*

368
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,858
We're just like each other

369
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,927
one and the same.

*knife pull*

371
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,607
Not all of us are kind.

372
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:20,244
Some of us need to have
   the evil taken out of us.

373
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,313
Does that mean you're evil too?

374
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:26,067
Yeah.

375
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:29,253
See, sometimes, we do bad things
and the only way to take the bad
      out is through pain.

376
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,791
I want you to stab it.

377
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,226
Remove the evil.

378
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:40,965
It's what's gonna make you a
         man, Dominic.

379
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,766
Healing through pain.

380
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,802
*dramatic music plays*

381
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:49,073
I promise. I'm not
       gonna punish you.

382
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:51,075

*grunts*

385
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,248
Oh, that's it.

386
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,250
That's it.

387
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:04,989
Oh, good boy. Huh? That
     wasn't so bad, was it?

388
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,191
Huh?

389
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,327
Watch the evil, huh?

390
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,796
Watch it leave me.

391
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:17,234
*lightbulb buzzing*

392
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,711
Oh, you...

393
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:30,381
You motherfucker.

394
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,050
What? What is it?

395
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:36,253
Oh, come on, then,
      you fucking pussy.

396
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:38,055
You enjoy watching--

397
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,057
*electricity noises*

398
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,692
Have you never noticed this?

399
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:44,361
Shut the fuck up for our sakes.

400
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,063
What are you hiding from?

401
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:49,933
I'm married, you prick.
     I have a fucking life.

402
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:50,868
*eerie music plays*

 for you, you fucking asshole!

407
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,314
Jay ,please, Adam's right.

408
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:38,982
*shouting* Come on, film this!

409

*lights going out*

410
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,486
Great.

411
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:45,456
Great, thank you.
       Thank you so much!

424
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,079
My wife, my daughters.

425
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,781
Hey!

426
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,315
My wife and my daughters.

427
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:47,851
Are they alright?

428
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,024
Does that mean they're okay?

429
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,363

Don't.

434
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,122
You gotta let him, man.

435
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:27,391
Or he'll go for our families.

436
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:30,060

Jay, you have to do what he
             says.

*knife clanking on the ground*

445
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,510

What are you looking at?

489
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:58,728
Nothing.

490
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:00,797
Bring it here.

492
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:13,677
Who did that?

493
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,549
Doesn't matter.

494
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,220
Why?

495
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,554
I said it doesn't matter.

496
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:26,389
Sit down.

497
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,558
How come it doesn't matter?

498
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,393

499
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,599

00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:17,207
Paul tried that. You
      wanna be like him?

Grass greener on the other side

Is there a way out?

525
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:02,879
Oh, so we didn't suffer for
        nothing. Great.

526
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:07,350
We can escape.

He's just pissed you're back.

532
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,631
Why is everything a
      fucking joke to you?

533

Why doesn't he just kill us?

539

557
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,058

558
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,927

559
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,196
*hammer hitting nails hard*

560
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:36,433
*heavy breathing*

561
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:45,875
*hammer hitting nails hard*

562
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,784
*chains clanking*

563
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,992
*cell door closes*

564
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:06,095
I can't fucking take
         this anymore.

565
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,665
*country music plays*

566
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:15,905
*birds singning*

567
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:28,084
*kisses*

568
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:31,955
Never leave me.

569
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,626
*sighs*

570
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:40,563
*screams*

571
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:51,808
I can't feel my arms!

572
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,744
*sobs*

573
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:58,982
*panting*

574
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:05,855
*screams*

575
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:13,062
*groans*

576
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:19,068
*screams*

577
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,244
*groans*

578
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:32,549
God!

579
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:38,021
*screams*

580
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:43,126
*moans*

581
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:53,102
*light buzzes*

582
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:58,908
*cell door opens*

583
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,910
Come on! Get up!

584
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,245
Huh?

585
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,346
Come on!

586
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:04,213
*chains clinking*
           Come on!

587
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:06,215
*chains clinking*

588
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:09,252
You promised you were
gonna spent more time with us...

589
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:10,920
Jay!

590
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,505
Hey.

591
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,089
Jay! You've gotta
         stay with us.

592
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:20,763
*panting*

593
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,100
*wheezes*

594
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,138
You guys ever seen his face?

595
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,907
Oh yeah, he's gorgeous.

596
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,809
No. We haven't.

597
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:34,877
*wheezes*

598
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:37,947
So what's the freak hiding?

599
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,817
I don't know. Probably just
            ugly.
     Never kissed a girl.

600
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,769
No, specifics.

601
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,720
Come on, you guys have clapped
   eyes on him more than me.

602
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:45,855
He stinks.

603
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:48,157
Yeah. We all stink.

604
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:48,858
More.

605
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,059
*moans*

606
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:51,127
He doesn't speak.

607
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,228
Right. More.

608
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,297
Paul, shut the fuck up.

609
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,873
What was that?

610
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:04,974
Just leave him be.

611
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,776
Schh!

612
00:44:06,778 --> 00:44:08,778
He's trying to speak.

613
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,680
*wheezes*

614
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,954
Paul, what?

615
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,956
*wheezes*

616
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,796
*mumbles* Horse-

617
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,334
Horse, what?

618
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,403
*moans*

619
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:36,439
What are you trying to say?

620
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:39,876
*wheezes*

621
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,318
Paul?

622
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:56,225
Horseshoe.

623
00:44:57,696 --> 00:44:59,195
He has a

624
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:02,298
a horseshoe burn on his hand.

625
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,702
I saw it when you
      tore his glove off.

626
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,737
Oh my god.

627
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:10,907
Paul was trying to tell us.

628
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:15,078
There's spiders. Worms next?

629
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:19,182
I know you.

630
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:24,754
I fucking know you.

631
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:28,257
*eerie music plays*

632
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:30,326
After the farmer's wife died

633
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:32,962
he went crazy.

634
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,899
Started wearing a pig skin mask.

635
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,469
Locked his kid in the old
          farmhouse.

636
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:42,038
Didn't let him out of his sight.

637
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,841
Made him eat the pigs alive

638
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,211
and then one night,

639
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,213
when the sky was at its blackest

640
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:55,084
the old man sharpened his axe
until it was ripe for scalping.

641
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,853
The kid was hiding.

642
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:59,522
All he could hear were his
           footsteps.

643
00:45:59,524 --> 00:46:03,126
Louder and louder, closer and
            closer.

644
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:04,527
*sighs*

645
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,863
Police found what was left of
            the kid

646
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:08,931
in the scalding chamber.

647
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,234
Skinless.

648
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:16,239
And they say the farmer
    still stalks these woods

649
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:19,475
looking for his next victim...

650
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:22,378
*laughs*

651
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:25,248
It's not true.

652
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,317
Is so. Creepy farmer.

653
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,786
Stuff of legend.

654
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:32,255
I'd kill that crazy freak.

655
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:33,556
*burning fireplace*

656
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:36,058
I don't think I could.

657
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,093
Think about it.

658
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,563
Actually ending a dude's life.

659
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,834
Let's go find the farmhouse.

660
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:46,903
*burning fireplace*

661
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,808
What's that?

662
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:01,484
*cracking coming from the wood*á

663
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:08,991
*gasps* Shit!

664
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:13,863
*running*

665
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,332
*panting*

666
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,601
Kat, Kat, come on. Kat.

667
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:21,938
*screams*

668
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:29,478
Dominic, the boy.

669
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,280
What the fuck are
       you talking about?

670
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:32,849
The traveller, Kat.

671
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:36,586
The one with the horseshoe
burned on the back of his hand.

672
00:47:36,588 --> 00:47:39,322
It was my family summer
           vacation.

673
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:41,624
Holy shit.

674
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:47,530
*footsteps*

675
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,333
Hey. He's still following us.

676
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:54,503
*footsteps*

677
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,274
Hey, what's that scar?

678
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:03,412
Whoa.

679
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:04,547
Looks like a wiener.

680
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,416
*laughs* Yeah.

681
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,284
Wiener fingers doesn't
      say much, does he?

682
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:11,921
Say Adam's a fucking asshole.

683
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:16,525
Adam's a fucking asshole.

684
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,594
*laughs*

685
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:20,897
So. Horseshoe.

686
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,899
You wanna hang with us?

687
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:27,403
*footsteps*

688
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,471
You could replace .

689
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:30,473
*shouting* Yah!

690
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:32,541
*laughs*

691
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,444
What's your name?

692
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:39,181
Dominic.

693
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:41,150
Well, you can be in our gang.

694
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:42,585
*running water*

695
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,654
Just needs to pass the dare.

696
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:49,558
*crickets*

697
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:54,297
*gasps*

698
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,969
*panic breathing*

699
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,616
*screams*

700
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,521
*mumbling*

701
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:19,422
Stop.

702
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:25,628
*whimpers*

703
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:32,234
Oh shit! Did you swallow that?

704
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:34,403
Ugh.

705
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:48,551
*whimpers*

706
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:58,995
*screams*

707
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:07,737
*running*

708
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:11,140
*panting*

709
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:27,423
*footsteps*

710
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:37,066
You do wanna be in
       our gang, right?

711
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:42,138
*footsteps*

712
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,248
*hammering nails*

713
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,316
*panic breathing*

714
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:14,470
*whimpers*

715
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,640
Don't let them
        get in your eye.

716
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:19,642
They'll eat your brain.

717
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:21,710
*groans*

718
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:26,115
Actually, let's leave him.

719
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:28,150
*eerie music plays*

720
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,286
Leave him?

721
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:33,155
*footsteps*

722
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:42,364
Oh, fuck.

723
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:44,400
We left him in that
       creepy farmhouse.

724
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:49,271
He's done all this 'cause he was
in some house for a moment? Come
              on.

725
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:51,140
It was more than a moment.

726
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:54,877
I don't wanna him back here,
okay, he can stay out for ever!

727
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:56,496
*scremas*

728
00:51:56,497 --> 00:51:58,114
Get, boy. You get
       before I beat you!

729
00:51:58,116 --> 00:52:04,286
Stop it! No, don't say
      that! Stop it! No!

730
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,654
What you say to me?

731
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:08,791
*screams & cries*

732
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:12,361
*footsteps*

733
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:19,535
Someone's in trouble.

734
00:52:21,339 --> 00:52:25,541
*chimes clanking*

735
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:31,514
I did it after they
         shot my horse.

736
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:34,550
*chimes clanking*

737
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:36,619
He was my best friend.

738
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:40,823
I've got something really
       cool to show you.

739
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,591
Don't worry, it's just us.

740
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:53,769
*chimes clanking*

741
00:53:03,948 --> 00:53:08,651
*footsteps*

742
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:20,596
I'm sorry but...

743
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:22,464
this really is the final dare.

744
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:26,835
Look, all you have to
     do is just go inside.

745
00:53:27,605 --> 00:53:28,971
I'll kiss if you do it.

746
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:32,274
Show us how brave you
    travel kids really are.

747
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:36,779
You wanna kiss me, right?
        Then go inside.

748
00:53:36,781 --> 00:53:37,746
20 minutes.

749
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,748
Make it 20 years.

750
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,817
*laughs*

751
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:46,789
*footsteps*

752
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,602
*door opens*

753
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:02,004
No wait!

754
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:03,872
*door slams*

755
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,307
Shit!

756
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,376
*running*

757
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:16,785
*screams*

758
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:18,854
I went home that afternoon.

759
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,758
I never thought I'd
      see you guys again.

760
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,695
Did anyone see
      him after? The kid?

761
00:54:26,697 --> 00:54:28,831
My mom. She said ..

762
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:30,866
don't go into
        that farmhouse.

763
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:32,601
She'd known I was there.

764
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,470
What month were
        we at the camp?

765
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,605
My thirteenth birthday.

766
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:37,873
August 25th.

767
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,975
I had that big
       meeting tomorrow.

768
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:42,278
It was the 24th.

769
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:44,580
That's 20 years.

770
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:46,749
We were kids, we didn't
        know any better.

771
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,285
Neither does he.

772
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:51,920
*sub bass drop*

773
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,989
*crickets*

774
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,894

775
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:18,881
*eerie music plays*

776
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,865
*footsteps*

777
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:40,069
*hammer slam*

778
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:41,570
Why aren't you working?

779
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:44,340
I heard a noise.

780
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:46,342
Bullshit.

781
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:48,777
*whimpers*

782
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,916
No!

783
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,020
*leaves crunching*

784
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:00,022
Ahh!

785
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,892
*coughs*

786
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:04,893
Oh sorry.

787
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:06,929
*coughs*

788
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,532
Get back to work.

789
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,601
*footsteps*

790
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:14,603
*door squeaking*

791
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:16,605
*door slam*

792
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:30,853
*wall scraping*

793
00:56:38,629 --> 00:56:39,828
*door closing*

794
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:43,966
*footsteps*

795
00:56:53,177 --> 00:56:54,910
*wood breaking*

796
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:00,682

797
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:04,820
*door slamming*

798
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:12,127
*footsteps*

799
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:20,569
*glass breaking*

800
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:22,571
*door opens*

801
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:29,044
*door squeaking & closing*

802
00:57:31,582 --> 00:57:36,452
*papers shuffles

803
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:39,021
*footsteps*

804
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,704
*papers shuffles

805
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:05,047
*dramatic music plays*

806
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:08,984
*papers shuffles

807
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:24,032
*paper & metal clanking*

808
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:26,235
*door opens*

809
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:30,606
*panic breathing*

810
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:32,708
How dare you?

811
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:33,809
*grunts*

812
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:34,576
Okay.

813
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:39,047
Ahh!

814
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:48,624
*footsteps*

815
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:51,026
*panting*

816
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:56,031
Ahh! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

817
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,065
Ah!

818
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:00,869
*grunts*

819
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,805
No, don't! You, you had a son.

820
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:07,609
Henry. Are you gonna kill me

821
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:09,211
just like you killed him?

822
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:13,482
I didn't kill him.

823
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,184
It was an accident in the
           scalding
   chamber, he wasn't strong
            enough.

824
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:18,954
You took me to replace him.

825
00:59:19,823 --> 00:59:21,490
Didn't you?

826
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,158
I just wanted you to
       be stronger, huh?

827
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:25,160
I hate you.

828
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:29,197
You wouldn't last five minutes
     out there without me.

829
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,135
No one loves you like I do.

830
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:36,672
*eerie music plays*

831
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:38,740
How do you love me?

832
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,044
That scum outside?

833
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:45,881
They're burning marks in your
            skin.
      Leaving you to rot.

834
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:48,350
Well, surely they're a
     better scum than you.

835
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,321
*body hits*

836
00:59:54,358 --> 00:59:57,993
*body dragged on floor*

837
00:59:57,995 --> 01:00:02,230

838
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:06,768

01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,204
*engine ignition*

840
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,276
*thud*

841
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:19,247
*eerie music plays*

842
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:32,160
I'm sorry.

843
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:34,730
I didn't mean
      what I said before.

844
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:37,399
No wonder no one
     came looking for you.

845
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,771
*chains clanking*

846
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:47,676
What are you doing?
  Wait! Wait! No, stop! Stop!

847
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:49,711
How can I let you live?

848
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:51,680
A fraud in Henry's home.

849
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:53,649
Please, please don't,
         please don't!

850
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:54,950
Ahh! Ahh!

851
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,952
Oh god, oh, stop!

852
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,988
Tried to remove the evil ..

853
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,289
to make you strong!

854
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,759
No! Oh god, please!
       Please, please no!

855
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,861
Father, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

856
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:07,863
But it doesn't leave everyone.

857
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:10,699
*panting*

858
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:13,101
Sorry, please! Let me go!

859
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:14,703
No, no, no!

860
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:18,707
Agh! Please no, stop!
        Ah! Oh god! Ah!

861
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:21,076
*coughs*

862
01:01:21,078 --> 01:01:23,278

01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,852

870
01:01:58,382 --> 01:01:59,448
Henry.

871
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:01,416
It's Dominic.

872
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:05,353
My parents were
        looking for me.

873
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:07,756
You burned them alive.

874
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:10,892
*liquid bubbling*

875
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,762
I love you, son.

876
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:16,498
You already killed your son.

877
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,767
*chains clanking*

878
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:24,806
Ah! Oh, oh!

879
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:29,511
*scremas*

880
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:33,315
*body burning in liquid*

881
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:42,324

01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,247
I need to tell ya a secret.

886
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:10,418
The only way you'll ever truly
 be free is if you find them.

887
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,255
Those that abandoned you.

888
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:18,393
When you're big and strong,
  no matter how long it takes

889
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:24,099
no matter how hard you look,
     bring them back here

890
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:26,968
and let the evil out.

891
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,972

*footsteps*

896
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:56,198
We need to apologize.

897
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,866
For what?

898
01:03:57,868 --> 01:04:00,035
We only knew each other
       two fucking days.

899
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:01,069
At most.

900
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:03,522
Think about it.

901
01:04:03,523 --> 01:04:05,974
When kids get bullied, who do
they want to like 'em more than
         anyone else?

902
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:07,375
*laughs*

903
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:09,511
What a nicer place to make
            friends.

904
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,079
Ah, think about it.

905
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:13,315
If we can tap into even just a

906
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:17,385
chink of humanity in that fucked
        up head of his.

907
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:19,087
And do what? Just let us go?

908
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:20,322
Better the devil you know.

909
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:21,056
Exactly.

910
01:04:21,058 --> 01:04:22,390
Jesus Christ.

911
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,392
Fuck you, I'm getting outta
             here.

912
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:26,995
*chains clanking*

913
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:30,532
Alright. Huh. Dominic.

914
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:37,138
*shouting* Dominic!

915
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:39,541
*shouting* Dominic!

No.

925
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:14,676
Dominic.

926
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:16,578
Now we know who you are.

927
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:19,481
And we know what we did.

928
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:24,552
It was wrong to leave you.

929
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:29,925
Now, I can't claim to know or...

930
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,293
or where to understand

931
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:32,961
I can't.

932
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,628
What you've been going
      through in the past

01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:37,032
the past 20 years.

934
01:05:38,669 --> 01:05:40,235
What I do know

935
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:43,038
is that each one of us

936
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:44,506
is sorry.

937
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:45,440
*snarls* Huh?

938
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:48,610
We're so sorry.

939
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:54,416
We wanna get out of here, we do,
             man.
 We wanna get out of here with
              you.

952
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:27,615

1039
01:11:57,447 --> 01:12:00,682
Look at you. A girl wouldn't
  kiss you to save her life.

1040
01:12:00,684 --> 01:12:04,385
You're nothing but
       a waste of skin.

1041
01:12:04,387 --> 01:12:08,556
Leaving you was the best thing
we ever fucking did, you fucking

No one will ever love you.

1045

All you have to do
      is just go inside.

1047
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,571
Your mother and father are scum.
     They abandoned you....

1048
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:26,341
I'm your father now.

01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,734
Oh shit, you gotta
         pull it out!

1060
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:53,434

I'm not gonna let you die, I'm
  not gonna let you die. Wait,
           bite down.

1065
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,578
Right down. Hold him down.

1066

Alright this it okay, he's

1084
01:14:28,031 --> 01:14:29,230
We've got nothing to lose.

1085
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:31,098
Just one other fucking eye.

1086
01:14:31,835 --> 01:14:34,535
Oh, he's gonna kill me.

1087
01:14:34,537 --> 01:14:38,940
Oh god, it's fine, you're
     gonna fucking kill me.

1088
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:44,812
It's best you hand over the

   I need it more than you.

You're braver than me.

No one's gonna get hurt anymore.

Kat, it's not your fault.

1108
01:15:54,584 --> 01:15:57,118
Kat, repeat after me,
     "It wasn't my fault."

1109
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:02,290
Maybe it was my fault.

1110
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:04,158
All of it.

1111
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:06,961
I never went back.

1112
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:10,565
I never checked to
      see if he was okay.

1113
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:14,869
After you left, the police came.

1114
01:16:14,871 --> 01:16:18,906
Asking all kinds of shit
     about a missing boy.

1115
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:21,576
And you know what I told them?

1116
01:16:21,578 --> 01:16:24,211
Fucking zero.

1117
01:16:24,213 --> 01:16:26,814
All this time you knew?

1118
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:28,616
20 years.

1119
01:16:28,618 --> 01:16:32,219
20 fucking years I held onto
    this shit and for what?

1120
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,356
You left him too.

1121
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:38,993
You could have saved him.

1122
01:16:38,995 --> 01:16:42,196
You could have told someone.

1123
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,700
You could have stopped this.

1124
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:49,070
*panic breathing*

1125
01:16:49,072 --> 01:16:50,204
Let her go.

1126
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:53,374
We just wanna go home.

1127
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:56,043
I returned to your world after.

1128
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:02,216
Still no family.

1129
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:04,051
You're a good kid, Dominic.

1130
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:07,288
No. I was still unwanted.

1131
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,290
An orphan.

1132
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:14,161
Came back here.
     The farmer was right.

1133
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:15,896
You are all scum!

1134
01:17:15,898 --> 01:17:17,131
You were my friend.

1135
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:17,999
No.

1136
01:17:18,935 --> 01:17:20,234
You abandoned me.

1137
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:22,737
Left me for dead.

1138
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:26,774
*panting*

1139
01:17:26,776 --> 01:17:28,776
Why don't you let
       me see that face?

1140
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:31,178
*whimpers*

1141
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:38,019
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1142
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:40,755
Let me see, my friend.

1143
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:45,259
*soft breathing*

1144
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:51,165
*whimpers*

1145
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:00,307
See that wasn't so hard.

1146
01:18:02,412 --> 01:18:06,447
I would have come and rescued
 you if I'd known what you were
         going through.

1147
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:10,317
*soft breathing*

1148
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:15,389
*sobs*

1149
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:32,473
Ahh!

1150

1154
01:19:16,853 --> 01:19:19,920
*gasps*

1155
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,155
I failed.

1156
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:26,227
The evil never left you.

1157
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:28,796
*knife clanking*

1158
01:19:35,171 --> 01:19:38,339
*gasps*

1159
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:40,341
Kill me.

She'll suffer worse than you.

1259

1298
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:18,485
*coughs*

1299
01:29:19,988 --> 01:29:21,488
*snow hits body*

1300
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:22,055
*laughs*

1301
01:29:29,631 --> 01:29:31,565
*kisses*

1302
01:29:33,502 --> 01:29:35,736
Dad would kill us if
     he knew we were here.

1303
01:29:36,672 --> 01:29:37,537
Dude...

1304
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:39,239
*sighs*

1305
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,940
Dad will never know.
Besides, the freak's long gone.

1306
01:29:40,943 --> 01:29:43,543
D-E-A-D. Fucked.

1307
01:29:44,413 --> 01:29:46,180
I hate dares.

1308
01:29:46,181 --> 01:29:47,948
Well then, you should
   have chosen truth instead.

1309
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:52,119
And you and Isaac could have
            stayed
   at home like little virgin
          snowflakes.

1310
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:55,722
*laughs*

1311
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,724
Is it really the same forest?

1312
01:29:57,726 --> 01:30:00,160
Yeah. Not far from here.

1313
01:30:00,162 --> 01:30:01,795
Your dad kicked his ass, right?

1314
01:30:01,797 --> 01:30:05,432
Hells, yeah. Ten years ago
            tonight.

1315
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:07,667
No, I get it.

1316
01:30:07,669 --> 01:30:10,404
*fireplace burning*

1317
01:30:10,406 --> 01:30:12,472
Freak fed him cockroaches.

1318
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:15,409
Made them slice each other.

1319
01:30:15,411 --> 01:30:17,110
Nailed them to the wall.

1320
01:30:17,112 --> 01:30:20,547
He even kept their skin.

1321
01:30:21,683 --> 01:30:23,483
But that's not all.

1322
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:26,820
Dude, pinned one of the
     prisoners down and...

1323
01:30:26,822 --> 01:30:28,755
Got him with the worms!

1324
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:29,189
*laughs*

1325
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:31,691
Poppy! Oh.

1326
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:34,461
*laughs*

1327
01:30:35,831 --> 01:30:36,863
So.

1328
01:30:36,865 --> 01:30:40,167
Who's coming with me to find the
           farmhouse?

1329
01:30:40,169 --> 01:30:41,001
Yeah, I'm game.

1330
01:30:41,003 --> 01:30:41,868
Yeah?

1331
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:43,537
No, no way.

1332
01:30:43,539 --> 01:30:45,539
You know they never found a
             body.

1333
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:46,440
What?

1334
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:47,974
Oh shit.

1335
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:50,911
Yo.

1336
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:53,747
I'm gonna go grab my
     gloves from the car.

1337
01:30:53,749 --> 01:30:55,482
It's freezing out here, man.

1338
01:30:55,484 --> 01:30:57,551
*footseps*

1339
01:30:58,654 --> 01:31:00,487

*fireplace burning*

1341
01:31:06,061 --> 01:31:08,228
Yo. Fuck this, come on guys.

1342
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:13,233
Come on, I'll, I'll bring
        the car around.

1343
01:31:13,235 --> 01:31:19,072
*footsteps*

1344
01:31:19,074 --> 01:31:21,475
We should go.

1345
01:31:21,477 --> 01:31:24,578
*fireplace burning*

1346
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,146
Pussies.

1347
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:29,082
Poppy, come on!

1348
01:31:30,953 --> 01:31:39,759
*eerie music plays*

1349
01:31:39,761 --> 01:31:43,997
