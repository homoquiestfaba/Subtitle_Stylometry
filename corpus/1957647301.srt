-What?

522
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,259
You can't call her either,
Jimmy, she'll have to call you.

523
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,391
Cases like this can drag on
for years.

524
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,611
Now, I want the same deal
I got in the divorce,

525
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:59,134
every weekend.

526
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,396
What you ask is impossible,
I'm sorry.

527
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:02,094
I'm not the criminal here!

528
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:03,356
Jimmy, take it easy,
take it easy.

529
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,404
I don't think
we've fully explored, uh,

530
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,319
my client's options.

531
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:13,975
JIMMY: You were a big help.

532
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:16,021
Did you see that Van Zandt guy?
He's like dry ice.

533
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:19,415
I want you to file
for full custody.

534
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:21,200
Are you crazy?

535
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,593
Even by some stroke of luck
I beat the guy.

536
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,204
They don't have to comply
with a court order.

537
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:26,335
-You heard them.
-Do it, Vinnie.

538
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:29,948
-Congratulations.
-What for?

539
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,689
I've never had a case
solve itself.

540
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:34,169
What are you talking about?

541
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:35,605
You hired me to find her,
she's found.

542
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:36,911
-What's this?
-My bill.

543
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:38,347
We're not through yet.

544
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:56,365
Mr. Scranton?
I believe this is yours.

545
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,586
What's this?

546
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,327
It's a court order
to produce Jenny O'Meara

547
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:02,719
for a hearing in seven days.

548
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,463
I don't have to accept this.

549
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:09,944
The law says you do.

550
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,819
[♪♪♪♪♪]

551
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:46,415
Hey, you.

552
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:50,637
I missed you.

553
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:52,508
JENNY: I missed you, too, Daddy.

554
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:54,423
Come here.

555
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:03,519
Can we have a couple
of minutes alone?

556
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:05,739
Absolutely not,
I have to supervise.

557
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,181
I wanna come visit you.

558
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:16,445
They said I can't talk
about where we live.

559
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:21,450
How about school?

560
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,935
Can I take a picture at least?

561
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,680
VINCENT: Your Honor,
by not notifying Mr. O'Meara

562
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:35,986
the moment that they placed
his child in the program,

563
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,207
the government infringed on his
relationship with his daughter.

564
00:34:40,904 --> 00:34:43,037
My client, therefore,
is asking that full custody

565
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:44,125
revert back to him.

566
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:45,300
May I, Your Honor?

567
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,261
The last thing
the US Attorney's office wants

568
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:50,653
is to stand
between parent and child.

569
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:52,742
We have offered Mr. O'Meara
a concession.

570
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,267
They've offered him
one visit per month.

571
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,879
The divorce agreement
was loosely worded,

572
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:00,359
as Mr. Infante knows.

573
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:01,969
He negotiated it.

574
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,886
We simply cannot afford to move
Mr. O'Meara, his ex-wife

575
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,193
and his daughter,
and two Marshall escorts.

576
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,673
In this particular situation,
it would also impeach

577
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:12,501
the security of the Witness
Protection Program.

578
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:15,722
I've heard about all I need
to hear today.

579
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,333
I am going to continue
this case,

580
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,596
pending home
and psychiatric evaluations.

581
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,556
The social worker
was over my house.

582
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,166
Went through my closets.

583
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:27,864
Asked me if I watched
adult tapes.

584
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:29,431
That sounds like
a social worker.

585
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:31,477
I had the shrink on Wednesday.

586
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:34,523
I keep seeing Jenny's face
in that courtroom.

587
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:37,265
She was frightened, you know.

588
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:39,659
I hate to put her through that.
It makes me sick.

589
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,574
I told the shrink that.

590
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:43,837
Piece of advice?

591
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,144
Get a new lawyer.

592
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:47,884
Vinnie's not very good, is he?

593
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:49,538
I wanna see you win.

594
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,802
JUDGE POWERS: I am going to take 
this case under advisement.

595
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,327
The participants
will be notified

596
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:56,676
when I have reached my decision.

597
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:58,547
All rise!

598
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:04,074
JIMMY: This guy looks like
he's got one foot

599
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:05,424
-in the grave.
-VINNIE: Don't say that, please.

600
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:07,208
-Why not?
-I'm superstitious.

601
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:09,123
What does that mean
under advisement?

602
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,473
Now he's got the reports
from the social worker

603
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:12,909
and the psychiatrist.

604
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:14,737
He'll make up his mind,
that's it.

605
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,609
-But how long?
-I don't know, a week.

606
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:20,395
I don't know, maybe longer,
I don't know how long.

607
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:23,268
JIMMY: You're killing me,
Vinnie, it's taking forever.

608
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:24,312
VINCENT: Look what
I'm up against.

609
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,923
Every two weeks,
regular as clockwork,

610
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:28,534
I get papered by Van Zandt.

611
00:36:29,012 --> 00:36:30,971
He's got a staff that thinks up
ways to make my life miserable.

612
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:34,627
New interrogatories,
amended actions.

613
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:36,368
He wants to depose your mother.

614
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,370
Every stalling tactic
in the book.

615
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,199
So, he thinks I'm gonna win.

616
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:42,678
No, that's not it at all.

617
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,027
You're a pain in the butt.

618
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,595
They want to exhaust us.
Economically and emotionally.

619
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:47,988
And you wanna know
something, Jimmy?

620
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:50,164
It's working,
this case is killing me.

621
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:52,035
My practice
is significantly off.

622
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:56,388
We gotta bite, come on.

623
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:04,439
-ALL: Trick or treat!
-Hey. There you go.

624
00:37:04,787 --> 00:37:06,398
Don't eat too much at once,
all right?

625
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:07,660
All right.

626
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:08,965
All right, good night.

627
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:10,140
ALL: Good night.

628
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,099
Be careful, now.

629
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:15,450
Take the deal, Jimmy.

630
00:37:16,582 --> 00:37:17,583
Go see Jenny.

631
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:20,673
Once a month is better than
what you got now.

632
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:25,199
The longer he mixes it up
with the feds,

633
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:27,419
the more scrambled
his brains become.

634
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:29,769
Yeah, well,
put yourself in his shoes.

635
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:32,772
I have, but he has
a business, too.

636
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,904
He forgot to sign the check
for the beer distributor

637
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,428
and they put us on the list.

638
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:39,300
I had to go to the grocery store
to buy vodka for the bar.

639
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:42,477
That's illegal,
my butt, his license.

640
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:45,350
He doesn't know where
the quarterly tax forms are.

641
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:48,483
I mean,
if he loses this place...

642
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:52,487
Why don't you just talk to me
like you were here?

he loves me.

he loved them, too.

Well, stay away
from fickle boys.

Halloween, she dressed up
like a ballerina.

Little girls love to dress up,
like, something pretty.

664
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:48,717
Last year,
she was an Indian princess.

-Let's dance.
-No.

-Come on.
-No, I forgot how.

you've heard.

Judge Powers has retired
from the bench, his health.

675
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,232

could have settled this.

I'm in a war here.

And if my agenda means
protecting a small fish

678
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:16,152
like DeSantos in order to take
hardcore criminals

and their drugs off the streets,
I'm going to do it.

That's reality, Jimmy.

681
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:20,896

You're gonna do this to me

You're gonna find another judge.

I see a lot in you that I like,
you're beautiful.

1212
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:13,324
You're courageous.

1213
01:17:14,368 --> 01:17:15,500
And I feel like
you're my friend.

1214
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:17,850

1217
01:17:26,903 --> 01:17:28,252
Remember that quarterly
tax payment?

1218
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:30,036
You forgot, didn't you?

1221
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,481
I've been ordered to audit
your business records,
Mr. O'Meara.

1222
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:42,048
This is harassment.

1223
01:17:45,008 --> 01:17:46,531
You know what?
Go ahead.

1224
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:47,750

You want to use my office?

Use my office.

01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,188
You tell Van Zandt
if this is his best shot,

1227
01:17:51,362 --> 01:17:52,624
-he's in trouble.
-Yeah.

1228
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:55,061
That is good news, Harrison.

1229
01:17:57,368 --> 01:17:59,022
You're going to have
your day in court, Jimmy.

1230
01:17:59,892 --> 01:18:02,025
Judge Manuel Ruiz
will hear your case.

1231
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,332
Says here, you're going
to subpoena Vincent Infante.

1232
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:08,422
Yeah, you got a problem
with that?

1233
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,381
No.

1234
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:11,948
Okay.

1235
01:18:13,427 --> 01:18:15,081
Let's get ready to rumble.

1236
01:18:18,519 --> 01:18:20,347
It is not our intention
to impede the relationship

1237
01:18:20,521 --> 01:18:21,740
between a father and a daughter.

1238
01:18:22,436 --> 01:18:24,177
No more than it is
to deny due process

1239
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:25,352
or Constitutional rights.

1240
01:18:26,179 --> 01:18:28,355
Simply put,
this is not a simple case.

1241
01:18:29,966 --> 01:18:31,663
The issue is the custody
of Jenny O'Meara.

1242
01:18:33,099 --> 01:18:35,014
What we asking Your Honor
to answer for us

1243
01:18:35,188 --> 01:18:36,929
is one of the oldest questions
in law.

1244
01:18:38,104 --> 01:18:39,323
Is the right of the citizen

1245
01:18:39,497 --> 01:18:40,367
greater than the right
of society?

1246
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:44,937
It is common in jurisdictions
all over the country

1247
01:18:45,808 --> 01:18:47,418
to grant immunity and protection

1248
01:18:48,419 --> 01:18:49,812
in order to prosecute
a greater menace.

1249
01:18:50,464 --> 01:18:51,378
Mr. O'Meara's case

1250
01:18:52,815 --> 01:18:54,077
makes a direct assault
on that policy.

1251
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:57,471
In order to prosecute
this war,

1252
01:18:58,298 --> 01:19:00,126
society demands
swift and reasoned action.

1253
01:19:03,303 --> 01:19:04,391
My heart goes out
to Mr. O'Meara.

1254
01:19:06,959 --> 01:19:08,613
But it also goes out
to all those other parents

1255
01:19:08,787 --> 01:19:10,876
in this country, whose only hope

1256
01:19:11,485 --> 01:19:13,009
is for us to put away
the vermin

1257
01:19:13,183 --> 01:19:14,575
who deal drugs
to their children.

1258
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,193
Would you like to address
the court, Mr. Cox?

1259
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:29,155
I thought I'd give the court
time for the smoke to clear.

1260
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,070
[LAUGHS]

1261
01:19:31,244 --> 01:19:32,724
The court will do
the editorializing,

1262
01:19:32,898 --> 01:19:33,725
Mr. Cox. Proceed.

1263
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:37,729
I'll be brief.

1264
01:19:38,948 --> 01:19:41,254
Mr. Van Zandt said one thing
that I agree with.

1265
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,867
This case is about the custody
of Jenny O'Meara.

1266
01:19:46,477 --> 01:19:48,479
We are not opposed
to protective custody,

1267
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:51,264
but we are opposed
to the abuse of authority.

1268
01:19:52,352 --> 01:19:54,441
We want to fight drugs,
and crime families,

1269
01:19:55,312 --> 01:19:57,618
but we can do it
without a callousness

1270
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,446
that isn't part
of our value system.

1271
01:20:00,839 --> 01:20:03,363
With Bobby DeSantos' help,
we were able to arrest

1272
01:20:03,537 --> 01:20:05,583
eight principles in a
60 million-dollar drug ring.

1273
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:09,195
He wore recording devices
and provided important data

1274
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:10,327
at great personal risk.

1275
01:20:12,329 --> 01:20:13,199
Thank you.

1276
01:20:17,334 --> 01:20:18,901
These were some
dangerous characters, sir,

1277
01:20:19,075 --> 01:20:20,206
-weren't they?
-BORELLI: Yes, sir.

1278
01:20:21,425 --> 01:20:22,774
Our bail must have been set
pretty high.

1279
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:24,210
Were any of these suspects
able to meet it?

1280
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:25,821
No, sir.

1281
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:29,215
In fact,
all eight plea bargained

1282
01:20:29,389 --> 01:20:30,956
and are now serving time
in federal penitentiaries,

1283
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:32,131
isn't that right?

1284
01:20:32,305 --> 01:20:33,829
BORELLI: That's correct.

1285
01:20:34,003 --> 01:20:35,831
So these dangerous criminals
haven't seen the streets

1286
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:38,007
since their arrest,
and have been no direct threat

1287
01:20:38,181 --> 01:20:39,704
to DeSantos or his family.

1288
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:41,445
Yes. But that's not the point.

1289
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:42,838
Objection, Your Honor.

1290
01:20:43,012 --> 01:20:43,795
I'm through with this witness.

When were you married?

01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,235

1293
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:52,586
Do you love your husband?

1294
01:20:55,285 --> 01:20:56,242
Yes.

1295
01:20:57,809 --> 01:20:58,592
VAN ZANDT: No further questions.

1296
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,247
Go easy on her, huh.

1297
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:03,249
VAN ZANDT: Your witness,
counselor.

1298
01:21:06,818 --> 01:21:08,124
Mrs. DeSantos,

1299
01:21:09,908 --> 01:21:11,170
when did you
and your family enter

1300
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:12,476
the Witness Protection Program?

1301
01:21:13,825 --> 01:21:14,913
September 9th.

1302
01:21:16,393 --> 01:21:18,221
Two days after
your arranged marriage

1303
01:21:18,395 --> 01:21:19,396
to a known felon.

1304
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:20,963
Object, Your Honor.

1305
01:21:21,441 --> 01:21:22,268
Sustained.

1306
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:26,359
COX: Mrs. DeSantos,
did you believe

1307
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:27,926
you would not be allowed
into the program

1308
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,014
unless you were married?

1309
01:21:29,188 --> 01:21:30,494
That's what I was told.

1310
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:38,241
COX: Let me be perfectly clear
about this.

1311
01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:39,851
Are you saying
that even if this court

1312
01:21:40,025 --> 01:21:41,287
should rule
in my client's favor,

1313
01:21:42,593 --> 01:21:44,290
you would refuse to comply
with that court order?

1314
01:21:52,168 --> 01:21:53,299
Mr. Scranton?

1315
01:21:57,303 --> 01:21:59,262
My office would not have
to accept that court order.

1316
01:22:00,132 --> 01:22:01,177
That's what I said.

1317
01:22:09,402 --> 01:22:10,316
You can't be in here!

1318
01:22:10,882 --> 01:22:11,970
Arrest me.

1319
01:22:22,633 --> 01:22:23,460
Hi.

1320
01:22:26,419 --> 01:22:27,943
-How you doing?
-Fine.

01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:31,207
[♪♪♪♪♪]

1322
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,339
-You all right?
-Yeah.

1323
01:22:38,736 --> 01:22:40,216
I just came in here
to tell you that I love you.

1324
01:22:42,174 --> 01:22:43,610
You're gonna get
in trouble, Daddy.

1325
01:22:43,915 --> 01:22:44,916
Yeah.

1326
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:49,181
Give me a hug.

1327
01:22:54,186 --> 01:22:55,361
COX: Mr. Infante.

1328
01:22:56,754 --> 01:22:58,538
You are aware that your answers
could cause you

1329
01:22:58,712 --> 01:23:00,845
to be brought before the bar
on disciplinary charges?

1330
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:03,587
Yeah.

1331
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:08,940
I was approached
by Mr. Scranton

1332
01:23:10,507 --> 01:23:13,379
who offered to send cases
my way...

1333
01:23:16,295 --> 01:23:17,949
if I would stall Jimmy's case.

1334
01:23:19,864 --> 01:23:20,647
COX: To what end?

1335
01:23:24,825 --> 01:23:26,740
They thought they could make
Jimmy go away.

1336
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:31,963
And did you stall?

1337
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:39,188
Yeah.

1338
01:23:46,543 --> 01:23:49,459
Mr. O'Meara's
living arrangement is wholesome.

1339
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:51,983
More than adequate
to raise his daughter.

1340
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:55,726
I was sent by the court
in my capacity as a psychiatrist

1341
01:23:56,161 --> 01:23:58,729
to evaluate Mr. O'Meara's
fitness as a parent.

1342
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,037
COX: Would you tell the court
the conclusion of your report?

1343
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:04,822
It's my opinion
that the lifestyle created

1344
01:24:04,996 --> 01:24:06,389
by the Witness Program

1345
01:24:06,737 --> 01:24:08,782
could be extremely stressful
for the daughter,

1346
01:24:09,435 --> 01:24:10,871
and that she could not
be raised normally

1347
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,395
in such an environment.

1348
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,311
I recommend that Mr. O'Meara
be given custody.

1349
01:24:15,963 --> 01:24:17,574
He never missed
a visit with her.

1350
01:24:18,749 --> 01:24:20,751
When they took her away,
Jimmy changed.

1351
01:24:22,535 --> 01:24:24,363
You could see it
in everything he did.

1352
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,539
VAN ZANDT: You don't like me,
do you, Mr. O'Meara?

1353
01:24:27,366 --> 01:24:28,280
What do you think?

1354
01:24:29,281 --> 01:24:30,456
And you've got quite a temper.

1355
01:24:33,111 --> 01:24:34,808
If you're talking about
why I hit your buddy over there,

1356
01:24:34,982 --> 01:24:36,201
I think you know.

1357
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:37,115
Have you ever hit your daughter?

1358
01:24:37,724 --> 01:24:38,856
You bastard.

1359
01:24:39,422 --> 01:24:40,684
This court won't tolerate
that language.

1360
01:24:43,426 --> 01:24:44,557
Would you direct the witness,
Your Honor?

1361
01:24:44,862 --> 01:24:45,776
Your Honor, can I say something?

1362
01:24:47,386 --> 01:24:49,040
Answer Mr. Van Zandt's question.

1363
01:24:49,997 --> 01:24:52,174
Why should I have to answer
a question like that?

1364
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,480
Because I can find you
in contempt.

1365
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,315
I have never hit my daughter.

1366
01:25:04,011 --> 01:25:06,231
Mr. Van Zandt's baiting
my client.

1367
01:25:06,536 --> 01:25:07,928
Your Honor, can I just tell you
what happened?

1368
01:25:08,364 --> 01:25:09,278
I'm not through
with my questions.

1369
01:25:09,452 --> 01:25:10,757
Mr. Van Zandt,

1370
01:25:11,628 --> 01:25:14,021
the antagonism between you
and the petitioner

1371
01:25:14,196 --> 01:25:15,284
is counterproductive.

1372
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:17,938
And your contempt for the power
of this lower court

1373
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:19,201
is evident as well.

1374
01:25:19,592 --> 01:25:21,159
-Your Honor...
-Don't "Your Honor" me.

1375
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:24,771
You know, I'm very disturbed
by Mr. Scranton's testimony

1376
01:25:24,945 --> 01:25:26,817
about not having
to abide by my ruling,

1377
01:25:27,513 --> 01:25:29,515
a position that you have
made clear that you support.

1378
01:25:32,518 --> 01:25:33,824
I am going to let
Mr. O'Meara speak.

1379
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:35,869
Then I would ask
that the record reflect

1380
01:25:36,043 --> 01:25:37,262
my continues objection.

1381
01:25:37,436 --> 01:25:38,481
I'll note your objections.

1382
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:40,047
Now sit down.

1383
