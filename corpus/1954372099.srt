I remember that day
as if it was yesterday.

00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,599
(loud explosions)

4
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,068
It was a peaceful spring...

5
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,950
here in the south of our empire.

6
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,907
The first World War
was already raging

7
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,243
for almost a year now...

8
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:47,079
hundreds of miles away
in the east.

9
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:50,249
But people were
already talking about war,

10
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:52,151
even in our mountains.

11
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:54,720
That's when I had this dream.

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:58,223
Every night... the same dream.

13
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,229
I was on top of our mountain...

14
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:10,569
opposite an Italian soldier,
a<i> wolch.</i>

15
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,109
Suddenly, the<i> wolch</i> ran at me...

16
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,112
as I pull out my rifle.

17
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,114
(loud explosion)

18
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,557
Back then, I wasn't
baffled by the dream.

19
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,689
I couldn't wait to join the war

20
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,292
and finally get away from home,

21
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,928
fight for our country...

22
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,429
against the traitors.

23
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:42,201
But then, the soldier
caught up again.

24
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:44,536
He was still alive.

25
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,538
Now, it was on me
to finish him up.

26
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,510
But when I touched the trigger,

27
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,179
I saw that he wasn't
carrying a rifle.

that my father married off
my sister Lisl to a<i> wolch.</i>

65

Most of us hated the Italians,
but now everybody

75
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,176
When I was four years old,
my father built this hotel.

76
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,811
It was an instant success.

77
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,483
People came from all parts
of the world,

78
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,985
but I hardly ever
saw my father again.

79
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,127
The more foreigners,
the more reputation

80
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,662

82
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,974
Now, it was time for my father's
most ambitious project ever,

the first mountain
tramway in our valley.

84
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,651
And how convenient
that Lisl's new husband Angelo

85
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:23,155
was the engineer he needed
to compliment his dream.

86
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,325
We did it, Angelo.

87
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,827

Your father has big plans.

Want some?

89
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,707
(Andreas)
I knew that my teacher
was secretly in love

90
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:38,270
with my sister Lisl,
and it didn't make things easier

91
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,105
that her husband was Italian.

92
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:41,947
He hated them more than anyone.

Times are changing.

I can feel it.

98
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,427
And then, your father
will be proud of you.

99
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,963
He will see
what you are made of.

All right, then, tell him
to get us some more ammunition.

385
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:11,315

we were big battalions

00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:13,851
instead of tiny platoons...

387
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:16,487

Uh, the mass grave.

Mass grave, that's right.

(chuckles)

448
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:43,620
Well, you either end up
on top of the pile

449
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:46,056
or somewhere underneath.

450
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:49,126
If you're on top,
well, then good for you.

451
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,894
But if you find
you're underneath,

452
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:53,430
you'll be left with two choices.

453
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:56,800
Either you remain
just as you are,

454
00:33:56,802 --> 00:33:59,970
or you become a tree.

455
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:02,806
If you do stay as you are,
well, good for you.

456
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,242
But if you become a tree,

457
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:07,644
you've got two choices again

458
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:10,313
because you either turn
into a leaf tree

459
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,215
or a cone tree of some kind.

460
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:15,485
If you turn into a leaf tree,
well, then good for you.

461

(chuckles)

462
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,256
But if it's a cone tree
you become,

463
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:22,759
you'll find yourself
facing two options again.

464
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:27,664
You either grow and become
a lovely piece of wood,

465
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,733
or you're stunted and you get...

466
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,301
(clicks tongue)

467
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:34,771
If you grow and turn into
a piece of wood, good for you.

468
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,940
But of course,
if you're cut down,

469
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:39,476
you'll find there's
still two choices.

470
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:42,179
You'll find you either
end up in a sawmill

471
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,748
or possibly in a paper mill.

472
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,984
If you find you're in
a saw mill, then good for you.

473
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:50,454
But if you end up
in a paper mill,

474
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:53,123
you'll find
you have two choices again.

475
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,426
You'll eventually turn into
either writing paper

476
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,329
or possibly toilet paper.

477
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,965
If you become writing paper,
good for you.

478
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,367
But if you turn
into toilet paper,

479
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:08,271
you'll end up having
your head in someone's ass.

She did the same to me, Ander.

934
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:04,224
Don't worry,
we will sort it out!

935
01:26:04,226 --> 01:26:06,393
Ander!
(screams)

936
01:26:06,395 --> 01:26:07,995
(groaning)

937
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:23,343
(Francesca screams)

938
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:26,346
(screaming and crying)
(groaning)

939
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:37,591
¶¶ (tense orchestration)

940
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:41,395
Francesca.

941
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,234
Francesca.

942
01:26:47,236 --> 01:26:49,403
(crying)

943
01:26:49,405 --> 01:26:55,409
¶¶

944
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:56,882
Not the worst place to die.

945
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:27,801
(loud explosions)

946
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:39,019
(gunshot)

947
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:52,386
(Andreas)
As the Italian soldier
came closer, he stumbled...

948
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:03,330
as if he finally found
what he was looking for,

949
01:30:03,332 --> 01:30:04,831
and it was not me.

950
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:09,503
He held the kettle and poured.

951
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:12,973
There was nothing in it.

952
01:30:12,975 --> 01:30:18,979
¶¶ (tense orchestration)

953
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:16,536
We didn't know
where we were going.

954
01:31:16,538 --> 01:31:18,538
We just knew it would
be together.

955
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:23,910
But I still dream
of the mountains...

956
01:31:23,912 --> 01:31:25,912
with no soldiers...

957
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:29,049
just mountains.

958
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:32,686
Just silence.

959
01:31:32,688 --> 01:31:35,689
(wind howling)

960
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:13,093
