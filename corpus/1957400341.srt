(man sighs heavily)

4
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,292
- What's worth fighting for?

5
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,628
What's worth letting go?

6
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:49,174
Any good story will ask
and answer these questions.

7
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,261
In this book, he
asks what are we all

8
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,555
living for if there's
nothing worth dying for.

9
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,058
(door creaking)

10
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,812
Considering when it was written,

11
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,815
this question carries
great meaning.

12
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:10,904
Ultimately,

13
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,367
it's the things we value

14
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,369
that end up defining us.

15
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,501
Get out your uh, reflection
sheets from yesterday

16
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,961
and I'll be back
in just a moment.

17
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:30,173

chattering students)

18
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:34,386

and doors rattling)

19
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,865
- Why you?

20
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,283
- [Man In Red Shirt]
Come on, Frank.

21
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,328
- As section 18 in
your contract states,

22
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:00,996
North Carolina is an
employment at will state...

23
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:01,788
- I know.

24
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,418
- Protesting and
union-like behavior

25
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,961

26
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,754

27
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,257
- You knew this would happen!

28
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,177
- It didn't have to happen.

29
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,430
Don't act like this
wasn't your decision!

30
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,307
This is you.

31
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,190
I remember sitting in this room

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,194
going on and on about all the
things I wanted to do here,

33
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,862
and the first thing
you said to me

34
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,282
was to make sure
I didn't burn out.

35
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,950
Now here we are,
eight years later,

36
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,246
and the last thing I wanna
say to you is I didn't,

37
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,873
but maybe you did.

38
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,091
(pleasant but slightly
melancholic and
reflective guitar)

39
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,582
(approaching clacking footsteps)

40
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,127
(raps on the door)

41
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,920
(door rattles open)

42
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,838
- Huh, hey!

43
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,425
How's the divorce goin'?

44
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,676
- Goin'.

45
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,303
- Gettin' a lawyer's
kind of a drag, huh?

46
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,222
- I wouldn't know,
I don't have one.

47
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,266
- Have you ever heard
of law of attraction?

48
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,851
Everything good and
bad in your life

49
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,936
you've attracted
with your thoughts.

50
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,354
At first, I thought
these people were trying

51
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,108
to start a cult or sell me on
some kind of a pyramid scheme.

52
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:57,237
By the way, don't answer
any calls from a Billy.

53
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,780
Have you started dating?

54
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,115
- I have.

55
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,868
- Liar, I saw you
in the newspaper.

56
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,664
God, I guess that Red For Ed
thing did not work out, huh?

57
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,291
- No, not enough people.

58
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,126
I guess I just need to
find something different

59
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,461
for a little while like a uh,

60
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,629
cult or a pyramid
scheme, I don't know.

61
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,840
- Well, you haven't asked
me why I've shown up.

62
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,467
I tell you it is not
to give you my sympathy

63
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:22,387
because I think you are
way better off without her.

64
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,474
It's Oskar, he's
one of my new cases.

65
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,477
You know who he is, right?

66
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,269
- No.

67
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,646
- OK, how 'bout now?

68
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,358
Her funeral is
tomorrow, Courtland.

69
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,278
Tell me you knew about this.

70
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,155
This is your family!

71
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,199
- My family?
- [Woman] Yes.

72
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,283
- [Courtland] No no no no.

73
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,244
My dad married into all
kindsa families, not me.

74
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,788
- OK, then, do me a favor.

75
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:53,084
This boy, your nephew, he would
like to meet you tomorrow.

76
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,002
So show up.

77
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,052
(Courtland sighs over
peaceful orchestral music)

78
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,264
(serene orchestral
music continues)

79
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,333
- [Courtland] I can't do it.

80
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,460
- What do you mean
you can't do it?

81
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,753
- Just stop, OK,

82
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,173
I, I can't even take
care of myself right now.

83
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,344
- Have some compassion.

84
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,930
- Compassion, wh, what
do you mean compassion?

85
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,349
I'm, I'm sorry but this kid,

86

89
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,196
I can't do this.

90
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,950
- (Scoffs) All I'm
asking is for you

91
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,743
to spend some time with
him before I have to

92
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,371
turn him into an orphan again.

93
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,458
Hello, Miss Kasin?

94
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,878
We're here to see Oskar Satori.

96
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,672
- Yeah.

97
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,467
- You know, yesterday
was the first time

98
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,720
that I heard Oskar speak,

99
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,765
and he was so excited about
meetin' his uncle Courtland.

100
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,392
Now, I don't know you,

101
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,561

Hey Oskar?

104
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,995
This is Courtland and Sophie.

105
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,496
You remember her?

00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,627
They're here to hang
out with you today.

107
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,962
- Hey Oskar, I'm Courtland.

108
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:11,222
Miss Sophie tells me that
you're the smartest kid

109

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,190
- I know Queen.

181
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,903
- Wait a minute, you
like Freddy Mercury?

182
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,696
- No, at my old foster home,

183
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,699
they made us learn
to play instruments,

184
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,912
(sighs) but we only
learned Queen songs.

185
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,834
- What instruments?

186
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,794
- [Oskar] Piano.
- [Courtland] Ah,

187
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,630
- [Courtland] that's great.

188
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,714
- I hate piano.

189
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,935
- Hey, Oskar, com'ere.

190
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,979
Take a look at that.

191
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:15,610
- (Sighs) Loses his left arm
and replaces it with harpoon.

192
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,945
Four out of five.

193
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,655
- Four out of five?

194
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,906
- It's my review.

195
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,542
- You see any you'd
like to take home?

196
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,335
- Really?

197
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,758
(rustling pages and comic books)

198
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,472
- All right, you're all set.

199
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,182
- Can I have the receipt?

200
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,266
- Why, you wanna
return those already?

201
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,643
- Just give it to me.

202
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,771
(Courtland chuckles)

203
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,565
Can you sign it?

204
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,783
(pen scrawling)

205
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,132
(twangy blues music)

206
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,883
- My family tree is a mess.

207
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:25,096
- (Scoffs) No kidding,
it's like a family forest.

208
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,225
- Did you know medicine
is the third leading

209
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,894
cause of death in the U.S.?

210
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,313
- I didn't (laughs).

211
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,482
- This kid's like a
goddamn encyclopedia.

212
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,275
- I know!

213
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,030
Are you sure about this?

214
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,657
- Yeah.

215
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,786
Yeah, this is the way
teaching used to be for me.

216
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,540
Not to be a cheese ball but,

217
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,625
I feel an aliveness like,

218
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,756
there's a purpose to
something I'm doin'.

219
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,883
- You like this kid, huh?

220
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,595
- I wanna see him set up right.

221
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,849
- (Sighs) K, Oskar's
in what we call

222
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,726
a dual licensing program.

223
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,604
You're not the fostering
parent, but this allow you

224
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,691
temporary custody until we
find the right home for him,

225
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,402
and I'll be with you off and on.

226
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,072
Unfortunately, there
isn't a relative on here

227
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,531
that's of higher
interest than you,

228
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,867
but given Oskar's age,

229
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,661
this does allow him
more of a choice.

230
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,954
- OK.

231
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,372
- OK.

232
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,292
Are you absolutely
sure about this?

233
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,377
- Yeah.

234
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,885
(indistinct chatter
amongst patrons)

235
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,685
You know, there's like
zero protein in olives.

236
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,437
- So all these people want me.

237
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,022
- [Courtland] They do.

238
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,983
- Some of these people
are my aunts and uncles.

239
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,485
- [Courtland] Sorta.

240
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,237
- You're my uncle?

241
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,029
- Sorta.

242
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:09,075
Your granddad was, um, was just,

243
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,161
our family's just
really twisty is all.

244
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,916
Something wrong?

245
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,795
- They're gonna be phony.

246
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,797
- What, like all of 'em?

247
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,050
- Hi cutie, how ya doing?

248
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,469
Aw, Oskar, he's so precious!

249
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,431
Houses are gonna
be cleaned to a T.

250
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,642
It's gonna smell
like fresh laundry,

251
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,228
we're gonna eat at the
table they never eat at,

252
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:40,022
and the lawn's gonna be mowed.

253
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,859
- Mm-hmm, is your
name Oskar Satori

254
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,070
or Holden Caulfield,
I can't remember.

255
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,908
Come on, buddy, it's
not gonna be that bad.

256
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,619
- It's gonna be
exactly that bad.

257
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,209
- How 'bout this.

258
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,045
We're not supposed to
be there till tomorrow.

259
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,548
So what d'you say we go a
day early, and that way,

260
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,884
we get to know who
these people really are

261
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,345
in their real lives and
surprise these bastards.

262
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,558
(pleasant, rhythmic rock music
with offbeat guitar accents)

263
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,313
You know whatchu want?

264
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,773
- [Oskar] Ice cream.

265
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,610
- What kinda family do you want?

266
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,237
- Someone with ice cream.

267
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,363
I don't know.

268
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,992
Do you think I'm a mistake?

269
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,706
- I, I don't think
anybody's a mistake.

270
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:45,963
- Do you think my mother
didn't want to have me?

271
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:49,759
- Where do these
questions come from?

272
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,469
- You're her brother.

273
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,891
- You know, buddy,
I only knew your mom

274
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,186
for a very short
period of time, so uh,

275
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:05,441
you know, I'm not that
familiar with her mistakes.

276
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,904
But, I think life's
about choices

277
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:13,199
and a lot of 'em are
already made for us.

278
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,746
But, it's the ones that
we can make for ourselves

279
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,831
that make it interesting.

280
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,125
- Oh, gosh.

281
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,587
- [Courtland]
Everything all right?

282
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,380
- I guess.

283
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,095
- Arright, look at it this way.

284
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,724
Nobody gets to
choose their family,

285
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,642
but you do.

286
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,272
- That is so phony.

287
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,612
(car comes to a stop)

288
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,284
- Hey,

289
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,160
hey, Oskar?

290
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,667
Do you need your inhaler?

291
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,127
- [Oskar] I'm fine.

292
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,254
- [Courtland] You sure?

293
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,130
- I'm fine.

294
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,886
- How 'bout we make a new rule.

295
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,974
If either one of us feels
uncomfortable for any reason,

296
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,768
we say Mercury, that
way the other person

297
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,313
knows it's time to go.

298
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,731
Whatta ya think?

299
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,319
Yeah?

300
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,030
- Yeah.

301
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,699
- K.

302
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,711
- Whatever you're selling,
we've already found God,

303
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:51,672
and heard the good news.
(door slams)

304
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,465
- Mercury.

305
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,804
(raps on the door)

306
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,350
- Just kidding, how's it goin'?

307
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,477
So, you Jehovah's
Witness or salesman?

308
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,271
- (Laughs) He's just kidding.

309
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,024
Take your shoes off, come on in!

310
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,650
- [Courtland] All right.

311
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,277
- [Man In Striped
Shirt] Oh yeah...

312
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:13,903
- Not, not on the rug, you
wanna put them on that side.

313
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,363
- You got it.

314
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,198
- Home owner's association,
rules and stuff...

315
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,115
- I'm Courtland.

316
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,033
- [Man In Striped Shirt] Colin.

317
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,242
- [Woman] Hi, I'm Theresa.

318
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,621
- This is Oskar.
- [Theresa] Hello, Oskar!

319
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,164
- [Theresa] He's not talking.
- [Colin] It's OK.

320
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,499
- [Colin] We'll make him talk.

321
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,377
- Well, this is a
pleasant surprise!

322
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,421
Did we have the wrong
day or something?

323
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,964
- No, we're early.

324
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,384
- Oh, and that's legal?
- [Colin] Honey!

325
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,760
- [Theresa] OK, OK.

326
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,303
- We're glad you're here,
although if we had known

327
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,805
you were coming, we woulda
cleaned up a little.

328
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,266
(Colin chuckles and
groans as he sits down)

329
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,645
- Oh!
(Theresa pats couch)

330
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,402
(Colin laughs)

331
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,446
- So, uh, tell us a little

332
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,990
about yourself, Oskar Satori.

333
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,534
What do you like?

334
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,453
(clocking ticking)

335
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,302
(Colin chuckles)

336
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,971
(Colin mumbles and groans)

337
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,556
- He likes art, he's really good

338
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,850
at drawing, super-talented.

339
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,018
- [Colin] Mmm.

340
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,604
(clock ticking)

341
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,247
Brewski?
- [Courtland] Thanks.

342
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,503
- [Colin] You're
supposed to jump on it.

343
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,839
- He's just checkin' it out.

344
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,302
- That thing's brand new, man.

345
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:06,265
(Sighs) I absolutely
love brand new things.

346
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,602
I mean, the smell,
the potential.

347
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,936
It's all there.

348
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,278
(Sighs) So, what's
wrong with him?

349
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,113
- I'm sorry, what?

350
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,407
- He's gotta have
some kinda illness.

351
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,327
He's basically a
crack baby, right?

352
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,289
Theresa wanted to
adopt, but I was like,

353
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,416
he's my family, you know.

354
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:38,380
Aren't you somehow related
to this whole mess, too?

355
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,591
- [Courtland]
Yeah, yeah I guess.

356
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,383
- Yeah.

357
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:44,845
Nothin' a little medicine
won't fix, right?

358
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,222
I mean, he's not one of those,

359
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,225
"I'm gonna kill you in
your sleep"-type kids,

360
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,017
is he?

361
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,481
(insects chirping)

362
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:02,321
(silverware and plates rattling)

363
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,451
- So I was just
wondering, Oskar,

364
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,288
what um, just hypothetically,
for your room.

365
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,040
Um,

366
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:19,463
we were thinking you could
pick your bedroom color.

367
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,382
The accent wall, of course,
but we were thinking

368
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:22,550
between a taupe,

369
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,596
a light beige, or
a dark cream color.

370
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,139
What are your thoughts?

371
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,183
- [Colin] We use that
eggshell paint, doesn't show

372
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,351
dirt and stuff like that.
- [Courtland] Oh!

373
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,686
- [Courtland] It's
good stuff, eggshell.

374
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,895
- [Colin] Yep.

375
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,813
- So that's somethin'
you can decide,

376
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,314
just when everything works out.

377
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,566
Cross that bridge
when we get to it.

378
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:39,900
- [Colin] Oh, right, yeah.
- [Theresa] Yeah.

379
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,111
- [Colin] Absolutely.
- [Theresa] Of course.

380
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,404
- [Theresa] You
can wait on that,

381
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,822
it's more um, the bed
we were concerned about.

382
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,949
Do you like bunk beds?

383
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,034
- Make a fort out of 'em.

384
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,622
- It's just Thomasville
wants their orders

385
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,584
six months in advance because
they're custom, you know.

386
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:57,918
We just, we'd want
it to be a safe and...

387
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,420
- American furniture.
- [Theresa] Neat as possible.

388
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,463
- [Theresa] Yes, yes, American,
buy American (laughs).

389
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:04,300
It just, you have to wait
a while for the order,

390
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,801
so while you're
thinking about it,

391
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,220
I can always cancel it, but.

392
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,223
- [Colin] Bunk beds are fun!

393
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,934
- [Theresa] He's gonna sleep
on it, he'll sleep on it.

394
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,438
- Well, they weren't
absolutely terrible.

395
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,399
What did ya think?

396
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,069
- 2 out of five.
- [Courtland] Oh yeah?

397
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,697
- [Oskar] Don't be so
phony all the time.

398
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:28,407
- I wasn't bein' phony!

399
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,492
- Oh Oskar, he loves art,

400
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,911
he's so precious!

401
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,206
- Arright, arright!

402
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,333
Why only two?

403
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,586
- 'Cause I'd rather
live in a hole

404
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,589
in the wall than live there.

405
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,215
- [Courtland] Why's that?

406
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,718
- Then I wouldn't have to
be so worried all the time.

407
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:50,512
What if I spilled some
food on the carpet,

408
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,514
or made our couches dirty,

409
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,892
or forgot to put my
napkin in my lap?

410
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,436
I'm clumsy and I kinda
like being clumsy.

411
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,228
- You do?

412
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,358
- Yeah, first thing I'll
do when I buy a house

413
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,569
is put a big
scratch on the wall.

414
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,655
That way, I won't
have to be so worried

415
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,281
about keepin' things new.

416
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,658
I hate new things.

417
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,495
- Arright, well
listen up, Picasso.

418
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:18,457
There's nothin' wrong with
people having new things, OK?

419
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,626
- Whatever.

420
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,170
- [Voiceover] One of
those little English jobs

421
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,255
that can do around
200 miles an hour.

422
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,883
Cost him damn near 4000 bucks.

423
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,928
Chapter seven, a tiny bit
of light came through...

424
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:35,140
(rhythmic and twangy guitar
drowns out audio book dialog)

425
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,603
- Oh, God.

426
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,741
- [Courtland] C'mon, bud.
(door latch rattling)

427
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,119
- Can we help ya'll?

428
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,578
- I believe so.

429
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,621
- [Man With Glasses]
Child locks, huh?

430
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,289
- [Courtland] Hey,
I'm Courtland.

431
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,874
- Good to see ya, Courtland.
- [Courtland] This is Oskar.

432
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,168
- [Man With Glasses]
Oskar, Oskar Satori Oskar?

433
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,086
- [Courtland] Yeah,
that's the one.

434
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,504
- I'll be, now I don't think

435
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,548
we were expecting ya'll
till tomorrow, though.

436
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,925
- [Courtland] Yeah
um, is that a problem?

437
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,594
- Heavens no, no no, come on in.

438
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,763
- [Courtland] Hey bud.
- [Man With Glasses] Wow!

439
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:19,685
- [Man With Glasses] Nice to
finally meet you, Oskar Satori.

440
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:23,021
- Hope, your mother, was my
second cousin twice removed.

441
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,524
Or was it once removed, I'm
not quite sure (chuckles),

442
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,110
but Aunt Louise always
spoke highly of her.

443
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,988
I met her once at a family
reunion up in Goldsborough.

444
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,781
You remember that, don'tcha Jim?

445
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,491
- Was that the buffet?

446
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,743
- [Woman] Oh my dear Lord!

447
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,662
He is always so positive.
(Jim chuckles)

448
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,956
- I, I gotta ask, um,

449
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,375
what possessed you to
collect all this stuff?

450
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,086
- Well, you know,
we like to remember.

451
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,880
In fact, we love it.

452
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,383
Too many people today give
the past a bad name, y'know?

453
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,177
It's always brought
me great pleasure

454
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,054
to remember the things
I've done in life,

455
00:25:56,054 --> 00:26:00,184
like marry this good
woman here (chuckles).

456
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,691
Well, my father and I built
this place when I was young.

457
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:11,361
It's never had a
second owner, just us.

458
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,154
- Well,

459
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,490
this is uh,

460
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,326
this is really somethin'.

461
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,787
- So, who have you seen
from the family so far?

462
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,747
- Just Colin and Theresa.

463
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,748
- [Jim] Who?

464
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:23,999
- Oh you know who they are, Jim.

465
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,626
They're from Aunt
Louise's second marriage.

466
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,795
- Oh (chuckles).
- [Woman] Or was it her third?

467
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:31,173
- [Jim] With the plastic-covered
couches, oh my God!

468
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,509
And they wanted us to
take our shoes off.

469
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,511
- I mean, what the world!
(Jim chuckles)

470
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:38,013
- Weird people, really.
- [Woman] Mmm, Jim!

471
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,016
- [Courtland] Oh, that's them.
- [Jim] Yeah (chuckles).

472
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,645
- [Courtland] Ya'll
have kids of your own?

473
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,609
I'm sorry, I didn't...

474
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,527
- No, Walt,

475
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,822
Walt died last year,

476
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:58,158
just after the Town Hall
Festival in October.

477
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,868
- I'm very sorry to hear that.

478
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,912
- No, don't worry.

479
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:05,624
Uh, there's no way
you coulda known.

480
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,668
Maybe ya'll could
come back another day.

481
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,794
Would that work?

482
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,420
- Yeah, yeah of course, thanks.

483
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,672
- [Jim] Enjoyed meetin' ya.

484
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,589
- [Courtland] Thanks
for everything.

485
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,632
- Yes, sir, nice meetin' ya'll.

486
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,051
Hey hey, hold up now, big man.

487
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,428
I almost forgot, I wanna
give you somethin'.

488
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,721
I want you to have this.

489
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,973
I originally got this
for your Aunt Donna,

490
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,809
and she didn't take
to it real good.

491
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,602
I want you to have this.

492
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,815
Now, whenever somethin'
happens in life, Oskar,

493
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,192
before you judge it
to be good or bad,

494
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,320
I want you to read
this inscription here.

495
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,407
I know it's helped
me out a lot before.

496
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:42,870
It'll kinda remind ya of the
way that the world works.

497
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,871
- Thank you.

498
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,832
- You got it.

499
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,959
- Thanks again.

500
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,129
- Enjoyed meetin' ya'll.

501
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,721
- Well, I didn't think
they were phony, did you?

502
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,440
What's it say?

503
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,778
- This too shall pass.

504
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,823
- Mmm.

505
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,037
So, why Aquaman?

506
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,289
- What?

507
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,875
- You have like
100 Aquaman comics.

508
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,921
- He's got an ill reputation.

509
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,714
He's trying to find
his true purpose

510
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,591
beyond his public side,

511
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,845
as a deposed king
and a fallen hero.

512
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,394
27 and a half.

513
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,190
- 27 and a half what?

514
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,733
- [Oskar] Aquaman comics.

515
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,610
That's how many I have.

516
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,737
- You have a half a comic?

517
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,864
- My mom got me a Suicide Squad.

518
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,575
Aquaman was only in half of it.

519
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,206
- Whatta you remember
about your mom?

520
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,876
If you don't wanna talk
about it, I understand.

521
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:17,255
- She used to play chess
by herself, like I do.

522
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,132
- [Courtland] You play
chess by yourself?

523
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:19,925
- Yeah.

524
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,928
- You ever won?

525
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,638
- [Oskar] Never lost.

526
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,600
What do you know
about my mother?

527
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,313
- Your grandmother was only
married to my dad for two years.

528
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,232
Hope was in college,
I was teachin',

529
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,859
so I didn't see her very much.

530
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,532
- Remember anything she said?

531
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,870
- No, not really.

532
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,874
- I used to think
learning to play the piano

533
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,837
would impress her when she'd
finally come to see me.

534
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:03,677
(sighs) Like she'd like how
different I was or something.

535
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,640
Now, I guess I just need
to forget about her.

536
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,027
- [Courtland] If you could
be any piece on the board,

537
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,653
what would you be?

538
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,280
- Pawn maybe.

539
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,366
- A pawn, why would
you wanna be a pawn?

540
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,701
- Pawn's simple,

541
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:31,538
all the other pieces
seem so complicated.

542
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,999
- Hey guys!
- [Courtland] Hey!

543
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,083
- [Courtland] You know,
my dad used to say

544
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,960
that chess was the game of life

545
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,421
where every move
has its consequence,

546
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,756
and all the pieces divide class

547
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,800
from the lowly pawn
to the king and queen.

548
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,844
And then I realized that
at the end of the game,

549
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,139
all the pieces wind
up in the same box.

550
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,641
- Checkmate.

551
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,486
I get it, you're one of those.

552
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,572
- I'm one of what?

553
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,949
- People who can't
talk after they lose.

554
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,368
- People who can't
talk after they lose.

555
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,037
Set 'em up again.

556
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,497
- Can I see you outside?

557
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:17,709
- Yeah Courtland, can
she see you outside?

558
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,002
- This guy.

559
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,337
Set it up again.

560
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:24,091
Play a little tune on
the piano while you wait.

561
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,927
What's goin' on?

562
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:29,179
- 14 cases, Courtland, 14!

563
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,264
And I thought one of
them would go right.

564
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,808
- What are you talkin' about?

565
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,810
- What am I talkin'
about, are you kiddin' me?

566
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,270
These home visits are
supposed to be comfortable.

567
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,523
An entire day early, really?

568
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:40,941
- Huh, why don't you ask Oskar

569
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,359
if he feels slighted
by any of this?

570
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,820
- 'Cause he doesn't have
a say in any of this.

571
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:49,032
You're his guardian, Courtland,
stop being his friend!

572
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:54,287
(birds chirping and
insects buzzing)

573
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:59,793
(raps on the door as
wind chime jangles)

574
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:05,966
(raps on the door and
distant metallic clanging)

575
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,969
- I think I hear
someone back there.

576
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,597
- Let's go check it out.

577
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,978
(metallic clanging
and woman muttering)

578
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,813
- [Woman] Oh dangit!

579
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:26,153
- [Courtland] Mary?
- [Mary] Courtland!

580
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,070
- [Courtland] Wow.

581
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,280
- Wh, what are you doing here?

582
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,448
It's Wednesday, shouldn't
you be teaching?

583
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:34,244
- No, no, I'm, I'm
hangin' out with this guy.

584
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,954
- Oh, hey precious.

585
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,125
So um, Oskar,

586
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:45,630
you should know
that Courtland and I

587
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,923
used to teach together,

588
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,092
and anything he has
ever told you not to do

589
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,345
is probably because he's
already done it himself.

590
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,055
He has closed more
doors in his life

591
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:57,601
than anyone I know (laughs).

592
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:01,438
So, tell me about yourself,
I've been dying to meet you.

593
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,149
- You have?
- [Mary] Of course.

594
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,943
- [Oskar] Why
aren't you married?

595
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,820
- [Mary] Excuse me?
- [Courtland] Oskar!

596
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,572
- [Mary] No, no, it's fine.

597
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,408
Um, marriage just hasn't been

598
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,827
in the cards for
me yet, that's all.

599
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,289
You know, you can't
resist what is.

600
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,583
- Why do you want
me to be your son?

601
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:25,003
- Well, I felt like the universe

602
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,088
asked me to look after you.

603
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:30,884
- How does it do that?

604
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,803
- By bringing you
into my awareness.

605
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,597
You know, we are not the
thoughts that we have,

606
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:38,058
but the awareness behind them.

607
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,684
Once you've experienced
living in the now,

608
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,395
you'll understand it too.

609
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,521
- Are you a hippie?

610
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,858
- (Laughs) Hippie, no.

611
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,780
I don't identify
myself with form.

612
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,325
Hey, let's try something fun.

613
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,453
(metallic clang)

614
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,164
OK, get into position like I am.

615
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:05,377
(meditative Eastern music
with tabla percussion)

616
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:10,423
(Mary breathing
deliberately over music)

617
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,342
Ha-ah!

618
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,138
Our minds are all that we have,

619
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,433
and all that we
can give to others.

620
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,226
Be still!

621
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:27,148
Know all unhappiness is never
to do with a bad situation,

622
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,609
but the thoughts about it.

623
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,071
The stillness reminds
us that true presence

624
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,240
is real.

625
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,203
(Mary inhales heavily
before moaning and exhaling)

626
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,127
OK, you can open your eyes now.

627
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,298
OK, wasn't that wonderful?
(Courtland moans contentedly)

628
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:54,009
It's like a warm bath.

629
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,136
How did that feel?

630
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,887
It was nice, right?

631
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:00,348
- [Courtland] Yeah.
- [Mary] Do you feel good?

632
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,684
- [Courtland] Do you feel it?
(playful slap)

633
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,476
I feel it.

634
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,228
- Good.

635
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,524
You don't think so?

636
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,364
Hah, oh,

637
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,368
your mother is
very proud of you.

638
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,247
Now listen, you
just keep on smiling

639
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,292
even when it seems
impossible, OK?

640
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,339
But it's great seeing you.
- [Courtland] Yeah, oh!

641
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:36,343
- [Mary] Oh, I know you're
not much of a hugger.

642
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,600
Namaste, namaste.
- [Courtland] Namaste.

643
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,603
- [Courtland] Let's go.
- [Mary] Bye.

644
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,233
- [Oskar] So, you're a teacher?

645
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,026
- I was.

646
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,695
- Do you get paid good money?

647
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,157
- (Laughs) Did you really
just say, "good money?"

648
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,450
- My mom said people who work

649
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,411
at a desk all day
make good money.

650
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,246
Teachers have desks.

651
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:09,209
- I guess I
understand her logic.

652
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,712
- When I grow up, I wanna
do something important.

653
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,589
- [Courtland] What's
important to ya?

654
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,299
- Saving the world.

655
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,928
- How you gonna do that?

656
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,138
- I don't know, recycling.

657
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,857
Why are we pulling over?

658
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,410
- What do you wanna do?

659
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,369
- [Oskar] What?

660
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,454
- What do you like doing?

661
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,168
OK, when you think
of it, do that.

662
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,547
Don't worry about anything else.

663
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,967
- My mother didn't
like being a waitress.

664
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,679
- Sometimes people have to
find love in what they're doing

665
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:05,515
if they can't do what
they love already.

666
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,601
You just have to
avoid gettin' stuck.

667
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,604
- Think I could be
a comic book artist?

668
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,731
- I think you could be anything,

669
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,984
as funny as that sounds,

670
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,737
but I already know
what you wanna be.

671
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,530
- Tell me.

672
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,575
- A piano player.

673
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,286
(both chuckle)

674
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,292
Keep your eyes closed,
take a few steps in.

675
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,169
Come on, come on, you're
good, you're good.

676
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,253
Stop right there.

677
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,337
- Can I open 'em now?

678
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,047
- No, you can not.

679
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,593
Wait right there,
here, keep 'em closed.

680
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,262
Have a seat,
arright, just a sec.

681
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,475
- Can I open 'em?
- [Courtland] Not yet.

682
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,602
- [Courtland] No peekin'.

683
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,397
Are they closed?

684
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,695
Arright, take a look.

685
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,366
It's a little messy, but.

686
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,373
- Who's that?

687
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,125
- [Courtland] That's my wife.

688
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,293
- [Oskar] You're married.

689
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,170
- [Courtland] I was.

690
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,756
- [Oskar] So you're not anymore.

691
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:20,965
- No, I'm not.

692
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,303
- What was it like
being married?

693
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,014
- It was very difficult

694
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,725
and special all
at the same time.

695
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,479
- So why aren't you
married anymore?

696
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,022
Is she dead?

697
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,732
- No, she's not dead.

698
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,486
- Then why aren't you married?

699
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,323
- How 'bout somethin' to eat?

700
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,867
You like sandwiches?

701
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,661
Let's see what we got.

702
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,500
(Courtland grunts)

703
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,049
Cozy enough?

704
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,846
You like it here?
- [Oskar] Yeah.

705
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,890
- [Courtland] Good.

706
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,309
- Courtland?
- [Courtland] Yeah.

707
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,227
- [Oskar] Will you
still come see me

708
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,020
after we found a home?

709
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,773
- Of course, g'night.

710
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,782
(door creaking closed)

711
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,381
(phone buzzing and beeping)

712
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,302
- Mom, someone's here.

713
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,762
Mom, someone's here!

714
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,145
(knocking on door)

715
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,064
- Can I help you?

716
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,649
I'm sorry about the mess,

717
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,360
I wasn't expecting you
guys until tomorrow.

718
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,570
- No, Jake!

719
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,613
- Taylor, just...

720
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:07,989
- It's my iPad.

721
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,240
- Come back here, now!

722
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,742
- [Taylor] I'm doing
my outside time.

723
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,494
- You're gonna lose that phone!

724
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,496
Anything to drink?

725
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,498
- Water's fine, thank you.

726
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,460
(woman struggling to lift boy)

727
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,462
So, is David around as well?

728
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:25,381
- Um, he had to go
into the office today.

729
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,466
- On a Sunday?

730
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,426
- On everyday (laughs),

731
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,928
but he should be
back soon, though.

732
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,555
You guys know you're
a day early, right?

733
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,681
- Yeah, sorry about that.

734
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,516
We were just in the
neighborhood and uh,

735
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,602
Oskar just couldn't wait.

736
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,567
- The last time I saw
her was at my wedding.

737
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,320
She was eight months
clean, I think, at the time

738
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,946
and she still had
the rights to Oskar,

739
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,532
but we knew it
wouldn't be for long.

740
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:55,745
- (Sighs) Do uh, do you know
anything about the father?

741
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,998
I'm just tryin' to
give him an idea...

742
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,418
- Hope had just
called Dave and I

743
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,337
to cancel dinner plans.

744
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,966
Said she had a date.

745
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:14,263
Later that evening,
she called back,

746
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,056
very calm,

747
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:17,809
and said

748
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,521
something bad happened.

749
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,570
When we went to find her,

750
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,240
Dave tried to get
her to come back,

751
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,826
but she could hardly form words.

752
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,792
He took pictures of the guys,

753
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,128
but they just broke his phone

754
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:47,547
and threw him to the ground.

755
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:58,808
When we got Oskar's
letter about his adoption,

756
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:01,144
I felt like I had to do it.

757
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:03,646
- Yeah.

758
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,775
- We struggled with
it for a while, but

759
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,447
I think Dave's come around.

760
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,579
(Sighs) Time for lunch.

761
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:22,165
(door creaks and opens)
- [Taylor] Daddy!

762
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,458
- [Dave] Hey there, little one,

763
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,625
how're you doin'?
- [Taylor] Good.

764
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,377
- [Dave] Good, did
you have a good day?

765
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,004
- [Taylor] Yes.
- [Dave] You did?

766
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,381
- [Dave] Did you
behave for mommy?

767
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,674
- [Taylor] Yes.

768
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,054
- [Dave] Oskar, what
are you interested in?

769
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,349
- He's into uh...

770
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,560
- I'm not really sure yet.
- [Courtland] Oh.

771
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,980
- [Dave] Well, surely
there's something.

772
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,818
- Kinda wanna learn
everything about everything.

773
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,612
- Why don't we have the TV on?

774
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:53,946
- Honey, Oskar was talking.

775
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,657
- [Oskar] I don't know if that's
possible, but I wanna try.

776
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,576
- [Woman] That is
like music to my ears.

777
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,578
(all chuckle)

778
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,082
- Well, I wanna tell
you something, Oskar,

779
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:07,919
technological engineering,
now that's the next big thing.

780
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:11,088
So, sooner you learn
how to code, the better.

781
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,673
- I need the parental password.

782
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,592
- Not right now.

783
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,637
- Like drawing, don't
know if I'm any good,

784
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,806
but I like it.
- [Woman] Great!

785
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:22,225
- [Woman] Can we see something?

786
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:25,937
- I don't usually
show them to people.

787
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,021
- [Woman] OK.

788
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,695
- Would, would you
make me play the piano?

789
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,656
(all laugh)

790
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:37,448
- What?

791
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,075
- At my old foster home,

792
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,494
they made us learn
to play the piano.

793
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,620
I hate piano.

794
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:47,792
- No way, however, we do
have outside time, right?

795
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,671
I mean, we just want you
guys to get some vitamin D,

796
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:55,716
but, other than that,
we're pretty easy goin'.

797
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:03,599
- It was so nice
to meet you, Oskar.

798
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,520
- Keep drawin', buddy.

799
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,230
- Oh, food was great.

800
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,108
- Nice to meet you.

801
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:14,694
- Yeah, thanks for everything.

802
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,824
All right, buddy, let's review.

803
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,659
What'd you think about
that house yesterday

804
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,745
with Dave and Rebecca,
the iPad kids?

805
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,790
- Kinda liked them.

806
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:31,627
- Arright, four out of five?

807
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,712
- Three.

808
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,547
- [Courtland] What
makes them better?

809
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:38,676
- [Oskar] I dunno, I
felt like they liked me.

810
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,845
- Why don't you want
anybody lookin' at your art?

811
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,889
- [Oskar] Please
don't call it art.

812
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,891
- My bad, your drawings.

813
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,479
- If they tell me I'm good,

814
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,648
I'll just think
they're being polite,

815
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,734
and if they say it sucks,

816
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:58,571
well, I'll just think it sucks.

817
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,617
People are too phony
to see my work.

818
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,744
- Yeah, maybe
you're just a little

819
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,537
too much in your head.

820
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,331
- [Oskar] Whatta you mean?

821
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,582
- You seem to care an awful lot

822
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:12,001
about what other
people think of it.

823
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,628
What do you think?

824
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,715
- How am I supposed to
know, I'm the one making it.

825
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,008
- Yeah, but you're the only one

826
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:22,345
who gets to decide when
it's finished, right?

827
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:25,139
So until then, why
can't I see it.

828
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,018
- 'Cause it's for you.

829
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:33,230
(pleasant, breezy
light rock music)

830
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,784
(Sighs) People always say
not to get your hopes up,

831
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:46,911
and I really hate that.

832
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,037
- Why?
- [Oskar] I don't know.

833
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,623
- [Oskar] It just makes
me feel depressed.

834
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:54,001
- Eh, when people say that,
it's because they've created

835
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,004
a life that prepares
them for failure

836
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,673
rather than its alternative.

837
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:00,049
- Well, that sucks.

838
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,803
- Yeah, you don't have to
be a part of that life.

839
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,809
Who's been tellin' you this?

840
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,437
- Other kids, teachers.

841
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,232
Told me they liked my drawings,

842
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,943
but not to get my hopes up.

843
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:22,655
So really, they're just
saying it's not good enough.

844
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,865
Maybe it really does suck.

845
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:30,413
- Hey, did I ever tell you I
got to meet Maurice Sendak?

846
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:31,872
- Where the Wild Things Are?

847
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,582
- [Courtland] Among
other books, yep.

848
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,875
- [Oskar] What'd he say?

849
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,795
- He told me how they
became wild things.

850
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,881
- He did?
- [Courtland] Yep.

851
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,591
- [Oskar] Well, tell me.

852
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,136
- No, I don't think
you really wanna know.

853
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,346
- Come on!
- [Courtland] OK, OK.

854
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,181
- [Courtland] Just calm
down and stop yelling,

855
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,183
you're embarrassing me.
- [Oskar] I'm not yelling!

856
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:53,185
- [Courtland] All right!

857
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,646
OK, so I say,

858
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,568
"'Ey, Maurice," and
he looks at me like...

859
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,986
- You called him Maurice?

860
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,612
- Yeah, that's his name.

861
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,031
Somebody's named Maurice,
you gotta talk to 'em

862
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:08,034
in Italian accent likea dis.

863
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:11,287
So listen, I say,
"Hey, why wild things?"

864
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:15,166
And he grabs my
shoulder and he says,

865
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,042
"Courtland,

866
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,587
"I actually drew horses.

867
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,966
"What you saw in my
book were horses."

868
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,469
"It was supposed to be called
Where the Wild Horses Are,

869
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,639
"but the truth is, I can't
draw a goddamn horse."

870
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,058
- Nice language!

871
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,021
- What did she say?

872
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:40,191
- Nothin', she's just
bein' a nosy parker.

873
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:44,070
My point is, I think
you got the upper hand.

874
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:44,862
- How so?

875
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,533
- Just, you've been
lookin' at it all wrong.

876
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,495
You are so good
at being original

877
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:56,082
that nobody else can
even think like you.

878
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:57,792
You don't wanna be
like anyone else.

879
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:01,420
If you were, I wouldn't
hang out with ya.

880
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,672
I mean, you wouldn't
even be cool enough

881
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,257
to hang out with me.

882
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,639
You're an original
and it's cool.

883
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:16,185
(pleasant strumming guitar)

884
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,280
(Oskar and Courtland
breathing heavily)

885
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,118
Hey, I'm supposed to be the
only one who's winded here.

886
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:36,080
(Laughs) Congratulations.
(slapping hands)

887
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,836
- Why don't you hug people?

888
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:42,628
- What?

889
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,840
- People have been
tryin' to hug you.

890
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,466
Do you know that?

891
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,052
- Where do these
questions come from?

892
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:54,098
- Are you really not a
hugger, like Mary said?

893
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:58,769
- Why do you hug people?

894
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:02,022
- 'Cause it's my way of
saying thank you and goodbye.

895
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,943
- Yeah well, maybe my
dad wasn't such a hugger.

896
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,655
Or, maybe I don't know how.

897
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,825
See, try to hug me.

898
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:13,617
Eh, uh.

899
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:17,538
C'mon.

900
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,543
(raps on door)

901
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,713
- Forget some,

902
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:29,925
can I help you?

903
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:34,054
- Yeah, I'm Courtland and
this is my buddy Oskar.

904
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,432
Hope's son.

905
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,186
- Right, right, yeah, I'm Gary.

906
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:43,189
Um, did I get the days mixed up?

907
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,733
- No, no, we're, we're early.

908
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,110
- Oh, come in then.

909
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:57,161
You know, Victoria won't
be back until tomorrow.

910
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,996
So, why are you so early?

911
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:02,583
- We just wanted to see
- [Courtland] We...

912
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:06,545
- [Oskar] Who people really
are in their normal lives.

913
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,965
- Yeah, well, why don't
we, why don't we head out

914
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,009
and get some burgers
somewhere, yeah?

915
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,552
- OK.
- [Gary] Yeah, all right?

916
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,804
- [Gary] All right, let
me go get my wallet, OK?

917
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,014
- Sounds good.

918
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,563
- [Oskar] Kinda like it here.

919
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:28,567
- Hey Oskar, wanna see a
picture of your mother?

920
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:31,946
- Who's this?

921
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:35,491
- Think that's your Aunt
Victoria, Gary's wife.

922
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:39,078
- Uh, where's Gary?

923
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,080
- Uh...

924
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,291
- [Oskar] Hi, I'm Oskar.

925
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,922
- I forgot my purse.

926
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:58,013
(clacking footsteps and
Gary sighing heavily)

927
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,643
- Can we slow down?

928
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:06,355
Why are we leaving,
what about the burgers?

929
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,607
Why isn't Gary coming with us?

930
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,400
- Hey.

931
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,488
I need you to do
something for me, OK?

932
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,908
No matter what happens,
I want you to promise me

933
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,160
you'll always keep
your promises.

934
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,537
- Fine, I promise.

935
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,666
- All right, let's go.

936
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,089
- Still forcing it.

937
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,300
- [Courtland] What do
you mean, I'm forcing it?

938
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,801
- You gotta commit.

939
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,511
- [Courtland] I am!

940
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:41,682
- [Oskar] Choose a side
and tilt your head.

941
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,392
- Oh, OK, here we go.

942
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,648
Like this?

943
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,775
- [Oskar] You did it!
(Courtland laughs)

944
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,319
- All right, yes.

945
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:58,240
Good job, good job.
(pats against tree)

946
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,202
I think me and this guy
are gonna be good buddies.

947
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,002
(jar opening)

948
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:17,092
- Why do married
people fight so much?

949
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,387
- (Shrugs) I don't know.

950
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:27,102
- My old foster
parents argued a lot.

951
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,189
- [Courtland] I bet that sucked.

952
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,775
- Did your wife argue with you?

953
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,194
- I wouldn't say
she argued with me.

954
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:38,197
We argued with each other.

955
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:41,241
- [Oskar] Why'd you do that?

956
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,410
- That's a good
question, my friend.

957
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,038
Um, I don't know, I think that

958
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:50,125
a lot of times it's about money,

959
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,794
but you know, for us,

960
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,255
we argued a lot about timing.

961
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,678
- [Oskar] What do
you mean, timing?

962
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,269
- She was just ready
for certain things

963
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,649
that I wasn't quite ready for.

964
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,028
- [Oskar] What was her name?

965
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,491
- [Courtland] Tara.
- [Oskar] Tara.

966
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,035
- [Courtland] Mm-hmm.

967
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,204
- [Oskar] Like the earth.

968
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,373
- Yeah, Tara like the earth.

969
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,503
Sculptor.
- [Oskar] Creator.

970
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,338
- [Courtland] Uh, lawyer.
- [Oskar] Arguer.

971
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,298
- [Courtland] Psychiatrist.
- [Oskar] Listener, no.

972
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,384
- [Oskar] Uh, friend.
- [Courtland] Teacher.

973
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,885
- [Oskar] Inspirer.
- [Courtland] I like that.

974
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,303
- [Courtland] I'm an inspirer.

975
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,223
- [Oskar] No, uh, someone
who helps you pass a test.

976
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:49,017
Dangit, I don't have a one
word down for that one.

977
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,103
- You could give me an
answer for anything, huh?

978
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,730
- I know the difference between
anything and everything.

979
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,357
- Oh yeah?

980
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,692
- See, I was just thinking
about this last night.

981
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:59,695
Anything is broader in
its negative connotation.

982
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,572
For example, I
don't want anything,

983
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,324
where as I don't want
everything implies

984
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,118
that you still might
want something.

985
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,954
- [Courtland] Uh-huh.
- [Oskar] Who's that?

986
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,247
- [Courtland] Hey.

987
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,790
- Hey Oskar, I'm
Pierce Williams,

988
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,292
why don't you come with me?

989
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:17,254
- [Sophia] Honey, it's OK,
you can go with Mr. Williams.

990
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,381
- [Courtland] What's
going on here?

991
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,050
- Theresa and Colin
Gearhart are taking custody.

992
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,427
- What are you talking about?

993
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:24,720
We haven't even seen the
rest of the families yet.

994
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,054
- Well, their
attorneys made a case

995
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,390
that they have more rights.

996
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,768
What's wrong, this'll
be good for him.

997
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,103
- I dunno, I just thought

998
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,105
he'd have more of
a choice in this.

999
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,733
- Yeah, look, it's unfortunate
that they lawyered up,

1000
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,902
but I went to the
house yesterday.

1001
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:43,489
I think it'll be a good fit.
(Courtland scoffs)

1002
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,240
Courtland?

1003
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,453
(dramatic, slightly
uneasy piano)

1004
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,304
- [Oskar] Mercury.

1005
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,140
Please, Mercury!

1006
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,309
- [Courtland] Oskar, I...

1007
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,144
- [Oskar] We're
breaking the rules!

1008
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,146
I wanna go home with you!
(car latch rattling)

1009
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,775
- Buddy, I don't think there's
anything we can do here.

1010
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,693
- Oskar, open the door!

1011
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:26,031
Hey, I know you're up
front listening to me.

1012
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,241
Open the door!

1013
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,412
(car door opens and slams shut)

1014
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,331
This way, sir.

1015
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,624
We don't have time
for this today.

1016
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:39,836
(dramatic, slightly
haunting piano)

1017
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:47,386
Oskar Satori is now
up for legal adoption.

1018
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:51,223
We have court papers with the
decision about their rights.

1019
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,475
With these sort of things, we
feel like this with a child,

1020
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,602
that we should put our
complete attention to.

1021
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,271
(Courtland scoffs)

1022
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,356
Now, we do appreciate the
volunteering and hard work

1023
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,692
and efforts by Mr.
Courtland, but at this time,

1024
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,361
we are now terminating
the guardianship contract.

1025
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,696
- Why?
- [Sophie] Courtland!

1026
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,489
- [Pierce] What
do you mean, sir?

1027
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,532
- What was the point?

1028
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,908
- We just thought
that Oskar should...

1029
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,118
- This is bullshit.

1030
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:11,910
- [Theresa] Let's keep it down.

1031
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,203
- Excuse me?

1032
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,497
- No no no, if this man
can just walk in here

1033
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,792
and make snap decisions based
on no evidence of his own,

1034
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,836
and certainly not
mine, for that matter,

1035
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,505
somebody please tell
me what is the point?

1036
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:25,382
- There is a process,
Mr. Courtland...

1037
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,467
- Yeah, well you need to
review your fucking process

1038
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,720
because it's shitty and
in complete disregard

1039
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,430
of this child that
we're supposed

1040
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:32,472
to be focusing our attention on.

1041
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,433
- We will not have
any of that in here!

1042
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,476
- Sophie, it is time to
ask Mr. Courtland to leave.

1043
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,894
- [Courtland] I am not leaving.

1044
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,229
- Shall we go over
the legal troubles

1045
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,147
that the Gearhart's were willing

1046
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,148
to subside for your behavior?

1047
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:41,940
- [Theresa] Yes,
you ungrateful...

1048
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,567
- My behavior?

1049
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,485
Colin here thinks that he's
about to adopt a crackhead

1050
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,322
that's gonna kill him in
the middle of his sleep.

1051
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,239
(Sophie gasps)

1052
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,116
- [Theresa] He did not say that.

1053
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,576
He never said that.

1054
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,119
- Are you sure you
wanna adopt this kid

1055
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,787
who's gonna fuck up your
pretty little couches

1056
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,957
with their plastic covers?
(Oskar slams table)

1057
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:01,835
(door slams)

1058
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:02,628
Oskar!

1059
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:07,466
(ominous droning tones)

1060
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:14,598
(crunching and rustling
brush over droning ambiance)

1061
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:24,399
(both huffing and puffing)

1062
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,073
- I want my mom back.

1063
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:33,575
- I know.

1064
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,452
- Did she run away?

1065
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,287
- What?

1066
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:40,874
- It's OK if she did,
'cause I'll go find her.

1067
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:41,875
- No, Oskar,

1068
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,336
she was very sick.

1069
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:47,547
- How do you know?

1070
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,715
Maybe they're just saying that.

1071
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,592
Maybe the whole world's phony.

1072
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,303
Everybody's lying to everybody.

1073
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:57,015
(Courtland breathing heavily)

1074
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,643
What are you still doing here?

1075
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:02,145
Just a waste of
your time, remember?

1076
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,605
- This is not your fault, OK?

1077
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,523
- You're such a liar!

1078
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,149
- Hey.

1079
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,652
This is where you need to be.

1080
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,490
It may not be what you want,

1081
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,534
it's not what I'd want,

1082
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:19,162
but this is where you
should be right now.

1083
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,458
I'll still come see
ya all the time.

1084
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,670
- I said Mercury and
you didn't take me back!

1085
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,130
You're supposed to take me back.

1086
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,173
- [Courtland] I
know, man, I know.

1087
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,259
- Told me to always
keep my promises,

1088
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,594
and you can't even keep yours!

1089
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:39,141
(fading footsteps
through the brush)

1090
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:39,933
- Phew.

1091
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:51,194
- Well uh, thanks for
bringin' him back in.

1092
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,534
- You mind me comin'
by and seeing him?

1093
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,036
- We can talk about that later.

1094
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:05,625
- There's nothin' wrong
with that kid in there.

I don't know what else
you were expecting,

1121
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,822
but I greatly appreciate you
spending time with Oskar.

1122
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:01,324
(Courtland sighs heavily)

1123
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,369
- There's gotta be
somethin' else we can do.

1124
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,705
- What?
- [Courtland] He hates them.

1125
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,248
- [Courtland] He's gonna be
disappointed and confused

1126
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,541
for the rest of his life.

1127
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:13,295
- And what family
would prevent that?

1128
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:15,463
- I just don't think we did
everything we could for him.

1129
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:16,965
- Courtland, that's
all there is...

1130
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:18,842
- All there is?

1131
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,468
That's not enough.

1132
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,386
- Hey, sit!

1133
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:25,473
My job is to find the best homes

1134
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,934
for orphans, that's it.

1135
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,853
All these potential
families that I visit,

1136
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,897
they don't know what
the hell they're doing.

1137
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:33,690
None of us do, we're
all just guessing,

1138
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,359
and every single family
has their own normal

1139
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,861
and they make the best
guess with what to do

1140
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,487
based on what their parents did,

1141
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,072
which was based on
what their parents did

1142
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,366
and nobody knew what they
were doing the whole time.

1143
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,868
They just did it!

1144
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:46,870
That's life.

1145
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:54,085
- You should give
that speech to Oskar.

1146
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:57,297
You're really good
at what you do.

1147
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:59,758
(Sophie sighs)

1148
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:04,471
(clanging church bell)

1149
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:33,291
- You're gonna ruin that
brand new suit, Oskar.

1150
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:35,877
Hey, hey hey!

1151
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,713
Oskar, stop stop stop, what the.

1152
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,676
What's wrong?

1153
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,434
It's OK, buddy.

1154
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:53,770
It's OK.

1155
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,796
- 14th annual career day.

1156
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,841
We all excited
about the job fair?

1157
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:28,763
We have an overuse of the word
jobs in our society today.

1158
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,349
When people start creating
jobs to create other jobs

1159
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,852
but all that ever does
is create the same thing

1160
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:36,688
over and over again,
then we are feeding

1161
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:40,900
directly into the collective
insanity of human beings.

1162
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,738
So when you're
lookin' around today,

1163
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,574
please be aware that
most of these jobs

1164
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:50,577
are neither creative,
nor necessary.

1165
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,749
We have insurance companies
for insurance companies.

1166
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:58,960
Some people might say,
"Well, our economy would fail

1167
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,963
"if we got rid of some of these
so-called unnecessary jobs."

1168
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,674
Maybe, but we all
need to be wary

1169
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,928
when it is the system
we protect from failing

1170
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,556
rather than the way of life the
system is supposed to serve.

1171
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,808
- Mr. Courtland?
- [Courtland] Joseph?

1172
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:16,227
- [Joseph] What if we don't
know what we're supposed to do?

1173
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,896
- Supposed to do,
whatta you mean?

1174
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,898
- Well, you make
us read these books

1175
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:22,942
about lost characters
and celebrate it.

1176
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,236
Like we should be lost too.

1177
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,615
But the truth is,
I hate being lost.

1178
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,407
- Mm-hmm.

1179
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,120
I'm not saying you
should be lost.

1180
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,457
I'm saying it's OK to be lost.

1181
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:40,335
This isn't a
mathematical equation

1182
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:44,464
where your age constitutes
life's next big event.

1183
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:49,552
Travel, go to college,
fail, drop out,

1184
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,846
change your mind,
go back to college.

1185
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:53,223
It's all OK, live!

1186
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:58,019
Your life isn't supposed
to be a certain way

1187
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,395
at a certain time.

1188
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:04,442
What are you afraid
of, right now?

1189
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:05,902
- Isn't it obvious?

1190
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,282
(Courtland shrugs)

1191
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,119
(clock ticking)

1192
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,964
- Right now, each of you

1193
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,300
has the chance

1194
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,221
to become a master
at what you love

1195
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:38,017
and make a living doing so.

1196
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,727
So when it comes to work,

1197
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:44,524
find something you'd do
if money were no object.

1198
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,734
And when it comes to life,

1199
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,946
never miss a single moment.

1200
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,201
- [Shopkeeper] Hey,
what's goin' on, man?

1201
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,536
- [Courtland] Hey, not much.

1202
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,079
- [Shopkeeper] These
gonna do it for ya?

1203
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,831
- [Courtland] Yeah.
- [Shopkeeper] All right.

1204
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:03,126
- [Shopkeeper] Be $27.95
after taxes and discounts.

1205
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:04,043
- [Courtland] Put
it on that, please.

1206
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:06,921
- [Shopkeeper] Thank you, sir.

1207
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,382
(raps on door)

1208
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,468
- I have to see him.

1209
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,095
- Courtland, now
is not a good time.

1210
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,638
- [Courtland] I just need
to say something to him.

1211
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,057
- I can deliver the message.

1212
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:24,272
Look, it's just, he's
getting used to a routine,

1213
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:27,275
and now is just not
a good time, OK?

1214
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:33,823
(Theresa sighs heavily
and door slams)

1215
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:37,577
Courtland!

1216
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,706
- Oskar?
(video game bloops)

1217
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:42,498
Oskar?

1218
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:44,667
Hey.

1219
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,712
- I am calling the police.

1220
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:51,466
- Are you OK?

1221
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:55,178
(video game noise continues)

1222
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:01,017
I like your new room.

1223
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,104
Where's your sketchbook?

1224
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,397
- [Oskar] Gone.

1225
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:10,276
- Whatta ya mean gone?

1226
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:12,111
- Why weren't you
at the funeral?

1227
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,573
It was in the paper, so
don't tell me your forgot.

1228
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:16,574
- No, buddy,

1229
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:20,453
I'm sorry.

1230
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,163
- I was looking for you.

1231
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,165
Mom told me you were the
only person in the world

1232
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,793
she wanted me to grow up with.

1233
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,588
So why weren't you there?

1234
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,048
She is your sister.

1235
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:37,595
- I don't really
have a good reason.

1236
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,765
That's why I'm here now.

1237
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:44,811
I wanna be a part of your life,

1238
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,438
even if it's just
a weekend thing.

1239
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,023
- [Oskar] Don't you get it?

1240
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,858
Everyone I love abandons me.

1241
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,068
- Oskar, I'm not
gonna abandon you...

1242
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,361
- You ran away!

1243
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:54,737
- [Courtland] Hey,
that's not true!

1244
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,239
- Get out!
- [Courtland] C'mon, buddy!

1245
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,199
- [Courtland]
Don't be like that!

1246
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,368
Arright, arright, I'm leavin'.

1247
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,954
- Leave!
(door slams)

1248
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:07,166
(dramatic, slightly
haunting piano music)

1249
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,027
Wait!

1250
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:39,032
(pleasant and reassuring guitar)

1251
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,162
Wait!

1252
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:48,166
(pleasant and reassuring guitar)

1253
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,142
This is all kinda phony,

1254
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,729
'cause you'll never read this.

1255
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:14,233
I'm not so sure about
heaven or God or any of it.

1256
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,235
I'm not so sure about anything,

1257
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:20,239
but neither is anyone
else and that's all right.

1258
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,575
I forgive you for leaving me.

1259
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:25,286
I don't think I'll be able
to call this place home,

1260
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,038
but I know I'll be OK.

1261
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:30,541
(pleasant, flowing guitar)

1262
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:52,021
C'mon, we're gonna miss it!

1263
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:55,233
- [Courtland] All

1264
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,235
