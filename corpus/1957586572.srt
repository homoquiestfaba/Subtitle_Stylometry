[Ruby grunts]

13
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,426
Hot dog!

14
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,845
Ruby, come get it.

15
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,847
Hot dog!

[barks]

17
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,233
Oh! Good girl! Good girl.

00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,443
Good girl. Oh, Ruby!

19
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,611
Oh! [laughs]

20
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,947
And you have a date with a family.

21
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,490
Oh!

22
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,867
Somewhere in you is an adoptable dog.

23
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,953
I know. I know.

24
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,080
All right. Good girl. Come on.

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,922

[sniffing]

27
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,811
Oh my gosh! We've got skunk soap.

28
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,355
Perfect. Thank you. Come on, Ruby.

29
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,775
- She knows a family's picking her up.
- She doesn't want to leave us.

30
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,539
No, no, no, she doesn't want to leave you.

31
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,280
Well, I'd take her home,
but my husband would leave me.

32
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,199
[Rick] All right, come on.

33
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,912
This is serious now.

34
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,456
You've been here six months. Yeah.

35
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,250
You cannot blow this chance.

36
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,419
<i>You've been to seven homes already.</i>

37
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,837
[woman] Darn dog!

38
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,181
- [Ruby growls playfully]
- [woman 2 screams]

39
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,465
[man] Ruby!

[growls playfully]

41
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,886
[man 2] Get out of there, Ruby!

[muffled] Ruby!

43
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,267
It's time to clean up your act, sweetie.

44
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,686
All right? Come on, stinky.
Let's get you going.

- [laughing]

51
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,914
Let's hope this placement sticks.

52
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,498
[chuckling] All right.

53
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,047
[upbeat instrumental music playing]

54
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,134
- Oh, I washed that.
- I just picked a piece of onion off it.

55
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,219
Oh.

56
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,845
[whispers] Yum, yum, yum.

57
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,057
Come sit with us. I don't even let
my third graders eat while standing.

58
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,160
- I failed third grade. And fourth.
- [woman giggles]

59
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,020
- You're exaggerating.
- Oh, you'd have failed me.

60
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,482
Never. You would be my favorite.
Teacher's pet.

61
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:35,900
[baby giggles]

62
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:36,984
[man] Bye.

63
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,491
Careful today.

64
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,910
Always.

65
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,332
- Say "Bye, Dada."
- Bye-bye, Dada.

66
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,215
[officer 1] That boat's
in a good spot there.

67
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,884
All right now. That's clear.

68
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,679
[dog sniffing]

69
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,098
- Head down current there.
- [officer 2] Let's go. Seek!

70
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,181
Morning.

71
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,975
Morning.

72
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,645
- It's the K9 unit.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,023
Searching for drugs
tossed out of a vehicle last night.

74
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,626
That's some of Matt Zarella's team
down there. Best of the best.

75
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,569
Like a Navy SEAL Special Ops team.

76
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,280
300 million olfactory receptors
in their noses,

77
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,865
compared to six million in people.

78
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,534
Their sense of smell's
100,000 times more acute than ours.

79
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,786
If we can sense a teaspoon of sugar
in a cup of coffee,

80
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,455
a dog can detect a teaspoon of sugar...

81
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,832
In two Olympic-size pools
filled with water.

82
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,792
[laughs]

83
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,918
Yeah.

84
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,422
Uh, Daniel O'Neil. Rhode Island
state trooper, Wickford Barracks.

85
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,717
Seamus Brady.
Retired maintenance, Scituate Barracks.

86
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,594
- Well, it's good to meet you.
- Mm.

87
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,346
[dog barks]

88
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,513
Look. Found.

89
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,890
- Bring it in.
- [barks]

90
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,975
Smooth. Good job!

91
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:51,893
Excellent work.

92
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,312
I'm gonna be one of those guys
with one of those dogs.

93
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,399
I gotta, uh... Good to meet you, Mr. Brady.

94
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,860
[officer 1] Bring it in. Let's go, team.

95
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,238
[military-style drum beat playing]

96
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,785
Weather continues to be unseasonably warm.

97
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,662
Not even May, but keep an eye out
for stranded motorists,

98
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,290
carry extra water
for overheating radiators.

99
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,001
No matter the heat, hats stay on.

100
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,295
I'm talking to you, Two Towers.

101
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,130
- You got it, Sarge.
- You got it, Sarge.

102
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,218
And of special interest to O'Neil.

103
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,719
It's that time of year.

104
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,972
Tryouts for the K9 academy
are coming up May 15.

105
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,307
Right on, my brother.

106
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,768
Eighth time trying to get in
is gonna be the charm.

107
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,520
[all chuckling]

108
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,355
Be safe, everyone.

109
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,615
Sarge. Uh, this year's my last chance.

110
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:51,327
The applicants have to be under 30,
and I'm 29.

111
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,162
I'll write the letter of rec again,

112
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,124
but I'm not the one
standing in the way of you trying out.

113
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:00,169
It's Zarella. His K9 unit, his academy.

114
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,715
- [boy] Come on.
- [Ruby whines]

115
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,801
Come on. She'll come.

116
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,927
Come on, Ruby.

117
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,178
[Ruby panting]

118
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,514
Okay, go on. Go. Go on, sweetie.

119
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,015
Go on. Go.

120
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,810
[man] There you go.
That's nice, right? There you go.

121
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,604
- Oh.
- [boy] Aw. She got away.

122
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,232
Oh! [chuckling] Okay, okay, okay. Okay!

123
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,984
Go on. Go on.

124
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,402
- Go!
- [Ruby whines]

125
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,528
Go on.

126
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Good.

127
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,782
[man] Ah, there you go.

128
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,161
- [boy] Come.
- [Ruby whimpers]

129
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,872
There you go.
That's nice, right? There you go.

130
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,541
I don't wanna see her back here.

131
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,170
I'll have no choice.

132
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,754
[vehicle engine starts]

133
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,680
[rhythmic pop music playing]

134
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,098
[beeps]

135
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,435
[beeps]

136
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,519
[engine revving]

137
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,272
[beeps rapidly]

138
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,317
[siren wailing]

139
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,035
Thanks.

140
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:39,685
Excuse me, sir. How many juice boxes
have you had this afternoon?

141
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,814
All right.
License and registration, please.

142
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,733
Mom!

143
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,485
Hey, I was... I was just kidding.

144
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,449
Sir, I know you think
I don't have the right stuff to...

145
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,825
No. The right temperament.

146
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,620
No, no, no, no. Don't presume
to know what he knows or thinks.

147
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,996
[Zarella] Daniel O'Neil.

148
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,041
Like clockwork.

149
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,833
Sir.

150
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,423
[breathes deeply]

151
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,760
All right, sit down.

152
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,346
Sir, I know you think
I don't have the right temperament,

153
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,932
that I'm easily distracted,
maybe not much of a reader,

154
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,394
but for the job I think intuitive skills
and people skills are more important

155
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,145
than being speedy with paperwork.

156
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,564
Plus, I love dogs.

157
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,774
I'm ready for this.

158
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,151
I'd really like to try out, sir.

159
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,240
Aren't you qualified
in a bunch of other trooper specialties?

160
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,535
Yes, sir. I am.
Hostage negotiating, EVOC training,

161
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,246
peer-to-peer counseling,
honor guard, boat team, dive team.

162
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,333
But K9 is my dream. You know that, sir.
I mean, I think you know that, sir.

163
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,420
Sorry, sir. I don't mean to presume
to know what you know or think.

164
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,799
- I'm a fan.
- [exhales] Thanks.

165
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:53,968
But also a truth-teller.

166
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,222
K9 team requires calm

167
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,141
and focus.

168
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,811
You're all over the place.
You can't even sit still.

169
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,816
- Who knows where your mind is.
- It's here, sir.

170
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,074
I appreciate the candor

171
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,369
and the persistence, but I don't see it.

172
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:25,291
You do this
because you care about people, sir.

173
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:27,668
The same as me.

174
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,964
You want justice.
You want endings to stories.

175
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,675
Sometimes happy endings.

176
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,011
Sometimes just closure.

177
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,722
The department has no money for new dogs.

178
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:46,103
The German shepherds we use
come from Czech Republic or Germany

179
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,147
and cost over $10,000 each.

180
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:56,364
I know how much you want this.
How long you've waited.

181
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,247
I'm a short guy.
I barely made the height requirement.

182
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:11,420
I had to work twice as hard
to get to the same place as everyone else.

183
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,674
I'm used to working ten times harder.

184
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,469
Sir.

185
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,474
Danny.

186
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,850
Catch.

187
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,021
[woman on phone] <i>We don't have $10,000.</i>

188
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,649
<i>With one kid here and another on the way,</i>

189
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,317
<i>we have our hands full.</i>

190
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,946
- Say what you just said again.
- I'm pregnant.

191
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,031
[excitedly] <i>That's great news!</i>

192
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,658
[laughs]<i> That's great!</i>

193
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,159
Oh, Mel! Oh.

194
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,453
[baby] Ma?

195
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,415
K9 dogs live with their officer partners
24/7, right?

196
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,918
It's no trouble at all. They're trained.
You wouldn't have to lift a finger.

197
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,422
I'm thinking now maybe
it's not the right time for the K9 thing.

198
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,609
<i>Remember how we were building the deck
when I was carrying Finn,</i>

199
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,302
<i>and you promised a quiet pregnancy
if it happened again?</i>

200
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,556
It's... It's not the right time for K9 unit.

201
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,641
It's the <i>only</i> time, Mel.

202
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,185
It's a... It's a step up, a raise.

203
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,396
We'll finally be able
to pay off college loans,

204
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,023
save for our kids,
maybe get a bigger house someday.

205
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,108
[Finn babbling]

206
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,986
- So what's the plan?
- I'll get back to you.

207
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,946
<i>- All right. Love you.</i>
- I love you too.

208
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,029
[gasps]

209
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,577
- [growls happily]
- [gasps]

210
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,620
- Hey. Down. Down.
- [Ruby whimpers]

211
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,956
She doesn't listen. She's too high-strung.

212
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,584
She chews. She digs. She steals food.

213
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:35,629
She never sleeps. She barked all night.
She's not even housebroken.

214
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,090
I know people who train dogs.
I could get you some names.

215
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,551
- I'll pay for it.
- We're not keeping her.

216
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,720
Maybe you have a kitten?

217
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,769
That dog looks like Ruby, right?
But it's not. It's a new dog.

218
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,647
She's had so many chances.
We can't keep unadoptable dogs.

219
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,942
- She'll be put down tonight.
- Rick, no.

220
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,530
Ruby's never had a real home.
She thinks this is home. We are her home.

221
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,814
When somebody takes her,
she thinks she's just visiting,

222
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,076
like going to the vet
and we're gonna pick her up.

223
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,037
[sighs]

224
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,455
You know how these dogs are.

225
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,583
Their family drops them off here,
and day after day they just wait,

226
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,752
expecting their person
to come and get them.

227
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,296
They'll wait and wait.
Sometimes they wait a very long time.

228
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,800
It's heartbreaking.
Ruby just knows how to get back home.

229
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,471
It can take a while before someone
as loyal and loving as a dog

230
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,974
can commit to someone new.
Nobody's given Ruby that chance.

231
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,227
- Pat, come on.
- One more day.

232
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,896
I've got people I can call. Please.

233
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,150
You have until the end of the day.

234
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,444
But the vet comes at seven.

235
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,115
[woman on phone] <i>No, I wish we could
help you. We can't take any more dogs.</i>

236
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,785
[Pat] Thank you.
I just thought I'd give you another try.

237
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,953
[woman on phone] <i>Sorry.</i>

238
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,708
[dogs yapping on phone]

239
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,792
Hi, honey.

240
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,588
Whoa. Can you just
take Moonlight, please? Thank you.

241
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,048
You can't do this to me. No.

242
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,134
No. We got four kids.
And a rescue for each one.

243
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,555
Plus George, and Billie,

244
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,390
and Barney, and Moonlight.

245
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,226
<i>- You're killing me.</i>
- Okay.

246
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,397
[dogs continue yapping]

247
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,108
All right, here we go.
All teams, these three.

248
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,901
- [trainee] Up!
- Good.

249
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,945
[barking]

250
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,866
Hey.

251
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,618
Hey. Pull up a stool.

252
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,872
What? All right. [chuckles]

253
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,793
- Lot better than sitting home watching TV.
- [Daniel laughs]

254
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,546
- A beer?
- Root beer.

255
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,884
Finest sarsaparilla
with notes of ginger and clove.

256
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,343
Yeah.

257
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,307
Uh, you wouldn't know anyone with
a German shepherd to give away, would you?

258
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,018
[chuckles] Nope.

259
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,897
I, uh, I need one
to try out for the K9 unit.

260
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,984
Don't tell Zarella you heard this from me,

261
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,863
but you don't need a German shepherd.
Not technically.

262
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,699
I've seen it before, up in Mass.

263
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:12,161
See, what you're needing
is a young, good-sized dog

264
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,288
who's curious,

265
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,498
and agile, and has spirit.

266
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,920
And costs nothing.

267
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,588
[chuckles]

268
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,756
Shoot.

269
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,383
[dogs barking]

270
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,349
Hi. Um...

271
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,893
I'm looking for a German shepherd.

272
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,437
You lost one, or are you hoping to adopt?

273
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,065
[chucking] Um, adopt. Adopt. Sorry.

274
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,984
Contact info here.

275
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,861
Oh.

276
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,531
Um, okay.

277
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,034
Uh...

278
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,788
We don't get many purebreds.

279
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,373
Could be a year or more.

280
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,124
Um...

281
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,544
All right. Know what?
Thank you. I'm sorry, but...

282
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,254
We got a lot of great dogs.

283
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,716
I mean, let me take you out back.
Take a look. You never know.

284
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,260
Yeah, all right. Thank you.

285
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,346
[dog barking]

286
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,100
[dogs barking echoing]

287
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,939
[dog panting]

288
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,150
No name tag?

289
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,945
Oh, yeah. That's so weird.

290
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,073
[dog whimpers]

291
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,742
[Pat chuckles]

292
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,120
- This one just gets to me.
- How old?

293
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,913
A little more than a year.

294
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,125
[laughs]

295
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,460
- Smart?
- Half Border collie.

296
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:47,339
There's one named Chaser on YouTube
that knows the names of 1,000 objects.

297
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,510
- You think he could be a K9 dog?
- She could be anything.

298
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,806
- [barking]
- I know, I know.

299
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,433
Come here. Fetch it. Fetch it.

300
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,272
Ruby, right here. Fetch it.

301
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,401
Bring it to me.

302
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,367
[growls playfully]

303

[barks]

304
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,246
[Daniel] Ruby. Ruby. Ruby.

305
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,664
Come here! Come here! Come here!

306
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,125
Bring it to me.
Bring it here. Bring it here.

307
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,130
Good girl. Come here. Bring it to me.

308
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,008
[chuckling] Good girl. All right, ready?

309
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,428
- [barking]
- Ruby. Ready? Good girl. I know. I know.

310
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,388
You ready? Come on, come on, come on.

311
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,681
Come on.

312
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,059
Oh, Ruby. Ruby. Ruby!

313
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,563
Come here.
Come here, Ruby. Bring it to me.

314
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,774
Here. Here. Good girl.

315
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,485
Thank you. Thank you.

316
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,611
[laughs]

317
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,031
Good girl. Thank you.

318
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,824
She's special.

319
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,330
So, are there forms to fill out?
Or... how does this work?

320
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,585
[Rick] So she's fixed.
She's had her shots.

321
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,105
Anything else you'd like
to ask about her? Like, her history?

322
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,129
Uh...

323
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,884
I think, uh, you know,
what I see is what I get.

324
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,511
She was a street dog.

325
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,388
Used to scrapping to survive.

326
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,640
All right. Cool.

327
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,143
She's gonna be the first shelter dog
to make the K9 unit.

328
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,228
Um...

329
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,230
Okay.

330
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,773
[Rick laughs]

331
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,691
She's a handful.

332
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,237
Uh, you know, I like a challenge.

333
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,781
- That's for you.
- [Rick] Thank you kindly.

334
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,825
Know what? This is for you.

335
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,701
Oh! Thanks.

336
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,412
- Some food here.
- Okay. Thank you.

337
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,581
There's goodness in you, okay?

338
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,376
Don't be afraid to let it show.

339
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,003
[Rick] Here we go.

340
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,257
- Oh. Wow! Okay... [laughs]
- [Rick] Yep.

341
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,634
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's it.

342
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,844
I'm just kidding. All right.

343
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,846
- All right.
- [Pat] All right.

344
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,931
[Daniel] Thank you. Have a good one.

345
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,558
- Thank you.
- Get the door for you.

346
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,641
[Daniel chuckles]

347
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,853
- There you go. All right.
- [Daniel] Hold on.

348
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,355
- [Rick] See ya.

[Rick exhales]

351
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:15,529
- She's going with him. That's a good sign.
- [Rick] Yeah, it's good.

352
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,952
[Rick sighs]

353
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,831
I'd fall apart if I got
that attached to every animal here.

354
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,379
- It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
- [sniffles, laughs]

355
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,300
All right, Ruby. You ready?

356

[laughs] All right. Hold on.

357
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,889

- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

359
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,310
You wanted to know the plan.
This is the plan.

Ruby, hey.

00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,116
Ruby, no.

366
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,287
Okay, Ruby. No. Out... Outside.

367
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,456
Uh-uh. Outside.

368
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,333
I'm sorry, honey.

369
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,919
Has Zarella ever taken
a shelter dog in the K9 unit?

370
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,420
Not yet, no.

371
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,256
Ruby, come on. Come on. Hey!

372
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,301
All right. Come on. Come on.

373

Ah! Ruby did that.

[sighs] Yeah. Yeah.

375
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,145
Oh no, honey. No. Not near there.

376
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,482
Yeah, we're gonna be
doing this for a while, aren't we?

377
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,567
Yeah, Dad's tired, so...

378
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,653
Where you going, bud?

379
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,948
- Where you going?
- [Finn] Read the book.

380
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,391
You want... The book's right here.

381
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,367
[Finn mumbles]

382
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,870
Different book? You need
to pick a different book? All right.

383
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,372
[playful music playing]

384
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,290
Hey, Ruby. Ah!

[dog food clattering]

387
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,806
Okay, Ruby, come on. Good girl.

388
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,517
- Wait. No.
- No, no, no. No!

No!

- Hey! No, no, no, no, no.
- [Daniel] Ruby. Ruby.

- Scoot. Yeah. Good girl.
- [Melissa] What are you doing?

395
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,743
She's like a foster kid.
She needs structure and stability.

396
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,079
[Melissa] You read this?

397
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,040
- Skimmed it, yeah.
- Uh-huh.

398
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,712
I'm so happy about the baby.

399

[laughs]

400
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,425
Me too. But not about the dog.

401
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,968
Look, she's clever.

402
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,803
She has raw talent.

403
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,265
No! Off! Get off!

Come on. Come on.

407
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,400
- I just need to bond with her.
- I know. Maybe just bond out there.

00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,651
Yeah, all right.

409
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,862

Come on. No.

413

- Off, off, off!
- I'm sorry, Mel.

414
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,372
Come on, Ruby. Please. Come on, let's go.

415
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,626
- Yeah.
- [Ruby snarls playfully]

416
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,549
Okay, Ruby. Your water.

417
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,552
Okay.

All right.

421
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,691
She'll come around, all right?

422
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,986
She'll come around.

423
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,659
He's sleeping with her?

424
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,871
[barking]

425
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,333

[guffaws]

427

[Finn crying]

431
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:20,023
He's lost his monkey.
It's probably out there somewhere.

432
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,149
[Finn] Monks.

433

[Finn] Wow.

437
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,949
The last 18.5 hours
have felt like an eternity.

00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,202
- [Ruby barking]
- [Daniel] Mm.

439
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,787
[Daniel] Mel.

440
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,707
That's amazing. Mel!

441
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,544
Honey, I... I can't. It's too much.

442
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,588
No, yeah, I'm gonna take her
to an obedience class this morning.

443
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,674
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,885
Yeah. I just need to, um,
find one and sign her up.

445
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,431
[trainer] Perfect. Perfect.
Keep them close.

446
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,514
Stop.

00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,350
Wonderful.

Come on. We're going to the library first.
We're going to the library.

[Daniel] Oh boy.

451
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,025
Sorry. I'm late.

452
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,610

[dogs yapping and barking]

456
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,743
[trainer] Your dog is aggressive.

457
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,704
It needs socialization.

[snarling, barking]

459
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,708
Yeah.

460
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,545
She doesn't need a class.
She needs medication.

- [barks]
- Ruby! Sorry! Sorry!

462
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,842

Hey. You see those dogs out there?

466
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,692
Ruby, you see those dogs out there?

467
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,778
That could be you.

468
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,908
I thought you'd be grateful

469
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,785
to have a family, a great job.

470
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,164

[sighs]

474
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,546
I thought I was good with animals.

475
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,758
I thought we had a connection.

476
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,842
[knock on window]

477
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,470
Getting out? You gonna join me?

Uh...

00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,348
No, we're, uh...

480
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,851
We're heading back to the shelter.

481
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,521
She's impossible.

482
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,356
You know, she doesn't listen.

483
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,984
She destroys everything.

484
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,696
You're giving up on her.

Uh...

487
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,245
Who's gonna believe in her if you don't?

488
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,791
Who believes in you?

489
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,877
I've been lucky that way.

490
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:51,132
Well, maybe that dog
deserves some of your luck.

[scoffs]

492
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,395
If you'll try,

493
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,855
I'll give you my all.

494
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,985
Ruby, you see this basket?

495
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,529

Where's your leash? Here it is.

499
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,045
Come on.

500
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,756
Wait, Ruby, Ruby.
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.

[Ruby grumbles]

502

I'm sorry, Mel. I couldn't
take her back to the shelter. I...

[growling happily]

504
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,857
[Daniel] She loves it here.

505
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,234
She wants to be our dog.

506
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,153
I know she does.

507
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,654
[Ruby barks]

508
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:56,948
You do?

- I realized something.
- What?

510
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,539
She reminds me of you.

511
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,124
Of me?

512
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,293
- I'm nothing like her.
- You are.

513
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:12,130
You're always busy, always enthusiastic,
going a mile a minute.

514
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,174
Maybe all she needs is routine.

515
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,509
Unconditional love.

Monks.

520
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,575
She needs to be a family dog first
and a K9 dog second.

521
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,286
- She can be both.
- Okay.

[whining continues]

529
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,226
I don't know if I can take it.

530
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,477
It's heartbreaking.

531
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,732
These sites say I've to be the alpha male,
but there are two approaches to training.

532
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,777
Positive with rewards,
or negative with punishment.

533
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,363
[Melissa] Mmm.

534
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,074
Hmm.

535
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,327
The positive one only. Ever.

536
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,789
And make sure Ruby knows what you want.

537
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,624
[Ruby whining]

538
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,711
[Finn] Don't be sad, Ruby. Don't be sad.

539
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,425
- Don't be sad, Ruby.
- [chuckles] I... I can't.

540
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,054
You didn't want to pee, huh? Come on.

541
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:45,347
Did she go?

542
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,517
[Daniel] Um...

543
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,018
[Ruby urinating]

544
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,145
She did.

545
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,480
Just now.

546
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,944
I think she's claiming this as her home.

547
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,072
- [Melissa] Oh, is that what she's doing?
- I believe so.

548
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,075
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

549
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,331
You're embarrassing me.
And you're embarrassing yourself.

550
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,292
But you don't even care.

551
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,375
[spraying]

00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,503

[Daniel urinating]

554
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,761
[Daniel] See, Ruby? We do this outside.

555
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,889
Huh? Wanna give it a try?

556
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,598
Go ahead.

557
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,477
[Ruby sniffing]

558
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,520
[Daniel] All right, what do you think?

559
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,858
Yeah. Smell that?

560
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,651
[Ruby sniffing]

561
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,531
Good dog!

562
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,451
Good girl! Yeah, you did it!

563
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,411
I can't believe that worked.

564
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,288
- All right, sit.
- [growls happily]

565
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,206
Sit.

566
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,541
Okay, all right. One thing at a time.

567
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,211
You want this? Want your stick?

568
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,421
[laughs] Yeah. You want your stick?

569
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,221
[snarling softly]

00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,061

[chuckles]

573
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,377
Which one of you jokers took my panini?

574
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,804
- Hey.
- Hey.

575
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,098
I'd like you to see something.

576
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,183
It's off the kitchen video camera.

577
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:53,934
[Daniel] Okay.

578
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:56,479

[paws pattering]

580
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,034
You owe me a meatball panini, O'Neil.

581
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,118
Yes, Sarge.

582
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,666
- [whimpering]
- Ruby, come on. No. Come on.

All right, stay. Stay.

584
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,252
Stay.

Ruby. Ruby.

[barking continues]

589
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,975
Be the solution.

590
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:35,977
Not the problem.

591
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,104
Please, Ruby.

592
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,289
[clicks]

593
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,792
[clicks]

<i>At this point,
we're just trying to condition your dog.</i>

595

<i>- Click means reward.</i>
- [clicks]

596
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:10,011
<i>So what you do now is reward your dog
for doing what you want.</i>

597
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,387
<i>Right? Yes.</i>

598
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,848
<i>It's saying, "Yes, I like what you did."</i>

599
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:14,974
<i>"Good dog."</i>

600
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,145
<i>Soon your dog will be able to perform
the commands without the click at all.</i>

601
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,858
Sit.

602
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,152
Sit, please.

603
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,531
Sit, Ruby.

604
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,574
Sit.

605
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,702
Sit down.

606
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,413
Ruby, sit down.

607
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,916
[low voice] Sit down!

608
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
[normal voice] Sit.

609
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,130
[high-pitched voice] Maybe I'm deaf.

610
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,509
Or maybe I'm pretending to be deaf.

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,594
[door opens]

612
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,015
- Mel. Can you hear this?
- [clicking]

613
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,559
- 'Cause it's not working.
- Maybe it's the reward.

614
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,773
Hmm.

Hi. Do you remember me?

619
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,037
I... I took Ruby home.

620
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,540
She's not responding to clicker training,

621
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,875
and I... I was hoping for some advice.

622
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,754
- You're not bringing her back?
- No.

623
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,091
Raw hot dog.
She will do anything for raw hot dog.

624
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,884
I... I should have told you.

625
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,594
Raw hot dog? All right, good.

626
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,140
Uh, yeah.
That's all I needed to know, so thank you.

627
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,223
Thanks.

628
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,103
The taller the hat, the closer to God.

Good girl. Okay.

632
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,322

Pick it up.

00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:28,106
All right!

[barks]

657
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,002
I could hire you out to the power company.

658
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,587
I could hire you both out.

659
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,671
[Daniel laughs]

- [Melissa] Ruby ready for tomorrow?
- She has to be.

662
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,264
Can she sit and stay?

663
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,350
- Everything but.
- Uh-oh.

664
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,643
- Just like you.
- [barks]

665
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:07,313
- I'm sitting. I'm staying.
- But you're about to go do something.

670
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,038
Maybe just get up.

All right. Come here, Rubes.

674
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,065
Yeah. Good girl.

00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,695
[chuckles] She loves that.

676
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,286

I have faith in you.

680
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:21,554
You need to have faith in yourself.

681
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,682
Thank you.

[Daniel] Come on.

687
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,004
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay. Hey. Good.

688
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,881
Sit. Sit. Good.

689
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,676
Morning.

690
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,599
Welcome to the tryouts
for this year's K9 academy.

691
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,604
Who do we have there?

692
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,397
[whimpers]

693
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,399
Um... Ruby.

694
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,776
Welcome, Ruby.

695
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,240
All right, dogs in the pen
while we get started inside.

696
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,829
Now, you're not trying out
for the K9 unit today.

697
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,582
You're trying out for my class,

698
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:35,294
which may or may not
qualify you to be a K9 unit officer.

699
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,838
If you are accepted,

700
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,050
these will be six weeks
of rigorous training.

701
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,971
Then you must pass
a final exam for certification,

702
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,975
which certifies you to work
in a K9 unit here or in another state.

703
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,226
A final point.

704
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,485
Your dog must have the right temperament.

705
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,029
So must you.

706
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,119
Search and rescue requires
calm focus and special compassion.

707
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,623
You will deal with people
who are missing loved ones

708
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,125
who might not return.

709
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,795
Ask yourself now,

710
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,923
is this work for you?

711
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:26,137
Those of you who are sure,
come on outside. Let's see how you do.

712
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,351
Boden, come on up.

713
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,728
[Boden]<i> Platz.</i>

714
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,397
<i>Fuss.</i>

715
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,151
<i>Schnell! Schnell! Schnell!</i>

716
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,570
Ha!

717
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,488
Rather good, Renny.

718
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,660
Good boy, Renn.

719
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,744
Up!

720
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,375
- O'Neil, you're up.
- [Daniel] Okay. Let's go, Ruby. Come on.

721
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,462
Ruby, sit.

722
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,212
Down.

723
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,883
Heel.

724
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,680
Good girl. Good girl.

725
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,392
- Good girl.
- [female officer] Yay, Ruby!

726
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,270
Come on.

727
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,230
Good girl. Good girl.

728
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,900
Come on. Come on. Yep, yep, yep.

729
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,444
Good girl! Come on.

730
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,113
All right.

731
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,615
Good Ruby. Come on, up!

732
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,869
Good job! Come on, come on!

733
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,536
Up!

734
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,331
Good girl!

735
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,041
Come on. Come on.

736
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,625
Come on.

737
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,543
Sit.

738
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,966
[Zarella] Tell her to stay.

739
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,972
When I tell you to stay,

740
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,100
you cannot move, no matter what.

741
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,102
Stay!

742
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,562
[watch beeps]

743
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,856
[tense music playing]

744
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,442
[Zarella]
Pace out ten feet. Do not turn around.

745
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,697
I had to drop off Finn at my mom's.
What'd I miss?

746
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,865
They're passing.

747
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,412
She still has to stay for five minutes
with Daniel ten feet away.

748
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,580
Oh boy.

749
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:20,751
[Ruby whines]

750
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,753
[softly] Stay. Please stay.

751
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,595
[inaudible]

752
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,598
[inaudible]

753
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,479
[barks]

754
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,656
[tense music continues]

755
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,249
[beeps]

756
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,626
- Five minutes.
- Yay!

757
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,004
Good girl! Good girl!

758
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,922
[female officer laughing]

759
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,006
[Sarge clears throat]

760
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,843
Yeah, good girl. All right, come on.

761
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,430
Now we test all teams

762
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,682
for drive and a good nose.

763
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,769
Search and rescue is...

764
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,605
Hey, Ruby! Sorry about that.

765
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,565
...serious work for us.

766
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,984
- Hot dogs?
- This is not good.

767
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,236
At least it's not a panini.

768
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,988
- No, hey
- But for K9s,

769
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,450
- each mission is a game.
- Stop. Stop.

770
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,869
- Food is what motivates dogs.
- [Daniel] Stop, stop. Down.

771
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,662
That and pleasing you.

772
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,998
- [barking]
- Hey. Stop. Stop.

773
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,001
Just one piece.

774
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:48,339
Treats are for a job well done.
Not for bribing your dog to behave.

775
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,008
[Ruby grumbles]

776
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,929
Okay. I know this
will be new to all of you.

777
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,389
I have hidden a human tooth.

778
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,100
Considerate it cadaver material.

779
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,187
It's an exercise
in searching for a dead body.

780
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,314
Today, I want each of you

781
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:09,235
to scent train your K9
to seek and find that tooth.

782
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,075
Me first? A single tooth?

783
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,700
All right.

784
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,332
You're gonna teach her to do this
using a unique command.

785
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,001
- "Look for it."
- Okay.

786
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,796
- [Daniel] Stop. Stop it, Ruby.
- [whining]

787
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,049
- [whines, barks]
- Ruby, come on. Ruby, stop.

788
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,885
Your dog's not using her thinking brain.
She's not focused.

789
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,763
- We'll come back to you. Back in line.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

790
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,936
Peter, your dog's had
some minimal search training.

791
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,729
Let's show by example.

792
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,360
- Tell him to search.
- [Peter] Okay.

793
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:52,820
Look for it. Look for it.

794
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,115
- How does he know what he's looking for?
- It takes time.

795
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,242
But eventually he will learn

796
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,619
to associate that particular command

797
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,330
with finding cadaver material,
once you click and reward him.

798
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,957
[dog sniffing]

799
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,458
[whines loudly]

800
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,252
- Ruby!
- Control that K9!

801
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,211
Yeah. Ruby.

802
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,975
[Zarella] Deepen your voice.
Be commanding.

803
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,065
[Daniel in deep voice] Ruby!

804
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,215
[normal voice] Sorry.

805
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,175
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here.

806
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,719
Ruby.

807
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,221
Ruby.

808
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,514
[deep voice] Ruby!

809
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,641
[normal voice] Ruby!

810
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,854
[Ruby barking loudly]

811
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,397
That's a hell of a bark.

812
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:32,192
Okay, I want you to tell your dogs
to search for him.

813
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,153
He's a moving target. Let's go.

814
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,238
[dogs barking]

815
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,790
[Daniel] Ruby! Ruby!

816
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,335
Ruby!

817
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,629
[panting]

818
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,465
Okay.

819
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,344
Oh boy.

820
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,767
Ruby.

821
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,937
Hey, no! No, no, no, no. Hey.

822
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,315
Ruby, put it down.

823
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,484
Put the stick down!

824
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,943
[insects buzzing]

825
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,529
- Ruby.
- [Zarella] Good job, everyone.

826
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,239
- Go ahead and reward.
- Ruby.

827
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,660
- Put it down.
- What's she playing with there?

828
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,745
- Um...
- [loud buzzing]

829
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,039
[snarling]

830
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,920
Oh! Retreat! Retreat!

831
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,797
[Peter] Run! Run!

832
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,091
Hey. Ruby.

833
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,634
Come here.

834
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,928
- [buzzing]
- Ow. Ow!

835
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,139
Ow. Come on. Come on.

836
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,686
[groans]

837
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:55,234
It's not Ruby's fault.
She's not bred for this work.

838
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,571
[Daniel] She's half Border collie,
one of the smartest breeds.

839
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,032
She hasn't had all the advantages.

840
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,827
She's all over the place.
She's not focusing on the tasks at hand.

841
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,704
We're not in the class, right?

842
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,123
[sighs]

843
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:14,169
- Did everybody else qualify?
- You're good at so many other things.

844
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,756
- You gotta be realistic.
- I am.

845
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:19,882
Sorry.

846
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,931
[exhales]

847
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,649
So what next?

848
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,818
I'm sorry, Mel.

849
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,571
I wanted this for both of us.

850
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,823
For all of us.

851
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,451
A better life.

852
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,082
You know I have a thing for superheroes?

853
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,544
You wanna be one?

854
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,421
[chuckles]

855
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,840
Dogs have their noses.

856
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,510
I always thought if I had
a partner with a superpower,

857
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,387
it would cover for my weaknesses.

858
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,140
[emotional music playing]

859
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,478
In trooper academy, you made up
for dyslexia and hyperactivity

860
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,688
with all-nighters and books on tape.

861
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,817
Bigger guys than you
hit you hard in the boxing ring.

862
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,694
You would not drop.

863
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:26,074
Then you shattered your kneecap
just before that mandatory race,

864
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,827
and you hobbled
the entire two miles in pain.

865
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,287
I came in last.

866
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,540
You finished.

867
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,421
Maybe it's not in the plan.

868
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,258
I can't see a path forward from here.

869
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:48,055
And sheer willpower's not gonna work.
I could push myself but not Ruby.

870
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,310
Yeah.

871
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,356
A-ticka-ticka-ticka. A-ticka-ticka.

872
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,439
Come here...

873
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,691
[Finn babbling]

874
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,109
I know. I know.

875
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,321
House.

876
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,949
I come bearing gifts.

877
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:11,453
- [Daniel] Are we having a barbecue?
- [Melissa] You chose a dog just like you.

878
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,164
Yeah, you've said that. More than once.

879
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:17,459
You say you hated school.
You didn't want to sit at your desk.

880
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,838
- You wanted to run around, not read.
- Reading's not my thing.

881
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,757
Teachers underestimated you,
but you have always been smart.

882
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,094
No... You didn't get to the point
where you get to the point.

883
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,221
You would've done better homeschooled.

884
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,807
Didn't really have that back then.

885
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,519

[gasps] Hi, little man. Oh!

893
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,806
Maybe K9 school's not for Ruby.

894
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,851
Maybe what she needs
is one-on-one learning

895
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:20,022
with a teacher who respects
her unique, special abilities.

896
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,525
More fun, less work,

more quiet figuring things out,
less yelling, right? No bullies.

that final exam for K9 certification.

Right. I'll use all my vacation days.

Doubt there's an audiobook
for this, though.

905

For a missing person, you wouldn't
give Ruby something of theirs to sniff?

926
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,992
No. She's learning
to seek human scent only.

927
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,675
So she'll know what to search for
based on the command I give her.

[sighs] Yeah.

1068
00:58:55,949 --> 00:59:00,161
Hey, did you know if humans disappeared,
the planet would be better off?

1069
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,330
But if ants disappeared,

1070
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,332
the whole thing
would come apart at the seams.

1071
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,710
You're not listening.

00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:11,673
Sam, everything's the same,
except for my uniform.

1073
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,676
The senior K9 teams
are seizing cash from drug dealers

1074
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:16,261
and apprehending suspects. And...

1075
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,346
I've been sitting on my hands for...

1076
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,766
months. The leaves have changed.

1077
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,978

That's Zarella.
There's a search down city.

1084
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,875
The senior teams are on other calls.

1085
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,254
- Text me when you find the stash.
- No. It's not stolen stuff.

1086
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,256
It's a murder victim.

1087
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,508
I gotta go. Ruby.

[Daniel] Don't let me down.

1097
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,457
Police have a suspect in custody.

1098
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,260
There's a missing person
presumed dead here.

1099
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,001
Right.

1100
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,797

[Sarge] What you got?

1107
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,415
Nothing.

I'm so sorry.

1124
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,746
No, I'm the stupid jerk
Zarella always thought.

1125
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,874
A guy who doesn't know
his own limitations or his dog's.

How he forgives.

She's gone, Mel. It's my fault.

1156
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:24,253
I pushed her. I stressed her.

1157
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,631
Then I blamed her for not performing.

1158
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,758
I didn't think she could do it,
and then she didn't.

1159
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,968
I mean, so what if she's not a K9 dog?

1160
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,554
She's still a great dog.

Buried under the deck,
covered in three inches of cement.

I lost my driver's license. Weak eyes.
I need to try that Uber thing.

Where's Ruby?

1222
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,631
I, uh, wish I knew.
I've been looking all day.

1223

Dogs don't leave a good thing.

1224
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,390
I messed up.

1225
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,936
I didn't trust her.
I... I let pressure get to me.

1226
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:15,025
I did to her what people do to me.
Underestimate me, count me out.

1227
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,988
- That's why I work harder.
- To prove 'em wrong.

Sure.
