1
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:36,686
- Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,904
And thank you for coming out today.

3
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:46,873
The play is called "Our Town."

4
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,044
The name of the town is

5
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,513
Governor's Corner Square, New Hampshire.

6
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:01,738
Well, I best show you how our town lies.

7
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:34,588
- Really, George, you look, well,

8
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,468
honestly, I'm shocked at
how well you're holding up.

9
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:00,724
- Call me a Pinocchio 'cause
I got no strings on me.

10
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:03,228
- You mean you're really over it?

11
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,232
- My wife thinks she's wounding me,

12
00:05:05,234 --> 00:05:09,242
but in fact she's making me
stronger than ever before.

13
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:12,457
- A tribute to the modern man.

14
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:21,473
I was gonna drink that.

15
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:25,022
- George, you're not turning in, are you?

16
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:28,236
I just wanted to say goodnight
if you're headed to bed.

17
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:29,405
- Well, I'm heading to bed.

18
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:30,284
- Then goodnight.

19
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:35,877
- Afternoon ladies.

20
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,129
- Bonsoir, petite fouine.

21
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:39,217
- I can't believe our
family's committed such a sin.

22
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,052
- Mother's affair?

23
00:05:40,054 --> 00:05:41,304
- Mother's party. I'm aggrieved.

24
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,473
- Didn't you plan this thing?

25
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,185
- Yes, but the guests are entirely hers.

26
00:05:44,187 --> 00:05:46,941
Utterly boring. Utterly sinful.

27
00:05:46,943 --> 00:05:47,776
- Feel free to see a priest,

28
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:48,820
if you're so banged up about it.

29
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:49,780
- Can you confess on
behalf of your family?

30
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,951
- I should hope so
or you are going to hell.

31
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:52,788
- Ugh!

32
00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:59,173
- Where's she going?

33
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:00,593
- To break something, I'm sure.

34
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:01,554
She's been in a worse way

35
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:03,223
ever since mother started screwing Jimmy.

36
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:05,310
- Hm, she'll get over it.

37
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:06,605
- Mother? No.

38
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:08,901
Jimmy's a real John, if
you know what I mean.

39
00:06:08,903 --> 00:06:09,862
- Annette.

40
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:10,947
- Over it.

41
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,116
Oh, come on now, Jack.

42
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,995
I would've thought you
knew us better by now.

43
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:14,830
- You too?

44
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,709
- Family habit.

45
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:57,206
- Whoa.

46
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,291
Where'd you get all these?

47
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,047
- Mrs. Baldwin next door.

48
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,343
- Ah, don't you think she'll miss them?

49
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:04,640
- She hasn't yet.

50
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:19,545
- Well, hi-de-do.

51
00:07:20,589 --> 00:07:21,757
Who's this?

52
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,427
- Good afternoon.

53
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:25,888
I'm looking for the man of the house.

54
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,266
- George or Jimmy?

55
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:29,147
- Ooh. Is this multiple choice?

56
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,652
- Should I call the police?

57
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:33,488
- Madam?

58
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:38,455
You would call the cops on
the evening's entertainment?

59
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,708
- Entertainment?

60
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,379
No one said anything about entertainment.

61
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:43,676
And I planned this thing!

62
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:46,346
- Wait, weren't
you just complaining

63
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:47,641
about the party being boring?

64
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:48,475
- I was complaining

65
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:50,022
about the party-goers being boring.

66
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:15,155
Entertainment, you said?

67
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:18,076
- So I did.

68
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:20,873
- Well, well, well, this
party's getting less dull

69
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,752
by the minute.

70
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:25,802
Do I know you?

71
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:34,360
- Find yourself in the back alleys often?

72
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,450
- You aren't homeless?

73
00:08:38,452 --> 00:08:40,122
- Unhoused is how you say it now.

74
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:45,715
- What's with the goggles?
- Well, we had to do something

75
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:47,596
while we waited for the entertainment.

76
00:08:48,514 --> 00:08:49,848
- So you've been expecting me?

77
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,810
- I always expect to be entertained.

78
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:53,063
- Must be nice.

79
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,608
- It's dreadful, actually.

80
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,152
From pleasure to pleasure without a trace

81
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:57,154
of melancholic recess

82
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:59,158
to look inside one's soul for reflection.

83
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,789
You must know yourself very well.

84
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,840
- Melancholia is as much a distraction.

85
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:08,803
- Oh, he's good.

86
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:13,687
- Wow.

87
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:15,482
What all this food for?

88
00:09:15,484 --> 00:09:17,444
- Oh, well, it's juicy news, Norman.

89
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:19,031
My parents have been married for 30 years,

90
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,576
maybe not happily, but married, you know.

91
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:23,166
And the craziest thing
happened only two nights ago.

92
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:26,045
Jimmy, who my mother's been sleeping with

93
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:27,841
for quite some time, father's assistant,

94
00:09:27,843 --> 00:09:30,680
former assistant, moved in.

95
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:32,182
- Can you believe this?

96
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:35,274
After all this time. Love.

97
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:47,505
- So it's a housewarming
party for your mother's lover

98
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:49,174
at your father's house?

99
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:51,095
- Well, it's as much her
house as it is his, Norman.

100
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:52,932
As much as it is my house or Sylvia's.

101
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:54,605
Don't get caveman about it.

102
00:09:56,232 --> 00:09:57,652
Speak of the devil.

103
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,952
- Now, who's this?

104
00:10:02,954 --> 00:10:05,081
- This is Norman.

105
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:06,501
- You haven't seen your sister?

106
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:08,046
I know she went running off somewhere.

107
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:10,801
- I haven't seen her
since Norman appeared.

108
00:10:10,803 --> 00:10:12,513
- Annette, be civil.

109
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:14,477
Enjoy the party, Norman.

110
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:18,276
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

111
00:10:20,405 --> 00:10:21,489
- Where's she really going?

112
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:23,619
- To screw Jimmy on the
front lawn for all I know.

113
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:24,455
Hard to keep up.

114
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:31,008
- Well, see it wasn't money
you were after, after all.

115
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,346
Silly of me to ignore a man's first need.

116
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:35,141
- Here's an idea, Sylvia,

117
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:38,356
why don't you shove a meatball
in the pretty little mouth

118
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:39,402
and shut the hell up.

119
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:42,322
- No food for you, Annette?

120
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:44,703
Don't wanna throw it up in
front of your new boy toy?

121
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:45,663
- Who's that?

122
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:46,497
- You.

123
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:47,332
- No, no.

124
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:48,544
Who is that?

125
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,052
- Not the Tims.

126
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:55,558
Daddy's partners.

127
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:15,432
- Where's George?

128
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,267
- I don't know if you've noticed,

129
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:19,773
but we're having a bit of a get together.

130
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:21,777
- Ah, we have noticed.

131
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,364
And what's with the no invite?

132
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,410
- No party worth going to has invites.

133
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:29,542
- We just want a word with George.

134
00:11:29,544 --> 00:11:30,836
- Well, he's unavailable right now,

135
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:32,715
so you'll have to take
it up with his assistant.

136
00:11:32,717 --> 00:11:33,550
- Jimmy?

137
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:35,303
- Different assistant.

138
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:37,140
New assistant.

139
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:37,977
Norman.

140
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:44,323
- Yes.

141
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,327
- This is your father's assistant?

142
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:48,206
- That's right.

143
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,170
- Kind of dirty for George's taste.

144
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:54,133
- He just did a scene from a play.

145
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:55,176
You wouldn't get it.

146
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:57,723
- Hey, we love the theater.

147
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,351
- Well then make with
the theatrics already.

148
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:00,729
- All right.

149
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:02,817
You think you're pretty clever, eh,

150
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:03,652
Norman, was it?

151
00:12:03,654 --> 00:12:05,113
- Was it?

152
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:08,244
- Anything you can say to my
father, you can say to him.

153
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:09,747
You know what to do, Norman.

154
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:12,210
- Oh, and you tell George
we know what he did.

155
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:15,383
- And we are not happy about it.

156
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:16,220
- Tim.

157
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:20,730
- Um.

158
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,276
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait.

159
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:35,510
- You tell George, next time
we crash more than his party.

160
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:06,277
- Don't leave.

161
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,157
You really add something to this party.

162
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:11,873
- What's that? Humanity?

163
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,169
- I don't think you've
treated me fairly, Norman.

164
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,842
- Oh. Well, excuse me.

165
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:18,677
- I agree.

166
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,056
The behaviors of others was circumspect.

167
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:21,891
Mine was spot on.

168
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,812
- Yeah, and what behaviors are those?

169
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:25,941
- Genuine intrigue.

170
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:27,570
So what if I'm a little spoiled?

171
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:28,907
I'm rich, can't help that.

172
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:32,120
I offered you an invitation to a party

173
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:34,291
on friendliness alone.

174
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:35,418
- Agreed.

175
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,378
And I can assure you,

176
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,634
I can be quite mad at a group of people

177
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:40,053
and myself at the same time.

178
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:42,892
- I don't want you to
be upset with yourself.

179
00:13:42,894 --> 00:13:44,229
- Yes, you do.

180
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,027
- Goodbye.
- For long?

181
00:13:48,446 --> 00:13:49,279
- Forever.

182
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:51,367
- Oh, what's your address?

183
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:52,496
- 2020 Alley Way.

184
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,709
- I'll write!

185
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:35,206
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

186
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:46,018
- Hello Norman.

187
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,940
- This could have been anybody's tent.

188
00:14:50,988 --> 00:14:52,740
- But it wasn't. It was yours.

189
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:54,827
2020 Alley Way, was it?

190
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,455
This is the first tent
I've been in, you know.

191
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:57,373
I mean, street tent.

192
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,211
I've seen them everywhere,
but this is the first.

193
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:01,508
I was just so curious,
I couldn't help myself.

194
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,135
- Sure.

195
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,722
- Here's the thing, Norman.

196
00:15:04,724 --> 00:15:06,183
I feel awful.

197
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,937
I mean, truly awful.

198
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,439
And I can't have our first fight ending

199
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,901
with you walking away that.

200
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:12,195
- First fight?

201
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:13,030
Listen Annette.

202
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:15,159
- I just love the way you say my name.

203
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,704
I could just melt.

204
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:17,957
- Wish you would.

205
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,585
- Let me ask you something.

206
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:21,798
- Okay? Then you'll leave my tent?

207
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,135
- No promises.

208
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:25,891
- Okay?

209
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:28,187
- Why do you live here?

210
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:30,149
How does this happen?

211
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:33,487
- This whole climate thing, you know?

212
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:36,076
I wanted to go green though,
I'm here doing my part.

213
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:37,370
- Oh, quite sensible.

214
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:38,207
- Quite.

215
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:40,838
- You see, Norman,

216
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:44,303
we're going to be seeing
quite a lot of each other.

217
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:46,848
- How do you figure?

218
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,685
- Well...

219
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,860
- Annette, this is your father.

220
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:54,279
I'm recording myself on this machine

221
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:55,448
instead of asking you in person

222
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,368
because I've told your
mother I was going to bed

223
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,663
and it's very important I keep up

224
00:15:58,665 --> 00:15:59,915
the appearance of hostility.

225
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,630
At any rate, that friend
of yours who the Tims hit,

226
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:06,804
tell him I'm hiring him
as my personal assistant.

227
00:16:06,806 --> 00:16:08,017
- He was very impressed.

228
00:16:08,894 --> 00:16:10,938
- With what? How I took a punch?

229
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,900
- Apparently! You're hired!

230
00:16:12,902 --> 00:16:14,194
You're daddy's new assistant.

231
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:16,406
- I don't believe I applied for it.

232
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,910
- Well, if you change your mind,

233
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,789
you'll also wanna change your clothes.

234
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,668
And I do hope that you do.

235
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,379
Change your mind, that is.

236
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:24,590
Norman?

237
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,387
Do you believe in love at first sight?

238
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,361
- No.

239
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:39,287
- Me either.

240
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,795
I'll see you tomorrow, Norman.

241
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:43,123
- Hello?

242
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,464
- I Just had the greatest idea ever.

243
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:51,299
Pen. Pen.

244
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:52,638
Do you have a pen sweet bean?

245
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:07,164
- Good morning, Norman.
- Oh.

246
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,876
Good morning.

247
00:19:08,878 --> 00:19:10,880
- So you came after all.

248
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:11,799
- So I did.

249
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:12,926
- For me?

250
00:19:12,928 --> 00:19:15,055
- For the job, of course.

251
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:16,642
- Of course.

252
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:18,020
- The assistant job.

253
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:19,734
- You're not taking Jimmy's place.

254
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,904
- Your father hiring me.

255
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:24,700
- I do vaguely remember
something like that.

256
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:25,744
- Vaguely?

257
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:27,873
- You're absolutely
the most attractive man

258
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,252
I've ever seen, Norman.

259
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:31,672
- Um, excuse me?

260
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:35,054
- Don't you wanna talk,
get to know each other?

261
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:35,889
- Maybe later.

262
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:37,726
I have just started the job.

263
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:39,353
- Norman, you may not very well believe

264
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:40,397
in love at first sight.

265
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:42,986
- That's what you
remember from last night?

266
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:45,326
- You see, I have a confession to make.

267
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:48,288
You're in love with me.

268
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,338
In fact, you're crazy about me.

269
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:54,010
- Am not.

270
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:58,141
- Didn't you come in here for a pen?

271
00:19:58,143 --> 00:19:59,645
- Hey...

272
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:02,818
You...

273
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,694
Well?

274
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:05,072
- Well.

275
00:20:05,074 --> 00:20:08,538
- Say I was to agree to this
indecent proposal of yours.

276
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,249
- There's nothing indecent
about love, Norman.

277
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,130
- Something very indecent
about a hostage situation.

278
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:15,175
- Not in Stockholm there isn't.

279
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:16,304
- We're non Stockholm.

280
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:22,985
What would a relationship
of this nature entail?

281
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:27,576
- I suspect there's
something happening here.

282
00:20:27,578 --> 00:20:28,412
- Between us?

283
00:20:33,506 --> 00:20:35,090
Okay, you're right.

284
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:36,594
So there is.

285
00:20:36,596 --> 00:20:37,430
- I knew it.

286
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:43,483
- A business agreement.

287
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:45,235
- A contract.

288
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:47,616
- A verbal contract that
I will entertain the idea

289
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:50,957
of being your lover on the
terms that I keep my job.

290
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:08,367
- It's a start.

291
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:18,220
- Your pen.

292
00:21:23,313 --> 00:21:25,276
- Who the fuck are you?

293
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,531
- Be a dear, Sylvia,
and do call the police.

294
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:30,868
We seem to have a strange
assistant in our home.

295
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,204
- Where do I know your face from?

296
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:34,125
- Probably from a wanted poster.

297
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,337
He's probably doing this bit
in every house in the hills.

298
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:38,759
You know they're desperate to work.

299
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:41,347
- You were at the party last night.

300
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:43,519
- So George's new assistant.

301
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:45,690
Well, there you go, Jimmy,
he finally got over you.

302
00:21:45,692 --> 00:21:48,030
- Well, so long as you never do.

303
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:49,823
- Jimmy.

304
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,200
- I see you have a new scheme.

305
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:52,704
- Isn't Norman great?

306
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:53,706
- I'm sorry? Is he not your father?

307
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,501
- Who? Jimmy?

308
00:21:55,503 --> 00:21:56,962
Mother's lover?

309
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:57,839
- Oh my God.

310
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:03,016
- You're the lover?

311
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:03,976
- Look at him.

312
00:22:03,978 --> 00:22:06,230
Little nugget's getting it.

313
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:07,903
- He just moved in with me, dear.

314
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:11,950
- Daddy's office is up the
stairs from the living room.

315
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:13,788
Nice of you to stop in
on breakfast though.

316
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,835
Looks like you've helped the whole family.

317
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:18,506
- Don't be late for work, Norman.

318
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:20,469
He's a very demanding employer.

319
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:31,364
- Norman, you wasteful sod.

320
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:35,247
You ungrateful, meandering
time-wasting sonufabitch.

321
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:36,667
Haul it in, son.

322
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:39,048
We gonna do business or
we gonna do business?

323
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:12,072
What the hell is this?

324
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,496
You work in the movies now, Norm.

325
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:18,333
Doesn't mean you're at the movies.

326
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:19,794
You want popcorn, Norm?

327
00:23:19,796 --> 00:23:22,717
Want me to grab some
Goobers while I'm at it?

328
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:24,303
Did you think this would be the job,

329
00:23:24,305 --> 00:23:27,394
sitting around looking at my hard work?

330
00:23:29,315 --> 00:23:31,484
- What would you like me to do?

331
00:23:31,486 --> 00:23:32,864
- What do I want you to do?

332
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:35,450
- For God's sake, Norm,

333
00:23:35,452 --> 00:23:37,872
you are a personal assistant in Hollywood.

334
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,501
Everything. I want you to do everything.

335
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:41,674
This is the nature of your job.

336
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:46,222
Do you have any idea the kind of nonsense

337
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:49,103
these saps put me through, Norm?

338
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:50,023
Any idea?

339
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,192
- Enlighten me.

340
00:23:52,194 --> 00:23:53,194
- Look at this.

341
00:23:53,196 --> 00:23:54,031
Take a peek.

342
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:57,789
I get two screenplays a
day, every day of the year.

343
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,375
You know why they do it, Norman?

344
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:01,797
Do you know why?

345
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,468
To piss me off, that's why.

346
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,431
Sure, they could email them but look,

347
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:08,892
see how it bulges in the middle?

348
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:11,147
They only put brads in two holes,

349
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,399
but they punched three holes.

350
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:14,320
It's every script, Norman.

351
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:16,827
It's like Chinese water torture.

352
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:25,926
I want you to fix things, Norman.

353
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:28,348
I want you to fix things.

354
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,728
That's what I want from you.

355
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:32,232
Starting with my headache.

356
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:35,278
I take a martini every three hours.

357
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,865
And as you may have noticed,

358
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:39,078
I've been up for longer than three hours.

359
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,002
And yet, no martini.

360
00:24:43,004 --> 00:24:43,921
- You want a martini?

361
00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:44,758
- No.

362
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:48,014
I'd like a perfect martini.

363
00:24:49,225 --> 00:24:51,394
Bring me the perfect martini.

364
00:24:51,396 --> 00:24:53,609
Or don't you ever show
your face here again.

365
00:24:56,114 --> 00:24:57,241
No. Scratch that.

366
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:01,540
God, just do the martini.

367
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,709
I need it.

368
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:03,711
I need it, Norman.

369
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:05,633
I'm stressed and I need it.

370
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,100
- Then Mr. Moffett, you shall have it.

371
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:36,902
- I planned to be there

372
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:39,031
when daddy inevitably sent you
to make the perfect martini,

373
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,366
but Sylvia wanted to try on some wigs

374
00:25:40,368 --> 00:25:41,703
and she really does need
help putting them on,

375
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:42,580
so here we are!

376
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,043
Here we go, the recipe
for a perfect martini:

377
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:45,878
One jigger of gin.

378
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,049
Not one and a half, not two, just one.

379
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:49,093
Half a jigger sweet vermouth.

380
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:50,554
Half an ounce of olive juice.

381
00:25:50,556 --> 00:25:52,349
This recipe is of course
built upon the assumption

382
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,519
you know what a jigger is?

383
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:55,188
Funny word, jigger. I
can't put my finger on it,

384
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,027
but there's something about
that word I don't much like.

385
00:25:58,029 --> 00:25:59,781
And then, you know,
ice, stir, serve, olive.

386
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,116
- Annette, wigs, now!

387
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:03,624
- Good luck, Norman!

388
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:09,301
- About time, isn't it, Norm?

389
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,182
What the hell, Norman?

390
00:26:13,184 --> 00:26:14,729
I told you to make a double.

391
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:19,027
- You wanted two martinis?

392
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:20,154
- Come on, Norm.

393
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:22,827
One for me, one for Jack.

394
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:23,956
I'm not an alcoholic.

395
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,670
Terribly sorry about this.

396
00:26:27,672 --> 00:26:28,507
New hire.

397
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:51,887
- Thanks, Norman.
- Mm-hm.

398
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:58,901
- Could have made yourself one, Norman.

399
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,865
- It's better for
everyone if I don't drink.

400
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:05,411
- You're always welcome
to, just remember that.

401
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:08,042
No shame in a little dependency.

402
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,591
Some folks have God, we have vodka.

403
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,137
- I believe this is yours.

404
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:16,977
- Where in the world did
you come across this?

405
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:17,814
- Your daughter.

406
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:21,485
- You've spent time with
both of my daughters.

407
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:22,613
What do you think of them?

408
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:23,449
Honest opinion.

409
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:27,873
- They're lovely.

410
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,292
- Ah. Both of them?

411
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:31,756
- Mm-hm, in a strictly professional sense.

412
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:34,848
- You bet your ass, strictly
in a professional sense.

413
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:37,350
You listen to me and close,

414
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:39,062
there is nothing but
the professional sense

415
00:27:39,064 --> 00:27:41,735
between you and any of
the women in my family.

416
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:43,072
Do you understand?

417
00:27:43,907 --> 00:27:46,160
- George is still reeling
from the loss of his wife.

418
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:48,456
- Yeah. Loss.

419
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,669
It's Jimmy who'll lose.

420
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:53,257
But I've made my point, haven't I, Norm?

421
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:56,057
The most important thing that
you and I are of one mind.

422
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:59,937
- All right, shut the
fuck up about your wife.

423
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:01,482
Look, last night at the party,

424
00:28:01,484 --> 00:28:03,822
you told me you had my next job for me.

425
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:06,787
- Be my guest.

426
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,963
- "Piss Jug" by Jake Donahue.

427
00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:17,515
- "River Runs East," written
by Gregory Pinkerton.

428
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:22,107
Look George, I thought you had some things

429
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,777
ready to go into production.

430
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:26,783
Okay, I could use the money
sooner rather than later.

431
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,870
- We could all use the money, Jack.

432
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:30,498
I could use $21 million if you happen

433
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,333
to have it lying around.

434
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,711
- Don't tell me the wells run dry.

435
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:36,886
- I wonder, Norman, do you
think of a ringing office phone

436
00:28:36,888 --> 00:28:40,853
falls under the purview
of an office assistant?

437
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:42,648
Or is it a boss kind of thing?

438
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,861
Maybe I can answer it.

439
00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:48,537
- Honolulu Lullaby, by Pinky Dinkler.

440
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:55,381
- Listen here, you
monstrously insignificant

441
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:57,385
embryo of a man.

442
00:28:57,387 --> 00:29:00,224
If this deal sinks, we all sink.

443
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:02,020
But you'll sink further.

444
00:29:02,022 --> 00:29:03,314
You understand?

445
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:07,948
You'll sink so far, the titanic
will look like the surface

446
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,409
from where you are.

447
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:10,453
- Please hold.

448
00:29:10,455 --> 00:29:11,497
- How hard is it to
get a picture made these days?

449
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,083
- I'm not made of money. Jack.

450
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,379
- You practically shit money, George.

451
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:16,591
- Then let me finish my coffee

452
00:29:16,593 --> 00:29:19,471
and you can pick the
gold for my droppings.

453
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:20,974
- Excuse me, sir.

454
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,561
- What is it, Norman?

455
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:23,855
- I believe it's for you.

456
00:29:23,857 --> 00:29:25,316
- Of course it's for me.

457
00:29:25,318 --> 00:29:27,028
They're all for me.

458
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,532
It's my office.

459
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,702
What did they say?

460
00:29:30,704 --> 00:29:33,165
That's the job, telling me what they said.

461
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:34,543
Not that they're all for me.

462
00:29:34,545 --> 00:29:38,050
- Listen, here, you
monstrously insignificant

463
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:39,344
embryo of a man.

464
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:41,766
- Damn, Norm, I didn't
mean anything by it.

465
00:29:41,768 --> 00:29:43,310
- Verbatim, sir.

466
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:44,145
- I see.

467
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:44,981
- Start.

468
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,151
If this sinks, we all sink,

469
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:48,404
but you'll sink even further.

470
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:49,239
You understand?

471
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:51,869
You'll sink so far the Titanic
will look like the surface

472
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:53,205
from where you are.

473
00:29:53,207 --> 00:29:54,042
End.

474
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,587
- Some Humphrey Bogart stuff right there.

475
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:58,967
What do you think it means?

476
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:01,848
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll
call 'em back, Norm.

477
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,975
- I'll take anything, George.

478
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:04,060
Even a commercial.
- Thank you,

479
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:04,979
Mr. Moffett will call you back
at his earliest convenience.

480
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:06,317
- Wait, wait, wait.

481
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:09,446
- I'm laying low for a few months.

482
00:30:09,448 --> 00:30:10,489
And when that's done,

483
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:12,118
you'll be the first one I call.

484
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,207
- You sodden, salty, crusted old...

485
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:17,128
Who is that? That breathing?

486
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:20,301
You tell me if you're
recording this, George.

487
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:22,182
- Stupid little pigeon man.

488
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:29,319
- Who was it?

489
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:30,824
- Pigeon salesman.

490
00:30:31,826 --> 00:30:33,329
- We don't need any more.

491
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:39,507
- Am I to assume these are the Tims?

492
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:40,967
- One of 'em.

493
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,679
Who's this?

494
00:30:42,681 --> 00:30:44,015
- Norman.

495
00:30:44,017 --> 00:30:45,476
- Norman.

496
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:47,566
- Hang it up Norman. We got business.

497
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:52,658
Look, go through this
mountain for me Jack.

498
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,868
And by the time you're through,

499
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,624
we'll have enough money
for three pictures.

500
00:30:56,626 --> 00:30:57,670
- You owe me, George.

501
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:14,033
Believe that's for you.

502
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:14,871
Clean it up.

503
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:21,214
- The rights, Norman.

504
00:31:21,216 --> 00:31:23,429
We know about the rights.

505
00:31:24,974 --> 00:31:25,974
- Poor sap.

506
00:31:25,976 --> 00:31:27,686
Wins one South by South West

507
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:31,485
and thinks I owe him
a swing at the Oscars.

508
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:33,071
Who was on the phone?

509
00:31:33,073 --> 00:31:33,907
- The Tims.

510
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:35,409
They know about the rights.

511
00:31:35,411 --> 00:31:39,292
- Goddammit, Norman, we're in a pickle.

512
00:31:39,294 --> 00:31:40,712
Hell of a first day.

513
00:31:40,714 --> 00:31:43,008
- Well, loop me in, sir, I'm here to help.

514
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,889
- Tell me, and and tell me truthfully,

515
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,270
given your situation, I
mean your previous situation

516
00:31:49,272 --> 00:31:50,356
as you were...
- Homeless?

517
00:31:50,358 --> 00:31:52,569
- Well, Annette says I
have to say unhoused.

518
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:54,992
What do you know about larceny?

519
00:31:56,203 --> 00:31:57,996
- What do I know about theft
because I was homeless?

520
00:31:57,998 --> 00:32:00,752
- Grand theft, sabotage.

521
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:02,171
Strictly white collar stuff.

522
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:05,177
- Oh, my collar hasn't been
white for some time, sir.

523
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:06,179
- Yeah. Yeah.

524
00:32:06,181 --> 00:32:07,267
You've met my wife.

525
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:10,187
And her lover.

526
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:12,316
- Jimmy. Yeah.

527
00:32:12,318 --> 00:32:13,360
I met him over breakfast.

528
00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:15,072
He called me Nugget.

529
00:32:15,074 --> 00:32:15,909
- He's such a...

530
00:32:17,078 --> 00:32:21,502
You were late because you
had breakfast with Jimmy?

531
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,921
- What does this have
to do with larceny, sir?

532
00:32:22,923 --> 00:32:26,261
- Ah, I knew you knew more
than you were letting on.

533
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:27,931
- Ha-ha, on accident, I can assure you.

534
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:28,768
- My wife, Norm.

535
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:31,814
She's stolen from me.

536
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:32,733
- How much?

537
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:33,653
- $21 Million.

538
00:32:34,487 --> 00:32:35,864
- Oh my.

539
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:37,325
- No, mine.

540
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:39,370
And it couldn't come at the worst time.

541
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:42,126
- Is there a good time
for $21 million to vanish?

542
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:44,757
- Well, I'll tell you
an especially bad time,

543
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,890
when I've been given that
money by my business partners

544
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:51,979
in order to buy a certain
intellectual property.

545
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:52,814
- The rights.

546
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:54,860
- It's all the Tims' money.

547
00:32:54,862 --> 00:32:57,406
Every gleaming peso.

548
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,705
It was meant to purchase "The Humans."

549
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,501
- Which humans?

550
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,588
- The play, you nimrod.

551
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,924
The award-winning play.

552
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:08,136
Have you ever heard of the theater?

553
00:33:08,138 --> 00:33:11,142
- Okay, so Rosemary
stole it from under you,

554
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:12,061
that's the idea.

555
00:33:12,063 --> 00:33:14,190
- Bank confirmed, she initiated a transfer

556
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,862
from my business account
to an offshore account

557
00:33:16,864 --> 00:33:18,908
in Sydney, Australia.

558
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,413
- Well, you should have gone
to the authorities, sir.

559
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:23,043
- She's my wife, Norman.

560
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,005
Well sure, she made a cuckhold of me.

561
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:28,093
She's still the love of
my goddamn life, Norman.

562
00:33:28,095 --> 00:33:33,061
And if she feels she has to
steal 21 million from me,

563
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:35,065
whatever the reason, then
she's gonna steal 21 million

564
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:36,654
from me and not a penny less.

565
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:39,449
- That's oddly moving.

566
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:41,036
- I've not been a good husband.

567
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:43,624
That doesn't mean I'm gonna
send my wife to the slammer.

568
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:44,459
- Sure.

569
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:46,171
- Now what the hell are
you still doing here?

570
00:33:46,173 --> 00:33:47,339
- I'm, I'm sorry?

571
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:49,595
- You're supposed to be cross town meeting

572
00:33:49,597 --> 00:33:51,056
with Warren Gabel.

573
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:51,893
- The actor?

574
00:33:53,353 --> 00:33:54,646
- You know him?

575
00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:01,577
- Can I get
you guys anything else?

576
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:02,371
- No.

577
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:07,714
- Well, this is strange, I'll admit it.

578
00:34:07,716 --> 00:34:09,927
- Not exactly how I
planned my morning either.

579
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:11,889
- What the hell are you doing, Sam?

580
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,354
- I think I'm supposed to convince you

581
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:16,565
to star in George Moffett's movie.

582
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,485
- No, I know why we are here.

583
00:34:18,487 --> 00:34:21,742
But the specificities of your
engagement with the Moffett's,

584
00:34:21,744 --> 00:34:22,871
it's beyond me.

585
00:34:23,915 --> 00:34:25,959
- Warren, it's nothing too strange.

586
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:28,840
Actually, the whole
thing is beyond strange.

587
00:34:28,842 --> 00:34:32,681
- Man, last time I saw you
was closing night of our play.

588
00:34:32,683 --> 00:34:34,100
Which one was it?

589
00:34:34,102 --> 00:34:34,937
- "Norman."

590
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:39,028
- Right, "Norman."

591
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:40,780
Yeah.

592
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:41,782
Week later you divorced Catherine.

593
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,667
- Other way around.

594
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,963
- God, how long has it been, Sam?

595
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:50,675
- Warren, I'm homeless.

596
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:51,846
- You mean unhoused?

597
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,973
- Yes.

598
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:54,975
- Does Catherine know?

599
00:34:54,977 --> 00:34:55,810
- Mm-mm.

600
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:57,313
And it seems you and
I are gonna be working

601
00:34:57,315 --> 00:35:00,695
in the same circles and
I prefer your discretion.

602
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:03,076
- About your condition, you mean.

603
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:07,416
- I'm not going by Sam these days.

604
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:09,214
- You got an actor's alias.

605
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:11,802
- I go by Norman.

606
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:14,723
- Jesus Christ.
- It's just a favor.

607
00:35:14,725 --> 00:35:16,017
- Not a healthy favor.

608
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:18,355
What does George Moffett wanna do with me?

609
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:19,942
- You were in "The Humans" a year ago.

610
00:35:19,944 --> 00:35:21,570
He's filming an adaptation of the piece

611
00:35:21,572 --> 00:35:23,824
and he wants you to reprise Richard.

612
00:35:23,826 --> 00:35:25,787
- No shit?
- It's a good role.

613
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:26,830
- Sure it is.

614
00:35:26,832 --> 00:35:29,836
The Goldheart Sisters
offered it to me last week.

615
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:30,672
- The who?

616
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:32,258
- George couldn't possibly
have the rights to it.

617
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,176
- We're working on it.

618
00:35:33,178 --> 00:35:35,890
- Well, you've been beat to the punch.

619
00:35:35,892 --> 00:35:37,727
I've already been cast.

620
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:38,980
- The Goldhearts?

621
00:35:38,982 --> 00:35:40,065
You're sure he said the Goldhearts?

622
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:41,568
- I'm quite sure.

623
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,363
- Well, that's bad news, Norm.

624
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:44,490
You don't know these young women,

625
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:47,580
real Jane Fonda types,
if you catch my drift,

626
00:35:47,582 --> 00:35:49,626
after my masculine pride.

627
00:35:53,468 --> 00:35:54,594
- I'm sure you'll heal.

628
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:57,182
- I want you to follow that paper trail

629
00:35:57,184 --> 00:36:00,107
and see what putz bought those
rights out from under me.

630
00:36:06,912 --> 00:36:07,873
- Here you go, sir.

631
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:15,387
- Didn't the Goldhearts buy the rights?

632
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,187
- You are a real Jesus
Christ, you know that?

633
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:21,734
- Thank you?

634
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:25,698
- Find those rights now.

635
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,533
- Yes, sir.

636
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:28,623
- And don't let
the Tims find out this time.

637
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:34,758
- Tell me something, Sylvia.

638
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,718
- Must we always talk?

639
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,348
- Why do you think we're
supposed to say unhoused

640
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,060
instead of homeless?

641
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:43,108
- Here I was hoping for
something a little more bechdian.

642
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,780
- I think unhoused puts
the blame on others

643
00:36:45,782 --> 00:36:48,243
because unhoused is something
that happens to a person

644
00:36:48,245 --> 00:36:49,328
as opposed to homelessness,

645
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,042
which happens because of a person.

646
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:54,171
- I don't wanna talk about this.

647
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,465
- Only because you have a house.

648
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:58,306
- No, only because one of
them is in the next room.

649
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:00,977
- This isn't about Norman.

650
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:02,312
- Oh, no?

651
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:06,657
- No! It's about his neighbors.

652
00:37:08,452 --> 00:37:10,788
- Greater than you have
cashed in a bleeding heart

653
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,209
for a pass at responsibility.

654
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:16,048
We're just lucky your little
product isn't mentally ill.

655
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,596
- Well, we don't know that yet.

656
00:37:19,182 --> 00:37:20,098
- What?

657
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,810
- Well, I can't just say
one way or the other,

658
00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:24,649
whether or not he is in
fact not mentally ill.

659
00:37:24,651 --> 00:37:28,991
- And you didn't think that
little detail was important?

660
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:31,955
- People have called us mentally ill.

661
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:33,959
- And yet I have learned
to live with myself.

662
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,005
- I'm glad someone has.

663
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:37,592
- While I have to live with myself,

664
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:38,928
I do not have to live with him.

665
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,015
- Do I get to choose
between the two of you?

666
00:37:41,017 --> 00:37:42,644
- Would you like to choose

667
00:37:42,646 --> 00:37:44,691
between your inheritance and a tent?

668
00:37:49,408 --> 00:37:51,371
Do you ever think we need more friends?

669
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:02,184
- There's some business for you.

670
00:38:04,731 --> 00:38:06,775
- Oh, that doesn't sound right.

671
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:08,236
Jimmy.

672
00:38:08,238 --> 00:38:11,117
- Just an appointment coming
through, I think on Friday.

673
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,037
- Let me see that.

674
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,331
- It's strictly for Rosemary.

675
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,628
- Oh, let him. Norman.

676
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,924
It's only Jimmy, he signs for everything.

677
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:19,803
- It's your mail.

678
00:38:20,722 --> 00:38:23,182
- Oh. And Normy, you'll
put out some sandwiches

679
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:24,353
for this afternoon?

680
00:38:25,397 --> 00:38:26,648
- You know, not to be a nag...

681
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,984
- Oh, nag away.

682
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:30,071
- That seems outside the scope of my job.

683
00:38:30,073 --> 00:38:32,075
- Really? A few finger sandwiches.

684
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:34,831
I know the twins will be
starving after their ordeal.

685
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,000
- Ordeal?

686
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:37,419
- Oh, something to do in the Congo.

687
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:38,674
I'll let them explain it.

688
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:41,803
- Sure.

689
00:38:41,805 --> 00:38:43,014
One last thing.

690
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:44,183
- Shoot.

691
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:45,312
- Do we like the twins?

692
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:03,429
- You really must go.

693
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:04,724
There isn't a place quite like

694
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:06,687
the Democratic Republic of Congo.

695
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:08,481
- Somehow neither
Democratic or a Republic.

696
00:39:08,483 --> 00:39:10,276
- But all Congo.

697
00:39:10,278 --> 00:39:13,617
But the boeuf bourguignon,
practically from Paris itself.

698
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,495
- One of the help had slipped
something in her food.

699
00:39:15,497 --> 00:39:17,875
- Ended up just being a
bad case of food poisoning.

700
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,963
- There's this great restaurant there.

701
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:21,716
- Well, not so much restaurant.

702
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:22,719
- More in internment camp.

703
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:24,304
More indentured prisoner war than chef,

704
00:39:24,306 --> 00:39:25,140
but you get the idea.

705
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:27,477
They take tourism very
seriously in the DRC.

706
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:29,022
And you don't even notice the Malaria.

707
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,903
- Unless you get it.

708
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:33,699
Anyway, he was shot the day after.

709
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:35,745
Remember that time I
thought I had malaria,

710
00:39:35,747 --> 00:39:37,874
but it ended up just being food poisoning.

711
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,921
But the best part, and I can't
even begin to make this up.

712
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:43,092
- I had malaria that whole time.

713
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,620
- How exciting.

714
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:58,876
- Norman, Norman, Norman.

715
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:02,299
- Sylvia.

716
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:05,386
- So what's the plan?

717
00:40:05,388 --> 00:40:07,434
Are you going to kill us in our sleep?

718
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:12,693
- Well, I hadn't thought of
it, but it's a good backup

719
00:40:12,695 --> 00:40:14,533
just in case the job doesn't go well.

720
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:19,331
- I'm just trying to determine
how worried I should be.

721
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,168
- That's funny, I was
doing the same thing.

722
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,256
- Well, fortunately for you,

723
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:26,136
you aren't going to last long
enough for that to matter.

724
00:40:26,138 --> 00:40:27,266
- Any advice?

725
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:30,688
- Stay on my good side.

726
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,317
- I'm not sure I've seen one.

727
00:40:33,194 --> 00:40:35,950
- One word from me and you
are back on the street.

728
00:40:38,622 --> 00:40:39,833
Où vous appartenez.

729
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:46,093
- I heard you scheming.

730
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:47,304
- I heard you breathing.

731
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:48,974
- Norman isn't going anywhere.

732
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:50,018
- Is this one of those...

733
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,898
- Mm, no, you know what? Nevermind.

734
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,359
I think I'm gonna watch this one play out.

735
00:40:54,361 --> 00:40:56,196
- You're going to leave Norman alone

736
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:57,032
is what you're going to do.

737
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:59,621
- And you're gonna be one to
make me, tough little sister?

738
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,455
- A kick to the teeth will make you.

739
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:03,171
- Oh, aren't you quite
the brute these days?

740
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,551
- I'm the boss about this, got it?

741
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:08,054
About Norman.

742
00:41:08,056 --> 00:41:09,431
- You've fallen in love with a stray,

743
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:10,643
but you know we're gonna have to take him

744
00:41:10,645 --> 00:41:12,354
to the pound eventually.

745
00:41:12,356 --> 00:41:13,523
And what about when father finds out

746
00:41:13,525 --> 00:41:16,571
that you've been trying
to screw his assistant?

747
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:17,698
- Daddy isn't going to find out

748
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,117
unless you also want him to find out

749
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,663
about the actual reason you were forced

750
00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:22,376
to take a gap year off of college.

751
00:41:24,254 --> 00:41:25,380
- Well, if he ever finds that out

752
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:28,302
it's your own teeth I'd be worried about.

753
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:10,219
- Good morning, Norman.

754
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:11,346
- Good morning, Annette.

755
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:13,977
Sorry to say I won't have time
for our usual fencing match.

756
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:15,773
- En guard.
- Pret.

757
00:42:15,775 --> 00:42:17,526
Why in the world do you
know so much about fencing?

758
00:42:17,528 --> 00:42:18,570
- Private school.

759
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:19,490
What's your excuse?

760
00:42:21,368 --> 00:42:23,624
- Homelessness isn't as
peaceful as it seems.

761
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,045
- The Tims?

762
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,007
- Sounds like it.

763
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:31,303
- When you're done enjoying
your job, feel free to enjoy me.

764
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:32,809
We do have a deal after all.

765
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:35,313
You forgot the Martinis.

766
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:51,511
- Come on.

767
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:53,305
I've been busy with other things.

768
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:56,436
You know, Rosemary and Jimmy
have been sleeping together

769
00:42:56,438 --> 00:42:58,315
and I've been very distracted about it.

770
00:42:58,317 --> 00:42:59,442
- Oh, please.

771
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:00,612
Everyone knows Rosemary and Jimmy

772
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:02,616
have been boinking since
that Shakespeare flick.

773
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:05,204
- Sex is sex.

774
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:06,624
George, you'll do it.

775
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:07,458
She'll do it.

776
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,503
We all do it.

777
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:12,135
We don't all, however, string
our colleagues out to dry.

778
00:43:12,137 --> 00:43:16,226
$21 million and no rights?

779
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:17,228
- I'm working on it.

780
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,480
- I'm gonna give it to you straight.

781
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:20,192
George, we took a vote.

782
00:43:20,194 --> 00:43:21,155
Kidnapping.

783
00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:24,704
Blackmail.

784
00:43:25,623 --> 00:43:28,960
I don't know, we're not
used to this kind of thing,

785
00:43:28,962 --> 00:43:30,672
but we had to do something.

786
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,467
- Landed on the physical option.

787
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:36,726
- Either you find a way outta this mess

788
00:43:36,728 --> 00:43:39,857
or we break your legs.

789
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:41,655
- Well, you don't mean both of them.

790
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:45,994
- Well, we we don't want
to half-ass anything.

791
00:43:45,996 --> 00:43:47,332
- Put it to a vote, yeah?

792
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:51,171
- Quicker.

793
00:44:03,072 --> 00:44:03,907
- Martinis?

794
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:07,036
- Right on time, Norman,

795
00:44:07,038 --> 00:44:08,623
I was just telling the Tims

796
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,461
how you landed the rights to "The Humans."

797
00:44:11,463 --> 00:44:12,296
- Really?

798
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:15,219
- Oh yes.

799
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:16,683
- Well, good for me.

800
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:19,310
- Yes.

801
00:44:19,312 --> 00:44:21,356
Just secure them.

802
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,114
- Well, then I guess that
means I deserve a raise.

803
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:26,826
- Yes. I suppose you do.

804
00:44:26,828 --> 00:44:27,703
- Good for you, Norman.

805
00:44:27,705 --> 00:44:29,665
I do enjoy classic
Hollywood success stories.

806
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,667
- Yes. Yes.

807
00:44:30,669 --> 00:44:32,880
We're all very impressed
with Norman's ability

808
00:44:32,882 --> 00:44:34,007
to climb a ladder.

809
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:36,178
But I wanna see "The
Humans" on the big screen.

810
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,973
- Are you even listening to me?

811
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,394
I said I'm taking care of it.

812
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:42,651
- You better hope so, George.

813
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:11,999
- Can I help you?

814
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,212
- Just keep going, I'm recording.

815
00:45:14,214 --> 00:45:15,966
- Keep going with what?

816
00:45:15,968 --> 00:45:20,182
- I think he wants raw footage
of the bitch in the wild.

817
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,894
Like a National Geographic kind of thing.

818
00:45:21,896 --> 00:45:23,355
- Yes, exactly.

819
00:45:23,357 --> 00:45:25,986
Just give me some real sister talk.

820
00:45:25,988 --> 00:45:27,321
- My god, Jimmy, you know Father

821
00:45:27,323 --> 00:45:29,451
won't let you stay here forever.

822
00:45:29,453 --> 00:45:30,454
- Jimmy, dear.

823
00:45:32,626 --> 00:45:33,668
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

824
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,505
I can't stand to watch myself on film.

825
00:45:35,507 --> 00:45:37,509
- Well, then I won't
show it to you, darling.

826
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:39,262
- Well, let's not be extreme.

827
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:40,849
Did you choose a movie for tonight?

828
00:45:40,851 --> 00:45:42,018
- We are right here.

829
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,688
Your children are right here.

830
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,609
If you wanna cheat on
Father, go right ahead.

831
00:45:45,611 --> 00:45:47,654
But can you at least hide
it a little bit better?

832
00:45:47,656 --> 00:45:49,577
- Hide what? True love.

833
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:51,453
Your father wouldn't know it

834
00:45:51,455 --> 00:45:53,958
if it was right in front of 'em anyways.

835
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,921
Jimmy, what's the movie about?

836
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:57,799
- It's a retelling of
the "Song of Solomon"

837
00:45:57,801 --> 00:45:59,887
as told through the eyes of a desperate up

838
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:02,266
and coming on Broadway.

839
00:46:02,268 --> 00:46:05,815
I hear there's a Can Can line at the end.

840
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:07,528
- Oh, like Paris!

841
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:08,780
- Just like Paris.

842
00:46:08,782 --> 00:46:13,792
- Oh, look at my
sweet little daughters hanging.

843
00:46:14,961 --> 00:46:16,504
Isn't that nice? Huh?

844
00:46:16,506 --> 00:46:18,760
- How's the move coming, Jimbo?

845
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:21,388
Settling in nicely?

846
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,308
- Don't worry, George.

847
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:26,314
Rosemary and I will be outta
your hair lickety split.

848
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:29,655
You don't mind if we dive into
a little family discussion,

849
00:46:29,657 --> 00:46:31,241
do you, Jimmy?

850
00:46:31,243 --> 00:46:33,161
- Oh, let me get it from the wide.

851
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:34,792
- Just like Lawrence of Arabia!

852
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:40,969
This isn't gonna be one of those
long movie meetings, is it?

853
00:46:40,971 --> 00:46:42,556
- As a matter of fact, it is, dear wife.

854
00:46:42,558 --> 00:46:43,766
I produce movies.

855
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:45,812
I do not produce the want and desires

856
00:46:45,814 --> 00:46:47,064
of your black little hearts.

857
00:46:47,066 --> 00:46:48,275
- Not this again, Daddy.

858
00:46:48,277 --> 00:46:49,110
- Yes. Yes.

859
00:46:49,112 --> 00:46:49,945
This again.

860
00:46:49,947 --> 00:46:52,909
- Well, maybe we don't
have to talk about movies.

861
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,454
- Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

862
00:46:54,456 --> 00:46:55,289
- Yeah!

863
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:56,124
- Ugh, George.

864
00:46:56,126 --> 00:46:57,794
Why is it always movies with you?

865
00:46:57,796 --> 00:47:00,967
It's either bounce
checks or false profits.

866
00:47:00,969 --> 00:47:02,596
- Now you've upset Jimmy.

867
00:47:02,598 --> 00:47:03,723
Why do you do that?

868
00:47:03,725 --> 00:47:05,142
He was such a good assistant.

869
00:47:05,144 --> 00:47:06,979
- He slept with my wife.

870
00:47:06,981 --> 00:47:09,526
- I am not your property, George.

871
00:47:09,528 --> 00:47:10,361
- God.

872
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:11,196
- You're just drunk.

873
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:13,116
- I have had only three martinis today

874
00:47:13,118 --> 00:47:14,787
and I'm entirely coherent.

875
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:16,832
- What's this family meeting for?

876
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,922
- For a family enterprise.

877
00:47:19,924 --> 00:47:21,341
We're gonna make a movie together,

878
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,428
a real Moffett family picture.

879
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,852
We're doing "The Humans," with
Sylvia and Annette to star,

880
00:47:26,854 --> 00:47:28,480
Jack to direct and me to produce.

881
00:47:28,482 --> 00:47:31,446
- You don't own the rights to
"The Humans" though, George.

882
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:35,745
- How the hell do you know that?

883
00:47:35,747 --> 00:47:38,545
- Because I was
your goddamn assistant.

884
00:47:40,047 --> 00:47:42,174
- George, please.

885
00:47:42,176 --> 00:47:43,427
You're upsetting Jimmy.

886
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:44,972
- Throw Jimmy off a cliff for all I care.

887
00:47:44,974 --> 00:47:46,057
- Well, I never.

888
00:47:46,059 --> 00:47:46,976
- How much does it pay?

889
00:47:46,978 --> 00:47:50,107
- You're family, you'll
do it for back-end points.

890
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:51,359
- Ugh!

891
00:47:51,361 --> 00:47:53,280
- La vie cruelle d'une actrice.

892
00:47:53,282 --> 00:47:55,994
- Besides, who needs rights?

893
00:47:55,996 --> 00:48:01,006
We'll sell it in, on the
internet, in Thailand.

894
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:05,722
In Times Square for all I care.

895
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:08,395
Anywhere where infringement
is a proud tradition.

896
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,774
- Don't mind me.

897
00:48:10,776 --> 00:48:12,234
- Daddy was just giving us the rundown

898
00:48:12,236 --> 00:48:14,280
on his mildly Producers-esq plan.

899
00:48:14,282 --> 00:48:15,115
- It's nothing like The Producers.

900
00:48:15,117 --> 00:48:17,621
- No, it's half as funny
and twice as desperate.

901
00:48:17,623 --> 00:48:18,455
- Oh, fuck off, Jimmy.

902
00:48:18,457 --> 00:48:20,083
- We should get paid up front.

903
00:48:20,085 --> 00:48:21,545
- There is no money.

904
00:48:21,547 --> 00:48:22,589
That's why I'm hiring you.

905
00:48:22,591 --> 00:48:25,887
- Independent film, so '90s.

906
00:48:25,889 --> 00:48:26,972
If I'm to be honest...

907
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:28,726
- We've got no choice.

908
00:48:28,728 --> 00:48:32,233
It's a movie together
or the streets together.

909
00:48:32,235 --> 00:48:33,694
- I know some prime real
estate if you guys are looking.

910
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:35,322
- If cutting money would help,

911
00:48:35,324 --> 00:48:38,328
how about this business
of employing the homeless?

912
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,457
I think we would all prefer
not to be shanked in the night.

913
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,417
- Shanked?

914
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,587
What's that?

915
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:43,421
What does shanked mean?

916
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:45,259
- No one's getting shanked.

917
00:48:45,261 --> 00:48:46,469
- I can nearly guarantee it.

918
00:48:46,471 --> 00:48:48,181
- Oh, nearly, he says.

919
00:48:48,183 --> 00:48:50,143
- Norman, you wouldn't
shank me, would you?

920
00:48:50,145 --> 00:48:52,147
- Would you come into my
tent, try to steal my food?

921
00:48:52,149 --> 00:48:53,275
- Never.

922
00:48:53,277 --> 00:48:55,655
- No, I won't shank you.

923
00:48:55,657 --> 00:49:00,038
- Context tells me shanked is
like a form of self-defense.

924
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,625
- Am I the only one who's
going to acknowledge

925
00:49:01,627 --> 00:49:03,253
that he still lives in a tent?

926
00:49:03,255 --> 00:49:05,048
- Oh, Sylvia, many people live in tents.

927
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,177
- Look, all I'm saying is
that we don't know anything

928
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:08,681
about some people.

929
00:49:08,683 --> 00:49:11,645
That may be a background
check might be in order?

930
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:14,191
Did you know we still don't
know if he's mentally ill?

931
00:49:14,193 --> 00:49:15,235
- Shut your mouth!

932
00:49:15,237 --> 00:49:17,657
- Sorry, if I value my going-on-living.

933
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:19,788
- You won't go on living
talking like that.

934
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,416
- Jimmy?

935
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,630
Would you like to get a
snack before we leave?

936
00:49:24,632 --> 00:49:27,719
I know you hate those concession prices.

937
00:49:27,721 --> 00:49:30,349
- Jimmy, I'm gonna murder you one day.

938
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:31,810
I want you to be able to look back

939
00:49:31,812 --> 00:49:35,818
and realize that this is
the moment I told you so.

940
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,991
- I dunno why Father couldn't
have hired a professional

941
00:49:38,993 --> 00:49:40,787
to replace Jimmy.

942
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,335
- Oh honey.

943
00:49:44,462 --> 00:49:46,674
George, now you're doing
it to your own daughter.

944
00:49:46,676 --> 00:49:48,594
- Not this again.

945
00:49:48,596 --> 00:49:50,515
- Norman only just got here.

946
00:49:50,517 --> 00:49:51,934
- It's nothing personal, little sis.

947
00:49:51,936 --> 00:49:54,313
It's just that father here
is looking to save money

948
00:49:54,315 --> 00:49:56,568
and we've got a bum on the payroll.

949
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,405
Easy math.

950
00:49:58,281 --> 00:50:01,035
- George, don't get
between Annette and Norman.

951
00:50:01,037 --> 00:50:03,708
- I've said nothing about firing Norman.

952
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,878
- Can't you
see she's fond of him?

953
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,632
The two are already best friends.

954
00:50:07,634 --> 00:50:08,466
- Annette. Annette.

955
00:50:08,468 --> 00:50:09,301
- I'm sure your father

956
00:50:09,303 --> 00:50:12,391
will make the right choice,
Annette, don't panic.

957
00:50:12,393 --> 00:50:14,270
- No! Oh, oh!

958
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:16,817
- I'm going to kill myself.

959
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:18,445
- I knew it.

960
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:20,616
I knew you were gonna
fucking do this, Annette.

961
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:22,327
Goddammit, just do it!

962
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:23,664
- George, do something.

963
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:25,250
She's gonna shoot herself!

964
00:50:25,252 --> 00:50:26,628
- That's a prop gun.

965
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:27,964
- I'll do it. I'll really do it.

966
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:29,008
- Oh, no, no, no, honey.

967
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,343
Put the gun away.

968
00:50:30,345 --> 00:50:32,473
Sh, sh, sh, come, come.

969
00:50:37,026 --> 00:50:38,736
- There you go, just...

970
00:50:38,738 --> 00:50:39,571
- Don't take my gun.

971
00:50:39,573 --> 00:50:43,369
- Oh, honey, nobody's gonna take your gun.

972
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:44,917
You keep your gun, okay, honey?

973
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,002
You just relax.

974
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:48,506
- This act is getting old, sis.

975
00:50:48,508 --> 00:50:49,508
Do you wanna have a Coke?

976
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,010
Do you want me to put on a movie?

977
00:50:51,012 --> 00:50:52,599
- I only wanna die.

978
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:54,768
- Aww.

979
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:57,231
- To forget how to feel.

980
00:50:57,233 --> 00:50:59,569
- Well, I can have Norman
go and get you a Coke,

981
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:00,571
would that help?

982
00:51:00,573 --> 00:51:01,698
- Oh, Norman.

983
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,828
- Oh that's it, I'm out.

984
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:07,126
- Um, I, how about I
make everyone Martinis?

985
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:08,548
- Read the room, Norm.

986
00:51:13,558 --> 00:51:16,897
Everybody's doing the
movie, no matter what.

987
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,316
You too, Norm.

988
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:20,235
Hope you can act.

989
00:51:20,237 --> 00:51:22,239
- Is Sylvia still over there?

990
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:23,491
- No, she left, honey.

991
00:51:23,493 --> 00:51:25,663
But Norman's here, will that cheer you up?

992
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:28,418
Jimmy, get my coat, honey, and my shoes.

993
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,798
I don't wanna miss the previews.

994
00:51:34,348 --> 00:51:39,317
- They're gonna
keep you after all, Norman.

995
00:51:39,526 --> 00:51:41,279
Oh, it's only a prop.

996
00:51:42,406 --> 00:51:46,622
Still a pretty good actor.

997
00:51:46,624 --> 00:51:50,922
We're gonna be in a
movie together, Norman.

998
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:53,345
On the silver screen, Norman.

999
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:07,999
- We should have some very
strict rules, Catherine.

1000
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:13,134
- Who the hell is Catherine?

1001
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:18,351
- Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm...

1002
00:52:18,353 --> 00:52:19,690
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1003
00:52:22,152 --> 00:52:23,739
- I can be a Catherine.

1004
00:52:32,256 --> 00:52:34,801
- No, you can't come in here.
- It's my house.

1005
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:35,720
- It's your parents' house.

1006
00:52:35,722 --> 00:52:37,807
- And mine one day, but
it's besides the point.

1007
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:39,644
I just wanted to talk some more.

1008
00:52:39,646 --> 00:52:40,478
- Later, not in here.

1009
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,486
- You would kiss me and
then demand I leave?

1010
00:52:44,781 --> 00:52:47,075
- I would kiss you, you say?

1011
00:52:47,077 --> 00:52:49,413
- This is a quick moving
romance, isn't it?

1012
00:52:49,415 --> 00:52:51,167
To think, before I hardly even knew you,

1013
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:53,046
and yet here we are.

1014
00:52:53,048 --> 00:52:54,381
Bathrooms are for private things,

1015
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:56,177
we could be doing anything in here.

1016
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:58,348
- Yes, and yet here you are.

1017
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,893
- Don't you seen Norman?

1018
00:52:59,895 --> 00:53:00,853
Now that you're here to stay,

1019
00:53:00,855 --> 00:53:03,441
we don't have to keep
this a secret anymore.

1020
00:53:03,443 --> 00:53:06,280
- I can assure you, I spoke to
your father about such things

1021
00:53:06,282 --> 00:53:08,242
and coming out as his daughter's lover

1022
00:53:08,244 --> 00:53:09,078
is counter productive.

1023
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,706
Just ask his last assistant.

1024
00:53:10,708 --> 00:53:12,502
Excuse me.
- Well, that's fine.

1025
00:53:12,504 --> 00:53:14,463
We can keep it secret.

1026
00:53:14,465 --> 00:53:16,968
All the great loves are kept secret.

1027
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,849
- Haven't you heard of professionalism?

1028
00:53:19,851 --> 00:53:22,730
If you had my job,
would you be your lover?

1029
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,859
- I've never had a job before, Norman.

1030
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:27,364
There's no telling how I'd behave.

1031
00:53:27,366 --> 00:53:30,245
- You do want me to stay
in this house with you,

1032
00:53:30,247 --> 00:53:32,167
right Annette, as long as I can?

1033
00:53:33,253 --> 00:53:34,712
- More than anything.

1034
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:36,967
- Then I need to keep my job.

1035
00:53:36,969 --> 00:53:38,597
- And I'll be very secret.

1036
00:53:39,724 --> 00:53:40,558
- You're very handsome, Norman.

1037
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,394
- I won't be your lover.

1038
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:44,983
- Wait, you won't?

1039
00:53:44,985 --> 00:53:48,199
- I think I'd prefer our
relationship to be professional.

1040
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:51,203
- You mean you don't like

1041
00:53:51,205 --> 00:53:53,084
that I followed you into the restroom?

1042
00:53:55,005 --> 00:53:57,215
- No, I can't say that I cared for it.

1043
00:53:57,217 --> 00:53:58,719
- It's this Catherine person, isn't it?

1044
00:53:58,721 --> 00:54:01,307
- I'll see you when I come
in for work and when I leave,

1045
00:54:01,309 --> 00:54:02,768
and at parties and things
I'll know you'll be at.

1046
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:04,481
But I think for me, that's enough.

1047
00:54:06,737 --> 00:54:09,993
- But what about our kiss?

1048
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:14,794
- It was only your kiss.

1049
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:19,930
- Oh, Norman.
- Annette.

1050
00:54:21,767 --> 00:54:23,771
- Norman.
- Annette, I...

1051
00:55:00,468 --> 00:55:05,478
You've mastered the classes they gave

1052
00:55:07,149 --> 00:55:11,155
As fall turns to winter

1053
00:55:11,157 --> 00:55:15,121
You lost track of your center

1054
00:55:15,123 --> 00:55:19,004
Refuse to remember

1055
00:55:19,006 --> 00:55:23,974
You choose to surrender

1056
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:28,356
Thoughts and memories

1057
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:33,157
You'll retain these

1058
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:38,169
To look back at moments you've saved

1059
00:55:39,547 --> 00:55:43,135
The math that they're using

1060
00:55:43,137 --> 00:55:47,227
Is often confusing

1061
00:55:47,229 --> 00:55:52,239
The truth is amusing
and rife for abusing

1062
00:55:55,663 --> 00:56:00,673
Day turns night and your
feelings that were spoken

1063
00:56:03,177 --> 00:56:08,187
Turn to spite, and the
writings on the wall

1064
00:56:10,818 --> 00:56:15,828
You've been mended,
you've presented the lie

1065
00:56:17,372 --> 00:56:19,374
Say what you'll say

1066
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:24,050
Just don't be what they say you'll be

1067
00:56:24,052 --> 00:56:27,516
And you're trying, but you're dying

1068
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:31,983
We're all dying

1069
00:56:31,985 --> 00:56:33,987
You're not he same

1070
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:38,705
Just don't die till you c'est la vie

1071
00:56:38,707 --> 00:56:43,717
That's just platitudes and
I don't like your attitude

1072
00:56:44,886 --> 00:56:48,182
Day turns night

1073
00:56:48,184 --> 00:56:53,194
And your feelings never
spoken turn to spite

1074
00:56:55,866 --> 00:57:00,876
And the writing on the
wall you still hide

1075
00:57:04,759 --> 00:57:08,472
And you've mended and you've broken

1076
00:57:08,474 --> 00:57:13,442
You pretend you've been mended

1077
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:17,450
You presented the lie

1078
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:31,270
In a meadow, I will lead you

1079
00:57:34,944 --> 00:57:37,950
To the other side

1080
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:05,294
- Who's ready for a movie?

1081
00:58:05,296 --> 00:58:06,798
- When do I...

1082
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,927
- No, no, think classy.

1083
00:58:08,929 --> 00:58:11,181
Think Hollywood.

1084
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:14,314
If all goes well, we get a movie,

1085
00:58:15,233 --> 00:58:16,653
and Moffett keeps his knees.

1086
00:58:56,649 --> 00:58:57,941
- What's with the get up?

1087
00:58:57,943 --> 00:58:59,194
- It matches my soul.

1088
00:58:59,196 --> 00:59:01,532
- Well, I like it, you look beautiful.

1089
00:59:01,534 --> 00:59:03,410
- I meant look distracting.

1090
00:59:03,412 --> 00:59:05,416
- Why not be beautifully distracting?

1091
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:10,341
Well, that's my cue.

1092
00:59:10,343 --> 00:59:12,388
Can't say it's been a pleasure. Annette.

1093
00:59:15,144 --> 00:59:17,523
- Jack, you've met The twins.

1094
00:59:17,525 --> 00:59:19,444
- Hello.
- Evening.

1095
00:59:20,614 --> 00:59:21,906
- Hey, Norm.
- What?

1096
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:22,743
- Ready?

1097
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:24,664
- Norman.

1098
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:26,749
- Tabitha!

1099
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:27,626
- Ricky!

1100
00:59:27,628 --> 00:59:29,045
- Congo!

1101
00:59:29,047 --> 00:59:29,880
- Oh.

1102
00:59:29,882 --> 00:59:31,926
- I can't believe you
got the girls to act.

1103
00:59:31,928 --> 00:59:33,638
- Your daughter's coming out of retirement

1104
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,559
before you make it to your own?

1105
00:59:35,561 --> 00:59:36,978
It writes itself.

1106
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,982
- They've both had time to
process their resentment

1107
00:59:38,984 --> 00:59:41,444
towards their mother and me
for making them act so young.

1108
00:59:41,446 --> 00:59:42,573
- That's a big deal.

1109
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:45,371
- How resentful can they be
after being handed a career?

1110
00:59:53,763 --> 00:59:54,640
That resentful?

1111
00:59:55,684 --> 00:59:58,353
- That's why there's a prop
gun in the house, Norm.

1112
00:59:58,355 --> 01:00:00,274
- I'm sure they're as talented as ever.

1113
01:00:00,276 --> 01:00:02,863
And Jack to direct.

1114
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,032
- He's hot.

1115
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:04,909
- He's young.

1116
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:06,787
- An auteur in the making.

1117
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:07,748
- Great idea.

1118
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,459
- Truly brilliant.

1119
01:00:09,461 --> 01:00:11,756
- And he'll be sitting next
to you during the film.

1120
01:00:11,758 --> 01:00:14,720
- Actually-
- Brilliant!

1121
01:00:14,722 --> 01:00:16,766
- Jack, tell me, what is your experience

1122
01:00:16,768 --> 01:00:18,688
with Ethiopian cheeses?

1123
01:00:38,853 --> 01:00:41,064
- We haven't been completely
honest with each other.

1124
01:00:41,066 --> 01:00:43,487
- I have been nothing but honest with you.

1125
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:46,324
- I just don't mean you.

1126
01:00:46,326 --> 01:00:47,328
- We aren't talking.

1127
01:00:50,209 --> 01:00:53,046
- I'd like to share something
with you if you'd let me.

1128
01:00:53,048 --> 01:00:55,175
- I don't talk to men who broke my heart.

1129
01:00:55,177 --> 01:00:56,386
- Enough with the theatrics already.

1130
01:00:56,388 --> 01:00:57,848
- Theatrics. Theatrics.

1131
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:59,727
It's all theatrics when
it's a woman's heart.

1132
01:00:59,729 --> 01:01:01,479
It's all, she's a little unstable,

1133
01:01:01,481 --> 01:01:03,528
when really she's just a little in love.

1134
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:06,741
What do you wanna talk about?

1135
01:01:06,743 --> 01:01:08,454
- Unstable. A little unstable?

1136
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:11,625
You're a woman with the
proclivity to kill herself

1137
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:13,464
if the means weren't padded as props.

1138
01:01:18,265 --> 01:01:20,729
- Perhaps we shouldn't be
honest with each other.

1139
01:01:22,148 --> 01:01:24,612
- Psst, Norman.

1140
01:01:25,822 --> 01:01:27,448
We've got trouble in paradise.

1141
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,368
The Goldhearts are here.

1142
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:30,498
- Start with cocktails?

1143
01:01:37,846 --> 01:01:42,355
- So the infamous
Goldheart sisters are suing me.

1144
01:01:43,273 --> 01:01:44,691
- You stole our movie.

1145
01:01:44,693 --> 01:01:45,860
- You stole my movie.

1146
01:01:45,862 --> 01:01:47,948
- Be fair,
it's kind of our movie.

1147
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:50,369
- Well we have an
investor, a rights holder,

1148
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:53,375
and a production that says it's our movie.

1149
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:54,878
You don't got Jack.

1150
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,882
- Yes we do, Jack was directing.

1151
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:58,093
- We'll cut the baby in half.

1152
01:01:58,095 --> 01:01:59,721
- Absolutely not.

1153
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:01,892
- What's going on George?

1154
01:02:01,894 --> 01:02:03,188
What are all those papers?

1155
01:02:24,815 --> 01:02:26,567
- What the hell are
you winking at her for?

1156
01:02:26,569 --> 01:02:28,278
- How would I know, George?

1157
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,869
- Listen, Heather, Friday,
we go into business together.

1158
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:33,623
- You're gonna lose everything you got

1159
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,459
when this gets settled in court.

1160
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:37,923
If a single human being sees this movie,

1161
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:40,512
we're coming for everything you own.

1162
01:02:40,514 --> 01:02:42,516
- Got it, so no humans
can see "The Humans."

1163
01:02:42,518 --> 01:02:45,690
- Lawyer up, asshole.

1164
01:02:53,497 --> 01:02:55,917
- They're all making a Judas out of me.

1165
01:02:55,919 --> 01:02:56,794
- George.

1166
01:02:56,796 --> 01:02:59,591
- I'm nothing but a
Judas for you to betray.

1167
01:02:59,593 --> 01:03:01,344
- He means Julius.

1168
01:03:01,346 --> 01:03:03,181
- Dad made a movie
combining the characters

1169
01:03:03,183 --> 01:03:05,143
of the passion and Julius Caesar.

1170
01:03:05,145 --> 01:03:05,979
But he's never been to church,

1171
01:03:05,981 --> 01:03:07,273
so he gets the characters mixed.

1172
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:08,358
- It was a confusing movie.

1173
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,443
- And one of you is the Brutas.

1174
01:03:09,445 --> 01:03:11,364
- He means Judas.

1175
01:03:11,366 --> 01:03:12,909
- One of you told the Goldhearts

1176
01:03:12,911 --> 01:03:14,871
we were doing our little production.

1177
01:03:14,873 --> 01:03:15,957
We're the only ones who knew.

1178
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,003
- I think that's not entirely true.

1179
01:03:18,005 --> 01:03:20,550
I think I might have
mentioned to Warren Gabel

1180
01:03:20,552 --> 01:03:22,469
that we were pursuing the film,

1181
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:25,269
and he might have told the Goldhearts.

1182
01:03:26,354 --> 01:03:28,064
- Et tu Norman.

1183
01:03:28,066 --> 01:03:30,987
Take your 20 pieces of silver and leave.

1184
01:03:32,617 --> 01:03:34,037
Great Julius Caesar!

1185
01:03:35,247 --> 01:03:37,001
- What are you doing?

1186
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:52,947
- What do you think I'm
gonna say to you now, Norman?

1187
01:03:52,949 --> 01:03:54,410
- That you could really use a drink?

1188
01:03:55,454 --> 01:03:56,287
- You're fired, Norman.

1189
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:57,124
- Daddy!

1190
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,674
- We ever gonna talk about
why you're so good at acting?

1191
01:04:23,135 --> 01:04:25,596
- I just deliver my lines,
everything after that is luck.

1192
01:04:25,598 --> 01:04:26,600
- How about a drink?

1193
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,984
- It's really best if I don't.

1194
01:04:32,737 --> 01:04:33,573
Goodbye, Sylvia.

1195
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:36,202
- Do you really think I don't know?

1196
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:39,916
I clocked it nearly the
moment we first met.

1197
01:04:39,918 --> 01:04:41,589
I know who you really are, Norman.

1198
01:04:43,509 --> 01:04:46,345
- I'd be forever indebted to
you if you could tell me who.

1199
01:04:46,347 --> 01:04:47,849
- You are a man who knows better

1200
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:49,521
than to turn down the good stuff.

1201
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:13,653
Sam Leonard.

1202
01:05:14,738 --> 01:05:16,489
Oh, that's a real name.

1203
01:05:16,491 --> 01:05:18,661
Good golden age name.

1204
01:05:18,663 --> 01:05:20,455
An actor's name.

1205
01:05:20,457 --> 01:05:22,169
And if I recall, a good one too.

1206
01:05:23,756 --> 01:05:26,092
I've seen two of your plays, you know.

1207
01:05:26,094 --> 01:05:27,556
Must have left an impression.

1208
01:05:30,937 --> 01:05:32,354
- You wouldn't like Sam Leonard.

1209
01:05:32,356 --> 01:05:34,443
- To be fair, I don't
much like Norman Leonard.

1210
01:05:36,197 --> 01:05:37,197
- Sam was a coward.

1211
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,247
- Mm, and now you're a master of courage?

1212
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:46,092
- No, I'm saying, there's
no reason that I'm homeless.

1213
01:05:48,096 --> 01:05:50,768
I mean, I'm successful, I was well off.

1214
01:05:53,023 --> 01:05:55,568
There's people in the
city who have no choice,

1215
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:57,487
and I hid behind them.

1216
01:05:57,489 --> 01:05:59,327
- You were only a stage actor.

1217
01:06:02,207 --> 01:06:05,880
How long were you in the tent?

1218
01:06:05,882 --> 01:06:08,094
- I spent three years in
that lonely little tent.

1219
01:06:08,971 --> 01:06:10,182
- No family? No nothing?

1220
01:06:13,063 --> 01:06:14,940
- An ex-wife somewhere.

1221
01:06:14,942 --> 01:06:15,777
- Ugh.

1222
01:06:22,707 --> 01:06:26,130
So your ex-wife is why we
aren't civil to each other?

1223
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:28,511
- Am I not civil?

1224
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:32,309
- Why don't you like me?

1225
01:06:33,353 --> 01:06:34,523
We're alike, you and I.

1226
01:06:36,442 --> 01:06:37,570
- We're not alike.

1227
01:06:40,409 --> 01:06:41,829
We're just alone.

1228
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:45,962
- That we are, Sam.

1229
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,172
That we are.

1230
01:06:48,174 --> 01:06:49,551
- Norman.

1231
01:06:49,553 --> 01:06:50,555
- No, Sam is better.

1232
01:06:52,224 --> 01:06:53,600
- Unhoused is better than homeless.

1233
01:06:53,602 --> 01:06:55,523
Sam is better than Norman.

1234
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,234
Is there any idea you don't have

1235
01:06:58,236 --> 01:06:59,948
about how I should present myself?

1236
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:06,002
- I only want you to be real.

1237
01:07:12,431 --> 01:07:13,264
- Real.

1238
01:07:13,266 --> 01:07:14,101
- Real.

1239
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:27,169
- Ah.

1240
01:07:31,427 --> 01:07:32,595
You didn't have glasses?

1241
01:07:32,597 --> 01:07:35,601
- Oh, bougie actor too
good for the bottle?

1242
01:07:35,603 --> 01:07:37,897
- Oh, okay.

1243
01:07:37,899 --> 01:07:39,316
Let's be real then.

1244
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:40,485
All right.

1245
01:07:40,487 --> 01:07:42,114
Yeah. Let's get real.

1246
01:07:42,116 --> 01:07:43,617
Tell me, please tell me
about your childhood.

1247
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:44,996
Let's talk about your past.

1248
01:07:45,915 --> 01:07:47,877
- Someone's been hearing rumors, I see.

1249
01:07:55,183 --> 01:07:56,435
- I'm gonna kill myself.

1250
01:08:02,824 --> 01:08:03,951
Would you look at that?

1251
01:08:10,422 --> 01:08:11,297
- No one seems to care.

1252
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:12,927
- Ah, no one ever has.

1253
01:08:20,108 --> 01:08:23,072
- So what, what do you think about me?

1254
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:27,497
- Oh, well as Sam or as Norman?

1255
01:08:28,374 --> 01:08:29,918
- Dealer's choice.

1256
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,554
- I think maybe I was wrong.

1257
01:08:37,434 --> 01:08:40,733
Yeah, maybe we are alike.

1258
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:43,989
- No. I'm an original.

1259
01:09:21,815 --> 01:09:22,900
- Your sister

1260
01:09:45,278 --> 01:09:46,447
- Bye, Norman.

1261
01:11:52,324 --> 01:11:54,077
I fucked your boyfriend last night.

1262
01:11:57,585 --> 01:12:00,674
I frenched your boyfriend last night.

1263
01:12:12,113 --> 01:12:13,280
- Take it easy, tiger.

1264
01:12:13,282 --> 01:12:14,159
All that caffeine.

1265
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:16,078
- I really shouldn't drink.

1266
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,457
- So, Norman.

1267
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:19,710
- Sam's fine.

1268
01:12:19,712 --> 01:12:20,754
- Do you think I wouldn't
have helped you out

1269
01:12:20,756 --> 01:12:21,589
if you had called?

1270
01:12:21,591 --> 01:12:22,423
- Sure you'd have.

1271
01:12:22,425 --> 01:12:23,968
There are dozens of people who would've.

1272
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:26,223
- Because Catherine divorced you?

1273
01:12:26,225 --> 01:12:28,229
- Catherine isn't who bothers me anymore.

1274
01:12:30,066 --> 01:12:31,274
I love Annette Moffett.

1275
01:12:31,276 --> 01:12:33,947
I've loved her from the first
moment she told me that I did.

1276
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,534
- Look, you don't love her.

1277
01:12:35,536 --> 01:12:36,368
- I do too.

1278
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:37,665
- Then why aren't you with her?

1279
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:40,544
- Aren't you listening? I'm nuts.

1280
01:12:40,546 --> 01:12:42,715
- She's nuts.

1281
01:12:42,717 --> 01:12:44,092
- I was fired.

1282
01:12:44,094 --> 01:12:46,012
- Then you don't have
to quit them after all.

1283
01:12:46,014 --> 01:12:47,641
- I was fired because
you told the Goldhearts

1284
01:12:47,643 --> 01:12:48,475
we had a production.

1285
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:51,774
- Me? No, I would never
in a million years.

1286
01:12:51,776 --> 01:12:53,237
- Good. I'm just making sure.

1287
01:12:54,782 --> 01:12:57,162
- You're really guns
blazing today, aren't you?

1288
01:13:01,128 --> 01:13:01,963
What's that?

1289
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:06,261
- This is Mrs. Moffett's mail.

1290
01:13:06,263 --> 01:13:08,307
I picked it up when I
was drunk last night.

1291
01:13:08,309 --> 01:13:09,560
- You really shouldn't drink.

1292
01:13:09,562 --> 01:13:12,816
- How's about I pay you
500 to turn a trick for me?

1293
01:13:12,818 --> 01:13:14,235
- What kind?

1294
01:13:14,237 --> 01:13:15,741
- Guns blazing kind.

1295
01:14:32,519 --> 01:14:33,855
- Who's the cowboy?

1296
01:14:35,316 --> 01:14:36,399
- Where's the gun?

1297
01:14:36,401 --> 01:14:37,443
- It's just a prop.

1298
01:14:37,445 --> 01:14:39,447
- He didn't know that.

1299
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:42,829
- What seems to be the trouble?

1300
01:14:42,831 --> 01:14:43,667
Warren?

1301
01:14:45,461 --> 01:14:46,837
- No.

1302
01:14:46,839 --> 01:14:48,382
Goldhearts don't like that
you're helping Moffett

1303
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:49,635
get this picture up.

1304
01:14:49,637 --> 01:14:51,221
They don't like it one bit, Jimmy.

1305
01:14:51,223 --> 01:14:52,264
- I'm not.

1306
01:14:52,266 --> 01:14:54,018
I'm not. I'm not.

1307
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,189
I'm their business partner, I promise.

1308
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:59,404
- We both know that Rosemary
is their business partner.

1309
01:14:59,406 --> 01:15:01,659
- You've been in bed with dad's assistant

1310
01:15:01,661 --> 01:15:03,495
and his competition?

1311
01:15:03,497 --> 01:15:06,919
- Is that why the Goldhearts
were winking at you last night?

1312
01:15:06,921 --> 01:15:10,512
- Really, this
family is too much.

1313
01:15:12,265 --> 01:15:14,603
- Let me clear a few things.

1314
01:15:31,846 --> 01:15:34,474
- Oh, that makes sense.
- Oh, I get it!

1315
01:15:34,476 --> 01:15:37,691
- One thing is abundantly clear.

1316
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:42,031
Jimmy has been playing
you all the whole time.

1317
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:44,953
- I pitched that to you five years ago.

1318
01:15:44,955 --> 01:15:46,247
I wanted to do "The Humans."

1319
01:15:46,249 --> 01:15:49,671
We were meant to be partners.
- Doesn't a ring a bell.

1320
01:15:49,673 --> 01:15:53,721
- And then you, you went and
pitched to the Tims without me.

1321
01:15:53,723 --> 01:15:55,892
- You made a cuckhold of me, you fool.

1322
01:15:55,894 --> 01:15:57,144
It was retribution.

1323
01:15:57,146 --> 01:16:00,735
- You stole from me,
George, so I stole from you.

1324
01:16:00,737 --> 01:16:01,737
I stole your wife.

1325
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:02,948
I stole your money.

1326
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:05,244
I ratted you out to the Goldhearts.

1327
01:16:05,246 --> 01:16:07,541
"The Humans" is my movie.

1328
01:16:07,543 --> 01:16:09,293
- You should really read your mail.

1329
01:16:09,295 --> 01:16:10,880
- That's your job.

1330
01:16:10,882 --> 01:16:12,341
- It was my job.
- Is your job.

1331
01:16:12,343 --> 01:16:13,930
Obviously you're rehired.

1332
01:16:17,938 --> 01:16:21,527
- So what do you say we
drop the suit and keep on.

1333
01:16:21,529 --> 01:16:23,282
- So should we sign papers?

1334
01:16:26,496 --> 01:16:28,749
- So it was all
just a big misunderstanding.

1335
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:30,670
- I can't believe it
was you we were working with

1336
01:16:30,672 --> 01:16:31,507
this whole time.

1337
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,425
- We just
thought you were cutting

1338
01:16:33,427 --> 01:16:34,260
your husband out of the deal.
- Are you okay?

1339
01:16:34,262 --> 01:16:35,930
- Who knew I
was so good at business?

1340
01:16:35,932 --> 01:16:37,391
- Love makes me sick.

1341
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:38,393
- He may be an idiot

1342
01:16:38,395 --> 01:16:40,480
and he may lose his
priorities easily at times,

1343
01:16:40,482 --> 01:16:42,443
but he's my husband.
- Yeah.

1344
01:16:42,445 --> 01:16:45,075
- And I love him.
- Yeah, me too.

1345
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,639
- Why can't love be real, Sylvia?

1346
01:17:18,183 --> 01:17:19,433
- Who says it isn't?

1347
01:17:19,435 --> 01:17:20,814
- Life says it isn't.

1348
01:17:23,193 --> 01:17:24,028
Real life.

1349
01:17:27,493 --> 01:17:28,705
- You really like him?

1350
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:41,311
Then just throw yourself in the man's arms

1351
01:17:41,313 --> 01:17:42,356
and get it over with.

1352
01:17:46,991 --> 01:17:48,452
- You're the one he kissed.

1353
01:17:51,374 --> 01:17:52,834
- If Norman walked in this room right now

1354
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:55,090
do you think he would
even notice I was here?

1355
01:17:59,349 --> 01:18:00,182
- I love you.

1356
01:18:00,184 --> 01:18:02,019
I love you.

1357
01:18:02,021 --> 01:18:04,148
Not Annette, come with me!

1358
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:05,108
Come with me.

1359
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:06,402
I'm sorry.

1360
01:18:06,404 --> 01:18:07,781
I'm sorry.

1361
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:08,618
I'm sorry.

1362
01:18:20,057 --> 01:18:22,017
- If Norman walked in here right now,

1363
01:18:22,019 --> 01:18:24,273
do you think he would
even notice I was here?

1364
01:18:30,995 --> 01:18:32,246
Go on.

1365
01:18:32,248 --> 01:18:34,085
Tell him how you feel.

1366
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:45,107
Love is as real as you make it, Annie.

1367
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:26,439
- Where is everyone?

1368
01:19:27,483 --> 01:19:30,780
- Stepped out for a bit, celebrating.

1369
01:19:30,782 --> 01:19:32,201
- But you stayed behind?

1370
01:19:33,453 --> 01:19:35,541
- Someone has to read all these contracts.

1371
01:19:36,585 --> 01:19:39,589
There's something I should tell you.

1372
01:19:39,591 --> 01:19:40,718
- Okay, me first.

1373
01:19:43,558 --> 01:19:45,102
You look cute in the big chair.

1374
01:19:47,314 --> 01:19:49,441
- Thank you.

1375
01:19:49,443 --> 01:19:50,945
That's what I was going for.

1376
01:19:50,947 --> 01:19:53,826
That or Hollywood mogul.

1377
01:19:53,828 --> 01:19:54,663
- Now you.

1378
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,546
- My real name is Sam Leonard.

1379
01:19:59,548 --> 01:20:00,382
- Oh.

1380
01:20:02,595 --> 01:20:03,430
I like it.

1381
01:20:05,475 --> 01:20:08,607
That's all you had to say?

1382
01:20:14,118 --> 01:20:15,285
- Yeah.

1383
01:20:15,287 --> 01:20:16,957
Is that all you had to say?

1384
01:20:21,508 --> 01:20:24,890
- Well, pleased to meet you, Sam Leonard.

1385
01:20:34,241 --> 01:20:39,251
- You and I are about to
make a lot of money, Norm.

1386
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:41,047
- Have fun with the business stuff.

1387
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:44,428
- What's wrong with her?

1388
01:20:46,684 --> 01:20:48,186
- You wouldn't get it, George.

1389
01:20:59,543 --> 01:21:00,377
- Norman.

1390
01:21:04,678 --> 01:21:05,513
- Yes?

1391
01:21:07,976 --> 01:21:10,397
- Norman, there is something
we need to talk about.

1392
01:21:11,817 --> 01:21:13,278
- I can't imagine what about.

1393
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:16,282
- I told Annette about us.

1394
01:21:22,797 --> 01:21:25,425
- It was the right thing to do.

1395
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:27,597
- God, you're always so upstanding.

1396
01:21:27,599 --> 01:21:29,936
- Well, someone
has to be around here.

1397
01:21:31,022 --> 01:21:33,107
- I liked you better when you were drunk.

1398
01:21:33,109 --> 01:21:35,195
- I like me better when I'm drunk.

1399
01:21:35,197 --> 01:21:38,284
That's one of the things I'm working on.

1400
01:21:38,286 --> 01:21:41,123
- Norman, could
you come here a minute?

1401
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,002
- Just a second.

1402
01:21:43,004 --> 01:21:45,927
- Okay, but don't forget.

1403
01:21:49,809 --> 01:21:51,980
- Is there something else?

1404
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:56,949
- Why are you keeping my sister waiting?

1405
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:02,585
- Right.

1406
01:22:04,881 --> 01:22:06,050
- Bye, Norman.

1407
01:22:09,933 --> 01:22:10,768
- Sam.

1408
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:12,855
- Okay.

1409
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,017
- We've already been
through this, Annette.

1410
01:22:32,019 --> 01:22:33,687
- You drove me to this Norman.

1411
01:22:33,689 --> 01:22:35,442
You drove me to this.

1412
01:22:38,532 --> 01:22:39,366
- It's Sam.

1413
01:22:40,201 --> 01:22:41,661
- Okay, fine, Sam.

1414
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:44,542
You drove me to this.
- So what, you do this what?

1415
01:22:44,544 --> 01:22:45,376
Once a month?

1416
01:22:45,378 --> 01:22:46,671
- I do not.

1417
01:22:46,673 --> 01:22:48,675
Admit you love me right now.

1418
01:22:48,677 --> 01:22:49,928
- Or what, you're gonna shoot yourself?

1419
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:50,930
- Why not?

1420
01:22:50,932 --> 01:22:53,852
- Well, for one, this isn't
a real gun and this is crazy.

1421
01:22:53,854 --> 01:22:56,568
- So, I'm crazy about you.

1422
01:22:57,945 --> 01:22:58,779
- Well, what do you want me to do?

1423
01:22:58,781 --> 01:23:00,073
You want me to tell you how I feel?

1424
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:01,660
You want to pry it from my lips?

1425
01:23:01,662 --> 01:23:04,373
- If that what it takes.
- Did I miss the commercials?

1426
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:06,418
I've seen this film so many times before.

1427
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,715
- I'm holding Norman emotionally hostage.

1428
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:09,803
- Ah, please continue.

1429
01:23:10,763 --> 01:23:12,890
- Don't you think this would
be better as a private moment?

1430
01:23:12,892 --> 01:23:14,604
I've tried it in private, Norman.

1431
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,313
Just say it.

1432
01:23:16,315 --> 01:23:17,775
It isn't a big deal.

1433
01:23:17,777 --> 01:23:19,194
- Just say it.
- Just say it Norman.

1434
01:23:19,196 --> 01:23:20,614
- Please just say it.

1435
01:23:20,616 --> 01:23:21,448
- Just say it.

1436
01:23:21,450 --> 01:23:22,367
- This is a, it's a private...

1437
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:23,202
- Say it Norman, just say it, please.

1438
01:23:23,204 --> 01:23:24,287
- Just say it Norman.

1439
01:23:24,289 --> 01:23:25,791
- I'm trying to think, I'm trying.

1440
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:26,751
- I want you to say it.

1441
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:28,212
- I'm trying, okay!

1442
01:23:28,214 --> 01:23:29,381
Okay! Okay! Okay!

1443
01:23:29,383 --> 01:23:30,678
You wanna know how I feel?

1444
01:23:33,349 --> 01:23:37,188
Yes, yes I believe in love at first sight.

1445
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:39,361
Obviously I believe in
love at first sight.

1446
01:23:41,115 --> 01:23:44,036
But I must have poor vision
because it's the second time

1447
01:23:44,038 --> 01:23:47,127
it struck me and doesn't always end great.

1448
01:23:48,504 --> 01:23:49,966
- You do believe in love.

1449
01:23:51,135 --> 01:23:53,012
- I love you, Annette.

1450
01:23:53,014 --> 01:23:56,351
I've loved you since the
moment you shared a drink

1451
01:23:56,353 --> 01:23:57,607
in my crummy little tent.

1452
01:24:01,615 --> 01:24:04,159
I don't want to be in love.
I don't like being in love.

1453
01:24:04,161 --> 01:24:05,369
It's not fun for me.

1454
01:24:05,371 --> 01:24:07,792
- Fun's besides the point.

1455
01:24:07,794 --> 01:24:09,921
It's love, Norman.

1456
01:24:09,923 --> 01:24:12,177
If you love someone, you tell them.

1457
01:24:13,304 --> 01:24:15,559
- Not when you barely made
it through the last one.

1458
01:24:19,191 --> 01:24:20,110
- What's this?

1459
01:24:21,278 --> 01:24:22,905
- I love her.

1460
01:24:22,907 --> 01:24:24,575
- I just hired you back, Norman.

1461
01:24:24,577 --> 01:24:26,830
- Don't you dare fire him.

1462
01:24:26,832 --> 01:24:27,917
- Give me that.

1463
01:24:30,255 --> 01:24:31,548
- Oh, George.

1464
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:32,969
Not you too.

1465
01:24:34,388 --> 01:24:36,431
We were just figuring things out.

1466
01:24:36,433 --> 01:24:38,187
- Norman loves me, Mommy.

1467
01:24:39,398 --> 01:24:40,400
- Oh good.

1468
01:24:42,028 --> 01:24:43,989
I love that journey for you two.

1469
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:46,036
See, things are working out.

1470
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:50,713
- For you twats.

1471
01:24:53,886 --> 01:24:55,971
- What the hell are you doing?

1472
01:24:55,973 --> 01:24:58,392
- It's really getting pathetic, Jimmy.

1473
01:24:58,394 --> 01:25:00,522
- Norman loves me.

1474
01:25:00,524 --> 01:25:01,816
- Oh, does he?

1475
01:25:01,818 --> 01:25:03,612
That's fantastic. Great.

1476
01:25:03,614 --> 01:25:06,366
Why don't you go Juliette
yourself over thing?

1477
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:07,995
- You mean kill myself?

1478
01:25:07,997 --> 01:25:08,832
- Yeah!

1479
01:25:10,126 --> 01:25:12,546
All of you are so goddamn suicidal.

1480
01:25:12,548 --> 01:25:15,844
How are none of you dead yet?

1481
01:25:15,846 --> 01:25:17,723
- If only this thing were real.

1482
01:25:19,896 --> 01:25:20,981
- What the fuck?

1483
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:23,319
You shot me.

1484
01:25:24,404 --> 01:25:26,073
Mother fucker!

1485
01:25:26,075 --> 01:25:27,952
- It was real?

1486
01:25:27,954 --> 01:25:32,964
- Ah, you bitch!

1487
01:25:34,717 --> 01:25:35,552
- George?

1488
01:25:37,097 --> 01:25:40,894
We've had a real gun in
the house the whole time?

1489
01:25:40,896 --> 01:25:42,898
- I could have sworn it was a prop.

1490
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:44,944
- We shot a whole movie with that thing.

1491
01:25:44,946 --> 01:25:45,946
- And Here we
were dangerously close

1492
01:25:45,948 --> 01:25:48,242
to breaking Chekhov's gun rule

1493
01:25:48,244 --> 01:25:49,704
- It really does make all our moments

1494
01:25:49,706 --> 01:25:50,747
with the gun more impactful.

1495
01:25:50,749 --> 01:25:52,751
- Well, you
certainly impacted his leg

1496
01:25:52,753 --> 01:25:54,505
quite nicely.

1497
01:26:25,652 --> 01:26:26,487
- There you are.

1498
01:26:29,577 --> 01:26:30,660
- Why are you here?

1499
01:26:30,662 --> 01:26:32,330
Shouldn't you be calling an ambulance?

1500
01:26:32,332 --> 01:26:33,375
- It's only Jimmy.

1501
01:26:39,221 --> 01:26:41,100
- Why are you so desperate to love me?

1502
01:26:42,645 --> 01:26:44,398
- You really have it all backwards.

1503
01:26:45,901 --> 01:26:47,696
- I'm better on my own, much better.

1504
01:26:49,575 --> 01:26:51,284
- I don't think I'm being
too harsh when I say

1505
01:26:51,286 --> 01:26:54,084
you were an alcoholic
de-housed person on your own.

1506
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:56,378
- Will you just...

1507
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:57,215
- Yes?

1508
01:26:58,425 --> 01:26:59,261
- Just...

1509
01:27:01,599 --> 01:27:02,434
- Yes?

1510
01:27:07,778 --> 01:27:09,822
- Let's be done with this.
