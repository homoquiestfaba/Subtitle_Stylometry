00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:25,994
Hello.

2
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,297
- Hello.
- I'm coming!

3
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:33,272
I'm coming.

4
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:36,437
Hi.

5
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:38,910
I'm Jennifer Hills.
We spoke last week.

6
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:42,540
Oh, yeah, Miss Hills.

7
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:44,413
Mockingbird Trail, right?

8
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:45,975
That is right.

9
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:51,587
I don't suppose you know how
to get out there.

10
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,526
No, I don't.

11
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:58,789
Well, listen up.

12
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,866
It's a bit tricky.

13
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,165
- Keys.
- Thank you.

14
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,338
These arrows
will get you through town.

15
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:11,401
Over here

16
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:13,470
there are more
dirt roads and woods.

17
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:15,674
Your cabin's a real beaut.

18
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:18,240
But heck, there ain't another
for a good country mile.

19
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:21,015
I am looking forward
to the peace and quiet.

20
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,818
I知 actually a novelist
and I知 starting my next book here.

21
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:26,758
If that's what you're aiming for.

22
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:29,887
- You just follow this here map.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:31,316
Howdy, ma'am.

24
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,402
Excuse me.

25
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,837
I didn't mean to frighten you.

26
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:49,603
No, that is okay.

27
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:52,441
You know what?
I am actually lost.

28
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,946
I知 looking for Mockingbird Trail.

29
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,278
Mockingbird Trail.
Yeah, you're lost all right.

30
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:57,943
- Really?
- Yeah yeah, you're lost.

31
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,645
It痴 about 10 miles back.

32
00:03:59,686 --> 00:04:02,746
It痴 gonna be
on your left-hand side.

33
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:04,848
Gonna make a left
after a big red mailbox.

34
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,121
Okay, thanks.
I think I saw that.

35
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,960
You staying over in that cabin
on Mockingbird?

36
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:14,831
- Yeah.
- Fancy!

37
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:22,473
So you know you're running
a little hot.

38
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,535
Maybe I should check up
under your hood for you.

39
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,108
How's that line
working for you?

40
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:35,212
I don't know.
How's that line working for you?

41
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:45,055
- I got that.
- No, I got it.

42
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:46,656
No, I got it.

43
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,997
Oh shit.

44
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,505
I知 sorry, my bad.

45
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:55,508
- I hit the panic button.
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,407
- Are you okay?
- I知 fine.

47
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:00,311
Better check your underwear,
Johnny.

48
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:03,077
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I said I was fine.

49
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:05,676
- Okay.
- All right?

50
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:08,187
Keep the change.

51
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:21,497
Got you that time, Johnny.

52
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:23,502
Bye-bye.

53
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,164
How's the writing coming?

54
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,195
You kidding me?

55
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,173
I should have come out here
on my first book.

56
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,039
You gonna come back
for Hertz's party?

57
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:20,375
Jen? Did I lose you?

58
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,381
Oh, sorry.
Something just-

59
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:26,213
Hey.

60
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:29,085
- You still there?
- Barb, hold on a second.

61
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,728
- Jen, what's going on?
- Let me call you back.

62
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:49,227
You've got to be kidding me.

63
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:55,972
Way to go, Jennifer.

64
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,419
Ugh.

65
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,464
Ew!

66
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:49,478
No, it won't flush.

67
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,278
Did you check the seal
on the flapper?

68
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:52,784
I did that already.

69
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:56,311
- You did?
- Yes.

70
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,050
Look, I知 really in a spot here.

71
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,491
- All right, I'll send somebody.
- Okay okay.

72
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:02,084
Thank you.
Thank you.

73
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,289
- You'll be there?
- I知 not going anywhere.

74
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,820
All right, I値l send someone.

75
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,769
Aggh!

76
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,983
So is this gonna
take much longer?

77
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,589
Not much.

78
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:37,687
What's wrong with it?

79
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,510
Yes!

80
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,447
- All fixed.
- Oh, thank you.

81
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:06,485
Sorry. You saved me from having
to bathe in the lake.

82
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,359
Excuse me.
I, uh- excuse me.

83
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,124
Wait, I didn't-

84
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,830
Ground rule double.

85
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:19,861
Double my ass. Look at its head.
I knocked its eye clear out.

86
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:22,238
Fine, maybe a triple.

87
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,711
But you gotta knock its guts clean out
its mouth if you wanna score a run.

88
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,269
Man, would you turn
that shit off?

89
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:29,213
You're gonna get us in trouble
with that human society.

90
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,444
- It痴 humane, dipshit.
- Yeah, whatever.

91
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,149
I told you, Andy,
this thing's gonna make me a fortune.

92
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:41,283
So you two retards
gonna go fishing or what?

93
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,228
Hey, speaking of retards...

94
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:46,356
- Bull's-eye!
- Andy!

95
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:52,431
Well, Stanley,
got us all here now.

96
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:56,032
What's the big show?

97
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:58,134
The big show

98
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:00,236
is this.

99
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,147
What did you do this time,
film yourself lighting a fart?

100
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:08,076
I don't know why I bother
with you dipshits.

101
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,283
I got Matthew's girlfriend here
in a very private moment.

102
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:13,189
Girlfriend?

103
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:16,662
Matthew ain't had a girlfriend since
he was sucking on his mama's titties.

104
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:20,132
He had that city girl all alone
and he didn't even try to nail her.

105
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:23,263
What city girl?

106
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:24,769
You know what girl.

107
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,999
The one from the gas station
the other day.

108
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,007
The one that had you
on your ass.

109
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:33,111
She had Matt here fixing
her pipes.

110
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:36,774
She even gave him a kiss
for servicing her.

111
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,306
Bullshit.

112
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:42,344
No, she- she- she did, Johnny.
She kissed me.

113
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,856
Hey, Matthew,

114
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,118
don't you lie to me.

115
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:49,355
Here it comes.
Get ready for it.

116
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:52,558
Oh shit.

117
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:57,565
Hey, that's some good
camerawork, man.

118
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:00,538
You dirty dog, man.

119
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,131
How the fuck did you get that?

120
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:04,540
I've been working nights.

121
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,976
She sure is something
to look at.

122
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,412
Yeah yeah.

123
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,541
And she likes me.

124
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,017
Come on, Matthew.

125
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:15,384
That girl wouldn't even
give Johnny the time of day.

126
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:16,820
What?

127
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,017
Shit.

128
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:20,855
I can tame that ass
if I want to.

129
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:23,828
Come on, Johnny.
You saw that girl.

130
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:25,922
Stuck-up city bitch.

131
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:27,933
City bitch like that
is ungettable.

132
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,765
Bullshit. I値l get it.

133
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,762
Let me tell you something:

134
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:36,536
I had that bitch
creaming her panties.

135
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:39,373
Yeah, and she had you
shitting in yours.

136
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:43,942
You don't think I can have that
anytime I want to?

137
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:45,541
Hmm?

138
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,027
Let me tell you something:

139
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:57,859
Bitch like that,

140
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:01,458
she come out here for one reason
and one reason only.

141
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,095
Titties flopping in the window
like that for everyone to see.

142
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,105
Come on, you know.

143
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,130
No no.

144
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:13,077
She's not like that, Johnny.

145
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:17,048
They're all like that.

146
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,849
Big city cock-teasing whore
is all she is.

147
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:22,877
Fuckin' A.

148
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:26,821
Shit, Matthew.

149
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,521
You wouldn't know what to do with
a piece of ass like that if you got it.

150
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,621
No shit.

151
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:35,562
But you're lucky

152
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,228
'cause I知 your friend.

153
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,329
I値l show you the way.

154
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,318
Hello.

155
00:21:57,863 --> 00:22:00,297
Nice shot, huh?

156
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:01,663
Evening.

157
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,500
Get out of here.
Get out of here right now!

158
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:07,027
Well now.

159
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:08,733
That ain't very hospitable now, is it?

160
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:11,174
Smile real pretty
for the camera, girl.

161
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:15,136
Mm-mm-mm.

162
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,742
You all better get out
of here right now.

163
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:23,414
I called the cops.

164
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:26,253
Oh, she called the cops.

165
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:31,089
You called the police
or you will call the police?

166
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,725
I called them already.
They're on their way right now.

167
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,701
What phone did you
do that with?

168
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:39,568
Matthew told us you dropped
yours in the drain.

169
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,470
Bloop!

170
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:45,776
Let's pick it up.
Where the hell is that boy?

171
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:49,372
Matthew, get your bony ass in here!

172
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:52,145
- Come on.
- Come here, boy.

173
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:53,913
Get in here, boy.
Hey hey hey.

174
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,079
It痴 all right.
Come on now.

175
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:59,022
Come on, boy.
Come here.

176
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:04,319
Matthew here says

177
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:06,354
that you didn't pay him
for fixing your sink.

178
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:07,922
That's not true.

179
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:11,163
He ran out.

180
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:12,795
I値l take care of it.

181
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:14,567
He's shy, huh?

182
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:18,508
Look at that, Matthew.
Look at that. Look at that right there.

183
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:20,637
Hold up, wait a minute.

184
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,912
Let's not worry
about any of that right now.

185
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,924
What's a pretty little thing like you

186
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,324
doing out here all alone?

187
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,851
I知 writing.

188
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:40,091
I知 a writer.

189
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,930
She's a writer.

190
00:23:42,968 --> 00:23:44,833
My boyfriend will be here soon.

191
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,100
He's coming up
to the cabin.

192
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,437
Is that right?

193
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,170
Oh!

194
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,768
Well, shit.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

195
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:55,279
Boys, now we better
blow on out of here.

196
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:57,441
We don't wanna interrupt
your date night.

197
00:23:57,483 --> 00:24:01,078
Date night!

198
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,111
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart:

199
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:06,716
There ain't no man
in his right mind

200
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,091
that leaves a pretty little thing

201
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:11,926
like you out here

202
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:13,488
all alone.

203
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,834
He's coming.

204
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,497
Night's almost over.

205
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:28,703
Oh wow.

206
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:39,685
Come here.

207
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:41,556
Come here, have a drink with me.
Come on over here.

208
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:48,462
Come here, pretty little thing.

209
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,525
Come here,
have a drink with me.

210
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,503
No.

211
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,802
Oh, there you go.

212
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,535
I don't want to.

213
00:24:56,575 --> 00:25:00,443
What's the matter?
You too good to have a drink with us?

214
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,743
- See?
- Mm-hmm.

215
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:04,874
Please, I just don't want to
have a drink.

216
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,283
What is this shit right here?

217
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,651
'Cause that's already
been opened.

218
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:12,657
Well shit, boys.
You were right.

219
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:14,784
She's too good
to have a drink with us.

220
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:16,294
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:18,319
What are we to you?

222
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:20,888
A bunch of dirt?

223
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:22,730
I didn't say that.

224
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:24,736
Fuckin' A,
this bitch is a writer.

225
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,228
"No one wants a phone call

226
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:29,740
at 2:00 in the morning.

227
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:31,709
When you're 15,
it's a prank call.

228
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:34,803
When you're 21,
it's a drunk boyfriend call.

229
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,872
But after 25,

230
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,543
it's usually really bad news.

231
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:42,918
That's how I found out
my father died."

232
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:45,753
Whose daddy died?

233
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:50,787
Can't you all
just please leave me alone?

234
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:53,127
No!

235
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,600
Just tell me what you want.

236
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:02,433
What do you want?
I offered you my money.

237
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:04,965
Mm-hmm.

238
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,501
Whoa!

239
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:18,616
Here. Here.

240
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,923
Fine. I値l have a drink.

241
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:24,826
Then you have to leave.

242
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:27,627
- All right.
- All right.

243
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:33,335
That ain't shit.

244
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:36,034
- Come on. Boo!
- Come on now.

245
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:39,271
Now see, I-

246
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:42,508
I know you can
do better than that.

247
00:26:42,547 --> 00:26:44,538
I知 sure that when you're
out there in the city

248
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,814
with all your hoity-toity
rich friends,

249
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:49,718
I bet you can throw 'em back
with the best of 'em.

250
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,347
Now can't you?

251
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,654
- I took the drink-
- I said drink that shit!

252
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:03,490
- Come on. There you go.
- Chug chug! Guzzle!

253
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,003
- Whoo!
- There it is. There it is.

254
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:09,599
All right, shit.

255
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:11,905
See, that's not
so bad now, is it?

256
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:17,676
Listen, I知 sorry
I embarrassed you the other day.

257
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:20,844
But we're even now, right?

258
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:24,652
Okay?
Just please leave.

259
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,056
Please leave.

260
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:30,186
Well, that's just not
what this is about no more.

261
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:37,001
What is it about?

262
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:43,032
I wanna see your teeth.

263
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:48,069
What?

264
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,906
You heard me,

265
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,418
pretty little show horse.

266
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:56,353
I want

267
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,754
to see

268
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,417
your teeth.

269
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:04,694
That-

270
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,960
I don't want to- no.

271
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,570
Now you're gonna show
them teeth.

272
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:20,203
You have beautiful teeth.

273
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:23,408
There.

274
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,452
There. Let me see 'em.
Real pretty. Real pretty.

275
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:37,495
Let's see more.

276
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,463
Put your fingers

277
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:43,264
on the inside of your mouth
right there.

278
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:46,634
Now take the other two,
stick 'em on the other side.

279
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,798
There you go.

280
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,273
Now pull.

281
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:53,744
Okay, please, I知 begging you,
just go.

282
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:55,508
No.

283
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:01,845
Again.

284
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:07,591
Come here.
There it is.

285
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:09,992
Oh man, yeah! Yeah!

286
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:13,156
Yeah, that's it.
Come here. All right.

287
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:17,032
Shh!

288
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:19,299
That's my pretty little show horse.
Look at you.

289
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:25,508
You know why I know you
ain't got no boyfriend?

290
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:28,274
You know why?

291
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:32,113
'Cause all them
city boys are faggots.

292
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,549
Fuckin' A.

293
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:46,887
Since you ain't got
no boyfriend,

294
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:49,230
well, shit, I figured that...

295
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:56,506
this would be
your man tonight.

296
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,339
Yeah.

297
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:02,244
No?
Come here.

298
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,711
Come on,
give him a little kiss.

299
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:11,210
Give him a little kiss,
come on.

300
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:13,383
Give him a little kiss here.

301
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:15,393
Give him
a little kiss here. Kiss him.

302
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:17,588
Oh shit, come on now.

303
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:20,564
Come on now. I ain't talking about no
fucking peck like you gave Matthew.

304
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,534
I want you to give him
a little kiss now. Go on, kiss him.

305
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:26,298
Get up on your knees.

306
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:32,039
If I don't like
your enthusiasm,

307
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:34,739
I may come bad.

308
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,344
Open up.
Open up.

309
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:44,218
There it is. There it is.
There it is.

310
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:46,121
All right, all right.

311
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:49,559
Breathe through your nose.
Come on, you know this.

312
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,084
Just like it's your
first time again.

313
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:54,030
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.

314
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,532
All right, all right.

315
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,092
Shit!

316
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:03,537
Come on now.
Let's let Matthew have the girl.

317
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:06,271
I d-don't want to.

318
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,710
I don't.

319
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:11,113
What?
What the fuck did you say?

320
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,641
What the hell you mean
you d-d-don't want to?

321
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:17,314
I don't want to, Johnny.

322
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,949
- He d-d-don't want to.
- Come on.

323
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,618
Listen to me.

324
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,594
Fuck that, man.

325
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:25,459
I ain't fucking waiting.

326
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:26,828
Aw shit!

327
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:29,265
She-she likes me.

328
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:30,461
She likes you, Matthew?

329
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:32,299
Go ahead.

330
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:35,898
- Please.
- Suck it, bitch.

331
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:38,307
Come on now.
We're doing this for you.

332
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:39,970
Go prove it to me.

333
00:31:40,011 --> 00:31:42,138
Uh-huh.

334
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:46,609
- Oh God.
- Oh shit!

335
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:51,247
Come on, boys!

336
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:25,850
Whoa there.

337
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,017
Whoa there.
Easy, darling.

338
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:33,957
- Help me! Help me, please.
- Okay, I got you.

339
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,990
I was assaulted.

340
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:37,797
He came into my cabin
and he had a gun.

341
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:40,066
Ma'am, it's okay.
You need to calm down now, please.

342
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:41,663
It was in my mouth.

343
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:43,435
He put a gun in my mouth.
You don't understand.

344
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:44,965
I know this one.

345
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,137
She rented the place
down on Mockingbird Trail.

346
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:50,511
- I was assaulted.
- Hey, it's okay.

347
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:52,812
I知 a sheriff.

348
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:54,751
You're safe.

349
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:57,721
Now tell me what happened.

350
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:59,815
These four men-

351
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:02,349
there were four men
and they broke into my cabin.

352
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:04,828
And they had a gun
and they assaulted me.

353
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:07,730
Did you get a nice look at them?
Can you ID 'em?

354
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:10,701
Yes, I'd seen them.

355
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:12,862
- Around here?
- Yes, they work at the service station

356
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:15,065
- right outside of town.
- John Miller, no doubt.

357
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:17,904
Yes, they called him Johnny.
And there was this heavyset guy.

358
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:20,274
Sounds like them boys have
been up to no good again.

359
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:22,780
All right, Earl,
you head on back.

360
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:25,908
- Me and Miss-
- Hills. Jennifer Hills.

361
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,645
Me and Miss Hills are gonna head
on over to the cabin

362
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:30,450
and straighten things out.

363
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:01,081
Miller!

364
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,144
Miller, this is the sheriff.

365
00:34:03,188 --> 00:34:06,351
You and your boys are still here,
you come on out right now.

366
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:26,204
Miller, if you're up there,
you'll be leaving by the window.

367
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:32,012
Ma'am, stay here.

368
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:08,545
You here alone?

369
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:10,816
Yes.

370
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:19,997
With all this?

371
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:22,329
I didn't plan on drinking it all
right away.

372
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,961
I was gonna be here
for a couple months.

373
00:35:25,003 --> 00:35:27,130
You drink some this evening?

374
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:28,639
Yes.

375
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:51,391
One of them went upstairs
and he went through everything.

376
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:04,699
They do this too?

377
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:07,336
Please, I really don't care
about any of that.

378
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,948
How long you been here?

379
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:13,041
Just a couple days.

380
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:17,414
Anything strange happen
before this?

381
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:21,414
You have a run-in
with any of these guys?

382
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:23,484
No, not really.

383
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:26,361
Just stopped for gas
and directions.

384
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:33,970
Ma'am, is this your
marijuana cigarette?

385
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:37,600
Um, no.

386
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:40,270
One of the boys
must have left it.

387
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:45,140
You mean to tell me one
of them guys is wearing lipstick?

388
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,917
This ain't the big city.

389
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:52,479
Please, I may have smoked a joint,

390
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:54,617
but that doesn't mean
that I made any of this up.

391
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:58,526
This is Storch.
I知 at Mockingbird cabin.

392
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:01,828
- Gonna need some backup.
- Backup?

393
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:04,699
What could you possibly
need backup for? I知 the victim.

394
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:07,296
Ma'am, you've been drinking,

395
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:09,203
smoking marijuana cigarettes.

396
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,971
You got enough booze in here to put
the whole town three sheets to the wind.

397
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:16,208
You're running around in your sleeping
garments at the crack of dawn.

398
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:17,714
You gotta see this
from my point of view.

399
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:21,241
What? They came in here
and they assaulted me.

400
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:22,810
You have to believe me.

401
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:25,220
Ma'am, I知 just trying
to get to the bottom of this.

402
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:26,723
You're making serious accusations

403
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:29,352
about boys I致e known
since they was kids.

404
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:32,830
And you haven't been
altogether truthful now, have you?

405
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,528
Now please,
step up against the wall.

406
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:53,012
Shoulder width apart.

407
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:07,491
Ma'am, please.

408
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:09,898
Look right ahead.

409
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:32,381
Now...

410
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:35,824
I want the whole story.

411
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,760
You tell me the whole thing.

412
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:42,896
You start by telling me
what those boys did.

413
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:45,425
Tell the sheriff the truth,
show horse.

414
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:53,233
Better yet,
why don't you show him?

415
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,776
Show him how that pretty little mouth
of yours couldn't get enough

416
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:03,446
- as far as I recall.
- Is that right?

417
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,432
They do this?

418
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:28,610
Nice little tits.

419
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:42,054
I asked you a question.

420
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:48,163
Please.

421
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,967
You show the sheriff
your teeth there, show horse.

422
00:39:53,004 --> 00:39:54,437
Come on.

423
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,768
- Come on, move.
- Get!

424
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,175
Move!

425
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,911
Now whinny.

426
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:14,485
I said whinny!

427
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:17,323
- Whinny!
- Oh, man!

428
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:20,660
Whinny! Whinny! Whinny!

429
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,464
Huh. Huh.

430
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,803
Now get on your knees.
Keep going.

431
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:35,005
Keep whinnying, show horse.

432

Here we go.

433
00:40:36,981 --> 00:40:38,972
Get on your knees.

434
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:43,543
Keep whinnying!

435
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:45,681
Oh-ho-ho!

Come on.
On your feet, show horse.

00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:59,733
On your feet or you're not
gonna get your sugar cube.

439
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:01,534
Matthew,

440
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:02,834
We're gonna get

441
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:04,501
Huh-uh.

442
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:06,510

443
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:10,480
Stop that rubber band shit, homo.

444
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:14,315
You wanna talk the talk,

Oh, what the hell, Matthew?
He ain't even hard yet.

455
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:54,050
Well, it's not totally his fault.

00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,871
I know, I know, sweetheart.

511
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:34,680
Daddy's real busy.

Damn it. Oh shit!

516
00:44:51,268 --> 00:44:54,032
You're the shit, Matthew.

517
00:44:54,071 --> 00:44:56,369
You're getting your ass beat
by a woman.

518
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:01,401
Matthew,
you better control that bitch.

519
00:45:01,445 --> 00:45:03,413
Hold her down. Yeah.

520
00:45:03,447 --> 00:45:04,914

00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:35,305
Yeah, boy.

Over there.

523
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:46,888
Ain't that romantic?

524
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:48,915
You clean that shit up.

525
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:50,426
Make her do it.

526
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:52,986
You heard him. Clean it up.

527
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:56,522
Hey, Matthew, get back here.
You all right, boy?

528
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:58,535
Oh man, this is so like my fantasy.

529
00:46:01,305 --> 00:46:03,068
You can thank me later.

530
00:46:03,107 --> 00:46:06,304
You calm down, boy.

531
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:08,334
You did all right, Matthew.

532
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:17,680
No no.

533
00:47:17,715 --> 00:47:19,580
Please.

534
00:47:24,355 --> 00:47:25,617
No.

535
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:30,585
No no.

536
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:40,468
You ever get mace in your eyes, bitch?
That shit hurts.

537
00:47:40,504 --> 00:47:43,405
- Now take a look, honey.
- No.

538
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,432
I値l bet you're thirsty, huh?

539
00:47:46,477 --> 00:47:48,843
Why don't you have a drink?

540
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:58,483
- Do it again!
- You like that? Let's have another one.

541
00:47:58,522 --> 00:48:01,320
Hold her down.
Hold her head down.

542
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:10,600
All right, boys,

543
00:48:10,634 --> 00:48:12,158
that filly's got a few more races
to run.

544
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:19,342
You like that, girl?

545
00:48:19,376 --> 00:48:22,834
You like that sweet water, huh? Yeah.

546
00:48:24,048 --> 00:48:26,778
You got some fight
left in you, Miss Hills.

547
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:28,978
I like things rough.

548
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:32,546
Please. Please.

549
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:37,160
- Yeah.
- I知 sore.

550
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:38,991
Please.

551
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:42,358
I知 sore.

552
00:48:46,403 --> 00:48:47,665
Don't worry now, sweetheart.

553
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:52,676
I知 an ass man.

554
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:45,622
No teeth, show horse.

555
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:47,654
No teeth.

556
00:49:51,702 --> 00:49:53,897
Whoo!

557
00:50:07,584 --> 00:50:10,178
God damn, Stanley.

558
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,848
30 seconds.
Must be a new record for you, man.

559
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,380
That bitch was too tight.

560
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:17,792
Don't you know you're supposed
to wait for the lady?

561
00:50:17,828 --> 00:50:20,729
Shit, man, like she cares.

562
00:50:20,764 --> 00:50:22,664
She's laying there
like a dead fish.

563
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,635
Besides, she's bleeding as all hell.
Wonder if the bitch got messed up.

564
00:50:25,669 --> 00:50:28,433
Yeah, right. We all thought
Matthew was gonna

565
00:50:28,472 --> 00:50:30,736
be the pussy today, huh?

566
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:33,572
Don't know what
you're bragging about, Andy.

567
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,408
Clocked you
just over two minutes.

568
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:38,176
It's been a while, man.

569
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:39,876
I知 out of practice.

570
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:43,045
It痴 been, I don't know,
maybe 10 years.

571
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:45,448
Where you going?

572
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:48,049
God damn,
she's got some fight in her.

573
00:52:18,182 --> 00:52:19,809
Come on, let's chase.

574
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:23,081
Where does she think she's going?

575
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:43,563
Well, it was fun
while it lasted, Miss Hills.

576
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:58,512
Shit!

577
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:05,457
Where is she?

578
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:10,323
Hell, she's gotta
come up for air sometime.

579
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:12,562
Shit.

580
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,148
Gators must have
got her by now. Right, Sheriff?

581
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:35,185
Listen up.

582
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:38,251
Creek ends about six miles
downstream in Watson.

583
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:41,287
Between here and there,
we're gonna find her.

584
00:53:41,331 --> 00:53:44,027
We split up.
We check the banks,

585
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:45,500
in the timber, under rocks.

586
00:53:45,536 --> 00:53:48,198
Hell, you see a hole big enough
for her, I want you in there.

587
00:53:48,238 --> 00:53:51,503
And do not stop till y'all
find me a dead city whore.

588
00:54:08,825 --> 00:54:10,019
Nothing.

589
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:15,989
Not a goddamn thing.

590
00:54:30,247 --> 00:54:32,511
Now what?

591
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:35,541
Her body will show up one way
or another.

592
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:40,387
Every day we're
gonna check the ravine,

593
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:43,791
from the bridge
straight down through here and back.

594
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:45,727
Two shifts a day
till we find something.

595
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:47,320
For how long?

596
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:52,494
Till I goddamn fucking say. Clear?

597
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:58,367
Andy, you get on back to the cabin.
Clean her shit up.

598
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:01,309
Burn it, all of it.
You hear me?

599
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:04,007
Yes sir.

600
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:05,912
You get her wheels
down the shop.

601
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:08,213
Strip it down to its
last goddamn nut.

602
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:10,082
That's gonna take two weeks.

603
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:17,123
All right, Sheriff, yeah.

604
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,321
I値l have Andy torch it out

605
00:55:19,363 --> 00:55:21,490
and I値l rub the numbers out.

606
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:31,137
Asshole!

607
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:34,405
The fuck you saving that for,
you moron?

608
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:36,742
It痴 fucking evidence!

609
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:41,713
I shit you not!

610
00:55:57,801 --> 00:56:00,395
I need you all on point
for this.

611
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:03,304
And I mean goddamn
fucking point.

612
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,070
We clear?

613
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:10,277
Now pony up.

614
00:56:10,313 --> 00:56:12,781
We got shit to do.

615
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:15,444
Burn that effing tape.

616
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,417
Well, that's all of it,

617
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:25,087
right down
to her little titty sling.

618
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:38,068
Man, this fire's
making me hungry.

619
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:40,076
Well, there's a headline.

620
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,578
We gotta finish this shit.

621
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:45,137
We gotta get that car
in the garage.

622
00:56:45,182 --> 00:56:48,151
Then you can stuff your face
till you puke.

623
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:53,512
Where the hell's Matthew at?

624
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:56,788
He ain't one
to stay behind.

625
00:56:56,827 --> 00:57:00,786
He was looking around the water like
some crazed dog after a bone, man.

626
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:03,698
You keep an eye on him.

627
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:05,793
We gotta make sure
he keeps it together, you hear me?

628
00:57:07,404 --> 00:57:09,395
Just at least until
this shit's over.

629
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:50,076
Gone all day,
I got nervous.

630
00:57:50,113 --> 00:57:52,980
- Anything worth telling?
- Just the usual.

631
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:56,417
The mess they got on Highway 1
took forever.

632
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:57,920
- Daddy.
- How's my angel?

633
00:57:57,954 --> 00:57:59,421
Daddy.

634
00:57:59,456 --> 00:58:01,117
Got anything on the stove?

635
00:58:01,158 --> 00:58:04,321
Sure, I値l reheat it.
You'll be proud.

636
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,352
Proud of what?

637
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:12,701
I was accepted
to the honors program, Daddy.

638
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:16,272
- Can you believe it?
- Of course I can.

639
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:18,797
I expect nothing less
from my angel.

640
00:58:18,842 --> 00:58:21,606
Mommy and I are
proud of you.

641
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,348
I知 gonna shower up.

642
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:54,502
Every time I come in here
this place gets worse.

643
00:58:54,544 --> 00:58:56,774
Yeah,
and business keeps getting

644
00:58:56,813 --> 00:58:58,906
better and better.

645
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:10,518
Mockingbird Trail.

646
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,925
Miss Hills.

647
00:59:11,962 --> 00:59:14,157
She left?

648
00:59:14,197 --> 00:59:16,392
She did indeed.

649
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:19,231
I couldn't make head
nor tail of it.

650
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:22,204
I found empty cases of booze,

651
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,332
marijuana cigarettes.

652
00:59:24,374 --> 00:59:25,568
Crazy wild one.

653
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:27,770
She'd have made
a preacher cuss.

654
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:30,803
- My lucky day.
- Why's that?

655
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:33,281
No refund policy.

656
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:35,944
Christmas come early.

657
00:59:35,986 --> 00:59:37,817
Enjoy it.

658
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:41,991
Speaking of early,
next month's quail season.

659
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:43,652
I don't know about you,

660
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:46,856
but I知 getting tired
of shooting squirrels.

661
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:49,957
Me too.

662
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:25,124
- Thank you.
- You have a pretty smile.

663
01:00:25,168 --> 01:00:28,331
Did you just come here
to see me?

664
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:30,339
Happy hour, boys.

665
01:00:30,373 --> 01:00:33,706
Fuckin' A.
Here's to your mama.

666
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:41,644
I just want all this bullshit
to be over.

667
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:20,881
No!

668
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:56,625
He's the big black guy
in the red drawstring.

669
01:01:56,659 --> 01:01:58,559
You're talking about the garbage man.

670
01:01:58,595 --> 01:02:00,256
Well, give the man a turkey.

671
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,960
- Hello.
- Yeah.

672
01:02:07,003 --> 01:02:10,404
It痴 Earl.

673
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,101
- Earl.
- Yeah.

674
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:15,111
This woman leaves a message
on the machine.

675
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:16,578
Barbara something or other.

676
01:02:16,613 --> 01:02:18,308
Yeah, so?

677
01:02:18,348 --> 01:02:21,078
She was asking
about that Miss Hills.

678
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:23,847
Says no one's seen her
in over a month.

679
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:26,879
Ain't that about the time
she split?

680
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:29,187
Yeah.

681
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:31,284
Yeah, and you know the story.

682
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:34,194
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

683
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,256
I think you should
call her back.

684
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,860
I mean, heck, Sheriff,

685
01:02:39,903 --> 01:02:42,030
you may have been
the last one to see her.

686
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:47,605
Sheriff?

687
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:50,306
Okay, I値l call her.

688
01:02:50,346 --> 01:02:52,678
Good.
You want the number?

689
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:56,276
No, it's late.

690
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,810
I値l get it from you
in the AM.

691
01:03:01,691 --> 01:03:03,090
We're still on
for tomorrow, right?

692
01:03:03,126 --> 01:03:05,617
Yeah, of course.

693
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:11,033
Everything all right?

694
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:13,535
Yeah, just fine.

695
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:22,838
It痴 gone!

696
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,676
Look at that.

697
01:03:24,714 --> 01:03:26,705
Looks like someone
spooked the cattle.

698
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,952
It痴 gone!

699
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,616
It痴 fucking gone!

700
01:03:34,657 --> 01:03:36,921
Jesus, Stanley,
calm the fuck down.

701
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,450
What's got your nuts
in a sling?

702
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,430
My camera, it's gone.
Someone stole it.

703
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:44,126
Maybe you accidentally ate it.

704
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:46,658
Fuck off, man,
this is serious!

705
01:03:50,073 --> 01:03:51,665
It had the tape in it.

706
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:53,835
What are you talking about?

707
01:03:53,877 --> 01:03:55,936
The tape.

708
01:03:55,979 --> 01:03:58,106
The fucking tape.

709
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:02,213
The tape Storch smashed to bits?
That tape?

710
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:04,379
Oh, man,
Storch didn't smash shit.

711
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,183
I replaced it
with a new one.

712
01:04:06,222 --> 01:04:10,056
The Sheriff stomped
on the one that had nothing on it.

713
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:17,561
You kept that tape, huh?

714
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,329
You kept that tape,
you stupid piece of shit?

715
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:21,929
Come here.
You kept that tape?

716
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:24,462
- You kept that fucking tape?
- Please, Andy!

717
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:27,374
- Hey hey hey!
- What's wrong with you?

718
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:30,072
- How could you lose that fucking tape?
- Come on, man.

719
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:31,808
Come on.

720
01:04:31,848 --> 01:04:34,408
Gotta stick together
on this one.

721
01:04:35,618 --> 01:04:37,586
You're too dumb to know
how dumb you are.

722
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,451
You know that?

723
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:23,826
Uh-huh.

724
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:26,562
Is that right?

725
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:30,797
Is that right?

726
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:43,110
I better not find you,
you little fucker.

727
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:15,639
All right.
All right, let's go.

728
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:18,552
Come on out, fucker.

729
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:20,988
Come on!

730
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:22,685
You think this shit's funny?

731
01:06:28,464 --> 01:06:30,830
Andy?

732
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:34,460
Stanley?

733
01:06:38,775 --> 01:06:40,868
Fucking pussies.

734
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:45,406
All right. All right.

735
01:07:14,944 --> 01:07:17,913
That's it, God damn it.

736
01:07:17,947 --> 01:07:21,110
Yeah, come on!
Come on! Come on!

737
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:24,085
Yeah!
Come on, fucker!

738
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,851
Come on out, fucker.

739
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:32,292
Oh shit.

740
01:07:35,031 --> 01:07:37,591
Come on.
Come on.

741
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:39,624
Come on. Come on.

742
01:07:55,218 --> 01:07:57,413
Son of a bitch.

743
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:05,422
Sweetheart.

744
01:08:08,698 --> 01:08:10,632
They're beautiful.

745
01:08:11,868 --> 01:08:13,665
I致e been so busy.

746
01:08:13,703 --> 01:08:16,433
No need to explain.

747
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:19,498
You hadn't taken a single day off.
You're only human.

748
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:20,975
I guess.

749
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,478
Maybe you can help me with something
while I put these in water.

750
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:25,003
Help with what?

751
01:08:25,047 --> 01:08:28,039
I got this tape delivered,
but it don't fit our machine.

752
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:29,984
What tape?

753
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:32,681
It came this morning.
I think it's Chastity's recital.

754
01:08:38,995 --> 01:08:40,895
Chastity see this?

755
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:43,831
No. Like I said,
we couldn't get it to play.

756
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:46,596
Where is she?

757
01:08:46,636 --> 01:08:48,627
She's sleeping. Why?

758
01:08:51,574 --> 01:08:53,565
I知 gonna be back.

759
01:09:05,688 --> 01:09:07,679
Where the hell you been?

760
01:09:07,723 --> 01:09:11,215
Beauty queen over here
doing his hair for two hours.

761
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,627
What's this all about, man?

762
01:09:14,664 --> 01:09:16,598
- Where'd you get that?
- Where'd I get that?

763
01:09:16,632 --> 01:09:18,930
Right there.
That's where I got that.

764
01:09:18,968 --> 01:09:21,266
Somebody left me a present
last night on my doorstep.

765
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:24,501
Jesus, man, Matthew!
Come on!

766
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,531
- You boys seen him?
- No, man.

767
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:29,511
No one knows where he's at.

768
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:34,812
- Oh shit!
- This shit ain't good.

769
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,889
What?

770
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:46,855
I didn't do anything, Sheriff.

771
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:49,922
You wanna tell me why
this was dropped off to my house?

772
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:53,863
To my wife!

773
01:09:58,107 --> 01:10:01,975
What's on the tape?
Is this some kind of fucked up joke?

774
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:04,138
I smashed the damn thing myself!

775
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,946
No, Sheriff.
Genius there reloaded the camera.

776
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:10,282
The one you smashed
ain't got nothing on it.

777
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:12,719
You knew about this?

778
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:15,986
No, Sheriff,
I just found out about it myself.

779
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:19,324
Eat that tape, fat boy!

780
01:10:19,362 --> 01:10:22,525
Fucking tape!

781
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:24,294
You think it's funny?

782
01:10:26,736 --> 01:10:29,762
You screwed up, fat boy.

783
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:32,239
Sheriff.
It was Matthew, Sheriff.

784
01:10:32,275 --> 01:10:34,709
I mean, dipshit there,
he kept the tape as a souvenir,

785
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:36,575
but Matthew's the one
that took it, Sheriff.

786
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:39,775
Look at this. Silly bastard
left me a present last night.

787
01:10:39,815 --> 01:10:42,010
He's obsessed with her, man.

788
01:10:44,186 --> 01:10:46,746
I think he even
feels guilty.

789
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:49,952
You dipshits bring him to me.

790
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:53,762
I知 gonna cut
his retard pecker off

791
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:55,787
and use it as a goddamn
hood ornament.

792
01:10:55,831 --> 01:10:58,197
That's before I知 done shoving it
up your dirt hole.

793
01:10:58,234 --> 01:11:00,134
Shit, we've been looking
for him, Sheriff.

794
01:11:00,169 --> 01:11:02,103
Trust me, we've been
everywhere looking for him.

795
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,951
I want him found tonight.

796
01:11:21,357 --> 01:11:22,915
Or I swear to Christ,

797
01:11:22,959 --> 01:11:25,985
I値l bring the wrath of God
down on you.

798
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:03,965
Can you believe there used
to be a limit on quail?

799
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,436
Goddamn things
are like locusts now.

800
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,836
Much to our good fortune.

801
01:12:12,074 --> 01:12:14,440
I gotta take a break.

802
01:12:14,477 --> 01:12:17,037
My dogs are barking
something fierce.

803
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:22,974
I remember when you and my old man
chased that buck

804
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:26,045
out from the hollows
on Stickler Farm before bagging it.

805
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:30,622
Aww. Them were
the good old days.

806
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,561
To the good old days.

807
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:37,191
Well, fancy.
To what do I owe?

808
01:12:37,233 --> 01:12:38,564
You just enjoy it.

809
01:12:45,775 --> 01:12:48,642
This is some fine whiskey.

810
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:54,538
Usually you don't get
something like this except at baptisms

811
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:57,051
and weddings.

812
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:59,418
And funerals.

813
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:08,562
Loose ends, Earl.

814
01:13:12,668 --> 01:13:14,863
Loose ends.

815
01:13:33,355 --> 01:13:36,222
Matthew.

816
01:13:38,694 --> 01:13:41,424
I知 over here.

817
01:13:48,037 --> 01:13:50,028
Matthew.

818
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:56,334
Matthew.

819
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:29,868
I- I knew-
knew you were alive.

820
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:33,139
I knew it.

821
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:35,707
How did you know, Matthew?

822
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:37,981
Huh?

823
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:40,580
How did you know
I was alive?

824
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:44,184
Are you sure
you're not dreaming?

825
01:14:46,829 --> 01:14:48,626
Am I?

826
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:50,564
Am I dreaming?

827
01:14:50,599 --> 01:14:52,965
Come here.

828
01:14:53,002 --> 01:14:54,833
Sit with me.

829
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:08,939
I need to tell you-

830
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:11,578
Shh!

831
01:15:13,956 --> 01:15:17,619
I know, Matthew.

832
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,890
I know this wasn't your fault.

833
01:15:22,398 --> 01:15:24,366
You tried to help me.

834
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,197
I did.

835
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:30,228
I really really did.

836
01:15:33,008 --> 01:15:34,839
And- and-

837
01:15:34,877 --> 01:15:37,004
and you're okay.

838
01:15:37,046 --> 01:15:41,039
You're- you're okay.

839
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:45,076
Yes, Matthew.

840
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:49,916
Now come.

841
01:15:54,964 --> 01:15:56,955
Come on.

842
01:15:56,999 --> 01:15:58,466
It痴 okay.

843
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:02,838
It痴 okay.

844
01:16:02,872 --> 01:16:06,808
- I知 sorry.
- Shh. Come on.

845
01:16:06,842 --> 01:16:09,936
I知 so sorry.

846
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:19,712
Oh God!

847
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:29,822
I知 so sorry.

848
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:31,628
Matthew.

849
01:16:35,638 --> 01:16:38,072
- Matthew.
- Yeah.

850
01:16:38,107 --> 01:16:40,041
- Matthew, look at me.
- Yeah.

851
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,345
Tell me again
how sorry you are.

852
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:09,895
I知- I知- I知 sorry.

853
01:17:12,574 --> 01:17:15,372
It痴 just not good enough!

854
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:26,956
Matthew!

855
01:17:31,727 --> 01:17:33,820
Matthew!

856
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:38,995
Matthew!

857
01:17:41,303 --> 01:17:43,430
Matthew!

858
01:17:59,355 --> 01:18:01,346
Matthew!

859
01:18:07,463 --> 01:18:09,522
Come on out, Matthew.

860
01:18:14,003 --> 01:18:15,994
Matthew!

861
01:18:33,322 --> 01:18:35,313
Matthew?

862
01:18:42,998 --> 01:18:45,990
You're only making it harder
on yourself, Matt.

863
01:18:56,412 --> 01:18:58,744
Boo!

864
01:18:58,781 --> 01:19:01,477
Stupid fuck,
what the hell's wrong with you?

865
01:19:01,517 --> 01:19:03,178
Whoo!

866
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:11,849
Fucker's playing your song.

867
01:19:17,599 --> 01:19:19,567
Your ass is grass, Matthew.

868
01:19:19,601 --> 01:19:22,399
Matthew, you're a dead man.

869
01:19:22,438 --> 01:19:24,633
Whoo!

870
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:31,803
- Come on, man.
- I知 gonna kill him.

871
01:19:31,847 --> 01:19:34,179
Don't you pass out on me.

872
01:19:34,216 --> 01:19:37,185
I知 too tired to drag
your ass back.

873
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:48,285
What the hell?

874
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:50,491
Matthew?

875
01:19:53,535 --> 01:19:56,026
Matthew!

876
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:59,563
God damn it, Matthew,
where are you?

877
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:02,975
Where are you,
you little fucker?

878
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:12,181
Andy, he ain't out here.

879
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,751
You little bitch.

880
01:20:29,438 --> 01:20:33,374
Andy! Andy!

881
01:20:33,408 --> 01:20:36,206
Andy, help me!

882
01:20:38,981 --> 01:20:40,471
What the fuck, man?

883
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:42,040
- My leg!
- Ahem.

884
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:45,516
Andy!

885
01:21:30,299 --> 01:21:32,927
Stanley!

886
01:21:36,838 --> 01:21:40,569
Stanley, help me!

887
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:43,442

888
01:21:43,478 --> 01:21:46,276
Help me!
Please!

889
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:52,081

890
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,611

891
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:59,518
Come on, Stanley.

892
01:22:02,864 --> 01:22:05,765
Matthew, this shit
ain't funny, boy.

893
01:22:07,736 --> 01:22:09,897
Somebody help me!

894
01:22:09,938 --> 01:22:12,304
Smile real pretty

Can't talk, can you?

907
01:23:04,059 --> 01:23:07,392
Maybe it's because
you're hungry.

908
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:16,228
You know, you gotta eat a lot
of nasty shit out here to stay alive.

909
01:23:21,143 --> 01:23:24,601
Are you hungry?
You hungry?

910
01:23:26,748 --> 01:23:30,047
What's wrong?
You don't like it?

911
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:47,260
What are you doing?

912
01:23:47,302 --> 01:23:49,634
Some fishing.

913
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,774

Please is what I said to you.

920

You said...

921
01:25:37,245 --> 01:25:39,008
"Suck it, bitch."

922
01:25:43,685 --> 01:25:45,482
Does that ring any bells?

923
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,647
Suck...

930
01:26:17,018 --> 01:26:19,418

It gets better.

936
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:37,294
Please, my eyes.

937
01:26:37,339 --> 01:26:40,331
I can't take it anymore.

938
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:42,935
Oh, let me help you.

944
01:27:17,612 --> 01:27:19,580
That might feel better.

945

946
01:27:32,227 --> 01:27:34,991

Fuck you.

948
01:27:47,909 --> 01:27:50,571
Now is that any way
to talk to a lady?

949
01:28:07,362 --> 01:28:08,624
I知 impressed.

950
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:10,824
You got a lot of fight in you.

951
01:28:10,865 --> 01:28:12,958
Let's see how you do now.

952
01:28:14,769 --> 01:28:17,567
What's that?

953
01:28:17,606 --> 01:28:20,131
It痴 just some lye
I found laying around.

954
01:28:24,212 --> 01:28:26,476
No!

955
01:28:29,284 --> 01:28:31,081
Let's see how long you can keep

956
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:33,519

957
01:28:33,555 --> 01:28:35,614
Fuck you!

958
01:28:37,525 --> 01:28:39,618
You already did that.

959
01:28:39,661 --> 01:28:41,959
I didn't enjoy it much.

960
01:28:41,997 --> 01:28:45,626
Now it's my turn
to fuck you.

961
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:50,065
- Please. Please.
- Oh.

962
01:28:50,105 --> 01:28:51,970

01:30:26,034 --> 01:30:28,161
Pain in the ass.

964

Good morning.

965
01:30:39,013 --> 01:30:41,277

01:30:41,316 --> 01:30:43,944
Hey there.

01:31:18,386 --> 01:31:20,718
It痴 date night.

968
01:31:33,535 --> 01:31:35,526
Your mouth doesn't look
so good.

969
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:39,672
Maybe you should show me
your teeth.

970
01:31:53,955 --> 01:31:56,116
I値l kill you.

971
01:31:56,157 --> 01:31:57,488

972
01:32:03,064 --> 01:32:05,089
Ornery stallion.

973
01:32:07,068 --> 01:32:09,298
Guess I知 gonna
have to tame you.

974
01:32:24,452 --> 01:32:28,286
See, that's the problem.
You still have some teeth left.

975
01:32:28,323 --> 01:32:31,315
I知 gonna have to
take care of that.

976
01:32:39,667 --> 01:32:41,760
Huh? Huh?

977
01:32:41,803 --> 01:32:44,738
No fucking teeth, show horse.
No fucking teeth!

978
01:32:50,378 --> 01:32:52,573
Better save your strength
'cause you got a few more races

979
01:32:52,614 --> 01:32:54,479
left to run, show horse.

980
01:33:17,338 --> 01:33:20,000
That is disgusting.

981
01:33:21,976 --> 01:33:24,501
Even your boys
didn't piss themselves.

982
01:33:30,985 --> 01:33:33,954
Look who's here.

983
01:33:33,988 --> 01:33:37,389
It痴 my boyfriend.

984
01:33:37,425 --> 01:33:39,620
Remember him?

985
01:33:41,596 --> 01:33:43,655
Why don't you give him
a little kiss?

986
01:33:45,366 --> 01:33:47,891
Hmm? Hmm?

987
01:33:47,936 --> 01:33:49,995
Let's go, come on.

988
01:33:50,038 --> 01:33:53,405
I don't take orders
from no fucking woman.

989
01:33:53,441 --> 01:33:55,170
No?

990
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,446
Breathe through your nose.

991
01:34:01,482 --> 01:34:03,814
Breathe through your nose.
Come on.

992
01:34:03,851 --> 01:34:06,081

a good blowjob.

999
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,320
No.

1000
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:50,925
You know what they do to horses

1001
01:34:50,965 --> 01:34:52,899

1002
01:34:57,305 --> 01:34:59,205
You geld them.

01:35:04,612 --> 01:35:06,477

1004
01:35:06,514 --> 01:35:08,573
No teeth.

1005
01:35:16,524 --> 01:35:18,685

1006

01:36:17,085 --> 01:36:20,680
No, from the honors program.

1009
01:36:20,721 --> 01:36:24,020
- Do you remember anything?
- Oh yeah, that's right.

01:36:28,096 --> 01:36:30,860
Hello, angel.

1012
01:36:30,898 --> 01:36:32,991
Daddy's real busy working.

1013
01:36:33,034 --> 01:36:34,797
But I really want you
to meet my new teacher.

1014
01:36:36,504 --> 01:36:38,028
She's way cool.

1015
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:42,271
Here. Just say hi.

1016
01:36:45,012 --> 01:36:46,809
Howdy, Sheriff.

1019
01:36:51,018 --> 01:36:53,350
Hills, Jennifer Hills.

1020
01:36:57,625 --> 01:36:59,855
Excuse me?

1021
01:36:59,894 --> 01:37:02,863
I have to tell you it's been
a pleasure meeting your family.

1022
01:37:02,897 --> 01:37:05,263
You have a wonderful daughter

1023
01:37:05,299 --> 01:37:08,097
with a bright
and promising future.

1024
01:37:09,704 --> 01:37:12,332
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1025
01:37:12,373 --> 01:37:14,136
We'll see you soon, Sheriff.

1026
01:37:14,175 --> 01:37:15,699
No, wait!

1027
01:37:22,583 --> 01:37:24,312
Shit!

1028
01:37:46,874 --> 01:37:48,171
Chastity, where is she?

1029
01:37:48,209 --> 01:37:49,506
She went to Hanson Park
with Miss Hills.

1030
01:37:49,544 --> 01:37:52,513
She wanted to get to know her students
in the program before the year st-

1031
01:37:52,547 --> 01:37:54,412
God damn it!

1032
01:37:54,448 --> 01:37:55,745
Who is she?

1033
01:37:58,152 --> 01:37:59,881
Who is this woman?

1034
01:38:22,677 --> 01:38:24,668
Chastity!

1035
01:38:31,285 --> 01:38:33,412
Chastity!

1036
01:38:35,423 --> 01:38:37,653
Where are you, angel?

1037
01:38:45,466 --> 01:38:47,457
Chastity!

1038
01:39:29,243 --> 01:39:32,440
Oh no! No!

1039
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,038
Please!

1040
01:39:36,917 --> 01:39:39,385
No.

1041
01:39:45,493 --> 01:39:47,893
Help me, Jesus.

1042
01:39:47,928 --> 01:39:50,192
Does that hurt, Sheriff?

1043
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:55,692
Come on,
I thought you were an ass man.

1044
01:39:55,736 --> 01:39:58,728
Where is she, you bitch?

1045
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:05,710
I壇 be real careful
how you talk to me right now, Sheriff.

1046
01:40:05,746 --> 01:40:08,772
What have you done to her?

1047
01:40:11,952 --> 01:40:14,512
By her, I assume
you mean your daughter?

1048
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,558
She really is lovely, Sheriff.

1049
01:40:21,529 --> 01:40:24,396
So young.

1050
01:40:24,432 --> 01:40:26,093
So sweet.

1051
01:40:27,868 --> 01:40:30,336
So innocent.

1052
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:37,867
I mean, can you imagine?

1053
01:40:37,912 --> 01:40:39,880
Imagine what?

1054
01:40:45,086 --> 01:40:47,782
Imagine that somebody
had done something

1055
01:40:47,822 --> 01:40:50,882
like this to her.

1056
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:56,127
Someone like Andy.

1057
01:40:56,163 --> 01:40:59,394
Or Stanley or Johnny.

1058
01:40:59,433 --> 01:41:00,957
Or more likely you,

1059
01:41:01,001 --> 01:41:03,970
you sick, perverted rapist!

1060
01:41:07,541 --> 01:41:11,477
- Deep deep deep!
- Fuck!

1061
01:41:11,512 --> 01:41:14,140
Deep! Deep!

1062
01:41:14,181 --> 01:41:15,910
Deep! Deep! Deep!

1063
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:18,350
Jesus fucking Jesus.

1064

Please.

1065
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:34,999
Ma'am.
Ma'am.

1066
01:41:43,844 --> 01:41:46,369
She's just an innocent girl.

1067
01:41:55,656 --> 01:41:57,647
So was I.

1068
01:42:05,232 --> 01:42:07,860
What are you doing? What?

1069
01:42:12,106 --> 01:42:14,472
Matthew.

1070
01:42:25,219 --> 01:42:27,278
You won't get
a- fucking-way with this.

1071
01:42:30,024 --> 01:42:32,049
You won't get away with this!

1072
01:42:34,862 --> 01:42:38,059
He'll be waking up soon.

1073
01:42:38,098 --> 01:42:40,566
If I were you,
I壇 tell him not to move.

1074
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:43,263
Please, I知 begging you.

1075
01:42:44,705 --> 01:42:47,003
