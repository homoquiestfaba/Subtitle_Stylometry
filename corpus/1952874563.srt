All my people, please select a family to die.

A mass executions bring back much-needed space.

13
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:12,327
I Apologize for the inconvenience, but it is a necessity.

14
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,690
Each family was murdered.

<i> Except for one family.

Your honor, we are unable to decide.

17
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:23,139
We loved each other so that we all die together.

18
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:27,370
No! They can not die! They guard the bakery!

With the discount will be combined as one person less to stay here.

22
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,881

Do not be selfish! Like one of us dies?

27
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:55,000
- You can save my arm!
- After my right ear!

28
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,506
There is no problem about losing one of my fingers.

29
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,200
I walked with my nose!

30
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:03,246

What's this? What are you reading?

47
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,016
- Pre-calculus?
- Yes

48
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,620
We both feel safe in numbers.

49
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:20,681
In my family, 1 and 1 equal to 3.

50
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:25,024
- I hope when I grow up ...
- Life is beautiful.

51
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,567
My father was a track star in college ...

52
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:30,599
and I dreamed of the day I actually ...

53
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:33,499
will run faster than him.

54
00:03:34,774 --> 00:03:37,538
But the last good day my dad has ...

55
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:39,075
no one wins.

56
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,649
What?

57
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:54,149
That's when I started knocking on wood.

58
00:03:56,396 --> 00:04:00,298
hit each number, each number and give me security.

59
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:04,461
Without them I would be alone.

60
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,300
They knew the body repair ...

61
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,343
but to fix his head?

62
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,512
My father looked much ...

63
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,708
but I knew he was there, somewhere.

64
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,387
And I'm determined to bring him back ...

65
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:26,022
then make a deal with the universe.

66
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,591
I'll give it all you like ...

67
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:31,389
and the universe will come back to me my father.

68
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:35,231
I gave up dessert ...

69
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:40,168
I gave up going to the movies ...

70
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:43,836
I gave up my friends ...

71
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:47,703
I gave up flipping through the atlas ...

72
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:51,417
I give up runs.

73
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:57,851
The more I liked one thing, more is needed to destroy it.

74
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:06,632
The only thing I did not give figures.

75
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,770
If I can jump rope 43 times without a mistake ...

76
00:05:14,974 --> 00:05:19,308
or if I can catch the ball 27 times in a row ...

77
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:21,703
The number of fallen leaves that I have to say ...

78
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:24,212
is equal to the number of letters in the name of my father ...

79
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:26,408
then maybe I'll be back.

80
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,143
Never stop counting ...

81
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:30,049
I never stopped hoping.

82
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:31,587
Rate

83
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:34,492
insurance ...

84
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:37,290
Trusted ...

85
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:39,192
Perfect.

86
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,861
Then, suddenly, my mother decided that three is too many.

87
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:47,038
Is my drive?

88
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:52,878
You have no friends, no job.

89
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:57,080
It's time to go.

90
00:05:58,618 --> 00:06:00,108
But I like it here!

91
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,412
You lie, Mona.

92
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:05,147
And the worst part is that you do not realize it.

93
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:07,723
I should care.

94
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:10,152
You do not.

95
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:32,041
On the third night, my math book and I agree.

96
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:36,544
We can help you with the first month's rent.

97
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:41,819
I save a little, and his father have a disability pension.

98
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:49,367
He will never find an apartment with a private well as us.

99
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:01,811
FOR RENT

100
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:11,482
Suddenly I knew what it was like eternity.

101
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,623
Very long.

102
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:26,166
Mother!

103
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:27,805
Mona Gray?

104
00:07:28,207 --> 00:07:30,698
"There we go! I finally got to the point.
- Here is Miss. Gelband.

105
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,037
I am the head of his elementary school.

106
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,473
- Yes.

107
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,616
I just found her mother in front of the bakery.

108
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:41,616
Our math teacher, Miss Swordstrum ...

109
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:45,655
fled to Paraguay to be revolutionary.

110
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:48,258
Then his mother told me ...

111
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:50,486
You live in the city ...

112
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:54,063
who are unemployed but have a college degree ...

113
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,565
- Math. It's you! "Me?

114
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,168
Our new math teacher!

115
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:01,966
I remember playing when you were a child ...

116
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:04,608
while other children were playing dodgeball ...

117
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,711
You sit in the swing to make the division.

118
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:10,675
You work for the mayor, Mona Gray!

119
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:20,616
Why say I have a degree in Mathematics I left college?

120
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,124
Need to turn to pay the rent.

121
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:26,389
Why? It was you who threw me out.

122
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,466
- You may want to teach.
- I hate it.

123
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:35,739
The Committee welcomed to come to accept it!

124
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:40,774
I like to think of ourselves as being above average.

125
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,972
A teacher for every subject.

126
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:48,142
I think that makes you our Pass the Math!

127
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:56,150
We will want to brighten the decor.

128
00:08:56,362 --> 00:09:00,230
Something optimistic and fun.

129
00:09:05,438 --> 00:09:09,534
You make a mistake. I am not a teacher. I do not ...

130
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:14,008
There is an old saying: "There is no teacher to become a teacher."

131
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:23,982
I studied mathematics in space with Mr. Jones.

132
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:28,951
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...

133
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:32,659
7-8

134
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:36,796
13 ... 21 ...

135
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,906
Who can tell me what is the next number in this sequence?

136
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,944
- Ms. Gray? 34%

137
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:50,749
- Yeah right.

138
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:58,614
I've never seen him without wax number around his neck.

139
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:07,394
Number varies according to mood.

140
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:10,229
High when he was in a good mood ...

141
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:12,563
lower when he feels depressed.

142
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:22,004
I wondered whether he had a father figure that I needed.

143
00:10:23,449 --> 00:10:26,043
To the world, only the number ...

144
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,610
but for us ...

145
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:30,880
signs are visible.

146
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,036
Mr. Jones quit teaching and opened a hardware store.

147
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:48,507
And I was the only one who understands why.

148
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,836
He tried to increase their numbers.

149
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:01,885
We did not talk more ...

150
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:06,051
And then I can count on you?

151
00:11:37,456 --> 00:11:38,480
Hi!

152
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:40,689
First class?

153
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:44,085
I Miss Gray.

154
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,923
- Really.

155
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,992
Can I call you "mom"?

156
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:56,002
Series Second, look at the numbers on the board.

157
00:11:58,144 --> 00:11:59,941
Child

158
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:10,082
Take a look!

159
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:12,314
Figures are cool.

160
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:14,584
I liked the second.

161
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:18,226
I love the ninth.

162
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,396
I like 5.

163
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:23,534
- You are the third series? yes

164
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,535
What's your name?
- Elmer Gravlaki.

165
00:12:27,006 --> 00:12:29,031
Okay. Thank you.

166
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:31,368
Please sit down

167
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,614
Let's go!

168
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:47,690
make jokes.

169
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:52,128
How to say ...

170
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:56,097
Your name and favorite number?

171
00:12:57,636 --> 00:12:59,331
He hit me!

172
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,571
-What is your name?
- Danny O'Mazzi.

173
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,268
Danny can not throw things in the minds of others.

174
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:10,004
Go to the corner and stood facing the wall.

175
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:12,377
"Cool." It's not fair!

176
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:14,712
Why he'll stay in the corner facing the wall?

177
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,684
Not a good thing. This is a punishment.

178
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,414
I Williams Rita ...

179
00:13:20,626 --> 00:13:22,992
and I want you to know that Ellen always pee ...

180
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:24,423
when it becomes nervous.

181
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,121
He has a change of clothes in a room nurse.

182
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:31,159
So go get changed, Ellen.

183
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,397
Mlle. Gray?

184
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:36,632
I'm Lisa Venus, and my favorite number is 1 billion.

185
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:39,408
What?
- What to say our name ...

186
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:43,139
- And our favorite numbers.
- Yeah, if the league!

187
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:46,109
And you are ...
- Ann DiGanno.

188
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:54,455
Lisa, why not choose a number between ...

189
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,926
- And 9?
- Nine ... I mean, 2. No, seven!

190
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:00,462
Seven?

191
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,660
Seven, of course.

192
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:06,929
Okay. I have several other volunteers?

193
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:08,766
Also! Also!

194
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,202
Also! Call me!

195
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,504
My name is Levan Beeze, and my favorite number is 1.

196
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:20,183
Okay, Levan, Lisa and you come here for the next ...

197
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:22,980
and shape of their body.

198
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:32,729
What is the total Lisa Levan more?

199
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:34,263
- Eight!
-That 's right.

200
00:14:34,867 --> 00:14:36,994
Lice from her hair to give the answer.

201
00:14:37,202 --> 00:14:39,329
I do not have lice in her hair!

202
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:42,507
Ann is in a bad mood because her parents would divorce.

203
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,576
- My mother was a lawyer of his mother.
- They will not be divorced!

204
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:48,269
Is a separate courts.

205
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,473
Levan, the confidentiality of attorney-client confidential.

206
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,513
Very nice. Who wants to be 8?

207
00:14:56,822 --> 00:14:58,551
I?
- Okay, Danny.

208
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:03,855
Who wants to be o. .. plus?

209
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:06,258
- Also! Also!
"Call me.

210
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:16,207
This is the first equation of human!

211
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,474
What do we do now?

212
00:15:26,618 --> 00:15:29,178
What about us ...

213
00:15:29,655 --> 00:15:31,555
- You think?

214
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,997
What if ...

215
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:42,724
Our numbers ...

216
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:44,027
with nature?

217
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,966
One of you will bring ...

218
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:48,799
number ...

219
00:15:49,441 --> 00:15:50,874
every Friday!

220
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:53,941
As a show of numbers.

221
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,745
And let's call ...

222
00:15:57,349 --> 00:16:00,546
"Figures and Materials."

223
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:02,584
- Can I be first? Is that OK? "

224
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:04,789
Lisa ... Venus ...

225
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:07,154
bring very good.

226
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:14,257
I'm glad you became a new math teacher.

227
00:16:22,808 --> 00:16:24,298
-Dad?

228
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,841
-Dad?

229
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:27,906
-Dad?

230
00:16:28,814 --> 00:16:31,146
Father, today is my first ...

231
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:38,883
Mona ... Mona ... read the book ...

232
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,582
a physician and professor at Harvard.

233
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:45,958
It is called "Shape of Health."

234
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:51,835
Come here. I'll show you. Come here.

235
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:56,068
According to the book ...

236
00:16:56,275 --> 00:17:00,803
injured Olympic athletes use them. They have done studies.

237
00:17:01,013 --> 00:17:06,576
The problem is out of the opening round!

238
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,646
Mona is a book that can be relied upon.

239
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,782
Want to join?

240
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:20,158
Come on. Can you feel, right?

241
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,935
You sit here ... sitting here ...

242
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:25,865
"Take a deep breath."

243
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:30,671
and let it all go through the hole.

244
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:32,974
"Take a deep breath."

245
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:37,643
And let it all hang out. Leave out, let it out ...

246
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:41,719
Resume. Inspire ...

247
00:17:43,155 --> 00:17:44,588
and exhale.

248
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:47,849
"What happened?

249
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:53,656
It is called "Shape of Health."

250
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:57,469
I'll call Dr. Wallace.

251
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:00,433
This solution also does not work.

252
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,630
And you're not helping!

253
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:06,971
I have a doctor at Harvard Medical School!

254
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:32,963
Experience with caramel extrapolation.

255
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,267
Making a mess, but ... love of children.

256
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:41,779
Never fill it.

257
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:52,220
This sorbet is yours?

258
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:54,390
ora.

259
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:58,222
This is a funny name, huh? "Sorbet".

260
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:03,999
If you say several times is ... "Sorbet" ...

261
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,768
Sorbet ...

262
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,366
Sorbet?

263
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:14,535
Not so funny, but it is a weird name ... "Sorbet."

264
00:19:17,549 --> 00:19:22,111
So is the new math teacher? Mlle. Gray?

265
00:19:24,156 --> 00:19:25,589
I'm Ben.

266
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:29,517
Ben Smith. I teach science.

267
00:19:29,995 --> 00:19:33,795
This idea is one of the greenhouse?

268
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:38,060
Greenhouse! Half the room talking softly with their glass houses ...

269
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,396
the other half, no ...

270
00:19:39,605 --> 00:19:41,732
and we will compare ...

271
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,602
their growth rates. Why? What happened?

272
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,110
Rita's mother found him crying in the bathroom ferns ...

273
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:53,182
saying things like "You're a disgrace to his family" ...

274
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:57,754
and "What you see, you bastard ... you nuts?"

275
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,220
What is the reaction of plants?

276
00:20:00,425 --> 00:20:02,586
Do not be cute!

277
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:06,930
Let's discuss this in my office, Mr. Smith?

278
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:10,601
We have to discuss it in your living room.

279
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:13,937
Even more, Ms.. Gray.

280
00:20:17,943 --> 00:20:21,310
Mlle. Gray, 7 clouds fall.

281
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:23,046
Mlle. Gray!

282
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,677
- Hey! Be careful, sucker! Sorry.

283
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:36,193
- Does she wear?
- Looks like garbage.

284
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:41,964
- Lisa Venus ...
- Yes.

285
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:45,865
... What's in your head?
- An IV

286
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:49,436
- Understand? What is my initials.
No, no.

287
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,438
There are his initials.

288
00:20:51,777 --> 00:20:53,244
Almost was.

289
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:55,106
- You are retarded.
- Ann!

290
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:59,177
I am ready Numbers and Materials.

291
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,476
Rate
Me too.

292
00:21:00,686 --> 00:21:02,415
Materials and ...?
Remember!

293
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:05,552
Every Friday we bring the number of Nature.

294
00:21:06,124 --> 00:21:08,354
Or things that look like numbers.

295
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,028
Mlle. Gray, never remember anything!

296
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:12,958
How could a teacher?

297
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:14,757
Danny, now for the angle!

298
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:17,397
Good for you,,
- Lisa ...

299
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:19,502
Numbers and Materials!

300
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:21,529
Please.

<font color=magenta> <i> Subtitle By: GingErwan

301
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:28,702
This is my zero. This is the Nature.

302
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:31,940
This is not Nature. It's plastic!

303
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,845
Plastic is derived from nature.

304
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:37,283
It is created by humans, and humans derived from Nature.

305
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:41,557
Zero times anything is zero.

306
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,595
127 minus zero equal to 127.

307
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:49,690
10 billion less than zero ...

308
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:51,835
equal to 10 billion.

309
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:54,369
What?
Certainly.

310
00:21:54,806 --> 00:21:55,795
Good.

311
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:58,032
- What has this big?
- Ann!

312
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,200
Mr. Wilson: Hi ya Id consider selling directly to you! this skirt on the way & have been posted so you should contact you soon! I'll look for the slip transmission to see if I could see when it will be sent & returned to you. Best greetings LOLITA J

313
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,278
Who wants to come next week?

314
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:06,178
Also! Also!

315
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:14,991
Fireflies are not flies or bees. Do beetles.

316
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:18,026
And is on every continent except Antarctica.

317
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:19,855
And why do they glow?

318
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:22,659
Good question. Especially to find a partner.

319
00:22:22,868 --> 00:22:26,770
The man gave the signal and waited.

320
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:31,101
Expect that women ...

321
00:22:35,113 --> 00:22:36,603
respond.

322
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:48,522
- Lisa?
- Ms. Gray!

323
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,588
You wait for someone?

324
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:53,958
My aunt. He's always late.

325
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,498
Want to touch me I. V?

326
00:22:59,004 --> 00:22:59,993
Just do it.


327
00:23:00,372 --> 00:23:01,669
Press.

328
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:17,187
Where'd you get that?
- With my mother.

329
00:23:17,956 --> 00:23:21,653
He has a very serious cancer and wearing a red wig.

330
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:25,493
Guess what her cancer.

331
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:33,567
- Of the lungs?
- No.

332
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,740
- Colon?
- No.

333
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:39,276
- Boca?
- No.

334
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:41,105
- Throat?
- No.

335
00:23:41,313 --> 00:23:42,746
- Breast

336
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:44,107

338
00:23:46,117 --> 00:23:47,175
Blood ...

00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,352

340
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:49,520
BONE

SKIN

342
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:53,816
What else is there?

343
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,019
Eye cancer.

344
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:01,791
- Never heard it.
- It's pretty new.

345
00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:08,203
My mother is one of the first. Will die in less than a year.

346
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:14,878
Is there anything I can do?

347
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:19,608
I like pirates. Hate DiGanno Ann.

348
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,017
Are you sick?

349
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:29,159
"What do you mean?"

350
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:31,053
Lisa!

351
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,594
Hurry!

352
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:34,890
If you want to do something for me ...

353
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,796
so do not be sick. Not ever.

354
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:39,162
Lisa!

355
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:07,895
He does not need a cardiologist, Eva, you need a psychiatrist.

356
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:10,064
"What's the problem?"

357
00:25:11,336 --> 00:25:15,602
- Mom, what is it?
- No, everything is fine. Come on.

358
00:25:16,174 --> 00:25:17,539
Come on.

359
00:25:17,742 --> 00:25:20,233
No matter how many times I asked ...

360
00:25:20,445 --> 00:25:22,675
the answer is always the same ...

361
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:26,441
- None.

362
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:30,354
Lisa wearing a crown as the truth.

363
00:25:30,855 --> 00:25:34,086
She makes jewelry with plastic.

364
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:39,326
And I only have the word "nothing."

365
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:00,776
-Dad?

366
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:06,216
Happy Birthday, Mona Gray!

367
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,617
Happy birthday.

368
00:26:08,827 --> 00:26:10,055
Just live. "

369
00:26:11,463 --> 00:26:14,921
Let's go for coffee for a change. As a family.

370
00:26:15,266 --> 00:26:16,824
''We are a family.''

371
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:21,371
Like other families.

372
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:38,618
Hi Table for three, please. Thank you.

373
00:26:39,758 --> 00:26:43,353
I can not sit here. This is ... air flow.

374
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:49,865
No, that's gross. Gross.

375
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,865
Come to the fund.

376
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:57,838
No, no ... not! Whether under the AC.

377
00:26:58,877 --> 00:27:01,869
- Here's good?
It's nice!

378
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,674
Thank you. It's great.

379
00:27:04,883 --> 00:27:06,373
It's nice!

380
00:27:11,456 --> 00:27:12,889
Now ...

381
00:27:13,658 --> 00:27:15,455
let's have some fun.

382
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,389
This is Mona's birthday!

383
00:27:19,097 --> 00:27:23,056
Go to the hardware store and buy 2.5 kg of fertilizer.

384
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:27,170
No, not now. We celebrate.

385
00:27:29,174 --> 00:27:32,405
I have a surprise. Who came on his birthday.

386
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:38,706
Therapy with a magnet.

387
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:42,576
- Magnet?
- Keep your voice down.

388
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,187
I do not want to go back to the FDA.

389
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,255
- Why?
- Why? Because ...

390
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,594
- Since they confiscate! "Thank you.

391
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:54,287
May reclassify Health Form to get rid of it.

392
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:57,229
Mona, do not disturb your father.

393
00:27:59,204 --> 00:28:00,330
Mlle. Gray?

394
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,867
Hi.

395
00:28:04,576 --> 00:28:07,739
Are you a parent? Hi I am ...

396
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:10,310
Ben Smith. His daughter and I worked together.

397
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:12,312
- I am a science teacher. "Hi,

398
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:15,509
- I am the mother of Mona. Very pleased.
- Mr. Gray, I imagine.

399
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:20,016
Sit with us, please.

400
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,123
Agree?

401
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:26,186
Forgive me now.

402
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:32,498
The Moby Lane here is fantastic, and toast ...

403
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:35,764
You ... FDA?

404
00:28:35,974 --> 00:28:37,134
ora.

405
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:38,309
"Well?"

406
00:28:38,877 --> 00:28:42,244
- You are here?
- The short version:

407
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:45,416
I moved here when my fiance ...

408
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:48,245
got a job as a librarian at the hospital.

409
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:54,591
Then he ran off with a nurse. That's funny. They stole my car.

410
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,327
Sorry.

411
00:28:58,096 --> 00:29:00,758
This is a tragedy. Sorry.

412
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:03,564
That's all right. I made a mistake.

413
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:08,030
All my calculations are wrong.

414
00:29:10,642 --> 00:29:14,908
They must be tired of hearing this, but you ...

415
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:17,013
very similar.

416
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,980
Really? Everyone says that ...

417
00:29:21,486 --> 00:29:25,252
- Mouth ... No doubt.

418
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:28,914
How you ever been to Science?

419
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:31,493
I have always had an interest in ...

420
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:35,427
know why things are like them.

421
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:38,567
My father also influenced me, but ...

422
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,170
"I want to be a scientist!"

423
00:29:50,215 --> 00:29:53,207
I think I'll buy what you ask.

424
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:54,680
Mona, do not!

425
00:29:54,886 --> 00:29:56,183
"We do not ..."

426
00:29:56,387 --> 00:29:57,786
- Can I help you, Miss Gray. Just wait.

427
00:29:57,989 --> 00:30:00,219
- A 2.5 kg bag.
- But this ...

428
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,394
- Should I go with you?
- Mona, please sit down.

429
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,790
It's your birthday! It was his birthday.

430
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:07,123
Congratulations!

431
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:12,826
Mr. Jones.

432
00:30:15,707 --> 00:30:19,700
I came to show the new catalog Panida tool.

433
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:26,644
I have everything I need.

434
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:31,581
This is my card. Go find me.

435
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,723
I hope your day fun!

436
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:11,894
He says one thing about that number for the first time ...

437
00:31:12,096 --> 00:31:13,996
when she was 9 years old.

438
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:19,835
Hi, Mr. Jones! Glad you better. Nine times better than yesterday.

439
00:31:20,905 --> 00:31:22,304
Yesterday you 2.

440
00:31:26,344 --> 00:31:28,972
It is remarkable that a child's record.

441
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,709
You're a great observer.

442
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:33,444
Notification?

443
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:35,877
I woke up and thought ...

444
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:40,046
"If Mr. Jones to use even numbers, my dad would laugh today."

445
00:31:46,464 --> 00:31:50,696
"If he uses an odd number, the new drug will work."

446
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:57,332
"He must know the number that helps."

447
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,200
But if he knew, he said.

448
00:32:00,411 --> 00:32:03,380
It was just a neighbor who was looking the other way.

449
00:32:06,617 --> 00:32:10,348
So I decided to throw 60 eggs at his car on Halloween.

450
00:32:19,097 --> 00:32:20,758
Hi, Mr. Jones.

451
00:32:22,967 --> 00:32:25,663
- Hi, Mona. "Well?"

452
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:29,868
why do you use this number in the neck?

453
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,402
I think you know.

454
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:38,447
Know.

455
00:32:41,185 --> 00:32:43,176
Know what?

456
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:46,517
I also wear an invisible sign.

457
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:49,623
I say ... "Fuck you, hypocrite!"

458
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,595
I'll take the ax.

459
00:33:09,547 --> 00:33:11,105
Is $ 28.

460
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:44,806
See what we can achieve when we unite?

461
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:48,245
See what we can ...

462
00:33:48,753 --> 00:33:51,950
You are the 3? You are the 4?

463
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:55,091
You are the 5? You're 6?

464
00:33:55,293 --> 00:33:58,285
You are the 7? You're an 8?

465
00:33:58,496 --> 00:34:00,293
Are you a 9?

466
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:05,833
1, 2, 3 ... 6, 7, 8 ...

467
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:31,662
Why do it?

468
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:49,640
At home, the ax. At school he was 7.

469
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:58,385
A little wrapping paper and some stickers ...

470
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:02,081
and turned my nightmare into Numbers and Materials.

471
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,369
- Levan, what happened?
- It's scabies.

472
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:16,434
Scabies?

473
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:19,443
Who said that?

474
00:35:22,013 --> 00:35:24,072
Ann? What about you?

475
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:26,341
My tongue was swollen!

476
00:35:26,551 --> 00:35:28,519
My tongue!

477
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:32,682
My God! His tongue?

478
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:36,292
Danny, what's wrong with you?

479
00:35:36,494 --> 00:35:37,756
Malaria!

480
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:44,764
Emergency calls 911.
- I want to report the epidemic.

481
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:47,961
"Where are you?"
- Something like chicken pox.

482
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:51,164
- You know, you can ...
"Miss."

483
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,037
You can make a week of malaria ...

484
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:56,406
if you make a good tuberculosis today. How do you think?

485
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:59,481
- What are the symptoms?
- Tired, coughing. Coughing a little.

486
00:35:59,684 --> 00:36:01,117
"Miss."
- With strength.

487
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:02,752
I'll send an ambulance.

488
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:04,979
More power! Perfect.

489
00:36:05,189 --> 00:36:06,383
- And cramps.
"Miss."

490
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:08,957
- Curve as if gas. Is that OK? "

491
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,457
So: "There we go, I finally got to the point.

492
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:11,855
Rocks!

493
00:36:13,364 --> 00:36:16,856
Very nice, Elmer. It was as if he has too much gas.

494
00:36:18,336 --> 00:36:20,201
"What happened?

495
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:22,505
We are representing life.

496
00:36:22,707 --> 00:36:25,642
- Lady?
- Help children understand ...

497
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:27,470
symptoms of the disease.

498
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:35,010
You. .. is ...

499
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:38,450
fired!

500
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:43,188
I did not say two words ...

501
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:47,196
and then reject me?

502
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:06,273
Wake up, Lisa. You are not sick.

503
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,311
I suffer from cancer.

504
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:14,749
my mother's wig is made of human hair.

505
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:17,985
They have some that are not, but you can tell.

506
00:37:18,462 --> 00:37:20,726
Come on.

507
00:37:21,632 --> 00:37:25,466
Wait. Still more must be done a little cancer.

508
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:35,002
Mlle. Gray?

509
00:37:35,246 --> 00:37:37,271
What is it?

510
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:41,041
It's a ... 7.

511
00:37:41,252 --> 00:37:44,915
- It's not a 7! This ax!
- It's a 7.

512
00:37:45,122 --> 00:37:47,750
- Love Guru!
- Enough, Ann!

513
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:50,993
Ann was angry because his father had a girlfriend ...

514
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:53,254
and my mother, a lawyer his mother ...

515
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:54,556
have pictures to prove it.

516
00:37:54,765 --> 00:37:56,255
- It does not exist! Yes!

517
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:59,630
Levan, just gossip. Do you have to sit in the corner!

518
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:03,939
Very good

519
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:09,405
does anyone know what this is?

520
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,211
Bird beak.

521
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,145
- It's like the mouth ...
- It's ass bird!

522
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,416
Danny!

523
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,247
As for the singing!

524
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:22,048
Let's pretend it was a mouthful.

525
00:38:22,526 --> 00:38:25,359
And the mouth is always hungry.

526
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:28,459
And 179 ...

527
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:31,726
less than 255.

528
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:34,802
Mouth always wanted to eat the higher number.

529
00:38:41,912 --> 00:38:45,814
Mouth larger because come 5556.

530
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:47,875
Right.

531
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:51,380
This is called "greater than" and "less than".

532
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:55,956
Who wants to come here and make your own?

533
00:38:58,095 --> 00:39:01,064
I'm dying of diphtheria!

534
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:03,993
Get out of my room now!

535
00:39:07,538 --> 00:39:09,506
Not again, Ellen!

536
00:39:12,343 --> 00:39:15,335
"Faking sick is very difficult."

537
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:19,146
"The disease is less false than true disease."

538
00:39:23,721 --> 00:39:25,188
Car accident?

539
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:28,825
- Do not know if I can compare ...
- Yes, I can.

540
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,027
I had a car accident once. I survived.

541
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:37,456
War

542
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:42,269
Old age?

543
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:44,839
Old age is nothing more than war.

544
00:39:46,243 --> 00:39:47,972
Disease is the biggest of all!

545
00:39:50,214 --> 00:39:52,011
Murder

546
00:39:55,786 --> 00:39:57,447
Mine is the largest.

547
00:39:57,721 --> 00:39:59,313
No,

548
00:39:59,623 --> 00:40:02,456
They say psychopathic serial killer.

549
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,287
Sad, but true.

550
00:40:07,398 --> 00:40:08,422
Cancer?

551
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:11,300
Fight! Fight!

552
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:14,193
Stop, you two! Stop!

553
00:40:14,405 --> 00:40:16,236
Or I call your parents!

554
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:18,272
His mother would not know.

555
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:19,443
Silent ...
- Ann!

556
00:40:19,643 --> 00:40:22,339
Better you should control the classroom, Miss Gray.

557
00:40:23,814 --> 00:40:27,477
Remember to create a "greater than" and "less than"!

558
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:46,934
Lisa ...

559
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:53,473
no one is bigger than anyone else!

560
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:55,939
This is not true.

561
00:40:56,213 --> 00:40:59,046
You're the best teacher in the school.

562
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:10,657
You know, my father was sick.

563
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:13,489
Lisa, do not be late to class?

564
00:41:13,731 --> 00:41:15,858
I went, Miss Gelband.

565
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:24,233
Mlle. Gray ...

566
00:41:25,376 --> 00:41:29,278
Lisa seems happy in his class!

567
00:41:29,813 --> 00:41:35,410
Must create a great atmosphere!

568
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:42,781
Although I do not understand why, at lunch yesterday ...

569
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:46,224
he took a cigarette, bologna ...

570
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,366
margarine and a packet of sweetener!

571
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:52,195
Have you heard that?

572
00:41:53,837 --> 00:41:56,670
Looks like a theme lunch.

573
00:41:57,241 --> 00:41:59,505
A lunch with the theme of "cancer."

574
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:04,205
- Yeah right.

575
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,848
Thank God.

576
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,951
he has someone as well-balanced ...

577
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:11,485
like you in her life.

578
00:42:13,123 --> 00:42:14,852
Thank God.

579
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:18,727
Well .. see you tonight!

580
00:42:18,929 --> 00:42:22,023
- Tonight?
- Open School Night.

581
00:42:22,232 --> 00:42:23,631
Ace 20h sharp!

582
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:36,913
- Why not move?
- Why do not you move away?

583
00:42:37,114 --> 00:42:39,412
We're here. We must speak with all teachers in Ann.

584
00:42:39,617 --> 00:42:42,814
We'll leave the math to the end. Ann says that she is a bit strange.

585
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:49,723
Hi!

586
00:42:50,394 --> 00:42:52,658
You must be a math teacher.

587
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:55,298
I am the aunt Lisa.

588
00:42:56,233 --> 00:42:58,827
Lisa is one of my students are smart.

589
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:03,973
I always hated math, but Lisa is a strange child.

590
00:43:05,142 --> 00:43:08,976
Well, should not be easy for him ...

591
00:43:09,413 --> 00:43:10,710
Now?

592
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:13,849
And for me?

593
00:43:15,586 --> 00:43:19,022
I crossed the state to care for her e. ..

594
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,082
and did not get a "thank you" from anyone.

595
00:43:24,128 --> 00:43:27,689
He had to get my license to work as a broker.

596
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:31,026
Maybe go back to school. Now I can not do anything about it.

597
00:43:33,437 --> 00:43:36,201
- Maybe when her mother is better ...
- Increase?

598
00:43:37,341 --> 00:43:39,969
What spacecraft are you falling?

599
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,911
Forgive me now.

600
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:13,107
I sing seductive lure you here?

601
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,277
No, I ...

602
00:44:14,478 --> 00:44:17,504
If anyone asks, this is a scientific demonstration.

603
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:21,116
Environment.

604
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:30,053
- I also avoid the elderly ...
Me too.

605
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:35,326
"Well?"

606
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:38,801
agree on something?

607
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,630
It is a smile?

608
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:42,567
- No.
- Yes

609
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:47,375
This is very pretty when she smiles.

610
00:44:50,414 --> 00:44:52,644
I must go.

611
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:54,909
No, do not go.

612
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,557
We are making progress. The last time he saw me, you fired me.

613
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:03,488
You fired me.

614
00:45:03,694 --> 00:45:06,925
Do not worry. If there are people who would be fired here, is you.

615
00:45:07,131 --> 00:45:10,726
May saw that Ellen made with pork yesterday.

616
00:45:11,268 --> 00:45:14,795
That's ... gave me nightmares!

617
00:45:18,709 --> 00:45:23,510
You put ... Lisa to represent the cancer!

618
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:26,607
"Yes, I know.

619
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:31,149
She knew that her mother had cancer?

620
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:34,586
Sei. That's why she chose.

621
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:39,821
- He will die! Of course.

622
00:45:41,064 --> 00:45:43,089
That's why she chose.

623
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,300
Wait. Want to try?

624
00:45:56,847 --> 00:45:58,405
Try it.

625
00:45:59,116 --> 00:46:04,076
- I do not bubble.
- Who is not? Bubbles are ...

626
00:46:04,788 --> 00:46:08,417
circle ... This math. 360 St. Think about this.

627
00:46:08,759 --> 00:46:10,556
Everyone loves bubbles.

628
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:17,765
When I first saw you is ...

629
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:22,128
teaching, and children in front.

630
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:23,806
They are ...

631
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,676
representing numbers.

632
00:46:31,815 --> 00:46:33,476
I like that.

633
00:46:53,503 --> 00:46:55,368
That's why I ...

634
00:46:56,473 --> 00:46:59,237
That's when I realized there was something special about you.

635
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:01,172
You know,

636
00:47:01,378 --> 00:47:03,972
I need ...

637
00:47:04,181 --> 00:47:06,012
must go.

638
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:10,147
- You did it!
- Good evening, Mr. Smith.

639
00:47:14,424 --> 00:47:16,221
Good night, Miss Gray.

640
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:29,666
Once ... a woman from Texas ...

641
00:47:30,207 --> 00:47:34,371
write all the numbers from 1 to 1 billion.

642
00:47:35,212 --> 00:47:37,442
He spent several years ...

643
00:47:38,682 --> 00:47:40,809
and lots of paper.

644
00:47:41,618 --> 00:47:43,609
He uses recycled paper?

645
00:47:45,088 --> 00:47:46,248
I do not know.

646
00:47:46,456 --> 00:47:51,758
If you're using, is a good story. If not used, it is bad history.

647
00:48:00,304 --> 00:48:03,967
Should I ask for your aunt to prepare lunch for you better.

648
00:48:04,207 --> 00:48:07,608
Can not live up to basic chips and chocolate.

649
00:48:07,811 --> 00:48:11,042
Yes, I can. That's what pirates eat.

650
00:48:11,248 --> 00:48:13,580
Why do pirates prefer?

651
00:48:13,784 --> 00:48:17,914
My father took me into a pirate ship when I was little.

652
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:23,189
Can I stay with you after my mother died?

653
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:32,127
- I have a small apartment.
- I'm not too good.

654
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,298
You can not.

655
00:48:34,504 --> 00:48:38,838
because it would be unfair to other students.

656
00:48:40,344 --> 00:48:44,781
I mean, I could help him with math lesson e. ..

657
00:48:44,982 --> 00:48:47,212
would not be fair.

658
00:48:47,951 --> 00:48:49,748
Makes sense.

659
00:49:08,872 --> 00:49:11,102
- They are very angry.
- You are a brilliant teacher.

660
00:49:57,487 --> 00:50:00,285
'Back Avoiding me, Miss Gray?

661
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:04,058
ora.

662
00:50:08,231 --> 00:50:11,098
I thought I had dropped something. Window.

663
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:13,769
Like what? A quadratic equation?

664
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:16,102
Type a decimal point.

665
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:19,332
I see a decimal point. He flew in that direction.

666
00:50:20,043 --> 00:50:23,342
- Decimal point can not fly.
- What are they doing?

667
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:26,581
They were leaning.

668
00:50:28,952 --> 00:50:31,443
You are a strange woman I have ever encountered.

669
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:34,416
"So what?"
Then ...

670
00:50:39,563 --> 00:50:40,757
Come on.

671
00:50:42,365 --> 00:50:44,356
I help you find ...

672
00:50:46,036 --> 00:50:48,027
decimal point is tilted.

673
00:50:48,638 --> 00:50:50,333
Going to the movies.

674
00:50:52,142 --> 00:50:54,076
I do not like the movie.

675
00:50:57,447 --> 00:50:59,711
Okay. He did not invite you.

676
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:02,544
Okay, you can go to the cinema with me if you want.

677
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:07,516
I do not ... go to the movies.

678
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:11,860
What folly! It's like saying you do not hear the music.

679
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:20,025
- I hate music.
- What is this lie? The third?

680
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,206
I have to go to the hardware store to buy nails.

681
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:27,569
Lying 4.

682
00:51:29,412 --> 00:51:31,073
I hate thrillers!

683
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:32,942
This is a 5!

684
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,950
- This is 5.
- The first is the music.

685
00:51:37,154 --> 00:51:39,987
Is 5. You lie a lot.

686
00:51:42,626 --> 00:51:46,653
Everything about you is funny. Come to the movies with me!

687
00:51:47,697 --> 00:51:49,722
You can pay for popcorn.

688
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,998
Or you hate popcorn, but not really?

689
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:57,138
I need a nail.

690
00:51:59,943 --> 00:52:02,104
I sat in the middle of the media.

691
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:29,595
42.

692
00:52:55,999 --> 00:52:57,660
Come on guys!

693
00:53:22,058 --> 00:53:23,320
Hi.

694
00:53:24,127 --> 00:53:27,221
- Where are you?
- I forgot to buy popcorn.

695
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,024
It is enough for two people. Here.

696
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:32,628
But I like butter.

697
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:34,427
They are soaked in butter.

698
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:36,469
Sit down, lady!

699
00:53:37,707 --> 00:53:39,072
-Sit!

<font color=yellow> <i> Subtitle By: GingErwan

700
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:49,514
That person is an expert in bank robbery.

701
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:52,347
He was caught red-handed.

702
00:53:52,555 --> 00:53:57,151
Then police found the murderer who left the victims in the vault ...

703
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,124
and fill the inside of them for money. So ...

704
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:04,198
now the police had ... help the bank robber.

705
00:54:05,135 --> 00:54:08,332
They are filled with money from that place?

706
00:54:12,342 --> 00:54:14,503
I can not answer.

707
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:23,475
But this is an interesting question.

708
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,848
It's my mother, Miss Gray.

709
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:30,651
Sorry.
- No need ...

710
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:33,556
- You'd better stop talking, ma'am.
- Why do not you sit somewhere else?

711
00:54:33,763 --> 00:54:35,822
- Go, you!
- Go, you!

712
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:47,202
Defended my honor?

713
00:54:47,877 --> 00:54:49,310
What?

714
00:55:22,479 --> 00:55:23,639
Mona!

715
00:55:35,158 --> 00:55:37,558
How do you know where I live?

716
00:55:39,996 --> 00:55:41,691
I followed you.

717
00:55:44,267 --> 00:55:46,167
But you're quick.

718
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,799
Very fast.

719
00:55:49,339 --> 00:55:51,000
I used to ...

720
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:53,098
- Run!

721
00:55:54,043 --> 00:55:57,274
Why are you running ... movie?

722
00:56:05,088 --> 00:56:07,420
I admit that artist.

723
00:56:12,796 --> 00:56:14,889
- Who did this? Paulo

724
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,327
This is a 7 ... a little lonely.

725
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:26,905
Who did the volcano?

726
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:30,877
Ellen.

727
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,945
I like that.

728
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,811
I like this,

729
00:56:39,088 --> 00:56:42,353
- Pot ...
- Bouquet of numbers.

730
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,522
And this ...

731
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:54,930
This is Lisa. "One of the six lashes."

732
00:57:00,443 --> 00:57:02,070
They're real!

733
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:05,313
I think so.

734
00:57:06,316 --> 00:57:08,284
I like you.

735
00:57:11,054 --> 00:57:13,113
I do not like anyone else ...

736
00:57:15,992 --> 00:57:18,483
so long ago.

737
00:57:21,297 --> 00:57:23,561
How long did you do?

738
00:57:26,202 --> 00:57:27,601
13 months

739
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:30,201
What month?

740
00:57:31,608 --> 00:57:33,235
December

741
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:35,602
until July.

742
00:57:37,013 --> 00:57:38,446
Why? "

743
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:41,883
Is 212 days.

744
00:57:43,186 --> 00:57:45,746
Unless that leap year.

745
00:57:57,967 --> 00:57:59,662
Did you know?

746
00:58:12,582 --> 00:58:14,413
Did you know?

747
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:51,017
I have to go to the bathroom.

748
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:05,596
I asked: "Are you okay?"

749
00:59:46,476 --> 00:59:48,103
What happened?

750
00:59:52,915 --> 00:59:54,246
I just -

751
00:59:55,051 --> 00:59:56,712
not in the mood.

752
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:04,448
- Your previous.
- Not.

753
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:10,128
- What are you doing in the bathroom?
- Go away, please.

754
01:00:23,479 --> 01:00:25,003
Wild.

755
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:37,053
classes

756
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,750
classes

757
01:00:39,629 --> 01:00:43,156
I Miss Gray and I'm weird.

758
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:46,802
Who wants to come here to represent a snot?

759
01:00:47,003 --> 01:00:49,267
Ms. Gray is not strange.

760
01:00:49,472 --> 01:00:52,635
Yes! And so do you!

761
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,205
- Ann ...
- You are late!

762
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:03,147
And it was my turn to do Numbers and Materials.

763
01:01:03,352 --> 01:01:05,047
Now it's your turn again?

764
01:01:05,254 --> 01:01:06,846
I'm not lying!

765
01:01:14,897 --> 01:01:16,694
See? A number of perfect.

766
01:01:16,899 --> 01:01:18,059
Awesome.

767
01:01:18,267 --> 01:01:20,462
Where'd you get that?
"I see it."

768
01:01:20,903 --> 01:01:23,565
42 plus 5 equal to 48.

769
01:01:23,773 --> 01:01:26,367
Nothing! It's 47!

770
01:01:28,111 --> 01:01:30,272
You do not!

771
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,414
I know who it is.

772
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:34,776
This is mine and I!

773
01:01:45,828 --> 01:01:47,125
You can go, Lisa.

774
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,595
Fine, but do not let it get away.

775
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:59,667
Why do not we go to the hardware store together ...

776
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:04,039
to give back the number on Mr. Jones?

777
01:02:04,247 --> 01:02:09,184
He will be very happy that might give you a gift.

778
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:13,951
A gift? Do not want to reward an idiot!

779
01:02:14,157 --> 01:02:16,250
And could not stop me going to the park to play.

780
01:02:16,459 --> 01:02:17,448
Give me.

781
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,752
- Yes

782
01:02:18,961 --> 01:02:20,758
This.

783
01:02:29,405 --> 01:02:30,804
Weird.

784
01:02:37,313 --> 01:02:38,280
I ....

785
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:43,750
I would shop with your hardware.

786
01:02:44,954 --> 01:02:47,980
Then you can take me to visit my mother.

787
01:02:51,527 --> 01:02:55,190
Hi Encouraged to experiment with sulfuric acid tomorrow?

788
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:56,763
Let's kick ass.

789
01:03:00,369 --> 01:03:01,734
Mr Smith!

790
01:03:02,138 --> 01:03:03,332
And also

791
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:07,034
Want to go to the hardware store with me and Miss Gray?

792
01:03:07,243 --> 01:03:09,905
I can not. I Science Club meeting after school.

793
01:03:10,112 --> 01:03:12,580
I need to look for ... I said I would.

794
01:03:12,782 --> 01:03:15,080
And I always do what I say and say what I do.

795
01:03:15,284 --> 01:03:19,778
I play clean. Not everyone plays. But thank you for the invitation.

796
01:03:19,989 --> 01:03:21,980
Will lose the fun!

797
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:28,787
Mr. Jones.

798
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,400
Mr. Jones.

799
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:41,069
Mr. Jones.

800
01:03:44,547 --> 01:03:47,573
If he is not here, why leave the door open?

801
01:03:47,783 --> 01:03:50,650
Maybe it was captured by pirates.

802
01:04:02,765 --> 01:04:04,096
This way.

803
01:04:08,471 --> 01:04:12,498
- "And he fell on the bench, he laughed ..."
- Mother! Nan!

804
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:23,816
This is my math teacher.

805
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,988
Miss ... Gray ...

806
01:04:26,656 --> 01:04:29,557
It is the unseen teacher?

807
01:04:30,927 --> 01:04:32,292
Mlle. Gray?

808
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,692
This ... is Miss Gray.

809
01:04:42,838 --> 01:04:44,567
Lisa, like potatoes?

810
01:04:44,774 --> 01:04:47,834
- I love.
- Then come with me!

811
01:04:57,853 --> 01:04:59,684
I like your hair.

812
01:05:06,028 --> 01:05:08,121
Cancer is not contagious.

813
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:23,276
Lisa asked me to bring him here today.

814
01:05:26,148 --> 01:05:28,708
He does not like my brother.

815
01:05:32,722 --> 01:05:34,815
But as you.

816
01:05:36,459 --> 01:05:38,222
I also like that.

817
01:05:46,869 --> 01:05:50,862
His father made a pirate just like him? He said ...

818
01:05:53,743 --> 01:05:58,043
No Lisa has never met his father.

819
01:06:00,516 --> 01:06:03,576
I think ...
- You can ...

820
01:06:04,286 --> 01:06:06,948
take care of Lisa and again?

821
01:06:15,131 --> 01:06:16,530
Of course.

822
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:51,963
Mr. Jones.

823
01:06:54,036 --> 01:06:55,503
Mother!

824
01:06:55,704 --> 01:06:58,264
Mother! Daddy! Did you see Mr. Jones?

825
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:00,305
Mother saw Mr Jones?

826
01:07:00,509 --> 01:07:04,502
He disappeared. And I do not think the car keys.

827
01:07:05,414 --> 01:07:07,177
Who is missing? Mr. Jones?

828
01:07:07,383 --> 01:07:11,183
No, Mona. His father. Her father disappeared.

829
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:14,118
What? Where did he go?

830
01:07:14,323 --> 01:07:17,156
I do not know. I do not know where he is!

831
01:07:21,197 --> 01:07:24,963
And I found it behind the washing machine.

832
01:07:25,935 --> 01:07:30,599
He's hiding. I do not know how long ago did not take.

833
01:07:33,609 --> 01:07:36,009
This will never happen if I still live here.

834
01:07:36,212 --> 01:07:39,807
Stop! You can not help you.

835
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,678
And I do not know where he is.

836
01:07:54,463 --> 01:07:56,021
-Dad?
- It's your father?

837
01:07:56,232 --> 01:07:58,166
I tried to take him down, but did not appear.

838
01:07:58,801 --> 01:07:59,961
-Dad?

839
01:08:00,803 --> 01:08:03,829
The energy trapped ...

840
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:07,634
in this round and should be released.

841
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:13,243
Let's go home. Subtitle by Mandala Putra Bima

842
01:08:13,449 --> 01:08:15,508
Should I call someone?

843
01:08:15,885 --> 01:08:17,750
No, it's okay.

844
01:08:17,953 --> 01:08:19,181
Mr. Wilson: Hi ya Id consider selling directly to you! this skirt on the way & have been posted so you should contact you soon! I'll look for the slip transmission to see if I could see when it will be sent & returned to you. Best greetings LOLITA J

845
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:25,550
Why did you stop taking the drug?

846
01:08:25,761 --> 01:08:29,697
Because it is toxic. And it will poison my body.

847
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,861
No, it will help you.

848
01:08:37,306 --> 01:08:38,796
Here is the end.

849
01:08:39,842 --> 01:08:41,776
I have to dig here.

850
01:08:46,182 --> 01:08:48,343
If I did not open it ...

851
01:08:52,655 --> 01:08:53,849
_____I ... Is.

852
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:56,747
Please.

853
01:09:01,163 --> 01:09:02,858
Go home.

854
01:09:05,834 --> 01:09:10,396
- Not that I want to improve?
- It's everything I want.

855
01:09:57,386 --> 01:10:02,153
I took my number and Materials. I knew it was not Friday, but special.

856
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:08,293
This is my father prosthesis.

857
01:10:09,064 --> 01:10:12,363
- It seems the number one, right?
- Can I play?

858
01:10:13,068 --> 01:10:14,399
Pretty cool, huh?

859
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:18,397
There seems to be the first. Apparently arm.

860
01:10:18,607 --> 01:10:20,507
Apparently the number one!

861
01:10:25,514 --> 01:10:27,243
Why is her father's arm fall?

862
01:10:27,449 --> 01:10:29,713
Did not fall. He was hit in the war.

863
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,088
Is reduction, Miss Gray?

864
01:10:33,289 --> 01:10:34,984
Ms. Gray? Ms. Gray?

865
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:36,157
- Ms. Gray! What?

866
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:38,918
Deductions do now? Hey, that's my dad!

867
01:10:39,128 --> 01:10:40,095
Elmer!

868
01:10:42,998 --> 01:10:44,090

Hey! Elmer!

872

01:10:52,975 --> 01:10:55,671
- Elmer, come back!
return;

874
01:10:56,545 --> 01:10:57,637
Mlle. Gray ...

875
01:10:57,846 --> 01:10:59,279
can not control the class.

876
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:00,914
Will be terminated.

877
01:11:01,116 --> 01:11:02,515
Silent ...

878
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:05,012
Nobody cares about you, Lisa.

879
01:11:06,021 --> 01:11:07,750
kemariin hands lo.
-No!

880
01:11:12,661 --> 01:11:14,526
Mlle. Gray, look!

881
01:11:18,734 --> 01:11:20,258
I'll share ...

882
01:11:20,502 --> 01:11:21,491
less ...

883
01:11:21,704 --> 01:11:24,070
- And you multiply.
- Lisa!

884
01:11:24,506 --> 01:11:26,133
As for the singing!

885
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:31,240
Ann, you have to learn to be good!

886
01:11:31,914 --> 01:11:33,472
Oh GOD.

887
01:11:40,889 --> 01:11:42,220
Agree?

888
01:11:43,025 --> 01:11:44,549
Sorry.

889
01:11:52,301 --> 01:11:54,030
Oh GOD.
- Lisa! Lisa!

890
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,396
Lisa!

891
01:11:56,605 --> 01:11:57,970
- Lisa!
Let me go!

892
01:11:58,173 --> 01:11:59,333
- Stop!
Let me go!

893
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:00,906
Stop!

894
01:12:02,878 --> 01:12:04,209
My mother died!

895
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,170
He died!

896
01:12:10,519 --> 01:12:13,647
Why can not I also have cancer?

897
01:12:17,793 --> 01:12:19,454
Sorry.
- I'm sick of seeing ...

898
01:12:19,661 --> 01:12:21,128
Lisa show off!

899
01:12:24,066 --> 01:12:27,035
- Ann!
- I will split it into several parts.

900
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:29,337
Ann ...

901
01:12:29,538 --> 01:12:31,665
- My God! ... Drop the ax.


902
01:12:31,874 --> 01:12:34,104
- I will cut them.
- Go, nothing.

903
01:12:34,309 --> 01:12:37,107
I will cut them to bits.

904
01:12:37,379 --> 01:12:39,244
It will not bite anyone.

905
01:12:39,448 --> 01:12:41,916
- I'm full of it! ____Please ...

906
01:12:42,117 --> 01:12:43,948
And I'm sick of you.

907
01:12:44,586 --> 01:12:46,076
Give me the ax!

908
01:12:53,562 --> 01:12:55,189
There are a few moments ...

909
01:12:55,397 --> 01:12:57,024
when you look around ...

910
01:12:57,232 --> 01:13:00,030
and expect the cost to help you.

911
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:05,301
Then you realize that you are responsible.

912
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:08,642
You're an adult.

913
01:13:10,646 --> 01:13:12,876
You're grown only there.

914
01:13:17,019 --> 01:13:18,384
And not very good.

915
01:13:22,057 --> 01:13:23,524
Life is too ...

916
01:13:24,193 --> 01:13:26,457
far more difficult than mathematics.

917
01:13:29,398 --> 01:13:30,660
-Dad?

918
01:13:49,418 --> 01:13:50,942
Mlle. Gray ...

919
01:14:42,887 --> 01:14:46,880
- It took nine points.
- I took 27.

920
01:14:47,091 --> 01:14:50,026
Nine times three equal to 27.

921
01:14:50,494 --> 01:14:51,859
"You're right!

922
01:15:03,975 --> 01:15:07,103
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?

923
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:12,743
I imitate you at lunch.

924
01:15:13,618 --> 01:15:16,348
Bank makes the same sound that your table.

925
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:21,553
Why did you do that?

926
01:15:23,661 --> 01:15:24,992
Why? "

927
01:15:27,531 --> 01:15:28,998
I do this ...

928
01:15:29,367 --> 01:15:32,131
when ... I feel ...

929
01:15:35,673 --> 01:15:37,197
alone.

930
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:42,679
So that's why I'm doing. I want to be like you.

931
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:48,983
Do not do that. Do not be like me.

932
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,686
But I own ...

933
01:15:56,794 --> 01:15:58,625
-Own.

934
01:16:24,255 --> 01:16:29,989
You do not just take an ax to school ...

935
01:16:30,194 --> 01:16:34,426
but also lied by saying he has a college degree.

936
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,497
Shame on you ...

937
01:16:41,205 --> 01:16:44,436
You are a great math teacher, Miss Gray ...

938
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:50,080
but forbidden to set foot in my school anymore.

939
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:16,672
Mr. Jones.

940
01:17:48,973 --> 01:17:49,940
Hello?

941
01:17:55,179 --> 01:17:56,874
What are you doing?

942
01:17:57,081 --> 01:17:59,606
What are you doing? Get out of here!

943
01:18:01,118 --> 01:18:03,450
- You do not die?
- Why do I die?

944
01:18:03,654 --> 01:18:05,212
"What happened? I do not know why.

945
01:18:05,422 --> 01:18:09,825
I think their numbers throughout the city. His shop is open.

946
01:18:10,027 --> 01:18:12,291
- Your car is missing.
- Get out of my room!

947
01:18:12,496 --> 01:18:14,589
- Who is the girl?
- Mona Gray!

948
01:18:14,799 --> 01:18:17,267
Mona Gray, would you please leave?

949
01:18:17,468 --> 01:18:19,265
- Do I have to call the police?
- No.

950
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:21,335
But keep your number!

951
01:18:22,606 --> 01:18:25,598
How do you know how you feel or who you are without them?

952
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:28,074
Andrea, I'm back.

953
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:29,902
Sorry.

954
01:18:33,884 --> 01:18:36,444
Why not have more than their numbers?

955
01:18:37,688 --> 01:18:38,950
What do you get?

956
01:18:39,156 --> 01:18:41,920
This is because I love math!

957
01:18:42,126 --> 01:18:45,527
You taught me that the number is everything! I saw their numbers and not ...


958
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:49,790
bar graph to compare them with their moods.

959
01:18:51,802 --> 01:18:53,497
He made the table?

960
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:00,834
Want to sit?

961
01:19:03,547 --> 01:19:06,482
I left the store opened, I sold the car ...

962
01:19:06,684 --> 01:19:08,549
all because of 42.

963
01:19:10,988 --> 01:19:14,890
Who cares about anything when you use 42?

964
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,125
I saw you that day.

965
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:21,423
A beautiful day. The best I ever had.

966
01:19:22,032 --> 01:19:24,296
What about 42?

967
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:29,872
I realized that if I do not need ...

968
01:19:30,074 --> 01:19:31,666
number ...

969
01:19:33,177 --> 01:19:35,577
I could be anything.

970
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:42,350
I do not understand why you are interested.

971
01:19:43,254 --> 01:19:45,654
You're the meanest girl I ever knew.

972
01:19:45,856 --> 01:19:48,450
Threw eggs at my car every Halloween.

973
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,558
- I know it's me? Of course.

974
01:19:53,397 --> 01:19:56,423
What I do not know is ...

975
01:19:56,634 --> 01:19:59,228
why you do it.

976
01:20:02,106 --> 01:20:05,234
Because you ignored me.

977
01:20:05,442 --> 01:20:07,501
And do not know my father.

978
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,247
What?

979
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,819
You never ask about it!

980
01:20:16,854 --> 01:20:20,119
- I said yes.
- He asked, nothing.

981
01:20:20,758 --> 01:20:22,555
One day you ...

982
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,990
playing in the park ...

983
01:20:26,063 --> 01:20:27,223
and I ask:

984
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:31,558
"What happened to your father?" He seems to wilt. "

985
01:20:34,805 --> 01:20:37,501
I asked! Of course I asked!

986
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:42,008
You're right there with their green wellies ...

987
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,305
threw stones at the tree.

988
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:47,312
I asked about his father, and you say to me:

989
01:20:47,518 --> 01:20:49,042
"Shut up, Mr. Jones."

990
01:21:25,055 --> 01:21:27,421
I should have asked again.

991
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,993
Sorry.

992
01:21:33,464 --> 01:21:37,730
Maybe that day you ... not good.

993
01:21:43,974 --> 01:21:46,704
I think I have never been better.

994
01:21:51,849 --> 01:21:54,443
What is the problem with your father?

995
01:21:58,255 --> 01:22:00,985
She thought she was dying.

996
01:22:02,426 --> 01:22:04,758
Do you think he will die?

997
01:22:25,449 --> 01:22:26,939
Did you miss work?

998
01:22:34,958 --> 01:22:37,426
Want to know how I hurt my leg?

999
01:22:38,529 --> 01:22:40,463
You did not ask.

1000
01:22:40,898 --> 01:22:43,560
Sorry. I think about ...

1001
01:22:43,767 --> 01:22:47,464
create another form of health in the backyard.

1002
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:50,196
But this time, with a larger radius.

1003
01:22:50,407 --> 01:22:53,899
The latter is very small. I'm thinking about making a ...

1004
01:22:54,111 --> 01:22:56,102
with greater range.

1005
01:22:59,316 --> 01:23:00,977
What do you think?

1006
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:05,280
I guess I can not stay with you.

1007
01:23:06,323 --> 01:23:11,488
My beautiful daughter. It's okay if you want to wait in the car.

1008
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,642
He does not understand.

1009
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:37,914
But I finally understood.

1010
01:23:58,175 --> 01:24:00,302
I received this by mail.

1011
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:02,875
HI, MR. MISS SMITH. GRAY

1012
01:24:03,213 --> 01:24:04,680
I found through long-winded.

1013
01:24:07,784 --> 01:24:10,719
I do not know what to do.

1014
01:24:11,722 --> 01:24:16,523
Lisa insisted that I ... come and see it.

1015
01:24:19,129 --> 01:24:20,619
How is he?

1016
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:25,334
Quiet than that.

1017
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,404
Sorry.

1018
01:24:41,518 --> 01:24:43,247
You're right.

1019
01:24:43,887 --> 01:24:45,650
I lied.

1020
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:47,852
Just so you know ...

1021
01:24:48,058 --> 01:24:52,461
next time, whether there will be other times ...

1022
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:56,160
when I say I went to the bathroom ...

1023
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,261
do not leave.

1024
01:25:06,276 --> 01:25:09,643
I'm not going to monitor your bathroom, Miss Gray.

1025
01:26:20,517 --> 01:26:23,577
Mona! Forgot to say one thing.

1026
01:26:26,089 --> 01:26:27,488
I lied.

1027
01:26:29,293 --> 01:26:31,693
I will monitor your bathroom.

1028
01:26:34,364 --> 01:26:36,855
No need to monitor the bathroom.

1029
01:26:38,168 --> 01:26:39,635
Not?

1030
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:59,255
I lied, but it's for your kindness.

1031
01:26:59,523 --> 01:27:02,083
Agree?
- I just wanted ...

1032
01:27:02,225 --> 01:27:04,250
Thank you for coming back.

1033
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:09,258
Mlle. Gray? Alisha Beeze, mother of Levan.

1034
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:14,161
I am a lawyer and I think it is a major cause ...

1035
01:28:14,364 --> 01:28:17,800
toward family and school DiGanno Ann.

1036
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:20,697
You can request a large indemnity.

1037
01:28:21,905 --> 01:28:24,840
I only want one thing.

1038
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:27,703
And to say that in exchange for their jobs back ...

1039
01:28:27,911 --> 01:28:31,745
You give up this process, will graduate Pedagogy ...

1040
01:28:31,948 --> 01:28:36,351
and promise never to bring tools to the classroom.

1041
01:28:39,456 --> 01:28:40,821
Pen?

1042
01:28:44,928 --> 01:28:48,091
All this is very unfair.

1043
01:28:48,298 --> 01:28:51,028
I could not leave when he is around.

1044
01:28:51,735 --> 01:28:53,635
I'm not sensitive.

1045
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:56,699
I'm not going to do it.

1046
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,167
I'm not just ready.

1047
01:29:01,845 --> 01:29:04,245
I know it's horrible ...

1048
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,515
but I do not want it.

1049
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:15,824
I want

1050
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:26,628
The history of my father around.

1051
01:29:28,205 --> 01:29:32,539
Love does not mean having to sacrifice part of himself.

1052
01:29:38,281 --> 01:29:41,307
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

1053
01:29:41,518 --> 01:29:43,418
What do you see?

1054
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,484
- Any takers?
- Also! Also!

1055
01:29:51,695 --> 01:29:55,426
- Ms. Gray?
- Okay. I would choose ...

1056
01:29:55,632 --> 01:29:58,795
Isabelle ... David ...

1057
01:29:59,002 --> 01:30:00,094
and Kevin!

1058
01:30:05,308 --> 01:30:09,802
There were 122 frogs in the lake ...

1059
01:30:10,013 --> 01:30:12,914
and 57 in other countries.

1060
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:15,983
frog How many total?

1061
01:30:16,186 --> 01:30:19,053
Not the history of mathematics is good.

1062
01:30:21,324 --> 01:30:23,656
179.

1063
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:24,884
Good.

1064
01:30:25,095 --> 01:30:29,691
- Do you know better?
- I should think. I know!

1065
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:32,869
Put 3 in the story. And pirates.
