00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,741
Narrator: Logan Wood's journey
began even before he was born.

3
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:24,820
His father was a dedicated farmer

4
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:26,978
whose crops were in high demand.

5
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:30,629
His mother was in charge
of quality control,

6
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:34,628
and happily shared her
duties with the entire family.

7
00:00:36,988 --> 00:00:40,306
Narrator: Luckily for Logan,
he was born beautiful...

8
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:42,901
since he was also born stoned.

9
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:46,200
* I'm a fleabit peanut monkey *

10
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:48,839
* All my friends are junkies *

11
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:51,438
- * That's not really true *
- Psst.

12
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:52,957
Psst.

13
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,738
* I'm a cold Italian pizza *

14
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:58,660
* I could use a lemon squeezer *

15
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:00,083
Logan?

16
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,103
You have ink on your lip.

17
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:06,017
Narrator: Though never a scholar,

18
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:07,646
Logan was lucky to attract

19
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:09,381
special attention from a teacher,

20
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:11,717
which is how he managed
to graduate Palisades High

21
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:12,738
with a C-plus average.

22
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:13,772
[yelps]

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,742
I'm not cut out to be a teacher.

24
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:19,997
* A monkey woman too *

25
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:23,622
Narrator: That fall,

26
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:25,791
as Logan's friends headed to college,

27
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:29,146
his father encouraged him to
go into the family business.

28
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:31,304

00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:33,595
[police siren wails]

30
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:38,225
* I always have an unmade bed *

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,991
* Don't you? *

32
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:44,511
* Well, I hope we're not too messianic *

33
00:01:44,527 --> 00:01:47,329
* Or a trifle too satanic *

34
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:51,078
* We love to play the blues *

35
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:53,817
* Well, I am just a monkey man *

36
00:01:53,842 --> 00:01:56,604
* I'm glad you are a monkey, monkey... *

37
00:01:56,635 --> 00:01:57,871
Hi, Officer.

38
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:59,462
* Monkey woman too, babe *

39
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:00,529
Narrator: After a while,

40
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,135
Logan felt he wanted to try

41
00:02:02,183 --> 00:02:04,149
a less stressful line of work.

42
00:02:04,653 --> 00:02:06,497
He needed direction...

43
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:07,620
badly.

44
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:11,940
But unable to decide which direction

45
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:13,012
his life should take,

46
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:16,231
his big decision was to not make a decision

47
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:18,026
and just enjoy the ride.

48
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:22,423
But years later, the ride was getting old,

49
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,105
and so was he.

50
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,746
It was time to embark on a new career.

51
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:33,314
What could he do where he
wouldn't have to work hard,

52
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,028
earn enough money to live on,

53
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:37,300
but that didn't require an education?

54
00:02:37,786 --> 00:02:40,943
Finally, he stumbled
on the perfect calling.

55
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,419
[Middle Eastern]

56
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,001
Breathe.

57
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:00,887
Wow.

58
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:03,875
Look at you guys.

59
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,458
Awesome.

60
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,249
Flow through and...

61
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:09,985
Shavasana.

62
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,645
Feel how your body rests
against the floor...

63
00:03:15,156 --> 00:03:16,415
and breathe.

64
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,795
So this morning,

65
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:22,131
I'm out at Topanga, and
I'm surfing the barrel,

66
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:25,214
and I get, like, this
total adrenaline rush.

67
00:03:25,767 --> 00:03:27,936
And then I get my waffles at Cora's,

68
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:29,598
and I get my sugar rush.

69
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:32,759
And then I come here,

70
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:34,710
and I get my equanimity.

71
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:38,564
Yoga practice isn't
about toning your thighs.

72
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,149
Although, that's a nice bonus.

73
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,737
But it's about connecting
with that part of yourself

74
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:45,484
that's not what you do or what you have,

75
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:46,966
but your essence.

76
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:49,377
It's about finding that
peace within yourself

77
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:52,645
and leaving here calm and centered.

78
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,738
So,

79
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:57,198
now, picture yourself at the beach.

80
00:03:59,005 --> 00:03:59,994
Quiet.

81
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:01,461
Empty.

82
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:04,287
- The sun warming your skin.
- [surf rolling]

83
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,581
The rhythm of the waves.

84
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:09,548
- In.
- You're perfect.

85
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,428
- Out.
- [surf crashing]

86
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:14,274
In.

87
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,968
Will you marry me?

88
00:04:17,452 --> 00:04:18,693
Out.

89
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:21,738
In.

90
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,591
- Spank me.
- Out.

91
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:24,791
Spank me harder.

92
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,311
If you find your mind wandering,

93
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,037
gently bring it back.

94
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:33,059
Zoe, you rocked it out today. Great job.

95
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,378
Patty, hey, how's the hamstring?

96
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:37,418
Oh! So sorry, so sorry.

97
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,092
Gabrielle, I'm so, so,
so, so sorry I'm late.

98
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,324
Sweetie, are you okay? You're shaking.

99
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:44,833
- Tell me.
- I almost just got killed.

100
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:47,931
Winter, you okay? What happened?

101
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,815
I'm on the bus, and I look out the window,

102
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:52,608
and there's this dog in the middle

103
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:54,972
of all of this traffic on Venice Boulevard.

104
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,272
And I... I don't think, I just jump out,

105
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:00,208
and I run, and I scoop her up.

106
00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:02,009
- And I...
- Can you get her a bottle of water?

107
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,130
And then this woman in an "SVU" honks

108
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:05,967
and rolls down her window and screams,

109
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:09,083
"What are you doing? Are
you an idiot or a whore?"

110
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,403
I'm like... I'm like, "Seriously?"

111
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:13,743
Her kids are in the car. And I'm like,

112
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,948
"Hello. I'm saving a
human life, you bitch."

113
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,632
And then she gives me the
finger and then just drives off.

114
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:22,601
Logan, I swear, I was
gonna be here on time.

115
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:24,875
I'm trying so hard to be more responsible,

116
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:27,277
but I just keep fucking everything up.

117
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:29,505
Are you kidding me? You're amazingly brave.

118
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:30,879
You did the right thing.

119
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:34,996
But I called that cunt a bitch
right in front of her kids.

120
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:37,046
Okay, sweetie, people come here to

121
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:39,114
- de-stress.
- Come on. Come here.

125
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,453
How's Santa Barbara? How's the wedding?

126
00:05:53,014 --> 00:05:54,810
It's gorgeous.

127
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:56,297
I'm a little drunk.

128
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,617
Oh! And they upgraded me to a suite.

129
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:02,778
I want Logan to cut his
class and get his ass up here.

130
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,231
Can you go get him for me?

131
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:07,709
Oh, he's in the bathroom with Winter.

132
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:10,531
Winter? What's he doing
in there with Winter?

133
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:12,685
He's comforting her.

134
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:15,895
She came in late again
all sorry and contrite,

135
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:17,988
but, of course, there's always
some kind of dramatic excuse.

136
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:21,935
Jesus God, I am so sick of
this damsel in distress routine.

137
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,152
Yeah, sometimes...

138
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:27,313
I can't help but wonder
if she's back on the drugs.

Gabriele: Logan? Amanda's on the phone.

143
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,874
Fuck! Amanda said she would fire
me if I was late one more time.

144
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:40,308
No one's gonna fire you.

145
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,183
Just tell her I'll call her right back.

146
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:48,183
Hey, he says, um, he's busy,

147
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,546
but he'll call you back
when he's done with Winter.

148
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,108
And looking this way, please.

Logan at another wedding

three years earlier when
he offered her a drink.

152
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,701
At the time, she was
head of business affairs

for a Hollywood studio,

154
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:12,002
but she was looking for a change.

155
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:14,177
Yeah, come on.

156
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:16,579
Oh, yeah. Oh, fuck, yeah.

157
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:18,956
[both grunting]

158
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:20,568
Oh, yeah.

[chortles, chuckles]

161
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,823
I actually have a friend
who does laugh like that.

162
00:07:30,738 --> 00:07:32,336
And she's a beautiful girl.

163
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,450
When am I gonna see you again?

164
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:39,464
Narrator: When Amanda
quit to open Heart Space,

165
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:42,092
she trained her new
boyfriend as an instructor.

166
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,380
Six weeks later, he moved into her condo.

167
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,630
Hey, Amanda, where's Logan?

168
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:51,767
He's in the bathroom.

169
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,039
You're the only one who believes in me.

170
00:07:58,016 --> 00:08:00,475
If it weren't for you, I
don't know where I'd be.

171
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:06,759
Oh, whoa, hey.

172
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:09,392
We talked about this. I'm with Amanda.

173
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:11,303
- I know.
- [sighs]

174
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,207
Just let me blow you.

175
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:15,177
I really want to.

176
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,402
You don't have to do anything back.

177
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:19,429
I can't.

178
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:22,678
Pull yourself together, and
come out when you're ready.

179
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,854
Wait. Do you mind taking the dog?

180
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,178
Just until I get out of Sober Living.

181
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:29,960
I can't take her to
the pound. I just can't.

182
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:33,347
She's downstairs with these
gardeners who gave us a ride.

183
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:35,443
Okay, just put her in the office.

184
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:37,012
Thank you.

185
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,543
Logan, hi, I'm Dawn Hangii.

186
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:43,734
- Hi.
- Can I get a hug?

187
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:44,776
Everyone else got a hug.

188
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,037
- Sure.
- [chuckles]

189
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:47,706
Oh.

190
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:48,658
Oh!

191
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:50,405
You've done that before.

192
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:51,960
[chuckles] This is two weeks in a row.

193
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,314
I'm glad you're sticking with it.

194
00:08:53,537 --> 00:08:55,436
Thank you. You're good.

195
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:58,349
Look, um, I've been checking you out.

196
00:08:58,596 --> 00:08:59,807
- Not like that.
- Oh?

197
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,883
My, um, partners and I

198
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,052
are looking for someone
to star in a yoga video.

199
00:09:04,072 --> 00:09:07,174
We produced some of
Rodney Yee's early stuff.

200
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:08,603
- I don't know if you...
- Rodney Yee?

201
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,183
- Yeah.
- He... Whoa. He's, like, Rodney Yee.

202
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:13,065
- Oh, you know Rodney?
- Yeah. Whoa?

203
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,198
- Okay. Great.
- Rodney Yee.

204
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:15,356
Well, I just think...

205
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,272
You actually remind me a lot of him.

206
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,319
I mean, obviously, you're Caucasian.

207
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:20,448
- But you know what I mean?
- Right.

208
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:21,409
Like, in a lot of ways.

209
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:24,691
And I just think we could
sell the shit out of you.

210
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:25,511
- Totally.
- Great!

211
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:26,616
I'd love to reach people

212
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:29,248
who don't have the chance
to come to a class like mine.

213
00:09:29,297 --> 00:09:31,662
- That's why...
- Like in the Midwest or... You know?

214
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:33,648
Why don't we get together
tonight for dinner.

215
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,653
- We can talk about it.
- Yeah.

216
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:37,096
- Do you like sushi?
- Oh. Yeah.

217
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,292
Except, my girlfriend
Amanda's my business partner.

218
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:41,499
- She should be there.
- Totally.

219
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,361
- She's out of town until Monday.
- She should be there.

220
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:44,642
- Maybe Monday night?
- Perfect.

221
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,121
I'll have my assistant call you,

222
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:47,658
- and we will set that up.
- Great.

223
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:50,785
I'm so stoked!

224
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:56,624
Narrator: Clearly, the universe
had big plans for Logan.

225
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:58,960
He started seeing signs everywhere,

226
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,395
even little things.

227
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:05,315
He found a parking spot on Abbot Kinney,

228
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:07,166
only a half a block from the restaurant,

229
00:10:07,202 --> 00:10:09,589
which was a miracle on a sunny Saturday.

230
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:12,308
Then, there was an hour left on the meter.

231
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:16,000
Then he saw an actual sign,

232
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:19,078
- which he took as an omen.
- _

233
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:22,147
The timing is perfect. I've been
wanting to buy that Buddha forever.

234
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:25,043
It's like fate. We only
take Visa and MasterCard.

235
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:29,777
[ringtone chimes]

236
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,409
Babe, I was gonna call you.

237
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,128
Hey! How's everything going?

238
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,708
Great. Check this out.
There's this yoga video

239
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:36,865
that this producer wants me to do...

240
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:39,067
I heard somebody was tardy again today.

241
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:42,799
Winter? Yeah. She was saving this dog.

242
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,864
A dog, squirrel, whale.

243
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:49,235
We're running a business,
Logan, not a support group.

244
00:10:49,956 --> 00:10:51,270
It won't happen again.

245
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,780
Until it happens again.

246
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:54,257
I talked to her.

247
00:10:54,482 --> 00:10:55,750
In the bathroom.

248
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:58,192
Jesus! Did Gabrielle say something?

249
00:10:58,219 --> 00:10:59,762
'Cause, fuck, Amanda, the girl

250
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:01,344
was shaking, she was scared.

251
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,873
Are you sleeping with her?

252
00:11:04,195 --> 00:11:06,679
I told you 20 times I'm not.

253
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:08,599
I've always been honest with you.

254
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:10,465
You know that's my thing.

255
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:11,643
Okay.

256
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:14,207
So let's be honest.

257
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,827
Are we ever getting engaged?

258
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:19,312
My deadline was 18 months ago.

259
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:20,684
I can't live like this.

260
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,312
So, just... [chuckles]

261
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:27,748
Do you see us ever getting married or not?

262
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:29,726
Straight answer. Yes or no?

263
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:37,970
Let's not waste any more time.

264
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:40,083
Babe.

265
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,898
I want you out of my condo
before I get back tomorrow night.

266
00:11:44,347 --> 00:11:45,715
Babe.

267
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,269
Just put your keys on
the table by the door.

268
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:51,072
[phone beeps]

269
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:53,951
Amanda?

270
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:01,551
So I bought that Buddha.

271
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,331
The huge one? You didn't.

272
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:05,766
- How much?
- Like two grand.

273
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:07,985
- Oh, my God.
- What? Does it shit gold?

274
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:10,040
It's from Tibet or Thailand.

275
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:12,126
And it's marked down, like, 60 percent.

276
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:13,481
I never would have bought it,

277
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,610
except this producer wants
me to star in a yoga video.

278
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,292
- Oh, that's awesome. Congrats, man.
- Dude,

279
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,227
see? I told you. You are a rock star.

280
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:22,071
- Yeah, I'm psyched.
- You should be.

281
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:24,347
No, no. No bread. Take that away.

282
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:25,707
- What are you doing?
- [mutters]

283
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:27,756
I asked for that bread. I wanted bread.

284
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,203
- You can't just send...
- I'm on a cleanse, Matteo.

285
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:32,201
- Oh, wow.
- Nothing but organic juice.

286
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:34,049
You guys should do it
with me. I feel great.

287
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,931
My skin has, like, a
totally different texture.

288
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,798
- Get a load of that.
- No. You're a girl.

289
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,679
Yeah, whose gonna have
six percent body fat.

290
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:41,122
Suck my dick.

291
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,052
Yeah, Amanda and I broke up.

292
00:12:44,172 --> 00:12:45,726
What? When?

293
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:48,316
Just now before I got here.

294
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:49,730
Good for you.

295
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,195
How does the Buddha get top billing?

296
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,418
I mean, she was fine at first.

297
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,038
But lately, she's been such a bummer.

298
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:56,121
- What happened?
- It's the marriage thing.

299
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:58,831
She's at a wedding, and
that always sets her off.

300
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:01,906
It's normal for her to want
some sort of real commitment.

301
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:03,811
You guys have been together a long time.

302
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:06,470
So what, he's supposed to marry
some chick he's not in love with?

303
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,992
Whoa, I never said I didn't love her.

304
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:12,887
Look, all relationships
have ebbs and flows.

305
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,386
Are you sure this isn't

306
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,129
- an intimacy thing?
- Leave him alone.

307
00:13:16,146 --> 00:13:17,699
He's not one of your patients.

308
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:19,599
So now that you're free, you should ask

309
00:13:19,627 --> 00:13:22,268
some of those models in your
classes to come out with us.

310
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:23,310
You can be the lure.

311
00:13:23,364 --> 00:13:25,074
And I can be the lure's cute,

312
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:26,636
horny, well-endowed friend.

313
00:13:26,664 --> 00:13:27,818
Yeah, 'cause it's all about you.

314
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:29,177
Did you take a nap today?

315
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:31,472
Anyway, I am gonna get the burger.

316
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:33,920
I haven't had red meat
since Amanda went vegan.

317
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,871
Oh, fuck it. I'm getting one, too.

318
00:13:36,944 --> 00:13:37,897
And a shake.

319
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,448
And a beer. And some fries.

320
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:42,283
Could we get some bread over here, please?

321
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:45,611
I remember this luggage
from the last time you moved.

322
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:49,319
Amanda is never gonna find
another guy like you again.

323
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,115
How old is she anyway?

324
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,457
Okay, so, now what? You got a game plan?

325
00:13:54,577 --> 00:13:55,973
No, I'm just gonna stay up at my dad's

326
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:57,180
till I figure out what I wanna do.

327
00:13:57,229 --> 00:13:59,083
I thought he was living with
his girlfriend and her kids.

328
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,841
He is. I'm gonna stay in the teepee.

329
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:03,668
You're not gonna stay
in that fucking teepee.

330
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,607
It's fine. I'm happy to
get back to a simpler life.

331
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:09,144
It's so easy to get caught
up in all this stuff.

332
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,779
I don't care what anyone
says, stuff makes me happy.

333
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,375
Every time I see stuff I don't have,

334
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:15,620
I think how much happier
I'd be if I owned it.

335
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,452
Like, after I got this watch,

336
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:19,839
I love my wrist.

337
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,437
Anyways, just for now, if
that yoga video takes off...

338
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,645
I'll find you a house
on the beach in Malibu.

339
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:25,989
I'll even cut my commission.

340
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,263
You'll eat your commission, douchebag.

341
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:30,589
Aren't we kind of getting
ahead of ourselves? I mean,

342
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,368
even if the video happens,

343
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,011
what's your plan in the meantime?

344
00:14:35,237 --> 00:14:36,771
Have you thought about
where you're gonna work?

345
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:38,297
At the studio.

346
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,087
Why?

347
00:14:39,868 --> 00:14:41,311
Isn't that gonna be kind of awkward?

348
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:43,608
You guys just broke up three hours ago.

349
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:46,188
Amanda's a smart businesswoman.

350
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:47,479
We're great partners.

351
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,684
I just have to show her
that we can still be cool.

352
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:51,310
I don't know.

353
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:53,941
Women are full of rage.

354
00:14:54,774 --> 00:14:56,433
Will you at least be
able to keep the Lexus,

355
00:14:56,457 --> 00:14:58,113
or will you be riding a horse now?

356
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:12,253
Hey, you okay?

357
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,592
- Wanna go grab a drink?
- Sure.

358
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:17,478
[dog barks]

359
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,614
Woman: Muffin, get back here.

360
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:21,349
- [barking continues]
- [groans]

361
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:23,003
[Middle Eastern]

362
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:26,404
Hello?

363
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:28,923
Dog?

364
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:33,294
[dog barks]

365
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:36,980
Hey.

366
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:41,207
Oh, oh, oh, you stink.

367
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:42,559
[barks]

368
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:45,111
Dude, you're hitting the showers.

369
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:46,307
[water running]

370
00:15:49,877 --> 00:15:51,067
Can I help?

371
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:54,249
[continues]

372
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,680
How do you feel?

373
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:28,136
Good.

374
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:30,140
Lighter.

375
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:32,887
You released a lot of dark energy.

376
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,740
Just lie there. Get up slowly.

377
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,345
- I'm gonna get you some water.
- Thanks.

378
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,296
[continues]

379
00:16:49,203 --> 00:16:53,388
[moaning, panting]

380
00:16:53,393 --> 00:16:54,593
- Logan!
- Yeah.

381
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:55,806
- Logan!
- Yeah.

382
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,227
- Logan, say my name!
- Winter.

383
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,761
- Yeah!
- Winter.

384
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:01,580
- Yeah!
- Winter!

385
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:04,432
- Amanda?
- Winter: Logan, I'm coming!

386
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:08,127
Hey, you might wanna get back here.

387
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:16,126
[sighs]

388
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:18,398
This is perfect.

389
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,401
I'll take care of you.

390
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:25,935
We could take care of each other.

391
00:17:26,422 --> 00:17:29,267
Oh, yeah. This is great.

392
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:31,650
Um, let's just...

393
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:34,340
You know, let's take things slow.

394
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:36,133
[door closes]

395
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:38,665
Logan, what was that?

396
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:42,357
[clattering in distance]

397
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:55,570
- Amanda.
- Hey!

398
00:17:55,603 --> 00:17:57,418
I just came by to pick up a few things.

399
00:17:57,437 --> 00:17:59,086
- Don't let me interrupt you.
- What are you doing here?

400
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:01,507
I came back early from Santa Barbara.

401
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,193
- Surprise!
- Wait.

402
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,358
Can we talk, please?

403
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:07,094
- Hi, Winter.
- Hi.

404
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:08,649
Amanda, I was telling the truth.

405
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,669
We never did it when we were together.

406
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:15,584
So, you waited the requisite
two-minute mourning grace period

407
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,992
between breakup and penetration.

408
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,238
I'm gonna get dressed.

409
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:21,741
- I'm sorry. I'm so fucking stupid.
- No,

410
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:23,646
this has actually been helpful.

411
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,666
- Thank you for the clarity.
- Where are you going?

412
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:27,180
I quit.

413
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:30,268
It's less stressful
being a studio executive.

414
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,583
You can't quit. What about the business?

415
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:36,349
I don't care about the business.

416
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:38,584
You can close it.

417
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:39,767
You can buy me out.

418
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,550
You can burn it down,
and Winter can smoke it.

419
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,992
But you're gonna have to make a decision

420
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:46,120
for once in your life.

421
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,723
Okay, babe, I know you're upset.

422
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:51,008
I get it. But we're a great team.

423
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:52,460
We built this place into something.

424
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,973
I built this place into something.

425
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:59,148
I opened it. I paid the bills.

426
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,144
I played the heavy and
did all the shit work

427
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,145
while you wore skimpy outfits

428
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:05,019
and pretended you knew something.

429
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,441
Hey, I'm the draw.

430
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:07,855
I'm the reason that people come here.

431
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,584
Without me, there'd be no Heart Space.

432
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:12,112
Then you buy the business,
you're such a big draw.

433
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:13,064
Okay.

434
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,776
Okay. I will.

435
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,151
Just tell me how to do it.

436
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:18,556
[chuckles]

437
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:21,456
[laughing]

438
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,348
That was so intense.

439
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:35,333
I'm here for you no matter what.

440
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,594
But if you don't drop me off at
Sober Living, like, right now,

441
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:40,495
I am so fucked.

442
00:19:52,554 --> 00:19:54,487
[shouting in distance]

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,592
[dog barking]

444
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:02,168
- Hey, dog?
- [dog barks]

445
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,698
[knocking]

446
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:06,769
Dad?

447
00:20:09,964 --> 00:20:12,110
Give me that, little shit.

448
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:22,778
Jesus, what was that?

449
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,553
My girlfriend's running
a little sleepover camp

450
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:28,685
to bring in some change.

451
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:31,659
Medical marijuana's killing me.

452
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,273
What a scam.

453
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:35,219
You must be going out of your mind.

454
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:37,062
You were never much of a kid person.

455
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,023
Hey, we all gotta eat shit to live,

456
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,932
except the rich people.

457
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:45,401
What happened to the teepee?

458
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:47,017
The kids trashed it.

459
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,118
[dog barks]

460
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,788
What the hell was that?

461
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:52,035
- [dog barks]
- That was the dog.

462
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:55,190
If you had married Amanda like she wanted,

463
00:20:55,215 --> 00:20:56,390
you'd be set.

464
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,628
Half that studio would be yours.

465
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:01,418
Jesus, Dad, I'm not gonna marry Amanda

466
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:02,824
just to live off of her.

467
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:05,912
Just giving you the benefit of my wisdom.

468
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:09,268
You won't be young and pretty forever.

469
00:21:10,056 --> 00:21:12,983
Anyway, the studio's mine
now. I'm buying her out.

470
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:14,769
[coughing, laughing]

471
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,977
You?

472
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:18,760
What do you know about running a business?

473
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,318
I've been there since the beginning.

474
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:21,576
I'll get people to help me.

475
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:24,362
Where you gonna get the
money for this venture?

476
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,808
I'll figure it out.

477
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,854
Okay, here's an idea.

478
00:21:28,806 --> 00:21:31,813
I got a couple of pounds
of sativa to unload.

479
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:34,179
I'm not selling weed for you.

480
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:36,773
Besides, I might be doing this yoga video.

481
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:39,820
- And if that works out...
- That's different.

482
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:41,416
You could shoot it up here.

483
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:43,964
They pay money for locations, right?

484
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:47,331
It's still... It's in the...
It's in the beginning stages.

485
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:48,844
[chuckles] Right.

486
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:52,283
Here's a sample when you change your mind.

487
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:56,476
Easy money.

488
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:04,384
[owl hooting]

489
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:07,454
[dog barking]

490
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:09,824
And how did that make you feel?

491
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:13,193
Oh, being called a pathological liar?

492
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:14,552
Fantastic.

493
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:17,064
How do you think it
made me feel? Like shit.

494
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,133
So how did you handle it?

495
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:20,500
I told her I wasn't lying.

496
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,321
But weren't you

497
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:23,892
lying?

498
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:27,187
I did work for Michael Kors, okay?

499
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,644
I wasn't a handbag designer,

500
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:32,012
but I gave a lot of input
when I was an intern.

501
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:35,186
And they ripped off a lot of my ideas.

502
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:36,059
So,

503
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:37,602
you know what,

504
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:39,318
I'm getting out of fashion anyway.

505
00:22:39,342 --> 00:22:41,907
I'm producing this yoga video, so...

506
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:43,586
Dawn,

507
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,648
is this a real thing,

508
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:47,662
or something you wish was real?

509
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,316
Why are you always so negative?

510
00:22:50,731 --> 00:22:53,627
Yoga is blowing up. It's
big business. And I have

511
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,556
the hottest guy to star in it.

512
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:57,911
He teaches at this place on Abbot Kinney

513
00:22:57,938 --> 00:23:00,480
next to Intelligentsia, that place.

514
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:02,943
I promise you...

515
00:23:03,193 --> 00:23:04,845
women are gonna cream their pants for him.

516
00:23:07,848 --> 00:23:09,175
What's his name?

517
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:11,136
It was totally amicable.

518
00:23:11,196 --> 00:23:12,952
Amanda was just feeling burnt out.

519
00:23:13,002 --> 00:23:15,181
So we both agreed it was
best for her to move on.

520
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:17,800
But I wish her all the joy
and happiness she deserves.

521
00:23:18,192 --> 00:23:21,475
- Move on?
- What's gonna happen with the studio?

522
00:23:22,105 --> 00:23:23,898
I'm buying her out. I'm taking over.

523
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:26,161
- What?
- So who's gonna run it?

524
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:28,002
I am.

525
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:29,485
But who's actually gonna run it?

526
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:30,965
Me.

527
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,539
Excuse me.

528
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:34,492
Cool, man. Good for you.

529
00:23:34,518 --> 00:23:35,834
Thanks, Navaris.

530
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:38,939
I want this to be a place
where we can all contribute

531
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:41,415
- and be, like, our highest selves.
- I love it.

532
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:44,012
Anyway, I gotta go. I got an
audition for "The Big Bang Theory"

533
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:46,189
all the way over at Warner
Brothers, so I gotta bounce.

534
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:48,073
But sincerest congrats.

535
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,632
Oh, and someone needs to take care
of my Ashtanga Power Blast at 2:00.

536
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,809
- You're the boss.
- Yeah, I'm not covering.

537
00:23:53,828 --> 00:23:55,962
He pulls that crap all
the time. I'm sick of it.

538
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:58,558
Um, are we still getting health insurance?

539
00:23:58,568 --> 00:24:02,188
Amanda said we were. I need my wisdom
teeth out. I am in a lot of pain.

540
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,420
I'll look into it. Can
you cover for Navaris?

541
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,422
No, I can't, I'm getting
a shirodhara massage

542
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:10,207
with Shakti for my teeth pain.

543
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,371
Oh, my God. I know I'm late.

544
00:24:12,491 --> 00:24:15,930
But this guy gets on the bus,
who's totally off of his meds.

545
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:17,914
And he thinks he knows me. And he's like,

546
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:18,949
"Rebecca.

547
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:20,701
Rebecca."

548
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:25,059
What's going on?

549
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,568
Look, you gotta leave for work earlier

550
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,374
so you can plan for
stuff like that to happen.

551
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:32,983
I'm the boss now. I can't look like
I'm giving you special treatment.

552
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,105
I know.

553
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,006
Can I see you later?

554
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,968
I wanna fuck you so bad.

555
00:24:37,972 --> 00:24:40,655
- I can't talk about this stuff here.
- Bummer.

556
00:24:40,775 --> 00:24:42,242
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

557
00:24:42,342 --> 00:24:43,831
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

558
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:45,579
Oh, I totally forgot.

559
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:48,581
There's these guys downstairs
with some enormous Buddha.

560
00:24:48,594 --> 00:24:50,084
They need a hundred bucks
for delivery or something.

561
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:52,787
Okay. Great. I'll be right down.

562
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:59,093
Gabrielle: Amanda, you can't
leave. Logan is not up to this.

563
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:01,472
You should've seen how
freaked out everyone was.

564
00:25:01,495 --> 00:25:04,064
Nobody thinks he can do this. OK? Nobody.

565
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,779
He was like a side of beef
spouting these platitudes,

566
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:09,265
"I wish Amanda nothing
but happiness and joy."

567
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:10,570
He said that?

568
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,306
He wishes me happiness and joy?

569
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,339
What an asshole.

570
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,871
I know. I am begging you.

571
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:19,425
Get rid of him.

572
00:25:19,446 --> 00:25:21,916
Let him go. Fire him.

573
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:24,213
Or if you'd rather, I am
happy to do it for you.

574
00:25:24,618 --> 00:25:26,056
No, no. No, no.

575
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:29,436
You know, he thinks he
can do it without me.

576
00:25:29,747 --> 00:25:30,662
Let him try.

577
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,861
I would love to see how that goes.

578
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:35,396
I am gonna sell him the studio.

579
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:38,987
And I predict, in six months max,

580
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:40,765
he's gonna crash and burn.

581
00:25:41,985 --> 00:25:44,372
Fuckin' happiness and joy?

582
00:25:48,331 --> 00:25:52,108
Okay, sweetie. You know what,
let me, um, call you back later.

583
00:25:52,145 --> 00:25:55,398
My sister, boy problems. [nervous chuckle]

584
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:57,952
Um, where do we keep the checkbook?

585
00:25:58,177 --> 00:26:01,323
Oh, um, right here.

586
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,494
[horns honking]

587
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:10,720
Oh, Jesus. Hey, did I
thank you for inviting us

588
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,546
to help you carry this incredibly heavy,

589
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:14,224
awkward statue up the stairs?

590
00:26:14,245 --> 00:26:15,972
Yeah, the snark is really helping, Cody.

591
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:19,111
Oh, God. Buddha needs to
get his ass to Jenny Craig.

592
00:26:19,832 --> 00:26:20,668
All right,

593
00:26:21,201 --> 00:26:22,535
stupid cross-legged bastard.

594
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:24,084
- Hold on! Here we go!
- Whoa!

595
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,953
No, left, left! No, stop!

596
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:29,819
Oh, Jesus.

597
00:26:29,884 --> 00:26:31,765
Oh, shit. Are you kidding me?

598
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:33,443
- What did you do?
- Why didn't you warn us?

599
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:35,966
- What do you think stop means?
- It's got many meanings.

600
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,679
- I'm coming down.
- [dog barking]

601
00:26:40,027 --> 00:26:42,353
Oh, I could have told
you that wouldn't fit.

602
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:43,842
Did you guys measure?

603
00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:45,913
No, we didn't measure, Gabrielle.

604
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:47,623
But thanks, that's really constructive.

605
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,026
Anything else? Did I park my car okay?

606
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:51,972
Did I wear the right color
pants? You got a problem?

607
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:53,561
- Just lay it on me.
- Wow.

608
00:26:53,606 --> 00:26:55,899
Let's go for a walk. Let's go
for a walk. That's all right.

609
00:26:57,455 --> 00:26:59,864
Just relax. Relax.

610
00:27:00,124 --> 00:27:01,410
What's going on?

611
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:04,391
I heard her talking to Amanda on the phone.

612
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:06,052
Nobody thinks I can do this.

613
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,071
You should have seen their faces

614
00:27:07,087 --> 00:27:08,303
when I told them I was taking over.

615
00:27:08,315 --> 00:27:10,798
They were like, "Oh, shit. This
guy's gonna ruin our lives."

616
00:27:10,822 --> 00:27:12,299
Dude, you'll be fine.

617
00:27:12,336 --> 00:27:15,326
You've got all these rich
women salivating all over you.

618
00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:18,241
That's what you think? You think I
need some woman to take care of me?

619
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:19,569
That's what my dad thinks.

620
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:22,302
No, you're a good teacher. I've seen you.

621
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:24,426
I don't want to be a
teacher the rest of my life.

622
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:26,186
I want something of my own.

623
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,116
I'm gonna wind up like my dad

624
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:30,353
with nothing, just scraping by.

625
00:27:30,384 --> 00:27:32,013
No, you won't. You've got that video.

626
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:33,687
He can't count on some video.

627
00:27:36,293 --> 00:27:37,996
Do you think I can run the studio?

628
00:27:38,997 --> 00:27:39,905
Be honest.

629
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:41,455
Don't bullshit me, man.

630
00:27:42,074 --> 00:27:43,723
Okay, yes.

631
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:46,226
But there's gonna be a learning curve.

632
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:49,978
You're gonna have to stick with
it and do some work on yourself.

633
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:51,997
So you don't think I can do it.

634
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:53,633
What does it matter what he thinks?

635
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:54,922
Man up.

636
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:57,219
For the past 20 years,
I've looked up to you.

637
00:27:57,237 --> 00:27:58,838
I thought, if I could be that guy...

638
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:01,314
your charisma, looks,

639
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:02,679
good at every sport,

640
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:04,423
women opening their legs for you

641
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:06,431
without you having to do anything.

642
00:28:06,514 --> 00:28:09,964
I mean, Jesus, all that. I thought if
I could be that guy, I'd have it made.

643
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:13,611
But now you're acting
like a little whiny baby.

644
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:18,109
Oh, life's hard. Nobody thinks I can do it.

645
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,594
So prove them wrong.

646
00:28:20,694 --> 00:28:23,264
You have everything. Just own it.

647
00:28:23,573 --> 00:28:25,079
If you don't feel it, fake it.

648
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:27,325
But this is your defining moment.

649
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:29,362
Who are you gonna be?

650
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:31,705
[Middle Eastern]

651
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,576
Narrator: Logan was slowly
waking up to his life,

652
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:38,420
as if from a dream.

653
00:28:39,628 --> 00:28:41,001
Hey, Gabrielle?

654
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:42,592
I need a second.

655
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:46,102
Narrator: He was now on his path,
whether he wanted to be or not.

656
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:51,226
So, listen, uh, you and
me, it's not gonna work.

657
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:53,292
So the deal is,

658
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,432
I'm firing you.

659
00:28:55,662 --> 00:28:58,298
[continues]

660
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:00,183
You can't fire me. I'm...

661
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:03,118
I'm the only one who
knows what goes on here.

662
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:05,197
You didn't even know
where the checkbook was.

663
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:08,030
Well, now I do.

664
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:09,803
See ya.

665
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,677
Oh, my fucking shantiel.

666
00:29:14,797 --> 00:29:16,227
Narrator: Logan was learning that growth

667
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:18,552
didn't always mean measuring the Buddha,

668
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:20,791
but how you handle it when it gets stuck.

669
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:22,089
Sorry, everybody.

670
00:29:22,189 --> 00:29:24,877
Uh, the Buddha was late for class.

671
00:29:24,885 --> 00:29:25,874
He was running up the stairs,

672
00:29:25,924 --> 00:29:27,727
and didn't realize he
put on so much weight.

673
00:29:27,827 --> 00:29:29,496
[scattered chuckles]

674
00:29:29,596 --> 00:29:31,065
Just head around back,

675
00:29:31,098 --> 00:29:33,264
till we get this big
guy out of here. Thanks.

676
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:35,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

677
00:29:35,985 --> 00:29:37,613
- Later.
- Way to go, dude.

678
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:39,510
You fired your first employee.

679
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:40,747
Direct. To the point.

680
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,736
Wasn't easy, but you
did what you had to do.

681
00:29:42,776 --> 00:29:43,710
That's leadership.

682
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,705
Cool.

683
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,329
Maybe not the best business move,

684
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:47,814
but good for you.

685
00:29:47,914 --> 00:29:50,484

686
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:00,494
