-Music-

00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,594
Everything he came with is in
here.

00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:41,101
John, come say goodbye to Cory.

00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,676
-Music-

00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,590
Amtrak silver here. For your
safety, please remain inside the
yellow line

00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:59,262
and wait for the train to come
to a complete stop.

00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:06,769
Passenger service continues now
Norwood and Sycamore.

00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,264
You must be Cory.

00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,892
I'm Miss Hanks your case worker.

00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,480
And these are your new foster
parents Mr. and Miss Kepperman.

00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:56,903
Hi Cory. I'm Michelle.

00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:02,909
I'm Dan. Let me get that for
you.

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,831
Well uh, this just says that you
received the child and
everything is in order.

00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,251
If you would just sign here
please.

00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,295
So Cory I will be seeing you on
Saturday.

00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,465
We have a group called Foster
Friends,

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,218
and we do all kinds of exciting
things.

00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,720
We sing at hospitals and nursing
homes.

00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,765
We go roller skating. Now
doesn■t that sound like fun?

00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,478
It'd be fun to see you fall and
watch you try to get up.

00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:36,317
Tudaloo everybody.

00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:41,114
Well um, the cars over this way.
So...

00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,496
Got a surprise for you.

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,376
These are for you.

00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:59,966
Thanks. I'll save the bag for
the next kid.

00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,958
That will teach you to defy me!

00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,795
Why can't I destroy you?

00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:43,843
I am a Titan! I am invincible!
Your weapons can not harm me.

00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:48,598
Nothing can hurt me!

00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,769
Cory, for the seventh time this
month your teacher called.

00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:59,317
She's concerned about your
grades.

00:05:59,484 --> 00:05:59,859
Cory!

00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,617
I know it's only been 4 weeks,

00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,037
but I thought maybe we could
spend some time on your math
today.

00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,789
But its Saturday!

00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,791
Perfect day to get in some
batting practice.

00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,584
Honey its kind of rainy.

00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,795
It will stop.

00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,381
How bout we play some and work
some

00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,466
when Miss Hanks brings you back.

00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,844
I don't wanna go with Miss Hanks
and her fractured friends.

00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,347
Foster Friends Cory.

00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:33,017
Do I have to?

00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,353
[car horn] Yes you do, there she
is.

00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,328
Oh Michelles so nice, why don't
you wave to her.

00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,415
Well your very lucky to be with
the Keppermans.

00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,458
Why at their age and no children
of their own,

00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,294
they might just be thinking of
adoption!

00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,089
WOO! Wouldn't that be
wonderful?!

00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:11,431
That■s it right up the stairs.
Cmon, cmon.

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,519
Ok now hold on. Now don't be
nervous, and smile.

00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,063
And don't you ruin it.

00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:24,360
Go on in now everyone knows were
coming, and the patients are
very excited.

00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,167
Welcome Miss Hanks, welcome
children.

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,211
Edgewaters, these are the foster
children

00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,756
who will be entertaining us
today.

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,717
Thank you Miss Cybil.

00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,179
The children have two songs
they'd like to sing for you
today.

00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:56,017
The first number is that
inspiring piece from the civil
war era,

00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,146
"The battle hymn of the
republic".

00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,567
"Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the lord,

00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,238
He is trampling out the vintage
where the grapes of wrath are
stored,

00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:13,743
He hath loosed his fateful
lightning of his terrible swift
sword,

00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:18,498
His truth is marching on.

00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:23,002
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:27,465
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah.

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,219
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,264
His truth is marching on!

00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:41,604
[canon explodes]

00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,355
■ Music ■

00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:58,996
Yes!

00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,831
Woo!

00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:01,582
■ Music ■

00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,844
You better stand up straight and
sing, and I mean it.

00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,598
Wasn't that lovely Blaine?
Elcie?

00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,517
We have some refreshments.

00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,227
Perhaps the children would like
to serve them.

00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,521
Oh, I■m sure they would.

00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:31,195
I■m sure they wouldn't

00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,532
[snoring]

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,075
[sigh]

00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,036
I saw you turn down her oxygen!

00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,081
You have now turned all of us
into zombies.

00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:45,793
Carlotta, now behave. Have
something to drink

00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,796
I do not want any of that!

00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:53,342
It tastes like dishwater, ugh!

00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,554
Now you call that entertainment?

00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,724
In our show we had children
younger than you,

00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,560
Juggling on the high wire.

00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,021
Do not quit your day job first
of May.

00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,775
Oh, Cybil who do you have for us
in act 2?

00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,527
Dr. Kevorkian?

00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,530
If you cant fit in peacefully,
you'll have to leave.

00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:19,827
What? And miss the moldy
macaroons and the Macarena
lesson?

00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,874
Oh how could I possibly live
without that?

00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,126
I watched you. You did not sing.

00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,961
So?

00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,297
But I understand.

00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,591
I do not like to sing in this
place either

00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,594
oh, ohhhh.

00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,387
Were off!

00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,139
Make sure she has her
medication.

00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,226
Oh, be gone before someone drops
a house on you!

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,483
[car horn]

00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,616
Hey Cory

00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,325
[phone rings]

00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,078
Oh, Ill get it.

00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,704
What'd I tell you, is this
baseball weather or what.

00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,207
Oh hey.

00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,626
Why do you always wear that
raggedy old hat?

00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,169
Well sit down,

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,880
This isn't just any old hat
Cory.

00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:17,760
This is an official New York
Yankees baseball hat.

00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:25,393
My dad got this for me at Yankee
Stadium a long time ago.

00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,729
Yankee Stadium, the house that
Ruth built.

00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,650
One of the greatest dynasties in
sports history.

00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,360
Well, whats a dynasty?

00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,989
A dynasty is when you have a
really great team that just
keeps winning,

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,991
and they pass it on year after
year

00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,661
some teams can keep it up for a
couple or three years,

00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,415
but the Yankees did it for 30
years in a row

00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,585
started out with Babe Ruth, the
Bambino. the Sultan of Swat

00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,004
then it went on to Lou Gherig,
the iron horse

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,218
and then, the greatest all
around baseball player of all
time.

00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,637
The Yankee clipper, Joe
Dimmagio.

00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,222
Could do everything Cory.

00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,475
He could hit for power, hit for
average, run, field, throw.

00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:07,393
My dad said that he saw him play
once

00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,271
Danny, its for you.

00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,065
Be right back.

00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,734
How was your singing debut?

00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,485
Sucked eggs.

00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:17,987
Did you make any new friends?

00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:21,824
Nope, all geeks and zombies

00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,159
I picked up some flashcards,

00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,619
I thought we could work on math
facts together.

00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,373
Why don't you just poison me?
Its more humane.

00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,167
Could be fun?

00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,794
Us foster kids may be a little
dumb,

00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,464
but we know whats a good time
and whats not

00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,382
I understand Cory.

00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,592
No you don't.

00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,721
Yes, I do.

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,975
There■s something that people
don't know about me...

00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,561
One of the supervisors called in
sick and I gotta go to work.

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,520
No!

00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,982
I■m sorry I tried. They're
heartless.

00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,193
Maybe we can do this next
Saturday huh?

00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,652
Doesn■t matter

00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,988
Cory i'm really sorry.

00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:01,572
Its ok.

00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,164
■ Music ■

00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:35,606
Hello? Anybody home?

00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,361
Cool.

00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,495
Hey you boy!

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,788
What is that you have?

00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,872
A turtle.

00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:56,043
Bring it here! Come! I will not
bite!

00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,130
You are the boy who came not to
sing this morning.

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,550
Yea.

00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,510
What does it do?

00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,304
Nothing but hide?

00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,307
So? Hes invincible.

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,893
He does not seem like much of a
pet

00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,688
I had an elephant.

00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:20,276
One step and you would be flat
like a pizza.

00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,527
An elephant, sure lady.

00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,071
No, no, no it did not belong to
me.

00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,074
It belonged to the circus but I
was there when she was born

00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,993
and I got to name her.

00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:34,582
Yea I called her Annabelle.

00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,590
I joined the circus when I was
16.

00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,801
Started out selling cotton
candy.

00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,555
Then I became the magician's
assistant

00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,894
and later I was madame sargosa,
fortune teller.

00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,147
Sees all, knows all.

00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,735
And after that the circus
changed.

00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,112
What is your name young man?

00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,991
Don't you know? Some fortune
teller!

00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,829
I know you have a smart mouth,
but not much else is smart!

00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,456
Tell me your name

00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,832
Cory Wainwright.

00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,626
So, what's my fortune?

00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:25,174
Well, there may be things in
your future you do not want to
know.

00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:31,263
Look Cory Wainwright, your
turtle is running away.

00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,892
It wants to be free it does not
want to be your pet.

00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,394
Everything wants to be free.

00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:42,858
You, me, even that old turtle.

00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,444
Well did you let your elephant
go?

00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,447
Carlotta?

00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,657
Is that your name, carlotta?

00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,991
Yes.

00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,201
Whats your last name?

00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,578
Just carlotta.

00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,458
Why carlotta dear, what on earth
you are going to catch your
death.

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,877
Weren't you one of Mrs hanks
children?

00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,045
Yea.

00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,046
What is that thing?

00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:04,964
Its a turtle.

00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,051
Well get it out of here it can
carry all kinds of diseases.

00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,054
You oughtta go on home now. This
is a quiet place.

00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,597
A place for the elderly.

00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,516
Go on now.

00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,604
Ill show you something tomorrow.

00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,235
Did you know that the sea turtle
can swim 20mph

00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,698
and a smooth soft-shell turtle
can out run a man on solid
ground.

00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,490
Wow!

00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,284
See what a library card and a
little digging turns up.

00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,455
Yea but he doesn't look like he
can out run anything.

00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:44,294
Well he's a box turtle. He's
built for comfort not speed I
guess.

00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,463
So what does he eat?

00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,966
Um, just about anything it says.

00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,093
They especially like fruits

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,303
I learned the hard way that they
like vegetables.

00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,097
One used to sneak into my garden
and take a bite out of.

00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,600
My best vegetable before it was
perfect and ripe.

00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,979
Dan wanted to get rid of it but
I thought it was cute.

00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,982
But not as cute as you

00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,695
I got to find a place where I
can keep him.

00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,491
Here, this might work for
tonight.

00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,327
There you go.

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,124
Yea this will be a good home,
for...

00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,002
What are you gonna call him?

00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:33,010
Well um, how about Mr. T?

00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,558
Lets see if Mr. T. likes this.

00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,562
Here it goes again.

00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,065
There you go, open up.

00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,317
Huh?

00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,777
How come he wont eat?

00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,362
I don't know.

00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,699
Do you think he's lonely?

00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,827
Maybe he is.

00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,623
Well tomorrow ill go find him a
Mrs T.

00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,417
What if he is a Mrs t?

00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,877
What page is that on?

00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,962
Hey guys, whats for supper?

00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:13,467
Oh turtle soup huh mmm

00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:21,517
[baseball chatter]

00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,560
Strike 2!

00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,188
Your the new foster kid in ms.
Fukes class aren't you?

00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,564
Yea

00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,068
I hear your going to flunk.

00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:35,614
Strike 3! He's dead meat, he's
toast, stick a fork in him, he's
done!

00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,088
Rained out huh?

00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,134
Worse, struck out.

00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,594
Mind if I sit down?

00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,847
Sure

00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:05,602
I want you to know that hitting
a baseball is a very difficult
thing to do.

00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,729
What do you know about baseball?

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,897
A little

00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,442
I had a couple brothers that
were pretty good.

00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,155
Baseball has always been very
important to my family.

00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,658
Yea well I don't have a family.

00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:24,246
I■m just a foster kid.

00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,456
There was this ball player.

00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,293
A big lefty outfielder

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,628
I saw him a couple of times.

00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,215
He grew up in a home for boys,

00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,051
And he struck out a few times
himself

00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,847
1,330 times.

00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,432
How'd he stay on the team?

00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:48,187
In between, he hit 714 home
runs.

00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,479
Who was he?

00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,148
Ever hear of Babe Ruth?

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,858
Sure who hasn't?

00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,446
Lots of people consider him the
greatest ball player that ever
lived.

00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,492
My new foster dad says its some
other old dude, was the greatest

00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,872
Joe D something.

00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,167
Your foster dad sounds like a
very smart fellow.

00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,668
Whats your name?

00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,669
Cory.

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,797
Whats yours?

00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,925
My name is Joe. nice to meet you
Cory.

00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,721
Listen to the people that care
about you, even the old dudes.

00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:27,309
And when you go to swing, keep
your head in.

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,396
Always watch that ball try to
make contact with the bat.

00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,649
Now you'll never see that
happen,

00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,194
But that■s the idea. With
confidence.

00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,655
And shoulder to shoulder. Don't
forget that.

00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,739
Shoulder to shoulder.

00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:41,865
Shoulder to shoulder.

00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:47,079
Show me how you would swing.

00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,121
Shoulder to shoulder.

00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:52,292
Shoulder to shoulder.

00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:57,798
That■s the idea, but keep your
head right on that ball.

00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,133
That should do the trick.

00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,763
Yea way to go Cory!

00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,224
Ehh lucky shot lucky shot.

00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,476
Luck had nothing to do with
that.

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,894
Ah, we'll see buddy.

00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:17,109
Ok here■s the deal, you hit this
one, I do dishes for a week.

00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,361
Shoulder to shoulder.

00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,488
Hit it downtown Cory!

00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:37,170
Safe! Safe!

00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,799
Tackle baseball he's out!

00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,514
Is this the circus you were in?

00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,978
Yes, this was the great circus
in the age of great circus'

00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,731
And here is my dear friend
Dingy.

00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,151
Dingy, Dingy the clown.

00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,319
Is that your elephant?

00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:07,826
Yes, this is Annabelle. here she
was just two months old.

00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:08,827
Is that your right there?

00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,037
Yes.

00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,039
And who's that?

00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,999
Peter John

00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:21,631
Peter John sent me this from
Burma.

00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,426
Did you marry him?

00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,802
No.

00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:30,015
Now tell me about you

00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,559
well I live in a foster home
right down the street

00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,604
oh, are they good parents?

00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,775
They are my fourth set. Michelle
and Dan

00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,320
I need you to pull a job for me.

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,699
Here, here.

00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:52,621
Three cups of un-hulled sesame
seeds and.

00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,457
Pistachios, if you can find
them.

00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:00,629
And I have to get into the
kitchen at night, and that can
be tricky.

00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:01,797
I could get caught.

00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:02,881
[gasp]

00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,718
You don't want to know what they
do to prisoners here.

00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,096
What are you making a bomb?

00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,264
No, halva.

00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:11,932
Halva?

00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:17,145
Halva is Turkish candy. Its what
angels eat in heaven.

00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,564
Makes you wise. ill give you
some.

00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,235
So is that where your from?
Turkey?

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,698
I come from many places.

00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,867
Carlotta your not out here

00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,119
No, no

00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,662
I saw you hand money to him.

00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,706
I wasn't aware you were keeping
money in your room dear.

00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,626
Young man its not right to take
advantage of the elderly,

00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,088
So just give me the money she
gave you.

00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,756
Its his money

00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,801
I don't know what your talking
about its my money.

00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:53,098
Do you want me to call miss
Hanks and put you into a home
for children who steal things?

00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:58,728
Young man you better come back!

00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,399
Go to your room

00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,024
-music-

00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,425
[knock knock]

00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,843

00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:40,312
So you did not forget.

00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,397
Carlotta, what are you doing?

00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,484
I just wanted some fresh air.

00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:53,492
Oh you got plenty of air, just
lay down and go to sleep huh

00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,829
psst, psst.

00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,331
So was that?

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:06,254
The night nurse. she pretends to
check on us while she steals our
desserts.

00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,466
Here.

00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,595
Now you meet me tomorrow at 4,
over by the woods,

00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:18,391
And I will reward you with
halva.

00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:23,897
Tomorrow at 4.

00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:29,528
Its been 2 hours. if you see him
will you let me know?

00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,490
Ok. Never mind he just walked in
the door. Thank you.

00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,825
Where have you been?

00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:36,618
The store on the corner was
closed so...

00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,248
No no! I told you to come
straight back its been 2 hours.

00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,374
Don't worry about me ok.

00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,500
We were worried.

00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,420
Dan's sister and her two girls
were here.

00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,756
We waited dinner as long as we
could.

00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:54,010
Well, you should have gone ahead
and eaten without me

00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,513
I wanted to have dinner
together, you know?

00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,809
Like, like a family.

00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,311
And now Dans gone out looking
for you.

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,360
Is he here?

00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,070
He just got here

00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,447
Cory what are we supposed to do?

00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,659
You don't listen in school, you
don't do your homework and now
you don't come home on time?

00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:23,290
Well how was I supposed to know
you'd be stupid enough not to go
ahead and eat without me?

00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,125
Go to your room.

00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,544
No supper tonight, no television
tomorrow.

00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:28,461
Go on!

00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,214
Go now!

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,479
This is my favorite hideaway.

00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:51,443
This is great.

00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,237
Did miss Sybil see you go into
the woods?

00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,533
She's busy showing some poor
souls children around.

00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,580
Oh everything in life circles in
life and comes back at you

00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,583
I think you mean, what goes
around comes around.

00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:12,130
Children become the parents, and
lock the parents in their rooms.

00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,592
What can miss Sybil do to you
for coming out here?

00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,304
One man calls too frequently for
the bedpan,

00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,725
and now they give him an extra
sleeping pill

00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,103
I only pretend to take their
pills

00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,898
I spit them out later.

00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,150
How did you get stuck in this
place?

00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,653
Weak heart they said

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,073
well, what about your family?

00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,701
I have no family

00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,664
well

00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,626
ill be your family.

00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:21,032
And I will be yours.

00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,717
Hey!

00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,636
Come here you stud muffin.

00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,639
I hate it when you do that.

00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,684
I■ve been waiting for you to get
home.

00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:48,393
Wheres Cory?

00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,561
He's out.

00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,478
Ok lets go.

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,689
Not that silly

00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,190
I wanted to show you something.

00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,442
What?

00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,695
This.

00:28:58,945 --> 00:28:59,696
Whats that?

00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,198
Don't you know?

00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:07,036
Yea, sure this is the perfect
shade of blue for the kitchen.
come on lets go.

00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:12,792
Try the babies room.

00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,419
The what?

00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:19,632
Were pregnant. if it turns blue
were pregnant.

00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,719
Oh my god your blue and I'm
pregnant

00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,430
I mean.

00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,807
Really?

00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:33,188
We did it! We did it!

00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:38,651
I■m sorry, I■m sorry, I■m sorry,
I■m sorry! You got to sit down

00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,987
ok!

00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,824
There■s really... there■s a
baby.

00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,659
Can I listen?

00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,828
You cant hear anything yet!

00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,206
I have a doctors appointment on
Thursday if you want to go.

00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,332
Hell yes!

00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:58,087
Shhh. don't swear in front of
the baby.

00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,090
Hey Cory! How you doing?

00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,509
Hey Cory.

00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,760
Whats up?

00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,806
Hey well um I got my test back

00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,226
85 that■s great, way to go!

00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,770
Let me see that.

00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,689
I sure wish I got marks like
this when I was in school.

00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,775
Let me put this up on the
refrigerator huh.

00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,861
Uh, Cory listen, um.

00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:27,242
Why don't you go upstairs and
check on Mr. T I don't think he
had enough water in his cage.

00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,326
That■s a good idea.

00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,453
Yea, can you do that?

00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,037
Ok.

00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:45,927
Hello, Mr. T.

00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,180
I■m so excited about the baby I
didn■t even think about how Cory
is going to take this.

00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,558
Oh this is really going to throw
him.

00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,351
How should we tell him?

00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,854
Well I've seen it happen.

00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,483
People will adopt a kid, wife
gets pregnant, they have a baby
of their own

00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,362
and they say what heck we'll
send him back to the agency.

00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,699
Ok, lets make it official before
we tell him.

00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,661
Ill call miss hanks in the
morning.

00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,388
I am invincible.

00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:38,396
Your weapons can not touch me.
Nothing can hurt me.

00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:48,656
They can not hurt me.

00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,584
They wont get rid of you

00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:05,757
Michelle thinks your cute

00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:46,923
[knock knock]

00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,258
Carlotta are you awake?

00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:49,968
Carlotta?

00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,103
Cory.

00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,189
I■m running away. I just wanted
to say goodbye.

00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,900
Why are you running away?

00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,612
I heard them say they were
sending me back to the boys
home.

00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,281
This time it will be for
delinquence.

00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,908
I■m not going back there.

00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,284
You cannot go.

00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:19,831
Listen don't try to stop me. ill
get away sooner or later.

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,750
I■m not going where people tell
me to go anymore.

00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,212
That■s the mistake you made.

00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,716
You cannot go alone.

00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:30,967
Why not.

00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,053
Because I'm coming with you.

00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:34,637
You are?

00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,263
Yes.

00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,270
Can you get out of here?

00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:47,483
The door is locked at 8pm, but
the night nurse has the key.

00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:51,988
Only she can open it.

00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:59,078
Now, I need what you call a
diversion

00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,329
[doorbell]

00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,708
Poppa's pizza.

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,459
Who is it?

00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:08,046
Poppas pizza, that'll be 12.50
for your large supreme pizza.

00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,007
No, I didn't order any pizza.

00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:15,136
Are you sure nobody here ordered
this ultimate, super deluxe,

00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,307
Double pepperoni, triple cheese
pizza?

00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:24,020
Did you say double pepperoni?

00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,023
Double pepperoni.

00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:33,529
Uh, oh ok. come on in let me see
it.

00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,323
That'll be 12.50.

00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,659
Young man are you sure someone
ordered that pizza from here?

00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,581
If they had I would of known.
Everybody's on a very restricted
diet.

00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:49,378
Well uh, I guess I could take it
back.

00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:54,592
Or, I could give it to you for
our preferred customer price of
$10.00

00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,760
10.00?

00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,763
No tax.

00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,974
You know you seem a little young
to be doing this kind of thing.

00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:09,982
Yea well that■s what my wife
said once I shaved my beard off.

00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,693
Um ma'am?

00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:17,073
It looks like you might have a
leak back there.

00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,825
What the?

00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:23,412
Ooo, ooo.

00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,126
This is ridiculous, whats going
on around here?

00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:32,213
Hey hey!

00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,798
The doors jammed.

00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:41,097
Hey pizza boy! pizza boy! get me
out of here.

00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,142
Cmon cmon!

00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,101
Woo!

00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:45,685
Yea!

00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,656
Freedom!

00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,118
Hey pizza boy!

00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:13,254
Um 2:45 for Greenville,
Monticello, orangedale and um...

00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,131
Lantonville.

00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,633
Oh lantonville, that should be
far enough.

00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,637
Sometimes it pays to be too
young or too old.

00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,892
Your ticket and my ticket. both
half price.

00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,602
Well how much do I owe you?

00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,021
You have money?

00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,776
$27.00 plus 2.75. Profit on the
pizza.

00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,613
[laughter]

00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,700
Oh that■s good. Oh Cory.

00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:43,451
■ Music ■

00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:13,564
Come on son. better wake grandma
up or you'll miss your stop.

00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,317
Grandma, wake up.

00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:16,984
Grandma, wake up.

00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:17,693
Oh what?

00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,695
Were in Lantonville.

00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,530
Were there?

00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,198
Were here.

00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,200
What did you call me?

00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,826
Bus driver said grandma,

00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,497
So I thought id better call you
grandma.

00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:35,002
That■s a good idea. You must
always call me grandma.

00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:42,426
Whenever we are around people.
That way it will not be
suspicious.

00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,763
What do you think they'll do
when they find out your gone?

00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,392
They'll call the police, and
announce it on television.

00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,688
An elderly woman has wandered
away from the Edgewood nursing
home.

00:37:54,313 --> 00:38:00,361
Last seen she was wearing a blue
nightgown.

00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:06,826
They never think old people can
decide to go someplace. they
just wander off.

00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,287
Suppose they'll figure we went
together?

00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,580
It is not likely.

00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,040
Oh look look.

00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,751
Look Cory a cricket.

00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,630
Its time for us to find a room,
come on.

00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,925
But first,

00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:27,596
Lets find a nice place to eat.

00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:28,931
So what can I get for you?

00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,433
Ill have a cup of coffee please.

00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,267
Cream, sugar?

00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,268
No, just black

00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,395
and uh, Ill have a root beer
please.

00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,064
My grandson will have a glass of
milk

00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,650
I didn't ask for milk, ill have
a root beer.

00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:47,658
A growing boy needs milk. It
would not do for you to get
sick.

00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:52,288
Me and my grandmother will have
two milks.

00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,831
That's two milks? You sure?

00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:58,419
Yea yea, two milks.

00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,386
That■s it! That■s it! That■s it!

00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,096
What are you doing? Sit down!

00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,015
Well you know that halva you
make?

00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,225
We can sell it in restaurants,
and you know make sides just
like...

00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,810
Behind you.

00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:15,978
These!

00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:16,645
Do you think they would buy?

00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,441
Yea sure they would, its great
stuff, but who do you ever see
selling it?

00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,234
We could sell to groceries too.

00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,487
Yea, and I could deliver it to
all the customers.

00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,740
You know, I have many many
recipes from all over the world

00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,659
I have them all right here.

00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:36,040
And maybe we can even have our
own bakery, and we'll name it
after that cricket you saw.

00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:42,630
Here drink up, drink up we have
much to do.

00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,892
It only has one bed.

00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,270
Wait, hold up so it ain■t got
but one bed.

00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,773
Look I could rent you the
rollaway for the boy.

00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,858
Well how much is the rollaway?

00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,153
8 dollars a week. we don't have
no kids here.

00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,824
So we cant have a lot of noise
and no writing on the walls and
such

00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,325
I don't write on walls.

00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,119
No 8 is too much

00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:13,828
ok.

00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,162
Grandma I can sleep on the
floor.

00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,665
How bout I give it to you for 5
dollars a week just.

00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,875
Just as long as you don't go
telling anybody.

00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,461
Well do you have a kitchen and a
bathroom?

00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:30,469
A kitchen and a bathroom to
share, yes ma'am, right down the
hall.

00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,891
How's a person supposed to fix
anything in this kitchen?

00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,726
You're spread out all over the
place!

00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:42,731
You can ask, Eleanor, and we
will move.

00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:49,530
Here! Try some of this! It's
really good stuff.

00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:55,995
Don't take up so much space next
time.

00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,289
You ever have any kids?

00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:58,873
No.

00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,212
So you never had any
grandchildren.

00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,842
No, you must have children to
have grandchildren

00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:17,850
I know how it works, its just I
never knew if I had a
grandmother.

00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:28,694
Whats it like to be old?

00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:34,492
Sybil calls old age golden
years.

00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,869
What a silly thing that is.

00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:41,999
There was nothing golden at that
place

00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:45,461
I call them the black years.

00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:50,633
There■s nothing golden about bed
pans and sleeping pills.

00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,053
But.

00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,973
These days Cory,

00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,476
These days,

00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:05,981
I call golden.

00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,693
May I help you madam?

00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,740
Yea, would you like to order
some of our homemade desserts?
its halva.

00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,617
Very sweet, very delicious.

00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,495
We make all of our desserts here
on the premises.

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,497
We will not be the least bit
interested.

00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,249
Why don't you try some?

00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,793
Madam, please leave.

00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:26,794
Or I shall be forced to...

00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:31,006
To what?

00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,551
Look! there■s a roach! right

00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:34,760

00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,429

00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,598

00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,559
Come on grandma lets get out of
this dump.

00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,561
Its alright, its nothing!
Nothing really.

00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:48,440
Huge rat!

00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,360
Call the exterminator

00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,279
I hate rich people.

00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:58,200
He is a business man. We must
show him this is good business.

00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,287
Then we can do business.

00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:01,996
■ Music ■

00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,842
Well she didn't say no.

00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,553
She did not say yes.

00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:22,766
And no yes is a no.

00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,560
Carlotta, I think I can do this.

00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,769
What?

00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,272
Yea I can do this but I need
your help

00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,232
Cory?

00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:30,899
■ Music ■

00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,092
No!

00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,889
Sir, this is the distinctive
dessert item that you absolutely
must have

00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,558
our customers don't like to try
new things

00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,519
I beg your pardon!

00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:14,693
I have always liked the new and
the exotic.

00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,320
Would you like to try some halva
ma'am?

00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,616
Oh yes, yes I would. Thank you
young man.

00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:26,622
Halva. mmm oh my. Its wonderful.

00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,542
You know I believe the ladies at
the junior league would enjoy
this.

00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,128
We could serve it at our next
tea and.

00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,132
At the males reception. Where
could I get more of this?

00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,594
Um, right here madam. You could
order all you want through us.

00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,388
Wonderful!

00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:46,225
Excuse us.

00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,351
Who makes this?

00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,020
We do. in our own private
bakery.

00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,897
We don't give out locations.

00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,694
See this is a very secret recipe
from the king of halistan
himself.

00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,239
Its been in the family for
generations and generations.

00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,824
How much per pound?

00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,993
Only 11.29.

00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,330
Ill take 6 pounds a day starting
Tuesday.

00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,166
Are you sure you can make
deliveries on time?

00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:19,174
No problem. Pleasure doing
business with you.

00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:33,188
Alright thanks. See you next
week.

00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:53,667
Got five more restaurants signed
up

00:45:54,042 --> 00:46:01,091
28 dollars and 31 cents.

00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,302
You know something is wrong.

00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,595
What?

00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:05,804
There should be more halva,

00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,016
And the bacon is less than there
should be.

00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,393
Well I had two sandwiches for
lunch

00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:15,272
I know about that.

00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,067
What do you smell?

00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,694
Ah ha!

00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,863
Where did that bacon come from?

00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,823
From a pig what do you think?

00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,825
Hm, you stole that from us.

00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,870
Come on who knows who's is what?
You got your stuff all over the
kitchen.

00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,832
You'd know if you bought halva
or a pound of bacon,

00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:39,838
And you saw it had a cricket
stamped on the package that it
was not yours!

00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,760
You know you got some nerve
going around accusing decent
hard working folk old woman.

00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,137
Hey! Who you calling old woman.

00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:52,142
Id like to know why a kid your
age ain■t in school.

00:46:52,768 --> 00:47:00,150
Maybe I should just call the
children officer.

00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,489
You know who that is?

00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:10,118
William Shakespeare. he wrote
plays for the theater

00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:15,499
you know like Romeo and Juliet,
and Hamlet and a Mid Summers
Night Dream.

00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:21,088
Oh look Cory. Look! Look at that
color. Isn't that interesting?

00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,799
Yea, but I just don't get it you
know

00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:31,557
Cory. Cory art is important. now
we must, uh, we must think about
school for you.

00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,476
School? Why do you even bring
that up?

00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:42,192
What kind of a grand mama am I?
I did not even think about
school until that Eleanor witch
brought it up.

00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:47,823
You know I've been too happy
enjoying your company to think
what you need.

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,324
I don't need it, I hate it!

00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:53,495
Now what grade, what grade are
you in?

00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,373
I■m in fourth, I'm really
supposed to be in sixth.

00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,459
Well then that■s where we will
put you, and we will go there
tomorrow.

00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,588
You cant do that! They'll want
my tickets from the other
school.

00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,840
You'll tell them that I taught
you at home.

00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,800
Well then who's going to deliver
the halva, and the bread,

00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,093
and who's going to get us the
new customers.

00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,803
Who's going to do that?

00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,806
You will make the delivery in
the morning before school.

00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,393
And I will tell them your birth
records were lost

00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,395
[sigh]

00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:23,358
I think your taking this
grandmother thing a little bit
too far.

00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,194
Oh I see.

00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:32,326
You, you want to fire me as your
grandmother?

00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:40,334
We are no longer family?

00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,836
No

00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,255
I didn't mean that.

00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:51,011
A grandmother would not let you
run wild!

00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:58,602
If we are family than I must
treat you as family.

00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,147
Well look, look at this. its
wonderful.

00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:10,155
Do you see inside each square is
a different design.

00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,869
There he is right now, go get
him!

00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:19,289

00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,715
Are you alright?

00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:52,632
I■m fine.

00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:59,264
Look I packed some things in a
hurry, but we must move on.

00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,766
So what now?

00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,894
Well we have no money for a bus
ticket...

00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,687
Wait.

00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,148
I have an idea.

00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,274
No, no Cory!

00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,275
Yea, come on!

00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:30,587
Don't do that.

00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,633
Just trust me alright

00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,176
yes!

00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,553
Where did you learn to do that?

00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:43,058
Kenry Heights home for boys.

00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:43,642
Get in!

00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,442
Hey kid, what are you doing by
my truck?

00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,321

nice cars you got here.

00:51:56,696 --> 00:52:00,826

That■s it! Hold on!

00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,865
So what do you think we should
do now?

00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,493
I■m tired we will have to go to
the shelter this time.

00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:29,039
It will be hard. its always hard
to make due with less.

00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:33,168
When you've had more, but we
must try.

00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:33,752

Well I'm looking for a job.

00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,215
What experience have you had?

00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,385
I was with the filo Demetrius
circus.

00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,930
You know, I bought that circus
twelve years ago and to this day
I wish I hadn't.

00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,348
What did you do?

00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:32,560
Well I was with the concessions
and wardrobe and I was a cook.

00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,231
And she was a magician's
assistant and a fortune
teller...

00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,565
Sounds like she did a lot.

00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,110

Cotton candy girl gone. She ran
off with the sugar salesman.

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,715
Oh your kidding.

00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:02,799

00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,342

grandson, Cory

00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:58,725
Cory this is Dingy, the orlds
dizziest clown

00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,977
I haven't used that name for 20
years.

00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,771
I■ve met a few dizzier than me.

00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,150
And besides I'm getting a little
long in the tusk for clowning,

00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:11,112
But I still love it. I teach the
young ones.

00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,031
I■m very pleased to meet you
Cory.

00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,532

00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,451
I didn't even know you had
children.

00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:21,206
Oh well, I kept a few things to
myself.

00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,666
Your grandma was the best
costumer.

00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,462
Oh yes. and I think the most
incredible cook a big top ever
had!

00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:28,463
Lots of paprika!

00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,216
The goulash, middanoodles!

00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,218
Now you going to join us? Yes?

00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,013
Well the boss says he'll give me
a chance at selling concessions.

00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,266
Oh good!

00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,560
There■s someone else here

00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:46,147
I bet he remembers you.

00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,899
Yes? Oh yea.

00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,651

00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,039
Cool, an elephant.

00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:11,047
No, no Cory. This is Annabelle!

00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,597

00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:24,310

00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:29,107

very special, my grandson Cory.

00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:33,903
Hey Lady!

00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,865
Listen I'm going to have someone
introduce you to the
concessioner manager.

00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:42,161
Ok? And as for you, I'm going to
have someone introduce you to
school.

00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,246
School?

00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,625
Yea, and keep your grades up up
I don't want the welfare
department on my neck.

00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:48,543
Ill show him where it is. Ok
fine.

00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:52,088
Italy was the heart of the old
roman empire.

00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:57,385
It was the political and
cultural and economic center of
the world.

00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:04,350
Excuse me miss loralie, but I
brought you a punipal.

01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,728

01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:11,065

of finest and oldest of circus
families.

01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,443
Hi Cory, were very glad to have
you.

01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,361

01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,698

01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,492
Rider? Ok. Is that r-y-d-e-r?

01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,369
R-i-d-e-r.

01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,454
Oh ok.

01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,413
And how old are you?

01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,497
Eleven.

01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,499
What are you going to be doing
in the show?

01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,836
My grandmas selling cotton candy
and stuff.

01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:37,550
Why don't you take a seat right
over there.

01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:40,595
Concession people, ugh.

01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:42,055
Don't let him bother you.

01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,890
He's just a little filled with
himself.

01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,185
Be back for you later. Good
luck!

01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,979
Ok don't forget your oral book
reports are due Friday,

01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:51,981
And you better be working on
your science projects,

01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,275
And don't worry Cory ill help
you get caught up.

01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,236
Don't worry Cory, well teach you
to make the correct change

01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:01,366
Sebastian! That■s enough!

01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,243
We were reading about Italy.
Portia thank you.

01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,996
Begin at the top of the page,
and as she reads

01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,831
I'll point out the geography on
the map

01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,793
Italy is bordered by France, in
the northwest.

01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,630
The Langranian sea and the
Tyrinian sea in the west.

01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,595
Pull it tight.

01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:26,391
Hey Cory! I told you not to get
in anybodys way!

01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:27,892
Whats the matter with you?

01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,185
No boss, he was just helping.

01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,478
No Steve, that's nice of you to
say that

01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,146
but I told him not to get in
anybodys way

01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:33,147
I was just trying to help.

01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,233
Hey, you see that little booth
over there?!

01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,901
You think you can sell some
cotton candy?!

01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:38,903
Cant you give me a job in the
big top?

01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,532
You are going to be the main
cotton candy seller. now go on!

01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:43,866
Alright! Alright!

01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,077
Get those nickels and dimes!

01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:53,793
Oh, you look magnificent. Now
remember, you are part of the
show.

01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:59,215
You are going to sell more
cotton candy than they could
ever imagine.

01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,300
Go, make me proud of you.

01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:01,884
Yea.

01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:41,299
Ladies and Gentleman! Children
of all ages!

01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:48,055
Welcome to the worlds largest
circus under the big top!

01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:56,063
From Mexico, celebrated stars of
the flying trapeze. The Luna
family flyers!

01:02:58,524 --> 01:02:59,025
■ Music ■

01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,072
[applause]

01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:29,096
Ladies and gentleman, aerial
ballet extraordinaire. Lauralie
kunjano

01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:33,559
[applause]

01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:41,567
Presenting, the incredible
bareback riders. Featuring the
amazing Sebastian.

01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:53,412
Hurry up you fool!

01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:15,393
The daring Rodriguez brothers
and their wheel of destiny.

01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,313
Cotton Candy.

01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:27,321
Acrobatic prodigy, eleven year
old, Portia.

01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:38,291
Oh Annabelle! you naughty girl!

01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,296
Don't tell me you sold it all
again so soon!

01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,797
Yea well its not that hard,

01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:48,134
But if this was our halva it'd
sell even better

01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,137
I think it has more to do with
the salesman

01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:53,180
who could say no to you?

01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:57,476
I■m afraid your going to break
many little girls hearts.

01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:00,396
Come on, here you take some of
this

01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,900
Cory, Cory what did you do?

01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,611
There■s twice as much money here
as there should be.

01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:10,072
Well a lot of the customers said
keep the change.

01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,407
Does that mean I can keep it?

01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:16,370
Yes! For your college fund

01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:16,996
[sigh]

01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,464
Cotton candy right here, cotton
candy.

01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:34,513
The children's favorite. Those
lovable k9. Presented by
stephana and company.

01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:51,405
A little clumsy there aren't we
candy boy?

01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,699
No, no no. Not now!

01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:57,203
Get that picked up. come one
Cory. Rod pick that up.

01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:05,211
Mans best friend. most lovable
k9's.

01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:08,923
Are you sure Sebastian did this
on purpose?

01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,050
Yes, I'm absolutely positive.

01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:14,595
Well some people can only think
they are big.

01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,597
If they make some one else feel
small.

01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,393
The world is full of Sebastians,
but things have a way of
working.

01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:24,021
There way around and coming back
to you.

01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:29,735
You mean what goes around comes
around.

01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:32,488
I■ve only got a minute, but I
heard what happened.

01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:36,784
I■m really sorry. Sebastian is
such a jerk.

01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:38,244
Are you alright?

01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,997
Yea, thanks.

01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:44,166
I■ve got to go.

01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:52,174
As they say, what goes around
comes back at you.

01:06:53,259 --> 01:07:00,599
Zacharius, the fastest human on
two wheels.

01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:07,690
Thanks

01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:19,827
[applause]

01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,223
Zacharius!

01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,696
Carlotta, Cory. there is
something I have to tell you
both.

01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:56,864
Uh huh.

01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,409
There is a rumor going around
the grounds.

01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,704
That you two are doing very
well!

01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,041
Oh that■s great dingy!

01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,835
I told the boys to put some
stuff in your place

01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,171
to fix it up a little bit.

01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,090
So does that mean we can stay?

01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,553
Boss says he has no choice.
Concession sales are up 61%.

01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:24,016
Woo! 61%! Woo!

01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:29,772
Oh no stop fooling around! You
have to work on your spelling!

01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:55,923
Grandma?

01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:13,399
Grandma?

01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:36,755
We were so beautiful.

01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,091
Stay, stay.

01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:47,099
Yes dear. you have remembered
everything. Peter John taught
you.

01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:53,689
Do you remember the night that
Peter John and I danced
together.

01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,482
Right here it was.

01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:59,862
The music came from the pier
across the lake.

01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:07,244
It was if they were playing only
for us.

01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:07,995
■ Music ■

01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,923
Thank you, Peter John

01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:08,931
I knew you would come home.

01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,191
Thank you.

01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:42,131
Good good! Keep your hands low,
good!

01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:47,720
That■s the way! good good good!

01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,930
Hey dingy, who's your buddy?

01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,224
This is Cory. he and his
grandmother joined us last week.

01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:53,976
She used to be with us in the
old show.

01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,270
Nice to meet you Cory, I'm Zack.

01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,731
Hey what are you doing with this
no count clown?

01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,818
I am teaching him the ropes
Zack, and he learns real fast.

01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:06,363
Oh yea? Well I might need an
assistant.

01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,866
Listen when I'm done courting
the school mom.

01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:13,329
Ill give you a ride on my Harley
if you help me.

01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:17,499
I■m building something secret
for my new act, what do you
think?

01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,626
Uh yea sure.

01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:21,545
Cool

01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:29,553
[engine revving]

01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:32,765
Ok lets go.

01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:35,100
Good.

01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:37,269
Does Zack like ms Lauralie?

01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:39,146
Well who doesn't?

01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:40,564
But does she like him?

01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,276
Well uh, that■s a matter of
interpretation.

01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,237
You've known my grandmother for
a long time haven't you?

01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:50,866
Oh yes a very long time.

01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:54,203
Well uh, did you know a man
named peter john?

01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:12,596
It was 1944, and peter john and
I were in the same outfit.

01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,600
Our job was to hack a supply
line right through the Burma
jungle.

01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,977
All the way to China.

01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:21,897
Did you ever hear of the lido
road?

01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,399
No

01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:30,197
Peter John, he sold our major on
the idea of using elephants to
clear the way quicker.

01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:33,200
The last time I ever saw Peter
John,

01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:37,996
I led a patrol, and somehow we
stumbled right into the
Japanese.

01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:42,042
We tried to outrun them but
they, they had us backed into a
revene

01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:45,212
and they began picking us off
like sitting ducks

01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:49,591
all of a sudden Cory, the ground
starts shaking.

01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,595
Son of a gun if I don't see a
stampede of elephants

01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,432
ripping right through the
Forrest

01:13:57,224 --> 01:14:02,688
and guess who was sitting on the
back of the head elephant?

01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:04,690
Peter John

01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,151
Peter John.

01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:12,072
Riding that elephant into the
heart of the Japanese camp

01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:17,828
was the last time I ever saw
Peter John.

01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:21,206
So Peter John and my grandmother
never got married.

01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,543
No. Even after the war ended,

01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:28,130
She never could accept the fact
that he was dead.

01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:31,216
She kept working at the circus
day and night.

01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:39,224
Waiting for him to come home,
but Peter John never did.

01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,478
Now don't be looking down there
you'll miss the one down there.

01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:50,486
Now come on, once again! lets
see.

01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:58,785
Hey cor man!

01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:03,207
Miss Lauralie, I was wondering
if I could do my next report on
Burma?

01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,958
Yea that'll be fine.

01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,252
You ready for your ride?

01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:08,212
Sure. I guess.

01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:11,006
Lets go.

01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:16,094
Helmet on dude

01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:24,102
[revving engine]

01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,899
Lauralie, hows the little fellow
doing?

01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:32,903
Well he's doing great, but
there■s something I cant figure
out.

01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:34,613
Whats that?

01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,991
I cant get any legal information
from him or his grandmother.

01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,118
You cant? well you better stick
to it.

01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:44,665
Get some legal information cause
I cant hire a minor that■s
undocumented.

01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:47,459
You know what they'd do to me!?

01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:48,377
Stick to it.

01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:48,961
Alright.

01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:59,972
Cory Wainwright?

01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,598

Are you kidding?

01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:49,706
No, he's got a new act except he
doesn't know it. Come on!

01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,962
Ladies and gentleman, in the
rich grand tradition of the
circus. the bareback riders

01:17:56,421 --> 01:18:00,759
featuring the amazing Sebastian

01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:01,551

01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:16,900

01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:24,908
Put me down you fool! You're
ruining my act!

01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,044
Payback time Sebastian!

01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:36,795

01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:44,136
Oh its just what I told you.

01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:49,015

in the back of the head!

She means what goes around comes

01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:55,772
Will you tell me what idiots is
responsible for this?

01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,358
What are you talking about
idiots? They loved you.

01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,486
You needed a hook, and you found
it tonight.

01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:06,032
Let me tell you something, I
want those responsible for this
fired immediately.

01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,661
Oh you do, do ya? Well you
listen to boss Ed and you listen
good.

01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:13,832
I want every performance from
you the same way every night.

01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:14,499
What?

01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:16,960
Night after night the same way!

01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,015
You did great dude.

01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:29,282
I wonder what Michelle and Dan
are doing right now

01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,993
I wonder what happened to your
turtle.

01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:34,496
Mr T?

01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:37,666
Oh Michelle would have taken
good care of him

01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:43,630
Michelle, she sounds like a good
person. I bet she's worried
about you.

01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:49,010
Yea but what can I do? I mean, I
cant call her

01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:51,304
I think you owe them an
explanation.

01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:53,431
Why do I owe them?

01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,476
I heard them planning to send me
back to the agency.

01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:01,356
They were going to call miss
Hanks that night.

01:21:02,065 --> 01:21:07,904
You and the circus were the only
family I've ever had.

01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:13,243
I■m not going to a deliquencent
home for kids, or even worse
another foster home.

01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,965
Can we talk?

01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,593
Sure

01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:32,345
I found out something about Cory
Rider.

01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:36,808
He signed his paper Cory
Wainwright.

01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:41,646
I■m sure he didn't realize he
had done it.

01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:45,984
But when I got no help from him
or his grandmother on getting
his records

01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,486
I called the state education
records office,

01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:53,825
And I asked them to find eleven
year old Cory Wainwright.

01:21:54,784 --> 01:21:58,622
They came up with this. Its his
complete history up to a year
ago.

01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,625
You■re better than Magnum P.I.

01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:09,257
He's gone from institutions to
foster homes for the last five
years.

01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:13,261
He never stayed anywhere more
than a few months.

01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:21,227
Seems like the only thing
constant in his life is that
nobody wanted him

01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:25,065
Zack...

01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:30,236
At four he witnessed his fathers
death.

01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:38,244
His father was driving a
motorcycle.

01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:46,628
And then a year later his mother
abandoned him.

01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:53,051
He's the kind of kid that
usually gets lost forever.

01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:59,808
You got to give carlotta the
credit, but there■s not mention
of a grandmother in here

01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:03,520
somethings wrong

01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:06,147
I requested an update on the
last twelve months

01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:08,358
and that should give me some
answers.

01:23:08,858 --> 01:23:11,194
He's a natural on a motorcycle.

01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:16,908
That■s why you're so important
to him.

01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,910
So what should I do?

01:23:19,452 --> 01:23:22,789
Just keep on doing what your
doing.

01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:25,125
I■m going to get some
professional advice.

01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,794
This is just way out of my
league.

I■m sorry I left without saying
goodbye

01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:46,104
I found a really great home with
great people

01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:50,567
I hope you are all fine and your
new baby will be fine too.

01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:53,486
Thank you for giving me a good
home.

01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:55,655
Love Cory.

P.S. Please take Mr. T to the
woods.

01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:08,209

to be free.

used to know.

Look I want to tell you Cory,
that your grandmother is.

Well she needs somebody to take
care of her.

She's too old to start something
new and try to work in a circus.

01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:43,693
And Lauralie, she knows about
you being a runaway.

01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:47,864
And if the state ever found out
I hired a run away.

01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:52,410
They would close me down just
like... like that. huh?

01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:54,829
You wouldn't want that, would
ya?

01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:58,750
No

to know this, and your things
too

01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:07,383
and I put them down in a locker
down at the bus station.

01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:15,141
Now you take care of that
because all your things are in
that locker.

this,

But I'll look after you then.

01:37:12,868 --> 01:37:20,376

stronger.

01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:24,547

this.

01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:27,383

You did, I heard you.

01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:08,919
God. no Cory no, we were talking
about me when I was your age.

01:40:09,503 --> 01:40:13,507
I... I was raised in a home for
girls.

01:40:14,216 --> 01:40:18,387
I had lots of foster parents but
I was never adopted.

01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:24,643
And I swore that some day I
would take at least one child
out from all that.

01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:30,983
We wanted you to be that child
Cory. and we still do.

01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:33,861
We want you to be our son.

01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,321
We've been worried sick.

01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:38,782
Dan quit his job to look for
you.

01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:41,285

Can't find another Cory.
