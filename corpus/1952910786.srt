00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,251
<i>Byron!</i>

2
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,645
I don't even like
coming into doctors' offices.

3
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,181
I don't get sick ever.
I don't never get sick.

4
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,681
- You know that.
- Well, thank you for coming with me.

5
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:09,319
You're welcome, honey.
You know I'm always on your side, honey.

6
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,754
I just don't get sick.
I don't never get sick.

7
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,725
You're... You sick, but I don't get sick.
I'm sorry.

8
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,791
- You nervous, honey?
- No.

9
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,626
It's gonna be whatever it's gonna be.

10
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,824
Your mama taught you well, baby.

11
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,430
You got strong faith, Shirley, strong faith.

12
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,799
Hello.

13
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,732
Good God. Lord have mercy.

14
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,807
Good God, he fine.

15
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,000
Doc, I'm sick.

16
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,077
It's in my chest, Doc.
Feel my chest. Come on.

17
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,172
Put your hands on my chest, Doc. Feel me.

18
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,379
Check my chest, Doc, please. I'm...

19
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,517
Aunt Bam. Stop it.

20
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,054
She's cute.

21
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,192
Cute? Cute is for puppies.

22
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:52,194
You mess with me, Doc, I'll have you
somewhere sucking on your thumb,

23
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,129
calling for your mama!

24
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,003
Standing on your left leg,
bowing down on your right,

25
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,197
wondering what I'm gonna do
to you tonight.

26
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,168
Pop, pop, pop it off...

27
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,278
- You married, Doc?
- No, ma'am.

28
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,648
- You straight?
- Aunt Bam...

29
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,880
What? You gotta ask
these questions nowadays, honey.

30
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,156
Will you please wait
out in the waiting room?

31
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,188
- Please?
- I'm embarrassing you?

32
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,559
I'm sorry, baby. I don't mean no harm.
Help me up, Doc.

33
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,531
Just help me up. I gotta bend up like this.

34
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,159
You see, Doc, listen, I don't even get sick.

35
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,431
I don't even like
coming into doctors' offices.

36
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:36,531
'Cause all y'all like to do is just probe
all over people, feeling, touch all of them...

37
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,836
Two, four, six-pack.

38
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,742
Look at that?

39
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,181
What? Sorry.
Okay, and look, look at your little offices.

40
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,050
This is too small in here.
Ain't no room for nobody to turn around.

41
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,816
See, I like to turn it.
When I turn it around I like to...

42
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:53,124
- He's straight.
- Aunt Bam.

43
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,664
Okay. But look here, watch this, watch this.

44
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:02,133
Did you like that? I
know he did, look at him.

45
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,429
- Aunt Bam, go on, now.
- You blushing. Okay, I'm sorry.

46
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,061
And don't you be out there smoking.

47
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,936
You better be worried about
what I'm gonna be out here smoking.

48
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,478
'Cause I'm gonna be out here smoking.
I'm going out here to smoke.

49
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,638
And I like what I'm gonna be smoking.
I like to see my name in puff.

50
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,975
She's something else.

51
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,184
You don't know the half of it.

52
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,056
So tell me, Dr. Evans.

53
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,894
Well, Ms. Shirley,
I hate to be the bearer of bad news.

54
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,762
Just tell me.

55
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,158
The reason you've been short of breath
and having the headaches

56
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,168
is because the cancer is back.

57
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,034
It's much more aggressive this time.
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,600
I've called in a specialist who wants to try
another round of chemotherapy.

59
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,106
Listen, I'm tired.

60
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,648
We've been fighting this thing for, what,
seven years?

61
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,282
I really thought we had it beat.

62
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,111
Don't you look so sad.

63
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:59,481
What I know is that
every day that God gives us is a gift.

64
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,596
And when he stops giving it to me,
then I get to be with him.

65
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,426
So it's all right.

66
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,302
You're an amazing woman, Shirley.

67
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,535
You're always smiling.

68
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,965
Your faith gives me hope.

69
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,200
Well, God bless you.

70
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,606
I'll call and make an appointment. Okay?

71
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,542
Thank you, Doctor.

72
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,910
Good kush, good kush,
good kush, good kush.

73
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,780
Good kush, good kush.

74
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,156
Hey. Christ, praise the Lord.

75
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,418
Good kush.

76
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,590
Baby, I wouldn't go in there.
I wouldn't go in there if I was you, hon.

77
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,669
I told you.

78
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,304
Contact.

79
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,498
She's gonna be right
when she comes out of there.

80
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,404
- Cora. Cora.
- Aunt Bam.

81
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,641
Baby, what are you doing here?

82
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,411
Mr. Brown wasn't feeling well last night.

83
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,509
Well, you know he has diabetes, right?

84
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,849
- He does?
- Yep.

85
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,480
- Lord, that's gonna kill him.
- Don't say that.

86
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,650
- Lord, he's gonna die. He's gonna die.
- He's...

87
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,954
He's not gonna die with that.

88
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,291
- Well, go on back there and see him then.
- Well, all right.

89
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,887
Well, wait a minute now, why are you...

90
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,298
I'm all right, honey, I don't get sick.
I'm here with Shirley. Shirley's back there.

91
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,436
- How is she?
- She's okay.

92
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,130
She's okay. She's got strong faith.

93
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,601
- That's what we need.
- She's got a strong back, too.

94
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,744
That could have made a lot for her
back in the day...

95
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,473
But, she could pull the hell out of a wagon.

96
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,812
- What you... - Yeah. I ain't even...
We didn't need horses.

97
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,778
Shirley was a horse all by herself.

98
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:38,220
She works like a horse,
she treats people nice.

99
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,348
Yeah.

100
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,222
It's just not good to get sick
and you treat people nice.

101
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,227
That just don't ever seem fair to me.

102
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,819
- Well, I...
- But it's okay, I guess,

103
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,899
you know,
the Lord just moves in mysterious ways.

104
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,058
- Yes, he does.
- His wonders to perform.

105
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,966
Yes, well, okay.
I'll talk to you later, all right?

106
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,436
- I'm going to see him.
- Please do, 'cause you...

107
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:56,508
- And I'll call you. Don't call me.
- All right.

108
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,002
'Cause you talks too much is what you do.

109
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,644
What you be saying, though.

110
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,642
Hey, baby. What the doctor say?

111
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,308
It's not good.

112
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,547
Girl, you gonna be all right.
You gonna be all right.

113
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,816
Not this time.
I need you to call all my children.

114
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,721
Okay, well, when we get home,
baby, I'll turn it on for you.

115
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,293
As soon as we get to the house,
<i>All My Children...</i>

116
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,418
Bam.

117
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,293
You know, Bam,
you need to stop smoking all that weed.

118
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,196
Every time you smoke that weed
you act like you crazy.

119
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,700
What are you talking about? You said
you wanted to see <i>All My Children.</i>

120
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,203
I said I was gonna turn it on for you.

121
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,637
I wanna see all my family.

122
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,265
Well, okay, make up your mind, hon.

123
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,640
Do you wanna see <i>All My Children</i>
or you wanna see <i>All in the Family?</i>

124
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:33,803
Which one?

125
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,705
- Bam.
- What?

126
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,976
Come on, let's go catch this
bus before we're too late.

127
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,917
Wait, Shirley, baby,
did the doctor ask for my number?

128
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,745
Did he? Did he ask for my digits?

129
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,046
...come to the hospital?

130
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,556
You just gonna come up here
and bring me like I'm a kid to the hospital.

131
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,685
You got diabetes and you wasn't feeling
well and I brought you to the hospital.

132
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,194
Well, I feel well now. Can we go?

133
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,333
- Good day.
- Good day, Doctor. How you doing?

134
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,025
- Very well, thanks.
- Good, good.

135
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,535
Now, Mr. Brown,
you have to take your insulin.

136
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,627
I've been taking.

137
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:01,934
- Now, are you eating right?
- Yes, sure, I'm eating right. Yes.

138
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,668
No, he doesn't. He's lying.

139
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,505
Cora, ain't nobody...
You don't call me no liar.

140
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,238
I'm your daddy.
You come here, you're gonna sit there

141
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:08,677
and look at my face and call me no liar.

142
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:10,749
- You don't know what I eat.
- I know what he ate.

143
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,444
He ate 10 pieces of bacon,
three eggs, a biscuit

144
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,818
and a pork chop with jelly and orange juice.

145
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,891
Just for your information
that's where you lie,

146
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,620
'cause I don't even eat pork.
I ate ham. Thank you.

147
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,396
See, the problem with a lot of people is
they think diabetes is just a little sugar.

148
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,434
It isn't. Now you have to eat right...

149
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,866
- He don't do that.
- ...you have to exercise.

150
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:33,268
He don't do that.

151
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,141
And let me tell you something, there are
people who have lost their eyesight,

152
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,144
their limbs, and even
died from this disease.

153
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,612
Now you gotta get serious about this,
lose some weight,

154
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,681
...start exercising, or things could
get worse. - Exercise.

155
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,912
Exercising, losing weight...

156
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,689
I am... Doctor, I hear what you...

157
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,814
Are you listening to what he's saying?

158
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,085
Cora, didn't I just say
I hear what he's saying?

159
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,889
Now you're gonna make me whoop you.
Get you some business.

160
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,488
You need to get you a husband,

161
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,225
maybe that'll keep you
out of other people's business.

162
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,733
- You married, Doctor?
- No, sir.

163
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:03,958
Cora ain't married neither.

164
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,095
Why don't you ask her to marry you
and y'all live happily ever after

165
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,365
in a forest or something?

166
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,464
So she can leave me alone,
stay out of my business.

167
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,872
Stay out of my mental function.

168
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,606
What?

169
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,713
Now, Mr. Brown, I've also noticed
you've never had a colonoscopy.

170
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,143
Oh, yes, that's where you're wrong.

171
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,447
I drink colas all the time.
I like colas with ice and everything.

172
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,089
And he shouldn't be drinking colas.
There's too much sugar, isn't there, Doctor?

173
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,050
Cora, you're too much sugar.
Looking like a bag of cotton candy.

174
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,222
Cora is the snack demon.

175
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,025
That's right. I caught her one day
sneaking to get some chips.

176
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,394
Under your bed, I found them chip bags.

177
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:39,128
And she got soda water bags
and cups and everything under her bed.

178
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,638
- You...
- How many Oreos would this be?

179
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,169
- You...
- You know how many it is! Tell me.

180
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,470
- You know how many...
- Five Oreos.

181
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,375
You can tell me 'cause you tried to tell me
the other night.

182
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,538
We're not in here about me...

183
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,015
Mr. Brown, I do have to tell you that
you are well past 40 now.

184
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,516
Way past!

185
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,145
Well, I ain't that much past. You're trying
to make it seem like 40 is down there,

186
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:00,885
and I'm way back... I'm close to 40.
Forty's over there and I'm right there.

187
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,860
You make it seem like I'm old or something.

188
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,726
The point I'm trying to make is that
you should be having

189
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,426
regular colon and prostrate exams.
It could save your life.

190
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:15,698
Okay. You go ahead and check my collasum
and my prostitute. All right?

191
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,503
It's prostate, Mr. Brown.

192
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,703
Cora, I know. It's the same thing.

193
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,007
Just go ahead and just check me.

194
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:26,107
Hold on. I had some of Cora's chips I found

195
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,317
and I might have some on my prostitate.

196
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,045
Go ahead and check.

197
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,684
Not that end, Mr. Brown.

198
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,117
The other end.

199
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,327
You talking about my beginning
and the end?

200
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,056
- Yes!
- The devil is a liar!

201
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,893
You can't be back there like that.

202
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,026
- Wait, Doctor. Wait!
- Get him, Doc.

203
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,662
I'm new! Please!

204
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,735
Hey, Madea.

205
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,340
What the doctor say about Brown?

206
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,640
<i>He's better. He just has to watch</i>
<i>his diabetes, just like you.</i>

207
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,911
Oh, yeah, he got to watch that, honey,
he got to watch that for real.

208
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,987
<i>He's gotta stop eating all that foolishness</i>
<i>and start exercising.</i>

209
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,749
You right.

210
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,715
You right.
I think I'm gonna have the number four.

211
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,451
<i>Welcome to Snax. May I take your order?</i>

212
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,885
Are you at one of those drive-throughs?

213
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,294
Yes, I'm at a drive-through. Hell, I'm
hungry. I'm trying to get some breakfast.

214
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,390
Didn't I just tell you,
you have to start eating healthier?

215
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,492
Cora, hell, I don't wanna hear that.

216
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,731
I know you're probably standing
right next to a vending machine right now.

217
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,470
<i>What you got, a honey bun?</i>

218
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,844
<i>Byron!</i>

219
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,081
Cora, listen, I got to go now.

220
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,810
Girl, I'm driving on the phone. You know
Oprah don't want me driving on the phone.

221
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,477
Goodbye.

222
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,953
<i>I'm upset, or whatever the case may be.</i>

223
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:42,653
I would like to have a ham,
egg and cheese biscuit and orange juice.

224
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,222
<i>Call Day back...</i>
<i>No, you call him on your phone,</i>

225
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,832
<i>I'm gonna keep callin' Byron, but</i>
<i>I'm gonna keep hanging up, answering,</i>

226
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,366
<i>"Nah, nah, nah." Hold on.</i>

227
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,993
- Heller?
- <i>Lady, I hear you. Hold on!</i>

228
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,267
- <i>You better answer that phone or...</i>
- Okay.

229
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,940
All right. The service ain't
what it used to be either, I tell you.

230
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,609
It's Sabrina. Byron...

231
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,384
You need to go on
<i>Maury</i> for him, girl.

232
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,681
For real, dawg.

233
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,092
It's hot as hell in this Cadillac
and I don't have no air conditioner.

234
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,455
What do you wanna eat?

235
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:21,030
I want a ham and egg
and a cheese biscuit, okay? Heller!

236
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,122
We're out of ham.

237
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,428
You out of ham?

238
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,669
Okay. All right. Fine, fine.
Then give me an egg and cheese biscuit.

239
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,197
We're out of egg.

240
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,568
You're out of egg? You're just...

241
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,436
Fine! Then just give me a damn biscuit.

242
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,445
It's 10:31, ma'am,
and we just stopped serving breakfast.

243
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,848
Hold the hell on. I've been sitting here
for 15 minutes waiting on your... No, honey.

244
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:44,820
No, no, no. I don't care. I want breakfast.

245
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,949
You want something else
like lunch or something?

246
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,491
Ain't nobody say nothing about no lunch.

247
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,629
I don't want no lunch. I want breakfast.

248
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,458
- <i>Breakfast ended at 10:30...</i>
- Oh, hell no.

249
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,272
Everybody's all screaming around me
or whatever.

250
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,670
- I don't know what you talkin' about.
- Little girl.

251
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:03,764
What?

252
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:07,039
I'm about to get carbon peroxide poisoning
in this damn car,

253
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,636
waiting on you to get me my damn food.

254
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,214
This Cadillac is old as hell.

255
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,613
Where's my food at, honey?

256
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,481
We're out of egg, we're out of ham,
and we're out of cheese and biscuit.

257
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,850
So can you get out of line, please?

258
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,116
Where's your manager, honey?

259
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:19,984
Look, I am the manager.

260
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,954
Now move!

261
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,117
Move!

262
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,428
You hear these people, it's crazy! For real!

263
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,798
She got crazy.

264
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,802
What the...

265
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,678
Hell, you ain't got no damn sense.

266
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:48,412
I told you I want my damn food.

267
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:49,879
Oh, my God!

268
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,052
I'm taking everything you got.

269
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,683
You act like you ain't got no sense...

270
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,523
Lady, what is wrong with you?

271
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,629
- Oh, my God!
- What the hell's wrong with you?

272
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,767
You're gonna videotape me?
You're gonna videotape me?

273
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,335
I'm taking it out.

274
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,838
I'm trying to be patient, I don't
know what the hell's wrong with y'all.

275
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,241
Old people, y'all act like
y'all ain't got no sense...

276
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,108
- I'm takin' some food...
- Where you at?

277
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,377
...and I'm feeding my fat-ass daughter and
everybody else and see how you like that.

278
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,076
You ain't seen nothing.

279
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,586
I can't wait for you. If you lookin' for me,
my name is Cora Simmons.

280
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,579
...one, two.

281
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,682
I called everybody.

282
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,613
- Good!
- Yep.

283
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,011
You scared, Shirley?

284
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,518
Ain't no room for fear
when you're this tired.

285
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,720
Bam,

286
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,159
I don't want nobody screaming
at my funeral.

287
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,235
- Shirley. I don't wanna talk about...
- Come on now.

288
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:13,794
Listen to me. I can't
tell this to my children.

289
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:18,775
I want Reverend Jackson
to give an uplifting sermon.

290
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,876
And I don't want you to let my children
fight about anything.

291
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:26,279
And I want Sister Laura
to sing that song I like,

292
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,844
"Heaven's Waiting for Me."

293
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,385
Will you do that for me?

294
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,250
Yes, I will, baby,

295
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:36,351
but Shirley,
you're probably gonna outlive us all.

296
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,163
Only God knows.

297
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,622
Well, just in case you do,

298
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,503
...when I die, I don't want no flowers.
- No?

299
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:49,597
No, I don't want no flowers.
I want y'all to plant marijuana stalks

300
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,006
all around my grave.

301
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,068
- I knew I'd make you smile.
- Go!

302
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,343
Instead of pouring some for the homies,
like the young folks there,

303
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,217
I want y'all to have a
puff, puff, pass, repass.

304
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:07,622
Just pass them all out. Just pass them.
I wanna say, "Puff, puff, pass, repass."

305
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,794
Put that down!

306
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,090
- I love to hear you laugh.
- God gonna get you.

307
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,960
- No. I...
- Puff, puff, pass...

308
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,134
- I want you to start it off. - All that
noise goin' on in here. Hey, Mama.

309
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,731
- Hey. Hi, honey.
- Hi.

310
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,106
Give me little Byron.
Come here, little Byron.

311
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,475
- Go to Aunt Bam.
- Byron.

312
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,415
Take little Byron. Take that baby.

313
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,711
Smell like a grown man
did it in that diaper.

314
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,980
- Change that baby's diaper.
- Please.

315
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,689
- Get that off of me.
- Okay, Mama.

316
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,791
Let's go upstairs
and change you then, huh?

317
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,454
Get you fresh. Baby, can you hand me
a diaper out the bag?

318
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,728
I am not the nanny. Here.

319
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,666
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

320
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,903
All right, Mama. I'm gonna go change him.

321
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,837
Don't you think
you need to be going with him somewhere?

322
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,638
Why? That is not my baby.

323
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,276
I don't like you.

324
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,310
- Excuse me?
- I said I don't like you.

325
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,544
- So?
- Bam, the baby is here.

326
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,916
Well, then I tell you what,
let's do a nursery rhyme for the baby.

327
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,690
<i>Row, row, row your ho</i>
<i>Up and down the street</i>

328
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:23,859
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily</i>
<i>She's just a piece of meat</i>

329
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,364
Whatever!

330
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,495
That's what I don't like about her.
That's why I get high.

331
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,903
That's why I have to stay high.

332
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,001
Tell me again why we're here.

333
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,540
Listen, my mother wanted
all of us to come over, okay?

334
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,809
I have better things to do
than sit at your mama's house.

335
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,650
I mean, I don't know what's worse,
the baby poop or the smell of moth balls,

336
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:42,879
or that Bam thing.

337
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,785
Listen, baby, will you...

338
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,790
Will you please let me just find out
what's going on first?

339
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,519
After that I will take you home.

340
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,993
How are you gonna take me home?
You ain't got no car.

341
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,688
Every time I come over here,
it's some drama.

342
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,765
You remember your apartment
and your Benz?

343
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,700
Don't you miss it?

344
00:18:59,204 --> 00:19:02,537
Yeah. Yeah.
Just like I miss going to jail, right?

345
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,071
And wasn't I right there by your side?

346
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,804
You? But you wasn't in there.

347
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:12,049
All you gotta do is make one little drop
and get us enough money to get a place.

348
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,619
Instead of spending the night
at my sister's house

349
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,816
and me sneaking up here in your mama's
house in the middle of the night.

350
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,752
Come on, Byron, don't you wanna be
alone with me in our own place?

351
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,122
It's just one drop.

352
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,357
Listen, stop talking about that
kind of stuff around my son.

353
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,464
Boy, he don't know what I'm saying.

354
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,538
- Renee.
- What?

355
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,901
You are not gonna get caught.

356
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,710
Roscoe said you were one of his best guys
when you were slinging.

357
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,801
Come on, Byron.
See, when I first met you, you had heart.

358
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,071
Look, and I got heart!

359
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,582
And I also got a job, too.
And that's enough for us right now.

360
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:47,876
I'm out of the game.

361
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:52,353
Look, I love you, Byron, I really do,
but that little 10 an hour you're making

362
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,721
is not taking care of me or you.

363
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,755
I don't wanna talk about this no more.
Okay?

364
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,730
Okay. Fine.

365
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,901
I told you to go right and you go left.

366
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,439
- Okay.
- I can't stand you sometimes, Harold.

367
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,272
Had you did what I told you to do
we would have been here 15 minutes ago.

368
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,676
- Yeah...
- I told you this boy has to pee.

369
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,408
- Yeah, but he's all right.
- What up, people? What up, Bam?

370
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:18,778
- I wanna go to the bathroom.
- Hey, baby.

371
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,250
You know where the bathroom is, boy.
Come on.

372
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:25,551
Wait a minute, that boy is 10 years old
and y'all still taking him to the bathroom?

373
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,625
I told her to stop babying these kids.

374
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,789
What did you say, Harold?

375
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,329
He said he told you
to stop babying these children.

376
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,523
I did not say...

377
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,657
- Shut up, you did.
- I didn't say that...

378
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:38,167
- Hey, Tammy.
- Why would you... You're a tattletale.

379
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,303
- Calvin!
- Hey, Shirley, how are you?

380
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,431
- Where is Kimberly?
- You know your daughter, she's working,

381
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,100
...but she'll be here.
- Oh, well.

382
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,802
- Harold.
- Shirley.

383
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,678
It's so good to see my two fine son-in-laws!

384
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,080
- Yes, ma'am. - Wait a minute,
I only see one fine one, hon.

385
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,650
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Aunt Bam.

386
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,550
Child, I don't smoke that much, shut up.

387
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,417
Don't turn that...
Don't... Leave that alone.

388
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,617
Now...

389
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,987
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

390
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,359
You didn't hear me say don't touch?

391
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,932
Harold, you better get your child.

392
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,399
H.J., stop that now,
you see grown folks talking now.

393
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,461
Punk-ass.

394
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,065
See this? Look at this right here.
I tell you what...

395
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,335
- Bam, don't kill him! Don't kill him!
- Sit down.

396
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:19,768
Touch it again.

397
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,607
Don't kill him, Aunt Bam!

398
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,240
Look, Harold can let that child act like
he wants to if they want to.

399
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,051
Oh, I got another one, honey.

400
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,949
Touch it again. Touch it.

401
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,921
Touch it, Shaka Zulu. Touch it.

402
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,118
- Harold, you don't see this?
- He's just a kid.

403
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,787
- You know these new kids, they do...
- Shut up!

404
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,392
He's a kid that needs to know
who the parents are, Harold.

405
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,125
What do you expect, Aunt Bam?

406
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,471
They let these kids run around
like they have no home training at all.

407
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,631
That's why I don't allow my son
around these children.

408
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:50,765
Baby...

409
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,803
- What did she just say?
- Tammy, calm down.

410
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:57,848
She said she don't want her children
around your children

411
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,143
'cause your children act like fools.

412
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,617
They look like fools, they dress like fools.

413
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,515
- Look at them, they're just foolish.
- Thank you.

414
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,613
I know you're not talking about my children.

415
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,555
My boys that I'm raising?

416
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,094
She punked you. You look like a sucker.

417
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,491
See?

418
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,827
This is why I didn't even wanna
come over here to begin with.

419
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,867
Girl, you barely spend time
with Mama anyway.

420
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,367
Being here ain't gonna kill you.

421
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,233
Come on, girls, now calm down.

422
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,931
Why are y'all
blowing up my phone up anyway?

423
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,304
Wait a minute,
your mama told me to call y'all over here.

424
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,146
- For what?
- I just wanted to see you, that's all.

425
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,373
Mama, you know I got things to do.

426
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,446
Well, at least stay
and have dinner with me. Please?

427
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,080
- Please?
- In the middle of the week?

428
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,849
It's bad enough we do this on Sundays.

429
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,923
Princess,

430
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,826
when was the last Sunday
that you came over here not to eat with us?

431
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,068
I'm sorry, I must not have been here.
What year was that?

432
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,665
You don't remember either, do you?
That's it.

433
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,396
Mama, I don't like you begging her.

434
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,068
Come on in the kitchen
and help me get this food together,

435
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,611
I need somebody to go into the garage
and get the ice.

436
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,772
- Me.
- I'll do it.

437
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,844
Hey. Hey, wait for me.
Don't y'all leave me...

438
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,413
What am I supposed to do with it?

439
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,590
I don't know, hold it?

440
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,860
Sit... Don't play with me.

441
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:20,458
Sit down, baby, and hold the baby
over there. They'll be back, trick.

442
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,264
- What?
- You heard what I said, broad.

443
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,392
I don't stutter.

444
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,297
Touch the TV. Touch it!

445
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,143
I don't like none of you.
You make me sick, all y'all.

446
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,347
- Man, I'm so glad to be out of the house.
- Got it, Calvin?

447
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:38,846
- Ain't that right?
- I'll tell you what,

448
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,983
this ice is warmer
than your sister Tammy any day.

449
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,386
Hey, hey, hey. You better calm down.

450
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,785
Look, man,
I know it's your sister and I'm sorry,

451
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,862
but sometimes, man, she makes me so...

452
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,995
You better be quiet.
You know she can hear you.

453
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,867
Y'all be playing, but she can
really hear like that. I mean, like a dog.

454
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,038
What is wrong with your sisters, Byron?

455
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,199
Man, what is wrong with women period?

456
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,970
Sabrina, for instance, right?

457
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:09,112
Man, that girl know
I only make $1,000 a month.

458
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:10,875
And I still send her 300.

459
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,916
- Three hundred?
- Man, the girl still ain't satisfied.

460
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,145
As soon as I give her the money
you know what she wants to tell me?

461
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,721
- What she say?
- "Wait a minute! Hold up!

462
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,116
"Hold up! That ain't enough!"

463
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:23,785
Got the weave and all.
"That ain't enough! I need more!"

464
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,398
- So you know what I do?
- What do you do?

465
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,966
I give her more.

466
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,326
But then, look, the next time I see her
she's in some new clothes.

467
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,197
Why don't you just start buying
the baby stuff and give it to her yourself?

468
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,274
I tried that. All she do
is take the clothes back and get the money.

469
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:39,532
- What?
- Yeah.

470
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,545
No, no, young buck.
You got to take the tags off the clothes.

471
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,309
What, did you think I didn't do that?
I did that, too.

472
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:49,079
Then she takes the clothes and tries to
sell them to everybody in the neighborhood.

473
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,554
I am telling y'all, man, she's crazy.

474
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:58,088
I just... I just want my son to know
that I'm out here doing the right thing.

475
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,062
But she's telling everybody
something different, you know?

476
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,630
Man, what am I supposed to do?

477
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,802
You got to keep Peter in the gate,
you understand me?

478
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,439
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.
I know you ain't talking.

479
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,267
Yeah, you ought to think about
that next time you and Tammy

480
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,710
decide to have some more
of them little demon seeds y'all got.

481
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,810
- Demon seeds?
- Yeah, you.

482
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,144
My kids ain't bad like that.

483
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:23,051
Look, man, your kids are out of control.
You got to do better.

484
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:26,285
Well, she won't let me discipline them.
She won't!

485
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,359
And after a while I just stopped.

486
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:33,093
Look, I don't know what's wrong with her.
We argue all the time,

487
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,927
every time I turn around,
I was trying to do something,

488
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,125
she's just driving me crazy!

489
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,929
I'm dealing with the same thing
with Kimberly.

490
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,903
She's always mad.
I don't know what to do with her.

491
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:43,839
And it seems like the longer
that we're married, the worse it gets.

492
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,502
You know what, maybe her and Tammy are
going through menopause or something.

493
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,512
No, it ain't no menopause. Tammy...
Tammy...

494
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,841
Tammy was like that when we first met.
Yeah.

495
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,850
As soon as we got together
she was yelling at me.

496
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,112
Wow.

497
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,915
- What?
- And you still married her.

498
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,152
Yeah. But it's worse now.

499
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:04,528
'Cause now she won't look at me, I can't
touch her, I can't even come near her,

500
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,995
and we ain't had sex in over a year.

501
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,588
Oh, Lord Jesus, please kill the visuals.

502
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,625
I'm bound up.

503
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,928
Why do it sound like
both of y'all in prison?

504
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,168
I'd get more love in prison.

505
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:19,968
Coming home to a house that you're paying
for, and there's no peace, is prison.

506
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,410
I don't know
how much longer I can take this.

507
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,241
- So what are you saying, man?
- Something's got to give.

508
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,178
- Well, do you love my sister?
- Yeah.

509
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,380
- All right, man.
- Sometimes that's not enough, Byron.

510
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:36,758
I hear you on that, but, dawg,
you ain't got but six years in.

511
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,455
Next week it will be 17 years for us.

512
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,524
- You know what, something's got to give.
- Yeah.

513
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,794
- You know, we need to hang out more.
- We need to talk on the phone

514
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,805
...and support group or something.
- We need to go to a strip club.

515
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,431
Wait, wait, wait, now,
hold up, hold up, hold up.

516
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,337
Before y'all both go jumping
into the deep end,

517
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,137
I know my sisters, all right?

518
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:57,305
All y'all got to do is just
do something nice for them.

519
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:02,350
Calvin, why did you take Kim
to one of them fly spots, man?

520
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,854
Nice restaurant, let her relax a little bit.

521
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,151
And Harold, find my sister a nice
anniversary gift or something like that.

522
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,529
Anniversary gift?
Like what? What you think, though?

523
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,193
I don't know. Some flowers, something.

524
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,195
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna try that.

525
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,866
I can't believe
I'm taking advice from an 18-year-old.

526
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,633
Hey, hey, I know something
about them ladies. You see how I do.

527
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,774
I got two fighting over me right now.

528
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,671
Yes, you do.

529
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,074
Hey, y'all smell that?

530
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,748
That's weed.

531
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,522
Aunt Bam. What are you doing?

532
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,452
Yes.

533
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:47,420
What? I'm hunting wabbits.
What the hell y'all think I'm doing?

534
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,157
- Byron?
- Yes, ma'am.

535
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:52,598
I think your baby mama's about to kill
your girlfriend.

536
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,600
What? Baby mama?

537
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,264
Yeah. Sounds like she got her
in a choke hold.

538
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,001
- All right, Byron, you better get...
- No...

539
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,010
- No, no, no, no!
- Byron.

540
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,808
Byron, how you gonna disrespect me by
having one of your tricks holding my baby?

541
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,351
Listen, we ain't together, okay?

542
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,943
You know what, where my money at, Byron?

543
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,391
Who are you calling a trick, retard?

544
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,794
Byron, you told her
about my IQ test scores?

545
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:19,022
For real? That's how you feel it?

546
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,996
- What are you talking about?
- You make me sick.

547
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,692
You so ugly with your yellow self,

548
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,167
and you, start with me.

549
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,437
Go ahead, start with me. Jump, frog, jump.

550
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,708
You know what, Shirley, I know
you wanted me to come to this dinner,

551
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,406
but I really can't do this. I can't have
my baby around this trash, I got to go.

552
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,641
I really wanted you to stay for dinner.

553
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:39,972
Mama?

554
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:43,680
No, Ms. Shirley, no. No, ma'am,
no ham, no turkey. Just let me go.

555
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,450
I already had a rough day at work
with some crazy old woman

556
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,685
that needs to be in jail, for real, though.

557
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:52,285
Speaking of jail,
I hear you're back on the streets, Byron.

558
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:53,890
- What?
- Selling dope.

559
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,295
You know what I'm talking about.

560
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,867
I wish.

561
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,402
Mama, she's lying.

562
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,838
Well, then the whole block is lying,
Ms. Shirley.

563
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:04,100
Don't listen to her, okay?

564
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,706
Look, she just wants you to be mad at me,
that's all.

565
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,312
I just wanna know if I can get a dime bag.

566
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,007
Oh, God, I got to check on my biscuits,
see if my...

567
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,482
Oh, my God, what I got a lie for, Byron?

568
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,348
Stop. Stop. Stop.

569
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,920
Girl... I swear to God!

570
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:23,988
Keep playing with me.
I'll have 5-O on your ass in 2.5 seconds.

571
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,491
I want my money.

572
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,292
How are you gonna give
this chick all this money

573
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,765
but you can't even give me
$300 for your son?

574
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,496
You're a trifling ass father, Byron.

575
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,299
- Stop. Stop it.
- You was a trifling ass father, Byron.

576
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,305
Listen. Hey, hey, hey.

577
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,773
Hey. Shut up! Be quiet!

578
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,640
Listen.

579
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,213
- Shut the hell up.
- Please, thank you.

580
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,777
You know I give you money every month.

581
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:49,479
Oh, my God, I'm so happy that I got
this little job at this little burger joint,

582
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,417
because it looks like I'm gonna have to be
the man of this relationship, too.

583
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:56,358
We? Us? We ain't in no relationship. At all.

584
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,320
Never. Ever.

585
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,794
Boy, you know you want all this,

586
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,297
this almondy stuff.

587
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,093
Listen, can I get that dime bag, though?

588
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,061
- Aunt Bam...
- Oh, my God.

589
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,934
I gotta get out of here. Let me go.

590
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,902
Come on. Your father don't want you.
But it's all right.

591
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,669
We're gonna be all right. Excuse me.

592
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,879
- "Father," with a "V"?
- Yeah.

593
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,437
- "Faver," mother...
- Watch your mouth.

594
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,347
- Excuse me.
- Okay. Keep it walking.

595
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:30,925
I did the best I could to raise you
and you're gonna do this again?

596
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,154
Mama, the girl is lying.

597
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,261
You are gonna go back to jail.

598
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,263
What is wrong with you, boy?

599
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,065
- Ever since your father died...
- Look, Mama, she's lying.

600
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,341
Look, if you don't believe me,
then I might as well go out here and do it.

601
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:47,741
That's if you believe her.

602
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,211
Mama, I'm not selling no dope.

603
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,709
Mama, look at me.

604
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,578
I'm not doing nothing.

605
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,045
I wouldn't keep no secrets from you.

606
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,821
Just like you wouldn't
keep no secrets from me.

607
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,928
I get it.

608
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,894
You can believe it if you want to.

609
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,436
Renee!

610
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,167
We out.

611
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,535
Shirley, look, look, look.
Look, look, look, look.

612
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:21,771
Quick, look, look, look.

613
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,278
Mother, we're leaving, too.
I have to pick up my son from daycare.

614
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,318
Mama wants to have dinner with you.
I don't get...

615
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,444
You have dinner with her.

616
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,149
I'm sure there's enough for you
and your herd.

617
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,758
Girl, I will stump a mud hole

618
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,089
...in your skinny, bougie...
- A mud...

619
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,490
- Honey...
- Don't touch me, Calvin.

620
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,968
I'm sorry, Ms. Shirley. See ya.

621
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,339
- Aunt Bam.
- All right.

622
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,704
Jiggle, jiggle, pull 'em apart.

623
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,706
You ain't had that happen in a long time,
have you?

624
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,337
No, but... Tammy.

625
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,343
Bye, Calvin.

626
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,782
I feel sorry for you
that you have to go home with that.

627
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,350
What's a mud hole? What is it?

628
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:05,816
Aunt Bam, you're too high.

629
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,755
I would love to see that, I tell you.

630
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,888
Harold, H.J., Will, come on.

631
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,487
Well, that went nice.

632
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,159
When am I gonna tell them
with them behaving that way?

633
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,930
Shirley, listen, I don't know,
we'll figure something out, baby, please.

634
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:22,529
But I want 'em all
together so I can tell 'em.

635
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,699
You're gonna ruin my high, honey.
You're gonna ruin it. You're gonna ruin it.

636
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,004
I know you wanna tell 'em.

637
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,579
Hey, y'all, Mama wants y'all...
She's gonna tell y'all something.

638
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,149
Bam, you need to stop all that smoking.

639
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,217
You need to smoke something.

640
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,716
<i>We've been arguing...</i>

641
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,255
- <i>Shut the hell up.</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

642
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:45,990
<i>Now wait a second. All right? All right?</i>
<i>Okay. All of you be quiet.</i>

643
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,731
<i>Because I can tell the truth right here.</i>

644
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,334
<i>We've got the results right here.</i>

645
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:55,563
<i>Okay.</i>

646
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,536
<i>In the case of Baby DeShawn,</i>

647
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,546
<i>neither of you are the father.</i>

648
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:07,479
Lord, I knowed it, I knowed it.
I knowed that wasn't the daddy.

649
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,652
Mabel, get your big ass out the way.
You know it's fit for television.

650
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:14,054
That is trifling as hell.
How the hell she had all of them men

651
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,592
if she don't even know
who the baby daddy is?

652
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,060
Yeah.
You know who that remind me of? You.

653
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,161
You know you was a ho back in the day.
Yes, indeed.

654
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,759
But you know, look here, that boy,
he didn't even know that wasn't his baby.

655
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,532
Been paying child support 18 years.

656
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,766
Giving, two, three, four hundred dollars.

657
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,000
Four hundred dollars
he's giving that girl a month.

658
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,778
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna start a company.

659
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,974
For every baby daddy who has been through
some trouble with baby mamas.

660
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,886
I'm gonna call it, "1-800-Choke-That-Ho."

661
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:46,450
How about 1-800-Choke-That-Ho?

662
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,282
That's a rap song, Mabel.

663
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,290
1-800-Choke-That-Ho.

664
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,052
Joe, shut up. Just shut up.

665
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,289
Mabel!

666
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:57,698
Mabel! Mabel! Mabel! Mabel!

667
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,633
I'm right here, jackass!

668
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:02,934
Mabel, I went to the doctor,
and they say I'm dying.

669
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,631
Mr. Brown, you are not dying.

670
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,710
You had a colonoscopy
and they found a growth

671
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,506
and they wanted to
remove it and do a biopsy.

672
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,443
See, they wanna do a biopsy on me.
That means I'm dying.

673
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:12,738
They found a growth?

674
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,111
- Yes.
- Yes.

675
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,152
You had to go to the
doctor to find that out?

676
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,245
Hell, I'm looking at a growth
coming out of your shoes.

677
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,056
That's a good one, Mabel.
I see the growth, too.

678
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,594
Y'all laughing, but I
think I got the cancer.

679
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,129
You are the cancer!

680
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,998
Mabel, can you do something for me, baby?

681
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,759
- Yes. Yes.
- Do one thing for me.

682
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,698
Can you just hold me one more time?

683
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,298
- Madea! Madea!
- I can't see.

684
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,501
Don't get up on me, touching me like that.

685
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,134
You didn't have to do that, Madea.

686
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,009
Mabel, you got big old man hands.

687
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,407
And you don't have a big old man nothing.

688
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,178
That's a good one, baby.

689
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,318
You on a roll, girl. You on a roll.

690
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,088
What did the veterinarian say?

691
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,722
That girl said "the vet." She say "the vet."

692
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:01,060
You is funny. You are the next Lenny Bruce.
You funny. You funny.

693
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,189
Madea, that is not funny.

694
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,461
What did the veterinarian say?
I'm sorry. Okay.

695
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,663
It's not funny.
Y'all laughing, but I think I see the light.

696
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,403
I see the light, too.

697
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,872
Hell, all them colors you got on,
you are the light.

698
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,940
Taste the rainbow.
You look like a pack of Skittles.

699
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,906
MC Lyte, Crayola light,

700
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,915
Budweiser Light, jackass light.

701
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,045
I know, I know it wasn't good, but I got it.

702
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,852
Madea, Uncle Joe, don't do that.
That is not nice.

703
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,223
Just say something nice to him for once.

704
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,820
I will say something nice to him for once.

705
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,826
Something nice to you for once.

706
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:37,264
Madea!

707
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,800
When I'm gone, they'll appreciate me.

708
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,936
All right, don't even worry about it.
You gonna be all right. You gonna be...

709
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,506
- I am?
- Yes, Brown.

710
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:47,704
Lots of people done had
to have colonoscopies.

711
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,006
You're supposed to get that done

712
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,410
when you get to be a certain age, anyway.

713
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:51,504
You're gonna be all right.

714
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,844
It's good to get your rooter checked.

715
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,510
That's all right, Brown. That's all right,
Brown. You're gonna be fine.

716
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,485
All dogs go to heaven.

717
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,684
So, I know they have room for silverbacks.

718
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:05,560
That is so mean, Uncle Joe.

719
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,556
Funny.

720
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,928
- Madea.
- He is silverback, too.

721
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,797
He's just...

722
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,873
Hey, y'all. Joe! Madea, Mabel.

723
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,408
Hey, Bam.

724
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,736
Hey, Cora. Hey, Brown.

725
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,274
Hey, Bam.

726
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,177
Bam, did they tell you I'm dying?

727
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,845
That's good to hear.

728
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,182
- What?
- Aunt Bam, he said he's dying.

729
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:31,712
Oh, sorry.

730
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,685
Help me.

731
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,964
What brings you by here, honey?

732
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,532
Shirley and her kids.

733
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:45,994
How's she doing?

734
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,634
Not good. Not good at all.

735
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,907
Help me. Help me.

736
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,269
You need to help her with her kids.

737
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,780
- No, child. No, no, no.
- They out of control.

738
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:01,482
I don't know why folks
wanna run to the elders

739
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,110
after their children get out of control,

740
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,486
when the elders be telling them all along
y'all need to get these children straight.

741
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,458
Now that they're grown and out of control,
they want some help from us.

742
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,791
I'm sorry, honey. We have
two different styles of raising children.

743
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,762
She like to pray, I like to punch.

744
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,730
We can't do that.
She's my favorite niece and all,

745
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,734
but no, child,
I'm not fittin' to get into that. No.

746
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,264
Help me.

747
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:24,641
Abort, abort. Evacuate. Abort, evacuate.

748
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,369
- What?
- Mabel, she needs your help, honey.

749
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,604
Can't nobody bring
a family together like you can.

750
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,077
And can't nobody eat a steak like you can.

751
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:37,547
And can't nobody do me like Jesus.
Help me. Help me.

752
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,756
Help me. Help me, please.
Somebody. Somebody, anybody...

753
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,622
- Joe, what's wrong with you?
- Somebody help me.

754
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,628
What is wrong with you, fool?

755
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,819
Y'all don't hear that?

756
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,493
- Hear what?
- Hear what?

757
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,267
That's the floor. It's talking. Listen.

758
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,938
Help me.

759
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:59,237
It's saying that 'cause it got all y'all
big asses standing on that floor.

760
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,481
- That's them.
- Joe.

761
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,348
It's the truth.
Them floor joints is screaming...

762
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,282
- They're screaming like...
- Shut the hell up, Joe, shut up.

763
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,888
Don't shake like that, Mabel.

764
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,687
Hell, all that cellulite,
and look like you got hail damage

765
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,921
all over your legs when you shake.
Don't do that.

766
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,255
These stretch marks
is a road map to heaven.

767
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:25,233
You follow this GPS, it's gonna take you
somewhere you ain't never been before.

768
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,572
Your stretch marks about to make me...
I got to throw up.

769
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,741
You about to throw up
that cancer in your back.

770
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,367
Get it all out, get it
all out, let him use you.

771
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,638
Mabel, please. Please help Shirley.

772
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,081
Does Shirley know you're over here?

773
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:42,618
Well, she'll be fine with it.

774
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,111
She'll be fine with it.

775
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,018
Give me all their addresses and I will
go by there and try to help them.

776
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:48,915
Thank you. Yes!

777
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,052
- You ain't gonna hold me...
- Just shut the hell up!

778
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,425
What the hell's wrong with you, Brown?

779
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,931
Talking about somebody...
Don't nobody wanna hold you here.

780
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,933
Your mama didn't even wanna hold you
when you was born.

781
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,094
I don't know what the hell
you always got something.

782
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,069
You working on my damn nerves.

783
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,134
Heller?

784
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,569
Hold on. Joe, your bookie on the phone.

785
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:11,214
I'll be damned if I come up in there
on that floor.

786
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,146
That floor getting ready to cave in.

787
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,084
The termites are saying, "Evacuate, run.
Everybody, man your battle stations.

788
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,122
"Get out, get out. It's..."

789
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,084
Come get the phone.

790
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:25,693
Whoever that is, they're gonna have
to call me back, 'cause I ain't stupid.

791
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,128
If I walk up in there,
that floor is gonna just go.

792
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,631
'Cause I'm the feather
that will break the camel's back,

793
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,929
'cause y'all killing that camel.

794
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,696
All them joints is about to snap.

795
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:37,740
The termites getting ready to run
from out of here, they're saying,

796
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,208
"Evacuate! Abort! Abort!"

797
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,844
The termites screaming, "Abort, abort!

798
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,580
"Because these fat asses are gonna fall
through the roof."

799
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,985
- What?
- Shut up, fool. Shut up.

800
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,912
Shut up.

801
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,991
How's it looking, Doctor?

802
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,654
I'm sorry.

803
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,197
No need to be sorry.

804
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,128
Is there anything I can do?

805
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,061
How long do I have?

806
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,165
Four, maybe six weeks.

807
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,176
And if we continue with the chemo,
maybe longer.

808
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,481
Well, thank God for the days I have had.

809
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,885
You're the most amazing patient
I've ever had, Ms. Shirley.

810
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:27,583
Always smiling.
Always seeing the bright side.

811
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:31,027
Well, living for God is the bright side.

812
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:35,028
And, Doctor,
God bless you for all your help.

813
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,834
I brought you these brownies.
Bam loves these.

814
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,095
Thank you.

815
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,697
And don't be so sad.

816
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,734
I'm going to be fine.

817
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,812
Calvin, I asked you to watch him.

818
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:53,249
C.J., why would you drop that
when I told you not to?

819
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,045
Don't do that again, okay?

820
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:58,144
No more. Play with this. Here.

821
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:01,224
C.J., are you okay? Are you okay?
You gonna be all right.

822
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,589
Don't baby him while I'm talking to him.
He needs to learn.

823
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,162
To learn what? He's 18 months, Kimberly.

824
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,596
- I hate it when you do that,
Calvin, I hate it. - He's a baby.

825
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,600
And he's gonna end up
just like Tammy's kids.

826
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,670
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

827
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,167
You show me no respect,
do you know that? None.

828
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,237
Babe, listen, I do show you respect.

829
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:25,941
But you're wrong and you shouldn't
be yelling at him like that.

830
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,847
Like the way you yell at your family.

831
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,416
I mean, what is up with that?

832
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,351
What's going on with you and your sister?

833
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:32,547
I don't wanna talk about her.

834
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:35,724
No, no. Something goes on every time
you're around your family.

835
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,115
Drop it.

836
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,963
I'm getting really tired of this, Kimberly.
Really tired.

837
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,889
Well, that makes two of us.

838
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,795
I think we need to see a marriage counselor.

839
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,728
I'm not going to any counselor.

840
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:47,603
So you're not interested
in trying to fix this.

841
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,499
Fix what? Tell me, what's broken?

842
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:58,109
Well, I guess if you don't know,
then we don't need to see one.

843
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,155
Who left these dishes in the sink?

844
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,224
H.J.

845
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,087
No, I didn't. Daddy left them.

846
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,226
Oh, you wait until he gets home.

847
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:15,162
You're gonna get it for lying on Daddy.

848
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,528
You better shut up.

849
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:18,167
I'm not a maid, you know.

850
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,566
You look like one.

851
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:24,065
Come wash these plates, H.J.,
and I'm not playing.

852
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,904
I don't feel like washing them plates.
Tammy, leave me alone.

853
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,180
- Boy, I could hurt you sometimes.
- Blah, blah, blah.

854
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:31,814
Daddy's right. You nag too much.

855
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:33,449
- He said that?
- Yeah.

856
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,520
He said you don't cook right,
it be burnt all the time.

857
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,423
- Hey, man.
- What's up, punk-ass?

858
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,827
Did you bring me something home?

859
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,862
- Did you do your homework?
- No, fool.

860
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,934
Then I didn't bring you nothing home.

861
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,366
- Where's your mom?
- In her skin.

862
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:58,065
When you jump out, she jump in.

863
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:01,144
- Move! You shut it.
- Damn.

864
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,438
Tammy, it's our anniversary, baby.

865
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,281
Good God.

866
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,544
Happy anniversary, baby.

867
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:15,116
You think I want some flowers you just
picked up on the side of the road?

868
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:18,524
Ain't no thought put into that, Harold.
"Happy anniversary."

869
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,688
Why would I wanna spend
an anniversary with you?

870
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,857
There's nothing happy about the years
we've been together.

871
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,065
Tammy, I'm trying.

872
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,693
Yeah, I'm trying, too.

873
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,431
I'm trying to get the hell away from you.

874
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,673
And why'd you leave those dishes
in the sink there before you left?

875
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,677
What? I didn't leave no plates.

876
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,372
And you told our sons that I nag too much?

877
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,047
- Tammy.
- Shut up, I'm talking.

878
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,349
- But, I...
- I don't know why in the hell

879
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:46,116
after I go to work all day
I got to come home and clean up after you.

880
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,424
Tammy, you need to have these boys
help you clean up around here.

881
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,152
Didn't I tell you I was talking?

882
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,722
Okay? What is wrong with you?

883
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,558
Am I allowed to answer that?

884
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,633
That is a question, Harold.

885
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,701
Never mind. Just leave me the hell alone.

886
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,541
Will you at least take the flowers?

887
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,577
- Oh, my God, it just cut me.
- Let me see.

888
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:17,450
See? See? See? See?
That's what it is. That's what it is.

889
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,482
What did I do to you?

890
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,951
Don't start all that whining.

891
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:24,456
Look, I just want us
to spend some time together.

892
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,222
No, I'm going to bed.

893
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,697
Keep your stuff in your pants. Good night.

894
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,260
I don't wanna hear your voice.

895
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,499
Shut up.

896
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,099
Tammy...

897
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,041
Happy anniversary, Tammy.

898
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,813
Boy, open the door.
People looking out their windows.

899
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,739
"Be quiet."

900
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,614
You always trying to tell me to be quiet.

901
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,846
I swear,
you're getting on my nerves with that.

902
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,115
What? Are you serious?

903
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,247
You really have me sneaking

904
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,791
...through your mother's house again.
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

905
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:57,861
I don't like this. Let my hand go.

906
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:59,223
- Girl...
- What?

907
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,819
You better hush your mouth.

908
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:02,831
Take me to a hotel with your cheap ass.

909
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,491
- I ain't got no money for no hotel.
- Of course you don't.

910
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:06,125
You don't have money for a hotel,
to buy me shoes

911
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,294
...or anything else for that matter.
- Be quiet!

912
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:08,803
- You're getting on my damn nerves.
- Stop it.

913
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,305
Why you got to... Pain in the ass.

914
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:11,374
Shut up.

915
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,904
- It stinks in here.
- Be quiet.

916
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,307
Look, do you love me?

917
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:18,847
Yes, I guess.

918
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,050
All right then. Stick with me.

919
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,981
You work at a warehouse.
What am I supposed to do with that?

920
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,155
I don't know. How about you get a job?

921
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:30,326
If I got to get a J-A-B,
you ain't getting N-U-N.

922
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,289
Yes, you heard me.

923
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,488
See, when I first met you,

924
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,030
I told you that I needed to be kept.

925
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,459
You're not keeping me.

926
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,998
- Look, Renee.
- What? It's just one drop. I don't get it.

927
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,930
No. The answer's no.

928
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,868
- Okay.
- Yeah.

929
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,976
Look, how about you be quiet
before you wake my mama up.

930
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,571
You're so worried about me
waking your mama up,

931
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,878
look like the police are about to.

932
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:55,952
What?

933
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,157
Damn!

934
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,924
Oh, this is so ghetto.

935
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,761
- Byron Watkins?
- Yeah.

936
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:13,262
Put your hands behind your back.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

937
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,395
- For what?
- What is he getting arrested for?

938
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,598
- What is going on?
- What did I do?

939
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,641
- Come with us, sir.
- Mama, I didn't do nothing, okay?

940
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:21,643
- Ma'am, please, step back inside the house.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

941
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,178
Officers, wait a minute.

942
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,511
- He don't even sell drugs no more.
- Oh, hush up about all them drugs.

943
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,581
What are you doing here?

944
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,331
Hi. I've been calling you.

945
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:51,068
Mother, what are you doing here this late?
How did you get here?

946
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,506
On the bus.

947
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:54,871
The bus?

948
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,141
Mama, there are no buses
in this neighborhood.

949
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:01,078
Well, I rode it as close as I could get,
then I walked the rest of the way.

950
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,076
What's going on?

951
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,918
- Byron was arrested.
- Again?

952
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,451
Yes, and I need bail money for him.

953
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,892
No. Mama, I'm not giving you any money.

954
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,487
If Byron wants to walk around here
selling dope, I can't stop him.

955
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,294
He was not selling dope.

956
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:18,626
Then what was he arrested for?

957
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,498
I don't know, but it wasn't that.

958
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,063
How do you know, Mama?

959
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,401
I looked into his eyes. A mother knows.

960
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,072
A mother knows.

961
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:34,906
Mama, I'm sorry,
but I'm not giving you any money.

962
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,113
Just use my house, then, as collateral.

963
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,455
It's already paid for.

964
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,692
Yes, it is, but I just paid it off again.

965
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,889
Do you remember all the debt
from the second mortgage

966
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,552
and getting him the lawyer the last time?

967
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,496
- He is not lying.
- He was before.

968
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,928
- Ms. Shirley.
- Go back to bed, Calvin.

969
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,265
Ms. Shirley, come on inside.
What are you doing outside?

970
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,996
- I was just...
- Money.

971
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,307
Byron got arrested and she wants money.

972
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,970
I'm sorry. How did you get here?

973
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,371
On the bus. Can you help...

974
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,848
Look, Mama,
I told you I'm not giving you any money.

975
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,112
- Kimberly.
- Stay out of this, Calvin.

976
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,885
Let me put some clothes on.
We'll go down there and bail him out.

977
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:15,959
Oh, really, with what?

978
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,786
Gosh, you are just going to disrespect me
and my wishes again?

979
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,056
That's your mother, girl.

980
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,661
What are you going to do,
let her walk home?

981
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:29,628
Well, she did find a way to get here.
I'm sure she can find her way back.

982
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,767
You are something else.

983
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,473
I don't know why she treats me that way.

984
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:39,873
I'm sorry, Ms. Shirley.

985
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,885
All I've ever tried to do was love her,
you know.

986
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:49,215
Oh, it's okay. Don't
cry, don't cry. It's okay.

987
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,456
I'm just tired, Calvin.

988
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,792
I'm just so tired.

989
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,802
- Cora, I don't wanna go.
- Mr. Brown...

990
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,393
Cora, you can't make me go, no way.

991
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:05,066
All right, Mr. Brown, listen, we're going
to make you as comfortable as we can.

992
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,608
Cora, you don't have to let him
do this to me.

993
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:08,837
You're gonna be all right, Mr. Brown.

994
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:09,913
I ain't gonna be all right.

995
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,640
You go in there and they tell you
it's gonna be all right,

996
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,409
...you wake up dead.
- Oh, no...

997
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:14,745
Y'all kill people in here.

998
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,478
Have anybody ever died in here?

999
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:20,485
- Exactly. Cora, don't do this
to me, please! - Calm down, Mr. Brown.

1000
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,388
- Cora, tell Madea... Tell Madea I love her.
- I will.

1001
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:27,054
- Okay, Cora, tell Madea I'm gonna miss her.
- All right, Mr. Brown.

1002
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,098
- Please, Cora, pray for your daddy.
- I will, Mr. Brown.

1003
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,894
- Pray for your daddy.
- I'm praying for you now.

1004
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,299
- Don't let him do... Pray for your daddy.
- I'm praying for you.

1005
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,495
<i>Pray for your dad</i>

1006
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:36,572
I'm praying.

1007
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,800
<i>Pray for your daddy</i>

1008
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:41,207
- Cora, pray. Sing it.
- I'm praying.

1009
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,835
<i>Pray for your daddy</i>

1010
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,147
Bam, this is what I don't understand.
When did you start going to church?

1011
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:47,648
Look, I had to go to church.

1012
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,685
Bam, back in the day
we used to share the dime.

1013
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:53,449
We used to steal, kill, rob and stab
and now you run to the church house.

1014
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:54,986
Yes, I had to.

1015
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:56,821
Child, I ran up in that church house...

1016
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:57,894
Stop that lying.

1017
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,395
What? I ain't even told you the whole
story yet.

1018
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,794
You done told three lies

1019
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:05,299
just that quick, talking about "I ran up."
You're lying.

1020
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,165
You ain't run up nowhere.

1021
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,568
Look, everybody need run up in here
from this house.

1022
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,767
These people, they're just a
mess up in here. It's just awful.

1023
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,741
I got about $200 I can let y'all borrow.

1024
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,779
About $200, I'll go down there
and put it on his book

1025
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,110
or give y'all for bail,
but you can't get it till the 1st.

1026
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:20,638
Can't get it till the 1st?

1027
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:21,718
Got to get it on the 1st.

1028
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,944
Well, we need it today, but it's okay.
It's all right.

1029
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,749
We'll take what we can get, hon.

1030
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,950
But I was just hoping that Kimberly
would just give it all to her.

1031
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,718
That thing's still mean as hell, ain't she?

1032
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,360
Mean as a junkyard dog.

1033
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:37,060
And listen, Tammy's boys are out of control.
Way out of control.

1034
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:39,527
- Really?
- Just misbehaving.

1035
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,035
- Just awful.
- I need to meet them.

1036
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:42,936
Byron's baby mama.

1037
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,733
She's just ghetto. Real ghetto.
And then her voice just drives you crazy.

1038
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,478
I don't know why she be doing
all that whining and carrying on.

1039
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,049
She's just crazy.

1040
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:57,378
I told Shirley, I said, "Let me talk
to them children," long, long time ago.

1041
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,421
She saying,
"No, I'm just gonna pray for them."

1042
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,218
The Bible say, "Faith without work is dead."

1043
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,224
You got to do more than just pray
for them children, don't you?

1044
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,759
- You do.
- You got to knock the hell out of them.

1045
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:06,351
- That's what you got to do.
- The Christians...

1046
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:07,485
The Christians need to know that.

1047
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,656
That's right. From the top, from the top.

1048
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,698
- Ding, there's the Lord.
- Yes. Yes.

1049
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,464
- Hey, Shirley. What is you doing, girl?
- Hey, Madea.

1050
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:19,007
- Get on here and sit down.
- What are you doing here?

1051
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,737
- How you been?
- Oh, fair to middling.

1052
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,171
Fair to middling.

1053
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:25,771
Bam told you, didn't she?

1054
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:29,516
She got you $200 that she's gonna
bring by on the 1st. Is it 1st?

1055
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:30,743
On the 1st. On the 1st.

1056
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,446
- On the 1st?
- 'Cause I won't have it till the 1st.

1057
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,087
But what did Kimberly say?

1058
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:38,952
Well, did she give you some money for him?

1059
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:42,825
No. She won't even let me borrow
on my own house.

1060
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,825
Well, I called Harold and Tammy.

1061
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,868
- They ain't got money.
- You're right. They ain't got money.

1062
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:48,938
No, nothing.

1063
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,596
Don't you get all worked up
about this, Shirley.

1064
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,709
- Don't you do it. Don't you do it.
- Oh, Lord, my children.

1065
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,210
That's all right, honey. You done raised
them children the best you can.

1066
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,508
Let me tell you something,
parents shouldn't be putting themselves

1067
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,708
on no guilt trip
after you done raised the child.

1068
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:03,214
That's what they were supposed...
You're supposed to raise that child.

1069
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,413
You get them to a place where they grown
and get the hell out

1070
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:06,819
and take care of their own damn self.

1071
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,151
That's what the children need to do.

1072
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,589
You done did that.
That's your responsibility.

1073
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:10,682
You did the best you could.

1074
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,091
Don't get worked up about no damn child.

1075
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,186
Hell, no. You did the best you could.

1076
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,457
- Didn't you do the best you could?
- Yeah.

1077
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:16,623
Then that's all that matters.

1078
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:18,792
I know, I know. But I just feel, you know.

1079
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,304
I feel like you need to let that go.

1080
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,395
Well, anyway, we couldn't get him out.

1081
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,467
They wouldn't tell us anything.

1082
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:28,169
They wouldn't even tell us
what he was arrested for.

1083
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,843
That what the po-po do.
They don't tell you nothing.

1084
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:33,746
Calvin is going to go back down there
with one of his lawyer friends.

1085
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,445
- Oh, oh. Did you call Byron's job?
- Yeah. I called them bastards.

1086
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,649
- What did they say?
- They got rid of him.

1087
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,623
- They're bastards. They're bastards.
- I hate that. I hate it.

1088
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,823
Bam, you know, I need to tell him.

1089
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,658
I'm so tired. I'm running out of time.

1090
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,991
Why don't you just let me call them?

1091
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,794
No, no. I don't want you to call.

1092
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:51,993
I wanna tell them.

1093
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:55,571
I want them to all be together
and I wanna tell them at the same time.

1094
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,470
I wanna sit down at a nice dinner
and then I'm gonna tell them.

1095
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:00,839
You've been saying that you want
to tell them at the same time,

1096
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:01,911
you wanna have dinner...

1097
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,138
Bam, I understand that.

1098
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,448
You want all your children
so they can comfort each other, Bam,

1099
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:06,516
when she tells them the bad news.

1100
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,106
That's all right, honey. That's all right.

1101
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,413
But, Shirley, let me help you
get these children over here.

1102
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,279
- Oh, please.
- Can I help you?

1103
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:16,157
They will be here at dinner at 6:00.
Have dinner ready.

1104
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:17,760
- Today?
- Today. That's right.

1105
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,486
How are you going to get them over here?

1106
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,358
See, y'all Christians is something.

1107
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:22,624
Y'all gonna pull out that Bible,

1108
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:26,224
but y'all don't know which prescripture
to use for which situation.

1109
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,270
You've got to find the right prescripture.

1110
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,532
There's a prescripture that says,

1111
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,835
"Let the redeemed of the Lord say so."

1112
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,342
- Yeah.
- Have you been redeemed by the Lord?

1113
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:35,945
- Yes.
- That's right.

1114
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,604
So if you've been redeemed by the Lord

1115
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,577
and somebody does something to you
that you don't like, even your kids,

1116
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,777
you can beat the hell out of them
and just say, "So?"

1117
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,853
So that's what I'm gonna do.

1118
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,444
I'm gonna beat the hell out of them
and say, "So?"

1119
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,319
And I'm gonna bring them over here
'cause you've been redeemed. I am.

1120
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:49,722
You know what?

1121
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,521
- It makes sense, don't it? God is good.
- It makes sense.

1122
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:52,856
Hallelujer. Hallelujer.

1123
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,157
- Halleluiah.
- Hallelujer!

1124
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,293
- Thanks, man.
- That's what family's for.

1125
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,830
- You okay?
- Yeah, man.

1126
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,235
I just got to get to
work, though, that's all.

1127
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,036
- Come on, I'll drop you off.
- Byron! Byron!

1128
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,072
Just keep walking.

1129
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,943
- So how was your night in jail, Byron?
- Just keep walking.

1130
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,244
I've been waiting for them to bail you out.
Hey, Calvin.

1131
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,514
Hey, Sabrina.

1132
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,591
You better get to work.
You gonna lose that little job.

1133
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,256
You know what? You damn right.

1134
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,524
'Cause that mean
you won't be getting nothing no more.

1135
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:29,292
I bet I will.

1136
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:31,498
- Byron, come on.
- No, no. No, hold on.

1137
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,894
Sabrina, come on.
What are you messing with me for, huh?

1138
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,296
I'm trying.

1139
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,534
Then what, you're gonna throw me in jail
over some back child support?

1140
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,210
Where that little trick Renee at?

1141
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:44,541
Come on, you gotta get to work.

1142
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,649
Work? He ain't really working.

1143
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,684
He's gonna lose that little job anyway.

1144
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,912
Then he's gonna be back on the streets,
selling dope,

1145
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,784
and I better have my money then.

1146
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:53,947
- Come on...
- Let's go.

1147
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,885
Bye. Byron...

1148
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,527
I can't take it no more, man.

1149
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,498
Look, I got to deal with Renee on one ear,
I got to deal with Sabrina on the other.

1150
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:07,293
Byron, listen, don't let these girls
get you crossed up.

1151
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:09,730
You got to think about your son.

1152
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,098
You're doing good, man. You hear me?

1153
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,378
- Just stay straight.
- I'm trying, man.

1154
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,322
Throw your hands up.

1155
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,160
Hey, Harold.

1156
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:37,397
Hey, Ms. Madea. All right,
what's wrong with your car now?

1157
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,467
Nothing.

1158
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,261
- For real?
- Nothing's wrong with it at all,

1159
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,737
except the other day I went out there
and put my foot on the gas

1160
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,637
and the trunk opened.
What the hell is that, Harold?

1161
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,170
You are trifling as hell.

1162
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:49,905
I'm so tired of bringing my damn car
up in here for you to fix.

1163
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,742
I am not bringing it to you no more.
Do you understand?

1164
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,815
Not ever again.

1165
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,747
Every time I go out there in the morning
I try to start my car,

1166
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,513
do you know what happens?
Do you know what happens, Harold?

1167
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,513
It don't start. I have to pray.

1168
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,783
You know God don't like me.
You know he don't like me.

1169
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:05,486
All the hell I did in my lifetime,
you know he don't like me at all, hell.

1170
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,023
- All right. Let me handle this.
- No, sit down.

1171
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,098
Do what you do best. Sit down.
Just stay right where...

1172
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,633
Just plant your ass
right there in that chair.

1173
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:13,794
Every time I come here,
you're sitting in that chair.

1174
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:15,894
People waiting on their car,
you're sitting in that chair.

1175
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,973
You're supposed to be changing oil,
you're sitting in that chair.

1176
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,439
You're supposed to be changing
the windshield wiper blade,

1177
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,566
you're sitting in that chair.

1178
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,406
Supposed to wash a car,
you're sitting in that chair.

1179
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,139
Let me tell you something,
when you die, tell them people

1180
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,045
to bury you on your stomach
to give your ass a break.

1181
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,778
Where is your wife?

1182
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,112
In here, Madea.

1183
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,921
- Oh, hey, Tammy. How you doing?
- Hi, Madea.

1184
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,324
I don't know how you married
that bastard, Lord.

1185
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,228
I ain't seen your kids
since they were five years old.

1186
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,061
What you been feeding
that big pumpkin over there?

1187
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,293
Look like he been eating hay.

1188
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,529
And you look like
you've been eating at the zoo.

1189
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:48,862
H. J...

1190
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,139
Oh, it's like that. He's just going...

1191
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:55,302
- I would... I'm just...
- What brings you by, Madea?

1192
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:58,343
- Is your car acting up?
- My car is fine.

1193
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,276
Oh, okay.

1194
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,352
Your mother told me to come over
and be nice to all the children.

1195
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,454
She said she's having a dinter
tonight at 6:00,

1196
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,421
and she want all of y'all
to come over and eat.

1197
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:10,318
We were just over there. What's going on?

1198
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:12,686
Nothing. She wants to see all of y'all.

1199
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,390
Me and Harold can't loan her
no more money, Madea.

1200
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,556
I mean, we're struggling.

1201
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,925
Child, I know you're struggling.
I'm looking at the top of your head.

1202
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,333
I see struggle written all over
that new growth.

1203
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,373
It is like a miracle just spelling it out
across the top of your head.

1204
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:26,198
Your mama want all of y'all
to come over there.

1205
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,539
Now, that's all I'm supposed to say.
Y'all be there, bring the kids...

1206
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,813
- I ain't going.
- You ain't going?

1207
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,278
Yes, you are.

1208
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,976
I said, I ain't going, Tammy.

1209
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:42,457
Okay. You're gonna let them
talk to you like that, Tammy?

1210
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,616
Don't worry, Madea. He's just a kid.

1211
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:48,356
Just kids end up being just adults
who are in just damn jail.

1212
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,797
Don't let no child talk to you like that,
Tammy, that's...

1213
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:53,835
Yeah, okay. I have a customer.
Don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be right back.

1214
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,494
- Well, go on and deal with that then.
- Okay.

1215
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:56,730
I'm gonna talk to the boys.

1216
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:00,808
What are you looking at, old lady?

1217
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,235
Come on... Hey...

1218
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:07,377
Stop hitting me, old lady.

1219
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,984
I don't wanna have this conversation
with you again.

1220
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:18,390
Do you understand, son?

1221
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,356
I see you learn fast.

1222
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,329
Now look here.

1223
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:26,030
You young folks are so damn disrespectful.
You're not gonna disrespect me.

1224
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:28,262
I come from the school where you said,
"Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am."

1225
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,168
"Yes, sir. No, sir."
You showed some respect,

1226
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,968
or you got your teeth
knocked out of your mouth.

1227
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,770
Do you understand me?
I can't stand young folks

1228
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,003
sitting around at the bus stop,

1229
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,375
got old people sitting there,
they're cussing, pants hanging off.

1230
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,469
You're gonna show me some respect.

1231
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,776
I got silver hair,
but I also have silver bullets.

1232
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:41,976
Do you want one of them?

1233
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,283
Now, when a lady walk here
you say, "Heller." Heller?

1234
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:46,650
- Heller.
- Heller!

1235
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:47,950
- Heller.
- Heller!

1236
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,115
Heller.

1237
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,216
You be disrespectful again,
I'm gonna beat your ass.

1238
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:56,053
I'm gonna beat your ass till you ain't gonna
have nothing but legs running up your back.

1239
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:58,224
Do you hear me?
You're just gonna have legs, no more ass.

1240
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:00,461
'Cause I'm gonna beat it.
Do you hear me, boy?

1241
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,507
- Thank yer. Thank yer.
- Thank yer.

1242
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,041
Good afternoot.

1243
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:09,008
- Good afternoot.
- You're welker.

1244
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,273
- You're welker.
- Yes, you sound very proper now.

1245
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,406
- I'm going home.
- Goodbye, ma'am.

1246
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,740
That's wonderful.

1247
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,820
Thought you was going to be slow,
like your daddy.

1248
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,013
- Bye, Madea.
- See you later.

1249
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,180
Bye-bye, Madea.

1250
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:21,621
Bye, Harold. You maggot.

1251
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,692
Why is you face red, H. J?

1252
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,489
You constipated?

1253
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,129
Where were you, Byron?

1254
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,067
- Look, I can explain, all right?
- I'm listening.

1255
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,330
Look, I got arrested.

1256
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,371
- Listen, listen. It's not
what you think, okay? - Okay.

1257
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,374
Just a little back child
support. That was it.

1258
00:59:40,476 --> 00:59:41,670
Look, it wasn't even my fault.

1259
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,778
Take some responsibility, son.
It is your fault, all right?

1260
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,508
Life ain't happening just to you.

1261
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:50,278
Your choices, they have consequences.
I'm sorry.

1262
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:54,085
Mr. Mills, look, I need this job. Please!

1263
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,623
You didn't act like you needed this job.

1264
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,090
You were supposed to be here at 6:00 a.m.

1265
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,760
Look, I'm sorry.

1266
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,757
Please! Please! Come on.
Don't do this to me now.

1267
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,798
Who's the only person that gave me a shot
when I got out?

1268
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:13,338
Your chances with me, they've run out.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to let you go.

1269
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,036
You're fired.

1270
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:19,378
So what am I supposed to do now? Huh?

1271
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:20,707
Take up track.

1272
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:23,147
As a matter of fact, practice now.
Run on up out of here.

1273
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,383
Damn, man!

1274
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,755
Look, I ain't say nothing about soccer.

1275
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,618
Look, you better be glad I'm two classes
away from being baptized.

1276
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,060
All y'all get back in
there. Don't get behind.

1277
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,631
- Hey, boy.
- Hey, Madea.

1278
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:44,536
Lord, I didn't know where the hell you work.
I done came way over here.

1279
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,041
- How you doing?
- I had a long night, okay?

1280
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,471
Look, I just got fired.
I just wanna go home.

1281
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:51,506
Yeah, well, we all had a rough night here.

1282
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:52,581
Your mama's having a rough night.

1283
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:55,480
She want all of y'all at her house at 6:00.
She having a dinner over there.

1284
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,750
- Mama don't wanna see me.
- Yeah, she do.

1285
01:00:57,854 --> 01:01:00,015
Now, be there. I'm telling you,
we're gonna have a nice dinner

1286
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:02,023
and I wanna talk to all y'all,
she's gonna talk to you.

1287
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,217
So be there at 6:00.

1288
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,452
And if you ain't there,
let me tell you something.

1289
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,857
You're gonna wish that the sperm

1290
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,862
did a backstroke when it saw the egg
that created you.

1291
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,022
Do you understand?

1292
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:10,691
And pull your pants up.

1293
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,166
Why the hell you got
your pants on the ground?

1294
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:16,136
I don't know what the hell is wrong
with y'all young boys with these damn pants

1295
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,433
hanging down to your knees.

1296
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,337
That don't look good. You look like a fool.

1297
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:20,466
That's probably why you got arrested.

1298
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,009
You can't run from the police like that.

1299
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:24,477
I want to meet the jackass
that started pulling his pants down

1300
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,979
and then everybody started following him.

1301
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,107
Why can't you lead
and let everybody follow you?

1302
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,151
Pull your damn pants up.
Look like somebody.

1303
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,617
It's called swag. Just...

1304
01:01:32,722 --> 01:01:34,280
I got your swag.

1305
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,615
Somebody looking at your ass
when you walk down the street.

1306
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:37,988
That ain't no damn swag.

1307
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:40,221
Get the hell on out of here.
You better be there at 6:00.

1308
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:41,353
And pull your pants up.

1309
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,194
Now this house is sitting
on three acres of land.

1310
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:48,859
So you have plenty of room
if you do plan on having little ones.

1311
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:52,407
And when you come out here,
I mean, it's beautiful.

1312
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,476
We have excellent school systems.

1313
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,211
On the outside,
we have the cobblestone driveway...

1314
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,782
And an infinity pool in the background
that leads into a waterfall.

1315
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:11,291
Also a nice little grilling area in the back
if you ever wanna entertain your guests.

1316
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,759
- It's a beautiful home.
- Man, it's so bougie.

1317
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,853
We have the wooden...

1318
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,959
- We have the marble pillars here.
- I know she didn't just act like

1319
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,264
...she didn't see me. Kimberly!
- With all the bordering that you can...

1320
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,465
I know you didn't just act like you didn't
see me when I looked through that window.

1321
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,702
- Kimberly.
- Madea.

1322
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:28,936
- Yes.
- Hello.

1323
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:30,271
You got clients.

1324
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,280
I'm showing a house. Could we speak later?

1325
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,910
Ner. I came over here
because I need to talk to you.

1326
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:43,120
Excuse me. This will only take a second.
Just give me a moment, please?

1327
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:44,625
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1328
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:50,396
Madea, this is highly inappropriate.
How did you know I was here?

1329
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,430
Because your husband told me
where the hell you were.

1330
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:55,536
I am going to kill him.

1331
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:57,630
Why haven't you returned
my telephone calls?

1332
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,469
Because I've been busy.

1333
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:03,341
You ain't been that busy that you can't
return my tetephone calls.

1334
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,936
Now, listen, your mama...

1335
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:06,844
No, this is not the time for that, okay?

1336
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,541
Girl, don't you interrupt me...

1337
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:11,620
Who the hell...
Look here. I talked to your mama.

1338
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,452
Could you lower your voice?

1339
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:16,385
Okay. Excuse me.

1340
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:21,085
Your mama has asked me
to come over to this house

1341
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:24,596
to get all of y'all to come over there
to dinter, okay?

1342
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:28,693
6:00. Have your ass at the table
to give thanks to God for what he's done.

1343
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:29,829
Do you understand me?

1344
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,100
Don't make me have to come back
over here to find you.

1345
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,769
Because I will drag you out of here
by your two front teeth.

1346
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:38,779
That's all you will get for Christmas.
Do you understand me?

1347
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:42,339
Do you understand
what the hell I am saying to you?

1348
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,147
Do you understand the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

1349
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,279
- Yes, ma'am. I understand.
- Let me tell you something.

1350
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:50,223
If you are not there, every house...
No, don't look at them.

1351
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,657
Don't look at them.

1352
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:54,025
Let me tell you something,
every house you get ready to sell,

1353
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,121
I will be in the front window like this.

1354
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,726
Do you hear what the hell I am telling you?

1355
01:03:58,267 --> 01:03:59,666
Fine. I'll be there.

1356
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:02,128
- I will see you there.
- Okay, all right. Goodbye.

1357
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:03,730
So good to see all of you.

1358
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,105
And I hope you enjoy and buy the house.
It's a lovely home.

1359
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,538
Upstairs it looks like
it has three bedrooms,

1360
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:13,012
two bathrooms
and everything else that people like.

1361
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:15,379
Okay. Don't touch me.
Don't put your hands on me.

1362
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:17,349
You better go handle your client.
Get the hell away from me.

1363
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,045
Don't put your damn hands on me.

1364
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:22,152
Got me coming over here
to this damn neighborhood.

1365
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:25,421
You know I don't have
a driver's license, the first.

1366
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,722
How the hell do I get out of
this bougie neighborhood?

1367
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:35,528
- Hello, Ms. Cora.
- Dr. Evans.

1368
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,870
- How is he?
- He's okay.

1369
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:40,704
But he's lost a lot of blood.

1370
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,345
Really? Is he gonna be okay?

1371
01:04:43,446 --> 01:04:47,109
Oh, yes, yes.
But, would you mind giving some blood?

1372
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,444
It's always best from a relative.

1373
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,215
Sure, sure. I will.

1374
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:51,679
What's your blood type?

1375
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,348
I'm really not sure of that.

1376
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,723
- Well, come on. We'll find out.
- All right.

1377
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,588
Jiggling, jiggling, jiggling, and you know,
all these stretch marks.

1378
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,195
What, they look like lightning.

1379
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,525
Oh, look at that chicken.

1380
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:07,596
You didn't tell me you was making chicken.
I love your chicken.

1381
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,764
Let's bow our heads.

1382
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,166
Oh, God.

1383
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,005
- Heavenly...
- Byron!

1384
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:23,581
- What is that?
- That's the baby mama from hell.

1385
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:26,853
What are you doing here?

1386
01:05:26,956 --> 01:05:29,151
Look, take this baby.
I got somewheres to go.

1387
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,919
Look, and I got things to do, too.

1388
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:34,292
Like what, Byron?
Come on. I need to get to the TV station.

1389
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,723
What are you talking about? TV...
What are you doing?

1390
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:39,933
Look, you need nots to worry about
what I'm doing, all right.

1391
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:43,033
Hi, Ms. Shirley and everybody.
What's up? Hey, Calvin.

1392
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,273
Hey!

1393
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,871
Where that little trick at?

1394
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:49,240
Now, look here. This is a very private
family moment right now, okay?

1395
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,540
You got to come back some other time.
Take your child on out of here.

1396
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:54,510
- Don't I know you?
- Don't I know you?

1397
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:57,213
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

1398
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,312
You that lady that tried to come up
to my store and drive through my window.

1399
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:04,047
No, I didn't come up, I didn't try, I did,
'cause you ghetto as hell.

1400
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,492
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Who is she talking to?

1401
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,119
Byron, she got the wrong one.

1402
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:10,899
We're having a very private
family moment right here now.

1403
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,730
You need to take that little baby
and y'all come on back some other time.

1404
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:16,063
- Now, go on now. Go on.
- Okay, okay.

1405
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,199
- Just give me my son, please. All right.
- Yeah.

1406
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:22,102
- Would you get out of here, please?
- Glad to.

1407
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:26,638
But all I know is you better have my money.

1408
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:28,507
Man, she punk, and you look like...

1409
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,917
- Grown folks business. Shut the hell up.
- Will you please get out of here?

1410
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,352
Glad to.

1411
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,148
You know what I know,
if you knew better, you'd do better.

1412
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:39,750
You better have my money. Bye, y'all.

1413
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:41,663
Have a nice day.

1414
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,128
- Okay.
- You better lock the door

1415
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,096
...before she steals
everything in the kitchen. - Oh, Jesus.

1416
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:46,423
How the hell did you hook up with...

1417
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,503
See, young boy, that's what happens
when you hook up with...

1418
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,834
Oh, look who finally decided to show up.

1419
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,908
I can tell you this,
I thought I was gonna have to go out there

1420
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,136
and hunt you down like a rabid dog.

1421
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:57,303
- Well, I made it.
- Yes, you did.

1422
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:58,903
She's so burgie.

1423
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,320
Did you tell Madea where I was?

1424
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:06,820
She was trying to find you.

1425
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,759
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

1426
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:13,724
That's all right.
We'll deal with this when we get home.

1427
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:15,888
- No. No, no...
- All right, let's pray.

1428
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:17,625
Let's deal with this right now.

1429
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:19,291
- I have an announcement to make.
- Calvin!

1430
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:20,460
- No!
- Keep your voice...

1431
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,037
Family, I am sick of Kimberly's bull.

1432
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:27,533
Do you think this is funny, Calvin?

1433
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:29,740
- Trouble in paradise.
- Tammy.

1434
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:30,869
What?

1435
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:35,172
You need to get some help,
and if you don't, I'm leaving.

1436
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,515
And I'm taking my son with me.

1437
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,120
You are not taking
my child anywhere, Calvin.

1438
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:43,353
You think I'm gonna let you
put all this venom in my child?

1439
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:46,651
You are not taking him...

1440
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:49,196
Don't these look good, Shirley?
They sure look good. Y'all wanna eat some?

1441
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:52,563
Yes, it does, yes, it
does. I just wanna eat it.

1442
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,726
I can't do this.

1443
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:57,738
I can't do this. I'm sorry, I can't sit here

1444
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:01,438
like we're one big happy family
when you know we can't stand each other.

1445
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,407
- Kimberly...
- No, Mama.

1446
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:05,571
If you want us to sit here, you eat it.

1447
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,148
Kimberly, don't talk to
your mother like that.

1448
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,716
Calvin, you better shut the hell up.

1449
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,348
I'll talk to my mom
how I wanna talk to my mother.

1450
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:14,881
I'm not gonna tell you again
to show me some damn respect.

1451
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,185
- What is wrong with you?
- You're what's wrong with me.

1452
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,896
Everybody sitting here, like, playing nice.

1453
01:08:20,996 --> 01:08:22,861
This is wrong. This is ridiculous.

1454
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:27,664
Kimberly, I just wanted to have a nice
family dinner, everybody together.

1455
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:28,961
- Why?
- That's all.

1456
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:30,800
Girl, you better act
like you got some sense.

1457
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:35,465
Shut up, Tammy. Nobody's talking to you.

1458
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:37,401
But I'm talking to you.

1459
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:43,084
You are always in my business.
It is so obvious you're jealous.

1460
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,311
Jealous of what?

1461
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,853
- Kim, stop...
- Shut up, Calvin.

1462
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,889
- Tammy, you...
- Shut up, Harold.

1463
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,218
What I got to be jealous of?

1464
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,017
Tammy, stop it.

1465
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,026
No, no. No, no, Shirley,
you need to let this happen.

1466
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,324
You need to let this happen and figure out

1467
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:56,989
what the hell is going on
with these children.

1468
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,930
Let it happen. Let it
get all out in the open.

1469
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:01,502
Go on and say what you need to say.
Say what you need to say, Tam.

1470
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:04,405
- I wanna hear this.
- Of me.

1471
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,004
That's right. I said it. Me.

1472
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,944
My family, my husband...

1473
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:12,605
Oh, girl, please.
I don't want anything you got.

1474
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:17,215
But you get rid of what you don't want,
don't you?

1475
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,123
Like us.

1476
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,549
- Whatever.
- We're your family.

1477
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,352
All Mama wanted us to do
was sit down and have dinner,

1478
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:27,929
but you just can't do that.

1479
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,355
Why, Kimberly?

1480
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,066
Are we too ghetto for you?

1481
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:33,959
You don't eat greens and cornbread
no more?

1482
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,900
- Tammy...
- No, Mama.

1483
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:37,897
I need to say this.

1484
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:40,703
I'm not jealous of you.

1485
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,574
I'm not the one who got pregnant at 13

1486
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,174
and had Mama to raise my child.

1487
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:50,511
- Tammy!
- Say something now.

1488
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,593
Kimberly, what is she talking about?

1489
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:06,532
You are too ghetto for me.

1490
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:08,626
And you make me sick.

1491
01:10:09,004 --> 01:10:10,164
Let's go.

1492
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,404
Let's go.

1493
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,205
Now, Calvin.

1494
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,606
I need to talk to... Kimberly!

1495
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,140
I'm sorry, Mama.

1496
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,817
This had to happen, Shirley.
Don't worry about it.

1497
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:28,913
- It had to happen, Shirley. Let's pray.
- Please.

1498
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,389
- Come on, honey.
- Kimberly had a baby...

1499
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:34,621
<i>Call on Jesus</i>

1500
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:38,156
Aunt Bam, you used to watch the baby?

1501
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,234
Baby, you...
Yeah, I'm still watching the baby.

1502
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,172
- You need a joint, baby. Really.
- No, I'm all right.

1503
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:48,807
Mom! Mom!

1504
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:51,502
<i>Tell the pastor I say...</i>

1505
01:10:51,614 --> 01:10:53,605
<i>Come on in the room</i>

1506
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:56,241
Mom, you used to watch that baby?

1507
01:10:58,454 --> 01:10:59,478
Yes.

1508
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:02,580
<i>Jesus in my doctor</i>

1509
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:03,680
<i>And he</i>

1510
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:07,193
<i>Writes out all of my scripture</i>

1511
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:08,725
I mean, we're here.

1512
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:12,427
Where he at?

1513
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:16,104
I mean, we're all here as a family, right?
You know...

1514
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:21,105
You should look in the mirror.

1515
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,185
So what are y'all trying to say?

1516
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:35,413
Kimberly is my mother?

1517
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,390
Yes.

1518
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:40,920
Talk about don't tell lies.

1519
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:42,621
Keeping secrets.

1520
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:45,731
But you kept one from me.

1521
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:48,236
All right.

1522
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:50,472
I'm out.

1523
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,834
- Byron!
- I don't wanna hear it, Aunt Bam.

1524
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,408
- Wait a minute.
- Byron!

1525
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:57,536
Excuse me, everybody. Madea, carry on.

1526
01:11:58,614 --> 01:11:59,979
Byron, let me talk to you, Son.

1527
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,879
Not right now. I don't wanna hear it, Mama.

1528
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,216
That wasn't the way to do that.

1529
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,482
Shut up, Harold.

1530
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:08,647
Stop talking to this man like that.

1531
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,122
You're gonna stop
talking to this man like that.

1532
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,819
That's why these children don't have
no respect for the either one of y'all.

1533
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:16,386
Y'all sit there talking to each other
like y'all ain't got no sense.

1534
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:18,692
Get up and go upstairs.
Let me talk to your mommy and daddy.

1535
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:19,994
- Go on.
- Yes, ma'am.

1536
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,501
Very good.

1537
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,336
Now what was I saying?

1538
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:32,079
Harold, the only reason this woman is talking
to you like that is 'cause you let her.

1539
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:36,811
Don't no woman want no weak, whiny,
wimp running behind her like a wet dog.

1540
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:39,444
Put your foot down.
Stand up and be a man in your house.

1541
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,079
That's why your damn children
run around here

1542
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,350
act like they ain't go no sense,

1543
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,221
talking back,
'cause you won't put your foot down.

1544
01:12:44,326 --> 01:12:46,419
The children are watching
the two of y'all disrespect each other,

1545
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:47,995
so they're disrespecting you, too.

1546
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,255
Set an example.

1547
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,663
You used to love this man.
You used to love him to death.

1548
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:54,235
Look at me when I'm talking to you.
He ain't playing football.

1549
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:56,234
Y'all were gonna be together forever.
Remember that?

1550
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:57,805
Running up in here talking about
you getting married

1551
01:12:57,906 --> 01:12:59,032
and how much you love him.

1552
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:01,132
Now you done hit that patch in life
you don't know what to do.

1553
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:02,835
Honey, everybody go through that patch.

1554
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,977
It's rough. I call it
the traffic jam of life.

1555
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:09,016
It happens between the age of 40 and 50.
That is a rough decade for anybody.

1556
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,142
Do you hear me?

1557
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:12,812
Now, I'll tell you why. 'Cause during
that 10 years a few things happen.

1558
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:15,116
One, you go through menopause.

1559
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,215
Secondly,
your husband having a midlife crisis.

1560
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:20,090
If you got children, they start acting
like they ain't got no sense at all.

1561
01:13:20,195 --> 01:13:22,459
At the same time your parents
are getting sick and dying,

1562
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,758
his parents are sick and dying.

1563
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:25,800
You try to take care of them,
take care of your household,

1564
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,199
that's enough to stress any marriage
apart, honey.

1565
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:30,531
That's enough to stress it out
and make y'all break up.

1566
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:32,163
That's why you're so angry, honey.

1567
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,969
You've got to take some time and deal...

1568
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:35,976
But he just makes me so mad, Madea.

1569
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:39,536
Get on up.
Go in the kitchen and have a conversation.

1570
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,878
That wasn't the way to tell that boy
that that's his mama.

1571
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,977
That wasn't the way to tell him that at all.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1572
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:47,716
Tammy.

1573
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:50,189
Be a man. Be a man.

1574
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:51,991
She's right.

1575
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:55,253
You got to stop being mean to me, Tammy.

1576
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:58,959
Harold, you got to stop acting like we don't
have any problems, because we do.

1577
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,329
And if we don't clear this up, we are...

1578
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,563
You got to stop telling me what I got to do.

1579
01:14:02,905 --> 01:14:05,533
You're going to stop being mean to me.

1580
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,808
You got it?

1581
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:09,972
You got it, Tammy, huh?

1582
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:11,705
Yeah.

1583
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,142
I'm sorry.

1584
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,274
That's right you're sorry. And...

1585
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,178
Sit down. Sit down.

1586
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,985
Now, sit your ass down. You heard me.

1587
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,417
You heard us...
I mean, you heard me. Sit down.

1588
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:28,528
S-I-T.

1589
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:35,660
Yeah. That's right.
It's gonna be a new day around here.

1590
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,105
H.J., Will, get in here...

1591
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,831
I'm glad I'm here. I got all this straight.

1592
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:41,307
Madea, I'm so glad you're here.

1593
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,775
You got all this straight.

1594
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,175
- Yes, indeed.
- This is wonderful.

1595
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,416
Where are you going?

1596
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:50,817
I love you.

1597
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:54,650
But the way you treat me and C.J.
and your family, I can't take it anymore.

1598
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,921
I can't believe you've been hiding
all these secrets from me.

1599
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:59,858
You think I need you? I don't need you.

1600
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:02,396
I was fine before you,
and I'll be fine after.

1601
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:04,360
- Go ahead.
- You need help.

1602
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:05,622
I feel sorry for you.

1603
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:07,396
Go to hell.

1604
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,772
You're not taking my son.

1605
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:15,503
- You're not taking him.
- You watch me.

1606
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:17,375
Calvin...

1607
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:18,776
Get back here, Calvin. Don't leave me.

1608
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,339
What do you care? You already
got one you left at the doorstep.

1609
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,011
Don't take my baby, Calvin.

1610
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,822
That's my baby. Don't take him from me.

1611
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,050
Don't. Please.

1612
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:36,255
So Kimberly is your mother. Are you okay?

1613
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,165
Look, baby, I'm fine.

1614
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,492
That is crazy.

1615
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,101
Look, I don't wanna talk about that.

1616
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,497
- You wanna go to my sister's house? - No.
No. I don't wanna be around all of them.

1617
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:50,069
Well, then where are we going, Byron?

1618
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:54,406
Listen, babe, I'm gonna go holla at Roscoe,
a'ight? I'll make this last little drop.

1619
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,617
I gotta do what I gotta do.

1620
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,310
I'm so proud of you.

1621
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:02,447
- Hey, yo, my man. Just let
me get a 40. And... - Hey, how you doing?

1622
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:05,616
<i>On the next</i> Maury,
<i>deadbeat dads.</i>

1623
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,192
<i>You out there selling drugs,</i>
<i>selling on the corner,</i>

1624
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:09,958
<i>working the block, pumping the strip,</i>

1625
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,965
<i>and you can't even give me no money</i>
<i>for your baby?</i>

1626
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,525
<i>But it's all right,</i>
<i>'cause we gonna be all right, Byron...</i>

1627
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,503
<i>I know I sound like a siren...</i>

1628
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,768
<i>But you won't take care of this baby...</i>

1629
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,840
- Oh, hell no!
- <i>And there ain't gonna be no maybe...</i>

1630
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:28,341
<i>Byron...</i>

1631
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,108
Damn! Come on. Come on.

1632
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:34,278
<i>We're talking about your son</i>
<i>and whether his father is in his life.</i>

1633
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:36,289
That Byron baby mama
on <i>The Maury Povich Show,</i>

1634
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:38,052
talkin' about that boy. Lord have mercy.

1635
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,661
I don't even understand why that girl
would go on that television show

1636
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:42,127
and do that to that boy.

1637
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:44,863
Poor Byron. Lord have mercy.
I got to talk to him.

1638
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,331
I need to give him my number.
"1-800-Choke-That-Ho."

1639
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,971
<i>Does he ever say, "It's not my child"?</i>

1640
01:16:51,073 --> 01:16:53,405
- Just ghetto at its best.
- I don't even like this show. Turn it...

1641
01:16:53,942 --> 01:16:55,341
Turn it...

1642
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,275
Turn it up. Turn it up.

1643
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:58,778
- Yeah, she's nuts.
- <i>Would you call him a deadbeat dad?</i>

1644
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,507
- She's crazy. And he crazy to be with her.
- <i>I think I would.</i>

1645
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,208
- Cora.
- I'm coming.

1646
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:04,251
Hey, Brown, how's your ass?

1647
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:07,044
- It fine.
- Funky.

1648
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:11,114
What y'all doing sitting here...
What's the matter?

1649
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:14,462
Y'all look mad. What the doctor say?
Some bad news, Brown?

1650
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:17,054
- He's fine.
- Ask her, Cora.

1651
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:18,657
- You ask.
- Ask her.

1652
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,758
Madea, who's my daddy?

1653
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:27,198
I knew that was coming.
I knew that was coming.

1654
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:31,972
What are you talking about?

1655
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,605
All of the money I gave you
for child support on this child

1656
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:36,181
and you don't even know who her daddy is?

1657
01:17:36,284 --> 01:17:38,718
Oh, bastard. You gave me $18 in 18 years.

1658
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,082
Shut the hell up. There wasn't no montey.

1659
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,290
What y'all talking about?
What you talking about?

1660
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,621
Madea, we had blood work
done at the hospital today,

1661
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:48,194
and Dr. Evans said there's no way possible
Mr. Brown could be my daddy.

1662
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:49,991
So I ask you, who is her daddy?

1663
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:53,395
Ya'll need to go on
<i>Maury,</i> too. Call Maury.

1664
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:55,061
The doctor say that?

1665
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:56,497
- Yes.
- Yes.

1666
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:58,167
Who's my daddy, Madea?

1667
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:03,041
If Charlie Brown ain't your dad,
then I don't know who it is.

1668
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:05,442
Madea, how could you not know
who my daddy is?

1669
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:08,573
I hate to tell you this, honey,
but your mama was a ho.

1670
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:12,886
I was a ho.

1671
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,880
I put the "H" and the "O" in ho.

1672
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,182
- Who's my daddy, Madea?
- Okay, all right. I'm gonna tell you.

1673
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,691
Joe, shut up. Don't you say nothing.

1674
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,962
Who is it? He can tell me.
Who is it, Uncle Joe?

1675
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:26,792
Now this was before Hilary and after Monica.

1676
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,098
- What?
- What?

1677
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,805
Bill Clinton is my daddy?

1678
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:34,533
Bill Clinton was not your daddy.

1679
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:37,874
Okay. No, no.
It was before he started that show

1680
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:40,243
with Sybil and J. Anthony on the radio.

1681
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,881
I believe that might have been him.

1682
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,716
Tom Joyner is your daddy.

1683
01:18:45,821 --> 01:18:47,584
Cora, I knew it. I knew it.

1684
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:50,957
- Oh, oh, oh. Ho! Ho! Ho!
- Uncle Joe.

1685
01:18:52,494 --> 01:18:53,722
Tom Joyner ain't you dad, hon.

1686
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,694
Look, y'all stop asking me
all these questions, honey.

1687
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,196
That's your daddy right there.
I'm telling you.

1688
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,995
They made a mistake at the hospillar.
That is your daddy.

1689
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,866
I'm gonna find out.

1690
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,865
Dana'll tell you anything you wanna know.
Call Dana.

1691
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:07,769
- Dana? Who is Dana?
- Yeah, who is Dana?

1692
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,776
They both dumb as hell.
You don't know what Dana is?

1693
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:12,642
They've been using Dana
to find people out for years

1694
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,238
who the daddy or who the mama, Dana.

1695
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,748
And when you kill somebody, the crime,

1696
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,819
they use Dana to get
all the evidence on you.

1697
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:20,012
Dumbass. You need to watch
some television sometime.

1698
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,716
Learn something.
Jackass don't know what Dana is. Hell.

1699
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:28,327
D-N-A. D-N-A. That's Dana.
Lord, you're so dumb.

1700
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,959
- Nobody called no Dana.
- No Dana.

1701
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,258
You know what here? That's your daddy.

1702
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:33,595
I don't even want to be bothered
with this no more.

1703
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:36,728
I done told you the truth. You don't like
what the hell I got to say, that's the truth.

1704
01:19:36,838 --> 01:19:38,237
I'm sorry.
I know you don't want him to be your daddy,

1705
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,864
I didn't want him to be your daddy either.

1706
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:43,206
That was the worst 36 seconds of my life.
Right there sitting next to you.

1707
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:44,869
- I'm out of here.
- You told me a minute.

1708
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:46,311
Girl, he messing with you.

1709
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:50,309
Maury.

1710
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:52,386
<i>The DNA does not lie.</i>

1711
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:55,923
<i>If you want to find out who the father</i>
<i>of your child is call this number.</i>

1712
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:25,267
- Mama!
- Yes, baby. I'm your mama.

1713
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,268
Mama, why are you in here?

1714
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,609
I've been sick a long time.

1715
01:22:32,213 --> 01:22:33,840
Mama, why didn't you tell us?

1716
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:36,144
I tried to tell all y'all.

1717
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:44,387
Tammy, quit all that crying.

1718
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,193
Now, where Kimberly?

1719
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:51,964
We've all been trying to call her.
She won't pick up her phone.

1720
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,034
Mama, what's wrong?

1721
01:22:56,204 --> 01:22:58,570
I wanted to tell all of y'all together.

1722
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,144
I guess that's too late.

1723
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:06,712
I got cancer...

1724
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:11,950
I let it go a long, long while.

1725
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:16,290
I prayed the whole way over here.

1726
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:20,624
I told God if you just
feel a little bit better,

1727
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:23,922
I'll do right.

1728
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,724
I don't care who my mother is, all right?

1729
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:28,869
I don't.

1730
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:32,130
Because you're my mother.

1731
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:36,210
I'm gonna do right. But
you gotta get better.

1732
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:39,569
You gotta get better.

1733
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:44,613
You're gonna have to get right on your own.

1734
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:48,044
- I'm dying, baby.
- No.

1735
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:50,317
- I'm so tired.
- No.

1736
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:56,921
Y'all got to get right with Jesus
so I can see you again.

1737
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,629
Mama, let's just do
what you taught us to do.

1738
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:02,564
We'll pray that God heals you.

1739
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,972
I prayed he'd heal me,

1740
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,238
but whether it's on this side or in heaven,
it's all right.

1741
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:11,873
Don't talk like that.

1742
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:13,777
Tammy,

1743
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,442
now you look at me. I ain't scared.

1744
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:19,353
You don't feel bad for me.

1745
01:24:19,454 --> 01:24:23,447
You feel bad for somebody
that don't know Jesus. Okay?

1746
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:26,187
I'm just going home.

1747
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:29,788
I'm just going home.

1748
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:31,493
Jesus.

1749
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:36,130
Where's Kimberly?

1750
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,698
She's not returning my calls.

1751
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:42,337
Tell her I waited on her.

1752
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:48,212
Tell her I love her.

1753
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:52,185
I love all of you.

1754
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:57,584
You got...

1755
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,151
You got to be strong.

1756
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:05,388
And all y'all got to come together.

1757
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:10,765
You gonna come together.

1758
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,272
- Mama.
- Mama. Mama.

1759
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:21,782
Shirley.

1760
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,483
I'll see you tomorrow morning, John.
Thank you.

1761
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,054
No, I had to visit my
mother at the hospital.

1762
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,754
I'm sure she's okay. Thank you so much.
I'll call you back. All right.

1763
01:25:31,593 --> 01:25:32,651
Where were you?

1764
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:36,188
I had things to do. This
is my family, Calvin.

1765
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:37,389
This is not your business.

1766
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:38,691
I called you for hours.

1767
01:25:38,867 --> 01:25:40,391
Yeah, I know. I got your message.

1768
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:43,703
What makes you think I would
return you or Tammy's calls?

1769
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:46,865
- Where is my mother?
- She's in 208. Listen...

1770
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:51,471
She died, Kimberly.

1771
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,117
What?

1772
01:25:57,118 --> 01:25:58,847
She... She died.

1773
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:12,096
Mama?

1774
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,431
Mama. Mama!

1775
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:24,378
No!

1776
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:30,578
No, no, no. Mama, I'm sorry.
Mama, I'm sorry!

1777
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:36,821
I've got to say, if we could
see Sister Shirley up in heaven,

1778
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,788
this is what Shirley would say.

1779
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:21,194
Come on, Sister Laura.

1780
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:12,374
Glory to God! Thank you, Father.

1781
01:29:50,952 --> 01:29:52,249
We sang it at the funeral.

1782
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:54,150
I don't want to hear, "This is your mommy."

1783
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:55,552
I could've had grandkids.

1784
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:57,055
I don't wanna hear that.
I don't wanna hear that.

1785
01:29:57,158 --> 01:30:00,286
At all. Please.
But I just wanna thank ya'll for coming.

1786
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:01,384
- It was a nice service.
- Yes.

1787
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:03,191
- Was it?
- Yes. Yeah.

1788
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:05,891
You should've came, Madea. That nice
dress, you should've came to the funeral.

1789
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:08,593
You know I ain't going to no funeral.
All that noise, that loud singing,

1790
01:30:08,703 --> 01:30:10,295
slow walking, working on my nerve, child.

1791
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,270
I can't be bothered with that.
People dead, they dead.

1792
01:30:12,373 --> 01:30:15,365
I ain't fittin' to be bothered with all
that. All right now. Good to see y'all.

1793
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:16,543
Are you okay?

1794
01:30:17,044 --> 01:30:19,342
My mother just died. What do you think?

1795
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,640
Look, I'm just trying to be here for you.

1796
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:22,306
Well, I don't want you to be here for me,
Calvin.

1797
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:23,975
- Kimberly.
- No. Please.

1798
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:26,118
Lord have mercy...

1799
01:30:27,021 --> 01:30:29,046
See, no, you better get her, Byron.

1800
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:33,526
Hey, stop that. Stop that. Stop that.
Hey, hey, hey. Stop it.

1801
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:34,695
Stop it. Stop it.

1802
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:37,060
Lord have mercy. It's always the same thing.

1803
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,169
Hey, hey! Shut the hell up!
Sound like a siren.

1804
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,199
Come in here and sit. Shut up!

1805
01:30:47,408 --> 01:30:49,035
Sit down, you black leprechaun,

1806
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:52,010
looking like you out of a box of
Chocolate Lucky Charms.

1807
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:53,876
Whole family. I'm sick of this.

1808
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:59,677
Now look here.
Your mama was a peaceful woman.

1809
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:02,779
She did not want all this foolishness.
She did the best she could with y'all,

1810
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:04,448
but all of y'all act like
y'all ain't got no sense.

1811
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:06,356
You, little leprechaun.
Let me tell you something...

1812
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:08,758
Stop using that baby to
make this man's life miserable.

1813
01:31:08,863 --> 01:31:09,830
That's right.

1814
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:12,061
I didn't ask for no amen from you.
I will punch...

1815
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:14,532
I will punch the hell out of you.
Say something else.

1816
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,764
The man don't want you.
He done moved the hell on.

1817
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:21,171
You can't get to what's in front of you,
'cause you're too busy looking

1818
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:23,766
to see what the hell he
doing with this girl. Move on.

1819
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:26,346
Stop or that child will grow up resenting
you for that. Do you hear me?

1820
01:31:26,447 --> 01:31:27,436
That is a human being.

1821
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:31,314
That is not some pawn that you can use
to make this man's life miserable.

1822
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:32,386
Stop doing it.

1823
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,284
'Cause if I catch you doing it,
I'm gonna beat the hell out of you.

1824
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:36,754
Do you understand? You don't know me.
You don't want none of this.

1825
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:38,052
This is old "whoop your ass."

1826
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:41,161
And old "whoop your ass" is much worse
than new "whoop your ass."

1827
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:44,493
New "whoop your ass" get up off you,
old "whoop your ass" have you in the grave.

1828
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:48,091
Do you want some old "whoop your ass"?
Do you want some old "whoop your ass"?

1829
01:31:51,539 --> 01:31:53,666
And you, out there selling dope.

1830
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,601
Yeah, she's a snitch.
She told me you out there selling dope,

1831
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:59,077
giving this girl all the money.
Can't give her $20 for some Pampers?

1832
01:31:59,213 --> 01:32:00,237
What the hell wrong with you?

1833
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:02,646
A man take care of his baby
without anybody telling him

1834
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:03,910
he need to take care of his baby.

1835
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:07,517
Get a job. Go to work.
Do you understand what I am telling you?

1836
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:10,282
Y'all them young folk, born around the '80s,
something happened to 'em.

1837
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,154
Y'all feel like y'all don't have to
work for nothing,

1838
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:14,556
somebody's supposed to hand
something to you,

1839
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:16,663
forgetting that old folks marched
for your dumb ass,

1840
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:18,595
to get you where you can be and to be free.

1841
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:20,360
That dope either gonna lead you to
one of two places:

1842
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:22,561
to the grave or to prison.
Now you've already been to prison.

1843
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:23,762
You ready to go back to jail?

1844
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,133
You ready to go to the grave?
Which one you want?

1845
01:32:25,473 --> 01:32:27,134
'Cause as soon as you go down,
this one right here

1846
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:28,367
is going to be sold to the highest bidder.

1847
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:30,944
All she looking for is some money.
Say something. I dare you.

1848
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:34,204
I double-D dare you to say something.

1849
01:32:36,017 --> 01:32:37,541
I'm gonna tell you right now,
I will be checking in with

1850
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:40,212
this side of the family from time to time.
And y'all better have it together.

1851
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:42,585
You two. You better be F. Lee Bailey,
you better be Johnnie Cochran.

1852
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:43,679
I want to see a settlement.

1853
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:44,951
I want to know
who's going to have the baby,

1854
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:46,253
who gonna pick him up,
who gonna have Pampers,

1855
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,418
when you gonna come
and give the child support,

1856
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:49,291
when is the money gonna be there.
You better write it all down.

1857
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:50,955
Do you hear what I'm tellin' you, son?

1858
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:53,331
Your mama did not want ya'll to know this.

1859
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:54,661
- Madea.
- Shut up.

1860
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:57,903
She wanted to keep this hidden from y'all,
but I'm gonna tell y'all.

1861
01:32:58,039 --> 01:33:00,098
You arguing and fussing with this girl,
she fussing.

1862
01:33:00,207 --> 01:33:02,107
She mad at the world.
Honey, you know why you be so mad?

1863
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:04,734
This child was raped by your uncle
at 12 years old.

1864
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:07,740
Anything that's covered up don't get healed.
That's what's wrong with people.

1865
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:10,817
Keep trying to cover things up,
and covered up. That don't help nobody.

1866
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:12,442
I can't stand nobody sitting around saying,

1867
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:14,520
"What goes on in this house stays in
this house."

1868
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:16,715
Let me explain something to you.
Whatever went on in that house,

1869
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:19,190
if you're getting hurt by it
and it's tearing you up in your adult life,

1870
01:33:19,293 --> 01:33:20,260
you need to go get some help.

1871
01:33:20,494 --> 01:33:22,462
This man is trying to love you
and you acting like a fool.

1872
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:25,031
Always grouchy and mean.
And the reason you so nasty, honey,

1873
01:33:25,132 --> 01:33:26,690
you ain't forgave the man that raped you.

1874
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:29,300
You got to forgive those people, honey.
Not for them, but for you.

1875
01:33:29,403 --> 01:33:31,098
If you don't, they take power over you.

1876
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:33,673
Do you hear me?
Forgive him for your own sake.

1877
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,099
This man is trying to love you.

1878
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:36,676
Go talk to him, act like you got some sense.

1879
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:39,871
Go on upstairs and talk to the man.
Go on, talk to him.

1880
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:08,366
You know, my mama used to
rock me to sleep in here.

1881
01:34:10,578 --> 01:34:11,567
At the hospital,

1882
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:17,982
she told me to tell you that she loved you.

1883
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:23,350
And that she was sorry
and she felt like she failed you.

1884
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:27,861
She said that?

1885
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:32,127
Yeah. Baby, why didn't you tell me?

1886
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,068
I didn't know how.

1887
01:34:36,704 --> 01:34:39,104
I want to hold you. Can I?

1888
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:41,508
Please.

1889
01:34:44,478 --> 01:34:46,070
We're going to get some help.

1890
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:48,715
I love you.

1891
01:34:52,053 --> 01:34:54,283
I love you. I'm so sorry.

1892
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:57,323
- Baby, I love you.
- I'm so sorry, baby.

1893
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,194
Come on, baby, let's go.
Roscoe's waiting for you.

1894
01:35:02,296 --> 01:35:04,264
- I'm not doing it.
- You... What?

1895
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:05,992
I'm not doing it.

1896
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,631
Byron, we need the money.

1897
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:10,262
Listen, I don't need the money that bad.
All right?

1898
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:12,730
Get some heart, Byron. Damn.

1899
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:16,104
Are you really gonna sit up here
and let that old lady tell you what to do?

1900
01:35:16,944 --> 01:35:19,469
- We need the money, Byron.
- Listen to me.

1901
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:24,749
I just buried my mother today and you
wanna come in and you wanna talk...

1902
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:30,185
You know what, move.

1903
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:35,887
Get out, get out.

1904
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:40,995
- Fine. With your broke ass.
- Yeah.

1905
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:46,873
I ain't need you anyway.

1906
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:50,874
I'm so glad you here.

1907
01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:52,468
That's right.
They don't even know what to say.

1908
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,013
I told you, I told you.

1909
01:35:54,682 --> 01:35:55,649
What's wrong with you?

1910
01:35:56,150 --> 01:35:57,845
It's nice what you did
for this family, Madea.

1911
01:35:58,052 --> 01:35:59,417
- Yes, it is. Praise the Lord.
- It is.

1912
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,312
But you can't even do it
for your own daughter.

1913
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:05,192
- Did she just go off on me?
- Sound like she did.

1914
01:36:05,459 --> 01:36:06,551
What you talking about, Cora?

1915
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:09,192
My daddy, Madea.
You don't even know who...

1916
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:12,163
That is your daddy,
that silverback standing over there.

1917
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:14,063
Madea... Well, prove it, then. Prove it.

1918
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:16,296
- Prove it, then?
- Yes. Prove it to me.

1919
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:18,064
How the hell I'm supposed
to prove it to you?

1920
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:19,769
Prove it. Yes.

1921
01:36:21,742 --> 01:36:23,107
How you doing, Marley Kovitch?

1922
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:26,873
Yeah. Okay. Nice to see you, Mr. Brown.
I know this is very upsetting to you.

1923
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:28,809
- Yes, sir.
- 'Cause after all these years,

1924
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:32,010
you're gonna find out
whether Brown is your father.

1925
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:35,812
All these years,
I just found out he was my daddy.

1926
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,780
And now she's trying to say that...

1927
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:41,085
And Cora look just like me.
Tell me she don't look just like me.

1928
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:43,787
- Really?
- Yes. Look at her eyes.

1929
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:48,261
You can't tell me her eyes and her hair...
Well, she didn't comb her hair that day.

1930
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:50,701
But she look just like me, Marley.

1931
01:36:51,172 --> 01:36:54,266
So, Cora, when you were growing up,
who did you think your father was?

1932
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:56,536
I didn't know, Maury. I didn't know.

1933
01:36:56,744 --> 01:37:01,181
But Mr. Brown always acted like my father,
so it came easy once Madea told me.

1934
01:37:01,415 --> 01:37:02,814
When did Madea tell you?

1935
01:37:03,417 --> 01:37:04,884
I was, like, 40-something.

1936
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:06,782
- Forty-something?
- Yes.

1937
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:09,751
- Okay, you all have
talked a lot about this. - Yeah.

1938
01:37:09,857 --> 01:37:11,848
But we haven't heard from Madea.

1939
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:14,391
And this is what Madea had to say
to my producers.

1940
01:37:14,728 --> 01:37:18,528
<i>Brown is a lowdown dirty...</i>
<i>He is a liar, he is a cheater.</i>

1941
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:20,566
<i>He ain't never did</i>
<i>like he was supposed to do for Cora.</i>

1942
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:22,101
<i>He gonna act like he...</i>
<i>He wanted to act like</i>

1943
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:24,194
<i>he done went to the doctor</i>
<i>and found out he ain't the baby daddy.</i>

1944
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:26,330
<i>He is the baby daddy.</i>
<i>And I'm gonna tell you right now, Maury,</i>

1945
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,067
<i>I'm gonna tell you right now</i>
<i>I know that's the baby daddy.</i>

1946
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:30,939
<i>'Cause that is the only baby daddy</i>
<i>that I had a baby daddy with.</i>

1947
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:32,945
<i>He is the baby daddy.</i>
<i>If he ain't the baby daddy...</i>

1948
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:34,639
<i>I know he's the baby</i>
<i>daddy 'cause I know...</i>

1949
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:36,511
<i>I know that was the worst</i>
<i>15 seconds of my life.</i>

1950
01:37:36,617 --> 01:37:38,983
<i>So I know that's the baby daddy.</i>
<i>You ain't even got to worry about,</i>

1951
01:37:39,086 --> 01:37:41,611
<i>'cause I know that was the baby daddy.</i>
<i>Cora ain't got to figure it out.</i>

1952
01:37:41,722 --> 01:37:43,781
<i>But when I go up there,</i>
<i>I'm gonna show... I'm gonna say it all.</i>

1953
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:45,552
<i>'Cause he's so damn stupid,</i>
<i>he don't even want nobody</i>

1954
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:47,058
<i>to tell nobody</i>
<i>what the hell he's supposed to do.</i>

1955
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:48,128
<i>But I know that's the baby daddy.</i>

1956
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:49,924
<i>Y'all ain't gotta tell me,</i>
<i>'cause I know that's the baby daddy.</i>

1957
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:51,998
<i>I can't wait till I get up in there.</i>
<i>When I get on that stage,</i>

1958
01:37:52,099 --> 01:37:53,464
<i>I'm gonna tell Maury all the truth.</i>

1959
01:37:53,767 --> 01:37:56,861
So why don't we just meet her?
Everybody, here's Madea.

1960
01:37:56,971 --> 01:37:57,960
Madea, come on out.

1961
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,072
Bring her out here, Marley.
Bring her out here, Marley.

1962
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:05,407
- Madea, nice to see you.
- How you doing, Maury?

1963
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:07,737
I've been trying to tell you,
you are the daddy.

1964
01:38:07,848 --> 01:38:11,443
You the daddy, you the daddy.
That's your baby. This is your baby.

1965
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:12,710
Madea!

1966
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:15,488
- That's your baby! That's your baby!
- Madea! Madea!

1967
01:38:15,589 --> 01:38:17,887
That's your baby! That's your baby!

1968
01:38:18,058 --> 01:38:20,026
- That's your baby!
- Please! Madea, sit down.

1969
01:38:20,127 --> 01:38:21,219
- Please, Madea.
- Okay.

1970
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:26,131
Why did you wait until Cora was in her 40s
to tell her who her father was?

1971
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:27,632
That's because she dumb.

1972
01:38:28,002 --> 01:38:29,629
- What?
- Rum-dum-di-di dumb.

1973
01:38:30,337 --> 01:38:33,363
Say one more thing. Say one more... thing.

1974
01:38:34,508 --> 01:38:35,770
- Madea, please.
- You got one more time.

1975
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:39,537
Now, I didn't tell her, I didn't tell her
'cause it wasn't important.

1976
01:38:40,247 --> 01:38:41,407
I took care of her.

1977
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:44,116
I gave her everything she needed.
She didn't need to know.

1978
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:46,215
She did not even need to know
who her daddy was.

1979
01:38:46,487 --> 01:38:51,550
I'm more interested now in Cora,
and having both of her parents in her life.

1980
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:52,683
- That's right. That's right.
- Yeah.

1981
01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:54,384
I don't know why.
Hell, she ain't five years old.

1982
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:56,963
I don't even know why, Cora,
you all got me on this... television.

1983
01:38:57,131 --> 01:38:58,758
Acting like you ain't got no...

1984
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:01,501
And I... You said...

1985
01:39:01,835 --> 01:39:03,268
I know, Madea, who my...

1986
01:39:08,809 --> 01:39:12,006
...say that, Madea. Don't be like that.

1987
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,348
Right, this the father. He is the father.
You are the father.

1988
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:17,380
- You are the father. You are the father.
- Okay, now, wait a minute.

1989
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:19,347
You are the father. You are the father.

1990
01:39:19,553 --> 01:39:20,679
- You are the father.
- Madea!

1991
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:23,018
- You are the... father.
- Madea!

1992
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:27,292
- Sit out here with all the...
- There's only one way to settle this.

1993
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:29,595
Yeah, let's figure it out.
Bring it on, Maury. Bring it on.

1994
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:31,028
- We're gonna have the answer right here.
- Bring it on.

1995
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:34,965
He the daddy. You the daddy.
You the daddy. You the daddy.

1996
01:39:35,102 --> 01:39:37,798
You the daddy. Tell him, tell him, Maury.
Tell him. You are the father.

1997
01:39:37,905 --> 01:39:38,894
Tell him, Maury. Tell him.

1998
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:41,702
In the case of
58-year-old Cora Jean Simmons,

1999
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:45,440
Brown, you are not the father.

2000
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:53,485
- Madea!
- Madea, why'd you have to do this to me?

2001
01:39:55,255 --> 01:39:57,655
Madea! Don't do that. Don't do that.

2002
01:39:57,758 --> 01:40:00,352
Don't embarrass yourself
on my show, Madea.

2003
01:40:00,594 --> 01:40:02,926
- Madea, Madea, Madea.
- I thought he was the daddy, Maury!

2004
01:40:03,197 --> 01:40:04,858
- I thought he was the daddy, Maury!
- No, no, no.

2005
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:08,100
- <i>I thought he was the daddy, Maury!</i>
- <i>He's not the father.</i>

2006
01:40:08,202 --> 01:40:11,433
Call 1-800-Choke-That-Ho. I like that.

2007
01:40:11,638 --> 01:40:14,766
<i>I'm a ho, Maury.</i>
<i>I'm just a no-good ho, Maury.</i>

2008
01:40:14,942 --> 01:40:15,909
Marker.

2009
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:18,742
Doc, are those your real eyes
or them contacts?

2010
01:40:18,979 --> 01:40:19,946
They're real.

2011
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:21,378
- What?
- Yes, sir.

2012
01:40:21,815 --> 01:40:24,409
Doctor, are those your eyes?
Are those your eyes?

2013
01:40:24,585 --> 01:40:26,712
- Yes, sir, they are.
- What?

2014
01:40:27,221 --> 01:40:28,882
You look like an albilo.

2015
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:33,383
This could be the last time
that you get to hold me.

2016
01:40:33,594 --> 01:40:35,687
- Just...
- Madea!

2017
01:40:36,597 --> 01:40:37,564
What the...

2018
01:40:38,499 --> 01:40:40,967
- I think I broke my...
- Let's do the slap again.

2019
01:40:41,235 --> 01:40:44,295
Come on, reset. I'm getting warmed up.

2020
01:40:46,407 --> 01:40:49,968
Mabel, I went to the doctor and they say
I'm dying. I ain't got but a week left.

2021
01:40:50,177 --> 01:40:51,405
You are not dying, Mr. Brown.

2022
01:40:51,512 --> 01:40:53,480
You had a colonoscopy
and they found a growth

2023
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:55,172
and they wanna remove it and do a biopsy.

2024
01:40:55,282 --> 01:40:56,476
Cora, you don't know
what you're talking about.

2025
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:58,107
- You ain't no doctor.
- That's what he said.

2026
01:40:58,252 --> 01:41:00,618
- That ain't what he said. You a doctor?
- It is.

2027
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:03,889
That's what I thought. You ain't no doctor
so you don't know doctor stuff.

2028
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:07,322
Shut up! Heller? Yes. Hold on.

2029
01:41:07,428 --> 01:41:09,362
Kirk Franklin's calling you.
He wants you back.

2030
01:41:10,097 --> 01:41:11,064
All right, we cut.

2031
01:41:13,267 --> 01:41:14,700
And don't be so sad.

2032
01:41:14,935 --> 01:41:17,665
You're subject to walk out of here
and get hit by a bus.

2033
01:41:17,771 --> 01:41:19,295
You never know, baby.

2034
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:23,809
That bus will run right over you,
just splatter you all over the pavement.

2035
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:25,742
Honey, it could be ugly.

2036
01:41:25,846 --> 01:41:28,314
God does things like that.
You just never know.

2037
01:41:28,415 --> 01:41:30,246
But thank you so much.

2038
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:32,345
We cut.

2039
01:41:33,654 --> 01:41:36,179
And I ain't finding out what he done
found out because he don't wanna...

2040
01:41:38,358 --> 01:41:40,417
- Good he found out.
- Yes, good he found out.

2041
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:42,586
Because once you find out
what you didn't find out

2042
01:41:42,729 --> 01:41:43,889
then you'd know what you didn't know.

2043
01:41:43,997 --> 01:41:45,521
And once you know what you don't know

2044
01:41:45,632 --> 01:41:47,463
then it don't make no difference
what you don't know no more,

2045
01:41:47,568 --> 01:41:49,365
'cause then you don't find out
what you didn't know.

2046
01:41:49,470 --> 01:41:50,903
And once you found out
what you don't know...

2047
01:41:51,004 --> 01:41:51,971
- Bam, Bam.
...it makes no difference

2048
01:41:52,072 --> 01:41:53,471
...what you didn't know no more.
- Bam.

2049
01:41:53,574 --> 01:41:54,598
Because when you find out...

2050
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:56,505
- Bam.
...then you can know what...

2051
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:59,078
Some smoking weed, Bam.
Stop smoking all that damn weed.

2052
01:41:59,179 --> 01:42:00,510
- Let me tell you something.
- We cut.

2053
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:02,013
- Oh, y'all...
- Cut.

2054
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:05,017
Who's gonna pass us that?

2055
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:07,587
Your lazy ass won't even get up
and go get the food and bring it down...

2056
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:09,155
I'm not gonna get that. Harold!

2057
01:42:10,724 --> 01:42:12,749
Bam, you gonna call Harold
to bring the food down here?

2058
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:15,090
- At least somebody.
- That's lazy as hell.

2059
01:42:15,195 --> 01:42:16,992
Well, what do you want me to do?
Get up and get it?

2060
01:42:17,097 --> 01:42:19,292
Yes. Because I sure in
hell ain't gonna get it.

2061
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:22,931
H.J., come here. Come here.

2062
01:42:23,036 --> 01:42:24,401
I got... This what children are for here.

2063
01:42:24,505 --> 01:42:26,268
That's why you don't buy a remote control,
you have children.

2064
01:42:26,373 --> 01:42:27,362
- That's right.
- Yeah. That's why

2065
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:29,465
you don't need vacuum cleaners or nothing.
Children do all that.

2066
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:31,942
Well, they got two of them.
You use one, I use the other one.

2067
01:42:32,045 --> 01:42:34,070
- Yeah, okay. Which one do you want?
- I want that little one.

2068
01:42:34,181 --> 01:42:35,739
Bring the food out. We cut.

2069
01:42:55,102 --> 01:42:56,797
We cut. Did you get it?

2070
01:42:58,172 --> 01:42:59,332
Sit down!

2071
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:02,108
Sittin' there like you on a horse.

2072
01:43:03,110 --> 01:43:06,170
Let me tell all of you something,
and I want to make this clear.

2073
01:43:08,582 --> 01:43:10,049
If your mama ain't here

2074
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:13,586
then your Daddy gonna tell you
what you need to do.

2075
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:14,745
What?

2076
01:43:15,222 --> 01:43:16,280
Cut.

2077
01:43:16,723 --> 01:43:18,020
...tell you what's going on.
- What?

2078
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:22,994
You found out that this was your daughter
just like recently?

2079
01:43:23,096 --> 01:43:24,290
- Yes.
- Yes.

2080
01:43:24,398 --> 01:43:25,490
- I was 40-something.
- It was terrible.

2081
01:43:25,599 --> 01:43:26,588
What was that like?

2082
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:29,601
I was happy, you know, but I was sad.

2083
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:31,637
'Cause it was the best thing
that ever happened.

2084
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:33,000
Why was you sad, Cora?

2085
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:36,803
Because, at first,
I didn't want it to be him to be my daddy.

2086
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:38,400
- Why?
- But then...

2087
01:43:38,512 --> 01:43:41,106
Because, you know, look at him.
But he wound up being...

2088
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:43,376
- Cora, look at you.
- It worked out.

2089
01:43:43,483 --> 01:43:44,882
You ain't no catch either.

2090
01:43:44,985 --> 01:43:47,112
Cora, I'm trying to help, do you a favor.

2091
01:43:47,955 --> 01:43:51,288
But what did Madea tell you all your life
about your father?

2092
01:43:51,391 --> 01:43:52,449
Like you better than me.

2093
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:53,856
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

2094
01:43:53,961 --> 01:43:55,326
My security people, please.

2095
01:43:55,429 --> 01:43:57,624
Ain't nobody scared of no security.
Because I can take them...

2096
01:43:57,731 --> 01:44:01,189
Don't touch me. I will bust you in your head
with this hammer. Back the hell up.

2097
01:44:01,301 --> 01:44:02,290
- Madea, please.
- I'm not scared.

2098
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:03,767
I will bust you in your head
with this hammer.

2099
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:04,859
- Madea, please.
- Ma'am, come on.

2100
01:44:04,972 --> 01:44:07,406
We're not gonna stand for that on this show.
Come on now.

2101
01:44:07,507 --> 01:44:08,769
I don't wanna sit by her!

2102
01:44:08,875 --> 01:44:11,070
Get out of the way.
You're in front of the camera. Move.

2103
01:44:11,178 --> 01:44:13,237
- Okay. Just sit down here.
- I ain't gonna sit down.

2104
01:44:13,347 --> 01:44:15,076
You're in front of the camera.
Get your ass out of the way

2105
01:44:15,182 --> 01:44:16,774
...is what I'm telling you.
- Madea.

2106
01:44:16,883 --> 01:44:18,646
- She's telling you to slide over.
- Hey, you still ain't moving.

2107
01:44:18,752 --> 01:44:19,810
You're in the way.

2108
01:44:21,555 --> 01:44:24,319
I'm serious.
Your ass is in front of the camera. Move.

2109
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:30,896
All right. Y'all go on, now, go on.
Get the hell off the stage.

2110
01:44:30,998 --> 01:44:31,965
Y'all extras.

2111
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:35,762
Why did you wait until Cora was in her 40s
to tell her who her father was?

2112
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:36,961
That's because she's dumb.

2113
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:40,039
I didn't tell her because
it wasn't important.

2114
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:43,899
It was not important to her.

2115
01:44:44,011 --> 01:44:46,605
Because I took care of her.

2116
01:44:46,713 --> 01:44:48,908
- You were like father and mother?
- Yeah.

2117
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:50,108
And...

2118
01:44:50,584 --> 01:44:55,112
- I ain't never hit no woman,
but I'm gonna... - No, no, no, no, no!

2119
01:44:55,222 --> 01:44:57,520
- No, let me, let me...
- No, no, no!

2120
01:44:57,658 --> 01:44:59,523
No, we can't have that on my show.

2121
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:03,853
- I love you, man.
- I know. Oh, gentle. Mr. Brown, I know.

2122
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:07,495
- I know. I know. I know.
- I'm having a nervous breakdown.

2123
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:09,067
I want you to be my daddy.

2124
01:45:09,169 --> 01:45:11,000
But I want to be your man now.

2125
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:12,696
What? Now what...

2126
01:45:14,207 --> 01:45:16,175
Thank you for coming to this movie.
