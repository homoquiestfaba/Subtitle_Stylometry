(LEECH SNARLS)

1514
01:24:37,529 --> 01:24:39,121
(ALL SCREAMING)

1515
01:24:39,264 --> 01:24:40,390
(GRUNTS)

1516
01:24:40,498 --> 01:24:44,935
- Hutch, are you okay?
- My sister's femi-necklace.

1517
01:24:45,036 --> 01:24:46,060
What?

1518
01:24:46,938 --> 01:24:48,166
(GROANS)

1519
01:24:48,439 --> 01:24:50,964
Hey, how come I can't
read your thoughts anymore?

1520
01:24:51,075 --> 01:24:52,201
(GRUNTS)

1521
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:56,440
I shall avenge you, Hutch Waterfall.

1522
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:59,949
(SCREAMS)

1523
01:25:01,452 --> 01:25:06,048
After all these eons,
the Dark Ones are no more.

1524
01:25:06,157 --> 01:25:10,617
Will you preserve their
DNA, O Great Encyclopod?

1525
01:25:12,096 --> 01:25:15,395
I suppose I should.
Wait, where did it go?

1526
01:25:16,267 --> 01:25:17,734
(SLURPING)

1527
01:25:19,103 --> 01:25:20,070
What?

1528
01:25:20,338 --> 01:25:25,071
Well, at any rate, I shall
preserve the DNA of <i>Homo sapiens.</i>

1529
01:25:31,182 --> 01:25:34,276
I thought you only saved the
DNA of endangered species.

1530
01:25:34,385 --> 01:25:35,352
Farewell.

1531
01:25:37,689 --> 01:25:38,883
I guess he didn't hear me.

1532
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:43,051
Well, looks like that wraps everything
up in a nice big, old, fat sack of...

1533
01:25:43,161 --> 01:25:47,894
I hereby arrest you
fugitives on 53 counts of fugivity.

1534
01:25:47,999 --> 01:25:51,491
Kif, round them up,
and spare me the weary sigh for once.

1535
01:25:52,337 --> 01:25:53,304
Kif.

1536
01:25:54,205 --> 01:25:55,570
KIF: Wait for me.

1537
01:26:09,087 --> 01:26:13,285
Well, this is the end. There was so
many things I wanted to say to you.

1538
01:26:13,391 --> 01:26:14,858
Like what?

1539
01:26:14,959 --> 01:26:18,986
Like this is not the end.
But mostly just, I love you, Leela.

1540
01:26:19,097 --> 01:26:21,258
(LOUD BANG)

1541
01:26:21,432 --> 01:26:26,460
Maybe I waited too long to say this,
but I love you, too. Wormhole!

1542
01:26:27,705 --> 01:26:31,197
Sweet topology of
cosmology, it's huge!

1543
01:26:31,309 --> 01:26:35,837
If we fly into it, it could take
us trillions of light years away.

1544
01:26:35,947 --> 01:26:38,472
There's no knowing if we'll ever return.

1545
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:40,949
What do we do?
Should we go for it?

1546
01:26:44,589 --> 01:26:48,821
Into the breach, meatbags.
Or not. Whatever.

1547
01:26:48,926 --> 01:26:51,952
ALL: Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

1548
01:26:52,063 --> 01:26:54,554
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.
