00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,383
(Dog barking)

4
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,463
(Driller whirring)

00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,593

00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,789

10
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,711
(Chair squeaks)

11
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,718
You got sad eyes.

12
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,890
Not my usual pick-up line, but...

13
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:30,771
I just sensed you are a man
running from shadows.

14
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,818
What's your usual pick-up line?

15
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,907
When I see a guy
alone at the bar

16
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,117
at 3:00 in the morning,

17
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:49,456
I lean in real close
and whisper in his ear:

18
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:54,127
"For 510 bucks,
we can spend an hour.

19
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,297
For 1,000,
we can spend a night."

20
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,592
Why 510?

21
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:07,099
'Cause the ATM
only spits out 20s.

22
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:11,520
I've never had a john ask me
to break a note.

23
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,691
That's actually smart.

24
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,780
So?

25
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,450
(Indistinct chatter
in background)

26
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,413

(Indistinct chatter)

30
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,187
See that?

31
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,570
(Grunts)

32
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,991
FREEMAN:
Gasoline Alley...

33
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,451
Jimmy Jayne.

37
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,036
JIMMY:
You sure about this?

38
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,830
YOUNG WOMAN:
I'm sure, I'm sure.

39
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,125
Okay.

40
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,053
Okay.

41
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,515
Who's Shelby?

42
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,143
She rocks my world.

43
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,895
You're a lucky gal.

44
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,938
Yeah, we both are.

45
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,273
Right there?

46
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,194
Hold on.

47
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,076
James Jayne?

48
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,536
Yeah.

49
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,455
That's what it says
on my license.

50
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,625
Detective Freeman.

51
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,627
This is Detective Vargas.

52
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,878
Hi.

53
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,087
JIMMY:
Okay.

54
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,466
Yeah, your old man
was on the force, wasn't he?

55
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,134
14th precinct.

56
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,803
Hmm, how's he doing?

57
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,224
I don't think
he's doing much of anything.

58
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,976
Spends his days
at the Fitzgerald Cemetery.

59
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,061
He was a good cop.

60
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,479
Damn good cop.

61
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,272
Always paid his tab.

62
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,400
Did you ever consider the force?

63
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:47,236
Yeah. You ever think about it?

64
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,571
No, never.

65
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,496
That's yours, right?

66
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,123
I mean, it's my shop's lighter.

67
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,208
Right.

68
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:05,128
James... sorry,
may I call you, "James"?

69
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,965
The reason that we're here
is we need to talk to you

70
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,758
about the four dead girls.

71
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:10,968
Okay?

72
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,845
What's that have to do with me?

73
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:16,223
The lighter,
it was found at the crime scene.

74
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,599
What's your point?

75
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,435
What was it doing there?

76
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,187
I don't know what it's fucking
doing there.

77
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,274
I once found my lighter floating
in a urinal at a Duke's.

78
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,652
Am I a suspect?

79
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,862
VARGAS: You were seen
with one of the victims

80
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,029
at Rocka's, okay.

81
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,531
Thing about Rocka's,

82
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,157
it's over on the other side
of town

83
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,784
and there are 100
good watering holes

84
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,035
in between here and there,
right?

85
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:37,995
Yeah.

86
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,205
Yeah, again, again,
what's your point?

87
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,959
My point is why drive
all the way over there

88
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,503
like I was saying,
it's a long ways away.

89
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,964
Sentimental reasons.

90
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,632
VARGAS:
Such as?

91
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,261
My mother used to work there.

92
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,055
Okay. Behind the bar?

93
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,515
No, not behind the bar.

94
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,808
Oh.

95
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,227
Uh, Jimmy, excuse my partner.

96
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:06,148
He still doesn't know what side
of the bed to wake up on.

97
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,107
VARGAS:
He's right.

98
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,525
We have some photos,

99
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,612
maybe you could uh, ID
some of the victims.

100
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:12,779
That'd be helpful.

101
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,698
Holy shit,
you don't even know their names.

102
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,951
James, we're gonna need to talk
to you in private, okay?

103
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,453
The sooner, the better.

104
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,331
All right, give me an hour.
I got a customer.

105
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,333
No, we need to talk to you
right now,

106
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,877
so the tramp stamp
will have to wait.

107
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,504
How you doin', darlin'?

108
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,255
What you gonna get, a unicorn?

109
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,381
(Chuckles)

110
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,845
(♪♪♪)

111
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,230
FREEMAN:
I hope you can be discrete.

112
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,443
Last thing we need
is a media circus.

113
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:54,488
Yeah, he's right,
'cause if that happens,

114
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,907
then the D.A.,
he puts pressure on us

115
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,993
to pin it on some poor schmuck.

116
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,538
All right. I'll go ahead
and get started, right, boss?

117
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,206
- Yes.
- Okay.

118
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,918
For the record,
I'm Detective Vargas.

119
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:09,711
That's Detective Freeman.

120
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,255
And we're conducting
an interview

121
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:17,261
with Mr. James Jayne
concerning case V-7-7-4-3.

122
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,846
They suffer?

123
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,180
What do you think?

124
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,640
I think it's a fair
fucking question,

125
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,850
that's what I think.

126
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,143
Yeah, they suffered.

127
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,856
I imagine
you already questioned

128
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,649
the guests, staff?

129
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,318
Since 5:00 a.m. this morning.

130
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,362
63 rooms.

131
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,614
VARGAS:
Yeah, nobody suspicious.

132
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:41,660
Nobody caught our attention,
except you.

133
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,872
Security cameras?

134
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,541
They didn't have any
at the rat trap

135
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,542
they found 'em at,

136
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,794
but they're on camera
leaving the bar.

137
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,255
Then you're on camera
a few seconds later

138
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,465
following 'em out the door.

139
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,551
I had a drink, and I left.

140
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:58,635
FREEMAN:
What time?

141
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,096
2:30. Give or take.

142
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,973
Talk to anybody
while you were there?

143
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,350
JIMMY:
Yeah.

144
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,727
VARGAS:
What were you doing there?

145
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,395
(Sighs) I was fucking guys.

146
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,564
- FREEMAN: Easy.
- It's just juries,

147
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,734
they don't look real favorably
on uncooperative witnesses.

148
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,153
- Right?
- Right.

149
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,988
Look, why don't you just
show me the pictures?

150
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,531
'Cause something tells me
somebody told you

151
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,158
I was with the girls that night.

152
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,743
You want to see the pictures?

153
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,745
Sure,
we'll show you the pictures.

154
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,624
Pretty sordid.

155
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,752
Let me just start back
at the beginning here.

156
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,295
Here we go.

157
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,881
Huh, pretty gnarly, right?

158
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:37,174
Gnarly?

159
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,926
Recognize any of them?

160
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:44,973
Boom, boom, boom,
what you think?

161
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,226
That's pretty bad.

162
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,477
JIMMY:
Go back.

163
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,731
- That's Star.
- VARGAS: Huh.

164
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,816
JIMMY: That's what she told me
her name was.

165
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,860
You ever seen
these girls before?

166
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,863
Not before last night.

167
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:03,116
You talked to Star,
what about?

168
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,993
- Business.
- What?

169
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,412
- Business.
- Tattoos or movies?

170
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,914
JIMMY:
She was an actor.

171
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,874
Aspiring actor.

172
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,418
Am I the only suspect?

173
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,379
FREEMAN:
Person of interest.

174
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,508
VARGAS: So Star, I'm assuming
she was a working girl.

175
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:20,884
Yeah.

176
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:22,803
Did she make you an offer?

177
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,430
JIMMY:
Of course she did.

178
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:26,765
VARGAS:
Did you take her up on it?

179
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,100
Or did you try and bargain
with her?

180
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,060
Maybe when you tried
to bargain with her,

181
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,229
you kind of made her feel
a little cheap...

182
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,188
JIMMY:
Fucking what?

183
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:35,023
VARGAS: Then she said
something nasty, who knows?

184
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,900
Maybe that hurt your feelings,
and then you thought,

185
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:37,943
"Hey, I'm really gonna let her have it."

186
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,736
- (Overlapping speech)
- Double fucking talk.

187
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,321
Did you hook up with her?

188
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,159
No. I told her I was meeting
with somebody after.

189
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,703
FREEMAN:
And who is that?

190
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,163
This girl I run around with. Christine.

191
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,207
- Okay.
- Are we done here?

192
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,668
No. So I'm just trying to get
all this straight in my head,

193
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,170
- maybe you can help me, boss?
- Yeah.

194
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,173
- So the bar, it closes at 2:30.
- FREEMAN: Right.

195
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,675
VARGAS: That gives you 45 minutes
to kill 'em.

196
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:02,801
Stage 'em.

197
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:06,263
Then mosey on over
to this Christine girl.

198
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,099
And you asked,
"Did they suffer?"

199
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,559
Their necks were broken.

200
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:11,810
All four of 'em.

201
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:13,896
Of course,
that's not real difficult.

202
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,357
When you got poor helpless girls
all whacked out on

203
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,777
junk and blow,
God knows what else.

204
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,239
Now the only
suspect description we got

205
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:27,326
is of a Caucasian shitkicker.

206
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,411
You seen any of those lately?

207
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,040
Get the fuck out of my shop.

208
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,666
I actually think we're done here

209
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,919
and we probably don't need
to tell you this,

210
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:40,464
but don't leave the country,
hell, don't leave the county.

211
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,341
We can haul you in
on a Ramey warrant

212
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,467
anytime, okay.

213
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,303
So yeah, you're still a suspect,
got it?

214
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,847
Don't worry,
if you get found guilty,

215
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,433
we'll walk you down
to the electric chair ourselves.

216
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:52,768
It's like that
old gospel number,

217
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,269
You'll Never Walk Alone.

218
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:55,270
Let's hit it, boss.

219
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:56,647
Good talking to you.

220
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,362
Nice spot.

221
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,203

222
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,540

(Indistinct chatter
in background)

224
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:28,470
Christine.

225
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,097
Hey.

226
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,892
One sec, come here.

227
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,732
You get my text?

228
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,070
Cops calling on me at work
ain't a good look, Jimmy.

229
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,532
They wanted to confirm you
were on your way to see me

230
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,825
last night.

231
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,786
What'd you say?

232
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,329
I told 'em, yeah.

233
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,624
The bald one,
he thought I'd be all bent

234
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,294
about you flirting
with those poor girls.

235
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:04,047
I told 'em, nah,
it ain't like that.

236
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:08,427
He flirts with everybody,
that's what makes him Jimmy.

237
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:10,888
Attagirl.

238
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,472
The other one,

239
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,893
he acts all best friends
bonding shit,

240
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,604
wasn't shy about doing
a little flirting himself.

241
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,190
Fuckin' asshole.

242
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,860
(Laughter, chatter
in background)

243
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,129
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

244
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,089
Whoa, whoa.

245
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:47,424
- Oh God.
- Whoa.

246
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,843

You're in the scene, right?

320
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,803
I do okay. It's not really
your vibe though,

if that's what you're asking.

322
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,641
Don't use that tone of voice
with me.

Remember who kept you safe
on the inside.

324

Yeah, I know.

325
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:55,399
You know how grateful I am that
you protected me

00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,483
when I was in there.

327
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,113
I bet your friends think
you're tough

328
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:04,741
doing three months hard time

I wonder what they'd say
if they find out

330
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,205
you cried yourself
to sleep every night

331
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,583
worried Kratos from Cell Block E
was gonna make you

332

333
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,378

that you fucked him up for me.

334
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,506
How grateful?

335
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,552

Come on.

342
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,696

00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:47,034
The writer's PA with the fat ass

That is tasteless.

346

I knew one of 'em.

347
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,539
From where?

348
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,000
Some party.

349
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:56,668
Whose?

350
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:00,047
Persi Muleeney, something.

351
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,424
Get the fuck outta here.
That's a made-up name.

352
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,593
I swear to God, man,
she was all over me.

353
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,595
What was her name?

354
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,555
BOURKE: She didn't tell me
her real name.

355
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:10,557
Don't tell me.

00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:12,059

"...you just gotta look up."

358
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,853
- JIMMY: Yeah.
- BOURKE: You knew Star?

359
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:16,063
Briefly.

360
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,815
Tell me about the guy
running the party.

361
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,443
BOURKE: Persi? I... I didn't know
it was his party.

362
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,530
Finds girls on OnlyFans
and Craigslist,

363
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,782
turns 'em into porn stars
and escorts.

364
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,076
They float around the scene
for a little bit

365
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,994
then they just disappear,
that's all I know.

366
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,412
What do you mean disappear?

367
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:34,164
BOURKE: I mean they go back
to bumfuck Idaho

368
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,541
wherever the hell
they came from.

369
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,211
Man, this J-bird
fucking with you?

370
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:41,380
No, man, we're all right,
aren't we?

371
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,716
- Are we?
- Yeah, we're good.

372
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:46,009
BOURKE:
This is Jimmy Jayne.

373
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,678
This guy's a motherfucking
legend right here.

374
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:48,929
- True genius.
- Pleasure to meet you.

375
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,098
Oh, so you guys inside together?

376
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:53,267
- How'd you know?
- Come on, man.

377
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,269
'Cause all your other friends
that come here,

378
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,562
look like Ken dolls.

379
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,021
No offense.

380
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,189
BOURKE: Yeah, fucking right
we were in.

381
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:00,941
This dude did half the art
in San Quentin.

382
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,192
Why don't you tell him
about the time

383
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:03,902
I fucked up Kratos in the yard?

384
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:05,195
You know the story.

385
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:09,241
Yeah, I remember that, sure.

386
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,662
He was uh... he was fresh meat.

387
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,539
Wouldn't let anybody
fuck with him, so he beat a man

388
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,250
unconscious on his first night
with his bare hands.

389
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:19,918
Yeah.

390
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:21,295
Bullshit.

391
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:24,256
- That's a fucking lie.
- It's a lie.

392
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:25,966
ROY:
Hey, but you're a great friend

393
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,177
to try to make this
punk-ass look good.

394
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,928
Hey, you can't talk to me
like that, bro.

395
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,221
You're a fucking set mechanic.

396
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:32,723
I'm number one
on the call sheet, all right.

397
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,017
Calm down, kid. Calm down.

398
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,437
You took this gig for money
just like everybody else.

399
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,855
We're making art, all right.

400
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:41,023
- Art?
- Yeah.

401
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:45,027
This show makes a dumpster fire
look like <i>Citizen Kane</i>.

402
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,778
Yeah, well, this show
is number one in the country,

403
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,030
we are number one.

404
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,991
That says more about society
than the quality of your show.

405
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,410
Hey, listen,
I have a 66 Chevelle

406
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,037
that's got a bum clutch.

407
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,955
- You got a card?
- Yeah.

408
00:24:58,457 --> 00:25:00,959
- Here man, call me anytime.
- Thank you.

409
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:02,377
- You guys good?
- Yes, sir.

410
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,756
Where you wanna do this?

411
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,008
Well, I want 1-1-7 right here.

412
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,344
It's how many people watched
last week's episode.

413
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:11,637
117?

414
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:13,305
Million, yeah.

415
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,016
I know, I can't believe people
pay to watch this shit either.

416
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,351
Let's go in my trailer.

417
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:23,690
FILM CREW MEMBER 1:
Action!

418
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:24,942
(Thud)

419
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:28,862
- Dennis!
- Hey, dude.

420
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:30,948
Dennis, up!

421
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,032
Oh, shoot!

422
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:36,954
(Gun blaring)
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

423
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,709
(♪♪♪)

424
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,493
Hi.

425
00:26:17,494 --> 00:26:18,704
Now what?

426
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,540
Well, found your fingerprints
on your lighter.

427
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,041
JIMMY:
Who'd have thought?

428
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,042
And?

429
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,962
We got motive, we got access,

430
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:31,258
and we're one hair follicle away
from writing your warrant.

431
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:33,385
How'd you find me?

432
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,263
VARGAS: You got a GPS
in your pocket, buddy.

433
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,472
(Vargas chuckling)

434
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,016
You need a warrant
to track a phone.

435
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,518
You know you're actually correct
about that.

436
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,354
But the thing is judges
these days, they're real busy

437
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:45,731
and they know
we're the good guys.

438
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:47,608
So they kinda let it slide.

439
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:50,986
Now, you gonna offer me
a cigarette or what?

440
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:55,157
No, it's cool, I actually quit.
Here's the deal.

441
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,951
Everybody I talk to
across the board,

442
00:26:58,035 --> 00:27:00,412
they all say
you're a stand-up guy,

443
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,247
except for the five years
in the pen

444
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:04,458
for putting a guy
in a wheelchair.

445
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,253
I didn't start that fight.

446
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:10,464
But you sure ended it,
didn't you?

447
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,091
And I bet you'd do it
all over again.

448
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,221
Came at me with a screwdriver.

449
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:19,640
Screwdriver.
Shit, that's a deadly weapon.

450
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,728
You know a guy named Persi?

451
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,313
I don't remember his last name.

452
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:27,814
Fucking Persi something,
whatever.

453
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:29,191
Why?

454
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,276
Used to run with Star.

455
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,195
You playing detective now?

456
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,490
Just concerned citizen.

457
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,242
I like that.

458
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,372
You know, uh, I found out
why you hang out at Rocka's bar.

459
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,961
Should have just told me
your mom was a working gal.

460
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,212
There's no shame in it.

461
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:53,257
Detective Freeman,
he told me that was her spot

462
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,509
until, you know,
she went missing.

463
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:56,969
And of course, your dad,

464
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,179
he lost his mind
trying to find her.

465
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,306
I'm just saying, you know,
I... I get it.

466
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,518
I understand why you feel
so connected to the case.

467
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,563
Sure do have a way with words.

468
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,232
Hey pal, James, Jimmy,

469
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,984
I uh... you know,
that's as close

470
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,319
as you're gonna get
to an apology from me.

471
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:18,156
Yeah, fine, well...
I have to go.

472
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:20,242
Just, hey, take it easy.

473
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:21,702
Let us do our thing.

474
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,954
Detective Freeman,
he's a great cop

475
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:26,874
and me, I'm the best thing
that ever happened

476
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:28,792
to the Robbery-Homicide Unit.

477
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,421
How many cases
you close last year?

478
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,256
You want my numbers now?
You want my stats?

479
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,216
I mean, if they were any good,
you'd be squawking about 'em.

480
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,551
Oh, come on.

481
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:39,845
You speak to Star's family?

482
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,097
Tell 'em what happened?

483
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,683
Well, they disowned her
a long time ago,

484
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,894
but they're raising her kid
as their own.

485
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:49,897
How old?

486
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:53,233
4. Actually the same age
as my boy Terry.

487
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:59,990
James, just don't go kicking
the hornet's nest.

488
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:00,949
'Course not.

489
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,910
- You understand?
- Yes.

490
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:04,745
Okay. I'll catch you later.

491
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:08,248

492
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:27,851

502
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:01,500
ROY:
Hey man, don't fuck that paint.

503
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,752
I can't be assed with an
L & D form.

504
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:05,629
(Cellphone ringing)

505
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:08,005
You got Roy.

506
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:10,717
Roy, it's Jimmy.

507
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,719
I met you on set.

508
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:14,221
<i>Hey, buddy, what's going on?</i>

509
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,764
<i>Someone tried to run me down
just now.</i>

510
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:18,725
No shit.
Someone tried to kill you?

511
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:20,561
<i>Yeah.</i> (Indistinct speech)

512
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:21,853
<i>That's not
what makes it personal,</i>

513
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,938
so much as they fucked up
my ride.

514
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,482
<i>Holy shit, man!</i>

515
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:26,859
<i>You know who it was?</i>

516
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,152
If I did, I wouldn't say so
on the phone.

517
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:32,739
You know what, it's nothing.

518
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:35,409
It don't sound like nothing
to me, man,

519
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,120
but what's it like to be you?

520
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:40,205
<i>It was a Rover Wagon.
It was super charged.</i>

521
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,081
<i>Had some real fucking
balls to it.</i>

522
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:45,043
Still not the smartest way
to try to kill somebody.

523
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,838
<i>Yeah, maybe they're smarter
than you think, man.</i>

524
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,425
Random ex-con cut down
on the side of the road?

525
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:52,592
Who'd give a shit?

526
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,219
Yeah, that's one way to put it,
I guess.

527
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:58,098
<i>Rover's a lot bigger
than a bullet though, bro.</i>

528
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:00,350
Oh no, they came at me
with those, too.

529
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:02,519
Listen...

530
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:07,816
I got this feeling that
you might be able to uh,

531
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,319
you know, get me
some sort of protection.

532
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,528
<i>You know what I'm talking about?</i>

533
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:13,405
10-4, good buddy.

534
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:16,450
I know you're a kindred soul
of the heathen brethren.

535
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,286
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

536
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:20,829
Of course it's a yes, man.

537
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:22,080
Send me the address.

538
00:35:22,748 --> 00:35:24,082
I'll text it to you.

539
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,588
VARGAS:
So this doesn't add up.

540
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:33,175
How does Jimmy go
from felony assault

541
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:34,927
to multiple homicides?

542
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,096
I don't get it.

543
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:40,057
- The old days...
- Yeah.

544
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,101
You told me about, you'd just
taken a telephone book to 'em.

545
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:44,603
Now I gotta actually
question people

546
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:46,855
- and go fucking by the book.
- Right.

547
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:48,065
(Vargas chuckles)

548
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,399
- Yeah.
- Pain in the ass.

549
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:53,070
- Well...
- Mhmm.

550
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,655
I guess I'll take care
of this here,

551
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:56,532
- you gonna hit the game?
- Yeah.

552
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:57,741
VARGAS:
Who is it this week?

553
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,826
- Malibu.
- Right.

554
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,745
If they don't beat them,
who can they beat?

555
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:02,829
- Yeah.
- (Chuckles)

556
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,164
Exactly.

557
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:07,668
I'll take care of this,
all right.

558
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,169
- All right.
- I got it.

559
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:10,879
I hope they win.

560
00:36:18,262 --> 00:36:19,263
(Sighs)

561
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:24,601
I didn't think you'd show.

562
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:27,980
Every brother needs a keeper
from time to time.

563
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,023
Are you sure you want this?

564
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,485
I got someone trying to pin
a bunch of murders on me.

565
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:35,529
I'm not going back inside,

566
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,531
especially not for something
I didn't do.

567
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:39,658
Easy, new friend, easy.

568
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,243
The fuck am I into?

569
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:43,453
Show business, son.

570
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,373
It's the most gangster game
out there.

571
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:47,833
You got family?

572
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,335
No, not since my dad died.

573
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:51,837
Hmm, how'd he go?

574
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:54,089
Bottle.

575
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,382
Hmm.

576
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,050
Come here, let's do this.

577
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,477
Your dad teach you how to shoot?

578
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,022
All right.

579
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,900
You got six rounds in there.

580
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:17,696
There you go.

581
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,328
How much do I owe you?

582
00:37:24,953 --> 00:37:25,913
Nothing, man.

583
00:37:25,996 --> 00:37:27,664
Just a favor down the line.

584
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:29,750
All right.

585
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:31,585
Anytime.

586
00:37:31,668 --> 00:37:33,212
Yeah, I'll hold you to that.

587
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,797
But you be careful, man.

588
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:38,967
- See you.
- Thank you.

589
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:53,440

591
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:28,267
I may have to get out of town.

592
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,018
We should go somewhere.

593
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,855
Huh, I got that ticket
to Berlin, baby.

594
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,233
What ticket?

595
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:38,193
I didn't tell you?

596
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:41,822
I would have remembered.

597
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,657
I'm leaving Monday.

598
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,952
Sandy is there as an au pair,

599
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:50,956
we'll hang,
I hear it's a good scene.

600
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:54,084
Berlin?

601
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,837
It's in Germany.

602
00:38:58,589 --> 00:38:59,798
Yeah.

603
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:03,552
(Chuckles)

604
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:07,222
You live in the moment, Jimmy.

605
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:11,476
Yeah.

606
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:22,070
Fucking Berlin.

607
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:23,530

610
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:58,440
What's up, buddy?

611
00:39:58,524 --> 00:40:00,442
- How you doing?
- Good.

612
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:02,444
I need a favor.

613
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:05,697
(Scoffs)

614
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:07,533
You know I can't get back
into the evidence locker.

615
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:08,575
They won't let me back there.

616
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:10,244
- It's not that kind of favor.
- What is it?

617
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:12,538
I need you to run a name
through IVIS.

618
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,750
What's the name?

619
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:18,001
Oh fuck.

620
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,212
Uh...

621
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,882
Peter Mul...

622
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,301
Persi Mul, something or other.

623
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,345
Mul something.
What is that?

624
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,597
Persi Muleeney?

625
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:31,932
That's it.

00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,141
(Scoffs)

627
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:34,852
Man, he lives up on Mulholland.

628
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:36,770
He's got an office down
on Skid Row.

629
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:37,771
You know him?

630
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:39,231
Yeah, everybody knows him.

631
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:40,732
He's a popular guy.

632
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,609
Give me a current address.

633
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:44,152

634
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,654
Look, man, is this something
that's gonna come back

635
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:47,447
- and bite me in the ass?
- No, never.

636
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:48,782
- Yeah.
- Absolutely not.

637
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,868
Yeah, I believe you again, huh?

638
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:55,622
Look, man, you know
I'll lie on the stand, right,

639
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:57,124
say you had a gun to my head.

640
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:00,460
That's why I love you, brother.

641
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:02,671
You really are LA's finest,
huh?

642
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,173
Aww, that's sweet.
Fuck you, too.

(Jimmy chuckles)

644
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:07,176
Can you tell me
what he's driving?

645
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:17,769
Seems his 2011 Land Rover
was reported stolen yesterday.

646
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:34,369
You didn't get that from me.

647
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,750
He's having a party
up at his place tonight.

648
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:42,920
Lot of cops gonna be there,
'cause we get in free.

649
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:44,588
Yeah.

650
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:47,132
Seems he knows what lives
matter most.

651
00:41:49,218 --> 00:41:50,427
All right.

652
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:52,554
Stay lucky, buddy.

653
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:55,724
Next time have the decency
to buy me a fucking coffee.

00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:43,021
Yeah, 14th.

660
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:46,817
Where's your badge?

661
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:48,819
It's in the car.

00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:05,344
One thing,
they got this red-headed mayor,

712
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:09,139
I'm fucking telling you,
she's got big fucking tits.

713
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:11,934
And man, she loves to ride.

714
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:13,227
She loves to ride, huh?

715
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,187
Who the fuck invited you
to my party?

716
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:17,397
I invited me.

717
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,733
I was hoping to have a minute
in private,

718
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:21,818
but suit yourself.

719
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:28,951
Gisella, Lana, and Star.

720
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,453
You ever heard
those names before?

721
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,205
I'll give you a hint.

722
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,290
They're not fucking race horses.

723
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:37,501
Kaiser, get this motherfucker
out of here.

724
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:38,919
JIMMY:
Hold on, Kaiser.

725
00:48:39,545 --> 00:48:40,671
You ever met 'em?

726
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:42,297
No, I can't say I have.

727
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:45,217
You like jokes?

728
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:46,593
Yeah, who don't like
a fucking joke.

729
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:48,262
If this is a joke,
I don't find it funny.

730
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:50,138
JIMMY: I'ma tell you...
I'ma tell you a joke.

731
00:48:51,682 --> 00:48:53,809
Three words to ruin a man's ego?

732
00:48:53,892 --> 00:48:54,768
"Is it in?"

733
00:48:54,852 --> 00:48:56,061
Now get the fuck out.

734
00:48:57,563 --> 00:48:58,856
You heard that one before.

735
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:00,649
Yeah, I heard,
I'm the one who wrote it.

736
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:02,818
'Cause this girl told it
to me the other night.

737
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:04,027
PERSI:
What girl?

738
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:06,154
Same girl
you said you never met.

739
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:07,155
She heard it in my movie.

740
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:09,116
I just told you,
David Cop-A-Feel. It's...

741
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,077
Anybody who watches pornos,
watch... knows the fucking line.

742
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,036
It's famous.

743
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,621
Now get the fuck out of here!

744
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:16,498
Of course it is.

745
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,458
Night, guys.

746
00:49:21,378 --> 00:49:22,546
Is that coke?

747
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,716
And they're fucking passed out?

748
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,467
PERSI:
Yeah, I got fucking coke.

749
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:29,469
JIMMY:
Can I rip a line of blow?

750
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:30,804
You get the fuck
out of my house,

751
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:32,014
you can't have none!

752
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:35,350
Oh to be you, huh.

753
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:38,645
Small dick motherfucker.

754
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:52,659
- You really a cop?
- No.

755
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,878
I seen them here, those girls.

756
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,964
Come with a sista I knows.

757
00:50:06,924 --> 00:50:08,425
Eleanor Rogers.

758
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:12,262
She's one, uh,
20 feet from stardom types.

759
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:14,681
Backup singer.

760
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:16,099
Preacher's daughter.

761
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:20,854
Why you telling me this?

762
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:25,317
The fuck?
Motherfucker, I'm telling you.

763
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:27,110
Leave it at that.

764
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,570
Get the fuck outta here.

765
00:50:30,781 --> 00:50:31,990
Thanks.

766
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:37,955
(Car engine rumbling)

767
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:50,926
(♪♪♪)

768
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:33,177
(Indistinct singing)

769
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:49,067
(Humming)

770
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,078
That was you singing, huh?

771
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:02,873
Guilty.

772
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:07,044
It's a recording studio?

773
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:15,260
I'm looking for Miss Rogers.

774
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:17,262
Miss Eleanor Rogers.

775
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:18,889
Why?

776
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:22,726
Our mutual friend Kaiser says
we should talk.

777
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,811
About?

778
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:27,564
About something
we're both involved in,

779
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:28,565
we shouldn't be.

780
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:36,657
I'll be at Shay's on 3rd, okay.

781
00:52:37,449 --> 00:52:38,742
Hey, you got a light?

782
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:41,370
Yeah.

783
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:49,503
Don't lose it.

784
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:52,714
There's already enough
of those floating around.

785
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:02,349
ELEANOR:
You don't mean Persi Muleeney?

786
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:05,143
Nah, he ain't got it in him
to murder any girls like that.

787
00:53:05,227 --> 00:53:06,353
He ain't that slick.

788
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:10,190
But he knows some fucking cats
doing some fucked up shit.

789
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:12,109
What cats?

790
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,570
He likes to strut
with a scary crowd

791
00:53:14,653 --> 00:53:16,113
with his tail all up in the air.

792
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:18,031
But as much as he likes to be
on this gangsta shit,

793
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:21,368
they just take his money
and laugh at his dumb white ass.

794
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,703
Drug people?

795
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:23,704
Fuck yeah.

796
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,539
Cartel hookup.

797
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:26,707
Why's someone like you
hanging out

798
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:28,500
with someone shady like Persi?

799
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:30,627
Someone like me?

800
00:53:32,754 --> 00:53:34,256
He told me
he'd put up all kinds of money

801
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:36,049
to help me put out a solo album.

802
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:37,843
And did he?

803
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:40,512
No.

804
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:43,307
Said if I could fuck like
I could sing...

805
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:47,477
Well, I'm not even gonna
tell you the rest of that

806
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:48,937
'cause I don't want
my father's ghost

807
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:50,272
hearing that
come out of my mouth.

808
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:54,193
Persi said
he never met the girls.

809
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:56,528
Oh, honey, no, no, he lied.

810
00:53:57,279 --> 00:53:58,530
What else?

811
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:02,159
Those girls, I mean,
oh my God,

812
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:05,495
the way they were found
like that, I mean,

813
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,414
that was somebody sending
a message.

814
00:54:07,497 --> 00:54:09,082
You said that wasn't
Persi's style.

815
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,125
No, no.

816
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:12,878
I think it was...
it was like those people

817
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:14,588
I was talking about earlier,

818
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:17,633
the ones that likes to use
Persi's house like it's theirs.

819
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:18,967
"Scary crowd".

820
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:20,928
Shit, you ain't heard this
from me.

821
00:54:21,512 --> 00:54:23,222
That scene is a blackhole.

822
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:25,390
Girls come up missing
all the time,

823
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:26,725
guys always trying
to take advantage

824
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:27,851
of the situation.

825
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:31,104
There was this one creeper
at a party one night.

826
00:54:31,188 --> 00:54:32,272
Late like 4:00 in the morning.

827
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:33,440
Silver-haired dude.

828
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:35,817
Now we were gonna go
to the patio and get high.

829
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:38,403
Anyway, the silver-haired dude
was inside

830
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:40,656
and I saw him talking to some
girls who had been there,

831
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:43,825
I'd seen them a couple of times
and they were giving him money.

832
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:45,911
About a week later,
I'm pulled over

833
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:47,871
for not using my turn signal,
and it was him,

834
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:49,081
the silver-haired dude.

835
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:50,165
He's a fucking cop.

836
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:52,334
- Is he a stocky guy?
- Yes, yeah.

837
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:53,418
Uh, Flosso.

838
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:55,003
Officer Flosso,
that was the name on the ticket.

839
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:55,963
JIMMY:
Right, right.

840
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:57,965
ELEANOR: The girl said
he was a cage fighter.

841
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:03,762
Our friend Kaiser,
I need to talk to him again.

842
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:04,888
Well, I'll give you his number,

843
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:06,515
but, you know,
don't expect much.

844
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:09,726
He's a moody motherfucker,
like you.

845
00:55:13,814 --> 00:55:16,942
Oh, one more thing,
and maybe it's nothing

846
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:20,112
but the silver-haired guy,
I saw him take some money

847
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:22,781
and then give it to this guy,
the "Doc".

848
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:24,283
Well, we called him
"Dr. Feelgood",

849
00:55:24,366 --> 00:55:26,118
because, you know,
he was giving out

850
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:28,078
pills like it was candy.

851
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:31,290
Big beard
and the curly-ish hair,

852
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:33,041
deep voice, like...

853
00:55:34,626 --> 00:55:37,171
I don't fucking know,
that also happened.

854
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,840
I don't know if that helps.

855
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:42,551
I wish I'd met you a week ago.

856
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:46,013
Oh, what do you do?

857
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:48,098
What do I do?

858
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,725
Yeah?

859
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:53,145
Um, uh, a lotta this, lately.

860
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:56,064
No, when you're not creeping
on singers outside of studios.

861
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:57,316
Did you say creeping?

862
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:58,400
I...

863
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:00,986
Um, what do I do?

864
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,739
- I do uh, I do tattoos.
- Hmm.

865
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:07,159
And uh... motors.

866
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:09,203
- Hmm, rock 'n' roll life.
- Yeah.

867
00:56:09,286 --> 00:56:10,495
- Very cool.
- It's right.

868
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:11,747
It's good people mostly.

869
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,707
- Yeah.
- You got any ink?

870
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,918
Oh man, no.

871
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,587
I never found anything that
I wanted to stay with me

872
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:19,588
for life, you know.

873
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:20,756
Oh.

874
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:23,592
Sometimes a tattoo
is just a tattoo.

875
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:26,553
Okay, well then how come
most girls get a rose

876
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:27,888
or a dolphin?

877
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,390
Fucking angel wings.

878
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:32,851
- How trashy is that?
- Touché.

879
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:34,770
- It's so trashy, right.
- Touché.

880
00:56:34,853 --> 00:56:36,939
Yeah, well, you know
times are... times are tough.

881
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:38,106
Ink is ink.

882
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,775
Oh, and that's when you do
those kind of tattoos.

883
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:41,318
I draw the line at tramp stamps.

884
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:43,195
- Oh.
- (Laughing)

885
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:46,323
Well, it is good to know
there's a line.

886
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:47,783
Yeah, there is.

887
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:49,910
No, they all mean something.

888
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:54,414
- It's not gonna run out on you.
- No.

889
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:57,000
That's a different story,
probably a different tattoo.

890
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:01,547
(Cellphone dings)

891
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:04,174
Oh, I have to go.

892
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,051
That is my 15.

893
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:07,678
I've got an audition.

894
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:08,804
Mm?

895
00:57:08,887 --> 00:57:10,556
Uh I hope that this helped.

896
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:13,141
Changed my day around.

897
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:14,768
Oh, fine.

898
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:16,562
Maybe I'll see you around.

899
00:57:16,645 --> 00:57:18,438
- Good luck on your audition.
- Thank you.

900
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:19,731
You're welcome.

901
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:33,036
(♪♪♪)

902
00:58:09,615 --> 00:58:12,117
Meet me behind the station.
I have something to show you.

903
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:20,918
(Snorting)

904
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:29,760
(Cellphone ringing)

905
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:32,679
(Coughs)

906
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:35,849
Yo.

907
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:38,685
Yeah, we've... we've been
shooting all night.

908
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:41,063
Jayne busted into my party
the other night,

909
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:43,690
asking me about Star
and the others.

910
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:45,025
Nah, I didn't tell him shit.

911
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:46,735
The asshole ruined my high.

912
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:49,655
You gotta be cool, bro.

913
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:52,783
There's some girls here.

914
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:56,078
(Snorts, coughs)
(Knocking on door)

915
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:58,664
Yeah, I still got 'em,
come on up.

916
00:58:59,039 --> 00:58:59,915
Okay, cool.

917
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,500
(Knocking on door)

918
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:06,255
Hey, yo, what...
what are you doing here?

919
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:08,715
You don't... you can't just come
over to my office like this.

920
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:11,844
(♪♪♪)

921
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:19,017
(Grunting, moaning in distance)

922
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:34,449
ERASMUS: Looking for Persi?
All the way down to the left.

923
00:59:35,784 --> 00:59:38,412
(indistinct speech)

924
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:50,048
Bye, Juicy.

925
00:59:50,382 --> 00:59:52,676
(♪♪♪)

926
01:00:02,394 --> 01:00:03,604
(Screams)

927
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:06,315
(♪♪♪)

928
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:26,752
Hey.

929
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:29,213
FREEMAN:
What is it, Jimmy?

930
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:30,714
You're gonna wanna see this.

931
01:00:30,797 --> 01:00:31,840
FREEMAN:
What?

932
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:34,426
You need to move your car
before we get it towed.

933
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:35,928
Yeah, I could move it.

934
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:38,555
I could drive it
right to the morgue.

935
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:40,307
What are you talking about?

936
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:48,690
Who's pulling the strings?

937
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:51,652
Who could throw the body
of a giant in a trunk

938
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,070
without nobody seeing?

939
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:55,489
Whoever did it,
picked the locks

940
01:00:55,572 --> 01:00:57,908
in the parking lot on Franklin
where they threw the body.

941
01:00:58,617 --> 01:01:00,244
In broad daylight?

942
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:02,371
They did it sometime
in the morning

943
01:01:02,454 --> 01:01:03,872
while I was having breakfast.

944
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:05,290
You've been tracking my cell,

945
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:07,292
you know
I couldn't have done this.

946
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:09,044
VARGAS:
I don't know, buddy.

947
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:13,048
I think somebody's seriously
fucking with you, big time.

948
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,050
Or warning me.

949
01:01:16,134 --> 01:01:18,095
Maybe they knew Kaiser
was trying to help me.

950
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:19,304
Yeah.

951
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:21,098
Now don't you think
the smart thing to do

952
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:22,391
would have been to tell us

953
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:25,143
about this when the Land Rover
first tried to run you down?

954
01:01:26,645 --> 01:01:28,981
I've never been accused
of being smart.

955
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:29,940
Right.

956
01:01:30,148 --> 01:01:33,819
What about your visit
to Persi's party?

957
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:35,404
Persi had nothing to do with it.

958
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:37,447
He's just a bad host.

959
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:38,615
If I were you,
I would check the people

960
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:40,617
at the Chateau party,
that's where I'd start.

961
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:45,205
Sorry, buddy,
afraid we have to keep the car.

962
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:50,335
Okay. Well, don't scratch it.

963
01:01:50,502 --> 01:01:51,712
Don't fuck with the radio.

964
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:54,590
No scratch, no problem.

965
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:56,508
Who's driving me home?

966
01:01:57,259 --> 01:01:58,719
I'll drive you home.

967
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,482
Hey, no smoking in the cruiser.

968
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:14,735
It's regulations.

969
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:16,236
All right,
have a couple of puffs,

970
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,362
I'll wait.

971
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:25,078
What a fucking day, man.

972
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:27,372
Yeah, me too.

973
01:02:28,498 --> 01:02:29,917
Persi's dead.

974
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:32,920
Yeah, I know,
a real loss to humanity.

975
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:35,047
How'd he go?

976
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:36,757
VARGAS:
Snapped neck.

977
01:02:37,758 --> 01:02:41,345
Now look, I'm only gonna
tell you this once,

978
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:43,639
I don't think you're involved
in this

979
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:46,141
any more than somebody
wants you to be.

980
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:47,267
Okay.

981
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:51,313
I'm next.

982
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:53,899
I think you're right.

983
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:55,400
JIMMY:
How's that?

984
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:59,363
You know something
you don't even know you know.

985
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:03,492
Or somebody wants you to know
something, you know.

986
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:06,787
Let's hit it.

987
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:08,121
Put that out.

988
01:03:11,667 --> 01:03:13,001
(Vargas grunts)

989
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,982
(Birds chirping)

990
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:45,951
So this how you live?

991
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,164
Yeah,
Dad left me the house.

992
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:56,503
Mortgaged to get the shop,
couldn't make the payment, closed,

993
01:03:57,212 --> 01:03:59,590
told the family moving in that this
is a separate property.

994
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:02,968
So what, they can kick you out
anytime they want?

995
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:07,055
I don't know, James.

996
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:11,143
All right, concerned citizen,

997
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:15,439
why don't you tell me
who you think's involved?

998
01:04:15,731 --> 01:04:16,690
Flosso.

999
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:18,400
Flosso?

1000
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:20,527
JIMMY:
He's an ex-fighter.

1001
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:21,486
Huh.

1002
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:24,198
He'd certainly know how to
break their necks clean enough.

1003
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:26,658
So this preacher's daughter,
your source,

1004
01:04:26,742 --> 01:04:28,243
she for certain it was him?

1005
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:31,496
Yeah,
he's working for somebody.

1006
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:33,665
Well, that makes sense,
'cause Flosso,

1007
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:35,334
he's a real dumb shit.

1008
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:37,419
He wouldn't be able to do it
on his own.

1009
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:40,297
I'll look him up,
I'll see what I can find.

1010
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:44,635
Hey Vargas,
how well you know your partner?

1011
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:47,304
Why you ask?

1012
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:50,349
'Cause I think he's dirty.

1013
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:54,770
I think he found my lighter
and thought I was an easy mark.

1014
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:57,397
You're reaching, buddy.

1015
01:04:57,731 --> 01:05:00,150
And you better be careful
what you're saying.

1016
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,402
He have an alibi?

1017
01:05:02,653 --> 01:05:04,696
Matter of fact he does.

1018
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:07,574
He was half in the bag
over at the Montello.

1019
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:09,159
How're the cameras at the
Montello Lounge?

1020
01:05:09,243 --> 01:05:10,285
- They're good.
- Yeah?

1021
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:11,453
Yeah.

1022
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:14,331
If you check the video footage
and you see him

1023
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:16,667
leaving between 2:00 and 2:30,
then I was right.

1024
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:20,629
And if I'm right,
I just wanna know about it.

1025
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:23,173
No. All right,
no more cowboy shit.

1026
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:25,801
I'll take a look at the tapes,
but I can already tell you

1027
01:05:25,884 --> 01:05:27,636
what I'm gonna find, okay.

1028
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:30,722
And by the way,
you're all wrong about Freeman.

1029
01:05:31,431 --> 01:05:34,142
He's a good guy,
he's my kid's godfather.

1030
01:05:37,062 --> 01:05:38,397
Hitler loved dogs.

1031
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:39,898
Huh.

1032
01:05:39,982 --> 01:05:41,233
What's your point?

1033
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:44,111
My point is
some of the most evil people

1034
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:46,238
in the world
still have great smiles.

1035
01:05:47,781 --> 01:05:48,782
That's interesting.

1036
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:50,659
Just do me a favor.

1037
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:52,369
Stand down, all right.

1038
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:54,496
You done enough, okay?

1039
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,042
It's depressing.

1040
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:04,923
(♪♪♪)

1041
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:22,858
JIMMY:
<i>What's your name?</i>

1042
01:06:26,403 --> 01:06:27,654
STAR:
<i>Star.</i>

1043
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:35,120
If you forget, just look up.

1044
01:06:37,331 --> 01:06:40,125
(♪♪♪)

1045
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:03,815
(Sighs)

1046
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:11,198
(Bike engine rumbling)

1047
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:16,036
The shit's vegan, right?

1048
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:18,288
Makeup? It's vegan?

1049
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:19,498
Go check.

1050
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:21,667
It's in my contract,
vegan makeup!

1051
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:24,878
(♪♪♪)

1052
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:43,856
Don't fucking say anything,
I'm mic'd.

1053
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:49,570
Okay, you know
what it looks like... I'm fr...

1054
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:51,071
Shut the fuck up!

1055
01:07:51,238 --> 01:07:52,364
Shut up!

1056
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:56,159
You lied to me.

1057
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:58,871
You lie to me again,
I'll break your fucking face,

1058
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:00,122
you understand?

1059
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:01,874
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1060
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:03,083
- Yeah?
- Okay.

1061
01:08:08,922 --> 01:08:10,340
Tell me about Persi.

1062
01:08:10,757 --> 01:08:11,717
Fuck, man.

1063
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,886
I was embarrassed to admit
that I was hanging with Persi

1064
01:08:13,969 --> 01:08:16,054
'cause he is a fucking scumbag,
okay.

1065
01:08:16,138 --> 01:08:18,098
But it's not illegal to drink
his booze and eat his food,

1066
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:21,185
not to mention, fucking pussy
flying around that place.

1067
01:08:21,268 --> 01:08:23,020
I mean, anything goes there.

1068
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:24,854
Like what?

1069
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:28,317
Some local cops there
hanging out now,

1070
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:30,027
playing poker in the back.

1071
01:08:31,862 --> 01:08:34,156
That's not all that's going on
back there.

1072
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:36,116
Yeah, I heard a few pimped
some girls,

1073
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,868
but that's none
of my fucking business.

1074
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:39,953
I had nothing to do
with those dead hookers.

1075
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,832
Star and her friends,
did they go to this party?

1076
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:46,376
Yeah, man, I said that,
I seen them there a few times

1077
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,545
but there's 50 fucking girls
there every night.

1078
01:08:48,629 --> 01:08:50,881
You wanna talk to someone?
Talk to Erasmus.

1079
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:52,883
Am I supposed to know
who that is?

1080
01:08:52,966 --> 01:08:54,510
Erasmus Alcindor.
He's a screenwriter.

1081
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:57,304
He's a fucking hack,
looks like a ferret.

1082
01:08:57,763 --> 01:08:59,430
He used to date Star.

1083
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:01,433
Look, I don't know
why they dated either,

1084
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:02,975
she's a fucking beautiful girl
messing around

1085
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,770
with some fucking creep.

1086
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:07,104
He used to lie to her
and say he'd put her in movies.

1087
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:11,734
He talks to that cop Flosso,
all the time.

1088
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:15,238
Where can I find him?

1089
01:09:16,113 --> 01:09:17,282
Erasmus?

1090
01:09:17,908 --> 01:09:20,452
He lives in those shithole apartments
in Persi's studios.

1091
01:09:21,036 --> 01:09:22,621
I swear to fucking God, man.

1092
01:09:22,828 --> 01:09:24,790
Fuck God,
I swear to you, okay?

1093
01:09:24,872 --> 01:09:26,792
He knows everything about
their operation.

1094
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:27,876
Everything.

1095
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:34,925
I swear to you,
I swear, I swear, I...

1096
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:37,511
Listen, listen,
you little bitch.

1097
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:39,930
- You gonna lie to me again?
- No.

1098
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:42,099
- You gonna lie to me again?
- No, I'm not gonna lie again!

1099
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:43,140
No!

1100
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:46,144
(♪♪♪)

1101
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:31,565
Erasmus?

1102
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:52,920
Go away!

1103
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:54,379
Erasmus?

1104
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,340
Are you fucking deaf?
He's not here.

1105
01:11:03,889 --> 01:11:05,807
This can go one of two ways.

1106
01:11:05,891 --> 01:11:08,352
You watch who you're throwing insults
out of your word-hole to,

1107
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:10,229
you... you...
the wrong person hears it,

1108
01:11:10,521 --> 01:11:12,773
and you'll be in a fucking
cheap hotel room dead,

1109
01:11:12,856 --> 01:11:13,941
you hear me?

1110
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:16,568
(Grunts)

1111
01:11:17,528 --> 01:11:18,737
ERASMUS:
Fuck, man.

1112
01:11:19,071 --> 01:11:19,988
I'm a pacifist!

1113
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,657
I'm a pacifist!

1114
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:23,283
Fuck.

1115
01:11:23,367 --> 01:11:24,284
I'm not.

1116
01:11:26,453 --> 01:11:27,746
You going somewhere?

1117
01:11:27,829 --> 01:11:28,705
Babylon has fallen,

1118
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:30,624
can't you see
it's the last days of Rome?

1119
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:37,506
You want to know what I see?

1120
01:11:39,591 --> 01:11:42,886
I see a piece of shit
who's in way over his head

1121
01:11:43,053 --> 01:11:44,304
who's gonna tell me
all about his girlfriend.

1122
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:45,931
Which one?

1123
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:47,641
You know which one.

1124
01:11:47,724 --> 01:11:48,934
Fucking Star.

1125
01:11:49,017 --> 01:11:50,811
Star's not my girlfriend,
you sperm-less testicle,

1126
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:52,145
she's my friend.

1127
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:54,731
Alright, women, I'm not a threat
to them, they trust me,

1128
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:56,483
they bare
their midnight fantasies,

1129
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:57,734
their hopes and dreams.

1130
01:11:58,819 --> 01:12:00,112
(Grunts in pain)

1131
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:05,492
Alright, I'm telling you
that she was an angel! Star.

1132
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:07,786
They should've called her
"The-Whole-fucking-Galaxy".

1133
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:08,787
Who killed her?

1134
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:10,831
It's not that simple, man.

1135
01:12:10,914 --> 01:12:12,124
She was...
it's not that simple.

1136
01:12:12,207 --> 01:12:14,418
She was blackmailing us...
them, them!

1137
01:12:14,501 --> 01:12:16,086
That's not an admission
of guilt.

1138
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,422
- She was blackmailing them.
- Who?

1139
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:20,174
I tried to stop her,
but she brought the others

1140
01:12:20,257 --> 01:12:21,258
- in on it.
- Who?

1141
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:22,843
All the girls, man.

1142
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:25,637
Persi used to run drugs
up from Mexico.

1143
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:27,764
He had to find a way
to launder the money,

1144
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:28,932
so he got in the film business

1145
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:30,642
and then he started
trafficking girls,

1146
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:32,352
all the girls
who wanna be in his movies.

1147
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:34,479
Didn't ask for a fucking resume.

1148
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:36,398
Tell me who killed Star.

1149
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,692
ERASMUS:
Flosso, man.

1150
01:12:39,026 --> 01:12:41,737
They always used Flosso to keep
the girls in line.

1151
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:43,030
Don't fucking lie to me.

1152
01:12:43,113 --> 01:12:44,740
- (Indistinct speech)
- Don't fucking lie to me.

1153
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:47,201
Half the fucking precinct
is in it, man.

1154
01:12:47,284 --> 01:12:49,161
How you think they wear
such nice suits?

1155
01:12:49,244 --> 01:12:50,287
I want names.

1156
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:52,915
Goddammit, Flosso is a name!

1157
01:12:52,998 --> 01:12:54,374
Flosso is a name.

1158
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:02,174
Who ordered the hit?

1159
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,301
Who ordered the hit!

1160
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:05,636
He'll kill me.

1161
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:07,137
I'll fucking kill you.

1162
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:08,722
Who ordered the hit?

1163
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:10,349
ERASMUS:
Freeman.

1164
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:13,018
- Detective...
- Don't fucking lie to me, man.

1165
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:17,523
ERASMUS:
I'm telling the truth, man.

1166
01:13:17,606 --> 01:13:19,525
I overheard him
and Persi talking.

1167
01:13:21,652 --> 01:13:24,404
It's... it's not killing women
to them, man.

1168
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:26,949
It's more like clearing out
rotten inventory.

1169
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:29,993
Like difficult women
make bad hookers, man.

1170
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:33,372
And you were...
you were the perfect fall guy.

1171
01:13:33,455 --> 01:13:34,748
You screwed everything up,
man.

1172
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:37,584
Now Flosso's in the wind
and they want us all dead.

1173
01:13:39,336 --> 01:13:40,629
How are you involved?

1174
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:43,549
Me, I'm just a writer, man.

1175
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:44,675
I schedule the girls.

1176
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:46,635
I make sure
they have a good time.

1177
01:13:46,718 --> 01:13:48,887
I take care of the girls,
that's it.

1178
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:50,305
And Vargas?

1179
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:52,307
You seen him around?

1180
01:13:52,391 --> 01:13:54,393
Freeman keeps him in the dark,
man.

1181
01:13:54,476 --> 01:13:56,520
Vargas is the worst detective
in the city.

1182
01:13:57,229 --> 01:13:58,730
(Cellphone ringing)

1183
01:13:58,856 --> 01:13:59,773
I'm going to my mom's.

1184
01:13:59,857 --> 01:14:01,149
I should have never left
Glendale.

1185
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:05,028
Yeah.

1186
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:07,656
Just pulled up.

1187
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:09,783
What are you talking about?

1188
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:12,244
To the parlor.

1189
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:16,123
Rent here on Melrose
must be outrageous.

1190
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,000
Wait, what?

1191
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:20,919
Jimmy, you just texted me
15 minutes ago

1192
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:22,838
- saying to meet you here.
- No. No, hey run.

1193
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:23,922
<i>Get out of there.</i>

1194
01:14:24,006 --> 01:14:25,007
<i>Get the fuck out of there.</i>

1195
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:26,633
(grunting)

1196
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:28,510
JIMMY ON PHONE:
<i>Hey? Hey!</i>

1197
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:39,229
(Cellphone ringing)

1198
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:42,524
- JIMMY ON PHONE: Vargas?
- Hey, where are you, Jimmy?

1199
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:45,068
Freeman's mixed
into this for sure.

1200
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:46,153
<i>Yeah, fuck, I know that.</i>

1201
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:48,280
Look,
I just went to The Montello.

1202
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:50,699
They already handed over
their tapes to guess who?

1203
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:51,742
Yeah.

1204
01:14:51,825 --> 01:14:54,411
So listen, Star, she worked
the concession stand

1205
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:55,787
at this old movie theatre.

1206
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,415
She sent an encrypted file
to her boss.

1207
01:14:58,832 --> 01:15:01,335
Forensics, they're trying
to unlock it right now, okay.

1208
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:04,087
Hey, that source
I told you about,

1209
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:05,506
the preacher's daughter,

1210
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:08,008
she somehow got a text
from my phone.

1211
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,135
I was talking to her
when she was abducted.

1212
01:15:10,219 --> 01:15:12,471
Hold on, okay.
We're gonna get an APB out.

1213
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:15,641
Also a bystander ID'd Flosso
leaving the scene

1214
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:17,726
where Star and her friends
were found.

1215
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:19,019
<i>You understand that?</i>

1216
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:21,522
You speak to your captain
about the tapes?

1217
01:15:21,605 --> 01:15:23,273
<i>Look, I haven't talked
to anybody yet.</i>

1218
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:24,525
<i>Where was she?</i>

1219
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:25,943
She's right outside my shop.

1220
01:15:26,026 --> 01:15:27,027
<i>Okay, listen,</i>

1221
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:28,403
I'm gonna roll units over
right now.

1222
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:29,780
Do not go inside, Jimmy.

1223
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:31,532
- You hear me?
- Oh no.

1224
01:15:31,615 --> 01:15:32,950
<i>Do not engage.</i>

1225
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:34,076
Okay.

1226
01:15:35,911 --> 01:15:37,037
Okay.

1227
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:41,667

1228
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:16,910

01:17:25,646 --> 01:17:27,147

1252
01:20:39,256 --> 01:20:40,924
It's Freeman,
gotta bring him in.

FLOSSO:
I don't know.

1266
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:57,960
I could drive this thing
into the Pacific,

1267
01:21:58,043 --> 01:21:59,962
or you can give me an
exact address.

You're gonna die anyways.

Now you can lie to me,
I can make it real slow,

Maybe.

1272

It was Freeman.

1274
01:22:28,115 --> 01:22:30,492
Fucking Freeman caught me
with a gram.

1275
01:22:30,617 --> 01:22:32,369
One gram.

1276
01:22:34,746 --> 01:22:36,665
Told me he'd get IA
to take my badge away

1277
01:22:36,748 --> 01:22:39,585
and put me away for three years
if I didn't work for him.

1278
01:22:43,839 --> 01:22:45,340
You killed Star?

1279

JIMMY:
What's this tunnel?

1284
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:14,786
The kind of tunnel that connects
San Diego with Tijuana.

1285
01:23:16,914 --> 01:23:18,415
Freeman runnin' the operation?

1286

FLOSSO:
Fuck no.

1287
01:23:20,083 --> 01:23:23,253
It's some broker, Dr. Feelgood.

1288
01:23:24,838 --> 01:23:26,465
He's a dangerous cat
though, man.

1289
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,008
He's got eyes everywhere.

I tell you where they are,
I'll take you to 'em,

01:23:35,599 --> 01:23:37,142
you gotta let me go.

1293

It's a fair trade, right?

Yeah.

Where's Flosso?

1305

As soon as we get safe,
he's next.

She's doped up
and ready for transport.

1307
01:25:08,734 --> 01:25:12,321
Buyers pay well
